Words and music by Queen  
Just walking down the street one cloudless sunny day  
Just minding my business thinking my thoughts  
Nothing much to say  
When suddenly I got hit  
Imagine my suprise  
Your smile came up and zapped me right between the eyes  
Id never seen anything to compare with your smile  
Id never seen anything that came within miles  
My heart got hijacked by you  
Stuck in the traffic  
Stuck at the lights what do I see  
Some stupid bimbo in a fast car next to me  
She takes off  
Imagine my disgust  
Like a bat out of hell  
I get to eat her dust  
I never had known anything to compare with her laugh  
Id never known anything that counted by half  
My heart got hijacked by you  
Hijack my heart  
Hijack my heart  
Steals my heart  
Hijack my heart  
Hijack my heart  
Look at the cities  
Look at the streets what do you see  
Look at the faces look at the people they all want to be  
Suddenly hit by something they dont get to choose  
It comes out of nowhere  
Right out of the blue  
Id never seen anything to compare with your smile  
Id never seen anything that came within miles  
My heart got hijacked by you  
Hijack my heart  
Now you really got a hold on me  
You hijacked my heart  
Dont you know you wont let me be  
Stole my heart  
Threw away the key  
Oooee baby whats become of me  
You hijacked my heart  
Now you really got a hold on me  
Hijack my heart
