This is where we are today  
People going separate ways  
This is the way things are now  
In disarray  
I read it in the papers  
Theres death on every page  
Oh Lord I thank the Lord above  
My life has been saved eaah eah  
  
Here we go  
Tellin lies  
Here we go  here we go  
  
Were right back where we started from  
People going separate ways  
This is the way things are now  
In disarray  hey  
I read it in the papers  
Theres death on every page  
Aah  oh Lord I thank you from above  
My life has been saved  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh my life  
My life has been saved  
Ooh my life  
My life has been saved
