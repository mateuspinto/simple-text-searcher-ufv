Well youre just seventeen  all you wanna do is disappear  
You know what I mean theres a lot of space  
Between your ears  
The way that you touch dont feel nu nu nothin  
Hey hey hey hey it was the DNA  
Hey hey hey hey that made me this way  
Do you know do you know do you know just how I feel   
Do you know do you know do you know just how I feel   
  
Sheer heart attack  
Sheer heart attack  
Real cardiac  
  
I feel so inar inar inar inar inar inar inar inar  ticulate  
  
Gotta feelin gotta feelin gotta feelin like a paralyse  
It aint no it aint no it aint no it aint no surprise  
Turn on the TV let it drip right down in your eyes  
Hey hey hey hey it was the DNA  
Hey hey hey hey hey that made me this way  
Do you know do you know do you know just how I feel   
Do you know do you know do you know just how I feel

Do you know do you know do you know do you know just how I feel
