Ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Youre taking all the sunshine away  
Making out like youre the main line I knew that  
Cause youre a cool cat  
Tapping on the toe with a new hat  
Ooh just cruising  
Driving along like the swing king  
Feeling the beat of my heart huh  
Feeling the beat of my heart  
  
Ooh youre a cool cat  
Coming on strong with all the chit chat  
Ooh youre alright  
Hanging out and stealing all the limelight  
Ooh messing with the beat of my heart yeah  
  
Ooh you used to be a mean kid  
Ooh making such a deal of life  
Ooh you were wishing and hoping and waiting  
To really hit the big time  
But did it happen Happen no  
Youre speeding too fast slow down  
Slow down youd better slow down slow down  
  
You really know how to set the mood  
And you really get inside the groove  
Cool cat tapping on the toe with a new hat  
Ooh just cruising  
Driving along like the swing king  
Feeling the beat of my heart  
Feeling the beat of my heart yeah  
Feeling the beat of my heart  
Can you feel it  
Feeling the beat of my heart  
Feeling the beat of my heart  
Ooh feeling feeling feeling  
Feeling every feeling
