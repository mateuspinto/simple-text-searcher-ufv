I can see it in your stars  
Life is so exciting  
Acting so bizarre  
Your world is so inviting  
Playing really cool  
And looking so mysterious  honey  
Your every day is full of sunshine  
But into every life a little rain must fall  
No problem  
Uh be cool now  
  
Anyone who imagines  
They can blind you with science  
Bully you all over  
With property and finance  
But you have position  
To call the shots and name the price  honey  
You found success and recognition  
But into every life a little rain must fall  
Flow John  
  
You lead a fairy tale existence  
But into every life a little rain must fall  
Be cool ha kiss kiss  
  
Others seem to think  
You are over dramatizing  
Problems at work  
So its hardly surprising  
Theres little you can do  
To alter their opinions  honey  
You want a clean reputation  
But now youre facing complications  
Cos into every life a little rain must fall  
Be cool get serious wooh alright  
  
Play it nice and cool  
Play it nice and cool  yeah  
Chase me  
Ooh one more time ha ha I like it  
Leave em there
