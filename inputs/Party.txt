We had a good night jamming away  
There was a full moon showing  
And we started to play  
But in the cold light of day next morning  
Party was over  huh  
The party was over  
We got love and we got style  
And we got sex and I know I know we got what it takes  
Woah woah woah woah woah  
Woah woah woah

Come back and play  hey hey  come back and play

Come back and play come back and play play play play aah

Yeah  ha ha ha ha haaa  give it give it  
We had a food fight in somebodys face  
We were up all night singing  singin  
And giving a chase  
But in the cold light of day next morning  
Everybody was hungover  
Hey come back and play come back and play come back and play  
We got all night all day  
Everybodys gone away

Goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye the party is over
