Ooh ooh pain is so close to pleasure oh yeah  
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life  
Ooh ooh pain is so close to pleasure everybody knows  
One day we love each other then were fighting one another all the time  
When I was young and just getting started  
And people talked to me they sounded broken hearted  
Then I grew up and got my imagination  
And all I wanted was to start a new relation  
So in love but love had a bad reaction  
I was looking for some good old satisfaction  
But pain is all I got when all I needed was some love and affection  
Ooh ooh pain is so close to pleasure yeah yeah  
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life  
Pain and pleasure  
Ooh ooh pain and pleasure  
  
When your plans go wrong  you turn out the light  
But inside of your mind you put up a fight  
Where are the answers that were all searching for  
Theres nothing in this world to be sure of anymore  
Some days youre feeling good some days youre feeling bad  
But if youre feeling happy someone else is always sad  
Let the sweetness on love wipe the tears from your face  
For better for worse so lets make the best of the rest of our years  
Ooh ooh pain is so close to pleasure I told you so  
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life  
Pain and pleasure ooh ooh pain is so close to pleasure yeah yeah  
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life  
All your life  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Pain  pleasure  pain  pleasure  pain  pleasure  pain  pleasure
