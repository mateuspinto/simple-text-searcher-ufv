Aaah ooh ooh ah ooh ah  
Leave it in the lap of the Gods  
  
I live my life for you  
Think all my thoughts with you and only you  
Anything you ask I do for you  
  
I touch your lips with mine  
But in the end  
I leave it to the lords  
Leave it in the lap of the Gods  
What more can I do   
  
Leave it in the lap of the Gods  
I leave it to you  
Leave it in the lap of the Gods  
Leave it in the lap of the Gods  
I want you to aah  
Leave it in the lap of the Gods  
Leave it in the lap of the Gods aah  
Leave it in the lap of the Gods  
Lap of the Gods  
Lap of the Gods aah  
Lap of the Gods aah  
Lap of the Gods  
Lap of the Gods  
Lap of the Gods  
Lap of the Gods
