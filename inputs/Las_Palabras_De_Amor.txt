Guilt stains on my pillow  
Blood on ny terraces  
Torsos in my closet  
Shadows from my past live is real  
Life is real life is real so real  
Sleeping is my leisure  
Waking up in a minefield  
Dream is just a pleasure dome  
Love is a roulette wheel  life is real  
Life is real life is real oh yeah  
Success is my breathing space  
I brought it on myself  
I will price it  
I will cash it  
I can take it or leave it  
Loneliness is my hiding place  
Breastfeeding myself  
What more can I say  
I have swallowed the bitter pill  
I can taste it I can taste it  
Life is real life is real life is real  
Music will be my mistres  
Loving like a whore  
Lennon is a genius  
Living in every pore  
Life is real life is real life is real so real  
Life is cruel  
Life is a bitch  
Life is real  so real
