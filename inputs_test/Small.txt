I like to sit here in the sunshine  
Trees in the fields are green sublime  
Suspended in time  
And dont it make you feel small  
I like to sit here by the fires light  
The trees in the fields lie bare to the night  
The stars burn bright  
And dont it make you feel small  
Everyone needs a place they can hide  
Hide away find a space to be alone  
Everyone needs a place they can hide  
Everyone needs to find peace sublime  
I like to sit here in the autumn time  
The trees in the fields they rustle in the wind  
The church bells gently chime  
Gentle on your mind suspended in time  
And dont it make you feel small  
Everyone needs a place they can hide  
Everyone need to find peace sublime  
Oh peace of mind  
Everyone needs a place they can hide  
Hide away find a space to be alone  
Everyone needs a place they can hide  
Hide away find a space to be alone  
Everyone needs a place they can hide  
Hide away find a space to be alone  
Everyone needs a place they can hide  
Everyone needs to find peace sublime  
Oh peace of mind
