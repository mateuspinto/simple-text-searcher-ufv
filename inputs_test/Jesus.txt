And then I saw Him in the crowd  
A lot of people had gathered round Him  
The beggars shouted the lepers called Him  
The old man said nothing  
He just stared about him  
All going down to see the Lord Jesus  
All going down to see the Lord Jesus  
All going down  
  
Then came a man before His feet he fell  
Unclean said the leper and rang his bell  
Felt the palm of a hand touch his head  
Go now go now youre a new man instead  
All going down to see the Lord Jesus  
All going down to see the Lord Jesus  
All going down  
  
It all began with the three wise men  
Followed a star took them to Bethlehem  
And made it heard throughout the land  
Born was a leader of man  
All going down to see the Lord Jesus  
All going down to see the Lord Jesus  
All going down  
  
It all began with the three wise men  
Followed a star took them to Bethlehem  
And made it heard throughout the land  
Born was a leader of man  
All going down to see the Lord Jesus  
All going down to see the Lord Jesus  
All going down
