Call me if you need my love  
Call me if you need my love  
Call me if you need my love  
Call me if you need my love  
Call me if you need my love  
Call me if you need my love  
She lives in a luxury apartment  
In the heart of town  
I live in the country  
And my house is tumbling down  
Call me if you need my love  
Call me if you need my love  
Call me if you need my love  
Call me if you need my love  
I met her in her neighborhood  
I was just passing through  
One look was all it took  
Yeah one look or two  
Call me if you need my love  
Call me if you need my love  
Call me if you need my love  
Call me if you need my love  
You got my name  
You got my number  
You got my number  
You got my name  
Have mercy  
Now Im gonna settle down  
Get myself a wife or two  
No more of this running around  
Like I used to do  
Call me if you need my love baby  
Call me if you need my love  
Call me if you need my love baby  
Call me if you need my love  
Call me if you need my love baby  
Call me if you need my love  
Call me if you need my love baby  
Call me if you need my love
