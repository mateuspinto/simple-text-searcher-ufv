I shoulda known better  
Nothing lasts forever  
  
It all started out in a tan Dodge van  
Two hundred bucks that we stole from her dad  
Out the back of his meth lab  
Took the 45 out demand that  
  
Livid Bonnie bout to be a mommy  
Came to California with Johnny  
They had a run in with the law  
She shoulda listened to her ma  
  
And she said wed be together  
She said  
She used the word Forever  
She said  
  
Oh my lovely lover  
She said  
Why had I love to love her  
I I shoulda known better  
Nothing lasts forever yeah lasts forever  
  
I shoulda known better  
Ooh better  
I shoulda known better  
Ooh better  
I shoulda known  
  
Abortion clinic I shoulda forced the issue  
But she did it with the hanger and some tissue  
Dont cry dry your eye  
She said  
Ill be back on my feet tonight  
She said  
  
Ill be walking the street tonight  
She said  
Cause these arms gotta eat tonight  
Then we made love like a couple of drunk buffalo  
Was I rough enough  
  
It was the last time Id ever see her  
Id try to thank her with gonorrhea  
But then she split and stole my sweater  
Dude I shoulda known better  
  
I I shoulda known better  
Nothing lasts forever yeah lasts forever  
Shoulda known better  
  
Shoulda ended in the tan Dodge van  
With two hundred dollars worth of partying  
But instead Im sitting on Sunset  
Selling my soul for a hit yeah what next  
  
Yeah I shoulda known better  
Nothing lasts forever yeah lasts forever  
When you said youd never leave and wed be together  
Nothing lasts forever nothing ever lasts forever  
  
Shoulda known better  
Ooh better  
I shoulda known better  
Ooh better  
  
I shoulda known better  
Ooh better  
I shoulda known better  
Ooh better  
I shoulda known
