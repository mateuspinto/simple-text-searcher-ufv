Like a sunset on a hot summer night like making up after our first big fight  
Wind swept hair when the moons just right  
Ohh your a perfect sight  
Come on baby let me take that wheel  
Im ready to show you how I fell  
If waht Im dreaming might be real  
Then I dont wanna waste time I just wanna make you mine  
Sure feels like love sure feels like the right thing baby  
Aint got no ifs no ands no doubts no maybes  
Well I knew at once when I looked in your eyes I had the answer before  
You said goodnight love  
Sure feels like love tonight  
  
Music For six seconds  
  
Your oh so sweet just my luck  
Like a extra marshmellow in my cocoa cup  
Oh no I can never get enough  
I wonder if you realize dont need a crown to be my king your already my
Everything  
The words I write and the songs I sing  
The lullaby here inside the melody I cant deny  
Sure feels like love sure feels like the right thing baby  
Aint got no ifs no ands no doubts no maybes  
Well I knew at once when I looked in your eyes I had the answer before  
You said goodnight love  
Sure feels like love tonight  
  
Music For seven seconds  
  
My whole worlds turnin upside down  
Standing still on a merry go round  
Sure feels like love sure feels like the right thing baby  
Aint got no ifs no ands no doubts no maybes  
Well I knew at once when I looked in your eyes I had the answer before  
You said goodnight love  
Sure feels like love sure feels like the right thing baby  
Sure feels like love sure feels like the right thing baby  
Sure feels like love tonight  
Sure feels like love
