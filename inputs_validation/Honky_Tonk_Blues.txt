Well I left my home down on a rural route  
And I told my folks Im goin steppin out  
To get the honky tonk blues the jumpin honky tonk blues  
Well Lord I got em I got the honky tonk blues  
In and out of every joint in this town  
The city life has really got me down  
I got the honky tonk blues the honky tonk blues  
Well Lord I got em I got the honky tonk blues  
 guitar   
Im gonna slap my boogie underneath my arm  
Scud right back in my pappys farm  
And lose these honky tonk blues the jumpin honky tonk blues  
Well Lord I got em I got the honky tonk blues  
 steel   
Well I left my home down on a rural route
