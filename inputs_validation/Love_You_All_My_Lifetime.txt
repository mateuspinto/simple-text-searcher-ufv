Cold endless summer days  
Since you went away  
Tore my heart in two  
And now wandering through the night  
I see the city lights  
Feelin so in need  
Ill never be at peace  
  
Chorus  
Love you all my lifetime  
Lost to you eternally  
Everything in my life  
Tells me we were meant to be  
  
Strange theres always something wrong  
Dreams dont last that long  
What part did I play in that game  
And now now you turn away  
Excuses are too late  
Feelin so in need Ill never be at peace  
  
Chorus  
  
You make the rain and the night go away  
You make the sun rise up in my sky  
You make the rain and the night go away  
You make the sun rise up in my sky
