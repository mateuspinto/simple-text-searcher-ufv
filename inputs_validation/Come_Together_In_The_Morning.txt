It makes me sad to think of you  
Because I understand the things you do  
There is no one else can take your place  
In my life alone I hide my face  
  
Come together in the morning  
I can understand your mind  
Come together in the morning  
See the world the same as me  
  
There was a time its in the past  
I thought our love was born to last  
But now you say you are torn in two  
Thats what my love has done for you  
  
Come together in the morning  
I can understand your mind  
Come together in the morning  
See the world the same as me  
  
Come together in the morning  
I can understand your mind  
Come together in the morning  
See the world the same as me  
  
It makes me sad to think of you  
Because I understand the things you do  
There is no one else can take your place  
In my life alone I hide my face
