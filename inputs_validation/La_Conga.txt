In Havana every Cubana shakes her bandana to the La Conga  
Its a new dance something new to dance  
Wait till you dance to the La Conga  
  
Wait till you hear the beat of the bonga  
Just get that beat and you get the Conga  
It delights you and it excites you and it invites you to do the La Conga  
  
In Buenos Aires and London and Paris they Tango  
In old Vienna their favorite has long been a waltz  
In Wiakill in Madrid and Seville they Fandango  
But in Havana all the maidens go 1 2 3 Boom  
1 2 3 boom 1 2 3 boom 1 2 3 boom  
  
In Havavana every Cubana shakes her bandana to the La Conga  
Its a new dance something new to dance  
Wait till you dance to the La Conga  
  
The La Congof the Bonga ya da da get the Conga  
Do ya ralla do ya ralla ralla da do do do Conga  
It delights you and it excites you and it invites you to do the La Conga  
  
Conga Conga  
Now you know the La Conga Dance Break  
1 2 3 boom Dance Break  
  
Conga Conga Conga  
Now you know the Conga Conga Boom
