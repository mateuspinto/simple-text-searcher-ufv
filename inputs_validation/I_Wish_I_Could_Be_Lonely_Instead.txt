I should have kissed you  
One last time  
I would have held you  
So much Langer  
If Id known itd be the last time  
If I could forget you  
It would make all these memories fade to grey  
Id rather not remember what I foolishly traded  
  
I think I might be missing you  
Like you said I would  
I think I might have run away  
Im a fool yeah Im a fool  
Think I meant I love you  
I said that I dont care  
Wish I could be lonely instead  
  
I should have loved you  
More than I did  
Living without you  
With your ghost and voice haunting my head  
  
I couldnt see you  
And now I see you everyday  
But not with me  
She seems so nice  
She makes you smile  
Like you use to smile at me  
  
I think I might be missing you  
Like you said I would  
I think I might have run away  
Im a fool yeah Im a fool  
Think I meant I love you  
I said that I dont care  
Wish I was just lonely instead  
  
You were right  
Im lying here  
Wishing you were with me  
Hoping that you might be  
Missing me  
Cause I cant seem to fight it honey  
Wish I could erase every part of you ad me  
  
I think I might be missing you  
Like you said I would  
I think I might have run away  
Im a fool yeah Im a fool  
Think I meant I love you  
I said that I dont care  
Wish I could be lonely instead  
I wish I was just lonely instead
