When I lost my baby I almost lost my mind  
When I lost my baby I almost lost my mind  
My head is in a spin since she left me behind  
I pass a million people I cant tell who I meet  
I pass a million people dont know tell who I meet  
Cause my eyes are full of tears where can my baby be make it son  
I went to see a gypsy and I had my fortune read  
I went to see a gypsy had my fortune read  
Then I hung my head in sorrow when she said what she said what she said
honey  
Now I can tell you people the news was not so good  
Now I can you people the news was not so good  
She said your babys done and quit you this time shes gone for good
