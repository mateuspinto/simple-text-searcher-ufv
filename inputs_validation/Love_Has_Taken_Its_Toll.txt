Some girls you meet seem so complete  
Like they dont need nothin from you  
Theyre out to show you they dont want to know you  
When deep inside they do  
  
Well this girl didnt want me or anyone else  
She was alone thought Id give it a try  
I was a young bull stompin in the field  
I saw red when she walked by  
  
Love has taken its toll love has  
Love has taken taken its toll oh yeah  
  
I had to think fast I watched her walk past  
I knew I would have my way  
So I swaggered up I mean I staggered up  
But I didnt have a damn thing to say  
  
Now two handed strategy always works well for me  
So I slipped my hands around her waist  
I swore it was the right move feelin so smooth  
Till she backhanded me cross my face  
  
Love has taken its toll love has  
Love has taken taken its toll oh yeah  
  
To make a long story short she finally got caught  
I had to tell her enough is enough  
She said Youre just what I needed and boy  
She nearly pleaded with me not to be too rough  
  
Love has taken its toll love has  
Love has taken taken its toll oh yeah  
  
Love has taken taken its toll love has  
Love has taken taken its toll oh yeah  
  
Love has taken taken its toll love has  
Love has taken taken its toll oh yeah
