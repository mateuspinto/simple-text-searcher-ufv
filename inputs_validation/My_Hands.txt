My hands were made to worship you my  
heart my king it beats for you  
  
Pre chorus  
O lamb so true I surrender to you  
  
Chorus  
my life  
I give you  
my love  
I give you  
my all  
  
Verse two  
your touch your kiss your grace to me is deeper  
than my soul can see my purpose it changed  
When I called out your name  
  
Pre chorus  
my life  
I give you  
my love  
I give you  
my all  
  
Bridge  
my past has been erased with just one touch from  
you my clouds my rain my faith has changed your blood  
has made me new o lamb so true I surrender to  
  
Chorus  
my life  
I give you  
my love  
I give you  
my all
