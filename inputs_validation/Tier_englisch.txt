What does a man do  
What does a man do  
Who cant tell the difference  
Between human and animal  
What  
  
He will go to his daughter  
She is beautiful and young  
And then like a dog will  
Mate with his own flesh and blood  
  
What do you do  
What do you feel  
What are you  
But only a  
Animal  
  
What does a woman do  
What does a woman do  
Who cant tell the difference  
Between animal and man  
  
She dips the feather in his blood  
And write herself a letter  
Lifeless lines to childhood  
When her father slept by her  
  
What do you do  
What do you feel  
What are you  
But only a Animal
