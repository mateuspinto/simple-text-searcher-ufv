Starry starry night  
Paint your palette blue and grey  
Look out on a summers day  
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul  
Shadows on the hills  
Sketch the trees and daffodils  
Catch the breeze and the winter chills  
In colours on the snowy linen land  
  
Now I understand  
What you tried to say to me  
And how you suffered for your sanity  
And how you tried to set them free  
They would not listen  
They did not know how  
Perhaps theyll listen now  
  
Starry starry night  
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze  
Swirling clouds and violet haze  
Reflect in vincents eyes of china blue  
Colours changing hue  
Morning fields of amber grain  
Weathered faces lined in pain  
Are soothed beneath the artists loving hand  
  
Now I understand  
What you tried to say to me  
And how you suffered for your sanity  
And how you tried to set them free  
They would not listen  
They did not know how  
Perhaps theyll listen now  
  
For they could not love you  
But still your love was true  
And when no hope was left inside  
On that starry starry night  
You took your life as lovers often do  
But I could have told you vincent  
This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you  
  
Like the strangers that youve met  
The ragged men in ragged clothes  
The silver thorn of bloody rose  
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow  
  
Now I think I know  
What you tried to say to me  
And how you suffered for your sanity  
And how you tried to set them free  
They would not listen  
Theyre not listening still  
Perhaps they never will
