Divorced beheaded and died  
Divorced beheaded survived  
Im Henry VIII I had six sorry wives  
Some might say I ruined their lives  
  
Catherine of Aragon was one  
She failed to give me a son  
I had to ask her for a divorce  
That broke her poor heart of course  
  
Young Anne Boleyn she was two  
had a daughter the best she could do  
I said she flirted with some other man  
And off for the chop went dear Anne  
  
Lovely Jane Seymour was three  
The love of a lifetime for me  
She gave me a son little Prince Ed  
Then poor old Jane went and dropped dead  
  
Divorced beheaded and died  
Divorced beheaded survived  
Im Henry VIII I had six sorry wives  
Some might say I ruined their lives  
  
Anne of Cleves came as four  
I fell for the portrait I saw  
Then laid on her face and cried Shes a horse I must have another divorce  
  
Catherine Howard was five  
A child of nineteen so alive  
She flirted with others no way to behave  
The axe sent young Cath to her grave  
  
Catherine Parr she was last  
By then all my best days were past  
I lay on my deathbed aged just fiftyfive  
Lucky Catherine the last stayed alive  
I mean how unfair  
  
Divorced beheaded and died  
Divorced beheaded survived  
Im Henry VIII I had six sorry wives  
You could say I ruined their lives
