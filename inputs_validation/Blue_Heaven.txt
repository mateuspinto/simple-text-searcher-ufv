Alligators snap at your ankles  
And branches snap at your brain  
If I ever get through this swamp alive  
Ill nevermore pray for rain  
This must be the place  
And still it somehow dont seem right  
Something in the moon could change  
These endless days to lonely nights  
I take a stroll down by the sea  
And walk along the pier  
Then I slip and hit my head  
Nows the time to fear  
I see the surface see the rocks  
See my past fly swiftly by  
I feel the water in my lungs  
And wake up screaming for my life  
In my blue heaven  
Theres a bottle of Pontchartrain  
Chalmette by moonlight  
To take away the pain  
Card sharks and blue harps  
And dolphins who leap  
In my blue heaven  
Where I can laugh and I can weep  
Black shapes zip into corners  
The big lads start to crawl  
To holes of their own making  
In the cracks within the wall  
Snakes and rats and spiders  
I know that theyre still there  
I pray to God that I may sleep  
Without a hope without a care  
In my blue heaven  
Theres a bottle of Pontchartrain  
Chalmette by moonlight  
To take away the pain  
Felines and sea lions  
And rain on the beach  
In my blue heaven  
With angels who arent out of reach  
In my blue heaven  
Theres a bottle of Pontchartrain  
Chalmette by moonlight  
To take away the pain  
Nightingales sing  
And the bells they will ring  
In my blue heaven  
The bells of Hell  
Go ding a ling a ling
