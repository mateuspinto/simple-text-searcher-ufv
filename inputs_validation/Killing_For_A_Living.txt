A sense of peace was falling on the universal night  
And it gave me a pause to reason why I live  
To never cease the calling of the consequential right  
And it gave me cause and reason why they give  
The first thing I remember was the shadow cross my heart  
And they matched the beauty hidden in their soul  
  
The next was cross the universe as it came apart  
And the sum of the parts became whole  
  
Stalking and hunting profession in blood  
Working the night to a throne  
Chalking an outline experience must  
Invisible never alone  
  
I can take you anywhere  
Take all that you give  
I can free you from despair  
Killing just to live  
  
Live to kill  
Kill to live  
Killing for a living killing just to live  
  
I looked across the answers though questions didnt exist  
And found that I was never alone  
We cut away the cancer and continued to resist  
But the outcome of the night remained unknown  
The next thing I remember were the years across my face  
And they matched only the beauty of scars  
The next was cross the universe into time and space  
And to know together wed have to go too far  
  
Bleeding a nation casualty time  
Breaking the back of the core  
Promised salvation a casual crime  
Feeding and fucking the whore  
Make my living on borrowed time  
I make the clock stand still  
Keep my hands round what is mine  
Living just to kill  
Live to kill  
Kill to live  
  
Cmon now kill a little kindness give the worst of your best  
Cmon now and shake a little madness put the dead to rest  
I can give you reasons 25 to the bone  
They can give you all you ever wanted  
When youre far away from home  
Cmon now kill a little kindness give the worst of your best  
Cmon now and shake a little madness put the dead to rest  
  
So as the plot will thicken and time is not a friend  
The blessing comes but one in a life  
Across the crowded universe that hastens to an end  
Through memories of one time in a night  
And what will I remember through the by and by  
To have and hold and turn about the chill  
That this was not the pause to die  
But to live to kill
