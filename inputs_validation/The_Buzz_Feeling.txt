And your eyes shutting fe you head would of blow off  
Like a car engine most people in the dance dem start laughing  
Some of them cannot explain mysterious feeling so you sit on de stair  
Gaze pon de ceiling you hand pon you belly  
You start fe rubbing a little after that you a little vomiting  
So you run down the stairs like a streak of lightening you move  
Through the crowd like you hustling you brethen  
Shout you start reasoning about thing and time and the flat  
Him move in the operatir play a tune them start bubbling  
It make it even harder fe you passing as you reach out side start  
Slow breathing you sit pon de wall and start thinking never again  
Would I get that feeling dread

Start crave fe dumpling
