Only yesterday they told me you were gone  
All these normal people will I find another one  
Monkey on my back aching in my bones  
I forgot you said One day youll walk alone  
I said I need you does that make me wrong  
Am I a weak man are you feeling strong  
My heart was blackened its bloody red  
A hole in my heart a hole in my head  
Who will help me up  
Wheres the helping hand  
Will you turn on me  
Is this my final stand  
In a dream I cannot see  
Tangled abstract fallacy  
Random turmoil builds in me  
Im addicted to chaos  
Light shined on my path  
Turn bad days into good  
Turn breakdowns into blocks I smashed em cause I could  
My brain was labored my head would spin  
Dont let me down dont give up dont give in  
The rain comes down cold wind blows  
The plans we made are back up on the road  
Turn up my collar welcome the unknown  
Remember that you said  
One day youll walk alone
