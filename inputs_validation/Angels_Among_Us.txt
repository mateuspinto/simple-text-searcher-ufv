I was walking home from school on a cold winter day  
Took a shortcut through the woods and I lost my way  
It was getting late and I was scared and alone  
Then a kind old man took my hand and led me home  
  
Mama couldnt see him  
But he was standing there  
And I knew in my heart  
He was the answer to my prayers  
  
Oh I believe there are angels among us  
Sent down to us from somewhere up above  
They come to you and me in our darkest hour  
To show us how to live to teach us how to give  
To guide us with a light of love  
  
When life held troubled times and had me down on my knees  
Theres always been someone there to come along and comfort me  
A kind word from a stranger to lend a helping hand  
A phone call from a friend just to say I understand  
  
And aint it kind of funny that at the dark end of the road  
Someone lights the way with just a single ray of hope  
Oh I believe there are angels among us  
Sent down to us from somewhere up above  
They come to you and me in our darkest hour  
To show us how to live to teach us how to give  
To guide us with a light of love  
  
They wear so many faces  
Show up in the strangest places  
To guide us with their mercy  
In our time of need  
  
Oh I believe there are angels among us  
Sent down to us from somewhere up above  
They come to you and me in our darkest hour  
To show us how to live to teach us how to give  
To guide us with a light of love
