Outside the house Mr Simpson announced  
That Sally couldnt go to the meeting  
He went on cleaning his blue Rolls Royce  
And she ran inside weeping  
She got to her room and tears splashed the picture  
Of the new Messiah  
She picked up the book of her fathers life  
And threw it on the fire  
  
Chorus  
She knew from the start  
Deep down in her heart  
That she and Tommy were worlds apart  
But her mother said Never mind your part  
Is to be what youll be  
  
The theme of the sermon was Come unto me  
Love will find a way  
So Sally decided to ignore her dad  
And sneak out anyway  
She spent all afternoon getting ready  
And decided shed try to touch him  
Maybe hed see that she was free  
And talk to her this Sunday  
  
Chorus  
  
She arrived at six and the place was swinging  
To gospel music by nine  
Group after group appeared on the stage  
And Sally just sat there crying  
She bit her nails looking pretty as a picture  
Right in the very front row  
And then a DJ wearing a blazer with a badge  
Ran on and said Here we go  
  
The crowd went crazy  
As Tommy hit the stage  
Little Sally got lost as the police bossed  
The crowd back in a rage  
  
But soon the atmosphere was cooler  
As Tommy gave a lesson  
Sally just had to let him know she loved him  
And leapt up on the rostrum  
She ran cross stage to the spotlit figure  
And touched him on the face  
Tommy whirled around as a uniformed man  
Threw her off the stage  
  
Chorus  
  
Her cheek hit a chair and blood trickled down  
Mingling with her tears  
Tommy carried on preaching  
And his voice filled Sallys ears  
She caught his eye she had to try  
But couldnt see through their lights  
Her face was gashed and the ambulance men  
Had to carry her out that night  
  
The crowd went crazy  
As Tommy left the stage  
Little Sally was lost for the price of a touch  
And a gash across her face oh  
  
Sixteen stitches put her right and her dad said  
Dont say I didnt warn you  
Sally got married to a rock musician  
She met in California  
Tommy always talks about the day  
The disciples all went wild  
Sally still carries a scar on her cheek  
To remind her of his smile  
  
Chorus
