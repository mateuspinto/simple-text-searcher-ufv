I heard that you were drunk and mean  
Down at  
The dairy queen  
Now theres just enough of you in me  
For me to have  
This sympathy  
And take it in stride  
I know I had mine  
And you were as kind  
I am told  
  
Aint it funny how we lose one day  
And a lifetime  
Slips away  
Im looking back on us that way  
Something I  
I never thought Id say  
I take it in stride  
I know I had mine  
It was good for a time  
I am told  
It was good for a time I am told  
  
The love you gave was not for free  
But the price  
Was truly fair  
I never felt so glad to be  
So well spent  
So beyond repair  
And I take it in stride  
At least you were mine  
If not for all time  
Enough to hold  
Oh at least  
Enough for me  
To hold you  
  
Now take good care that you are true  
You said you found it  
Hard to do  
And find that bit of faith that sets you free  
From having everything to prove  
And you take it in stride  
And know youve got mine  
And its good for a lifetime  
Or more  
Hey I love  
I love you  
More and more  
  
Oh I love you more and more  
Yeah
