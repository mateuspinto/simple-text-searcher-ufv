I will you to me like a river  
Wash away all the war paint from your face  
I want you to be happy  
I want you to be safe  
I waited for you like a lion  
Lay you down  
Weigh me down  
You make my limbs ache  
I want you to be near me  
I want you to escape  
So much closer to me  
So much closer to me  
So much closer to me  
Closer  
Summertime in the heat  
Summer dive in the sheets  
Waterslide into me  
Come closer  
My bodys holding you for ransom  
Gotta make it happen  
Honeys gotta get paid  
I want you at an angle  
I want you face to face  
You burn like motorcycle blue  
I love the way you do it  
Like it down the freeway  
I need you like confession  
I need you like a faith  
So much closer to me  
So much closer to me  
So much closer to me  
Closer  
Summertime in the heat  
Summer dive in the sheets  
Waterslide into me  
Come closer  
Hey  
Hey  
Hey  
Hey
