Little heroes go down  
The drain day by day  
Future leaders they go down  
The drains day by day  
They cry so loud yeah  
But the whole world  
Is not listening  
Only you mothers of the world  
Can save the children  
There s a lot of things  
To be legalised yeah  
But abortion is not an  
Important thing here  
  
How can you have a face  
Of an angel  
And let the devil insideof you  
Take control  
We tired of hearing these  
Little voices crying out  
From far away saying  
  
Chorus  
Mama why do you  
Destroy me  
Mama what have I done  
To you  
I deserve to live like  
Anybody else  
We all come in this world  
Not knowing where we gonna go  
We all come in this world  
Not knowing where life is  
Gonna take us  
  
Give them a chance in life  
We re all taking our changes here  
Life life life the greatest gift of all  
I see the government officials  
Sitting around a table  
There s a law they gonna pass  
Only you the mothers of  
The world can save the children  
  
Women s leagues  
All over the world  
Fighting for women s liberation  
But who fights for  
The children s liberation  
We are tired of hearing  
These little voices saying  
  
Chorus till fade
