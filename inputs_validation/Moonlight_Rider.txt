Hey just for one last time  
Ill sing my song just like I did before  
When we were all young  
Can you still recall how it was sung  
  
The songs are only rhymes  
Life dont turn out  
The way we thought it would  
When we were all young  
Used to love to hear them love songs sung  
  
I was the moonlight rider  
Id ride out on a sea of dreams  
Far away long ago so it seems  
Wont you take  
That moonlight ride with me  
  
Well just for one last time  
Ill sing my song just like I did before  
Maybe youll sing along  
Do you still recall that moonlight song  
  
I am the moonlight rider  
Im riding on a sea of dreams  
Far away long ago so it seems  
Wont you take  
That moonlight ride with me
