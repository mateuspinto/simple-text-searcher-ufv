Always be careful  
When you abuse the one you love  
The hour or the day no one can tell  
But one day goodbye will be farewell  
And you will never see the one you love again  
You will never see the one you love again  
  
I have been thinking what with my final brain cell  
How time grips you slimming in its spell  
And before you know goodbye will be farewell  
And you will never see the one you love again  
And the smiling children tell you that you smell  
  
Well just look at me  
A savage Beast with nothing to sell  
And when I die I want to go to Hell  
And thats when goodbye should be farewell  
One day goodbye will be farewell  
So grab me while you still can goodbye
