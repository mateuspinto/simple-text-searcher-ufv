Stupid on the Steinway  
So sick upon a Steinway  
The sailors drown  
  
See them talk and see them drown  
And see them drink and fall around  
Upon the floor  
  
Sister of mine home again  
Sister of mine home again  
  
Lonely in a crowded room  
The radio plays out of tune  
So silently  
  
The radio upon the floor  
Is stupid it plays aznavour  
So out of key  
  
Sister of mine home again  
Sister of mine home again  
  
Broken on a ship of fools  
Even dreams must fall to rules  
So stupidly  
  
Words are all just useless sound  
Just like cards they fall around  
And we will be  
  
Sister of mine home again  
Sister of mine home again  
  
Buy a car and watch it rust  
Sister see them fall to dust  
They fall around  
  
In another crowded room  
Paint me like the shirt Im in  
Honestly  
  
Sister of mine home again  
Sister of mine home again  
  
Sister of mine  
Sister of mine  
Sister of mine  
Sister of mine  
Sister
