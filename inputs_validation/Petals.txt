Ive often wondered if theres  
Ever been a perfect family  
Ive always longed for undividedness  
And sought stability  
  
A flower taught me how to pray  
But as I grew that flower changed  
She started failing in the wind  
Like golden petals scattering  
  
And I miss you dandelion  
And even love you  
And I wish there was a way  
For me to trust you  
But it hurts me every time  
I try to touch you  
  
But I miss you dandelion  
And even love you  
  
I gravitated towards a patriarch  
So young predictably  
I was resigned to spend my life  
With a maze of misery  
  
A boy and a girl befriended me  
Were bonded through despondency  
I stayed so long but finally  
I fled to save my sanity  
  
And I miss you little sis and  
Little brother  
And I hope you realize  
Ill always love you  
Always love you  
And although youre struggling  
You will recover  
Were gonna make it maybe  
And I miss you little sis and  
Little brother  
  
So many I considered  
Closest to me  
Turned on a dime and sold me  
Out dutifully  
Although that knife was chipping  
Away at me  
They turned their eyes away and  
Went home to sleep  
Sleep  
Sleep  
Sleep  
  
And I missed a lot of life  
But Ill recover  
Though I know you really like  
To see me suffer  
Still I wish that you and Id  
Forgive each other  
Cause I miss you Valentine  
And really loved you  
  
I really loved you  
I guess I loved you  
I tried so hard  
But you drove me away  
To preserve my sanity  
  
And I found the strength to break away  
Do do do do do  
Do do do do do do do do  
Fly
