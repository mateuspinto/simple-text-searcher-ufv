Tears will fall  
Its better to have loved than not at all  
Or so they say  
  
Always and Forever  
I dont regret a single day  
With you  
Always and Forever  
  
Tears will fall  
Its better to have loved than not at all  
Or so they say  
  
Always and Forever  
I dont regret a single day  
With you  
Always and Forever  
  
Night and Day  
Say goodbye then slowly fade away  
Like lovers do  
  
Always and Forever  
Theres a place within my heart  
I keep for you  
Oh I keep for you
