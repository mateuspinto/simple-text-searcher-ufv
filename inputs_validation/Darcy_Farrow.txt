Where the walker runs down to the Carson Valley Plain  
There lived a maiden Darcy Farrow was her name  
The daughter of old Dundee and a fair one was she  
The sweetest flower that bloomed oer the range  
  
Her voice was as sweet as the sugar candy  
Her touch was as soft as a bed of goose down  
Her eyes shone bright like the pretty lights  
That shone in the night out of Yerrington town  
  
She was courted by Young Vandamere  
A fine lad was he as I am to hear  
He gave her silver rings and lacy things  
And she promised to wed before the snows came that year  
  
But her pony did stumble and she did fall  
Her dyin touched the hearts of us one and all  
Young Vandy in his pain put a bullet through his brain  
And we buried them together as the snows began to fall  
  
They sing of Darcy Farrow where the Truckee runs through  
They sing of her beauty in Virginia City too  
At dusky sundown to her name they drink a round  
And to young Vandy whose love was true
