Sounds like a scene from the silver screen  
Yeah thats how it was  
Love doenst always look like a picture perfect storybook  
Ah but sometimes it does  
  
Standing beside her the stars shined even brighter  
And for a moment all the world was all the world was still  
I knew we belonged together the moment my eyes met hers  
And I thought nothing last forever but maybe this one will  
  
A deep breath and baby steps  
thats how the whole thing starts  
Its a long slow beautiful dance  
To the beat of a heart  
  
The world starts to spin again you learn things you didnt know then  
Feels like the bloom is off the rose  
But you weather a few storms and you pull out a few thorns  
And together the garden grows and grows  
  
A deep breath and baby steps  
thats how the whole thing starts  
Its a long slow beautiful dance  
To the beat of a heart  
  
Its a long slow beautiful dance  
  
The house is filled with so much love  
We got more than enough for two  
So weve been thinking about having a baby  
I know it sounds crazy but it seems like the natural thing to do  
  
A deep breath and baby steps  
thats how the whole thing starts  
Its a long slow beautiful dance  
To the beat of a heart  
  
Its a long slow  
Its a long slow  
Its a long slow
