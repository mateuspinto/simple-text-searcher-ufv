He rocks in the tree tops all day long  
Hoppin and aboppin and singing his song  
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street  
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet  
  
Chorus  
Rockin robin rock rock  
Rockin robin  
Blow rockin robin  
Cause were really gonna rock tonight  
  
Every little swallow every chickadee  
Every little bird in the tall oak tree  
The wise old owl the big black crow  
Flappin their wings singing go bird go  
  
Chorus  
  
Pretty little raven at the birdband stand  
Told them how to do the bob and it was grand  
They started going steady and bless my soul  
He outbopped the buzzard and the oriole  
  
He rocks in the tree tops all day long  
Hoppin and aboppin and singing his song  
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street  
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet  
  
Chorus
