No bed for Beatle John  
Beatle John Lennon lost his hospital bed yesterday to a patient  
It happened at Queen Charlottes Hospital London  
Where John was keeping vigil in the room  
Where his girlfriend Yoko Ono  
Is being kept under observation  
  
When he realized his bed was needed for an urgent case  
John sent out for a sleeping bag  
And last night  
He was once more happily kicked out alongside Yoko  
In the sleeping bag  
  
Yoko who expects her baby next February  
Will remain in the hospital for another few days  
A Beatles spokesman said  
There is a good chance for the babys survival
