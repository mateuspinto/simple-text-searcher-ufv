I asked my love to take a walk  
To take a walk just a little walk  
Down beside where the waters flow  
Down by the banks of the Ohio  
  
And only say that youll be mine  
In no others arms entwine  
Down beside where the waters flow  
Down by the banks of the Ohio  
  
I held a knife against his breast  
As into my arms he pressed  
He cried my love dont you murder me  
Im not prepared for eternity  
  
I wandered home tween twelve and one  
I cried My God what have I done  
Ive killed the only man I love  
He would not take me for his bride  
  
And only say that youll be mine  
In no others arms entwine  
Down beside where the waters flow  
Down by the banks of the Ohio
