As I look at the world  
I begin to dream of the future  
Whats next to be  
Your love so strong for everyone  
You made us all in your image  
  
And you saved the day  
When Jesus came  
And You took away all my sin and shame  
And You made us right again  
  
You came from God above  
The Fathers only Son  
Saved my soul  
Made me new  
Now I live for You  
  
My heart is alive and my spirit free  
In the Saviour  
Gave His life for me  
By Your Word  
We will be the light of the world  
My Father  
Shine Your light in me  
  
Ill stand on the Word  
Be a light in the world  
When Your praises are heard  
Well be singing
