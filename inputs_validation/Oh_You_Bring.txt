Oh you bring hope to the hopeless  
And light to those in the darkness  
And death to life now Im alive  
  
Oh you give peace to the restless  
And joy to homes that are broken  
I see you now in you Im found  
  
And you open the door for me  
And you lay down your life to set me free  
All that I am will serve you lord  
  
Oh you fill those who are empty  
And rescue those in the valley  
And through it all you calm my soul  
  
Oh now you find me in my weakness  
And heal the wounds of my heartache  
And worship for you in spirit and truth  
  
And you open the door for me  
And you lay down your life to set me free  
All that I am will serve you lord  
  
And you open my eyes to see  
All the wondering all of christ in me  
Jesus youre everything I need  
  
Worship  
  
All honor  
All glory  
All praise to you repeat  
  
And you open the door for me  
And you lay down your life to set me free  
All that I am will serve you lord  
  
And you open my eyes to see  
All the wondering all of christ in me  
Jesus youre everything I need
