Tonight as I lay on a boxcar just waiting for a train to pass by  
What will become of the hobo whenever his time comes to die  
Has the Master up yonder in heaven got a place that we might call our home  
Will we have to work for a living or must we continue to roam  
Will there be any freight trains in heaven any boxcars in which we might hide  
Will there be any tough cops and brakemen will they tell us that we cannot
ride  
Will the hobo chum with the rich man will we always have money to spare  
Will they hand respect for a hobo in that land that lies hidden up there  
 fiddle  acguitar   
Will there be any freight trains
