Oh my boy what have you done  
Did you go out surfing on a frozen sea  
Did you scare the livin daylights out of me  
  
Did you go too far to drive away the demons  
Did you go too far to know what love really means  
Did you imagine it was more cause she went away first  
Or did you force her hand to renew your thirst  
  
Chorus  
Well if you ever want an endless night  
Or you need a moon and stars to shine  
Just hold out your heart my darling  
Hold out your heart my darling  
Hold out your heart  
And I will give you some of mine  
  
Oh my girl what have you done  
Is it something we cant even talk about  
Did you silence me remove me from your faith  
  
Did you make me all but a stranger to your love  
Did you look right through me  
Below me and above  
Did you try to ignore me make me all but lost  
Did you cloud up the sky when you needed me most  
  
Chorus  
  
Its gonna be fine  
Its gonna be fine just fine  
Just hold out your heart my darling  
Just hold out your heart my darling  
Hold out your heart  
And I will give you all of mine
