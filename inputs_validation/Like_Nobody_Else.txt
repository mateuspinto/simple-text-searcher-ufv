Evrything I want I got  and I got you girl  
You really fool me  baby to my little world  
I love you like nobody else  
I love you like nobody else  
I love you like nobody else  
Put yourself in my place  
Do you love me too  
Take a look at my face  
The world I say is you  
I love you and nobody else  
I love you and nobody else  
I love you and nobody else  
break  
Play you no games girl play you no games girl  
I tell you no lies I tell you no lies  
Oh take my loving hands girl take my hands girl  
When you look in my eyes look in my eyes  
I love you like nobody else  
I love you like nobody else  
I love you like nobody else
