If I should lose you  
The stars would fall from the skies  
If I should lose you  
The leaves would wither and die  
  
The birds in May time  
Would sing a lonely refrain  
And I would wander around  
Hating the sound of rain  
  
With you beside me  
No wind in winter would blow  
With you beside me  
A rose would bloom in the snow  
  
I gave you my love  
But I was living a dream  
And living would seem in vain  
If I lost you
