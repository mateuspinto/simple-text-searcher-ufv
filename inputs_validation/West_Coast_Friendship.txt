Are you out there  
Where the rainy days begin  
To feel rather sad  
And the walls are closing in  
Like the darkness around me  
Its so hard to look away  
When the daylight doesnt ever stay  
Above this dull apartment view  
Oh I will surround you  
  
Its quite clear that Im stuck here  
So Ill devise a plan  
And cut out a door in my new living room floor  
The porch light is so bright  
That I will quickly sneak down the dark metal shape  
Of the rusty fire escape  
  
I bought a one way ticket  
Cause I knew Id never see the ground  
Unless I was aboard a jet plane  
And we were going down  
When I wiped the tears from my eyes  
The warm water took me by surprise  
And I woke up beside the ocean  
I realized I must be in California  
  
Aloha my happy West Coast friends  
Do you feel alive  
When the breaking waves arrive  
And wash all around you  
The beach homes and ocean side  
Are quite well known by the evening tide  
And we can sleep where we reside  
With redwoods around us  
The blue air is up there  
And could I bring it down  
Id bottle it up and save it for a sweet summer night  
  
I bought a one way ticket  
Cause I knew Id never see the ground  
Unless I was aboard a jet plane  
And we were going down  
When I wiped the tears from my eyes  
The warm water took me by surprise  
And I woke up beside the ocean  
I realized I must be in California  
I must be in California  
  
Am I awake or is this just a dream  
  
The new year is out here  
And I will make a lovely list  
Of your charms  
So Ill never feel alone in your arms  
  
I must be in California  
I must be in California  
I must be in California
