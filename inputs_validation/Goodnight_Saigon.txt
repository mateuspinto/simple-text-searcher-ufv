We met as soulmates  
On Parris Inland  
We left as inmates  
From an asylum  
And we were sharp  
As sharp as knives  
And we were so gung ho to lay down our lives  
  
We came in spastic  
Like tameless horses  
We left in plastic  
As numbered corpses  
And we learned fast  
To travel light  
Our arms were heavy but our bellies were tight  
  
We had no homefront  
We had no soft soap  
They sent us Playboy  
They gave us Bob Hope  
We dug in deep  
And shot on sight  
And prayed to Jesus Christ with all of our might  
  
We had no cameras  
To shoot the landscape  
We passed the hash pipe  
And played our Doors tapes  
And it was dark  
So dark at night  
And we held onto each other  
Like brother to brother  
We promised our mothers wed write  
  
And we would all go down together  
We said wed all go down together  
Yes we would all go down together  
  
Remember Charlie  
Remember Baker  
They left their childhood  
On every acre  
And who was wrong  
And who was right  
It didnt matter in the thick of the fight  
  
We held the day  
In the palm of our hands  
They ruled the night  
And the night seemed to last as long as six weeks  
On Parris Island  
We held the coastline  
They held the highland  
And they were sharp  
As sharp as knives  
They heard the hum of the motors  
They counted the rotors  
And waited for us to arrive  
  
And we would all go down together  
We said wed all go down together  
Yes we would all go down together
