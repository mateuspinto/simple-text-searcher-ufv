There are three things I do when my life falls apart  
Number one I cry my eyes out and I dry up my heart  
Not until I do this will my new life start  
So thats the first thing that I do when my life falls apart  
  
Oh the second thing I would do is I would close both of my eyes  
And sing the parts I knew of favorite songs up to the sky  
I go where I know the love is centering that look inside  
Gathering new strength from sorrow  
Im glad to be alive  
  
I keep it calm around me  
Im safe inside my storm  
Im seeing all is grounding  
Cause on the ground you cant get no lower  
No when youre grounded you cant get no lower  
  
Yeah the third thing that I do now when my world caves in  
Is I pause I take a breath and bow and I let that chapter end  
I design my future bright not by where my life has been  
And I try try try try try again  
Yes I try try try try try again
