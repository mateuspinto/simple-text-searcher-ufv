Tell me what to do  
Now the light in my life is gone from me  
Is it always the same  
Is the night never ending  
Tell me what to do  
All the hopes and the dreams went wrong for me  
Theres a smile on my face  
But Im only pretending  
Taking my life  
One day at a time  
Cause I cant think what else to do  
Taking some time  
To make up my mind  
When theres no one to ask but you  
The same old sun would shine in the morning  
The same bright eyes would welcome me home  
And the moon would rise way over my head  
And get through the night alone  
And the same old sun will shine in the morning  
The same bright stars will welcome me home  
And the clouds will rise way over my head  
Ill get through the night on my own  
Tell me what to do  
Now theres nobody watching over me  
If I seem to be calm  
Well its all an illusion  
Tell me what to do  
When the fear of the night comes over me  
Theres a smile on my face  
Just to hide the confusion  
Taking my life  
One day at a time  
Cause I cant think what else to do  
Taking some time  
To make up my mind  
When theres no one to ask but you  
The same old sun would shine in the morning  
The same bright eyes would welcome me home  
And the moon would rise way over my head  
And get through the night alone  
And the same old sun will shine in the morning  
The same bright stars will welcome me home  
And the clouds will rise way over my head  
Ill get through the night on my own
