We had a dog named Bocephus living in the front yard  
He liked sleeping out on top of the car  
He drank beer out of a mason jar  
And hed climb up on everyone in bed  
  
A wide frame house in a college town  
A bunch of people always hanging around  
No real problems we needed to drown  
But we tried our best anyway  
  
We went to class just to pass the time  
Back in 89  
  
We had a keg in the closet pizza on the floor  
Left over from the night before  
Where we were going we didnt really care  
We had all we ever wanted  
In that keg in the closet  
  
This old guitar taught me how to score  
Right there on that Lambda Chi porch  
Mary Ann taught me a little more  
About wantin what you cant have  
  
Sweatshirts and flag football  
Spring breaks down in Panama  
For a while we had it all  
We never dreamed it wouldnt last  
  
We went to class just to pass the time  
Back in 89  
  
We had a keg in the closet pizza on the floor  
Left over from the night before  
Where we were going we didnt really care  
We had all we ever wanted  
In that keg in the closet  
  
We all kind of went our separate ways  
But I swear it seems like yesterday  
  
Keg in the closet pizza on the floor  
Left over from the night before  
Where we were going we didnt really care  
We had all we ever wanted  
In that keg in the closet
