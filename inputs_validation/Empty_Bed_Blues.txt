Woke up this mornin  
With an awful achin head  
Woke up this mornin  
With an awful achin head  
My new man left me  
Im just a bloom in an empty bed  
  
Now when my bed gets empty  
I get to feelin kind of mean and blue  
When my bed gets empty  
Get to feelin awful mean and blue  
The springs are gettin rusty  
Sleepin single like I do  
  
I bought me a coffee grinder  
The best one I could find  
You know that I bought me a brand new coffee grinder  
The best one I could find  
So he could grind my coffee  
Babe I got a brand new grind  
You gotta try girl you gotta try  
  
He was a deep sea diver  
With a stroke that could not go wrong  
Deep deep sea deep sea diver  
With a stroke that just could not go wrong  
He could touch the bottom  
And his wind held out so long  
  
Oh he boiled my cabbage  
And he made it awful hot mmmm  
He boiled it I got to tell you  
That he made it made it awful hot  
But when he slipped the bacon in  
He overflowed the pot  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
What a sweet man he was  
I went and told my girlfriend Lou  
Remember that old rag of a girl named Lou  
Real sweet man  
I went and told my girlfriend Lou  
That way that girl is baby  
She must have had a piece of it too  
  
And now when you get good lovin  
Dont you dont you spread the news  
Dont you spread the news  
When you get it and its good good good  
You really ought not to  
You ought not to spread the news  
Because those gals will doublecross you and leave you  
Those gals will doublecross you and they do  
Those gals will doublecross you  
And leave you leave you leave you  
Leave you with the empty bed blues
