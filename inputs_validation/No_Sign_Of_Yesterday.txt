Pull out the stop plugs drain all the waste  
Who needs it anyway  
Fill all the big holes leave no trace  
No sign of yesterday  
  
I wash all the dishes and I clean up my place  
No sign of yesterday  
I stare at the photographs of your dark face  
No sign of yesterday  
  
Out in the yard was such a lovely place  
Its where we used to play  
Inside outside you can feel and taste  
No sign of yesterday  
  
And I cant hear you calling  
I cant hear you calling  
I cant hear you anymore  
Metal ships are falling  
This old car keeps stalling  
Always seems to be the way  
  
Pick up the pieces and go dig out the dead  
Then you can go to bed  
Night is the stealer and time is the test  
No sign of yesterday  
  
Pull out the stop plugs drain all the waste  
Who needs it anyway  
Fill all the big holes leave no trace  
No sign of yesterday  
  
And I cant hear you calling  
I cant hear you calling  
I cant hear you anymore  
Metal ships are falling  
This old car keeps stalling  
Always seems to be the way
