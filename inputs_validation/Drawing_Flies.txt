Sitting here like uninvited company  
Wallowing in my own obscenities  
I share a cigarette with negativity  
Sitting here like wet ashes  
With Xs in my eyes and drawing flies  
  
Bathed in perspiration drowned my enemies  
Used my inspiration for a guillotine  
I fire a loaded mental cannon to the page  
  
Leaning on the pedestal that holds my self denial  
Firing the pistol that shoots my holy pride  
Sitting here like wet ashes  
With Xs in my eyes and drawing flies  
  
Hey what you yelling  
About conditions permission mirrored self affliction  
Hey what you yellin about sadists  
Coaddiction perfect analogies  
hey what you yellin about conditions  
permission mirrored self affliction  
  
Leaning on the pedestal that holds my self denial  
Firing the pistol that shoots my holy pride  
Sitting here like wet ashes with Xs in my eyes  
And drawing flies
