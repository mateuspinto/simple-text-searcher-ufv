What ails you my daughter dear  
Your eyes they look so dim  
Have you had any sore sickness  
Or yet been sleeping with a man  
  
No I havent had any sore sickness  
But I know whats ailing me  
I am thinking of my own true love  
Who ploughs the raging sea  
  
Is he a Lord or a Duke or a knight  
Or a man of wealth and fame  
Or is he one of our sailor lads  
Come tell me now his name  
  
He is no Lord nor Duke nor knight  
Nor a man of wealth or fame  
He is one of your sailor lads  
John Barbour is his name  
  
Now if John Barbour is his name  
A lowly sailor man is he  
If John Barbour is his name  
Then hanged he shall be  
  
Then he called his sailors all  
By one by two by three  
John Barbour was the first he called  
But the last came down was he  
  
When he came a dancing down  
He was clothed all in white  
His cheeks were like the roses red  
And his teeth were ivory bright  
  
He paid their wages with a smile  
And to John Barbour he did say  
If I was a woman as I am a man  
My bed fellow you would be  
  
And will you marry my daughter Jane  
And take her by the hand  
And will you come and dine with me  
Take charge of all my lands  
  
Yes I will marry your daughter Jane  
And take her by the hand  
And I will come and dine with you  
But to hell with all your land  
  
For if you can give her one gold piece  
Then I can give her three  
For they call me young John Barbour  
And I plough the raging sea
