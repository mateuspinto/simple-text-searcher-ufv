Cuts to the quick  
Pure emotion a trip  
No word of a lie  
  
Pressed to your lips  
We collide slowly twist  
Ardent and lithe  
  
Seeps into the ground  
Kisses the earth and I am found  
  
Loves young dream could be alien  
Strange ways how we fly  
Tuning low like a radio  
Whispering goodbye  
  
Just so it seems  
Softly potent serene  
Vacant and shy  
  
You are everywhere  
Under my skin and in my hair  
  
Loves young dream could be alien  
Strange ways how we fly  
Tuning low like a radio  
Whispering goodbye  
  
Seeps into the ground  
Kisses the earth and I am found  
  
Loves young dream could be alien  
Strange ways how we fly  
Tuning low like a radio  
Whispering goodbye  
  
Loves young dream could be alien  
Strange ways how we fly  
Tuning low like a radio  
Whispering goodbye  
  
Loves young dream could be alien  
Strange ways how we fly
