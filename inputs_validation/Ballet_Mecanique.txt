A thousand puppets  
Waiting for a call  
A thousand puppets  
Afraid to fall  
  
Try to walk try to dance  
Try to talk and wanna get their chance  
One guy stands over there  
He pretends to go somewhere  
He shouts out  
  
Follow me  
Only then you will see  
Whats it all all about  
Only then you will see  
Whats it all all about  
Hey you there stop to shout  
Stop to shout  
  
Follow me and my advice  
Stop to think  
Aint this nice  
I will tell you what to do  
If you let me count for you  
Un deux trois  
  
Follow me and my advice  
Stop to think  
Aint this nice  
I will tell you what to do  
If you let me count for you  
Stop to shout  
Stop to shout  
  
I prefer to lose my mind  
Not knowing what to do  
Through your eyes I will be blind  
Through your eyes and you  
I dont wanna learn  
Learn your dance  
I dont care for this advance  
I dont wanna learn your dance  
I dont care for this advance  
  
Thats for now the one defense  
Not to be caught behind your fence  
I prefer to be a freak  
And the world might call me weak  
If you give me immediate sense  
I know I move behind your fence Repeat x3
