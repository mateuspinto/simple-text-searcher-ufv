Wayfaring warrior soul still wild  
The archer stands  
Arrow measured to the goal sing of  
Strong and living man  
In his mind there is a vision wandring  
Through the forest town  
Telling of riches only given if through  
The woods the way is found  
  
Crying ah beautiful dancers wake up  
From your sleep  
Ah gentle romancers drink of love  
So sweet  
  
Treasure glowing in their eyes forest  
Deepens dark their dream  
Keep to the pathway he advise the woods  
Are more than they might seem  
Heed you now the apparition bending never  
Ending sounds  
Call you into her mystery are your eyes  
Not sparkling now  
  
Sighing ahh take you no warning  
Make no foolish fight  
Ahh think not of morning lie here  
Through the night  
  
Beauty take us they call in my arms  
They hear her say  
Silken web falls mist illusion rips away  
Helpless helpless now they scream  
Helpless on the path he stands  
And awakens from his dream singing string  
Beneath his hand  
  
Gentle archer ages old release the aim  
Free the goal  
Roll your arrow to my soul release the aim  
Free the goal
