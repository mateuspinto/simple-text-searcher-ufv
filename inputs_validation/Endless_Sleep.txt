The night was dark rain fallin down  
Look for my baby hes nowhere around  
I traced his footsteps down to the shore  
Afraid hes gone forever more  
  
Chorus  
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say  
I took your baby from you away  
I heard a voice cryin in the deep  
Come join your baby in my endless sleep  
  
Why did we quarrel Why did we fight  
Why did I leave him alone tonight  
Thats why his footsteps ran to the sea  
Thats why my baby is gone from me  
  
Chorus  
  
Ran in the water heart full of fear  
There in the breakers I saw him near  
Reached for my baby held him to me  
Stole him away from the endless sleep  
  
I looked at the sea and it seemed to say  
You took your baby from me away  
My heart cried out Hes mine to keep  
I saved my baby from that endless sleep  
I saved my baby from that endless sleep  
I saved my baby from that endless sleep
