I made the Spike about nine oclock on a Saturday  
All eyes hit me as I walked into the bar  
The spikey leather guys were foolin with the denim dudes  
A couple cards played rough stuff New York Fire Island  
  
I cased the joint straining at the scenes  
  
I moseyed up to the counter and the tender came agrinnin  
I snapped the smile off his face and snarled Give me a bourbon  
The mirror on the wall was collecting and reflecting  
All the heavy bodies ducking stealing eager for some action  
The scene screwed me up I saw some contact  
Then there he was saw me and knew that  
  
Id had too much foolin around  
Statues alive seconds are hours  
  
Sex is like a hurricane it grabs and then it shatters  
I was barely holding on to this fine body symphony  
I guess I dream in pictures not colors  
The true free expression I demand is human rights  right  
  
I came the light I am immortal  
  
Im going no loss  
Im going no loss  
Im going no loss  
Im going no loss  
  
Nightmare just a bunch of goddamn rotten steaming raw  
Deal
