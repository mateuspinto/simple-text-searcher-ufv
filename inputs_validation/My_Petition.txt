I just sat down to watch the game  
When I heard the doorbell ring  
An I wondered who in the world it could be  
Through the peephole all that I saw there  
Was a crooked cap on curly hair  
An some kid squintin back at me  
  
I said If youre sellin somethin  
Well I aint buyin nothin  
But I appreciate you stoppin by  
Said I aint askin for a dime just a minute of your time  
An your name here on the dotted line  
Could you sign my petition  
  
Had a spiral notebook in his hand  
Handed me a chewed up pen  
An I ask you What am I signin up for  
I scrolled down that wrinkled page  
Saw a couple of neighbors names  
I kept readin and I sat down on the porch  
  
It was a letter to the President  
With a list that numbered one to ten  
  
It said Make a law where daddys dont work late  
Keep Uncle Joe an those soldiers safe  
Give those kids on TV all they want to eat  
Put a stop to bullies on the bus  
No crime no waits no hate no drugs  
Give a jacket and a job to people on the street  
  
I said Son sounds like a world Id like to live in  
And I signed his petition  
  
He thanked me for my time  
I headed back inside grabbed my beer  
An got back to the game  
Thought by now that boy hes three doors down  
Here I am just sittin round  
Waitin on the world to change  
  
Mustve blocked the whole game out  
All that I could think about was  
  
Make a law where daddys dont work late  
Keep Uncle Joe an those soldiers safe  
Give those kids on TV all they want to eat  
Put a stop to bullies on the bus  
No crime no waits no hate no drugs  
Give a blanket and a job to people on the street  
  
An I thought Man aint that a place Id like to live in  
And I thank God for that boy thats out there fixin  
The world with his petition
