We belong to the world we belong to the wind  
We are the spirit of competitions end  
Turning hours into days burning muscles feel the pain  
The heart and soul of discipline my friends  
  
We are sending you a challenge its very clear  
We came to win that is why we are here  
Demanding to be tested by the best  
Not to be forgotten like all the rest  
  
The time has come all training done  
  
The muscle and the blood will come to pay  
  
Chorus  
Let the game begin hear the starting gun  
Play from the heart today we will overcome  
When the game is over all the counting is done  
We were born to win number 1  
  
Today is the day all the training through  
We have come for the number one not the number two  
Let the contest begin play hard fight to win  
Immortality victory and fame  
  
The time has come all training done  
The muscle and the blood will come to pay  
  
Chorus  
Let the game begin hear the starting gun  
Play from the heart today we will overcome  
When the game is over all the counting is done  
We were born to win number 1  
  
Today is the day all the training through  
We have come for the number one not the number two  
Let the contest begin play hard fight to win  
Immortality victory and fame  
  
Chorus  
Let the game begin hear the starting gun  
Play from the heart today we will overcome  
When the game is over all the counting is done  
We were born to win number 1
