In a world full of jive  
Full of homicide and suicide  
Theres no room for love and romance  
In a world full of spite  
Full of hatefulness and bitterness  
Sincerity dont stand a chance  
And every night I close my eyes  
And ask the stars above  
Oh where oh where oh where oh where is love  
  
Where is love and romance  
And appreciation of storybooks fairy tales  
And the ordinary things people did long ago  
Where did it go  
Where is love  
Where is hope  
Where is sympathy and trust  
Where is faith  
Where is joy in simplicity  
And where is regard and respect  
Oh where oh where is love  
This world is spinning and turning  
And my head is full of learning  
But my thoughts keep on returning  
To the things I used to know  
I should be stronger  
But my mind continually wanders  
And deep inside  
A voice keeps crying  
Where oh where is love  
  
Where is love and romance  
And appreciation of storybooks fairy tales  
And the ordinary things people did long ago  
Where did it go  
In a world full of jive  
Full of homicide and suicide  
Theres no room for love and romance  
In a world full of rape  
Full of hatefulness and bitterness  
Sincerity dont stand a chance  
And every night I close my eyes  
And ask the stars above  
Oh where oh where oh where oh where is love  
Where oh where is love  
Where is love  
Where is hope  
Where is sympathy and trust  
Where is faith  
Where is joy and simplicity  
And where is regard and respect  
Oh where oh where is love  
Oh where oh where is love  
Oh where oh where is love
