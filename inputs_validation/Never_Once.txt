Standing on this mountaintop  
Looking just how far weve come  
Knowing that for every step  
You were with us  
  
Kneeling on this battle ground  
Seeing just how much Youve done  
Knowing every victory  
Was Your power in us  
  
Scars and struggles on the way  
But with joy our hearts can say  
Yes our hearts can say  
  
Never once did we ever walk alone  
Never once did You leave us on our own  
You are faithful God You are faithful

Scars and struggles on the way  
But with joy our hearts can say

Carried by Your constant grace  
Held within Your perfect peace  
Never once no we never walk alone
