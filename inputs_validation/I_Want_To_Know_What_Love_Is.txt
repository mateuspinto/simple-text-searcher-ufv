I gotta take a little time  
A little time to think things over  
I better read between the lines  
In case I need it when Im older  
  
Now this mountain I must climb  
Feels like a world upon my shoulders  
I through the clouds I see love shine  
It keeps me warm as life grows colder  
  
In my life theres been heartache and pain  
I dont know if I can face it again  
Cant stop now Ive traveled so far  
To change this lonely life  
  
I wanna know what love is  
I want you to show me  
I wanna feel what love is  
I know you can show me  
  
Im gonna take a little time  
A little time to look around me  
Ive got nowhere left to hide  
It looks like love has finally found me  
  
In my life theres been heartache and pain  
I dont know if I can face it again  
I cant stop now Ive traveled so far  
To change this lonely life  
  
I wanna know what love is  
I want you to show me  
I wanna feel what love is  
I know you can show me  
  
I wanna know what love is  
I want you to show me  
And I wanna feel I want to feel what love is  
And I know I know you can show me  
  
Lets talk about love  
I wanna know what love is the love that you feel inside  
I want you to show me and Im feeling so much love
