If I had my way  
If I had to lose  
Wouldnt take back one thing never had much to choose  
Then it dawned on me  
Coming down on you  
Like a cold sky raining under a burning moon  
  
Youve waited all your life  
Your wish is coming true  
Bless your heart for beating me right outta you  
  
Miss the misery  
Need a reason for a change  
Need a reason to explain  
So turn it on again  
Dont change your mind  
Your wasting light  
Get in and lets  
Go go  
  
What a nice long leash  
What a nice tight noose  
Never worked for me but sure look good on you  
Youve waited all your life  
Your wish is coming true  
Bless your heart for beating me right outta you  
  
Miss the misery  
Need a reason for a change  
Need a reason to refrain  
So turn it on again  
Dont change your mind  
Your wasting light  
Get in and lets  
Go go  
  
Miss the misery  
Gimme a reason for a change  
Miss the misery  
Gimme a reason to refrain  
Miss your misery in a day  
Miss your misery in a day  
Come on and turn it on for me  
  
Dont change your mind  
Your wasting light  
Dont make this right  
Dont make this right  
Get in and lets  
Go go
