Ive latched on Ive been wrong  
No one told me what to wear no one sent me home  
Space age party fascinating I just dont fit in  
Someone throw me anything the oxygene is thin  
If you just cant speak to me just throw me a line  
Give me just a little nod I could fascinate you  
But I am out of place float in outerspace  
No one wants to pull me in its awful saving face  
I could fascinate I could serenade  
Im opinionated Ill have Vodka Lemonade  
If you just cant speak to me just throw me a line  
Give me just a little nod you are fascinated  
I could serenade  
We could throw this party and take off on our own  
Find our own higher place an odessy back home  
I could not be less included you could not have known  
In my darkest rose and pennant I am so alone  
If you just cant speak to me just throw me a line  
Give me just a little nod you are fascinated  
I could serenade  
I could fascinate you  
I could resonate
