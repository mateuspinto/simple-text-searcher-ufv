Spring will come and grass will grow  
The brooks will hum with melted snow  
If love is good to me  
Clouds will cry and rain will fall  
The earth will sigh and drink it all  
If love is good to me  
There always will be skies of blue above me  
Just as long as Mother Nature makes you love me  
Leaves will fall from winters chill  
Ill recall a summer thrill  
That once you gave to me  
These wonderous things each year  
Depend on you my dear  
This all could be  
If love is good to me  
If love is good to me  
If love is good to me  
There always will be skies of blue above me  
Just as long as Mother Nature makes you love me  
Leaves will fall from winters chill and  
Ill recall a summer thrill  
That once you gave to me  
These wonderous things each year  
Depend on you my dear  
This all could be  
If love is good to me  
This all could be  
If love is good to me
