A mirror image of a silver sky  
Nests of pines and brandy wines build this country to the sky  
Do you remember now the oblivion of youthful minds  
Caught up in the fashions of their time  
Roll away  
I can see that clearly now every time I look into this  
Mirror image of a silver sky  
Nests of pines and brandy wine build this country to the sky  
What would they say  
God is here in this country by the sky  
A mirror image of a silver sky  
Nests of pines and brandy wines build this country to the sky  
Piecemeal of yesteryear  
A stained glass moment marking time  
With full intent on my 22 year old mind  
Roll away  
I can see that clearly now  
Every time I look into this mirror image of a silver sky  
Nests of pines and brandy wine build this country to the sky  
What would they say  
God is here in this country by the sky
