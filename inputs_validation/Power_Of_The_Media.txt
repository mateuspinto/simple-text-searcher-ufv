Flying through the airwaves  
Living through the printed word  
Flasher in the living room  
Guru of the seen and heard  
Who decides what we get to hear  
Fuzzy round the edges or making it clear  
Blinding us with those facts  
Chorus  
The power of the media will make up our minds  
The power of the media will take down our minds  
Written on the black and white page  
We cant believe what we read  
Tarting up reality has become the new rage  
Who said the truth is stranger than fiction  
A few white lies for a nice little sensation  
Buy up a paper you can influence the nation  
Little box in the corner  
A picture worth a thousand words  
But who chooses which pictures we see  
Who decides on the commentary  
Keeping people in a state of confusion  
Theres a thin line between facts and illusion  
Diverting our attention from big brother in the city  
When will we get to the real nitty gritty
