What can we scrape together  
With just the flesh as evidence  
Handfuls of hate and the bittersweet ambivalence  
cause I am pushing cobwebs and Im folding into myself  
Who will find me under this mean sleep  
  
How could the clouse tease us into thinking it might rain  
How could the need deceive us into thinking things might change  
I had a mean sleep over you and it hurts coming back to life  
  
You could burn a thousand days  
And I would need no other light  
You could die a thousand ways  
And Id still love you back to life  
But my needs rising angry and loneliness like quicksand  
Who will find me under still mean sleep  
  
How could the clouse tease us into thinking it might rain  
How could the need deceive us into thinking things might change  
I had a mean sleep over you and it hurts coming back to life  
  
I am lost to the longing  
I am moulded by my memory  
Had shut down half my mind  
Just to still the space you left behind  
cause I am pushing cobwebs and Im folding into myself  
Who will find me under this mean sleep  
  
How could the clouse tease us into thinking it might rain  
How could the need deceive us into thinking things might change  
I had a mean sleep over you and it hurts coming back to life
