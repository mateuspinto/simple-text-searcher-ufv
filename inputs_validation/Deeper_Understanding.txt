As the people here grow colder  
I turn to my computer  
And spend my evenings with it  
Like a friend  
I was loading a new program  
I had ordered from a magazine  
Are you lonely are you lost  
This voice console is a must  
I press Execute  
  
Hello I know that youve been feeling tired  
I bring you love and deeper understanding  
Hello I know that youre unhappy  
I bring you love and deeper understanding  
  
Well Ive never felt such pleasure  
Nothing seemed to matter  
I neglected my bodily needs  
I did not eat I did not sleep  
The intensity increasing  
Til my family found me and intervened  
But I was lonely I was lost  
Without my little black box  
I pick up the phone and go Execute  
  
Hello I know that youve been feeling tired  
I bring you love and deeper understanding  
Hello I know that youre unhappy  
I bring you love and deeper understanding  
  
I turn to my computer like a friend  
I need deeper understanding  
Give me deeper understanding
