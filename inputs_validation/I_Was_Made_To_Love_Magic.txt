I was born to love no one  
No one to love me  
Only the wind in the long green grass  
The frost in a broken tree  
I was made to love magic  
All its wonder to know  
But you all lost that magic  
Many many years ago  
I was born to use my eyes  
Dream with the sun and the skies  
To float away in a lifelong song  
In the mist where melody flies  
I was made to love magic  
I was born to sail away  
Into a land of forever  
Not to be tied to an old stone grave  
In your land of never  
I was made to love magic
