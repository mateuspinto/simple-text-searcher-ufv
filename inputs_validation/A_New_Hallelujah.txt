Can you hear theres a new song  
Breaking out from the children of freedom  
Every race and every nation  
Sing it out sing a new Hallelujah  
  
Let us sing love to the nations  
Bringing hope of the grace that has freed us  
Make Him known and make Him famous  
Sing it out sing to the new Hallelujah  
  
Chorus  
Arise  
Let the church Arise  
Let love reach to the other side  
Alive come alive  
Let the song Arise  
  
Africa sings a new song  
Reaching out with the new Hallelujah  
Every son and every daughter  
Everyone sing a new Hallelujah  
  
Chorus

Let the song Arise  
Let love reach to the other side  
Alive come alive  
Let the song Arise  
  
Whoa whoa yeah Repeat x2  
Let the song arise Repeat x2  
Let the song arise yeah Repeat x2  
  
Let the world sing a new Hallelujah  
From Africa to Australia  
From Brazil to China  
From New York down to Houston

Everyone sing a new Hallelujah Repeat x2
