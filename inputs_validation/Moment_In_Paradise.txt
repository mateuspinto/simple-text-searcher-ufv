Oh yeah  
  
She never cried she only tried  
To fly beyond her dreams  
No walls around her mind  
  
Deep inside shed try to hide  
That she was way beyond her means  
No borders and no lines  
  
She said that its your duty to save your soul  
To save it for someone  
Moment in paradise  
Just a moment in paradise  
Oh yeah  
  
Moment in paradise  
Just a moment in paradise  
Oh yeah  
  
She floated out upon the wind  
That blew my thoughts into the night  
She knew the things she had to know  
  
She drifted high above my mind  
Blew my brains out did alright  
I think she knew it all along  
  
She said that its your duty to save your soul  
To save it for someone  
Moment in paradise  
Just a moment in paradise  
Oh yeah  
  
Moment in paradise  
Just a moment in paradise  
Oh yeah  
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah  
  
She said that its your duty to save your soul  
To save it for someone  
Moment in paradise  
Just a moment in paradise  
Oh yeah  
  
Moment in paradise  
Moment in paradise  
Moment in paradise  
Moment in paradise  
Oh yeah  
Moment in paradise  
Moment in paradise  
Just a moment in paradise
