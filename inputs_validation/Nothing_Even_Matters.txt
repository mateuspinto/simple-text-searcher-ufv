Now the skies could fall  
Not even if my boss should call  
The world it seems so very small  
Cause nothin even matters at all  
  
See nothin even matters  
See nothin even matters at all  
Nothin even matters  
Nothin even matters at all  
  
See I dont need no alcohol  
Your love makes me feel ten feet tall  
Without it Id go through withdrawal  
Cause nothin even matters at all  
  
Nothin even matters  
Nothin even matters at all  
Nothin even matters  
Nothin even matters at all  
  
These buildings could drift out to sea  
Some natural catastrophe  
Still theres no place Id rather be  
Cause nothin even matters to me  
  
See nothin even matters  
See nothin even matters to me  
Nothin even matters  
Nothin even matters to me  
  
Youre part of my identity  
I sometimes have the tendency  
To look at you religiously baby  
Cause nothin even matters to me  
  
Nothin even matters  
Nothin even matters to me  
Said I dont my baby baby  
  
Now you wont find me at no store  
I have no time for manicures  
With you its never either or  
Cause nothin even matters no more  
  
See nothin it dont matters  
See nothin even matters no more  
Nothin even matters  
Nothin even matters no more  
  
Now my team could score  
And make it to the final four  
Just repossess my 4 x 4  
Cause nothin even matters no more  
  
Nothin even matters  
Nothin even matters no more  
Nothin even matters oh oh oh  
  
To me to me to me to me to me  
To me to me to me to me to me  
  
Nothing even matters  
Nothing even matters no more  
Nothing even matters  
Nothing even matters  
  
Nothing but you  
Nothing but you  
Nothing but you
