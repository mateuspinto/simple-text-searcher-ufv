Where there is hatredlet me bring love  
  
Where there is doubt let me bring faith  
  
Where there is falsehood let me bring truth  
Where there is pain Ill comfort you  
  
Where there is silence let me sing praise  
Where theres despair let me bring hope  
  
Where there is blindness let me bring sight  
Where there is darkness let me bring light  
  
And with these words I speak  
Grant that I may not so seek  
To be heard but to hear  
To be consoled but to console  
Not to be seen but to see  
To be loved but to love  
  
For when we give love we will receive  
  
When we forgive love well find reprieve  
It is in dying well be released  
Make me an instrument of peace
