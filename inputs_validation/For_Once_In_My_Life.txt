For once in my life I have someone who needs me  
Someone Ive needed so long  
For once unafraid I can go where life leads me  
And somehow I know Ill be strong  
  
For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of  
Long before I knew  
Someone warm like you  
Would make my dreams come true  
  
For once in my life I wont let sorrow hurt me  
Not like it hurt me before  
For once I have something I know wont desert me  
Im not alone anymore  
  
For once I can say this is mine you cant take it  
As long as I know I have love I can make it  
For once in my life I have someone who needs me
