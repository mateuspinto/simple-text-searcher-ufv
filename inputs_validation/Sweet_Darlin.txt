Sweet darlin  
You saved me  
Im hummin  
From the lovin  
You gave me  
You went so far  
Where my feelings are  
Breathing heaven fire  
Sweet darlin  
  
I know you  
You stopped running  
You knew I had something  
To show you  
The fever tamed  
Like an angel came  
Made music of my name  
Sweet darlin  
  
Early that morning we knew I had to fly  
Engines were screaming and still I was asking myself why  
High on the wind I was feeling my sweet darlin cry  
My heart was breaking  
I closed my eyes  
Darlin  
Can you hear me  
We cant be wrong  
The nights song  
Pulls you near me  
Time just falls  
Distance small  
I feel you all  
Sweet darlin
