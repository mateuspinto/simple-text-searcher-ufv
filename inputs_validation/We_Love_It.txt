We love it  
We need it oh Lord  
When the world gets hooked on drugs  
You and I are hooked on music  
  
We smoke it  
We walk it  
And we eat it  
  
Make it your way of life  
Even the Pope agrees  
It is your natural way  
Of staying high  
  
You see when you smoke music  
You dont have to smoke and hide  
Even when policeman comes  
You dont have to jump no fence  
  
We love it  
We smoke it  
Never stop the music  
  
Come on and make it your way of life  
Even the President agrees  
  
It is your natural connection  
To staying high  
  
We love it  
We smoke it  
We need it  
Never stop the music
