Nothing to show beyond the fear I had  
Body so warm within his perfumed bed  
Sleeping alone the shadow of a man  
He will entice you too and if he can  
Nothing to show for love has never been  
Nothing to show for love has never been  
Nothing to show for love has never been  
  
Nothing is handed power is changing fast  
Many the empty hopes his lips caress  
Sorry to say his days are spent in vain  
Chasing a dream of doom of nights in pain  
Nothing to show for love has never been  
Nothing to show for love has never been  
Nothing to show for love has never been  
  
Shadowy nights of memories of the grave  
Gentle my love and sweetness sometimes sick  
Keep up his time while his crimes are known  
Only a fool can see hes sold his love  
Nothing to show for love has never been  
Nothing to show for love has never been  
Nothing to show for love has never been  
  
Nothing to show for love has never been  
Nothing to show for love has never been  
Nothing to show for love has never been
