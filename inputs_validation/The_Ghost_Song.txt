Awake  
Shake dreams from your hair  
My pretty child my sweet one  
Choose the day and choose the sign of your day  
The days divinity  
First thing you see  
  
A vast radiant beach in a cool jeweled moon  
Couples naked race down by its quiet side  
And we laugh like soft mad children  
Smug in the wooly cotton brains of infancy  
The music and voices are all around us  
  
Choose they croon the ancient ones  
The time has come again  
Choose now they croon  
Beneath the moon  
Beside an ancient lake  
  
Enter again the sweet forest  
Enter the hot dream  
Come with us  
Everything is broken up and dances  
  
Indians scattered  
On dawns highway bleeding  
Ghosts crowd the young childs  
Fragile eggshell mind  
  
We have assembled inside  
This ancient and insane theater  
To propagate our lust for life  
And flee the swarming wisdom of the streets  
  
The barns have stormed  
The windows kept  
And only one of all the rest  
To dance and save us  
From the divine mockery of words  
Music inflames temperament  
  
Ooh great creator of being  
Grant us one more hour  
To perform our art  
And perfect our lives  
  
We need great golden copulations  
  
When the true kings murderers  
Are allowed to roam free  
A thousand magicians arise in the land  
Where are the feast we are promised
