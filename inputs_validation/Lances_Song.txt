Doing what you love has a high price to pay  
Some put on a suit but he ran the other way  
Drums drown out the yuppies  
And the ones who couldnt dream  
Cause the freedom music gave him was worth more than anything  
  
They dont know  
What they got  
Until its gone  
Like it or not  
You live on love  
You try to do whats right  
Were all here waiting for our silver invitation  
To the big band in the sky  
  
Rollin down the windows  
Trying hard to fight the sleep  
Moneys never much for a band in Tennessee  
Another night of playin  
To a crowd with no ears  
Wanna hear the songs they know  
And fill their bellies full of beer  
  
But they dont know  
What they got  
Until its gone  
Like it or not  
You live on love  
You try to do whats right  
Were all here waiting for our silver invitation  
To the big band in the sky  
  
And when he closed his eyes  
Fell into a dream that never dies  
And when the thunder comes  
You can hear his kick drum in the sky  
Feel the rain  
Fall from our eyes  
  
Cause we dont know  
What we got  
Until its gone  
Like it or not  
You live on love  
You try to do whats right  
For him theres no more waiting  
Got his silver invitation  
To do a little playing  
For the big band in the sky
