Im pulling the pavement from under my nails  
I brush past a garden dependent on whales  
The sloping companion I cast down the ash  
Yanked on my tunic and dangled my stash  
  
Zipping through the forest with the curdling fleas  
To grow with them spindles the mutant I seize  
I capture the dread beast who falls to his knees  
And cries to his cohorts asleep in the trees  
  
Smegma dogmatagram fishmarket stew  
Police in a corner gunnin for you  
Appletoast bedheated furblanket rat  
Laugh when they shoot you say  
Please dont do that  
  
Control for smilers cant be bought  
The solar garlic starts to rot  
Was it for this my life I sought  
  
Maybe so and maybe not Maybe so and maybe not  
Maybe so and maybe not Maybe so and maybe not  
Maybe so and maybe not Maybe so and maybe not  
Maybe so and maybe not Maybe so and maybe not  
  
Was it for this my life I sought Maybe so and maybe not  
Control for smilers cant be bought Maybe so and maybe not  
The solar garlic starts to rot Maybe so and maybe not  
  
Was it for this my life I sought Maybe so and maybe not  
Was it for this my life I sought Maybe so and maybe not  
Was it for this my life I sought Maybe so and maybe not  
Was it for this my life I sought Maybe so and maybe not
