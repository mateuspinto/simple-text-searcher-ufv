Drought makes the workers dream  
Muscles and fields of green  
Shovel the last few crumbs  
Of generosity  
Open hearts open mind open mouth open vein  
Drain  
Someday the rains will come  
My blistered hands tell me  
Tomorrow tomorrow tomorrow  
Bite  
Bite  
Bite  
Cry  
Ill keep coming back  
Smaller and smaller and smaller  
Squash me  
Smaller and smaller and smaller  
Under the charity  
Smaller and smaller and smaller  
Under the topsoil  
Smaller and smaller and smaller  
Under the fingernail  
Smaller and smaller and smaller  
Then small becomes all becomes all  
Bite  
Bite  
Bite  
Cry  
Its not a mirage  
Its not a mirage  
Trickling downward trickling downward  
Its not a mirage  
Drain  
Drain  
Bite  
Bite  
Bite  
Cry  
Smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller
