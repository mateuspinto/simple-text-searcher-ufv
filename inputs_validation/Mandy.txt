I remember all my life  
Raining down as cold as ice  
A shadow of a man  
A face through a window  
Crying in the night  
The night goes into  
  
Morning just another day  
Happy people pass my way  
Looking in their eyes  
I see a memory  
I never realized  
How happy you made me oh Mandy  
  
Well you came and you gave without taking  
And I sent you away oh Mandy  
And you kissed me and stopped me from shaking  
And I need you today oh Mandy  
  
Im standing on the edge of time  
Walked away when love was mine  
Caught up in a world of uphill climbing  
The tears are in my eyes  
And nothing is rhyming oh Mandy  
  
Well you came and you gave without taking  
And I sent you away oh Mandy  
And you kissed me and stopped me from shaking  
And I need you today oh Mandy  
  
Yesterdays a dream  
Now I face the morning  
Crying on the breeze  
The pain is calling oh Mandy  
  
Well you came and you gave without taking  
And I sent you away oh Mandy  
And you kissed me and stopped me from shaking  
And I need you today oh Mandy  
  
Well you came and you gave without taking  
And I sent you away oh Mandy  
And you kissed me and stopped me from shaking  
And I need you today oh Mandy
