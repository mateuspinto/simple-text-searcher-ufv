Haiti Cherie says Haiti is my beloved land  
Oh I never knew that I have to leave you to understand  
Just how much I miss the gallant Citadel  
Where days long ago brave men served this country well  
Where sun is bright or evening with soft moonlight  
Shading tree Creole maiden for company  
A gentle breeze a warm caress if you please  
Work laughter and play yes well always be this way  
Haiti Cherie now Ive returned to your soil so dear  
Let me hear again the things that give music to my ear  
The lone shepherds horn that welcomes the rising morn  
When roads overflow as crowds to Iron market go  
Where sun is bright or evening with soft moonlight  
Shading tree Creole maiden for company  
A gentle breeze a warm caress if you please  
Work laughter and play yes well always be this way
