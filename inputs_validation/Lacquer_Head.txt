Sometimes bored and sometimes lonely  
Pimple faced and rather homely  
He wasnt much for socializin  
The TV kept a mesmerizin  
  
In one ear and out the other  
Picked up a trick from his older brother  
Got him a can of sniffin sauce  
Pinned his mind up on a cross  
  
Lacquer head knows but one desire  
Lacquer head sets his skull on fire  
Lacquer head knows no in betweens  
Huffin on bags of gasoline  
  
Sniffin paint since the seventh grade  
She was high on gin and Gatorade  
On turpentine she lost her luck  
Fell in front of a speeding pickup truck  
  
He was a boy of soft demeanor  
And he loved his carburetor cleaner  
The vapor made a sweet aroma  
He sniffed himself into a coma  
  
Lacquer head feeds his one desire  
Lacquer head sets his brain on fire  
Lacquer head knows no in betweens  
Huffin on bags of gasoline  
  
Keep on sniffin till yer brain goes pop
