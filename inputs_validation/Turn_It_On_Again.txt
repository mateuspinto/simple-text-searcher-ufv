All I need is a TV show that and the radio  
Down on my luck again down on my luck again  
I can show you I can show you some of the people in my life  
I can show you I can show you some of the people in my life  
Its driving me mad just another way of passing the day  
I I get so lonely when shes not there  
I  
  
Youre just another face that I know from the TV show  
I have known you for so very long I feel you like a friend  
Cant you do anything for me can I touch you for a while  
Can I meet you another day and we will fly away  
  
I can show you I can show you some of the people in my life  
I can show you I can show you some of the people in my life  
Its driving me mad just another way of passing the day  
I I get so lonely when shes not there  
I  
  
Turn it on turn it on turn it on again  
Turn it on turn it on turn it on again  
I can see another face  
Turn it on turn it on turn it on again  
I can see another face  
Turn it on turn it on turn it on again
