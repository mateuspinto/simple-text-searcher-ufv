I had just turned sixteen that season  
When you came up from Burma to stay  
And you told me I ought to travel with you  
You were sure it would be OK  
When I asked how you earned your living  
I can still hear what you said to me  
You had some kind of job on the railway  
And had nothing to do with the sea  
  
You said a lot Johnny  
All one big lie Johnny  
You cheated me blind Johnny  
From the minute we met  
I hate you so Johnny  
When you stand there grinning Johnny  
Take that damn pipe out of your mouth you rat  
  
Surabaya Johnny  
No ones meaner than you  
Surabaya Johnny  
My God and I still love you so  
Surabaya Johnny  
Why am I feeling so blue   
You have no heart Johnny  
And I still love you so  
  
At the start every day was Sunday  
Till we went on our way one fine night  
And before two more weeks were over  
You thought nothing I did was right  
So we trekked up and down through the Punjab  
From the source of the river to the sea  
When I look at my face in the mirror  
Theres an old woman staring back at me  
  
You didnt want love Johnny  
You wanted cash Johnny  
But I sewed your lips Johnny  
And that was that  
You wanted it all Johnny  
I gave you more Johnny  
Take that damn pipe out of your mouth you rat  
  
Surabaya Johnny  
No ones meaner than you  
Surabaya Johnny  
My God and I still love you so  
Surabaya Johnny  
Why am I feeling so blue   
You have no heart Johnny  
And I still love you so  
  
I would never have thought of asking  
How youd got that peculiar name  
But from one end of the coast to the other  
You were known everywhere we came  
And one day I
