In the silence of Your majesty  
In the splendor of Your holiness  
In the stillness of Your glory  
Let me hear Your voice  
The gentle whisper of Your voice  
  
Father I long to stand before You  
And lay my life before You  
I come to worship You alone oh my God  
I reach my hands toward You  
With all my heart adore You  
Let me hear Your voice  
  
With the power of Your presence  
And your beauty all around me  
As the heavens stand in awe of You  
Let me hear Your voice
