I was twenty one naive  
Not cynical I try to please  
Her wit her speech her repartee  
Impressed me almost instantly  
  
She went all the way  
All the way down  
She went all the way all the way  
  
She showed me love a hundred ways  
How she pimped and how she paid  
All the daughters all the sons  
All were welcome all would come  
  
We went all the way  
All the way down  
We went all the way all the way  
  
I was King Mr Cool  
Just a snobby little fool  
Like kids are now  
I dreamed of reaching greater heights  
I raved about it every night  
Talk is cheap  
  
She went all the way all the way  
All the way down yeah  
She went all the way  
All the way all the way  
All the way all the way down  
  
Shes there when I close my eyes  
There when I close my eyes  
Shes there when I close my eyes  
There when I close my eyes  
  
How the years they rush on by  
Birthdays kids and suicides  
Still I play the fool and strut  
Still youre a slut  
  
Hey girl she went all the way  
All the way all the way  
All the way down  
She went all the way  
All the way all the way  
All the way down  
She went all the way  
All the way all the way  
All the way down  
  
You give me back that time right now  
I can see it if I close my eyes  
Was every minute just a waste  
Was every hour a foolish chase  
I dont believe it  
  
She went all the way  
All the way down  
She went all the way  
All the way down  
She went all the way  
All the way down  
She went all the way  
All the way all the way  
All the way down  
She went all the way  
All the way all the way  
All the way down
