Quiet nights and quiet stars  
Quiet chords from my guitar  
Floating on the silence that surrounds us  
  
Quiet nights and quiet dreams  
Quiet walks by quiet streams  
And the window lookin on the mountains and the sea how lovely  
  
This is where to be  
Here with you so close to me  
Till the final flicker of lifes ember  
  
I who was lost and lonely  
Believing life was a only a bitter tragic joke  
Have found with you the meaning of existence oh my love  
  
instrumental interlude  
  
This is where to be  
Here with you so close to me  
Till the final flicker of lifes ember  
  
I who was lost and lonely  
Believing life was a only a tragic joke  
Have found with you the meaning of existence oh my love
