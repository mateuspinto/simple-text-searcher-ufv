You took her from my side  
The day you took her from me  
And you though that it would hurt my pride  
But there were things you failed to see  
  
You thought you stole away her love  
But I want the world to know  
Its the truth she turned her back on me  
But I was glad to let her go  
  
Yes you thought that you were foolin me  
And even though it wasnt right  
Let me thank you for you set me free  
From a lot of sleepless nights  
  
My love for her had died  
Yes it was over long ago  
And its true she walked away with you  
But I was glad to let her go  
  
Yes you knew that you were cheating me  
And even though it wasnt right  
Let me thank you for you set me free  
From a lot of sleepless nights  
  
My love for her had died  
Yes it was over long ago  
And its true she walked away with you  
But I was glad to let her go
