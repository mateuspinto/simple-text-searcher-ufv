These times have passed and gone  
Its time that we moved on  
Into a new tomorrow  
And leave behind the hurt  
The sorrow and the pain  
Cause tonight will never  
Pass this way again  
Wherever you are  
Wherever you go  
Wherever you stand  
Let your shadow show  
Whatever you think  
Whatever you do  
Whatever you want  
Let your feelings show  
These times have passed and gone  
Its time that we moved on  
Into a new tomorrow  
And leave behind the hurt  
The sorrow and the pain  
Cause tonight will never  
Pass this way again  
Cause tonight will never  
Pass this way again  
Just like the winter sun  
That hides behind the dawn  
Just like the shifting sands  
That ride upon the storm  
Tonight will never  
Pass this way again  
Cause tonight will never  
Pass this way again  
Cause tonight will never  
Pass this way again  
Cause tonight will never  
Pass this way again
