The bogus man is on his way  
As fast as he can run  
Hes tired but hell get to you  
And shoot you with his gun  
  
Focused his mind  
On something he cared about  
But it came out a shout  
Just like before  
  
The bogus man is at your heels  
Now clutching at your coat  
You must be quick now hurry up  
Hes scratching at your throat  
Concealed his doubt  
By skillful evasion  
  
But he couldnt find out  
About deception  
The bogus man is on his way  
As fast as he can run  
Hes tired but hell get to you  
And show you lots of fun
