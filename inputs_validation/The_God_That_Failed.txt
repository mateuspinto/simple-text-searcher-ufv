Pride you took  
Pride you feel  
Pride that you felt when youd kneel  
Not the word  
Not the love  
Not what you thought from above  
  
It feeds  
It grows  
It clouds all that you will know  
Deceit  
Deceive  
Decide just what you believe  
  
I see faith in your eyes  
Never your hear the discouraging lies  
I hear faith in your cries  
Broken is the promise betrayal  
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail  
Follow the god that failed  
  
Find your peace  
Find your say  
Find the smooth road in your way  
Trust you gave  
A child to save  
Left you cold and him in grave  
  
It feeds  
It grows  
It clouds all that you will know  
Deceit  
Deceive  
Decide just what you believe  
  
I see faith in your eyes  
Never you hear the discouraging lies  
I hear faith in your cries  
Broken is the promise betrayal  
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail  
Follow the god that failed  
  
I see faith in your eyes  
Broken is the promise betrayal  
The healing hand held back by the deepened nail  
Follow the god that failed  
  
Pride you took  
Pride you feel  
Pride that you felt when youd kneel  
Trust you gave  
A child to save  
Left you cold and him in grave  
  
I see faith in your eyes  
Never you hear the discouraging lies  
I hear faith in your cries  
Broken is the promise betrayal  
The healing hand held back by deepened nail  
Follow the god that failed  
Follow the god that failed  
  
Broken is the promise  
Betrayal betrayal yeah
