Break Up The Concrete  
  
There was a red brick road where I grew up on  
And a pretty stone wall round a fragrant lawn  
Fish in the pond that sparkled in the dawn  
But it aint no more its all gone gone gone  
  
Chorus  
Whoa  
Ram it Cram it Grand Slam it  
Break up the concrete Break up the concrete  
Prod it Sod it Metal Rod it  
Break up the concrete  
Thwak it Crack it Line back it  
Break up the concrete  
Shake it Bake it Earthquake it  
Break up the concrete  
  
And the depot over there right next to the tracks  
That the slaves put down while breaking their backs  
But those Texas zoo no would ever get into a carriage  
Or anything that might lead to an interracial marriage  
  
Chorus  
  
Now dont tell me its progress cause thats just a lie  
And dont even try to come with an excuse why  
We were so busy worrying about them dropping the bomb  
We didnt notice where our enemy was really coming from  
  
Hey boys cmon lets do it  
  
Ram it Cram it Grand Slam it  
Break up the concrete  
Prod it Sod it Metal Rod it  
Break up the concrete  
Shake it Bake it Earthquake it  
Break up the concrete  
  
Ram it Slam it Just cram it  
One more time  
Break up the concrete  
Break up the concrete  
  
Now he who laid it come back here and raid it
