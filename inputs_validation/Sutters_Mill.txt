In the Spring of Fortyseven  
So the story it is told  
Old John Sutter went to the mill site  
Found a piece of shining gold  
  
Well he took it to the city  
Where the word like wildfire spread  
And old John Sutter soon came to wish hed  
Left that stone in the river bed  
  
For they came like herds of locusts  
Every woman child and man  
In their lumbering Conestogas  
They left their tracks upon the land  
  
Chorus  
Some would fail and some would prosper  
Some would die and some would kill  
Some would thank the Lord for their deliverance  
And some would curse John Sutters Mill  
  
Well they came from New York City  
And they came from Alabam  
With their dreams of finding fortunes  
In this wild unsettled land  
  
Well some fell prey to hostile arrows  
As they tried to cross the plains  
And some were lost in the Rocky Mountains  
With their hands froze to the reins  
  
Oh  
  
Chorus  
  
Well some pushed on to California  
And others stopped to take their rest  
And by the Spring of Eighteensixty  
They had opened up the west  
  
And then the railroad came behind them  
And the land was plowed and tamed  
When Old John Sutter went to meet his maker  
Hed not one penny to his name  
  
Oh  
  
Chorus  
  
And some would curse John Sutters Mill  
Some mens thirsts are never filled
