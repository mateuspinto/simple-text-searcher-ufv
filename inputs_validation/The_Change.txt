One hand reaches out  
And pulls a lost soul from harm  
While a thousand more go unspoken for  
And they say  
What good have you done by saving just this one  
Its like whispering a prayer  
In the fury of a storm  
  
And I hear them saying  
Youll never change things  
And no matter what you do  
Its still the same thing  
But its not the world that I am changing  
I do this so this world will know  
That it will not change me  
  
This heart still believes  
That love and mercy still exist  
While all the hatreds rage  
And so many say  
That love is all but pointless  
in madness such as this  
Its like trying to stop a fire  
with the moisture of a kiss  
  
And I hear them saying  
Youll never change things  
And no matter what you do  
Its still the same thing  
But its not the world that I am changing  
I do this so this world will know  
That it will not change me  
  
As long long as one heart still holds on  
Then hope is never really gone  
  
And I hear them saying  
Youll never change things  
And no matter what you do  
Its still the same thing  
But its not the world that I am changing  
I do this so this world we know  
That it will not change me  
  
What I do is so this world will know  
That it will not change me
