Look through the people and on through the mist  
To the hill of the headless cross  
Where all witches meet on a night such as this  
And the power of darkness is host  
They come face to face eye to eye soul to soul  
With and Angel that fell from the sky  
Borne on the air the screams and the wails  
Of the masses appointed to die  
  
Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder  
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture  
At the Headless Cross at the Headless Cross  
  
From the first evil night when a black flash of light  
Cut the crucifix half to the ground  
Theres been no escape from the power of Satan  
On a nation so brave and so proud  
  
Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder  
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture  
At the Headless Cross at the Headless Cross  
  
How do you feel when the locks refuse the key  
And the master is calling your name  
Does the luck of the charm really keep you from harm  
Does the talisman protect you from pain  
  
Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder  
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture  
At the Headless Cross at the Headless Cross  
  
From the first evil night when a black flash of light  
Cut the crucifix half to the ground  
Theres no escaping the power of Satan  
On a nation so brave and so proud  
  
Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder  
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture oh no oh  
At the Headless Cross at the Headless Cross  
At the Headless Cross oh at the Headless Cross  
Where will you run to  
At the Headless Cross  
Look to the Headless Cross
