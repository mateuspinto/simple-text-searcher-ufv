The moon retreats behind a silver cloud  
As darkness throws its cloak towards the earth  
And mystery replaces what thought we knew  
  
To turn the stone to turn the stone  
The one dimension only shows one side  
But do we see the same through different eyes  
As you and I peer into lifes kaleidoscope  
  
To turn the stone to turn the stone  
Eternal sands of time shift endlessly  
Behind a veil of motionless disguise  
An eyelid flash is all it really seems to need  
  
To turn the stone to turn the stone  
To turn the stone to turn the stone
