I feel you trying  
Though in my heart  
I know youre lying  
And though your love  
For me is dying  
I see you crying  
  
Its the pain of your secret heart  
Bringing you to tears  
Filling you with fears  
For your mind and for your soul  
  
I touch you softly now  
Borne on by hope  
Until the end somehow  
I am a man and I must keep my vow  
I must go on  
  
But the wall of your secret heart  
Keeps my distance clear  
Helps my footsteps fall  
Back in line inside my mind  
  
Whats the use you turned me loose  
And left me here to cry  
Wheres the love we talked about  
Wheres my sunny sky  
  
Secret hearts and sorry tales  
Will never help love grow  
Spread your wings my daunted soul  
The time has come to go  
  
I will not be hurried down  
Or blackened by your lies  
I must go and find my dream  
And live in paradise
