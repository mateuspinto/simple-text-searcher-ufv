I woke up in the morning  
Heard a mockingbird sing  
Was he laughing at me  
I went to the basin  
Washed the sleep out my eyes  
So I could see  
A note on the bed  
Close to where my lover should be  
She slipped away in the night  
The writing was shaky  
And with tears on the sheets  
Im sorry we had a fight  
So farewell sweet lover farewell  
Im sorry we never said goodbye  
So farewell sweet lover farewell  
Left with a tear in your eye  
Mustve been brewing for a very long time  
In the wardrobe the hangers are bare  
Dont know how you did it  
It mustve been planned  
You even took your favorite chair  
So goodbye my lady goodbye  
You wont find no tear in my eye  
So goodbye my lady goodbye  
Going out tonight to get high  
Found myself at Charlies scene  
Drinking all fashions  
Sticky painted movie queen  
Winked her eye at me  
Thats how it happened  
Diamond shoes satin dress  
Flashin flashin flashin flashin  
Woke up in the morning  
Heard my mockingbird sing  
And it was singin for me  
The lady I met last nights  
Here by my side  
Shes good company  
Well hello sweet lady hello  
Good morning with a smile  
Well hello sweet lady hello  
This ladys gonna make it alright  
This ladys gonna make it alright  
This ladys gonna make it alright  
Lady lady  
This ladys gonna make it alright  
This ladys gonna make it alright  
This ladys gonna make it alright  
This ladys gonna make it alright
