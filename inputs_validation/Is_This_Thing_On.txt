Got your voicemail can you call me at a hotel  
Theres something thats weighting heavy on my heart  
And heavy on my chest  
Im the lone night youre the morning  
I annoy you and you bore me  
And its hard enough to make it through a Zone of enemies  
All in good time well be just fine  
Either way we need to be happy  
  
Chorus  
Tell me is this thing still on  
How do I keep it true  
How do I keep you into me  
Into me without faking it too  
What do we have to try  
When everything is too lose  
Cause it always is just me and you  
But its the hardest thing to do  
The hardest thing to do  
  
And I want you to want me like the first time you saw me  
I know in ten years Im betting my head is still young and dumb  
It would be so hard to let go and replace you I still love you  
I just wanna find the thing that made me think this was the one  
All in good time well be just fine  
Either way we need to be happy  
  
Chorus x2  
Tell me is this thing still on  
How do I keep it true  
How do I keep you into me  
Into me without faking too  
What do we have to try  
When everything is too lose  
Cause it always is just me and you  
But its the hardest thing to do  
The hardest thing to do
