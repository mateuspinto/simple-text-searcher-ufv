From the start Youve held a place in my heart  
A place that no one else could fill  
But sin kept Your spirit from working in me  
I couldnt look at life honestly  
Until the day my will gave away to the truth that I found in you  
I never knew just how good it could be  
To stand in Your presence totally free  
Now  
  
Im forgiven  
Now I have a reason for living  
Jesus keeps giving and giving  
Giving till my heart overflows  
Repeat  
  
Now I can see me as a person whos free  
Even when I slip and fall  
You are a God who forgives and forgets  
Now I want to give you my all  
Cause  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
I know this love You placed in my heart  
Is a love that will never depart  
Sin brought me here to the end of my rope  
But now youve given me a brand new hope  
Im forgiven
