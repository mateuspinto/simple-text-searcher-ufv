Ill see you in my dreams  
And then Ill hold you in my dreams  
Someone took you right out of my arms  
Still I feel the thrill of your charms  
  
Lips that once were mine  
Tender eyes that shine  
They will light my way tonight  
Ill see you in my dreams  
  
Yes I will see you in my dreams  
You know Ill hold you in my dreams  
I know that someone took you right out of my arms  
But still I feel the thrill of your charms  
  
I dream of lips that once were mine  
And those tender eyes that shine  
I know theyll light my way tonight  
When I see you in my dreams  
  
Yes they will light my way tonight  
Because Ill see you in my dreams
