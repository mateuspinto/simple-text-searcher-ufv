Earth is the loneliest planet of all  
Earth is the loneliest planet of all  
  
Day after day you say one day  
One day  
Day after day you say one day  
One day  
  
But youre in the wrong place and youve got the wrong face  
And humans are not really very humane  
And Earth is the loneliest planet of all  
  
Earth is the loneliest planet of all  
Live with a loneness that no one else knows  
  
Time after time you say next time  
Next time  
Time after time you say next time  
Next time  
  
But you fail as a woman and you lose as a man  
We do what we can  
And Earth is the cruelest place that you will never understand  
  
But youre in the wrong skin  
And the skin that youre in says  
Oh let it begin  
And Earth is the loneliest planet of all  
  
Earth is the loneliest planet of all  
Earth is the loneliest planet of all  
  
Day after day you say one day  
One day  
Day after day you say one day  
One day  
  
But theres always a reason why you refuse  
They always blame you you you  
And there is nothing anyone can do
