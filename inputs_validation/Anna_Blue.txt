Anna blue oh  
Anna blue oh  
Anna  
  
Not me not you  
Just time and a sigh  
On a line look in fine print  
The small town dream  
To be part of the scene  
You can wear it with a style  
In your eyes a story never spoken  
  
Anna blue oh  
Anne blue oh  
Anna  
  
Just me just you  
Just a wide eyed girl  
Turn around quick  
Im walkin my high heeled shoes  
And Ill be talkin pretty smooth  
Like some souped up cosmo girl  
In a stupifying world  
But before I fall I wake up crying  
Oh When I sit back  
Ill sigh and think
