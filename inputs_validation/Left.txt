I saw the river just pulled him down  
I knew the man who hunted him down  
We watched the river take him away  
Before he died I could have sworn he said  
I am the only one  
I am the only one left  
  
Tired and afraid lies a saddened man  
Knelt beside him with head in hand  
And escaped life here with a lonely breath  
But before he died I could have sworn he said  
  
I am the only one  
I am the only one left  
Who ever gave a damn about you  
I am sorry  
I am sorry  
I was wrong  
I was wrong  
Ive been wrong for way too long  
I am sorry that youre gone
