I looked  
I looked up to the sky  
Your face was drawn in black and white  
Tonight were stuck inside a lie  
The fear is we wont get out alive  
The stink is in the air  
The air is getting thin  
  
Where you goin  
As fast as you can run  
And where you goin  
You hide behind the sun  
Stay down low  
Stay down where you are  
And where you goin  
Is is better than here  
  
The truth  how we turned into a joke  
And its truth IMd give anything to hold  
Tonight tonight I stay  
But you you slip away  
  
Where you goin  
As fast as you can run  
And where you goin  
You hide behind the sun  
Stay down low  
Stay down where you are  
And where you goin  
Dont let them come after you  
  
I trip trip trip in vain  
I like to get a away  
You like it like you do  
I like to be with you  
I like to live up there  
But I wake up and I  
I wake up and I  
I wake up and Im here  
Tonight I am stuck here  
And tomorrow I  
I disappear  
  
And where you goin  
As fast as you can run  
And where you goin  
You hide behind the sun  
Stay down low  
And stay down where you are  
Cause its better there  
And its better than we thought
