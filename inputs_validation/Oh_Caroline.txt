Oh Caroline  
My life shined when you walked in  
Oh Caroline  
My world shined when you came in  
  
And if i go all over the world  
I wouldnt find another lover like you  
And if i knew a million girls Caroline  
  
Go to the end of the world for your love  
Go to the end of the world for your love  
  
Oh Caroline  
My heart shined when you came in  
Oh Caroline  
Life means more since you came in  
  
And if i go all over the world  
I wouldnt find another lover like you  
And if i knew a million girls Caroline  
  
go to the end of the world for your love  
go to the end of the world for your love  
go to the end of the world for your love love love oh Caroline  
go to the end of the world for your love  
  
Can you feel my heart strings  
Theyre on fire  
You threw it all away  
  
go to the end of the world oh Caroline oh Caroline  
go to the end of the world love love love love oh Caroline  
go to the end of the world love  
go to the end of the world for your love love
