Imagine a boy  
Kneeling by the window  
Lookin out across the driveway at the rain  
Will it always rain  
  
I remember the bells  
Comin from the churchyard  
And I thought they played their music just for me  
And day by day  
The rain turned to snow  
I dont hear them anymore  
  
The bells of Christmas  
Will ring for us again  
When we truly do believe  
What Christmas really means  
  
So light a candle  
That every man may see  
The world of hope and promise  
Like the one we knew back when and  
  
Well ring the bells of Christmas  
Once again  
  
There was a girl  
Lived around the corner  
With eyes as black as Marys must have been  
I wonder  
  
Does she miss her friend  
I remember the day  
All the bells were ringing  
As I watched her cross the churchyard in the snow  
  
And all my searching  
for all I lack  
Is just trying to get that feeling back  
  
The bells of Christmas  
Will ring for us again  
When we truly do believe  
What Christmas really means  
  
So light a candle  
That every man may see  
A world of hope and promise  
Like the one we knew back when and  
Well ring the bells of Christmas once again  
  
The future of the world they say  
Is in the childrens hands  
Perhaps if we could let them lead  
Wed come to understand  
  
The bells of Christmas  
Will ring for us again  
When we truly do believe  
What Christmas really means  
  
So light a candle that every man may see  
Like the one we knew back when and  
Well ring the bells of Christmas once again  
Well ring the bells of Christmas once again
