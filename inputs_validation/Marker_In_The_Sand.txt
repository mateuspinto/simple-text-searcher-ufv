There is a marker  
No one sees it cause the sand  
Has covered over all the messages it kept  
Misunderstanding what original truth was  
And out expanding in a faith but not in love  
  
What went wrong  
  
Walking tightrope high over moral ground  
Seeing visions of falling up somehow  
Do come down  
  
With the living let what is living love  
So unforgiving yet needing forgiveness first  
  
God what do you say  
  
Those undecided neednt have faith to be free  
And those misguided there was a plan for them to be  
Now you got both sides claiming killing in gods name  
But god is nowhere to be found conveniently  
  
What goes on  
  
Walking tightrope high over moral ground  
Walk the bridges before you burn them down  
Do come round  
  
With the living let what is living love  
Unforgiving yet needing forgiveness first  
  
God what do you say What do you say  
  
I feel a sickness A sickness coming over me  
Like watching freedom being sucked straight out to sea  
And the solution Well from me far would it be  
But the delusion is feeling dangerous to me  
  
What goes wrong  
  
Walking tightrope high over moral ground  
Seeing visions of falling up somehow  
Do come down  
  
With the living let what is living love  
Are forgiving yet needing forgiveness first  
  
What do you say God what do you say  
What do you say  
  
Calling out calling out  
Calling out calling out
