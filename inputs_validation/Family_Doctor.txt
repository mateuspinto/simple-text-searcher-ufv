Went to my family doctor  
For a pain inside my head  
Told him that since you left me  
I was feelin like just about dead  
Doctor what can you give me  
And should I take one or two  
Can you tell me just what its gonna do  
Will it save me from what Im goin through  
Will it ease the pain  
Will it ease the pain  
Will it help to pacify my brain  
He told me not to worry  
He said to come back next week  
He asked me for a picture  
Of the girl who made me lose my sleep  
Well all week long I suffered  
Didnt know what to do  
But went back to him when the week was  
Through  
And he gave me an artificial you  
And it eased the pain  
Yes it eased the pain  
It completely satisfied my brain
