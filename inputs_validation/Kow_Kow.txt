Kow kow calqulator  
Was a very smooth operator  
Had himself a pet alligator  
Kept it in a chrome elevator yeah  
When the sun began to shine  
The alligator come outside  
Kow kow played the chimes  
Together they would go for a ride  
As they travelled with a heavy load  
They came across a dead horse at the side of the road  
With two generals standing at each end  
Fighting over whose fault it had been  
And all thats left was this war  
And they couldnt get things back together like they were before  
Well listen  
Turn on your love light  
Turn it on let it shine  
Inside your heart  
Let it shine turn it on  
Your love light  
Turn it on  
Turn it on  
Let it shine  
Inside your mind  
So many times kow kow had heard it said before  
Oh dont lord dont go near that door  
The cause of our evil youll uncover  
Because of our misery you discover  
Well misery seeks its own company  
Kow kow had heard it said  
Now he sits there crying  
Oh with his hands across his head  
Kow kow calqulator  
Oh a very smooth operator  
Get back in your elevator  
Kow kow calqulator  
Turn on your love light  
Oh oh oh oh  
Let it shine
