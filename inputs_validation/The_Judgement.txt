The words are the thunder  
The thought is the lightning  
The telling of the tale is the storm  
The defendant must be guilty  
As he waits impatiently  
As the wooden stake is driven  
And the angel sounds the horn  
  
The cornered Lion is not within the realm of reason  
Fear is like the cracking of the lash  
You want to run you want to fight  
Lightning flashes in the night  
You finally turn away to hide your face  
As the judges file in to take their places  
  
You got to hold your ground  
Hold your ground like a man  
Sometimes youve just got to hold your ground  
When the truth has finally been tasted  
You can tell them all their time has not been wasted  
  
You got to hold your ground  
Hold your ground like a man  
Sometimes youve just got to hold your ground  
When the truth has finally been tasted  
You can tell them all their time has not been wasted
