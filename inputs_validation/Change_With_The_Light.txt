Change in the light  
Change with the light  turn turn turn around  
Change in the light change in the light  
  
Smile on my face like Dr Jekil and Mr Hide  
I am changing I changed with the light  
Ive been away running from reality  
Who am I am I an actor in this game  
  
Change with the light  
Turn turn turn around be my baby  
Stay for the night  
Do it right feel my vibrations  
Ill be changed with the light  
Feel my body talk be mine never stop  
Shake it right in the night  
Change in the light change in the light  
  
Morning has come as the sun catches my face  
I Realize that Im alone with myself  
Yesterday all was dark I was dancing on the floor  
In this light I am complete another me  
  
Change with the light  
Turn turn turn around be my baby  
Stay for the night  
Do it right feel my vibrations  
Ill be changed with the light  
Feel my body talk be mine never stop  
Shake it right in the night  
Change in the light change in the light  
  
Rocking to the beat while youre shaking my mind  
Change your mind  cause you are are mine  
Excited by your beauty makes me pull up a blind  
Hypnotized  its up my mind  
  
All the voices I cant resist my inside  
All the choices that the daylight brings  
Like a diamond sparkling and shining  
All the hours  
  
Stop dont stop the music  
Change in the light change in the light  
  
Oho change with the light  
Turn turn turn around be my baby  
Stay for the night do it right feel my vibrations  
Ill be changed with the light  
Feel my body talk be my neverstop  
Shake it right in the night  
Change in the light change in the light  
  
Change with the light  
Turn turn turn around be my baby  
Stay for the night do it right feel my vibrations  
Ill be changed with the light  
Feel my body talk be my neverstop  
Shake it right in the night  
Change in the light change in the light  
  
Change with the light  
Tell me what the daylight brings  
Stay for the night  
Do it right change with the light  
Oh change with the light  
Feel my body talk be my neverstop  
Shake it right in the night change with the light  
  
Change with the light  
Tell me what the daylight brings  
Stay for the night
