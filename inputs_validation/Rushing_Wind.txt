Rushing wind blow through this temple  
Blowing out the dust within  
Come and breathe you breath upon me  
Ive been born again  
  
Holy spirit I surrender take me where you want to go  
Plant me by your living water  
Plant me deep so I can grow  
  
Jesus youre the one who sets my spirit free  
Use me lord glorify your holy name through me  
Separate me from this world lord  
Sanctify my life for you  
Daily change me to your image  
Help me bear good fruit  
Every day youre drawing closer  
  
Trials come to test my faith  
But when all is said and done lord  
You know it was worth the wait  
Jesus youre the one who set my spirit free  
Use me lord glorify your holy name through me  
  
Rushing wind blow through this temple  
Blowing out the dust within  
Come and breathe you breath upon me  
For Ive been born again
