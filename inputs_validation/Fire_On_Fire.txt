He was a stranger in a little town  
She was sittin alone in a crowd  
Listening to the old jukebox playin a song  
From the moment we walked through the diner door  
She felt something like never before  
A feelin so strong right from the start  
It wouldnt stop  it was more than a spark  
  
Chorus  
Fire on fire they were burnin up  
Over a coffee cup under the table they touched  
Fire on fire in each others eyes they just had to try  
cause fire on fire just wont die  
  
It was gettin late but they had all night  
They sat there talkin bout their lives  
He was sellin she uas gettin ready to buy  
That ole neon light was glowin dim  
But he could see by the way she was lookin at him  
Tonight would be different somethin had changed  
His lonely heart was feelin a flame  
  
Repeat chorus  
Bridge  
She needed him he needed her  
And they both knew without a word  
There was no question there was no doubt  
There was no way they could put it out  
  
Fire on fire they were burnin up  
Over a coffee cup under the table they touched  
Fire on fire in each others eyes they just had to try  
cause fire on fire fire on fire  
Fire on fire just wont die
