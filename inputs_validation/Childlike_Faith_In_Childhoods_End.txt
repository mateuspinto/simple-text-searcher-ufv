Existence is a stage on which we pass  
a sleepwalk trick for mind and heart  
its hopeless I know  
but onward I must go  
and try to make a start  
at seeing something more than day to day  
survival chased by final death  
if I believed this the sum  
of the life to which weve come  
I wouldnt waste my breath  
Somehow there must be more There was a time  
when more was felt than known  
but now entrenched inside my sett  
in light more mundane  
thought rattles round my brain  
we live we dieand yet  
  
In the beginning there was order and destiny  
but now that path has reached the border  
and on our knees  
is no way to face the future whatever it be  
Though the forces which hold us in place  
last through eons in unruffled grace  
we too wear the face of creation  
  
As antimatter sucks and pulses periodically  
the bud unfolds the bloom is dead  
all space is living history  
It seems as though time must betray us  
yet were alive  
and though I see no God to save us  
yetl we survive  
through the centuries of progress  
which dont get us very far  
All illusion All is bogus   
we dont yet know what we are  
Laughing hoping praying joking Son of Man  
with lowered eyes but lifting hearts  
were grains of sand  
and though in time the sea  
may claim us for its own  
we are the rocks which root the future   
on us it grows  
  
We might not be there to share it  
if eternitys a jest  
but I think that I can bear it  
if the next life is the best  
Even if there is a heaven when we die  
endless bliss would be as meaningless as the lie  
that always comes as answer to the question  
Why do we see through the eyes of creation  
  
Adrift without a course  
its very lonely here  
our only conjecture  
what lies behind the dark  
Still I find I can cling to a lifeline  
think of a lifetime which means more  
than my own one   
dreams of a grander thing than we are  
Time and Space hang heavy on my shoulders  
when all life is over who can say  
no mutated force shall remain  
Though the towers of the city are denied  
to we men of clay  
still we know we shall scale  
the heights some day  
Frightened in the silence   
frightened but thinking very hard  
let us make computations of the stars  
  
Older wiser sadder blinder watch us run  
faster longer harder stronger now it comes  
colour blisters image splinters gravitate  
towards the centre in final splendour disintegrate  
The universe now beckons  
and Man too must take His place  
just a few last fleeting seconds  
to wander in the waste  
and the children who were ourselves move on  
reincarnation stills its now perfected song  
and at last we are free of the bonds of creation  
  
All the jokers and gaolers all the junkies  
and slavers too  
all the throng who have danced a merry tune   
human we can all be  
but Humanity we must rise above  
in the name of all faith and hope and love  
Theres a time for all pilgrims  
and a time for the fakers too  
theres a time when we all will stand alone  
and nude  
naked to the galaxies   
naked but clothed in the overview  
as we reach Childhoods End we must start anew  
  
And though dark is the highway  
and the peaks distance breaks my heart  
for I never shall see it still I play my part  
believing that what waits for us  
is the cosmos compared to the dust of the past  
In the death of mere humans life shall start
