Meant to tell you  
Tell you from the start  
Meant to show you  
Whats inside this shallow heart  
But I could not find the words  
Worthy enough to say  
  
I slipped along the way  
I slipped along the way  
  
Tried to be there  
Be there when you fall  
Tried to make you feel big  
When life makes you feel small  
But I could not find the steps  
Quickly enough to take  
  
I slipped along the way  
I slipped along the way  
  
Want to change things  
Want to clear the air  
Fix the things around us  
So badly in need of repair  
But I might not have the sense  
Sense enough to change  
  
I slipped along the way
