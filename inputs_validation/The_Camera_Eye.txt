Grimfaced and forbidding  
Their faces closed tight  
An angular mass of New Yorkers  
Pacing in rhythm  
Race the oncoming night  
They chase through the streets of Manhattan  
Headfirst humanity  
Pause at a light  
Then flow through the streets of the city  
  
They seem oblivious  
To a soft spring rain  
Like an English rain  
So light yet endless  
From a leaden sky  
  
The buildings are lost  
In their limitless rise  
My feet catch the pulse  
And the purposeful stride  
  
I feel the sense of possibilities  
I feel the wrench of hard realities  
The focus is sharp in the city  
  
Wideangle watcher  
On lifes ancient tales  
Steeped in the history of London  
Green and Grey washes  
In a wispy white veil  
Mist in the streets of Westminster  
Wistful and weathered  
The pride still prevails  
Alive in the streets of the city  
  
Are they oblivious  
To this quality  
A quality of light  
Unique to every citys streets  
  
Pavements may teem  
With intense energy  
But the city is calm  
In this violent sea
