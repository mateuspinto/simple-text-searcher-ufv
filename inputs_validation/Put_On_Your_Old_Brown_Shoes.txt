Put on your old brown shoes  
Right on your feet  
Time to move on get away  
You know you did your dues  
Did all you could  
Time to move on no more to say  
  
You and me were helpless cant you see  
Weve got to get away get away  
Got to move on  
Till the madness around is gone  
And the rest of our lives well be free  
  
Kick out the morning blues  
Who needs a job  
Who needs pain and oppression  
You know it cant be beat  
Stand on your own two feet  
Goodbye rain and depression  
  
You and me helpless cant you see  
Weve got to get away get away  
Got to move on catch the next train  
And well be gone  
And the rest of our lives well be free  
  
Get your blue jeans right on babe  
Get your blue jeans right on babe  
  
You know a friend is a friend  
You dont leave him in trouble  
He got a little drunk so now hes seeing double  
Dont you see him there yeah lying in the rubble  
But you have to lend a hand  
Cause you know hes on the level  
  
You and me were helpless cant you see  
Weve got to get away get away  
Got to move on catch the next train  
And well be gone  
And the rest of our lives well be free
