Back to life back to reality  
Back to the here and now oh yeah  
Show me how  
Decide what you want from me  
Tell me maybe I  
Could be there for you  
Oooh  
However do you want me  
However do you need me  
However do you want me  
However do you need me  
  
Back to life  
Back to the present time  
Back from a fantasy yeah  
Tell me now  
Take the initiative  
Ill leave it in your hands  
Until youre ready  
Heeey  
However do you want me  
However do you need me  
However do you want me  
However do you need me  
  
I live at the top of the block top of the block  
Theres no more room no more room no no no no  
For trouble or fuss  
Need a change  
A positive change  
Loook  its me writing on the wall  
However do you want me  
However do you need me  
  
Back to life  
Back to the day we had  
Lets play this foolish game  
Hear me out  
Dont let me waste away  
Make up your mind so  
I know where I stand  
However do you want me  
However do you need me
