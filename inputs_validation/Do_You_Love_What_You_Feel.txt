Chorus  
Do you love what you feel  
Cause I love what you do to me  
Do you love what you feel  
Cause I love what you do to me  
  
Babe when youre holdin me  
Somehow you seem to set me free  
And when I dance with you romance with you  
Is all I sing  
  
Chorus  
  
Ive spent so many nights  
Just taking fights within myself  
Until you came to me  
And held me like nobody else  
  
Chorus  
  
Tell me bout the way you like it  
Anything you want is right  
You and I are close together  
Your lovin gets me feeling better  
  
I wanna dance all  
I wanna dance all  
I wanna dance all night  
  
Everytime youre holdin me  
  
Chorus
