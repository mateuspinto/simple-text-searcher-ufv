Here we go  
  
I was working in the lab late one night  
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight  
When my monster from its slab began to rise  
And suddenly to my surprise  
  
He did the Mash he did the Monster Mash  
And its a graveyard smash  
He did the Mash it caught on in a flash  
He did the Mash he did the Monster Mash  
  
From my laboratory in the castle east  
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast  
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes  
To get a jolt from my electrodes  
  
He did the Mash he did the Monster Mash  
The Monster Mash and its a graveyard smash  
He did the Mash they caught on in a flash  
He did the Mash they did the Monster Mash  
  
Well the zombies were having fun  
The party had just begun  
The guests included the Wolfman  
Dracula and his son  
  
He did the mash  
The scene was rocking all were digging the sound  
Igor on chains backed by his baying hounds  
The Coffin Bangers were about to arrive  
With their vocal group The Crypt Keeper Five  
  
They did the Mash they did the Monster Mash  
The Monster Mash and its a graveyard smash  
He did the Mash they caught on in a flash  
He did the Mash they played the Monster Mash  
  
Now everything is cool Dracs a part of the band  
And my Monster Mash is the hit of the land  
For you the living this Mash was meant too  
When you get to my door tell them Only sent you  
  
Mash then you can Monster Mash  
He did the Mash and its a graveyard smash  
Then you can Mash youll catch on in a flash  
Then you can Mash then you can Monster Mash  
  
Whaoo  
Monster mash  
Monster mash  
Oh Monster mash  
Oh
