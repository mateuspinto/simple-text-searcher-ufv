I am the one your help Ive refused  
Your offering hand just set off the fuse  
I am the rock that pushes away  
I gave up tomorrow to spite today  
  
Too proud to beg  
Too stubborn to try  
Id look in your face  
And spit in your eye  
  
But Im willing to find whats really inside  
And show I am strong enough to  
  
Trust in you  
Trust in you  
Trust in you  
Pull me up  
Quo modo  shadow to light  
Quo modo  shadow to light  
Quo modo  pull me up  
Pull me up  
Cause I am ready  
  
I am the one who blames only you  
The flame in my eyes now blackens my view  
I am the one who wanders alone  
Darkness inside blocks how youve shone  
  
Who tied the other  
End of my rope  
I want to move on  
I want to have hope  
  
So Im willing to change  
Im going to try  
To show I am strong enough to
