All the times we slip  
Slither down the dark hole  
Fingers point from old windows  
An eerie shadow falls  
  
Walking on the spot  
Make sure that Im alive  
Moving every bone in my body  
From side to side  
  
Will we be in our minds when the dawn breaks  
Can we look the milkman in the eye  
The world is somehow different  
You have all been changed  
Before my very eyes  
  
Walk around your home  
And pour yourself a drink  
Fire one more torpedo baby  
Wash the kitchen sink  
  
Lounging on the sofa maybe  
See the living room die  
Dishes are unwashed and broken  
All you do is cry  
  
Will we be in our minds when the dawn breaks  
Can we look the milkman in the eye  
The world is somehow different  
You have all been changed  
Before my very eyes  
  
Dishes are unwashed and broken  
All you do is cry  
  
Will we be in our minds when the dawn breaks  
Can we look the milkman in the eye  
The world is somehow different  
You have all been changed  
Before my very eyes
