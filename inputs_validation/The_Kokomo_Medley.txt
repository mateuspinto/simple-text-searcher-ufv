When you get home baby  
Write me a few of your lines  
When you get home little baby  
Write me a few of your lines  
Thatll be consolation  
Lord Honey oh my worried mind  
  
Left my baby  
Standin in the back door cryin  
Well I left my little baby  
Standing in the back door cryin  
I never felt so sorry  
Lord Honey till he said goodbye  
  
Kokomo me baby  
Kokomo me right  
Kokomo your mama  
Shell be back tomorrow night  
Id like to cry in your arms tonight  
Baby dont you want to go  
Right on to Lemon Light City  
Sweet home Kokomo  
  
Go on down to the river baby  
Goin to sit down on the ground  
Well Im goin down to the river baby  
Goin to sit down on the ground  
And let the way of the water  
Lord Honey wash my troubles down  
  
Kokomo me baby  
Kokomo me right  
Kokomo your mama  
Shell be back tomorrow night  
I gotta cry with you baby  
Baby dont you want to go  
Right on to Lemon Light City  
Sweet home Kokomo
