There are stars in the southern sky  
Southward as you go  
There is moonlight and moss in the trees  
Down the Seven Bridges Road  
  
Now I have loved you like a baby  
Like some lonesome child  
And I have loved you in a tame way  
And I have loved you wild  
  
Sometimes theres a part of me  
Has to turn from here and go  
Running like a child from these warm stars  
Down the Seven Bridges Road  
  
There are stars in the southern sky  
And if ever you decide you should go  
There is a taste of thyme sweetened honey  
Down the Seven Bridges Road
