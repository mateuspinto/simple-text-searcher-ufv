Times were good  
She never thought about the future she just did what she would  
Oh but she really cared  
About her music it all seemed so important then  
  
And she dreamed that every time that she performed  
Everyone would cry for more  
That all she had to do was step into the light  
And everyone would start to roar  
  
And on the road  
Where all but a few fall by the wayside on the grassier verge  
She battled through  
Against the others in her world and the sleep and the odds  
  
But now every time that she performed  
Oh everybody cried for more  
Soon all she had to do was step into the light  
For everyone to start to roar  
And all the people cried youre the one weve waited for  
  
Oh but time went by  
It wasnt so easy now all uphill and not feeling so strong  
Yes times were hard  
Too much thinking bout the future and what people might want  
  
An then there was the time that she performed  
When nobody called for more  
And soon every time she stepped into the light  
They really let her know the score  
But she dreamed of the times when she sang all her songs  
And everybody cried for more  
When all she had to do was step into the light  
For everyone to start to roar  
And all the people cried youre the one weve waited for
