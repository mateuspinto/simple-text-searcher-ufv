Our little dream castle with every dream gone  
Is lonely and silent the shades are all drawn  
And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon  
A cottage for sale  
  
The lawn we were proud of is waving in hay  
Our beautiful garden has withered away  
Where you planted rosesthe weeds seem to say  
A cottage for sale  
  
From every single window I see your face  
But when I reach a window theres empty space  
The keys in the mail box the same as before  
But no one is waiting any more  
The end of the story is told on the door  
A cottage for sale
