Did I work on the battlefield  
Did I do what I thought was right  
Did I do all that I could do  
Did I put up a good fight  
  
Did I love all that I should  
To everyone in my sight  
What did I do with my life  
  
Did I exercise giving and forgiveness with all my might  
Did I honor my freedom and did I live in the light  
Did I cherish my moments  
Did I take a good enough bite  
What did I do with my life  
  
You can live any way you want to  
All you have to do is dance  
Achieve anything you thought of  
You just have to take the chance  
You can fall in love with your life  
Cause that truly is romance  
What did I do with my life  
  
Did I learn what I came to learn  
Did I listen with my heart  
Did I do what I came to do  
And how did I play the part  
Did I see all the beauty  
Because living is an art  
What did I do with my life  
  
You can live any way you want to  
All you have to do is dance  
Achieve anything you thought of  
You just have to take the chance  
  
Learn to love your life  
Cause that truly is romance  
Oh what did I do with my life  
what did I do  
say it again  
what did I do with my life  
Oh what did I do  
With my life  
What did I do  
What did I do
