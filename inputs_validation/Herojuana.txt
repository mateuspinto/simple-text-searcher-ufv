Light the match burn the flower  
Leave behind all the wrong why be  
Sad when happiness can be bought for  
A little more than free modern  
Day prohibition are we men are  
We children at what age can I  
Choose how to live the only real  
Drug problem is scoring real  
Good drugs havent we learned our lesson  
The corner store has the finest scotch  
But whos got uncut powder we  
Just want what is ours dignity  
If god created plants and buds  
That I find and abuse then  
Who the fuck are you to  
Judge me
