To my father what of your sons  
All of your children  
Even the ones  
Sent out to martyr  
To face the gun  
Precious bodies opposed to bombs  
  
Led on led on  
To take the path  
Where our bright future  
Is in our past  
  
To our father what of reason  
Say what you will  
Believe what you want  
The record shows what we are not  
Our true desires  
Not our good thoughts  
  
Led on led on  
To take the path  
Where our bright future  
Is in our past  
  
To my father what have you done  
To the children  
Born innocent  
But come to harm  
For dreams of glory  
And just a line in history  
  
Led on led on  
To take the path  
Where our bright future  
Is in our past  
  
To our father what good may come  
To let the children  
Walk alone  
To fear to fail  
And need no savior  
To be at peace in our true nature  
  
Lead on lead on  
Clear the path  
So our bright future  
May come to pass  
May come to pass  
May come to pass
