We will dance we will dance for Your glory  
We will dance we will dance for Your glory  
We will dance for Your glory Lord  
We will lift up a shout to adore You  
Every sound that we make it is for You  
We will dance for Your glory Lord  
  
For salvations in this place  
Youre the name by which were saved Jesus Jesus  
Let Your name be lifted high  
As our thankful hearts now cry Jesus Jesus  
  
Lift up your heads you ancient gates  
Be lifted up you ancient doors  
The King is coming in the King is coming in  
We lift up a shout to shake the skies  
Lift up a cry Be glorified  
The King is coming in the King is coming in  
  
Were the people of God with a song to sing  
And were bringing our lives as an offering  
We will dance for Your glory Lord  
And Your cross is the hope that we hold up high  
As we tell the whole world of Your love and life  
We will dance for Your glory Lord
