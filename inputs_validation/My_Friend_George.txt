Read in the paper bout a man killed with a sword  
and that made my think of my friend George  
People said the man was five foot six  
sounds like George with his killing stick  
  
Hey bro whats the word  
talkin bout my friend George  
Hey bro whats the word  
talkin bout my friend George  
You talkin bout my friend George  
  
I knew George since hes eight  
I always thought that he was great  
And anything that George would do  
you know that I would do it too  
  
George liked music and George liked to fight  
he worked out in a downtown gym every night  
Id spar with him when work was done  
we split lips but it was all in fun  
  
Hey bro whats the word

Hey bro whats the word

Next thing I hear Georges got this stick  
hes using it for more than kicks  
I seen him down at Smalleys bar  
he was wired up I tried to calm him down  
  
Avenge yourself he says to me  
avenge yourself for humanity  
Avenge yourself for the weak and the poor  
stick it to these guys right through their heads  
  
Well the fight is my music the stick is my sword  
and you know that I love you so please dont say a word  
Cant you hear the music playing the anthem its my call  
and the last I seen of George was him  
running through the door I says   
  
Hey bro whats the word
