Its all there in the gospels the Magdalene girl  
Comes to pay her respects but her mind is awhirl  
When she finds the tomb empty the stone had been rolled  
Not a sign of a corpse in the dark and the cold  
When she reaches the door sees an unholy sight  
Theres this solitary figure in a halo of light  
He just carries on floating past Calvary Hill  
In an almighty hurry aye but she might catch him still  
  
Tell me where are ye going Lord and why in such haste  
Now dont hinder me woman Ive no time to waste  
For theyre launching a boat on the morrow at noon  
And I have to be there before daybreak  
Oh I canna be missing the ladsll expect me  
Why else would the good Lord himself resurrect me  
For nothing will stop me I have to prevail  
Through the teeth of this tempest in the mouth of a gale  
May the angels protect me if all else should fail  
When the last ship sails  
  
Oh the roar of the chains and the cracking of timbers  
The noise at the end of the world in your ears  
As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea  
And the last ship sails  
  
Its a strange kind of beauty  
Its cold and austere  
And whatever it was that yeve done to be here  
Its the sum of yer hopes yer despairs and yer fears  
When the last ship sails  
  
Well the first to arrive saw these signs in the east  
Like that strange moving finger at Balthazars Feast  
Where they asked the advice of some wandering priest  
And the sad ghosts of men whom theyd thought long deceased  
And whatever got said theyd be counted at least  
When the last ship sails  
  
Oh the roar of the chains and the cracking of timbers  
The noise at the end of the world in your ears  
As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea  
And the last ship sails  
  
And whatever youd promised whatever youve done  
And whatever the station in life youve become  
In the name of the Father in the name of the Son  
And whatever the weave of this life that youve spun  
On the Earth or in Heaven or under the Sun  
When the last ship sails
