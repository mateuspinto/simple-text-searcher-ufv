Take me through the centuries to supersonic years  
Electrifying enemy is drowning in his tears  
All I have to give you is a love that never dies  
The symptom of the universe is written in your eyes  
  
Mother moon shes calling me back to her silver womb  
Father of creation takes me from my stolen tomb  
Seven hundredth unicorn is waiting in the skies  
A symptom of the universe a love that never dies  
  
Take my hand my child of love come step inside my tears  
Swim the magic ocean Ive been crying all these years  
With our love well ride away into eternal skies  
A symptom of the universe a love that never dies  
  
Woman child of loves creation come and step inside my dreams  
In your eyes I see no sadness you are all that loving means  
Take my hand and well go riding through the sunshine from above  
Well find happiness together in the summer skies of love
