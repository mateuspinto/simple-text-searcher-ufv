The first time I saw her  
She was wearing scarves of white  
That little spark between us  
Took only seconds to ignite  
And then it occurred to me  
Suddenly I was standing there alone  
On the Spanish steps of Rome  
  
I kept searching through the ally  
Searching through the catacombs that night  
I closed my eyes and threw a coin in the fountain  
Then I looked and she was nowhere in sight  
I wandered through the holy city  
Like a beggar beneath the moon lit dome  
Near the Spanish steps of Rome  
  
I heard a voice as I looked through my fingers  
And saw the old monsignor  
He gave me his blessing and said  
Dont try and please her  
And then I heard her singing like some diva  
Parched upon her throne  
On the Spanish steps of Rome  
  
Now I know I should have listened  
When he warned me not to follow  
I noticed that the statues eyes  
Were all sunken and hollow  
She let hose young wolves do the dirty deeds  
While she lay there inside her home  
On the Spanish steps of Rome
