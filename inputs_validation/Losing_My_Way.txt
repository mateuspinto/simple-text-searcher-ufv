Hey excuse me  
  
Hi my name is Bob and I work at my job  
I make fortysomething dollars a day  
I used to be the man in my hometown  
Till I started to lose my way  
  
It all goes back to when I dropped out of school  
Having fun I was living the life  
But now I got a problem with that little white rock  
See I cant put down the pipe  
  
And its breaking me down  
Watching the world spin round  
While my dreams fall down  
Is anybody out there  
  
It is breaking me down  
No more friends around  
And my dreams fall down  
Is anybody out there  
  
Bridge  
Can anybody out there hear me  
Cause I cant seem to hear myself  
Can anybody out there see me  
Cause I cant seem to see myself  
Theres gotta be a heaven somewhere  
Can you save me from this hell  
Can anybody out there feel me  
Cause I cant seem to feel myself  
  
Chorus  
Losing my way  
Keep losing my way  
Keep losing my way  
Can you help me find my way  
Losing my way  
Keep losing my way  
Keep losing my way  
Can you help me find my way  
  
Now you gotta understand I was a family man  
I would have done anything for my own  
But I couldnt get a grip on my new found itch  
So I ended up all alone  
I remember where I was when I got my first buzz  
See I thought I was living the life  
And the craziest thing is  
Ill probably never know the color of my daughters eyes  
  
And it is breaking me down  
Watching the world spin round  
While my dreams fall down  
Is anybody out there  
  
It is breaking me down  
No more friend around  
And my dreams fall down  
Is anybody out there  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh my god please forgive me  
Father hear my prayer  
Cause I know Ive done some wrong in this life  
If I could do it all again  
Have just one more chance  
To take all those wrongs and make them right  
  
Bridge x2  
  
Chorus
