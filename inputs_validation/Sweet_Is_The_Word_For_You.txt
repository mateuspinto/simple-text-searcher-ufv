Sweet you in the moonlight  
Sweet is the word for you  
For all that you have done for me  
The one for me is you  
  
Sweet you in the starlight  
Sweet is the word for you  
But all the stars that glow above  
Seem to know of my love for you  
  
Because of you the wind is wine tonight  
My heart sings with evry beat  
Are you a dream here in the moonlight  
Sweet is the word for you  
  
And yet you seem divine tonight  
Youre mine tonight  
My Sweet
