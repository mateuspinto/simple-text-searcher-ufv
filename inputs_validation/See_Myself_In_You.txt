If I met you on the corner  
Would I know you as you are  
Would I take you for a stranger  
And brush past you in the door  
If you called me would I hear you  
Or would I walk away too soon  
If I lingered for a moment  
Would I see myself in you  
If I fought you as a soldier  
If I had you in my sights  
Would you ask me to remember  
Who imagined I was right  
If you witnessed my surrender  
Do I know what I would do  
If you held me like my brother  
Would I see myself in you  
Well I dreamed my end was near  
I was almost gone  
If I dream that dream from here  
Can I still come home  
If you called me would I hear you  
Do I know what I would do  
If you held me like my father  
Would I see myself in you  
If you held me like my mother  
Would I see myself in you
