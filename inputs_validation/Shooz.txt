Well its Friday night and the streets  
Are full of the weekends with their green  
Soldier boys looking left and right  
At all the sights there to be seen  
Well you can be theres a loaner  
Whod love to see you be so sweet  
Thats why Im telling you to get on  
Your shoes and get out there on the street  
  
And get your rockin  
Rock n Roll Shooz  
Up and down around they go with  
Their heads turning all around  
Way down there on the corner  
Theres a Cadillac thats easy to be found  
Way down there in Chicago down  
  
Along Division street  
The boys are just looking for a girl  
Like you to make their stay in town a treat  
  
So get your rockin  
Rock n Roll Shooz  
They all love it baby they keep  
Comin back for more  
Rock n Roll Shooz
