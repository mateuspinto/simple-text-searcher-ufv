I got a guy I like him fine  
But he takes me for granted all of the time  
To teach him a lesson make him mad  
I went out on a date with the best friend he had  
That made him mad boy hot dog that made him mad  
And he hugged me and he kissed me and he asked me not to do it again  
  
Oh late last night when I came in  
He demanded to know just where Id been  
But I really put him right in his place  
Instead of an answer I laughed in his face  
That made him mad boy hot dog that made him mad  
And he hugged me and he kissed me and he asked me not to do it again  
  
He said my heart is on my sleeve  
And if I didnt change that he would leave  
Well you shouldve seen him was his face red  
When I laughed and told him just go right ahead  
That made him mad boy hot dog that made him mad  
So he hugged me and he kissed me and he asked me not to do it again  
  
Well the moral is to play it cool  
Let your guy know youre nobodys fool  
When he gets to thinking youre all his own  
Let him know that you can take him or leave him alone  
That makes him mad boy hot dog that makes him mad  
And hell hug you and hell kiss you and ask you not to do it again  
  
Yeah hell hug you and hell kiss you and hell squeeze you and please you  
And ask you not to do it again
