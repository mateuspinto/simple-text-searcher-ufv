Animation  
Breathes a cloudless mind  
Fascination  
Leaves the doubting blind  
Until the circle breaks and wisdom lies ahead  
The faithful live Awake  
The rest remain misled  
  
Some will transcend spinning years  
One as if time disappears  
  
Innocence faded  
The mirror falls behind you  
Trinity jaded  
I break down walls to find you  
  
Callow and vain  
Fixed like a fossil shrouding pain  
Passionless stage  
Distant like brothers  
Wearing apathetic displays  
Sharing flesh like envy in cages  
Condescending  
Not intending to end  
  
Some will transcend spinning years  
One as if time disappears  
  
Innocence faded  
The mirror falls behind you  
Trinity jaded  
I break down walls to find you  
  
Beginnings get complicated  
The farther we progress  
Opinions are calculated  
Immune to openness  
  
Beyond the circles edge  
Were driven by her blessings  
Forever hesitating  
Caught beneath the wheel  
  
Innocence faded  
The mirror falls behind you  
Cynically jaded  
The child will crawl to find you
