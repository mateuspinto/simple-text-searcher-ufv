Im standing standing in for Joe  
  
Joe called round to ask me Would I do a favor  
While hes gonna be out of town  
He says his girl needs company she gets so restless  
Would I keep her safe and sound  
  
Softly softly in the night  
Why you can guess the rest  
Now these shoes fit all too well  
  
Standing in for Joe  
Standing in for Joe  
Im standing  in for Joe  
  
Joe said weve been friends so long  
That I would be the one he would trust with his life  
And now those words roll round my brain  
As darkness falls as I turn out his bedroom light  
  
Who could resist her tender charms  
So the story goes  
This actor he plays all the parts  
  
Standing in for Joe  
Standing in for Joe  
Im standing  in for Joe  
  
Love is like a river  
You cannot stop its flow Mmm hmm  
  
Joe called round to ask me Would I do a favor  
While hes gonna be out of town  
He says his girl needs company she gets so restless  
Would I check that shes safe and sound  
  
Softly softly in the night  
Why you can guess the rest  
Now these shoes fit all too well  
Standing in for Joe
