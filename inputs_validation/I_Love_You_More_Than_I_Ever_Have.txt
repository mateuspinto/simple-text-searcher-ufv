Dont you know Im about as happy as I can be  
Cause you made a happy man out of me  
You took a man wso was tired of living  
And installed the joy of life whit all that youre giving  
And you came along in just a nick of time  
Cause I was just about to lose my mind  
The frown upon my face became a smile  
And I love you more than I ever have  
Chorus  
Oh I want to thank you baby  
For what youve done for me  
Oh I want to thank you baby  
For helping me to see  
That love is powerfull and what everybody needs  
And I thenk you for givin it to me  
I had just fell out of love when I met you  
Really did belive that love and were through  
But I knew it right from the first time I kissed you  
I felt your lips and could not resist ya  
Ever since that kiss Ive been in love whit you  
Cause you been so good to me and so true  
Weve stood together through thick and thin  
And I love you more than I ever have  
Chorus  
Theres a certain way that you say I love you  
Makes me want to lay down my life for you  
You change my outlook on life and love  
When it comes to you I just connot get enough of you girl  
I just want this one thing understood  
All I want to do is make ya feel good  
And youve been so doggone good to me I say  
That I love you more then I ever have  
The love is powerfull and everybody needs  
And I thank you for giving it to me  
Chorus
