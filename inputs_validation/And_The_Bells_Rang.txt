Caroling caroling now we go  
Christmas bells are ringing  
Caroling caroling through the snow  
Christmas bells are ringing  
  
And the bells rang and the children sang  
It was Christmas everywhere  
  
They took some holly took some mistletoe  
Found a wind free night sprinkled it with snow  
Found some reindeers and a reindeer sleigh  
And a shiny start to show the way  
  
They found some tinsel bright and glittery  
Where the candy came on a tiny tree  
All the happy songs the children sing  
And some jingle bells that ring ring ring  
  
And the bells rang  
And the bells rang  
And the children sang  
And the children sang  
There was music in the air  
  
And the bells rang  
And the bells rang  
And the children sang  
And the children sang  
It was Christmas everywhere  
  
And the bells rang  
They found some stories children love to hear  
And the children sang  
Filled with stockings full of Christmas cheer  
  
Found three wise men all traveling  
Found the wise wise men and a new born king  
  
And the bells rang  
And when they finished trimming every tree each  
And the children sang  
The bells begin to ring oh so merrily  
It was Christmas everywhere  
Tell the world we found a way  
To put together merry Christmas day  
  
And the bells rang  
And the bells rang  
And the children sang  
And the children sang  
There was music in the air  
  
And the bells rang  
And the bells rang  
And the children sang  
And the children sang  
It was Christmas everywhere
