Long time ago when I was a young  
Boy  
I saw that movie Mutiny on theBounty  
Starring my idol Marlon Brando  
And I felt a yearning for that  
Great adventure  
So many nights I woke up out of adream  
A dream of blue seas white sands  
Paradies birds butterflies and  
Beautiful warmhearted girls  
  
Sun of Jamaika the dreams of  
Malaika  
Your love is my sweet memory  
  
Sun of Jamaika Blue Lady Malaika  
Someday Ill return wait and see  
Walk in the sand and Im happy  
With you  
We shall be loving and true  
Oh I sure love Malaika  
With all of my heart  
I will always be faithful and true  
Yeah true  
But now as I grew older  
The burning desire became so strong  
That I bought a tiket to fly home  
And then I found you  
And we found an eternal love  
Right from the beginning  
The stars falling down from the Lagoon of gold  
The palms swaying under the moon  
We were swimming out into the  
Crystal sea  
In that fateful night I thought to  
Myself  
Ill do everthing I can save  
Every dime  
And one day Ill return  
And then Ill stay forever forever  
  
Sun of Jamaika the dreams of  
Malaika  
Your love is my sweet memory  
Sun of Jamaika Blue Lady Malaika  
Someday Ill return wait and see  
Walk in the sand and Im happy  
With you  
We shall be loving and true  
Oh I sure love Malaika  
With all of my heart  
I will always be faithful and true  
Yeah true
