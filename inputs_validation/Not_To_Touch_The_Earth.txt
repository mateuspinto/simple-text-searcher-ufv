Not to touch the earth  
Not to see the sun  
Nothing left to do but  
Run run run  
Lets run  
Lets run  
House upon the hill  
Moon is lying still  
Shadows of the trees  
Witnessing the wild breeze  
Cmon baby run with me  
Lets run  
Run with me  
Run with me  
Run with me  
Lets run  
The mansion is warm at the top of the hill  
Rich are the rooms and the comforts there  
Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs  
And you wont know a thing till you get inside  
Dead presidents corpse in the drivers car  
The engine runs on glue and tar  
Come on along not goin very far  
To the East to meet the Czar  
Run with me  
Run with me  
Run with me  
Lets run  
Whoa  
Some outlaws lived by the side of a lake  
The ministers daughters in love with the snake  
Who lives in a well by the side of the road  
Wake up girl were almost home  
Ya cmon  
We should see the gates by mornin  
We should be inside the evenin  
Sun sun sun  
Burn burn burn  
Soon soon soon  
Moon moon moon  
I will get you  
Soon Soon Soon  
I am the Lizard King  
I can do anything
