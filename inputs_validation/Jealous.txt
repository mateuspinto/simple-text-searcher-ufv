Said Im jealous  
  
I said I wish my hands could do  
What that dress is doing  
Holding it tight  
As your bodys moving  
And the way that glass of wine  
Can ease your mind and soothe ya  
said ooh baby Im gonna do it to ya  
  
From the wind that blows by  
Smell of a scent of your perfume  
To the sun that touches your skin  
On a Sunday afternoon  
Im jealous  
  
I said you got me jealous of everything  
Everything that gets to know to you Baby  
Said you got me jealous of everything  
Because nothing loves you like I do  
I said nothing loves you like I do  
  
Said I wish my thoughts could be  
Could be inside your head  
And make you think of me and you  
In your bed  
Tattoo on your waistline  
Ooh what I wouldnt do  
Said what I wouldnt give to be a permanent part of you  
Oh oh  
  
From the wind that blows by  
To the smell of a scent of your perfume  
To the sun that touches your skin  
On a Sunday afternoon
