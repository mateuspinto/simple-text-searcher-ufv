Its been such a long day so you better hurry home  
Lit all my incense and I wish you were home  
Only five minutes and you walk through my door  
  
Be here in the morning  
Be here in the evening  
Be here and make my life full  
  
Be here in the morning  
Be here in the evening  
Be here and make my life  
  
Stay here on the weekend and unplug the phone  
alright then  
No calls from Korthoff Parks or Grillo  
I only hope that you come here alone  
  
Be here in the morning  
Be here in the evening  
Be here and make my life full  
  
Be here in the morning  
Be here in the evening  
Be here and make my life  
  
Be here in the morning  
Be here in the evening  
Be here and make my life
