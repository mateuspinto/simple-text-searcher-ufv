Oh dancin all night so I have my play  
But how can I work when I sleep all day  
I got those rock n roll blues those rock n roll blues  
I dig way down deep in my ol blue jeans  
To put my last dime in that record machine  
I got those rock n roll blues those rock n roll blues  
I have the blues to fight  
And to make things worse I fell in love last night  
The little girl I found  
Said to stop my hoppin and settle down  
Oh why cant there be two of poor o1 me  
One on the dancefloor and one hangin round the door  
I got those rock n roll blues those rock n roll blues
