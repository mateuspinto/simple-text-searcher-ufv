When I look back  
On everything Ive done  
I know you must have cried  
A river of tears  
But you were there  
When I was feeling low  
To walk me through my darkest fears  
  
So when the sun goes down  
An those nights grow colder  
I will be there  
Looking over your shoulder  
  
An the deeper the love  
The stronger the emotion  
An the stronger the love  
The deeper the devotion  
  
There were times  
I almost let you go  
When I thought I needed to break free  
But you were there  
To whisper in my ear  
Why dont you share my dreams with me  
  
So when the sun goes down  
An those nights are growing colder  
I will be there  
Looking over your shoulder  
  
An the deeper the love  
The stronger the emotion  
An the stronger the love  
The deeper the devotion  
  
I dont mind what youre doing to me  
I dont mind cause youre all I can see  
I dont mind baby you mean the world to me  
  
When the sun goes down  
An those nights are growing colder  
I will be there  
Looking over your shoulder baby baby baby  
  
So When the sun goes down  
An those nights are growing colder  
I will be there  
Looking over your shoulder  
  
Cause the deeper the love  
The stronger the emotion  
An the stronger the love  
The deeper the devotion  
  
I never gonna let you go  
In my heart I know  
I love you I love you  
Oh baby I really love you
