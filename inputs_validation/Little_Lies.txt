If I could turn the page  
In time then Id rearrange  
Just a day or two  
Close my close my close my eyes  
  
But I couldnt find a way  
So Ill settle for one day  
To believe in you  
Tell me tell me  tell me lies  
  
Tell me lies  
Tell me sweet little lies  
Tell me lies tell me tell me lies  
Oh no no you cant disguise  
You cant disguise no you cant disguise  
Tell me lies  
Tell me sweet little lies  
  
Although Im not making plans  
I hope that you understand  
Theres a reason why  
Close your close your close your eyes  
  
No more broken hearts  
Were better off apart  
Lets give it a try  
Tell me tell me tell me lies  
  
Tell me lies  
Tell me sweet little lies  
Tell me lies tell me tell me lies  
Oh no no you cant disguise  
You cant disguise no you cant disguise  
Tell me lies  
Tell me sweet little lies
