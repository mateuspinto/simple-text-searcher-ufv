The first bite of the apple made Eve smart  
The second bite taught her how to break mens hearts  
The third bite taught her how to strut her stuff  
But she never got to the fourth bite that says   
Enough is enough  
  
Enough is enough Ive had enough of you  
You can keep your dresses you can keep your jewels  
You can keep the color TV those soaps just make me sick  
All Im asking you leave me is my little red joystick  
  
My red joystick my red joystick  
All Im asking you leave me is my little red joystick  
My red joystick my red joystick  
All Im asking you leave me is my little red joystick  
  
Eve kissed Able thats how he got murdered by Cain  
Abraham gave up his son to keep his wife away  
And even the Load almighty speaking from the trenches to the pits  
Spoke for all of mankind when he said  
  
Take the Porsche take the kids take the stocks  
Take the rugs take those roses from my poor heart wilting  
But please please please  
  
Leave me my red joystick leave me my red joystick  
Leave me my red joystick leave me my red joystick  
  
Eve drank apple cider Eve brewed good apple wine  
Eve cooked up stewed apples knew how to have a good time  
She came into the bathroom raised her skirts up high  
She said If a little knowledge is a dangerous thing baby  
Give me a piece before I die  
  
Hey Eve take a bite of my apple  
I know you think youre pretty slick  
The one thing I ask you to leave me is my red joystick  
  
My red joystick my red joystick  
All Im asking you leave me is my little red joystick  
My red joystick my red joystick  
All Im asking you leave me is my little red joystick  
My red joystick
