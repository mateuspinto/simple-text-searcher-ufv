My home is Colorado  
With their proud mountains tall  
Where the rivers like gypsys  
Down her black canyons fall  
Im a long long way from Denver  
With a long way to go  
So lend an ear to my singing  
Cause Ill be back no more  
  
I left as a young man  
Not full seventeen  
With nothin for company  
But the wind and a dream  
Bout all the fast ladies  
And livin Id find  
When I left my proud mountains  
And rivers behind  
  
So I rolled and arambled  
Like a leaf in the wind  
Well I found my fast ladies  
And some hard livin men  
Well I sometimes went hungry  
With my pockets all bare  
Lord I sometimes had good luck  
With money to spare  
  
I made me some friends Lord  
That I wont soon forget  
Some are down under  
And some are rambling yet  
But as for me  
Im headed for home  
Back to high Colorado  
Never more for to roam  
  
So friends when my time comes  
As surely it will  
You just carry my body  
Out to some lonesome hill  
And lay me down easy  
Where the cool rivers run  
With only my mountains  
Tween me and the sun  
  
My home is Colorado
