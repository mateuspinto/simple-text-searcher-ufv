I really tried my hardest just to make you understand  
It feels like to a boy when he dont feel like a man  
But you gave me so much money  
And you would not understand  
I realize I hurt you so I stay just as I am  
  
Chorus  
But the whole world keeps on turnin  
Yes the whole world keeps on turnin  
But the whole world keeps on turnin  
I just roll along  
  
Theres been too many mornings  
And one too many years  
Once went by the big ones who just cant take the pace  
We found out the hard way  
I hope you understand  
That my life is just my head  
And I had an overdose  
  
Chorus  
  
I used to try I used to try  
Used to cry oh I used to cry  
  
Chorus
