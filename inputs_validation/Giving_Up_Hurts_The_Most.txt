Angels mourn crying praying for your soul  
As my eyes open from their state of sleep I feel my blood  
Turn into a frozen river  
Nightmares so close death was in the air  
My heart locked shut and I gave you the key  
Promise never to leave  
As lies hold me emptiness fills my broken heart  
Screaming your name hoping for a response silence summer  
Drowned by winter  
To look in your face and realized the time we spent the chances I  
Had have drifted away from my fingertips  
Your life your thoughts your dreams your love  
Never tried my hardest and now I cray as the hurt enters  
I love you and I still love you  
Even though I never showed it  
A piece of me is gone forever  
Clutching memories held so close  
Repeating words of love spoken to late  
My eyes look all around but all they can focus on is you  
For in you I find me  
Days past by and thy death still lingers  
This coldness will never satisfy me  
I want to be surrounded by angels in a place  
Where the sun is so warm it burns my insides  
Surrounded by angels  
Where love takes my darkest depressions  
And throws it into the deepest of sea  
A place I can call home Im crying to you Jesus  
Mend me break me make me  
Youre all Ive got now  
My eyes look all around but all they can focus on is you  
For in you I find me  
Arewell my friend your time has come  
And never will I be able to tell you I love you again
