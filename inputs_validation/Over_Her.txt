You know I been trying to figure out  
Just whats going on  
Am I over her  
I been doing a lot of thinking lately  
Am I over her  
And Im really missing you  
  
Its been 3 months 3 hours 3 days  
Since the last time I seen your pretty face  
My decision to bring this to an end  
And Im caught up in reminscing  
Having faithful visions of long walks long talks  
Play fights late nights  
Its been on my mind since Valentines  
Cause I had your heart and I let it slide  
  
I ask myself time and time again again Im trying to comprehend that  
Unanswered questions still things to be are meant to end  
  
Am I over her am I over her  
Am I over her  
Am I over her  
Tell me am I really over my my love am I over her  
I cant think straight  
Cause Im too busy thinking of her  
Am I really over my love  
  
I was going through some things that I couldnt explain  
Now my situations taking a big change  
They say the grass is greener on the other side of town  
Now Im kinda wishing you would come back around  
Is she sad or is she mad  
Does she have a new man does she have it like that  
Its been so long thought I wouldve moved on  
Couldve been strong and picked up the telephone  
  
I ask myself time and time again again Im trying to comprehend that  
Unanswered questions still things to be are meant to end  
  
Am I over her am I over her  
Am I over her  
Am I over her  
Tell me am I really over my my love am I over her  
I cant think straight  
Cause Im too busy thinking of her  
Am I really over my love  
  
Its water under the bridge  
But I cant seem to forget  
All the plans we made all the time we spent  
Makes me reminisce  
I still see your face  
All this love I cant replace  
Am I over am I over  
Am I over her her now
