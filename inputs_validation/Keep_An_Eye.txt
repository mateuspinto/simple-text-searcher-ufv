Keep an eye  
Keep an eye  
Keep an eye  
On your close friend  
  
Keep an eye  
Keep an eye  
Keep an eye  
On your close friend  
  
Cause what you got thatll make you lose  
And then turn around and step in your shoes  
I say theyll turn around  
And step in your shoes  
  
I stood there numb  
Watchin my friend walk away  
With my love on her arm  
  
Oh what she said was  
Sorry for what I had to do  
But you see I love him just as much as you  
  
Keep an eye  
Keep an eye  
On your close friend  
  
Keep an eye  
Keep an eye  
You better watch out  
For your close friend  
  
The devils workshop is a busy place  
On top of evil theres an innocent face  
Oh on top of evil he puts an innocent face  
She was just like a spider  
Only twice as smart  
  
Kindness was a thread  
She used to weave my world apart  
There were three of us seen all over town  
Now theres only two  
Someones missing  
Guess who  
  
Now I see how she schemed  
And worked her way in between  
Planted seeds of mistrust  
To make us fight unaware  
Her comforting ways when I would cry  
Shadowed the look of triumph in her eye  
Just like a snake on the limb tree  
A friend is an enemy you can see  
  
Cause what you got thatll make you lose  
And then turn around and step in your shoes  
I said theyll turn around  
And step in your shoes  
  
So you better keep an eye on your close friend  
You better watch out for your close friend  
Dont trust nobody  
Dont trust nobody  
Keep an eye on your close friend  
Keep an eye  
Dont trust nobody  
Keep an eye on your close friend  
You better watch out for your close friend  
She was just like a spider  
Only twice as smart
