Waiting for your piece of the pie  
To drop out of the skygotta go get it  
Hesitating for somebody else  
To run and pass you bynever get your time  
  
Bridge  
There aint no excuse for losing your feet  
Drowning in your defeat on this road of life  
There aint no excuse for coming up short the ball is in your court  
So reach up and touch the sky  
  
Chorus  
Are you doing your thing and doing it well  
Are they looking at you hating singing oh  
Are you doing your thing and doing it good  
Do your thing thing oh do your thing thing oh  
  
do your thing Do Your Thing oh oh  
Keeping yourself from taking  
On your perfect dreamyou had to be open  
And being something  
Somewhere that you read in a magazinebut you never let you shine  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Are you doing your thing well  
Are you letting your dreams come alive  
Are you doing your thing good  
Believe can nobody do it better than you believe can nobody do it better than
you  
  
Gotta walk gotta break gotta call gotta take everything that I bring
never do fall  
Gotta hump gotta bump never sit on a stump never quit on a swell of a lump  
If you really want it bad  
You cant ever drag your feet to the beat of the sound of defeat  
Even if you got heat  
Whoa  
Never take your mad off to defeat so  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus x3  
  
Do your thing do your thing baby  
Do your thing All them looking at ya All them looking at ya  
Believe can nobody do it better than you believe can nobody do it better
than you  
Do your thing oh  
Yeah  
Oh  
Yeah  
Believe can nobody do it better than you believe can nobody do it better
than you  
Oh  
  
Do your thing Repeat x4
