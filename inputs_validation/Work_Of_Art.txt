Everyday is like a blank canvas  
You know you can paint it anyway you want it  
You can draw black clouds you can make the sun shine  
Color in a rainbow or use black and white  
Open up your eyes and your imagination  
  
Come on lets write a song a little poetry  
Take a photograph lets make some memories  
You can make it anything that you want it to be  
If you follow your heart life is a work of art  
  
Ooh every nights like looking at a dark screen  
Youre never too young or too old to dream  
You can make your fantasy into a reality  
Cause youre creating your own masterpiece  
Close your eyes and dream it seeing is believing  
  
Come on lets write a song a little poetry  
Take a photograph lets make some memories  
You can make it anything that you want it to be  
If you follow your heart life is a work of art  
  
Lets write a song a little poetry  
Take a photograph lets make some memories  
You can make it anything that you want it to be  
If you follow your heart life is a work of art  
  
Trying to simplify into philosophy  
Turn the star into a galaxy  
Make a little noise into a symphony  
Youre creating a masterpiece  
  
Come on lets write a song a little poetry  
Take a photograph lets make some memories  
You can make it anything that you want it to be  
If you follow your heart life is a work of art  
  
Come on lets write a song a little poetry  
Take a photograph lets make some memories  
You can make it anything that you want it to be  
If you follow your heart life is a work of art  
  
Lets write a song a little poetry  
Take a photograph lets make some memories  
You can make it anything that you want it to be  
If you follow your heart life is a work of art  
  
Life is a work of art  
Life is a work of art  
Life is a work of art  
Life is a work of art
