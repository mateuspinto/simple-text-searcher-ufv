Am I very wrong  
To hide behind the glare of an open minded stare  
Am I very wrong  
To wander in the fear of a never ending lie  
Am I very wrong  
To try to close my ears to the sound they play so loud  
Am I very wrong  
The happiness machine is trying hard to sing my song  
Todays your birthday friend  
Everything all right  
Let us our greetings to you send  
Happy friend  
Everything all right  
We hope your life will never end  
Am I very wrong  
To want to steal a pin then Ill check that I have skin  
Am I very wrong  
To want to leave my friends and the curse of the happiness machine  
Todays your birthday friend  
Everything all right  
Let us our greetings to you send  
Happy friend  
Everything all right  
We hope your life will never end  
We hope your life will never end  
They say
