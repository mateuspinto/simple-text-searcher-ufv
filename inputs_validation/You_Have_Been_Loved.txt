You shot me up yeah  
You filled my cup oh  
You sailed my boat  
You were my last hope  
You took my very last hope away  
  
Oh you you will be loved by someone good  
And you you will be loved by somebody good  
You have been loved  
  
You dropped the bomb  
And now youre gone  
I held you dear  
You swallowed my fears  
And now Ive drunk my last beer with you  
  
Oh you you have been loved by someone good  
Yeah you you will be loved  
Oh will you ever know  
That the bitterness and anger left me long ago  
Only sadness remains  
And it will pass  
  
Yeah you you will be loved by somebody good  
By somebody good
