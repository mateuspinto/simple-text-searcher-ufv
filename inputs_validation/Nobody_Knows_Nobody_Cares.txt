Nobody knows how lonely my road  
Nobody knows how heavy my load  
Nobody cares how tearful my way  
How dark the night how weary the day  
  
Nobody knows nobody cares  
My every burden nobody shares  
My only comfort and my only strength  
Is Jesus walking by my side all the way  
  
Nobody knows how hard I must toil  
Causing sometimes my heart to recoil  
Nobody cares when I try to sleep  
I lay awake and I bitterly weep  
  
Nobody knows nobody cares  
My every burden nobody shares  
My only comfort my only strength  
Is Jesus walking by my side all the way  
  
Nobody knows how weary my cross  
Nobody knows my trouble my loss  
Nobody cares if even Im ill  
Or if lifes hardships have broken my will  
  
Nobody knows nobody cares  
My every burden nobody shares  
My only comfort and my only strength  
Is Jesus walking by my side all the way  
  
Nobody knows nobody cares  
My every burden nobody shares  
My only comfort my only strength  
Is Jesus walking by my side all the way
