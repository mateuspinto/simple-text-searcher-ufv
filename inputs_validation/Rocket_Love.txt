Do do do do do do do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do do do dooo  
  
I longed for you since I was born  
A woman sensitive and warm  
And that you were  
  
With pride and strength no one would test  
But yet have feminine finesse  
And so much more  
  
You took me riding in your rocket gave me a star  
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back  
Down to this cold cold world  
Took me riding in your rocket gave me a star  
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back  
Down to this cold cold world  
  
A female Shakespeare of your time  
With looks to blow Picassos mind  
You were the best  
  
Your body moved with grace and song  
Like symphonies by Bach or Brahms  
Nevertheless oh oh  
  
You took me riding in your rocket gave me a star  
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back  
Down to this cold cold world  
Ooh you took me riding in your rocket gave me a star  
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back  
Down to this cold cold world  
  
Da da da da da da da da da da da da  
Da da da da da daaa  
  
The passion burning in your heart  
Would make hells fire seem like a spark  
Where did it go  
  
Just why that you would overnight  
Turn love to stone as cold as ice  
Ill never know  
  
But you took me riding in your rocket gave me a star  
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back  
Down to this cold cold world  
Baby you took me riding in your rocket gave me a star  
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back  
Down to this cold cold world  
  
Cold too cold you took me riding in your rocket gave me a star  
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back  
Down to this cold cold world  
Oh oh oh took me riding in your rocket gave me a star  
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back  
Down to into this cold cold world  
  
I would not do that to a dog  
Took me riding in your rocket gave me a star  
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back  
Down to this cold cold world  
You took me riding in your rocket gave me a star  
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back  
Down to this cold cold world  
Ooh baby  
Rocket love
