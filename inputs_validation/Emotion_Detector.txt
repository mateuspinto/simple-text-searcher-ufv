When we lift the covers from our feelings  
We expose our insecure spots  
Trust is just as rare as devotion  
Forgive us our cynical thoughts  
If we need too much attention  
  
Not content with being cool  
We must throw ourselves wide open  
And start acting like a fool  
If we need too much approval  
Then the cuts can seem too cruel  
  
Right to the heart of the matter  
Right to the beautiful part  
Illusions are painfully shattered  
Right where discovery starts  
In the secret wells of emotion  
Buried deep in our hearts  
  
Its true that love can change us  
But never quite enough  
Sometimes we are too tender  
Sometimes were too tough  
If we get too much attention  
  
It gets hard to overrule  
So often fragile power turns  
To scorn and ridicule  
Sometimes our big splashes  
Are just ripples in the pool  
Feelings run high
