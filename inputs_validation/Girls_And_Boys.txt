Following the herd down to Greece on holiday

On sunny beaches take your chances looking for

Avoiding all work cause theres none available  
Like battery thinkers count your thoughts  
On one two three four five fingers  
  
Nothing is wasted only reproduced  
You get nasty blisters du bist sehr schoen  
But we havent been introduced

Boys like theyre girls who do girls like theyre boys  
Always should be someone you really love
