Their eyes for many centuries  
Peered in from space  
Sincere the hope their wise believed  
They could teach our race  
  
But yet on Mars a darker side  
Like all things that God made  
Their tribe of war would heed them not  
Earth they must invade  
  
The fire in the skies  
Them devastate the land  
The warlord chief commands  
  
The humans fight and die  
Our planet laid to waste  
Monsters invade the earth from space  
  
It was then in our darkest hour  
When everything seemed lost  
The hearts of men would not concede  
No matter what the cost  
  
They forged a sword of sound and steel  
Upon the Martian doors  
The voice of war would thunder there  
And Mars would be no more  
  
The Martian cities fall  
The death of the warrior tribe  
Mars attacks now their planet wont survive  
  
Their world turn into ash  
The terror on their face  
Mars explodes cast out as rubble into space  
  
Whoaoh oh oh  
Whoaoh oh oh  
Mars Attacks monsters invade the earth from space  
  
Whoaoh oh oh  
Whoaoh oh oh  
Whoaoh oh oh
