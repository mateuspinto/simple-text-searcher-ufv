There was a mountain on the table of bills that needed paid  
Dishes in the kitchen sink like dreams that never fade  
A wild imagination of convicts in the yard  
Never enough time to make ends meet  
So they put it on a credit card dont we all  
  
You may not know just where you came from but once upon a time  
There was a carpenter a bartender a broken fishing line  
Just south of Royal Teeth in the town that I came from  
There were architects and astronauts  
But the only one she loved was a prison guard  
  
And thats the only time I ever saw true love  
  
And Ericas a girl I liked in Georgia  
Alone and kept me warm in Eugene  
I guess my mother bless her heart  
Set the bar too high to start  
Whats fine enough to me is just too hard  
For a son of a prison guard  
  
Theres a gate that needed painting clothes that needed clean  
Theyd say theres time enough for that when the fun has all been seen  
Cause when were laying on our death bed a promise we wont say  
Wish we would have worked more baby  
Instead of loving you that way no way  
  
And thats the only time I ever saw true love  
  
Sedona is a girl I met in Brooklyn  
Herris got me close in New Orleans  
I guess my mother bless her heart  
Set the bar too high to start  
Whats fine enough to me is just too hard  
For a son of a prison guard  
  
I go wherever you are whoever you are  
I go wherever you are whoever you are  
I go wherever you are whoever you are  
I go wherever you are  
  
Betty is a girl I knew in Charlotte  
 left for Sydney yesterday  
I guess my mother bless her heart  
Set the bar too high to start  
Whats fine enough to me is just too hard  
For a son of a prison guard  
  
Whoever you are
