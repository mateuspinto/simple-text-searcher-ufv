Intro Saukrates  
They say we killin em all all all all  
  
Verse 1 Drake  
HipHops newest and youngest acquisition  
If this was you I wonder what youd do in that position  
Try to make a profit or try to make a difference  
Try to make em play your shit or try to make em listen  
I go from records with Dwele and LB and eLZhi  
The meetings where they tell me to  
Start making records and t heyll buy  
Now Im at in ATown  
A tellin me trey sounds  
Its too mainstream if I plan on me stickin around  
But the allure of this years scream tour  
Has been cuttin all them jawns that be hurtin the game  
I be dreamin bout hoes and doin them loud shows  
Shirtless thats why I started to personal train  
Dog personally maine  
Im a person that came to bring purpose  
To a seem unless they purpose is game  
It never feel like its earned when you purchase the fame  
Now my thoughts getting deeper and Im searchin the game  
I keep on on on on on  
  
Chorus  
Yeah Im killin em all all all all  
Yeah Im killin em all all  
Im killin em all all

The young and incredible while lightin yo ass up  
You look a lil red we getting that cash up  
See where we from  
The 50s are bloody and the 100dollar bill

A gnote is purple grape juice stains on the front piece of  
My lapel is custommade  
You off the rack shit

Verse 3 Drake  
Look uh  
I use to get em like murda murda  
Ol time killin  
I wasnt even rappin spent my whole time chillin  
And now the girls like  
Its only drake got chased and so the artists  
I respected try and take my place  
But pimpin aint easy man and neither is rappin  
They one in the same when you need it to happen  
My city full of players they just needed a captain  
Inneed of him right now and needed him him back then  
But back then I was actin  
Nowadays I serve backhands with backspin  
Tryin to prove rappers are intelligent black men  
Whoever chose to back out is back in  
They say theres two sides to every story  
And three when the truth get told  
So grab a spoon fore your soup get cold  
When you drive it off the lot is when your coupe get old  
So please discover an answer fore proof gets sold  
And keep on on on on on  
  
Chorus  
Yeah Im killin em all all all all  
Im killin em all all  
Im killin em all all
