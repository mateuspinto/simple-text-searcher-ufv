I broke the doldrums of my dreary dreams  
The london bridge kept fallin down  
I blew my coop and flew to new orleans  
To feast my heart on higher ground  
I wanna thank you for the love you bring  
Louisiana is a song I sing  
Me oh my I dont know what to do  
But love you  
Voila the marshal frand of mardi gras  
A royal rascal smack dab in his prime  
One billon blue doubloons and a single straw  
In a royal flask of cajun wine  
  
I wanna thank you for the love we made  
Louisiana is a sweet parade  
Me oh my I dont know what to do  
But love you  
I wanna thank you for the love you shine  
Louisiana is a love of mine  
Me oh my I dont know what to do  
But love you  
Oh mardi gras
