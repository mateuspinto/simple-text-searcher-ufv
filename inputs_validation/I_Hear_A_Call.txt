I hear a call  
Now will answer  
Forsake my all  
To serve another  
Though darkness falls  
Stay a believer  
I hear a call  
Now will answer  
  
I see a light Now will I follow  
Fill up this life  
That grows more hollow  
Make joy reside  
Where there lives sorrow  
I see a light  
Now will follow  
  
I hear a call  
From out of nowhere  
And from anywhere I go  
I hear a call  
Now will answer  
  
I feel a touch  
Now will I hold on  
Be there with love  
For those with no one  
With a kindness such  
It lives though Im gone  
I feel a touch  
Now will I hold on  
  
I hear a call  
From out of nowhere  
And from everywhere I go  
I see a light  
Now will I follow  
I feel a touch  
Now will I follow  
I hear a call  
Now will I answer
