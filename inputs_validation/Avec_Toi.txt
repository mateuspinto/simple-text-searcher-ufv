Avec toi avec toi be the lady of my heart  
I will cry I will die if you love me  
  
Youre all I want I told you twice  
You are for me my paradise  
My heart is makes a lonely sound to me  
You had the love right in your eyes  
But maybe you are telling lies  
My heart it makes a lonely sound to me  
  
Avec toi avec toi be the lady of my heart  
I will smile I will try if you love me  
Avec toi avec toi  
give you all my heart ce soir  
I will cry I will die if you leave me  
  
You are the first you are my world  
Ill never find a better girl  
My heart it makes a lonely sound to me  
You are my love you are my life  
Without you girl I cant survive  
My heart it makes a lonely sound to me  
  
Red white green and black why you always make me sad  
ABC and D all my love for you is free  
1 2 3 and 4 all my love you cant ignore  
Tell me that you mine baby til the end of time  
Tell me you cant hide that your love for me is right  
1 2 3 and 4 all my love you cant ignore
