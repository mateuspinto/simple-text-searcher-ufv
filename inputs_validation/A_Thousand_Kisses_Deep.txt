The ponies run the girls are young  
The odds are there to beat  
You win a while and then its done  
Your little winning streak  
And summoned now to deal  
With your invincible defeat  
You live your life as if its real  
A Thousand Kisses Deep  
  
Im turning tricks Im getting fixed  
Im back on Boogie Street  
You lose your grip and then you slip  
Into the Masterpiece  
And maybe I had miles to drive  
And promises to keep  
You ditch it all to stay alive  
A Thousand Kisses Deep  
  
And sometimes when the night is slow  
The wretched and the meek  
We gather up our hearts and go  
A Thousand Kisses Deep  
  
Confined to sex we pressed against  
The limits of the sea  
I saw there were no oceans left  
For scavengers like me  
I made it to the forward deck  
I blessed our remnant fleet  
And then consented to be wrecked  
A Thousand Kisses Deep  
  
Im turning tricks Im getting fixed  
Im back on Boogie Street  
I guess they wont exchange the gifts  
That you were meant to keep  
And quiet is the thought of you  
The file on you complete  
Except what we forgot to do  
A Thousand Kisses Deep  
  
And sometimes when the night is slow  
The wretched and the meek  
We gather up our hearts and go  
A Thousand Kisses Deep  
  
The ponies run the girls are young  
The odds are there to beat
