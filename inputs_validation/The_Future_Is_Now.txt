This citys made of diamonds  
And tomorrow glass will grow  
On the freedoms that divide us  
Theyre coming after me  
Flashback nineteen eightyfour  
Now whos knockknocking at your door  
A thought that starts a riot  
Theyre coming after me now  
  
Life is not the same  
I am one but  
Sparks turn into flames  
  
Will you take whats in my head  
And erase me when Im dead  
Cause the future is now  
Now Im disappearing  
  
The day has turned to night  
Can you save me from the light  
Cause the future is here  
This is how I disappear  
  
Running down a spiral  
With the light of better men  
Shouting progress is survival  
Take one last look and see me  
Now you see me now you dont  
No vow to break  
No string of hope  
My hero your pariah  
Theyre coming after me now  
  
Life is just Gods game  
I am one but  
Sparks turn into flames  
  
And you get what you deserve  
When revenge is what you serve  
Cause the future is now  
Now Im disappearing  
  
Ill sink into the night  
And Im turning off the lights  
Cause the future is here  
This is how I disappear  
  
So the ends what you make it  
And thats what youre looking for  
This is the future  
The future is now  
  
Disappear disappear  
Disappear disappear  
  
Now turn off the lights  
The skies are blue inside you  
Turn off the lights  
Theyll get inside of you  
  
Will you take whats in my head  
And erase me when Im dead  
Cause the future is now  
Now Im disappearing  
  
The day has turned to night  
Can you save me from the light  
Cause the future is here  
This is how I disappear disappear disappear disappear
