I have been since seventeen a shipwreck balladeer  
Tragedy and misery are what makes my career  
Watery graves are my stock and trade but its getting harder  
For all the boats that now do float are returning safely to the harbour  
There hasnt been a shipwreck scene since 1965  
And I find I cry each time a crew returns alive  
I only cheer when gales appear and threaten fresh disaster  
They pass by the boat survives only my careers in tatters  
Theyre building ships too good today and Im the one who suffers  
They dont get rent from aft to stern and their halls never rupture  
Not dashed on rocks and never tossed to heaven on a wave  
You may think it well and good but my livelihood sails away  
There once were found twenty in town who wrote about shipwrecks  
When boats sank lots just like rocks twas good as it gets  
But the golden ages passed away and Im barely survivin  
The balladeers are dead I fear and workin in advertisin  
Theyre building ships too good today and its hurtin me  
Why cant even one poor soul fall into the dark sea  
And be ripped apart by hungry sharks in a bloody spree  
You may think it well and good but my livelihood sails away  
Oh the only tragedy left to sing about is me  
That government bastards been sent to take my job from me  
That inspectors making sure the ships are seaworthy  
He can try no way will I ever give up hope  
When he went by I did pry a big hole in his boat  
Theyre building ships too good today so I helped one along  
How sweet it is to once again hear the tortured song  
Of a man afloat a sinking boat who knows he will die today  
You might think it bad not good but my livelihoods here to stay  
Its here to staaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
