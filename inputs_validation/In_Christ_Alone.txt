In Christ alone my hope is found  
He is my light my strength my song  
This Cornerstone this solid ground  
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm  
What heights of love what depths of peace  
When fears are stilled when strivings cease  
My Comforter my All in All  
Here in the love of Christ I stand  
  
In Christ alone who took on flesh  
Fullness of God in helpless babe  
This gift of love and righteousness  
Scorned by the ones He came to save  
Til on that cross as Jesus died  
The wrath of God was satisfied  
For every sin on Him was laid  
Here in the death of Christ I live  
  
There in the ground His body lay  
Light of the world by darkness slain  
Then bursting forth in glorious Day  
Up from the grave He rose again  
And as He stands in victory  
Sins curse has lost its grip on me  
For I am His and He is mine  
Bought with the precious blood of Christ  
  
No guilt in life no fear in death  
This is the power of Christ in me  
From lifes first cry to final breath  
Jesus commands my destiny  
No power of hell no scheme of man  
Can ever pluck me from His hand  
Till He returns or calls me home  
Here in the power of Christ Ill stand
