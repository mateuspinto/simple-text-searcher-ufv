Honey honey hey  
Baby dont you want a man like me  
Honey honey hey  
Baby dont you want a man like me  
He was the Playboy Type he smoke a pipe  
His favright phrase was OUTASITE  
He had an Irish Setter  
It was a singles bar a Tuesday night  
The moon was dim the band was tight  
They did the bump together  
What a splendid sightRennennennen her teeth were white  
The drinks were cheap it was Ladies Nite  
He was glad that he met her  
She was an office girl My name is Betty  
Her favright group was HELEN REDDY  
They discussed the weather  
Honey honey hey  
Baby dont you want a man like me  
Honey honey hey  
Baby dont you want a man like me  
Honey honey hey  
Baby dont you want a  
Baby dont you want a  
Baby dont you want a man  
She was the lonely sort just a little too short  
Her jokes were dumb and her favright sport  
Was hockey in the winter  
He was duly impressed and was quick to suggest  
Any sport with a PUCK had to be bout the best  
As he jabbed his elbow in her Get it honey Get it  
Later on they went off to where the music was soft  
The candles were drippy they saw a REAL HIPPY  
Who delivered their dinner  
The rice was brown and soon they found  
That the crowd around that had jammed the room  
Well it seemed to be getting thinner  
Honey honey hey  
Baby dont you want a man like me  
Honey honey hey  
Baby dont you want a man like me  
Honey honey hey  
Baby dont you want a  
Baby dont you want a  
Baby dont you want a man  
He took her home to a motor court  
She wouldnt kiss him he tried to ignore it  
But it made him angry  
Angry it made me angry it made me so angry I could have killed that  
Lousy BITCH  
He called her a slut a pig and a whore  
A bitch and a cunt and she slammed the door  
In a petulant frenzy  
A petulant frenzy this is a petulant frenzy  
Im petulant and Im having a frenzy  
On the sofa she weeps  
BOO HOO HOO HOO  
She weeps and she weeps  
BOO HOO HOO HOO HOO HOO  
She weeps and she peeks  
Through the curtain  
He just got in his car  
But the batterys dead  
So he asks to use the phone  
And she gives him some head  
And thats the end of the story  
Honey honey hey  
Baby dont you want a man like me  
Honey honey hey  
Baby dont you want a man like me  
Honey honey hey  
Baby dont you want a  
Baby dont you want a man  
Baby dont you want a man sometimes
