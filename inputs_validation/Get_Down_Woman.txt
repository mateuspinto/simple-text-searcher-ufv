Well get down woman before I have to go  
Well get down woman before I have to go  
You know ya hurt me with your bad mouth  
An I just dont want to know  
  
Well slow down baby and gimme a little time  
Well slow down baby and gimme a little time  
If you want me hangin round  
  
Gotta give me some peace of mind  
  
Oh get down boy  
  
Well get back woman before you bring it down  
Well now get back baby before you bring it down  
Or you can tell it to the wall  
Without me hangin around
