Fighting and biting white thunder and lightning  
Chasing the locust on its trail  
Movements of Majyk false moves become tragic  
According to winds how we sail  
Flight of the Hydra  
Flight of the Hydra  
Snare of the pharaoh remember now they know  
Or knew of the universe vast  
Sign of the symbol finds passageways nimble  
Revealing the old Satanas  
Flight of the Hydra  
Flight of the Hydra  
Flight of the night flight of the soul  
Flight of your life spirit of gold fly  
Searching and searing sarcastically feeding  
Deceiving the truth from the next  
Enchantment embraces the snake as it ages  
Awaiting the life that is next  
Flight of the Hydra  
Flight of the Hydra
