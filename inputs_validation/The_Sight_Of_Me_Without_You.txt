I cant believe I am watching our love ending  
I wonder just how long youve been pretending  
Pretending that our love was what you wanted  
While you were out there finding someone new  
Well these days I dont dare look in the mirror  
Cause I can hardly stand the sight of me without you  
  
My broken heart might need a little mending  
And I lie here in the dark still remembering  
Remembering when we were so good together  
Ive become a perfect image of a fool  
Oh the picture of my future is getting clearer  
And I can hardly stand the sight of me without you  
  
Oh the picture of my future is getting clearer  
And I can hardly stand the sight of me without you  
Oh the picture of my future is getting clearer  
And I can hardly stand the sight of me without you
