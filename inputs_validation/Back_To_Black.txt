He left no time to regret  
Kept his dick wet with his same old safe bet  
Me and my head high  
And my tears dry get on without my guy  
You went back to what you knew  
So far removed from all that we went through  
And I tread a troubled track  
My odds are stacked Ill go back to black  
We only said goodbye with words  
I died a hundred times  
  
You go back to her  
And I go back to  
I go back to us  
I love you much  
Its not enough you love blow and I love puff  
And life is like a pipe  
And Im a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside  
We only said goodbye with words  
I died a hundred times  
You go back to her  
And I go back to  
We only said goodbye with words  
I died a hundred times  
You go back to her  
And I go back to  
Black black black black  
Black black black  
I go back to  
I go back to  
We only said goodbye with words  
I died a hundred times  
You go back to her  
And I go back to  
We only said goodbye with words  
I died a hundred times  
You go back to her  
And I go back to black
