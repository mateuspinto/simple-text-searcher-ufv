Just when I thought that it never could happen to me  
He touched me and feelings that never have stirred in me  
Ever like this  
Are in his kiss  
  
Chorus  
Heart where are you taking me  
What will you make of me  
Is this the real thing  
And heart could he be paradise  
Cause in his eyes  
Do I see love looking at me  
  
Maybe Im crazy  
For believing its different this time  
Oh am I ready to feel what Ive dreamed about  
Love that Ive lived without finding  
Is finding me  
  
Chorus
