Why oh why must you swoop through the hood  
like everybody from the hood is up to no good  
You think all the girls around here are trickin  
up there lookin like Super chicken  
At night I see your light through my bedroom window  
But I aint got shit but the pad and pencil  
I cant wait till I hear you say  
Im going down mayday mayday Im gonna clown  
Cause everytime that the pigs have got me  
yall rub it in with the flying Nazi  
military force but we dont want ya  
Standin on my roof with the rocket launcher  
So fly like an eagle  
But dont follow us wherever we go  
The shit that Im saying make its heard  
Motherfuck you and your punkass ghetto bird  
  
Run run run from the ghetto bird  
Run run run from the ghetto bird  
  
Now  
My homeys here to lick on a trick for a Rolex  
And let me try the four next  
Now the four I was driving was hotter than july  
looked up and didnt see it whippin in the sky  
Saw a chopper with numbers on the bottom  
Calling all cars I think weve got em  
I hit the gas and I mashed past Inglewood  
I think I drove through every single hood  
South Central Compton and Watts  
Long Beach bust a you here come the cops  
Wish I had a genie with about three wishes  
Metal flake green on Ds I look suspicious  
You know that Im running  
Shit I hear it humming  
Fuck I see it coming  
Is it a bird Yup  
Is it a plane No  
I hit me a right on El Segundo  
Wanted to holla had to ditch the Impala  
Lets see if they would folla  
Me hit a fence hit a fence and another  
met me a baby pitbull and his mother  
Ran up in some peoples house and looked out of the window  
I wish it was my tenfour  
had to pull a strap on a fool named Louis the Third  
cause Im getting chased by the ghetto bird  
  
Just put his hat ehrrr  
he combed his hair and then put his hat back on  
hes acting nonchalant up there in that cockpit going 115  
miles an hour with the police chasing him  
theyre not gonna be  
real happy when they catch up with him no matter what the eh  
They hate they hate a bigmouth even worse  
  
Officer Birds on his way and I dont want to see him  
could you please give me the keys to the BM  
See I didnt want to gank you  
but dont make me bank you thank you  
Tried to get yo the hood and you might guess  
that a fool like me woulda shot Cyrus  
Incognito Ghetto Eagle  
Saying Fuck where did he go  
I bust me a left from Rubellon Park  
The 735 and Im bailin  
Went to my homegirls house and got a hug man  
She helped me run like Harriet Tubman  
Looked out the window by the black bed  
I saw the pigs and the four on a flatbed  
Then the light from the bird hit me in the face  
I close the blinds cause I didnt want to catch a case  
All that night I heard the bird circle  
while I was eating fish and watching Urkel  
She said I could sleep on the couch  
By two AM I was digging her out  
Fuck the ghetto bird  
  
Which way is he going now  
Ok now now hes hes actually southbound on a service street  
and uh Gee whiz uh Im gonna get my maps out here and figure  
out which service street he suddenly turned off on Uh the sheriffs  
are are well I know that Sheriffs ground units got thrown off  
  
Motherfuck you and your punkass ghetto bird
