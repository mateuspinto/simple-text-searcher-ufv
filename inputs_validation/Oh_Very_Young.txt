Oh very young what will you leave us this time  
Youre only dancin on this earth for a short while  
And though your dreams may toss and turn you now  
They will vanish away like your dads best jeans  
Denim blue faded up to the sky  
And though you want them to last forever  
You know they never will  
you know they never will  
And the patches make the goodbye harder still  
  
Oh very young what will you leave us this time  
Therell never be a better chance to change your mind  
And if you want this world to see a better day  
Will you carry the words of love with you  
Will you ride the great white bird into heaven  
And though you want to last forever  
You know you never will  
you know you never will  
And the goodbye makes the journey harder still  
  
Will you carry the words of love with you  
Will you ride oh oooh  
  
Oh very young what will you leave us this time  
Youre only dancin on this earth for a short while  
Oh very young what will you leave us this time
