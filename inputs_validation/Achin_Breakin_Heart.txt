Well I have lived a lot and done my part of running round  
And never did I think Id let a sweet love get me down  
But now I see how wrong I was youre part of every plan  
Perhaps Ill pay but come what may my hearts at your command  
  
Oh this aching breaking heart of mine is crazy over you  
And Im afraid to let you know I love you like I do  
For if you knew how much I care I know what you would do  
Youd drop me like the others and go find somebody new  
  
Last night I saw you darling in the arms of someone new  
And I know that you dont love him you just want to make me blue  
I guess you think that hurting me will make me love you more  
But someday from you darling this old heart will lock its door  
  
Oh this aching breaking heart of mine is crazy over you  
And Im afraid to let you know I love you like I do  
For if you knew how much I care I know what you would do  
Youd drop me like the others and go find somebody new
