There was a king who ruled the land  
His majesty was in command  
With silver eyes the scarlet eagle  
Showers silver on the people  
Oh Mother tell me more  
  
Whydya have to leave me there  
Hanging in my infant air  
Waiting  
You only have to read the lines  
Theyre scribbly black and everything shines  
  
Across the stream with wooden shoes  
With bells to tell the king the news  
A thousand misty riders climb up  
Higher once upon a time  
  
Wandering and dreaming  
The words have different meaning  
Yes they did  
  
For all the time spent in that room  
The dolls house darkness old perfume  
And fairy stories held me high on  
Clouds of sunlight floating by  
Oh Mother tell me more  
Tell me more
