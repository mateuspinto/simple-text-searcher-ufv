Icy wind of night be gone this is not your domain  
In the sky a bird was heard to cry  
Misty morning whisperings and gentle stirring sounds  
Belie the deathly silence that lay all around  
  
Hear the lark harken to the barking of the dark fox  
Gone to ground  
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water  
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees  
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer  
Making for the sea  
  
In the lazy water meadow I lay me down  
All around me golden sun flakes settle on the ground  
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon  
Bringing sounds of yesterday into this city room  
  
Hear the lark harken to the barking of the dark fox  
Gone to ground  
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water  
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees  
  
In the lazy water meadow I lay me down  
All around me golden sun flakes covering the ground  
Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon  
Bringing sounds of yesterday into this city room  
  
Hear the lark harken to the barking of the dark fox  
Gone to ground  
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water  
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
