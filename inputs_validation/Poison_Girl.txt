I did it all just for her  
I did it all just for her  
And loves heart is death  
For me and my poison girl  
  
A prey she was for the cruelty of love  
While its serpent inside crawled straight towards her heart  
The coldest kiss love ceased to exist  
While we grew apart like never before  
  
I did it all just for her  
I did it all just for her  
And love wants us dead  
Just me and my poison girl  
  
I did it all just for her  
I did it all just for her  
And loves heart is death  
For me and my poison girl  
  
the fire in her eyes  
grew dim and then died  
as the poison inside  
reached her heart  
And the coldest kiss  
faith ceased to exist  
as we grew apart  
like never before  
  
I did it all just for her  
I did it all just for her  
And love wants us dead  
Just me and my poison girl  
  
I did it all just for her  
I did it all just for her  
And loves heart is death  
For me and my poison girl  
And the taste of the poison on her lips is of a tomb  
I did it all just for her  
I did it all just for her  
And love wants us dead  
Just me and my poison girl  
I did it all just for her  
I did it all just for her  
And loves heart is death  
For me and my poison girl  
Poison girl  
And loves heart is death  
For me and my poison girl  
In this poison world
