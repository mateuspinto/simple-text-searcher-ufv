Consider the lilies of the field  
Solomon dressed in royal robes has not the worth of them  
Consider the lilies of the field  
He takes after each and every need leave all your cares behind  
Seek him and you will find Your Father loves you so  
Consider the creatures of the air  
For all of the diamonds in all the earth have not the wealth of them  
Consider the creatures of the air  
Jehovah loves them with tender hand He knows your every care  
His touch is always there to see you through the night  
And Jehovah I love You so  
And Jesus I want You to know  
All Youve done for me to set me free  
Ill never let You go  
And Jehovah I love You so  
And Jesus I want You to know  
All Youve done for me to set me free  
Ill never let You go  
Consider the lilies of the field  
For how much more does He love His own If Yaweh cares for them  
Consider the creatures of the air  
He takes after each and every need  
If we ask Him for bread will He give us a stone  
Jehovah loves His own  
And Jehovah I love You so  
And Jesus I want You to know  
All Youve done for me to set me free  
Ill never let You go  
And Jehovah I love You so  
And Jesus I want You to know  
All Youve done for me to set me free  
Ill never let You go  
And Jehovah I love You so  
And Jesus I want You to know  
All Youve done for me to set me free  
Ill never let You go  
And Jehovah I love You so  
And Jesus I want You to know  
All Youve done for me to set me free  
Ill never let You go  
And Jehovah I love You so  
And Jesus I want You to know  
All Youve done for me to set me free  
Ill never let You go  
And Jehovah I love You so  
And Jesus I want You to know  
All Youve done for me to set me free  
Ill never let you go  
And Jehovah I love you so  
And Jesus I want you to know  
All youve done for me to set me free  
Ill never let you go  
Never let you go  
Never go
