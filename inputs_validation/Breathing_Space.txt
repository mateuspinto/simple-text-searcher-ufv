When your heart is out of line  
And youre feeling left behind  
Seems the faiths not on your side  
And the fog has left you blind  
  
When the pressures pulling different ways  
Find you lying for some empty days  
  
I stop for some breathing space  
I pause in the public place  
Take time from all the time it takes  
To make up for all the big mistakes  
I gotta get out I gotta get out  
  
When your life runs out of steam  
And you need a little time  
If your muse is out of luck  
You might need an extra rhyme  
  
When your heart escapes your head downways  
In the growing queue that life creates  
  
I stop for some breathing space  
Divert from the public place  
Return to a private place  
I know its the adjusting case  
I gotta get out I gotta get out  
  
Far far away Im going  
Far far away I gotta get out  
I gotta get out  
  
Theres a place beyond this world  
Where the mountains meet the sky  
Its a different state of mind  
Like a dream where you can fly  
  
Can I tell you this in confidence  
I need to regain that whole indoor sense  
  
I stop for some breathing space  
Divert from the public place  
Return to a private place  
I know its the adjusting case  
I gotta get out I gotta get out
