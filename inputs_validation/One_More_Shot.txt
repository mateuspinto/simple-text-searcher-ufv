I I I never would have thought it would end this way I lied  
I never have believed that we would separate  
What we have now is how it stands  
And now I wish youll try to make it stay  
The way we are is here and now  
I wish youd make the most of all we have today  
  
Before you go and give it away  
Hold on for one more shot  
Before you let it slip away  
Hold on for one more shot  
  
I did not believe I did not mean to hurt you no more  
I never meant to let you down down  
Though the silver lining wears through  
I still do not mean to hurt you no  
When the sound of your voice is not ringing through  
Beginning to question whether I should be around  
  
Before you go and give it away  
Hold on for one more shot  
Before you let it slip away  
Hold on for one more shot  
  
Before you go and give it away  
Hold on for one more shot  
Before you let it slip away  
Hold on for one more shot
