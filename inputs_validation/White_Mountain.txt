Thin hung the web like a trap in a cage  
The fox lay asleep in his lair  
Fangs frantic paws told the tale of his sin  
Far off the chase shrieked revenge  
  
Outcast he trespassed where no wolf may tread  
The last sacred haunt of the dead  
He learnt of the truth which only one wolf may know  
The sceptre and crown of the king  
Howling for blood Oneeye leads on the pack  
Plunging through forests and snowstorm  
  
Steep rose the ridge ghostly peaks climbed the sky  
Fang sped through the jungles of ice  
Hard on his tale Oneeye drew from the pack  
An old hero conquered by none  
  
Steep for too steep grew the pathway ahead  
Descent was the only escape  
A wolf never flees in the face of his foe  
Fang knew the price he would pay  
Oneeye stood before him  
With the crown upon his head  
Sceptre raised to deal the deadly blow  
  
Fang son of great Fang the Traitor we seek  
The laws of the Brethren say this  
That only the King sees the Crown of the Gods  
And he the Usurper must die  
  
Snarling he tore at the throat of his foe  
But Fang fought the hero in vain  
Dawn saw the white mountain tinted with red  
Never would the crown leave again  
Oneeye hid the crown and with laurels on his head  
Returned amongst the tribe and dwelt in peace
