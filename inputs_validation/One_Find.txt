One  going down  
And then you slipped away  
One stop at a time out of town  
Well meet again someday  
  
Cause I  
I believe in love  
I still wish on  
Stars above  
I believe in love songs  
Yes I think that they are real  
All you have to do is feel  
  
A chance missed for getting kissed  
I think theres so much more than this  
I will  
Guess Ill have to hold my breath and say  
  
That I  
I believe in fate  
I believe in good things coming to those who wait  
Although Im anticipating late  
And all my hopes were beginning to fade  
When you will me  
How will we be  
  
This is only one  
Temporary find  
Im sure before too long  
You will change your mind  
One find  
And this is only one of a many find  
Im sure before too long  
Youre gonna make up your mind  
  
I know all about it  
Well I thought I did  
So I wrote a song about it  
And it goes a little something like this  
  
See now I  
I believe in love songs  
Yes I think that they are real  
All you have to do do do  
You tell me  
All I have to do  
Say  
All we have to do  
Is feel  
Is feel  
Feel so right  
Is feel  
Feel so nice  
And this is so nice  
And this is so right  
And this is so right  
Right find and fine by me
