You You were a friend You were a friend of mine I let you spend the night  
You see how it was my fault Of course it was mine  
Im too hard at work Have you ever heard of anything so absurd ever in your
life  
Im sorry for wasting your time  
  
Who am I to say this situation isnt great Its my job to make the most of it  
Of course I didnt know that it would happen to me Not that easy  
  
Hey whats that you say Youre not blaming me for anything thats great  
But I dont break that easy Does it fade away  
So thats why Im apologizing now for telling you I thought that we could make
it  
I just dont get enough to believe that weve both changed  
  
Who am I to say this situation isnt great Its my time to make the most of
it  
How could I ever know that this would happen to me not that easy no  
All along the fault is up for grabs why dont you have it  
Well its for sale go make your offer Ill sell it for no less than what I
bought it for  
Pay no more than absolutely zero  
  
Well neither one of us deserves the blame because opportunities moved us away  
And its not an easy thing to learn to play a game thats made for two thats
you and me  
The rules remain a mystery See it can be easy  
  
Who am I to say this situation isnt great Its our time to make the most of
it  
How could we ever know that this would happen to me not that easy no  
All along the fault is up for grabs and there you have it  
Well its for sale go make your offer Ill sell it for no less than what I
bought it for  
Pay no more than absolutely zero
