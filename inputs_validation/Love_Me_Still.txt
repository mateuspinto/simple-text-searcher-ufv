Here is my hand for you to hold  
Heres a part of me they have not sold  
Ive wandered far Ive had my fill  
I need you now do you love me still  
  
Only you have seen the hidden part of me  
Call me fool hearted if you will  
I loved you then do you love me still  
  
So many smiles and lies surround me  
Empty expectations faceless fears  
Sometimes this life is a bitter pill  
I love you now do you love me still  
  
You have been mine since time untold  
Our love is immortal dont you know  
Others will come and they will go  
But I love you young and I love you old  
  
Only you have seen the other side of me  
Call me naive I think you will  
I loved you then do you love me still  
  
Here are the eyes that only see you  
Heres the mouth that only calls your name  
Here is the song they cannot kill  
I love you now do you love me still
