The boom time it is over  
A ghost town is all thats left here  
The gold rush it is over  
And depression days draw near  
  
Tonight after sundown  
Im going to pack my case  
I leave without a sound  
Disappear without a trace  
  
Im going southbound  
  
Drifting like a drover  
Chasing my career  
From the ships docked in the harbour  
New horizons will appear  
  
Tumbling with the tumbleweed  
Down the open road  
Taking only what I need  
Before my head explodes  
  
Im going southbound  
  
Hey youre not getting any younger  
The wild west has already been won  
Northern lights are growing colder  
And the old eastern ways are gone  
  
So tonight after sundown  
You must go from this place  
Without a tear without a frown  
Disappear without a trace
