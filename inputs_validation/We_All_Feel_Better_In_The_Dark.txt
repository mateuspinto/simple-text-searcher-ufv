The musics pumping through me I rush into the crowd  
The sweat is pouring off me the beat is dead loud  
I want someone to love me and I know I want it now  
These feelings that Im feeling must be satisfied somehow  
I want it I want it you know I really want it  
I want it I want it you know I really want it  
I want it I want it you know I really want it  
  
Chorus  
  
My body surges with energy shivers down my spine  
I look deep into your eyes and I know that youll be mine  
  
Chorus  
  
The musics pumping through me I rush into the crowd  
The sweat is pouring off me the beat is dead loud  
I want someone to love me and I know I want it now  
These feelings that Im feeling must be satisfied somehow  
You want it you want it you know you really want it  
You want it you want it you know you really want it  
  
I want it I want it you know I really want it  
  
Chorus
