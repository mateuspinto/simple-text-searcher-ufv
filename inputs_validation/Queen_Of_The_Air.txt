There is a dream I used to have  
My dream swallowed me whole  
There is a bridge where I hate to go  
That is where I first saw her  
High on the bridge I seen her red hair shining  
There is a girl I never knew  
She was my Aunt Virginia  
They said that she she just disappeared  
They said I look just like her  
High on the bridge I seen her dancing waving to me there  
  
She smiled and raised her head  
Then she took to the air  
There is a dream I cant escape  
My memories come back to me  
There is a hell I cant escape  
My memories come back to me  
I heard the truth about it  
  
Pictures and headlines hidden away  
I heard the truth about my real mom  
Jumping from the bridge that day  
Now I know why ever since I was 3 years old  
Been having the same nightmare  
Now I know the truth about Virginia  
Why she took to the air
