Lost at a game so easy to play  
I lost my faith I lost my stride  
How can this be I fought so desperately  
Was too afraid to show what I had inside  
  
But I believe in redemption  
And I believe in redemption  
And I believe in redemption  
  
Children of the street wander so helplessly  
Who will pay for their suffering  
Weve got the power to set them free  
Yet still we do nothing nothing  
  
But I believe in redemption  
And I believe in redemption  
And I believe in redemption  
I believe  
  
Sometimes I just dont know I guess we lost our way to go  
Sometimes I just dont know I guess we lost our way to go  
Sometimes I just dont know I guess we lost our way to go  
Sometimes I just dont know I guess we lost our way to go x2  
  
Redemption
