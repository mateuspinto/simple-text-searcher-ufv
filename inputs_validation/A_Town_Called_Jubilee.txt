Lily pulled a horseshoe from a pile of junk  
Said Im gonna keep this good luck piece  
Of iron inside my truck  
The boy just whispered OK  
And grabbed his old black dog  
As we piled on in and cut out through  
That late November fog  
  
Dull as a plowshare rusting in the yard  
Old Cotton grinned and waved goodbye  
While the auctioneers all played cards  
On every other Sunday  
Id walk down to Moes and back  
Eat a tbone steak watch a picture show  
For a dollar and a half  
  
Come on little sister get up offa my knee  
Gonna settle down someday  
In a town called Jubilee  
Come on brother Jake  
Break on out and a break free  
Gonna set things right and set up a house  
In a town called Jubilee  
  
That fog came out of nowhere  
Short of what I can tell  
Hand to hand we passed that bucket  
Up and down from the well  
Gone to California  
Used to be what folks would say  
Down around these parts if it was me  
Id have hoped that west bound stage  
  
Come on little sister get up offa my knee  
Gonna settle down someday  
In a town called Jubilee  
Come on brother Jake  
Break on out and a break free  
Gonna set things right and set up a house  
In a town called Jubilee  
  
One less hallelujah  
A little less sympathy  
Lily and Jake the old black dog  
A pinewood box a rocking horse  
All gone to Jubilee  
  
Come on little sister get up offa my knee  
Gonna settle down someday  
In a town called Jubilee  
Come on brother Jake  
Break on out and a break free  
Gonna set things right and set up a house  
In a town called Jubilee
