Here comes the rationalization  
Here comes the song I know  
Theres a change of weather comin  
Theres a change in me and you  
  
I found some questions to the answers  
The dancing flames of romances  
  
Freedom is intoxicatin  
Its a lizard in your hand  
Dont you worry about the future  
I need some in my plan  
  
I found some questions to the answers  
The dancing flames of romances  
  
I found some questions to the answers  
The dancing flames of romances  
  
Here comes my kamikaze  
Here comes Gods top ten  
Nothin to be done to stop it  
Nothin to get in its way  
  
Here comes the rationalization  
Here comes the song we know  
Theres a change of weather comin  
Theres a change in me and you  
  
I found some questions to the answers  
The dancing flames of romances  
  
I found some questions to the answers  
The dancing flames of romances  
  
Flames of romances  
I found some questions
