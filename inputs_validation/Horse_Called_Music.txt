High on a mountain in western Montana  
A silhouette moves cross a cinnamon sky  
Ridin along on a horse he called Music  
With a song on his lips and a tear in his eye  
  
He dreams of a time and a lady that loved him  
And how he would sing her sweet lullabye  
But we dont ever ask him and he never talks about her  
I guess its better to just let it slide  
  
And he sings oooh to the ladies  
And oooh he makes em sigh  
Now he rides away on a horse he called Music  
With a pain in his heart and a tear in his eye  
  
Now he rode the Music from Boston to Bozeman  
For not too much money and way too much ride  
But those were the days when a horse he called Music  
Could jump through the moon and sail across the sky  
  
Now all thats left is a old time worn cowboy  
With nothing more than the sweet bye and bye  
Trailin behind is a horse with no rider  
A horse he calls Memories that she used to ride  
  
But he sang oooh to the ladies  
And oooh he damn near laid down and died  
Now he rides away on a horse he called Music  
With a pain in his heart and a tear in his eyes  
  
High on a mountain in western Montana  
Two crosses cut through a cinnamon sky  
Marking a place where a horse he called Music  
Lays with a cowboy in the sweet bye and bye
