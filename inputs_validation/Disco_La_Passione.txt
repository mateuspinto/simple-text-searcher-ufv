I stand alone  
Without a care  
Open the door  
But noones there  
The lonely night  
My only friend  
Loves wrongs are right  
I cant defend  
  
La Passione  
La Passione  
La Passione  
La Passione  
  
And now I know  
What Ive become  
It haunts me so  
But Ill go on and on  
I know the pain inside  
Is the price you pay to ride  
Into the brightest flame  
Never the same again  
  
La Passione  
La Passione  
La Passione  
La Passione  
  
You dare to dream  
Take the chance and go  
Desire has taken hold  
Now the passion haunts you so  
  
La Passione  
La Passione  
La Passione  
La Passione
