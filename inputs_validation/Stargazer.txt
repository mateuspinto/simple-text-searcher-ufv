High noon oh Id sell my soul for water  
Nine years worth of breakin my back  
Theres no sun in the shadow of the wizard  
See how he glides why hes lighter than air  
Oh I see his face  
  
Where is your star  
Is it far is it far is it far  
When do we leave  
I believe yes I believe  
  
In the heat and the rain  
With whips and chains  
To see him fly  
So many die  
We build a tower of stone  
With our flesh and bone  
Just to see him fly  
But dont know why  
Now where do we go  
  
Hot wind moving fast across the desert  
We feel that our time has arrived  
The world spins while we put his dream together  
A tower of stone to take him straight to the sky  
Oh I see his face  
  
Where is your star  
Is it far is it far far  
When do we leave  
Hey I believe I believe  
  
In the heat and the rain  
With whips and chains  
Just to see him fly  
Too many die  
We build a tower of stone  
With our flesh and bone  
To see him fly  
But we dont know why  
Ooh now where do we go  
  
All eyes see the figure of the wizard  
As he climbs to the top of the world  
No sound as he falls instead of rising  
Time standing still then theres blood on the sand  
Oh I see his face  
  
Where was your star  
Was it far was it far  
When did we leave  
We believed we believed we believed  
  
In heat and rain  
With whips and chains  
To see him fly  
So many died  
We built a tower of stone  
With our flesh and bone  
To see him fly  
  
But why  
In all the rain  
With all the chains  
Did so many die  
Just to see him fly  
  
Look at my flesh and bone  
Now look look look look  
Look at his tower of stone  
I see a rainbow rising  
Look there on the horizon  
And Im coming home Im coming home Im coming home  
  
Time is standing still  
He gave back my will  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Going home  
Im going home  
  
My eyes are bleeding  
And my heart is leaving here  
A place Ive known  
But its not home ooh  
  
Take me back  
He gave me back my will  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
  
Going home  
Im going home  
  
My eyes are bleeding  
And my heart is leaving here  
The place Ive known  
But its not home ooh  
  
Take me back he gave me back my will  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Going home Im going home  
My eyes are bleeding  
And my heart is leaving here  
  
The place Ive known  
But its not home ooh  
Take me back take me back  
Back to my home oh oh ooh  
Time standing still
