All night long  
Rumble tumble deep down under under my skin  
  
All night long  
Burning turning growing to be my other wing  
  
All night long  
Maybe baby you ll be crazy crazy for me  
  
All night long  
Sinking thinking wanting to grow learning to see  
  
Together we ll fly all night long  
Together we ll fly all night long  
  
All night long  
Break out break in now we re making life out of love  
  
All night long  
Maybe baby you will be all i m dreaming of  
  
All night long  
Touch me shake me gently wake me teach me to sing  
  
All night long  
Slowly slowly learning to be my other wing  
  
Together we ll fly all night long  
Together we ll fly all night long  
  
Learning to be my other wing
