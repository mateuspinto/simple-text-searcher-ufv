I was taught a month ago  
To bide my time and take it slow  
But then I learned just yesterday  
To rush and never waste the day  
Well Im convinced the whole day long  
That all I learn is always wrong  
and things are true that I forget  
But no one taught that to me yet  
  
I ought to see the Man Mulcahey
