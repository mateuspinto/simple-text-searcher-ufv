Tell her you care each time you speak  
Make it her birthday each day of the week  
Bring her nice things sugar and spice things  
Roses and lollipops  
And lollipops and roses  
  
One day shell smile next day shell cry  
Minute to minute youll never know why  
Coax her pet her better yet get her  
Roses and lollipops  
And lollipops and roses  
  
We try acting grown up but as a rule  
Were all little children fresh from school  
  
So carry her books thats how it starts  
Fourteen to forty theyre kids in their hearts  
Keep them handy flowers and candy  
Roses and lollipops  
And lollipops and roses
