Do you know what is means to miss New Orleans  
I miss it each night and day  
The longer I stay away  
Miss the moist covered vines  
The tall sugar pines  
Where mocking birds use to sing  
And I like to see the lazy Mississippi  
Are hurrying to spring  
The mardy grass memories  
Of creol tunes that fill the air  
I dream of Orleanders in June  
And soon Im wishing that I was there  
Do you know what is means to miss New Orleans  
And there is something more  
I miss the one I care for  
More than I miss New Orleans
