The fox is done running  
And the beast is at bay  
Weve run them in circles  
By the end of the day  
We chased them through bramble  
We chased them through the fields  
We could chase them forever  
But the fox would not heel  
And some saw her shadow  
On the crest of a hill  
All the hounds are distracted  
Away from the kill  
One day well reach a great ocean  
At the end of a pale afternoon  
And wed lay down our heads just like we were sleeping  
Controlled by the drag of the moon  
We ran through the forest  
And we ran through the streams  
And we ran through the heather  
Though we ran in our dreams  
And you were my lover  
And I was your boy  
We ran like the river  
For what else did we know  
One day well reach a great ocean  
At the end of a pale afternoon  
The dogs are all howling  
And the horses are late  
All the hunters have hunted  
Through the end of the game  
Our love was a river  
A wild mountain stream  
In a tumbling fury  
On the edge of a dream  
And they chased us through bramble  
And they chased us through the fields  
They could chase us forever  
But our heart would not yield  
And the fox is done running  
At the end of the day  
Im ready to answer  
Im ready to pay  
And this rivers done running  
And time will come soon  
Carried to the great ocean  
By the drag of the moon
