My uncle has a country place  
That no one knows about  
He says it used to be a farm  
Before the Motor Law  
And now on Sundays I elude the eyes  
And hop the turbine freight  
To far outside the wire where my  
Whitehaired uncle waits  
  
Jump to the ground as the turbo slows  
To cross the borderline  
Run like the wind as excitement shivers  
Up and down my spine  
But down in his barn  
My uncle preserved for me  
An old machine  
For fiftyodd years  
To keep it as new  
Has been his dearest dream  
  
I strip away the old debris  
That hides a shining car  
A brilliant Red Barchetta  
From a better vanished time  
Well fire up the willing engine  
Responding with a roar  
Tires spitting gravel  
I commit my weekly crime  
  
Wind  
In my hair  
Shifting and drifting  
Mechanical music  
Adrenaline surge  
  
Welloiled leather  
Hot metal and oil  
The scented country air  
  
Sunlight on chrome  
The blur of the landscape  
Every nerve aware  
  
Suddenly ahead of me  
Across the mountainside  
A gleaming alloy aircar  
Shoots towards me two lanes wide  
Oh I spin around with shrieking tires  
To run the deadly race  
Go screaming through the valley  
As another joins the chase  
  
Ride like the wind  
Straining the limits  
Of machine and man  
Laughing out loud with fear and hope  
Ive got a desperate plan  
  
At the onelane bridge  
I leave the giants stranded  
At the riverside  
Race back to the farm  
To dream with my uncle  
At the fireside
