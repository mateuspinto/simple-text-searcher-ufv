All men must have someone have someone  
Who would never take advantage  
Of a love bright as the sun  
Someone to understand them  
And you just may be the one  
  
All men must have someone have someone  
Who would never take for granted  
All the pleasures and the fun  
Someone to stand beside them  
And you just may be the one  
  
I saw when you walked by  
The love light in your eye  
And I knew I must try  
To win you more than just a friend  
Im starting near the end  
And I go again  
  
All men must have someone have someone  
Who would never take advantage  
Of a love bright as the sun  
Someone to stand beside them  
And you just may be the one  
Someone to understand them  
And you just may be the one
