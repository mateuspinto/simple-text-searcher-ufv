I could have danced all night I could have danced all night  
And still have begged for more  
I could have spread my wings and done a thousand things  
Ive never done before  
  
Ill never know what made it so exciting  
Why all at once my heart took flight  
I only know when he began to dance with me  
I could have danced danced danced all night  
  
I could have danced all night I could have danced all night  
And still have begged for more more more  
I could have spread my wings and done a thousand things  
Ive never done before  
  
Ill never know what made it so so exciting  
Why all at once my heart took flight  
I only know when he began to dance with me  
I could have danced danced danced all night
