What is that strang air in the sky  
Why should a strange star pass me by  
  
How can you congratulate the people who destroyed the piece of mind  
The silly people just like you and better too  
How can you keep turning when the overture is burning on the faces  
Of the people in the churches of the land  
  
Thats all a way that I cut from the lives  
The day has come at last  
  
People that cry in the boulevard  
Their eyes are blind they cry so hard  
  
How can you congratulate the people who destroyed the piece of mind  
The silly people just like you and better too  
How can you keep turning when the overture is burning on the faces  
Of the people in the churches of the land  
  
Thats all it seems there is only one dream  
The day has come at last  
  
Thats all it seems there is only one dream  
The day has come at last  
  
What you have done makes me ashamed  
Ill blow it up and start again  
  
How can you congratulate the people who destroyed the piece of mind  
The silly people just like you and better too  
How can you keep turning when the overture is burning in the faces  
Of the people in the churches of the land  
  
Thats all it seems there is only one dream  
The day has come at last
