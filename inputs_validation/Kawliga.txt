Im a rolling stone all alone and lost  
For a life of sin I have paid the cost  
When I pass by all the people say  
Just another guy on the lost highway  
  
Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine  
And a womans lies make a life like mine  
Oh the day we met I went astray  
I started rollin down that lost highway  
  
I was just a lad nearly twentytwo  
Neither good nor bad just a kid like you  
And now Im lost too late to pray  
Lord Ive paid the cost on the lost highway  
  
Now boys dont start your ramblin round  
On this road of sin or youre sorrow bound  
Take my advice or youll curse the day  
You started rollin down that lost highway
