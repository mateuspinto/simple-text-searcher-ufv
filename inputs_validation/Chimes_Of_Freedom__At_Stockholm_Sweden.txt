Well far between sundowns finish and midnights broken toll  
We ducked inside the doorway thunder crashing  
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sound  
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom crashing  
  
Yeah flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight  
Flashing for the refugees on their unarmed road of flight  
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night  
We gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  
  
Well in the citys melted furnace unexpectedly we watched  
With faces hidden here while the walls were tightening  
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowing rain  
Dissolved into the wild bales of lightning  
  
Yeah tolling for the rebel yeah tolling for the rake  
Tolling for the luckless the abandoned and forsaken  
Yeah tolling for the outcast burning constantly at stake  
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  
  
Alright now  
  
And then through a cloud like curtain in a far off corner flashed  
As the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting  
Well electric light still struck like arrows  
Fired but for the ones condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting  
  
Well tolling for the searching ones on their speechless seeking trail  
For the lonesomehearted lovers with too personal a tale  
And for each unharmful gentle soul misplaced inside a jail  
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  
  
Well starryeyed and laughing I recall when we were caught  
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended  
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look  
Spellbound and swallowed as the tolling ended  
  
Yeah tolling for the aching ones whose wounds  
Cannot be nursed for the countless confused  
Accused misused strung out ones and worse  
And for every hungup person in the whole wide universe  
Yeah  
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing  
  
Alright now whoa whoa whoa  
Well whoa whoa whoa whoa  
Well whoa whoa whoa  
Well whoa whoa whoa
