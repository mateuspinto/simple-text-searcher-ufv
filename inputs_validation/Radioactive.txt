Im waking up to ash and dust  
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust  
Im breathing in the chemicals  
  
Im breaking in shaping up  
Then checking out on the prison bus  
This is it the apocalypse  
Whoa  
  
Im waking up I feel it in my bones  
Enough to make my systems blow  
Welcome to the new age to the new age  
Welcome to the new age to the new age  
Whoa whoa Im radioactive radioactive  
Whoa whoa Im radioactive radioactive  
  
I raise my flags don my clothes  
Its a revolution I suppose  
Well paint it red to fit right in  
Whoa  
Im breaking in shaping up  
Then checking out on the prison bus  
This is it the apocalypse  
Whoa  
  
Im waking up I feel it in my bones  
Enough to make my systems blow  
Welcome to the new age to the new age  
Welcome to the new age to the new age  
Whoa whoa Im radioactive radioactive  
Whoa whoa Im radioactive radioactive  
  
All systems go sun hasnt died  
Deep in my bones straight from inside  
  
Im waking up I feel it in my bones  
Enough to make my systems blow  
Welcome to the new age to the new age  
Welcome to the new age to the new age  
Whoa whoa Im radioactive radioactive  
Whoa whoa Im radioactive radioactive
