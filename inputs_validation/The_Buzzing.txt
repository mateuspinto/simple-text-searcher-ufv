Masks and a fake skin  
The builders keep breaking  
The buzzing  
Attracted to the innocent  
The wolves lead the sheep  
The buzzing  
  
With a stare to crush their hopes and water  
To drown the flies  
their hands fall apart when we need to hold them  
And the skeleton speaks of what weve told them  
The buzzing  
They stare with the eyes of wolves and the hearts of dead  
The builders keep breaking
