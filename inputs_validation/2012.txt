What if the sky was turning red  
I know wed be safe right here in my bed  
Laying face to face oh girl I love the way you sound  
When you rain on me so tonight lets act it out  
Show you how its gon be Im gon kiss your other set of lips  
Hold your body by your legs and hips  
The world cant end until we finish  
Girl we gon  
  
We gon do it like its bout to be the end of the world  
And they depended on us to make earth shaking love  
As we lay down lay down  
You telling me to go harder go harder  
You telling me to go deeper go deeper  
I feel your knees getting weaker and weaker  
We can go longer if you just lay down lay down now  
  
All these vibrations from your legs  
Massaging my back  
I got your body shivering  
Cause were covered in sweat  
Girl I like the way it opens up  
When you throw it back babe  
Girl it might be too much  
Babe if you keep doing that  
I got that pillow for your knees right here  
Baby can you make it disappear  
Your voice is the last thing Im gonna hear  
Then I wanna make you holler  
  
We gon do it like its bout to be the end of the world  
And they depended on us to make earth shaking love  
As we lay down lay down  
You telling me to go harder go harder  
You telling me to go deeper go deeper  
I feel your knees getting weaker and weaker  
And as we lay down lay down now  
  
Do it like we only got one  
Baby lets pretend we only got one night  
One last time let me take my time do it to you right  
Buildings and bridges maybe falling down  
But that wont stop me from turning that thing around  
Girl yeah  
Wont you come on over and we can treat it like its the motherfucking  
End of the world  
And they depending on us to make earth shaking love  
And as we lay down lay down now  
You telling me to go harder go harder  
You telling me to go deeper go deeper  
I feel your knees getting weaker and weaker  
Lay down lay down now  
Lay down right now
