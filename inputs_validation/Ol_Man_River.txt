Here we all work long the Mississippi  
Here we all work while the white folk play  
Pullin them boats  
from the dawn till sunset  
Gettin no rest till the judgment day  
  
Dont look up and dont look down  
You  
dont das make the boss man frown  
Bend your knees and bow your head  
And pull that rope until your  
dead  
  
Let me go way from the Mississippi  
Let me go way from the white man boss  
Show me that stream  
called the River Jordan  
Thats the old stream that I long to cross  
  
Ol Man River that Ol Man River  
  
He dont say nothin but he must know somethin  
He just keeps rollin he keeps on rollin along  
  
He  
dont plant tatters and he dont plant cotton  
And them what plants em are soon forgotten  
But Ol  
Man River just keeps rollin along  
  
You and me we sweat and strain  
Body all achin and racked with  
pain  
Tote that barge and lift that bail  
You get a little drunk and you lands in jail  
  
I gets weary  
and sick of trying  
Im tired of livin but Im scared of dyin  
But Ol Man River he just keeps
