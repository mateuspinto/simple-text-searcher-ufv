For practising witchcraft Do you confess We have ways  
To make you talk How do you plead

Wringled fingers all over her

Who soever lieth with a beast shall surely be put the death  
  
Jeanne

Dogs or cats or goats now leave my soul alone  
  
La reymie

He shall be utterly destroyed

Horns and tails and cloven hoof
