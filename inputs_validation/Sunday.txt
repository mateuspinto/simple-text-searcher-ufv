For those whove slept  
For those whove kept  
Themselves jacked up  
How Jesus wept  
Sunday  
Sunday  
  
For those in need  
For those who speed  
For those who try to slow their minds with weed  
Sunday  
Sunday  
  
For those who wake  
With a blind headache  
Who must be still  
Who will sit and wait  
For Sunday to be Monday  
  
Chorus  
Yeah it will be ok  
Do nothing today  
Give yourself a break  
Let your imagination run away  
  
For those with guilt  
For those who wilt  
Under pressure  
No tears over spilt milk  
Sunday  
Sunday  
Sunday  
Sunday  
Sunday

I I I I I  
I I I I I  
I I I I I  
I I I I I  
I I I I I  
I I I I I  
Oh no no yeah
