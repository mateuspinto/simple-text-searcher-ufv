Come to me in all your glamour and cruelty  
Just do that thing that you do  
And Ill undress you  
Give it time sometimes the simplest move is right  
The melody that you choose can rescue you  
  
A hybrid can withstand these things  
My heart can beat with bricks and strings  
My ARTPOP could mean anything  
  
We could we could belong together ARTPOP  
We could we could belong together ARTPOP  
We could we could belong together ARTPOP  
ARTPOP ARTPOP ARTPOP  
  
Come to me with all your subtext and fantasy  
Just do that thing that you do  
In a perverse hue  
Lovers kites are flown on beaches for public sight  
The color palette you choose can profit you  
  
A hybrid can withstand these things  
My heart can beat with bricks and strings  
My ARTPOP could mean anything  
  
Could try to sell you out or I  
Could show you all the reasons why  
My ARTPOP could mean anything  
  
We could we could belong together ARTPOP  
We could we could belong together ARTPOP  
We could we could belong together ARTPOP  
ARTPOP ARTPOP ARTPOP  
  
Brushes with darknes wont help you create  
Your destiny of self but ARTPOP could mean anything anything  
I try to sell myself but I am really laughing  
Because I just want the music not the bling  
Music not the bling  
  
We could we could belong together ARTPOP  
We could we could belong together ARTPOP  
We could we could belong together ARTPOP  
ARTPOP ARTPOP ARTPOP  
  
We could we could belong together ARTPOP  
We could we could belong together ARTPOP  
We could we could belong together ARTPOP  
ARTPOP ARTPOP ARTPOP  
  
Free my mind ARTPOP  
You make my heart stop
