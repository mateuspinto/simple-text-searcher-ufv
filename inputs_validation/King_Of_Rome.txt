Small man big world  
Lost beyond the pale  
I know you inside out  
I can tell the tale  
  
Across the sky the change of time  
Last night I lost all day  
Im here and there or anywhere  
Away from Manderley  
  
And if I were the king of Rome  
I couldnt be more tragic  
My fate to roam so far from home  
In search of mindless magic  
  
Oh baby come back  
Oh baby come back to me  
  
The desert moon a new lagoon  
We glide upon the surface  
Night falls fast no shadows cast  
Arriving without purpose  
  
Oh baby call me  
Oh baby call me today  
  
And if I were the king of Rome  
I couldnt be more lonely  
With so much scope to dream and hope  
Someday youll deign to phone me  
  
Oh baby call me  
Oh baby call me today  
  
I long for your inscrutable pale face  
I hunger for your beautiful embrace
