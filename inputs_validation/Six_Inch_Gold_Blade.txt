I stuck a six inch gold blade inside the head of a girl  
She lying through her teeth  
Him lying on his back  
Hands of this onehands off she cried  
Grinning at me from hip to hip  
Hands off pretty baby tough blood then so soft to slip  
Ooohh yeah  
I stuck a six inch gold blade in the head of a girl  
Sharks fun slices sugerbed slices that pretty redhead  
I love you now me I love you  
Laughter laughter  
Oh baby those skinny girls theyre so quick to murder  
Ooohhh yeah  
Shake it baby cmon shake shake it baby
