I close my eyes so I dont have to see  
I shut my heart and tell my mind to run and flee  
Once I was flying flying flying high  
I touched the sky  
  
As long as I fall I dont hit the ground  
As long as I fall Im safe and sound  
As long as I fly I sure cannot die  
I dont need to hear the call as long as I fall  
  
Would I have time to change reality  
I would become the man the man I could never be  
Oh my God please tell me how to break free  
Once I was flying flying flying high  
I touched the sky  
  
As long as I fall I dont hit the ground  
As long as I fall Im safe and sound  
As long as I fly I sure cannot die  
I dont need to hear the call as long as I fall  
As long as I fall  
  
As long as I fall I got no reason to care  
As long as I fall I got no problem to bear  
I dont need to bother what I did or did not  
I would cry out in pain but  
  
As long as I fall I dont hit the ground  
As long as I fall Im safe and sound  
I dont need to face no blame or disgrace  
No reason to change at all  
  
As long as I fall I dont hit the ground  
As long as I fall Im safe and sound  
As long as I fly I sure cannot die  
I dont need to hear the call as long as I fall
