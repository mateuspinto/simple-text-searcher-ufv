I sit alone in the golden daylight  
But all I see is a silver sky  
For in my fancy I sweep away light  
And keep my image of the sky  
Just the way we like it you and I  
  
All through the day I dream about the night  
I dream about the night Here with you  
All through the day I wish away the time  
Until the time when Im here with you  
  
Down falls the sun I run to meet you  
The evening mist melts away  
Down smiles the moon And soon your lips recall  
The kiss I dreamed of all through the day
