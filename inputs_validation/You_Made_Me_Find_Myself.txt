Bet you thought my world  
was over  
Bet you thought Id crash and burn  
You thought Id never  
Pick myself up off the floor  
But baby you were wrong  
Just like before  
  
Chorus  
I used to breathe you  
I used to need you  
I used to hang on every word  
that you say  
It used to please you  
To try to make me  
someone else  
And I thank you from  
My heart for your help  
Cause you made me find  
myself  
  
I used to think if I surrendered  
Id be the perfect one for you  
But I swear I cant remember  
A single day of happiness with  
you  
  
Chorus  
  
No Im not going back in time  
And theres a price for being  
strong  
But I can live with who I am  
  
Chorus  
  
You made me find my dreams  
You made me find my love  
You made me find myself  
Thank you thank you
