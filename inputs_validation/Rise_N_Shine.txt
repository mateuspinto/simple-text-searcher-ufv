Dawn wakes the silence  
Of a fainted lullaby  
Day breaks the eyelid  
From a song sung in my eye  
  
Night rests in peace  
As the sun mourns the sky  
Alls accounted for sheep  
Over a horizons I  
  
Rise rise n shine  
A new day is coming  
Rise rise in time  
For everything under the sun  
  
And when you see  
A south wind blow  
Forecasting you will know  
A hot day will be on the way  
foolish one  
You analyze  
The earth and the sky  
I ask you why  
You cant analyze the signs  
Of the present time  
  
I had a dream  
Not unlike the one from old  
Of a man king  
Whose head was made of gold  
Stand castles of sand  
Weather the sundials rise n fall  
Chasing wind through your hands  
til water runs dry the well  
  
Dream daniel dream  
For whats yet to come  
See daniel see  
For everything under the sun  
  
And in the west  
A cloud appears  
For shadows of  
A coming shower near  
Oh so near  
hypocrites  
You analyze  
The earth and the sky  
I ask you why  
You cant analyze the signs  
Of the present time  
  
Vanity  
Yes all is vanity  
Vanity  
Yes alls futility  
  
For one that dies  
Anothers born  
Where laughters heard  
Comforters mourn  
Theres a time for  
Everything  
  
A song for love  
Even abhor  
An olive branch  
Or winters war  
Theres a time for  
Everything under the sun
