About a thousand years before it came to pass it was said that it would be  
A virgin would be found to be with child and give birth to our king  
And they laid him in a manger in the town of Bethlehem  
Born there in a stable cause there was no room in the inn  
  
And when he grew to be a man he began to teach  
He came just for you and me to set the captives free  
And he gladly gave his life for us without one word he died  
So we could live forever in heaven by his side  
  
And he gladly gave his life for us without one word He died  
So we could live forever in Heaven by his side  
  
And all he asks of you and me is simply to believe  
That baby boy in Bethlehem truly was our king
