Did I ever tell you what happened before  
I was walking in the shadow of my death  
Did I ever tell you what happened before  
I was hiding from the big lie  
Did I ever tell you what happened before  
I was followed by the vision of my god  
Did I ever tell you what happened before  
I was hiding in a dead soul  
  
Come on little fucker can you let me out  
Come on little fucker can you let me out  
Come on little fucker can you let me out  
Come on little fucker can you let me out

Youve been walking in the shadow of my death  
Did I ever tell this has happened before  
Youve been hiding from the big lie  
Did I ever tell this has happened before  
Youve been following the visions of my god  
Did I ever tell this has happened before  
Youve been living in my dead soul  
  
Come on little fucker can you let me out  
Come on little fucker can you let me out  
Come on little fucker can you let me out
