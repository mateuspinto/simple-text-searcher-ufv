L is for the way you look at me  
O is for the only one I see  
V is very very extraordinary  
E is even more than anyone that you adore  
  
And love is all that I can give to you  
Love is more than just a game for two  
Two in love can make it  
Take my heart but please dont break it  
Love was made for me and you
