We are reincarnated souls from that time  
Living on earth heat air and water in this time  
We are reincarnated souls from that time  
Living on earth heat air and water in this time  
  
In the beginning was the word  
And the word manifested itself in the flesh  
Which even become man  
All because of the divine plan  
Man being lower than the angels  
Over all Earth was as he given dominion  
He devised his own destruction  
But the word lives on and on  
  
Who is weary  
Let him come hither  
He who has eyes to see  
Let him look yonder  
All who is thirsty  
Let them drink clear water  
Drink water  
Drink water  
  
We are reincarnated souls from that time  
And we are living on earth heat air and water in this time  
We are reincarnated souls from that time  
And we are living on earth heat air and water in this time  
  
Nothing is new  
Under the sun  
All has been here  
Since time begun  
And with all the years weve spent  
Only changing names  
Protect the innocent  
Like a seed that is planted by the water  
Appear to die before new birth  
Changing its form to another  
Taking on a structure just as the first  
  
He who is weary  
Let him come hither  
Ohoh  
He who has eyes to see  
Let him look yonder  
All who are thirsty  
Let them drink clear water  
Drink water  
Drink water
