Hello  
We havent talked in quite some time  
I know  
I havent been the best  
Of sons  
Hello  
Ive been traveling in  
The desert of my mind  
And I  
Havent found a drop  
Of life  
I havent found a drop  
Of you  
I havent found a drop  
Of water  
  
I try desperately to run through the sand  
As I hold the water  
In the palm of my hand  
Cuz its all that I have  
Its all that I need and  
The waves of the water  
Mean nothing to me  
But I try my best  
And all that I can to  
Hold tightly onto  
Whats left in my hand  
But no matter how  
How tightly I will strain  
The sand will slow me down  
And the water will drain  
Im just being dramatic  
In fact  
Im only at it again  
As an addict with a pen  
Whos addicted to the wind  
As it blows me back and fourth  
Mindless spineless and pretend  
Of course Ill be here again  
See you tomorrow  
But its the end of today  
End of my ways  
As a walking denial  
My trial was filed as a crazy  
Suicidal head case  
But you specialize in dying  
You hear me screaming  
Father  
And Im lying here just crying  
So wash me with your water  
  
Hello  
We havent talked in quite some time  
I know  
I havent been the best
