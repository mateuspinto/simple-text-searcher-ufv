Good God Dont jump  
A boy sat on the ledge  
An old man who had fainted was revived  
And everyone agreed it would be a miracle indeed  
If the boy survived  
  
Save the life of my child  
Cried the desperate mother  
  
The woman from the supermarket  
Ran to call the cops  
He must be high on something someone said  
Though it never made The New York Times  
In The Daily News the caption read  
Save the life of my child  
Cried the desperate mother  
  
A patrol car passing by  
Halted to a stop  
Said officer MacDougal in dismay  
The force cant do a decent job  
Cause the kids got no respect  
For the law today and blah blah blah  
  
Save the life of my child  
Cried the desperate mother  
Whats becoming of the children  
People asking each other  
  
When darkness fell excitement kissed the crowd  
And made them wild  
In an atmosphere of freaky holiday  
When the spotlight hit the boy  
The crowd began to cheer  
He flew away  
  
Oh my Grace I got no hiding place
