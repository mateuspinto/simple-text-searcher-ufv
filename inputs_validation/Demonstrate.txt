Well Jerry at de mike come fe Demonstrate  
Yes Jerry at de mike me come fe Demonstrate  
Me come fe show de crowd a people dat great is great  
Right ya now Mr Jerry at go set tings straight

So listen dem ya styles I man originate  
First of all me wan you know me na exaggerate  
All pirate in de dance me would a evacuate  
Is a whole leap a space I man accommodate  
An a whole leap a gal I accumulate  
  
Round de mile Jerry dont need no associate  
Me chat by meself me no combinate  
Me study very hard because me want graduate  
Up de MC ladder I man Essulate  
To be a boss MC Im a chief candidate  
  
True me fascinate nor irritate and me originate  
Round de classic Microcentre dat is where me locate  
Me no select no tune an Jerry dont operate  
Fe see me lift speaker  box you must fortunate  
Cause asdedance down me gone home me gone go hibernate  
Going home de other night me cant remember de date  
De early hours of de morning before people a wake  
  
Bopsing down de road it was me worst mistake  
Police come draw down pon me an a investigate  
Him say Hey son where you coming from dont you know that its late  
Ive heard about you niggers and the trouble you create  
I said Im coming from a party and me going home straight  
Me just stop a de shop to buy some cigarette an chocolate  
When me explain de situation him stop interrogate  
Turn around jump in a Im panda car an say See you mate  
  
Is a good ting me never cheeky or be obstinate  
Or me could a end up visiting de damn magistrate  
De house way me live in you know it must decorate  
  
An de girl way me love ave to affectionate  
Nem ya Linda lyrics you must penetrate  
So listen every word I man and quotate  
True me talking very clear you no need fe translate  
Cause when me riding pon de riddim me no mek no mistake  
  
Gast contagious disease I man vaccinate  
An true me no wan catch a dose me no fornicate  
De lyrics way me chat dem must variate  
Some time me chat it slow sometime me accelerate  
Dem ya kinds style you must appreciate  
  
nough gal come to me a congratulate  
Dem say Jerry your so good looking can I have you portrait  
I say Yes of course my darling but you know you have to wait  
  
Well dais a something I man have to state  
A trollop is a woman with a whole heap a weight  
Dont tell her to her face cause she will aggravate  
And if she sit down pon you you will suffocate  
  
At de mile is nough excitement I Jerry create  
And you know that its not hard for me to exterminate  
Any boy way come a dance an a duplicate  
A style him get off a Saxon or a old yard tape  
  
I say de lyrics way me chat dem must variate  
An nough people dem a say dont me impertinent  
Any gal way me like we must be intimate  
But me only make love when me in private
