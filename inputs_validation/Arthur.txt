Arthur was born just a plain simple man  
In a plain simple working class position  
Though the world was hard and its ways were set  
He was young and he had so much ambition  
All the way he was overtaken  
By the people who make the big decisions  
But he tried and he tried for a better life  
And a way to improve his own condition  
If only life were easy it would be such fun  
Things would be more equal and be plenty for everyone  
Arthur the worlds gone and passed you by  
Dont you know it dont you know it  
You can cry cry all night but it wont make it right  
Dont ya know it dont ya know it  
  
Arthur we know and we sympathize  
Dont ya know it dont ya know it  
Arthur we like you and want to help you  
Somebody loves you dont you know it  
  
How is your life and your Shangrila  
And your long lost land of Hallelujah  
And your hope and glory has passed you by  
Cant you see what the world is doing to ya  
And now we see your children  
Sailing off in the setting sun  
To a new horizon  
Where theres plenty for everyone  
Arthur could be  
That the world was wrong  
Dont ya know it dont ya know it  
Arthur could be  
You were right all along  
Dont ya know it I hope ya know it  
Now we know and we sympathize  
Wed like to help you and understand you  
Dont ya know it dont ya know it  
Somebody loves you dont ya know it  
Dont ya know it dont ya know it  
  
Arthur the worlds gone and passed you by  
Dont ya know it dont ya know it  
You can cry cry all night  
But it wont make it right  
Dont ya know it dont ya know it  
Arthur we read you and understand you  
Arthur we like
