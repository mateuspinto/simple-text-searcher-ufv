Words and music by Pete Seeger  
  
My grandma she can make a soup  
With a little a this n that  
She can feed the whole sloop group  
With a little a this n that  
Stone soup You know the story  
Stone soup Who needs the glory  
But with grandma cookin no need to worry  
Just a little a this n that  
  
Grandma likes to make a garden grow  
With a little a this n that  
But she likes to have the ground just so  
With a little a this n that  
Not too loose and not too firm  
In the spring it s all got to be turned  
In the fall lots of compost to feed the worms  
With a little a this n that  
  
Grandma knows we can build a future  
With a little a this n that  
And a few arguments never never hurt ya  
With a little a this n that  
True this worlds in a hell of a fix  
And some say oil and water dont mix  
But they dont know a saladmakers tricks  
With a little a this n that  
  
The world to come may be like a song  
With a little a this n that  
To make everybody want to sing along  
With a little a this n that  
A little dissonance aint no sin  
A little skylarking to give us all a grin  
Who knows  
But Gods got a plan for the people to win  
With a little a this n that
