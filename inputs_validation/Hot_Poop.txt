Frank zappa guitar piano lead vocals  
Billy mundi drums vocals yak  
Bunk gardner woodwinds  
Roy estrada electric bass vocals  
Don preston retired  
Jimmy carl black drums trumpet vocals  
Ian underwood piano woodwinds  
Motorhead sherwood soprano baritone saxophone  
Suzy creamcheese telephone  
Dick barber snorks  
He has work in the control zone  
Because home doziness loves the dirt knobs  
They think it is the way they can create  
Wonder what everyone else is whispering about
