I Will Tell The World  
Words and music by Ray Boltz  
I have a heart I have a voice  
I have a testimony  
I am a follower of Christ  
He is the one and only  
Way to heaven  
I am so glad I met Him  
I want everyone to know  
Chorus  
I will tell the world  
He is returning  
I have touched the fire  
I feel it burning  
Until everyone on earth has heard  
I will tell the world  
I have a dream I have a goal  
I have a destination  
His call is burning in my soul  
It is an obligation I will cherish  
Oh may it never perish  
Father make my voice Your own  
Chorus  
To any nation to any land  
On this world below  
Holy Spirit here I am  
Send me I will go  
Chorus repeat
