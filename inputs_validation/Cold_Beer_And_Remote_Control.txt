All of my days have been misspent  
Stuffing out the sofa and the antennas bent  
Inside my hearts bustin out at the seams  
I work for the impossible american dream  
  
I got a job at the grocery store  
A few bucks an hour and not much more  
The world comes in just to take things away  
They eat it all up and then they sleep into day  
  
I try not to care I would lose my mind  
Running round the same thing time after time  
Only two things bound to soothe my soul  
Cold beer and remote control  
  
Now once upon a time I was nobodys fool  
once upon a fool  
Two jobs and showing up for school  
I guess it comes apart so little by little  
You dont know your there till your stuck in the middle  
I try not to care I would lose my mind  
Running round the same thing time after time  
And only two things bound to soothe my soul  
Cold beer and remote control  
  
Sit down  
sit down sit down  
The room is dark  
the room is dark  
The blurry graffiti on the benches  
Across at the public park  
The plastics black and buttoned  
the plastics black  
The haze is blue  
the haze is blue  
And all I want is nothing to do  
  
cause its a long walk to the bus stop  
Its a long wait for the turning clock  
Its a twotired car sitting up on the blocks  
And things I put aside like that pile of rocks  
  
I try not to care I would lose my mind  
Running round the same thing time after time  
And only two things bound to soothe my soul  
Cold beer and remote control  
  
Yes I try not to care I would lose my mind  
all of my days have been misspent  
Running round the same thing time after time  
stuffing out the sofa and the antennas bent  
And only two things bound to soothe my soul  
inside my hearts busting out at the seams  
Cold beer and remote control  
i work for the impossible american dream  
Yeah  
  
Cold beer and remote control  
i said I guess it comes apart so little by little yeah  
Yeah  
Beer and remote control  
i said I guess it comes apart so little by little yeah  
Yeah
