My big day it was the biggest day of my life  
It was the summit of my long career  
But I felt so down and I drank too much beer  
And my manager said that I should not appear  
I walked out onto the stage and started to speak  
The first night Ive missed for a couple of years  
I explained to the crowed and they started to jeer  
And just when I wanted no one to be there  
All of my friends were there  
Not just my friends but their best friends too  
All of my friends were there to stand and stare  
Say what they may all of their friends need not stay  
Those who laughed were not friends anyway  
All of my friends were there to stand and stare  
  
Days went by I walked around dressed in a disguise  
I wore a mustache and I parted my hair  
And gave the impression that I did not care  
But oh the embarrassment oh the despair  
Came the day helped with a few last glasses of gin  
I nervously mounted the stage once again  
Got through my performance and no one complained  
Thank God I can go back to normal again  
I went to that old cafe  
Where I had been in much happier days  
And all of my friends were there  
And no one cared  
Say what they may all of my friends were there  
Not just my friends but their best friends too  
All of my friends were there  
Now I dont care
