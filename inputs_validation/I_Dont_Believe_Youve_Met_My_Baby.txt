Last night my tears they were fallin  
I went to bed so sad and blue  
Then I had a dream of you  
I dreamed I was strollin in the evenin  
Underneath the harvest moon  
I was thinkin about you  
And then you met me in the moonlight  
The stars were shining in your eyes  
But another was there too  
I dont believe youve met my baby  
You looked at her you looked at me  
I wondered who you were talkin to  
  
I shook the hand of your stranger  
But I was shaking more inside  
Cause I was still wonderin who  
Your arm was restin on her shoulder  
You smiled at her she smiled at you  
Her eyes were filled with victory  
She said my brother wants to marry  
And then my heart was filled with ease  
I knew that you would marry me  
  
Oh I dont believe youve met my baby  
You looked at her you looked at me  
I knew that you would marry me  
I dont believe youve met my baby
