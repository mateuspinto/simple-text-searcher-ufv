If you could see me now  
The one who said that he would rather roam  
The one who said hed rather be alone  
If you could only see me now  
  
If I could hold you now  
Just for a moment if I could really make you mine  
Just for a while turn back the hands of time  
If I could only hold you now  
  
Cause Ive been too long in the wind  
Too long in the rain  
Takin any comfort that I can  
Looking back and longing for the freedom of my chains  
And lying in your lovin arms again  
  
If you could hear me now  
Singin somewhere in the lonely night  
Dreaming of the arms that hold me tight  
If you could only hear me now  
  
Cause Ive been too long in the wind  
Too long in the rain  
Takin any comfort that I can  
Looking back and longing for the freedom of my chains  
And lying in your lovin arms again  
  
I can almost feel your lovin arms again
