The night was clear and the moon was yellow  
And the leaves came tumbling down  
  
I was standing on the corner when I heard my bulldog bark  
He was barkin at the two men who were gamblin in the dark  
It was Stagger Lee and Billy two men who gambled late  
Stagger Lee threw seven Billy swore that he threw eight  
  
Stagger Lee told Billy I cant let you go with that  
You have won all my money and my brand new stetson hat  
Stagger Lee started off goin down that railroad track  
He said I cant get you Billy but dont be here when I come back  
  
Stagger Lee went home and he got his fortyfour  
Said Im goin to the barroom just to pay that debt I owe  
Stagger Lee went to the barroom and he stood across the barroom door  
He said Nobody move and he pulled his fortyfour  
  
Stagger Lee shot Billy oh he shot that poor boy so bad  
Till the bullet came through Billy and it broke the bartenders glass
