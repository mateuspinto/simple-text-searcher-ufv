Well I though I depended upon you  
At least that used to be what was happening with me  
In those times of our first sweet communion  
Nothing got in the way I heard your voice everyday  
When I first trusted you gave my life to you  
When I trusted you  
  
Well theres something that needs to be cleared up  
I feel so sorry inside that my first love has died  
Cause Ive tried in my own strength to follow  
When Ive known all along I just couldnt go wrong  
If Id only trusted you give my life to you  
If Id trusted you ooh trusted you  
  
Well I though I depended upon you  
At least that used to be what was happening with me  
In those times of our first sweet communion  
Nothing got in the way I heard your voice everyday  
When I first trusted you I gave my life to you  
When I trusted you
