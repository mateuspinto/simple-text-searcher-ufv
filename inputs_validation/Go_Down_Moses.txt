Go down Moses  
Way down in Egypt land  
Tell all Pharaohs to  
Let my people go  
  
When Israel was in Egypt land  
Let my people go  
  
Oppressed so hard they could not stand  
Let my people go  
  
So God sayeth Go down Moses  
Way down in Egypt land  
Tell all Pharaohs to  
Let my people go  
  
So Moses went to Egypt land  
Let my people go  
  
He made all Pharaohs understand  
Let my people go  
Yes the Lord said Go down Moses  
Way down in Egypt land  
Tell all Pharaohs to  
Let my people go  
  
Thus spoke the Lord  
Bold Moses said  
Let my people go  
If not Ill smite your firstborn dead  
Let my people go  
  
God the Lord said Go down Moses  
Way down in Egypt land  
Tell all Pharaohs to  
Let my people go  
  
Tell all Pharaohs  
To  
Let my people go
