Watch the flowers grow watch em grow  
Did you ever see a flower grow  
If you did then you would surely know  
Love is like the flowers  
Takes a lot of hours  
If you really want to know  
Watch the flowers grow  
  
Listen to my thoughts and take a ride  
I shall give you all youve been denied  
First you gotta slow down  
Listen to my sweet sound  
If you really want to know  
Watch the flowers grow  
  
Over the mountain theres a sweet meadow  
A breeze is blowin so take my hand and we can  
Watch the flowers grow  
  
Let me take you where the flowers grow  
Let me be the one who told you so  
Ill love you forever  
I will leave you never  
Baby lets go  
Watch the flowers grow  
  
Watch the flowers grow watch em grow  
Watch the flowers grow watch em grow
