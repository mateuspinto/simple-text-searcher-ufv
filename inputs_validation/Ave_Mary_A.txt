Motorcycles in the parking lot  
Revving their engines and it just wont stop  
Matches the noise screaming in my head  
Houston I think we got a problem  
  
Where does everybody go when they go  
They go so fast I dont think they know  
We hate so fast  
And we love too slow  
London I think we got a problem  
  
And when I think about it  
I just cant think about it  
I try to drink about it  
I keep spinnin  
  
Ave Mary A  
Where did you go  
Where did you go  
How did you know to get out of a world gone mad  
Help me let go  
Of the chaos around me  
The devil that hounds me  
I need you to tell me  
  
Child be still  
Child be still  
  
Broken hearts all around the spot  
I cant help thinking that we lost the plot  
Suicide bomber and a student shot  
Tokyo I think we got a problem  
  
But for that they got a pill  
If that dont kill you then the side effects will  
If we dont kill each other then the side effects will  
Cape Town I think we got a problem  
  
Ave Mary A  
Where did you go  
Where did you go  
How did you know to get out of a world gone mad  
Help me let go  
Of the chaos around me  
The devil that hounds me  
I need you to tell me  
  
Child be still  
  
If the darkest hour comes  
Before the light  
Where is the light  
Where is the light  
  
If the darkest hour comes before the light  
Where is the light  
Where is the light  
Where is the light yeah  
  
Ave Mary A  
Where did you go  
Where did you go  
How did you know to get out of a world gone mad  
Help me help me let go  
Of the chaos around me  
The devil that hounds me  
I need you to tell me  
  
Child be still  
Child be still  
Child be still
