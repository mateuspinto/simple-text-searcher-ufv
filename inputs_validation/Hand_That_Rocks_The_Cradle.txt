Holidays are comin  
The kids are getting fat  
Put another penny in the corporation hat  
Theres computer consolation now  
For every boy and girl  
Coz the hand that rocks the cradle  
Is the hand that rules the world  
  
Sony in the nursery no need to turn the page  
The cartoon generation are soon to come of age  
Virtual relationships untouched by human hands  
Laying their foundation in the ever shifting sand  
  
If politics is just for fools equality a dream  
Then youd better wear protection so you never hear them scream  
  
Animated babysitters always there to play  
Will keep the undesirables a million miles away  
Everything is changing but the song remains the same  
Asylum has been locked away the seekers has been framed
