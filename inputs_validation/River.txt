Its coming on Christmas  
Theyre cutting down trees  
Theyre putting up reindeer  
And singing songs of joy and peace  
Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on  
  
But it dont snow here  
It stays pretty green  
Im going to make a lot of money  
Then Im going to quit this crazy scene  
Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on  
  
I wish I had a river so long  
I would teach my feet to fly  
I wish I had a river I could skate away on  
I made my baby cry  
  
He tried hard to help me  
You know he put me at ease  
And he loved me so naughty  
Made me weak in the knees  
Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on  
  
Im so hard to handle  
Im selfish and Im sad  
Now Ive gone and lost the best baby  
That I ever had  
I wish I had a river I could skate away on  
  
Oh I wish I had a river so long  
I would teach my feet to fly  
I wish I had a river  
I could skate away on  
I made my baby say goodbye  
  
Its coming on Christmas  
Theyre cutting down trees  
Theyre putting up reindeer  
And singing songs of joy and peace  
I wish I had a river I could skate away on
