Im crazy crazy for feeling so lonely  
Im crazy crazy for feeling so blue  
I knew that youd love me as long as you wanted  
And then some day youd leave me for somebody new  
  
Worry why do I let myself worry  
Wondering what in the world did I do  
Im crazy for thinking that my love could hold you  
Im crazy for trying and crazy for crying  
And Im crazy for loving you  
Im crazy for thinking
