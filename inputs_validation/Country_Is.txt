Country is sittin on the back porch listen to the whippoorwills late in the
day  
Country is mindin your business helpin a stranger if he comes your way  
Country is livin in the city knowin your people knowin your kind  
Country is what you make it country is all in your mind  
  
Country is workin for a living thinkin your own thoughts lovin your town  
Country is teachin your children find out whats right and stand your ground  
Country is a havin the good times listen to the music singing your part  
Country is walkin in the moonlight country is all in your heart
