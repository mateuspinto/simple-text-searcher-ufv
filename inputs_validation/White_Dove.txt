A place without a name  
Under a burning sky  
Theres no milk and honey here  
In the land of God  
  
Someone holds a sign  
It says we are human too  
And while the sun goes down  
The world goes by  
  
White dove  
Fly with the wind  
Take our hope under your wings  
For the world to know  
That hope will not die  
Where the children cry  
  
Waves big like a house  
Theyre stranded on a piece of wood  
To leave it all behind  
To start again  
  
But instead of a new life  
All they find is a door thats closed  
And they keep looking for  
A place called hope  
  
White dove  
Fly with the wind  
Take our hope under your wings  
For the world to know  
That hope will not die  
Where the children cry  
  
Na na  
Na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na  
Na na  
Na na na na  
Na na na na na  
  
Can anyone tell me why can anyone tell me why  
The children of the world the children of the world  
Have to pay the price pay another price  
  
And now your telling me  
Youve seen it all before  
I know thats right but still  
It breaks my heart  
  
Well the golden lamb we sent  
Makes us feel better now  
But you know its just a drop  
In a sea of tears  
  
White dove  
Fly with the wind  
Take our hope under your wings  
For the world to know  
That hope will not die  
Where the children cry  
  
White dove  
Fly with the wind  
Take our hope under your wings  
For the world to know  
That hope will not die  
Where the children cry  
  
Na na  
Na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na  
Na na  
Na na na na  
Na na na na na
