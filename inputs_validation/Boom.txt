Im walking through your streets  
Where all your moneys earning  
Where all your buildings crying  
And clueless neckties working  
Revolving fake lawn houses  
Housing all your fears  
Desensitized by TV  
  
Overbearing advertising  
God of consumers  
And all your crooked pictures looking good  
Mirrors filtering information through the public eye  
Designed for profit sharing  
Your neighbor what a guy  
  
Boom Boom Boom Boom  
Every time you drop a bomb  
You kill the god your child has born  
Boom Boom Boom  
  
Modern globalization  
Coupled with condemnations  
Unnecessary death  
Matador corporations  
Puppeting your frustrations with a blinded flag  
Manufacturing consent is the name of the game  
The bottom line is money nobody gives a fuck  
  
4000 hungry children  
Leave us per hour from starvation  
While billions are spent on bombs  
Creating death showers  
  
Boom Boom Boom  
Every time you drop a bomb  
You kill the god your child has born  
  
Boom Boom Boom  
Every time you drop a bomb  
You kill the god your child has born  
  
Boom Boom Boom  
Every time you drop a bomb  
You kill the god your child has born  
  
Why must we kill our own kind  
  
Boom Boom Boom  
Every time you drop a bomb  
You kill the god your child has born  
  
Boom Boom Boom  
Every time you drop a bomb  
You kill the god your child has born  
  
Boom boom boom boom boom  
Every time you drop the bomb
