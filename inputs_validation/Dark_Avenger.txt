He broke the laws of the elders  
So they plucked out his eye  
Took his land and fortune  
Left him to die  
  
Bound on the shoreline  
Left for the tide  
Sees his life blood leaving  
Circling lower the vultures fly  
  
These bones may be broken  
But the spirit cant die  
And the Gods see his anguish  
And give him a sign  
  
From the floor of the ocean  
The ship of the lost souls rise  
And they take him where no one sleeps  
while the undead cry  
Where no one sleeps while the undead cry  
  
And in the world above  
The elders sing  
On his land they live  
Let deaths bell ring  
  
He was met at the gate of Hades  
By the Guardian of the Lost Souls  
The Keeper of the Unavenged  
And He did say to him  
Let ye not pass Abaddon return to the world from whence you came  
And seek payment not only for thine own anguish  
But vindicate the souls of the unavenged  
  
And they placed in his hands a sword made for him called Vengeance  
Forged in brimstone and tempered by the woeful tears of the unavenged  
  
And to carry him on his journey back to the upper world  
They brought forth their demon horse called Black Death  
A grim steed so fearsome in might and black in color  
That he could stand as one with the darkness  
Save for his burning eyes of crimson fire  
  
And on that night they rode up from Hell  
The pounding of his hooves did clap like thunder  
  
Burning death destruction raping the daughters and wives  
In blood I take my payment in full with their lives  
  
No one can escape me on Black Death I ride  
When kissed by the sword of Vengeance  
Your head lays there by your side  
I take the lives of all that I once knew  
The torn flesh of a slow death waits for you  
  
Burning death destruction raping the daughters and wives  
In blood I take my payment in full with their lives  
  
I spare not land or servants my wake is smoke and flame  
I take their wives and daughters  
They stand there watching watching  
Hoping to gain their livese but when Im through they know they must pay
