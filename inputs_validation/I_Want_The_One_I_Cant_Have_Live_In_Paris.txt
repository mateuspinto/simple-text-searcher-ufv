On the day that your mentality  
Decides to try and catch up with your biology  
Please come round because I want the one I cant have  
And its driving me mad its all over all over all over my face  
  
On the day that your mentality  
Catches up with your biology  
I want the one I cant have  
And its driving me mad its all over all over all over my face  
  
A double bed and a stalwart lover for sure  
These are the riches of the poor  
A double bed and a stalwart lover for sure  
These are the riches of the poor  
  
And I want the one I cant have  
And its driving me mad its all over all over my face  
  
A tough kid who sometimes swallows nails  
Raised on prisoners aid  
He killed a policeman when he was thirteen  
And somehow that really impressed me  
Its written all over my face  
  
These are the riches of the poor  
These are the riches of the poor  
I want the one I cant have  
And Jesus its driving me mad its written all over my face  
  
On the day that your mentality  
Catches up with your biology  
And if you ever need self validation  
Just meet me in the alley by the railway station  
Its all over my face oh yes oh
