Broken down feeling naked  
Leaving me unfulfilled  
Promising compromise  
Championing mediocrity  
  
Time and time again  
What you said aint what you mean  
Even if all my bones are broken  
I will drag myself back from the edge to  
  
Kill the King The King is dead Long live the King  
  
Kill the King The King is dead Long live the  
King  
I am the King God save the King  
  
Kill the King The King is dead  
I am the King Long live the King  
Kill the King The King is dead  
I am the King Long live the King  
  
I reveal a deceiver  
In the highest seat in the land  
His idle hands the Devils workshop  
Generate more smoke than heat  
  
Time and time again  
What you said aint what you mean  
Even if all my bones are broken  
I will drag myself back from the edge to  
  
Kill the King The King is dead Long live the King  
  
Kill the King The King is dead Long live the  
King  
I am the King God save the King  
  
Kill the King The King is dead  
I am the King Long live the King  
Kill the King The King is dead  
I am the King Long live the King  
  
A new precedent in pain a new precedent in pain  
Mankind is blown to dust mankind is blown to dust  
An explosion of the Brain an explosion of the  
Brain  
Spontaneously combust spontaneously combust  
  
Kill the King The King is dead Long live the  
King  
I am the King  
Kill the King I The King is dead I am Long live  
the King  
I am the King  
Kill the King I The King is dead I am Long live  
the King  
I am the King  
Kill the King I The King is dead I am Long live  
the King  
I am the King
