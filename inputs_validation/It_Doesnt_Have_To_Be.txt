You are on one side  
And I am on the other  
Are we divided  
You are on one side  
I am on the other  
Are we divided  
Why cant we live together  
There are no rights  
This isnt your decision  
We need to talk of changing things  
But no one wants to listen  
It doesnt have to be like that  
It doesnt have to be like that  
It doesnt have to be like that  
  
A heart on the inside  
The same as any other  
Are we divided  
Someone always has to suffer  
We are broken  
Theres no one left to change it  
Is that the way it has to be  
Why cant we rearrange it  
It doesnt have to be like that  
One against one  
It doesnt have to be like that  
One against one  
It doesnt have to be like that  
What is the secret  
In calling me a brother  
Are we divided  
Always one against the other  
We are strong now  
Put down the ammunition  
For what we know is right  
Is gonna breakdown this division  
It doesnt have to be like that  
One against one  
It doesnt have to be like that  
One against one  
It doesnt have to be like that  
One against one  
One against one  
It doesnt have to be like that  
You are one side  
And I am on the other  
Are we divided
