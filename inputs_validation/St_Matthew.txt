She walks around on brass rings that never touch her feet  
She speaks in conversations that never are complete  
And looking over past things that she has never done  
She calls herself St Matthew when she is on the run  
  
She stoops down to gather partly shattered men  
And knows that when its over it will start again  
Both the times she smiled it was a portrait of the sun  
She calls herself St Matthew when she is on the run  
  
Part of it is loneliness and knowing how steal  
But most if it is weariness from standing up trying not to kneel  
  
She discovered three new ways that she could help the dead  
Sometime she must raise her hand to tell you what she said  
Then standing in a landslide she suddenly becomes  
A girl thats named St Matthew when she is on the run  
  
Part of it is loneliness and knowing how steal  
But most if it is weariness from standing up trying not to kneel  
  
She discovered three new ways that she could help the dead  
Sometime she must raise her hand to tell you what she said  
Then standing in a landslide she suddenly becomes  
A girl thats named St Matthew when she is on the run
