Let um feel the beat first  
Im bout to come through your stereo  
Should my rhyme start with the hook  
Start with the hook  
  
To my people who dont want to go to work  
Thank God its Friday  
Cover me she bout to put up her skirt  
Thank God its Friday  
  
Do Your mom now you act so berserk  
Thank God its Friday  
Whats the track whats the track girl  
She dont want to she dont want to work on Monday  
I want to thank my hood  
  
For makin me a star before I had fast cars  
And couldnt tell the difference between Whoppers and caviar  
Before the fame  
Way before things changed  
  
All I wanted to do was freestyle and get a name  
I used to work at the fast food restaurant  
For minimum wage  
Dreamin Im on stage  
  
At 17 I left the house  
Cause my father was a minister  
And I didnt want the Marvin route  
Whats goin on  
  
Today to sell a song you need a video with soft porn  
MCs in the industry  
You want to tip  
Dont let them pimp you like Goldy  
  
And tell Sony they better have my money  
Cause I play wit the Comodores and be like Lionel Richie  
Low Income I stay so hungry that if 50 Cent came to rob me  
Hed be part of my charity  
I want to thank my hood  
  
To my people cuttin here in the shops  
Thank God its Friday  
To the thugs sweatin up in the chop shops  
Yo its Friday  
  
To my people that dont got no job  
Everyday its Friday  
Whats the track whats the track yo  
She dont want to she dont want to work on Monday  
All the Ladies sing  
  
I dont feel  
Like cookin you no breakfast  
This mornin  
Wyclef All my hoodlums say  
  
You dont have  
To cook me breakfast  
Cause your girlfriend will  
After you leave  
I want to thank my hood  
  
For the love of money  
I know kids wholl slit your throat  
Friday the 13th  
Jason wit a trench coat  
  
But you cant scare Suzie  
Cause her man got so many uzis youd think he was Cadivi  
Meanwhile shes getting her nails done  
Crystal clear so they could shine like wit diamonds  
  
Its such a shame what happened last week  
Man they found her under the sheets with a letter from the Son of Sam  
It said to tell New York I aint sleepin  
You want to be clubbin then you better pack your heat in  
  
And to my man G Swar Rest in Piece  
I still poor liquor  
1 draw on the cocoa leaf  
Inhale exhale smoke grasses  
  
Polices in the area but aint no need to panic  
You wit Wyclef you getting in  
If not then we gonna make CNN  
I want to thank my hood  
  
To my people who dont want to go to work  
Thank God its Friday  
Cover me she bout to put up her skirt  
Thank God its Friday  
Do your mom know you act so berserk  
  
Thank God its Friday  
Whats the track whats the track girl  
She dont want to she dont want to work on Monday  
Yo to my people cuttin here in the shops  
  
Thank God its Friday  
To the thugs sweatin up in the chop shops  
Yo its Friday  
To my people who dont got no job  
  
Everyday its Firday  
Whats the track whats the track yo  
She dont want to she dont want to work on Monday  
All the Ladies sing  
  
I dont feel  
Like cookin you no breakfast  
This mornin  
Wyclef All my hoodlums say  
  
You dont have  
To cook me breakfast  
Cause your girlfriend will  
After you leave  
  
Daddy play that guitar
