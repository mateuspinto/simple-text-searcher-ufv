Play me  
Is this what you wanted This is what you get  
Turned all your lives into this shit  
You never accepted or treated me fair  
Blame me for what I believe and I wear  
You fucked yourselves and you raised these sheep  
The blue and the withered seeds you will reap  
You never gave me a chance to be me  
Or even a fuckin chance just to be  
But I have to show you that you played a role  
And I will destroy you with one simple hole  
The world that hates me has taken its toll  
But now I have finally taken control  
You wanted so bad to make me this thing  
And I want you now to just kill the King  
An I am not sorry an I am not sorry  
This is what you you deserve  
I am not sorry an I am not sorry  
This is what you deserve  
An I am not sorry an I am not sorry  
King kill thirty three  
This is what you you deserve  
King kill thirty three  
An I am not sorry an I am not sorry  
King kill thirty three  
This is what you you deserve  
King kill thirty three  
King kill thirty three  
King kill thirty three
