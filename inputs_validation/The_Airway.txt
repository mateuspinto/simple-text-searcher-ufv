When I am fast asleep  
I dream and see you floating high above me  
And I awake at dawn  
Before the rays of morning paint the front lawn  
From on the bedroom floor  
I watch you sailing far above the seashore  
In deep Atlantic skies  
You float as I look aft to watch the moon rise  
Above the avenue  
I search above the clouds trying to see you  
But you are just a blur  
In the sky when you parachute over the harbor  
  
I can see  
You above with the ocean around me  
If I could only stay  
Overhead in the airway  
You sail through  
Endless sky with the evening around you  
When Im out on the bay  
Youre aloft in the airway  
  
When Im alone at night  
I dream you paint the stars against the twilight  
Suspended in the air  
I wish your silhouette would always stay there  
When I am on the beach  
I watch you held aloft way out of my reach  
But I can not take flight  
Or float upon the air the way that you might  
When I am in the sea  
You gazed down from the sky trying to see me  
But I am just a blur  
Through the waves as I scuba dive below the harbor  
  
The airway  
You and I in the airway  
Aloft in the airway  
In love in the airway  
  
I can see  
You above with the ocean around me  
If I could only stay  
Overhead in the airway  
You sail through  
Endless sky with the evening around you  
When Im out on the bay  
Youre aloft in the airway
