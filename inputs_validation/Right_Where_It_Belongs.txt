See the animal in his cage that you built  
Are you sure what side youre on  
Better not look him too closely in the eye  
Are you sure what side of the glass you are on  
See the safety of the life you have built  
Everything where it belongs  
Feel the hollowness inside of your heart  
And its all right where it belongs  
  
What if everything around you  
Isnt quite as it seems  
What if all the world you think you know  
Is an elaborate dream  
And if you look at your reflection  
Is it all you want it to be  
What if you could look right through the cracks  
Would you find yourself find yourself afraid to see  
  
What if all the worlds inside of your head  
Just creations of your own  
Your devils and your gods all the living and the dead  
And you really oughta know  
You can live in this illusion  
You can choose to believe  
You keep looking but you cant find the ones  
Are you hiding in the trees  
  
What if everything around you  
Isnt quite as it seems  
What if all the world you used to know  
Is an elaborate dream  
And if you look at your reflection  
Is it all you want it to be  
What if you could look right through the cracks  
Would you find yourself find yourself afraid to see
