Fabolous  
YeahUhh  
I know I make you want to leave the one you with  
But I aint Usher Raymond  
Im the kid that they rush to blamin for the crush they claimin  
Who can make em blush the same when I ask  
  
Whats my name and they yell  
FAbe Ohh  
You shouldnt have even brought her my direction  
Unless she was handcuffed with an order of protection Yeah  
Im talkin wreckless now  
Cause Im the reason that your girlfriends are your exs nownigga  
  
Mike Shorey  
Im the fella that keep em yellin and its nuttin to get em  
I dont sweat em its what I tell em  
And they quickly forget em  
And I bet em I get them to forget the day that they met em  
  
And I let em cause I can spend em  
And its more then the denim  
But Ive been  
Born to move while you dudes be sleeping  
  
The coupe on 22s keep the Shorey sneaking  
And she wont tell the truth she too used to creepin  
The mic is in the booth its the truth Im speaking  
  
Fabolous  
Any girl I gave it to  
cant even go love another man  
I give it to em like no other brother can  
She say my man can barely move me  
  
Before you made me scream like a scary movie  
On top of that  
Im smoother then the rest of the gangsters  
And I knew that dude you met was a wanksta  
  
Oh  
Damn homie  
Your girl is with the street Fab Homie  
And she aint fuckin with you  
  
Mike Shorey  
Its a shame you lames  
Cant even maintain your thangs  
And its insane the way that she gave me brain  
I pimp things the same dont forget the name  
  
And when chicks peep the chain they just cant restrain  
Shorty dont try to fake it  
Just up and face it  
Your time is being wasted your mans a basic  
  
See it all in his face that hes cheap and tasteless  
But life is what you make it just watch the bracelet  
  
Fabolous  
I bet your man cant do it like me  
His veins dont pump pimp fluid like me  
Hes nowhere near or like me  
And he probably think keeping you in check  
  
Is buying you a pair of Nikes  
Why wouldnt I get dough from her  
When the digits on my checks look like phone numbers  
Fuck It  
  
You might as well tell that buster skid addle  
Not even Catherine can help him in his custody battle  
Yeah  
  
Mike Shorey  
You can catch me in the club with a case of bub  
And a thick chick to rub niggas hate because  
When they sit in the truck they be quick to fuck  
When Im getting a nut they just lick it up  
  
Im in favor if bust a flow is dangerous  
I dont aim to give shortys our relationships  
But they crave the chips how many the range can fit  
She just changed a bit since I got the hang of it  
  
Fabolous Talking  
Thats right we got the hang of it  
Mike shorey  
Fabolous  
Street family  
Desert storm
