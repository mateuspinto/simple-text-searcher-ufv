If I could stick my hand in my heart  
And spill it all over the stage  
Would it satisfy ya would it slide on by ya  
Would you think the boy is strange Aint he strange  
  
If I could win ya if I could sing ya  
A love song so divine  
Would it be enough for your cheating heart  
If I broke down and cried If I cried  
  
I said I know its only rock n roll but I like it  
I know its only rock n roll but I like it like it yes I do  
Oh well I like it I like it I like it  
I said cant you see that this old boy has been a lonely  
  
If I could stick a knife in my heart  
Suicide right on stage  
Would it be enough for your teenage lust  
Would it help to ease the pain Ease your brain  
  
If I could dig down deep in my heart  
Feelings would flood on the page  
Would it satisfy ya would it slide on by ya  
Would ya think the boys insane Hes insane  
  
I said I know its only rock n roll but I like it  
I know its only rock n roll but I like it like it yes I do  
Oh well I like it yeah I like it I like it  
I said cant you see that this old boy has been a lonely  
  
And do ya think that youre the only girl around  
I bet you think that youre the only woman in town  
  
I said I know its only rock n roll but I like it  
I said I know its only rock n roll but I like it  
I know its only rock n roll but I like it  
I know its only rock n roll but I like it like it yes I do  
Oh well I like it I like it I like it I like it I like it I like it  
Its only rock n roll but I like it  
Its only rock n roll but I like it  
Its only rock n roll but I like it
