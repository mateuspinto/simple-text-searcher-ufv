I recall how we lived  
On the corner of a bed  
And wed speak of a Swedish room  
Of hessian and wood  
And wed talk with our eyes  
Of the sweetness in our lives  
And tomorrows of rich surprise  
Some things we could do  
  
In our madness  
We burnt one hundred days  
Time takes time to pass  
And I still hold some ashes to me  
An Occasional Dream  
  
And wed sleep oh so close  
But not really close our eyes  
Tween the sheets of summer bathed in blue  
Gently weeping nights  
It was long long ago  
And I cant touch your name  
For the days of fater were strong for you  
Danced you far from me  
  
In my madness  
I see your face in mine  
I keep a photograph  
It burns my wall with time  
Time  
An occasional dream  
Of mine  
An occasional dream  
Of mine  
An occasional dream  
Of mine
