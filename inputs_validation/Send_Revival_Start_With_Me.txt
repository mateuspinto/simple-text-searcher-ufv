Were looking to Your promise of old  
That if we pray and humble ourselves  
You will come and heal our land  
You will come  
You will come  
  
Were looking to the promise You made  
That if we turn and look to Your face  
You will come and heal our land  
You will come  
You will come to us  
  
Lord send revival start with me  
For I am one of unclean lips  
And my eyes have seen the King  
Your glory I have glimpsed  
Send revival start with me
