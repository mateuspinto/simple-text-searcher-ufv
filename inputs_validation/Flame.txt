Verse 1  
Greeks  
In 776BC Olympics were begun  
Greece was the only country so naturally we won  
Cheats built bronzes of God Zeus were we honest winners  
The answers no we had more statues than youve had hot dinners  
Our games meant truce was called in war a peace every 4 years  
But wrestling was so violent that bouts could end in tears  
No girls allowed to watch or run that might sound rude  
But makes sense when I tell you we competed nude  
  
Chorus  
FLAME  
Its gonna burn forever  
Love for Olympic heroes  
FLAME  
Wed like one next however  
Sadly its Emperor Nero  
Hey watch it you two alright  
  
Verse 2  
Emperor Nero  
I went from Rome to Greece so I could play them at their games  
In 67AD you know I won Olympic fame  
Told them to include a contest based on poetry  
Not much good for sportsmen no but brilliant for me  
Crashed my racing chariot but still awarded gold  
Hey my Olympics my rules  
To argue would be bold  
I won every medal that was up for grabs  
The crowd loved it well they had to or I would have had them stabbed OK  
  
Chorus  
Greeks  
FLAME  
  
Nero  
Olympic champion thats me  
My games were emperors own round  
  
Greeks  
FLAME  
  
Nero

Nero  
  
SHAME  
  
Verse 3  
Baron de Coubertin  
WAIT not so fast  
  
Im Baron de Coubertin a famous French historian  
I read of the Olympic Games thought I should try restoring them  
Theyd be just like the old days I said but did propose  
That unlike Greeks Victorians should do them wearing clothes  
In 1896 we launched the games in dear old Greece  
Hoped it would make men more morale as well as less obese  
We built a stadium so we could start to play  
Games of the modern Olympics which we still have today  
  
Chorus  
All  
FLAME  
  
Baron de Coubertin  
Im on my personal glory  
But noone remembers my name  
  
All  
FLAME  
  
Baron de Coubertin  
So here to finish our story  
A man who has gold plated fame  
  
Verse 4  
Jesse Owens  
Im Jesse Owens fastest man in 1936  
I took home 4 gold medals yeah but thats just the basics  
What you should know about the fact I was victorious  
Is it made Herr Hitler mad ha it made him furious  
Hitler said Berlin should be the games Germanic base  
So he could show the world Aryans were the master race  
I won in 4 events he had to back pedal  
His evil theory destroyed with every medal  
  
Chorus  
All  
FLAME  
Its gonna burn forever  
Olympics are never in doubt  
FLAME  
A fire of sporting endeavour  
You realise its actually gone out  
Olympic Olympic  
FLAME
