Why did you do it just tonight  
Youre leaving me without goodbye  
Why cant you give me one more try  
Before you went and said goodbye  
Why did you do it just tonight  
  
Sometimes I feel that lifes a show  
But I dont wait dont let you go  
Cause darling heaven can be cold  
With no angel life been told  
Your memories come and memories go  
But my love will always grow  
Why do you flow away my heart  
Why did you break apart  
  
Why did you do it just tonight  
We had two tickets to paradise  
Nobody ever loved you more  
As I always did before  
Why did you do it just tonight  
  
The way you talk the way you smile  
All things you do make life worth while  
Its not a game you play with me  
You give this world some sanity  
Your memories come and memories go  
But my love will always grow  
Look at the stars theyre out tonight  
Be forever by my side
