Cant stop addicted to the shindig  
Cop top he says Im gonna win big  
Choose not a life of imitation  
Distant cousin to the reservation  
Defunkt the pistol that you pay for  
This punk the feeling that you stay for  
In time I want to be your best friend  
East side love is living on the west end  
Knock out but boy you better come to  
Dont die you know the truth is some do  
Go write your message on the pavement  
Burn so bright I wonder what the wave meant  
White heat is screaming in the jungle  
Complete the motion if you stumble  
Go ask the dust for any answers  
Come back strong with 50 belly dancers  
  
Chorus  
The world I love  
The tears I drop  
To be part of  
The wave cant stop  
Ever wonder if its all for you  
The world I love  
The trains I hop  
To be part of  
The wave cant stop  
Come and tell me when its time to  
  
Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone  
So smart shes leading me to ozone  
Music the great communicator  
Use two sticks to make it in the nature  
Ill get you into penetration  
The gender of a generation  
The birth of every other nation  
Worth your weight the gold of meditation  
This chapters going to be a close one  
Smoke rings I know your going to blow one  
All on a spaceship persevering  
Use my hands for everything but steering  
Cant stop the spirits when they need you  
Mop tops are happy when they feed you  
J Butterfly is in the treetop  
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop  
  
The world I love  
The tears I drop  
To be part of  
The wave cant stop  
Ever wonder if its all for you  
The world I love  
The trains I hop  
To be part of  
The wave cant stop  
Come and tell me when its time to  
  
Wait a minute Im passing out  
Win or lose just like you  
Far more shocking  
Than anything I ever knew  
How about you  
Ten more reasons  
Why I need somebody new just like you  
Far more shocking than anything I ever knew  
Right on cue  
  
Cant stop addicted to the shindig  
Chop top he says Im gonna win big  
Choose not a life of imitation  
Distant cousin to the reservation  
Defunkt the pistol that you pay for  
This punk the feeling that you stay for  
In time I want to be your best friend  
East side love is living on the west end  
Knock out but boy you better come to  
Dont die you know the truth is some do  
Go write your message on the pavement  
Burn so bright I wonder what the wave meant  
  
Kick start the golden generator  
Sweet talk but dont intimidate her  
Cant stop the gods from engineering  
Feel no need for any interfering  
Your image in the dictionary  
This life is more than ordinary  
Can I get two maybe even three of these  
Coming from space  
To teach you of the pliedes  
Cant stop the spirits when they need you  
This life is more than just a read through
