For so long my lifes been sewn up tight inside your hold  
And it leaves me there without a place to call my own  
  
I know now what shadows can see  
Theres no point in running less you run with me  
Its half the distance through the open door  
Before you cut me down  
Again  
Let me introduce you to the end  
  
And I feel the cold wind blowing beneath my wings  
It always leads me back to suffering  
But I will soar until the wind whips me down  
Leaves me beaten on unholy ground again  
  
So tired now of paying my dues  
I start out strong but then I always lose  
Its half the distance before you leave me behind  
Its such a waste of time  
  
Chorus  
Cause my shackles  
You wont be  
And my rapture  
You wont believe  
And deep inside you will bleed for me  
  
So here I slave inside of a broken dream  
Forever holding on to splitting seams  
So take your piece and leave me alone to die  
I dont need you to keep my faith alive  
  
I know now what trouble can be  
And why it follows me so easily  
Its half the distance through the open door  
Before you shut me down  
Again  
Let me introduce you to the end  
  
Chorus  
  
Though you know you care  
  
Chorus  
  
And my laughter  
You wont hear  
The faster  
I disappear  
And time will burn your eyes to tears
