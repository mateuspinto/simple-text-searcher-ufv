I wake with the morning light  
Makin love all through the night  
Was I dreaming  
Lyin there I watch you sleep  
One kiss before I leave what youve done to me  
Im gonna tell the world yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
I got a reason to feel alive  
You put the smile on my face  
Therell be no more lonely nights in this town  
Oh no no cause I got a reason  
  
I used to be a restless soul  
All the dreams I could not hold  
I was searchin  
I reached out and you were there  
I never though someone would care  
The way you do  
You got me shakin now girl  
  
I got a reason to feel alive  
You put the smile on my face  
Therell be no more lonely nights in this town  
Oh no no cause I got a reason  
Oh no no  
  
I want your love want you to stay oh yeah  
You know you got me night and day  
Every day  
  
I got a reason to feel alive  
You put the smile on my face  
Therell be no more lonely nights in this town  
Oh no no cause I got a reason yes I do  
Oh no no cause I got a reason yeah  
  
Now I got a reason yeah
