Morning comes too early   
And night time falls too late  
And sometimes all I want to do is wait  
The shadow Ive been hiding in  
Has fled from me today  
  
I know its easier  
To walk away  
Than look it in the eye  
But I will raise a shelter to the sky  
And here beneath this star tonight Ill lie  
She will slowly yield the light  
As I awaken from the longest night  
  
Dreams are shaking set sirens waking up tired eyes  
With the light the memories all rush into his head  
By a candle stands a mirror of his heart and soul she dances  
She was dancing through the night above his bed  
And walking to the window  
  
He throws the shutters out against the wall  
And from an ivory tower hears her call  
Let light surround you  
  
Its been a long long time  
Hes had a while to think it over  
In the end he only sees the change  
Light to dark  
Dark to light  
Light to dark  
Dark to light  
  
Heaven must be more than this  
When angels waken with a kiss  
Sacred hearts wont take the pain  
But mine will never be the same  
He stands before the window  
His shadow slowly fading from the wall  
And from an ivory tower he hears her call  
Let the light surround you  
  
Once I was but I was found  
When I heard the stained glass  
Shatter all around me  
She whispers words to clear my mind  
I once could see but now at last  
Im blind  
  
I know its easier  
To walk away  
Than look it in the eye  
But I have given all that I could take  
And now Ive only habits left to break  
Tonight Ill still be lying here surrounded  
In all the light
