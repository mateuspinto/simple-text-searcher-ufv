Kiss The Future LyricsForgiveness and mercy in short supply so lonely so  
Faithful no reason why in my mind at this time just clear  
Blue sky your story just starting now learn to fly  
It takes a miracle to make you see my consciousness  
Exploded  
Your past life dont suit you take my hand kiss the future  
Let fortune uproot you take my hand kiss the future  
No time now for sorrow meet life fullblast lets take on  
Tomorrow forget the past  
It takes a miracle to make you see my consciousness  
Exploded  
Your past life dont suit you take my hand kiss the future  
Let fortune uproot you take my hand kiss the future  
It takes a miracle to make you see my consciousness  
Exploded  
Your past life dont suit you take my hand kiss the future  
Let fortune uproot you take my hand kiss the future  
This is what you came here for stop the engine slam the  
Door leave that lonesome corridor  
Take the plunge and wipe the slate smile your smile   
youre feeling great soon youre going to celebrate  
Time has gone to hesitate nothing now can make you  
Wait take control of your own fate  
Take tomorrow in your hand make the others understand  
One break you must demand  
Your past life dont suit you take my hand kiss the future  
Let fortune uproot you take my hand kiss the future
