Controlling their lives  
Deciding when and how they will die  
A victim of someone elses choice  
The ones who suffer have no voice  
Manipulating destiny  
When it comes to living no one seems to care  
But when it comes to wanting out  
Those with power will be there  
Prolong the pain  
How long will it last  
Suicide machine  
A request to die with dignity  
Is that too much to ask  
Suicide machine  
How easy it is to deny the pain  
Of someone elses suffering  
  
Robbed of natural abilities  
In death they now seek tranquility  
In a confused state of mind  
Extending agony they must be blind  
Manipulating destiny  
  
When it comes to living no one seems to care  
But when it comes to wanting out  
Those with power will be there  
Prolong the pain  
How long will it last  
Suicide machine  
A request to die with dignity  
Is that too much to ask  
Suicide machine
