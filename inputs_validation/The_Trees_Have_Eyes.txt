Id been riding hard most of the night wooded ravines on a mountain side  
My horse was getting tired and so was I  
Up there the moon was full down here darkness ruled  
The trees were so much higher than they were meant to  
  
In what is known as The Devils Hide  
I knew I was not alone and it was not that crazy moon above  
Oh no I could feel the trees have eyes  
I used to know this road so well many a time i was here before  
  
But now it seemed so different the road was no more  
I was lost I stopped and looked around  
I had this eerie feeling that I was being watched  
In what is known as The Devils Hide  
  
I knew I was not alone and it wasnt not that crazy moon above  
Oh no I could feel the trees have eyes  
Watching me  
The trees have eyes watching me  
  
Then the sound I didnt want to hear howling at the moon  
Eyes I didnt want to see I should have turned around  
So much louder the howling was chilling my bones  
One wolf grown to a dozen and here I was alone  
  
Yellow eyes they were everywhere yellow eyes as I prepared to die  
Suddenly there she was in a halo of light  
Suddenly there she was silvery black and white  
The bluest magical eyes staring right into mine  
  
Never ever had I seen in a wolf such a beautiful beast  
In what is known as The Devils Hide  
I knew I was not alone and it was not that crazy moon above  
Oh no I could feel the trees have eyes
