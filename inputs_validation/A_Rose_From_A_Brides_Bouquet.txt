A ROSE FROM A BRIDES BOUQUET  
WRITERS CLARK VAN NESS JIMMY DICKENS  
It was only a rose from the brides bouquet I went to a wedding one bright
summer day The bride was a beauty and the people were gay Alone in a corner I
stood till the end For the girl was my sweetheart and the boy my best friend
When the service was over there beside the church door I picked up a rose that
fell on the floor Alone and neglected as I was that day Was my sweet little
rose from the brides bouquet It was only a rose from the brides bouquet
Once filled with loves perfume now faded and grey Like the love that she gave
me it faded away This sweet little rose from the brides bouquet Each petal
reminds me of a moment of bliss A sweet little love word and a lingering kiss
I waited in teardrops then hide it away My sweet little rose from the brides
bouquet
