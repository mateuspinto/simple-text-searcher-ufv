We can take a bit of a breather  
We can skip to the practical part  
We can skip to the Time of Neither  
When were together and even  
When were apart  
Ill tell you a story about the Lake Fever or  
We can skip to the coital fury  
You didnt say yes or no neither  
You whispered hurry  
  
We can take it a little bit further  
We can stick to the aftereffects part  
Not trying to make you a believer  
Dont want to a lil piece of your heart  
Just telling you a story about the Lake fever  
Or we can skip to a neutral fury  
You didnt say yes or no neither  
You whispered hurry  
Want to be a nobody without peer  
Want to be a thought thats never done  
Want to shake your faith in human nature  
Want to break the hearts of everyone  
Want to be your wheezing screen door  
Want to be your stars of Algonquin  
Want to be your roaring floorboard  
Want to break the hearts of everyone  
And cause discontent until They  
Ceasing their investigation  
Bring back the days events  
Good citizens and time well spent  
Til were talking in whispers again  
Until were talking in whispers again
