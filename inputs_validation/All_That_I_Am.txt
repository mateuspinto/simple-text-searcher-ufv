All that I am or ever hope to be  
Lies in your hands  
You are my destiny  
When you are in my arms I rule the world  
And when were far apart how cruel the world  
  
All that I want is to be near to you  
To spend my life making it clear to you  
You are my heart my soul my dream come true  
All that I am I am because of you  
  
All that I want is to be near to you  
To spend my life making it clear to you  
You are my heart my soul my dream come true  
All that I am I am because of you  
  
Because of you  
Because of you
