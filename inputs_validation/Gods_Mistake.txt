Have a friend calls me up  
Says hello then hangs up  
He must have read my mind  
These are the days of a different paradigm  
Maybe once even twice  
He said God does not play dice  
Yet if hes everywhere  
Hes in casinos with aces to spare  
  
Oh Love is Gods mistake  
Oh Love is Gods mistake  
  
Ours is not to reason why  
As we fall from way up high  
Into the water  
Like a lamb to the slaughter  
Even now Gods mistake  
Sets us up for one more heartbreak  
God you look mighty fine  
Dressed as the devil in a cosmic pantomime  
  
Oh Love is Gods mistake  
Oh Love is Gods mistake  
Never was so much at stake  
Oh Love is Gods mistake
