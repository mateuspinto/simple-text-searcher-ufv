Talk  
Talk is cheap puts me into sleep  
If theres too much talk  
Talk is cheap  
  
Speed 1 2 3 will bring it back right to its knees  
  
Onto its knees  
  
And I run away from this  
  
Youre running out  
You run away from me  
  
And I  
I never wanted much  
I wanted trust oh oh  
  
And I cant  
  
And I I never asked for more  
  
I wanted to believe it  oh  
  
And I cant and I cant  
  
Speed  
When I see you I see your soul  
I dig you a hole  
When I see you  
  
You breathe  
Bring it back well see you knock right to its knees  oh  
Onto its knees  
  
Oh I run away from this  
  
You run it down  
You run away from me  
  
And I  
I never wanted much  
I only wanted trust oh oh  
And I  
And I  
I never asked for more  
I wanted to believe in oh  
And I and I  
Oh  
  
Well there must be something more to say  
And I feel you slip away  
But I forget your hands are vacant inside  
I see you once again  
But its 1 2 3 youll follow me  
I know youll have to wait  
But I see yourself  
I see you break  
I see you laughing every single day  
And its true  
  
Well its happening to me  
I never wanted much  
I only wanted trust oh oh  
And I  
And I  
I never asked for more  
I wanted to believe you  
And I  
But I cant  
And I and I  
Cant
