Verse 1  
Will you live like me in a world run by desire  
Will you wake from worldly dream and not be tired  
Will you work like me to lift the conversation higher  
Will you be cool like water putting out the fire  
How can you be free from all this sorrow  
Will the ones you love today be gone tomorrow  
  
Chorus 1  
And if angels dont have answers to your prayers  
Oh I will be there oh I will be there  
  
Verse 2  
And if who you love dont want your love well then  
Do you cut a deal with love and run again  
You see love contains the meaning of despair  
Will you think like me Will you have your mothers fire  
Maybe the way we are will not be how youre wired  
Will we do right by you Will we you have what you require  
To make your days on this Earth be not so dire  
  
Chorus 2  
Can you choose to lead if no one follows  
And if we fell today must you tomorrow  
Sanctify your answer not your prayer  
Oh I will be there yeah I will be there  
Yeah I will be there  
  
Outro  
And even when it all becomes too much  
When youre growing old and feeling out of touch  
Listen to this song and just take care  
And know that I will be there yeah I will be there  
No I swear that I will yeah I promise I will  
Little girl Im cryin
