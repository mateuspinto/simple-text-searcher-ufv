I got a better love got a whole new prose  
Got a whole new goal  
And I gonna find love Im gonna fall in love  
And it makes me cold  
And I gotta move my heels gotta move outta here  
Gotta change my lane  
And I I commend you now yes I told you soon  
So that youd know now  
  
That at times everything comes at the right time  
And at times everything comes at the right time  
  
I never understand never understand  
With this pain in my hand  
And I cut my home yes I cut my home  
When I need to go  
And I know your face know it aches  
And I know its sad  
Oh I quit that scene cos I could not see  
Just where to be  
  
Cos at times everything comes at the right time  
And at times everything comes at the right time  
  
Yes I got a better love got a big part of love  
And it makes me whole  
Oh I yes I play with love yes I play with love  
And its playing with me  
  
But at times everything comes at the right time  
And at times everything comes at the right time  
And at times everything comes at the right time  
  
Come on over to my side now  
Come on over to my side now  
Come on over to my side now
