There are ladies in my life  
Lovely ladies in these lazy days  
And though I never took a wife  
May I say that I have loved me one or two  
Of the people in my past fading faces  
In a waking dream  
And though they never seemed to last very long  
There are faces I remember from  
The places in my past  
  
I said all the dead head miles  
And the insincere smiles  
Sometimes I can laugh and cry  
And I cant remember why  
But I still love those good times gone by  
Hold on to them close or let them go oh no  
I dont know I just seem to sing these songs  
And say Im sorry for the friends I used to know
