She had on these high heels  
And her hair was like a black sea  
She disappeared before we had a chance to meet  
  
Oh yeah I see her somewhere in London  
Girl please come back to me  
Oh yeah I see her somewhere in London  
And somehow I know that shes all that I need  
  
London London  
London London  
London London  
London London  
  
Her beauty stars so bright  
You took me and sucked the breath from me  
Just for a second she was my sunlight  
Then she fell into the crowd like the band of clouds  
Her darkness fell on me  
  
Oh yeah I see her somewhere in London  
Girl please come back to me  
Oh yeah I see her somewhere in London  
And somehow I know that shes all that I need  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
