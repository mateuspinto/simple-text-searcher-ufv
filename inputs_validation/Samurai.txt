When you came into  
My room last night  
And took off all your clothes  
Did you think I would resist  
Letting you inside  
Did you think I could resist you  
My favorite Samurai  
  
You swam across the bedroom  
Drunk on my champagne  
You got into the air  
Across the River Wye  
And pushed aside your headstone  
My favorite Samurai  
  
Then you showed me something  
I didnt know  
How to let go  
I was falling  
Through the Tivoli sky  
Expecting to fly  
Expecting to fly  
  
When I stood beside your tomb  
Last night  
Recalling how you rose  
Did you think I would persist  
Refusing to die  
See how Ive persisted  
My favorite Samurai
