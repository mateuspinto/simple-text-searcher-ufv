Heaven please send to all mankind  
Understanding and peace of mind  
And it its not asking too much  
Please send me someone to love  
To show the world  
How to get along  
Peace will enter  
When hate is gone  
And if its not asking too much  
Please send me someone to love  
Refrain  
I lay awake nights  
And ponder a world of troubles  
And the answers always  
The same that unless man  
Put an end to all of this  
Hate will put the world in flame  
Oh what a shame  
Just because Im in misery  
I dont beg for no sympathy  
But if its not asking too much  
Please send me someone to love  
Repeat Refrain going higher notes except last line  
Please send me  
Send me someone to love  
Send me someone  
Someone ooh ooh  
Just send me someone to love
