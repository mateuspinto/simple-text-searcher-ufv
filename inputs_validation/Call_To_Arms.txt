When they see us they will run for their lives  
To the end they will pay for their lies  
So long did we wait now we are home  
  
Here once again there is a battle to fight  
Gathered together for the sound and the might  
So long did we wait now we are home  
  
Now we will fight for the kingdom fighting with steel  
Kill all of them their blood is our seal  
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead  
Ride through the blood that we gladly have shed  
  
I now issue the call are you ready to fight  
Fight all together as one for the right to be free once again  
Tonight we will win  
  
I can see by the look that you have in your eyes  
You came here for metal to fight and to die  
Defenders of steel now we are home  
  
Chorus  
Fight for the kingdom bound for glory  
Armed with a heart of steel  
I swear by the Brothers who stand before me  
To no man shall I kneel  
Their blood is upon my steel  
Blood is upon my steel  
  
Fight for the kingdom fighting with steel  
Kill all of them their blood is our seal  
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead  
Ride through the blood that we gladly have shed  
  
I now issue the call are you ready to fight  
Fight all together as one for the right to be free once again  
Tonight we will win  
  
I can see by the look that you have in your eyes  
You came here for metal to fight and to die  
Defenders of steel now we are home  
  
Chorus x2  
Fight for the kingdom bound for glory  
Armed with a heart of steel  
I swear by the Brothers who stand before me  
To no man shall I kneel  
Their blood is upon my steel
