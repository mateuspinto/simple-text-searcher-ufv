Take my arm take my head  
Make your mark like a man  
Write your name gonna write your name  
Hurts so good loving thing  
When all fades you remain  
Write your name gonna write your name  
  
Write your name across my heart  
Write your name over every part  
And we could be worlds apart  
Write your name across my heart  
Write your name  
  
Gonna write your name  
Write your name  
Gonna write your name  
  
Harmony leave your scar  
When youre gone youre never far  
Write your name gonna write your name  
Company oh you are over me you take me on  
Write your name gonna write your name  
  
Write your name across my heart  
Write your name over every part  
And we could be worlds apart  
Write your name across my heart  
  
Its your name across my heart written in gold  
A permanent mark love engraved  
Its what we are more than words this love is art  
Poetry emotion put it right there  
Deeper than skin crystal clear  
Let us dont fade titanium made  
Further here forever safe  
  
Write your name across my heart  
Write your name across my heart  
Write your name over every part  
And we could be worlds apart  
Write your name across my heart  
Write your name  
Gonna write your name  
Write your name  
Gonna write your name
