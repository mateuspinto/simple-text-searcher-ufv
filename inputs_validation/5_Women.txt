It took five women to getcha off of my mind  
It took five months a plenty good wasted time  
But it just took five minutes when I saw your face again  
To fall in love all over I guess with you Ill never win  
  
March was a cold one in more ways than one  
Went down to the nightclub lookin for the sun  
Lookin for a light that could brighten up a day  
Thats been darker than a hole since you went away  
  
April usually brings showers  
This time it was a hurtin kind  
This woman said she wanted my baby  
I told her Id have to be deaf dumb and blind  
To fall in love with someone that I barely knew  
The baby would never really have a father  
Cause I still cause I still cause I still still still huh  
Be stuck on you  
  
It took five women to getcha off of my mind  
Get off my mind baby  
Fallin in love all overyou Ill never win  
  
May was her name she was jumpin  
Jumpin from plane to plane  
Actress or model or somethin  
Cant even remember her first name  
  
June brought an Easter bunny  
Needless to say hmph that girl was late  
Told a madeup story to a busybody of our only date  
What a sketch  
  
July was a heartbreak extraordinary  
Said I met this woman whose kiss was somethin scary  
It felt so much so much like yours  
But it only made me made me want you more  
Shes gone shes gone but youre still here  
I want you veryhuh its you I fear  
  
But it took five women to get you off my mind  
It took five months five months a plenty good wasted time  
But it just took five minutes and I saw your face again  
I fell in love all over with you I guess Ill never win  
Ill never win
