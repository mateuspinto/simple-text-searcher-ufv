Fallen Not Forgotten  
Words by Ray Boltz Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
He stood beside his daddy  
And watched the solders marching by  
It was Veterans Day and he wondered  
Why there were tears in daddys eyes  
Later they laid flowers  
Beside a monument of stone  
He said My daddy went to fight  
And didnt make it home  
Chorus  
Fallen not forgotten  
He was a hero  
He stood so tall  
And forever we will remember  
With honor and glory  
He gave his all  
They left behind their families  
And the towns where they were born  
For the rice paddies of Vietnam  
And the sands of Desert Storm  
They were soldiers in Korea  
And World War One  
And World War Two  
They paid the price  
Some gave their lives  
And they fought for me and you  
Fallen not forgotten  
They were the heroes  
Who stood so tall  
And forever we will remember  
With honor and glory  
They gave their all  
Now freedom is a blessing  
But freedom has a price  
And we must remember those  
Who paid it with their lives  
Remember the  
Fallen not forgotten  
They were the heroes  
Who stood so tall  
And forever we will remember  
With honor and glory  
They gave their all  
Fallen not forgotten  
They were the heroes  
Who stood so tall  
And forever we will remember  
With honor and glory  
With honor and glory  
With honor and glory  
They gave their all
