When I first saw your gallery  
I liked the ones of ladies  
Then you began to hang up me  
You studied to portray me  
In ice and greens  
And old blue jeans  
And naked in the roses  
Then you got into funny scenes  
That all your work discloses  
  
Lady dont love me now I am dead  
I am a saint turn down your bed  
I have no heart thats what you said  
You said I can be cruel  
But let me be gentle with you  
  
Somewhere in a magazine  
I found a page about you  
I see that now its Josephine  
Who cannot be without you  
I keep your house in fit repair  
I dust the portraits daily  
Your mail comes here from everywhere  
The writing looks like ladies  
  
Lady please love me now I am dead  
I am a saint turn down your bed  
I have no heart thats what you said  
You said I can be cruel  
But let me be gentle with you  
  
I gave you all my pretty years  
Then we began to weather  
And I was left to winter here  
While you went west for pleasure  
And now youre flying bock this way  
Like some lost homing pigeon  
Theyve monitored your brain you say  
And changed you with religion  
  
Lady please love me now I was dead  
I am no saint turn down your bed  
Lady have you no heart thats what you said  
Well I can be cruel  
But let me be gentle with you  
  
When I first saw your gallery  
I liked the ones of ladies  
But now their faces follow me  
And all their eyes look shady
