There she goes my daytime girl  
Spreading her wings like a high flying eagle  
All the people will stare as she falls to the ground  
  
Heaven knows my daytime girl  
Never been kissed she dont know what shes missing  
All the kisses there are to be found  
All the wisdom of people she used  
She took advantage of this  
Taking time to remember the past  
Remembering all she has missed  
  
What a dream this place has been  
Said when she left I believed when I saw him  
All the seeing believing come true  
All the wisdom of people she used  
She took advantage of this  
Taking time to remember the past  
Remembering all she has missed  
  
There she goes my daytime girl  
Spreading her wings like a high flying eagle  
All the people will stare as she falls to the ground  
Me how to get over you
