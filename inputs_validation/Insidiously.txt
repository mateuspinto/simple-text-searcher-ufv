Mind you mind me  
You thought you could climb me  
Im sorry to cut your rope  
Bu in you Ive lost all hope  
Mind you mind me  
I havent seen you lately  
Oh how many times you liked to phone  
To see if your seed I could sow  
  
I tell you if thats what youre about  
Friends like you I can do without  
  
Mind you mind me  
I laugh at your transparency  
Youre my new best friend  
Your fucked up life can I mend  
Mind you mind me  
I find it interesting to see  
When I only offer you a smile oh how  
You forget to dial  
  
Believe me I know you work  
Insidiously  
  
Mind you mind me you smile so sweetly  
Id call you an acquaintance stop with  
Your exaggeration  
Mind you mind me  
How things can change is a good week  
Call me ruthless  
But you stretch the truth oh yes  
  
I tell you if thats what youre about  
Friends like you I can do without
