Took a trip on a Gemini spacecraft  
And I thought about you  
I passed through the shadow of Jupiter  
And I thought about you  
  
I shot my space gun  
And boy I really felt blue  
  
Two or three flying saucers  
Parked under the stars winding stream  
Moon shining down on some little town  
And with each beam the same old dream  
  
I took a trip on a Gemini spacecraft  
And I thought about you  
Well I shot my spacegun  
And I thought about you  
  
Pulled down my sun visor  
Boy I really felt blue  
  
You jumped into your Gemini I jumped into mine  
Well orbit the Moon for just one time  
Tomorrow night tomorrow night  
Will you hold hands with me under the moonlight  
  
Took a trip in a Gemini spacecraft  
And I thought about you  
I shot my space gun  
And I thought about you  
  
And I took a I took a walk in space  
Boy I really felt blue  
  
Well I peeked through the crack and looked way back  
Stardust trail leading back to you  
What did I do What could I do What did I do  
Well  
  
I thought about you  
I thought about you  
Took a trip on a Gemini spacecraft  
And thought about you
