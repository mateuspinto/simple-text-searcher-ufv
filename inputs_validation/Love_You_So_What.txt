You up and leave me cold turkey  
When you know I could not tie my own shoe  
This does not please me no not exactly  
Guess you do not give a damn for my love  
Everybody knows that shes worse than religion  
No you do not cross a woman in love  
Everybody knows that the turn of the season  
Paris in the spring doesnt mean a damn thing to my baby  
No no no no  
You beat me up you put me down  
Youre slamming my name all over town  
Guess Im big enough to roll with the punches  
But you bruise me you abuse me damn good  
Everybody knows that shes worse than religion  
No you do not cross a woman in love  
Everybody knows that the turn of the season  
Paris in the spring doesnt do a damn thing  
I love you so so much  
You love me so so what  
I love you so so much  
You love me so so what  
La la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la la la
