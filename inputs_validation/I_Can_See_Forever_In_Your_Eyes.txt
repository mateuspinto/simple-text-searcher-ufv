Touch me and I feel your fire  
Kiss me and the flame rolls higher  
Show me all the love you know  
Hold me never let me go  
  
I never thought Id be  
Wrapped in the words  
Of your sweet sweet love  
But here you are with me  
This is what dreams are made of  
  
Chorus  
I can see forever in your eyes  
I can see a love that never dies  
When you lay me down I realize  
I can see forever in your eyes  
  
Take me in your arms tonight  
Love me with all your might  
Give me all my heart can hold  
Hold me never let me go  
  
Love was mystery  
Until you touched me with sweet sweet love  
Now its so clear to me  
This is what love is made of  
  
Chorus x2
