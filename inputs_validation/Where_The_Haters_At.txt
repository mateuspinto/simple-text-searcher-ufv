Chorus Young Buck  
They was glad I was broke mad cause Im rich  
So put that nigga out if its a hater in this bitch uhoh  
Stuntin in the club make em start a riot  
Throw my hood up then go take it outside  
Repeat  
Verse 1 Young Buck  
Why you hate me nigga Yo baby momma love me  
She see me in the club and runs up and hug me  
I show her no love she keep on comin back  
Tellin me she got yo club and where yo money at  
It must be my Lac thats sittin on Pirellis  
The way I count stacks thats got these niggas jealous  
See Im hard on a hoe I get down for mine  
You need a handout bitch dont waste ya time  
If you dont work you dont work you dont eat you dont eat  
We go to jail go to church go to sleep  
Im ridin round wit Scrappy in the A wit my heat  
Tryna figure out how to get to Peachtree  
Come on nigga  
Verse 2 Lil Murder  
Young nigga but a certified playa  
But youse a bitch nigga youse a bonafide hater  
They was glad I was broke but now Im livin major  
Hustlin and servin niggas like a waiter for the paper  
We ridin down the strip in sumthin so wet  
When ya bitch see a nigga wanna suck a nigga dick  
Smokin dro and drinkin liquor till a nigga get sick  
Every city every state its the same ol shit  
Nigga money make the world go round so get ya hustle on  
These niggas snitchin so much Im like fuck a phone  
Mad cause Im on they love to see me down  
I know you gon let me shine and get mine  
Nigga

Verse 3 AllStar  
Look hatin aint healthy nigga so keep it movin  
These shots will wake ya whole hood up Im sleepin through it  
Chea Im used to it I done made a gun fire  
Pull the trigger one time sound like a gun fight  
You was glad I was broke now ya mad cause ya hoe  
Love it when a nigga put it in the back of her throat  
Buck Hisee Murder and Star we aint never scared  
I dont need my pistol in the club Ill brawl there  
I know hustlers that do deal white  
Jump stupid find out what these boots feel like  
Yea yall know me AllStar Im so street yea  
What it is what it aint what it gon be  
Verse 4 HiC  
I dont bust my gun like a halftime football game  
I aimed straight and I took yall name  
And ya whole click look all lame  
You can catch me in the house with a pyrex and it cook all caine  
Put that metal in ya mouth you gon swear I was doctor walls  
Im in the club with my muthafuckin glock in drawers  
I had to let my nuts hang so I dropped my balls  
You aint hit him wit no bullets nigga shot the walls  
You shoot to scare I aim and kill  
When I dump on you they gon think yo brain aint real  
Im heavyweight in the game you featherweight  
When they hear a nigga take a loss they wanna celebrate  
Bitch
