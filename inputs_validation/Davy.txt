Davy is there a song out there in the night  
For us  
Davy is there the kind of smile that you  
Read about  
There are ghosts who would warn me  
Keep me alone  
Davy are you the heat I feel in my  
Foolish heart  
Davy theres not a day that I havent prayed  
To feel something so worthy  
For someone like you  
  
Davy could there be love so bright  
Like to jump off the sea  
Davy did I imagine it or did you look at me  
With a look so bold that I had to look away  
  
But if it feels alright  
If it feels alright and it feels alright  
Davy Davy Davy
