They say that these are not the best of times  
But theyre the only times Ive ever known  
And I believe there is a time for meditation  
In cathedrals of our own  
  
Now I have seen that sad surrender in my lovers eyes  
But I can only stand apart and sympathize  
For we are always what our situations hand us  
Its either sadness or euphoria  
  
So well argue and well compromise  
And realize that nothings ever changed  
For all our mutual experience  
Our separate conclusions are the same  
  
Now we are forced to recognize our inhumanity  
Our reason coexists with our insanity  
Though we choose between reality and madness  
Its either sadness or euphoria  
  
How thoughtlessly we dissipate our energies  
Perhaps well help fulfill each others fantasies  
And as we stand upon the ledges of our lives with our respective similarities  
Its either sadness or euphoria
