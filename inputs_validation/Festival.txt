Havin a nationwide festival for fourteen days and nights  
Ah theres fifty four bands on a river boat spot in the lights  
Hundred of bands and tents all on the banks of the Ohio  
Bandstands floatin from Paducah to Cairo  
Be over a million freaks there diggin the sights  
  
Theres so many beautiful people there to love and cheer  
Some of the greatest guitar playin in the western hemisphere  
Got the Who the Band from across the north border Canned Heat  
The Fifth Dimension Creedence Clearwater  
Oh brother Hendrix sister Joplin we wish you were here  
  
Early in the mornin Johnny Cash and old Elvis got loose  
The Who Vanilla Fudge and the Woolies start paying their dues  
All evening Ike Turner and Aretha right on the Drifters  
And the Coasters and the Loading Zone  
All night Howlin Wolf and Muddy Waters in a battlin mood  
  
Oh what a beautiful show was sitting right up under the microphone  
Diggin the Grateful Dead Little Richard and the Rolling Stones  
Ray Charles Led Zeppelin and the Everly Brothers  
Bad Bo Diddley and the Beatles and some others  
Everybodys laying back and freaking out all week long
