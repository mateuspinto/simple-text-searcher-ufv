The sun is fading away  
Thats the end of the day  
As the June light turns to moonlight  
Ill be on my way  
  
Just one kiss and Ill go  
Dont hide the tears that dont show  
As the June light turns to moonlight  
Ill be on my way  
  
To where the winds dont blow  
And golden rivers flow  
This way will I go  
  
They were right I was wrong  
True love didnt last long  
As the June light turns to moonlight  
Ill be on my way hey  
To where the winds dont blow  
And golden rivers flow  
This way will I go  
  
They were right I was wrong  
True love didnt last long  
As the June light turns to moonlight  
Ill be on my way hey  
  
Ill be on my way oh oh  
Ill be on my way oh oh  
Ill be on my way
