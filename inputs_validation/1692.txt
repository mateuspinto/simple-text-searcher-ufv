Mist upon the hill can remember murder  
Mist upon the hill that once flowed with blood  
Helped to cover up an approaching army  
Hid the killing lust in the eyes of men  
  
Sitting by the fire was a sentry sleeping  
Rolled up in their beds were children that play  
Unsuspecting what was to fall upon them  
None of them would see the dawn next day  
  
Bloody were the blades that fell on children  
Hate the blinding light tried to kill a name  
The mountains only know all the souls that died there  
Glen coe from that day can recall the shame  
  
The quiet of the night never gave them warning  
The silence of the hills wouldnt let them know  
Theyd never rise again on a mist filled morning  
Never see the sunrise above glen coe
