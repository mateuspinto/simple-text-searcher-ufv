You reach for pain  
You reach for fear  
You reach for everything  
But nothing ever comes your way  
  
And Im not lying  
You always complain about the way I behave without you  
  
And last night I had a dream  
About it  
And its very hard to stay faithful  
To a dream of you  
  
CHORUS  
Think about the lies  
That we told to each other  
We never bothered  
What a big surprise  
That your scared of yourself  
And alone all again  
  
You reach for me  
You reach for us  
You reach for everything  
But nothing ever comes my way  
  
But you  
You are nothing but a state of mind  
From the start until the end  
  
CHORUS x 2
