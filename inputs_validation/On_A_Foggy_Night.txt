On a foggy night an abandoned road  
In a twilight mirror mirage  
With no indication of a service station  
Or an all night garage I was misinformed  
I was misdirected cause the interchange  
Never intersected leaving me marooned  
Beneath a bloodshot moon  
All upon a foggy night on a foggy night  
An abandoned road in a blurred brocade  
Collage is that a road motel  
I cant really tell is that what you  
Might call some kind of a vacancy lodge  
Cause theres no consolation what  
Kind of situation to be aimlessly skewed  
Amidst a powder blue  
No tell tail light clue  
Spun like the spell you spin  
This precarious pandemonium  
Im stranded all upon a foggy night  
All upon a foggy night  
On a foggy night
