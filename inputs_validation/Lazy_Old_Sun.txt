Lazy old sun  
What have you done to summertime  
Hiding away  
Behind all those misty thunder clouds  
I dont mind  
To spend my time  
Looking for you  
For you are my one reality  
When Im dead and gone  
Your light will shine eternally  
Sunny rain shine my way  
Kiss me with one ray of light from your lazy old sun  
You make the rainbows and you make the night disappear  
You melt the frost so I wont criticize my sun  
When I was young  
My world was three foot seven inch tall  
When you were young  
There was no world at all  
Sunny rain shine my way  
Kiss me with one ray of light from your lazy old sun  
Lazy old sun  
Lazy old sun  
Lazy old sun
