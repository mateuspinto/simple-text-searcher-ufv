From bitter searching of the heart  
Quickened with passion and with pain  
We rise to play a greater part  
This is the faith from which we start  
Men shall know commonwealth again  
From bitter searching of the heart  
We loved the easy and the smart  
But now with keener hand and brain  
We rise to play a greater part  
The lesser loyalties depart  
And neither race nor creed remain  
From bitter searching of the heart  
Not steering by the venal chart  
That tricked the mass for private gain  
We rise to play a greater part  
Reshaping narrow law and art  
Whose symbols are the millions slain  
From bitter searching of the heart  
We rise to play a greater part
