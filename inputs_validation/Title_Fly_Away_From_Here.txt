You gotta find a way  
Yeah I cant wait another day  
Aint nothin gonna change  
If we stay around here  
I gotta do what it takes  
Because its all in our hands  
We all make mistakes  
Yeah but its never to late to start again yeah yeah  
Take another breath  
And say another prayer  
  
Then fly away from here  
To anywhere  
Yeah I dont care  
If we just fly away from here  
Our hopes and dreams  
Are out there somewhere  
Wont let time pass us by  
Well just fly  
  
If this life  
Gets any harder now  
It aint no nevermind  
Ya got me by your side  
And anytime you want fly fly fly  
Yeah we catch a train  
And find a better place  
Yeah cause we wont let nothin  
Or no one keep gettin us down  
Maybe you and I  
Could pack our bags and hit the sky  
  
Then fly away from  
To anywhere  
Yeah I dont care  
If we just fly away from here  
And our hopes and dreams  
Are out there somewhere  
I wont let time pass us by  
Well just fly  
  
Do you see a bluer sky now  
You could have a better ride now  
Open your eyes  
  
Because no one here can ever stop us  
They can try but we wont let them  
No wayayayayyeahah  
  
Maybe you and I  
Could pack our bags and say goodbye  
  
Then fly away from here  
To anywhere

And our hopes and dreams  
Are out there somewhere  
Fly away from here ya ya ya
