Got a song about a soldier  
Ridin somewhere on a train  
Empty sleeve pinned to his shoulder  
And some pills to ease the pain  
Started drinkin in El Paso  
He was drunk in San Antone  
Tellin strangers who were sleepin  
How he hated goin home  
  
Just a simple song of freedom  
He was never fightin for  
No ones listenin when you need em  
Aint no fun to sing that song no more  
  
Got a song about a sister  
Waitin somewhere by the phone  
For some man who never missed her  
Ever since he come and gone  
  
And its harder for a woman  
With a baby on the way  
Thats the price of bein human  
When youre poor enough to pay  
  
So she listens to the freedom  
In the silence at her door  
No ones missin til you need em  
Aint no fun to sing that song no more  
  
Got a song about a Savior  
Lookin lonesome and afraid  
At a city full of strangers  
And a cross He never made  
  
And Hes sadder than Hes wiser  
And a longer way from home  
And He wonders why His Father  
Left Him bleeding and alone  
  
Just a broken song of freedom  
And the closing of a door  
No ones missin til you need em  
Aint no fun to sing that song no more
