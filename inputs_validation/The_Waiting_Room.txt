He panics feels around for a stone and hurls it at the brightest  
point The sound of breaking  
glass echoes around the cave As his vision is restored he catches  
sight of two golden gloves  
about one foot in diameter hovering away down the tunnel When they  
disappear a  
resounding crack sears across the roof and it collapses all around  
him Our hero is trapped  
once again  
This is it he thinks failing to move any of the fallen rocks
