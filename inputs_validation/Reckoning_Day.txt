I like the way that I make you itch  
And all the reasons I give you to bitch  
And how I make you wanna scream in pain  
And feel your life is just a losing game  
I like the way that you let me in  
The way you look when the walls cave it  
I like the way that your stomach knots  
And how you cry for it all to stop  
I like the way that you fool yourself  
And make believe theres nobody else  
I like the way that you stand in line  
And beg salvation from the empty skies  
Dont want no revenge  
Aint no pay back time  
It aint called getting even  
Here comes the Reckoning Day  
I like the things that you try to fake  
And your face when I see you break  
And that you say you will pray for me  
You realize you are prey for me  
I like the way you stay on attack  
No matter what I keep coming back  
And how you try to hold me down  
But you end up driven to the ground
