My heart sings praises each time I say Your name  
This love is deeper than simple words can say  
You go before me You make a perfect way  
My one desire is to give You perfect praise  
In my heart You are the power  
In my night never failing light  
With every breath that I take  
Ill declare the things Youve done  
In my mind mighty Overcomer  
In my soul the reason why  
In my life You are the fire that calls me on
