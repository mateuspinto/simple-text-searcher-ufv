Everybody came from miles around  
Uptown downtown way across town  
Yeah man we had a party  
Whew talk about a party  
We did a little singin  
A whole lotta swingin  
Man we had a party tonight  
Honky tonky Joe let us all know  
He came to have some fun  
And put us on a show  
Yeah man we had a party  
Whew yeah we had a party  
We did a little singin  
A whole lotta swingin  
Man we had a party tonight  
We put some records on the hifi machine  
The lights were down low  
It was really quite a scene  
Yeah man we had a party  
Whew talk about a party  
We did a little singin  
A whole lotta swingin  
Man we had a party tonight  
Everyone was happy  
No one was sad  
If you missed the blast  
Then its really too bad  
Cause we had a party  
When yeah we had a party  
We did a little singin  
A whole lotta swingin  
Man we had a party tonight
