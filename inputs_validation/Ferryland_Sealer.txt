Oh our schooner and our sloop in Ferryland they do lie  
They are already rigged to be bound for the ice  
All you lads of the Southern we will have you to beware  
She is going to the ice in the Spring of the year  
Chorus  
Laddie whack fall the laddie laddie whack fall the day  
Our course be eastnortheast for two days and two nights  
Our captain he cried out Boys look ahead for the ice  
He hove her about standing in for the land  
And twas in a few hours we were firm in the jam  
Oh our captain he cried out Come on boys and lend a hand  
Our cook he gets the breakfast and each man takes a dram  
With their hats in their hands it was earlye for to go  
Every man showed his action thout the missing of a blow  
Some were killing some were scalping some were hauling on board  
Some more they were firing and amissing of their loads  
In the dusk of the evening all h
