Choklit Factory  
There was strange was a man there I think he was the Tinker  
He was standing right behind me looking up at the factory  
Just before he left he said  
Nobody every goes in and nobody every comes out  
  
Wheres the choklit Wheres the choklit Wheres the choklit  
One boy entertained by  
The torments of another soul  
Touching was confusing  
And he found he was all alone  
  
He sought salvation  
In the darkness of the choklit  
Sweets soaked insecurities  
And sugar teased his need to kill  
Peel back the faces  
We hide within our choklit shell  
Some know indulgence  
Some know and some go much too far  
  
Wheres thewheres the choklit  
They came hypnotized by  
The promise in his somber grin  
He saw ssssomething  
In the weakness of their skin  
Peel back the faces  
We hide within our choklit shell  
Some know indulgence  
Some know and some go much too far  
Little suprises around every corner but nothing too dangerous  
  
Is it raining is it snowing  
Is a hurricane a blowing  
Not a speck of light is showing  
So the danger must be growing  
Are the fires of hell a glowing  
Is the grizzly reaper mowing  
Yes the danger must be growing  
For the rowers keep on rowing  
Not showing signs of slowing  
Any sign that they are slowing  
Faster faster faster faster  
Faster faster faster faster  
Faster faster faster faster  
Faster faster faster faster  
  
Jeff saved for later  
His prizes of iniquity  
Polaroids to covet  
And bones to hide in 213  
Peel back the faces  
We hide within our choklit shell  
Some know indulgence  
Some know and some go
