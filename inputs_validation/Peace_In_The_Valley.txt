Well Im tired and so weary  
But I must go along  
Till the Lord comes and calls me away  
Where the mornings so bright  
And the Lamb is the light  
And the night night is as fair as the day  
  
There will be peace in the valley  
For me some day  
There will be peace in the valley  
For me Oh Lord I pray  
Therell be no sadness  
No sorrow no trouble I see  
There will be peace  
In the valley for me  
  
Well the flowers will be blooming  
And the grass will be green  
And the skies will be clear and serene  
Where the sun ever beams  
In this valley of dreams  
And no cloud will be seen  
  
There will be peace in the valley  
For me some day  
There will be peace in the valley  
For me Oh Lord I pray  
Therell be no sadness  
No sorrow no trouble I see  
There will be peace  
In the valley for me  
  
Well the bear will be gentle  
And the wolf will be tame  
And the lion shall lay down  
By the lamb oh  
And the beasts from the wild  
Shall be led by a child  
And Ill be changed  
Changed from this creature that I am  
  
There will be peace in the valley  
For me some day  
There will be peace in the valley  
For me Oh Lord I pray  
Therell be no sadness  
No sorrow no trouble I see  
There will be peace  
In the valley for me
