Yesterday the sun was shining but youre finding  
The sun dont shine all the time  
A winter day suddenly came your way  
And you ran into your mind  
  
Sleeping Annaleah weeping Annaleah  
You think youre ready for me  
  
Oh and yesterday is gone forever and ever  
Never to be again  
You looked for the sunshine that brought  
Warmth to your mind but find only rain  
  
Sleeping Annaleah weeping Annaleah  
No youre not ready for me  
  
But when yesterday becomes a memory  
A memory that we uncovered in time  
If you still remember that cold December  
I reigned in your mind  
  
Sleeping Annaleah weeping Annaleah  
Then youd be ready for me  
  
Sleeping Annaleah weeping Annaleah  
Sleeping Annaleah
