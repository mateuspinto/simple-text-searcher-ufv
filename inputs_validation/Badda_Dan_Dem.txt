Me nuh care where yuh bad from  
Or the ends where yuh trad from  
Gun shot mek yuh fall like the bridge ova London  
When it kick yuh like vandam  
Dis me outa east and meh buck yuh up ah Boston  
Head ah buss like gaspan  
Bullet with gunpowder  
No lasco no lass man  
Dis Kartel and point hand  
Push yuh head in yuh mudda pussy like tampon  
Yeh big up buju banton  
When ah boy ah kick like Jackie Chan over Hong Kong  
Our gun go so pam pam  
We bad before xman and green lantern  
Before snoop live ah compton  
So boy nuh tru yuh hear Kartel do him gyal song meh nuh easy fi walk pan  
Teflon black blunt carbon  
  
Yow  
We ah badder than them by far  
Badder than them by near  
In ah peace in ah war  
Drive by walk by in car  
Gun war fare see the chief of staff here 3 star  
Badder than them by far badder than them by near  
  
Yo yo  
Yuh brain will get float in  
With the big millie fourteen  
My gun carry copper no calcium no protein  
So yuh dead when eh soak en  
When mi did ah run town with mi gun inna mi short jeans you deh ah country ah

So yuh wah war bad man now  
By all means when yuh ready bring it on please  
And bring yuh friend them small axe fall tall tress  
Ah them pussy yuh call Gs  
When gunshot ah blow them think ah Christmas breeze  
One ketch yuh yuh must freeze  
Marrow fly from Jamaica cross the west indies  
Land ah Belize next please  
When iron dog bite yuh it wussa than rabies and it sting like peer bees  
Mek big man cry like ladies and babies  
Timeless
