Away beyond the blue  
Away beyond the blue  
One star belongs to you  
One star belongs to you  
  
And every breath I take  
And every breath I take  
Im closer to that place  
Im closer to that place  
  
Yeah baby Im gonna meet you there  
On the outskirts of the sky  
Yeah baby Im gonna meet you there  
And we will fly  
  
Away beyond the blue  
Away beyond the blue  
One star belongs to you  
  
This life is but a dream  
This life is but a dream  
Go gently down the stream  
Go gently down the stream
