My heart flies on her wings  
Now Im crying the moon so red  
Tomorrow shall be yet another hell  
To the sun the skys soul is fed  
Blows pass me  
Im down them I do not feel  
Anything except the shadow is real  
Why did she do it   Why did she die   
How could she leave without saying goodbye   
She has proven my life to be just a lie  
When sea waves crush they hit me hard  
But I do not feel them  
And then reality is no more real to me  
I ask myself should I end it now  
And rejoin her at last   
I miss the cold embrace of lust  
Theres nothing left just dust  
Nothing is left from my dearest love
