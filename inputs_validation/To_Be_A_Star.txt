Im gonna get me a gun yeah yeah  
It was like a dream in the star machine  
Oh no izitso izitso  
I never wanted to be a star I never wanted  
To travel far  
I only wanted a little bit of love  
So I could put a little love in my heart  
I never wanted to be ladeda go to parties  
avec le bourgeois  
I only wanted to sing my song well  
So I could ring a small bell in your heart

Lights oh no

Night yeah yeah

Ferrari car  
I only wanted to run my own race  
So I could win a small place in your heart  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Nature found a way it picked me up off the  
Dark side yeah yeah

I never wanted to be a star I never wanted to travel far  
I only wanted a little bit of love  
So I could put a little love in my heart
