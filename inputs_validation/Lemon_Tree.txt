When I was just a lad of ten my father said to me  
Come here and take a lesson from the lovely lemon tree  
Dont put your faith in love my boy my father said to me  
Ill fear youll find that love is like the lovely lemon tree  
  
Ref 2x  
Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet  
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat  
  
Beneath the lemon tree one day my love and I did lie  
A girl so sweet that when she smiled the stars rose in the sky  
We past that summer lost in love beneath the lemon tree  
The music of her laughter hid my fathers words from me  
  
Ref 2x  
  
One day she left without a word she took away the sun  
And in the dark shed left behind I knew what she had done  
She left me for another its a common tale but true  
A sadder tale but wiser now I sing this song for you  
  
Ref 3x
