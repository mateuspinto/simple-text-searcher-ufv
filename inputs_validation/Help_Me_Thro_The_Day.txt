Help me through the day  
Help me through the night  
Baby your sweet loving  
Will make everything all right  
  
Help me through tomorrow  
When stormy weather comes  
Lord make me realize  
That youre my woman  
  
I can see so much pain  
Deep inside your eyes  
I know the feeling  
Someone hurts you  
When someone makes you cry  
  
Help me through the day  
Help me through the night  
Babe you make me realize  
Youre my woman  
  
Help me through the day  
Help me through the night  
Baby your sweet loving  
Will make everything all right  
  
Help me through tomorrow  
When stormy weather comes  
Lord make me realize  
Youre my woman  
Youre my woman  
  
Help me through the day  
And be my woman  
Help me through the night  
And be my woman
