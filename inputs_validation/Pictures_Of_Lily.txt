I used to wake up in the morning  
I used to feel so bad  
I got so sick of having sleepless nights  
I went and told my dad  
  
He said Son now heres some little something  
And stuck them on my wall  
And now my nights aint quite so lonely  
In fact I I dont feel bad at all  
  
Pictures of Lily made my life so wonderful  
Pictures of Lily helped me sleep at night  
Pictures of Lily solved my childhood problems  
Pictures of Lily helped me feel alright  
  
Pictures of Lily  
Lily oh Lily  
Lily oh Lily  
Pictures of Lily  
  
And then one day things werent quite so fine  
I fell in love with Lily  
I asked my dad where Lily I could find  
He said Son now dont be silly  
  
Shes been dead since 1929  
Oh how I cried that night  
If only Id been born in Lilys time  
It would have been alright  
  
Pictures of Lily made my life so wonderful  
Pictures of Lily helped me sleep at night  
  
For me and Lily are together in my dreams  
And I ask you Hey mister have you ever seen  
Pictures of Lily
