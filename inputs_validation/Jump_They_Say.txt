When comes the shaking man  
A nation in his eyes  
Striped with blood and emblazed tattoo  
Streaking cathedral spire  
  
They say  
He has no brain  
They say  
He has no mood  
They say  
He was born again  
They say  
Look at him climb  
They say jump  
  
They say  
He has two gods  
They say  
He has no fear  
They say  
He has no eyes  
They say  
He has no mouth  
  
They say hey thats really something  
They feel he should get some time  
I say he should watch his ass  
My friend dont listen to the crowd  
They say jump  
  
Got to believe somebody  
Got to believe
