May I have this dance  
Ive been waitin for this chance  
All night long all night long  
And this night Ill always treasure  
If I could have the pleasure  
To escort you  
  
Dont you know Ive bit my nails in to  
Wantin to dance with you  
But I was much too shy  
I never had the nerve  
Before youd dance across the floor with another guy  
The way he held you in his arms  
With his many charms  
I knew my chances were slim  
In order to get to you  
Theres only one thing to do  
So I got rid of him  
  
Hey  
Ooh hoo I told him that a girl  
By the name of pearl  
Was looking for him  
And when I turned around  
He was nowhere to be found  
  
So here I am  
Oh I gotta have this dance gotta have this dance with you  
Honey I gotta have this dance with you  
Honey I honey I honey I have this dance  
Honey I gotta have this dance with you  
Gotta have this dance  
Oh
