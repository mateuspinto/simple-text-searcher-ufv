Dress in Armour  
Bring your sword and shield  
And your lucky charm  
In dragonships  
Well sail the seven seas  
Under guilding stars  
  
Into battle we will ride  
Gods will follow by our side  
  
Bridge x1  
Heathens from the north  
  
The air is still  
The bodies cold and pale  
Theyll never live to tell  
About the slaughter  
When battlegrounds ran red  
We gave them hell  
  
Into battle sense of pride  
Were forever shining bright  
  
Bridge x4  
Heathens from the north  
  
We are immortal  
Ever shining bright  
Heathens from the north yeah
