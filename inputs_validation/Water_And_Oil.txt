Repeat x2  
Dem try fi hold hold wha dem cant conquer  
Rastaman no mix up with no vagavanga  
  
They want to condemn the innocent  
For crimes which we did not committ  
They want to get good people mix up  
In their bag of tricks  
  
Repeat x2  
But water and oil cant mix  
Water and oil dont mix  
  
Repeat x2  
Say dem try fi hold hold wha dem cant conquer  
Rastaman no mix up with no vagavanga  
  
Hear this naah go like the son if you no like the father  
True we manifest under the same order  
Cock your ears and listen me want you hear ya part ya  
But first come in papa Ziggy as the eldest brother  
Yes I hear the lies theyve told  
Dem says Rasta did this and this  
What is the politican role  
Is it to create conflicts  
  
Repeat x2  
But water and oil cant mix  
Water and oil dont mix  
  
Jah who I praise break your silence  
Now that the wicked is accusing  
Attacking for no reason  
All we did was pray for them  
Now the way things happen fast  
Some things me naah go member  
But the day did cool cool and collective lya  
Nest thing me know some unwanted visitors  
Some devil worshiping Rasta hating coldblooded murdera  
Never get get wha dem expect dem expect lamb fi slaughter  
  
Hear this This is Ragamuffin and him hitting harder  
We get up from weh we sit down to a strategic corner  
Me and the bwoy dem eye mek four me mek a nervous swallow  
Prip around from left to right me look pon all me brother  
Hold me head to the sky and make a final prayer  
Zoom zoom And everything take cover  
Look how fast lightning rod back out in all a dem face  
Quick Me back out me no member wha it name  
Them never know the youth them would not lose them faith  
Through the grace of the Father everything set straight  
Water and oil cant mix
