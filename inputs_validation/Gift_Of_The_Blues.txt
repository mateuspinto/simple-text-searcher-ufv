I hope you had a very very merry and that your seasons wishes came true  
But mine will of white the contrary for I received a gift of the blues  
I travel miles and miles to see my baby all this way just to share his charms  
Travel miles and miles to find my baby wrapped up so neatly in someone elses
arms  
I hope you had a cool and a franic we laugh at resolutions were few  
But there are those of us near panic were the ones who got a gift of the blues  
I travel miles and miles to find my baby all this way just to share his charms  
Travel miles and miles to find my baby wrapped up so neatly in someone elses
arms  
I hope you had a very very merry and that your seasons wishes came true  
But mine will of white the contrary for I received a gift of the blues
