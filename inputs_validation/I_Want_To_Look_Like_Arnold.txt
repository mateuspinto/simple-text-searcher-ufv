I spend my days watching tv with a beer  
oohahh youre fat  
This seems to have caused my upper belly to appear  
oohahh youre fat  
Then one day my woman went and left me  
she did not want to sleep with a whale  
She said she found someone more manly  
a body that could not fail  
So I went and I looked into the mirror  
you look like a big tub of goo  
And I dreamed of being big and manly  
dreaming is the best you can do  
I though to myself what would I ask for  
if someone gave you a wish  
I think Id like to look like my hero  
hes one big manly bisch  
I want to look like Arnold Schwartzenegger  
I dont want to be fat and weak oh no oh no  
I want to look like Arnold Schwartzenegger  
I want a manly physique  
I put down the cheetos and I went on a crash diet  
carrots were all you ate  
Then I noticed that my skin was turning orange  
youre just a big mistake  
Then I overdosed on diet pills  
too bad you did not die  
Still I want to look like my idol  
the great big beefy guy  
I want to look like Arnold Schwartzenegger  
I dont want to be fat and weak oh no oh no  
I want to look like Arnold Schwartzenegger  
I want a manly physique  
I bought myself a weight set and some steriods  
to make you big and strong  
And I worked out really really hard  
but it did not last for long  
I put out my back and the steroids made me sterile  
not like it mattered anyway  
And about looking like my hero  
he has one thing to say  
I dont want to look like Arnold Schwartzenegger  
I dont mind being fat and weak oh no oh no  
I dont want to look like Arnold Schwartzenegger  
Its easier being fat and lazy  
Youll never look like Arnold Schwartzenegger  
Youll always be fat and weak oh yes oh yes  
Youll never look like Arnold Schwartzenegger  
You are fat and ugly
