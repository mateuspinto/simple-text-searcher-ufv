Chorus  
Look at the average person  
Speak to the man in the street  
Can you imagine the first one youd meet  
  
Well Im talking to a former engine driver  
Trying to find out what he used to do  
Tells me that he always kept his engine  
Spit and polished up as good as new  
But he said his only great ambition  
Was to work with lions in a zoo  
Oh to work with lions in a zoo  
Yes dear you heard right  
Told me his ambition was to work with lions every night  
  
Chorus  
  
Well I met a woman working as a waitress  
I asked exactly what it was she did  
Said she worked the summer crowd at seasides  
Winter time she ran away and hid  
Once she had a Hollywood audition  
But the part was given to a kid  
Yesthe part was given to a kid  
Yes sir you heard it right  
Hollywood ambition made a starlet grown up overnight  
  
Well I bumped into a man whod been a boxer  
Asked him what had been his greatest night  
He looked into the corners of his memory  
Searching for a picture of the fight  
But he said he always had a feeling  
That he lacked a little extra height  
Could have used a little extra height  
Yes mate you heard right  
He always had a feeling that he might have lacked a little height  
  
Look at the average person  
Speak to the man in the queue  
Can you imagine the first one is you  
  
Look at the average person
