You think you own whatever land you land on  
The Earth is just a dead thing you can claim  
But I know every rock and tree and creature  
Has a life has a spirit has a name  
  
You think the only people who are people  
Are the people who look and think like you  
But if you walk the footsteps of a stranger  
Youll learn things you never knew you never knew  
  
Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon  
Or asked the grinning bobcat why he grinned  
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain  
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind  
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind  
  
Come run the hidden pine trails of the forest  
Come taste the sunsweet berries of the earth  
Come roll in all the riches all around you  
And for once never wonder what theyre worth  
The rainstorm and the river are my brothers  
The heron and the otter are my friends  
And we are all connected to each other  
In a circle in a hoop that never ends  
  
Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon  
Or let the eagle tell you where hes been  
Can you sing with all the voices of the mountain  
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind  
Can you paint with all the colors of the wind  
  
How high does the sycamore grow  
If you cut it down then youll never know  
  
And youll never hear the wolf cry to the blue corn moon  
For whether we are white or copperskinned  
We need to sing with all the voices of the mountain  
Need to paint with all the colors of the wind  
You can own the earth and still  
All youll own is earth until  
You can paint with all the colors of the wind
