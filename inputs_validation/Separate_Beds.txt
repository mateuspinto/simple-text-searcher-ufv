Tonight I take her from her parents  
I came along to her rescue  
Without a word about arrangements  
She came along without a clue  
So I said my love I want to take you  
A place I have inside my head  
And so it seemed I had to love you  
With some cards and separate beds  
  
Her mother didnt like me  
She thought I was on drugs  
My mother didnt like her  
Shed never peel the spuds  
So we took off together  
And stayed at Mrs Smiths  
Breakfast at half seven  
Where you can view the cliffs  
  
The moon was full and in our window  
I could see her turning in her bed  
I was loved but all in limbo  
There was time to pass but not to spend  
Soon I saw that this was silly  
Spending all my wages on this peach  
When we could sit so very pretty  
And get our heads down out on the beach  
  
Her father seemed to like me  
I helped him fix his car  
My father seemed to like her  
And I couldnt see the harm  
In going off together  
To see the pier and lights  
So we could be together  
In separate beds tonight
