C moon C moon C moon is she  
C moon C moon C moon to me  
  
How come no one older than me  
Ever seems to understand the things I want to to do  
It will be L7 and Id never get to heaven  
If I filled my head with glue  
Whats it all to you

C moon C moon C moon to me  
  
Bobby lived with Patty  
But they never told her daddy  
What their love was all about  
She could tell her lover that he thought but  
She never was the type to let it out  
Whats it all about
