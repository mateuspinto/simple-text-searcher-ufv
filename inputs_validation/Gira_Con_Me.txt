The world wanders with me tonight  
  
Little steps I take with you  
I follow your heart and I follow the moon  
So hidden far away from me  
The world wanders with us tonight  
  
Ahhh if only far away from here existed  
A place where to discover my heart  
  
To know if it can love you or not  
  
And it will wander and it will wander  
This heart of mine along with you  
And the earth will wander  
My life will wander and yes yes one day it will understand  
  
Its you who wanders with me tonight  
Its you who wanders far from here  
But yes I know that you are my moon  
Something you show something you dont  
  
There are blue roads in the sky  
There are eyes and the sky is already there  
Yes I think this is the stars  
Ahh if I could stop like this  
  
And it will wander and it will wander  
My heart far from you  
And the earth will wander  
My life will wander and one day yes yes it will understand  
  
Heart already far away  
Yes you are the moon  
If only I could discover it in the sky  
  
And it will wander and it will wander  
Yes it will wander this heart of mine  
And the earth will wander my life will wander  
And one day yes it will understand  
And one day yes it will understand you
