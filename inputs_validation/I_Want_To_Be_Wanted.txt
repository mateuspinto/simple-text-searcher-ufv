Alone so alone that I could cry  
I want to be wanted  
Alone watching lovers passing by  
I want to be wanted  
  
When Im kissed I want his lips to really kiss me  
When were apart I want his heart to really miss me  
I want to know he loves me so  
His eyes are misty  
Thats the way I want to be loved  
  
Alone just my lonely heart knows how  
I want to be wanted  
Right now not tomorrow but right now  
I want to be wanted  
  
I want someone to share my laughter and my tears with  
Someone I know Id love to spend a million years with  
When is this someone somewhere meant for me  
  
I want to want someone to share my laughter and my tears with  
Someone I know Id love to spend a million years with  
When is this someone somewhere meant for me  
Oh meant for me ooh meant for me
