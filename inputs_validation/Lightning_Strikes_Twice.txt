I feel the breeze on my face in expectance  
Not very long before the storm reaches here  
Off in the distance the lightning is flashing again  
Feel something strong as the power draws near  
  
Is it the rolling of thunder that scares you  
Is it the crashing of clouds that hold fear  
But all I know as I sit in a corner alone  
It takes me back to my childhood again  
  
And as I wait and I look for an answer  
To all the things going round in my head  
I ask myself could it be a disaster and when  
Its maybe threatening to happen again  
  
As the ominous light draws near  
Theres a lone dog howls in the park  
All the people hurry inside  
As a lightning flash lights dark  
The storm is nearly here  
Only God will know  
  
Youre sitting alone you watch  
As the wind is blowing treetops  
And the swaying rustling leaves  
Plenty of time to perceive  
As you wait for rain to fall  
Only God knows  
The whole sky glows  
  
Maybe lightning strikes twice  
Maybe lightning strikes twice
