Pack my bags and my regrets  
Every moment that Ive wasted  
Chasing after my pursuit of happiness  
Has only left me searching  
There must be more  
  
Take my life  
And lift me up to the sky  
Take my dreams  
And help me to fly  
On the wing of the stability  
Come rewrite the history  
To which only you are chasing after  
Take this life and make it matter  
  
Help me give more than I take  
And let me see into somebody elses heartache  
And be the difference love can make  
My heart is finding out theres gotta be more  
  
Take my life  
And lift me up to the sky  
Take my dreams  
And help me to fly  
On the wing of the stability  
Come rewrite the history  
To which only you are chasing after  
Take this life and make it matter  
  
Only one life to live  
Only one love to give  
Only one life  
Only one love  
So make it matter  
  
Only one life to live  
Only one love to give  
Only one life  
Only one love  
So make it matter  
  
Only one life  
Only one love  
Heres my life  
Take it make it matter  
  
Pack my bags and my regrets  
  
Take my life  
And lift me up to the sky  
Take my dreams  
And help me to fly  
On the wing of the stability  
Come rewrite the history  
To which only you are chasing after  
Take this life and make it matter  
  
Make it make it matter  
  
Only one life  
Only one love  
Only one life  
Only one love  
Make it matter  
Make it matter
