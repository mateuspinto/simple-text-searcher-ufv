Chorus  
cause now I aint wit cha know that I miss ya some how I carry on  
I can still picture when I was wit cha like you was never gone  
I remember the good times all of the bad times  
I dedicate this song to my niggas laid out til my niggas lay down  
Can Ya Hear Me I know you hear me  
  
Fabolous  
Now we was once two niggas of the same kind  
Quick to holla at a bitch with the same lines  
Quick to draw on a nigga with the same nines  
But at the same time we was on some different shit  
cause you was with a bitch that I beg to differ wit  
I told you sniff a bit and you could get a whif of it  
But you kept a closed nose when it came to those hoes  
And Im your nigga so I tried to smell em wrong for ya  
Wasnt there to take the fault for ya But if you hear me  
I dedicate this song for ya He was setup in a stick up  
By a girl he used to pick up on the upper west side  
I used to help him chop a brick up They found him in his pickup  
Pants down and dick up leaning with one in his head  
And one in his chest One of the best at this husslin shit  
But his downfall was that he put his trust in a bitch and its fucked up  
  
Chorus  
  
Fabolous  
I remember selling three bricks of raw powder  
Turn my man into a star in 24 hours  
He didnt care spent the money in like 4 hours  
On a Benz with like 400 and Horsepower  
And a chain that had christ on it a rollie with a lot of Ice on it  
A pinky ring with a price on it when he come around  
Its likely that he blunted  
With a pretty lady in them Nikes that you wanted  
Its well know he kept it on his hip like a cell phone  
If you speak with him you can pick up on his jail tone  
He used to say he wasnt going back without blowing back  
And now Im black I wouldnt put it past him  
The Ds would Harass him til he finally blacked out  
They told my nigga to freeze but he still backed out  
Shots fired til his trigger finger got tired  
All the newspapers said was Another Nigga Dead  
And its fucked up  
  
Chorus  
  
Fabolous  
You can catch me in a cherry red 850 nice ass  
Great titties face pretty everybody know that she date smitty  
A big time dealer thats doing a state biddin  
Who did more than his share of dirt in the world  
Enough to make a nigga think about hurtin his girl  
So he used to tell his queen to stay to the castle  
Away from the hassle to the day that he pass through  
Theres some enemies he might have who may want to blast you  
She stayed for a few years thats until a few pairs  
Convinced her to come and hang out around New Years  
Its been awhile you can see it in her smile  
And she ran into her mans CoDefendant in the trial  
Who started going on about how he moving on  
About running with them same niggas Smitty had warned about  
She slid off told her girl she had to drop her kid off  
They found her in the parking lot somebody blew her lid off  
And its fucked up
