I wonder how many people here tonight remember Hubert Humphrey he used to be
a Senator From time to time you read something about him pinning a medal on
somebody or making a speech or every now and then you read something in one
of those where are they now columns Whatever became of Deanna Durbin and
Hubert Humphrey and so on  
  
This became quite an issue last winter at the time of Winston Churchills
funeral when President Johnson was too ill to go and somebody suggested that
he send Hubert and he said Hubert Who and all America was singing  
  
Whatever became of Hubert  
Has anyone heard a thing  
Once he shone on his own  
Now he sits home alone  
And waits for the phone to ring  
  
Once a fiery liberal spirit  
Ah but now when he speaks he must clear it  
Second fiddles a hard part I know  
When they dont even give you a bow  
  
We must protest this treatment Hubert  
Says each newspaper reader  
As someone once remarked to Schubert  
Take us to your Lieder  
Sorry about that  
  
Whatever became of you Hubert  
We miss you so tell us please  
Are you sad Are you cross  
Are you gathering moss  
While you wait for the boss to sneeze  
  
Does Lyndon recalling when he was VP  
Say Ill do unto you like they did unto me  
Do you dream about staging a coup  
Hubert what happened to you
