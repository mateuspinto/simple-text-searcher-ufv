A ray of hope flickers in the sky  
A tiny spark lights up way up high  
All across the land dawns a brand new morn  
This comes to pass when a child is born  
A silent wish sails the seven seas  
The winds of change whisper in the trees  
And the walls of doubt crumble tossed and torn  
This comes to pass when a child is born  
A rosy hue settles all around  
Youve got the feel youre on solid ground  
For a spell or two no one seems forlorn  
This comes to pass when a child is born  
Its all a dream an illusion now  
It must come true sometime soon somehow  
All across the land dawns a brand new morn  
This comes to pass when a child is born
