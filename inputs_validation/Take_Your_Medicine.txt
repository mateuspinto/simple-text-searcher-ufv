Walk with my eyes closed  
I bump my head  
Look at the stars falling on the ground  
Saw someone crawling underneath my bed  
Looked in the mirror caught my reflection said oh  
  
Just take your medicine  
Just take your medicine  
And dont complain if it dont taste good  
Just take your medicine  
Just take your medicine  
If it dont do the trick then I know what will  
  
Open the paper  
Eat ham and eggs  
Java in a cup  
Middle of the front page  
I saw a man with a gun  
Pointing at his head  
Eyes in the camera  
I can almost hear him say oh  
  
Just take your medicine  
Just take your medicine  
And dont complain if it dont taste good  
Just take your medicine  
Just take your medicine  
If it dont kill ya first then I know what will  
  
I met an angel  
Come from above  
I buy her everything  
Could this be love  
She gives me sweet dreams and nightmares too  
Early in the morning she whispers in my ear oh  
  
Chorus
