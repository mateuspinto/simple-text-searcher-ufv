Who are you to wave your finger  
You must have been out your head  
Eye hole deep in muddy waters  
You practically raised the dead  
  
Rob the grave to snow the cradle  
Then burn the evidence down  
Soapbox house of cards and glass  
So dont go tossin your stones around  
  
You must have been high  
You must have been high  
You must have been  
  
Foot in mouth and head up ass  
So what you talkin bout  
Difficult to dance round this one  
Till you pull it out boy  
  
You must have been so high  
You must have been so high  
  
Steal burrow reefer  
Save your shady inference  
Kangaroo done hung the juror with the innocent  
  
Now youre weeping shades of cozen indigo  
Got lemon juice up in your eye  
When you pissed all over my black kettle  
You must have been high high  
You must have been high high  
  
Who are you to wave your finger  
So full of it  
Eyeballs deep in muddy waters  
Fucking hypocrite  
  
Liar lawyer mirror show me  
Whats the difference  
Kangaroo done hung the guilty with the innocent  
  
Now youre weeping shades of cozen indigo  
Got lemon juice up in your eye  
When you pissed all over my black kettle  
  
You must have been  
  
So who are you to wave your finger  
Who are you to wave your fat fingers at me  
You must have been out your mind  
  
Weeping shades of indigo  
Trapped without a reason  
Weeping shades of indigo  
  
Liar lawyer mirror for you  
Whats the difference  
Kangaroo be stoned  
Hes guilty as the government  
  
Now youre weeping shades of cozen indigo  
Got lemon juice up in your eye  
When you pissed all over my black kettle  
  
You must have been high high high high  
  
Eyeballs deep in bloody waters  
Youre balls deep in muddy waters  
Ganja Please  
You must have been out your mind
