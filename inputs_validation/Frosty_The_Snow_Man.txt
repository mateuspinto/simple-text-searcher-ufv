Frosty the Snowman  
Was a jolly happy soul  
With a corncob pipe and a button nose  
And two eyes made out of coal  
Frosty the Snowman  
  
Is a fairytale they say  
He was made of snow  
But the children know  
How he came to life one day  
There must have been some magic  
  
In that old silk hat they found  
For when they placed it on his head  
He began to dance around  
Frosty the Snowman  
  
Was alive as he could be  
And the children say  
He could laugh and play  
Just the same as you and me  
Frosty the Snowman  
  
Knew the sun was hot that day  
So he said lets run  
And well have some fun  
Now before I melt away  
Down to the village  
  
With a broomstick in his hand  
Running here and there all around the square  
Saying catch me if you can  
He led them down the streets of town  
  
Right to the traffic cop  
And he only paused a moment when  
He heard him holler stop  
Frosty the Snowman  
  
Had to hurry on his way  
But he waved goodbye  
Saying dont you cry  
Ill be back again some day  
Thumpety thump thump  
  
Thumpety thump thump  
Look at Frosty go  
Thumpety thump thump  
Thumpety thump thump  
Over the hills of snow
