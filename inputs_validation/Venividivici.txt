Are the Wings of Angels all a lie Tell me is this  
not you Are these Signs and Warnings all we know  
Tell me is this not you West Wind at my shoulder  
North Wind at my back On the Bridge of Death no  
turning back The Cavern waits before me a Falcon  
at my fist Seven Rings of Knowledge I exist    to Kill     
Guardian of the Red Queen Seven Rivers wide This  
wont end til one of us has died Eternal Death devour  
those who left their Mark Bleeding all the Light out  
of the Dark    to Kill     
Gods of the Night Gods of Day Lead me to another  
place We have the Force to make Wrong Right As the  
River leaves the stream All your yesterdays shining  
bands unfold With the Power to Smash  
WE CAME WE SAW WE CONQUERED YOU ALL WE CAME WE SAW  
WE LIVE BY THE SWORD WE CAME WE SAW WE CONQUERED YOU  
ALL WE CAME WE SAW WE LIVE BY THE SWORD  
Arrows rip my shoulder forge a distant Prize Shadows  
of their Might I know their Eyes On the Black Horizon  
see our Banners Wave Baring all Perdition for the  
Brave    to Kill     
Gods of the Night Gods of Day Lead me to another place  
We have the Force to make Wrong Right As the River runs  
away    All your yesterdays shining bands of gold  
With the Guardian that hangs on the Pine We are Children  
of those who left their Mark With the Power to Smash        
WE CAME WE SAW WE CONQUERED YOU ALL WE CAME WE SAW  
WE LIVE BY THE SWORD WE CAME WE SAW WE CONQUERED YOU  
ALL WE CAME WE SAW WE LIVE BY THE SWORD All your  
yesterdays shine on Wings of Light Sky Father Lord of our  
Sorrows our Victory is at hand Watch us    SHINE     
Gods of the Night where are you now I laugh at your Fate   
Fortunes on the run see it now    WE CAME WE SAW WE  
CONQUERED YOU ALL WE CAME WE SAW WE LIVE BY THE SWORD WECAME  
WE SAW WE CONQUERED YOU ALL WE CAME WE SAW WE LIVE BY THESWORD     
Will we ever meet again Will we see the Light of Love At the  
Edge of the World Hold it now will we see the Sun AriseRecognize  
the God in Man at the Edge of the World
