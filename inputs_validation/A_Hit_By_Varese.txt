Please wont you sing me  
A thing that will bring me right into the sky  
If you would play it  
Just lay it down say it will help me get by  
  
Something to move me  
Remove me and grove me you want to know why  
Im so tired of oldies  
And moldies and goldies that I want to cry  
  
Can you play free  
Or in three or agree to attempt something new  
The people need you  
A seed that will lead to a hit by Varese
