A Boy is Born in Bethlehem  
Allelujah Allelujah  
And joy is in Jerusalem  
Allelujah Allelujah  
  
And there He lay in manger poor  
Allelujah Allelujah  
Whose rein shall last for evermore  
Allelujah Allelujah  
  
The cats and dogs and all the heard  
Allelujah Allelujah  
Knew well that Boy to be the Lord  
Allelujah Allelujah  
  
And kings from out the East there were  
Allelujah Allelujah  
With gold and frankincense and myrrh  
Allelujah Allelujah  
  
He lived like us in form and dress  
Allelujah Allelujah  
Without our taint of wickedness  
Allelujah Allelujah  
  
He came our souls to purify  
Allelujah Allelujah  
And bring us safe to bliss on high  
Allelujah Allelujah  
  
Therefore let us with one accord  
Allelujah Allelujah  
On this His Birthday praise the Lord  
Allelujah Allelujah
