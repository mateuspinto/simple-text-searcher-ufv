Lord I long to see You glorified  
In everything I do  
All my heartfelt dreams I put aside  
To see Your Spirit move with power in my life  
  
Jesus Lord of all eternity  
Your children rise in faith  
All the earth displays Your glory  
And each word You speak brings life to all who hears  
  
Lord of all  
All of creations  
Sings Your praise  
In heaven and earth  
Lord we stand  
Hearts open wide  
Be exalted
