I felt so sure of the love that we shared  
There was no reason for love to be scared  
Then I heard a rumor that started to flow  
Slowly but surely the truth began to show  
  
And I started wondering  
As I picked up the phone  
And a man started asking  
If you where at home  
  
Chorus  
You treat me like a fool  
But youre so wrong  
Im gonna send you back  
Where you belong  
  
I put my trust in you  
But I was wrong  
Im gonna send you back  
Where you belong  
  
Chorus  
  
I never had any doubt in my mind  
Now you have showed me  
That love can make you blind  
  
Back where you belong  
Back where you belong  
Back where you belong  
Back where you belong  
Back where you belong  
Back where you belong  
Back where you belong  
Back where you belong  
Back where you belong  
Back where you belong  
Back where you belong  
Back where you belong
