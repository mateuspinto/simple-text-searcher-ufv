Oh he deals em off off the top ties em off  
Fills it up with his past gets carried away  
Oh half his life a handmedown wasted away  
Oh he fills it up with the love of a girl  
  
Oh he left it alone drilled the pain with money to buy  
  
How he makes his getaway  
How he makes his getaway  
  
Oh he chose a path heavy the fall quarter to four  
Fills his mind with the thought of a girl  
  
How he makes his getaway  
How he makes his getaway  
How he makes his getaway  
Getaway
