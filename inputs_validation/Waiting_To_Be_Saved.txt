I heard about this story in the news today  
About a man who lost his senses lost his way  
About a man who had his world taken away  
He took his life but not before he made them pay  
So go on ask yourself the question  
Are you convinced that youre OK  
Often times it makes me wonder  
Are we not that safe  
  
I heard a story about this woman yesterday  
A twentyseven year old teacher of fifth grade  
A kid brought a gun to school and took her life away  
The politicians placed the blame and nothing changed  
  
And I feel it today  
It feels like nothing else nothing else  
I am waiting to be saved  
Helpless  
I feel it today  
It feels like nothing else nothing else  
I am waiting to be saved  
  
I heard a story from the media today  
About a man who lost his senses lost his way  
About a woman who was taken yesterday  
About the children who may never see the light of day
