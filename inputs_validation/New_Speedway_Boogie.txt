Please dont dominate the rap Jack  
If youve got nothing new to say  
If you please dont back up the track  
This trains got to run today  
  
I spent a little time on the mountain  
I spent a little time on the hill  
I heard some say Better run away  
Others say Better stand still  
  
Now I dont know but I been told  
Its hard to run with the weight of gold  
Other hand I have heard it said  
Its just as hard with the weight of lead  
  
Who can deny who can deny  
Its not just a change in style  
One step done and another begun  
And I wonder how many miles  
  
I spent a little time on the mountain  
I spent a little time on the hill  
I heard some say Better run away  
Others say Better stand still  
  
Now I dont know but I been told  
Its hard to run with the weight of gold  
Other hand I have heard it said  
Its just as hard with the weight of lead  
  
Things went down we dont understand  
But I think in time we will  
Now I dont know but I was told  
In the heat of the sun a man died of cold  
  
Keep on coming or stand and wait  
With the sun so dark and the hour so late  
You can overlook the lack Jack  
Of any other highway to ride  
  
Its got no signs or dividing lines  
And very few rules to guide  
I spent a little time on the mountain  
I spent a little time on the hill  
I heard some say Better run away  
Others say Better stand still  
  
Now I dont know but I been told  
Its hard to run with the weight of gold  
Other hand I have heard it said  
Its just as hard with the weight of lead  
I saw things getting out of hand  
I guess they always will  
  
Now I dont know but I been told  
If the horse dont pull you got to carry the load  
I dont know whose backs that strong  
Maybe find out before too long  
  
One way or another one way or another  
One way or another this darkness got to give  
One way or another one way or another  
One way or another this darkness got to give  
One way or another one way or another  
One way or another this darkness got to give
