I was wasting my time  
Trying to fall in love  
Disappointment came to me and  
Booted me and bruised and hurt me  
  
Thats how people grow up  
Thats how people grow up  
  
I was wasting my time  
Looking for love  
Someone must look at me  
And see their sunlit dream  
  
I was wasting my time  
Praying for love  
For a love that never comes from  
Someone who does not exist and  
  
Thats how people grow up  
Thats how people grow up  
  
Let me live before I die  
Not me not I  
  
I was wasting my life  
Always thinking about myself  
Someone on the deathbed said  
There are other sorrows too  
  
I was driving my car  
I crashed and broke my spine  
So yes there are things worse in life than  
Never being someones sweetie  
  
Thats how people grow up  
Thats how people grow up  
  
As for me Im ok  
For now anyway
