The news is out all over town  
That youve been seen arunnin round  
I know that I should leave but then  
I just cant go you win again  
  
This heart of mine could never see  
What everybody knew but me  
Just trusting you was my great sin  
What can I do you win again  
  
Im sorry for your victim now  
Cause soon his head like mine will bow  
Hell give his heart but all in vain  
And someday say you win again  
  
You have no heart you have no shame  
You take true love and give the blame  
I guess that I should not complain  
I love you still you win again
