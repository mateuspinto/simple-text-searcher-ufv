Its still getting worse after everything I tried  
What if I found a way to wash it all aside  
What if she touches with those fingertips  
As the words spill out like fire from her lips  
  
Chorus  
If she says come inside Ill come inside for her  
If she says give it all Ill give everything to her  
I am justified  
I am purified  
I am sanctified  
  
Inside you  
Heavens just a rumor shell dispel  
As she walks me through the nicest parts of hell  
I still dream of lips I never should have never kissed  
Well she knows exactly what I cant resist  
  
Chorus  
  
I think we should get in the front right now  
Get in the front right now  
Doesnt that feel good  
Now youre ready to go get it  
Now I want you to get in there and get the job done  
Life is great  
Life is terrific  
Thank you God for another wonderful day  
Im still caught up in another of her spells  
Well shes turning me into someone else  
Everyday I hope and pray this will end  
But when I can I do it all again  
And if she says come inside Ill come inside for her  
If she says give it all Ill give everything to her  
I am justified  
I am purified  
I am sanctified  
Inside you  
I am purified  
I am terrified  
I am sanctified  
Inside you  
Even when its bowling shapes and see your life begin to change
