Hoping for a new beginning  
To take me away from my surroundings  
So I can finally say goodbye  
Wondering whatll become of us  
When we are all old and gray  
And this time that weve spent together  
Was well worth our wait  
Think of the fun that we had  
Not caring until the next morning  
It feels so good to go through life  
With your eyes half open  
  
We are all one and the same  
We are lovers and brothers and sisters  
And most of all friends  
  
These years have passed us by so fast  
It seems like we never got the chance  
To realize how good life really was  
And let the moment last  
And it feels like it was only yesterday  
When we walked into this place  
And said I cant wait till I get out of here  
And now as we walk down this aisle  
With four years all rolled up in a scroll you cant help but think  
Hey Where did the time go  
  
We are all one and the same  
We are lovers and brothers and sisters  
And most of all friends  
Hold on to your memories  
Hold on to those little things  
And I hope you receive as much as you get  
Cause when you die theyre the only things  
That you can take to your grave  
  
These are the days of your life  
And dont let them pass you by  
Cause you never know when you might take your last breath  
And so take a deep one tonight  
  
Good friends we had along the way  
And good friends that didnt make it to where we stand today  
But we all know that theyre looking down on us  
And even though their lives were cut short  
We still remember the little thing that made us laugh about them  
And do you remember when and where did you meet them  
  
We are all one and the same  
We are lovers and brothers and sisters  
And most of all friends  
Hold on to your memories  
Hold on to those little things  
And I hope you receive as much as you get  
Cause when you die theyre the only things  
That you can take to your grave  
  
And as we approach this final day  
Where we all will go our separate ways  
So go hug and kiss your friends  
And say goodbye to them
