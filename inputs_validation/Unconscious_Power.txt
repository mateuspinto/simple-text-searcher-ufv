We all want to prepare you  
The unbelievable is going to happen  
It will linger in your mind forever  
Let this carry you wherever wherever  
Triggering the unconscious power  
Removing all your inhibitions  
Releasing complete freedom of thought  
Sensations of every sense will prepare  
With this you will see every thing  
Triggering the unconscious power  
Triggering the unconscious power  
I say to you nothin for now  
For now we know all  
We know all  
We know all  
We know all
