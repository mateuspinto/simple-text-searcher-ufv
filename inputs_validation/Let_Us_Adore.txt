The heavens declare  
The glory of God  
And all of the world  
Will join the praise  
His wonders proclaim  
  
The oceans and skies  
Lift up their voice  
And all he has made  
Will rise to bless  
The King of all kings  
  
Let us adore Him  
Let us adore Him  
Jeus Christ is the Lord  
  
Come and behold Him  
Bow down before Him  
Jesus Christ is the Lord  
  
Eternitys King  
Is coming again  
Though all of the earth  
Will fade away  
His truth will remain  
  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
You are worthy of all praise
