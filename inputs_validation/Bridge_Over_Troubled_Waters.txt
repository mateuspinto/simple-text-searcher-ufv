When youre weary  
Feeling small  
When tears are in your eyes  
I will dry them all  
  
Im on your side  
  
When times get rough  
And friends just cant be found  
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will lay me down  
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will lay me down  
  
When youre down and out  
When youre on the street  
When evening falls so hard  
I will comfort you  
  
Ill take your part  
When darkness comes  
And pain is all around  
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will lay me down  
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will lay me down  
  
Sail on Silver Girl  
Sail on by  
Your time has come to shine  
All your dreams are on their way  
  
See how they shine  
If you need a friend  
Im sailing right behind  
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will ease your mind  
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will ease your mind
