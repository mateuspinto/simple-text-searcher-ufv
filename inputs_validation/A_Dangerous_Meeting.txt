Tonight the circle is meeting again  
Who will be the first to fall in trance  
In here nobody is sensing the rain  
Tonight a spirit will glance  
  
So as theyre approaching ghostly hour  
Seven people here are joining hands  
They think they know the spirit to appear  
Contact the table starts to dance  
  
Time is standing still  
Its a dangerous meeting  
Theyre gonna get themselves killed  
  
Tonight the circle is broken forever  
Seven people dead within a trance  
In here nobody is sensing the rain  
Tonight seven souls are reaching Hell  
  
Time was standing still  
The meeting is over  
Their journey is on  
  
Oh they should have known  
Not to play with the powers of Hell  
  
Some people have lost their way  
Some people have lost their mind
