Let me be a part of you  
Even for an hour or two  
Besides whatever else you do  
Let me be a part of you  
  
I could be your one who knows  
Im a one a chance to grow  
Reason why I want you to  
Let me be a part of you  
  
Its worth the risk so say you will  
Let me be the one who waits until  
Your dark demand needs to be filled  
So let me be a part of you  
Just because I want you to  
Something happens when you do  
So let me be a part of you  
  
Its worth the risk so say you will  
Let me be the one who waits until  
Your dark demand needs to be filled  
So let me be a part of you  
  
I could be your one who knows  
Im the one a chance to go  
Reason why I want you to  
Let me be a part of you  
  
Something happens when you do  
So let me be a part of you  
Besides whatever else you do  
Let me be a part of you
