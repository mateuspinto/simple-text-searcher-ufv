They came to the land to kill on command  
They ride through the dark of the night  
Metal warrior stands over victims whose hands  
Grab for their last chance of life  
  
Bright shields sharp swords  
March forward for their Lord  
Set the bow rulers come  
Meet your maker  
Battle cries silent screams  
Submerge the Devil in evil dreams  
Feel the blade rulers come  
Meet your maker  
  
I live for the kill I do it at will  
Let the weak ride back to the lair  
Now they will kneel to leather and steel  
Gasp for the last breath of air  
  
Blood runs heads roll  
Enemy fear take the soul  
Set the bow rulers come  
Meet your maker  
Lash out strike first  
Blood of the dead quench my thirst  
Feel the pain rulers come  
Meet your maker  
  
A gilded warrior wonders why  
His fear becomes new life on high  
Looking down the dead wont tell  
Why his soul existence lives on in Hell  
Long live the spirit  
In a life that knows no end  
Many pass before him  
Many in the wind
