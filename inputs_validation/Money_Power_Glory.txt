You say that you wanna go  
To a land thats far away  
How are we supposed to get there  
With the way that were living today  
  
You talk lots about God  
Freedom comes from the call  
But thats not what this bitch wants  
No what I want at all  
  
I want money power and glory  
I want money and all your power all your glory  
Alleluia I wanna take you for all that you got  
Alleluia Im gonna take them for all that they got  
  
The sun also rises on those who fail to call  
My life it comprises of losses and wins and fails and falls  
I can do it if you really really like that  
I know what you really want bbaby  
I can do it if you think you like that  
You should run boy run  
  
I want money power and glory  
I want money and all your power all your glory  
Alleluia I wanna take you for all that you got  
Alleluia Im gonna take them for all that they got  
  
The sun also rises on those who fail to call  
My life it comprises of losses and wins and fails and falls  
I can do it if you really really like that  
I know what you really want bbaby  
I can do it if you think you like that  
You should run boy run  
  
I want money power and glory  
I want money and all your power all your glory  
Alleluia I wanna take you for all that you got  
Alleluia Im gonna take them for all that they got  
  
The sun also rises on those who fail to call  
My life it comprises of losses and wins and fails and falls  
I can do it if you really really like that  
I know what you really want bbaby  
I can do it if you think you like that  
You should run boy run
