Pure as we begin  
Pure as we come in  
Pure as we begin  
Ruled by will alone  
  
Pure as we begin  
Here we have a stone  
Gather place erase so  
Shelter turns to home  
  
Pure as we begin  
Here we have a stone  
Throw to stay the stranger  
Swore to crush his bones  
  
Ruled by will alone  
  
Spark becomes a flame  
Flame becomes a fire  
Light the way or warm this  
Home we occupy  
  
Spark becomes a flame  
Flame becomes a fire  
Forge a blade to slay the stranger  
Take whatever we desire  
  
Moved by will alone  
Pure as we begin  
  
Pure as we begin  
Move by will alone  
Leave as we come in  
Pure as light  
Return to one  
  
Move by will alone  
Move by will alone
