Goodbye cowgirl the trail ends here  
Goodbye cowgirl the tracks of all the dreams that we were chasin disappear  
We take different trails I prefer the rails to some city lights where theyre
civilized  
Goodbye cowgirl set your stirrups high  
Goodbye cowgirl you got to ride a many rough and dusty rocky mile  
I was the enemy in your camp you see I was restless nights by the campfire
light  
 strings   
Goodbye cowgirl watch that western star  
Goodbye cowgirl ride around the mountains do not push yourself too far  
I will remember you what else could I do lifes like rodeos open and they
close
