Move along staying close to the wall  
Looking over your shoulder just in time  
Avoid the light close your eyes  
And put your hand in mine  
And put your hand in mine  
  
Are we in danger or is it that  
You think we might be   
But I think Id like to get out of here  
This place it frightens me  
This place it frightens me  
  
Chorus  
Running for our lives  
At least were pretending we are  
Running for our lives  
We never get very far Repeat x3  
  
Stop pretending  
This is a childs adventure  
The only way I can take it  
Is playing the game  
  
Be quiet theres a gate ahead  
Do you think we can make it   
Will it be different or just the same   
How long can we keep escaping Repeat x3  
Into another prison   
  
Chorus  
  
Move along staying close to the wall  
Looking over your shoulder just in time  
Avoid the light close your eyes  
And put your hand in mine  
And put your hand in mine  
  
Chorus  
  
We never get very far Repeat x3  
We never get
