I once was lost in sin but Jesus took me in  
And then a little light from heaven filled my soul  
He bathed my heart in love and wrote my name above  
And just a little talk with my Jesus made me whole  
Now let us have a little talk with Jesus let us tell him all about our
troubles  
He will hear our faintest cry and we will answer by and by  
Now when you feel a little prayer wheel turning  
Then youll know a little fire is burning  
You will find a little talk with Jesus makes it right  
  
Now let us have a little talk  
  
I may have doubts and fears my eyes be filled with tears  
But Jesus is a friend who watches day and night  
I go to him in prayer he knows my every care  
And just a little talk with my Jesus gonna makes it right  
Now let us have a little talk  
Makes it right
