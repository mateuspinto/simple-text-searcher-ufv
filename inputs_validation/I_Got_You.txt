Hey did you hear about the one that got away  
They say he looked left  
She turned right meant to be together but not that night  
Its when fates running late we tend to make mistakes  
We go round and round from love to love  
Its either way too much or not enough  
  
Gimme lazy days with nothing better to do  
Than singin oh black water keep on rollin while I wait for you  
I dont care if it rains Ill be just fine  
Im leaving the ghosts behind until  
I got you I got you  
Youre the sun through my window warming my skin  
Oh you I got you  
Hey  
  
Then when one of them was taken the other one was waiting  
For the next big thing  
To bring them to the gates of heaven  
Or maybe just a late night in Vegas  
Its true thats what we do when were going down swingin  
Then coming up singing the blues  
Wearing out my shoes chasing new faces to get to you  
  
Driving home on a summer night  
Singin old black water  
Keep on rolling till the time is right  
I dont care if it rains Ill be just fine  
Sit back enjoy the ride  
  
Until I got you I got you  
Youre the sun through my window  
Warming my skin oh you I got you Like Sonny and Cher  
Except Ill be there for you I got you  
Let old black water bring us together  
  
Old black water keep on rolling  
Mississippi moon wont you keep on shining on me  
Old black water keep on rolling  
Mississippi moon wont you keep on shining on me  
Wanna hear some funky Dixieland  
Pretty Mama come on take me by the hand  
Wanna hear some funky Dixieland  
Pretty mama  
Here she comes  
  
I got you I got you  
Youre the sun through my window warming my skin  
Oh you I got you  
Like Sonny and Cher you know Ill be there for you  
I got you let old black water bring us together  
You I got you I got you  I got you baby  
By the hand hand take me by the hand  
Pretty mama dance with your daddy all night long  
Wanna hear some funky Dixieland  
Pretty mama come and take me by the hand  
By the hand hand take me by the hand  
Pretty mama dance with your daddy all night long  
Wanna hear some funky Dixieland  
Pretty mama come and take me by the hand  
By the hand hand take me by the hand  
Pretty mama dance with your daddy all night long  
Wanna hear some funky Dixieland  
Pretty mama come and take me by the hand
