Every star has a twinkle  
Every palm has a wrinkle  
Every leaf comes from a tree  
I would agree  
  
So if everything is made up of two  
And the sky really needs the blue  
For my other half  
Ill settle for you  
  
Every future has a past  
Every first has a last  
Every night has a day  
Come what may  
  
So if everything is made up of two  
Whether it be old or new  
For my other half  
Ill settle for you  
  
Who wants to be like a sea without a shore  
The love just drifting forever more  
Every smile has a frown  
All you gotta do is turn it upside down  
Every house has a door  
Of that Im sure  
  
So if everything is made up of two  
I think it would be best if you know  
For my other half  
Ill settle for you  
Dont you know Ill settle for you  
Ill settle for you  
If I had to settle baby  
Ill settle for you  
Dont you know Ill settle for you
