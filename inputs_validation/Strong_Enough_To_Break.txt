I dont feel myself today  
Just a figure in a big monopoly game  
Struggle is the price you pay  
You get just enough just to give it away  
Im sinking but Im floating away  
Throw me a line so I can anchor my pain  
The fabric is about to fray  
The fabric is about to fray  
  
Chorus  
Maybe you could take a look at yourself lately  
Maybe you could take a look at yourself lately  
Maybe you could take a look at yourself lately  
Things keep coming and I keep wondering  
I start feeling the walls close in  
Things keep coming and I keep stumbling  
I start feeling Im strong enough to break  
Oh I start feeling Im strong enough to break  
  
Been running through my mind today  
Scenarios to add to your hypocrisy  
No one ever takes the blame  
But everyone is searching for a cure to the pain  
Nothing ever seems to change  
Oh nothing ever seems to change  
We just play like broken records in a deaf mans charade  
  
Chorus  
  
Carry on just a pawn and the same old song  
Im still holding on  
The fabric is about to fray  
  
Maybe you could take a look at yourself lately  
Maybe you could take a look at yourself lately  
Things keep coming and I keep wondering  
I start feeling the walls close in  
Things keep coming and I keep stumbling  
I start feeling Im strong enough to break  
Things keep coming and I keep wondering  
I start feeling the walls close in  
Things keep coming and I keep stumbling  
I start feeling Im strong enough to break  
Oh I start feeling Im strong enough to break
