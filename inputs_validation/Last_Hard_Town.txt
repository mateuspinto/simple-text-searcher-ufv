Woke up on a bus and heard the driver say  
Friends fill it up with No 2  
Wondered where I was and wondered what today  
Would be demanding me to do  
Its not for me the last cause Im just goin  
Where lifes sendin me I guess  
The thing that keeps us goin is the good folks  
In the last hard town we met  
  
I sat pickin on my guitar till I saw  
The new sun comin through the skies  
Aint it funny how the truth is sometimes  
Written on an artificial high  
Carry water from the well until you know  
That all the children are refreshed  
The thing that keeps us goin is the good folks  
In the last hard town we met  
  
We were drinking too much yesterday  
Nobodys ever told us whats enough  
The ones that we shouldve prayed for more than likely  
Were the ones we had to cuss  
They applauded as we killed ourselves  
But angels dont have bourbon on their breath  
The thing that keeps us goin is the good folks  
In the last hard town we met  
  
They came to see the people that they thought we were  
And never changed their minds  
They explained the way that difference caused  
The folks who love a picker can be blind  
They misunderstood the words but understood  
That our intentions were the best  
The thing that keeps us goin is the good folks  
In the last hard town we met  
  
What a picker does for others is the thing  
Hes mainly doing for himself  
There were friends and there were neighbors  
But the good homes that we came from didnt help  
If theres anything youd like to say  
About us after we have gone to rest  
We would like someone to mention all the good folks  
In the last hard town we met
