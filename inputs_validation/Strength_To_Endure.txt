Walking through the cross fire heart  
Feeling heavy and hopeless Wonderin how I ever  
Will see through this darkness  
Every drop of blood can be so beautiful  
And I sure was bleedin the drops by the bucketful  
I have the strength to endure and all the love so pure  
I have the strength to endure becausebecause  
Im not afraid to tell her just how things work  
Ride a hurricane through the fast lane  
Always looking over my shoulder  
She said Theres something about you  
And neon lights always glow hot  
Baby we can see this through just give me  
All the strength youve got  
I have the strength to endure and all the love so pure  
I have the strength to endure because because  
Im not afraid to tell her just how things work  
Ride a hurricane through the fast lane  
Always looking over my shoulder  
She said Theres something about you  
And neon lights always glow hot  
Baby we can see this through just give me  
All the strength youve got  
I have the strength to endure and all the love so pure  
I have the strength to endure becausebecause
