I guess my heart has settled back to Earth  
I rode a dream so wild and free for all that dream was worth  
But true love is both a blessing and a curse  
Today my heart just settled back to Earth  
  
Now I know just how you felt that night so long ago  
But the dream for you had ended and you let me know  
So I bounced from sky to sky  
Tryin to keep the dream alive  
But everything I did just made it worse  
Guess my heart just settled back to Earth  
  
Love created songs that I still sing  
Love we knew still makes the rafters ring  
Tonight Ill sing for everything Im worth  
For all the hearts that settle back to Earth  
  
Songs our love created I still sing  
Love we knew still makes the raftersred  
Tonight Ill sing for everything Im worth  
For all the hearts that settle back to Earth  
  
Our song will never have a final verse  
Our hearts just finally settled back to Earth
