Listen to the color of your dreams  
Turn off your mind relax and float downstream  
Then its not dying then its not dying  
Lay down all thoughts surrender to the void  
And it is shining it is shining  
Now you may see the meaning of within  
It is being it is being  
Love is all love is everyone  
And it is knowing and it is knowing  
Let ignorance and hate mingle with dead  
It is believing it is believing  
Oh play the game existence to the end  
Of the beginning of the beginning  
Of the beginning beginning  
Turn off your mind relax and float downstream  
It is not dying it is not dying  
Play the game existence to the end  
Of the beginning of the beginning  
Of the beginning of the beginning  
Lay down all thoughts surrender to the void  
Of the beginning of the beginning of the beginning
