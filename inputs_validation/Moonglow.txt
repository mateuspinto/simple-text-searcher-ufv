It must have been Moonglow  
Way up in the blue  
It must have been Moonglow  
That led me straight to you  
  
I still hear you sayin  
Dear one hold me fast  
And I start to prayin  
Oh Lord please let this last  
We seem to float right through the air  
Heavenly songs seem to come from everywhere  
And now when theres Moonglow  
Way up in the blue  
I always remember  
That Moonglow gave me you  
That Moonglow gave me you  
  
We seem to float right through the air  
Heavenly songs seemed to come from everywhere  
And now when theres Moonglow  
Way up in the blue  
I always remember  
That Moonglow gave me you  
That Moonglow gave me you  
That Moonglow gave me you
