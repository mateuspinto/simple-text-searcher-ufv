Turn off your mind relax and float downstream  
It is not dying it is not dying  
Lay down all thoughts surrender to the void  
It is shining oh it is shining  
That you may see the meaning of within  
It is beginning oh it is beginning  
  
That love is all and love is evryone  
It is knowing oh it is knowing  
And ignorance and hate may mourn the dead  
It is believing oh it is believing  
So play the game existence to the end  
Of the beginning of the beginning  
  
Of the beginning of the beginning  
  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow way up high  
Theres a land that I dreamed of once in a lullaby  
  
okay
