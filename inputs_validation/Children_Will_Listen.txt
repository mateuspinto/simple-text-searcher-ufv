How do you say to your child in the night  
Nothing is all black but then nothing is all white  
How do you say it will all be alright  
When you know that it mightnt be true  
What do you do  
  
Careful the things you say  
Children will listen  
Careful the things you do  
Children will see  
And learn  
Children may not obey  
But children will listen  
Children will look to you  
For which way to turn  
To learn what to be  
Careful before you say  
listen to me  
Children will listen  
  
Careful the wish you make  
Wishes are children  
Careful the path they take  
Wishes come true  
Not free  
Careful the spell you cast  
Not just on children  
Sometimes the spell may last  
Past what you can see  
And turn against you  
  
Careful the tale you tell  
That is the spell  
Children will listen  
  
How can you say to a child whos in flight  
Dont slip away and i wont hold so tight  
What can you say that no matter how slight wont be misunderstood  
What do you leave to your child when youre dead  
Only what ever you put in its head  
Things that your mother and father had said  
Which were left to them too  
Careful what you say children will listen  
Careful you do it too children will see and learn  
Oh  
  
Guide them but step away  
Children will glisten  
Temper with what is true  
And children will turn  
If just to be free  
Careful before you say  
listen to me  
Children will listen  
Children will listen  
Children children will listen
