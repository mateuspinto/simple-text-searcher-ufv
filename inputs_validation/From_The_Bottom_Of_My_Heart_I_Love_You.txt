I cant be any more  
In love with you  
You gotta realize baby  
There aint nowhere  
I can find now  
  
Anymore to  
That I can criticize  
From the bottom of my heart  
I really love you  
Oh yes I do now  
  
It didnt take  
Too long to be sure  
From the bottom of my heart  
Oh I really do  
  
Things you do I admire  
And Im in love with you  
You gotta realize that baby  
  
Every day I love goes  
Higher and higher  
I find no faults in you  
That I can criticize  
  
From the bottom of my heart  
Oh I really love you  
Oh yes I do now  
  
It didnt take  
Too long to be sure  
From the bottom of my heart  
Oh I really do  
  
Now dont you ever go away  
Without you I dont know  
Just where to start over  
Im asking you to stay  
And baby I know Im saying it  
From the bottom of my heart  
  
Its a love that I know  
And Im in love with you  
Oh you gotta realize baby  
As day by day our love  
Will grow  
  
I find no faults in you  
That I can criticize  
From the bottom of my heart  
Oh I really love you  
Yes I do now  
  
It didnt take  
Too long to be sure  
From the bottom of my heart  
Oh I really do  
  
Oh I really do love you  
I really do love you baby  
Yeah I really love you  
Yeah love ohhh
