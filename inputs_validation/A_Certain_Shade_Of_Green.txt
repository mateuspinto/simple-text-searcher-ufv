A certain shade of green  
Tell me is that what you need  
All signs around say move ahead  
Could someone please explain to me your ever present  
Lack of speed  
  
Are your muscles bound by ropes  
Or do crutches cloud your day  
My sources say the road is clear  
And street signs point the way  
Are you gonna stand around till 2012 AD  
  
What are you waiting for  
A certain shade of green  
I think I grew a gray watching you procrastinate  
What are you waiting for  
A certain shade of green  
  
Would a written invitation  
Signed Choose now or lose it all  
Sedate your hesitation  
Or inflame and make you stall  
Youve been raised in limitation  
But that glove never fit quite right  
  
The time has come for handmedowns  
Choose anew please evolve  
Take flight  
What are you waiting for  
A written invitation  
A public declaration  
A private consolation
