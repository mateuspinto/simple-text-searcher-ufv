Break out jump  
Night line to Chicago  
Break out go  
Night shift in Tobago   
  
Break out shout  
Shakedown from Chicago  
Break out jump  
One two three four  
  
Put the rhythm in my bones  
Listen to my saxophone  
  
Break out jump  
Night line to Chicago  
Break out go  
Night shift in Tobago   
  
Break out shout  
Shakedown from Chicago  
Break out jump  
One two three four  
  
Put the rhythm in my bones  
Listen to my saxophone
