Junkies down in Brooklyn are going crazy  
Theyre laughing just like hungry dogs in the street  
Policemen are hiding behind the skirts of little girls  
Their eyes have turned the color of frozen meat  
  
No no no no no no no no no no no no  
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave  
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave  
  
Catholic schoolgirls have thrown away their mascara  
They chain themselves to the axles of big Mack trucks  
The sky is filled with hurt and shivering angels  
The fat lady lives Children start your trucks  
  
No no no no no no no no no no no no  
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave  
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave  
  
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave  
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave  
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave  
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave  
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave  
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave  
Joan Crawford has risen from the grave  
Joan Crawford has risen
