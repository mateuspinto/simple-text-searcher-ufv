The children of the summers end  
Gathered in the dampened grass  
We played Our songs and felt the London sky  
Resting on our hands  
It was Gods land  
It was ragged and naive  
It was Heaven  
  
Touch we touched the very soul  
Of holding each and every life  
We claimed the very source of joy ran through  
It didnt but it seemed that way  
I kissed a lot of people that day  
  
Oh to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon  
To paint that love upon a white balloon  
And fly it from the toppest top of all the tops that man has pushed beyond his  
Brain  
Satoria must be something just the same  
  
We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and
size  
We talked with tall Venusians passing through  
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head  
And away they soared  
Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud  
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd  
And we walked back to the road unchained  
  
The Sun Machine is coming down and were gonna have a party  
The Sun Machine is coming down and were gonna have a party  
The Sun Machine is coming down and were gonna have a party  
The Sun Machine is coming down and were gonna have a party  
The Sun Machine is coming down and were gonna have a party
