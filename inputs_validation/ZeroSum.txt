Theyre starting to open up the sky  
Theyre starting to reach down through  
And it feels like were living in that splitsecond of a car crash  
And time is slowing down  
And if we only had a little more time  
And this time is all there is  
  
Do you remember the time we  
And all the times we  
And should have  
And were going to  
I know  
And I know you remember  
How we could justify it all  
And we knew better  
In our hearts we knew better  
And we told ourselves it didnt matter  
And we chose to continue  
And none of that matters anymore  
In the hour of our twilight  
And soon it will be all said and done  
And we will all be back together as one  
If we will continue at all  
  
Chorus  
Shame on us  
Doomed from the start  
May God have mercy on our dirty little hearts  
Shame on us  
For all weve done  
And all we ever were  
Just zeros and ones  
  
And you never get away  
And you never get to take the easy way  
And all of this is a consequence  
Brought on by our own hand  
If you believe in that sort of thing  
And did you ever really find  
When you closed your eyes  
Any place that was still  
And at peace  
And I guess I just wanted to tell you  
As the light starts to fade  
That you are the reason  
That I am not afraid  
And I guess I just wanted to mention  
As the heavens will fall  
We will be together soon if we  
Will be anything at all  
  
Chorus  
  
Shame on us Shame on us  
Doomed from the start  
May God have mercy on our dirty little hearts  
Shame on us Shame on us  
For all we have done  
And all we ever were  
Just just zeros and ones
