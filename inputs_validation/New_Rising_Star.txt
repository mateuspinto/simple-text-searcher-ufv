The ugly mess you thought you were is fading fast  
Now somethings spoken through its virtues  
The night of black is rolling back at long last  
The wheel of fate turns to your fortune  
New rising star sinister symphony  
New rising sun shines on in sympathy  
Skin deepso cheap this thing called beauty  
Beholder railroader cold shoulder  
Identity is more than you find in the mirror  
I watched you grow your own in the dust of the bones  
From your older days  
New rising star sinister symphony  
New rising sun shines on in sympathy  
You were a stranger in your homeland  
Reborn on a spageage street transformation complete  
The fags and bitches rags and riches  
Leave them to the rest  
Your soul has found its pride inside its own breast  
New rising star sinister symphony  
New rising sun shines on in sympathy
