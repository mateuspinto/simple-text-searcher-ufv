I just know  
Though I cant see  
But I can feel his hands all over me  
His hot breath on me  
I cant resist  
His rope my wrists  
I never knew there might be days like this  
  
Dream on he says  
Dream on he says  
Will I be saved  
From these Titanic days  
  
A violent frenzy  
In a none too cheap hotel  
He says its hazy  
But I remember it so well  
His arms his face  
The way my words got twisted out of place  
  
Dream on he says  
Dream on he always says  
Its sink or swim  
In these Titanic days  
  
So hot so hungry  
So faretheewell goodbye  
I got so angry  
Now I sit here and sigh  
My love always  
We should rejoice in these Titanic days  
  
Dream on he says  
Dream on he says  
Will I be saved  
Will I be saved  
Dream on he says  
Dream on he says  
Do you ever get that sinking feeling
