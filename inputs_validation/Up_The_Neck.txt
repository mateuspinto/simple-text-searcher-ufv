Anger and lust my senses running amok  
Bewildered and deluded have I been hit by a truck  
When my tongue lay inside his lip  
Felt like the time in the womb  
But I woke up with a headache that split my skull  
Alone in the room  
  
I got down on the floor with my head pressed between my knees  
Under the bed with my teeth sunk into my own flesh  
I said baby oh sweetheart  
  
Lust turns to anger a kiss to a slug  
Something was sticky on your shag rug look at the tile  
I remember the way he groaned and moved with an animal skill  
I rubbed my face in the sweat that ran down his chest  
It was all very run of the mill  
But I noticed his scent started to change somehow  
His face went berserk and the veins bulged on his brow  
I said baby oh sweetheart  
  
Bondage to lust abuse of facility  
Blackmailed emotions confuse the demon and devotee  
I was sure his intentions were sweet  
And that mine was as well  
But a wish is a shot in the dark  
When your coins down the well  
  
I got out in the hall with my teeth in my head  
Up to my neck and I said said said dead  
I said baby oh sweetheart
