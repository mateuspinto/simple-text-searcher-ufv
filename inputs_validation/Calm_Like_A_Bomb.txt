Feel the funk blast  
Feel the funk blast  
Feel the funk blast  
Feel the funk blast  
Feel the funk blast  
Yo yo yo yo yo yo check it out yo yo yo  
  
I be walkin god like a dog  
My narrative fearless  
My word war returns to burn  
Like Baldwin home from Paris  
Like Steel from a furnace  
I was born landless  
This is tha native son  
Born of Zapatas guns  
Stroll through tha shanties  
And tha cities remains  
Same bodies buried hungry  
But with different last names  
These vultures rob everything  
Leave nothing but chains  
Pick a point on tha globe  
Yes tha pictures tha same  
Theres a bank Theres a church a myth and a hearse  
A mall and a loan a child dead at birth  
Theres a widow pig parrot  
A rebel to tame  
A whitehooded judge  
A syringe and a vein  
  
And tha riot be tha rhyme of tha unheard  
what ya say what ya say what ya say what  
What ya say what ya say what ya say what  
What ya say what ya say what ya say what  
What ya say what ya say what ya say what  
  
Calm like a bomb  
Ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite  
Calm like a bomb  
Ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite  
  
This aint subliminal  
Feel tha critical mass approach horizon  
Tha pulse of tha condemned  
Sound off Americas demise  
Tha antimyth rhythm rock shocker  
Yes I spit fire  
Hope lies in tha smoldering rubble of empires  
Yes back through tha shanties and tha cities remains  
Tha same bodies buried hungry  
But with different last names  
These vultures rob everyone  
Leave nothing but chains  
Pick a point here at home  
Yes tha pictures tha same  
Theres a field full of slaves  
Some corn and some debt  
Theres a ditch full of bodies  
Tha check for tha rent  
Theres a tap tha phone tha silence of stone  
Tha numb black screen  
That be feelin like home  
  
And tha riot be tha rhyme of tha unheard  
What ya say what ya say what ya say what  
What ya say what ya say what ya say what  
What ya say what ya say what ya say what  
What ya say what ya say what ya say what  
  
Calm like a bomb  
Ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite  
Calm like a bomb  
Ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite  
Calm like a bomb  
Ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite  
Calm like a bomb  
Ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite  
  
Calm like a bomb  
Ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite  
Calm like a bomb  
Ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite  
Calm like a bomb  
Ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite  
Calm like a bomb  
Ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite ignite  
Calm Like a bomb  
  
Theres a mass without roofs  
Theres a prison to fill  
Theres a countrys soul that reads post no bills  
Theres a strike and a line of cops outside of tha mill  
Theres a right to obey  
And theres a right to kill  
Theres a mass without roofs  
Theres a prison to fill  
Theres a countrys soul that reads post no bills  
Theres a strike and a line of cops outside of tha mill  
Theres a right to obey  
And theres a right to kill
