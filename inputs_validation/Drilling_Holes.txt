A man came to drill holes in the afternoon  
And by the evening  
Most of the afternoon had gone  
  
I seem to have slept through the morning  
But in the afternoon  
A morning is yet to come  
  
A girl came to help out in the kitchen  
And by the evening  
We found we were all washed up  
  
We ate on the lawn  
With the insects  
We burned incense  
Most of the band turned up  
  
It was just one of those days  
When the mind strays  
One of those days  
When everyone plays  
One of those days  
When everyone stays  
And all of the dreaming goes on  
  
A woman arrived in a panic  
With a picnic  
Better to give than receive  
  
A man came to pick holes in the logic  
He wore plastic  
And shoes you would hardly believe  
  
The evening arrived  
Slightly early like a pygmy  
Chewing the wrong kind of leaves  
  
We ordered extra tea  
Listened to XTC  
Under a shady tree  
Went back to bed at three  
It was cool  
As can be  
two sugars for me  
  
It was just one of those days  
When the mind strays  
When everyone plays  
One of those days  
When everyone stays  
And all of the dreaming goes on  
One of THOSE days
