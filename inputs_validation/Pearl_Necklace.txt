Shes really upset with me again  
I didnt give her what she likes  
I dont know what to tell her  
Dont know what to say  
Everything got funky last night  
  
She was really bombed  
And I was really blown away  
Until I asked her what she wanted  
And this is what she had to say  
A pearl necklace  
She wanna pearl necklace  
She wanna pearl necklace  
  
She gets a charge out of bein so weird  
Digs gettin downright strange  
But I can keep a handle on anything  
Just this side of deranged  
  
She was gettin bombed  
And I was gettin blown away  
And she held it in her hand  
And this is what she had to say  
A pearl necklace  
She wanna pearl necklace  
She wanna pearl necklace  
  
She is so tough as pure as the driven slush  
And thats not true what shes talkin about  
It really dont cost that much  
  
She was gettin bombed  
And I was gettin blown away  
And she took it in her hand  
And this is what she had to say  
A pearl necklace  
She wanna pearl necklace  
She wanna pearl necklace
