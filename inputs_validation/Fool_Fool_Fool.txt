Fool fool fool  
That I was to fall for you  
Well fool fool fool  
That I was to fall for you  
Well I know what a fool I was  
To think that you could love me too  
  
Well well when I first met you baby  
Well I knew I couldnt win  
But I just kept right on trying  
Cause trying is no sin  
  
What a fool fool fool  
That I was to fall for you  
Well I know what a fool I was  
To think that you could love me too  
  
Well when I first met you baby
