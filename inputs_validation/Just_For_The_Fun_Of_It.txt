Just for the fun of it  
Just to be gay  
You made me care for you  
Then you went away  
I ask you was it fair when I was fancy free  
To make me fall for you then make a fool out of me  
  
Just for the fun of it  
Just for a thrill  
You said goodbye to love  
But I never will  
You may be sorry when were far apart  
Then just for the fun of it you broke my heart  
  
Just for the fun of it  
Just for a laugh  
You made goodbye to love my hearts epitaph  
You may be sorry when were far apart  
Then just for the fun of it you broke my heart
