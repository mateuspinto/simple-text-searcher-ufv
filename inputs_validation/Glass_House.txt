CHORUS  
If you live in a glasshouse  
Dont throw stones  
And if you cant take blows brother  
Dont throw blows  
Harm no man  
Let no man harm you  
Do unto others  
As they would do to you  
And to every baldhead  
Respect the Rastaman  
Cause hes the only man left on creation  
CHORUS  
cause cause to see I  
Looking so humble  
Would you like to try something  
But your world would a crumble  
Caught behind I back  
You lied to grumble  
And before I face  
You always a fumble  
CHORUS  
You build your world on lies and illusions  
But you never know that  
This is the conclusion  
No chance no hope for those  
Who kept it a goin  
Cause you never know that  
The truth is showing  
CHORUS  
Im on this earth  
To give Jah praise  
And all I ask for  
Is longer days  
I come to do the things that are right  
And if you dont like my do it were gonna fight  
CHORUS
