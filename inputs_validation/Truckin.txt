Truckin down the highway  
Get outta my way  
Always in a hurry  
Always in between  
Thats where you can find me  
Truckin down the highway  
Sittin in the cab of  
A ten ton machine  
Gettin pretty tired of stoppin  
In old run down cafes  
Some day Im gonna find me a woman  
Rich enough to pay my way  
Gonna make some inroads  
Drivin home a payload  
Truckin down the highway  
Like you never seen  
Gettin pretty tired of lookin  
In truck stop cabarets  
Some day Im gonna find me a woman  
Rich enough to pay my way  
Then youre gonna find me  
Truckin down the highway  
Sittin in the back seat  
Of a long limousine
