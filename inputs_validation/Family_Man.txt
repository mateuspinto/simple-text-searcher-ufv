Walk down this road  
When the road gets rough  
I fall down  
I get up  
I am what I am  
A family man  
I am what I am  
A family man  
Mother father brother  
Mother father brother  
Walk down this road  
In the cool of the night  
Dont know whats wrong  
But I do know whats right  
I am what I am  
A family man  
I am what I am  
A family man  
Mother father brother  
Mother father brother  
I am what I am  
A family man  
I am what I am  
A family man  
Mother father brother  
Mother father brother
