In the grand way she loves me  
The way she holds me close to rest with me  
And to know she is my life to me  
My empty days are done  
My running days are run  
And for the first time I love the morning  
  
Burning sundown coloured autumn trees  
Mountain rivers country livers put my mind at ease  
And to realize such perfect harmonies  
Im standing in the dawn  
Of a new day coming on  
And Im looking for no tomorrow  
  
I can still hear the lonely sound  
The engines of a midnight freight train northward bound  
And to feel my life slowly losing ground  
I never quite understood  
And it seems like Ive just seen dreaming
