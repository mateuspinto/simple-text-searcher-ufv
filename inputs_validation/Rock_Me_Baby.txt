Rock me baby rock me all night long  
I said I want you to  
Rock me baby rock me all night long  
I want you to rock me like my back aint got no bones  
  
Roll me daddy like you roll your flour dough  
Want you to  
Roll me daddy like you roll your flour dough  
I want you to roll me till I wont no more  
  
When you see me coming go get your rockin chair  
When you see me coming go get your rockin chair  
I want you to rock me rock me away from here  
  
Rock me baby rock me all night long  
I said I want you to  
Rock me baby rock me all night long  
I want you to rock me like my back aint got no bones  
  
Roll me daddy like you roll your flour dough  
I said I want you to  
Roll me daddy like you roll your flour dough  
I want you to roll me till I wont no more
