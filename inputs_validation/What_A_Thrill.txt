I dreamt last night that he held me tight  
In a bar we knew way back when   
Drinkin sloe gin  
Oh what a thrill  
Oh what a sin  
  
Oh then the band played Goodnight Sweetheart  
One more dance and we were ready to go  
From the spark heel boppin  
To the light of a steamed window  
  
Oh what a thrill  
Oh what a sin  
For a heart throb  
Too long gone to cry again  
  
With them smokefilled runaway kisses  
Some so young  
Chances are a million to one  
You got me startin to believe  
That the thrill aint never gone  
  
Then I woke up in the dark to a different sound  
That was coming from my radio  
They were playin somethin else  
sides Go Johnny Go Go Go  
  
So I turned to my sweetie said Roll over Honey  
Cause your mamas gonna show you some fun  
I said Roll over Honey cause  
The thrill aint never gone  
  
Oh what a thrill  
Oh what a sin  
For a heart throb  
Too long gone to cry again  
  
Those smokefilled runaway kisses  
Some so young  
Chances are a million to one  
You got me startin to believe  
That the thrill is never gone
