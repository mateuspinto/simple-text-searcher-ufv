Do you mean all the things you are  
Are you pleased with the way things are  
Wear that dress to protect this scar  
That only I have seen  
  
Do you give just to please yourself  
Do you wish you were somewhere else  
Justified all the things you tried  
Said that it was all for me  
  
And be near  
Just for the moment  
Stay here  
Never go home  
  
Did you know that everything she ever does is for you  
So it goes the story of a broken heart comes true  
It comes true  
  
Have you learned all the secrets yet  
Will you burn by the things Ive said  
Took the dive just to feel alive  
But never heard the truth  
  
Now Im in love but I dont know how  
Im in pain cause I want it now  
As I sit watching her eyes close  
I slowly open mine  
  
And be near  
Just for the moment  
Stay here  
Never go home  
  
Did you know that everything she ever does is for you  
So it goes the story of a broken heart comes true comes true  
  
I am so confused by this  
I know that life is hit or miss  
Days are stung by too much sun  
I think that you may be the one  
  
Cover yourself up in me  
Shrouded in what could have been  
I will listen to your pain  
If you listen to me  
  
Did you know that everything she ever does is for you  
So it goes as the story of a broken heart comes true  
Did you know that everything she ever does is for you  
And I know the story of a broken heart comes true  
Come true  
True  
It comes true  
True
