For all Ive been blessed with in this life  
There was an emptiness in me  
I was imprisoned by the power of gold  
With one honest touch you set me free  
  
Chorus  
Let the world stop turning  
Let the sun stop burning  
Let them tell me loves not worth going through  
If it all falls apart  
I will know deep in my heart  
The only dream that mattered had come true  
In this life I was loved by you  
  
For every mountain I have climbed  
And ever raging river crossed  
You were the treasure that I longed to find Without you love I would be lost  
  
Chorus
