Here I stand watching the tide go out  
So all alone and blue  
Just dreaming dreams of you  
  
I watched your ship as it sailed out to sea  
Taking all my dreams  
And taking all of me  
  
The sighing of the waves  
The wailing of the wind  
The tears in my eyes burn  
Pleading My love return  
  
Why oh why must I go on like this  
Shall I just be a lonely stranger on the shore  
  
The sighing of the waves  
The wailing of the wind  
The tears in my eyes burn  
Pleading My love return  
  
Why oh why must I go on like this  
Shall I just be a lonely stranger on the shore
