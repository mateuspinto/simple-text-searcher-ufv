Wake Me  
Shake me  
Come on take me  
To a Higher Plane  
Make the music and the rhythm  
Carry me away  
  
I want to be with you  
I want to be free  
I want to be connected to everyone I see  
Ohh Ooo everyone moving with the same emotion  
Ohh Ooo and he looks just like a silent word being spoken  
  
Wake Me  
Shake me  
Come on take me  
To a Higher Plane  
Make the music and the rhythm  
Carry me away  
  
Rhythm is my spirit  
Rhythm is my speech  
Rhythm is pulsating  
The rhythm of the street  
Ahh Ooo to find myself in the still of the thunder  
Ahh Ooo til another moment passing by pulls me under pulls me under  
  
Wake me  
Shake me  
Come on take me  
To a Higher Plane  
Make the music and the rhythm  
Carry me away  
  
I want to be with you  
  
Ohhhhhhh Yeah  
  
Wake me  
Shake me  
Come on take me  
To a Higher Plane  
Make the music and the rhythm  
Carry me away  
  
I want to be with you  
I want to be free  
I want to be connected from my heart to be beat  
Beam myself in the light against the darkness  
Til your love descends and smoothes away all the harshness all the harshness  
  
Wake me  
Shake me  
Come on take me  
To a Higher Plane  
  
Make the music and the rhythm  
Carry me away  
  
Wake me  
Shake me  
Come on take me  
To a Higher Plane  
  
Make the music and the rhythm  
Carry me awayayayayay
