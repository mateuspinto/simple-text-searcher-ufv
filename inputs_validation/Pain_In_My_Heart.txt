Pain in my heart  
Is treating me cold  
Where can my baby be  
Lord no one knows  
  
Pain in my heart  
Just wont let me sleep  
Where can my baby be  
Lord where can she be  
  
And now the days  
Has begin to get tough  
I say I want you to come back come back  
Come back baby

Oh  
  
A little pain in my heart  
Just wont let me be  
Wake up restless nights  
Lord and I cant even sleep  
  
Mmm mmm yeah  
Stop this little pain in my heart  
  
And now the days  
Has begin to get rough  
I said I want you to love me love me  
Love me baby till I get enough  
  
Oh  
  
Pain in my heart  
Little pain in my heart  
Stop this little pain in my heart  
Stop this little pain in my heart  
  
Someone stop this pain
