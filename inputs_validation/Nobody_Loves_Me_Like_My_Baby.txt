Aint nobody loves me like my baby  
No body can make me feel the way I feel  
Aint nobody loves me like my baby  
I know my baby love for me is real  
  
When Im down she brings me round  
She takes me where I need to be  
  
Aint nobody loves me like my baby  
Nobody can put that smile back on my face  
  
Aint nobody loves me like my baby  
My babys love cant be replaced
