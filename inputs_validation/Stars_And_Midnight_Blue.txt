Memories we share together moments no one else can know  
I will keep them close to me never let them go  
  
Once you filled my hands with rosesthen you gave your heart to me  
When a kiss had followed this Love was meant to be  
  
Time goes by and the snow is drifting slowly in the sky cold cold night  
As you lie beside me I can hear your heartbeat  
  
You have lost yourself in dreaming I have lost myself in you  
Now we lie beneath the sky stars and midnight blue
