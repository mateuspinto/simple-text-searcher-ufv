Thorn in my side  
And you live just to pull me down  
Rusted nail I stepped on  
This infection  
  
Thorn in my side  
Youre full  
I think so  
of anger  
You need to sit down  
stay down  
  
The things you want but dont get  
Is that fair I dont think so  
A sure thing you can count on  
A big depression  
  
A thorn in my side  
Youre full  
I think so  
of anger  
You need to  
  
Your praise is two faced  
And youre  
youre cut down  
my friend  
Cut Down  
  
A thorn in my side thorn in  
A thorn in my side thorn in
