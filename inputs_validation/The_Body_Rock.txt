Since Mase refuse to lose we makes numeral moves  
Cause Im smoother than them dudes and them two thousand dollar shoes  
When I move to new Jerus cause I like the cruise  
And my six doubleo blast weed love the dough

Smoke my la la out in la whos ready  
Juice heavy back in blue Chevy  
See angealan they winnin a nigga need the chedda  
Cause Im more in a broad way  
With all As and platinum

Never had in finance so I never had to deduct shit 1 8  
And every week I have to reup  
So what so what  
  
Busta Rhymes  
Aiyyo check out the way me and my niggas always be whippin shit  
The way that I display no flavor and do it so intricate  
Pidda and padda padda and pidda over with the shit  
You you you you you oh yall niggaz be yappin to make me sick of it  
Hit you wit shit that yall niggaz never ever forget  
Fuckin wit my niggaz just like you playin russian roulette

Tryin to alter our lavage liven niggaz yall turn savage
