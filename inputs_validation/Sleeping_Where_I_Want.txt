This is my favorite disease  
I am sleeping in his dreams  
And the TV is on  
It is seeping into me  
It is guiding my dreams  
It is only three  
So its jeopardy  
You can go and burst my tiny bubble  
Blow me off without a care  
But I am sleeping where I want to  
This is my favorite time  
I can sleep until the phone rings  
And I doubt that it will  
You can go and burst my tiny bubble  
Blow me off without a care  
But I am sleeping where I want to
