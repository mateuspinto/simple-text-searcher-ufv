I thought I saw him on the video  
A trance is keeping him under  
I know that god is in the radio  
Checkin the station  
Im glad I caught it from me to you  
Just a call in the medium  
I know you hear it I hear it too  
Its everywhere that I go  
  
You come back another day  
And do no wrong  
You come back another day  
And do no wrong  
You come back another day  
And do no wrong  
You come back another day  
And do no wrong  
  
The say the devil is paranoid  
Always signin the cover  
But god is leakin through the stereo  
Between the station to station  
You believe it I know you do  
You wont admit it or say so  
I know that god is in the radio  
Just repeating a slogan  
  
You come back another day  
And do no wrong  
You come back another day  
And do no wrong  
You come back another day  
And do no wrong  
You come back another day  
And do no wrong
