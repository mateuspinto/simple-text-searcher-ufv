Been out all night I needed a bite I thought Id put a record on  
I reached for the one with the ultramodern label and wondered where the
light had gone  
It had a futuristic cover lifted straight from buck rogers  
The record was so black it had to be a con  
The autochanger switched as I filled my sandwich  
And futuristic sounds warbled off and on  
  
The black hit of space  
Its the one without a face  
Its the one that doesnt fit  
You can only see the flip  
The black hit of space  
Sucking in the human race  
How can it stay at the top  
When its swallowed all the shops  
  
As the song climbed the charts the others disappeared  
Til there was nothing but it left to buy  
It got to number one then into minus figures  
Though nobody could understand why  
  
The black hit of space  
Its the one without a face  
Its the one that doesnt fit  
You can only see the flip  
The black hit of space  
Sucking in the human race  
How can it stay at the top  
When its swallowed all the shops  
  
I couldnt stand this bland sound any more so I walked towards my deck to turn
it off  
All I could see was the bside of the disc  
Which had assumed a doughnut shape with the label on the outside rim  
I reached for the arm which was less than one micron long  
But weighed more than Saturn and time stood still  
I knew I had to escape but every time I tried to flee the record was in front
of me  
  
The black hit of space  
Get James Burke on the case  
Its the hit thats never gone  
Time stops when you put it on
