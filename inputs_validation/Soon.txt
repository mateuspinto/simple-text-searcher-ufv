Soon oh soon the light  
Pass within and soothe the endless night  
And wait here for you  
Our reason to be here  
  
Soon oh soon the time  
All we move to gain will reach and calm  
Our heart is open  
Our reason to be here  
  
Long ago set into rhyme  
  
Soon oh soon the light  
Ours to shape for all time ours the right  
The sun will lead us  
Our reason to be here  
The sun will lead us  
Our reason to be here
