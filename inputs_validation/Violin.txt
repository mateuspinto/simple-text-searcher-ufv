Four strings across the bridge  
Ready to carry me over  
Over the quavers drunk in the bars  
Out of the realm of the orchestra  
Out of the realm of the orchestra  
  
Filling me up with the shivers  
Filling me up with the shivers and quivers  
Filling me up with the shivers  
  
Get the bow going  
Let it scream to me  
Violin Violin Violin  
  
Get the bow going  
Let it scream to me  
Violin Violin Violin  
  
Paganini up on the chimney  
Lord of the dance  
With Nero and old Nicky  
Whack that devil  
Into my fiddlestick  
Give me the Banshees for BVs  
Give me the Banshees for BVs  
  
Jigging along with the fiddle oh Johnny  
Jigging along with the fiddledeedee  
Jigging along with the fiddle oh Johnny  
Jigging along with the fiddledeediddledeedee  
  
Repeat x4  
Get the bow going  
Let it scream to me  
Violin Violin Violin
