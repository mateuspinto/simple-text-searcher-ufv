I get these killer headaches  
I get one everyday  
I wake up with a migraine  
Since you ran away  
  
Got a load of tension  
Burnin up my neck  
Something is wrong with my suspension  
So pass those tablets to this wreck  
  
Aspirin damage  Aspirin damage  
Kills the pain  destroys the brain  
No one told me bout Aspirin damage  
Sometimes I find myself shakin  
Rom the medication taken  
Oh yeah  
  
I balance my Excedrin  
And Anacins in stacks  
Im a pain reliever junkie  
I got a Bayer on my back  
  
I went to see the doctor  
He walked me down the hall  
Said Strip down til youre naked  
Your suit your tie and all  
  
Aspirin damage  Aspirin damage  
Kills the pain  destroys the brain  
Aspirin damage my disadvantage  
Sometimes I find myself shakin  
From the medication taken  
Oh yeah  
  
Aspirin damage  Aspirin damage  
Kills the pain  destroys the brain  
Aspirin damage my disadvantage  
Sometimes I find myself shakin  
From the medication taken  
Oh yeah
