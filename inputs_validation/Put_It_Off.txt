I wrote unfriendly things truly cruel  
On the day that you were born to prove that words cannot touch beauty but I
was torn  
I put it off I put it off I put it off again  
  
I made degenerate art for the religious right on the day that you were born  
I had a passion to experiment but I was torn I put it off  
I put it off I put it off again  
  
I played love tara by erics trip on the day that you were born  
I had to find the cuteness in the unadorned but I was torn I put it off  
I put it off I put it off again I put it on I put it on I put it on again
