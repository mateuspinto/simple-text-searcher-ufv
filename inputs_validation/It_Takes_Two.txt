One can have a dream baby  
Two can make a dream so real  
One can talk about being in love  
Two can see how it really feels  
  
One can wish upon a star  
Two can make a wish come true yeah  
One can stand alone in the dark  
Two can make a light shine through  
  
It takes two baby

just me and you  
You know it takes two  
  
One can have a broken heart  
living in misery  
Two can really ease the pain  
like a perfect remedy  
One can be alone in a bar  
like an island hes all alone  
Two can make just any place  
seem just like bein at home

One can go out to a movie  
looking for a special treat  
Two can make that single movie  
something really kind of sweet  
And one can take a walk in the moonlight  
thinking thats its really nice  
But two lovers walking hand in hand  
is like adding just a pinch of spice  
  
It takes two baby
