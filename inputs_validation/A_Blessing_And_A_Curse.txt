I forget what happens on the fourth of July  
Or when the rent is due  
Dates and deadlines just float by  
But I always remember you  
  
What Colombus set out to discover  
Isabelle already knew  
Therell be horizons and skylines and other lovers  
But I always remember you  
  
If I could rearrange history  
And give it to you as a gift  
There would be one more movement  
In beethovens fifth  
  
Why oh why in a land of plenty  
Some just have to make due  
At the end of a breadline with just a penny  
Ill always remember you
