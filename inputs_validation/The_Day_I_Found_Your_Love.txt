When I was a stranger to you in the night  
And the feeling tells you out of sympathy  
To open up your wings turn your head to the sky  
Take off like a bird let your heart be free  
I found deep feeling devotion  
The day that I found your love  
I can see above the diamondstudded sky  
Hear the sound of night life passing by  
Scent the early morning with every breath of air  
Taste the secret potion that we both share  
I found deep feeling devotion  
The day I found your love
