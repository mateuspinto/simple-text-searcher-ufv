Upon the Bitter Green she walked the hills above the town  
Echoed to her footsteps as soft as eiderdown  
Waiting for her master to kiss away her tears  
Waiting through the years  
  
Chorus  
Bitter Green they called her walking in the sun  
Loving everyone that she met  
Bitter Green they called her waiting in the sun  
Waiting for someone to take her home  
  
Some say he was a sailor who died away at sea  
Some say he was a prisoner who never was set free  
Lost upon the ocean he died there in the mist  
Dreaming of a kiss  
  
Chorus  
  
But now the Bitter Green is gone the hills have turned to rust  
There comes a weary stranger whose tears fall in the dust  
Kneeling by the churchyard in the autumn mist  
Dreaming of a kiss  
  
Chorus
