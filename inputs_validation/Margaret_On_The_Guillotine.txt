The kind people  
Have a wonderful dream  
Margaret on the guillotine  
Cause people like you  
Make me feel so tired  
When will you die  
When will you die  
When will you die  
When will you die  
When will you die  
  
And people like you  
Make me feel so old inside  
Please die  
  
And kind people  
Do not shelter this dream  
Make it real  
Make the dream real  
Make the dream real  
Make it real  
Make the dream real  
Make it real
