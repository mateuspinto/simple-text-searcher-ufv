Oh Ho Ho  
  
When we kiss pretty miss pretty miss Im in ecstasy  
Caterina  
Oh Ho Ho Ho Ho  
  
But when we kiss pretty miss pretty miss are you thinking of me  
Caterina  
Ah Ha Ha  
Just how long is the list is the list of the lips youve kissed  
  
Oh how happy my heart would be  
If I knew that you loved just me  
Say its true  
Say you do
