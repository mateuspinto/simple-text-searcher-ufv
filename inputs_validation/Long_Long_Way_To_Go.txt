You held my hand and then you slipped away  
And I may never see your face again  
So tell me how to fill the emptiness inside  
Without love what is life  
And anyone who knew us both can see  
We always were the better part of me  
I never wanted to be this free  
And all this pain when does it go away  
  
Then every time I turn around  
And youre nowhere to be found  
I know  
  
I gotta long long way to go  
Before I can say goodbye to you  
Oh I gotta long long way I know  
Before I can say goodbye  
To all I ever knew to you  
To you  
  
From memory there is no hiding place  
Turn on the TV and I see you there  
In every crowd theres always someone with your face  
Everywhere trying not to care  
  
Then every time I turn around  
And youre nowhere to be found  
I know  
  
I gotta long long way to go  
Before I can say goodbye to you  
I gotta long long way I know  
Before I can say goodbye  
To all I ever knew  
  
To you I wish you everything  
And all the best that life can bring  
I only hope you think of me sometimes  
Oh and even though I feel the pain  
I know that I will love again  
The time will come  
Oh and Ill move on  
  
I gotta long long way to go  
Before I can say goodbye to you  
Oh I gotta long long way I know  
Gotta long way to go  
Before I can say goodbye  
Before I say goodbye  
To all I ever knew  
To all I ever knew  
I gotta long way to go  
Before I say  
Say goodbye say goodbye  
But I wish you the best girl  
Oh and all of the rest to you
