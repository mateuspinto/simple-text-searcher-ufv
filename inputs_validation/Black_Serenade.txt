Terrorize frozen eyes stare deep in me  
Paralyzed inside death breeds on your pain  
Pretty lace lie in hate you wear my scars  
Terrified you find that you push me too far  
Your repulsiveness reminds me of dead flesh  
Rotting corpse the smell of your putrid fucking soul  
  
Petrified that I decide the moment of your death  
Belongs to me the taste is sweet its so unreal  
  
Your God weeps it bleeds it begs for me  
God is letting you recover  
  
Welcome to my Black Serenade  
The entrance to my hell your pain  
Scream your Song the Black Serenade  
Live in fear a mind insane  
  
Voice inside my head  
Your face still shows itself to me  
Telling me youre dead  
Staring at your lifeless body  
I saw you fucking die  
My minds tearing itself apart  
Screaming from the inside  
Release this pain from my fucking heart  
  
Destroy the empty shell  
Smash away the haunting fear  
I hate your endless stare  
Watching as I fuck your corpse  
  
Welcome to my Black Serenade  
The entrance to my hell your pain  
Walk on through a tortured mind  
Youll scream your song in time  
  
Welcome to my Black Serenade  
The entrance to my hell your pain  
Flesh is burnt the Black Serenade  
  
Live in fear no coming back  
  
Welcome to my Black Serenade  
The entrance to my hell your pain  
Walk on through a tortured mind  
Youll scream your song in time  
  
Welcome to my Black Serenade  
The entrance to my hell your pain  
Flesh is burnt the Black Serenade  
Live in fear death is back
