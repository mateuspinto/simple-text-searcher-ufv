You lead me by the waters still  
You lay me down to rest upon your faithfulness  
My Shepherd simply take my hand  
Your song restores my soul  
For Your name You make me whole  
Joyfully I lift my voice in praise to Thee  
With heaven watching over me I raise my hands up high  
Your Majesty gently washes over me  
Makes my heart begin to sing joyfully  
No shadow ever shall I fear  
Your peace my heart will know  
My cup it overflows  
Your goodness chases after me  
Your mercy and Your grace will be my dwelling place  
Joyfully I lift my voice in praise to Thee  
With heaven watching over me I raise my hands up high  
Your Majesty gently washes over me  
Makes my heart begin to sing joyfully  
I will sing from the mountain top  
I will sing I am overcome I will sing making melodies  
I will sing from the valley low  
I will sing because of Your love I will sing  
Youre my King I will sing  
Joyfully I lift my voice in praise to Thee  
With heaven watching over me I raise my hands up high  
Your Majesty gently washes over me  
Makes my heart begin to sing joyfully  
Joyfully joyfully joyfully
