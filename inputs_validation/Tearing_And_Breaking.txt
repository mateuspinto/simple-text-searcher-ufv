Tearing and breaking down  
Tearing my heart  
Tearing and breaking down  
Tearing my heart  
  
Tearing and breaking down  
Tearing my heart  
There goes my heart again  
Tearing and breaking down  
Tearing my heart  
Watch my heart fly away  
  
All the love that I have ever known  
Came from the sweetest of hearts  
Every time I was looking for love  
I found it in you  
  
Tearing and breaking down  
Tearing my heart  
There goes my heart again  
Tearing and breaking down  
Tearing my heart  
Watch my heart fly away  
  
All the tears you found in your eyes  
I know that they were mine  
All the love you were trying to disguise  
I never could desert  
  
Tearing and breaking down  
Tearing my heart  
There goes my heart again  
Tearing and breaking down  
Tearing my heart  
Watch my heart fly away  
  
Saw that look in the eyes and I felt so sorry for myself  
I couldve cried  
Heard you saying goodbye and you know it felt so strange  
Cause I know wed tried  
  
With all the tearing and breaking down  
Tearing my heart  
There goes my heart again  
Tearing and breaking down  
Tearing my heart  
I can watch it fly away  
  
Tearing and breaking down  
Tearing my heart  
All the tearing and breaking down  
Tearing my heart  
There goes my heart again  
  
Tearing and breaking down  
Tearing my heart  
Tearing and breaking down  
Tearing my heart  
Watch my heart fly away fly away fly again  
  
Tearing and breaking down  
Tearing my heart
