When I was just a boy  
My daddy sat me on his knee  
He told me that he loved  
Me and that were a family  
  
He spoke about the world  
And all the possibilities  
Then he held me in his arms  
And said be what you want to be  
  
He paved the way for me to follow  
Uncharted terrain now had a name  
Its how I got over  
  
When I became a man  
My daddy said come walk with me  
He said beeing a man  
Comes with responsibility  
  
And all is keep your word  
To the best of your ability  
Then he looked me in my eyes  
And said its time to set you free  
  
He paved the way for me to follow  
Uncharted terrain now had a name  
Its how I got over  
  
He paved the way for me to follow  
Uncharted terrain now had a name  
Its how I got over  
  
He paved the way for me to follow  
Uncharted terrain now had a name  
Its how I got over
