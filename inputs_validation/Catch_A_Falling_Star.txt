Chorus  
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket  
Never let it fade away  
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket  
Save it for a rainy day  
  
For love may come and tap you on the shoulder some starless night  
Just in case you feel you want to hold her  
Youll have a pocketful of starlight  
  
Chorus  
  
For love may come and tap you on the shoulder some starless night  
Just in case you feel you want to hold her  
Youll have a pocketful of starlight  
Pocketful of starlight hmhmhmhmhmhm  
  
Chorus  
  
Save it for a rainy save it for a rainy rainy rainy day  
  
For when your troubles start multiplyin and they just might  
Its easy to forget them without tryin  
With just a pocketful of starlight  
  
Chorus  
  
Save it for a rainy day  
Save it for a rainy day
