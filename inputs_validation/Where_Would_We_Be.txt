You came to search and rescue  
In love the Father sent You  
Broke through the darkest night  
You came to seek and save us  
You came to liberate us  
Jesus You heard our cry  
Jesus You heard our cry  
  
Where would we be without Your love  
Wed still be lost in darkness  
Where would we be without Your cross  
You made a way to save us  
O Your love O Your love  
  
You are the hope eternal  
You are the light of this world  
Jesus our rescuer  
We live our lives to thank You  
How could we not adore You  
Jesus our rescuer  
Jesus our rescuer  
  
Where would we be without Your love  
Wed still be lost in darkness  
Where would we be without Your cross  
You made a way to save us  
O Your love O Your love  
  
Were safe in the arms of Your embrace  
Breathing in Your freedom  
Lifting a song of highest praise  
And breathing out Your anthem  
O Your love O Your love  
Sing it  
O Your love O Your love  
  
We couldnt escape  
The sin and the shame  
That kept us bound  
We couldnt break through  
We couldnt reach You  
So You reached down  
  
Where would we be without Your love  
Wed still be lost in darkness  
Where would we be without Your cross  
You made a way to save us  
O Your love O Your love  
  
Were safe in the arms of Your embrace  
Breathing in Your freedom  
Lifting a song of highest praise  
And breathing out Your anthem  
O Your love O Your love  
Sing it  
O Your love O Your love  
  
O Your love O Your love  
Sing it  
O Your love O Your love  
We keep on singing  
O Your love O Your love  
Sing it  
O Your love O Your love  
  
Jesus Youre the only hope  
Jesus hope for all the world  
Jesus Youre the only hope  
Jesus hope for all the world  
Jesus Youre the only hope  
There is no other way  
Jesus hope for all the world  
Jesus Youre the only hope  
Jesus hope for all the world
