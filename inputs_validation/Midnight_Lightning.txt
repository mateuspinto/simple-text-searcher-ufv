Midnight lightning  
Flashing all around me  
Lord see it flashin all around the trees  
See it flashin on my love and me  
Wake up my sweet darlin  
And see the light upon your eyes  
Blue light flashin  
Shadows leapin church bells ring made against the night  
Hey my love please stand up and watch me  
Midnight lightning flashin  
Flashin all around my country house  
Thunder flashin  
See where the fields lie on our tree in our little dream
