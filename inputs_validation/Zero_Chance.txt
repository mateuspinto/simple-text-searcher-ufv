I think I know the answer  
I stumbled on and all the world fell down  
And all the sky went silent  
Cracked like glass and slowly  
Tumbled to the ground  
They all say if you look hard  
Youll find your way back home  
Born without a friend  
And bound to die alone  
  
Im thinking of your highness  
And crying long upon the loss  
Ive found  
And on the plus and minus  
zero chance of ever  
Turning this around  
  
Why doesnt anyone believe  
In loneliness  
Stand up and everyone will see  
Your holiness  
  
They say if you look hard  
Youll find your way back home  
Born without a friend  
And bound to die alone
