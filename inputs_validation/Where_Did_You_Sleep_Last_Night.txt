My girl my girl dont lie to me  
Tell me where did you sleep last night  
  
In the pines in the pines  
Where the sun dont ever shine  
I would shiver the whole night through  
  
My girl my girl where will you go  
Im going where the cold wind blows  
  
In the pines in the pines  
Where the sun dont ever shine  
I would shiver the whole night through  
  
Her husband was a hard working man  
Just about a mile from here  
His head was found in a driving wheel  
But his body never was found  
  
My girl my girl dont lie to me  
Tell me where did you sleep last night  
  
In the pines in the pines  
Where the sun dont ever shine  
I would shiver the whole night through  
  
My girl my girl where will you go  
Im going where the cold wind blows  
  
In the pines in the pines  
Where the sun dont ever shine  
I would shiver the whole night through  
  
My girl my girl dont lie to me  
Tell me where did you sleep last night  
  
In the pines in the pines  
Where the sun dont ever shine  
I would shiver the whole night through  
  
My girl my girl where will you go  
Im going where the cold wind blows  
  
In the pines in the pines  
Where the sun dont ever shine  
I would shiver the whole night through
