It eats your soul like tears you fall my slave  
You steal you heed the call my slave  
The keys the keys are gone my slave  
You keep me beating on  
  
It eats your soul like tears you fall my slave  
You steal you heed the call my slave  
You keep me you keep me your slave  
You keep me you keep me your slave  
  
On my own  
You keep me you keep me  
On the throne  
Heads down all day  
On my own  
You keep me you keep me  
On the throne  
Heads down all day  
  
You keep me you keep me your slave  
You keep me you keep me your slave  
  
Come feed on your love  
Come feed on your love  
Come feed on your love  
Come feed on your love
