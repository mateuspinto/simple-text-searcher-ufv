Catalogue princess apprentice seductress  
Hiding in her cellophane world in glitter town  
Awaiting the prince in his white Capri  
Dynamic young Tarzan courts the bedsit queen  
Shes playing the actress in this bedroom scene  
Shes learning her lines from glossy magazines  
Stringing all her pearls from her childhood dreams  
Auditioning for the leading role on the silver screen  
Patience my tinsel angel  
Patience my perfumed child  
One day they really love you  
Youll charm them with that smile  
But for now its just another Chelsea Monday  
Drifting with her incense in the labyrinth of London  
Playing games with faces in the neon wonderland  
Perform to scattered shadows on the shattered cobbled aisles  
Would she dare recite soliloquies at the risk of stark applause  
Shell pray for endless Sundays as she enters saffron sunsets  
Conjure phantom lovers from the tattered shreds of dawn  
Fulfilled and yet forgotten the St Tropez mirage  
Fragrant aphrodisiac the withered tuberose  
Patience my tinsel angel patience my perfumed child  
One day they really love you youll charm them with that smile  
But for now its just another Chelsea Monday  
Hello John did you see The Standard about four hours ago  
Fished a young chick out of The Old Father  
Blond hair blue eyes She said she wanted to be an actress or something  
Nobody knows where she came from where she was going  
Funny thing was she had a smile on her face  
She was smiling what a waste
