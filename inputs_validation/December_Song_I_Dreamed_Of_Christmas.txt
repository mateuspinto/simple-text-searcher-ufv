Merry Christmas Merry Christmas  
May your every New Year dream come  
  
Sweet December song  
The melody that saved me  
On those less than Silent Nights  
When snow would fall upon my bed  
Like sugar from Jesus  
And take me to the day  
She could always smile  
The Virgin Child would always show you see  
Just to save me Just to save me  
There was always Christmas time  
To wipe the year away  
I guess that Mum and Dad decided  
That the world would have to wait  
  
There was always Christmas time  
Jesus came to stay  
I could believe in peace on Earth  
And I could watch TV all day  
So I dreamed of Christmas  
  
Maybe since youve gone  
I went a little crazy  
God knows they can see the child  
  
But the snow that falls upon my bed  
That loving I needed  
Falls every single day  
For each and every child  
The Virgin smiles for all to see  
But you kept her from me  
  
There was always Christmas time  
To wipe the year away  
I guess that Mum and Dad decided  
That the world would have to wait  
  
There was always Christmas time  
Jesus came to stay  
I could believe in peace on Earth  
And I could watch TV all day  
And so I dreamed of Christmas  
Yes I dreamed like you  
  
Merry Christmas Merry Christmas  
May your every New Year dream come true
