Any time now Im gonna wake up and see the day  
Any time now Im gonna wake up and find my way  
And by that time now youre gonna never ever never ever hear  
Me say That was the longest damn day  
  
Do you ever truly feel that its a waste of time  
To live a day  
I mean deep inside have you convinced yourself theres much  
More to get out of the way  
But for me its that last baby moment before I wake  
It bless my soul caress my heart leave me  
Wishing for a brighter day  
  
Any time now Im gonna wake up and see the day  
Any time now Im gonna wake up and find my way  
And by that time now youre gonna never ever never ever hear me  
Say That was the longest damn day  
  
Do you ever truly dream and stay inside them  
Before you wake  
I mean deep inside can you relax the mind  
And grab the minute like the last one to save  
Well for me its that last baby moment before I rise  
It fills me with wonder it bless my soul catch the dream before I open my
eyes  
  
Any time now Im gonna wake up and see the day  
Any time now Im gonna wake up and find my way  
And by that time now youre gonna never ever never ever heard me say  
That was the longest damn day  
  
One two three more days will never be enough for me  
One two three more lifetimes will bless my soul for my eyes can see  
That I can wake up if I want to  
But Ill just stay inside my mind  
One two three more days will never be enough for me  
One two three more lifetimes will bless my mind for my soul is free  
  
Any time now Im gonna wake up and see the day  
Any time now Im gonna wake up and find my way
