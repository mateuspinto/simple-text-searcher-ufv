Im the realest nigga in here you already know  
Got trapper of the year four times in a row what they give you  
A lifetime supply of baking soda clientele  
A Rolly Watch two pots and three scales  
Can get bout 50 and a Hummer  
The birds fly down south to Georgia for the summer  
Money hoes cars clothes  
Coke prices up and down like sixfours  
Just cause Im fly like a helicopter  
The fed rallies on my tail call em bird watchers  
Minus the bullshit lifes great  
Just got a camera in the peach in my license plate  
  
Chorus  
What it do What the business is  
Word on the street Jeezy known to handle his  
Bitch getcha mind right let me talk to em  
Bitch getcha mind right let me talk to em  
What it do What the business is  
Word on the street Jeezy known to handle his  
Bitch getcha mind right let me talk to em

Also ripped nigga miss me wit that rap shit  
Rappin ass nigga better do numbers

A big shoot out on the highway  
Jeezy hangin out the coupe lettin it ride sideways  
A straight g nigga dont tempt me  
Ill linger the whole clip til the shits empty  
Big stacks yeah I got that  
Thats why I copped that cris by the six packs  
Got the feds lines ringin let a telephone  
Snitches want me locked up like Akon  
  
Chorus  
  
Jeezy a rider Jeezy a motherfuckin fool  
Dont approach him like that you and Jeezy aint cool  
Jeezy a gangsta he rolls wit the real gs  
And if hes smokin best believe its real trees  
From LA Straight cush  
Presidential shit call it George bush  
Everyday is like a game call it fear factor  
Gotta trunk full of bricks like a contractor  
Seen niggaz leave here and they aint comin back  
Left em slumped on the grain in his Cadillac  
Jimmy crack horn Jeezy flip Os  
I just stick to the script yall niggaz hoes
