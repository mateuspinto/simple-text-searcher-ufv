Mos Def  
Dont look down its an impossible view  
Fly like an eagle whatever you do  
Dont look down its an impossible view  
Spread your wings aerial  
  
Lupe Fiasco  
Head to the sky wings raised in  
Shes about to fly and take her place in  
Out there in the stars when she leaves the ground  
Shell see a broken heart if she turns around  
But aint no going back this is how it must be  
He told her shell be burned alive  
She just told him trust me  
If funerals are beautiful this ugly  
Knowing she told her youll leave me if you loved me  
And he knows that because he knows her  
Hard to hide his feelings as it engulfs her  
Now shes a bright blaze light rays  
A shooting out Phoenix on fire buring up the night scape  
So lets hear it for our heroine applaud as our spirits fly into the never end  
One closed chapter it opens up another part  
So this is more like the end question mark question mark question mark

Kanye West  
Dont let me hold you back  
I only hold you back  
We on a deadend street this block has got a culdesac  
So fly baby my baby so high sometimes its so hard to say bye  
We made it from the alley straight up to ballet  
We pulled up to the valet well teach our daughter ballet  
Well raise us a Beyonce maybe shell be a Halle  
You woulda been the best mom  
I would have been the best Ye  
You see it all in my veins like varicose  
I know thats very gross but we getting very close  
To our end though I killed most with a pen  
Soon as this flow end Ima let Mos begin

Big Sean  
Okay now baby here we go we go  
No baby me go  
You got my heart  
Baby this what it be for  
I give it all as far as my feet go  
What do you mean me go  
Why cant it be we go  
What happens when people turn to tears  
Dreams turn to memories  
And weeks turn to years  
Huh Standing in the same spot for a couple of weeks  
Give me my feelings back wish it came with a couple reciepts  
Man our vacation was coming next week  
Girl I swear you was a trip lets make it a couples retreat do it  
How cud my girl do this to me  
Woke up sayin no the World did this to me  
Now Im testing one two  
Reportin live from the rubble  
Drinking all I can so I can turn to fire when I hug you  
One two three four five models on the double  
Give me head all at once look like they line in a huddle  
But its not even half the feeling as hearing you shine  
She know I love ya shedding tears everyday  
And Im tired of lying in these puddles  
I ask Y sometimes like a fcking vowel  
But hitting trees everyday like a fcking owl  
Trying to get high enough to cut the clouds  
Caught the Phoenix Sun to Nash it out I mean ash it out  
So I could see you smile  
  
II know you can see me now
