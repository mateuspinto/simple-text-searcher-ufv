There was a time when Id believe in anything but you  
I closed my eyes and let You in  
Ready to let my life begin  
It just hit me couldnt ignore it  
Heard your voice calling now I know it  
  
Chorus  
I wanna see Your face  
I wanna speak Your name  
I wanna tell the whole world how my life has changed  
Im gonna lift my voice  
Ever to sing Your praise  
As long as Im alive know that I  
Im living for You  
  
Lord here I stand before You now  
I want to give You everything  
No matter what may come my way  
You give me a smile they cant take away  
Holding onto all You brought me though  
Youre the strength that Ill always cling to  
  
Chorus  
  
Some may question what is right  
In my heart I cant deny  
Once I was blind but now I see  
You have my soul and I am Your for eternity  
  
Oh Lord I wanna see Your face  
I always wanna sing Your praise  
I wanna be the first to say  
Forever Im living for only You  
  
Chorus x2
