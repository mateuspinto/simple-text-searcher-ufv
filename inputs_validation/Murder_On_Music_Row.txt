Nobody saw him running from sixteenth avenue  
They never found the fingerprint or the weapon that was used  
But someone killed country music cut out its heart and soul  
They got away with murder down on music row  
  
The almighty dollar and the lust for worldwide fame  
Slowly killed tradition and for that someone should hang  
oh you tell them Alan  
They all say not guilty but the evidence will show  
That murder was committed down on music row  
  
For the steel guitars no longer cry and fiddles barely play  
But drums and rock n roll guitars are mixed up in your face  
Old Hank wouldnt have a chance on todays radio  
Since they committed murder down on music row  
  
They thought no one would miss it once it was dead and gone  
They said no one would buy them old drinking and cheating songs Ill still
buyem  
Well there aint no justice in it and the hard facts are cold  
Murders been committed down on music row  
  
Oh the steel guitars no longer cry and you cant hear fiddles play  
With drums and rock n roll guitars mixed right up in your face  
Why the Hag he wouldnt have a chance on todays radio  
Since they committed murder down on music row  
Why they even tell the Possum to pack up and go back home  
Theres been an awful murder down on music row
