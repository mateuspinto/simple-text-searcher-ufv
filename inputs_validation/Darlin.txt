Darlin dearest darlin  
Put your arms around me baby please  
Darlin dearest darlin  
Kiss me one more time before you leave  
  
If you must go be on your way before I start  
And beggin you to stay with me  
Im getting weak from being strong  
And first thing that you know Ill be down on my knees  
  
Darlin dearest darlin  
Always in my heart and in my thoughts  
Darlin dearest darlin  
Having love you once Ill never stop
