Chorus  
Drop dead legs pretty smile  
Hurts my head gets me wild  
Dig that steam giant butt  
Makes me scream I get nuhnuhnothing but the shakes over you  
And nothing else could ever do  
  
Chorus  
  
You know that you want it  
I know what it is  
You know that you want it baby  
When the night is through will I still be loving you  
Dig those moves vampire  
Set me loose get it higher  
Throw my rope loopdeloop  
Nice white teeth Betty Boop  
Set it cool real heavy  
I aint fooled gettin ready  
  
Chorus
