Rain fell this mornin make me feel so bad  
On account of my baby walked off with another man  
Like takin eyesight from the blind man and money from the poor  
That woman took my lovin and walked on out that door  
And it sure got cold after the rain fell  
Not from the sky from my eye  
  
Somebody can you tell me just what make a man feel this way  
Like river without its water like night without a day  
And it sure nuff got cold after the rain fell  
Not from the sky but from my eye  
  
If youre home early in the mornin you hear that rain to fall  
With thunderbolts and lightning the wind begins to call  
Your worrys superficial cause you slept on through the night  
But stormy weather keep you wondrin if evrythings all right  
And it sure nuff got cold after the rain fell  
Not from the sky but from my eye  
Not from the sky from my eye
