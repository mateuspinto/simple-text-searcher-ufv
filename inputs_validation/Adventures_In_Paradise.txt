We want to be alone tonight  
til early in the morning light  
Out in the open you are here  
Adventures in paradise  
  
We want to be alone tonight  
til early in the morning light  
Exploring what the nature brings  
Adventures in paradise  
Adventures in paradise  
  
Oh give me what I need tonight  
Oh you know what I want tonight  
Oh give me what I need tonight  
Adventures in paradise

When the moon is at its height  
And nobody is in sight  
Were hiding from the world we used to like  
And will stories then be told  
Of what we did here tonight  
You will always be my number one  
  
Oh give me what I need tonight  
Oh you know what I want tonight  
Oh give me what I need tonight  
Adventures in paradise  
  
Oh give me what I need tonight

Oh you know what I want tonight  
Cause you know what I need tonight  
Oh give me what I need tonight

Oh you know what I want tonight  
Cause you know what I need tonight  
Oh give me what I need tonight
