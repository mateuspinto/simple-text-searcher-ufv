Aint no doubt about it  
This must be love  
One little kiss from you  
And I feel glad all over  
Oo baby hot dang gilly  
Its silly  
But Im glad all over  
  
Yeah the goosepimples baby  
Cause I feel so good  
When you call me like you do  
And I feel glad all over  
Oo mercy Im rock gone puppy  
And Im happy  
And Im glad all over  
  
Your touch sewed me  
Like an electric wire  
Never thought of make love  
It dont take much looking  
To see what Ive got  
But it shows yes it shows  
Come on honey Bonnie  
Give me one more time  
Every time you do  
Well I feel glad all over  
Ooo baby hot dang gilly  
Its silly  
But Im glad all over  
Yeah  
  
Tried to tell you  
How Im cooking inside  
When were cheek to cheek  
My temperature is low  
Fever is high  
I cant speak  
Im too weak  
  
Well come on honey Bonnie  
Give me one more time  
Every time you do  
Well I feel glad all over  
Ooo baby hot dang gilly  
Its silly  
But Im glad all over  
Hot dang gilly  
Its silly  
But Im glad all over  
Well hot dang gilly  
Its silly  
But Im glad all over
