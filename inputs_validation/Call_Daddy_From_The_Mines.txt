A little girl woke up deep in the dark and started cryin  
The mother brought a light and held her daughter tight  
She thought it was so strange to hear a little girl of nine  
Cry Call daddy from the mine call daddy from the mine  
Her mother wiped the tears and said See honey youre only dreaming  
Your dad must work today he has to draw his pay  
She left her then but still could hear her cry time after time  
Call daddy from the mine call daddy from the mine  
Then the countryside was shaken by a mighty rumble  
And fear for miles around was the trembling of the ground  
The little girl was fast asleep yet cried out one more time  
Call daddy from the mine call daddy from the mine  
Ten thousand tears and two weeks later deep in the smoking ground  
A dying man was found had survived all those around  
Hed quickly crawled to a fresh air pocket barely just in time  
When he heard his own child whine Call daddy from the mine  
Call daddy from the mine call daddy from the mine
