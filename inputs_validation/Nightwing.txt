Nightwing has stirred and taken to flight  
The silence is over hes shattered the night  
No other hunter has the power or the grace  
He is the master of this place  
  
Tell every creature of the night  
The kill is around the bend  
So listen my friend  
Nightwing flies again  
  
They say he comes for those whose souls are weak  
And call his name upon the wind  
The night is cold and thick with mystery  
Oh I can feel his beating wings  
  
Tell every creature of the night  
The kill is around the bend  
Nightwing flies again  
  
Tell every creature of the night  
The kill is around the bend  
Nightwing flies again  
  
Nightwing has stirred and taken to flight  
The silence is over hes shattered the night  
Life aint for giving and forgiving aint free  
No soul will rest while the hunted run free  
  
So tell every creature of the night  
The kill is around the bend  
Listen my friend  
Nightwing flies again
