On the seven seas there was aphantom ship acoming  
Shinin in the dead of night  
I heard the crew a hummin  
Tunes that sounded like the Rolling Stones and Leonard Cohen  
But they didnt know the words  
So I assumed that they was foreign  
  
But I heard them just the same doctor let me teach em  
I just want to please em doctor let me teach em  
  
I looked up in the sky there was a phantom plane a comin  
Shinin in the dead of night  
I heard the pilot saying  
Poems that were written by John Keats and Robert Browning  
But he didnt know the words so  
I suppose that it was nothing  
  
But I heard them just the same doctor let me teach em  
I just want to please em doctor let me teach em  
  
Doctor please believe me I know you wont decieve me  
But do these things Im seein have any hidden meaning  
Its all good entertainment and it doesnt cost a penny  
So please doc let me teach em if I could only reach em  
  
But I heard them just the same doctor let me teach em  
I just want to please em doctor let me teach em
