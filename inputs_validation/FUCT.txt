We got the killing  
You got the time  
We got the making of a terminal blind  
  
We got the risk  
You got to take  
We got the making of a big mistake  
  
Got no faith  
Got no reason  
Got no hope  
Got the treason  
  
We got the hit  
already took  
Hate to tell you  
But I think youre fuct  
  
All about face  
All about life  
All about walking the edge of the knife  
All about race  
All about death  
All about getting out of this mess  
  
We got the truth  
You got the hurt  
We got the answer that you just insert  
  
We are explicit  
You are expossed  
We are the making of the decomposed  
  
Got no faith  
Got no reason  
Got no hope  
Got the treason  
  
Got the kaos  
Runamuk  
Bite down hard  
Youre about to be fuct  
  
All about face  
All about life  
All about walking the edge of the knife  
All about race  
All about death  
All about getting out of this mess  
  
We are the day  
We are the night  
We are the stop sign in the road of life  
  
We are the message  
Unreturned  
We are the next about to be burned  
  
Got no faith  
Got no reason  
Got no hope  
Got the treason  
  
Change your mind  
Change your look  
Change your heart  
Now youre fuct  
  
All about face  
All about life  
All about walking the edge of the knife  
All about race  
All about death  
All about getting out of this mess  
All about face
