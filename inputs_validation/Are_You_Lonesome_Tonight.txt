Are you lonesome tonight do you miss me tonight are you sorry we drifted
apart  
Does your memory stray to a bright summer day  
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart  
Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare  
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there  
  
Is your heart filled with pain shall I come back again  
Tell me dear are you lonesome tonight  
Is your heart filled with pain shall I come back again  
Tell me dear are you lonesome tonight
