Lions in the street and roaming  
Dogs in heat rabid foaming  
A beast caged in the heart of a city  
The body of his mother  
Rotting in the summer ground  
He fled the town  
He went down South and crossed the border  
Left the chaos and disorder  
Back there over his shoulder  
One morning he awoke in a green hotel  
With a strange creature groaning beside him  
Sweat oozed from its shiny skin  
Is everybody in  
The ceremony is about to begin
