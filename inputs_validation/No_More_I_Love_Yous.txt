Do be do be do do do oh  
Do be do be do do do oh  
Do be do be do do do oh  
Do be do be do do do oh  
  
I used to be a lunatic from the gracious days  
I used to feel woebegone and so restless nights  
My aching heart would bleed for you to see  
Oh but now  
I dont find myself bouncing home  
Whistling my consence to make me cry  
  
No more I love yous  
The language is leaving me  
No more I love yous  
Changes are shifting  
Outside the words  
  
The lover speaks about the monsters  
  
I used to have demons in my room at night  
Desire despair desire  
So many monsters  
  
Oh but now  
I dont find myself bouncing around  
Whistling my consence to make me cry  
  
No more I love yous  
The language is leaving me  
No more I love yous  
The language is leaving me in silence  
No more I love yous  
Changes are shifting  
Outside the words  
  
And people are being real crazy  
But we will only come  
And you know what mommy  
Everybody was being real crazy  
The monsters are crazy  
There are monsters outside  
  
No more I love yous  
The language is leaving me  
No more I love yous  
The language is leaving me in silence  
No more I love yous  
Changes are shifting outside the words  
Outside the words  
  
No more I love yous  
The language is leaving me  
No more I love yous  
The language is leaving me  
No more I love yous  
Changes are shifting outside the words  
  
Do be do be do do do oh  
Do be do be do do do oh  
Outside the words
