Night inside the city  
Empty sidewalks  
Stretching under dizzy lights  
Rain is hummin  
The streets are runnin  
Underneath the neon lights  
We run together  
Well run forever  
Outta here ridin the wheels  
  
Look at pretty windows  
At shiny people  
Statues under sparkling lights  
Just take a picture  
And a melted moment  
Flashin on the crazy ride  
Just close your eyes now  
And breathe a sigh now  
Were gettin outta here  
Outta here  
Ridin the wheels  
Ridin the wheels  
Ooh  
Ridin the wheels  
Ridin the wheels  
Ridin the wheels  
  
Wheels  
  
Outta here ridin the wheels  
Ridin the wheels  
Ridin the wheels  
Ridin the wheels  
Ridin the wheels  
Ridin ridin the wheels  
Ridin the wheels  
Ridin ridin ridin the wheels  
Ridin the wheels  
Ooh  
Oh  
Aye
