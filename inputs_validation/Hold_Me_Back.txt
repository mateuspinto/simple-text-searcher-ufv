Driving fast and ditching school breaking all the precious rules  
Its too hard to make a living  
I need a kick I need a girl so badly I could scream  
Im sick of watching people on TV  
  
I feel the wind in my face  
I need a car at the start of the race  
I need a highway and a beer  
If I dont stop now theres plenty to fear  
  
Chorus  
Hold Me back oh wont you hold me back  
I can get violent any time  
Hold me back I feel another attack  
Brewing deep inside  
Hold Me Back oh wont you Hold me back  
Hold Me Back oh wont you hold me back  
Hold Me Back  
  
Teacher doesnt understand  
Just how dangerous I am  
I need a break from the world  
Now more than ever I need it good  
I need something I can taste  
And a vacation from the human race  
  
I need money I need it bad  
If I dont have it I get mad  
If I get mad I do such terrible things  
I get real crazy and I make girls scream
