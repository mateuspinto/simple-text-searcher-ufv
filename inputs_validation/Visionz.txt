Apocalypse Now  
Mind over matter next batter be Tical  
Put it on a platter how much uncut  
Raw shit we dealin wit murder track what  
  
Slang killin it touched  
You feelin it in your bloodstream  
Deadly venomous elixir  
Hammer like Sledge that be Sister  
  
All and together now follow me the Mista  
Meth Candyman farewell to the flesh  
Death come in the scripture twothousand one  
Bring the rap armageddeon let it be known  
  
When you walk up in this Dead Zone  
With all that wack shit now you know  
You dead wrong one thousand lashes  
  
Detonate that pussy Massengil rap cleanse that  
The kids rank snatch collars off while ridin off  
Float boat big boys Oakland As stashed away blades  
Ventilation let the sharks animaze  
Somethin sheist like seven butcher knives rollin Rover style  
Twice finger itchy like lice hair fell out somethin  
To conquer stomp ya like that cat Blanca  
Toy Tonka truck ten carat on ya monsta  
Ring Rocky like fuck switch sides like water rides  
The DAT bubble life preserve the other guys  
Now FUCK YALL act wilda  
The style wilda than a praying mantis  
Chillin like  
  
As my brothers and I reign rebellious changin  
The courses of time devils no longer exist  
As God Cypher Divine all minds one no question  
Now check it  
Perhaps we can go through Lessons  
Or might SHOT me a pussy protestin  
Comin with that lip professin you must take  
Allah for fool wheres his Jewel  
Was he usin Mathematics as a tool  
Tell me the struggle is God and I came to build  
Shit is so real inside you distilled  
Back in the form of mist  
You wishin you did the Knowledge before speakin  
Seekin where you went wrong  
And why would I bring you such physical harm  
  
Yo mind arson my squadren surround the SoundGarden  
Guns for hire plus you under fire and a target  
Sniper in the cypher I Pied Piper  
Move the housing by the thousand I watched out the Chrysler  
Bombs strike ya like the mighty Thor blast the door  
Recite a page like a tidal wave past the shore  
Two pulls Im wild like mechanical bulls  
Pack a full house its girls night out pull a hairful  
Heavenly laced stimulation make you feel slow paced  
I motivate and await my sober state  
  
Magnificent heavenly the God stay bent  
Five Percent Range whippin soul controller of the lynch  
Mackin phone rings Stephen King trauma down at Danzine  
My mood swings suplexed off the rope magazine  
Coconut jewels wore no color shoe knife annual  
Moses lost his sandal hidin the manual  
Blow the vandal buggin off of Bon Jovi hits  
Grammer love famous murder weapon was a trophy  
Seize posin in Oshkosh guzzle cries  
Sabotage massage rap bandit at large  
Wolverine Carnation Milk Wu denim jeans  
Thurston Howell the Third kids back on the scene  
Call it chopped meat cause every word is choppy  
My logic crunch all crows to death Kobiyashi couldnt stop me  
Gettin caught up in my world HaagenDaaz world  
Backflip and then twirl cave your whole world in
