One morning one morning one morning in May  
I spied a young couple they were making their way  
One was a maiden so bright and so fair and the other was a soldier and a brave
volunteer  
  
Good morning good morning good morning said he  
And where are you going my pretty lady  
Im going out awalking on the banks of the sea  
Just to see the waters glide and hear the nightingale sing  
  
Now they had not been standing but a minute or two  
When out of his knapsack a fiddle he drew  
And the tune that he played made the valleys all ring  
Oh hark cried the maiden hear the nightingale sing  
  
Oh maiden fair maiden tis time to give oer  
Oh no kind soldier please play one tune more  
For Id rather hear your fiddle at the touch of one string  
Than to see the waters glide and hear the nightingale sing  
  
Oh soldier kind soldier will you marry me Oh no pretty maiden that never
shall be  
Ive a wife down in London and children twice three  
Two wives and the armys too many for me  
  
Well Ill go back to London and Ill stay there for a year  
Its often that Ill think of you my little dear  
And if ever I return it will be in the spring  
Just to see the waters glide and hear the nightingale sing  
To see the waters glide and hear the nightingale sing
