Let us have peace let us have life  
Let us escape the cruel night  
Let us have time let the sun shine  
Let us beware the deadly sign  
  
The day is coming  
Armageddons near  
Infernos coming  
Can we survive the blitzkrieg  
The blitzkrieg  
The blitzkrieg  
  
Save us from fate save us from hate  
Save ourselves before its too late  
Come to our need hear our plea  
Save ourselves before the earth bleeds  
  
The day is dawning  
The time is near  
Aliens calling  
Can we survive the blitzkrieg  
  
Haha  
  
Burp  
Hahaha  
I fucked up one place
