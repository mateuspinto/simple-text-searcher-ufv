If I gave you my heart  
Where would you be  
Would it mean nothing  
If not for me  
  
If I gave you my eyes  
What would they see  
Would they see nothing  
If not for me  
  
But I gave you my hand and my sign and my soul on the earth  
And I gave up on truth when I heard about the words  
I lived out of love when I gave it away  
And I sold off my soul when theres no one to pay  
  
If I gave you my hand  
What would it write  
Would it say nothing  
Or say its alright  
  
If I gave you my arms  
Would they hold you tight  
First blood  in morning  
Or bid you goodnight  
  
And I gave you my strength and my worth and I gave you my gift  
And I moved on the first and I left us to drift  
And I reap from the soil and I build hopes from wood  
Its a new better life and we have to ensure  
  
And I gave you my dream of the world and you stole the key  
You sang to the wind in the whole  sea  
And I feel my weight and I guard my soul  
And I found my beliefs when I found my control  
I gave you my hand and my soul on the earth  
And I gave up on the truth when I heard about the words  
So I lived out of love when I gave it away  
And I sold off my soul when theres no one to pay
