Near to the Heart of God  
  
There is a place of quiet rest  
Near to the heart of God  
A place where sin cannot molest  
Near to the heart of God  
Refrain  
  
O Jesus blest Redeemer  
Sent from the heart of God  
Hold us who wait before Thee  
Near to the heart of God  
  
There is a place of comfort sweet  
Near to the heart of God  
A place where we our Savior meet  
Near to the heart of God  
  
Refrain  
There is a place of full release  
Near to the heart of God  
A place where all is joy and peace  
Near to the heart of God  
  
Refrain
