So many times I thought I hold it in my hands  
But just like grains of sand  
Love slips through my fingers  
  
So many nights I asked the lord above  
Please make me lucky enough  
To find a love that lingers  
  
Something keeps telling me  
That you could be my answered prayer  
You must be heaven sent I swear  
  
Cause something happens when you look at me  
I forget to speak  
Something happens when you kiss my mouth  
My knees gets so weak  
Could it be true this is what god has meant for me  
Cause baby I cant believe  
That something like you could happen to me  
  
Something like you  
  
Girl in your eyes I feel your fire burn  
All your secrets I will learn  
Even if it takes forever  
  
With you by my side I can do anything  
I dont care what tomorrow brings  
As long as were together  
  
My heart is telling me  
That you could be my meant to be  
I know it more each time we touch  
  
Something magical  
Something spiritual  
Something stronger than the two of us alone  
Something physical  
Something undeniable  
Nothing like anything that Ive ever known  
  
Cant believe that you happen to me
