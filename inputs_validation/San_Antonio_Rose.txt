Deep within my heart lies a melody  
A song of old San Antone  
Where in dreams I live with a memory  
Beneath the stars all alone  
  
Well it was there I found beside the Alamo  
Enchantments strange as the blue up above  
For that moonlit pass that only he would know  
Still hears my broken song of love  
  
Moon in all your splendor known only to my heart  
Call back my rose rose of San Antone  
Lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart  
Speak once again of my love my own  
  
Broken song empty words I know  
Still live in my heart all alone  
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo  
And rose my rose of San Antone  
  
Broken song empty words I know  
Still live in my heart all alone  
For that moonlit pass by the Alamo  
And rose my rose of San Antone  
  
And rose my rose of San Antone  
And rose my rose of San Antone
