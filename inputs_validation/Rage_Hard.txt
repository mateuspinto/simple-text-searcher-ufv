Rage Rage Rage Rage  
Rage Hard  
  
Laugh like the head of Apollo  
Young and strong on the wings of tomorrow  
Rise up in millions get off your knees  
Dispelling the demons  
In the valley of danger  
We all work together sculptures in sorrow  
With love light to follow on  
Sweet head of Apollo  
  
Rage hard into the light  
Rage hard doing it right doing it right  
Rage Hard against the dark  
Rage Hard make your mark  
Let the tournament begin  
Dont give up and dont give in  
Strength to rise up strength to win  
Strength to save the world from losing  
  
Rage Hard into the light  
Rage Hard doing it right  
Rage Hard against the dark  
Rage Hard  
  
Rage  
  
Rage Hard  
  
Though blue eyes of children  
They shine without fear  
Hope is the future with oceans of cheer  
Nothing to fear  
Theres nothing to fear  
Though laughter of angels resounding  
From heaven keep fighting the favours  
Of charlatan saviours charlatan saviours  
  
Rage hard into the light  
Rage hard doing it right doing it right  
Rage Hard against the dark  
Rage Hard make your mark  
Let the tournament begin  
Dont give up and dont give in  
Rage hard into the light  
Rage hard doing it right  
Rage Hard against the dark  
Rage Hard make your mark  
  
I dont know which way to go  
My loves like driven snow  
When we past the test of time  
My love you shall be mine  
And if only lost and lonely  
Is all thats wrong with me we ll be free  
Be free be free  
  
Laugh like the head of apollo  
Young and strong on the wings of tomorrow  
Rage Hard  
Rage Hard  
Let the tournament begin  
Dont give up and dont give in  
  
Rage Hard into the light  
Rage Hard doing it right  
Let the tournament begin  
Dont give up and dont give in  
Strength to rise up strength to win  
Strength to save the world from losing
