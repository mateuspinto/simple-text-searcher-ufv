She wanted to be like her mother in many ways  
The way she walks the way she smiles  
Over and above all  
The way she brushes her hair back  
She heard it all being said to her  
Saw it all happeneing in her life  
Like every woman  
Shes been trapped in this fairy tale  
Find a frog kiss it  
And hope it would turn into a handsome prince  
How many frogs had she kissed in her life  
None of them turned into a handsome prince  
The little girl made a decision in her life oh  
And she promised to keep it  
  
Im gonna kiss no frog  
  
Everything went the way she wanted  
Every dream was what she wanted  
But when it came to finding someone  
To spend her life with  
Same old story  
  
Find a frog kiss it  
And hope itll turn into a prince oh  
Better to be alone and happy  
Then being with someone and being unhappy  
All your life  
  
Im gonna kiss no frog
