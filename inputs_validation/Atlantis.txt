In that ocean  
Wide eyed and deeper in your gaze  
And bluer than the bright thats in the cave  
There is a city  
Came out from you Atlantis  
In ruins sunken below the waves  
But in the city  
Where there is no one  
Whats the point of being free eh  
When there is nothing there to tie me down  
Oh no more here  
The bluest city  
Covered in coral and coral  
On sea chests  
And sealed Jamaician tales  
There is nobody  
To count the soldiering meandering whales  
With a shoal of herring amongst the sails  
But in the city  
Where there is no one  
Whats the point of being free eh  
When there is nothing there to tie me down  
Oh no more here  
There is the city Atlantis
