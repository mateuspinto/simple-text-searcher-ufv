Workin this job aint payin the bills  
Sick and tired rat race takin my thrills  
Kickin down a road not a dollar in my pocket  
Night time falls and Im ready to rock it  
  
I need a shot of gasoline  
I hittin one sixteen  
I get so hot I see steam  
Forget the day cause were gonna scream  
  
Night songs  
Howl into the light singin  
Night songs  
Makes the day right  
Night songs  
Raise your glass take a bite  
Night songs  
  
Ridin to the east and ridin to the west  
Sleepin all day but never get a rest  
Lookin at the time stand still it aint right  
Livin for the moment time to get it tight  
  
I need a shot of gasoline  
I hittin one sixteen  
I get so hot I see steam  
Forget the day cause were gonna scream  
  
Night songs  
Howl into the light singin  
Night songs  
Makes the day right  
Night songs  
Raise your glass take a bite  
Night songs  
Oh sing it  
  
I need a shot of gasoline  
I hittin one sixteen  
I get so hot I see steam  
Forget the day cause were gonna scream  
  
Night songs  
Night songs  
Night songs  
Night songs  
Night songs  
Night songs  
Night songs  
Night songs  
Night songs  
Night songs  
Night songs  
Night songs  
Night songs  
Night songs
