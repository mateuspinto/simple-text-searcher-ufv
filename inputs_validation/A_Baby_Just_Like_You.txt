The season is upon us now  
A time for gifts and giving  
And as the year draws to its close  
I think about my living  
  
The Christmas time when I was young  
The magic and the wonder  
But colors dull and candles dim  
And dark my standing under  
  
O little Zachary shining light  
Youve set my soul to dreaming  
Youve given back my joy in life  
And filled me with new meaning  
  
A Savior King was born that day  
A baby just like you  
And as the Magi came with gifts  
I come with my gift too  
That peace on Earth fills up your time  
That brotherhood surrounds you  
  
That you may know the warmth of love  
And wrap it all around you  
Its just a wish a dream Im told  
From days when I was young  
  
Merry Christmas little Zachary  
Merry Christmas everyone  
Merry Christmas little Zachary  
Merry Christmas everyone
