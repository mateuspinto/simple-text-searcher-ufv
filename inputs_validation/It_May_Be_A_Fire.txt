It may be a fire  
Tomorrow it could be nothing  
It may reach out to the sky  
Light up everything that you know  
Everywhere you go from now  
You will see better than before  
People youve not known for years  
Will come knocking at your door  
It may be a fire  
But you gotta get it into your heart  
It may be a warm wind  
That tries to blow your heart away  
It may walk into your life  
Tell you everything that you know  
Looking down through all the years  
Making plans that have gone past  
Something youve not known for years  
But you knew that it would last  
It may be a fire  
But you gotta get it into your heart  
  
Im turning all the answers  
Inside out  
Looking for a love  
That reaches out  
Or the fire into your heart  
  
It may be a fire  
Tomorrow it may be nothing  
It may reach up to the sky  
Light up everything that I know  
Everywhere I go from now  
I will see better than before  
  
People Ive known for years  
Will come knocking at my door  
It may be a fire  
But you gotta get it into your heart  
It may be a fire  
But you gotta get it  
You gotta get it  
You gotta get it into your heart  
It may be a fire  
But you gotta get it  
Into your heart
