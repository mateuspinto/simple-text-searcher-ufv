Im playing back  
The melody you hummed  
Because you couldnt whistle  
The motion of your tears  
Passes through the air  
At the moment you lightly touched my arm  
The sun is bright  
And I turned my eyes away from your signal  
Because Ive been alone  
The stars are too wide  
Give me another chance  
When our hearts overlap it will rise  
Like a color pattern  
With a feeling this natural  
Theres no way it can be mistaken  
When I look at it from the gap in my memories it vanishes  
That pattern  
No matter how far were separated  
Theres no reason for you to give up  
No matter how much you push me away  
I cant hide it  
Now throwing away my pride  
Ill beg of you  
When I awake from dreaming  
If youre there for me  
Oh I need nothing more  
Even the weakness hidden by the sun  
Which I understand for the first time  
If we can be together  
Ill become strong  
Give me another chance  
Im searching for you my dear  
In the circle shaped pattern  
Inside the endless maze  
I want to come a little closer to you  
In this daily battle  
I cant convey it  
No matter how tightly you hold me  
I have no way to reach you  
When our hearts overlap it will rise  
Like a color pattern  
With a feeling this natural  
Theres no way it can be mistaken  
When I look at it from the gap in my memories it vanishes  
That pattern  
No matter how far were separated  
Theres no reason for you to give up
