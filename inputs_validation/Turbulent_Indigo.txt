You want to make Van Goghs  
Raise em up like sheep  
Make em out of Eskimos  
And women if you please  
Make em nice and normal  
Make em nice and neat  
You see him with his shotgun there  
Bloodied in the wheat  
Oh what do you know about  
Living in Turbulent Indigo  
  
Brash fields crude crows  
In a scary sky  
In a golden frame  
Roped off  
Tourists guided by  
Tourists talking about the madhouse  
Talking about the ear  
The madman hangs in fancy homes  
They wouldnt let him near  
Hed piss in their fireplace  
Hed drag them through Turbulent Indigo  
  
Im a burning hearth he said  
People see the smoke  
But no one comes to warm themselves  
Sloughing off a coat  
And all my little landscapes  
All my yellow afternoons  
Stack up around this vacancy  
Like dirty cups and spoons  
No mercy Sweet Jesus  
No mercy from Turbulent Indigo
