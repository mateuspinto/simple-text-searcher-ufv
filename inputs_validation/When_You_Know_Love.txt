She was born in a spirit of brightness  
Knew just how to deal with poison wine  
Be very brave she taught me to behave  
On the road that is so long  
Be not afraid of tears  
When you know the love  
Then you can know no fear  
When you know love  
You can know no fear  
She looks on from her realm within the other  
Now shes fighting hard to keep her sovereignty  
She will live forever  
In her spirit of brightness  
She will always deal with poison wine  
To stay alive  
She taught me to survive  
In the face of every trial  
Be not afraid of tears  
When you know the love  
Then you can know no fear  
When you know love  
You can know no fear
