I preach the ways of Satan  
Answer to his calls  
I translate manuscripts  
On ancient Latin scrolls  
In my shrine my avernus  
I see the gates of Hell  
Guarded well by Chronozon  
Tortured souls do dwell  
Satanachist  
Satanachist  
I mount the virgin Venus  
Plague the blackened seas  
I am the souls destructor  
Marching without fear  
The night is filled with souls  
In coral exctasy  
The saraband of death  
Will always follow me  
Satanachist  
Satanachist  
I bear the evil eye  
Possess the unbidden  
Ill bring your dead alive  
And chew your flesh from bone  
I stalk through life and death  
With Gorgon for my gaze  
I breath the immortal pain  
Beware the human race  
Satanachist  
Satanachist
