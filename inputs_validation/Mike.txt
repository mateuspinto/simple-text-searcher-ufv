Dad what was Nigel supposed to do with your body  
A life that I will never understand  
Whose false teeth were gently pushed back into your mouth by your daughters
husband  
What am I supposed to do with this  
I feel like I am not nice because sometimes  
It is hard for me to think something happy about you  
Except for that dad I love you and I will always always miss you  
Pull my finger
