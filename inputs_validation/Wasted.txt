Well Ive been lying awake all night just thinking of you  
But a bottle of whiskey lies heavy obstructing my view  
Ive got a bottle of pills to give me my thrills  
And I know that Im leading a life that kills  
  
Wasted Ive wasted my time  
Wasted Im shooting a line  
Wasted Im stuck in a hole  
Wasted Im losing control  
  
And Ive been meaning to call Ive been wanting to phone  
You see I dont like the thought of leaving you here alone  
Well Ive seen things down here that are fit for a queen  
Ive seen things down here that should never be seen  
  
Wasted Ive wasted my money  
Wasted Ive wasted you honey  
Wasted Im out of my brain  
Wasted Im going insane  
  
Im running in thin air  
Theres nothingness everywhere  
Ive gotta get out  
Wont you help me  
Ive gotta get out  
Wont you help me  
Ive gotta get out oh wont you help me get out  
  
I thought I saw you just the other day  
But it couldnt be you cos you had nothing to say  
Hes going away they told all my friends  
Well now Ill be stuck in here til the misery ends  
  
Wasted Ive wasted my time  
Wasted Im shooting a line  
Wasted Im out of my head  
Wasted I wish I was dead
