Come on baby light the fire  
I got somethin you should see  
Well ya know it didnt cost me nothin  
But I wrapped it for ya specially  
So forget the little angel on the tree  
And just love me  
Well if I told ya dont buy me presents  
Now you know that would be a lie  
Baby I dont have to have all the money in the world  
Just give me some quality time  
Yeah Christmas aint about expensive things  
So just love me  
Woah oh yeah  
  
Spoken  
Come here boy  
Oh no no no no no now yeah ha  
Oh yeah its Christmas eve the slowest mornin  
Ive been waitin for our time alone  
Ill be standin beneath the mistletoe  
Now that everybodies finally gone  
So some over here and kiss me tenderly  
And just love me  
Well let me be your little angel on the tree  
And just love me  
Yeah come over here and kiss me tenderly  
And just love me  
Just love me oh yeah baby  
Ohh yeah yeah ha  
  
spoken Merry Christmas baby
