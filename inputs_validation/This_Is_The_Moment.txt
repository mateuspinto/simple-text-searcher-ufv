This is the moment  
This is the day  
This is the moment  
When I know  
I am on my way  
Every endeavour  
I have made ever  
Is coming into play  
Is here and now today  
  
This is the moment  
This the time  
When the momentum  
And the moment  
are in rhyme  
Give me this moment  
My precious chance  
Ill gather up my best  
And make some sense at last  
  
This is the moment  
When all Ive done  
All of the dreaming  
scheming and screaming  
becomes one  
This is the day  
Just see it shine  
When all that I have lived for  
Becomes mine  
  
This is the moment  
This is the hour  
When I can open up  
tomorrow  
like a flower  
And put my hand to  
Everything I plan to  
Fulfill my grand desire  
See all my stars align  
  
This is the moment  
My final test  
Destiny beckoned  
I never reckoned second best  
I wont look back  
I must not fall  
This is the moment  
The sweetest moment  
Of them all  
  
This is the moment  
So double the odds  
This day or never  
Ill sit forever  
with the gods  
When I look back  
I will recall  
Moment for moment  
This was the moment  
The greatest moment of them all
