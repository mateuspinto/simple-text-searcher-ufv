I get rattled every time we meet  
I get rattled even in my sleep  
I get rattled baby over you  
  
I get twisted I get turned around  
I get twisted and Im up then Im down  
I get twisted baby over you  
  
Well baby baby baby wont you save one night for me  
Baby baby baby is there something wrong with you  
Baby baby baby this is out of my control  
It may look like nothings wrong but deep down in my soul  
Im twisted  shaken  rattled  
I get rattled baby over you  
  
Well baby baby baby wont you save one night for me  
Baby baby baby is there something wrong with you  
Baby baby baby this is out of my control  
It may look like nothings wrong but deep down in my soul  
Im twisted  shaken  rattled  
I get rattled baby over you  
  
I get shaken Im torn up by the roots  
Yeah Im shakin way down in my boots  
I get rattled baby over you  
I get rattled baby over you  
  
Rattled baby over you
