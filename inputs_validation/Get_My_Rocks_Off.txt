Some men need some killer weed some men need cocaine  
Some men need some cactus juice to purify the brain  
Some men need two women some need alcohol  
Everybody needs a little something but Lord I need it all  
  
To get my rocks off get my rocks off  
Get my rocks off the mountain and roll em on down the hill  
  
I may do you one time and I may do you more  
I may turn you into something that you aint ready for  
I might want your body and I might want your bread  
I might want your momma to come visit me instead  
  
And get my rocks off get my rocks off  
Get my rocks off the mountain and roll em on down the hill  
  
Sometimes I dream of chicks to bring me ever lasting joys  
Sometimes I dream of animals sometimes I dream of boys  
Sometimes I kill the living sometimes I raise the dead  
Sometimes I say just screw it all and crawl back into bed  
  
And get my rocks off get my rocks off  
Get my rocks off the mountain and roll em on down the hill
