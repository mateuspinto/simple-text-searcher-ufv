Spoken intro  
HE IS DESCENDED FROM GIANTS  
HIS FATHER LOKIGOD OF FIRE IS THE SWORN BLOOD BROTHER TO ODIN HIMSELF  
HE RIDES ACROSS LAND SEA AND AIR FROM THE LAND OF THE LIVING TO THE LAND OF
THE DEAD  
THIS EIGHT LEGGED STEED CROSSES EIGHT POINTS OF THE COMPASS FROM EIGHT
DIRECTIONS INTO EIGHT DIMENSIONS  
HE IS BRINGER OF THE VALIANT DEAD FROM THE BATTLEFIELD TO VALHALLA  
Songtext

OVER LAND AND SEA  
ACROSS THE RAINBOW BRIDGE TO VALHALLA  
ODINS WAITING FOR ME  
HE WAS BORN OF GIANTS  
HIS ICY COAT IS GREY  
AT NIGHT HE RIDES INTO THE WORLD OF DEATH  
THE LIVING BY DAY  
ONE DAY ON HIS BACK I SHALL RIDE  
FROM THE BATTLEFIELD INTO THE SKY  
BORNE BY VALKYRIES WE VALIANT DEAD  
INTO THE HALL OF HEROES SHALL BE LED  
RIDE DOWN FROM ASGARD  
TO THE BATTLEFIELD  
BRINGER OF THE VALIANT DEAD  
WHO DIED BUT NEVER YIELDED  
CARRY WE WHO DIE IN BATTLE  
SLEIPNIR OVER LAND AND SEA  
ACROSS THE RAINBOW BRIDGE TO VALHALLA  
ODINS WAITING FOR ME  
FASTER THEN THE FASTEST HORSE ALIVE  
THE LIVING SON OF FIRE RIDES  
FROM THE HALLS OF ASGARD ACROSS THE SKY  
TO THE WORLD OF GODS AND MEN  
EIGHT LEGS AND MAGIC RUNES  
CARVED UPON HIS TEETH  
THUNDER AND LIGHTNING  
SOUND BENEATH HIS FEET  
ON HIS BACK THE WAR GOD ODIN RIDES  
SWORD AND MAGIC SPEAR HELD HIGH  
RIDE DOWN FROM ASGARD  
TO THE BATTLEFIELD  
BRINGER OF THE VALIANT DEAD  
WHO DIED BUT NEVER YIELDED  
CARRY WE WHO DIE IN BATTLE  
OVER LAND AND SEA  
ACROSS THE RAINBOW BRIDGE TO VALHALLA  
ODINS WAITING FOR ME
