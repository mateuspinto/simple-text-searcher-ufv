The daylight train comes so slowly  
And now its so easy to see  
Warm at night  
She sleeps so tight  
She gave me comfort  
Made me smile  
She was my best friend for a while  
Well I was no hurricane  
A daylight dream of mine  
She comes with the sun  
In the morning sun  
We shared the mystery of a power  
She was an angel in my darkest hour  
As I close my eyes  
I can see her face  
Feel inside a rhythm  
I can feel her warm embrace  
She comes with the sun  
In the morning sun  
She gave me comfort  
Made me smile  
She was my best friend for a while
