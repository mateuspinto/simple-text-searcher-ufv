Into each life a little sunlight wants to shine  
Let me tell you fortune life that once was mine  
  
Chorus  
She was a special girl and she meant the world to me and I gave her everything  
  
When I found her Id been looking everywhere  
And when I lost her I was lost beyond despair  
  
Chorus  
  
Dreams are hard to touch could it be I love her too much  
  
Chorus  
  
Bottom line is she was fine in every way  
And its not with hesitation that I say  
  
Chorus  
  
Dreams they come and go but thoughts like love will always grow
