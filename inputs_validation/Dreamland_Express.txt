I caught a ride on the Dreamland Express last night  
I was sailing on an ocean of blue  
And right there by my side much to my surprise was you  
  
I said come on over baby let me look in your eyes  
Let me see the very heart of you  
And I couldnt believe it or conceive that my dream would come true  
  
Cause you said hey there sweet daddy everything is alright  
You know for miles theres not a telephone line  
Theres not a soul to disturb us  
Just come and be mine  
  
You said let me be the end of your rainbow  
Let me be the stars up above  
Let me be the one that you long for baby  
Let me be the one that you love oh  
Let me be the one that you love  
  
But now its four in the mornin I cant sleep  
I cant seem to get you out of my mind  
I keep tossin and turnin Im yearnin for the sun to shine  
  
Id like to send you a ticket on the Dreamland Express  
And take you far away with me  
Ive got a vision of heaven you livin there with me  
  
Let me be the end of your rainbow  
Let me be the stars up above  
Let me be the one that you long for baby  
Let me be the one that you love oh oh  
Let me be the one that you love  
  
Let me be the end of your rainbow  
Let me be the stars up above  
Let me be the one that you long for baby  
Let me be the one that you love oh  
Let me be the one that you love
