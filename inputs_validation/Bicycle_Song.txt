Here she comes in a suit and tie  
Shepards bush and a leopards pie  
Shes marching to the funky beat of  
James Brown and his dancing feet  
Gonna set your fish on fire  
A pistol whipping of desire  
So please do not resist your fate  
Ill pick you up yes its a date  
  
How could I forget to mention the bicycle is a good invention  
Sitting there in a silent movie  
Beside the only girl who really ever knew me  
Happy days but sadafacin  
Heaven knows that on the case  
How could I forget to mention the bicycle  
  
Somebody told the world  
The beauty of your verse  
My girl I heard it first  
The beauty of your verse  
  
A sticky finger and a wicked taste  
Gotta a lot of nerve and a lyrical case  
Be sure to write it in your book  
I promise not to look  
I wanna smell your sunny face  
Funny place but its never a waste  
Id hop this fence to make amends  
I hope this movie never ends  
  
How could I forget to mention the bicycle is a good invention  
Make it up makin you my business  
A funny buttercup got a liver forgiveness  
Happy days but sadafacin  
Heaven knows that Im on the case  
How could I forget to mention the bicycle  
  
Somebody told the world  
The beauty of your verse  
My girl I heard it first  
The beauty of your verse  
  
Somebody told the world  
The beauty of your verse  
My girl I heard it first  
The beauty of your verse
