Theres a new kind of music going round  
Its known as the boogie grass sound  
So grab her partner and swing her around  
And dance to the boogie grass sound  
I love to hear Bill sing about Kentucky  
And the Allman Brothers Rambling Man  
We pulled the music all together  
So dance to the boogie grass band  
Well my daddy played the banjo and saws the fiddle too  
And taught me how to sing and play for you  
I got bluegrass in my soul and rhythm in my feet  
And dance to the boogie grass beat  
I love to hear Bill sing about Kentucky  
And the Allman Brothers Rambling Man  
We pulled the music all together  
So dance to the boogie grass band  
I love to hear Bill sing about Kentucky  
And the Allman Brothers Rambling Man  
We pulled the music all together  
So dance to the boogie grass band
