Tearing down tearing down tearing  
I know the rhythm of the music  
I see the beat in the dark  
Emotion got me where Im with him  
Its so hard to get to your heart  
Fascination you know it brought me to you  
Satisfaction makes me want to  
Want to start by tearing down the walls  
Tearing down the walls around your heart  
Tearing down the walls  
Tearing down the walls around your heart  
I know Im only getting so close  
I see youre up on your guard  
Secrets I wanna get to know those  
Cause down deep Im after your heart  
All Im giving is some good oldfashioned love  
Wanna give it all to ya  
I wanna give to ya prove it to you  
Let me start by tearing down the walls  
Tearing down the walls around your heart  
Tearing down the walls  
Tearing down the walls around your heart  
Oh tearing down  
Wanna take the time to show ya  
Really wanna get to know ya  
Oh tearing down  
Let me start by tearing down the walls  
Tearing down the walls around your heart  
Tearing down the walls  
Tearing down the walls around your heart  
Tearing down tearing down tearing  
Fascination you know it brought me to you oh  
Satisfaction makes me want to  
Want to start by tearing down the walls  
Tearing down the walls around your heart  
Tearing down the walls  
Tearing down the walls around your heart
