Verse  
I was bored in a Fjord  
And I curse the heart and soul of Scandinavia  
Let the people burn  
Let their children cry and die in blind asylums  
  
PreChorus  
But then you came along  
And you held out your hand  
And I fell in love with you and Scandinavia  
  
Chorus  
I kiss the soil  
I eat the soil  
I hug the soil  
And I praise the God who made you  
Stop me in your own time in Scandinavia  
Unprotesting Ill die in Scandinavia  
  
Verse  
Into a crime in Trondheim  
I despise each syllable in Scandinavia  
Let the people burn  
Let their children cry and die in blind asylums  
  
PreChorus  
But then you came along  
And you held out your hand  
And I fell in love with you and Scandinavia  
  
Chorus  
I kiss the soil  
I eat the soil  
I hug the soil  
And I praise the God who made you  
Stop me in your own time in Scandinavia  
Are we happy to die In Scandinavia
