Remember when we were first falling in love  
How we planned all the things we would do  
Beautiful days and the nights all ablaze  
Hoping our dreams would come true  
Love was new  
Remember the house at the top of the hill  
How the sunlight caressed all the trees  
I played all my music I sang you my love  
The chiming church bells rode the breeze  
Love was new  
Time has a way of obscuring our memories  
And good times are hard to recall  
Basic survival and day to day living  
Leaves no time for romance at all  
I just wanted to say Im still falling in love  
Every day with you every day  
Remember that Christmas with just a few friends  
And the whole town was covered with snow  
We laughed and we loved as we skied in the sun  
It seems such a long time ago  
Love was new  
Something you said one night started me thinking  
How sweet love is as it begins  
Taken for granted it slips through your fingers  
And leaves you on needles and pins  
But there aint no way baby that wed let that happen  
Our love will always be new  
I just wanted to say Im still falling in love  
Every day with youfalling in love every day with you
