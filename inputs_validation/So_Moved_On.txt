I woke today felt another way  
Everything was gonna be fine  
My head rose up then my legs came too  
Quarter past nine was the time  
  
I used to lose floating memories found myself  
Wishing Id remember old times  
But I woke today  
Felt another way  
  
Felt free in the sky to fly  
I stepped out the door didnt know what for  
I saw my lady walking along  
I could have cried out what I wanted to say  
  
But I am sick of all this terrible charm  
I used to be into apologies a regular to shame I  
Was shy  
But I woke today  
  
Felt another way  
Felt free in the sky to fly  
Well Im through the gate got to my house about  
A quarter to eight  
  
And I made a drink got about an hour to relax and  
Just think  
Im just bored nothings ever gonna be the same  
Anymore  
  
And with my drink in hand I got up to stand and I  
Was off to a regular day  
The morning dragged on I was walking along  
Missing pieces fell to the ground  
  
Apparently I could not see  
But I saw everything going down  
So I packed my bags and I was on my way  
I feel a little different in a different way  
  
But like I said when I got out of bed I was off to a  
Regular day  
I could not hide I wore my pride  
It felt good to be on the run  
  
The air quality was something new to me and I got  
Along fine with the sun  
And when I rest my heard and I lay down to bed  
I put the pieces down with the blame  
  
And if all goes well at the morning bell  
Ill wake feeling free just the same  
Well Im through the gate got to my house about  
A quarter to eight  
  
And I made a drink got about an hour to relax and  
Just think  
Im just bored nothings ever gonna be the same  
Anymore  
  
And with my drink in hand I got up to stand and I  
Was off to a regular day
