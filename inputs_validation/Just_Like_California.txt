Just like California was not even there  
Since its gone Im so withdrawn I aint got no one nowhere  
Right beside the ocean my darlin Clementine  
Well the water got high and she never got dry and she was a water sign  
Time is on my bad side  
Halfway there just wouldnt be fair  
So Im goin all the way tonight  
Halfway there just wouldnt be fair  
So Im goin all the way tonight  
Just like California to make a fool of me  
Steal the sideshow burn the disco slide into the sea  
Im a thinking person and I think that its wrong  
To keep on saying true loves waiting when true love is long gone  
Time is on my bad side  
Halfway there just wouldnt be fair  
So Im goin all the way tonight  
Halfway there just wouldnt be fair  
So Im goin all the way tonight  
Halfway there just wouldnt be fair  
So Im goin all the way tonight
