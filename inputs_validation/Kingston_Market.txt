Have you ever seen a rainbow  
Or a garden blooming bright  
Heard the shuffle of a thousand feet  
And drums from morning til night  
  
Come we go down come we go down  
Come we go down to Kingston market  
Come we go down come we go down  
Down to Kingston market  
  
Get your tamarind and sour sop  
Mangoes and casaba  
Bread fruit okra pigeon peas  
Curry goat and guava  
  
Come we go down come we go down  
Come we go down to Kingston market  
Come we go down come we go down  
Down to Kingston market  
  
Do you know a brown skin maiden  
With sunshine in her eyes  
Heard the swallow and the humming bird  
Sing happy as she goes by  
  
Come we go down come we go down  
Come we go down to Kingston market  
Come we go down come we go down  
Down to Kingston market  
  
Have you seen the ghost of Morgan  
Or heard a tale you hadnt ought to  
Have you welcomed the coming dawn  
With a rum an cocoanut water  
  
Come we go down come we go down  
Come we go down to Kingston market  
Come we go down come we go down  
Down to Kingston market
