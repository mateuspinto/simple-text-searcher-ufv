Did you really think that  
I would really take you back  
Let you back in my heart  
One more time oh no no  
  
Did you think Id still care  
That thered be more feeling there  
Did you think you could walk back  
In my life oh  
  
So you found you missed the love you threw away  
Baby but you found it out too late too late  
  
Chorus  
And so you know the way it feels to cry  
The way that I cried when you broke my world in two  
And baby I learned the way to break a heart  
I learned from the best I learned from you  
Oh baby now I learned from you  
  
I remember cold nights  
Tears I thought would never dry  
How you shattered my world  
With your goodbye your goodbye  
  
Would a sold my soul then  
Just to have you back again  
Now you are the last thing on my mind  
  
Now you say youre sorry and youve  
Changed your ways  
Sorry but you changed your ways too late  
  
Chorus  
  
So when all youve got are sleepless night  
When those tears are clouding up your eyes  
Just remember it was you  
Who said goodbye who said goodbye  
  
Chorus  
  
I learned from the best  
I learned from you
