Its like an ocean tide  
Slowly washing my shores away  
Its like the sun above  
Now sooner or later  
Ill have to face that way  
  
Now she asks me how youre doing  
And I tell her youre getting by  
But its pain and numbness  
Side by side  
  
You came on the scene  
Like a star in the northern night  
She spread her love to you  
Like the warmth of a southern sky  
  
And so it goes on  
You know its night and day  
One always slips away  
Theres no one left to blame  
  
Love falls down you know and your  
And your heart falls to pieces  
And your soul might get lost along the way  
  
And all these songs  
They used to make you shine  
They are just lullabies for your nightmares  
I dont want to shed your tears  
  
I followed you northern star  
And I shared the fall with you  
Now I felt the cold glow of the sunset  
And I saw that liars moon  
  
Some of us will come down to earth  
Some of us will burn  
Loves not always as bright as it should be  
Tell me do you want to be free  
  
Well your love falls down you know  
And your heart might fall to pieces  
And I saw your soul get lost along the way  
  
All these songs now they used to make you shine  
They are just lullabies for your nightmares  
And Ill sing them softly now  
  
Lately Ive felt the warmth  
Of the one who tore down my walls  
But then I look at you  
And your twilight consumes it all it does  
  
Now I wished upon your falling star  
Praying I wont fall that hard  
And that my love is all it seems to be  
Because Ill swear it set me free  
  
But emily I gotta tell you I understand I understand  
When your love flies away well honesty  
Thats about the best you can the best you can do  
But arent you empty inside  
Arent you  
  
Falling star
