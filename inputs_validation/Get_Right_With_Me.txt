I will have faith in man  
That is hard to understand  
Show some humility  
You have the ability  
Get right with me  
Friends if youve lost your way  
You will find it again some day  
Come down from your pedestals  
And open your mouths thats all  
Get right with me  
Life is such a short thing  
That I cannot comprehend  
But if this life were a bought thing  
There are ways I know wed mend  
People take my advice  
Already told you once once or twice  
Dont waste your energy  
Making apologies  
Get right with me
