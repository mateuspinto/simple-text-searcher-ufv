Chorus  
She called up  
And gave me the news  
It made me so sad sad sad  
There was nothing I could do  
  
Shes too far away  
And you had to leave  
I can never repay you now  
For what you gave to me  
  
A whisper that can blow a chasm wide  
It took us all  
It took us all  
Pushed apart the mountains and the tide  
It took us all  
  
Chorus  
  
I was so lost  
In delirious sleep  
Wasnt prepared for that position  
Yeah maybe I was naive  
  
The truth is a mortal blow  
You know all there is to know  
The hurt that you have so close  
Is something better now  
  
And she called  
  
And she called up  
And gave me the news  
It made me so sad sad sad  
There was nothing I could do  
  
Shes too far away  
And you had to leave  
I can never repay you now  
For what you gave to me  
For what you gave to me  
  
She called up  
She called up  
She called up  
And gave me the news
