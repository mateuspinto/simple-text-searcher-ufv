My eyes are on the road  
But my mind is on your body  
My hand is on the stick shift  
And your hand is on my hand  
  
My eyes are on the road  
But my mind is on your body  
My hand is on the stick shift  
And your hand is on my hand  
  
Well push me honey to the up and right  
Weve been waiting but were next in line  
I said the stick shift push it to the up and right  
Weve been waiting but were next in line  
  
City in the rear view  
And nothing in the distance  
We laugh at all the talk  
What do you think of getting lost  
What do you think of you and me  
This lion is in the garden  
Lets go way back when  
Before this ever started  
Well push me honey to the up and right  
Weve been waiting but were next in line  
I said the stick shift push it to the up and right  
Weve been waiting but were next in line  
  
When the city shines like the sun at night  
And I feel it in my heart and my hips I feel it  
Wont you stay shot gun until the day I die  
Stay shotgun until the day I die  
  
Ill stay by you  
Ill stay by you oh oh  
Ill stay by you  
Ill stay by you oh oh  
  
Well push me honey to the up and right  
Weve been waiting but were next in line  
I said the stick shift push it to the up and right  
Weve been waiting but were next in line  
  
When the city shines like the sun at night  
And I feel it in my heart and my hips I feel it  
Wont you stay shot gun until the day I die  
Stay shotgun until the day I die  
  
Why dont you stay shotgun until the day I die  
Why dont you stay shotgun until the day I die  
Why dont you stay shotgun until the day I day I  
Why dont you stay shotgun until the day I die
