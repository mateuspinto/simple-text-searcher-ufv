Find you in the dark  
Read you like a cheap surprise  
Without shame  
Sell me out and frame your name  
I can hear when the pig whispers sweetly  
Jealousy is the weapon you kill me  
Keep a dime for a truth you might tell  
You toed the line and I know it was mine  
Couldnt hide write a wave ride a lie  
Let me know can I friend ask you why  
  
Rolling back the days  
With my friend I love to play  
The little one  
Superman with silver gun  
  
I can hear when the pig whispers sweetly  
Jealousy is the weapon you kill me  
Keep a dime for a truth you might tell  
  
Wait for me take a dive take a piece of my life  
leave me numb  
Wait for me tell a lie try to take my life  
leave me numb  
Wait for me take a dive take a piece of my life  
leave me numb  
Close to me and Ill leave you numb
