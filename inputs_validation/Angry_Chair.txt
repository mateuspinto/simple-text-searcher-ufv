Sitting on an angry chair  
Angry walls that steal the air  
Stomach hurts and I dont care  
  
What do I see across the way hey  
See myself molded in clay oh  
Stares at me yeah Im afraid heeey  
Changing the shape of his face ooh yeah  
  
Candles red I have a pair  
Shadows dancing everywhere  
Burning on the angry chair  
  
Little boy made a mistake hey  
Pink cloud has now turned to gray oh  
All that I want is to play hey  
Get on your knees time to pray oh  
  
I dont mind yeah  
I dont mind aaah  
I dont mind yeah  
I dont mind aaah  
Lost my mind yeah  
I dont mind aaah  
Cant find it anywhere  
I Dont mind aaah  
  
Corporate prison we stay hey  
Im a dull boy work all day ooh  
So Im strung out anyway heey  
  
GUITAR SOLO  
  
Loneliness is not a phase  
Field of pain is where I graze  
Serenity is far away  
  
Saw my reflection and cried heey  
So little hope that I died oh  
Feed me your lies open wide heey  
Weight of my heart not the size oh  
  
I dont mind yeah  
I dont mind aaah  
I dont mind yeah  
I dont mind aaah  
Lost my mind yeah  
I dont mind  
Cant find it anywhere  
I Dont mind aaah  
  
Pink cloud has now turned to gray  
All that I want is to play  
Get on your knees time to pray boy
