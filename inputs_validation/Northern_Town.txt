In a Northern Town  
In a Northern Town  
We were getting down  
In a Northern Town  
We were getting down  
  
Having good times  
Having good good times  
In a Northern Town  
In a Northern Town  
  
Get together  
Have some good times baby  
Can you feel it  
  
Have a good time  
Good times coming to you  
Good times  
Good times  
  
I was dancing  
I was singing  
Good times  
  
In a Northern Town  
In a Northern Town  
We were getting down  
In a Northern Town  
We were getting down  
  
Having good times  
Having good good times  
In a Northern Town  
In a Northern Town  
  
Get together  
Have some good times baby  
Can you feel it  
  
All alone  
All alone  
But Im all alone now  
But Im all alone now  
  
Were good friends  
Having good times  
Yah yah  
Yah yah
