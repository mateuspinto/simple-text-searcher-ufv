God is able  
He will never fail  
He is almighty God  
Greater than all we seek  
Greater than all we ask  
He has done great things  
  
Lifted up  
He defeated the grave  
Raised to life  
Our God is able  
In His name  
We overcome  
For the Lord  
Our God is able  
  
God is with us  
God is on our side  
He will make a way  
Far above all we know  
Far above all we hope  
He has done great things  
  
Lifted up  
He defeated the grave  
Raised to life  
Our God is able  
In His name  
We overcome  
For the Lord  
Our God is able  
  
God is with us  
He will go before  
He will never leave us  
He will never leave us  
God is for us  
He has open arms  
He will never fail us  
He will never fail us  
  
Lifted up  
He defeated the grave  
Raised to life  
Our God is able  
In His name  
We overcome  
For the Lord  
Our God is able  
  
For the Lord  
Our God is able  
For the Lord  
Our God is able
