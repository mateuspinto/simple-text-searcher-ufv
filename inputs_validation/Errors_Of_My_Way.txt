I didnt know what day it was that day  
Felt just like falling down on my knees to pray  
Looked at myself and all that I could say  
WasI think I see the errors of my way  
  
There in the glass there was something caught my eye  
Although I try through my sighing not to cry  
See where I am and what I try to say  
Just so Ill look at the errors of my way  
  
Guess I got no one around to pull me through  
I just need someone to turn to yes I do  
Doin my best just to change my yesterday  
Then I wont have no more errors of my way
