I been locked out  
I been locked in  
But I always seem to come back again  
When youre in that room  
What do you do  
I know that I will have you in the end  
And the clouds they are crying on you  
And the birds are offering up their tunes  
In a shack as remote as a mansion  
You escape into a place where nothing moves  
And I been locked out  
And I know were through  
But I cant begin to face up to the truth  
I wait so long for the walls to crack  
But I know that I will one day have you back  
And the hills are as soft as a pillow  
And they cast a shadow on my bed  
And the view when I look through my window  
Is an altar piece Im praying to for the living and the dead  
Twin valley shines in the morning sun  
I send a message out to my only one  
I been locked out and I know were through  
But I cant begin to face up to the truth  
I wait so long for the walls to crack  
But I know that I will one day have you back  
And I work with the bees and the honey  
Every night I circle like the moon  
Its an act of simple devotion  
But it can take forever when youve got something to prove  
I been locked out
