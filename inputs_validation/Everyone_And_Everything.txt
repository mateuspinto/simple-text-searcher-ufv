I never said no  
I never said yes  
But now theres something  
I need to get off my chest  
Its a lot for me  
Its a lot for you  
I never could sound  
The way that I feel  
But now it doesnt matter  
Cuz this truth isnt real  
Are you fake to me  
Am I fake to me  
  
Chorus  
I wanted  
To be there  
Never taking time to  
Understand your reasons for this  
Take the time to talk it over  
This is what youre listening for  
Patiently  
You wait for me  
Never wanted any sympathy  
For what you did to me  
I hopefully will  
Be set free  
  
You never said no  
You never said yes  
But now theres something you  
Need to confess to me willingly  
Are we history  
I never rewind  
I never press play  
But I know that  
Ive seen it all too many  
Times for me  
Its our history  
  
Chorus  
  
Everyone is holding me back  
From my place am I displaced  
Because I couldnt see that  
Everyone is wasting my time  
And I will not wait for you  
Because that day will come when  
  
Everyone and everything is  
Pulling me out of my brain  
Everyone and everything is  
Pulling me out of my brain  
Maybe I should try and stay with you  
Everyone and everything is No matter what you say  
Pulling me out of my brain No matter what you say  
Maybe I should try and stay with you No matter what you say
