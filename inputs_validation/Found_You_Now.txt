I know that you already take as read  
I helped you  
You know the back of my hand  
  
I wish that we were enchanted  
Girl now I take it for granted  
  
Your love was starin me right in the heart  
Why does our pride make us weak  
While I was wonderin where to start  
You were there to show me  
All I had to learn  
  
You were way off the mark  
Most of it in the dark  
Found you now  
  
Tiny light give the peace  
With which we reach indecision  
I guess we lived in the meantime  
Till we remembered our first lines  
  
We must have missed a turn  
Still got a lot to learn  
Found you now  
  
So now we live a life of give and take  
Day by day  
We dont control where it leads us  
  
If we compare the first day we met  
I must admit nothings changed  
I recognize only one regret  
Life embarassments unexpressed  
  
Found you now  
Found you now
