Dashing through the snow In my rusty Chevrolet  
Down the road I go Sliding all the way  
I need new piston rings I need some new snow tires  
My car is held together By a piece of chicken wire  
  
Rust and smoke the heaters broke  
The door just blew away  
I light a match to see the dash  
And then I start to pray hey  
The frame is bent the muffler went  
But the radios OK  
Oh what fun it is to drive this rusty Chevrolet  
  
I went to the store To get some Christmas cheer  
I just passed up my left front tire and its getting  
Hard to steer  
Skidding down the highway Right past the county cops  
I had to drag my swampers To get the car to stop  
  
Rust and smoke the heaters broke  
  
The door just blew away  
I light a match to see the dash  
And then I start to pray hey  
The frame is bent the muffler went  
But the radios OK  
Oh what fun it is to drive this rusty Chevrolet  
  
Bouncing through the snow drifts In a big blue cloud of  
Smoke  
People laugh as I drive by I wonder whats the joke  
I got to get to WalMart To pick up the layaway  
Cause Santa Clause is coming soon In his big old rusty  
Sleigh  
  
Rust and smoke the heaters broke  
The door just blew away  
I light a match to see the dash  
And then I start to pray hey  
The frame is bent the muffler went  
But the radios OK  
Oh what fun it is to drive this rusty Chevrolet
