From a Jack to a King  
From loneliness to a wedding ring  
I played a Ace and I won a Queen  
An walked away with your heart  
  
From a Jack to a King  
With no regrets I stacked the cards last night  
And Lady Luck played her hand just right  
You made me King of your heart  
  
For just a little while I thought that I might lose again  
Then just in time I saw the twinkle in your eye  
  
From a Jack to a King  
From loneliness to a wedding ring  
I played a Ace and I won a Queen  
You made me King of your heart  
  
For just a little while I thought that I might lose again  
Then just in time I saw the twinkle in your eye  
  
From a Jack to a King  
From loneliness to a wedding ring  
I played a Ace and I won a Queen  
You made me King of your heart
