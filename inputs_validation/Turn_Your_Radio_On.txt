TURN YOUR RADIO ON  
Writer Albert E Brumley  
Come and listen in to a radio station where the mighty host of Heaven sing  
Turn your radio on turn your radio on turn your radio on turn your radio
on  
If you want to want to hear the songs of Zion  
Coming from the land of endless spring  
Get in touch with God get in touch with God  
Turn your radio on turn your radio on  
Chorus  
Turn your radio on turn your radio on  
And listen to the music in the air  
Turn your radio on turn your radio on  
And glory to share glory share  
Turn the lights down low lights down low  
And listen to the Masters Radio  
Get in touch with God get in touch with God  
Turn your radio on  
Brother listen in to the gloryland chorus  
Listen to the glad hosannahs roll  
Turn your radio on turn your radio on  
Turn your radio on turn your radio on  
Get a little taste of joys awaiting  
Get a little Heaven in your soul  
Get in touch with God get in touch with God  
Turn your radio on  
Chorus  
Turn your radio on turn your radio on  
And listen to the music in the air  
Turn your radio on turn your radio on  
And glory to share glory share  
Turn the lights down low lights down low  
And listen to the Masters Radio  
Get in touch with God get in touch with God  
Turn your radio on  
Listen to the songs of the fathers and the mothers  
And the many friends gone on before  
Turn your radio on turn your radio on  
Turn your radio on turn your radio on  
Some eternal morning we shall meet them  
Over on the Hallelujah Shore  
Get in touch with God get in touch with God  
Turn your radio on turn your radio on  
Chorus  
Turn your radio on turn your radio on  
And listen to the music in the air  
Turn your radio on turn your radio on  
And glory to share glory share  
Turn the lights down low lights down low  
And listen to the Masters Radio  
Get in touch with God get in touch with God  
Turn your radio on
