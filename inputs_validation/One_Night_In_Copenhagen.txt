When the drugs hit you  
Tingly begins  
Conviction plus tone equals hope  
Under the threat of separation  
The nadirs fluorescent  
The shriek of a gull  
Suspended in air  
The sound of the sea  
Anywhere anywhere  
When the drugs quit you  
As loyal as a fruit fly youll mutter to yourself  
You talentless fuck good fucking luck  
Good fucking luck  
A delicatessen  
The shriek of a horn  
Suspended in air  
The sound of the town  
Anywhere anywhere  
It quits you in situ here it begins  
Quits you at a pay phone in the snow  
One night in Copenhagen  
One night in Copenhagen  
You know the nadirs fluorescent  
The shriek of a gull  
Suspended in air  
The sound of the town  
Anywhere anywhere  
Anywhere
