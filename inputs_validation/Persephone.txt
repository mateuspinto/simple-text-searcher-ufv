Theres a light that shines on Persephone  
Always a fire in her eyes  
And the last time that I went to her  
I could tell things werent right  
  
I just dont care to see your years go wasting  
Theres no longer magic in your eyes  
  
In your time you could outshine everybody else around  
But your offstage ways might be a bore   
You take a bow you take a fall  
  
I came to be here in the footlights  
To live with you through every song  
And your face displays a peaceful field  
I cant believe the curtain has to fall  
  
Now I know your years were never wasted  
Tonight I saw the magic in your eyes
