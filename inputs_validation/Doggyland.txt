Chorus  
Come and go with me to Doggyland  
Here ye Here ye Come one come all  
To a place that be call it LBC  
Im ridin with ya baby  
Come and go with me to Doggyland  
To a place that be call it LBC  
  
Now if you tired of the hard work  
Tears and sweat  
And you breakin your neck  
And you still up in debt  
Walkin round town all strapped in  
Niggas be havin more bad times than Captain Rat did  
Two strikes none left out of breath  
Livin in the city its a jungle yo  
All this deception on top of stress  
You havin more problems than a algebra test  
You cant seem to come up wit yo money for rent  
And now yo baby momma trippin she want fifty percent  
Its a thin line between yours and mine  
The difference is you gotta scratch to a get nickel and dime  
Now I know a place where  
Ya might wanna be and I can take you there  
Pop goes the nine Well go right behind  
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh your homies think youre funny  
Doin stick ups for moneys  
Just to impress the honeys This is for the honeys  
Got yo rocks so you keepem in the sack  
You got two strikes but you right back up to bat  
You all about yo money and got something to sell  
But if you bail for a robber youll be back in the jail cell  
You chillin with yo feet up  
Someone hated but baby without the homies and  
Thats when you got beat up  
Because you cant be out there doin low  
And then right gather up yo crew and roll  
Aint no rules when you out there doin dirt  
Somebodys always layin in the cut to get ya hurt  
But see I know a place where  
You might wanna be  
And I can take you there  
Pop goes the nine Well go right behind  
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline  
  
Chorus  
  
Here ye Here ye come one come all  
To a place that be call it LBC  
Im ridin wit ya baby  
Lemme holla to a little home boy real quick  
Know what Im sayin  
Cause he travelin in the fast lane  
  
Stop the life it seem that we are on  
Time to slow your roll  
Let Doggyland be your new home  
Stop the life it seem that we are on  
Time to slow your roll  
Let Doggyland be your new home  
  
Doggyland is the town where its goin dizowne  
Its goin down  
Everything is free  
And aint no HIV What  
And niggas dont kill one another  
Oh really why is that  
Because a brother is a brother  
And what about the mothers  
They queens  
Righteous  
Man  
Heaven must be like this  
Green aroma like the grass in the summertime  
Aint no penitentiaries and aint nobody doin time  
And oh yeah Im the big OKer  
Im smarter than the senator  
Bigger than the mayor  
Heaven on Earth  
Its like a prayer  
And you cant get in without yo gold card you got  
To be a player  
Now you know a place where  
You gots to be and I took you there  
Pop goes the nine well go right behind  
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline
