I guess youre surprised to see me back in Louisville  
After all that talk about goin up north to make my kill  
Why people in Toronto fell in love with me  
But you know how I am that night life just wont let me be

I got away clean I didnt leave a thing but a ring around the tub  
And up in Brandon Manitoba I left thirteen empty jugs

Well old Tom taught me how to stomp a tune or two  
I hung around awhile and I got those Sudbury blues  
They told me that I oughta look out for those northern lights  
Thats a good excuse to sleep all day and stay up every night

Gordon introduced me to a folk or two some I hadnt met and some that I
already knew  
Well Im goin back as soon as I can raise the cash  
Cause Canada is not a place that I wanna had in my past
