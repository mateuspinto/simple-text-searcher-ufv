Cant get enough of this everyday love  
Cant get enough of this everyday love  
  
Each morning the sun shines through my window  
Lands on the face of a dream come true  
I shuffle to the kitchen for my coffee  
And catch up on the front page morning news  
Then she walks up behind me and throws her arms around my neck  
Just another normal thing Ive come to expect  
  
Its ordinary plain and simple  
Typical this everyday love  
Same ol same ol keeping it new  
Same ol this everyday love  
Emotional so familiar  
Nothing about it too peculiar  
Oh but I cant get enough  
Of this everyday love  
  
Every afternoon I make a phone call  
Listen to the voice that warms my heart  
I drag myself through a few more hours  
Then head on home to try and beat the dark  
Her smile will be right there when I step through that door  
And it will be that way tomorrow just like everyday before  
  
Its ordinary plain and simple  
Typical this everyday love  
Same ol same ol keeping it new  
Same ol this everyday love  
Emotional so familiar  
Nothing about it too peculiar  
Oh but I cant get enough  
Of this everyday love  
  
Wouldnt change one single thing about it  
No its runofthemill still I cant live without it  
  
Its ordinary plain and simple  
Typical this everyday love  
Same ol same ol keeping it new  
Same ol this everyday love  
Emotional so familiar  
Nothing about it too peculiar  
Oh but I cant get enough  
Of this everyday love  
  
Yeah of this everyday love  
Cant get enough of this everyday love  
Cant get enough of this everyday love  
Cant get enough of this everyday love  
Cant get enough of this everyday love  
Cant get enough
