I heard my brother weepin in the dead of the night  
I said Dude man you feelin alright  
Gener said nothin and continued to weep  
I caught Papa Gene Ween cryin in his sleep  
  
I saw Gener cryin in his sleep  
I tried to wake him up but he made not a peep  
I saw Gener cryin in his sleep  
  
You fucked it up again  
  
Life at the top can be tough  
Sometimes you think youve seen enough  
But you can find a diamond in the rough  
But when its time for bed you shouldnt think about that stuff  
  
Yeah I saw Gener cryin in his sleep  
I tried to wake him up but he made not a peep  
I saw Gener cryin in his sleep  
  
I saw Gener cryin in his sleep  
I tried to wake him up but he made not a peep  
I saw Gener cryin in his sleep
