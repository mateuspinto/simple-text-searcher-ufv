Looking for a new kind of lover  
Not a girl made of rubber  
Someone who can make me feel how I wanna feel  
And tell me all the things that I wanna hear  
And make me lose control  
And make me go insane  
I want a girl that does cocaine  
  
Cocaine cocaine  
  
Screwed up is how she needs to be  
With no clue of reality  
I just want you to make me feel how I wanna feel  
And tell me all the things that I wanna hear  
And make me lose control  
And make me go insane  
I want a girl that does cocaine  
  
Cocaine  
  
And now Im washed up  
Ive had my fun  
And I feel like the mud  
  
Its that girl who can make me feel how I wanna feel  
And tell me all the things that I wanna hear  
And make me lose control  
And make me go insane  
Youre that girl who does cocaine  
  
She left me for a snowman named bob
