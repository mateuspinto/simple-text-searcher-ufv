Brown baby  
Brown baby  
As you grow up  
I want you to drink from the plenty cup  
I want you to stand up  
Tall and proud  
I want you to speak up  
Speak up clear and cloud  
  
Brown baby  
Brown baby  
As years roll by  
Walk with your head held high  
I want you to live by  
Live by the justice code  
I want you to walk down  
Walk down the freedom road  
  
Brown baby  
Brown baby  
Now baby  
Lie away  
Lie away sleeping  
Lie away here in my arms  
While your mommy and daddy protect you  
And keep you save from harm  
  
Brown baby  
Brown baby  
It makes me so glad  
That you will have things  
Ive never had  
When out of mens hearts  
All the hate is hurled  
Youre gonna live  
Youre gonna live in a better world  
  
Brown baby  
Mmammamama  
Brown baby  
Mmammamama  
Sweet thing  
Lie away sleeping
