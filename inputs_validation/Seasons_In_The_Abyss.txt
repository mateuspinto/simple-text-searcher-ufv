Razors edge  
Outlines the dead  
Incisions in my head  
Anticipation the stimulation  
To kill the exhilaration  
  
Close your eyes  
Look deep in your soul  
Step outside yourself a  
And let your mind go  
Frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die  
  
Close your eyes  
And forget your name  
Step outside yourself  
And let your thoughts drain  
As you go insane insane  
  
Inert flesh  
A bloody tomb  
A decorated splatter brightens the room  
An execution a sadist ritual  
Mad intervals of mind residuals  
  
Close your eyes  
Look deep in your soul  
Step outside yourself  
And let your mind go  
Frozen eyes stare deep in your mind as you die  
  
Close your eyes and forget your name  
Step outside yourself and let your thoughts drain  
As you go insane insane  
  
Innate seed  
To watch you bleed  
A demanding physical need  
Desecrated eviscerated  
Times perpetuated
