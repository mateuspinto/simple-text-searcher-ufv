Restless little one  
Comfortable and warm  
Let me fall apart  
Crippled in your arms  
  
Chase me through the dark  
Ready on your mark  
First to reach the stars  
Wins a broken heart  
One that broke apart  
Shattered from the start  
  
Are you there  
Do you read me  
Are you there  
I dont feel you anymore  
  
Cages and alarms  
Keeping us from harm  
I will be the guard  
Hope to rest upon  
  
Could I be the one  
To break a will so strong  
Pray it wont be long  
Til your will is gone  
Everything is done  
Nothing left at all  
  
Are you there  
Do you read me  
Are you there  
I dont feel you anymore  
  
Are you there  
Will you give in  
Are you there  
If I give out  
Over and out  
  
Cages and alarms  
Keeping us from harm  
I will be the guard  
Hope to rest upon  
Everything is done  
Nothing left at all  
  
Are you there  
Do you read me  
Are you there  
I dont feel you anymore  
  
Are you there  
Will you give in  
Are you there  
If I give out
