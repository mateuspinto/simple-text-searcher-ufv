Barbara allan to bill and anne mulloy of calgary alberta  
It was in and about the martinmas time  
When the green leaves were a fallin  
That sir john graeme o the west countree  
Fell in love wi barbara allan  
He sent his men down thro the town  
To the place where she was dwellin  
O haste and come to my master dear  
Gin ye be barbara allan  
O hooly hooly rose she up  
To the place where he was lyin  
And when she drew the curtain by  
Young man I think yer dyin  
Oh its I am sick and very very sick  
And its a for barbara allan  
O the better for me ye se never be  
Tho your hearts blood be spillin  
Remember ye not in the tavern sir  
When ye the cups were fillin  
How ye made the healths gae round and round  
And slighted barbara allan  
He turned his face unto the wa  
And death was with him dealin  
Adieu adieu my dear friands a  
Be kind tae barbara alan  
Then hooly hooly raise she up  
And slowly slowly left him  
And sighing said she could not stay  
Since death olife had reft him  
She hadnae gone a mile but twa  
When she heard the deid bell knellin  
And every jow tha the deid bell gied  
Cried woe tae barbara allan  
O mother mother make my bed  
O make it fast and narrow  
Since my love died for me today  
I die for him tomorrow
