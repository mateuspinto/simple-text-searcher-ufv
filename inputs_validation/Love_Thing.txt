Saw you there so confused  
I knew that I could make my move now  
Treading softly I walked over you  
We talked about this thing called love  
Saw your eyes open wide  
And I knew your heart was in it  
Let me take you there  
Let me take you there tonight  
  
Get on board get on my love thing  
Gonna drive you wild  
I want to show you I want to hear you sing  
Baby we got a love thing right now  
  
Close your eyes follow me  
Ill show you a world youve never been to  
Take a ride in my love machine  
And I wont do anything you cant get into  
What Ive got is what you need  
And you wont do a thing about it  
Let me take you there  
Let me take you there tonight  
  
Get on board get on my love thing  
Gonna drive you wild  
I want to show you I want to hear you sing  
Baby we got a love thing right now  
  
I never want you to go  
I always want you to stay  
So come on baby come on now
