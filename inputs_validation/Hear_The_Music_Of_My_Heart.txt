Lord hear the music of my heart  
Hear all the pourings of my soul  
Songs telling of a life of love  
Jesus this is all for you  
Youve become the ruler of my heart  
Youve become the lover of my soul  
Youve become the saviour of this life  
You are everything to me  
Oh now jesus jesus I will pour my praise on you  
Gonna worship worship  
Demonstarte my love for you  
May I come to be a blessing to your heart  
Jesus jesus who can tell how wonderful you are  
How wonderful you are  
Oh how wonderful you are x3  
Youre the healer  
Youre the teacher  
Youre the true and living one  
Youre my hope now and my glory  
Youre the lifter of my head  
Youre the first your the last  
Youre the birght and morining star  
Oh how how how wonderful you are
