I met you on a midway at a fair last year  
And you stood out like a ruby in a black mans ear  
You were playing on the horses you were playing on the guitar strings  
You were playing like a devil wearing wings wearing wings  
You looked so grand wearing wings  
Do you tape them to your shoulders just to sing  
Can you fly  
I heard you can Can you fly  
Like an eagle doin your hunting from the sky  
  
I followed with the sideshows to another town  
And I found you in a trailer on the camping grounds  
You were betting on some lover you were shaking up the dice  
And I thought I saw you cheating once or twice once or twice  
  
I heard your bid once or twice  
Were you wondering was the gamble worth the price  
Pack it in  
I heard you did Pack it in  
Was it hard to fold a hand you knew could win  
  
So lately youve been hiding it was somewhere in the news  
And Im still at these races with my ticket stubs and my blues  
And a voice calls out the numbers and it sometimes mentions mine  
And I feel like Ive been working overtime overtime  
  
Ive lost my fire overtime  
Always playin one more hand for one more dime  
Slowin down Im gettin tired  
Slowin down  
And I envy you the valley that youve found  
Cause Im midway down the midway  
Slowin down down down down
