THE KIDS LAST FIGHT  
WRITER BOB MERRILL  
It was Tiger Wilson versus Kid McCoy In the summer of ninetythree Now the
Kid was everybodys pride and joy Just as game as a kid could be And his
darlin Bess was in the second row She was prayin with all her might Sayin
Kid we need that little bungalow Oh youve just gotta win tonight Come on
Kid come on Kid Lets hit him with a left and a right Go on Kid go on Kid
But how were they to know it was the Kids last fight But how were they to
know it was the Kids last fight Now the Kid had fever to the very bone But
nobody would ever guess He was in there fightin on his heart alone Cause he
just had to win for Bess Oh the Kid was battered the Kid was floored But the
count never got to ten Though his brain was reelin when the people roared He
was up on his feet again Come on Kid come on Kid Lets hit him with a left
and a right Go on Kid go on Kid But how were they to know it was the Kids
last fight But how were they to know it was the Kids last fight Said the
Tiger scowlin dont you know youre through I can whip you just like a
child Im gonna take the fight and take your woman too When he heard that the
Kid went wild Said the Kid For that Ill tear you limb from limb And he
sprang like an angry colt He said a punch aflyin at the Tigers chin Knocked
him out like a thunderbolt Come on Kid come on Kid Lets hit him with a
left and a right Go on Kid go on Kid But how were they to know it was the
Kids last fight But how were they to know it was the Kids last fight To
the crowd that saw it there was little doubt That the Kid was a champ that
night But the champ would never have another bout Twas the fever that won the
fight Gather round Im bettin even money folks Theres a bell soundin way
up high And the champ is climbin through the golden ropes Of the Big Ring up
in the sky Come on Kid come on Kid Lets hit him with a left and a right Go
on Kid go on Kid But how were they to know it was the Kids last fight
