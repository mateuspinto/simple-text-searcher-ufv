Here it comes again  
Cannot out run my desire  
Cover my decent  
And throw the  
Beauty on the fire  
Drawn towards the edge  
Do I assume I could fly  
Every secret shared  
Why do I drink  
The feelings dry  
Dont go too far  
Limitation scars  
  
Tonight  
Could I be lost forever  
To drown  
My soul in  
Sensory  
Pleasure  
Sensory  
Pleasure  
  
Here it comes again  
You raise the bar even higher  
I cannot catch my breath  
So throw the  
Beauty on the fire  
Dont push too hard  
Limitaion scars
