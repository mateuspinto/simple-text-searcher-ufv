Im accustomed to a smooth ride  
Or maybe Im a dog whos lost its bite  
I dont expect to be treated like a fool no more  
I dont expect to sleep through the night  
Some people say a lies a lies a lie  
But I say why  
Why deny the obvious child  
Why deny the obvious child  
  
And in remembering a road sign  
I am remembering a girl when I was young  
And we said these songs are true  
These days are ours  
These tears are free  
And hey  
The cross is in the ballpark  
The cross is in the ballpark  
  
We had a lot of fun  
We had a lot of money  
We had a little son and we thought wed call him Sonny  
Sonny gets married and moves away  
Sonny has a baby and bills to pay  
Sonny gets sunnier  
Day by day by day by day  
  
Ive been waking up at sunrise  
Ive been following the light across my room  
I watch the night receive the room of my day  
Some people say the sky is just the sky  
But I say  
Why deny the obvious child  
Why deny the obvious child  
  
Sonny sits by the window and thinks to himself  
How its strange that some roots are like cages  
Sonnys yearbook from high school  
Is down on the shelf  
And he idle thumbs through the pages  
Some have died  
Some have fled from themselves  
Or struggled from here to get there  
Sonny wanders beyond his interior walls  
Runs his hands through his thinning brown hair  
Im accustomed to a smoother ride  
Or maybe Im a dog whos lost its bite  
I dont expect to be treated like a fool no more  
I dont expect to sleep the night  
Some people say a lie is just a lie  
But I say  
The cross is in the ballpark  
Why deny the obvious child
