You know it  
You show it  
And the time has come  
To shoot you down  
What a sound  
When the day is done  
And it all works out  
  
Id love to do it and you know youve always had it coming  
  
You know it  
You show it  
And the time has come  
To shoot you down  
What a sound  
When the day is done  
And it all works out  
  
Id love to do it and you know youve always had it coming  
  
I never wanted  
The love that you showed me  
It started to choke me  
And how I wish Id said  
No too slow  
I couldnt take  
That too fast  
I want you to know  
  
You know it  
You show it  
But I cant back down  
Its far too late  
I cant wait  
Now the time has come  
Itll all work out  
And when this  
Thing is done  
Itll leave no doubt  
So when youve  
Had your fun  
Will you all walk out   
  
Id love to do it and you know youve always had it coming  
Id love to do it and you know youve always had it coming  
Id love to do it and you know youve always had it coming
