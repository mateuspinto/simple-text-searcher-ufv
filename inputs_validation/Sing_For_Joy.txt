Sing for joy to God our strength  
Sing for joy to God our strength our strength  
  
If we call to Him He will answer us  
If we run to Him He will run to us  
If we lift our hands He will lift us up  
Come now praise his name all you saints of God  
  
Draw near to Him he is here with us  
Give Him your love Hes in love with us  
He will heal our hearts He will cleanse our hands  
If we rend our hearts He will heal our land
