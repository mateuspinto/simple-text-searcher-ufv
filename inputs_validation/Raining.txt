First one in the city  
Wearin all those grass stained jeans  
Nothing is forgotten everyone is pleased  
Someone got his hair cut  
The girls have lots to say  
His friends had felt more comfortable  
With it worn the other way  
And I dont know if Ill see you again  
  
Next one at the old house  
Snow is on the ground  
Photographs and wine are passed around  
Someone toasts an absent friend  
Another takes his seat  
They gather round the dying fire  
But the circles not complete  
And I dont know if Ill see you again  
  
Last one by the highway  
Wind blows through thin smiles  
Someone made a wrong turn  
Missed a joke by miles  
Someone got their hair cut  
A tear in her eye  
But no one even comments   
Except to say goodbye  
And I dont know if Ill see you again
