female voice  
Hi ga Kureru  
Sore wa Toki no Mahou  
Asu Onaji Toki  
Mata Chigau Mahou  
Sore wa Iro ga Kaori ni  
Kaori ga Iro ni Kawaru Toki  
Soshite Kage wa Kagirinai  
Ao ni Tokeru  
  
The day falls into the twilight  
It is a magic of time  
The same time tomorrow  
therell be another magic  
It is when colors turn to flavors  
and flavors turn to colors  
And it is when  
shadows melt into deep blue
