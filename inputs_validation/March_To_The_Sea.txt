Theres miles of land in front of us  
And were dying with every step we take  
Were dying with every breath we make  
And all fall in line  
  
A strangers back is all I see  
Hes only a few feet in front of me  
And all look left and right sometimes  
But all fall in line  
  
No one looks up anymore  
Cause you might get a raindrop in your eye  
And heaven forbid they see you cry  
As we fall in line  
  
And about this time of every year  
The Line will go to the ocean pier  
And walk right off into the sea  
Then we fall asleep  
  
As we near the end of land  
And our ocean graves are just beyond the sand  
I ask myself the question why  
I fall in line  
  
Then out of the corner of my eye  
I see a spaceship in the sky  
And hear a voice inside my head  
Follow me instead2x  
  
Follow me  
  
Then the wages of war will start  
Inside my head with my counterpart  
And the emotionless marchers will chant the phrase  
This Line s the only way  
  
Then I start down the sand  
My eyes are focused on the end of land  
But again the voice inside my head  
Says Follow me instead  
  
Follow me instead  
  
Follow me  
  
Follow me instead4x  
  
Take me up Seal the door  
I dont want to march here anymore  
I realize that this Line is dead  
So Ill follow you instead  
  
So then you put me back in my place  
So I might start another day  
And once again I will be  
In a march to the sea
