As I walked by the lake one day by chance my Dorraine passed my way  
Then she and I walked hand in hand on the banks of Ponchartrain  
I pinned a flower on her heart I swore wed never be apart  
She vowed her love forever and as I kissed her did the same  
Dorraine my Dorraine my dark haired little angel  
My belle of Ponchartrain  
We sat down on the dock and with our hearts and fingers locked  
We laughed and talked and joked about when our names are the same  
And joking I said honey are you marrying me for money  
And it took just one quick look to tell it hurt my dear Dorraine  
She jumped and stood above me and she cried why you dont love me  
Im rowing home across the lake you wont see me again  
I called and called some more but she rowed fast from the shore  
And the clouds brought by a wind began to rain on Ponchartrain  
Dorraine I called Dorraine  
Come back my little angel my belle of Ponchartrain  
The storm should make her learn that she should make a swift return  
But as the rain fell harder I lost sight of my Dorraine  
As panic gripped my heart I drew the oars and made my start  
To look for her on raging waters and the rain on Ponchartrain  
At darkness I still called but no one heard my cries at all  
And when the daybreak came then others helped me look for my Dorraine  
But there was not a thing afloat except the oars from her rowboat  
For all was lost upon the choppy waves and rain on Ponchartrain  
Now I come day after day to where my sweetheart rowed away  
And I gaze across the water of the rainy Ponchartrain  
Just one thing and nothing more ever floated back to shore  
Was this flower I hold it is the one I pinned on my Dorraine  
Dorraine my Dorraine my dark haired little angel  
My belle of Ponchartrain
