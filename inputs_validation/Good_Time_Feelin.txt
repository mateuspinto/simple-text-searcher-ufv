Well Ive been around  
For a pretty good while  
Ive been on the move  
Since I was just a little baby child  
Been with Ive been with out  
Never been no doubt  
When that good time feelin comes around  
  
Well Ive got my temper just like you  
A little fussin and fightin well they aint nothing new  
But for a little while tonight everything gonna be all right  
When that good time feelin come around  
  
Well I cant get enough of that wonderful stuff  
Never felt so fine hey now drivin me out of my mind  
Somebody said it cant be done  
Were gonna mess around and have a little fun  
When that good time feelin comes around  
  
Break  
  
Well I cant get enough of that wonderful stuff  
Never felt so fine hey now drivin me out of my mind  
Someone said it cant be done  
Were gonna mess around and have a little fun  
When that good time feelin come around  
When that good time feelin come around  
When that good time feelin come around
