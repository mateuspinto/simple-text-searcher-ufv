You just saved my life  
Now this may not be what you had in mind  
Would you love me to death my dear  
Oh no no she said better alive than dead  
When are you gonna come home

Are you waiting for the end of the world

And be loved by the ones you love  
Its a senseless thing desire  
To be loved by everyone
