Some people say Im one of those guys with blessings in life overlooked  
Sometimes I feel like the tatter torn pages of some old paperback book  
All the places Ive played and the money Ive made  
Still Ive got nothing to show  
And the only thing that I have left in the whole wide world is you  
You put your whole life into somethin you love and you never get that one big
break  
Gotta take you out of the back street bars and put you on center stage  
But a million tears and a million beers have just about washed me up  
And the only thing that I have left in the whole wide world is you  
  
I gave it all I had every night for all these years pourin out my soul  
Til it was gone  
I spread myself so thin and Im just barely hangin on  
But tonight Im with you and you can carry me through  
Just love me  
Cause the only thing that I have left in the whole wide world is you  
I gave it all I had every night for all these years  
Pourin out my soul til it was gone  
I spread myself so thin and Im just barely hangin on  
But tonight Im with you and you can carry me through just love me  
Cause the only thing that I have left in the whole wide world Is you  
Oh is you
