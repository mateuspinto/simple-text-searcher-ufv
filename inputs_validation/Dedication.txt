This is dedicated to the woman I love  
Wherever she stands  my dedication  
This is dedicated to the millions  
That are starving from hunger  in dedication  
  
Dedication  
Dedication  
I dedicate it dedicate it  
Dedication  
  
This is dedicated to the front lines that are dying  
For dedication  
This is dedicated to child of mine wherever she stands  
I give a dedication
