Small town bright lights saturday night  
Pinballs and pool halls flashing their lights  
Making change behind the counter in a penny arcade  
Sat the fat girl daughter of virginia and ray  
  
spoken  
Lydia  
Lydia hid her thoughts like a cat  
Behind her small eyes sunk deep in her fat  
She read romance magazines up in her room  
And felt just like sunday on saturday afternoon  
  
Chorus  
But dreaming just comes natural  
Like the first breath from a baby  
Like sunshine feeding daisies  
Like the love hidden deep in your heart  
  
Bunk beds shaved heads saturday night  
A warehouse of strangers with sixty watt lights  
Staring through the ceiling just wanting to be  
Lay one of too many a young pfc  
  
spoken  
Donald  
There were spaces between donald and whatever he said  
Strangers had forced him to live in his head  
He envisioned the details of romantic scenes  
After midnight in the stillness of the barracks latrine  
  
Repeat chorus  
Hot love cold love no love at all  
A portrait of guilt is hung on the wall  
Nothing is wrong nothing is right  
Donald and lydia made love that night  
  
spoken  
Love  
The made love in the mountains they made love in the streams  
They made love in the valleys they made love in their dreams  
But when they were finished there was nothing to say  
cause mostly they made love from ten miles away  
  
Repeat chorus
