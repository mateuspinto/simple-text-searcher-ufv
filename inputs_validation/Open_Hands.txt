Nobody wants to be the only one left standing  
Nobody wants to be the only one to understand  
And now Im seeing the way that youre leaving  
Without me  
  
Now go on and drift away  
The tide can hold you out  
Go quiet now  
Go sound go safe  
Open hands are hard to hold onto anyway  
Anyway  
  
Everybody wants the world to make them live forever  
And nobody wants to be the only one to sit and paint  
And now Im seeing the way that youre leaving  
Without me  
  
Now go on and drift away  
The tide can hold you out  
Go quiet now  
Go sound go safe  
Open hands are hard to hold onto anyway  
Anyway  
  
Now go on and drift away  
The tide can hold you out  
Go quiet now  
Go sound go safe  
Open hands are hard to hold on to  
Anyway open hands are hard to hold on to  
Anyway open hands are hard to hold on to  
Anyway anyway anyway
