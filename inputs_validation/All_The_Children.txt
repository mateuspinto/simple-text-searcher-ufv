They tell us lies they try to tell us who we are  
But we have grown  
And we remember in the future not to cry  
You could be an angel  
Look in your ancient eyes  
  
What do you see  
Knowing what the power of your future could be  
To fall and then to rise  
Its knowing how it was  
And how that sets you free  
  
All the children will send out love to everyone  
All the children will dance and sing for you  
Through the rhythm of ages blinded in the sun  
All the children will dance and sing for you  
  
So let them talk  
They wont be hiding any secrets from the eyes of a child  
Things can never be but what they are to you  
You could be an angel  
Make all your dreams come true  
  
All the children will send out love to everyone  
All the children will dance and sing for you  
Through the rhythm of ages blinded in the sun  
All the children will dance and sing for you  
  
Stand up freedom is for everyone to know  
Tell them what your truth is when you play  
Stand up freedom is the message in your song  
In the light of what is swept away  
Theres someone there to catch you when you fall  
  
All the children will send out love to everyone  
All the children will dance and sing for you  
High above  
  
Through the rhythm of ages  
See how they run  
Blinded in the sun  
Got to be sure  
All the children will dance  
Watch how they shine  
And sing for you  
This is love  
  
All the children will send out  
Just like before  
Love to everyone  
This is the place  
All the children will dance  
This is the time  
And sing for you  
High above  
  
Through the rhythm of ages  
See how they run  
Blinded in the sun  
Got to be sure  
All the children will dance  
Watch how they shine  
And sing for you  
This is love  
  
All the children will send out  
Just like before  
Love to everyone  
This is the place  
All the children will dance  
This is the time  
And sing for you  
High above  
  
Through the rhythm of ages  
See how they run  
Blinded in the sun  
Got to be sure  
All the children will dance  
Watch how they shine  
And sing for you  
  
High above high above this is love  
High above this is love high above this is love
