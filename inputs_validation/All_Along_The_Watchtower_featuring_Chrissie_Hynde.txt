There must be some kind of way out of here  
Said a joker to the thief  
There is too much confusion I cant get no relief  
Businessmen they drink my wine ploughmen dig my earth  
None of them along the line nobody up it is worth  
  
No reason to get excited  
The thief he kindly spoke  
There are many here among us  
Who feel that life is but a joke  
But you and I have been through that and it is not our fate  
So let us not talk falsely now the hours getting late  
  
All along the watchtower princess kept the view  
While all the women came and went barefoot servants too  
Outside in the cold distance a wildcat did growl  
Two riders were approaching and the wind began to howl
