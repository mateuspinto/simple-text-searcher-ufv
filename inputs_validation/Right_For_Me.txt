I got plans tonight  
And you you know what I like  
And youre approaching me right  
But I gotta make sure its right for me  
  
I got plans tonight  
And you you know what I like  
And youre approaching me right  
But you gotta work that thing right for me  
  
Little baby with the sun dress on  
Looking so damn right youre wrong  
Make me want to write my own little song for you  
The way the thing just wiggle in the air  
Turn around and then you flip your hair  
I could think of a couple positions for you  
  
Your wasting no time talking to me  
Must be something you want me to see  
Well baby girl dont mind me if I do  
So take the stage just show me what you got  
Feeling lucky let me touch your spot  
Might be leaving with me before the night is through  
  
I got plans tonight  
And you you know what I like  
And youre approaching me right  
But I gotta make sure its right for me  
  
I got plans tonight  
And you you know what I like  
And youre approaching me right  
But you gotta work that thing right for me  
  
Your bodys saying things I aint never heard  
You did the shakeshake and I kinda went berserk  
Gotta give it to you girl youre one of a kind  
When you took my hand up so calm  
Touched it to your cherry lip balm  
A million nasty things went through my mind  
  
So baby tell me what youre doing later on  
Cause Im thinking me and you could get along  
Baby girl dont mind me if I do  
So take the stage just show me what you got  
Feeling lucky let me touch your spot  
Might be leaving with me before the night is through  
  
I got plans tonight  
And you you know what I like  
And youre approaching me right  
But I gotta make sure its right for me  
You might be right for me  
  
I got plans tonight  
And you you know what I like  
And youre approaching me right  
But you gotta work that thing right for me
