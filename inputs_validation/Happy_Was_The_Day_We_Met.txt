It hurts inside to know of all the times  
Weve ever had a cry  
To keep away the reasoning of why we lie  
It only leads me down a lonely road  
And strange of fates as a world to  
A new and different time or place  
To live away the time of day so we can race  
Exactly what we choose just not to believe  
And ooh  
Happy was the day we met  
Never could I ever forget you  
I knew too well not to stay  
We paid our price turn our heads  
Close our eyes and sacrifice  
Excuses of love  
That once was warm has turned to ice  
But only leave me cold and so alone  
Now memories of years and fun  
Can only turn my eyes to see  
All the good thats been undone  
But I believe were lucky just to learn  
From what we were  
And ooh  
Happy was the day we met  
Never could I ever forget you  
I knew too well not to stay  
What about oooh yeah  
Oh oh oh yeah  
Oh if you go away  
Oh you so happy baby  
Now memories of years and fun  
Can only turn my eyes to see  
All the good thats been undone  
But I believe were lucky just to learn  
From what we were  
And ooh  
Happy was the day we met  
Never will I ever forget you  
I knew too well not to stay  
Happy was the day we met  
Never could I ever forget you  
Happy was the day we met  
Never could I ever forget you  
Happy was the day we met  
Never could I ever forget you
