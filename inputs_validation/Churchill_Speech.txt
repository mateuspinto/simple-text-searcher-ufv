We shall go on to the end  
We shall fight in France  
We shall fight over the seas and oceans  
We shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air  
We shall defend our island whatever the cost may be  
We shall fight on beaches we shall fight on the landing grounds  
We shall fight in the fields and in the streets  
We shall fight on the hills  
We shall never surrender
