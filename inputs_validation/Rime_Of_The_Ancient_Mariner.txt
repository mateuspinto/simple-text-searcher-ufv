Hear the rime of the ancient mariner  
See his eye as he stops one of three  
Mesmerizes one of the wedding guests  
Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea  
  
And the music plays on as the bride passes by  
Caught by his spell and the mariner tells his tale  
  
Driven south to the land of the snow and ice  
To a place where nobodys been  
Through the snow fog flies on the albatross  
Hailed in Gods name hoping good luck it brings  
  
And the ship sails on back to the North  
Through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on  
  
The mariner kills the bird of good omen  
His shipmates cry against what hes done  
But when the fog clears they justify him  
And make themselves a part of the crime  
  
Sailing on and on and north across the sea  
Sailing on and on and north til all is calm  
  
The albatross begins with its vengeance  
A terrible curse a thirst has begun  
His shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner  
About his neck the dead bird is hung  
  
And the curse goes on and on at sea  
And the curse goes on and on for them and me  
  
Day after day day after day  
We stuck nor breath nor motion  
As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean  
Water water everywhere and  
All the boards did shrink  
Water water everywhere nor any drop to drink  
  
There calls the mariner  
There comes a ship over the line  
But how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide  
  
She onward she comes  
Onward she nears out of the sun  
See she has no crew  
She has no life wait but heres two  
  
Death and she life in death  
They throw their dice for the crew  
She wins the mariner and he belongs to her now  
Then crew one by one  
They drop down dead two hundred men  
She she Life in Death  
She lets him live her chosen one  
  
One after one by the star dogged moon  
Too quick for groan or sigh  
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang  
And cursed me with his eye  
Four times fifty living men  
And I heard nor sigh nor groan  
With heavy thump a lifeless lump  
They dropped down one by one  
  
The curse it lives on in their eyes  
The mariner he wished hed die  
Along with the sea creatures  
But they lived on so did he  
  
And by the light of the moon  
He prays for their beauty not doom  
With heart he blesses them  
Gods creatures all of them too  
  
Then the spell starts to break  
The albatross falls from his neck  
Sinks down like lead into the sea  
Then down in falls comes the rain  
  
Hear the groans of the long dead seamen  
See them stir and they start to rise  
Bodies lifted by good spirits  
None of them speak and theyre lifeless in their eyes  
  
And revenge is still sought penance starts again  
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on  
  
Now the curse is finally lifted  
And the mariner sights his home  
Spirits go from the long dead bodies  
Form their own light and the mariners left alone  
  
And then a boat came sailing towards him  
It was a joy he could not believe  
The pilots boat his son and the hermit  
Penance of life will fall onto him  
  
And the ship it sinks like lead into the sea  
And the hermit shrives the mariner of his sins  
  
The mariners bound to tell of his story  
To tell this tale wherever he goes  
To teach Gods word by his own example  
That we must love all things that God made  
  
And the wedding guests a sad and wiser man  
And the tale goes on and on and on
