When will I see you again  
When will we share precious moments  
  
Will I have to wait forever  
Will I have to suffer and cry the whole night through  
  
When will I see you again  
When will our hearts beat together  
  
Are we in love or just friends  
Is this my beginning or is this the end  
  
When will I see you again  
When will I see you again  
When will I see you again  
  
Are we in love or just friends  
Is this my beginning or is this the end  
  
When will I see you again  
When will I see you again  
When will I see you again  
When will I see you again  
When will I see you again  
When will I see you again  
When will I see you again
