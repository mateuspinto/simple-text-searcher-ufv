Oh theres no place like home for the holidays  
Cause no matter how far away you roam  
When you pine for the sunshine of a friendly gaze  
For the holidays you cant beat home sweet home  
  
I met a man who lives in Tennessee  
He was headin for  
Pennsylvania and some home made pumpkin pie  
From Pennsylvania folks are travelin  
Down to Dixies sunny shore  
From Atlantic to Pacific  
Gee the traffic is terrific  
  
Oh theres no place like home for the holidays  
Cause no matter how far away you roam  
If you want to be happy in a million ways  
For the holidays  
You cant beat home sweet home  
  
Take a bus take a train  
Go and hop an aeroplane  
Put the wife and kiddies in the family car  
For the pleasure that you bring  
When you make that doorbell ring  
No trip could be too far

You cant beat home sweet home
