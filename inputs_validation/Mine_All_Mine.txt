Forgive me father  
For I have sinned  
Ive been through hell and back again  
Shook hands with the devil  
Looked him in the eye  
Looked like a long lost friend  
Anything you want  
Any dirty deeds  
Hes got everything  
Except what I really need  
Keepin me temporarily satisfied  
But not one thing I tried  
Filled me up inside  
Or felt like mine  
Mine all mine  
Yeah the search goes on  
The more I look  
My world keeps getting smaller  
Staring at the sun  
Searchin for the light  
Almost ended up blinded  
Some only see  
What they want to see  
Claiming victory  
Oh but thats not me  
Give me truth  
Give me something real  
I just want to feel  
Like its  
Mine all mine  
Oh really mine all mine  
Come on give me something  
Something thats mine all mine all mine  
Mine all mine  
All the words on the wall  
Look the same in the mirror  
Every riddle  
Every clue  
You got Allah in the east  
You got Jesus in the west  
Christ whats a man to do  
Theyll find a cure for anything  
Just kill the pain  
Numb my brain  
We see a man  
Speaking the word of God  
Provin to be a fraud  
His own church applauds  
Stop lookin out  
Start lookin in  
Be your own best friend  
Stand up and say  
Hey This is mine  
All mine all mine all mine  
Baby you got something  
And I got something  
And its mine all mine all mine  
Mine all mine  
Mine all mine  
Yes Im searching  
Mine all mine  
Got to have it  
Mine all mine  
Mine all mine
