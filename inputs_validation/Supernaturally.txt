Through the windswept coastal trees  
Where the dead come rising from the sea  
With a teddybear clamped between her knees  
She says where can my loverman be  
Well Im down here babe with the Eskimos With the polar bears and the
Arctic snow  
With a party of penguins who do not know flow  
How I can get back to thee  
Well Im gonna ask you babe  
Hey Ho  
Oh baby dont you go  
Hey Ho  
Oh no no no  
Hey Ho  
Oh baby dont you go  
All supernatural on me  
Supernaturally  
  
Once I was your hearts desire  
Now I am the ape hunkered by the fire  
With my knuckles dragging through the mire  
You float by so majestically  
Youre my north my south my east my west  
You are the girl that I love best  
With an army of tanks bursting from your chest  
I wave my little white flag at thee  
Can you see it babe  
Hey Ho  
Oh baby dont you go  
Hey Ho  
Oh no no no  
Hey Ho  
Oh baby dont you go  
All supernatural on me  
Supernaturally  
  
Now Ive turned the mirrors to wall  
Ive emptied out the peopled halls  
Ive nailed shut the windows and locked the doors  
There is no escape you see  
I chase you up and down the stairs  
Under tables and over chairs  
I reach out and I touch your hair  
And it cuts me like a knife  
For there is always something  
Other little thing you gotta do  
Hey Ho  
Oh baby dont you go  
Hey Ho  
Oh baby no no no  
Hey Ho  
Oh dont you go  
All supernatural on me  
Supernaturally
