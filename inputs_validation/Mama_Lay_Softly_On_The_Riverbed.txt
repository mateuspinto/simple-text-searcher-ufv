Mama why did you do it  
Mama who drove you to it  
  
Was it the pigs in grey suits  
Persecuting you  
Uncivil servants  
Unconcerned at how they frightened you  
Life is nothing much to lose  
Its just so lonely here without you  
  
Mama why did you do it  
Mama who drove you to it  
  
Spare priggish money men  
Who scared the life out of you  
Bailiffs with bad breath  
I will slit their throats for you  
Life is nothing much to lose  
Its just so lonely here without you mama  
  
Life is nothing much to lose  
Its just so lonely here without you  
  
So were gonna run to you  
Were gonna come to you  
Were gonna lie down beside you mama  
  
Were gonna be with you  
Were gonna join you  
Were gonna lie down beside you mama  
  
And we will be safe and sheltered in our graves  
Well come before you  
And we will kiss you  
By way of one final hug mama
