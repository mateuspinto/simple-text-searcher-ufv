I can hear the turning of the key  
Ive been deceived by the clown inside of me  
I thought that he was righteous but hes vain  
Oh somethings atelling me I wear the ball and chain  
  
My patron saint is afighting with a ghost  
Hes always off somewhere when I need him most  
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill  
But my heart is atellin me I love ya still  
  
I come back to the town from the flaming moon  
I see you in the streets I begin to swoon  
I love to see you dress before the mirror  
Wont you let me in your room one time fore I finally disappear  
  
Everybodys wearing a disguise  
To hide what theyve got left behind their eyes  
But me I cant cover what I am  
Wherever the children go Ill follow them  
  
I march in the parade of liberty  
But as long as I love you Im not free  
How long must I suffer such abuse  
Wont you let me see you smile one time before I turn you loose  
  
Ive given up the game Ive got to leave  
The pot of gold is only makebelieve  
The treasure cant be found by men who search  
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church  
  
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed  
I asked ya please to cross me offa your list  
My head tells me its time to make a change  
But my heart is telling me I love ya but youre strange  
  
One more time at midnight near the wall  
Take off your heavy makeup and your shawl  
Wont you descend from the throne from where you sit  
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it
