Said the world to the sun i must turn away  
Cause my face is so ugly I feel so ashamed  
Tell me where does the world go to hide  
  
All the people down here they fight everywhere  
They destroy and they poison  
They dont even care  
So where does the world go to hide  
  
Nobody cares what will happen to me  
And nobody cares if I cry  
There must be a reason to carry on  
But the pain is so bad I could die  
  
Said the sun to the people now who is to blame  
But like scared little children they all ran away  
But where can the world go to hide  
  
Tell me where can the world go to hide
