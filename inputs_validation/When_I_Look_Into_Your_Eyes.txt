When I look into your eyes  
I see the ocean in the shore  
And I know just what Im living for  
When I look into your eyes yeah  
When I look into your eyes  
All the love there is arrives  
And everything around me dies  
When I look into your eyes yeah yeah yeah  
When I look into your eyes  
The sun melts deep into the sky  
And plants a seed inside my soul  
And takes me up into the sky  
When I look into your eyes  
I see the oceans in the shore  
And I know just what Im living for  
When I look into your eyes yeah yeah
