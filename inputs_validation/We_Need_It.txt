We are not  
What youve been waiting for  
We are not  
The things you need  
We are not  
Softly singing love songs  
All we are  
Here for is right  
Room for one more  
Here in this room  
We play games  
Room for one more  
Here in this room  
You can feel it all  
We need it  
To keep the shakes away  
We need it  
To help us breathe  
We need it  
For everything we feel  
We need it  
Like we need you  
repeat chorus  
We break down  
Start up the smile I suppose  
You learn quick  
You learn nothing  
One more girl  
Just leaves us wanting more  
This young love  
Just leaves us cold  
repeat chorus
