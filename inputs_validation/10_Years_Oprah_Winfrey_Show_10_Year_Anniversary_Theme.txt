10 Years Oprah Winfrey show 10 year anniversary theme  
  
  
You are moving on a crowded street  
Through various shades of people  
In the summers harshest heat  
A story in your eye  
Well speak until your minds at ease  
  
Ten years come and gone so fast  
I might as well be dreaming  
Sunny days have burned a path  
Across another season  
A fortune rises to the sky  
Ten years come and gone so fast  
  
You are driving down an empty road  
Beside a shady river  
When the sky turns dark as stone  
The trees begin to shiver  
The grace of God is nigh  
  
Ten years come and gone  
And that flash has never been forgotten  
Sunny days have burned a path  
Across another season  
How do the powerless survive  
Ten years come and gone so fast  
  
And if you look into your future life  
Ten years from this question  
Do you imagine a familiar light  
Burning in the distance  
The love that never died  
  
Ten years come and gone so fast  
I might as well be dreaming  
Sunny days have burned a path  
Across another season  
  
Ten years come and gone so fast  
Sunny days have burned a path
