Disco dancing with the lights down low  
Beats are pumping on the stereo  
Neighbours banging on the bathroom wall  
Your sayin crank the bass  
I gotta get some more  
  
Waters runnin in the wrong direction  
Got a feelin its a mixed up sign  
I can see it in my own reflection  
Something funnies goin on inside my mind  
Dont know what its pushin me higher  
Its the static from the floor below  
Then its drops and catches like a fire  
Its a sound I Its a sound I know  
  
Its the sound of the underground  
The beat of the drum goes round and around  
In to the overflow  
Where the girls get down to the sound of the radio  
Out to the electric night  
Where the bass line jumps in the backstreet lights  
The beat goes around and round  
Its the sound of the under  
Sound of the underground  
  
Chain reaction running through my veins  
Pumps the bass line up into my brains  
Screws my mind until I lose control  
And when the building rocks I know Its got my soul  
  
Waters runnin in the wrong direction  
Got a feelin its a mixed up sign  
I can see it in my own reflection  
Something funnies goin on inside my mind  
Dont know what its pushin me higher  
Its the static from the floor below  
Then its drops and catches like a fire  
Its a sound I Its a sound I know  
  
Its the sound of the underground  
The beat of the drum goes round and around  
In to the overflow  
Where the girls get down to the sound of the radio  
Out to the electric night  
Where the bass line jumps in the backstreet lights  
The beat goes around and round  
Its the sound of the under  
Sound of the underground  
  
I dont know what its pushin me higher  
Its the static from the floor below  
And then it drops and catches like fire  
Its a sound I Its a sound I  
Its a sound I Its a sound I Know  
  
Its the sound of the underground  
The beat of the drum goes round and around  
In to the overflow  
Where the girls get down to the sound of the radio  
Out to the electric night  
Where the bass line jumps in the backstreet lights  
The beat goes around and round  
Its the sound of the under  
Sound of the underground  
  
The bass line jumps in the backstreet light  
Its the sound of the under  
Sound of the underground  
The bass line jumps in the backstreet light  
Its the sound of the under  
Sound of the underground
