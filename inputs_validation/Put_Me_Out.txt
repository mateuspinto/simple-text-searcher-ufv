You bought your smile on a corner  
You paint a pretty painting you did  
You paint yourself in a picture  
As you deny the kind of person youve been  
  
You get what you feel what you wish to be  
You cant live sarcastic sincenerity  
You shop in your guilt like a guillotine  
You get what you feel you get what you feel  
  
I gave you everything you threw it away  
Put me out like a cigarette out like a cigarette  
Love like a cancer still you beg me to stay  
Put me out like a cigarette out like a cigarette  
  
Come on  
  
You pop right in to the moment  
You paint a pretty painting you did  
You never noticed how broken  
As you deny the kind of person youve been  
  
You get what you feel what you wish to be  
You cant live sarcastic sincenerity  
You shop in your guilt like a guillotine  
You get what you feel you get what you feel  
  
I gave you everything you threw it away  
Put me out like a cigarette out like a cigarette  
Love like a cancer still you beg me to stay  
Put me out like a cigarette out like a cigarette  
  
You kneel to pray  
Live life on your knees embrace the disease  
Start to pull in as you start to choke your life begins  
  
You put me out Like a cigarette  
  
I gave you everything you threw it away  
Put me out like a cigarette out like a cigarette  
Love like a cancer still you beg me to stay  
Put me out like a cigarette out like a cigarette
