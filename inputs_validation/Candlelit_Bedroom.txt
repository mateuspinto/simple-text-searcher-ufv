The sound of one heart breaking the sound of someone waking  
To the cold hard truth before the sun goes down  
If I could ever catch you a little bit of that  
Id wrap it up and bury it in the deep dark ground  
  
On the ledge with one last chance to beg  
To the deepest root of the oldest tree  
If we could only bottle a little bit of rain  
Wrung out from the history in its ancient leaves  
  
Chorus  
All we need is a candlelit bedroom  
All you ever wanted was a state of grace  
Every waking moment you believe that  
Love will always lead you to a better place  
  
The never ending stories of the victor and the spoils  
The treasure and the lesson to be learned  
If I could ever wrap up a little piece of this  
Id strike a match and watch the contents burn  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Love will always lead to a candlelit bedroom  
Only if you want it bad enough  
Every waking moment you believe that  
You must have a little faith in the light of love  
Every waking moment you believe that  
You must have a little faith in the light of love
