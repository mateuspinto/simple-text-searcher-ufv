Deep in my Heart I love you  
Deep in my heart I care  
You are my life  
My everything my dream my every prayer  
  
Deep in my heart I know  
That deep in your heart you know  
That we were meant for each other  
And we will love each other forever  
  
Deep in my heart I know  
That deep in your heart you know  
That we were meant for each other  
  
And deep within my heart  
And deep in your heart  
Yes we will love each other forever  
Deep in my heart forever
