I had finally beat my nerve  
To watch her on the stage  
Removing all her clothes  
Revealing only age  
Some men stared with a stun  
Some sat in married guilt  
That night I chewed a brick  
For ideals I had built  
And there we were in each others arms  
The very 1st dance that seemed to last  
For ever  
  
Our heads they almost touched  
Our feet beneath us moved  
Professional her dance  
And me the horses hoof  
The lights the beat the vision  
Id conjured in my head  
Had magically appeared  
And disappeared again  
  
The music stopped we parted  
But only for a bar  
Off to the Bahamas  
Back into her arms  
The excitement of a kiss  
Quenched my lovers thirst  
We walked into the cold night  
A night to remember
