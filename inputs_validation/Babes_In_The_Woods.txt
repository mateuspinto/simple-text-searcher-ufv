Oh dont you remember a long time ago  
Those two little babies their names I dont know  
They were stolen away one bright summers day  
And left in a wood so Ive heard folks say  
  
Sweet babes in the wood  
Sweet babes in the wood  
Oh dont you remember  
Those babes in the wood  
  
Now the day being gone and the night coming on  
Those two little babies sat under a stone  
They sobbed and they sighed they bitterly cried  
Those two little babies they laid down and died  
  
Sweet babes in the wood  
Sweet babes in the wood  
Oh dont you remember  
Those babes in the wood  
  
Now the robins so red how swiftly they sped  
They put out their wide wings and over them spread  
And all the day long on the branches among  
They sweetly did whistle and this was their song  
  
Sweet babes in the wood  
Sweet babes in the wood  
Oh dont you remember  
Those babes in the wood
