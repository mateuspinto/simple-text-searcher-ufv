Well well well well  
I looked over yonder and what I see seems like a chariot coming after me  
Swing low sweet chariot coming to carry me home  
  
Why dont you swing down chariot stop and let me ride  
Swing down chariot stop and let me ride  
Rock me Lord rock me Lord calm and easy  
Ive got a home on the other side  
  
Swing swing swing  
Well Ezekiel was out in the middle of the field  
He said he saw an angel with a chariot wheel  
He wasnt too particular about the chariot wheel  
He just wanted to see how a chariot feels

Swing down chariot stop and let me ride  
Rock me Lord rock me Lord calm and easy

Well Ezekiel went down and he got on board  
The chariot went bumping on down the road  
Zeke wasnt particular about the bumpin of the road  
He just wanted to lay down his heavy load  
  
Why dont you swing down chariot stop and let me ride  
Swing down chariot stop and let me ride  
Rock me Lord rock me Lord calm and easy  
Ive got a home on the other side  
  
Well I got a Father in the promised land and I aint stopping till I shake
His hand

Rock me Lord rock me Lord calm and easy
