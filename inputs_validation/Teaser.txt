Getting dressed for the masquerade  
To be the main attraction  
Might become someone someday  
With the right connection  
You might find the night so lonely  
But youre not the only one  
I just want to go with ecstasy  
To the river of love I run  
Teaser you set my heart on fire  
Teaser put out the flames of my desire  
If you let me stay inside  
I give satisfaction  
In the night we might lose our way  
In the tunnel of love I ride  
Teaser you set my heart on fire  
Teaser put out the flames of my desire  
Ohh I guess we all need someone  
Teaser you set my heart on fire  
Teaser put out the flames of my desire
