Lady space you like the way  
I make you feel inside  
Take a rocket ride  
From the start you wanted to fly  
I got the rocket and you want the ride  
Take a rocket ride  
  
Baby wants it fast baby wants a blast  
She wants a rocket ride she wants a rocket ride  
Baby wants it fast baby wants a blast  
She wants a rocket ride she wants a rocket ride  
  
Lady space you better wake up fast  
Countdown is comin on  
Take a rocket ride  
The gravity that used to hold you down  
Just dont exist no more  
Take a rocket ride  
  
Baby wants it fast baby wants a blast  
She wants a rocket ride she wants a rocket ride  
Baby wants it fast baby wants a blast  
She wants a rocket ride she wants a rocket ride  
Come on grab a hold of my rocket  
  
Baby wants it fast baby wants a blast  
She wants a rocket ride she wants a rocket ride  
Baby wants it fast baby wants a blast  
She wants a rocket ride she wants a rocket ride  
Babys on her knees baby wants to please  
She wants a rocket ride she wants a rocket ride  
Babys on her knees baby wants to please  
She wants a rocket ride she wants a rocket ride
