Well they closed down the auto plant in Mahwah late that month  
Ralph went out lookin for a job but he couldnt find none  
He came home too drunk from mixin Tanqueray and wine  
He got a gun shot a night clerk now they callm Johnny 99  
  
Down in the part of town where when you hit a red light you dont stop  
Johnnys wavin his gun around and threatenin to blow his top  
When an offduty cop snuck up on him from behind  
Out in front of the Club Tip Top they slapped the cuffs on Johnny 99  
  
Well the city supplied a public defender but the judge was Mean John Brown  
He came into the courtroom and stared young Johnny down  
Well the evidence is clear gonna let the sentence son fit the crime  
Prison for ninety eight and a year and well call it even Johnny 99  
A fist fight broke out in the courtroom they had to drag Johnnys girl away  
His mama stood up and shouted Judge dont take my boy this way  
Well son you got a statement youd like to make  
Before the bailiff comes to forever take you away  
  
Now judge I had debts no honest man could pay  
The bank was holdin my mortgage and they were gonna take my house away  
Now I aint sayin that makes me an innocent man  
But it was more n all this that put that gun in my hand  
  
Well your honor I do believe Id be better off dead  
So if you can take a mans life for the thoughts thats in his head  
Then sit back in that chair and think it over judge one more time  
And let em shave off my hair and put me on that killin line
