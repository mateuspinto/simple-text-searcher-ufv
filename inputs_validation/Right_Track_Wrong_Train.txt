The train was leaving at 10 after 10  
I got to the station just in time to check in  
Ive been luggin my bags all around  
Im trying hard to never knock people down  
But I see I left a few on the ground  
And as the train pulls away I can hear the conductor say  
Right track wrong train echoes  
Right track wrong train echoes  
Im not to blame echo  
Right track wrong train Train  
I read my schedule but my train wasnt there  
They read my ticket it said going nowhere  
Everybody had the same tatooed face  
All the women and men just dressed in lace  
Oh I gotta get out of this place  
Should got off before the engineer locked the door  
Right track wrong train echoes  
Right track wrong train echoes  
Im not to blame echo  
Right track wrong train train train train hey  
Hey thats a neat tatoo youre wearing By the way whered you get it  
Uh huh Say is this an express train Uh huh  
Snack bar Uh huh Uh huh   
Something is happening so familiar to me  
Is this the outer limits like on tv  
Another empty town fading to gray  
Another open home sign on the way  
Have a cup of coffee have a nice day  
And as the train pushes off  
Were headed for Babylon  
Oh no  
Right track wrong train echoes  
Right track wrong train echoes  
Right track wrong train  
On the wrong train on the right track  
We dont know if shell ever come back  
Talking What train is this  
Something is happening so familiar to me  
Is this the outer limits like on tv  
Have a cup of coffe have a nice day talking  
Yeah yeah Ill be right there yeah Im gonna get the next train
