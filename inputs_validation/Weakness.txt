Found you there in the blink of an eye  
I miss you  
Turned away into a thousand dreams  
Found out what they mean  
  
Lost you there in a moment of truth  
I trust you  
Gave away the one and only heart  
A gift to tear apart  
  
Stain me save me  
Take me to my home  
Hold me show me  
Take me to my home  
  
Weaker now drawing fluid from me  
You kill me  
Im not afraid of what you have just done  
But of what youve just become
