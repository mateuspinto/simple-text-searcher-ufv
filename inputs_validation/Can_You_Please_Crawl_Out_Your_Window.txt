Bob Dylan  
He sits in your room his tomb with a fist full of tacks  
Preoccupied with his vengeance  
Cursing the dead that cant answer him back  
Im sure that he has no intentions  
Of looking your way unless its to say  
That he needs you to test his inventions  
Can you please crawl out your window  
Use your arms and legs it wont ruin you  
How can you say he will haunt you  
You can go back to him any time you want to  
He looks so truthful is this how he feels  
Trying to peel the moon and expose it  
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel  
If he needs a third eye he just grows it  
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk  
Or pick it up after he throws it  
Can you please crawl out your window  
Use your arms and legs it wont ruin you  
How can you say he will haunt you  
You can go back to him any time you want to  
Why does he look so righteous while your face is so changed  
Are you frightened of the box you keep him in  
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange  
Their religion of the little ten women  
That backs up their views but your face is so bruised  
Come on out the dark is beginning  
Can you please crawl out your window  
Use your arms and legs it wont ruin you  
How can you say he will haunt you  
You can go back to him any time you want to
