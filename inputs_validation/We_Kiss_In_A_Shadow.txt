We kiss in a shadow we hide from the moon  
Our meetings are few and over too soon  
We speak in a whisper afraid to be heard  
When people are near we speak not a word  
  
Alone in our secret together we sigh  
For one smiling day to be free  
  
To kiss in the sunlight and say to the sky  
Behold and believe what you see  
Behold how my lover loves me  
  
Alone in our secret together we sigh  
For one smiling day to be free  
  
To kiss in the sunlight and say to the sky  
Behold and believe what you see  
Behold how my lover loves me
