In 1935 I was living in paradise I had a friend up in Cicero  
We used to go out to the track wed knock a few whiskeys back  
Id lose my shirt and then I would lose my way home  
I was driving my Stutz Black Hawk through Justice in the dark  
When suddenly the blood froze in my veins  
She was standing by the road in an incandescent glow  
My heart stood still my foot slammed on the brakes  
She said Please please would you dignify my wish  
Im trying to get to Heaven could you tell me where that is  
On a wild Chicago night with a wind howling white  
I caught my first sign of Resurrection Mary  
I was trembling like a leaf I was scared beyond belief  
After all my conscience aint that clear  
I used to work for Mickey Finn I did the numbers for Big Jim  
Perhaps my day of reckoning lies here  
I said Please please I would dignify your wish  
But when it comes to Heaven Im just a little bit amateurish  
On a wild Chicago night with a wind howling white  
I cheated time with Resurrection Mary  
And I felt tears form in my eyes for the first time I felt something  
Deep inside and the first time I saw angels high in the air  
For the first time in my life and I said Mary go to the light  
Its gonna be alright  
I got down on my knees I said Sweet Mary please dignify  
These wishes before you run will you tell him Ive reformed  
Will you tell him Im reborn She closed her eyes  
And then she spoke in tongues  
I said Please please tell me what he said she said  
You must die the day before the devil knows youre dead  
On a wild Chicago night with a wind howling white  
I waved goodbye on a wild Chicago night
