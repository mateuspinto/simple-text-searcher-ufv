Grandpa Ive been thinking about you lately  
Wondering if youd found your peace of mind  
I guess youd be proud to know your grandsons  
Never crossed that Mason Dixon line  
And I still sing the old songs that you taught me  
And I still pray to Jesus now and then  
And just like you I wish that he would save me  
To see the day the south will rise again  
  
Daddy wore his Purple Heart so proudly  
Long before I turned into a man  
Buried with our flag across his casket  
I was still too young to understand  
And I still sing the old songs that you taught me  
And I still pray to Jesus now and then  
And just like you I wish that he would save me  
To see the day the south will rise again  
  
Mama spent her last years in the garden  
While I took my turn behind a gun  
Lord Id give my life to find the freedom lost within the old songs that you
sung  
And I still sing the old songs that you taught me  
And I still pray to Jesus now and then  
And just like you I wish that he would save me  
To see the day the south will rise again
