Your innocence all but fades  
When we peel the veneer away  
Its all an act which you stage  
With your twofaced barricades  
  
Rage consumes  
You every night  
Caged inside you  
Trying to get out  
  
Schizophrenic basic needs  
Fools me into complacency  
But now I see through your facade  
Behind the mask a monster snarls  
  
Hatred burning  
In your chest  
Dazed but learning  
In your quest  
  
Oh its killing me your unpredictability  
Oh all the time  
You hide behind  
Your Jekyll and Hyde  
  
Now I realize  
Theres a dark side  
Disguised  
  
Always changing  
Then love hating  
Baiting me  
  
Your innocence all but fades  
When we peel the veneer away  
Its all an act which you stage  
With your twofaced barricades  
  
Rage consumes you every night  
Caged inside you trying to get out  
  
Oh its killing me your unpredictability  
Oh all the time  
You hide behind  
Your Jekyll and Hyde
