When will the blind see when will the deaf hear  
Why should the babe shed so many tear drops  
And the wicked man not even a sigh  
And those wicked men not even a sigh  
  
Cause we are living in a world so corrupt  
We are living in a world so corrupt  
We are living in a world so corrupt  
We are living in a world so corrupt  
Lies they sell cheaper than bread  
What they do starve the people of truth  
Secretly the system program me the pain  
  
In disguise of every day life problems  
In disguise of every day life problems  
We are living in a world so corrupt  
We are living in a world so corrupt  
Yeah I am living in this world so corrupt  
You are living in a world so corrupt  
  
There is a way which seems so right to men  
But it end leadeth to destruction  
Even in gladness the heart weeps  
And the end of joy is grief  
Oh the end of joy is grief  
Dont lose your way find it today  
And dont drop the speed people in need  
Dont lose your way find it today  
I dont drop my speed the people in need  
  
We are living in a world living in a world living in a world  
Mama I have got to change it  
We are living in a world living in a world living in a world  
On daddy Oh daddy I remember you told me  
Living in a world living in a world living in a world  
Thats so corrupt now thats so corrupt now  
Living in a world so corrupt got to be tough  
Got to be rough got to be tough got to be rough now
