Laid back in an old saloon with a peso in my hand  
Watchin flies and children on the street  
And I catch a glimpse of blackeyed girls who giggle when I smile  
Theres a little boy who wants to shine my feet  
  
And its three days ride from Bakersfield and I dont know why I came  
I guess I came to keep from payin dues  
So instead Ive got a bottle and a girl whos just fourteen  
And a damn good case of the Mexicali Blues Yeh  
  
Is there anything a man dont stand to lose  
When the devil wants to take it all away  
Cherish well your thoughts and keep a tight grip on your booze  
Cause thinkin and drinkin are all I have today  
  
She said her name was Billy Jean and she was fresh in town  
I didnt know a stage line ran from Hell  
She had raven hair a ruffled dress a necklace made of gold  
All the french perfume youd care to smell  
  
She took me up into her room and whispered in my ear  
Go on my friend do anything you choose  
Now Im payin for those happy hours I spent there in her arms  
With a lifetimes worth of the Mexicali Blues  
  
Is there anything a man dont stand to lose  
When the devil wants to take it all away  
Cherish well your thoughts and keep a tight grip on your booze  
Cause thinkin and drinkin are all I have today  
  
And then a man rode into town some thought he was the law  
Billy Jean was waitin when he came  
She told me he would take her if I didnt use my gun  
Id have no one but myself to blame  
  
I went down to those dusty streets blood was on my mind  
I guess that stranger hadnt heard the news  
Cause I shot first and killed him Lord he didnt even draw  
And he made me trade the gallows for the Mexicali Blues  
  
Is there anything a man dont stand to lose  
When he lets a woman hold him in her hands  
He just might find himself out there on horseback in the dark  
Just ridin and runnin across those desert sands
