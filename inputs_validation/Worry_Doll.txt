Lists  
I make lists  
Of all the things that I need to fix  
Of all the things that Im not prepared for  
Of all the many things that I dread  
  
Lists  
I make lists  
Of all the things I tried for but missed  
Of all the things I gave up but cared for  
Of all the words of love left unsaid  
  
Dream without fear  
Your indian worry dolls here  
Under gods pillow so small  
So that way you wont worry at all  
  
Dream without fear  
Your indian worry dolls here  
Under gods pillow so small  
So that way you wont have to worry at all  
  
Lists  
Very long  
Of all the things that Im doing wrong  
Of all of the hysteria pending  
Of all the things Id love to forget  
  
Lists  
Very deep  
Of all the time I cant seem to keep  
Of all the songs that still have no ending  
Of all the ways to do better yet  
  
Dream without fear  
Your indian worry dolls here  
Under gods pillow so small  
So that way you wont worry at all  
  
Dream without fear  
Your indian worry dolls here  
Under gods pillow so small  
So that way you wont have to worry at all
