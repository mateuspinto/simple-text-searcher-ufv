Lord Almighty  
I feel my temperature rising  
Higher higher  
Its burning through to my soul  
  
Girl girl girl girl  
You gonna set me on fire  
My brain is flaming  
I dont know which way to go  
  
Your kisses lift me higher  
Like the sweet song of a choir  
You light my morning sky  
With burning love  
  
Ooh ooh ooh  
I feel my temperature rising  
Help me Im flaming  
I must be a hundred and nine  
Burning burning burning  
And nothing can cool me  
I just might turn into smoke  
But I feel fine  
  
Cause your kisses lift me higher  
Like a sweet song of a choir  
And you light my morning sky  
With burning love  
  
Its coming closer  
The flames are reaching my body  
Wont you help me  
I feel like Im slipping away  
Its hard to breath  
And my chest is aheaving  
  
Lord have mercy  
Im burning a hole where I lay  
Cause your kisses lift me higher  
Like the sweet song of a choir  
You light my morning sky  
With burning love  
With burning love  
Ah ah burning love  
Im just a hunk a hunk of burning love  
Just a hunk a hunk of burning love  
Just a hunk a hunk of burning love  
Just a hunk a hunk of burning love  
Just a hunk a hunk of burning love  
Just a hunk a hunk of burning love
