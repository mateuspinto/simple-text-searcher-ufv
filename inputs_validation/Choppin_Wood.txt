You wired the trains and went back home to St Claires shores  
Before you became a spark down at the yard  
You were passing through those hungry years alone  
You were just trying to make a living out in Detroit  
  
When you came back off the boats you didnt want to go anywhere  
You sit down to TV in your favorite chair  
You watch the big picture fade away down at Harland and Wolff  
But you still kept on choppin wood  
  
And you came back home to Belfast  
So you could be with us like  
You lived your life of quiet desperation on the side  
Going to the shipyard in the morning on your bike  
  
Well the spark was gone but you carried on  
You always did the best you could  
You sent for us once but everything fell through  
But you still kept on choppin wood choppin wood  
  
Well you came back home to Belfast  
So you could be with us like  
And you lived a life of quiet desperation on the side  
Going to the shipyard in the morning on your bike  
  
Well the spark was gone but you carried on  
Well you did just the best that you could  
You sent for us one time but everything fell through  
But you still kept on choppin wood  
  
Kept on choppinwood  
Kept on choppin wood  
Local man chops wood  
You know you did the best you could  
  
Well everything just fell through  
Kept on choppin wood  
Chop chop chop chop chop  
Chop chop chop chop chop  
Chop chop chop keep on choppin  
Chop chop chop choppin wood
