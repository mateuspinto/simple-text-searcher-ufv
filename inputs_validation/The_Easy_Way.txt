Listen girl  
Just let me talk to you  
I just wanna be with you  
So why should I play it cool  
You and me We got a chemistry  
So I dont need poetry to say what ya mean to me  
  
See Im not into buying your affections  
With a diamond on a necklace  
Theres a realer way to do it girl  
I dont need to throw you all these lines  
Just so you know I know your fine Im gonna come right out and say it girl  
  
Chorus  
I love you I love you  
Whats wrong with saying it the easy way  
I love you I love you  
Whats wrong with saying it the easy way  
  
Pretty girl I dont wanna play no more  
Been there done that before  
Ive never been so sure  
About what I feel  
Lets get it on for real  
Why should I hold it back  
When all I wanna say is that  
  
See Im not into buying your affections  
With a diamond on a necklace  
Theres a realer way to do it girl  
I spend all the time I have with you  
I never treat you bad  
Aint that enough to show you  
That you are my world  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh I love you I love you the easy way  
I Love you Yeah yeah yeah  
  
See Im not into buying your affections  
With a diamond on a necklace  
Theres a realer way to do it girl  
I spend all the time I have with you  
I never treat you bad  
Aint that enough to show you  
That you are my world  
  
Chorus x2  
  
I love you The easy way
