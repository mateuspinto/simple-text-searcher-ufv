Light my eye with your smile  
Cross my palm with your thought  
For the hand that meets the eye  
Brings you closer to my mind  
Cos in one crowded hour  
You plan to make all the moments  
plan to make all the moments  
Last a lifetime  
  
Chorus  
I can give you everything  
I can give you everything  
I can give you everything  
That I want to give  
  
All alone in the heat of the night  
Say come on lets be strong  
Kindle my soul  
For you are my pride and joy  
  
For it is precious  
Sing rejoice sing rejoice  
For I bring you good tidings  
  
Chorus  
  
All washed up and dirty  
I had no place to go  
I had no place to go  
I can give you everything  
I can give you everything  
I can give you everything  
That I want  
  
Come on with your everything
