Think Ill write a different song  
Got a feeling it might take a long time  
Singin it over again I cant recall just how it used to be  
Voices across the sea  
Mm mm mm  
  
Will she come to me to keep me company  
Wont know till the sun comes up again  
  
Gotta take the good with the bad  
Sometimes I wish I never had my say  
Always goes that way or is it just the way I feel today  
Voices across the way  
Mm mm mm  
  
Will she come to me to keep me company  
Wont know till the sun comes up again  
Wont know till the sun comes up again  
Wont know till the sun comes up again  
Wont know till the sun comes up again  
Wont know till the sun comes up again  
Wont know till the sun comes up again
