Albuquerque will be there in the morning  
Purple mountains will rise up from the floor  
After that you can just lift up the curtain  
And the whole world will be there at your door  
Down the road you see the heat waves a waving  
All the signs are telling you where to go  
And for you this is a bold invitation  
Its all you need you dont need any more  
Those wheels are turning once again  
Now the sun is rising out of the ocean  
Diesel trucks are flying by on the shore  
Yes thats your spirit inside you just waiting  
Its time to move now that much you must know  
Step outside and take a breath of the morning step outside the door  
And the wind will tell you which way to go  
You are the needle on the compass for certain  
The missing map has come back to your door  
Those wheels are turning once again  
Thunder in the canyon waking up the night waking up the night  
Black crow with an indigo glow on the highway  
Albuquerque will be there in the morning  
Purple mountains will rise up from the floor  
After that you can just lift up that curtain  
And the whole world will be there at your door  
Those wheels are turning once again  
Thunder in the canyon waking up the night waking up the night  
Black crow with an indigo glow on the highway  
Barking in the canyon waking up the night  
Black crow with an indigo glow on the highway  
Those wheels are turning once again  
Theyve always been your truest friend
