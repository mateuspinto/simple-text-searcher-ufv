For eons they reigned  
with blood with pain  
our souls devoured  
in a temple of power  
stone by stone  
life by life sacrifice  
with the whips and the chains  
they will build  
no matter what  
pay the price  
with our flesh and bone  
soon reaching the sky  
but many must die  
this temple will bring  
eternal life for the king  
stone by stone  
life by life sacrifice  
with the whips and the chains  
they will build  
no matter what  
pay the price  
with our flesh and bone
