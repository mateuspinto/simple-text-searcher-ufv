Hand in glove  
The sun shines out of our behinds  
No its not like any other love  
This one is different  because its us  
  
Hand in glove  
We can go wherever we please  
And everything depends upon  
How near you stand to me  
  
And if the people stare  
Then the people stare  
Oh I really dont know and I really dont care  
  
Kiss my shades  
  
Hand in glove  
The good people laugh  
Yes we may be hidden by rags  
But weve something theyll never have  
  
Hand in glove  
The sun shines out of our behinds  
Yes we may be hidden by rags  
But weve something theyll never have  
  
And if the people stare  
Then the people stare  
Oh I really dont know and I really dont care  
  
Kiss my shadesoh  
  
So hand in glove I stake my claim  
Ill fight to the last breath  
  
If they dare touch a hair on your head  
Ill fight to the last breath  
  
For the good life is out there somewhere  
So stay on my arm you little charmer  
  
But I know my luck too well  
Yes I know my luck too well  
And Ill probably never see you again  
Ill probably never see you again  
Ill probably never see you again  
Oh
