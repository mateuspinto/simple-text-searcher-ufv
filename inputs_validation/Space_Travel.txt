I heard a voice last night  
It said wake up and open your eyes  
Wake up walk out tonight  
Cause she dont care if youre dead or alive  
Dead or alive  
  
She moves like beams of light  
Straight through this universe in my head  
Where I get peace of mind  
Free from the stupid things that I said  
Shes all in my head  
  
Did I get lost while I was gone  
I traveled space for much too long  
But theres a planet I have found  
And you are far away  
  
Somewhere behind her eyes  
Some supernatural energy  
Takes me for quite the ride  
Across time where I defy gravity  
This energy  
  
Did I get lost while I was gone  
I traveled space for much too long  
But theres a planet I have found  
And you are far away for now  
  
Did I get lost while I was gone  
I traveled space for much too  
Did I get lost while I was gone  
I traveled space for much too long  
But theres a planet I have found  
And you are far away  
Far away  
You are far away  
Far away for now
