Common fortune seeks us all  
And slips our binding rings  
Well turn our heads  
And make us reel  
Well bare our arms as wings  
  
Before our feet a feather drifts  
Beyond us it will fall  
Cause time will bid and make us rise  
Make ravens of us all  
  
My love he breathed the air of kings  
Yet fell beneath his luck  
And in his heart a yearning yet  
Before his time time shook  
All the gifts that God had gave  
And those by fate denied  
Gone to where all treasures laid  
And where the raven flies  
  
Oh there are places I agree  
Where I have yet to roam  
The Egyptian field  
The arctic sea where shadows  
Haunt and moan  
But none but sky  
I have to go  
Should I return to thee  
Gone to where the feather flies  
To all eternity  
But for a time I got more time  
Till I a raven be  
  
Cause time will bid and make us rise  
Make ravens of us all  
And time will bid and make us fly  
Make ravens of us all  
And time will bid and make us fly  
Make ravens of us all
