Cool tears flow upon my pillow  
And im freezing blue with misery  
You know that i never meant to hurt you  
But something always gets right in the way  
  
So ill fill this bedrom full of mystery  
Hang our last conclusions on the wall  
And if this empty building starts to get to me  
Please remember that it just might be your fault  
  
Better to have lost in love  
Than never to have loved at all  
  
So the fated lovers turn to enemies   
And all their hidden feelings start to show  
And i never though that boy  
Could mean so much to me  
And now it seems ill have to let you go
