A long time ago in a far away land  
Theo was the man who learned  
To understand the riches of the earth  
And all that it was worth  
The first man that ever tried to stand with his own plan  
Now this man was all about the wind rain and trees  
He knew that it would take care  
Of all of his family needs  
OVO  
  
Now Ion was the son who spent his nights and days  
Looking for all kinds of ways to get his fathers praise  
In all daddys ways he just wanted to impress  
Bigger faster stronger is what he tried to stress  
  
Sofia was the girl  
Living in her own world  
She found love and joy with a young sky boy  
Sky boys were seen as less to the rest  
So it would seem  
Sofia went into the woods to daydream  
With love in her eyes  
Her own father would despise  
Her love for the young sky boy he would destroy  
  
Feet in the earth  
Heads in the sky  
We watch the world go by  
Feet in the earth  
Heads in the sky  
We watch as life goes by  
  
When Theo was gone his son Ion took the power  
And in his daddys name built the biggest strongest tower  
The earth people and sky people divided by machines  
And the ones who had nothing  
Were the ones who had the wings  
  
The sky boy just wanted everything to be equal  
From fulltime lover  
To now fighting for his people  
OVO  
  
Now Beth was the mom  
Who really loved to weave  
She couldnt believe her own son would decieve  
The sky people got hungry  
And their welfare was ignored  
She let them in the tower  
And the bloody battle roared  
Down came Ion  
And the tower fell as well  
The dark days were over  
And the sky peoples hell  
  
Feet in the earth  
Heads in the sky  
We watch the world go by  
Feet in the earth  
Heads in the sky  
We watch as life goes by  
  
Sofia and the sky boy had long been kept apart  
Sofia grief was faded  
It was joy that filled her heart  
Wrapped in his loving wings  
Sofia took her man  
So the earth and sky united  
It was all fathers plan  
OVO  
  
Theo kept an acorn  
Sofia had carefully saved  
It was planted in the ground that her brother had once paved  
With a rustling and a creaking  
An unearthly sound  
Something big started growing right out of the fertile ground  
  
It was the biggest tree that any of the people ever seen  
And it covered up the sky with a layer of leafy green  
Then it rained and it rained  
And they watched the waters rise  
Then Sofia led her people  
To the safety of the skies  
  
Feet in the earth  
Heads in the sky  
We watch the world go by  
Feet in the earth  
Heads in the sky  
We watch as life goes by  
  
She climbed and she climbed  
But never giving up  
So pregnant and exhausted  
Finally made it to the top  
She looked into the sky  
And the world began to turn  
And with a single cry a new baby had arrived  
  
With OVO in his nest everyone one had done their best  
To prepare for the world  
And every single test  
Soon he was blessed  
And as his mother stood by  
He was soon released  
And sailed off into the sky  
OVO
