As the day gave way  
To Nautical Twilight  
I turned my back on  
The force of which I am made  
I am bound and gagged  
Rupturing a delicate balance  
When I left my world for his  
  
Day after day as my city fades  
And is swallowed by his sea  
She is boundless  
Even breaking on the beach  
  
Every alchemist  
Knows fusion and fission  
Can unify or drive a force to split  
He has been possessed to drink of the spices  
From the east by his liquid mistress  
Which then pushed me into the lair of uranium  
She divides time between greed and his twin tyranny  
  
Day after day cities are betrayed  
As the earthy sons lay their blades  
  
And she is boundless  
But by then she has been frayed  
As the night gives way  
To Nautical dawn I can see I must activate  
The force of which I am made
