Tall and tan and young and lovely  
The girl from Ipanema goes walking  
And when she passes each one she passes goes  ah  
  
When she walks shes like a samba  
That swings so cool and sways so gentle  
That when she passes each one she passes goes  ah  
  
Ooh But he watch her so sadly  
How can he tell her he loves her  
Yes I would give my heart gladly  
But each day that she walks to the sea  
She looks straight ahead not at he  
  
Tall and tan and young and lovely  
The girl from Ipanema goes walking  
And when she passes he smile  but she doesnt see  
Doesnt see  
She just doesnt see she never sees him
