Last night my kisses were banked in black hair  
And in my bed my lover her hair was midnight black  
And all her mystery dwelled within her black hair  
And her black hair framed a happy heartshaped face  
  
And heavyhooded eyes inside her black hair  
Shined at me frome the depths of her hair of deepest black  
While my fingers pushed into her straight black hair  
Pulling her black hair back from her happy heartshaped face  
  
To kiss her milkwhite throat a dark curtain of black hair  
Smothered me my lover with her beautiful black hair  
The smell of it is heavy It is charged with life  
On my fingers the smell of her deep black hair  
  
Full of all my whispered words her black hair  
And wet with tears and goodbyes her hair of deepest black  
All my tears cried against her milkwhite throat  
Hidden behind the curtain of her beautiful black hair  
  
As deep as ink and black black as the deepest sea  
The smell of her black hair upon my pillow  
Where her head and all its black hair did rest  
Today she took a train to the West  
Today she took a train to the West  
Today she took a train to the West
