Gunshots  
  
Four shots to the chest my niggas get at me  
They don fucked around and fucked up my new white tee  
Im just livin my life why they mad at me  
Woke up this morning I aint see this coming  
Should I even bust back you aint see me running  
I hope heaven got a VIP line  
Got some partners in hell thatll sneak me in the back door  
You know I hate waitin in line  
  
Paramedics on the way but they wastin they time  
Everybody standin over a nigga screaminand shit  
Damn yall give a nigga a second to think  
Which one of you niggas shot me it was one of you bastards  
Let my nigga Kink throw a hundred grand in my casket  
  
Chorus x 2  
Pour out a little liquor bury me in some Evisu jeans  
A USDA top and a throwaway glock  
Bury me a G nothin more nothin less  
When I get where Im goin I just gotta be fresh  
  
Expect the worst but hope for the best  
But you know how it is amen god bless  
I cant leave now niggas owe me money  
My nigga on the westside owe me bout a dub  
And my partner with a few shit he owe a nigga too  
  
I shoulda hugged my son shoulda kissed my mother  
Spent some time with her show her I love her  
Every night she was prayin for me I was in the streets  
Active little nigga should I stay in some beef  
Gucci go through some shit and he really need me  
And what about the streets shit they need me too  
Im on some got Def Jam shit they owe a nigga too  
  
Chorus x 2
