Got a nervous kind of feeling  
Got a painful yellow headache  
Every picture in every magazines turned real  
Every face looks out and screams at me too real  
Cold sweat on my collar  
Dripping to my boots  
The waves of nauseous pain  
Sets off the pressure pad alarms  
Gotta get outta here  
Gotta get outta here  
Gotta get outta here  
Gotta get outta here  
Gotta painful swelling brain  
Banging in my head  
Gotta painful swelling brain  
And i called off sick  
Gotta swelling itching pain  
Got me pulling out my hair  
Gotta swelling itching pain  
Clutching at my brain  
Got me laying on the floor  
Think i left my senses  
Seems like endless torture  
Got me pulling out my hair  
Driving me up the wall  
Dripping out my eyes ears nose and mouth  
Imploding my thoughts  
Blasting holes in the front lawn now  
Going outta my skull  
Burning up my thoughts  
Tearing me apart
