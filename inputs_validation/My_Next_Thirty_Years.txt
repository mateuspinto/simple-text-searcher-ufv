I think Ill take a moment celebrate my age  
End of an era and the turning of a page  
Now its time to focus in on where I go from here  
Lord have mercy on my next thirty years  
  
In my next thirty years Im gonna have some fun  
Try to forget about all the crazy things Ive done  
Maybe now Ive conquered all my adolescent fears  
And Ill do it better in my next thirty years  
  
My next thirty years Im gonna settle all the scores  
Cry a little less laugh a little more  
Find a world of happiness without the hate and fear  
Figure out just what Im doin here in my next thirty years  
  
For my next thirty years Im gonna watch my weight  
Eat a few more salads and not stay up so late  
Drink a little lemonade and not so many beers  
Maybe Ill remember my next thirty years  
  
My next thirty years will be the best years of my life  
Raise a little family and hang out with my wife  
Spend precious moments with the ones that I hold dear  
Make up for lost time here in my next thirty years  
In my next thirty years
