Big dick is a thumbsup guy  
He shot a missile in the sky  
It functioned just as advertised  
Until the fire made him cry  
Look into it later  
  
When the dust is clearing off the crater  
Run like a villain let the good times roll  
Run like a villain to the sugar bowl  
Run like a villain cause you cant adjust  
To a saccharine suburb in the mush  
Ive got some loving arms around me  
Darker than the tombs of Egypt  
Dumber than the crudest fiction  
Buried in a melting coffin  
Nights like this appeal to me  
  
Tracy got an afghan pedigreed  
Prescription shades and designer jeans  
A sony walkman on her head  
All she wants is to be fed  
Run run run cause youre soft  
Run run but dont get lost  
The shining moon the dead oak tree  
Nights like this appeal to me  
  
Ive got some loving arms around me  
The shining moon the dead oak tree  
Nights like this appeal to me  
Ive got some loving arms around me  
Trying to steal a moment of pleasantry  
In this zombie birdhouse  
  
Run run run run like a villain  
Let the good times roll  
Run like a villain to save your soul  
It cant be done I already know  
So I run like a villain to the sugar bowl  
Cause who you are nobody knows  
Who you are nobody knows  
Rings on your fingers  
And bells on your toes
