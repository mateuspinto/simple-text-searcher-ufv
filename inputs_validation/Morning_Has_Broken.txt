Oh yes  
Say it now  
  
Morning has broken  
Like the first morning  
Blackbird has spoken  
Like the first bird  
  
Praise for the singing  
Praise for the morning  
Praise for them springing  
Fresh from the world  
  
Sweet the rains new fall  
Sunlit from heaven  
Like the first dewfall  
On the first grass  
Praise for the sweetness  
Of the wet garden  
Sprung in completeness  
Where his feet pass  
  
Mine is the sunlight  
Mine is the morning  
Born of the one light  
Eden saw play  
  
Praise with elation  
Praise every morning  
Gods recreation  
Of the new day
