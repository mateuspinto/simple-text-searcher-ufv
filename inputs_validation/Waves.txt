These gigantic waves just take me  
To an unknown destination  
Under the moonlight  
Feel free to join me on my trip  
The tide will take us far  
Beyond midnight  
Stars will guide us through this  
Exotic white  
Stars wont be able to fool the knowledge  
Of the magic dice  
This sea breeze is refreshing  
While the dolphins sing about  
These psychedelic moods  
These waves keep you going  
Til you finally forget  
Your original roots  
Stars will guide us through this  
Exotic white  
Stars wont be able to fool the knowledge  
Of the magic dice  
Wave after wave
