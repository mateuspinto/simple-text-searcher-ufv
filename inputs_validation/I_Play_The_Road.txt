I play the road  
And the highway is our song  
And every citys like the same three chords  
Been helping us along when the storys told  
And the crowd has come and gone  
Shaking off the miles and trying to make it home  
  
Every exit is a season  
Every signal is a beacon  
And the wind it carries me  
And it eases up my load  
Everyday I drag the turns  
Every candle still burns  
And every lesson I have learned  
Brings us closer to the crowd  
  
I play the road  
And the highway is our song  
And every citys like the same three chords  
Been helping us along when the storys told  
And the crowd is done and gone  
Shaking off the miles and trying to make it home  
  
Well the bus it is our steeple  
It brings us to the people  
And they will be there waiting  
Dancing young and old  
And every one of us gets tired  
But every one remains inspired  
And every one of us require  
To keep picking through our souls  
  
I play the road  
And the highway is our song  
And every citys like the same three chords  
Been helping us along when the storys told  
And the crowd is done and gone  
Shaking off the miles and trying to make it home  
  
She says Daddy where do you go  
When you leave me all these nights  
With a suitcase and guitar in your hand  
Kissing me and mom goodbye with a tear and a smile  
Where do you go  
Daddy where do you go  
  
I play the road  
And this highway is our song  
And every citys like the same three chords  
Been helping us along when the storys told  
And the crowd is done and gone  
Shaking off the miles and trying to make it home  
Shaking off the miles  
Shaking off the miles  
Mile after mile  
Mile after mile  
Baby Im coming home
