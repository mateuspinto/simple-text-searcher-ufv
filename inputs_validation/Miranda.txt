At the end of the day  
The end of the light  
She keeps the remains of all of her foes  
Miranda is dying with all of her might  
She never comes  
She always goes  
  
She sticks the camera right into her arm  
Anything to forget what the troubles about  
It causes her pain  
Thats part of the charm  
Shes down for the count then finally out  
  
Miranda is taking the stars down  
A little something to call her own  
But the lion still rules Miranda  
And Miranda is always alone  
  
She sees her face in another magazine  
And the walls all close in as the fancy takes flight  
Cant stand to be loved  
But she loves to be seen  
She slips down headlong into the night  
  
Miranda is taking the stars down  
A little something to call her own  
But the lion still rules Miranda  
And Miranda is always alone  
  
And then all at once the sun starts to rise  
She sees her father holding her down  
All the daylight is poison to her eyes  
She slips down the shade and lets herself drown  
  
Miranda is taking the stars down  
A little something to call her own  
But the lion still rules Miranda  
And Miranda is always alone  
  
The lights shine down the marina  
All across her safety zone  
But loneliness follows Miranda  
And Miranda is always alone  
Miranda is always alone  
Miranda is always alone  
  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
