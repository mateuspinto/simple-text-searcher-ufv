This blue dot of sickly light  
That is daytime in your embarrassed town  
Burns a hole in the fading yellow ribbon  
On your fading wine colored Cavaliere  
the mine has fallen down on you  
As you dug a well of death  
Milk and sugar water  
In brief sympathy with them  
when we see the hate in your eyes  
It doesnt make us better men  
The mine has crushed your brother  
As he ruined our rotting sky  
A white blast of black hot powder  
As you lapse into a real boy  
the mine has fallen down on you  
As you dug a well of death  
Tears of sugar water flow  
In briefest sympathy with them  
should you be ashamed for more than that  
Than that your daddy raped you silly  
Leaning my head on the refrigerator  
Crying for the stupid world we share  
walla walla walla walla walla walla walla hey
