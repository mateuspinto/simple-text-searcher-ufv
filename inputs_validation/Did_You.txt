You left me standing there  
You didnt even care  
You just walked away  
I felt so scared  
You never even looked back at me  
So unaware of how cruel you could be  
I was always there  
Did you ever care  
  
Did you ever care for me  
Did you ever believe in me  
Did you ever love me  
Did you Did you Did you  
  
You didnt have to fall  
I didnt need your tears  
I didnt want your pity  
Just any feeling at all would have been sufficient  
I never felt so small so insignificant  
You left me naked with nothing at all  
How could I be so blind  
  
Did you ever care for me  
Did you ever believe in me  
Did you ever love me  
Did you Did you Did you  
  
Falling down  
Darkness surrounds me  
I open my eyes  
I bow my head and cry  
  
Did you ever believe in me  
Did you ever even love me  
  
Did you ever care for me  
Did you ever believe in me  
Did you ever love me  
Did you Did you Did you  
  
Did you ever care for me  
Did you ever love me
