Someone spilled blood many years ago  
Someone spilled blood but do you know  
That from the backwoods  
Where the Chuck Berrys grow  
Come your long tall  
Daddies of a rock and roll  
  
Take me to your backwoods now  
Take me to your backwoods now  
  
Spinning down from the clouds  
Like a tornado  
Spinnin out of control  
Like a psychedelic soul  
With a rhythm hittin harder  
Than Larry Holmes  
Come your long tall  
Daddies of rock and roll  
  
Take me to your backwoods now  
Take me to your backwoods now  
  
Mr Uplift Mofo  my man Bo Diddley  
Hit sippin a bottle of nickle ripple  
Play the lickity split finger licking licks  
For all you wicked city slick chicks  
  
And all you nitty gritty hick  
Well make your nipples ripple  
Make you wanna dip your dipple  
Make you wanna soak your hickory stick  
Because my man has a grip on it  
And I do mean on it  
Which brings to mind  
A very sinister minister kind of guy  
A man named Little Richard  
Born to make them bitches stir  
Thats right hell make the sweet substance drip  
From the middle of your hillbilly lips  
And like the farmer milk his cow  
The Howling Wolf will howl  
And since times does allow  
You all can  
  
Take me to your backwoods now  
Take me to your backwoods now  
Take me to your backwoods now
