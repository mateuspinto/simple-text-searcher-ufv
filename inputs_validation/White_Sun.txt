Horizon of blue hills are rollin  
Walkin with you through a field of red stones  
I been confused from voices callin callin to me  
Where the white sun has shown  
And I slip away  
Down by the water  
And I slip away  
Down by the sea  
Take love and give love  
Its got to be free  
  
The old man is weak but strength comes from him  
A smile full of youth and a gleam in his eye  
His garden is green and seems overflowin  
And his dreams await in his rockin chair sky  
  
And I slip away  
Down by the water  
And I slip away  
Down by the sea  
Take love and give love  
Its got to be free
