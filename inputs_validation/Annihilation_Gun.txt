Weapons of mass distraction are used by politicians and conspiracy theorists  
Within their reach  
The entire solar system withstanding geographical combat  
Annihilation is one source of political free speech  
In a world of nuclear devastation doom and deteonation  
In a world of curiosity beyond the imagination  
Every man and woman decides to hide the conspiracy behind global armageddon  
When the entire planet prepares for destruction  
Connecting their minds with others through telepathy  
In the common sense of human curiosity  
Destroy the entire world and get every man and woman out of nowhere  
  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look out for everywhere under the sun  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look here there and everywhere  
  
People use their superhuman powers to discover the dark and dangerous world  
Of hypothetical secrets  
In most cases sometimes he or she confess why they regret  
In my opinion gubernatorial fear is far from over  
The conspiracy is nowhere beyond our greatest selfdestructive endeavor  
More and more human beings make connections  
And its part of an allout worldwide chain reaction  
Keep staring at the annihilation gun before its too late  
One year from now the entire worlds about to detonate  
  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look out for everywhere under the sun  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look here there and everywhere  
  
All nations will selfdestruct according to research scientists  
The bomb will explode in many countries where nuclear weapons exist  
Search for the enemy within your secret human desire  
Stare at the fugutives caught in the crossfire  
Stare at the antiterrorsts standing higher  
Look at the dangerous cheaters taking a stand  
Nuclear detours fall pass the right human hand  
Find one or more antiterrorism activist fighting for freedom  
Be sure the hidden enemy will escape from the kingdom  
  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look everywhere under the sun  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look here there and everywhere  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look everywhere under the sun  
Look out for the annihilation gun  
Look here there and everywhere
