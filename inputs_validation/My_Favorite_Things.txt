Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens  
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens  
Brown paper packages tied up with strings  
These are a few of my favorite things  
  
Cream colored ponies and crisp apple strudel  
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles  
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings  
These are a few of my favorite things  
  
Girls in white dresses and blue satin sashes  
Snowflakes that stay on your nose and eye lashes  
Silver white winters that melt into springs  
These are a few of my favorite things  
  
When the dog bites  
When the bee stings  
When Im feeling sad  
I simply remember my favorite things  
And then i dont feel so bad
