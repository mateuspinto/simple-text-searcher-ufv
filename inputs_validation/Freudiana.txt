I was alone in my room feeling sorry for myself  
Call me a prophet of doom I could think of nothing else  
I found a freudian book gathering dust upon my shelf  
I thought Ill give it a look would it hurt or would it help  
  
Freudiana do you want to be somebody  
Freudiana do you want to change the world  
  
I met the wolfman and the ratman annao and little hans  
They were walking on a tightrope I never thought they had a chance  
And then a hand reached out to hold them just before they tumbled down  
But I was standing in a quicksand and I could not feel the ground  
  
Freudiana do you want to be somebody  
Freudiana do you want to change the world  
  
I look back and try to find the part of me I dont know  
I wont stop till I see the truth Theres such a long way to go  
  
I saw a picture of a stranger but I dont understand  
He had a ring around his finger and something burning in his hand  
And I wanted him to teach me and I needed to believe  
But the shadows that he threw me were intended to deceive  
  
Freudiana do you want to be somebody  
Freudiana do you want to change the world
