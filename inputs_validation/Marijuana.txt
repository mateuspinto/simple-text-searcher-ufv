Marijuana The government wants to test me when I pee  
Words and Music Brian Robbins  
  
Well once upon a time in 1776  
Thomas Jefferson signed his name on a piece of marijuana  
And this document was a symbol of freedom and of liberty  
At least for the rich white gentry  
  
As time marched along  
This plant that I refer to has been used for everything  
From medicine to the American flag  
And now it seems to me  
That somewhere along the way  
Things got messed up yeah messed up  
  
Oh marijuana  
A gift of God to my brothers and me  
Oh marijuana  
Now the government wants to test me when I pee  
  
Well some say a conspiracy  
Of the petrochemical and pulppaper industries combined  
Ha to kill the compitition  
Government hysteria monopoly and conflict of interest  
With total impunity  
  
Yeah so if you dont buy the conspiracy  
Just look at the reality  
That your tax dollars go  
To spray poison on the fields of a farmer in South America  
And as an added bonus  
Your neighbor might be the proud recipions of that poison weed  
  
Oh marijuana  
Now the government wants to test me when I pee  
Oh marijuana  
A gift of god to my brothers and me  
Oh marijuana  
You cant legislate your own morality  
Oh marijuana  
The government wants to test me when I pee  
  
Reefer madness chronic sadness  
What is the halflife of bad propaganda  
Policies fail denied bail  
You made him a demon now pay for his trip to prison  
Hired to promote the status quo  
But what is the shelf life of bad legislation  
The hypocrite smirks its a moral disgrace  
As he reads from a law that was written  
About the same time that he had  
His last original thought  
  
Well the men said he was dying  
And the nausea and the pain left him wasting away  
And unable to keep a meal down  
So he tried everything a prescription could obtain  
But to no avail  
The side effects were worse than the pain  
So now he breaks the law  
To use the one thing that seems to help him out  
And the people say Oh hes just getting high  
But not to change the subject but  
Didnt you ever wonder why getting highs a crime  
Yeah a crime  
  
Oh marijuana a gift to god to my brothers and me  
Oh marijuana now the government wants to test me when I pee  
Oh marijuana the government wants to test me when I pee  
Oh marijuana the government wants to test me when I pee  
Oh marijuana the government wants to test me when I pee  
Oh marijuana this is the part when everyone would sing along aha when I pee
