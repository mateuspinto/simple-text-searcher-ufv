Sunrise doesnt last all morning  
A cloudburst doesnt last all day  
Seems my love is up  
And has left you with no warning  
But its not always going  
To be this grey  
  
All things must pass  
All things must pass away  
  
Sunset doesnt last all evening  
A mind can blow those clouds away  
After all this my love is up  
And must be leaving  
Its not always going  
To be this grey  
  
All things must pass  
All things must pass away  
  
All things must pass  
None of lifes strings can last  
So I must be on my way  
And face another day  
  
Now the darkness only stays at nighttime  
In the morning it will fade away  
Daylight is good  
At arriving at the right time  
Its not always  
Going to be this grey  
  
All things must pass  
All things must pass away  
All things must pass  
All things must pass away
