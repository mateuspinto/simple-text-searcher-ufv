Everybody bogey  
Dig that bogey beat  
Man that bogey rhythm  
Smells so clean and sweet  
Everybody bogey  
Bogey on to the street  
Without bogey music  
Life is incomplete  
Without bogey music  
Life is incomplete  
Everybody bogey  
Dig that bogey beat  
  
If you little bogeys  
Want to sing along  
Clean your bogey act up  
And learn the bogey song  
Without bogey music  
Life is incomplete  
Without bogey music  
Life is incomplete  
Bogey music bogey music  
Bogey music bogey music  
  
Alright here we are now  
Tonight in bogey land  
  
Bogey music bogey music  
Well when the younger bogeys  
Here that bogey sound  
Every little bogey  
Got to bogey down  
Bogey man bogey  
Bogey man bogey  
Bogey man bogey on down  
Bogey music bogey music bogey music  
Bogey music bogey music bogey music  
Bogey music bogey man bogey on down  
Bogey music  
  
All you little bogeys  
I want you to sing along  
Clean your bogey act up  
And learn the bogey song  
Without bogey music  
Life is incomplete  
You know it is suckers  
Bogey music bogey music  
Bogey music bogey music
