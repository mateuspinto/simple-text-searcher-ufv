Little emerald bird  
Wants to fly away  
If I cup my hand  
Could I make him stay  
  
Little emerald soul  
Little emerald eye  
Little emerald soul  
Must you say goodbye  
  
All the things that we pursue  
All that we dream  
Are composed as nature knew  
In a feather green  
  
Little emerald bird  
As you light afar  
It is true I heard  
God is where you are  
  
Little emerald soul  
Little emerald eye  
Little emerald bird  
We must say goodbye
