This will be the day  
That you will hear me say  
That I will never run away  
  
I am here for you  
Love is meant for two  
Now tell me what youre gonna do  
  
If I gave you diamonds and pearls  
Would you be a happy boy or a girl  
If I could I would give you the world  
But all I can do is just offer you my love  
  
Which one of us is right  
If we always fight  
Why cant we just let love decide Let love decide  
  
Am I the weaker man  
Because I understand  
That love must be the master plan Love is the master plan  
  
If I gave you diamonds and pearls  
Would you be a happy boy or a girl  
If I could I would give you the world  
But all I can do is just offer you my love  
  
D to the I to the A to the M  
O to the N to the D to the pearls of love  
D to the I to the A to the M To the M  
O to the N to the D to the pearls of love  
  
There will come a time There will come a time  
When love will blow your mind Blow your mind  
And everything youll look for youll find Take a look inside  
  
That will be the time That will be the time  
That everything will shine Forever  
So bright it makes you colorblind you will be color blind  
  
If I gave you diamonds and pearls  
Would you be a happy boy or a girl  
If I could I would give you the world  
All I can do is just offer you my love  
  
If I gave you diamonds and pearls Pearls  
Would you be a happy boy or a girl Yeah yeah  
If I could I would give you the world Give you the world
