Accidentally I saw you this morning you were lovely dressed in your wedding
gown  
And they say that you married a stranger to me that had drifted to our old
hometown  
Accidentally youve met him one evening and you say it was love at first sight  
Accidentally on purpose youve married accidentally on purpose for spite  
Cause I saw out cheating and running around  
And I was just a fool with a heart of a clown  
Accidentally you were mistaken that night accidentally on purpose for spite  
  
Cause I saw out cheating
