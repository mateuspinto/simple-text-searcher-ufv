I see your red door and I want to paint it black  
No colors anymore I want them to turn black  
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes  
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes  
I see a line of cars and theyre all painted black  
With flowers and my love both never to come back  
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away  
Never see the sight of me that changes every day  
I want you to paint it paint it paint it paint it black  
Yeah paint it paint it paint it paint it black yeah  
I want you to paint it paint it paint it paint it black yeah  
No more will my dreams eagle turn a deeper blue  
Handcuffed handcuffed  
I could not foresee this thing happening to you  
If I look hard enough into the setting sun  
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes  
I look inside myself and see my heart is black  
I see my red door and it has been painted black  
Painted black  
Paint it paint it paint it paint it black yeah  
Painted black  
Paint it paint it paint it paint it black yeah  
Painted black  
Paint it paint it paint it paint it black yeah  
Painted black  
Paint it paint it paint it paint it black as night black as tar  
Painted black  
Wanna see the sun turnin outside  
Painted black painted black  
Paint it paint it paint it paint it black yeah
