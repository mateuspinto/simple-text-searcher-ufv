World peace is none of your business  
You must not tamper with arrangements  
Work hard and sweetly pay your taxes  
Never asking what for  
  
Oh oh you poor little fool  
Oh oh you fool  
  
World peace is none of your business  
Police will stun you with their stun guns  
Or theyll disable you with tasers  
Thats what governments for  
  
Oh oh you poor little fool  
Oh oh you fool  
  
World peace is none of your business  
So would you kindly keep your nose out  
The rich must profit and get richer  
And the poor must stay poor  
  
Oh oh you poor little fool  
Oh oh you fool  
  
Each time you vote you support the process  
Each time you vote you support the process  
Each time you vote you support the process  
Brazil Bahrain  
Oh Egypt Ukraine  
So many people in pain  
  
No more you poor little fool  
No more you fool
