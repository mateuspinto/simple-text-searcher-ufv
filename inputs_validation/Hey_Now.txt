Im a menace to society baby  
The police want to relocate me  
They run up with gun up but they cant faze me  
They wanted to come up but they aint crazy got  
I ride one in the chain with gun on top  
Six train Chevrolet rolln without no top  
Got them hydraulics is dumpin and make it drop  
California to Virginia Timmy makin it hot  
Takin long rides in a G4 plane  
XMan to the stage got em goin insane  
Yeah nigga got the world sayin my name  
Im bout to make a little change Im a keep it the same  
X to the Z baby run up on ya hittin corners  
Phantom platinum grill  
X be the life of the party  
Dont be scared girl reach out and touch somebody  
  
Can you feel the speakers jumpin  
Other cats surroundin but they wont say nothin  
Muggin in the club like they wanna do somethin  
Feelin kinda rowdy huh

Cause they musta seen what a girl pulled up in  
In the club like they wanna do somthin

Hey Now Hey Now  
  
Hey girl look where I live  
40 acres and a Maybach Benz  
You wanted to party but I got biz  
This aint entertainin Im feedin my kids  
On a 4oh5 in the car pool lane  
Got to hit some corners Im ridin the cane  
Wanna ride out to a island and tan your frame  
And just waste away a couple of days  
Holla back at me  
Look where I rap make the crowd get loud like the sound of a gat  
LA on my baseball hat where they wanna ride up on you in that black on black  
Move betta bounce like a mother  
When brother got mass weapons of war with each other  
X getting big not ready to die yet my militant mindset  
Got you runnin for cover  
  
Can you feel the speakers jumpin  
Other cats surroundin but they wont say nothin  
Muggin in the club like they wanna do somethin  
Feelin kinda rowdy huh  
Hey Now Hey Now  
All the girls mean muggin  
Cause they musta seen what a girl pulled up in  
In the club like they wanna do somthin  
Feelin kinda rowdy huh  
Hey Now Hey Now

I got a moon roof we poppin up out of  
Look at the whole world they talkin about us  
I got a mean hook to rattle ya body  
  
I wanna talk a little pick ya brain  
Wanna see you in somethin little walk around the plane  
I got a lot to gain getting my record off the ground  
Like David Blaine  
So now what you know bout me Im a selfmade man from poverty  
Now I own a lot of property  
I pimp rides lifestyles and companies  
Now let me spit you the facts  
I used to hustle the corner but I aint bringin you that  
Im like swingin a bat run at yo kneecaps for comin out ya face like that  
Baby girl touchin my chain now let me tell you who I aint  
Bitch you cant run no games A gangsta baby aint nothing changed  
  
Can you feel the speakers jumpin  
Other cats surroundin but they wont say nothin  
Muggin in the club like they wanna do somethin  
Feelin kinda rowdy huh  
Hey Now Hey Now  
All the girls mean muggin  
Cause they musta seen what a girl pulled up in  
In the club like they wanna do somthin  
Feelin kinda rowdy huh
