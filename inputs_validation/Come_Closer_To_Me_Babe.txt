Come closer to me babe  
And the night will come much closer too  
Cant you see the light  
Drawing pictures nearer in the skies  
  
What is it that you whisper  
When you close your eyes  
Come closer to me babe  
Is it me its all about  
And who is it that youre always  
Calling in your sleep  
Who is Sylvia  
  
Goodnight baby Please  
Come on home  
Come on home  
Come on home soon  
Goodnight baby X4  
  
Come closer to me now  
For I know theres something you must tell me  
When slumber slips between your lips  
Will the secrets ooze out easily  
  
What is it that you whisper  
When you close your eyes  
Come closer to me babe  
Is it me its all about  
And who is it that youre always  
Calling in your sleep  
Who is Sylvia  
  
Goodnight baby Please  
Come on home X2  
Come on home soon  
Goodnight baby X4
