Verse 1  
Lord I come into Your presence  
Here I stand in awesome reverence  
Falling before the wonder of Your Name  
Humbly now Lord I surrender  
This offering to You forever  
Take all I am and use me Lord I pray  
  
Make me what You want me to be  
Teach me Your ways  
  
Chorus  
I lay down my life for You  
Throw down my crowns before You  
Give up my all for Your Name  
My Saviour how I adore You  
Healer my heart longs for You  
Jesus Youre worthy to be praised  
  
Bridge  
Jesus You are Lord forever x16  
Jesus You are Lord  
  
Chorus  
I lay down my life for You  
Throw down my crowns before You  
Give up my all for Your Name  
My Saviour how I adore You  
Healer my heart longs for You  
Jesus Youre worthy to be praised
