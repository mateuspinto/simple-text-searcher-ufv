Last night I heard the screaming  
Loud voices behind the wall  
Another sleepless night for me  
It wont do no good to call  
The police always come late  
If they come at all  
  
And when they arrive  
They say they cant interfere  
With domestic affairs  
Between a man and his wife  
And as they walk out the door  
The tears well up in her eyes  
  
Last night I heard the screaming  
Then a silence that chilled my soul  
I prayed that I was dreaming  
When I saw the ambulance in the road  
And the policeman said  
Im here to keep the peace  
Will the crowd disperse  
I think we all could use some sleep
