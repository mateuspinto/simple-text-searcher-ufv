Pickin wasnt easy  
Kept you brown and thin  
Been a child for every season  
That the fruit was on the limb  
  
Pack the truck Maria  
Tell the kids were off again  
Cross a dozen states or more  
Well teach em what we can  
  
Teach em what we can  
We cant do more  
The land is good  
But still the livins poor  
  
Harvest in September  
Drought in mid July  
Januarys peeking  
Through a white lace gypsy sky  
  
March rolls into April  
Then plant and pray for rain  
Sweat like hell in August  
Run the circle once again  
  
Run the circle once again  
And then once more  
The land is good  
But still the livins poor  
  
Oregon in August  
Michigan in May  
Tryin to make enough  
To keep my family on its way  
  
And buy the pickin boss a drink  
To keep working every day  
You know it isnt honest  
But you do it anyway  
  
Do it anyway  
To keep alive  
Do it anyway to keep alive
