Happiness hit her like a train on a track  
Coming towards her stuck still no turning back  
She hid around corners and she hid under beds  
She killed it with kisses and from it she fled  
  
The dog days are over  
The dog days are done  
The horses are coming so you better run  
  
Run fast for your mother run fast for your father  
Run for your children for your sisters and brothers  
Leave all your love and your loving behind you  
Cant carry it with you if you want to survive  
  
The dog days are over  
The dog days are done  
Can you hear the horses  
Cause here they come  
  
And I never wanted anything from you  
Except everything you had  
And what was left after that too oh  
  
Run fast for your mother and fast for your father  
Run for your children for your sisters and your brothers  
Leave all your love and your loving behind  
Cant carry it with you if you want to survive  
  
The dog days are over  
The dog days are done  
Can you hear the horses  
Cause here they come  
  
The dog days are over  
The dog days are gone  
Here they come
