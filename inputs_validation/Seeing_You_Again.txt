Seeing you again  
Was like meeting for the first time  
In a foggy dream so many years ago  
Strangers in an airport  
Searching for a word to break the ice  
Holding you again  
Even for the briefest moment  
Made me realize how much I love you still  
Wanting you to want me  
Still not knowing if you ever will  
  
Seeing you again  
Seeing you again  
Was the sweetest torture  
I may ever know  
Seeing you again  
Seeing you again  
Made me wish  
Id never let you go  
  
Seeing you again  
Running free along the beaches  
Where our shadows first  
Began to intertwine  
Listening to your laughter  
Wishing that you love could still be mine  
  
Seeing you again  
Seeing you again  
Was the sweetest torture  
I may ever know  
Seeing you again  
Seeing you again  
Made me wish  
Id never let you go  
  
Did you only come to say  
Youre sorry  
Or give it one more try  
Or did you only need to see  
There was nothing left for me  
Inside worth saving  
Running for your train  
You smiled back through the doorway  
Like you used to  
When our hearts still beat as one  
And as I turned away  
I knew the lonely days had just begun  
  
Seeing you again  
Seeing you again  
Was the sweetest torture  
I may ever know  
Seeing you again  
Seeing you again  
Made me wish  
Id never let you go  
  
Seeing you again  
Seeing you again  
Was the sweetest torture  
I may ever know  
Seeing you again  
Seeing you again  
Made me wish  
Id never let you go
