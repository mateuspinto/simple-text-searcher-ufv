In a little cafe just the other side of the border  
She was just sitting there givin me looks that made my mouth water  
So I started walking her way  
She belonged to that man Jose  
And I knew yes I knew I should leave  
When I heard her say yeah  
  
Come a little bit closer  
Youre my kind of man  
So big and so strong  
Come a little bit closer  
Im all alone  
And the night is so long  
  
So we started to dance  
In my arms she felt so inviting  
That I just couldnt resist  
Just one little kiss so exciting  
Then I heard the guitar player say  
Vamoose Joses on his way  
Then I knew yes I knew I should run  
But then I heard her say yeah  
  
Come a little bit closer  
Youre my kind of man  
So big and so strong  
Come a little bit closer  
Im all alone  
And the night is so long  
  
Then the music stopped  
When I looked the cafe was empty  
Then I heard Jose say  
Man you know youre in trouble plenty  
So I dropped my drink from my hand  
And through the window I ran  
And as I rode away  
I could hear her say to Joscute yeah  
  
Come a little bit closer  
Youre my kind of man  
So big and so strong  
Come a little bit closer  
Im all alone  
And the night is so long  
  
La lalala lala  
La lalala lala  
Ho ho lala  
La la lala
