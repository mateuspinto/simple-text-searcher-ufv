All things bright and beautiful  
All creatures great and small  
All things wise and wonderful  
The Lord God made them all  
  
Each little flower that opens  
Each little bird that sings  
He made their glowing colours  
He made their tiny wings  
  
All things bright and beautiful  
All creatures great and small  
All things wise and wonderful  
The Lord God made them all  
  
The purpleheaded mountain  
The river running by  
The sunset and the morning  
That brightens up the sky  
  
All things bright and beautiful  
All creatures great and small  
All things wise and wonderful  
The Lord God made them all  
  
The cold wind in the winter  
The pleasant summer sun  
The ripe fruits in the garden  
He made them every one  
  
All things bright and beautiful  
All creatures great and small  
All things wise and wonderful  
The Lord God made them all  
  
The tall trees in the greenwood  
The meadows for our play  
The rushes by the water  
To gather every day  
  
All things bright and beautiful  
All creatures great and small  
All things wise and wonderful  
The Lord God made them all  
  
He gave us eyes to see them  
And lips that we might tell  
How great is God Almighty  
Who has made all things well  
  
All things bright and beautiful  
All creatures great and small  
All things wise and wonderful  
The Lord God made them all
