Aye aye aye  
Lalala lalala lalala  
Aye aye aye  
Lalala lalala  lalala  
Aye aye aye  
Aye aye aye  
Aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye aye  
  
Im gonna tell you a story  
And theres no moral to be made  
But dont forget when your dancing  
That somehow the piper must be paid  
  
Down on the Nile in the southern seas  
There lives a lassy named Minne Breeze  
And all the natives agree that shes  
The hottest thing in Trinidad  
  
When Minne dances I guarantee  
With every move of her vertebrae  
The temperature jump up ten degree  
In Trinidad that isnt bad  
  
Aye aye aye they call her Minne from Trinidad  
Aye aye aye they all love Minne from Trinidad  
Aye aye aye and all the natives would be so sad  
If Minne ever left Trinidad  
  
Although the natives loved Minne so  
Minne had herself a steady bow  
A fellow known as Calypso Joe  
And Minnie swore theyd never part  
  
But they stepped in only as they could  
Min won a contest for dancing good  
So she went away to Hollywood  
When Joe heard that it broke his heart  
  
Aye aye aye they call her Minne from Trinidad  
Aye aye aye she wasnt good but she wasnt bad  
Aye aye aye Calypso Joe was so very sad  
When Minne up and left Trinidad  
  
In Hollywood Minne traveled far  
They changed her name to Minne Lamar  
And pretty soon she became a star  
The siren of the picture show  
  
But one day Minne got awful mad  
A guy got fresh and she said You cad  
My heart belongs to my Trinidad  
My Trinidad Calypso Joe  
  
Aye aye aye they call her Minne from Trinidad  
Aye aye aye in Hollywood Minne met her cad  
Aye aye aye but there is only one native lad  
Gets chinny with Minne from Trinidad  
  
So Minnie gave up her dough and fame  
And she went back to from where she came  
But when she got there she heard with shame  
That her Calypso Joe was dead  
  
When Minne heard that she almost died  
She took a gun to try suicide  
But as she started to shoot  
She cried I think Id rather live instead  
  
Aye aye aye they call her Minne from Trinidad  
Aye aye aye she went away and they were so sad  
Aye aye aye but now the natives are mighty glad  
Cause Minne came back to Trinidad  
  
Aye aye aye they call her Minne from Trinidad  
Aye aye aye they all love Minne from Trinidad  
Aye aye aye and all the natives will be so sad  
If Minne Minne came back to Trinidad  
  
Aye aye aye  
Aye aye aye  
Aye aye aye  
Aye aye aye  
Aye aye aye  
Aye aye aye aye aye  
  
For Minne  
Minne for Minne for Minne  
Minne  
Come home you Minne poor Minne  
Minne came back to Trinidad
