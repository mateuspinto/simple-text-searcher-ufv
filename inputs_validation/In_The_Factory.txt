Its hard to believe  
In the factory  
How they made you  
And they made me  
  
Made of ideas  
Made to think and feel  
Do you feel too much  
Do you feel too real  
  
Youre so full of life  
What do you want with mine  
How I loved you once  
How I loved you twice  
  
Did I have to pay  
Such a heavy price  
How I loved you more  
Than my own life  
  
Just to be  
You and me  
Almost real  
Almost free  
  
Its hard to believe  
In the factory  
How the satin feels  
And the diamonds gleam  
  
How they made our eyes  
Made our hearts and minds  
How they built us to  
Leave it all behind  
  
Just to be  
You and me  
Almost real  
Almost free  
  
Just to be  
You and me  
Almost real  
Almost free
