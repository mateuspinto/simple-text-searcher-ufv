Brown girl in the ring  
Tra la la la la  
This is the story of El Lute  
A man who was born to be hunted like a wild animal  
Because he was poor  
But he refused to accept his fate  
And today his honor has been restored  
  
He was only nineteen  
When was sentenced to die  
For something that somebody else did  
And blamed on El Lute  
Then they changed it to life  
And so he could escape  
From then only chased him  
And searched for him day and night  
All over Spain  
But the search was in vain  
For El Lute  
  
He had only seen the dark side of life  
The man they called El Lute  
And he wanted a home  
Just like you and like me  
In a country where all would be free  
Though he taught himself  
To read and to write  
It didnt help El Lute  
He was one who had dared to escape overnight  
They had to find  
El Lute  
  
Soon the fame of his tale  
Spread like wild fire  
All over the land  
Were the prize on his head  
People still gave him bread  
And they gave him a hand  
For they knew he was right  
And his fight was their fight  
  
No one gave you a chance  
In the Spain of those days  
On was every place  
They had put up the face of El Lute  
And he robbed where he could  
Just like once Robin Hood  
They finally caught him  
And that seemed the end  
But they caught him in vain  
Cause a change came for Spain  
And El Lute  
  
He had only seen the dark side of life  
And then freedom really came to his land  
And also to El Lute  
Now he walks in the line  
Of a sunny new day  
The man they call El Lute
