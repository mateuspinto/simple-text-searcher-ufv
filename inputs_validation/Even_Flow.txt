Freezin rests his head on a pillow made of concrete again  
Oh Feelin maybe he will see a little better set of days  
Oh hand out faces that he sees time again aint that familiar  
Oh dark grin he cant help when hes happy he looks insane  
Even flow  
  
Thoughts arrive like butterflies  
Oh he dont know  
So he chases them away  
Someday yet hell begin his life again  
Life again  
  
Kneelin looking through the paper though he doesnt know how to read  
Prayin now to something that has never showed him anything  
Oh feelin understands the weather or that winters on its way yeah  
Oh ceilings few and far between are the legal halls of shame  
Even flow  
  
Thoughts arrive like butterflies  
Oh he dont know  
So he chases them away  
Someday yet hell begin his life again  
Whispering hands carry him away  
Him away him away  
Yeah  
Woo  
Oh yeah yeah
