Blues hearted lady sleepy was she  
Love for the devil brought her to me  
Tears of a thousand drawn to her sin  
Seasons of wither holdin me in  
  
Ooh woe is me I feel so badly for you  
Ooh woe is me I feel so sadly for you  
In time bound to lose your mind  
Live on borrowed time  
Take the wind right out of your sail  
  
Fireflies dance in the heat of  
Hound dogs that bay at the moon  
My ship leaves in the midnight  
Cant say Ill be back too soon  
  
They awaken far far away  
Heat of my candle show me the way  
Tears of a thousand drawn to her sin  
Seasons of wither holdin me in  
  
Ooh woe is me I feel so badly for you  
Ooh woe is me I feel so sadly for you  
In time bound to lose your mind  
Live on borrowed time  
Take the wind right out of your sail
