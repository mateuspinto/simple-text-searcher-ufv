Grapefruit moon one star shining shining down on me  
Heard that tune and now Im pining honey cant you see  
Cause every time I hear that melody well something breaks inside  
And the grapefruit moon one star shining cant turn back the tide  
  
Never had no destination could not get across  
You became my inspiration oh but what a cost  
Cause every time I hear that melody well something breaks inside  
And the grapefruit moon one star shining is more than I can hide  
  
Now Im smoking cigarettes and I strive for purity  
And I slip just like the stars into obscurity  
Cause every time I hear that melody well puts me up a tree  
And the grapefruit moon one star shining is all that I can see
