MaryAnn  
Youre better than the world  
They took a lot of time  
Getting it right on this girl  
I said MaryAnn  
Youre better than the world  
They did a lot of things right on this girl  
  
Had a lot of girlfriends  
I should have known them  
Click your heels and count back from there  
Do you want to go back  
You should have known  
That the butterfly in reverse here is me  
  
MaryAnn  
Youre better than the world  
They took a lot of time  
Getting it right on this girl  
I said MaryAnn  
Youre better than the world  
They did a lot of things right on this girl  
  
Whered you want to go to  
With nothing beside you  
But webbing and curfews and rain  
And everything that hurts you  
Is locked up inside you  
Like butterflies with wings  
And other perfect things  
  
We go swimming in the sunshine  
Dangling from clotheslines  
Separate and fall into me  
But did you ever see me  
Me absolutely  
Me but all you but still me  
  
MaryAnn  
Youre better than the world  
They took a lot of time  
Getting it right on this girl I said  
MaryAnn  
Youre better than the world  
They did a lot of things right on this girl
