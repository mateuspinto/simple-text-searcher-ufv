Happy little day Jimmy went away  
Met his little Jenny on a public holiday  
A happy pair they made so decorously laid  
Neath the gay illuminations all along the promenade  
Its so good to know theres still a little magic in the air  
Ill weave my spell  
  
Jenny will you stay  tarry with me pray  
Nothing ere need come between us tell me love what do you say   
Oh no I must away to my mum in disarray  
If my mother should discover how I spent my holiday  
It would be of small avail to talk of magic in the air  
Ill say farewell  
  
O rock of ages do not crumble love is breathing still  
O lady moon shine down a little people magic if you will  
  
Jenny pines away writes a letter everyday  
We must ever be together nothing can my love erase  
Oh no Im compromised I must apologise  
If my lady should discover how I spent my holidays  
Oooh oooh oooh oooh  
Ooh oh oh oh oh ha
