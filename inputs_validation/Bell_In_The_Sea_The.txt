I dreamed I rolled on the ocean floor  
In the sunken bones of a broken ship  
On the shadow line where whispers creep  
To the world above from the world beneath  
  
On waves of silver I dreamed of gold  
Till I lost the peace that dreaming gives  
I dreamed of the moment of my own death  
That no one ever dreams and lives  
  
I dreamed I sailed to the mirrored edge  
Of that murky world for an iron bell  
That dragged me down to the ocean bed  
And rang to mark where my shadow fell  
  
On waves of silver I dreamed of gold  
Till I lost the peace that dreaming gives  
I dreamed of the moment of my own death  
That no one ever dreams and lives  
  
That no one ever dreams and lives  
That no one ever dreams and lives  
I dreamed I slept on the ocean bed  
And a silent grave of silver sand  
  
Rolled in the sway of an iron bell  
Ive heard it said when they go to sea  
On stormy nights you can hear her moan  
She tolls for the mourning of her own death  
  
And echoes here on the village stones  
On the waves of silver I dreamed of gold  
I dreamed of the moment of my own death  
That no one ever dreams and lives  
  
That no one ever dreams and lives  
That no one ever dreams and lives
