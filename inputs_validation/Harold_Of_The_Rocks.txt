It was a weekends eve  
I had sex on my breath  
I was looking for something to see  
With a borrowed black leather  
And my best fishing hat  
It was just WendyO and me  
  
We called ol swamp up on the telephone and said we was coming on down to pick
him up and then  
He said Hey Snappy me and Greenyll come along but only if we can bring a
friend His name is Harold  
  
So I Said OK  
  
Now we had a Swamper Greeny WendyO Stanley Harold of the Rocks and me  
We hopped into my dart and headed for the nightbreak to see a man they called
Schooly D  
Harold hes a friendly guy he rambles on and on hell talk the balls off a
rhinosaurus  
Fact is he just doesnt make much sense well Stan said  This guys pretty
bizarre Gus  
  
Harold Of The Rocks  
  
I saw Harold at a party Trouzy threw late one night  
I said Hey man do you remember me  
He said  well of course l do snap dad let me tell ya right about now Im lit
up like an old christmas tree  
Het bro you know Id like to thank you once again for letting me hang with
yaall across the bay When I look back at that night I get a warm spot across
my heart  
Then he shook my hand and walked away  
Thats the last I seen of Harold  
  
Harold Of The Rocks  
  
So in the end Swamper and Greeny finally succumb to the ways of Harold  
And in doing so each gave just a little bit of his soul away  
What a couple of dumbshits
