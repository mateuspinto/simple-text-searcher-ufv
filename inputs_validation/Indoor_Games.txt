Indoor fireworks amuse your kitchen staff  
Dusting plastic garlic plants  
They snigger in the drought  
When you ride through the parlor  
Wearing nothing but your armor  
Playing Indoor Games  
  
One string puppet shows amuse  
Your sycophantic friends  
Who cheer your rancid recipes  
In fear they might offend  
Whilst you loaf on your sofa  
Sporting falsies and a toga  
Playing Indoor Games Indoor Games  
  
Your mean teetotum spins arouse your seventh wife  
Who pats her sixty little skins  
And reinsures your life  
Whilst you sulk in your sauna  
cause you lost your jigsaw corner  
Playing Indoor Games Indoor Games  
  
Each afternoon you train baboons to sing  
Or swim in purple perspex water wings  
Come Saturday jump hopper Chelsea brigade  
High bendertrender its all Indoor Games  
  
No ball bagatelle incites  
Your children to conspire  
They slide across your frying pan  
And fertilize your fire  
Still you and Jones go madder  
Broken bonesbroken ladder  
Hey Ho
