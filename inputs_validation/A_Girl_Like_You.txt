You go to sleep I want to sail in your hair  
And when you speak you know you got to make sense  
You want to say that its me you know less  
I say a girl like you she was born to be blessed  
  
My hands are yours and you can take them from me  
And take my mouth I have nothing to say  
I want to fly to some other place  
I say a girl like you she was born to be kissed  
Born to be kissed  
  
One thousand times and your sisters too  
One thousand times a girl like you  
Youre gonna say that you want to be free  
But when you fall youll know youll fall back to me  
You want to fly and theres no disgrace  
I say a girl like you she was born to be blessed  
  
My hands are yours cause I dont know how to pray  
Take my mouth I have nothing to say  
I lift my heart up to a higher place  
Up to a girl like you who was born to be kissed  
Oh born to be kissed  
  
One thousand times and your sisters too  
One thousand times a girl like you  
  
One thousand times and your sisters too  
One thousand times a girl like you  
One thousand times and your mother too  
One thousand times a girl like you  
  
One thousand times and your sisters too  
One thousand times a girl like you  
Aw yeah  
And your sisters too  
One thousand times a girl like you  
Oh one thousand times and your sisters too  
One thousand times I said a girl like you  
Oh one thousand times and your sisters too
