Storm warning  
But theres no fear  
Lies forming  
The sacrament lays bare  
The sinner  
Will testify  
Theyll suffer  
When sacrificed on high  
The burning sermons purge their evil words  
Between the Hammer and the Anvil  
Force rises  
False rituals  
Baptises  
The body and the soul  
Our union  
Their fall from grace  
Confession confess your sins  
Will seal them to their fate  
The burning sermons will survive their curse  
Between the Hammer and the Anvil  
Transgression  
They prey on grief  
Our mission  
To purify belief  
This altar  
Gives power and light  
Theyll falter  
While we are shining bright  
The burning sermons consecrate their sin  
Between the Hammer and the Anvil  
Storm warning  
But theres no fear
