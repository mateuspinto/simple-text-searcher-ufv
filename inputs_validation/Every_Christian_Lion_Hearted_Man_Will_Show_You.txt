Oh solo Dominique Repeat x4  
  
Take this in hand  
Said he who stands  
Behind the chair  
A broken table there  
  
Every christian lion hearted man will show you  
Every christian lion hearted man will show you  
  
Oh solo Dominique Repeat x4  
  
Dont walk so tall  
Before you crawl  
  
For every child  
Is thinking of something wild  
  
Every christian lion hearted man will show you  
Every christian lion hearted man will show you  
  
Oh solo Dominique Repeat x3  
  
Every christian lion hearted man will show you  
Every christian lion hearted man will show you will show you  
  
Oh solo Dominique Repeat x3
