Evening brings the close of day  
Skies of blue begin to grey  
Crimson hues are fading in the west  
Evening ever brings to me  
Dreams of days that used to be  
Memories of those I love the best  
  
When shadows fall  
And trees whisper Day is ending  
My thoughts are ever wending home  
When crickets call  
My heart is forever yearning  
Once more to be returning home  
  
When the hills conceal the setting sun  
Stars begin apeeping one by one  
Night covers all  
And though fortune may forsake me  
Sweet dreams will ever take me home  
  
When the hills conceal the setting sun  
Stars begin apeeping one by one  
Night covers all  
And though fortune may forsake me  
Sweet dreams will ever take me home
