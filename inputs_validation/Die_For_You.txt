A hundred numbers on my wall  
Some with names I sometimes call  
I drop a coin and watch it fall  
Tryin to get connected to you  
  
A thousand hours all alone  
My softest pillow turns hard as stone  
This is the longest night on my own  
Lying here thinking of you  
  
Sometimes I shake my head  
And laugh to myself  
Id like start again with somebody else  
Im like a broken toy forgotten on the shelf  
  
Chorus  
Baby I could have been someone  
I could have been something  
It would have been nothing to die for you  
Baby youre going to need me  
Youd better believe me  
It would have been easy to die for you  
  
A milloin memories flood my brain  
Drown my sorrow  
Kill my pain  
Wets my thirst for you again  
Just another night to get through  
  
All my neighbors scream for quite at my door  
Shattered glass and torn up photos thrown on the floor  
Well I couldnt stand to see your pictures anymore  
  
Chorus  
  
These cuts are deep but you plead innocent  
Are you hell or are you heavensent  
Youre much too cold to know how much  
You meant to me yeah  
  
A billion tear drops fallen from my eyes  
But its just a joke now  
And Im laughing at your lies  
You made me hard as rock and now I realize  
  
Chorus
