I stand at your gate and the song that I sing is of moonlight  
I stand and I wait for the touch of your hand in the June night  
The roses are sighing a moonlight serenade  
  
The stars are a glow and tonight how their light sets me dreaming  
My love do you know that your eyes are like stars brightly beaming  
I bring you and sing you a moonlight serenade  
  
Let us stray till break of day in loves valley of dreams  
Just you and I a summer sky a heavenly breeze kissing the trees  
So dont let me wait come to me tenderly in the June night  
I stand at your gate and I sing you a song in the moonlight  
A love song my darling a moonlight serenade  
We can stay till break of day
