There are unsmiling faces and bright plastic chains  
And a wheel in perpetual motion  
And they follow the races and pay out the gains  
With no show of outward emotion  
  
And they think it will make their lives easier  
For god knows up till now its been hard  
But the game never ends when your whole world depends  
On the turn of a friendly card  
No the game never ends when your whole world depends  
On the turn of a friendly card  
  
Theres a sign in the desert that lies to the west  
Where you cant tell the night from the sunrise  
And not alls the kings horse and all the kings men  
Have prevented the fall of the unwise  
  
For they think it will make their lives easier  
And god knows its been hard  
But the game never ends when your whole world depends  
On the turn of a friendly card  
No the game never ends when your whole world depends  
On the turn of a friendly card  
  
But a pilgrim must follow in search of a shrine  
As he enters inside the cathedral
