I drank sixteen doubles for the price of one  
Trying to find the courage to talk to one  
I asked her for a dance  
Not a second glance  
My night had just begun  
  
Well I drink to the father and the holy ghost  
Im kneeling at the alter of my nightly post  
So Ill raise a glass not the first nor last  
Come join me in this toast  
  
Chorus  
Because the old black rums got a hold on me  
Like a dog wrapped round my leg  
And the old black rums got a hold on me  
Will I live for another day  
Hey Will I live for another day  
  
Well the queen of George street just went walking on by  
Walking on by with some guy who dont care  
That she stood in line  
Since half past nine  
And spent three hours on her hair On her hair  
  
Well her friend is looking at me with an evil grin  
I think the bloody racket might soon begin  
I must have said some thing  
To the George street queen  
The boys are joining in  
  
Chorus  
  
So I drank all of my money  
And I slept out in the rain  
Everyday is different but the nights theyre all the same  
You never see the sun on the old black rum  
But I know Im gonna do it again  
  
Chorus 2x
