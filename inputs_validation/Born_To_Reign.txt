I believe in God  
I believe in Destiny  
Not Destiny in the sense of all of our Exerts being predetermined  
But Destiny in the Sense of our ability to choose  
Our ability to choose who we are and who we are supposed to be  
  
Yo yo yo yo  
I was Born to reign  
Point Blank  
My name to be etched in stone  
My destiny preordained  
Trying to live righteous  
Fighting for life this my life  
Thats why I liked on my vices  
Tightening the vices of truth on the roofless  
This is rhyme and the crime and their minds is just useless  
The path of the poison the genesis of the genisi  
You and your boys trying to decide what to write  
But your hand is a sword and the blade has been forged  
Young minds getting gorged Stakes have been altered  
By lick or by weed and then hate gets exalted  
As art falls to greed Choices is Made thats the voices is laid  
On the track contract the soldier wage did you see his new benz  
But your like a syringe now proud of your binge  
  
Got a lot of new friends got a lot of new ends  
Bought a house up in the hills fronting shouts to the pen  
Giving false accounts of your accounts amounts  
Amounts the fans treason stands to reason since your inception  
Laced with deception and bred with false affection it must perish  
From the Terrace I see the fire burning the streets but I wont shield my eyes
to the heat  
Born to reign  
  
I was Born to reign  
  
I was Born to Reign
