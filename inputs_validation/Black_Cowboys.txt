Rainey Williams playground was the Mott Haven streets where he ran past
melted candles and flower wreaths names and photos of young black faces
whose death and blood consecrated these places Raineys mother said Rainey
stay at my side for you are my blessing you are my pride Its your love here
that keeps my soul alive I want you to come home from school and stay
inside  
  
Raineyd do his work and put his books away There was a channel showed a
western movie everyday Lynette brought him home books on the black cowboys of
the Oklahoma range and the Seminole scouts who fought the tribes of the Great
Plains Summer come and the days grew long Rainey always had his mothers
smile to depend on Along a street of stray bullets he made his way to the
warmth of her arms at the end of each day  
  
Come the fall the rain flooded these homes here in Ezekiels valley of dry
bones it fell hard and dark to the ground It fell without a sound Lynette
took up with a man whose business was the boulevard whose smile was fixed in
a face that was never off guard In the pipes neath the kitchen sink his
secrets he kept In the day behind drawn curtains in Lynettes bedroom he
slept  
  
Then she got lost in the days The smile Rainey depended on dusted away the
arms that held him were no more his home He lay at night his head pressed to
her chest listening to the ghost in her bones  
  
In the kitchen Rainey slipped his hand between the pipes From a brown bag
pulled five hundred dollar bills and stuck it in his coat side stood in the
dark at his mothers bed brushed her hair and kissed her eyes  
  
In the twilight Rainey walked to the station along streets of stone Through
Pennsylvania and Ohio his train drifted on Through the small towns of Indiana
the big train crept as he lay his head back on the seat and slept He awoke
and the towns gave way to muddy fields of green corn and cotton and an
endless nothin in between Over the rutted hills of Oklahoma the red sun
slipped and was gone The moon rose and stripped the earth to its bone
