As the mist leaves no scar  
On the dark green hill  
So my body leaves no scar  
On you and never will  
Through windows in the dark  
The children come the children go  
Like arrows with no targets  
Like shackles made of snow  
  
True love leaves no traces  
If you and I are one  
Its lost in our embraces  
Like stars against the sun  
  
As a falling leaf may rest  
A moment on the air  
So your head upon my breast  
So my hand upon your hair  
  
And many nights endure  
Without a moon or star  
So we will endure  
When one is gone and far  
  
True love leaves no traces  
If you and I are one  
Its lost in our embraces  
Like stars against the sun
