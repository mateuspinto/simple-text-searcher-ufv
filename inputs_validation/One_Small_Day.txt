If the stack is high against you  
And the hammers coming down  
And the time thats yours lies heavy in your hands  
Oh my sentimental friend  
The fast much reach an end  
  
Lying face down on the cold stone  
And they give their all to you  
But their all is slipping through your hands  
Oh my sentimental friend  
Your time will come again  
  
Chorus  
  
One day where I didnt die a thousand times  
Where I could satisfy this life of mine  
One small day  
One day where every hour could be a joy to me  
And live a life the way its meant to be  
One small day  
  
How many times has it turned against you  
How many times will they walk away  
How many times have you let depression win the fight  
Oh my sentimental friend  
Well walk as one again  
  
One day where I didnt die a thousand times  
Where I could satisfy this life of mine  
One small day  
One day where every hour could be a joy to me  
And live a life the way its meant to be  
One small day  
  
How many times has it turned against you  
How many times will they walk away  
  
One day where I didnt die a thousand times  
Where I could satisfy this life of mine  
One day where every hour could be a joy to me  
And live a life the way its meant to be  
  
One day where I wouldnt feel my senses die  
Where nothing made me hang my head and cry  
One day where I could see myself as others do  
Where I could feel the strength of love at hand  
  
One day where I didnt die a thousand times  
Where I could satisfy this life of mine  
One day where every hour could by a joy to me  
And live a life the way its meant to be
