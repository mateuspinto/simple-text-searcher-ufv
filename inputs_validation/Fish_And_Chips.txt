Fish and Chips  
A little coke and you oh babe  
Honey drips  
Two more to go oh babe  
Lets go on back  
The trip will be groovy oh babe  
Jump in the sack  
Flip your mood oh babe  
Come to me  
I really do love you oh babe  
Honey honey  
Honey dripper too oh babe  
Loved you before  
I loved you a long long time my love  
Loving you more  
Then I got to have more of  
Fish and chips
