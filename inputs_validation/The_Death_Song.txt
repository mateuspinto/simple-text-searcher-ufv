Were on a bullet and were headed straight into god  
Even hed like to end it too  
We take a pill get a face buy our ticket  
And we hope heaven is true  
I saw cop beat a priest on the TV  
And I know they killed our heroes too  
  
We sing the death song kids  
Because we got no future  
And we wanna be just like you  
We wanna be just like you  
We wanna be just like you  
We sing the death song kids  
  
We light a candle on a earth we made into hell  
And we pretend that were in heaven  
Each time we do we get the blind mans ticket  
And we know that nothing is true  
I saw a priest kill a cop on the TV  
And I know theyre our heroes too  
  
We sing the death song kids  
Because we got no future  
And we wanna be just like you  
We wanna be just like you  
We wanna be just like you  
We sing the death song kids  
We sing the death song kids  
  
We sing the death song kids  
We sing the death song kids  
We write our prayers on a little bomb  
Kiss it on the face and send it to God  
  
We sing the death song kids  
Because we got no future  
And we wanna be just like you  
We wanna be just like you  
We wanna be just like you  
We were the world but we got no future  
We wanna be just like you  
We wanna be just like you  
We wanna be just like you  
We were the world but we got no future  
We wanna be just like you  
We wanna be just like you  
We wanna be just like you  
  
We sing the death song kids  
  
with jesus our king
