Moved in a hired car and I find no way to run  
Hurts every moment longer had no time for fun  
Just something that I knew I had to do  
But through it all I kept my eyes on you  
  
I had an impulse to clear it all away  
I used the tactics make everybody pay  
Just something that I knew I had to do  
But through it all I kept my eyes on you  
  
Oh I keep it all clean Ive paid the graces there  
No kings of misuse no sellers of flesh  
Just something that I knew I had to do  
But through it all I kept my eyes on you  
Yeah through it all I kept my eyes on you  
But through it all I kept my eyes on you
