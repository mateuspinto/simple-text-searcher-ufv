Lover there will be another one  
To hover over you beneath the sun  
Tomorrow see the things that never come today  
  
When you see me fly away without you  
Shadow on the things you know  
Feathers fall around you  
And show you the way to go  
Its over  
Its over  
  
Nestle in your wings my little one  
A special morning brings another sun  
Tomorrow see the things that never come today  
  
When you see me fly away without you  
Shadow on the things you know  
Feathers fall around you and show you the way to go  
Its over  
Its over
