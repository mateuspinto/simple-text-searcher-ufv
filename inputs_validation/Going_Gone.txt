There is a lighthouse in the harbor  
Giving guidance with its light  
But I had no one to return to  
As I wander through life  
From the first time that I saw you  
Standing silent by the shore  
I knew my search was over  
And I would look for love no more  
Deep in the waters of love I am falling sinking like a stone  
Deep in my heart I can hear love calling  
Going once going twice going gone  
Going once going twice going gone  
There is a ship on the horizon  
Making its way against the wind  
And from the place where I stand watching  
I swear my ship is coming in  
Deep in the waters of love I am falling sinking like a stone  
Deep in my heart I can hear love calling  
Going once going twice going gone  
Going once going twice going gone  
Deep in the waters of love I am falling sinking like a stone  
Deep in my heart I can hear love calling  
Going once going twice going gone  
Going once going twice going gone
