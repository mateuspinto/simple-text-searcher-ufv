Styling you know you are styling  
So turn to the mirror and blow yourself a kiss  
It goes just like this  
Youve done it a thousand times  
Its as easy as drinking wine only now its blood  
Here it come again  
treating you so kind  
Till it comes again  
leaving you no mind  
Your feelings they flow without reason  
So look to the stars above and  
Blow it all away  
I come without warning  
Some call me morning  
I wipe all your tears away the evil ones I kill  
Here it comes again  
treating you so kind  
Till it comes again  
leaving you no mind  
Taking the form of pain this time  
It never treats you unkind  
Your followers lead them blind  
And suck away their lives  
Cause yours depends on it  
Here it comes again  
Chasing the night away
