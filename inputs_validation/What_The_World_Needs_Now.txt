What the world needs now  
Is love sweet love  
Its the only thing  
That theres just too little of  
  
Chorus  
What the world needs now  
Is love sweet love  
No not just for some  
But for everyone  
  
Lord we dont need another mountain  
There are mountains and hillsides  
Enough to climb  
There are oceans and rivers  
Enough to cross  
Enough to last  
Till the end of time  
  
What the world needs now  
Is love sweet love  
No not just for some  
But for everyone  
  
Lord we dont need another meadow  
There are cornfields and wheatfields  
Enough to grow  
And there are sunbeams and moonbeams  
Enough to shine  
So listen Lord  
If you want to know  
  
What the world needs now  
Is love sweet love  
Its the only thing  
That theres just too little of  
  
Chorus  
  
More love more love  
Everybody know that  
the world needs love  
Everybody Everybody knows that  
this world needs love  
This world the whole world  
the whole world needs love  
The whole world the whole world  
more love more lovin  
Theres not enough
