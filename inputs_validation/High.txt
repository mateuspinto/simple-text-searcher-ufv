High upon a mountain top  
Where the eagle builds his nest  
I shall go wandering  
Trying to put my mind at rest  
And I shall never cease  
Until the day I die  
  
He was once a friend of mine  
But I did not know or care  
Until she said goodbye  
I cried till I could hardly see  
The meaning of my life  
What do I do now  
  
High upon a mountain top  
Where the eagle builds his nest  
I shall go wandering  
Trying to put my mind at rest  
And I shall never cease  
Until the day I die
