Chorus  
A life as a stranger  
Hands through a wire  
Forbidden desires  
Are mine for life  
  
Looking from a spiral staircase  
At a man with a suitcase  
As he shades his eyes  
Watching from a stained glass shelter  
He bides his time and thinks  
There must be more to life than this  
  
Chorus  
  
The poet reads his words out loud  
To a makebelieve crowd  
In the quiet of his room  
Careful where the tears are falling  
He closed the book and cried  
There must be more to love than this  
See the boy on the walkway  
Where the young have their own say  
And it screams from the wall  
Hes writing for the hundredth time there  
I hate it all but  
There must be more to hate than this
