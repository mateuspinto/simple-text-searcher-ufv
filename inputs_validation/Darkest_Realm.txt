Million watts of music hell  
Screaming legions black metal  
Give it up with all youve got  
Here we come ready or not  
Deafening volume in power and black  
Light up the skies in an aural attack  
The darkest realm  
Billion light years in the rigs  
Interstellar searing licks  
Song of the demon at the helm  
Welcome to the darkest realm  
Deafening volume in power and black  
Light up the skies in an aural attack  
Metal and mayhem  Hardcore elite  
Crank up the volume  We will never be beat  
Thousands of souls in darkest realm  
Glorious choruses straight from hell  
Feeding off power in musical trance  
Life on the edge  Taking a chance
