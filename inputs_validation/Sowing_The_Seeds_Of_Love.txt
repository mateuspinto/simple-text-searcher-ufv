High time we made a stand and shook up the views of the common man  
and the love train rides from coast to coast  
DJs the man we love the most  
Could you be could you be squeaky clean and smash every hope of democracy as  
the head line says youre free to choose  
Theres egg on your face and mud on your shoes  
One of these days theyre gonna call it the blues yeah yeah  
  
Sowing the seeds of love seeds of love sowing the seeds  
Sowing the seeds of love seeds of love sowing the seeds  
  
I spy tears in their eyes they look to the skies  
for some kind of divine intervention  
Food goes to waste  
So nice to eat so nice to taste  
Politician granny with your high ideals  
have you no idea how the majority feels  
So with out love and a promised land  
were fools to the rules of a government plan  
Kick out the Style  
Bring back the Jam yeah yeah  
  
And anything is possible when youre sowing the seeds of love  
Anything is possible sowing the seeds of love  
sowing the seeds the birds and the bees my girlfriend and me in love  
Feel the pain talk about it if youre a worried man then shout about it  
  
Open hearts fell about it Open minds think about it  
Everyone read about it Every one scream about it everyone  
Everyone read about it read about it read it in the books  
in the crannies and the nooks there are books to read  
  
Sowing the seeds of love seeds of love sowing the seeds  
Sowing the seeds of love seeds of love sowing the seeds  
Sowing the seeds of love sowing the seeds  
sowing the seeds of love sowing the seeds of love  
Mister England sowing the seeds of love  
  
Time to eat all your words swallow your pride open your eyes  
High time we made a stand and shook up the view of the common man  
And the love train rides from coast to coast every minute of every hour  
I Love a Sunflower and I believe in love power Love Power Love Power  
  
Sowing the seeds An end to need And the Politics of Greed With Love
