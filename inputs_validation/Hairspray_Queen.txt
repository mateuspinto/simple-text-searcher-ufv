I was young my an you were mine  
My enemy you were my an I was young  
Your enemy you were my an I was young  
Your enemy you were my an I was once  
You ene  
  
You rang  
Your ears rang  
  
I was young my an you were mine  
My enemy you were my an I was young  
Your enemy you were my an I was young  
Your enemy you were my an I was once  
You ene  
  
At night wishfull godess  
At night crystal locket  
At night mouth of almounds  
At sight a fish full of garbage  
At night disco god  
  
I was young my an you were mine  
My enemy you were my an I was young  
Your enemy you were my an I was young  
Your enemy you were my an I was once  
You ene  
  
At night the wishfull godess  
At night crystal locket  
At night mouth of almounds  
At sight a fish full of garbage  
At night disco god  
  
I was young my an you were mine  
My enemy you were my an I was young  
Your enemy you were my an I was young  
Your enemy you were my an I was once  
You ene  
  
At night she was so modest  
At night crystal locket  
At night mouth of almounds  
At sight a fish full of garbage  
At night disco god  
  
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
