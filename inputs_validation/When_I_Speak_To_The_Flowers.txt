When I speak to the flowers in my backyard  
When I speak to the flowers in my backyard  
When I speak to the flowers in my backyard  
They tell me to leave you leave you behind  
They tell my to leave you just get you out of my mind  
They tell me to leave you leave you behind  
Ow forget all the good times that are making me blind  
  
I know you run around and youll never settle down  
And I should quit while Im still on top  
But when you hold me baby in your lovin arms  
I could love you forever baby but  
  
When I speak to the flowers in my backyard  
When I speak to the flowers in my backyard  
When I speak to the flowers in my backyard  
They tell me to leave you leave you behind  
They tell my to leave you just get you out of my mind  
They tell me to leave you just leave you behind  
Ow forget all the good times that are making me blind
