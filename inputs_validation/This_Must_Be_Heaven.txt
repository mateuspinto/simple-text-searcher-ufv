When I was much younger  
It used to happen every night  
I had a dream about a city dressed in lights  
And there were friends of mine  
I saw them time after time  
But I never knew their names  
And darling I swear  
I saw you there  
I know it sounds insane  
  
Sweet dreams of a child forgotten so easy  
I needed your smile to bring it all back to me  
I see all of my life as the road that brought me here  
Must be something went right  
I just know when youre near  
  
This must be heaven  
Have I found it what Ive been looking for  
This must be heaven  
Have I finally stumbled through the door  
  
How could I have doubted  
I guess I must have lost my place  
You turned on the light  
And I saw my life  
Reflected in your face  
  
Sweet dreams of a child forgotten so easy oh yeah  
I needed your smile to bring it all back to me  
I see all of my life as the road that brought me here  
Must be something went right  
I just know when youre near  
  
This must be heaven  
Have I found it what Ive been looking for  
This must be heaven  
Have I finally stumbled through the door  
  
And I always knew that there was something more  
  
Come closer to me now  
You fill me up Im overflowing  
Come closer to me now  
Come hold me tight and dont let go  
  
This must be heaven  
Have I found it what Ive been looking for  
This must be heaven  
Have I finally stumbled through the door
