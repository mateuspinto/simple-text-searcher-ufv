Shall I tell it again how we started as friends  
Who would run into one another now and again  
At the Yippee Cai O or the Mesa Dupree or a dozen different everyday places
to be  
I was living alone we were ever so brave on the telephone  
Would you care to come down for fireworks time  
We could each just reach we step out of line  
  
And the smell of the smoke and the lay of the land  
And the feeling of finding ones heart in ones hand  
And the tiny tin voice of the radio band singing love must stand  
Love forever and ever must stand  
  
Unbelievable you impossible me the fool who fell out of the family tree  
The fellow that found the philosophers stone deep underground like a
dinosaur bone  
Who fell into you at a quarter to two with a tear in your eye for the Fourth
of July  
For the patriots and the minutemen and the things you believe they believed in
then  
  
Such as freedom and freedoms land and the kingdom of God and the rights of
man  
With the tiny tin voice of the radio band singing love must stand  
Love forever and ever must stand and forever must stand  
  
Oh the smell of the smoke as we lay on the land  
And the feeling of finding my heart in my hand  
With the tiny tin voice of the radio band singing love must stand  
Love forever and ever must stand and forever must stand  
  
All on the Fourth of July on the Fourth of July
