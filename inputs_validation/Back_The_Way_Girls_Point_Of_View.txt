Back the way it was before  
Before the heart was broken  
Playing hookey making cookies  
We were always jokin  
Back the way it used to be  
Talks didnt end in a quarrel  
Everything seemed so normal  
Back the way it was before  
  
But now the limo pulls up to the door  
And she gets in  
She calls bye bye honey  
Here is some money  
I forgot the groceries  
  
Back the way it was before  
The chicken pox was easy  
We told each other everything  
And nobody was nosey  
Back the way it used to be  
When we were a happy family  
Nobody ever asked us  
If we wanted tiny little sandwiches  
Sent up to our room
