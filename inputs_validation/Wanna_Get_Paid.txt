Get down baby down down down down down now

Chorus  
You want to get paid You want to get laid  
Pimp Yearlings in 360 ways  
Live your life in an ill real way  
Got 6 rides in your little driveway  
You get mad pufflie all day  
Make plans with your crime family  
Get money money take money money  
Get money money take money money  
  
By age 19 Tyheim is turned out  
He aint talking much keep a dutch in his mouth  
Cop the aberrettes  
Orange and Blue  
Laced the Goretex stepped with his crew  
Black superstar Jesus piece  
Who he prayin to God or the Beast  
Some bust blocks feared on the block  
Traded in the trucks for a silver drop top  
Drug money flowin  
Jealousy is growin  
Paranoia got him second guessin  
DTs on his back got him stressin  
He was at the light blazin up traum  
Around the corner came a tinted out Yukon  
Ten slugs in the door made him fall  
Guess he should of never hustled at all  
  
Chorus  
  
My man TayKwan like the chicks a lot  
Even when he hustled he kept them in his spot  
He liked to fuck a lot and make the rubber pop  
5 baby mothers  
1 live on my block  
Shinin in the club  
Chickens showin love  
Cash bubblin from pimpin and drugs  
He a real pretty cat  
He get from his moms  
Back in the seventies she was the bomb  
His games top notch and he dont stop  
He hit a reverends daughter in a church parkin lot  
TayKwan is sick heartless with chicks  
He liked to beat em up make em suck dick  
Met a little shorty brought her back to Queens  
Honey got the virus you know the routine  
Not only did he walk away with the HIV  
Her mans jealous jooked him rediculously  
  
Chorus  
  
Yolandas always got a scream  
Credit cards in ATM machines  
Used to make coats holdin work got arrest  
Honey made sons pockets bleed to death  
She a vet yet she look innocent and sweet  
When she wet aint no controllin the heat  
For baguettes she give love to ill thugs  
Age of 15 she learned to pump drugs  
Then she got pregnant abandoned the kid  
Met this drug kid set him up and slid  
Now she 23 full blown in the mix  
Sizin up wits than more cliques is gettin chips  
She down for whatever as long as it pays  
She tipped off the kids and got Tyheim blazed  
She was in the same Yukon laughin with the thug  
He said thanks for settin Tyheim up  
Take a slug  
  
Chorus  
  
Get paid mommy come on come on  
Get paid mommy come on come on  
Get paid mommy come on come on  
Get paid mommy come on come on  
Get paid mommy come on come on  
  
Niggas they wellin they just dont know  
It be LL and 83rd rocking the show  
Now niggas they front they just dont know  
But niggas want to stick they ball in that hole
