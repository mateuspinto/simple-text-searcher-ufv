Creating a life only to destroy  
Saved from a life of the unemployed  
Where crime is the only way to survive

Execution for those who deserve it  
The giving and taking of life will always be  
Altering the future  
  
Look into the future to prepare us for our fate  
Controlling our existence with every life we take  
  
Life for a life should remain the rule  
The innocent victim that is whats cruel  
Look to the past is what we should do  
When justice was done and justice was true  
Using our laws to help their escape  
An easy way out is what they create  
Claiming insane is the way to freedom  
People are stupid enough to believe them  
  
Death and life taken so easily  
Right or wrong whose choice will it be  
  
Abortion when it is needed  
Execution for those who deserve it  
The giving and taking of life will always be
