d you ask me why my d7 hearts so g sad  
And d why the teardrops fill my a7 eyes  
A d heart cant sing thats d7 filled with g pain  
How d can it a7 laugh when it d cries d7  
  
First chorus  
  
I g saw my dreams all fade and d die  
Like castles in the a7 blue  
Each d dawn will bring more d7 tears and g pain  
Ive d lost the a7 only lovei d knew  
  
Oh life for me is use less now  
It seems so empty and blue  
Theres no more use to try a  gain  
I fail in everything I do  
  
Second chorus  
  
Its hard to know youll never have  
The one you love so true  
While the worlds asleep Ill lay and cry  
Ive lost the only love I knew
