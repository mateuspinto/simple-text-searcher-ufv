One day in the life of the lonely  
Another day on the round about  
What do they need  
Somebody to love  
  
One night in the life of the lonely  
Theres a miracle on the screen  
What did they see  
Somebody to love  
  
He guarantees you instant glory  
Get your money on the line  
  
Gotta send me a plastic Jesus  
Theres a check in the mail today  
Thats what I need  
Somebody to love  
  
We just wont eat on Sunday  
Gotta buy him a limousine  
Somewhere to live  
Somewhere to pray  
  
Every penny from the people  
Keeps the wolf outside the door  
Shop around and find forgiveness for yourself  
But hell give you more yeah  
  
Holy father holy ghost  
Whos the one who pays the most  
Rock the cradle dont you cry  
Buy another lullaby  
  
Jack is nimble Jack is quick  
Pick your pocket turn a trick  
Slow and steady hes got time  
To commit another TV crime  
TV crime  
  
One day in the life of the lonely  
Back again on the round about  
What do they need  
Somebody to love  
  
Yeah  
  
One night in the life of the lonely  
Another miracle on the screen  
What did they see  
Somebody to love again  
  
A supermarket of salvation  
Take a look inside the store  
Shop around and find forgiveness for yourself  
But he gives more  
  
Holy father  holy ghost  
Whos the one who hurts you most  
Rock the cradle when you cry  
Scream another lullaby  
  
Jack be nimble Jack be slick  
Take the money get out quick  
Slow and steady so much time  
To commit another  
TV Crime TV Crime
