Its four am and youre just getting in  
Your first night out I wont ask where youve been  
Youre so ashamed and your eyes cant meet mine  
Ive seen that look on me a thousand times  
  
Chorus  
What makes us do the things we do heaven only knows  
We think weve got a secret but it always shows  
I taught you how to cheat youre doing fine  
Ive seen that look on me a thousand times  
  
But I still love you and so I pretend  
And hope I never see that look again  
But if I do I know the fault is mine  
Ive seen that look on me a thousand times  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Ive seen that look on me a thousand times
