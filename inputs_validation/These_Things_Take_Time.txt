Mine eyes have seen the glory of the sacred wunderkind  
You took me behind a disused railway line  
And said I know a place where we can go  
Where we are not known  
And then you gave me something that I wont forget too soon  
But I cant believe that youd ever care  
And this is why you will never care  
But these things take time  
I know that Im  
The most inept  
That ever stepped  
  
Im spellbound ohbut a woman divides  
And the hills are alive with celibate cries  
But you know where you came from you know where  
Youre going and you know where you belong  
You said I was ill and you were not wrong  
But I cant believe that youd ever care  
And so you will never care  
But these things take time  
And I know that Im  
The most inept  
That ever stepped  
  
Oh the alcoholic afternoons  
When we sat in your rooms  
They meant more to me  
Than any than any living thing on earth  
They had more worth  
Than any living thing on earth  
On earth on earth oh   
  
Vivid and in your prime  
You will leave me behind  
You will leave me behind
