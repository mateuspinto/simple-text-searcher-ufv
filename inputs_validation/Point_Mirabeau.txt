Below the Pont Mirabeau  
Slow flows the Seine  
And all our loves together  
Must I recall again  
Joy would always follow  
After pain  
Hands holding hands  
Let us stand face to face  
While underneath the bridge  
Of our arms entwined slow race  
Eternal gazes flowing  
At waves pace  
Let night fall let the hours go by  
The days pass on and here stand I  
Love runs away  
Like running water flows  
Love flows away  
But oh how slow life goes  
How violent is hope  
Love only knows  
Let night fall let the hours go by  
The days pass on and here stand I  
The days flow ever on  
The weeks pass by in vain  
Time never will return  
Nor our loves burn again  
Below the Pont Mirabeau  
Slow flows the Seine  
Let night fall let the hours go by  
The days pass on and here stand I
