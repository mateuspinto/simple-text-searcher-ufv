When you reach for a star  
Only angels are there  
And its not very far  
Just to step on a stair  
Take a look at those clowns  
And the tricks that they play  
In the circus of life  
Life is bitter and gay  
  
There are clowns in the night  
Clowns everywhere  
See how they run  
Run from despair  
You can be thrilled  
And you can be free  
  
How  
  
But only my friend  
If youll listen to me  
  
When the fantasy bells  
Of the universe ring  
You can fly through the sky  
On a dragonflys wing  
There is magic within  
There is magic without  
Follow me and youll learn  
Just what lifes all about  
Just what lifes all about
