Hello old lady  
I know your face well  
I know it well  
  
She says  
Oh  
Ill be sitting in your mirror  
Now is the place where the crossroads meet  
Will you look into the future  
  
Never never say goodbye  
To my part of your life  
No no no no no  
Oh oh oh  
  
Let me live  
She said  
Cmon and let me live girl  
She said  
Cmon and let me live girl  
Cmon and let me live  
  
This moment in time  
She said  
It doesnt belong to you  
She said  
It belongs to me  
  
And to your little boy and to your little girl  
And the one hand clapping  
Where on your palm is my little line  
When youre written in mine  
As an old memory  
Oh  
  
Never never say goodbye  
To my part of your life  
Oh no no no no no  
Never never never  
Never never let me go  
  
She said  
Cmon and let me live girl  
Cmon and let me live  
She said  
Cmon and let me live girl  
Cmon and let me live  
  
I put this  
Moment here  
I put this moment here  
I put this moment  
  
Over here  
Over here  
  
Cant you see where memories are kept bright  
Tripping on the water like a laughing girl  
Time in her eyes is spawning past life  
One with the ocean and the woman unfurled  
Holding all the love that waits for you here  
Catch us now for I am your future  
  
A kiss on the wind and well make the land  
Come over here to where When lingers  
Waiting in this empty world  
Waiting for Then when the lifespray cools  
For Now does ride in on the curl of the wave  
And you will dance with me in the sunlit pools  
  
We are of the going water and the gone  
We are of water in the holy land of water  
And all thats to come runs in  
With the thrust on the strand
