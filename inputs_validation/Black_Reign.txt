Verse 1  
Somebodys watching watching you all the time  
Somebodys waiting waiting for you to lose your mind  
Wishes are like broken glass show the cracks of you past  
Thought you left it all behind  
Sailing on ship of fools  
You got nothing left to prove  
Hidden from the naked eye  
  
Chorus  
Black reign white light  
Your pain will ignite  
Black reign takes flight  
You know it heals as it bites  
Black reign Its like looking directly at the sun  
  
Verse 2  
Move my soul and take me to a higher place  
Let it go and see the storm face to face  
All the answers are within the secrets that you see as sin  
Its a deal that you make with yourself  
Intervene your vanity  
Forget about your sanity  
We all have a tale to tell  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge  
Blot out the rays of the sun  
Deep in your mind it will come  
Take all the things that youve learned
