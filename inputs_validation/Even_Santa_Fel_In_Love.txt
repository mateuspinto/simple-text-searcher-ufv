He brushes back his silver hair  
And checks to see if she is standing there  
After years of traveling round  
With the raindeer hooves above the ground  
Never made the mrs runaway  
Remembering the night they met  
Figure skating she played hard to get  
In his red suit he sled past  
Who can resist that charming laugh  
He said he could teach her how to fly  
  
Chorus  
Even santa fell in love  
Everybody needs someone to come home to  
After the longest day  
Even santa fell in love  
And shes the only one he wants to come back to  
When the toys are put away  
  
Bridge even on christmas day  
  
She sees his eyes are all a glow  
Anticipating children laughing in the snow  
And with just his christmas touch  
Under mistletoe before the rush  
Mrs kringle feels the tingle in the heart  
Chorus  
Bridge  
Chorus  
Hooo  
Bridge 2x
