The snow is snowing and the wind it is blowing  
But I can weather the storm  
What do I care how much it may storm  
Ive got my love to keep me warm  
I cannot remember the worst December  
  
Just watch the icicles form  
What do I care if icicles form  
Ive got my love to keep me warm  
Off with my overcoat off with my gloves  
Who needs an overcoat Im burning with love  
My hearts on fire and the flame grows higher  
  
So I will weather the storm  
What do I care how much it may storm  
Ive got my love to keep me warm  
I thought you ought to know my hearts on fire  
The flame it just leaps higher  
So I will weather the storm  
Why do I care how much it storms  
Ive got my love  
To keep me warm  
Ive got my love to keep me warm
