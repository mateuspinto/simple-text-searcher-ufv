Oh tell me love and tell me truly  
Do you believe this is forever  
Well I tell you love that I believe you  
Oh when you tell me that you will leave me never  
  
Oh tell me love that all my words are a waste  
Oh tell me love are my lips to your taste  
Cause I want to please you I want to please you  
And tell me love do you know you amaze me  
You keep changing for the better with every passing day  
Well Ill tell you love sometimes it kinda scares me  
Ive got to keep on getting to you so you dont get away  
  
Oh tell me love that all my words are a waste  
And tell me love are my lips to your taste  
Cause I want to please you I want to please you  
And tell me love please tell me love tell me love
