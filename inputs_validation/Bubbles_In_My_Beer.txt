Tonight in a bar alone  
Im sitting apart from  
The laughter and the cheer  
Scenes from the past  
Rise before me while  
Watching the bubbles in my beer  
Visions of someone  
Who loved me brings  
Along salty tears to my eyes  
And I know that my lifes  
Been a failure  
Watching the bubbles in my beer  
  
Im seeing the road  
That Ive traveled  
A road paved  
With heartaches and tears  
And Im seeing the past  
That Ive wasted  
Watching the bubbles in my beer  
Visions of someone who loved me
