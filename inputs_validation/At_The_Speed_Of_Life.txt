jack hues  
A man lives in the city  
Surrounded by machines  
They take away his pity  
And give him what he dreams  
A stream of information  
On a green letter screen  
Makes him feel in touch with the world  
And sure of what it means  
Chorus  
At the speed of light youre in endless night  
At the speed of sound you dont see the ground  
And in your sports car with the windows down  
And the radio on and you dont stop talking  
Thanks Ill keep walking  
Im doing things in my own way  
Well Im doing things as I please  
And then everything else goes its own way  
At the speed of life  
A man lives in the city  
Distracted by the news  
From sitting down with the ones he loves  
Or taking time to choose  
And what of conversation  
And what is left when he dies  
Is there a diary of an honest man  
To stand against the lies  
Repeat chorus  
Im doing things for their own sake  
A picture on a screen wont do  
I need to feel and touch it too  
Do what I feel  
Im doing things for their own sake  
I gotta find that essential deep emotion  
Get unhooked from this low commotion  
And do what I feel  
Im doing things in my own way  
Im doing things in my own way  
Well Im doing things as I please  
And then everything else goes its own way  
At the speed of life  
This is the speed of life
