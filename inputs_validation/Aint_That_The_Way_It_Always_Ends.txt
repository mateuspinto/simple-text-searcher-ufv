Johnny came home broken hearted  
Said he lost his girl  
He burrowed up all the hurt in his heart  
But still a hole in the wall of his world  
Now Betty she was a blond haired beauty  
With an eye for a man who could spend  
She stole his heart in a pick up truck  
Then drove off in a Mercedes van  
And he said  
  
Chorus  
Oh she looked so innocent  
Talkin bout bein just friends  
Oh and it dont make a bit of since  
Aint that the way tit always ends  
  
Sharon she had a long time dream  
And only one man in her life  
He kept her waitin  
But she didnt care  
Cause he promised her hed make her his wife  
Now Billy he had a good thing goin  
But he let it go to his head  
Well he got jealous late one night  
She caught them both in her bed  
And she said  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh it always looks so innocent  
Talkin bout bein just friends  
Oh and it dont make a bit og since  
Aint that the way it always ends  
  
Aint that the way it always ends  
  
Aint that the way it always ends
