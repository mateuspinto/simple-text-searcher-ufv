There are places I remember all my life  
Though some have changed  
Some forever not for better  
Some have gone and some remain  
  
All these places had their moments  
With lovers and friends  
I still can recall  
Some are dead and some are living  
In my life Ive loved them all  
  
But of all these friends and lovers  
There is no one compares with you  
And these memories lose their meaning  
When I think of love as something new  
  
Though I know  
Ill never lose affection  
For people and things that went before  
I know Ill often stop and think about them  
In my life I love you more  
  
Though I know  
Ill never lose affection  
For people and things that went before  
I know Ill often stop and think about them  
In my life I love you more  
In my life I love you more
