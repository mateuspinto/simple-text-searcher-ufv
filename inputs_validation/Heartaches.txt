Heartaches heartaches  
My loving you meant only heartaches  
Your kiss was such a sacred thing to me  
I cant believe its just a burning memory  
  
Heartaches heartaches  
What does it matter how my heart breaks  
I should be happy with someone new  
But my heart aches for you  
  
Heartaches heartaches  
My loving you meant only heartaches  
Your kiss was such a sacred thing to me  
I cant believe its just a burning memory  
  
Heartaches heartaches  
What does it matter how my heart breaks  
I should be happy with someone new  
But my heart aches for you  
  
Heartaches heartaches  
What does it matter how my heart breaks  
I should be happy with someone new  
But my heart aches  
And my heart breaks  
And my heart aches for you
