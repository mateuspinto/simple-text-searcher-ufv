Once in a lifetime you find  
Someone to show you the way  
Someone to make your decisions  
But I let you lead me astray  
Who did you think you were fooling  
Said you were missing me blind  
But the truth is I knew you were lying  
You were using me time after time  
  
When the heartache is over  
I know I wont be missing you missing you  
Wont look over my shoulder  
Cause I know that I can live without you  
Oh live without you  
Oh I can live without you  
  
Time to move on with my life now  
Leaving the past all behind  
I can make my own decisions  
It was only a matter of time  
Sometimes I look back in anger  
Thinking about all the pain  
But I know that Im stronger without you  
And that Ill never need you again  
  
When the heartache is over  
I know I wont be missing you missing you  
Wont look over my shoulder  
Cause I know that I can live without you  
Oh live without you  
Oh I can live without you  
  
When the heartache is over  
I know I wont be missing you  
Wont look over my shoulder  
Cause I know that I can live without you  
When the heartache is over  
I know I wont be missing you missing you  
Wont look over my shoulder  
Cause I know that I can live without you  
Yeah I can live without you  
Live without you
