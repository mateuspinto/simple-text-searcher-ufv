Its hard to be a snail  
Who wants to hit the trail  
But when your house is on your tail  
Its hard to see  
  
He hides from people too  
As snails will always do  
And only childrens nursery tunes  
Can set him free  
  
He sees a falling leaf  
A flower opened wide  
He wishes he were different  
But all he does is hide  
The silence all around  
Reminds him of the sea  
Ill go so far with you  
But will you wait for me  
  
Its hard to be a snail  
Who wants to hit the trail  
But when your house is on your tail  
Its such a bummer  
  
Open spaces are a thrill  
And his feelers make him ill  
Is this temporary will  
It fade with summer  
  
He sees a falling leaf  
A flower opened wide  
He wishes he were different  
But all he does is hide  
The silence all around  
Reminds him of the sea  
Ill go so far with you  
But will you wait for me  
  
Its hard to be a snail  
Who wants to hit the trail  
But when your house is on your tail  
Its hard to see  
  
He hides from people too  
As snails will always do  
And only childrens nursery tunes  
Can set him free
