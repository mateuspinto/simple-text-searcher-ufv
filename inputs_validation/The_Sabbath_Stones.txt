Fire and water wind and rain  
Wings that carry hell in every vein  
World Possessions endless tears  
Truth and knowledge stolen all their years  
  
World turns slowly sun dont shine  
Silence stills the air and kills the chime  
Words are poison passion bleeds  
2000 years on earth has sown the seeds  
  
The time of dreams has turned  
The night is gone and the light shines on  
Where darkness once would hide  
With spirits high our fears were born  
  
Chorus  
Receiver of light the kingdom of God will guide you  
Keep you from a restless heart  
Deceiver of night the stranger that laughs  
Within you the reason for your restless heart  
Is the keeper of the Sabbath Stones  
  
Fire and water wind and rain  
Wings that carry hell in every vein  
World turns slowly sun dont shine  
Silence stills the air and kills the chime  
  
Can faith destroy desire Each breath a prayer each step brings fear  
The eyes of they that see have evil stare  
Watch over me  
  
Chorus  
  
And Hes the keeper if the Sabbath Stones  
  
What God is this that stands to hear his people cry  
What hand would strike and watch his people die What life that takes what
future did we earn Its our mistakes take heed the Sabbath Stones  
  
What life that takes what future did we earn Its our mistakes
