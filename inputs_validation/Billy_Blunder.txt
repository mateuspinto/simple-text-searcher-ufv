One rainy morning  
Without any warning  
A large umbrella crossed the street  
Big black and shiny  
Covering someone tiny  
And all that we could see were two small feet  
  
In and out the traffic  
Dodging here and there  
That umbrella went with a DontCare air  
I said in wonder  
Who is that down under  
Hugging that umbrella like a teddy bear  
  
Horns started blaring  
Everyone was staring  
At that strange object in the street  
Big black and shiny  
Covering someone tiny  
And all that we could see were two small feet  
  
Then a young policeman  
Called out from his beat  
That umbrella there has a boy down deep  
He swooped down under  
Pulled out Billy Blunder  
Just a tiny truant from his mornings sleep  
  
Now Billy Blunder  
Who was once down under  
Recites by heart his safety code  
When you are out  
In rain or hail or thunder  
Hold up your umbrella when you cross the road
