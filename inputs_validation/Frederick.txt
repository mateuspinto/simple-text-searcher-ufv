Hi hello wake from thy sleep  
God has given your soul to keep  
All of the power that burns in the flame  
Ignites the light in a single name  
  
Frederick name of care  
Fast asleep in a room somewhere  
Guardian angels line a bed  
Shed their light on my sleepy head  
  
I am a threshold yearning to sing  
Down with the the dancers having one last fling  
Heres to the moment when you said hello  
Come on my spirit are you ready lets go  
  
Hi hi hey hey  
Maybe I will come back some day now  
But tonight on the wings of a dove  
Up above to the land of love  
  
Now I lay me down to sleep  
Pray the Lord my soul to keep  
Kiss to kiss breath to breath  
My soul surrenders astonished to death  
  
Night of wonder for us to keep  
Set our sails channel out deep  
After the rapture two hearts meet  
Mine entwined in a single beat  
  
Frederick youre the one  
As we journey from sun to sun  
All the dreams I waited so long for  
Fly tonight so long so long  
  
Bye bye hey hey  
Maybe we will come back some day now  
But tonight on the wings of a dove  
Up above to the land of love  
  
Frederick name of care  
High above in sky thats clear  
All the things Ive been dreamin of  
Are expressed in this name of love  
  
Bye bye hey hey  
Maybe we will come back some day now  
But tonight on the wings of a dove  
Up above
