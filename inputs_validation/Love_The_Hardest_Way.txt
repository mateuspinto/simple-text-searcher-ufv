Love is the devil counting teardrops in the rain  
To the sound of a chalkboard symphony played with nails  
For what its worth I dont wanna see you hurt anymore  
Than you have to  
  
Chorus  
Dine on glass wine on blood  
Baby love the hard way  
Baudelaire in Braille  
Baby love the harder way  
Once you lose yourself entomb  
I promise you love the hardest way  
  
Pretty like a flower on a tomb you are kissed  
blue by the last arrows of your sun  
Olly olly oxen free  
Hide and go weep  
Oh no more  
Unless you want  
  
Chorus  
  
Love the hardest way  
Love the hardest way  
Love the hardest way
