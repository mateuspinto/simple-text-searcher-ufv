Hey na na na hey hey thought about you  
Hey na na na Ill make it with or without you  
  
I went walking in your shoes today  
It took me back to that familiar way  
That I felt when our team was on the winning side  
So I paged through some pictures that you left behind  
  
Hey na na na hey hey thought about you  
Hey na na na Ill make it with or without you  
  
I guess I would have known love if it whispered in my ear  
All I know right now is that its been almost a year  
That I traded in forever for a kiss that day  
But how about some shelter if I promise not to stay  
  
Hey na na na hey hey thought about you  
Hey na na na Ill make it with or without you  
  
Shelter me  
Come on baby please  
I dont need for you to feel the same  
Cover me come on cant you see  
I just need to come in from the rain  
Shelter me  
  
I know that you need to find someone who will get you  
Thought I was the one  
I know that I need to find someone who let me  
Thought you were the one  
  
Hey na na na hey hey thought about you  
Hey na na na Ill make it with or without you  
  
Shelter me  
Come on baby please  
I dont need for you to feel the same  
Cover me come on cant you see  
I just need to come in from the rain  
  
Hey na na na hey hey thought about you  
Hey na na na Ill make it with or without you
