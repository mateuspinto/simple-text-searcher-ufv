Drip drip drip  
Baby whend you get so Zen  
Drip drip  
When I used to know you when  
Drip drip  
When you thought all my dreams sucked  
Drip drip  
I was just happy you gave a fuck  
Drip drip  
  
And we dont want to do it  
Drip drip drip  
We want to be it  
Drip drip drip  
  
Tick tick tick  
The Smartest Guy In The Room  
Flick flick  
Might as well be on the moon  
Click click  
Or in his tower or his tomb  
Cricket  
Cause all Im hearing is you  
Drip drip  
  
And we dont want to do it  
Drip drip drip  
We want to be it  
Drip drip drip  
  
Drip drip drip  
Baby whend you get so wrecked  
Drip drip  
And where are things at this moment  
Drip drip  
And all our friends gave us a week  
Drip drip  
And were still happening as we speak  
Drip drip  
  
And we dont want to do it  
Drip drip drip  
We want to be it  
Drip drip drip  
Oh drip drip drip  
  
And we dont want to do it  
Drip drip drip  
We want to be it  
Drip drip drip  
  
Drip drip drip  
Flick flick flick  
Cricket cricket  
Cricket cricket cricket
