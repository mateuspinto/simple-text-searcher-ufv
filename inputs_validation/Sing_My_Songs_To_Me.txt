Sing my songs to me  
Sing them to me softly  
Sing me sunlight and shadows  
Orange groves and meadows  
Let your voice ring back my memories  
Sing my songs to me  
  
Bring my dreams to me  
Bring them from the darkness  
Let the minutes and hours  
Show my mind strange new flowers  
But Id like to know where they go  
when the morning comes  
Bring my dreams to me  
  
Because it seems to me  
That there may never be  
A better chance to see who I am  
Come timelessly dancing  
Through my dreams to me
