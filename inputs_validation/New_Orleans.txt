I said hey hey hey hey ya  
I said hey hey ya ya  
  
Well come on everybody  
Make a trip with me  
Down from Mississippi  
Down to New Orleans  
They got the honeysuckle  
Blooming on a honeysuckle vine  
Love is bloomin there all the time  
Down from Mississippi  
Down to New Orleans  
  
You know that any Southern belle  
Is a Mississippi Queen  
  
Hey hey hey hey ya  
Hey hey ya ya  
  
Well come on everybody  
Take a stroll with me  
We gonna listen to the music  
With a Dixieland beat  
They got the magnolia blossoms fill the air  
If you aint been to heaven  
You aint been here  
Now all the French moss hangin  
From a big oak tree  
Down from Mississippi  
Down to New Orleans  
  
Hey hey hey hey ya  
Hey hey ya ya  
  
Well lets go everybody  
Take a trip with me  
Down from Mississippi  
Down to New Orleans  
They got the honeysuckle  
Blooming on a honeysuckle vine  
They got love bloomin there all the time  
You know that any Southern belle  
Is a Mississippi Queen  
Down from Mississippi  
Down to New Orleans  
  
Well come on  
You got it  
We gonna dance going to New Orleans  
Thats the place  
I said come on  
Come on come on come on
