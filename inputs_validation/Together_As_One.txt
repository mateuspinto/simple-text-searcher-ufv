Labeled a creation of evil  
Ridiculed for their shocking appearance  
Sharing both please and pain  
Two minds two hearts one soul  
Separating mentally  
An illusion of privacy  
Together they absorb each others lives  
As One they will live and they will die  
A living hell has begun  
  
Displayed as a nightmare  
Criticized through words and eyes  
As they stare  
To the normal it seems grotesque  
Connected by a bond of flesh  
Two minds two hearts one soul  
Separating mentally  
An illusion of privacy  
Together they absorb each others lives  
As One they will live and they will die  
A living hell has begun
