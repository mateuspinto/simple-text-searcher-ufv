Mmm mmm  mmm this dark lonely street  
Here am I I walk alone I have no love of my own  
Now each shadow I pass is my looking glass  
On this dark lonely street  
  
Im in love with the dream of a girl Ive never seen  
Out of reach out of sight will I find her tonight  
On this dark lonely street  
Is my love just pretend will this dream never end  
  
Maybe this cigarette will help me to forget  
This dark lonely street  
Mmm mmm mmm this dark lonely street
