I guess you noticed there is only eleven roses  
I chose them from our garden where they grew  
Take the roses and look into the mirror  
And the twelfth rose will be looking back at you  
  
Theres just something about a spray of roses  
To a woman they say more than man can say  
After what Ive done you may not keep the roses  
But I just thought I would send them anyway
