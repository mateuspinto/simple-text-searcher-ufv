I talked with a stranger so sad and forlorn  
His garments were sackcloth all tattered and torn  
He told me a story of sorrow and woe  
His heart went to heaven at the first fall of snow  
He spoke of his angel a dear baby girl  
He loved evry footstep he loved evry curl  
But she went to heaven just one year ago  
The angels came for her at the first fall of snow  
He still had the dolly that she used to love  
He held and caressed it and gazed up above  
He whispered My baby youre waiting I know  
Ill bring you your dolly at the first fall of snow  
And there as I listened my eyes filled with tears  
I knew she was part of his happier years  
His frail body trembled he spoke soft and low  
Ill be with my baby at the first fall of snow  
I patted his shoulder my feelings to hide  
He couldnt know I was crying inside  
He smiled as we parted cause he didnt know  
That we lost our baby at the first fall of snow
