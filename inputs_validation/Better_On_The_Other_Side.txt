Diddy talking  
I remember the first time I seen you moonwalk  
I believed I could do anything  
You made the world dance  
You made the music come to life  
  
Chris brown  Chorus  
This the type of song that make the angels cry  
I look up in the sky and I wonder why  
Why you had to go go  
I know its better on the other side  
You were chosen from the sky  
Never gon let you go  
  
The Game  
Whos Michael Jackson  
Your Michael Jackson  
Im Michael Jackson  
We all Michael Jackson  
I guess what Im asking is everybody bow their head for a legend dont breathe
for a second  
Now let the air out grab the hand of somebody you care about  
So you can hear my message my confession  
Someone tell Usher I seen the moonwalk I guess the young thriller touched
him like he touched me like he touched you  
So carry on his legacy something I must do so I trust you lighting candles
concrete visuals me and my brothers listen to jackson 5 in the living room  
First thing I did when I heard was call puff  
Cos him and Mike tried to stop the beef between us  
Who was us Me and fifty that beef is dead him and Mike Jackson gonna take
us to the ledge  
  
Chorus  
This the type of song that make the angels cry  
I look up in the sky and I wonder why  
Why you had to go go  
I know its better on the other side  
You were chosen from the sky  
Never gon let you go  
  
As Im pouring out this liquor candles start to flicker  
When list my air ones mj was my nier  
Not the one that play ball the one with the hollywood star  
And since Im a hollywood star Im gonna tell you my story  
Never had a family that close never see Barry Gordy walking through
interscope  
Just like me they always had Mike in a scope  
No matter what you say  
Im gonna love him and hes still dope  
Let me take you back to 85 when I was in a zone dancing for my momma thriller
jacket with all the zippers on  
Now Im doing 90 bout to crash in this Aston  
Listening to Outcast Im sorry Mrs Jackson  
Anything I can ever do to better you your son was our king so we wont Corretta
you  
Im writing this letter to all the Jackson kids we all Jackson kids time to
let us through  
  
Chorus  
This the type of song that make the angels cry  
I look up in the sky and I wonder why  
Why you had to go go  
I know its better on the other side  
You were chosen from the sky  
Never gon let you go
