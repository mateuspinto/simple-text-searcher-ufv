When you look into a mirror tell me what do you see  
Is it Pictures of Lily crying you know what I mean  
Ive been livin high Ive been livin low  
Like a bird in the sky this is the way to go  
  
What you gonna do with those faded blues you wear  
What you gonna do with those ol rag blues  
What you gonna do with those ol blue jeans you wear  
Ol rag blues ol rag blues ol rag blues  
  
Did you think it was forever Well now you know  
The summer sun keeps shining shine through the blue  
Ive been livin high Ive been livin low  
Never give up tryin oh no no no  
  
What you gonna do with those faded blues you wear  
What you gonna do with those ol rag blues  
What you gonna do with those ol blue jeans you wear  
Ol rag blues ol rag blues ol rag blues  
  
I can hear you callin somewhere in the blue  
Can you hear me callin for you For you  
  
What you gonna do with those ol blue jeans you wear  
Ol rag blues ol rag blues ol rag blues
