Im drunk again excuse the hiccup  
The redneck originator rollin in my pick up  
Truck jacked up with the four gold shocks  
And where I come from mud flaps come stock  
  
People Kid Rock it up and down the block  
And the hens all flock to the coup with the cock  
You want to rock with me baby row it down to the swamp  
Dock your boat well do the hillbilly stomp  
  
Do it hiho  
Well do the hillbilly stomp hiho haha  
  
I like stuckies truckers and big mesh hats  
I like large round women in laundromats  
I like to wander jack like a backwards thug  
And watch the moonshine through the bottom of a jug  
  
Hugging and kissing with my vision all blurry  
Sifting through this world of worry  
Hurry up with love please God bless  
I dont do drugs anymore or any less  
  
I didnt start this mess on this planet  
Stop looking at me like a bandit  
Ive been chilling down at the swamp  
With the folks that want to do the hillbilly stomp  
  
Do it hiho  
Well do the hillbilly stomp hiho  
  
Now people want to know how to do this dance  
Life your legs in the air like you wet your pants  
Plant your hands on the top of your butt  
And stomp around the woods like youre all fucked up  
  
Circle up the trucks fire up the brush  
Untuck your shirt were gonna kick some dust  
Dont two plus two it or three plus three it  
Four by four and to a place thats scenic  
  
Heat it up like some hot ham hocks cooking  
And hop to the spot where the cops aint looking  
Bring your whole flock go on down to the swamp  
And we can rock all night doing the hillbilly stomp  
  
Do it hiho  
Well do the hillbilly stomp hiho
