Goodnight my angel  
Time to close your eyes  
And save these questions for another day  
I think I know what youve been asking me  
I think you know what Ive been trying to say  
I promised I would never leave you  
And you should always know  
Wherever you may go  
No matter where you are  
I never will be far away  
  
Goodnight my angel  
Now its time to sleep  
And still so many things I want to say  
Remember all the songs you sang for me  
When we went sailing on an emerald bay  
And like a boat out on the ocean  
Im rocking you to sleep  
The waters dark  
And deep inside this ancient heart  
Youll always be a part of me  
  
Goodnight my angel  
Now its time to dream  
And dream how wonderful your life will be  
Someday your child may cry  
And if you sing this lullabye  
Then in your heart  
There will always be a part of me  
  
Someday well all be gone  
But lullabyes go on and on  
They never die  
Thats how you  
And I  
Will be
