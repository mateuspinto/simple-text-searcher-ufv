Crying in the dark  
Ive been trying trying so hard  
Ive been crying crying in the dark  
Dont forsake me the time of mine is near  
Dont ever break me and the world that brought me here  
  
Sick and lonely waiting for you  
Sick and lonely wondering what to do  
Can you hear me when I say to you  
You give me your hand Ill give mine to you  
  
King of twilight  
When the king of twilight shows me  
I will take ten steps to see  
Forty leaves I pay for freedom  
  
For a chance to be free  
For a chance to be free  
  
When the king of twilight calls you  
Take a step and you will see  
We all need a quick solution  
  
For a chance to be free  
For a chance to be free  
Free  
  
When the king of twilight shows me  
I will take ten steps to see  
Forty leaves I pay for freedom  
  
For a chance to be free  
For a chance to be  
Free
