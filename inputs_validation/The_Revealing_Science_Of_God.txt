Dawn of light lying between a silence and sold sources  
Chased amid fusions of wonder  
In moments hardly seen forgotten  
Coloured in pastures of chance  
Dancing leaves cast spells of  
Challenge  
Amused but real in thought  
We fled from the sea whole  
Dawn of thought transferred through moments of days underseaarching  
Earth  
Revelaing corridors of time provoking memories  
Disjointed but with purpose  
Craving penetrations offer links with the selfinstructors sharp  
And tender love  
As we took to the air a picture of distance  
Dawn of our power we amuse redescending as fast as misused  
Expression  
As only to teach love as to reveal passion chasing  
Late into corners  
And we danced from the ocean  
Dawn of love sent within us colours of awakening among the many  
Wont to follow  
Only tunes of a different age  
As the links span our endless caresses for the freedom of life  
Everlasting  
  
Talk to the sunlight caller  
Soft summer mover distance mine  
  
Called out a tune but I never saw the face  
Heard but not replaced  
I ventured to talk but I never lost my place  
Cast out a spell rendered for the light of day  
Lost in lights array  
I ventured to see as the sound began to play  
  
What happened to this song we once knew so well  
Signed promise for moments caught within the spell  
I must have waited all my life for this  
Moment moment  
  
The future poised with the splendour just begun  
The light we were as one  
And crowded through the curtains of liquid into sun  
  
And for a moment when our world had filled the skies  
Magic turned our eyes  
To feast on the treasure set for our strange device  
  
What happened to wonders we once knew so well  
Did we forget what happened surely we can tell  
We must have waited all our lives for this  
Moment moment moment  
  
Starlight movement reasons  
Release forward  
Tallest rainbow  
Sun shower seasons  
Life flower reasons  
  
They move fast they tell me  
But I just cant believe that I can feel it  
Theres someone to tell you  
Amid the challenge we look around in unison with you  
  
Getting over overhanging trees  
Let them rape the forest  
Thoughts would send our fusion  
Clearly to be home  
  
Getting over wars we do not mean  
Or so it seems so clearly  
Sheltered with our passion  
Clearly to be home  
  
They move fast they tell me  
But I just cant believe they really mean to  
  
Theres someone to tell you  
And I just cant believe our song will leave you  
  
Skyline teacher  
Warland seeker  
Send out poison  
Cast iron leader  
  
And through the rhythm of moving slowly  
Sent through the rhythm work out the story  
Move over glory to sons of old fighters past  
  
Young christians see if from the beginning  
Old people feel it thats what theyre saying  
Move over glory to sons of old fighters past  
  
They move fast they tell me  
But I just cant believe they really mean to  
  
Theres someone to tell you  
A course towards a universal season  
  
Getting over overhanging trees  
Let them rape the forest  
They might stand and leave them  
Clearly to be home  
  
Getting over wars we do not mean  
We charm the movement suffers  
Call out all our memories  
Clearly to be home  
  
Weve moved fast  
We need love  
A part we offer is our only freedom  
  
What happened to this song we once knew so well  
Signed promise for moments caught within the spell  
We must have waited all our lives for this  
Moment moment  
  
Past present movers moments well process the future but only  
Through him we know  
Send flowered rainbows  
Apiece apart chased flowers of the dark and lights of songs to  
Follow and show all we feel for and know of  
Cast round  
You seekers of the truth accepting that reason will relive and  
Breath and hope and chase and love  
For you and you and you
