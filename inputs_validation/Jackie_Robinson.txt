Luther Jackson Green  
Lived in the apartment above me  
We smoked cigarettes on the stairs  
Tell me stories that white boys never hear  
  
Like when he found this shine  
He moved north in nineteen fortynine  
On his tenth birthday daddy took him to town  
To see the Jackie Robinson play  
  
It was a picture perfect day  
In the sunshine and the hate  
He didnt understand why all those  
People would say such awful things  
  
His daddy said pay no attention to them  
Turnaround and watch the man play  
  
The one black man in the baseball field  
Was better in every way  
My daddy said if you wanna win in this world  
You gotta beat em the their own game  
  
Luther Jackson Green  
Went to law school in nineteen sixtythree  
In the summer between he worked in Alabama  
With Martin Luther King  
  
He met a girl on a summer night  
He fell hard when they saw each others eyes  
There were people in town that really didnt  
Like that he was black and she was white  
  
They found her in the ditch  
A little outside of town  
Some stupid man was blastin about it  
So Luther beat him down  
  
He looked him in the eye spit in his face and  
He turned and walked away  
He knew he was better than all the hate  
He knew he was bigger than all the pain  
He knew theres a time to fight and a time to walk away  
He knew until he changed the rules  
Ooh yeah they beat em at their own game  
  
He never did lose that feeling inside  
You could hear it in his voice  
You could see it in his eyes  
  
Luther moved out West to live  
When his wife passed away  
He lives right next door to his son  
So he can watch his grandchild play  
  
Luther Jackson Green  
Watched election night with me  
We put a black man in the White House  
A thing he never thought hed see  
  
Even though he never cried  
I could see tears in his eyes  
He had dreamed about this moment  
Every single day of his life  
  
Yeah Luther died that night in his sleep  
But he lived long enough to see  
America become the kind of place  
He always wanted it to be  
  
He said you could never forget the day  
That we beat em at their own game  
  
Yeah just like Jackie Robinson just like Jackie Robinson  
Gotta be bigger than all the hate just like Jackie Robinson  
Gotta be better than all the pain just like Jackie Robinson  
Gotta find a better way just like Jackie Robinson  
  
Gotta beat em at their own game just like Jackie Robinson  
Gotta beat em at their own game just like Jackie Robinson  
Gotta beat em at their own game just like Jackie Robinson  
Just like Jackie Robinson
