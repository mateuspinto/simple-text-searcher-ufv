Are you lost  
In your lies  
Do you tell yourself I dont realize  
  
Your crusades a disguise  
Replace freedom with fear  
You trade money for lives  
  
Im aware of what youve done  
  
Chorus  
No no more sorrow  
Ive paid for your mistakes  
Your time is borrowed  
Your time has come to be replaced  
  
I see pain  
I see need  
I see liars and thieves  
Abused power with greed  
I had hope  
I believed  
But Im beginning to think that Ive been deceived  
  
You will pay for what youve done  
  
Chorus  
  
Thieves and hypocrites  
Thieves and hypocrites  
Thieves and hypocrites  
  
Chorus  
  
No more sorrow  
Ive paid for your mistakes  
Your time is borrowed  
Your time has come to be replaced  
Your time has come to be replaced  
Your time has come to be erased
