She seems to think she seems too week  
She takes a week to get over it  
  
She likes the sea she likes to see  
She likes to think she has all of it  
  
She likes the sound she likes the sand  
She likes to stand she cant afford to sit  
  
She likes to be  
She likes to be  
She likes to be  
Shes into guilt  
Guilt  
Guilt  
Guilt  
  
She likes to think she likes to drink  
She seems too weak she takes all the rent  
  
She likes the time she owns the time  
She borrows time to selfinvent  
  
She seems too weak she likes to see  
She likes to think she has all of it  
  
She likes the sand she likes to stand  
She likes to sit she likes to go  
Go  
Go  
Go  
  
She likes to be  
She likes to be  
She likes to be  
  
She likes to go  
She likes to go  
She likes to go  
She likes to go  
She likes to go  
She likes to go  
She likes to go
