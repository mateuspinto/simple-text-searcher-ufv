Spoken  
Well you ladies out there  
You know what Im  
Im talkin bout ya  
But you wanna know something  
Did you ever try to remember or  
Or just place up a memory in your mind  
And it always seems so far away  
So hard to find  
  
Memories  
Light the corners of my mind  
Misty watercolor memories  
Of the way we were  
  
Scattered pictures  
Of the smiles we left behind  
Smiles we gave to one another  
oh yesterday for the way we were  
  
Can it be that it was all so simple then  
Or has time rewritten every line  
If we had the change to do it all again  
  
Spoken  
Tell me how many of you would live your lives again  
I would too  
You girls  
  
Memories  
May be beautiful and yet  
Whats too painful to remember  
We simply choose to forget  
And so its the laughter  
We will remember  
Whenever we remember  
  
The way we were  
The way we were  
Whoaaahhhh
