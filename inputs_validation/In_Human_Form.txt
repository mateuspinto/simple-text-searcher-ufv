People of the earth beware  
It is here in human form  
An atrocity laced with greed  
Filled with evil intentions  
Ready to attack  
  
Look to the air for stories to choose  
Who will be your next victim  
Profitting on visions of others  
dark emotions run through its veins  
Its motives are false its mind is insane  
A distant planet with no signs of life  
To become a home for this alien breed  
Scientists of the world unite  
your services are more than needed  
This creature in human form is out of control  
  
Looks can be deceiving see beyond the shell  
Flesh and eyes mean nothing  
The truth time it will tell  
Before you think you fool the world  
What comes around goes around  
Shown for what you are a waste of life
