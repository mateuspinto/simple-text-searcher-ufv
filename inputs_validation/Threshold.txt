I dont want to see I dont want to hear  
I dont want to feel anything cant you understand  
Everything I do doesnt stem from you  
It doesnt have a fucking thing to do with you  
I just want to die throw it all away  
Never have to feel again the way you make me  
Lose my fuckin mind all the fuckin time  
Cant control the violence thats spewing from me  
Take it  
  
I cant control the rage that flows from me  
I cant shut it down it overwhelms me  
I cant stop the rage that flows from me  
  
Cant stop the  
Violence I love it  
No ones immune to hate that flows from it  
Infectious I feed on it  
Every fucking endless day  
Youre either on my side or else  
Youre in my way  
  
No one stands a chance when Im lashing out  
Random hate there is no other way  
Its my discipline its my way of life  
  
Never wanted bliss never wanted you  
Never needed anyone Ive polluted  
Everything you feel everything you are  
Everything youll ever be you repulse me  
Its always about you always come at me  
With shit I cant identify you know it makes me  
Lose my fuckin mind all the fuckin time  
Cant control the violence thats spewing from me  
  
Take it  
Cant stop the  
Violence I love it  
No ones immune to hate that flows from it  
  
Infectious I feed on it  
Every fucking endless day  
Youre either on my side or else youre in my way  
No one stands a chance when Im lashing out  
Random hate there is no other way  
Its my discipline its my way of life
