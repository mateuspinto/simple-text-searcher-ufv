Oh I think I smell a rat  
Oh I think I smell a rat  
All you little kids  
Seem to think you know  
Just where its at  
Oh I think I smell a rat  
Walking down the street  
Carrying a baseball bat  
Oh I think I smell a rat  
  
Oh I think I smell a rat  
Oh I think I smell a rat  
  
All you little kids  
Seem to think you know  
Just where is at  
Oh I think I smell a rat  
Using your mother and father  
For a welcome mat  
Oh I think I smell a rat
