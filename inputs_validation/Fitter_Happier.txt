Fitter happier more productive  
Comfortable  
Not drinking too much  
Regular exercise at the gym  
Three days a week  
Getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries  
At ease  
Eating well  
No more microwave dinners and saturated fats  
A patient better driver  
A safer car  
Baby smiling in back seat  
Sleeping well  
No bad dreams  
No paranoia  
Careful to all animals  
Never washing spiders down the plughole  
Keep in contact with old friends  
Enjoy a drink now and then  
Will frequently check credit at moral bank hole in the wall  
Favors for favors  
Fond but not in love  
Charity standing orders  
On Sundays ring road supermarket  
No killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants  
Car wash  
Also on Sundays  
No longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows  
Nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate  
Nothing so childish at a better pace  
Slower and more calculated  
No chance of escape  
Now selfemployed  
Concerned but powerless  
An empowered and informed member of society  
Pragmatism not idealism  
Will not cry in public  
Less chance of illness  
Tires that grip in the wet  
Shot of baby strapped in back seat  
A good memory  
Still cries at a good film  
Still kisses with saliva  
No longer empty and frantic like a cat tied to a stick  
Thats driven into frozen winter shit  
The ability to laugh at weakness  
Calm  
Fitter  
Healthier and more productive  
A pig in a cage on antibiotics
