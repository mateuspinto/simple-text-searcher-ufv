Some call it country with a little bit of rhythm and blues  
And when the boys start rockin  
Theres a beat that you just cant lose  
Where its gonna take us nobody knows  
It sure feels good to the body and soul  
  
Chorus  
I love the slide of a steal guitar  
I love the moan of an old blues harp  
I love the shake of a tambourine  
I love the bass when its low and mean  
So put on your shoutin shoes  
And turn it loose  
Turn it loose  
  
You feel like dancin  
And you just cant stay in your seat  
Your knees start knockin  
And you cant help stompin your feet  
Before you even know it youll be singin a long  
Makes me want to stay hear all night long  
  
Chorus  
  
Turn it loose  
Everybody put on your shoutin shoes and turn it loose  
Grab your shoutin shoes and turn it loose
