High velocity bullet at close range  
Can damage the mind  
Shattering the skull shredding the brain  
Severing the spine  
  
Bury a round of lead in the chest  
Its quite an impression  
Imagine the innards of your soul  
The infliction  
  
Chorus  
Instinctive regression  
With intent to kill  
No regard of human life  
Or the blood spilled  
  
Riddled convulsions  
Confetti of flesh  
Scattered helplessly  
Losing your control of physical  
Facilities  
  
Release the slide to cleanse inside  
Prepare to anoint  
Snap the tongue in the groove discharge  
To make my hallowed point  
  
Chorus  
  
The power of a gun  
Used with conviction  
Dispersed on excursions  
Randomly kills its victims  
  
My sweet revenge  
Bitter in depression  
The thrilling release  
Of a hatred deep persuasion  
  
The power of a gun  
Used with conviction  
Diffused compulsions  
Unending repercussions  
  
Violent emotion  
Screaming revolution  
Spasmic convulsions  
Death an empty gun
