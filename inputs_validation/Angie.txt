Angie Angie  
When will those clouds all disappear  
Angie Angie  
Where will it lead us from here  
With no lovin in our soul and no money in our coats  
You cant say were satisfied  
But Angie Angie  
You cant say we never tried  
  
Angie youre beautiful  
But I hate that sadness in your eyes  
Angie I still love you baby  
Remember all those nights we cried  
All the dreams were held so close  
Seemed to all go up in smoke  
Let me whisper in your ear  
Angie Angie  
Where will it lead us from here Yeah  
  
All the dreams we held so close  
Seemed to all go up in smoke  
Hate that sadness in your eyes  
But Angie I still love you baby  
Everywhere I look I see your eyes  
There aint a woman that comes close to you  
Come on baby dry your eyes  
But Angie Angie  
Aint it good to be alive  
Angie Angie you cant say we never tried
