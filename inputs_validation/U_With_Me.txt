Intro DMX  
What these bitches want from a nigga  
  
Verse 1  
On some DMX shit  
I group DM my exes  
I tell em they belong to me that goes on for forever  
And I think we just get closer when we not together  
You tell me that Im confusin  
More immature than Marques Houston  
Cuts too deep for a bandaid solution  
We too deep in this thing youll never lose me  
LOLOL Im glad you find this shit amusin  
Heard a lot about me fore we started off  
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras  
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars  
Thats why shes always correctin me when my time is off  
And my house is the definition  
Of alcohol and weed addiction  
You got a different vision  
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen  
Without runnin into one of my niggas  
Thats not the way we livin  
Too much goin on its just not realistic  
These days I dont talk bout them days like I miss em  
And you shouldnt miss em either we different people  
But every time we speakin  
  
Hook  
Its like a lot of games bein played  
Hows it goin down  
If its on til we gone then I gots to know now  
Is you wit me or what  
Yeah  
Its like a lot of games are bein played  
Hows it goin down  
If its on til we gone then I gots to know now  
Is you wit me or what  
Yeah  
  
Verse 2  
I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs  
Where youre getting me  
All that grey in our conversation history you  
Playin mind games when you sayin things  
Playin mime games we both doin the same thing  
Slide on a late night  
You like to slide on a late night  
You send the are you here text without an invite  
Thats that shit that I dont like  
We both slide on a late night  
Do things in our off time  
We both yeah  
Made some mistakes pon road  
Yeah hows that for real  
You toyin with it like Happy Meal  
3 dots you thinkin of a reaction still  
While youre typin make sure you tell me  
  
Hook  
What type of games are bein played  
Hows it goin down  
If its on til we gone then I gots to know now  
Is you wit me or what

What type of games are bein played  
Hows it goin down  
If its on til we gone then I gots to know now

Verse 3  
Remember you was livin at The London for a month  
Service elevator up to 4201  
We was still a secret couldnt come in through the front  
Girl I had your back when all you used to do was front  
Thats for sure though I made a career off reminiscin  
Time got a funny way of tickin things are so much different  
Ill admit it Ive admitted to a lot of things  
Act like you know it fuck them stories fuck the shade they throwin  
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need  
And on my way to make this dough  
A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow  
A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow Ohhh ohhh  
Tryna give your ass the world  
You runnin your fingers through my curls  
You knew me when the kid had waves  
But thats enough of that  
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass  
And thats some real shit
