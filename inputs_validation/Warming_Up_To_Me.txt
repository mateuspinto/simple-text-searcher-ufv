In a certain row of a garden grove  
A lady learns to sleep  
While surrounded not where all the flowers grow  
On an empty orchard street  
She is dreaming of her holiday  
From a working glass menagerie  
Oh her hands are cold  
Unimaginable that shes warming up to me  
  
Im a passerby in a promise land  
And I face no direction  
Somewhere between the towns of lost and found  
In the state of confusion  
Sure our dreaming is pure wonderment  
But our feelings are no accident  
If my heart is cold it wont forever be  
Cause your warming up to me  
  
And fate is not a mission  
Its an unconditional high  
When I saw you in the garden  
You reminded me  
I can see the stars are on your shoulders now  
And what the wind and your skin have in common  
Am I taller Well if feels as though Im above the ground  
Youre inviting me to go down  
  
Are you warming up  
Are you burning up  
Warming up to love  
Are you warming up tonight
