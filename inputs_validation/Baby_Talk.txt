This is a song about Spike  
He is a bad ass guy  
Who just happens to be  
A really good friend of mine  
  
Everyone I know yeah  
Who knows Spike too  
Would agree when I say the words  
That spike is cool  
  
Yeah the problem with my friend Spike  
He has fallen into  
A true love with a nice girl  
Who has gotta lot of tattoos  
  
He always talks crazy  
Whenever she calls  
He always talks like a baby  
Yeah its obvious  
She has got him by the balls  
She has got him by the balls  
She has got him by the balls  
  
My weird little brother James  
And his exgirlfriend  
They would talk in those ridiculous voices  
We would all be hanging out getting drunk  
In the neighborhood  
And they both would make those ridiculous noises  
  
He would always talk crazy  
Whenever she calls  
He always talks like a baby  
It is obvious  
They have got him by the balls  
  
I hate you when you talk like that  
I wish you would act like a grown man  
I wish you would act like a grown man  
I wish you would act like a grown man  
They have got you by the balls  
They have got you by the balls  
They have got you by the balls  
They have got you by the balls  
  
You will never see me  
Walking that walk  
You will never catch me  
Talking that baby talk  
  
Which brings us back to Spike  
A good guy to have in a fight  
Unless he  
With his girlfriend Obnoxious  
On a Saturday night  
  
You know he couldnt care less  
What anyone thinks  
He does not give a damn  
No because he has no shame  
  
He always looks so happy  
Just like everything is fine  
He is oblivious to the fact  
That he has no spine  
  
He always talks crazy  
You have no shame  
Whenever she calls  
You have no shame  
He talks like a baby  
You have no shame  
It is obvious  
They have got him by the balls  
  
I hate you when you talk like that  
I wish you could act like a grown man  
I wish you could act like a grown man  
They have got him by the balls  
They have got him by the balls  
  
You will never see me  
Walking that walk  
You will never see me  
Talking that baby talk  
You know its true  
Theyve got you by the balls  
  
I am not going to let it get to me  
I am not going to let it get to me  
I am not going to let it get to me  
I am not going to let them get to me  
I am not going to let them get to me  
  
Theyve got you by the balls  
Theyve got you by the balls  
Theyve got you by the balls  
Theyve got you by the balls
