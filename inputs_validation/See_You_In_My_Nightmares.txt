I got the right to put up a fight  
But not quite cause you cut off my light  
But my sight is better tonight and I might  
See you in my nightmare oh how did you get there  
Cause we were once a fairytale  
But this is farewell  
  
I got my life and its my only one  
I got the night Im running from the sun  
So goodnight I made it out the door door door door  
After tonight there will be no return  
After tonight Im taking off on the road  
Im taking off on the road  
  
And that you know that you know  
Tell every one that you know  
That I dont love you no more  
And thats one thing that you know that you know

You do you and Im just gone do mine  
You do you cause Im just gone be fine  
Okay I got you out my mind

That I dont love you no more  
And thats one thing that you know

But my sight is better tonight and I might  
See you in my nightmare oh but how did you get there  
Cause we were once a fairytale  
But this is farewell
