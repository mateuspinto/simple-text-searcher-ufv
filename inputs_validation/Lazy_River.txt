Up a lazy river by the old mill run  
Lazy river in the noon day sun  
Linger in the shade of a tree  
Throw away your troubles dream with me  
  
Up a lazy river where the robins song  
Wakes that mornin as we roll along  
Blue skies up above everyones in love  
Up a lazy river how happy we will be  
Up a lazy river with me  
  
Up a lazy river by that old mill run  
That lazy hazy river in the noon day sun  
You can linger for a while in the shade of a tree  
Throw away your troubles baby dream of me  
  
Up a lazy river where the robins song  
Wakes that bright new mornin as we roll along  
There may be blue skies up above  
But as long as were in love  
Up a lazy river how happy we could be  
If you go up a lazy river with me
