Acid casualties and angry young men  
The litmus test of a guitar and pen  
Revolve around date sheets lost lonely rooms  
And this is my home and I will leave soon  
For a house with a tower  
Where theres visiting hours  
And the day leaves its taste on a spoon  
The black eye of the camera bruised by my blush  
Leaves another chin and another hair cut  
The image in focus the shot aims to kill  
And Im cropped at the waist as I run through the mill  
So Im lost for an encore  
The Kodachrome wants more  
Now Im snapped with my head in the still  
  
The contracts been signed with a stroke of my blood  
Im drowned by the name that sinks in the mud  
Thrown from emotion to swim back to the shore  
Where the sound of a drum beats time to applause  
Now my lifes in danger  
Of ending up stranger  
Than the stranger who walked on the shore  
  
Stranger than the stranger  
Who walks by my bed  
Shares in my life  
Lives although dead  
Stranger than the stranger I am sure  
Stranger than the stranger on the shore
