If God had long hair  
And a goatee  
And if his eyes looked pretty glazed  
If He looked spaced out  
Would you buy his story  
Would you believe he had an eye infection  
And yeah yeah God he looks baked  
And yeah yeah God He smells good  
And yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
What if God smoked cannabis  
Hit the bung like some of us  
Drove a tiedyed microbus  
And he subscribed to Rolling Stone  
When God made this place  
In the beginning  
Did He plant any seeds  
Or did he put them there for Adam and Eve  
So theyd be hungry for the apple that the snake  
Was always offering  
And yeah yeah God rolls great  
And yeah yeah God he smells good  
And yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
What if God smoked cannabis  
Do you suppose he had a buzz  
When he made the platypus  
When he created earth our home  
Does He like Pearl Jam or the Stones  
And do you think He rolls His own  
Up there in heaven on the throne  
And when the saints go marching home  
Does he just sit and smoke a bone
