It takes a million people  
To build up a good reputation  
But it takes one stupid fool  
To destroy everything they done  
The world knows your people as  
The most violent in the world  
The world knows your nation as  
The most oppressive in the world  
Take it upon yourself  
To restore your nations dignity  
Yo ho ho ho ho ho ho  
  
Teach the world  
Teach them right  
  
It takes a million lives  
To get the respect you deserve  
When people see your kind  
Some of them would run a mile  
The world knows your people as  
A nation of crooks  
Everyone around you should  
Always keep their eyes opened  
The world knows your nation as  
A nation of drug lords  
Everyone blames your people  
For the destruction of the world  
Take it upon yourself  
To restore your nations dignity  
Ho ho ho ho ho ho  
  
Teach the world  
Teach them right  
Teach the world  
Teach them right  
Teach the world  
Teach them right
