I am cow hear me moo  
I weigh twice as much as you  
And I look good on the barbecue  
Yogurt curd cream cheese and butters  
made from liquid from my udders  
I am cow I am cow hear me moo  
  
I am cow eating grass  
methane gas comes out my ass  
and out my muzzle when I belch  
o the ozone layer is thinner  
from the outcome of my dinner  
I am cow I am cow Ive got gas  
  
I am cow here I stand  
far and wide upon this land  
and I am living everywhere  
from BC to Newfoundland  
You can squeeze my teats by hand  
I am cow I am cow I am cow  
I am cow I am cow I am cow
