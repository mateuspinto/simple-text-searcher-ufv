When the day is done  
Down to earth then sinks the sun  
Along with everything that was lost and won  
When the day is done  
  
When the day is done  
Hope so much your race will be all run  
Then you find you jumped the gun  
Have to go back where you began  
When the day is done  
  
When the night is cold  
Some get by but some get old  
Just to show lifes not made of gold  
When the night is cold  
  
When the bird has flown
