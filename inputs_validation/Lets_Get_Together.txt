Love is but a song we sing  
Fear a way we die  
You can make the mountains ring  
Or hear the angels cry  
Though the dove is on the wing  
You need not know why  
  
Come on people now  
Smile on your brother  
Everybody get together  
Try to love one another right now  
  
Some will come and some will go  
We shall surely pass  
When the wind that left us here  
Returns for us at last  
We are but a moments sunlight  
Fading on the grass  
  
Come on people now  
Smile on your brother  
Everybody get together  
Try to love one another right now  
  
If you hear the song Im singing  
You will understand  
You hold the key to love and fear  
All in your trembling hand  
One key unlocks them both you know  
Its at your command  
  
Come on people now  
Smile on your brother  
Everybody get together  
Try to love one another right now  
  
Come on people now  
Smile on your brother  
Everybody get together  
Try to love one another right now  
  
Come on people now  
Smile on your brother  
Everybody get together  
Try to love one another right now
