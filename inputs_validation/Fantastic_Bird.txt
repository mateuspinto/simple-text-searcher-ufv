So then youve found your place  
You say I wanna be the first  
Stand up comedian in outer space  
But then in a fantastic bird  
Fantastic bird  
  
Space is gonna thrill you space could even kill you  
But space will never love you like I do  
  
Reflecting light down to earth  
Oh yes and then some humor too  
Just enough to make us know we dont miss you  
Have you checked suspension in the fantastic bird  
Fantastic bird  
  
Science can engulf you science then propels you  
But science will never love you like I do  
  
What brings you down to earth  
Ah yes of course yes yes it was a lack of applause  
Scrap metal for a fantastic bird  
Fantastic bird  
  
Science propels you science still engulfs you  
But science will never love you like I do  
  
Cause when you land all you do I hear is my voice  
Hello welcome I love you dont you see  
Dont you see
