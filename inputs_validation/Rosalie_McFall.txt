Out on the lonely hillside in a cabin low and small  
Lived the sweetest rose of color my Rosie Mcfall  
  
Her eyes were bright and shining and her voice was sweet to me  
Knew that I would always love her and I hoped that she loved me  
  
My eyes turned to me my darling and this is what she said  
You know that I would always love you when you and I are wed  
  
Then God way up in heaven one day for her did call  
I lost my bride oh how I loved her my Rosie Mcfall  
  
I searched this wide world over through cities great and small  
But I never found another like my Rosie Mcfall
