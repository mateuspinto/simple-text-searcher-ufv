Blue lace her gown was blue lace  
She wore the promise of springtime and laughter  
Daybreak we talked till daybreak  
Without a warning of what might come after  
  
Her touch was velvet I still can feel it  
That one brief moment that ended in space  
Sometime in midDecember  
I hear the music the echo of springtime laughter  
  
All day I see the old days  
When Id seen the young girls in blue blue lace  
Her gown was blue lace such lovely blue lace  
Her gown was blue
