From a phone booth in Cheyenne  
I made a promise to Diane  
No more rodeos  
Id gone my last go round  
  
The same promise that I made  
In San Antone and Santa Fe  
But tonight I saddled up  
And let her down  
  
Wild horses keep draggin me away  
And Ill lose more than Im gonna win someday  
Wild horses just stay wild  
And her heart is all I break  
Wild horses keep draggin me away  
  
Shell watch me drive around her block  
Gettin courage up to stop  
To make her one more promise  
That I cant keep  
  
The way I love the rodeo  
I guess I should let her go  
Before I hurt her more  
Than she loves me  
  
Wild horses keep draggin me away  
And Ill lose more than Im gonna win someday  
Wild horses just stay wild  
And her heart is all I break  
Wild horses keep draggin me away  
Wild horses keep draggin me away  
And Ill lose more than Im gonna win someday  
Wild horses just stay wild  
And her heart is all I break  
Wild horses keep draggin me away
