Dee Dee  
They can go away  
Isnt it strange you always leaving things  
Never mind I know this rule is not a whole  
I hope I made you feel less alone  
Think of me while you roam  
  
Ray Charles  
It is no strange  
But its more more than just a night of fame  
There are things I believe should never be told girl no  
But youre the only one I want to hold  
Cause it can get off the cold  
  
Dee Dee  
Precious thing  
You know I love you  
Youre such a wonderful thing  
You make me dizzy whispering in my ear  
Send my love to the next somewhere  
  
Ray Charles  
Aint it funny right  
Im always losing things  
But youre like me youve known roaming  
I hope I made you feel less alone  
Think of me as you roam  
  
Both  
Oh precious thing  
You know I love you  
Youre such a wonderful thing  
Girl you make me dizzy whispering in my ear  
You my love till the next somewhere  
  
Dee Dee  
Say no strength of freedom  
Is still as much yours as my thing  
I know promises can be hard to keep  
The price I pay to let oh baby  
Was just to steal to steal my love from thee  
  
Both  
Precious thing  
You know I love you  
Youre such a wonderful thing  
You make me dizzy whispering in my ear  
Feel my love till the next somewhere
