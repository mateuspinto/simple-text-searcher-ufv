First she sees her hypnotist  
When she rushes to her psychiatrist  
She sees her acupuncturist  
Shes got to got to get fixed  
  
Then she sees her scientologist  
Gets fed by her nutritionist  
She can not seem to resist  
Seeking cosmic consciousness  
  
Looks like shes floundering again  
Seems to be floundering again  
Looks like shes floundering again  
Seems to be floundering again  
  
She swears by Jack La Lanne  
then she throws the I Ching again  
She searches in the Himalayas  
For someone to ease the pain  
  
Looks like shes floundering again  
Seems to be floundering again  
Looks like shes floundering again  
Seems to be floundering again  
  
Shes looking for a cure  
She does not know exactly what for  
  
Looks like shes floundering again  
Seems to be floundering again  
Looks like shes floundering again  
Seems to be floundering again  
  
Shes into political activism  
Reading up on Tibetan Buddism  
Anna Freuds analysed her dreams  
And shes hoarse from primal screams  
  
Looks like shes floundering again  
Seems to be floundering again  
Looks like shes floundering again  
Seems to be floundering again
