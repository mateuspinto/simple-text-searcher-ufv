Best things in life are not free  
But you dont need to have money  
To get the things that you want to own  
You just have to get a loan  
When you buy small or large  
Just put it on your credit card  
You can live like a king  
Not paying for a single thing  
  
Put it on credit and then forget it  
Dont let it bother you no more no more  
Put it on credit and then forget it  
And go back to the store  
  
Every night I pray and thank  
God above for creating the banks  
They have been so kind to me  
With their bounless generosity  
  
If you cannot make your payments  
Well do like the national governments  
And you can pay off what you owe  
By taking out a bigger loan  
  
You gotta put it on credit and then forget it  
Dont let it bother you no more no more  
Put it on credit and then forget it  
And go back to the store  
  
Now I seem to have men after me  
From the collection agency  
And the bank came by the other day  
Took everything I own away  
  
Now I think that it is plain to see  
That I must declare bankruptcy  
But things arent really all that bad  
I can borrow from my dad  
  
And put it on credit and then forget it  
Dont let it bother you no more no more  
Put it on credit and then forget it  
And go back to the store  
  
You gotta put it on credit and then forget it  
Dont let it bother you no more no more  
Put it on credit and then forget it  
And go back to the store
