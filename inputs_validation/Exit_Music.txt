Wake from your sleep  
The drying of your tears  
Today we escape  
We escape  
  
Pack and get dressed  
Before your father hears us  
Before all hell breaks loose  
  
Breathe keep breathing  
Dont lose your nerve  
Breathe keep breathing  
I cant do this alone  
  
Sing us a song  
A song to keep us warm  
Theres such a chill  
Such a chill  
  
You can laugh  
A spineless laugh  
We hope that your rules and wisdom choke you  
Now we are one  
In everlasting peace  
  
We hope that you choke that you choke  
We hope that you choke that you choke  
We hope that you choke that you choke
