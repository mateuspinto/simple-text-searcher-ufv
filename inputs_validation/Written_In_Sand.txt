Your eyes are the color of the sea  
You look my way and the waves  
Wash over me  
Your body shivers with the  
Fading light  
You say  
Baby lets just make it last tonight  
  
And when the morning comes  
You take me by the hand  
And say our love is written in sand  
Written in sand  
  
We hear the ocean roar  
Were swept away on to some  
Distant shore  
You whisper secrets of the heart  
They keep us close when the  
World keeps us apart  
  
Until tomorrow comes  
Time is on our hands  
Because this love is written in  
Sand  
Written in sand  
  
Nothing lies between  
A woman and a man  
When their love is written in sand  
When their love is written in sand  
When their love is written in sand
