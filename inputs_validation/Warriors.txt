I am the warrior  
I serve the death machine  
Losers or conquerors  
All flash past on my silver screen  
  
Death is no easy answer  
For those who wish to know  
Ask those who have been before you  
What fate the future holds  
  
It aint pretty  
  
I am a messenger  
The message here you must know  
I am the warrior  
I deliver the fatal blow  
  
So fate will have to wait  
Till time can heal the scar  
My heart is ruled by Venus  
And my head by Mars
