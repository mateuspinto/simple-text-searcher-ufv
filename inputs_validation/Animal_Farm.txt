This world is big and wild and half insane  
Take me where real animals are playing  
Just a dirty old shack  
Where the hound dogs bark  
That we called our home  
I want to be back there  
Among the cats and dogs  
And the pigs and the goats  
On Animal Farm my animal home  
On Animal Farm my animal home  
  
While I lay my head upon my pillow  
Little girl come play beneath my willow  
Though shes far from home  
She is free from harm  
And she need not fear  
Shes by my side and the sky is wide  
So let the sun shine bright  
On Animal Farm my animal home  
On Animal Farm my animal home  
  
Girl its a hard hard world  
If it gets you down  
Dreams often fade and die  
In a bad bad world  
  
Ill take you where real animals are playing  
And people are real people not just playing  
Its a quiet quiet life  
By a dirty old shack  
That we called our home  
I want to be back there  
Among the cats and dogs  
And the pigs and the goats  
On Animal Farm my animal home  
On Animal Farm my animal home
