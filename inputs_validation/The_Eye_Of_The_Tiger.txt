Originally by Survivor  
  
Rising up back on the street  
Did my time took my chances  
Went the distance now Im back on my feet  
Just a man and his will to survive  
  
So many times it happens too fast  
You change your passion for glory  
Dont lose your grip on the dreams of the past  
You must fight just to keep them alive  
  
Its the eye of the tiger its the thrill of the fight  
Rising up to the challenge of our rival  
And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night  
And hes watching us all in the eye of the tiger  
  
Face to face out in the heat  
Hanging tough staying hungry  
They stack the odds til we take to the street  
For we kill with the skill to survive  
  
Its the eye of the tiger its the thrill of the fight  
Rising up to the challenge of our rival  
And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night  
And hes watching us all in the eye of the tiger  
  
Rising up straight to the top  
Have the guts got the glory  
Went the distance now Im not gonna stop  
Just a man and his will to survive  
  
Its the eye of the tiger its the thrill of the fight  
Rising up to the challenge of our rival  
And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night  
And hes watching us all in the eye of the tiger  
  
The eye of the tiger  
Repeats out
