Standing by my window breathing summer breeze  
Saw a figure floating neath the willow tree  
Asked us if we were happy we said we didnt know  
Took us by the hands and up we go  
  
We followed the dreamer through the purple hazy clouds  
He could control our sense of time  
We thought we were lost but no matter how we tried  
Everyone was in peace of mind  
  
We felt the sensations drift inside our frames  
Finding complete contentment there  
And all the tensions that hurt us in the past  
Just seemed to vanish in thin air  
  
He said in the cosmos is a single sonic sound  
That is vibrating constantly  
And if we could grip and hold on to the note  
We would see our minds were freeoh theyre free  
  
We are lost above  
Floating way up high  
If you think you can find a way  
You can surely try
