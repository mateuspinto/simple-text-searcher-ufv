Never knew what hurtin was until today never thought that I could ever feel
this way  
Missing you missing you and only you what can I do missing you  
In my dreams I feel you laying next to me  
But the morning sun wakes up the loneliness in me  
Missing you missing you and only you what can I do missing you  
Was leaving me easy to do was someone somewhere waiting for you  
If this is what you wanted to do all I ask is a reason from you  
Walkin the floor tryin to keep my soul from wanting you  
And everywhere I look theres something else to remind me of you  
Missing you missing you and only you what can I do missing you hmm
