This is the moment Ive waited for  
I can hear my heart singing  
Soon bells will be ringing  
  
This is the moment of sweet aloha  
I will love you longer than forever  
Promise me that you will leave me never  
  
Here and now dear  
All my love I vow dear  
Promise me that you will leave me never  
I will love you longer than forever  
  
Now that we are one  
Clouds wont hide the sun  
Blue skies of hawaii smile  
On this our wedding day  
  
I do I do  
love you love you  
With all my heart
