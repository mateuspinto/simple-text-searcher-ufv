Lady Dolphin and her dolphin beau  
Were swimming out to sea one day  
All the other lady dolphins smiled  
But they were smiling in that subtle dolphin way  
  
So they pretended that theyd pay it no mind  
But she was female of the jealous kind  
She couldnt stand it  not to ask him why  
She could see that he was flattered by the twinkle in his eye  
  
She said How much do you need me  
How much do you need me  
Would you stay with me till this ocean floor is dry  
But if you cannot find the words that say  
Im the only one you love that way  
I guess well have to say goodbye  
  
He said My love for you is wider than the wide Sargasso Sea  
There aint no bigger number I know but  
I never counted every ripple on the sea  
  
He said that words had never failed him yet  
But before our future course is set  
I have to find a way to win you dear  
But theres two atmospheres of pressure on me here  
  
How much do I need you How much do I need you  
Cant seem to find the words to make you stay  
But remember all the things Ive said  
That Ill love you till the day Im dead  
Cause I need you like this hole in my head  
I need you like this hole in my head
