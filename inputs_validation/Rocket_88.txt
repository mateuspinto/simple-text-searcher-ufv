Yea I think I know  
I really hate it when it gets too slow  
I gotta try and keep myself amused  
I love the way my rocket purrs  
I like it best when I see blurs  
You gotta love to watch me light my fuse  
  
No more lookin back to yesterday  
I got the thing to blow us both away  
All I need is you to navigate  
So come and ride my Rocket 88  
  
Call it chump change I think not  
Cause I got sumpn no one else has got  
Its no look like and it aint no protege  
Its nuclear my Rocket 88  
  
Well get down on the darkside of the moon  
And leave a little somthin on the dune  
This home by ten is gonna have to wait  
Cause we got a Rocket 88  
  
Light years honey thats how far well go  
Lets fire it up and watch the rockets glow  
Gee suit gspot gee I really must admit  
I got my Rocket 88 honey this is it  
  
So no more up against the wall  
Just come with me and watch the earth get small  
I swear you never will come down at all  
So if you like it in your face  
Ill rub your nose into outer space  
And turn into a red hot fireball
