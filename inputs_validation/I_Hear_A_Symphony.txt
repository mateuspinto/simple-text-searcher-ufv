Youre givin me true love  
And everyday I thank the Lord  
For a feeling thats so new  
So inviting so exciting  
  
Whenever your near I hear a symphony  
A tender melody pulling me closer closer to your arms  
Then suddenly your lips are touching mine  
A feeling so divine still I need a path because  
Im lost in a world made for you and me  
  
Baby baby  
I hear a symphony baby  
Whenever your near I hear a symphony  
Played sweet and tenderly  
Every time your lips meet mine my baby  
  
Baby baby  
I feel the joy begin  
Dont let this feeling end  
Let it go on and on and on now baby  
  
Baby baby  
Those tears that filled my eyes  
I cried not for myself  
But for those who have never felt the joy of love  
  
Baby baby  
Whenever your near  
I hear a symphony  
Each time you speak of me  
I hear a tender note so sweet of love  
  
Baby baby  
As you stand there holding me  
Whispering how much you care  
A thousand violins fill the air now  
  
Baby baby  
Dont let this moment end  
Keep standing close to me  
So close to me my baby baby baby  
  
Baby baby  
I hear a symphony  
A tender melody  
I hear a symphony
