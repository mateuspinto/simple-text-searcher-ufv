Up those stone steps I climb  
Hail this joyful days return  
Into its great shadowed vault I go  
Hail the pentecostal morn  
  
The reading is from luke 24  
Where christ returns to his loved ones  
I look at the stone apostles  
Think that its alright for some  
  
And I wish that I was made of stone  
So that I would not have to see  
A beauty impossible to define  
A beauty impossible to believe  
  
A beauty impossible to endure  
The blood imparted in little sips  
The smell of you still on my hands  
As I bring the cup up to my lips  
  
No God up in the sky  
No devil beneath the sea  
Could do the job that you did baby  
Of bringing me to my knees  
  
Outside I sit on the stone steps  
With nothing much to do  
Forlorn and exhausted baby  
By the absence of you
