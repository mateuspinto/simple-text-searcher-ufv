There are many wonders in the usa  
The cities and the people and Disney World hooray  
But coming back to Canada with joy the heart does ooze  
Cause when you get to the border you buy a bottle of booze  
You buy a bottle of booze  
You buy a bottle of booze  
When you get to the border you buy a bottle of booze  
You buy a bottle of booze  
You buy a bottle of booze  
When you get to the border you buy a bottle of booze  
I was traveling with a gentleman who didnt like to drink  
When we got to the border I commenced to think  
I said Do me a favour and he did not refuse  
When we got to the border he bought me a bottle of booze  
You buy a bottle of booze  
You buy a bottle of booze  
When you get to the border you buy a bottle of booze  
You buy a bottle of booze  
You buy a bottle of booze  
When you get to the border you buy a bottle of booze  
You may be in a comedy act touring through the States  
Youre playing hard in country bars things arent going great  
A fight breaks out at the pool table you run before you bruise  
But you call the tour successful and buy a bottle of booze  
You buy a bottle of booze  
You buy a bottle of booze  
When you get to the border you buy a bottle of booze  
You buy a bottle of booze  
You buy a bottle of booze  
When you get to the border you buy a bottle of booze  
Ok the sad verse now the sad verse  
A friend of mine came to me his face awash in tears  
For he could afford the spirit that gave him cheers aww  
I said Aw Stop yer cryin Ill wash away those blues  
When I was at the border I bought ya a bottle of booze   
You buy a bottle of booze hey  
You buy a bottle of booze hey  
When you get to the border you buy a bottle of booze  
You buy a bottle of booze hey  
You buy a bottle of booze hey  
When you get to the border you buy a bottle of booze  
You buy a bottle of booze hey  
You buy a bottle of booze hey  
When you get to the border you buy a bottle of booze
