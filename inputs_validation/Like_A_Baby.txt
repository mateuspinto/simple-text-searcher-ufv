Foreign skies  
Blinded me to empty charms  
I crossed the ocean  
Fell into your arms  
  
So sure so wrong  
You sang me a simple tune  
I took if for a song  
  
Say goodbye  
Dont tell me why you have to go  
Loving you was as good as gone  
As good as gone  
  
Id love to know you  
Really know you  
But you see theres something you should know  
I never really thought youd go  
  
Because today  
I would have sworn I heard you say  
I love you  
I want you  
I need to be with you today  
I saw something in your face  
  
Stay here beside me  
I need your love to guide me  
Your love  
But now its gone away  
You left me crying like a baby  
Like a baby
