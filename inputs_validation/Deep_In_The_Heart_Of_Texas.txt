The stars at night  are big and bright  
Deep in the heart of texas  
The prairie sky  is wide and high  
Deep in the heart of texas  
The sage in bloom  is like perfume  
Deep in the heart of texas  
Reminds me of  the one I love  
Deep in the heart of texas  
The cowboys cry  kiyippieyi  
Deep in the heart of texas  
The rabbits rush  around the brush  
Deep in the heart of texas  
The coyotes wail  along the trail  
Deep in the heart of texas  
The doggies bawl  and bawl and bawl  
Deep in the heart of texas
