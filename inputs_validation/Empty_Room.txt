Empty room empty room  
How am I gonna fill U  
How am I gonna fill this empty room  
  
Love is strong however long  
We shouldve been 4ever  
How am I ever gonna fill this empty room  
  
Found a strand of your hair  
By the bathroom window  
How am I ever gonna get U off my mind  
  
In my bed in my head  
Every word Uve spoken  
Now how am I gonna fill this empty room  
  
Lonely hearts worlds apart  
Why should they be broken  
When we could be somewhere makin love  
  
Love is strong however long  
We shouldve been 4ever  
Baby why did U leave me all alone  
Whyd U do it  
  
Barren walls tears fall  
Whats the use in cryin  
I gotta find a way find a way 2 fill this empty room
