No blood no glory  
All pain and fury  
A demonstration  
Of domination  
Show of pure intimidation  
  
Full contact why I live and breathe  
Side stepping all the human debris  
Head strong I know that Ill prevail  
Face down in my arena you will fall  
Head to head eye to eye  
Human pile of proven pride  
Ripping flesh spitting teeth  
Sacrifice for victory  
Base line goal lie  
Overtime killing time  
Relentless brotherhood of disciple  
Centuries of traditions is to win  
Head first into battle feel the rush  
Living on adrenaline your try is crushed  
  
No blood no glory  
All pain and fury  
Head to head eye to eye  
Human pile of proven pride  
Ripping flesh spitting teeth  
Sacrifice for victory  
Base line goal line  
Overtime killing time
