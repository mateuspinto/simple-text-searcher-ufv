O my love is like a red red rose  
Thats newly sprung in June  
O my love is like a melody  
Thats sweetly played in tune  
So fair art thou my bonnie lass  
So deep in love am I  
And I will love thee still  
My dear till a the seas gang dry  
Till a the seas gang dry my dear  
And the rocks melt wi the sun  
And I will love thee still my dear  
While the sands of life shall run  
And fare thee weel my only love  
And fare thee weel awhile  
And I will come again my dear  
Tho twere ten thousand mile  
Tho twere ten thousand miles my dear  
Tho twere ten thousand miles  
And I will come again my dear  
Tho twere ten thousand miles
