Goodnight my love  
Pleasant dreams and sleep tight my love  
May tomorrow be sunny and bright  
And bring you closer to me  
  
Before you go  
Please remember I need you so  
And this love I have for me  
Will never go cold  
  
If you should awake in the still of the night  
Please have no fear  
Just close your eyes  
Then you realize  
That my love will watch over you dear always  
  
Goodnight my love  
Pleasant dreams and sleep tight my love  
May tomorrow be sunny and bright  
And bring you closer to me  
  
If you should awake in the still of the night  
Please have no fear  
Just close your eyes  
Then you realize  
That my love will watch over you dear always  
  
Goodnight my love  
Pleasant dreams and sleep tight my love  
May tomorrow be sunny and bright  
And bring you closer to me
