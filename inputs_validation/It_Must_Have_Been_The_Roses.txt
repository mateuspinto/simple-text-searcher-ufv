Annie laid her head down in the roses  
She had ribbons ribbons ribbons  
in her long brown hair  
I dont know it must have been the roses  
All I know is I could not leave her there  
  
I dont know it must have been the roses  
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair  
I dont know maybe it was the roses  
All I know was I could not leave her there  
  
Ten years the waves rolled the  
ships home from the sea  
Thinking well how it may blow  
in all good company  
if I tell another what  
your own lips told to me  
may I lay neath the roses  
and my eyes no longer see  
  
I dont know it must have been the roses  
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair  
I dont know maybe it was the roses  
All I know was I could not leave her there  
  
One pane of glass in the window  
No one is complaining though  
come in and shut the door  
Faded is the crimson from the  
ribbons that she wore  
and its strange how no one  
comes round anymore  
  
I dont know it must have been the roses  
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair  
I dont know maybe it was the roses  
All I know was I could not leave her there  
  
Annie laid her head down in the roses  
She had ribbons ribbons ribbons  
in her long brown hair  
I dont know it must have been the roses  
All I know was I could not leave her there  
  
I dont know it must have been the roses  
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair  
I dont know maybe it was the roses  
All I know was I could not leave her there
