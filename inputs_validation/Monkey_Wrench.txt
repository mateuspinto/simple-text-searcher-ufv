What have we done with innocence  
It disappeared with time it never made much sense  
Adolescent resident  
Wasting another night on planning my revenge  
  
One in ten  
One in ten  
One in ten  
  
Dont wanna be your monkey wrench  
One more indecent accident  
Id rather leave than suffer this  
Ill never be your monkey wrench  
All this time to make amends  
What do you do when all your enemies are friends  
Now and then Ill try to bend  
Under pressure wind up snapping in the end  
  
One in ten  
One in ten  
One in ten  
  
Dont wanna be your monkey wrench  
One more indecent accident  
Id rather leave than suffer this  
Ill never be your monkey wrench  
Temper One last thing before I quit  
I never wanted any more than I could fit into my head  
I still remember every single word you said  
And all the shit that somehow came along with it  
Still theres one thing that comforts me  
Since I was always caged and now Im free  
Dont wanna be your monkey wrench  
One more indecent accident  
Id rather leave than suffer this  
  
Ill never be your monkey wrench  
Dont wanna be your monkey wrench  
Dont wanna be your monkey wrench  
Dont wanna be your monkey wrench  
Dont wanna be your monkey wrench
