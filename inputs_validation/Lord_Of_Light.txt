There are secrets that you keep  
There are secrets that you keep  
There are secrets that you tell to me alone  
I cant reach things I cant see  
You dont see this strange world  
Quite the same as me  
Dont deny me what I am  
Nothing hidden still you fail to see the truth  
These are things you cant reveal  
  
These are things you cant reveal  
  
We are part of some strange plan  
Why the slaughter of the brotherhood of man  
Infernal sacrifice of hell  
Fire breathing lead the way  
Mounds of bodies as they all burn into one  
Revenge is living in the past  
Time to look into a new millennium  
  
Spiral path leads through the maze  
Down into the fiery underworld below  
Fire breathing lead the way  
Lucifer was just an angel led astray  
  
Chorus x2  
Free your soul and let it fly  
Give your life to the Lord of Light  
Keep your secrets and rain on me  
All I see are mysteries  
  
We are not worthy in your black  
And blazing eyes  
We gather demons in the mirror every day  
The bridge of darkness casts a  
Shadow on us all  
And all our sins to you we give this day  
  
Others wait their turn  
Their lives were meant to last  
Use yours wisely as the light is fading fast  
Free your soul and let it fly  
Mine was caught I couldnt try  
Time returns again to punish all of us  
  
We are cast out by our bloody fathers hand  
We are strangers in this lonely promised land  
We are the shadows of the one unholy ghost  
In our nightmare world the only one we trust  
  
Chorus x2
