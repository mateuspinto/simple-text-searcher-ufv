Mister Sandman bring me a dream  
Make him the cutest that Ive ever seen  
Give him two lips like roses and clover  
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over  
  
Sandman Im so alone  
Dont have nobody to call my own  
Please turn on your magic beam  
Mister Sandman bring me a dream  
  
Mister Sandman bring me a dream  
Make him the cutest that Ive ever seen  
Give him the word that Im not a rover  
Then tell him that his lonesome nights are over  
  
Mister Sandman bring me a dream  
Give him a pair of eyes with a come hither gleam  
Give him a lonely heart like Pagliacci  
And lots of wavy hair like Liberace  
  
Mister Sandman someone to hold  
Would be so peachy before were too old  
So please turn on your magic beam  
  
Mister Sandman bring us  
Please please please  
Mister Sandman bring us a dream
