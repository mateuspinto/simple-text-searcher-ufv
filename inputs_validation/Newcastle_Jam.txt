And he goes down now  
With his feet up  
He goes brown now  
In the southern sun  
  
He walks out there  
Knows where his friends are  
He walks out there  
Those have a heart  
He go  
  
I wanna break something  
Where you go  
I wanna break some heads  
Down before  
  
All the way down they call  
Crack the eggs right open now  
Rest your back  
Until your safe at home  
And it go  
  
Im a paled unverified  
Im in your sleep  
I can rest  
But I could not sleep  
  
Broken vows  
That made it in heaven now  
Ironclad promises  
That you cant keep  
And you go
