You might see me down in Alabama  
Or Baton Rouge down in Louisiana  
I might make it up to Detroit City  
Where people work hard and life is gritty  
It dont really matter where I am  
Its what I do and what I can  
This old world has been good to me  
So I try to give back and I want to be free  
  
I was born in Ontario  
I was born in Ontario Ontario  
Ontario I was born in Ontario Ontario Ontario  
  
I still like to sing a happy song  
Once in a while when things go wrong  
I might pick up a pen scribble on a page  
Try to make sense of my inner rage  
One cold winter we went down south  
With daddys typewriter for a couple of months  
  
But I was born in Ontario Ontario  
I was born in Ontario Ontario  
Ontario I was born in Ontario Ontario Ontario  
  
I was born in Ontario  
Where the black fly bites  
And the green grass grows  
Thats where I learned most of what I know  
Cause you dont learn much when you start to get old  
I left home at a tender young age  
Mom and daddy never liked to stay  
In any one place for very long  
We just kept moving moving on  
  
But I was born in Ontario Ontario  
I was born in Ontario Ontario  
Ontario I was born in Ontario Ontario Ontario
