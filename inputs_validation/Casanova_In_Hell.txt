The girls perfection  
Inspires affection  
Its queer that here  
He cant cast his spell  
In her direction  
Somewhere near  
One senses fear  
Casanova in Hell  
  
The girl is naked  
The boy is naked  
He hides inside  
A secret chamber there to gape  
Through a velvet drape  
And dream of rape  
Casanova in Hell  
  
Her sharp suggestion  
He couldnt get an erection  
Came as a shock  
He finds himself  
A laughing stock  
His ageing fate  
To contemplate  
Casanova in Hell  
  
Back in the library  
His revenge is his story  
What he will write  
Will recall the bite  
Of his wit and legendary appetite  
The sybarite  
Casanova is well  
  
For Casanova has the last laugh  
Creates the myth and vindication  
Of his sexual vocation  
Makes the definitive collection  
His lives and lovers and above all  
His erection  
Will live in history
