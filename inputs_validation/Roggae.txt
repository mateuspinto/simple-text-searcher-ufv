The circus is the place for me with bears and clowns and noise  
I love the shiny music that descends from overhead  
Gordan knew the moment when the stars all turned around  
But from that vantage point I frowned  
  
If life were easy and not so fast  
I wouldnt think about the past  
I cant forget to turn the earth so both sides get their share  
Of darkness and of light  
  
So now I wander over grounds of light and heat and sound and mist  
Provoking dreams that dont exist  
A circus of light where dreams can take flight  
In the peacefulness dreaming dreams brings
