I met a shiek from Mozambique  
Who led me to the Congo  
He dreamed to go to Mexico  
And sample a burrito  
  
My temperature had risen again  
It must have been a hundred and ten  
  
Under the oaks I was telling some jokes  
And thinkin I had it made  
Gettin on with the folks havin some Coke  
And coolin off in the shade  
  
My temperature had risen again  
And it must have been a hundred and ten  
  
I took a boat that couldnt float  
To Rio de Janeiro  
So with my scuba I swam to Cuba  
But Ill be gone tomorrow  
  
My temperature had risen again  
It must have been a hundred and ten
