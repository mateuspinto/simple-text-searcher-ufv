From the Indian reservation to the governmental school  
Well theyre goin to educate me to the white mens Golden Rule  
And Im learning very quickly for Ive learned to be ashamed  
And I come when they call Billy though Ive got an Indian name  
And there are drums beyond the mountain Indian drums that you cant hear  
There are drums beyond the mountain and theyre getting mighty near  
And when they think that theyd changed me cut my hair to meet their needs  
Will they think Im white or Indian quarter blood or just half breed  
Let me tell you Mr teacher when you say youll make me right  
In five hundred years of fighting not one Indian turned white  
And there are drums  
Well you thought that I knew nothing when you brought me here to school  
Just another empty Indian just Americas first fool  
But now I can tell you stories that are burnt and dried and old  
But in the shadow of their telling walks the thunder proud and bold  
And there are drums  
Long Pine and Sequoia Handsome Lake and Sitting Bull  
Theres Magnus Colorado with his sleeves so red and full  
Crazy Horse the legend those who bit off Custers soul  
They are dead yet they are living with the great Geronimo  
And there are drums  
Well you may teach me this lands histry but we taught it to you first  
We broke your hearts and bent your journeys broken treaties left us cursed  
Even now you have to cheat us even though you this us tame  
In our losing we found proudness in your winning you found shame  
And there are drums
