Yeah my boyfriend takes me home when Im too drunk to drive  
And he doesnt get all jealous when I hang out with the guys  
He laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does  
He brings me mexican food from Sombreros just because  
Yeah just because  
  
And my boyfriend likes UL and DHC  
And hes so smart and independent I dont think he needs me  
Quite half as much as I know I need him  
I wonder why theres not another girl that hed prefer  
  
And when I feel like giving up  
Like my world is falling down  
  
I show up at 3am  
Hes still up watching Vacation and I  
See his pretty face  
It takes me away to a better place and  
  
I know that everything 3x Everythings gonna be fine  
I know that everything 3x Everythings gonna be fine  
  
Yeah my boyfriend takes collect calls from the road  
And it doesnt seem to matter that Im lacking in the bulge  
He laughs at my dumb jokes when no one does  
He brings me mexican food from Sombreros just because  
  
And when I feel like giving up  
Like my world is falling down  
  
I show up at 3am  
Hes still up watching Vacation and I  
See his pretty face  
It takes me away to a better place and  
  
I know that everything 3x Everythings gonna be fine  
I know that everything 3x Everythings gonna be fine  
I know that everything 3x Everythings gonna be fine  
I know that everything 3x Everythings gonna be fine  
  
I know that everything 3x Everythings gonna be fine  
I know that everything 3x Everythings gonna be fine  
I know that everything 3x Everythings gonna be fine  
I know that everything 3x Everythings gonna be fine
