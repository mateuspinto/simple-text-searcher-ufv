Verse  
I can see Jesus high and exalted  
My eyes are fixed upon His face  
It shines like the sun  
I can see Jesus clothed in glory  
He is high and lifted up  
And His train fills the temple  
  
PreChorus  
And all of the angels cry Holy  
All the saints cry Holy  
All creation cries Holy  
Holy is the Lamb  
  
Chorus  
All praise unto the Lamb Who sits on the throne  
Honor and power dominion and praise  
Unto the Lamb  
Who was and is  
And is to come  
  
Bridge  
Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
  
All Praise unto the Lamb Who sits on the throne  
Honor and power  
Dominion and praise  
Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Hallelujah
