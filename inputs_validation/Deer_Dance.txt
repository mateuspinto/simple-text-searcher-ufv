Circumventing circuses  
Lamenting in protest  
To visible police  
Presence sponsored fear  
  
Battalions of riot police  
With rubber bullet kisses  
Baton courtesy  
Service with a smile  
  
Beyond the Staples Center you can see America  
With its tired poor avenging disgrace  
Peaceful loving youth against the brutality  
Of plastic existence  
  
Pushing little children  
With their fully automatics  
They like to push the weak around  
Pushing little children  
With their fully automatics  
They like to push the weak around  
  
A rush of words  
Pleading to disperse  
Upon your naked walls alive  
A political call  
The fall guy accord  
We cant afford to be neutral on a moving train

Pushing little children  
With their fully automatics

Push them around  
A deer dance invitation to peace  
War staring you in the face dressed in black  
With a helmet fierce  
Trained and appropriate for the malcontents  
For the disproportioned malcontents  
  
The little boy smiled  
Itll all be well  
The little boy smiled  
Itll all be well
