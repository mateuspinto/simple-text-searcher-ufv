OK corral OK corral  
There the outlaw band make their final stand  
OK corral  
Oh my dearest one must die  
Lay down my gun or take the chance of losing you forever  
Duty calls  
My backs against the wall  
Have you no kind word to say  
Before I ride away  
Away  
  
Your love your love  
I need  
Your love  
  
Keep the flame let it burn  
Until I return  
From the gunfight at OK corral  
If the lord is my friend  
Well meet at the end  
  
Of the gunfight at OK corral  
Gunfight at OK corral  
Boot Hill Boot Hill  
So cold so still  
  
There they lay side by side  
The killers that died  
In the gunfight at OK corral  
OK corral  
Gunfight at OK corral
