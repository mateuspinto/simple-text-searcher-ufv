I was hellbent on destroying my powers of concentration  
While you were living like a saint  
And all the time the very one you trusted was washing off  
Somebody elses paint  
  
Now youve got yourself a brand new occupation  
Every fleeting thought is a pearl  
And beautiful people stampede to the doorway  
Of the funniest fucker in the world  
  
Theyre here to help you  
Satisfy your desire  
Theres a bright future for all you professional liars  
  
Chorus  
Now you know how to be dumb  
Are you ready to take your place in the modern museum of mistakes  
Dont you know how to be dumb  
Like a building thrown up overnight in one of those reverse earthquakes  
  
They emptied out all the asylums they emptied out all the jails  
The new bruise was the name of a dance craze  
By Jesus cross and the cruel nails  
Followed up by torturing little beaver  
With their contraption of barbed wire  
Between the fear and the fever lies all the rejection they require  
Theyll be howling by midnight theyll be drooling by dawn  
Skulls shrunk down to the size of their brains  
Heads shaven and shorn  
  
Chorus  
  
Trapped in the house of the perpetual sucker  
Where bitterness always ends so pitifully  
You always had to dress up your envy in some halfremembered  
Philosophy  
  
Now youre masquerading as pale powdered genius  
Whose ever bad intention has been purged  
You couldve walked out any time you wanted but face it you  
Didnt have the courage  
I guess that makes you a full time hypocrite or some kind of  
Twisted dilettante  
Funny though people dont usually get so ugly til they think  
They know what they want  
Scratch your own head stupid  
Count up to three  
Roll over on your back  
Repeat after me  
  
Dont you know how to be dumb  
Are you ready to take your place in the modern museum of mistakes  
Dont you know how to be dumb  
Like a building thrown up overnight in one of those reverse earthquakes
