The lord is my sheperd I shall not want  
He makes me lie down in green pastures  
He leads me beside the still waters  
He restoreth my soul  
And guides my path in righteousness  
For his names sake  
  
Surely goodness and loving kindness  
Shall follow me al the days of my life  
And I will dwell in the house of the lord  
Forever and ever and ever  
  
Though I walk through the valley  
Of the shadow of death  
I will not fear thou art with me  
Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me  
Thou preparest a table  
Before me in the presence of my enemies  
  
Thou anointest my head with oil  
My cups overflowing  
  
Surely goodness and loving kindness  
Shall follow me al the days of my life  
And I will dwell in the house of the lord  
Forever and ever and ever
