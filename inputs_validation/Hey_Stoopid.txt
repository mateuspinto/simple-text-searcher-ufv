Hey bro take it slow  
You aint livin in a video  
Youre flying low with a high velocity  
No doubt youre stressin out  
That aint what rock n rolls about  
Get off that one way trip down lonely street  
  
Now I know youve been kicked around  
You aint alone in this ugly town  
You stick a needle in your arm  
You bite the dust you buy the farm  
  
Hey hey hey hey hey stoopid  
What ya tryin to do  
Hey hey hey hey hey stoopid  
They win you lose  
Hey hey hey hey hey stoopid  
  
Cmon girl its a better day  
Get your foot out of that grave  
Dont let that one love tear your world apart  
Cmon babe kick that stuff  
Show the street it aint so tough  
Quit lyin around with a crippled broken heart  
  
Now I know youve been seeing red  
Dont put a pistol to your head  
Sometimes your answers heaven sent  
Your way is so damn permanent  
  
Hey hey hey hey hey stoopid  
What ya tryin to do  
Hey hey hey hey hey stoopid  
They win you lose  
Hey hye hey hey hey stoopid  
  
This aint your daddy talkin  
You know I know  
Your story aint so shocking  
You know I know  
Blow some steam  
Cmon and scream  
  
Hey hey hey hey hey stoopid  
What ya tryin to do  
Hey hey hey hey hey stoopid  
They win you lose  
Hey hye hey hey hey stoopid
