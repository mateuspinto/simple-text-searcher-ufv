Zero conversation words upon a page  
No communication no respect  
Zero but a world of words a war a simple rage  
Not worth the time to look in or dissect  
He said  
  
Wait Im not ready  
I wasnt really treated fair  
Wait Not in a hurry  
I want the time I wasted back when I thought no one cared  
  
Positively negative zero minus one  
He believes he believes in what he say  
A lifetime in a moment passes zero minus one  
Borrowed time borrow one more day  
  
Just enough to keep you down  
Up to zero  
Just enough to keep you down  
  
Just enough to keep you down  
Im up to zero  
Just enough to keep you down  
  
Wasted wanted needed feel  
When all is said and done  
Christened baptized spitting on the Son  
Stop it here one more deal  
A moment now to beg or steal  
A scrap of meat or one last meal  
Stop it here stop it here and  
  
Keep you down
