Today is none of our concern  
That rewarding cigarette  
That burns slowly by the bed  
Fills the room with mystery  
The apple ripens on the tree  
That protected seal of love  
Broken by the flame of fun  
Lying back with Exodus  
In the arms of lovers trust  
  
That romantic dance of light  
From the curtain broken night  
Shadows fall on mystery  
Love has ripened here for me  
Stubbing out the cigarette  
I see the clothes beside the bed  
As the half light of the day  
Pulls the sheet up once again  
  
As the phone hangs by the cord  
As the streets begin to fill  
Theres no distance anymore  
Theres no wanting when you will  
Will be sleeping through the day  
As the world around us turns  
As the phone hangs by the cord  
Today is none of our concern
