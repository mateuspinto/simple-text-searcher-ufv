If I share powdered milk with you  
I glue a picture to the chair  
Spit and butter from the plate that broke a week ago  
  
Gather Round  
Gather Round  
Gather Round  
  
A father scolds his little boy  
For trading secrets with a girl  
He turns and kicks the neighbors dog into the other yard  
  
Gather Round  
Gather Round  
Gather Round  
  
For Marys homeless people in the cardboard church  
Beneath the ramp fire is left for anyone to blame until  
  
Gather Round  
Gather Round  
Gather Round
