Adrian dont you understand  
Fools like us are always dreaming  
And when you go to bed  
And cover up your head  
Its better if you try to stop remembering  
  
And the world is slowly dawning  
To wake up to a new clear morning  
Some of them just half your age  
Get written off page by page  
  
Adrian dont you understand  
Fools like us are always dreaming  
And when you go to bed  
And cover up your head  
Its better if you try to stop remembering  
  
Some of them just half your age  
Get written off page by page  
And the world is softly sleeping  
While your fears are in their keeping  
  
All the planets making haste  
To blow to bits in outer space  
Adrian  dont you understand
