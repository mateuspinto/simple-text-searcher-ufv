The singing hills mmmmm  
Are singing tonight mmmmm  
  
And echoing a song of long ago  
The singing hills mmmmm  
  
Were singing that night mmmmm  
That lovely night you said I love you so  
The wind in the valley joined in our sweet refrain  
But now the wind and I  
Each night we cry Come back again  
  
Though you are gone mmmmm  
The song lingers on mmmmm  
  
Still echoing among the singing hills
