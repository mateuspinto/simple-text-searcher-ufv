Nichtern  
I never did sing you a love song  
I only sang phrases in time  
I never did write you a sonnet  
I just laid my WORDS down in rhymes  
Up and down the river so many boats to ride  
Yet precious few deliver the goods that we need to survive  
I never spoke falsely or crossly  
I never put tears in your eyes  
And you never shattered my lonely heart  
You never deceived me with lies  
And yet somehow I seem to recall I STIRRED in my sleep for a while  
Dreaming of a river man exchanging my life for a smile
