I never knew when you walked in the room  
I sold my soul to a stranger an angel face yea  
I never had this kind of sight before  
This kind of vision white hang on tight yea  
I dont know girl youve been around  
Dont you go dont you let me down  
  
One is such a lonely number to make the world go round  
Three is just a little too much to touch now honey to make the world go
round and round and round  
One is such a lonely number  
  
I think about what this has done to me  
Im going back to the start back to school days  
I never had this urge inside of me  
To hear the sound of a heart fill the airwaves  
Theres a love line its tied to the ground  
Leave you here never let you down  
  
One is such a lonely number to make the world go round  
Three is just a little too much to touch now honey to make the world go
round and round and round  
One is such a lonely number to mend a broken heart  
Three is just a little too much to touch hey honey to make the world go
round and round and round and round  
  
Theres a love line its tied to the ground Leave you here never let you
down  
One is such a lonely number to make the world go round  
Three is just a little too much to touch now honey to make the world go
round and round and round  
One is such a lonely number to mend a broken heart  
Three is just a little too much to touch hey honey to make the world go
round and round and round  
  
One is such a lonely number to make the world go round
