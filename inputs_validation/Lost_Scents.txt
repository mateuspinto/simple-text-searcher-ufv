Heading homeward home I cannot find oh love  
Heading home yet Im lost inside the night  
I may be strong but without you I may fall oh love  
Betrayed and lost now I cannot hear you call  
  
I will seek you longer  
Til your scent grows stronger  
  
Still I wish you here as Ive been  
Lost for a long long long time  
Lost in the rain  
Im growin so tired  
  
Still I wish you here as  
Im lost in the lone lone lone night  
Erasin me erasin my world  
  
The night is open a door I will not close to you  
I wait outside and long for a taste of home  
So call out louder than this wind may blow oh love  
Betrayed and lost now I feel my hunger grow  
  
I will seek you longer  
Til your scent grows stronger  
  
Still I wish you here as Ive been  
Lost for a long long long time  
Lost in the rain Im growin so tired  
  
Still I wish you here as Im  
Lost in the lone lone lone night  
Erasin me erasin my world  
  
I will seek you longer  
For you scent I hunger  
  
Come here come on  
Tonights open for you and I  
A night of tender petting  
Of doors open wide  
  
I need somebody to love  
I need somebody to love  
I need somebody to love  
I need somebody to love  
  
I need somebody to love  
Amore in mano al vento  
I need somebody to love  
Lost in the rain  
I need somebody to love  
Im growin so tired  
I need somebody to love  
  
I need somebody to love  
I need somebody to love  
I need somebody to love  
I need somebody to love  
  
I need somebody to love  
I need somebody to love  
I need somebody to love  
I need somebody to love  
  
I need somebody to love  
I need somebody to love
