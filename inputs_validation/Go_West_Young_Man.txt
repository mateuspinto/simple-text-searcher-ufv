Im blazing a trail that leads to vice  
So easily enticed  
By darker means  
When out of the wilderness of choice  
I hear that one still voice  
Call to me  
  
Chorus  
Go west young man  
Go west young man  
When the evil go east  
Go west young man  
Go west young man  
Find a heart thats golden  
  
Why must I wander like a cloud  
Following the crowd  
Well I dont know  
But Im asking for the will to fight  
To wear the crown of life  
And you say go  
  
Chorus  
  
The mind is weak the heart is frail  
When it goes beyond the pale  
So unwise  
  
Chorus
