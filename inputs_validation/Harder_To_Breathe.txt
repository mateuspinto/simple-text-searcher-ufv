Breathe in breathe out  
Ohh baby the trouble that I wanna get into  
Come sit with me baby come sit with me  
Looking at you baby Im curious about the way you move  
Come sit with me the way you move come sit with me  
  
Something bout you that I want so that I dont

So hard to breathe babay so hard to breathe
