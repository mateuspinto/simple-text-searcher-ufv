Want it  
You can have it  
Come and take it  
I dont need it  
Power and possessions  
Never quiet your obsessions  
  
Outside we search for something  
Inside we still have nothing  
People deep in trouble  
Let their money run for double  
Outside they search for something  
Inside they still have nothing  
It never ends  
  
Theres nothing I can do  
Theres nothing I can say  
And even if I could  
And even if I would  
It Never Goes Away  
Yeah  
  
Heartless rich and greedy  
Watch the churches rape the needy  
While we pray for salvation  
Preachers yield to temptation  
It never ends  
  
Theres nothing I can do  
Theres nothing I can say  
And even if I could  
And even if I would  
It Never Goes Away  
Theres nothing I can do  
Theres nothing I can say  
And even if I could  
And even if I would  
It Never Goes Away  
  
Blinded believers and doomsday deceivers  
Are driving you out of your head  
Look in the mirror the answer is near  
Though your sanity hangs by a thread  
  
Theres nothing I can do  
Theres nothing I can say  
And even I could  
And even I would  
It Never Goes Away  
Theres nothing I can do  
Theres nothing I can say  
And even if I could  
And even if I would  
It Never Goes Away
