The path is clear  
Though no eyes can see  
The course laid down long before  
And so with gods and men  
The sheep remain inside their pen  
Though many times theyve seen the way to leave  
  
He rides majestic  
Past hordes of men  
Who care not or gaze with joy  
To see reflected there  
The trees the sky the lily fair  
The scene of death is lying just below  
  
The mountain cuts off the town from view  
Like a cancer growth is removed by skill  
Let it be revealed  
A waterfall his madrigal  
An inland sea his symphony  
  
Undinal songs  
Urge the sailors on  
Till lured by sirens cry  
  
Now as the river dissolves in sea  
So Neptune has claimed another soul  
And so with gods and men  
The sheep remain inside their pen  
Until the shepherd leads his flock away  
  
The sands of time were eroded by  
The river of constant change
