Now is the time to make a stand  
To rise up and take the promised land  
To walk in the favour of our God  
  
Lift up your eyes to see the King  
Upon you His glory will be seen  
Cause His light is rising up on you  
  
Arise shine  
For the glory of the Lord is upon You  
  
Arise shine  
Shine His light  
  
I can feel something in the air  
  
The Spirit of God is surely here  
As the church rises up to Him  
  
The nations they come to sing His praise  
The lost are found running to His grace  
Cause His light is shining up on you  
  
Arise arise arise arise  
Church arise arise arise arise  
Church arise arise arise arise  
Church arise arise arise arise
