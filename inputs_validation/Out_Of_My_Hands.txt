Out on the window ledge I dont feel safe  
And I stayed looking down you  
  
Its out of my hands for now  
Its out of my hands for now  
I cant just walk away  
Itd be nice to walk away  
But I dont feel safe  
Get away all the way up here  
  
Its out of my hands for now  
Its out of my hands for now  
Oh it is down from here  
And down from here  
  
Start to feel insane betrayed  
Out on my window ledge  
  
And now our finest hour arrives  
See the pig dressed in his finest fine  
And all the believers stand behind him and smile  
As the day lights up with fire  
Let me in  
Let me in  
I stopped feeling crazy betrayed  
Out on my window ledge  
  
And now our finest hour arrives  
See the pig dressed in his finest fine  
And all the believers stand behind him and smile  
Watch the day lights up in fire  
Lookin down from here  
  
Its out of my hands for now  
Out on my window ledge  
Its out of my hands for now  
So let me in  
Let me in
