I dont want to be the kind to hesitate  
Be too shy wait to late  
I dont care what they say other lovers do  
I just want to dance with you  
I got a feeling that you have a heart like mine  
So let it show let it shine  
Oh if we have change to make one heart of two  
Then I just want to dance with you  
  
Chorus  
I want to dance with you  
Twirl you all around the floor  
Thats what they invented dancing for  
I just want to dance with you  
I want to dance with you  
Hold you in my arms once more  
Thats what they invented dancing for  
I just want to dance with you  
  
I caught you lookin at me when I looked at you  
Yes I did aint that true  
You wont get embarrassed by the things I do  
I just want to dance with you  
Oh the boys are playing softly and the girls are too  
So am I and so are you  
If this was a movie then were right on cue  
I just want to dance with you  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Ending  
I just want to dance with you  
I just want to dance with you  
I just want to dance with you
