Our Father which art in Heaven  
Hallowed be thy name  
Our Father which art in Heaven  
Hallowed be thy name  
  
Thy Kingdom come  
Thy Will be done  
On Earth as it is in Heaven  
  
Our Father which art in Heaven  
Hallowed be thy name  
Hallowed be thy name  
  
Our Father which art in Heaven  
Our Father  
Hallowed be thy name  
Hallowed be thy name  
  
Thy Kingdom come  
Thy Will be done  
On Earth as it is in Heaven  
  
Give us this day  
Our daily bread  
And forgive us our debts  
As we forgive our debtors  
  
Our Father which art in Heaven  
Hallowed be thy name  
  
Our Father which art in Heaven  
Hallowed be thy name  
  
And lead us not into temptation  
But deliver us deliver us from evil  
  
For Thine is the Kingdom and all the power  
And the glory  
Forever Amen  
  
Our Father which art in Heaven  
Hallowed be thy name  
Thy Kingdom come  
Thy Will be done  
On Earth as it is in Heaven
