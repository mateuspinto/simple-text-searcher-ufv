Hear the silent song  
A moment have come before this  
My heart so violently beats along  
Bleeding me to want to end it all  
  
I weep for the dream in a dream  
The one that made all lips go blue  
  
I read the words on torn down walls  
Reminding me how much I love you  
  
I weep for the dream in a dream  
The one that made all lips go blue  
I leave bleeding yet another day  
The one that made all lips go blue  
Its all for you  
Its all for you  
  
Weep for the dream in a dream  
The one that made all lips go blue  
I leave bleeding yet another day  
The one that made all lips go blue  
Its all for you  
Its all for you  
Its all for you
