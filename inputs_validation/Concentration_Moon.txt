Concentration moon  
Over the camp in the valley  
Concentration moon  
Wis I was back in the alley  
With all of my friends  
Still running free  
Hair growing out  
Every hole in me  
American way  
How did it start  
Thousands of creeps  
Killed in the park  
American way  
Try and explain  
Scab of a nation  
Driven insane  
Dont cry  
Gotta go bye bye  
Suddenly die die  
Cop kill a creep  
Pow pow pow  
  
Concentration moon  
Over the camp in the valley  
Concentration moon  
Wish I was back in the alley  
With all of my friends  
Still running free  
Hair growing out  
Every hole in me  
American way  
Threatened by us  
Drag a few creeps  
Away in a bus  
American way  
Prisoner lock  
Smash every creep  
In the face with a rock  
  
Dont cry  
Gotta go bye bye  
Suddenly die die  
Cop kill a creep  
Pow pow pow
