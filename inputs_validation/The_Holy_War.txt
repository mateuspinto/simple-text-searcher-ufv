If you will adore me  
Bow before me and praise my name  
If you place no god before me  
Then all I have is yours to claim  
  
And if God is in the heavens  
Why did God let children die  
If you dont ask these questions  
There is no reasons why  
  
Chorus  
We are chosen  
We are one  
We are frightened of no one  
And no one will win this war  
This is the way  
This is the law  
  
All the visions shown before you  
All the kingdoms and the thrones  
All are yours if you bow before me and adore me  
All this you can own  
  
There are those that will go to Heaven  
There are those that will never win  
No one knows what will happen  
There are those that turn to sin  
  
Chorus x2  
  
We are chosen  
  
The devil is in hell with the demons  
This is the Holy War  
  
They lead us to our temptation  
Lead us take our souls  
There is no evil in salvation  
There is evil in us all  
  
Just as Satan tempted Jesus  
And Jesus slips and falls  
He is a station on The Cross now  
He is dying to save us all  
  
Chorus x2  
  
We are chosen  
We are one  
We are frightened of no one  
And no one will win this war  
This is the way
