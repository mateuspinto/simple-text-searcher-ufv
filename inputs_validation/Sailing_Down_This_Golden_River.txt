Words and music by Pete Seeger  
Sailng down my golden river  
Sun and water all my own  
Yet I was never alone  
Sun and water old life givers  
Lll have them where ere I roam  
And I was not far from home  
Sunlight glancing on the water  
Life and death are all my own  
Yet I was never alone  
Life for all my sons and daughters  
Golden sparkles in the foam  
And I was not far from home  
Sailing down this winding highway  
Travelers from near and far  
And I was never alone  
Exploring all the little byways  
Sighting all the distant stars  
And I was not far from home  
Sailing down my golden river  
Sun and water all my own  
Yet I was never alone  
Sun and water old life givers  
Lll have them where ere I roam  
And I was not far from home  
Yet I was never alone  
And I was not far from home
