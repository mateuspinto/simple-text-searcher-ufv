Youre not the only one  
Amongst the saints and sinners  
There are those that we can see  
And those no longer with us  
To take that walk again  
With someone you were close to  
On stage in the other world tonight  
And there are many  
Who will say its speculation  
We need to focus on  
The sleeping generation  
The healing vision  
That extends beyond the pain  
Will take you there and back again  
I can remember  
You were no stranger  
As you came to me  
Dreamers walking  
And in that moment  
Between two worlds  
I saw the furthest star  
Exploding all around you  
And through the journey  
You spoke in silence  
And you made it clear  
Walk in peace now  
Then you touched me  
Revealing all upon your way  
Inside the burning fountain of timeOf time   
A time so real as the one  
We share each day  
The same dimension  
Just a heartbeat away  
In every part of you  
Theres so much exploration  
Out on the edge of space and time
