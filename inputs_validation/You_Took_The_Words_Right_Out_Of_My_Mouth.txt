Boy On a hot summer night would you offer your throat to the wolf with the
red roses  
Girl Yes  
Boy I bet you say that to all the boys  
  
It was a hot summer night and the beach was burning  
There was fog crawling over the sand  
Oh when i listen to your heart i hear the whole world turning  
I see the shooting stars falling through your trembling hands  
Oh you were licking your lips and your lipstick shining i was dying just to
ask for a taste  
oh we were lying together in a silver lining by the light of the moon you know
theres not another moment not another moment not another moment to waste  
Oh well you hold me so close that my knees grow weak  
and my soul is flying high above the ground  
Im trying to speak but no matter what i do  
I just cant seem to make any sound  
  
And then you took the words right out of my mouth  
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me  
You took the words right out of my mouth  
Oh and i swear its true  
I was just about to say i love you  
  
Now my body is shaking like a wave on the water and i guess that Im beginning
to grin  
oh were finally alone and we can do what we wanna  
oh the night is young  
and noones gonna no where you  
noones gonna know where you  
Noones gonna know where youve been  
  
Oh you were licking your lips and your lipstick shining i was dying just to
ask for a taste  
oh we were lying together in a silver lining by the light of the moon you know
theres not another moment to waste  
  
And then you took the words right out of my mouth  
Oh it must have been while you were kissing me  
You took the words right out of my mouth  
Oh and i swear its true  
I was just about to say i love you
