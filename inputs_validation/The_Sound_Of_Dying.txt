Listen up now  
Got a fistful of reason  
And a faceful of fear  
That I wear with a frown  
As the killer does bow  
Time will allow  
As I pass through the season  
And it all comes clear that  
The killer I see  
Is the most I fear  
Is the killer in me  
  
Take me where I got to go  
Show me what I need to know  
Where I got to go  
Here it comes now  
  
Chorus  
The sound you hear  
Crystal clear  
Is the sound of fear  
The sound of dying dying  
  
Right to a fault  
Methodic perfection  
Theres a road to the left  
That I walk to see  
Does the killer know me  
Come into the vault  
With a daily rejection  
And on though the tears  
That the killer I see  
Is the most I fear  
Is the killer in me  
  
Take me where I got to go  
Show me what I need to know  
Where I got to go  
Here it comes now  
  
Chorus  
  
Just for killing  
Just got to move me  
Just in time  
Because someone better kill me  
Dumb and willing  
Just enough to lose me  
Killer comes calling  
On a misty night in Jersey  
Will you let him in  
Will you be his friend  
Will you take him to the place  
Where you want it to end  
Killer comes killin  
On a misty night in Jersey  
Hear the sound of dying  
  
Listen up now  
Got a fistful of reason  
And a faceful of fear  
That I wear with a frown  
As the killer does bow  
Time will allow  
As I pass through the season  
And it all comes clear that  
The killer I see  
Is the most I fear  
Is the killer in me  
  
Take me where I got to go  
Show me what I need to know  
Where I got to go  
Here it comes now  
  
Chorus
