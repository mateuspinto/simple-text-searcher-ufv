Seen the carnival at Rome  
Had the women I had the booze  
All I can remember now  
Is little kids without no shoes  
So I saw that train And I got on it with a heartful of hate  
And a lust for vomit  
  
Now Im walking on the sunny side of the street  
Stepped over bodies in Bombay  
Tried to make it to the USA  
Ended up in Nepal  
Up on the roof with nothing at all  
And I knew that day I was going to stay  
  
Right where I am on the sunny side of the street  
Been in a palace been in a jail  
I just dont want to be reborn a snail  
Just want to spend eternity  
  
Right where I am on the sunny side of the street  
As my mother wept it was then I swore  
To take my life as I would a whore  
I know Im better than before  
I will not be reconstructed  
  
Just want to stay right here on the sunny side of the street  
On the sunny side of the street
