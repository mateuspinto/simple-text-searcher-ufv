Exercise the demon that is living up inside you  
After all you think youve been through just what have you been through  
Try to get beside yourself this tearing at your insides  
If you end up on the wrong side always standing so strong  
  
Sharpen up your teeth your dreams are more than worth defending  
In a fight thats never ending  
Go on go ahead and prove me wrong  
  
The further you go  
The less you know  
Youre born to quit youve blown it youve blown it  
You need to let go of letting go  
Youre full of shit youre born to quit  
  
Something supernatural it seems it could possess you  
No melevalance about you yeah that might not be true might not be true  
How they kept you demonized the fucked up situation  
How youve killed off all the angels taking notice of you  
  
Sharpen up your teeth your dreams are more than worth defending  
In a fight thats never ending  
Go on go ahead and prove me wrong  
  
The further you go  
The less you know  
Youre born to quit youve blown it youve blown it  
You need to let go of letting go  
Youre full of shit youre born to quit  
  
Youve blown it  
Youre born to quit  
  
Sharpe up your teeth your dreams are more than worth defending  
In a fight thats never ending  
GO on go ahead and prove me wrong  
  
The further you go  
The less you know  
Youre born to quit youve blown it youve blown it  
You need to let go of letting go  
Youre full of shit youre born to quit  
  
Youve blown it  
Youre born to quit  
Youve blown it
