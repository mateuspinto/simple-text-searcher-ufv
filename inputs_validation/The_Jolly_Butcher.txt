CHORUS  
Oh wont you come along with me love  
Come along with me  
Come for one night and be my wife  
And come along with me  
Well it is of the jolly butcher as you might plainly see  
As he roved out one morning in search of company  
He went into a tavern and a fair girl he did see  
Ah come for one night be my wife oh come along with me  
He called for liquor of the best  
And he makes such fortune play  
Come have a drink it will make us think  
That it is our wedding day  
CHORUS  
Well he called for a candle to light their way to bed  
And when he had her in the room these words to her he said  
A sovereign I will give to you for to embrace your charms  
And all that night that fair young maid lied in the butchers arms  
CHORUS  
Oh Early the next morning be sure it went his way  
He looked unto that fair young maid and unto her did say  
That sovereign that I gave to you do not think me strange  
Well that sovereign that I gave to you will you give me back me change  
CHORUS  
Well about a 12 months later he roved out once more  
And he went into the tavern where hed often been before  
He wasnt in there very long when his fair maid he did see  
And she brought forth a baby three months old and placed it on his knee  
When he saw the baby he began to curse and swear  
And he said unto that fair young maid Why did you bring him here  
Well he is your own kind sir she said Do not think me strange  
Well that sovereign that you gave to me I gives you back your change
