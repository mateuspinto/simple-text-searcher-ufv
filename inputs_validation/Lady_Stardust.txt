People stared at the makeup on his face  
Laughed at his long black hair his animal grace  
The boy in the bright blue jeans  
Jumped up on the stage  
And lady stardust sang his songs  
Of darkness and disgrace  
  
And he was alright the band was altogether  
Yes he was alright the song went on forever  
And he was awful nice  
Really quite out of sight  
  
And he sang all night long  
Femme fatales emerged from shadows  
To watch this creature fair  
Boys stood upon their chairs  
To make their point of view  
I smiled sadly for a love  
I could not obey  
Lady stardust sang his songs  
Of darkness and dismay  
  
And he was alright the band was altogether  
Yes he was alright the song went on forever  
And he was awful nice  
Really quite paradise  
  
Oh how I sighed when they asked if I knew his name  
  
And he was alright the band was altogether  
Yes he was alright the song went on forever  
And he was awful nice  
Really quite out of sight
