Heartache number one was when you left me  
I never knew that I could hurt this way  
And heartache number two was when you came back again  
You came back and never meant to stay  
  
Now Ive got heartaches by the number troubles by the score  
Every day you love me less  
Each day I love you more  
  
Yes Ive got heartaches by the number a love that I cant win  
But the day that Ill stop counting  
Thats the day my world would end  
  
Heartache number three was when you called me  
And said that you were coming back to stay  
With hopeful heart I waited for your knock on the door  
I waited but you must have lost your way  
  
Now Ive got heartaches by the number  
And the day that Ill stop counting  
Thats the day my world will end
