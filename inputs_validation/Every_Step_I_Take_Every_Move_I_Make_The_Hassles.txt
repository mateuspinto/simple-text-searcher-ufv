Everything I do  
Im thinking thoughts of only you girl  
Everywhere I go  
Dreams of you will always follow  
  
Every step I take every move I make  
Im trying to spend my life without you  
I turn I run I hide but I know deep inside  
A part of me has died yeah yeah  
  
I closed my eyes and see  
A picture of your face before me  
Upon my lips I feel  
A tender kiss youre almost real  
  
Every step I take every move I make  
Im trying to spend my life without you  
I turn I run I hide but I know deep inside  
A part of me has died yeah yeah
