Oh God said to Abraham Kill me a son  
Abe said Man you must be puttin me on  
God said No Abe say What  
God say You can do what you want Abe but  
The next time you see me comin you better run  
Well Abe said Where dyou want this killin done  
God said Out on Highway 61  
  
Well Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose  
Welfare department they wouldnt give him no clothes  
He asked poor Howard Where can I go  
Howard said Theres only one place I know  
Sam said Tell me quick man I got to run  
Oh Howard just pointed with his gun  
And said That way down Highway 61  
  
Well Mack the Finger said to Louie the King  
I got forty redwhiteandblue shoestrings  
And a thousand telephones that dont ring  
Do you know where I can get rid of these things  
And Louie the King said Let me think for a minute son  
Then he said Yes I think it can be easily done  
Just take everything down to Highway 61  
  
Now the fifth daughter on the twelfth night  
Told the first father that things werent right  
My complexion she says is much too white  
He said Come here and step into the light  
He said Hmm youre right let me tell the second mother this has been done  
But the second mother was with the seventh son  
And they were both out on Highway 61  
  
Now the roving gambler he was very bored  
Trying to create a next world war  
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor  
He said I never engaged in this kind of thing before  
But yes I think it can be very easily done  
Well just put some bleachers out in the sun  
And have it on Highway 61
