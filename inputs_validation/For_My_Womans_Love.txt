Like the first apartment that we had  
That bumpy little couch that made into a bed  
The shower down the hall and footsteps overhead  
She said Its just fine  
  
Times were hard for us for quite awhile  
But through those hungry days she faced it with a smile  
Not wanting me to know shes carrying my child  
She tried to ease my mind  
  
And for my womans love  
For my womans love  
Each day I thank the Lord above  
For my sweet womans love  
  
Through the years of moving town to town  
Still searching for a dream somehow we never found  
And wondering if we would ever settle down  
Her love never died  
  
And if I am anything today I owe it to the love I had along the way  
No matter what went wrong  
No matter come what may  
She stood by my side  
  
And for my womans love  
For my womans love  
Each day I thank the Lord above  
For my sweet womans love  
  
And for my womans love  
For my womans love  
Each day I thank the Lord above  
For my sweet womans love
