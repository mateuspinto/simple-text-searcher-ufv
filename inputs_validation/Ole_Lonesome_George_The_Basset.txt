Ole lonesome George the basset lived in Brentwood Tennessee  
And even though he had his faults he was a sight to see  
He taught the show dog puppies to always try and please  
To hold their heads and tails up and not wet the judges knees  
Ole George was not a champion but his owners loved him so  
They drived the car to the dogshows ole George would get the dough  
But when hed get out in the rain he never could win first  
Several judges shook their heads and said he was the worst  
Then one day the kannel keeper got an urgent call  
From the local TV to Mr Tom T Hall  
They said Johnny Cash is puttin on the show tonight  
He says he needs a basset youve got one aint that right  
Lonesome George went to the show and he did everything  
He barked and growled and jumped around and made the rappers ring  
Hed left the people cheering for another curtain call  
And so ole lonesome George became the show dog after all mhm
