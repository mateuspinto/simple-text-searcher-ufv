A cigarette that bears a lipsticks traces  
An airline ticket to romantic places  
And still my heart has wings  
These foolish things remind me of you  
  
A tinkling piano in the next apartment  
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant  
A fairgrounds painted swing  
These foolish things remind me of you  
  
I know that this was bound to be  
These things have haunted me  
For you my dear enchanted me  
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer  
A telephone that ring but whose to answer  
Oh how the ghost of you clings  
These foolish things remind me of you  
  
The smile of Garbo  
And the scent of roses  
The waiters whistlin as the last bar closes  
The songs that Crosby sings  
These foolish things remind me of you  
  
Babe these things remind me of you
