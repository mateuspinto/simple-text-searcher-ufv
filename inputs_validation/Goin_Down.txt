Goin down  
Goin down down down down down  
Goin down  
Goin down down down down down  
Ive got my big feet in the window  
My head is on the ground  
Take me down  
You know I crawled across the floor  
Take me down  
Crawled across the floor  
Back to Chatanooga to see my sister once more  
Come on take me down  
Goin down  
Goin down down down down down  
Goin down  
Goin down down down down down down down  
Ive got my big feet in the window  
My head is on the ground  
Come on come on take me down  
Im goin down
