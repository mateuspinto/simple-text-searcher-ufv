Babes in the wood walking through snow  
Big bad wolf at the window  
Not much choice in the matter now  
Some must lead some must follow  
  
Touch can mean distance to some people  
Touch can mean prison or be like a cage  
I always thought that life could be more simple  
Specially in this day and age  
  
Babes in the wood walking through snow  
Big bad wolf at the window  
Not much choice in the matter now  
Some must lead some must follow  
  
They got the time they got the need  
The worlds getting weird the wolfs running free  
But thats another story this their story  
  
Babes in the wood eager and keen  
Soft as the fern underneath them  
Wet to the skin from their own hot glow  
No more wolf at the window  
  
Touch can mean distance to some people  
Touch can mean I own you forever and a day  
If only life could be more simple  
Specially in this day and age  
  
Babes in the wood walking through snow  
Big bad wolf at the window  
Not much choice in the matter now  
Some must lead some must follow  
  
But touch can be a blessing to other people  
Touch can bring blossom to things that decay  
I think life should be that simple  
Specially in this day and age  
  
Babes in the wood walking through snow  
Big bad wolf at the window  
Not much choice in the matter now  
Some must lead some must follow
