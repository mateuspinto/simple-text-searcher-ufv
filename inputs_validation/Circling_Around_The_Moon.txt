There may come a day when you grow weary  
Troubled waters stain the paper cup  
From other venues other voices carry  
Spilled dreams soaking into thirsty dust  
Maybe then and there youll find another  
Lover with a blank and empty heart  
Filled with breath and old cells to discover  
Strength to push the seas apart  
On the day we met I began to want you  
On the day we met I began to lose you too  
Both of us circling around the moon  
Both of us circling around the moon  
There may come a day when you feel anger  
China cracked and glued by clumsy hand  
Veins of memory touching only hunger  
The heart devours what it cannot understand  
On the day we metI began to want you  
On the day we met I began to lose you too  
Both of us circling around the moon  
Both of us circling around the moon  
Maybe it was then I saw my future  
Saw it as a shadow on the ground  
Beneath the earth old nails  
To discover strength to hold my body down  
On the day we met I began to want you  
On the day we met I began to lose you too  
Both of us circling aroundthe moon  
On the day we met I began to want you want you  
On the day we metI began to lose you too  
Both of us circling around the moon  
Both of us circling around the moon  
Both of us circling around the moon
