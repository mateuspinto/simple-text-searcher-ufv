It was one of those days  
When to shine was of no value  
One of those days  
When the language had no grace  
We were miles apart  
And I stood there with my head spinning  
Just another poor soul  
Trying hard not to lose faith  
We had it engraved  
We had the key to a union  
But you wanted more  
So we both kept on losing  
Fat valley of pain  
Fat valley of pain inside  
And this pain will not end  
cause loving you is what I was made for  
You were like one of those rainbows  
We glimpse for a few seconds  
One of those dreams  
That could last for a life long  
Now Im quizzing myself  
And its always the same question  
Is it wrong to believe  
When the feeling so so strong  
We had engraved  
We had the key to a union  
But you wanted more  
So we both kept on losing  
Its an illkept secret  
That something heres going wrong  
Oh but my helpless feelings  
They keep on leading me on  
Fat valley of pain  
Fat valley of pain inside  
And this pain will not end  
cause loving you is what I was made for  
Fat valley of pain
