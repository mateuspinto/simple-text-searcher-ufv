Youve got her in your pocket  
And there is no way out now  
Put it in the safe and lock it  
Cause its home sweet home  
  
Nobody ever told you that it was the wrong way  
To trick a woman make her feel she did it her way  
And youll be there if she ever feels blue  
And youll be there when she finds someone new  
What to do  
Well you know  
  
You keep her in your pocket  
Where theres no way out now  
Put it in the safe and lock it  
Cause its home sweet home  
  
The smile on your face made her  
Think  
She had the right one  
Then she thought she was sure  
By the way you two could have fun  
But now youre scared  
You think shes running away  
You search in you hand for something clever to say  
Dont go away  
Cause I want  
  
To keep you in my pocket  
Where theres no way out now  
Put it in the safe and lock it  
Cause its home sweet home  
  
And in your own mind  
You know youre lucky just to know her  
And in the beginning all you wanted  
Was to show her  
But now she might leave  
Like shes threatened before  
Grab hold of her fast  
Before her feet leave the floor  
And shes out the door  
Cause you want  
  
To keep her in your pocket
