Kansas City Kansas City here I come Kansas City Kansas City here I come  
Got some pretty little women there Im gonna get me one  
Standing on the corner crawl straight in my hand  
With my Kansas City Baby now by the Kansas City world  
Well the water in the city well taste like Georgia Pie  
Going to Kansas City where it tastes like sugar oh I know it  
Kansas City Kansas City here I come  
Got some pretty little women there Im gonna get me one  
Kansas City here every night you gave me none  
Kansas City surely looked like they were done  
You know they turned it around now Baby gonna scratch it gonna run  
And rock with my Baby rock with my Baby one more time  
Rock with my Baby Kansas City Baby one more time  
Went to the city for for this souvenir in my hand  
Well I might take a plane might take a train  
If I have to walk you wont grind in the same  
Oh Kansas City Kansas City here I come  
Got some crazy little women there Im gonna get mo one
