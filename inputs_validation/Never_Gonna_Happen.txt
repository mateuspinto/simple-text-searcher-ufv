You might as well quit while your at it  
You aint going no where  
I feel so hollow inside  
And it s all your fault  
You re the cause of all this pain  
Now I m left here dying  
  
You think you can beat me  
It s never gonna happen  
You wanna reach the end  
It s never gonna happen  
Do what you wanna do  
It aint gonna happen  
  
I wont let you do this  
Not anymore  
Ur so vindictive  
You always have been  
I regret the day I met you I saw you  
Now you don t even remember me  
I m just the voice in your head  
Screaming crying  
And telling you  
  
That it aint gonna happen
