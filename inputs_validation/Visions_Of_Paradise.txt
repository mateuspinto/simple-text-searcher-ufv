The sounds in my mind just come to me  
Come see come see  
And the call of her eyes makes waterfalls  
Of me of me  
  
In the garden of her love Ill stay awhile  
To be to be  
What the seeds of her thoughts once mean to me  
Come see come see  
  
Visions of paradise cloudless skies I see  
Rainbows on the hill blue onyx on the sea  
Come see ah ah ah  
  
And the sounds in my mind just come to me  
Come see come see  
And the call of her eyes makes waterfalls  
Of me of me
