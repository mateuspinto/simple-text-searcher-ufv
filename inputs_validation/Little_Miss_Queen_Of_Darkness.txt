Well I met her accidentally  
In a little discotheque  
And she acted oh so friendly  
To every fella that she met  
And her hair was hanging down  
Like a bright and silver machine  
Little Miss Queen of Darkness  
Dancing night and day  
Little Miss Queen of Darkness  
Dancing dancing on  
Although she looked so happy  
There was sadness in her eyes  
And her curly false eyelashes  
Werent much of a disguise  
And her bright and golden hair  
Was not all that it might seem  
Little Miss Queen of Darkness  
Dances sadly on  
Yes Little Miss Queen of Darkness  
Dancing dancing on  
There was something missing  
From her carefree little life  
And shell never understand you  
When youre kissing her good night  
Cause the only boy she had  
Went and coolly stepped aside  
And Little Miss Queen of Darkness  
Might as well have died  
Little Miss Queen of Darkness  
Dancing dancing on
