Trembling  
Starry eyed  
As you put your hand in mine  
  
It was twilight  
On the Fourth of July  
Sparkling colors were  
Strewn across the sky  
And we sat close enough  
That we just barely touched  
While roman candles  
Went soaring above us and baby  
  
Then you put your hand in mine  
And we wandered away  
I was trembling inside  
But I wanted to stay  
Pressed against you there and leave the world behind  
On that Fourth of July  
  
So starry eyed  
On the flowery hillside  
Breathless and fervid  
Amid the dandelions  
As it swept over me  
Like the wind trough the trees  
I felt you sigh with a  
Sweet intensity and baby  
  
Then you put your hand in mine  
And we floated away  
Delicately lay entwined  
In an intimate daze  
A crescent moon began to shine  
And I wanted to stay  
Tangled up with you among the fireflies  
On that Fourth of July  
  
Thunder clouds  
Hung around  
So threateningly  
Ominously hovering  
And the sky  
Opened wide  
Showering  
  
Then you put your hand in mine  
And we ran from the rain  
Tentatively kissed goodnight  
And went our separate ways  
And Ive never truly felt the way that I  
Felt the Fourth of July  
  
Truly I have never felt the same inside  
Like that Fourth of July  
Truly I could never feel the same as I  
Felt that Fourth of July
