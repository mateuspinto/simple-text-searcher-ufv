I used to trust nobody trusting even less their words  
Until I found somebody there was no one I preferred  
My heart was made of stone my eyes saw only misty grey  
Until you came into my life girl I saw everyone that way  
Until I found the one I needed at my side  
I think I would have been a sad man all my life  
  
I think I see the light coming to me  
Coming through me giving me a second sight  
So shine shine shine  
Shine shine shine  
Shine shine shine  
  
I used to walk alone every step seemed the same  
This world was not my home so there was nothing much to gain  
Look up and see the clouds look down and see the cold floor  
Until you came into my life girl I saw nothing nothing more  
Until I found the one I needed at my side  
I think I would have been a sad man all my life  
  
I think I see the light coming to me  
Coming through me giving me a second sight  
So shine shine shine  
Shine shine shine  
Shine shine shine
