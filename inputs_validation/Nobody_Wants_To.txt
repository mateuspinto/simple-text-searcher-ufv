Down on the ocean floor  
Thats where Im heading for  
Hold on to a sinking stone  
Until the worst is known  
  
Nobody wants to  
Think about it  
Nobody wants to  
Talk about it  
Nobody protects you  
  
They make it go away  
Pretending that its all okay  
Broken pieces on the ground  
And everyones tiptoeing round  
  
Nobody wants to  
Think about it  
Nobody wants to  
Talk about it  
No one protects you yeah  
  
And were losing some faith  
We used to cry  
We used to say why  
For all I know  
I might not get home  
But I found out  
If we opened it up we could work this out  
  
Nobody wants to  
Think about it  
Nobody wants to  
Talk about it now  
  
What you suspected all along  
Everything he told you was wrong  
And you can see it if you want  
But nobody wants to
