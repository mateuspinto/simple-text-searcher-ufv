Shes lookin for a job and a finer place to stay  
Shes lookin for the hope in the empty promising  
Shes workin two jobs keepin alive  
She works in a restaurant night and day  
She waits her life away  
She wipes the tears away  
  
She cries inside every time she feels this way  
And shes dying inside every time her baby cries no  
  
Keepin your head up to the sky  
Keepin your mind up stay alive  
Gimme your wings so we can fly  
Keep your head up tonight  
  
Keepin your head up to the sky  
And we can just rise up tell me now  
Gimme your wings so we can fly  
  
Giving up the life in the birds in the trees  
And were sucking up the air in the earth from under me  
Its never too late  
I cant even breathe to see I cant even see  
Oh keep Keep your head up dont give up today  
How long can we wait  
I wish that love would come today

And all you need is just a moment wont it do  
Keep your head up  
  
Keepin your head up to the sky  
Keepin your mind to stay alive  
Gimme your wings so we can fly

Keep your head up tonight  
  
Keepin your head up to the sky  
And we can just rise up tell me now  
Gimme your wings so we can fly  
Oh why  
  
Everybody say the time is borrowed  
And hanging down your head just aint no good  
And if you dance and rise above tomorrow  
Give it a chance  
Just give yourself a chance  
Find the circumstance  
Rise and do it again
