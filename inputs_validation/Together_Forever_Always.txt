Life can be distance between us  
Days even years could pass on  
But the love that lies between us will  
Always be worth holdin on  
  
Together forever always  
From the dawn til the end  
Of each day no matter  
How far away you are were  
Together forever always  
  
I could try to forget you but the  
Memories keep lingering on  
But the dreams I dream about  
You keep me holdin on  
  
Together forever always  
From the dawn til the end  
Of each day no matter  
How far away you are were  
Together forever always  
  
Together forever always  
From the dawn til the end  
Of each day no matter  
How far away you are were  
Together forever always
