Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now  
Our song on the radio but it doesnt sound the same  
When our friends talk about you all it does is just tear me down  
Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name  
  
It all just sounds like ooh ooh ooh hoo hoo  
Mm too young too dumb to realize  
That I should have bought you flowers  
And held your hand  
Should have given you all my hours  
When I had the chance  
Take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance  
  
Now my babys dancing  
But shes dancing with another man  
  
My pride my ego my needs and my selfish ways  
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life  
Now I never never get to clean up the mess I made oh  
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes  
  
It all just sounds like ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Mm too young too dumb to realize  
That I should have bought you flowers  
And held your hand  
Should have given you all my hours  
When I had the chance  
Take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance  
  
Now my babys dancing  
But shes dancing with another man  
  
Although it hurts  
Ill be the first to say that I was wrong  
Oh I know Im probably much too late  
To try and apologize for my mistakes  
But I just want you to know  
  
I hope he buys you flowers  
I hope he holds your hand  
Give you all his hours  
When he has the chance  
Take you to every party  
Cause I remember how much you loved to dance  
Do all the things I should have done  
When I was your man  
Do all the things I should have done  
When I was your man
