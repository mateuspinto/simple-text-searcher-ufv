I dont wanna look for words  
I dont wanna work that hard  
I want your song in my head  
The way you sing it from the heart yeah  
  
Whenever I get lost  
Whenever I feel weak  
Whenever or just because  
You whisper it to me  
  
Honey maybe everything you need  
Is on the other side of this feeling  
Honey please  
  
But when I look for words  
For more going concerns  
For the adventure of ideas  
Adventure never returns yeah  
  
Whenever I get stuck  
Whenever I cant speak  
Whenever just because  
You do it in your sleep  
  
Honey maybe everything you need  
Is on the other side of this feeling  
Honey please  
  
When all the poetry of the earth  
Might be all there is  
It might still have some worth  
Yeah but I cant dance to it  
  
Honey everything we need  
Is on the other side of this feeling  
This feeling  
  
Honey right here underneath our feet  
Under all the stars of the County  
Everything we need  
Honey please  
  
Under all the stars of the County with you tonight  
Under all the stars of the County with you by my side  
Under all the stars of the County shining bright  
Under all the stars of the County with you tonight
