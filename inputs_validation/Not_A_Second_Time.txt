You know you made me cry  
I see no use in wondering why  
I cry for you  
  
And now youve changed your mind  
I see no reason to change mine  
I cry its through oh  
  
Youre giving me the same old line  
Im wondering why  
You hurt me then  
Youre back again  
No no no not a second time  
  
You know you made me cry  
I see no use in wondering why  
I cry for you yea  
  
And now youve changed your mind  
I see no reason to change mine  
I cry its through oh  
  
Youre giving me the same old line  
Im wondering why  
You hurt me then  
Youre back again  
No no no not a second time  
Not a second time  
Not the second time  
No no no no no  
No no no
