I thought that youd be loving me  
I thought you were the one whod stay forever  
But now forever has come and gone  
And Im still here alone  
Cause you were only playing  
You were only playing with my heart  
I was never waiting  
I was never waiting for the tears to start  
  
It was you who put the clouds around me  
It was you who made the tears fall down  
It was you who broke my heart in pieces  
It was it was you who made my blue eyes blue  
  
Oh I never shouldve trusted you  
  
I thought that Id be all you need  
In your eyes I thought I saw my heaven  
And now my heavens gone away  
And Im out in the cold  
Cause you had me believing  
You had me believing in a lie  
Guess I couldnt see it  
Guess I couldnt see it til I saw Goodbye  
  
It was you who put the clouds around me  
It was you who made the tears fall down  
It was you who broke my heart in pieces  
It was it was you who made my blue eyes blue  
  
Oh I never shouldve trusted you  
  
Cause you were only playing  
You were only playing with my heart  
I was never waiting I was never waiting for the tears to start  
  
It was you who put the clouds around me  
It was you who it was you who put those clouds around me  
It was you who made the tears fall down  
Only you who broke my heart in pieces  
It was you it was you who made my blue eyes blue  
  
Oh I never shouldve trusted you Repeat x4
