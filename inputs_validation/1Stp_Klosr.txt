Im about to break  
I need a little room to breathe  
Cause Im one step closer to the edge  
And Im about to break  
  
Im about to break  
This room to breathe  
This room to breathe  
This room to breathe  
  
I cannot take this anymore  
Saying everything Ive said before  
All these words they make no sense  
I found bliss in ignorance  
Less I hear the less you say  
Youll find that out anyway  
I find the answers arent so clear  
Wish I could find a way to disappear  
All these thoughts they make no sense  
I found bliss in ignorance  
Nothing seems to go away  
Over and over again  
Just like before  
  
Everything you say to me  
And Im about to break  
I need a little room to breathe  
And Im about to break  
  
Everything you say to me  
And Im about to break  
I need a little room to breathe  
And Im about to break  
  
These are the places where I can feel torn from my body  
My flesh it peels during this ride we can cut upwhat we like  
Im about to break  
Waiting alone I cannot resist  
Feeling this hate I have never missed  
Please someone give me a reason to rip off my face  
Blood is a pouring  
And pouring  
And pouring  
And pouring  
And pouring  
And pouring  
And pouring  
And pouring  
And pouring  
And pouring  
  
Shut up when Im talking to you  
Shut up  
Blood is pouring  
Shut up  
Blood is pouring  
Shut up  
Blood is pouring  
Shut up when Im talking to you  
Shut up  
Blood is pouring  
Shut up  
Blood is pouring  
Shut up  
Blood is pouring  
Shut up  
Im about to break  
  
Everything you say to me  
And Im about to break  
I need a little room to breathe  
And Im about to break  
  
Everything you say to me  
And Im about to break  
I need a little room to breathe  
And Im about to  
  
Everything you say to me  
Takes me one step closer to the edge  
And Im about to break  
I need a little room to breathe  
Cause Im one step closer to the edge  
And Im about to break  
  
Everything you say to me  
Takes me one step closer to the edge  
And Im about to break  
I need a little room to breathe  
Cause Im one step closer to the edge  
And Im about to
