Streetlight  
Yellow in the room  
Lifting out our futures from the gloom  
Same song  
In the street below  
Football song that everybody knows  
  
Chorus  
Thats when he told her  
That he loved her  
And hed love her all his life  
And hed love her all his life  
  
Bright lights  
Five years down the lane  
Point to where  
The just born babies cry  
He knows now  
They are joined for good  
Life could never break them  
Nothing could  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Thirty years pass  
Like a sonic boom  
Sunlight floods  
Into a different room  
They both know theyre saying  
Goodbye too soon  
But theres no more time  
  
Chorus  
  
Thats when he told her  
That he meant it  
When he said he loved her  
And hed love her all his life
