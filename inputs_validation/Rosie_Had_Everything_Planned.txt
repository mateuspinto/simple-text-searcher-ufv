Acting upon information received  
Rosie had everything planned  
Stood in a garden with a shotgun in hand  
What a woman  
  
Whilst entertaining the headlines next day  
Rosie would not be released  
If it was found that her man was deceased  
Silly woman  
  
Oh but Rosie a girl with a strange kind of humor  
Stupidly took in a rumor  
Making her think that shed lost  
Doublecrossed by a man who was dear  
  
Stood in the garden and shaking her head  
Rosie could not understand  
Wiping her eyes with the back of her hand  
Sad sad woman  
  
Oh but Rosie how could a few words have made her  
Certain that he had betrayed her  
Making her think that shed lost  
Doublecrossed by a man who was still very near to her  
  
Row upon row of angel hair  
Rosie had everything planned  
Sure that the people would not understand  
Sad sad woman
