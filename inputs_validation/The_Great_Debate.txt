What if someone said  
Promise lies ahead  
Hopes are high in certain scientific circles  
Life wont have to end  
You could walk again  
  
What if someone said  
Problems lie ahead  
Theyve uncovered something highly controversial  
The right to life is strong  
Cant you see its wrong  
  
Human kind has reached a turning point  
Poised for conflict at ground zero  
Ready for a war  
Do we look to our unearthly guide  
Or to white coat heroes  
Searching for a cure  
  
Turn to the light  
Dont be frightened of the shadows it creates  
Turn to the light  
Turning away would be a terrible mistake  
  
Anarchistic moral vision  
Industries of death  
Facing violent opposition  
Unmolested breaths  
  
Ethic inquisitions breed  
Antagonistic views  
Right wing sound bite premonitions  
In a labyrinth of rules  
  
Are you justified  
Are you justified  
Are you justified  
Justified in taking  
Life to save life  
Life to save life  
Taking life to save life  
  
This embryonic clay  
Wrapped in fierce debate  
Would be thrown away  
Or otherwise discarded  
  
Some of us believe  
It may hold the key  
To treatment of disease  
And secrets highly guarded  
  
Are you justified  
Are you justified  
Are you justified  
Justified in taking  
Life to save life  
Life to save life  
Life to save life  
  
Human kind has reached a turning point  
Poised for conflict at ground zero  
Ready for a war  
Do we look to our unearthly guide  
Or to white coat heroes  
Searching for the cure  
  
Turn to the light  
Dont be frightened of the shadows it creates  
Turn to the light  
Turning away would be a terrible mistake  
  
Were reaching  
But have we gone too far  
  
Harvesting existence  
Only to destroy  
Carelessly together  
We are sliding  
  
Someone elses future  
Four days frozen still  
Someone elses fate  
We are deciding  
  
Miracle potential  
Sanctity of life  
Faced against each other  
Were divided  
  
Should we push the boundaries  
Or should we condemn  
Moral guilt and science  
Have collided  
  
Turn to the light  
We defy our own mortality these days  
Turn to the light  
Pay attention to the questions we have raised
