Oh my love why do you keep me waiting  
What my love are you contemplating  
Time goes by still you never bat an eye  
Tell me why my love do you have to stay far away  
Late at night while I lay asleepin  
Pale moonlight through my window weepin  
I see you in a color fantasy cover me  
Why my love do you have to fade away  
Have to fade away why my love wont you tell me  
Why my love do you keep me waiting why my love  
Are you hesitating time goes by are you waiting  
For another day tell me why you think  
Time will never fade away
