If I came back just a cripple from the war  
Would you hold me close just like you did before  
And what in the world would you do  
If I could not make love to you  
  
The question is not whether the freedom weve got  
Is worth the consequence of war  
The question is just can I hold you at dusk  
Without you asking me for more  
  
A postwar eunuch  
A lover that is lame  
Some famous hero and one shares his name  
But where in the world would I go  
Youre all that I love and all I know  
  
The question is plain  
Could our love still remain  
Without its carnal ecstasy  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
And who in the world would I be  
If I lose all of you and half of me  
  
Oh
