I took a drive today  
Time to emancipate  
I guess it was the beatings made me wise  
But Im not about to give thanks or apologize  
I couldnt breathe holdin me down  
Hand on my face pushed to the ground  
Enmity gaged united by fear  
Forced to endure what I could not forgive  
  
I seem to look away  
Wounds in the mirror waved  
It wasnt my surface most defiled  
Head at your feet fool to your crown  
Fist on my plate swallowed it down  
Enmity gaged united by fear  
Tried to endure what I could not forgive  
  
Saw things Repeat x4  
Clearer Repeat x2  
Once you were in my rearviewmirror  
  
I gather speed from you fucking with me  
Once and for all Im far away  
I hardly believe finally the shades are raised hey  
  
Saw things so much clearer  
Once you once you Repeat x3  
Rearviewmirror  
  
Saw things so much clearer  
Once you oh yeah
