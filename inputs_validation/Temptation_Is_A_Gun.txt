Like the hopeful dreams of many he had everything and more  
A lovely wife and children all the things worth fighting for  
He knows there was still still something missing in his life  
Though he promised to be faithful he was good at telling lies  
He had an eye for young girls he would steal some on the side  
Oh no he just could not be satisfied  
Its a game of all or nothing there is nowhere safe to run  
Someone might just pull the trigger cause temptation is a gun  
He met her at a night club on the other side of town  
Somehow he could not resist her shes the best hed ever found  
She knows she found her ticket to the other side  
Its a game of all or nothing there is nowhere safe to run  
Someone might just pull the trigger cause temptation is a gun  
His foolish ways seem harmless but his world was so divine  
Cause at home they know his secrets theyve heard all his alibis  
As he tries to face his feelings he cant justify his crimes  
Now comes the final ending of the dreams he once held sacred deep inside  
He can kiss it all goodbye  
Its a game of all or nothing there is nowhere safe to run  
Someone might just pull the trigger cause temptation is a gun  
Oh umm ya baby ahh temptation is a gun  
Temptation is a gun All or nothing all or nothing
