Coney Island  
Coming down from Downpatrick  
Stopping off at St Johns Point  
Out all day birdwatching  
And the craic was good  
Stopped off at Strangford Lough  
Early in the morning  
Drove through Shrigley taking pictures  
And on to Killyleagh  
Stopped off for Sunday papers at the Lecale District  
Just before Coney Island  
  
On and on over the hill to Ardglass  
In the jam jar autumn sunshine magnificent  
And all shining through  
  
Stop off at Ardglass for a couple of jars of  
Mussels and some potted herrings in case  
We get famished before dinner  
  
On and on over the hill and the craic is good  
Heading towards Coney Island  
  
I look at the side of your face as the sunlight comes  
Streaming through the window in the autumn sunshine  
And all the time going to Coney Island Im thinking  
Wouldnt it be great if it was like this all the time
