Where did your long hair go  
Where is the girl I used to know  
How could you lose that happy glow  
Oh Caroline no  
  
Who took that look away  
I remember how you used to say  
Youd never change but thats not true  
Oh Caroline you  
  
Break my heart  
I want to go and cry  
Its so sad to watch a sweet thing die  
Oh Caroline why  
  
Could I ever find in you again  
The things that made me love you so much then  
Could we ever bring em back once they have gone  
Oh Caroline no
