Something is worrying me yeah  
And that something is driving me in misery oh  
I can tell the way things change  
That youve been loving some other man  
Thats why something keeps on worrying me yes it is  
Thats why something is worrying me oh  
  
I can tell by the look in your eye  
I can tell by the way you smile  
I know things havent been this way  
I stopped to love you each and every day  
And that something keeps on worrying me yeah  
Thats why something is driving me in misery yeah  
  
I can tell by the look in your eye  
That youve been loving some other guy  
Thats why something keeps on worrying me oh yes it is  
Thats why something keeps on worrying me darling  
That something baby  
Is deep down in my heart  
Is worrying me baby  
I know you love somebody  
I know you have somebody else  
Its worrying me baby  
I need you right here by my side
