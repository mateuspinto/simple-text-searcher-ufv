Blue sky upon the horizon  
Private eye is on my trail  
And if I dont be there by morning  
You know that I must have spent the night in jail  
  
Ive been running from Memphis to L A  
Had an appointment set sometime for today  
And if I dont be there by morning  
You know that I must have gone the other way  
  
Finding my way back to you girl  
Lonely and blue and mistreated too  
Sometimes I think of you girl  
Is it true that you think of me too  
  
I got a woman living in L A  
I got a woman waiting for my pay  
And if I dont be there by morning  
Pack my clothes get down on your knees and pray  
  
Chorus  
  
I left my woman with a twenty dollar bill  
I left her waiting I hope shes waiting for me still  
If I dont be there by morning  
You know that I I never will
