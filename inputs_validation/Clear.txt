I wish that I had two faces to prove which theory works  
Yelling on the street corner or cleverly masking your words  
I take my face off at the door cause I dont know who they will take me for  
I wonder if I tell them what I did last night  
Whether or not I got caught they just might  
Wage war on you therefore its true  
That I shot my general on my side of enemy lines  
  
2x  
Im the son of all Ive done  
Im the son of all Ive done  
Impostor been fostered then my new father drained my dirty blood  
  
Im not trying to be lying to you  
But it takes a clever guy to do what I do  
It takes some chivalry and well placed energy  
To subliminally get yourself inside you  
Introspection is the name of this session  
Spread this infection reflect it on the next one  
The next one the next one and when were done  
Well all have made something new under the sun  
Im not done Im not done yet no  
Kick me off the stage and take my microphone  
Then youll walk up to me and when you get close  
Ill look you in the face and say Wheres your home  
Where are you going and why are you here  
Have you asked these questions Have you been sincere  
Want to know what I believe Its right here  
Dig a little deeper and its crystal clear  
  
2x  
Im the son of all Ive done  
Im the son of all Ive done  
Impostor been fostered then my new father drained my dirty blood  
  
x3  
I will tell you what I can  
But your mind will take a stand  
I sing of a greater love  
Let me know when youve had enough
