A scream unlock the cage  
The roars rock the stage  
Hunger of the animals are calling  
Thrive upon the rage  
Raw prints on the page  
The rooms going wild walls are falling  
Lights shine illumination bright  
Reveal all the madness here tonight  
  
REFRAIN  
Welcome I bid your welcome to live  
Inside the electric circus  
Hang onhang on to your life  
The animals are all insane  God help us  
  
Electricity to burn  
Amplifiers churn  
Three ring madhouse calls the action  
Its life upon the road  
Insane asylum grows  
Night after night the main attraction  
A strange world that you might want to know  
When it comes alive  crank crank crank crank the show  
  
REFRAIN
