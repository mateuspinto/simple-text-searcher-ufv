I want to be  
A cowboy star upon the screen  
Oh hey and I want to drive  
My cowboy car across the scene  
  
Oh hey and I want to write  
The magazines the housewives read  
And I want to be  
In control of everything  
I want to be King  
  
I want to make the toys  
You buy for Christmas Eve  
Yeah and I want to be  
The father of the ethnic child  
Who stars on TV  
  
Oh yeah and I I want to write  
The magazine the housewives read  
  
Oh hey and I want all the leaders  
Of the Third World  
To answer to me  
  
I want to be King  
I want to be King  
So maybe now the Pope  
Will bow and kiss my ring  
I want to be King
