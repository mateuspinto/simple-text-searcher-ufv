When my hope is lost  
And my strength is gone  
I run to you and you alone  
When I cant get up and I cant go on  
I run to you and you alone  
Cause youre my light in the dark  
And I sing with all of my heart  
  
Hallelujah  
My almighty God divine  
Hallelujah  
I am yours and you are mine  
This is all I know I will say  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
Youre my everything  
  
When Im plagued with pain  
And filled with fear  
I run to you and you alone  
When my days are few  
And death is near  
I run to you and you alone  
Cause youre my light in the dark  
And I sing with all of my heart  
  
Hallelujah  
My almighty God divine  
Hallelujah  
I am yours and you are mine  
This is all I know I will say  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
  
When trouble comes and goes  
And when the cold wind blows  
I lift my hands up I lift my hands up  
When sorrow knocks me down  
And you pick me off the ground  
I lift my hands up I lift my hands up  
  
And I sing Hallelujah  
My almighty God divine  
Hallelujah  
I am yours and you are mine  
This is all I know I will say  
  
Hallelujah  
By the grace of God above  
Hallelujah  
Our shining light to shine above  
This is all I know I will say  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
This is all I know I will say  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
Youre my everything  
  
Ohh ohh youre my everything
