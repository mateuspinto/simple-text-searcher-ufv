A verdict heard by the jurys wordtheyre lying  
I watch as the victims of the slave ships battle with the demons inside  
But no wrong ever righted or proved by the innocent dying  
I pray from the ashes of the ruins the answer will rise  
  
Chorus  
Hey the scream  
Hear their screams as they rise from the ashes  
Hey  
Lord save the soul who can hear the scream  
  
A child is born to a world that is slowly dying  
He chooses to march to the beat of a different drum  
A man lays dead in the street his mama is crying  
The people they measure this man by the damage hes done  
  
Chorus  
  
Lord praise the man who can hear the scream  
  
Forgive us for our sins I never meant the things I did  
I never meant I never meant I never meant  
  
Chorus x2
