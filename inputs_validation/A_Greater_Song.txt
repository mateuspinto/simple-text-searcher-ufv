Who could imagine a melody  
True enough to tell of Your mercy  
Who could imagine a harmony  
Sweet enough to tell of Your love  
I see the heavens proclaiming You day after day  
And I know in my heart that there must be a way  
  
To sing a greater song  
A greater song to You on the earth  
To sing a greater song  
A greater song to You on the earth  
  
Who could imagine a symphony  
Grand enough to tell of Your glory  
Our highest praise but a feeble breath  
A whisper of Your thunderous worth  
  
I see the heavens proclaiming You day after day  
And I know in my heart that there must be a way  
  
To sing a greater song  
A greater song to You on the earth  
To sing a greater song  
A greater song to You on the earth  
  
Hallelujah we want to lift You higher  
Hallelujah we want to lift You higher
