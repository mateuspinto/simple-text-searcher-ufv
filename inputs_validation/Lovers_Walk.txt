I wont walk with my head bowed  
Be on Beyond caution where lovers walk  
My love walks where threes a crowd  
Beyond caution where lovers walk  
Lovers walk lovers scramble  
Beyond caution where the lovers walk  
Lovers step shuffle and gamble  
Beyond caution where lovers walk  
Lovers trip lovers stumble  
Lovers dip lovers fumble  
Lovers lip where love has crumbled  
Beyond caution where lovers walk  
Lovers strut lovers stroll lovers leap  
Lovers late lovers wait  
Making promises that they cant keep  
Lovers link up arm and arm  
Lovers slink up lovers charm  
Lovers drink up and come to harm  
Beyond caution where lovers walk  
Love is gone and its no ones fault  
Love has stopped here lovers halt  
Lovers dont walk lovers run  
Will you look what love has done  
Will you look what love has done  
Will you look what love has done  
Beyond caution where lovers walk  
Now loves limping on a lovers crutch  
Looking for a hand with a personal touch  
Beyond caution where lovers walk
