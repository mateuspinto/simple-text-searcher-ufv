We could walk away now  
Call it over and done  
Say we fought the good fight  
And nobody won  
  
Say were both better off  
That worse came to worst  
So we didnt last  
Hey were not the first  
  
But then again  
If we give it one more try  
We might find the feeling  
Never really died  
And theres still a chance to be  
All we might have been  
And find the love we had back then again  
  
Off to such a good start  
But somehow it seems  
Weve let our hearts  
Fall apart at the dreams  
  
We could throw in the towel  
Walk away with our pride  
Say it just wasnt worth  
All the tears that we cried  
  
But then again  
If we give it one more try  
We might find the feeling  
Never really died  
And theres still a chance to be  
All we might have been  
Lets find the love we had back then again  
  
Baby if we want it bad enough  
We can make it better than it ever was  
  
And theres still a chance to be  
All we might have been  
Lets find the love we had back then again
