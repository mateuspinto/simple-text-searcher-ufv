Bad or a wet dream  
Feelin so in between  
Gun in my pocket an a target on my head  
Right on the wrong road  
He talks to me through dogs  
Not sure who it is but I know it aint God  
  
Feel like theyre watchin me  
Know that theyre watchin me  
Cmon lets go got two tickets to the moon  
Now what are you supposed to do  
When they got their hooks in you  
  
Do you believe me  
I was there  
And didja hear it  
Yeah  
  
Not my fault wasnt even there  
Rest of the world all gone insane  
Can ya hear the dogs barkin can ya hear the dogs speak  
Seen it on the TV something gonna break  
Now how am I supposed to breathe  
When there is no air  
And how am I supposed to be  
When those hooks are pullin me  
Down  
  
If you release me  
Wont be there  
If you leave me  
I wont care  
  
I hear black it has no mercy  
Repeating in my head  
  
In my head  
In my  
  
From the inside out talk to me in tongues  
The worst of this I understand  
That the flies are breeding  
The wounds are bleeding  
Therell be no healing in my house  
  
From the inside out  
You know Im not the same  
  
Repeating in my head  
In my head
