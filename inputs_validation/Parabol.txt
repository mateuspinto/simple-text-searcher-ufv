So familiar and overwhelmingly warm  
This one this form I hold now  
Embracing you this reality here  
This one this form I hold now so  
Wide eyed and hopeful  
Wide eyed and hopefully wild  
  
We barely remember what came before this precious moment  
Choosing to be here right now Hold on stay inside  
This body holding me reminding me that I am not alone in  
This body makes me feel eternal All this pain is an illusion
