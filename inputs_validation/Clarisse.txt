Clarisse what perfume you wearing today no dont tell me I know  
And the soap that you washed with  
Come to me dont feel scared Im not going to bite  
Well maybe just a little maybe just a might  
You know without windows without the wind the rain or snow  
I feel somewhat strange but of course all this you know  
Tell me about the lambs Clarisse tell me why youre scared  
I know when your father died something died in there  
To see simplicity in any mortal thing is a gift few men have  
What makes a killer a madman its not disgusting its sad  
I dream of trees now I smell the sea dont you find that fun  
You have the pleasures of the flesh Clarisse you can feel the sun  
But on the darker side you feel the anger rise you feel the satisfying hate  
And if you had to kill against your strongest will you wouldnt shoot that
bullet late  
Please dont judge me so wait just before you go come up closer to the cage  
Let me taste the smells of your own body cells you mustnt covert me with rage  
I ate to feed I killed in kind you believe me dont you hear the echos in your
mind  
They say Im insane dont they but do they really know why  
They say Im nothing but a cannibal cant understand or even try  
For in the night when I whisper from my cell and play my pshyciatric game  
In the morning when the inmates dead they hang a new one to my fame  
If I walked the streets a free man in the heat I couldnt terrify a crowd  
But in a silent home where wed be all alone youd need to freshen up a shroud  
Please believe I couldnt hurt you Id try to make you feel  
Welcomed like a friend Id have you over for a meal  
Then Id tear at your silken breast rip out the heart beating and bloody  
Gnaw with lust at your soften neck cutting and spitting and cooking you slowly  
Feed you up like a blooded boar fruit in the mouth and garnished with roses  
Feel nothing for you anymore deader than hell a meal for a hungry man
