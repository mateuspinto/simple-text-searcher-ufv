Say the word and I will sing for You  
Over oceans deep I will follow  
If each star was a song  
And every breath of wind praise  
It would still fail by far to say  
All my heart contains  
I simply live I simply live for You  
  
Chorus  
As the glory of Your presence  
Now fills this place  
In worship we will meet You face to face  
There is nothing in this world  
To which You can be compared  
Glory on glory praise upon praise  
You bind the broken hearted  
And save all my tears  
By Your word You set the captives free  
There is nothing in this world  
That You cannot do  
I simply live I simply live for You
