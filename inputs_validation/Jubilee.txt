Oh glad day to celebrate Neath the cloudless sky  
Air so sweet Water pure  
Fields ripe with rye Come one come all  
Gather round Discard your Sunday shoes  
Come on now Oh my land  
Be a jubilee Come on girl  
Come on boy Be a jubilee  
  
Oh my land Oh my good  
People dont be shy Weave the birth of harmony  
With childrens happy cries Hand in hand  
Were dancing around In a freedom ring  
Come on now Oh my land  
Be a jubilee Come on girl  
Come on boy Be a jubilee  
  
We will never fade away Doves shall multiply  
Yet I see hawks circling the sky Scattering our glad day  
With debt and despair What good hour  
Will restore our troubled air Come on people  
Gather round You know what to do  
Come on people Oh my land  
What be troubling Oh my land  
What be troubling What be troubling  
What be troubling you  
  
We are love and the future We stand in the midst of fury and weariness  
Who dreams of joy and radiance Who dreams of war and sacrifice  
Our sacred realms are being squeezed Curtailing civil liberties  
Recruit the dreams that sing to thee Let freedom ring  
  
Freedom ring Freedom ring  
Jubilee Oh my land  
Oh glad day Oh my land  
Hear our cry Freedom ring  
Oh glad day Oh my land  
Jubilee Jubilee
