Once upon a time there lived an old miser man  
By the name of Silas Stingy  
He carried all his money in a little black box  
Which was heavy as a rock  
With a big padlock  
All the little kids would shout  
When Silas was about  
  
Chorus  
Money money money bags  
Money money money bags  
There goes mingy Stingy  
There goes mingy Stingy  
Money money money bags  
Money money money bags  
There goes mingy Stingy  
There goes mingy Stingy  
  
Silas didnt eat which was just as well  
He would starve himself for a penny  
He wore old clothes and he never washed  
Cause soap cost a lot  
And the dirt kept him hot  
All the little kids would shout  
When Silas was about  
  
Chorus  
In the back of his head  
Was a voice that said  
Someone will steal it all  
Youll be lying in the gutter with an empty box  
The thieves will be having a ball  
  
Chorus  
He bought a safe to put the box in  
And a house to put the safe in  
And a watchdog on a chain to make quite sure  
And his face was very funny  
When he counted up his money  
And he realized he hadnt any more  
  
Chorus
