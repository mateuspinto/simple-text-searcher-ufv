I left you on the debris  
At the Sunday morning market  
You were sorting through the odds and ends  
You was looking for a bargain  
I heard your footsteps at the front door  
And that old familiar love song  
Cause you knew youd find me waiting there  
At the top of the stairs  
I went there and back  
Just to see how far it was  
And you you tried to tell me  
But I had to learn for myself  
Theres more trouble at the depot  
With the general workers union  
And you said Theyll never change a thing  
Well they wont fight and theyre not working  
Oh you was my hero  
How you are my good friend  
Ive been there and back  
And I know how far it is  
But I left you on the debris  
Now we both know you got no money  
And I wonder what you would have done  
Without me hanging around
