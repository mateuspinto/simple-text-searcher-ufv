I said the train is coming baby  
I said the train is comin now  
I said the train is coming baby  
I said the train is comin now  
So long Ive been waiting  
Waiting for you oh yeah  
Now the time has come  
And its between me and you oh Lord  
I said the train is coming baby  
The train is comin now now now now  
I said the train is coming baby  
And I am leaving on that train Lord  
Everyday I pray  
For this little hour  
Now the time has come  
And I want you to stand by me  
Because the train is comin baby  
And we are leaving on that train  
And we will roam this land  
Where we all will be free Lord
