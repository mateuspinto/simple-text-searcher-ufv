I believe  
If you give  
A little bit of love  
To those you live with  
A little bit of love  
Oh oh oh  
Has gotta come your way  
  
Well in my mind  
Its easy  
To lose sight of the truth  
But in my heart  
I cant deny  
My feeling inside  
  
Cause I believe  
If you give  
A little bit of love  
To those you live with  
A little bit of love  
Oh oh oh  
Has gotta come your way  
  
Man in the sky  
You say you are flying  
To lose sight of the world  
You want to stay high  
Then dont deny  
Your feeling inside  
  
Cause I believe  
If you give  
A little bit of love  
To those you live with  
A little bit of love  
Oh oh oh  
Has gotta come your way  
  
Yeah  
Whoo  
  
I believe  
If you give  
A little bit of love  
To those you live with  
A little bit of love  
Oh  
Has gotta come your way  
  
I believe  
If you give  
A little bit of love  
To those you live with  
A little bit of love  
Whooo  
Has gotta come your way
