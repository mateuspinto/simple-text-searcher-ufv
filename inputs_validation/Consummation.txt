And now we are one  
Let my soul rest in peace  
At last it is done  
My soul has been released  
For thousands of years  
My soul has roamed the earth  
In search for you  
So that someday I could give birth  
  
To know joy joy joy joy  
Joy and peace is mine  
Peace divine  
And now we give thanks  
Give thanks for each other  
At peace forever  
For it is done  
  
At peace forever  
For we are one
