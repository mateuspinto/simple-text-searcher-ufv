No man can love her like I do  
Ah he can buy her diamonds he can buy her pearls  
He can send her on a trip all around this world  
  
He can buy her anything her little heart desires  
But he dont know how to set that little girls soul on fire  
Even though he drives a big fine cadillac car  
And he keeps her dressed up ah like a movie star  
  
Anything she asks of him his money can buy  
But when it comes down to love she gives me a try  
No man can love her like I do  
Tell the truth no man can love her like I do  
No man can love her like I do  
Even though I dont have one thin dime  
Every time I call her you know shes right on time  
  
No man can love her like I do  
Aint no man in this land who can love her like I do  
No man can love her like I do
