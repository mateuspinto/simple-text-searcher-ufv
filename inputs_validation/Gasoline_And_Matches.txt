Baby baby baby baby listen what I say  
Baby baby baby baby let me have my way  
Im gonna keep on knockin till the door unlatches  
You and me are gasoline and matches  
  
Baby baby baby baby when its cold and dark  
Baby baby baby baby you make me feel a spark  
Well I feel a spark and the fire catches  
You and me are gasoline and matches  
  
You pull my pin and you trip my wire  
Yeah well you come in and set my heart on fire  
You knock me out you rock me off my axis  
You and me are gasoline and matches  
  
Baby baby baby baby when you make your move  
Baby baby baby baby I can feel your groove  
The resistance of a strong willed mans in ashes  
You and me are gasoline and matches

You knock me out you rock me off my axis
