I walk in the rain and whistle a tune  
I talk to the man up there in the moon  
I know I may sound like somebody gone insane  
Im a fool about you baby but my heart cant explain  
  
Its a little left of center  
By heavenly design  
Love gets carried away  
And goes wild at times  
When cupid aims his arrow  
Its right on the mark  
A little left of center  
Just like my crazy heart  
  
It leaps like a frog when you touch my hand  
It means like a drum in a marching band  
Cant help what it does I just follow where it leads  
How my heart feels about you baby makes perfect sense to me  
  
Its a little left of center  
By heavenly design  
Love gets carried away  
And goes wild at times  
When cupid aims his arrow  
Its right on the mark  
A little left of center  
Just like my crazy heart  
  
When cupid aims his arrow  
Its right on the mark  
A little left of center  
Just like my crazy heart
