Whenever skies look gray to me  
And trouble begins to brew  
Whenever the winter winds become too strong  
I concentrate on you  
  
When fortune cries nay nay to me  
And people declare youre through  
Whenever the blues become my only song  
I concentrate on you  
  
On your smile so sweet so tender  
When at first my kiss you declined  
On the light in your eyes when you surrender  
And once again our arms intertwine  
And so when wise men say to me  
That loves young dream never comes true  
To prove that even wise men can be wrong  
I concentrate on you  
I concentrate I concentrate  
On you
