Dont decieve me  
Please dont leave me  
What would I do without you  
To see me through  
If you leave me then youll grieve me  
What would I do without you  
To see me through  
What would I do  
I wanna know  
What would I do  
Where would I go  
Can you please me  
When you squeeze me  
What would I do oh if I oh  
To see me through  
What would I do  
I wanna know  
What would I do  
Where would I go  
Oh yes Im crazy  
bout my baby yes I am  
What would I do without you  
To see me through ohhhh
