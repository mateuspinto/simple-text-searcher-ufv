Looking out for love  
In the night so still  
Oh Ill build you a kingdom  
In that house on the hill  
Looking out for love  
Big big love  
  
You said that you love me  
And that you always will  
Oh you begged me to keep you  
In that house on the hill  
Looking out for love  
Big big love  
  
I wake up alone  
With it all  
I wake up  
But only to fall  
  
Looking out for love  
Big big love  
Just looking out for love  
Big big love
