Messenger of fear in sight  
Dark deception kills the light  
Hybrid children watch the sea  
Pray for father roaming free  
Fearless wretch insanity  
He watches  
Lurking beneath the sea  
Great old one forbidden site  
He searches  
Hunter of the shadows is rising  
Immortal  
In madness you dwell  
Crawling chaos underground  
Cult has summoned twisted sound  
Out from ruins once possessed  
Fallen city living death  
Fearless wretch insanity  
He watches  
Lurking beneath the sea  
Timeless sleep has been upset  
He awakens  
Hunter of the shadows is rising  
Immortal  
In madness you dwell  
In madness you dwell  
Not dead which eternal lie  
Stranger eons death may die  
Drain you of your sanity  
Face the thing that should not be  
Fearless wretch insanity  
He watches  
Lurking beneath the sea  
Great old one forbidden site  
He searches  
Hunter of the shadows is rising  
Immortal  
In madness you dwell
