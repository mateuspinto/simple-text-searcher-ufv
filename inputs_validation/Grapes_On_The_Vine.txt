There are songs that birds dont sing to people  
There are secrets that keep right through to the end  
There are heroes who hide until forever  
And Im singing this song for one of them  
  
Hes the man that you passed on the road there  
The one with his life on the loose  
Going either somewhere or nowhere  
Going without me without you  
  
For he is this worlds constant orphan  
Traveling out his lone time  
Living on apples from orchards  
Dying from grapes on the vine  
  
You can find him in big city winters  
Down where the mission bell cries  
And sorrow echoes through summer  
As he tries to close all his eyes  
  
You can find him in Pittsburgh in Christmas  
You can find him in Buffalo in June  
And he knows all the back roads between them  
Like the gypsy knows the moon  
  
And its route 22 all over again  
Stick your thumb out and try to look like somebodys friend  
Look strong at the man gentle at the girl  
And puzzled at the rest of the world  
  
Living on apples from orchards  
Dying from grapes on the vine
