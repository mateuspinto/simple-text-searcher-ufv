One look and Im done  
One glance from your eyes  
And Im captivated  
  
The taste of your skin  
The warmth of your hungry lips  
Has me so taken and I  
Love the way you can make me dance  
From miles away  
  
When Im with you Im so sedated  
Im captivated by you  
  
Youre just like the wind cuz  
Everything moves away when youre around it  
  
The sun is just like the sound of  
your voice in the morning  
When you light my world up and I  
Love the way you can make me dance From miles away  
  
When Im with you Im never jaded  
Im captivated  
  
Oh  
Ill never stop believing  
In this crazy love were leading  
Oh sugar  
Hold me closer  
Make me sweeter  
I need ya  
I love you  
  
So please show me that smile  
Make me laugh for just a little while  
Then breathe me one breath  
I only need one to fill the emptiness  
  
Love the way you can make me dance  
From miles away  
Its been so long but now  
Ive waited and Im captivated
