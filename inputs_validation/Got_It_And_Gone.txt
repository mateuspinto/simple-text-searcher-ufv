When he was a child just a baby boy  
He wanted to play rock music and sing some songs of joy  
When he started school he just could pat his feet  
The first song he ever learned had a strong boogie beat  
Come on now  
Rock it rock it rock it along  
Roll it roll it roll it on  
Git it git it git it on  
Got it got it got it and gone  
Then one day it happened they hauled him off to war  
Way over there in no mans land just him and his guitar  
Nobody near to love him nobody ever sent him news  
What could a poor boy do at night but to sit down and sing them blues  
Early one morning they called him oh what a beautiful day  
They packed him in an old army plane and flew him back home to stay  
He landed in Clark Air base but didnt have no place to go  
So he sit down with his guitar in the middle of the street and gave everybody
a free show
