Once in A lifetime  
Kenny Loggins and Human Nature  
Runaway Bride  
  
Something about you  
Oh could it be I finally found  
My destiny  
Now here you are  
Within my reach  
  
How did I miss you how did I miss you  
When you were out there all the time  
It took this moment  
To make me realize  
  
Once in a Lifetime  
You find your reason for living  
You find the one that makes your every dream  
Come true  
Find the one that makes your dreams  
Oh I could search the world forever  
But no one else could do  
Cause once in a lifetime  
You find someone like you  
  
Ahh  
Once in a lifetime ohh  
  
Ive waited for so long so long  
Makin this cant nothin be but a lie  
Cause all about  
Standing by wind oohh  
Alone in the crowd oh oh oh  
  
I went through the motion went through the motion  
Then out of heaven you arrived  
Whatever was wrong  
Suddenly is right  
  
Cause once in a lifetime  
You find the reason for living  
You find the one who makes your every dream  
Come true  
Find the one who makes your dream  
No I could search the world forever  
And no one else would do  
Cause once in a lifetime  
You find someone like you  
  
Find someone like you  
Hearts that wait for love can grow so weary  
Dont you know A heart can grow  
But it doesnt matter anymore  
When you find the one youve waited for  
  
You find your reason for living  
You find the one that makes your every dream come Oh you make it come true  
Oh you could search the world forever  
But no one else would do  
Cause once in a lifetime  
You find someone like you  
  
Cause once in a lifetime  
You find someone  
Someone like you  
  
Ahhh  
Whoaaa
