There he was that little man sitting by the altar Black Devil  
Carved in stone so dark and could Black Devil  
Help me Help me cause I dont know whats going on  
It was the early morning of the seventh day  
  
I had been making love to Angel in every single way  
The sun was peeking through a window high above  
Thats when I saw her kiss the little devil on his head  
Black Devil if you could only speak Black Devil  
  
What do you see when youre looking at me  
There he was that little man fingers spread like claws Black Devil  
I wonder what it is he knows Black Devil  
Help me help me cause I dont know whats going on  
  
Black Devil if you could only speak  
Black Devil What do you see when youre looking at me  
When I look around this church on holy ground  
There are things within that should have never been  
  
Why two pulpits in a place like this  
One facing to the East the other to the West  
One of th guilded canopies have gargoyles in the sun  
And on the other canopy I see demons having fun  
  
Black Devil if you could only speak Black Devil  
What do you see when youre looking at me  
Black Devil always near why dont you want me here  
I can feel your hate in my soul I wonder what it is you know  
  
Black Devil whats going on
