Yeah  
They say home is where the hate is my dome is where fate is  
I stroll where souls get lost like Vegas  
Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses  
Pray to God that my arms reach the masses  
The young smoke grass in grassless jungles  
Rubber band together in cashless bundles  
We wear strugglin chains divided only hustle remains  
Makin sense of it we hustle for change  
Revolution aint a game its another name for life fightin  
Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson  
Hypes fightin for hits to heighten they hell  
Dont he know he could only get as high as he fell  
Show money becomes bail relationships become jail  
Children are unheld  
I wish love was for sale Behold the Pale Horse  
Got me trapped like R Kel I bail and it  
  
Might not be such a bad idea if I never never went home again  
Im on my way home  
I left three days ago but no one seems to know Im gone  
Home is where the hatred is home is filled with pain and it  
Might not be such a bad idea if I never never went home again
