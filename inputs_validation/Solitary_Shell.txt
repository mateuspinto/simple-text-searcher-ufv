He seemed no different from the rest  
Just a healthy normal boy  
His mama always did her best  
And he was daddys pride and joy  
  
He learned to walk and talk on time  
But never cared much to be held  
And steadily he would decline  
Into his solitary shell  
  
As a boy he was considered somewhat odd  
Kept to himself most of the time  
He would daydream in and out of his own world  
But in every other way he was fine  
  
Hes a Monday morning lunatic  
Disturbed from time to time  
Lost within himself  
In his solitary shell  
  
A temporary catatonic  
Madman on occasion  
When will he break out  
Of his solitary shell  
  
He struggled to get through his day  
He was helplessly behind  
He poured himself onto the page  
Writing for hours at a time  
  
As a man he was a danger to himself  
Fearful and sad most of the time  
He was drifting in and out of sanity  
But in every other way he was fine  
  
Hes a Monday morning lunatic  
Disturbed from time to time  
Lost within himself  
In his solitary shell  
  
A momentary maniac  
With casual delusions  
When will he be let out  
Of his solitary shell
