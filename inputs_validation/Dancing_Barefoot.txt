She is benediction  
She is addicted to he  
She is the root connection and  
She is connecting with me  
  
Here I go and I dont know why  
I spin so ceaselessly  
Could it be hes taking over me  
  
Im dancing barefoot  
Headed for a spin  
Some strange music drags me in  
It makes me come up like some heroine  
  
She is sublimation  
She is the essence of thee  
She is concentrating on  
He who is chosen by she  
  
Here I go when I dont know why  
I spin so ceaselessly  
Could it be hes taking over me  
  
Im dancing barefoot  
Headed for a spin  
Some strange strange music drags me in  
It makes me come up like some heroine  
  
She is recreation  
She intoxicated by thee  
She has the slow sensation that  
He is levitating with she  
  
Here I go when I dont know why  
I spin so ceaselessly  
Til I lose my sense of gravity  
  
Im dancing barefoot  
Heading for a spin  
Some strange music drives me on  
Makes me come up like some heroine  
  
Oh God I feel for you  
Oh God I feel for you  
Oh God I feel for you  
Oh God I feel for you
