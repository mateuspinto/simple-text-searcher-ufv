Like a movie scene  
In the sweetest dreams  
I have pictured us together  
Now to feel your lips  
On my finger tips  
I have to say is even better  
Than I ever thought it could possibly be  
Its perfect its passion its setting me free  
From all of my sadness  
The tears that Ive cried I have spent all my life  
  
Waiting for tonight Oh  
When you would be here in my arms  
Waiting for tonight Oh  
Ive dreamed of this love for so long  
Waiting for tonight  
  
Tender words you say  
Take my breath away  
Love me now and leave me never  
Found a sacred place lost in your embrace  
I want to stay in this forever  
I think of the days when the sun used to set  
On my empty heart  
All alone in my bed  
Tossing and turning emotions were strong I knew I had to hold on  
  
Waiting for tonight Oh  
When you would be here in my arms  
Waiting for tonight Oh  
Ive dreamed of this love for so long  
  
Waiting for tonight Oh  
When you would be here in my arms  
Waiting for tonight Oh  
Ive dreamed of this love for so long  
Waiting for tonight  
  
Gone are the days when the sun used to set  
On my empty heart all alone in my bed  
Tossing and turning  
Emotions were strong  
I knew I had to hold on  
  
Waiting for tonight Oh  
When you would be here in my arms  
Waiting for tonight Oh  
Ive dreamed of this love for so long  
  
Waiting for tonight Oh  
When you would be here in my arms  
Waiting for tonight Oh  
Ive dreamed of this love for so long  
  
Waiting for tonight Oh  
When you would be here in my arms  
Waiting for tonight Oh  
Ive dreamed of this love for so long  
Waiting for tonight Oh
