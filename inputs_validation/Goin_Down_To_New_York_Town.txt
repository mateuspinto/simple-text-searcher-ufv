Well I feel just like a freight train baby  
Running out of steam  
I wanna go on down to New York town  
But Im stuck in between  
And I could stay on here at home alone  
And have myself to thank  
But I just made a billion dollars  
And I dont wanna put it in the bank  
So if you call  
We could go to town  
Well dear mom  
If you could see me now here underneath the lights  
I gotta keep em on from dusk to dawn  
And everythings alright  
I met a girl with autumn in her eyes  
And summer in the way  
She makes me feel  
Like I was only born today or yesterday  
And if she calls  
We could go to town  
But everybody here  
Hates everything I say  
And girl I just dont know  
If I can last another day  
So I guess Im going back  
Back where I belong  
I hope you come along  
Before I get back on that train that takes me  
Home from New York City  
To the things I left behind  
And though I aint got no money girl  
 Ill always have the time  
But I wish that you would hurry  
I hope you get here soon  
cause I just sold the sky to the sun  
So I could buy for you the moon  
And if you call  
We could go to town So if you call  
Yeah if you call  
Girl if you call  
We could go to town
