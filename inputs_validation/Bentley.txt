You drive up in a summer sky blue bentley  
Death reflect detecting in his eyes  
Thought about all the women who loved me  
I said oh no  
He said get inside  
I said oh no  
He said get inside  
  
I got into his summer sky blue bentley  
Sun reflect detecting in my eyes  
Thought about all the fun I had lately  
I said Uh huh I said I want to drive  
I said Uh huh I want I want to drive  
We drive We drive  
  
You say you wanna go swimming in my ring  
Its green and shimmering  
Like my lipstick the colour of dawn  
Like my lipstick the colour of dawn  
We got out of his summer sky blue bentley  
  
Death reflect detecting in the sky  
He held my hand to the ocean he lead me  
I said uh huh I want I want to die  
Uh huh I want I want to die
