Gimme fuel gimme fire gimme that which I desire  
Turn on the dynamo into the wild I go  
No other place I know I know  
Turn on I see red

Throttle up for speed ahead yeah ahead  
CHORUS  
Ooooh on I burn  
Fuel these pumping engines  
Burning hard loose and clean  
And on I burn turning my direction  
Quench my thirst with gasoline  
Gimme fuel gimme fire gimme that which I desire  
Cant fight the need for speed  
Im loose Im clean Im burning lean and mean and mean  
Ignite the open trail  
Excite exhale comin on hot from hell yeah hot from hell  
CHORUS  
Gimme fuel gimme fire gimme that which I desire  
Oooh yeahheh
