La la la la la la lala la  
La la la la la la lala la  
La la la la la la lala la  
La la la la la la lala la  
  
For you  
There might be another star  
But through my eyes the light of you its all I see  
For you  
There might be another song  
But all my heart can hear is your melody  
So long ago my heart without demanding  
Informed me that no other love could do  
But listen did I not though understanding  
Fell in love with one  
Who would break my heart in two  
For you  
Love might bring a toast of wine  
But which each sparkle know the best for you I pray  
For you  
Love might be for you to find  
But I will celebrate our love of yesterday  
So long ago my heart without demanding  
Informed me that no other love could do  
But listen did I not though understanding  
Fell in love with one  
Who would break my heart in two  
For you  
There might be another star  
But through my eyes the light of you its all I see  
For you  
There might be another song  
But in my heart your melody will stay with me
