My Bonnie lies over the ocean my Bonnie lies over the sea  
My Bonnie lies over the ocean O bring back my Bonnie to me  
  
Chorus  
Bring back bring back O bring back my Bonnie to me to me  
Bring back bring back O bring back my Bonnie to me  
  
O blow ye winds over the ocean  
O blow ye winds over the sea  
O blow ye winds over the ocean  
And bring back my Bonnie to me  
  
Chorus  
  
Last night as I lay on my pillow  
Last night as I lay on my bed  
Last night as I lay on my pillow  
I dreamed that my Bonnie was dead  
  
Chorus  
  
The winds have blown over the ocean  
The winds have blown over the sea  
The winds have blown over the ocean  
And brought back my Bonnie to me  
  
Chorus  
  
My Bonnie leaned over the gas tank  
The height of its contents to see  
I lit a small match to assist her  
O Bring back my Bonnie to me  
  
Chorus  
  
Last night as I lay on my pillow  
Last night as I lay on my bed  
I stuck my feet out of the window  
In the morning the neighbors were dead  
  
Chorus  
  
My mother makes beer in the bathtub  
My father makes synthetic gin  
My sister makes fudge for a quarter  
Wouldja believe how the money rolls in  
  
Chorus  
  
My mother she drowned in the bathtub  
My father he died from his gin  
My sister choked on her chocolate  
My stars what a fix I am in  
  
Chorus  
  
I tried making beer in the bathtub  
I tried making synthetic gin  
I tried making fudge for a living  
Now look at the shape that Im in
