We know its hard for you to see  
That this is all we want to be  
A constant urge within us grows  
To do the thing that we propose  
We tried so hard to make the grade  
By making music day to day  
Although our task is never done  
You ought to know its just begun  
And now its time for us to say  
But most of all we like to play  
A song or two that makes you feel  
Like all the good in you is real  
Together now weve lots to hear  
To warm my heart to shed a tear  
So come and listen if you choose  
And feel a joy youll never lose  
So everybody listen  
Yeah  
Everybody please give a listen
