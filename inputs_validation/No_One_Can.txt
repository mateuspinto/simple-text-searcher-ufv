You landed in my life  
Like a new and brighter light  
That made all my past seem in the shadow  
I always used to believe  
That beauty was skin deep  
But I need a new word to describe you  
  
And the time that it took to take down the wall  
Was the time that it took for me to fall  
Hopelessly weak  
  
No one can take you away from me now  
Dont worry if they take me away  
No one can take you away from me now  
Dont matter how long we have to wait  
  
The days before you came  
Were really all the same  
A greyness I used to call freedom  
Endless nights out with the boys  
The boasting and the noise  
To think that I ever believed them  
  
No one can take you away from me now  
Dont worry if they take me away  
No one can take you away from me now  
Dont matter how long we have to wait  
  
I dont care what they think  
Youre all I believe in  
I carry you here  
And theres something of you  
In everything that I love  
  
No one can take you away from me now  
Dont worry if they take me away  
No one can take you away from me now  
Dont matter how long we have to wait  
No one can take you away from me now  
Dont worry if they take me away
