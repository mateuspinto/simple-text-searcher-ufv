Now here comes sundown  
And a Cadillac too  
Now here comes sundown  
And a Cadillac too  
The man was walking on his girlfriend  
Longshot it could have been you  
Now somewhere down on Millers Farm  
Youre gonna have your day too  
You been stayin out late nights  
You been going home alone  
You been stayin out late nights  
You been going home alone  
The man gonna get you  
And gonna bring you to the farm  
Some day here down on Millers Farm  
Youre gonna have your day too  
Ever since I known you for a long long time  
You cant be satisfied  
If you dont watch out what youre doing to yourself  
My man gonna take you for a ride oh yeah  
Midnight and morning  
I seen you bringin up them stairs  
Between midnight and morning  
I seen em bring you up them stairs  
Theyre calling for your unverified  
The maid dont catch you there  
Some day here down on Millers Farm  
Youre gonna have your day too
