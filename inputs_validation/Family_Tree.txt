Forgotten things remembered  
The tigers eat their young  
The body stayed but inside the head  
The mind was on the run  
Conspiracy of silence  
The only way out of pain  
Is turn around and run through it man  
Too wet to come in from the rain  
Tell them  
I know they were doing it to you  
But dont try doing it to me  
Let me show you how I love you  
Its our secret you and me  
Let me show you how I love you  
But keep it in the family tree  
The secret of the family tree  
When you hear them saying Trust me  
Dont wait to see whats next  
Thrown to the wolves  
Forever trusting  
Raised in a form of living Hell  
Sing a one note song of rage  
Live and die within your heart  
So beware in the shadows  
Your family tree waits in the dark  
I say
