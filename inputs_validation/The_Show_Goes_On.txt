Little boys and girls  
Come out and play  
The world is a stage  
For me and you to play on  
We all are actors  
We all are actresses  
Do you want to sit around  
Watch your life going by  
When you can be anything that you want to be  
And you can do anything that you want to do  
Come ondon t let it happen to you  
  
Chorus  
The show goes on without you  
  
Forget about your Mama  
Forget about your Daddy  
They have been to the stage  
It s time for them to move on  
You are the star of the show now  
Controlling your own destiny  
Everybody s watching  
There s no one to blame  
When you can be anything that you want to be  
And you can do anything that you want to do  
Come ondo you want to sit around  
And watch your life go by  
  
Chorus  
The show goes on without you
