Jingle bells jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh  
Jingle bells jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh  
On Dasher on Dancer on Prancer on Vixen  
On Comet on Cupid on Donner on Blitzen  
Put on your bells your Christmas bells  
  
Come on were going for a sleigh ride  
Christmas time is here again  
Come on were going for a sleigh ride  
To spread good cheer again  
From the top of the chimney to the top of the wall  
Dash away dash away dash away all  
  
Old Saint Nicholas he took a flight  
The moon was shining bright  
Bring out the bells  
Ol Saint Nick was riding through the sky  
You should have seen those reindeer fly  
  
Bring out the bells its a holiday season  
Bring out the bells its a happy time  
Bring out the bells weve got a good reason  
To ring the bells and hear those pretty bells chime
