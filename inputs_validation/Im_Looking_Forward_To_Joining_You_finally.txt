As black as the night can get  
Everything is safer now  
Theres always a way to forget  
Once you learn to find a way how  
  
In the blur of serenity  
Where did everything get lost  
The flowers of naivete  
Buried in a layer of frost  
  
The smell of sunshine  
I remember sometimes  
  
Thought he had it all before they called his bluff  
Found out that his skin just wasnt thick enough  
Wanted to go back to how it was before  
Thought he lost everything  
Then he lost a whole lot more  
  
A fools devotion  
Swallowed up in empty space  
The tears of regret  
Frozen to the side of his face  
  
The smell of sunshine  
I remember sometimes  
  
Ive done all I can do  
Could I please come with you  
Sweet smell of sunshine  
I remember sometimes
