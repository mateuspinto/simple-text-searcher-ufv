The paper called it suicide  
A bullet from a fortyfive  
Nobody cared and nobody cried  
Dont that make you feel sad  
  
Peter Brent combed his hair  
And sent for the police  
Policeman came took Peters name  
God may he rest in peace  
  
No one saw the note beside the body  
No one knew the problems  
But my God  
Suicide  
  
The body remains unidentified  
Forgotten in a file  
Like the letter that was blown aside  
Dont that make you want to smile  
  
No one was really satisfied  
About number eightyone  
The autopsy proved that Peter lied  
But they never could find the gun  
  
No one saw the note beside the body  
No one knew the problems  
But my God  
Suicide
