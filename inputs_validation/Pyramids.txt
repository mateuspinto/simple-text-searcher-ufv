Theres a sky in the east  
Over pyramids at Giza  
Where there once lived a girl  
She ruled the world  
Then down the nile  
He came with a smile  
He was the king  
She was the queen  
Under the moonlight  
Your eyes wont believe  
What your mind cant concieve  
  
Oooh  
Nights over Egypt  
Nights over Egypt  
Nights over Egypt  
Incense and myrrh  
And girls that swirl  
To the music  
Nights over Egypt  
  
Women fellahin  
Wear veils to been seen  
By no one  
Take a caravan across  
The sudan  
Saharan fagade  
Is just a mirage  
Oasis in the sand  
Where life once began  
Under the moonlight  
Your eyes wont believe  
What your mind cant concieve  
Nights over Egypt  
Nights over Egypt  
Nights over Egypt  
Nights over Egypt
