I wasnt walking on water  
I was standing on a reef  
When the tide came in  
Swept beneath the surface  
Lost without a trace  
No hope at all  
No hope at all  
  
Oh  sweet miracle  
Oh  sweet miracle  
Of life  
  
I wasnt walking with angels  
I was talking to myself  
Rising up to the surface  
Raging against the night  
Starless night  
  
Oh  sweet miracle  
Loves sweet miracle  
Of life  
  
I wasnt praying for magic  
I was hiding in plain sight  
Rising up from the surface  
To fly into the light
