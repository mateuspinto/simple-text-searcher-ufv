I opened up my mind  
Peace I could not find  
Then something out of the blue  
Said I needed you  
  
Time swept me away  
Merged me into pain  
Then something out of the blue  
Said you need me too  
  
Oh what joy it bring to me  
To know that heavens round  
Oh what gladness in my heart  
To know my loves been found  
  
Now where hope was lost  
Loves paid the cost  
And something out of the blue  
Said my love is you  
Something out of the blue  
Said I needed you  
Something out of the blue
