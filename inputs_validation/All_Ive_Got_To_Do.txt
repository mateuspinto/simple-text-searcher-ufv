Whenever I want you around yeah  
All I gotta do  
Is call you on the phone  
And youll come running home yeah  
Thats all I gotta do  
  
And when I I wanna kiss you yeah  
All I gotta do  
Is whisper in your ear  
The words you long to hear  
And Ill be kissing you  
  
And the same goes for me  
Whenever you want me at all  
Ill be here yes I will  
Whenever you call  
You just gotta call on me yeah  
You just gotta call on me  
  
And when I I wanna kiss you yeah  
All I got to do  
Is call you on the phone  
And youll come running home yeah  
Thats all I gotta do  
  
And the same goes for me  
Whenever you want me at all  
Ill be here yes I will  
Whenever you call  
You just gotta call on me
