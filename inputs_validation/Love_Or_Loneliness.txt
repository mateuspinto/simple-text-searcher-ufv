Had a nice time  
I enjoyed the picture show  
When you walked me to my door  
I knew I wanted more  
When I asked you in  
It was already getting late  
Though I knew better  
I didnt eaven hesitate  
I like the way you hold me  
And make me feel so good  
Though I say I wouldnt  
You kinda knew that I would  
Its been so long since Ive  
Been with a man  
Better ask myself  
While I still can  
Is this love or is it just loneliness  
When the sun comes up is this something we will both regret  
Is this love or is it just loneliness  
We ought to stop and ask ourselves is it really worth it  
And how about you  
Do you really want me  
Or am I just here  
To please your masculinity  
You dont see me emough  
To let me know you care  
You know the worst thing for a woman  
Is a sometime love affair  
Seems like every time  
I satisfy your needs  
You dont call me back  
For two or three weeks  
What am I gonna do  
I just cant fight  
The temptation of loving you  
Is this love or is it just loneliness  
When the sun comes up is this something we will both regret  
Is this love or is it just loneliness  
We ought to stop and ask ourselves is it really worth it  
Sometimes its hard  
To tel the difference  
Im just not sure  
If its worth it  
Is this love or is it just loneliness  
When the sun comes up is this something we will both regret  
Is this love or is it just loneliness  
We ought to stop and ask ourselves is it really worth it  
cause you never show up til midnight  
Then you go home early  
Now you know that aint right  
Ive got a question I wanna ask you  
Do you really love me or am I just a fool  
Is this love or is it just loneliness  
When the sun comes up is this something we will both regret  
Is this love or is it just loneliness  
We ought to stop and ask ourselves is it really worth it
