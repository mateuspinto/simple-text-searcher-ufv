Oh I wish I was in the land of cotton  
Old times they are not forgotten  
Look away look away look away Dixieland  
Oh I wish I was in Dixie away away  
In Dixieland I take my stand to live and die in Dixie  
Cause Dixieland thats where I was born  
Early Lord one frosty morning  
Look away look away look away Dixieland  
Glory glory hallelujah  
Glory glory hallelujah  
Glory glory hallelujah  
His truth is marching on  
So hush little baby  
Dont you cry  
You know your daddys bound to die  
But all my trials Lord will soon be over
