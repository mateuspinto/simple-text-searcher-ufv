The vultures come  
The vultures come for me  
Fly around sun  
But now too late for me  
Just sit and stare  
Wait til I hit the ground  
Little vultures tear  
Little vultures tear at flesh  
  
Vulture is down to stay  
Pick the bone until your clean  
Bone to bone and in between  
Pick the bone until your clean  
  
Woah oh  
Woah oh  
Woah yeah  
Woah oh  
Woah oh woah  
  
Right without soul  
I rummage high and low  
Search for my soul  
Search though Im high above  
We leave behind  
Too late too late again  
I just want to search the soul  
But my soul is flesh and bone again  
  
Vultures is down to stay  
Pick the bone until your clean  
Bone to bone and in between  
Pick the bone until your clean
