Stroll to the cafe  
My God how time flies  
I close up my brain  
And another friend dies  
I feel like a mirror  
Feel like nothing is mine  
I could go back to crying  
But now dying seems fine  
So I hang from the ceiling  
Or I sit on the air  
Or rot in a corner  
Until somebody cares  
Faces at random  
I quote people I knew  
Id love to be like me  
If I can feel like you  
Here am I more roche five than pain  
Here am I just me and my walls to blame  
Here am I I really dont feel quite sane  
Here am I still searching for my shadow in vain  
Lock my door I only think in black and white  
Ill even try to look ashamed  
Moving out of central  
Somebody knows me well  
Says hell spill the whole story  
He may be lying I cant tell  
Meet me inside  
Ill keep my head to the floor  
And one hand on the handle  
Of the mad sane door  
Here am I more roche five than pain  
Here am I just me and my walls to blame  
Here am I I really dont feel quite sane  
Here am I still searching for my shadow in vain  
Lock my door I only think in black and white  
Ill even try to look ashamed  
My shadow in vain  
My shadow in vain  
My shadow in vain
