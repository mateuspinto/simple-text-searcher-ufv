I dont feel the joy  
I dont feel the pain  
You were just adored  
I am just insane  
  
Walking on my own  
Leaving you behind  
You were crying out  
That you need to speak your mind  
  
Chorus  
Ohhh  
So alone in love  
So alone at night  
Im gonna haunt you everyday  
Haunt you everyday  
  
I am gonna kill  
When I need a thrill  
Beating at the heart  
Until Ive had my fill  
When will stupid learn  
Fires gonna burn  
Think of consequence  
Then you move when it your turn  
  
Chorus  
  
Walking on my own  
Leaving you behind  
You were crying out  
That you need to speak your mind  
  
Chorus  
Haunt you everyday
