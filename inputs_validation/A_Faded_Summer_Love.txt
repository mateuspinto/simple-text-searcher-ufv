You left today but you didnt say goodbye  
I wonder why  
Im standing now where you made your vow  
So blue for you I could cry  
  
Leaves come tumbling down round my head  
Some of them are brown some are red  
Beautiful to see but reminding me  
Of a faded summer love  
  
Swaying high above in the trees  
They were so in love with the breeze  
Now the autumn wind brings to them the end  
Of a faded summer love  
  
Im like the poor leaves that sway with the breeze  
I thought that life was sweet  
You are the sweet breeze that tried hard to please  
Then swept me off my feet  
  
Summer morning dew turns to frost  
Leaves that once were new pay the cost  
Beautiful to see but reminding me  
Of a faded summer love  
  
Im like the poor leaves that sway with breeze  
I thought that life was sweet  
You are the sweet breeze that tried hard to please  
Then swept me off my feet  
  
Summer morning dew turns to frost  
Leaves that once were new pay the cost  
Beautiful to see but reminding me  
Of a faded summer love
