My heart was made of broken bones  
My Souls a bag of stick and stone  
And out along this dusty road  
You have come my love to take me home  
  
I give to you my everything  
Youve given me these loving wings  
And angels have all gathered round  
To hear me sing my love out loud oh  
  
You lightly lifted me away  
Out of a darkness cold and gray  
And I work beneath the midday sun  
My cool blue water you have come  
  
I give to you my everything  
Youve given me these loving wings  
And angels have all gathered round  
To hear me sing my love out loud oh  
  
So take your place here next to me  
And Ill take my place there next to thee  
And no matter how far we may roam  
Its by your side I make my home  
  
I give to you my everything  
Youve given me these loving wings  
And angels have all gathered round  
To hear me sing my love out loud oh
