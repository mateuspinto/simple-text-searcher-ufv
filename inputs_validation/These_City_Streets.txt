these city streets got a nigga packin heat for bustaz  
No time to reli on these bitches cause theres riches to make  
Some niggaz is fake but we separate them from the real  
And still maintain the squrill that fills my pocket wit green  
Idamean soldier to solrier marchin stay of dosja holdin the strap  
How Im supposed to puttin cowards deep under the dirt like a flower get
deboured  
When my weapon shower from los angles south central 49th and  
Sampedro cant nobody yell louder
