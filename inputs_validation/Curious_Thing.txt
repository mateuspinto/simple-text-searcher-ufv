There was this guy he was down on his luck  
He was truly povertys child  
Well he had no home and he had no car  
And he wore a weary smile  
Moved out to la knocked around for awhile  
But he was getting nowhere  
Then he did this movie and it did really well  
Now hes a millionaire  
See life is a curious thing  
Life ooh life is a curious thing  
  
I know a man who could paint the town red  
Had a college degree in fun  
till the doorbell rang and a long lost flame said  
this little boy is your son  
Gave him a suitcase and a bear  
Left em in a cloud of dust  
Now hes checking out schools and driving carpools  
Learning to adjust  
He says life is a curious thing  
Life ooh life is a curious thing  
  
Well I know that it can be demanding  
I know that it can be unkind  
I dont really understand it  
But lord sure knows I try  
Life is a curious thing  
Life ooh life is a curious thing  
  
Let me tell you bout a kid I knew  
A pudgy girl back in school  
She had greasy hair and geeky glasses  
Object of ridicule  
The other day in the check out line  
They were ringing up my rice and beans  
There she was a pretty little face  
On the cover of a magazine  
And I said life is a curious thing  
Life ooh life is a curious thing  
chorus  
  
Just goes to show that you never know  
Just what tomorrow may bring  
But Ill tell you this that what it is  
Is seldom what it seems  
cause life is a curious thing  
Life ooh life is a curious thing
