I wasnt born in the morning no  
I must have been born in the night  
Ive done my load and Ill carry my load  
And all I own is my life  
  
I wasnt born to be lucky  
Cause luck had no future with me  
Ive done my wrong and Ill sing sing sing my song  
and stand beneath the hanging tree  
  
Bury me down by the river  
Let all the towns people see  
Their enemys dead let me lay lay my head  
Just put me down and set me free  
  
I wasnt born as a rich man no  
A rich man I never I never could be  
Ive done my wrong and Ill sing sing sing my song  
And stand beneath the hanging tree Everybody sing now  
  
Bury me down by the river lord no  
Let all the towns people see see  
Their enemys dead let me lay lay lay my head  
Just put me down and set me free  
I want to hear everybody sing  
  
Bury me down by the river  
Let all the towns let all the towns people see  
Their enemys dead let me lay let met lay let me lay my head along  
Just put me down and set me free set me free
