Treated you like a rusty blade  
A throwaway from an open grave  
Cut you loose from a chain gang  
And let you go  
  
And on the day you said its true  
Some love holds and some gets used  
Tried to tell you I never knew  
It could be so sweet  
Who could ever be so cruel  
Blame the devil for the things you do  
Its such a selfish way to lose  
The way you lose these wasted blues  
These wasted blues  
  
Tell me that its nobodys fault  
Nobodys fault  
But my own  
Tell me that its nobodys fault  
Nobodys fault  
But my own  
  
Tell me that its nobodys fault  
Nobodys fault  
But my own  
Tell me that its nobodys fault  
Nobodys fault  
But my own  
  
When the moon is a counterfeit  
Better find the one that fits  
Better find the one that lights  
The way for you  
  
When the road is full of nails  
Garbage pails and darkened jails  
And their tongues are full of heartless tales  
That drain on you  
Who would ever notice you  
You fade into a shaded room   
Its such a selfish way to lose  
The way you lose these wasted blues  
These wasted blues  
  
Tell me that its nobodys fault  
Nobodys fault  
But my own  
Tell me that its nobodys fault  
Nobodys fault  
But my own  
Tell me that its nobodys fault  
Nobodys fault  
But my own  
Tell me that its nobodys fault  
Nobodys fault  
But my own  
  
Tell me that its nobodys fault  
Nobodys fault  
But my own  
Tell me that its nobodys fault  
Nobodys fault  
But my own  
Tell me that its nobodys fault  
Nobodys fault  
But my own  
Tell me that its nobodys fault  
Nobodys fault  
But my own
