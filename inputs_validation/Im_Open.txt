A man lies in his bed in a room with no door  
He waits hoping for a presence something anything to enter  
After spending half his life searching he still felt as blank  
As the ceiling at which he stared  
He is alive but feels absolutely nothing  
So is he  
When he was six he believed that the moon overhead followed him  
By nine he had deciphered the illusion trading magic for fact  
No tradebacks  
So this is what its like to be an adult  
If he only knew now what he knew then  
Im open 2x  
Come on in 4x  
Im open 2x  
Come on in 4x  
Im open  
Lying sideways atop crumpled sheets and no covers he decides to  
Dream  
Dream up a new self for himself
