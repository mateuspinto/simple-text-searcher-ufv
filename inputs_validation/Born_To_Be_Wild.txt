Get your motor runnin  
Head out on the highway  
Lookin for adventure  
And whatever comes our way  
Yeah darlin go make it happen  
Take the world in a love embrace  
Fire all of your guns at once  
And explode into space  
  
I like smoke and lightning  
Heavy metal thunder  
Racin with the wind  
And the feelin that Im under  
Yeah Darlin gonna make it happen  
Take the world in a love embrace  
Fire all of your guns at once  
And explode into space  
  
Like a true natures child  
We were born born to be wild  
We can climb so high  
I never want to die  
  
Born to be wild  
Born to be wild
