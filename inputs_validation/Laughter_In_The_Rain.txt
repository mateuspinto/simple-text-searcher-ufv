Strolling along country roads with my baby  
It starts to rain it begins to pour  
Without an umbrella were soaked to the skin  
I feel a shiver run up my spine  
I feel the warmth of her hand in mine  
  
Oo I hear laughter in the rain  
Walking hand in hand with the one I love  
Oo how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside  
  
After a while we run under a tree  
I turn to her and she kisses me  
There with the beat of the rain on the leaves  
Softly she breathes and I close my eyes  
Sharing our love under stormy skies  
  
Oo I hear laughter in the rain  
Walking hand in hand with the one I love  
Oo how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside  
I feel the warmth of her hand in mine  
  
Oo I hear laughter in the rain  
Walking hand in hand with the one I love  
Oo how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside  
Oo I hear laughter in the rain  
Walking hand in hand with the one I love  
Oo how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside  
Oo I hear laughter in the rain  
Walking hand in hand with the one I love  
Oo how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feel inside  
Oo I hear laughter in the rain  
Walking hand in hand with the one I love  
Oo how I love the rainy days and the happy way I feelinside
