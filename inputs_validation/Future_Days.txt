If I ever were to lose you  
Id surely lose myself  
Everything I have found here  
Ive not found by myself  
Try and sometimes youll succeed  
To make this man of me  
All of my stolen missing parts  
Ive no need for anymore  
  
I believe  
And I believe cause I can see  
Our future days  
Days of you and me  
  
Back when I was feeling broken  
I focused on a prayer  
You came deep as the ocean  
Its something something out there here  
All the complexities and games  
No one wins but somehow they still play  
All the missing crooked hearts  
They may die but in us they live on  
  
I believe  
And I believe cause I can see  
Our future days  
Days of you and me  
  
When hurricanes and cyclones rage  
When wind turned dirt to dust  
When floods they came or tides they raised ever  
Closer became us  
  
All the promises at sundown  
I meant them like the rest  
All the demons used to come around  
Im grateful now theyve left  
  
So persistent in my ways  
Here a angel lying here to stay  
No resistance no alarms please this is just too good to be gone  
  
I believe  
And I believe cause I can see  
Our future days  
Days of you and me  
You and me  
Its you and me
