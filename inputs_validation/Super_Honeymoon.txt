Glamor and fashion  
Models and magazines  
A striking runway entrance  
Beauty and passion  
Stardust and high class scenes  
Of popular teens  
When I lived in Denver  
I met a millionaire  
With ribbons in her blond hair  
I still remember  
She was like a princess  
Straight from a dreamy castle in the air  
  
So lovely  
She was everything to me  
  
Both alone in the dark  
We longed to see the sun  
Rise over the Bering Strait  
I was sick of the west  
When I turned 21  
So I moved to the Sunshine State  
We played golf on the moon  
And tennis on the sun  
Like athletes in the afternoon  
The solar flares burned my arms  
And made her makeup run  
On our superlunar honeymoon  
  
I was the youngest son of a congressman  
And everything was my fault  
She was a gymnast  
Happily swinging on the uneven bars  
Tucked in a somersault  
  
So lovely  
She was everything to me  
  
So lovely  
She was everything to me  
  
Both alone in the dark  
We longed to see the sun  
Rise over the Bering Strait  
I was sick of the west  
When I turned 21  
So I moved to the Sunshine State  
We played golf on the moon  
And tennis on the sun  
Like athletes in the afternoon  
The solar flares burned my arms  
And made her makeup run  
On our superlunar honeymoon
