Verse 1  
Were here alone while the thunder is roaring  
And the windows are blowing  
Cause its storming and pouring tonight  
I put my hand on your chest  
I can feel your heart  
And its beating kinda fast so is mine  
In this moment of silence you look me in the eyes  
Nothing is verbalized but so much is said  
I need you so much  
The more Im away from you the more of you I want  
Oooh oooh  
Oooh oooh  
I need you

I want to hold you till I cant feel again  
Until your soul lets me in

Tell me that you wanna make love  
Tell me that you wanna relieve love  
Tell me that you wanna make love yeah  
Baby Im a man that believes in what it is  
  
Verse 2  
Were going to a whole nother level  
When we do it its so true  
And its so much more than sexual tonight  
When were connected every touch every kiss is perfected  
Its like when we finally found what we been looking for  
It gets better and better with time  
This is deeper than love  
The more of you I have the more of you I want  
Oooh oooh  
Oh I need you baby  
Oooh oooh  
Woah

Hey hey  
Oh baby can we go deeper  
Deeper than the surface  
Further than that

I want to hold you till I cant feel again  
Until your soul lets me in
