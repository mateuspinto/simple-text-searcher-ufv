How many lives must I live  
How many lies must I hear  
How many times must I feel so blue  
How many times must I lose you  
  
All I hear now  
Is the sound of my heart breakin down  
Or losing ground  
  
How many bridges must I burn  
How many lessons must I learn  
How many times must I ask you to stay  
How many times will you push me out of your way  
  
All I hear now  
Is the sound of my heart breaking down losing ground  
All I hear now  
Is the sound of my heart losing ground slowing down  
  
Maybe somebody will show me a better way  
Maybe somebody will know me someday  
How many times must I hear your voice  
Inside my dreams your answering machine  
Youre always there and everywhere in between  
  
All I hear now  
Is the sound of my heart slowing down  
Can ya hear the sound  
All I hear now  
Is the sound of my heart leaving town breakin down  
Slowin down losin ground breakin down and stopping here  
  
All I hear now  
All I hear now
