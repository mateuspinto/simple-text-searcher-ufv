Walking all the day near tall towers where falcons build their nests  
Silver winged they fly they know the call of freedom in their breasts  
Soar Black Head against the sky  
Between the rocks that run down to the sea  
Living on your western shore saw summer sunsets asked for more  
I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland  
Talking all the day with true friends who try to make you stay  
Telling jokes and news singing songs to pass the night away  
Watched the Galway salmon run like silver dancing darting in the sun  
Living on your western shore saw summer sunsets asked for more  
I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland  
Drinking all the day in old pubs where fiddlers love to play  
Someone touched the bow he played a reel it seemed so fine and gay  
Stood on Dingle beach and cast in wild foam we found Atlantic Bass  
Living on your western shore saw summer sunsets asked for more  
I stood by your Atlantic sea and sang a song for Ireland  
Dreaming in the night I saw a land where no man had to fight  
Waking in your dawn I saw you crying in the morning light  
Lying where the Falcons fly they twist and turn all in your rare blue sky  
Living on your western shore saw summer sunsets asked for more  
I stood by your Atlantic sea and I sang a song for Ireland
