A little girl trapped in her knowledge and craft  
Came tripping to my room last night  
I cooked her a steak and I tried not to fake  
And still make everything alright  
She had dreads in her hair and problems and cares  
She tried hard not to let em show  
She was decent and sweet and I was sizin up the meat  
But doubts fell in my mind like snow  
And when the shove comes down to love  
The facade falls down  
And when the bricks fall from the tricks  
The facade falls down  
  
Its a sunny afternoon and Im sitting in my robe  
Im dirty and Im here alone  
Theres a story on my table that talks about me  
And I want to stuff it down the authors throat  
And Im sleeping with someone new every night  
And in the morning politely saying bye  
  
And Im nowhere and no one  
And I only wanna run  
And I feel like a hamburger bun  
And when you must  
Believe or bust  
The facade falls down  
When youre scared of a brand new care  
The facade falls down  
I got no reason to believe  
I got no reason but Im New York Scumbag Tough  
And Ill keep on truckin  
  
So night is falling  
And Im getting tired  
And its time to get my slippers and books  
Got a sweater and glasses  
And something that passes  
For a way to get by in this world  
And Im getting tired  
Of so many different things  
I guess Im just plain tired  
Or maybe too intelligent to believe  
In the obvious side of things  
And when voice says make a choice  
The facade falls down  
When your knees start to concede  
The facade falls down  
When the shove comes down to love  
The facade falls down  
And when the bricks fall from the tricks  
The facade falls down  
  
The facade falls down Repeat x5
