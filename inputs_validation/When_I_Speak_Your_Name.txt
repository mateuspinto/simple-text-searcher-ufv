Verse  
Jesus  
The most beautiful Name of all Names  
Jesus  
The only Name that brings healing and strength  
When I speak Your Name  
Mountains move  
Chains are loosed  
When I speak Your Name  
Darkness flees  
It has no hold on me  
  
Chorus  
Jesus  
Most beautiful Name that I know  
Youre the exalted One  
Jesus  
You have the power alone  
You lift the lowly one  
Jesus  
  
Verse 2  
Jesus  
The most wonderful Name of all Names  
Jesus  
The only Name that brings freedom and hope  
When I speak Your name  
Mountains move  
Chains are loosed  
When I speak Your name  
Darkness flees  
It has no hold on me  
  
Bridge 1  
Be exalted  
Be exalted  
Be exalted

No other Name  
No other Name  
I know
