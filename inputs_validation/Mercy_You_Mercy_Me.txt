Its kind of crazy  
How we are slaves to an early grave  
So we get wasted  
To see clearer through the haze  
  
You gotta shake it off  
Get back up  
Show what youre made of  
Make your own luck  
  
And raise your heart above these streets  
Put some soul under your feet  
Take only what you need  
Raise your heart above these streets  
Mercy you mercy me  
  
Its kinda frightening  
To see how much this place has changed  
  
You gotta shake it off  
Get back up  
Show what youre made of  
Make your own luck  
  
And raise your heart above these streets  
Put some soul under your feet  
Take only what you need  
Raise your heart above these streets  
Mercy you mercy me  
  
Oh get your head round what you need  
Oh get your head round what you feel  
Cause this is real
