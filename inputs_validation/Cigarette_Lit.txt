Cigarette lit  
My plans to quit  
And I know I can but I know I will forget it  
Stuck here I need something quick  
Jus to stop me thinking  
Always loud always in  
Jus come in to me  
  
Excuse me please what have you got  
Get me out of my head while Ive still got the courage  
But not so out just out enough till I feel like Im takin off  
  
The rain falls down Im not alone  
Covers all of us in silver line silver line  
And all I beg you stay with me  
Let it rain all night  
  
What a gift this short visit  
And I know Ill go just as quick as I came in  
Night stick my finger tips  
Jus stop me thinking  
Always out always in  
Oh jus come in to me  
  
Excuse me please what have you got  
Get me out of my head while Ive still got the courage  
Not so out just out enough till I feel like Im takin off  
And the rain fall down Im so alone  
And covered all of us with silver line in silver line  
And all I beg you stay with me  
Let it rain all night  
  
Im always out always in  
Jus come in to me  
Not so out just out enough till I feel like Im takin off  
And the rain falls down Im not alone  
And covers all of us in silver line in silver line  
And all I beg you stay with me  
Let it rain all night oh oh  
And the rain falls down Im not alone  
It covers up in a silver line in silver line  
And all I beg you stay with me  
Let it rain all night
