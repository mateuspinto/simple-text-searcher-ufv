All my daydreams are disasters  
Shes the one I think I love  
Rivers burn and then run backwards  
For her thats enough  
  
They all come from New York City  
And they woke me up at dawn  
She walked with me to the fountain  
And she held onto my arm  
  
Come on do what you did  
Roll me under New Madrid  
Shake my baby and please bring her back  
Cause death wont even be still  
  
Caroms over the landfill  
Buries us all in its broken back  
Theres a man of conviction  
And although hes getting old  
  
Mr Browning has a prediction  
And weve all been told  
So come on back from New York City  
Roll your trucks in at dawn  
  
Walk with me to the fountain  
And hold onto my arm  
Come on do what you did  
Roll me under New Madrid  
  
Shake my baby and please bring her back  
Cause death wont even be still  
Caroms over the landfill  
Buries us all in its broken back
