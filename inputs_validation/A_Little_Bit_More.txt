For certain she was the face of springtime  
The flowers stood and paid their due  
And all the folk they sang of a good rhyme  
While drinking all they wanted to  
A bitter sweet this final evening  
Before he must leave her side  
  
They danced around the glass filled tables  
While fiddlers played so sweet and low  
Their eyes hard fixed upon each other  
However would she let him go  
And when the time it came upon them  
She said in case we forget  
  
Just a little bit more just a little bit more  
Just a little bit more just a little bit more  
Just a little bit more just a little bit more  
Just a little bit more just a little bit more  
  
The letters came and every single Sunday  
We all would wait to hear the news  
She knew her love would be home someday  
The only thing she held on to  
We sang a song just like we used to  
And she said before we could leave  
  
Just a little bit more just a little bit more  
Just a little bit more just a little bit more  
Just a little bit more just a little bit more  
Just a little bit more just a little bit more  
  
That night she heard her true love calling  
With words that only she could know  
They held each other till the morning  
And when it was his time to go  
She said  
  
Just a little bit more just a little bit more  
Just a little bit more just a little bit more  
Just a little bit more just a little bit more  
Just a little bit more just a little bit more  
  
Just a little bit more
