Love is everywhere I see it  
You are all that you can be go on and be it  
Life is perfect I believe it  
Come and play the game with me  
  
Open yourself to the first celebration  
Open your eyes to the joy and pain  
Life is the fruit of your own creation  
Every new birth is a soul regained  
  
Love is everywhere I see it  
You are all that you can be go on and be it  
Life is perfect I believe it  
Come and play the game with me  
  
Drinking my life from a silver fountain  
Sweet water running to the cold salt sea  
Old man moon on a whitetop mountain  
Sound of the wind singing dreams for me  
  
Love is everywhere I see it  
You are all that you can be go on and be it  
Life is perfect I believe it  
Come and play the game with me  
  
Follow your heart like a flying stallion  
Race with the sun to the edge of night  
Form your truth like a gold medallion  
Dance in the circle of the love and the light  
  
Love is everywhere I see it  
You are all that you can be go on and be it  
Life is perfect I believe it  
Come and play the game with me
