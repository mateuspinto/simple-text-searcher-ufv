Bring night bring the night on  
Bring a little bit of dance bring a little bit of song yeah  
Bring night bring the night on  
Im not sure I can wait and this day has felt so long yeah  
  
Bring night bring the night on  
The music cuts into me and I know it cant be wrong yeah  
Bring night bring the night on  
Cuz all that we are after is a little bit of fun yeah  
  
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down  
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down  
Ooh ooh whoa ohh ooh ooh whoa ohh  
  
Bring night bring the night on  
Bring me the moon and stars and send away the sun yeah  
Bring night bring the night on  
Or maybe if Im lucky Ill end up in your arms  
  
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down  
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down  
Ooh ooh whoa ohh ooh ooh whoa ohh  
  
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down  
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down  
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down  
Chase your shadow till the sun goes down  
Ooh ooh whoa ohh ooh ooh whoa ohh  
  
Bring night bring the night on
