I left my home in Norfolk Virginia California on my mind  
Straddled that Greyhound it rode me past Raleigh and on across Caroline  
  
Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill and we never was a minute late  
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown rollin cross the Georgia
state  
  
Had motor trouble it turned into a struggle half way cross Alabam  
The hound broke down left us all stranded in downtown Birmingham  
  
Straight off bought me a through train ticket right across Mississippi clean  
And I was on the midnight flyer out of Birmingham  
Smoking into New Orleans  
  
Somebody help me get out of Louisiana  
Just help me get to Houston town  
People are there who care a little bout me  
And they wont let the poor boy down  
  
Sure as she bore me she bought me a silk suit put luggage in my hands  
And I woke up high over Albuquerque  
On a jet to the promised land  
  
Workin on a Tbone steak a la carte  
Flying over to the Golden State  
When the pilot told us in thirteen minutes  
Wed be headin in the terminal gate  
  
Swing low sweet chariot come down easy  
Taxi to the terminal zone  
Cut your engines cool your wings  
And let me make it to the telephone  
  
Los Angeles give me Norfolk Virginia  
Tidewater four ten oh nine  
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land callin  
And the poor boys on the line
