When I saw your face  
I became a prisoner of your eyes  
And I would do just anything  
To stay and be with you  
  
You know there are times  
When I let myself wonder  
As I was going under  
You Pulled me back to earth  
  
Dont you hear me crying  
Take me in your arms again  
Tell me that youre trying  
Or is our love a lie  
  
Love is blind  
And love deceives you  
You came along and captured me  
Now Im a prisoner of your eyes  
Trapped in time  
I cannot leave you  
Im just a prisoner of your eyes  
As each day goes by  
Ive given up completely  
Ive locked myself inside your heart  
And thrown away the key  
  
Only time will tell  
If I can live without you  
Can you live without you  
Can you see into the future  
Will you ever set me free  
  
Dont you hear me crying  
Take me into your arms again  
Tell me that youre trying  
Or is our love a lie  
  
Love is blind  
And love decieves you  
You came along and captured me  
Now Im a prisoner of your eyes  
Trapped in time  
I cannot leave you  
Im just a prisoner of your eyes  
  
In this heartache  
We can try and start again  
Stop the heartbreak  
A little time will help to kill the pain
