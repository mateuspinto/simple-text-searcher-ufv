Sisters sisters  
There were never such devoted sisters  
Never had to have a chaperone no sir  
Im there to keep my eye on her  
Caring sharing  
Every little thing that we are wearing  
When a certain gentleman arrived from rome  
She wore the dress and I stayed home  
All kinds of weather we stick together  
The same in the rain and sun  
Two different faces but in tight places  
We think and we act as one  
Those whove seen us  
Know that not a thing could come between us  
Many men have tried to split us up but no one can  
Lord help the mister who comes between me and my sister  
And lord help the sister who comes between me and my man
