I never meant to leave her my intentions were to stay  
It wasnt nothing she had done or nothing she could say  
To change this old familiar feeling that makes chills run through my skin  
Less she read my mind and saw the sings that point around the bend  
My toothbrush never leaves my pocket theres no anchor on my feet  
If my sleepin bag gets dusty and theres not enough to eat  
I may stay an extra day till I find another town  
You can bet theres not a lady that can show this freight train down  
And Ill be moving in the morning leaving you behind  
If anyone should ask you you can tell them they will find  
Somebody walking down the highway with a guitar in his hand  
And Ill always be remembered as a free born rambling man  
 guitar   
Lord tell the children when they find me that I died but not in vain  
They can find reincarnation in the whistle of a train  
And each time they hear the whistle blow through the stillness of the land  
Theyll know that I was happy as a free born rambling man  
And Ill be moving
