I finally found you  
Walkin down the road so much older than yesterday  
I finally found you  
Such a heavy load upon your shoulders  
  
I finally found a home in Georgia  
Sweet magnolias everywhere  
Sweet love by my side  
I find my world without a care  
I finally found you  
I finally found you  
Walkin down the road so much older than yesterday  
I finally found you  
Such a heavy load upon your shoulders  
I finally found the love I needed  
Sweet persuasion in the air  
Sweet love growing ever stronger  
I finally found you  
Etc
