I cant forget the night we met how bright were stars above  
That precious memory lingers yet when you declared your love  
And then you went away and now each night and day  
  
I wonder why you keep me waiting Charmaine my Charmaine  
I wonder when bluebirds are mating will you come back again  
I wonder if I keep on praying will our dreams be the same  
I wonder if you ever think of me too   
I am waiting my Charmaine for you   
  
You went away on dreary day I knew you had to go  
Mid tears and cheers I heard you say Charmaine I love you so  
Tho old years turn to new my heart keeps calling you  
  
I wonder why you keep me waiting Charmaine cries in vain  
I wonder when bluebirds are mating will you come back again  
I wonder if I keep on praying will our dreams by the same  
I wonder if you ever think of me too  
Charmaines waiting just for you
