When the white bird flies  
From your heart to mine  
I surrender every part of me  
To the tenderness  
  
Could it be the wine  
In your eyes stars shine  
And Im feeling like a child again  
Oh its taken me a little time  
To find words to say  
  
Chorus  
Stay  
Make this forever  
And lay love in my life  
Come what may  
Cherish each moment of love  
As dreams go by  
  
If the first glow fades  
From the love weve made  
I will hold you closer  
In the night  
Under heart and key  
  
When there are hills to climb  
And your world wont rhyme  
I will fight until I get it right  
Cause youre part of me  
The heart of me  
Only if youll stay  
  
Chorus  
  
The trees and the towers are burning  
Fear walks on the sea  
My soul in the wasteland is yearning  
What does tomorrow hold for me  
  
What can I say  
Just that I need you  
With you here by my side  
We can turn even the desert  
Evergreen as dreams go by
