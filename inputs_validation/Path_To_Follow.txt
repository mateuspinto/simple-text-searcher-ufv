I found a path to follow  
I knew it straight away  
Now that I found it I won t stray  
No I will not stray  
Not stray  
  
I walk through the woods and holler  
The songbirds will laugh and play  
They know I ve found it and won t stray  
No I will not stray  
Not stray  
  
The woods are alive with laughter  
The rivers are drunk with mirth  
They all know what I ve been after  
They re rejoicing for my rebirth  
For my rebirth  
  
I found a path to follow  
But it s a path for two  
Why don t you come here beside me  
I won t stray no I will not stray  
From you
