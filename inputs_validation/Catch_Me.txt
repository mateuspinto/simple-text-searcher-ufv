We coulda cleared up all these particulars  
That coulda been a homicide vehicular  
You wasnt in no state to speed off  
You was bugging out yeah you was peed off

You wanted oh so bad to prove points  
But your game always makes me lose points  
And your game always make me concur  
And maybe I shoulda never taken you from her  
But with all of the aforementioned  
I am still trapped in your dimension  
So I will be on the mountain waiting  
Cause I am in need of more attention  
Could have called back  
Just to say something  
Imma fall back  
In the bass drum  
Please come to destination

You succeeded at your attempts to make me  
Need you desperately to vindicate me
