The longing in my heart has stirred a faded memory  
Of my young heart beating fast behind the willow tree  
I was counting out loud and I only peeked a time or two  
And the only purpose in my life was finding you  
Singing Ollie ollie everybody free  
Now was I chasing you or were you chasing me  
  
We all grow up and put away our childhood games  
But deep inside I wonder if we really change  
Cause Im still seeking though Ive learned to hide so well  
And I can still remember how it felt  
Singing Ollie ollie everybody free  
Will I ever find someone pursuing me  
  
And then you caught me by surprise  
I found my tears are in your eyes  
I hear my heart inside of you  
At last Ive found somebody who  
Can free my soul  
And love me too  
  
I cant believe we hide so long and run so well  
When all the while were aching to be caught and held  
But its only in surrender that our freedom comes  
And so I run abandoned to your waiting arms  
Singing Ollie ollie everybody free  
I belong to you and you belong to me  
  
Singin Ollie ollie everybody free
