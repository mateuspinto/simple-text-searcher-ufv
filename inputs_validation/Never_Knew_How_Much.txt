Time and time again Ive felt these walls of plaster  
Closing in  
And more than once Ive felt that lonely lonely feeling  
Wondering why and where Ive been  
Just about the time I think I cant hold on  
Youre always there to keep me hanging on and I say  
  
I never knew how much a man needed a woman  
no I never  
I never knew how much a boy needed a girl  
needed a girl  
I never knew how much I needed you  
  
Day after day I join the rat race  
Tryin to make the most of it  
I keep on falling down down the ladder  
Still trying to stay on top of it  
Just when I was sure  
Nothing could get no better  
Oh I realize  
I still love you more than ever  
  
Chorus  
  
Today I watch the sun set on the freeway  
Strangled on the poison air  
But miles beyond on the other end  
I know youll always be waiting there  
Girl you treat me  
With your kindest hand  
And in my heart in my mind  
And Im so glad  
  
Chorus
