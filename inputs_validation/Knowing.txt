Chorus  
Brothers on the block knowing  
from this point on it only gets rougher  
Sisters at the crib knowing  
from this point on it only gets rougher  
Preachers at the church knowing we still get by  
from this point on it only gets rougher  
Teachers at the school knowing  
from this point on it only gets rougher  
Ladies on the block knowing  
from this point on it only gets rougher  
Junkies on the corner knowing but still get high  
from this point on it only gets rougher  
  
Big Boi  
Well heres a formal introduction  
Something to make you ponder  
The situations ugly like In Living Colors Wanda word up  
Well everybody play dumb but theres some that succumb  
  
And fall victim I will overcome any hurdle or obstacle thats in my path  
Fast cash should be the last resort so make it last for the risk you took  
Trick you shook your ass for some hundred dollar heels and a designer bag  
Now thats ass backwards  
  
All you got in the refrigerator is bratwurst  
Your stomach is balled in a knot you got that phat purse  
Pocketbook stop and look pockets look void  
Destroyed by the need to indulge and enjoy the finer things in life right  
  
Your dignity your only sacrifice slim as your chances of being somebodys
wife  
They seeing ya butt booty naked every night aint nothing right or wrong  
  
Chorus  
  
Big Boi  
Even though things started falling apart  
Wanda went and bought a Honda  
Now shes out of a job she would slob on a knob  
For a little less than a yard a massage you could drill her like a sarge  
  
She would charge and rob  
Pick through yo pockets  
She got the tricks watch and the silver locket  
That he bought for his wife but Wanda left her license  
  
On the night stand fuckin with this white man  
She met in a little red Corvette paid for sex  
Made a deal that she would never forget you can bet  
Every action has a positive and equal reaction  
  
Therefore everything that goes around comes around in that fashion  
Fast and furiously the was a knock on the sliding glass door bitch its
me  
You thought you was slick the way you hit me for that lick  
But you slipped now Im getting in your shit  
  
Chorus
