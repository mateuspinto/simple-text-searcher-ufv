Sometimes I feel so happy  
Sometimes I feel so sad  
Sometimes I feel so happy  
But mostly you just make me mad  
Baby you just make me mad  
  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
  
Thought of you as my mountain top  
Thought of you as my peak  
A thought of you as everything  
Ive had but couldnt keep  
Ive had but couldnt keep  
  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
  
Skip a life completely  
Stuff it in a cup  
They said Money is like us in time  
It lies but cant stand up  
Down for you is up  
  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
  
It was good what we did yesterday  
And Id do it once again  
The fact that you are married  
Only proves youre my best friend  
But its truly truly a sin  
  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
  
If I could make the world as pure  
And strange as what I see  
Id put you in a mirror  
Id put in front of me  
Id put in front of me  
  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
Linger on your pale blue eyes
