Dressed up for a big date  
Like Halloween day but it was Fourth of July now  
A car crash with a suitcase and a painted face  
She was one of a kind  
She wears a plastic crown like Cinderella  
And roller skates in bed  
  
Crash rides the greyhound from his hometown  
When he comes around cause they dont let him drive now  
Mixed up as a milkshake  
But make no mistake  
Theyre shooting for the stars  
  
Chorus  
You and me  
Were invincible together  
We can be so tragical whatever  
Dressed up just like ziggy but he couldnt play guitar  
Captain Crash and the beauty queen from mars  
  
Share a toothpick trading lipstick  
Watching traffic for days at the diner  
Holding hands making big plans  
Playing Superman he was wearing eyeliner  
Another local legend and his longtime lucky charm  
  
Chorus  
You and me  
Were invincible together  
We can be so tragical whatever  
Dressed up just like ziggy but he couldnt play guitar  
Captain Crash and the beauty queen from mars  
  
Theyre drunk on love as you can get  
Getting high on lust and cigarettes  
Living life with no regrets  
At least theyre gonna try to fly  
  
Chorus  
You and me  
Were invincible together  
We can be so tragical whatever  
Were Sid and Nancy  
Fred and Ginger  
Clyde and Bonnie  
Liz and Richard  
Kurt and Courtney  
Bacall and Bogie  
Joltin Joe and Ms Monroe  
Heres captain crash and the beauty queen from mars
