Im not a rat to be spat on locked up in this room  
Those bars that look towards the sun at night look towards the moon  
Everyday the swallows play in the clouds of love  
Make me wish that I had wings take me high above  
  
And I looked high and saw the empty sky  
If I could only I could only fly  
Id drift with them in endless space  
But no man flies from this place  
  
At night I lay upon my bench and stare towards the stars  
The cold night air comes creeping in and home seems oh so far  
If only I could swing upon those twinkling dots above  
Id look down from the heavens upon the ones I love  
  
Hey the lucky locket hangs around your precious neck  
Some luck I ever got with you and I wouldnt like to bet  
That sooner or later youll own just one half of this land  
By shining your eyes on the wealth of every man  
  
And I looked high and saw the empty sky  
If I could only I could only fly  
Id drift with them in endless space  
But no man flies from this place  
  
Just send up my love aint seen nothing but tears  
Now Ive got myself in this room for years  
I dont see no one I never see anyone
