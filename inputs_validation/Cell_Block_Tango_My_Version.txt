He had it coming he had it coming  
He only had himself to blame  
If youd been there  
If youd herd it  
I bet ya you would have done the same  
  
You now how people have these little habbits that get you down  
Like bernie  
Bernie he liked to chew gum  
No  
Not chew pop  
So I came home this one day and Im really irritated  
And Im looking for a little bit of sympathy  
And theres bernie lying on the couch drinking a beer and chewing  
No  
Not chewing popin  
So I said to him I said  
If you pop that gum one more time  
And he did  
So I took the shotgun of the wall and I fired two warning shots  
Into his head  
  
He had it coming he had it coming  
He only had himself to blame  
If youd been there  
If youd heard it  
I bet ya you would have done the same  
  
I met Esakiel Young at saltlake city about 2 years ago

My sister veronica and I had this double act  
And my husband charlie traveled around with us  
Now for the last number in our act we did these 20 acrobatic tricks in a row  
1 2 3 4 5 backflips flipflops splits spread eagles  
One right after the other  
Now we were staying at the hotel cicero  
You know boozing having a few laughs when we runout of ice  
So I go out to get some  
And when I came back I open the door  
And I see  
Veronica and charlie doin number 17  
The spread eagle  
Well I was in such a state of shock I completly blacked out I cant
remember a thing  
And it wasnt til later when I was washing the blood of my hands  
I even knew they were dead  
  
They had it comeing they had it coming  
They had it coming all along  
I didnt do it but if Id done it  
How could you tell me that I was wrong x2  
  
I loved elle lipshitz more then I could possibly say  
He was a sensetive guy  
A painter  
Everynight he went out looking for himself  
And on the way he found  
Ruth gladis rosemary and Irving  
You could say we broke up coz of artistic differences  
He saw himself alive  
I saw him dead  
  
The dirty bum bum bum bum bum x2  
  
He had it coming he had it coming  
He only had himself to blame  
Because he used us  
And he abused us  
It was a murder but not a crime  
  
He had it coming he had it coming  
He had it coming all along  
We didnt do it  
But if wed done it  
How could you tell us that we were wrong
