O Master let me walk with Thee  
In lowly paths of service free  
Tell me Thy secret help me hear  
The strain of toil the fret of care  
  
Teach me Thy patience still with Thee  
In closer dearer company  
In work that keeps faith sweet and strong  
In truth that triumphs over wrong  
  
O Master let me walk with Thee  
In closer dearer company  
O Master let me walk with Thee  
Let me walk with Thee  
  
In hope that sends a shining ray  
Far down the futures broadening way  
In peace that only Thou canst give  
With Thee O Master let me live
