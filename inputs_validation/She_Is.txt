She is the day that gives me time to live and  love my life  
Till night comes on with sundown scythe to end the puzzle pantomime  
She is a day of love  
  
She is the day through which I walk toward the bridge where she stands  
She is the air I breathe to sing she is a smile without demands  
  
She is the bridge on which I wait to watch the river neath me flow  
All spinning surging far below  
    
She is a bridge of love  
  
She is the day through which I walk toward the bridge where she stands  
She is the air I breathe to sing she is a smile without demands  
  
She is the air I breathe   
Awake asleep in  calm  
A wind to wash my lifted palm  
A sky that calls me out to dance  
She is the air of love  
  
She is the day through which I walk toward the bridge where she stands  
She is the air I breathe to sing she is a smile without demands  
  
She is the smile that keeps me warm with matchless laughter eyes ablaze  
A mischief mystery she plays upon the flute of early morn  
She is a smile of love  
  
She is the day through which I walk toward the bridge where she stands  
She is the air I breathe to sing she is a smile without demands
