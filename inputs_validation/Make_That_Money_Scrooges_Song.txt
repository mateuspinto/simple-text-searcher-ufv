When I was a boy  
I never played with toys  
Never had a friend  
Never laughed or cried much  
And when I was a boy  
My father was a man  
With a strict and sturdy hand  
No soft touch  
  
Make that money make that money  
Make that money run like honey  
On your tongue  
Gotta make that money  
Make that money listen sonny  
Learn to sting before your stung  
  
Now that Im a man  
Every penny has been planned  
Im financially grand  
And perfectly greedy  
Sentimental fools  
I make all your rules  
Ive got your cash got your jewels  
Theyre all mortgaged to me  
  
Make that money make that money  
Make that money run like honey  
On your tongue  
Gotta make that money  
Make that money listen sonny  
Learn to sting before your stung  
  
And I know  
Cause he told me so  
Told me so I believe him  
I still believe  
Give me that money  
  
Controlling all your cash  
I could make you live in trash  
I eat pheasant you eat hash  
No philanthropy  
But when its time for me to croak  
Bury me with all my dough  
And where there shouldve been an oak  
My private money tree will grow  
  
Make that money  
Said make that money  
Make that money run like honey  
On your tongue  
  
Told me so  
Told me so  
He told me so
