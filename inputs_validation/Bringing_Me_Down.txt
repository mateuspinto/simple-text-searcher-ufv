Day after day its the same  
Why do we play these games  
Reaching out for something true  
Questioning all that I do  
Gotta get back gotta get back  
Never gonna be the same cause I covered my tracks  
Name of the game feel the pain  
Look into my eyes and youll see no pain  
Everything will come right back to you  
Everything you put me through  
  
I cant breathe  
Will someone see me  
Suffocate  
My bodys weakness  
I cant breathe  
Get out before its too late  
You know its pulling me down  
  
Why do I feel so alone  
So close yet so far from home  
One thing I know I believe  
On until after they bleed  
Sin is through sin is through  
Coming on to me while Im coming on to you  
Never look away never look away  
Cause once you slip youre out of my way  
Practice this one thing I say  
Never let this get away from me  
  
I cant breathe  
Will someone see me  
Suffocate  
My bodys weakness  
I cant breathe  
Get out before its too late  
  
I cant breathe will someone see me  
Suffocate  
My bodys weakness  
I cant breathe  
Get out before its too late  
  
You know its pulling me down x9  
  
Never give up never give up  
Never turn away or Ill be fucking you up x2  
  
Gotta get back gotta get back  
Never gonna be the same cause I covered my tracks  
Feel the pain feel the pain  
I dont need a mask to see your pain  
Sin is through sin is through  
Youre coming on to me while Im coming on to you  
Never look away never look away  
Once you slip youre out of my way  
  
I cant breathe will someone see me  
Suffocate  
My bodys weakness  
I cant breathe  
Get out before its too late  
You know its pulling me down  
  
I cant breathe  
Will someone see me  
Suffocate  
My bodys weakness  
I cant breathe  
Get out before its too late  
  
You know its pulling me down
