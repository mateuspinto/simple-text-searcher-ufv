Never be afraid to love  
Never be afraid to just be  
Just cast away the chains of doubt  
Have the courage to be free  
  
Dont cloud your rise with fathers lies  
See only what you want to see  
To supplicate the simple truth  
Have the courage to be free  
  
Open your eyes you can fly  
Open your eyes you can fly  
You can fly uh uh  
You can fly  
  
Never be afraid to love no no no  
Never be afraid to just be  
Cast away the chains of doubt  
Have the courage to be free  
  
Open your eyes you can fly fly away

You cant wait for others to applaud what you do  
So just congratulate yourself  
And start something new
