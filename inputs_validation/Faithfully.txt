Some say its just the nature of the beast  
When you love somebody so passionately  
Time has a way of stealing  
That raging fire youre feeling  
Leaving the ashes laying at your feet  
  
Those fools of little faith will never know  
Those higher places two hearts can go  
Where time is standing still  
And love will burn until  
The heaven and the earth have come and gone  
  
This fire inside for you  
Is constant as the northern star  
And you will be  
Forever in my heart  
As long as theres a river  
Searching for an endless sea  
I will always love you  Faithfully  
  
Tonight well raise a glass to lovers  
Across the ages  
Well hold eahc other and toast to the day  
When historys said and done  
And well still stand as one  
Somethings were never meant to fade away  
  
This fire inside for you  
Is constant as the northern star  
And you will be  
Forever in my heart  
As long as theres a river  
Searching for an endless sea  
I will always love you  Faithfully
