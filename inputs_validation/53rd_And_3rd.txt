If you think you can well come on man  
I was a Green Beret in Vietnam  
I said no more of your fairy stories  
Cause I got my other worries  
  
53rd and 3rd standin on the street  
53rd and 3rd Im tryin to turn a trick  
53rd and 3rd youre the one they never pick  
53rd and 3rd dont it make you feel sick

Then I took out my razor blade  
Then I did what God forbade  
Now the cops are after me  
But I proved that Im no sissy
