M is for marriage each letter spells love  
A is alter where youre blessed from above  
are is for ring lovers faith set in gold

I is the infinite joy in the soul  
A is the answer to life and its goal  
G is the giving of love without end  
E is eternal thats marriage my friend  
  
D is the devil divorce is his game  
I is the innocent child you may shame  
V is for vow made to God and he heard  
O is the old love who meant every word

This is divorce think it over my friend
