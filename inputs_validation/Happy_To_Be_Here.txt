I put all my eggs in the bacon slicer  
But now its turned out fine  
In fact it couldnt be nice  
A nice Jewish girl and a bottle of cider  
Seven days later I was a man of the world  
 I thought  
Ill go and get a slice of pizza from the pizzeria  
Oh and a coke  
Has anybody got the change of five quid  
  
Im happy to be here  
So happy to be here  
And I wish that you were here  
Unhappy with me and happy to be here  
So happy to be here  
But youd had to have been there to be here  
With me  
  
I played a blinder against a gaggle of nuns  
I was all mouth and trousers they were fingers  
And thumbs had a lesson from the vicar on oral hygiene  
He was stitching my trousers and staring at  
Christine she had three tickets to see Alfie at the Odeon  
Whats it all about Christine  
Free you mind  
Yeah But what the  
Im happy to to be here  
So happy to be here  
And I wish that you were here  
Unhappy with me  
  
Im happy to be here  
So happy to be here  
But youd had to have been there to be here  
With me  
  
Im happy to be here  
So happy to be here  
How I wish that you were here  
Unhappy with me
