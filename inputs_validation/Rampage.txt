Slow down baby uhh  
Slow down baby uhh  
  
You can get rugged though hard like P  
Trying to play my man but you couldnt touch me  
You faggot to comp rapper on a quest  
You get your head flown boy you must be smokin sens  
So many often wonder if MDs paid  
Youre goddamn right punk stay outta my way  
Cause I clock Gs while you clock Zs  
And I dont smoke crack I smoke MCs  
So pick up a pen cop a squat and take notes  
A rapper suffred from bleeding sprains and slit throats  
My style deadly psychopath or schizophrenic  
Rapper choke like a curburetor freeze up and panic  
Cause I clock pesos dont sell ileyo  
Another name for cocaine mi amigo  
Thats Spanish terminology for friend  
Now sit back and rub my bozack as I send  
Bass funk with beats that thump  
Kickers and amps cold lined up in my trunk  
My system cranking my headlights are blinkin  
Brother ridin my tip L at the same time thinkin  
Damn how could a brother be so nice  
Cause Im the capital EP twice MDE twice  
I choose to squeeze some choose to fight  
I like to write but then again some bite  
While you were bangin on tables I was bangin Snow White  
  
Yeah slow down baby  
  
The ripper the master the overlordian  
Playing MCs like a old accordion  
I get the inspiration from a necessary station  
Them sayin I was vacationin  
You cant cope with your weakass throat  
Tryin a sneak a peak in while I freak the notes  
Major MCs become minor B flats  
So retire the mike get your chains and your bats  
Heres your chance to advance gettin your stance  
Im a shoot the holster off your cowboy pants  
Pure entertainment tonights your arraignment  
Youre quilty face down on the pavement  
No holds barred its time to get scarred  
You and your squad better praise the real god  
The undertaker droppin thunder on fakers  
When it comes to lyrics Im as freaky as Seka  
So lay the mike down slow and careful  
Cause mine is fully loaded and I have another handful  
A clip to slip in and start rippin  
Divin and dippin and givin punks a whippin  
Just in case you wanna go a few rounds and so  
Im down so that you clowns will know  
Me gettin burnt or hurt wont be tolerated  
I got rhymes up the huh forget it Im constipated  
  
Yeah slow down baby  
  
When I come around homeboy watch your nugget  
I master on the beat down my styles rugged  
When I attack the microphone close the zone  
Rap sees danger cant roam  
Security is packed and wall to wall cant fall  
A rap tank is full so I cant stall  
My microphone is filled with premium  
Any whack MC that flexes Im creamin em  
Not with lotion bust the motion flotation  
When Im rockin the mike Im like coastin  
Underneath fatigue at my peak  
You still seek the style cause yours is extra weak  
New method rip the stage at my age and get loose and kick  
Like Bruce in a rageIm on a rampage  
  
Yeah slow down baby  
Slow down baby
