Lamp unto my feet  
Light unto my path  
It is You  
Jesus It is You  
  
This treasure that I hold  
More than finest gold  
It is You  
Jesus It is You  
  
With all my heart  
With all my soul  
I live to worship You  
And praise forevermore  
Praise forevermore  
  
Lord everyday  
I need You more  
On wings of Heaven I will soar  
With You  
  
You take my brokenness  
And call me to yourself  
There You stand  
Healing in Your hand
