Im no longer counting Im not keeping score  
I could say my list of lovers doesnt matter anymore  
But some are always in my heart  
And some Im not so sure  
Either way they all left their mark  
And for some I found a cure  
  
Chorus  
From one you learn something  
Another you learn nothing  
And theres one who might teach you everything  
But before I learned to listen  
And if indeed someone said it  
Then I guess I must have lost it on the wind  
  
Back when I was younger each one was a prize  
Love just came along and hit you right between the eyes  
And one was just a trophy catch  
And one was like a curse  
Some would want to bleed you dry  
Some might quench your thirst  
  
Chorus x2  
  
In cold water I went fishing in warm seas I cast a line  
And swore the heart I was reeling in was perfect at the time  
You couldnt tell me I was wrong you couldnt tell me anything  
And if you did then I guess I must have lost it on the wind  
And if you did then I guess I must have lost it on the wind  
And if you did then I guess I must have lost it on the wind  
And if you did then I guess I must have lost it on the wind
