Passing through the corridor I came upon an aging knight  
Who leaned against the wall in gnarly armor  
He was on his way to see the king  
Wilson  
Wilson  
Wilson  
He led me through the streets of Prussia talking  
As he tried to crush a bug that scurried underneath his bootheel  
He said there was a place where we should go  
So he lead me through the forest to the edge of a lagoon by which  
We wandered til we reached a bubbly spring  
The knight grew very quiet as we stood there  
Then he lifted up his visor and he turned to me and he began to sing  
  
Chorus  
  
He said I come from the land of darkness  
I said I come from the land of doom  
He said I come from the land of Gamehendge  
From the land of the big baboon  
But Im never never going back there  
And I couldnt if I tried  
Cause I come from the land of Lizards  
And the Lizards they have died  
And the Lizards they have died  
And the Lizards they have died  
And the Lizards they have died  
  
He told me that the Lizards were a race of people practically extinct  
From doing things smart people dont do  
He said that he was once a Lizard too  
His name was Rutherford the Brave and he was on a quest to save  
His people from the fate that lay before them  
Their clumsy end was perilously near  
The Lizards would be saved he said if they could be enlightened  
By the writings of the Helping Friendly Book  
In all of Prussia only one existed  
And Wilson had declared that any person who possessed it was a crook  
  
Chorus  
  
The Helping Friendly Book it seemed possessed the ancient secrets  
Of eternal joy and neverending splendor  
The trick was to surrender to the flow  
We walked along beneath the moon  
He lead us through the bush till soon  
We saw before our eyes a raging river  
He said that we could swim it if we tried  
And saying this the knight dove in forgetting that his suit of arms  
Would surely weigh him down and so he sunk  
And as his body disappeared before me  
I bowed my head in silence and remembered all thoughts that he had thunk  
  
Chorus  
  
But Rutherford and Forbin werent alone And suddenly an unexpected movement
caught his eye On the far side of the river he saw a shaggy creature standing
in the weeds who stared across at Forbin with an unrelenting gaze A gigantic
mass of muscles and claws The hideous beast reared back and hurled himself in
the water and swam toward the region where Rutherford lay And in a flash the
beast was gone underneath the surface to the frosty depths below while
Forbin bewildered waited alone The seconds dragged by in what seemed like
hours till finally the colonel felt it all had been a dream Defeated he
bowed his head then turned to go Suddenly with a roar the creature emerged
before him and held the brave knights body to the sky And the creature laid
the knight upon the shore And the colonel fell beside his friend in prayer
that hed survive And Rutherford brave Rutherford was alive  
  
Forbin and the unit monster were crouched over the soggy knight carefully
removing his bulky helmet when the colonel heard a sound behind him He turned
around and came face to face with an enormous shaggy horselike creature
covered from head to tail with alternating blotches of brown and white It was
a twotoned multibeast and atop the multibeast sat the most beautiful woman
the colonel had ever seen After fiftytwo years of undaunted bachelorhood
the colonel felt a feeling rush over him as he had never felt before
