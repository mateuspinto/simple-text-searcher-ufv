The ladies will kick it the rhyme that is wicked  
Those that dont know how to be pros get evicted  
A woman can bear you break you take you  
Now its time to rhyme can you relate to  
A sister dope enough to make you holler and scream  
  
Ayo let me take it from here Queen  
Excuse me but I think Im about do  
To get into precisely what I am about to do  
Im conversating to the folks that have no whatsoever clue  
So listen very carefully as I break it down for you  
Merrily merrily merrily merrily hyper happy overjoyed  
Pleased with all the beats and rhymes my sisters have employed  
Slick and smooth throwing down the sound totally a yes  
Let me state the position Ladies first yes Yes  
  
Yeah theres going to be some changes in here  
  
Believe me when I say being a woman is great you see  
I know all the fellas out there will agree with me  
Not for being one but for being with one  
Because when its time for loving its the woman that gets some  
Strong stepping strutting moving on  
Rhyming cutting and not forgetting  
We are the ones that give birth  
To the new generation of prophets because its Ladies First  
  
I break into a lyrical freestyle  
Grab the mic look into the crowd and see smiles  
Cause they see a woman standing up on her own two  
Sloppy slouching is something I wont do  
Some think that we cant flow cant flow  
Stereotypes they got to go got to go  
Im a mess around and flip the scene into reverse  
With what With a little touch of Ladies First  
  
Who said the ladies couldnt make it you must be blind  
If you dont believe well here listen to this rhyme  
Ladies first theres no time to rehearse  
Im divine and my mind expands throughout the universe  
A female rapper with the message to send the  
Queen Latifah is a perfect specimen  
  
My sister can I get some  
  
Sure Monie Love grab the mic and get dumb  
  
Yo praise me not for simply being what I am  
Born in LONDON and sound American  
You dig exactly where Im coming from  
You want righteous rhyming Imma give you some  
To enable you to aid yourself and get paid  
And the material that has no meaning I wish to slay  
Pay me every bit of your attention  
Like mother like daughter I would also like to mention  
I wish for you to bring me to bring me to the rhythm  
Of which is now systematically given  
Desperately stressing Im the daughter of a sister  
Whos the mother of a brother whos the brother of another  
Plus one more all four  
Have a job to do we doing it  
Respect due to the mother whos the root of it  
And next up is me the MONIE LOVE  
And Im first cause Im a LADIE  
  
Contact and in fact the style it gets harder  
Cooling on the scene with my European partner  
Laying down track after track waiting for the climax  
When I get there thats when I tax  
The next man or the next woman  
It doesnt make a difference keep the competition coming  
And Ill recite the chapter in verse  
The title of this recital is Ladies First
