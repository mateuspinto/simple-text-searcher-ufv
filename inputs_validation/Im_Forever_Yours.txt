Verse 1  
I give my all to you  
Send me and I will go for you  
To the ends of the earth  
Ill follow after you  
I want the world to know  
Your love endures forever  
  
Verse 2  
Tell me and Ill obey  
This is far greater than sacrifice  
Trusting you and not myself  
Will always lead to blessing  
Lord have your way in me  
Not my will yours be done  
  
Chorus  
Here I stand within your presence  
Longing for your touch  
A thousand days cannot compare  
To one day in your courts  
  
Hold me now  
And never ever let me go  
My jesus my precious saviour  
Im forever yours  
  
Bridge  
I will worship you forever  
I will worship you 5x
