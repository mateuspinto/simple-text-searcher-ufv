I have a home  
Longing to roam  
I have to find you  
I have to meet you  
  
Sanctum your face  
Slowing your pace  
I need your guidance  
I need to seek my  
  
Innervision  
Innervision  
  
My pupils dance  
Lost in a trance  
Your sacred silence  
Losing all violence  
  
Stars in their place  
Mirror your face  
I need to find you  
I need to seek my  
  
Innervision  
Innervision  
  
Its never too late to reinvent the bicycle  
Small breaks for the new  
Giving you life  
Giving you force  
  
Its never too late to reinvent the bicycle  
Small breaks for the new  
Giving you life  
Giving you force  
  
Vision  
  
Innervision  
Innervision  
Innervision  
Innervision  
Innervision  
  
Your sacred silence  
Losing all violence
