Good morning good morning  
Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in  
Nothing to say but what a day hows your boy been  
Nothing to do its up to you  
Ive got nothing to say but its ok  
Good morning good morning  
  
Going to work dont want to go feeling low down  
Heading for home you start to roam then youre in town  
Everybody knows theres nothing doing  
Everything is closed its like a ruin  
Everyone you see is half asleep  
And youre on your own youre in the street  
  
After a while you start to smile now you feel cool  
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school  
Nothing had changed its still the same  
Ive got nothing to say but its ok  
Good morning good morning  
  
People running round its five oclock  
Everywhere in town is getting dark  
Everyone you see is full of life  
Its time for tea and meet the wife  
Somebody needs to know the time glad that Im here  
  
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now youre in gear  
Go to show you hope she goes  
Ive got nothing to say but its ok  
Good morning good morning
