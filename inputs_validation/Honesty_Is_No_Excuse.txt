Up till now I used to pass my time  
Drinking beer so slowly sometimes wine  
No God air water or sunshine  
And honesty was my only excuse  
I took your love and I used it  
Up till now my youthful stage  
A useless rage a torn out page a worn out gauge  
A dirty shade a big charade a has been made  
And honesty was my only excuse  
I took your love and I used it  
I never I never I never  
Up till now my love life  
Few sweet kisses a little missus a fork and knife  
A happy home a hand to hold a land to roam  
And honesty was my only excuse  
I used to take life in my own hands and I abused it  
Up till now I used to tap dance  
Take a girl by the hand saying  
I need your I need your romance  
Oh I had me many chances  
And honesty was my only excuse  
I used to take your love and Id abused it  
Up till now the path of life was fair enough  
Enough was fair all was right  
And now I know I see the light  
And honesty was my only excuse
