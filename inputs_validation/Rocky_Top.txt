Wish that I was on old Rocky Top  
Down in the Tennessee hills  
Aint no smoggy smoke on Rocky Top  
Aint no telephone bills  
  
Once I had a girl on Rocky Top  
Half bear the other half cat  
Wild as a mink but sweet as sodapop  
I still dream about that  
  
Rocky Top youll always be  
Home sweet home to me  
Good old Rocky Top  
Rocky Top Tennessee  
Rocky Top Tennessee  
  
Once two strangers climbed old Rocky Top  
Lookin for a moonshine still  
Strangers aint come down from Rocky Top  
Reckon they never will  
  
Corn wont grow at all on Rocky Top  
Dirts too rocky by far  
Thats why all the folks on Rocky Top  
Get their corn from jar  
  
Rocky Top youll always be  
Home sweet home to me  
Good old Rocky Top  
Rocky Top Tennessee  
Rocky Top Tennessee  
  
Ive had years of cooped up city life  
Trapped like a dog in a pen  
All I know is its a pity life  
Cant be simple again  
  
Rocky Top youll always be  
Home sweet home to me  
Good old Rocky Top  
Rocky Top Tennessee  
Rocky Top Tennessee  
Rocky Top Tennessee
