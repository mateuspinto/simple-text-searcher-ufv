And I could easily fall from grace  
Then another would take my place  
For the chance to behold your face  
  
As the days of my life are but grains of sand  
As they fall from your open hand  
At the call of the winds command  
  
Many words are spoken when theres nothing to say  
The fall upon the ears of those who dont know the way  
To read between the lines that lead between the lines that lead me to you  
  
All that I ask you  
Is show me how to follow you and Ill obey  
Teach me how to reach you I cant find my own way  
Let me see the light let me be the light  
  
As the sun turns slowly around the sky  
Till the shadow of night is high  
The eagle will learn to fly  
  
As the days of his life are but grains of sand  
As they fall from your open hand  
And vanish upon the land  
  
Many words are spoken when theres nothing to say  
The fall upon the ears of those who dont know the way  
To read between the lines that lead between the lines that lead me to you  
Show me how to follow you and Ill obey  
Teach me how to reach you I cant find my own way  
Let me see the light let me be the light  
And so with no warning no last goodbye  
In the dawn of the morning sky  
The eagle will rise again
