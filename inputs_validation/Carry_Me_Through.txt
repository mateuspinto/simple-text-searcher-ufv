Time has come  
To start my search for tomorrow  
On and on  
Theres just no end to the sorrow  
But I designed a way  
To see my life through pity  
I dont have too much to say  
And the tears wont let me be  
  
So  
Chorus  
Carry me through the hard part  
Help me find a new start  
Carry me through the hard part  
  
Far too long  
Ive thought of all the excuses  
Try to go on  
And stay my time to an end  
Dreams in my head  
All turning dark and useless  
Help me find the hand  
That knows where Ive been  
  
Please  
Chorus  
  
Ahhhhhh   
Ahhhhhh   
  
Carry me through   
Carry me through   
Carry me through   
Carry me carry me carry me
