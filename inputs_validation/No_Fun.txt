No fun my babe no fun  
No fun my babe no fun  
No fun to hang around  
Feeling that same old way  
No fun to hang around  
Freaked out for another day  
No fun my babe no fun  
No fun my babe no fun  
No fun to be around  
Walking by myself  
No fun to be alone  
In love with nobody else  
Well maybe go out maybe stay home  
Maybe call mom on the telephone  
Well come on well come on  
Well come on
