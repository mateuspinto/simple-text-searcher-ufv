Wont you come into my room I want to show you all my wares  
I just want to see your blood I just want to stand and stare  
See the blood begin to flow as it falls upon the floor  
Iron Maiden cant be fought Iron Maiden cant be sought  
  
Chorus  
Oh Well wherever wherever you are  
Iron Maidens gonna get you no matter how far  
See the blood flow watching it shed up above my head  
Iron Maiden wants you for dead  
  
Wont you come into my room I want to show you all my wares  
I just want to see your blood I just want to stand and stare  
See the blood begin to flow as it falls upon the floor  
Iron Maiden cant be fought Iron Maiden cant be sought
