Taking stock of what I have and what I havent  
What do I find  
The things I got will keep me satisfied  
Checking up on what I have and what I havent  
What do I find  
A healthy balance on the credit side  
Got no diamond  
Got no pearl  
Still I think Im a lucky girl  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
Got no mansion  
Got no yacht  
Still Im happy with what I got  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
Sunshine  
Gives me a lovely day  
Moonlight  
Gives me the Milky Way  
Got no checkbooks  
Got no banks  
Still Id like to express my thanks  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
And with the sun in the morning  
And the moon in the evening  
Im all right

Got no mansion  
Got no yacht  
Still Im happy with what I got  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
Got no silver  
Got no gold  
What I got cant be bought or sold  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
Sunshine  
Gives me a lovely day  
Moonlight  
Gives me the Milky Way  
Got no checkbooks  
Got no banks  
Still Id like to express my thanks  
I got the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
And with the sun in the morning  
And the moon in the evening  
Im all right

Sunshine  
Gives me a lovely day  
Moonlight  
Gives me the Milky Way  
Got no heirlooms  
For my kin  
Made no will but when I cash in  
I leave the sun in the morning and the moon at night  
And with the sun in the morning  
And the moon in the evening theyre all right
