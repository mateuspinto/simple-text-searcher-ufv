Fell to my knees with a knife in my back  
Never thought youd be the kind to do something like that  
But you did  
Cold hearted  
  
You talked so sweet and your smell it made me weak  
And I fell so fast that I never thought to ask  
If you were  
Cold hearted  
  
An eye for an eye tooth for a tooth  
I want someone to hurt you make you die the way I do  
I dont think I could be so  
Cold hearted  
  
Pretty little words covered your dark and crooked heart  
With a forked tongue I fell in love  
Then I fell apart  
You are so  
Cold hearted  
  
Eye for an eye tooth for a tooth  
I want someone to hurt you make you die the way I do  
I dont think that I could be so  
Cold hearted  
  
An eye for an eye tooth for a tooth  
I want someone to hurt you make you die the way I do  
I dont think that I could be so  
Cold hearted
