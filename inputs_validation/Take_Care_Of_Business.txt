Dont talk just hold me closer  
Let me sit on top of your knee  
Go ahead and take care of business  
For me for me for me  
  
Oh Lord dont keep me waiting  
Be as firm as can be  
Go ahead and take care of business  
For me for me for me  
  
In all my life noone has touched me so close  
Nor made me feel so sweet  
I said to you you are Gods gift to all womanhood  
Take it from me take it from me  
  
You know you know that I love you truly  
And I want the whole round world to see  
How you can take care of business  
For me for me for me  
  
Go take care of business for me  
Yeah yeah go take care of business for me
