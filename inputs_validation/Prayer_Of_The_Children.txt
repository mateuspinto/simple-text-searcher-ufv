Can you hear the prayer of the children  
on bended knee in the shadow of an unknown room  
Empty eyes with no more tears to cry  
turning heavenward toward the light  
  
Crying Jesus help me  
to see the morning lightof one more day  
But if I should die before I wake  
I pray my soul to take  
  
Can you feel the hearts of the children  
aching for home for something of their very own  
Reaching hands with nothing to hold on to  
But hope for a better day a better day  
  
Crying Jesus help me  
to feel the love again in my own land  
but if unknown roads lead away from home  
give me loving arms away from harm  
  
Can you hear the voice of the children  
softly pleading for silence in a shattered world  
Angry guns preach a gospel full of hate  
blood of the innocent on their hands  
  
Crying Jesus help me  
to feel the sun again upon my face  
For when darkness clears I know youre near  
bringing peace again  
  
Dali cujete sve djecje molitive  
Croatian translation  
Can you hear all the childrens prayers  
Can you hear the prayer of the children
