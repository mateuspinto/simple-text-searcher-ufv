You used to raise your voice so that it could be heard  
You used to shout out your orders and your word was the final word  
Do as I say and not as I do  
Theyve taken your picture off the wall  
How does it feel to be the big daddy of them all  
  
You used to chase your women right into your home  
You used to tell them you loved them over the telephone  
Now they all see through you  
And youre sinking like a stone  
No ones knocking at your door  
No one calls  
How does it feel to be the big daddy of them all  
  
Youre sad and disgusted  
Is what youve grown up to be  
Bet you had no idea what your dream would turn out to be  
But when you live for yourself  
Hell its hard on everyone  
But you did it your way and man you did it all  
How does it feel to be the big daddy of them all  
  
Now you did it your way and man you did it all  
How does it feel to be the big daddy of them all
