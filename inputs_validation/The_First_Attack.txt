Since I started being impressed  
By the things that move me  
All the treasures that I missed  
Came back to stand around me  
And as I curse the wasted time  
  
I lift my head to say  
Thank you god you gave the strength  
That helped me walk away  
All the fear and anger  
Still stays within my heart  
And I cant recall the last time  
I imagined theyd depart  
  
But this is what Im going to do  
When they force me to doubt  
Ill ask for what I know remains  
  
To help me sing them out  
As rays of sun shine through the clouds  
To heat the soaking ground  
So when we come to sing the shouts  
  
Well burn the theaters down  
Let every disbelieving sneer  
That looked me in the back  
Turn come towards us  
And feel the first attack
