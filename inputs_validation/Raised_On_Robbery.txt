He was sitting in the lounge of the Empire Hotel  
He was drinking for diversion  
He was thinking for himself  
A little money riding on the Maple Leafs  
Along comes a lady in lacy sleeves  
She says let me sit down  
You know drinkin alones a shame  
Its a shame its a crying shame  
Look at those jokers  
Glued to that damn hockey game  
Hey honeyyouve got lots of cash  
Bring us round a bottle  
And well have some laughs  
Gins what Im drinking  
I was raised on robbery  
  
Im a pretty good cook  
Im sitting on my groceries  
Come up to my kitchen  
Ill show you my best recipe  
I try and I try but I cant save a cent  
Im up after midnight cooking  
Trying to make my rent  
Im rough but Im pleasin  
I was raised on robbery  
  
We had a little money once  
They were pushing through a four lane highway  
Government gave us three thousand dollars  
You should have seen it fly away  
First he bought a 57 Biscayne  
He put it in the ditch  
He drunk up all the rest  
That son of a bitch  
His bloods bad whiskey  
I was raised on robbery  
  
You know you aint bad looking  
I like the way you hold your drinks  
Come home with me honey  
I aint asking for no full length mink  
Hey where you going  
Dont go yet  
Your glass aint empty and we just met  
Youre mean when your loaded  
I was raised on robbery
