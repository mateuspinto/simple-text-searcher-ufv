Coo coo roo coo coo paloma  
Tell her that Im oh so lonely     
Coo coo roo coo coo paloma  
Tell her that I love her only     
Please pretty little dove  
Hurry to my love tell her this for me     
Since she is far away  
Every day is sad blue as it can be     
I couldnt even start  
Pouring out my heart to her in a letter     
You pretty little bird  
You can sing the words you can tell her better     
Coo coo roo coo coo paloma  
Coo coo roo coo coo  Spanish   
Coo coo roo coo coo     
Coo coo roo coo coo     
Coo coo roo coo coo    paloma
