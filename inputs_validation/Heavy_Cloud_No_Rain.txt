Turned on the weather man just after the news  
I needed sweet rain to wash away my blues  
He looked at the chart but he looked in vain  
Heavy cloud but no rain  
  
Back in the time with Louis XVI  
At the court of the people he was number one  
Hed be the bluest blood theyd ever seen  
When the king said hi to the guillotine  
The royal astrologer was run out of breath  
He thought that maybe the rain would postpone his death  
He look in the sky but he look in vain  
Heavy cloud but no rain  
  
Well the land was cracking and the river was dry  
All the crops were dying when they ought to be high  
So to save his farm from the bankers draft  
The farmer took out a book on some old witchcraft  
He made a spell and a potion on a midsummers night  
He killed a brindled calf in the pale moonlight  
He prayed to the sky but he prayed in vain  
Heavy cloud but no rain  
Heavy cloud but no rain  
  
The sun wont shine til the clouds are gone  
The clouds wont go til their work is done  
And every morning youll hear me pray  
If only it would rain today  
  
I asked my baby if thered be some way  
She said shed save her love for a rainy day  
I look in the sky but I look in vain  
Heavy cloud but no rain
