You day breaks your mind aches  
You find that all her words  
of kindness linger on  
When she no longer needs you  
She wakes up she makes up  
She takes her time and doesnt  
feel she has to hurry  
She no longer needs you  
  
And in her eyes you see nothing  
No sign of live behind the tears  
Cried for no one  
A love that should have lasted years  
  
You want her you need her  
And yet you dont believe her  
When she says her love is dead  
You think she needs you  
  
And in her eyes you see nothing  
No sign of live behind the tears  
Cried for no one  
A love that should have lasted years  
  
You stay home she goes out  
She says that long ago she knew someone  
but now hes gone  
She doesnt need him  
your day breaks your mind aches  
There will be times when all the things  
she said will fill your head  
You wont forget her  
  
And in her eyes you see nothing  
No sign of live behind the tears  
Cried for no one  
A love that should have lasted years
