Red One  
MrWorldwide  
From Miami Morocco to Austrailia  
To the world dale  
  
Run em like run em run em woop  
Run em like run em run em woop  
  
When the sun goes down down down down  
Boy are you afraid of the dark dark  
And when the lights go out out out out  
Tell me do you know where to start start  
And when the bass gets loud loud loud  
That is when I feel a part part  
And when the world screams sound sound sound  
Where the sound is the key to my heart heart  
  
Chorus  
We run yes the we run the night ninight night nininight  
We run yes the we run the night wewewe run wewewe run run

From the bottom of the map Miami  
To the land down under Australia  
You feel my drive see my vision and hear my hunger  
As my money gets older theirs get younger  
They sell their soul but the Devil knows I have no number  
Im go go baby fresh oh baby go go baby uh oh baby no no baby  
Yeah yeah baby now jiggle it baby let me tickle it baby

Brushing past me all over my skin skiiiin

Cause the beat keep pullin me in in  
Takin me so high up up up  
A place that Ive never been aah  
Party party all night night night  
Sleep all day then do it again gain
