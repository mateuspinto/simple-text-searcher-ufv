All my life  
Theyve been here  
Waiting for you  
Patiently  
They want your tears to fall  
All they want is your purest sin  
All they want is your heart and soul  
They want to welcome you in  
Innocent  
But they will lead you  
Back to me  
They will seem  
All they need is one tortured soul  
They need walking shadows  
All they need is your last confession  
They need your pain to show me  
Im waiting for the unforgiven  
Waiting for you to come home  
Waiting for sleep to come  
I waiting for my one obsession  
  
Innocence is pain in disguse  
They said  
Now I believe
