Prepare for battle wait for the time to arrive  
Unleashing the fury a gift to me and my kind  
Suffer little damage only the strong will survive  
The gift we are given will carry us through the fight  
  
These are the days of thunder and rage  
We cry our battle hail  
The time has come We take the stage  
Unleash The beast within  
  
Attack  
  
Unleash the weak lay down by my side  
To my own memories a warrior end is mine  
Accepting the challenge destroy those who stand in our way  
Reaction to late haha Now youll pay  
  
Unleash the beast  
  
 The gates of hell have opened for you  
 Forever The kingdom of  
Ashes to ashes The enemies that hide in the night  
The time has come for you to run long live the beast tonight  
  
Divide and conquer the roar of the crowd fills the air  
Raise high your hands a claim to the battle we share  
Ememy soldiers they run try to hide from my sight  
 The weapons to carry us through the fight  
To carry us through the fight
