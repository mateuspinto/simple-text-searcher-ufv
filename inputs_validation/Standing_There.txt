STANDING THERE  
Have you ever been strong  
Have you ever known when its time to walk away  
Just walk away yeah  
Well I couldnt wait to see you  
I was listening by the phone there  
When you called  
When you called and said what you said  
All this time  
All this time with the fighting and screaming  
Its breaking me its taken its toll on me  
And its like where standing there  
Hand in hand  
Just waiting for the ground to give way  
Waiting for the right words to say  
So take your chance  
And dont hold back  
Cause time is all weve got around here  
Time for me to wake up and see you standing there  
Youre beautiful just standing there  
Have you ever crossed the line  
Cause theres nothing I wouldnt do for love  
For this kind of love yeah  
Im trying to reach out  
Trying to make you make you understand it  
Understand the things that Id like between you and me cause  
All this time  
All this time with the fighting and screaming  
Its breaking me its taken its toll on me  
And its like where standing there  
Hand in hand  
Just waiting for the ground to give way  
Waiting for the right words to say  
So take your chance  
And dont hold back  
Cause time is all weve got around here  
Time for me to wake up and see you standing there  
Youre beautiful just standing there
