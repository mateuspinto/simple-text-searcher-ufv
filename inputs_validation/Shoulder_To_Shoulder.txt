We stand shoulder to shoulder  
We see eye to eye  
We dive deep under water  
We jump high in the sky  
  
We stand shoulder to shoulder  
We stand side to side  
When one of us gets a tiny bit tired  
One gives the other a ride  
  
Ive never had a best friend before  
So I cant be sure what it feels like  
But I think it feels more like this  
I think I feel more like myself  
When Im with you  
  
Finding losing and finding  
Losing and finding  
Making a bond that is strong  
Building a house for our friendship  
Breathing a breath for our song  
For our song
