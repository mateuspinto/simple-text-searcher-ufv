When I left Havana nobody saw me go  
But my little gaucho maid who loves me so  
She came down the pathway following after me  
That same little gaucho maid that I longed to see  
If at your window you see a gentle dove  
Treat it with care and welcome it there with love  
It may be so I do not deny its glee  
Crown it with flowers grant love its hours for me  
  
Oh my darling be mine  
Wont you say that you love me  
All my passions so tender oh please surrender your love divine  
  
Ah my darling be mine  
Wont you say that you love me  
Oh my passions so tender oh please surrender your love divine  
  
Oh my darling be mine  
Wont you say that you love me  
All my passions so tender oh please surrender your love divine
