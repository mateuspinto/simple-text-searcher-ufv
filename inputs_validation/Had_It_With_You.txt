I love you dirty fucker  
Sister and a brother  
Moaning in the moonlight  
Singing for your supper  
Cause I had it I had it I had it with you  
I had it I had it I had it with you  
  
You always seem to haunt me  
Always try to haunt me  
Serving out injunctions  
Shouting out instructions  
But I had it I had it I had it with you  
I had it I had it I had it with you  
I had it I had it I had it with you  
  
And I love you with a passion  
In and out of fashion  
Always got behind you  
When other tried to blind you  
But I had it I had it I had it with you  
I had it I had it I had it with you  
I had it I had it I had it with you  
  
It is such a sad thing  
To watch a good love die  
Ive had it up to here babe  
Ive got to say goodbye  
Cause I had it I had it I had it with you  
And I had it I had it I had it with you  
  
Loved you in the lean years  
Loved you in the fat ones  
Youre a mean mistreater  
Youre a dirty dirty rat scum  
I had it I had it I had it with you  
I had it I had it I had it with you  
I had it I had it I had it with you  
I had it with you  
I had it with you  
I had it with you
