If you could only hear  
The silent screams  
When you wake them up  
From their dreams  
Nothing is heard  
Not even a  
Even a  
Even a word  
  
Rock a bye baby  
On the tree top  
When the bough breaks  
The cradle will fall  
  
Rock rock rock a bye baby  
Rock rock rock bye bye  
  
And if they had  
Any chance at all  
You still cant hear  
Those voices that call  
And when the bough breaks  
The cradle will  
Cradle will  
Cradle will fall
