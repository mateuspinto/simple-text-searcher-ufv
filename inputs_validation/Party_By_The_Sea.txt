Im a take you to a place  
Where the troubles Im the base  
Where everybodys fine  
And theres no color line  
The only thing we see  
Is the party by the sea  
So lets call the refugee  
  
Vole Vole Vole Vole  
Pompe Pompe Pompe Pompe  
Sote Sote Sote  
Mete main nou anle  
Met main nou anle  
Mete main nou anle  
Met main nou anle  
  
If you come from the Caribbeans  
Lets show them how we do it  
Throw your flags in the air and wave it  
Ladies while you shake it break it   
Ladies while you shake it break it
