Holly holy eyes  
Dream of only you  
Where I am what I am  
What I believe in Holly holy  
Holly holy dream  
Wanting only you  
And she comes  
And I run just like the wind will  
Holly holy  
Sing a song  
Sing a song of songs  
Sing it out  
Sing it strong  
Call the sun in the dead of the night  
And the suns gonna rise in the sky  
Touch a man who cant walk upright  
And that lame man hes gonna fly  
And I fly  
And I fly  
Holly holy love  
Take the lonely child  
And the seed  
Let it be filled with tomorrow  
Holly holy  
Sing a song  
Sing a song of songs  
Sing it out  
Sing it strong  
Call the sun in the dead of the night  
And the suns gonna rise in the sky  
Touch a man who cant walk upright  
And that lame man hes gonna fly  
And I fly yeah  
And I fly  
Holly holy dream  
Dream of only you  
Holly holy love  
Holly holy love
