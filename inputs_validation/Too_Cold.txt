All right stop collaborate and listen  
Ice is back I got a brand new invention  
Something grabs a hold of me tightly  
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly  
Will it ever stop YoI dont know  
Now turn off the lights huh and Ill glow  
And to the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal  
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle  
  
Too cold too cold  
Too cold too cold  
Too cold too cold  
Too cold  
  
but you be talkin that shit  
  
Dance bum rush the speaker that booms  
Im killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom  
Deadly now as I play a dope melody  
Anything less than the best is a felony  
Love it or leave it you better gain way  
You better hit the bulls eye the kid dont play  
And if there was a problem yo Ill solve it  
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it  
  
Ice ice baby ice ice baby  
Ice ice baby ice ice baby  
  
Take heed cause Im a lyrical poet  
Miamis on the scene just in case you didnt know it  
My town that created all the bass sound  
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground  
cause my style is like a chemical spill  
Feasible rhymes you can vision and feel  
Conducted and formed this is a hell of a concept  
We make it hype and know you want to step with this  
Swamp plays on the fade slice like a ninja  
Cut like a razor blade so fast other djs say damn  
If rhyme was a drug you know Id sell it by the gram  
Keep my composure when its time to get loose  
Magnetized by the mic and when I kick my juice  
And if there was a problem you know that I would solve it  
Check out the hook while my dj revolves it  
  
Ice ice baby throw your hands in the air let me know youre out there  
Ice ice baby ice ice baby  
throw your hands in the air let me know youre out there  
Ice ice baby too fuckin cold  
Too cold too cold too cold too cold  
Ice ice baby  
Too cold too cold  
Ice ice baby  
Too cold too cold  
Ice ice baby  
Too cold too cold  
Ice ice baby  
Too cold too cold
