Write me a royalblue parchment poem  
Draw me a royalblue lady like me  
Draw me a smile  
Thats a lot like my own  
And make my eyes flowers  
And make my mind see  
I will weave melodies only for you  
And color them silver and saffron and blue  
  
Build me a window to watch everything  
Leave it unshuttered so nothing slips by  
No season no sorrow no wonderful thing  
No raspberry strawberry sun in the sky  
I will bring music and marsipan bars  
And live deep inside you  
Wherever you are  
  
Teach me the ways of the Gemini twin  
Show me the love that he says without words  
Bring me his laughter again and again  
The silence is singing the quiet is heard  
I will find harmonies waiting unsung  
With two souls to sing them  
Where once there was one
