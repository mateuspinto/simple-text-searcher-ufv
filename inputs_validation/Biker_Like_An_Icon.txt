There was a girl who loved a biker  
She used to follow him across America  
But the biker didnt like her  
  
She didnt care she still persisted  
Though her brother said she was twisted  
And the family said they wouldnt miss her  
Anyway  
  
She loved the biker like an icon  
Gazing at his picture everyday  
She loved the biker like an icon  
Slowly watching precious water drip away  
  
She did her best to fix a meeting  
She pulled it off one night in Hollywood  
When he met her he couldnt let her get away  
  
He didnt ask for her permission  
He took advantage of her position  
But he was always her ambition  
Anyway  
  
She loved the biker like an icon  
Gazing at his picture everyday  
She loved the biker like an icon  
Slowly watching precious water drip away  
  
The family tried so hard to find her  
They Showed Her Picture across America  
But No Trace Of Her Sweet Face  
Was Ever Found  
  
She Loved The Biker Like An Icon  
Gazing At His Picture Everyday  
She Loved The Biker Like An Icon  
Slowly Watching precious water drip away
