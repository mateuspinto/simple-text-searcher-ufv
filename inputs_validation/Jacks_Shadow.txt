They dragged Jack and his shadow  
From the hole  
And the bulb that burned above him  
Did shine both day and night  
And his shadow learned to love his  
Little darks and greater light  
And the sun it shined  
And the sun it shined  
And the sun it shined  
A little longer  
Jack wept and kissed his shadow  
Goodbye  
Spat from their dirty dungeons  
Into a truly different din  
Shat from their institutions  
Into a fully different din  
And his shadow soon became a wife  
And children plagued his latter life  
Until one night he took a skinning knife  
And stole into the town  
And tracked his shadow down  
Said the shadow to Jack Henry  
Whats wrong  
Jack said A home is not a hole  
And shwdow youre just a gallow that I hang my body from  
O Shadow your a shackle from wich my time is never done  
Then he peeled his shadow off in strips  
He peeled his shadow off in strips  
Then kneeled his shadow on some steps  
And cried What have I done  
And the sun it shined  
And the sun it shined  
I say Love is blind  
And is it any wonder  
And is it any wonder  
Jacked and his damned shadow  
Is gone  
And though each one of us are want to duly mourn  
And though each one of us are want to duly mourn  
Tis done in brighter corners now  
Tis done in brighter corners now  
Now that Jacks black shadows gone  
And the sun it shined  
And the sun it shined  
And the sun it shined  
A little stronger  
I swear love is blind  
Ooh love is blind  
Yeah love is blind  
And is it any wonder  
Tis done in brighter corners now  
Tis done in brighter corners now  
Now that Jacks black shadows gone  
Etcetera Etcetera
