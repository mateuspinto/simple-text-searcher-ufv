Wish you told me by and by  
That my life would come to this  
That Id have to find a way  
to let things go  
That my friends would turn to foes  
And my love would come to blows  
Then I would have done some things  
differently  
  
Differently  
I would ask you out every night  
Differently  
And I would make you feel so good  
Differently  
And appreciate the things that  
you bring to me babe  
Differently  
Oh yes I would oh yeah  
  
Yeah I know you tried and tried  
But your signal I just missed  
When you said my little girl  
would soon be gone  
Yes I didnt hear you then  
And it might be too late now  
Thats another thing Id do  
differently  
  
Differently  
Like trying to make you feel  
loved every day  
Differently  
And saying little things to  
let you know how I feel  
Differently  
Yes I can hear your young  
voice calling me babe  
Differently  
Oh yes I can  
  
When I m away I call you up  
And you dont seem to miss me as much  
But I know our love  
is still there in your heart  
Just differently  
  
Differently  
Oh yes I can hear your young  
voice calling me babe  
Differently  
Oh yes I can  
Differently  
Id appreciate the things that you  
bring to me babe yes I would  
Differently  
Oh come on back to me babe  
bring your love back to me  
Differently  
Oh yeah I need your love  
I need your love  
Differently  
Yes I can tell you babe  
I need your love  
Differently  
Today is a brand new day yes it is  
Differently  
Got to get your love back babe  
come on now bring it back to me  
Differently  
Turn it around babe turn it  
around and bring it back  
Differently  
Yeah yeah oh yeah got to get  
your love back come on babe  
Differently  
Yeah I can hear your young  
voice calling me babe  
Differently  
Come on back to me come on back

Differently  
Oh yes I can yes I can
