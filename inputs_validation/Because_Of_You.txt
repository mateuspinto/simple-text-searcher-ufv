Well I see the color in your eyes  
They set me free  
They get me high  
No sister flower  
Will be denied girl  
The heat of affection  
A fragile mind  
  
Because of you  
Uh now  
My dreams came true  
Uh  
Because of you  
Because of you  
Uh now  
My dreams came true  
Because of you  
  
And I feel the warmth in your tough  
My ego trips  
I cant get enough  
That satisfaction  
Lies in your hands girl  
I wrote this song  
So youll understand  
  
Because of you  
Uh now  
My dreams came true  
Uh  
Because of you  
Because of you  
Uh now  
My dreams came true  
Uh  
Because of you  
  
Because of you  
Uh now  
Because of you  
Uh now  
  
Because of you  
Uh now  
My dreams came true  
Uh  
Because of you  
Because of you  
Uh now  
My dreams came true  
Because of you  
Because of you  
Uh  
My dreams came true  
Because of you  
Because of you  
Because of you  
Because of you
