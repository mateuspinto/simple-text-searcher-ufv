oh oh oh oh oh  
  
penny pitching on the walk  
waiting for the bus to arrive  
me and Davy playing sport  
watching for the cops to go by  
  
spider man and the human torch  
they cover Barneys newsstand  
morning crowds start to gather round  
fast finger steals what he can  
  
morning leaves for the afternoon  
the boys show up on time  
in the streets near the peoples store  
below the electrical sign  
  
catch a glimpse of a passing car  
raced and ready to drag  
then the skirts start to tantalize  
the boys how they boast and they brag  
  
oh the earl of Roseland  
oh the earl of Roseland  
  
where has he gone  
a memory at dawn  
youre just a bit of the past  
  
guitar solo  
  
oh oh oh oh  
oh the earl of Roseland  
oh the earl of Roseland  
  
me and Davy gazing back  
see ourselves as we were  
how we laugh when we think of things  
that we did yesteryear  
  
I can see Charlie on the porch  
Johnny clicking his sticks  
and two boys I dont even know  
rehearsing electric string tricks  
ya ya ya ya ya ya  
  
oh the earl of Roseland  
oh the earl of Roseland  
oh the earl of Roseland  
oh the earl of Roseland  
oh the earl of Roseland  
oh the earl of Roseland  
oh the earl of Roseland  
oh the earl of Roseland
