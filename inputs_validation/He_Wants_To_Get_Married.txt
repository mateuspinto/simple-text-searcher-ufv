Sandy Knox Anthony Little  
  
He believes in the family unit  
The union of man and wife  
He believes that you stand before God  
For better for worse and beyond this life  
  
He believes that a ring on his finger  
Is something to be proud of  
For all of the world to witness  
That he is committed to this love  
  
He wants to get married  
  
Hell build a house in the country  
Where hell watch his children grow  
And teach them the values of something  
That most people never even know  
  
He wants to get married  
  
I never thought I would be so blessed  
To know a man like this  
Hes everything everything I believe that a man should be  
  
And when he is called to his maker  
He wants to go to his grave  
With his final remembrance of this earth  
To be one last look at his wifes face  
  
He wants to get married  
He wants to get married  
Oh he wants to get married  
  
But not to me
