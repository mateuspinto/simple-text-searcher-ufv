We are the tyrants  
Messengers of Satan  
We pledge you all  
Raise your hands  
This is the solstice  
Hail legions arise  
Well raise the roof  
Touch the skies  
  
Were praying for  
The wings of Mayhem to arrive  
The screaming fury burns  
Brings us alive  
  
Stand up and be counted  
Stand up and be counted  
  
We are the demons  
Children of fire  
Your turn has come  
Live your desire  
Burning ambition  
Were were staying wild  
We stand as one never denied  
  
Defyant and proud  
We stand together  
Metlallic and loud we will fight  
Devestation pure Hell  
Legions of the night  
  
Stand up and be counted  
Stand up and be counted  
  
Come on raise your hands  
  
We are the black metal gods  
  
V E N O Fucking M  
  
Are you with us  
Right until the end  
  
Stand up and be counted  
Stand up and be counted  
  
Come on right at the back  
You want to be counted as well  
Stand up  
And be counted
