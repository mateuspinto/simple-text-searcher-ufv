When Im all alone on a distant path  
And my ticket home  
Has been torn in half  
Oh I can hear your voice girl  
I can feel your touch  
Across the miles tonight  
  
On the road again will it always be  
That the dream has changed  
On its way to reality  
Oh but the thought of you  
Strange how it pulls me through  
Across the miles tonight  
  
And I am sending you this message  
Through the wires tonight  
Just close your eyes and hold on tight  
And here I am concentrating girl  
With all my might  
Now the sound of your laughter  
Trails off through the midnight sky  
  
As the miles go by cities come and go  
When you close your eyes  
And listen to the radio  
Girl can you hear my song  
The signal is clear and strong  
Across the miles tonight  
  
And I am sending you this message  
Through the wires tonight  
Just close your eyes and hold on tight  
And here I am concentrating girl  
With all my might  
Now the sound of your laughter  
Trails off across the miles
