In the middle of our summer romance  
He walked up to her and he asked her to dance  
I could see the old love light in her eyes  
See the love light in her eyes  
  
It took a while to say hows your new love babe  
  
My heart was beating with a rage like thunder  
And when I saw him I began to wonder  
I could see the old love light in his eyes  
See the love light in his eyes  
  
It took a while to say hows your new love babe  
Hows your new love babe  
  
Well in the middle of our summer romance  
He walked up to her he said Please give me another chance  
I could see the old love light in her eyes  
See the love light in her eyes  
  
It took a while to say hows your new love babe  
Yes it did it did it did  
  
It took a while to say hows your new love babe  
Took a while to say hows your new love babe
