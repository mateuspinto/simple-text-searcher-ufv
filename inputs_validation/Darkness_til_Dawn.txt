Chain smoking cigarettes  
Enemies across the table  
Wonderin if I can ever trust anyone again  
We argue through the night  
the restaurant shuts you catch your flight  
I hail a cab with no idea where home might be  
  
We both believed my chance was gone  
But aint it strange how life goes on  
A storm can never rage forever  
And darkness only lasts til dawn  
  
Hotel blinds stay down  
Nothing seems to make me care  
I cant find a reason to comb my hair  
Folks walkin in the street  
Everyone has something to do  
My brain wont stop showin those old movies of you  
  
Weeks pass  
And your voice sounds strange on the telephone  
Strange how smooth and casual my own voice sounds  
I find that Im listening to  
A tune coming over my radio  
It makes me think of a guy I knew a while ago  
A while ago a while ago
