Spoken intro  
I first heard this from Ric von Schmidt He lives in Cambridge  
Ric is a blues guitar player  
I met him one day in the green pastures of Harvard University  
  
Baby let me follow you down baby let me follow you down  
Well Ill do anything in this God almighty world  
If you just let me follow you down  
  
Can I come home with you baby can I come home with you  
Yes Ill do anything in this God almighty world  
If you just let me come home with you  
  
Baby let me follow you down baby let me follow you down  
Well Ill do anything in this God almighty world  
If you just let me follow you down  
  
Yes Ill do anything in this God almighty world  
If you just let me follow you down
