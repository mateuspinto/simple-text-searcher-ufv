Borne on the wind borne on the wind  
Between the sunset and the dawn  
So tenderly your memory  
Lingers with me on and on  
  
Borne on the wind borne on the wind  
You are still with me it seems  
A life to live a love to give  
And you will live in my dreams  
  
You dont love me  
But your love for me to be in love with you  
You led me on lured me on  
But when I fell you were gone  
  
Borne on the wind borne on the wind  
Now a song in my heart  
A soft refrain you will remain  
To live again and again  
  
Borne on the wind  
Borne on the wind  
Borne on the wind
