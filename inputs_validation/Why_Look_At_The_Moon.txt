Willows were swaying  
The water was rippling  
The froggies were singing  
  
Along with the laughing at the bank  
We have the moon to thank  
For this lovely scene we might never have seen  
If it hadnt been for the moon  
  
Why look at that moon  
  
Away up high seeing everything  
That goes by why look at that moon  
Why why why look at the moon  
Why why why look at the moon  
  
Sitting in the desert  
Beneath a lonesome sky  
Cool my oh my it would be  
  
If it never have been above  
That fateful little boy  
That one who has beheld  
True love through history  
  
Why must it start  
Why must the lovers part  
And why does the cheatin go on  
Why have hearts turned to stone  
  
Why look at that moon  
  
Away up high seeing everything  
That goes by why look at that moon  
Why why why look at the moon  
Why why why look at the moon  
  
Why look at that moon  
Aint it grand  
Why look at that moon  
Helps me understand  
  
Why look at that moon  
Inspirator of many a dream  
Why look at that moon
