Blessed Gods Cold Stars release me from my long suffering  
Anxious Weary my Mind wracked by Fears unnatural I Scan The Horizon  
Watching hoping for Signs of the Signal Fire  
Great Gift of Prometheus reward me with the news that Troy has  
Finally Fallen  
It is She who commands me thus to remain upon this Palace roof  
Watching waiting that willful calculating Woman who plots  
And Schemes like a King  
No sleep no Dreams only Fear descends upon my couch and Ravages  
My Heart  
Yes Sorrow and Fear for whats become of this House  
Once so Great now lost and cold Hungry Spirits stalk these Halls  
But still Ill keep my Faith and Pray for our release from all  
This suffering  
Look there at last Conquest Great Blaze of Triumph  
I Greet thee I Honour thee most Welcome Visitor from the Depths  
Of the Night  
Rape the Sky like a Royal Sun turn this Mournful Night into  
Shining Day  
Awake Queen of Agamemnon rise from thy sleep  
Cry the Morning Song of Victory for the Kingdom of Ilion has Fallen  
The God of Fire proclaims it so  
Well reap this Harvest of Flame give Thanks and Pay Tribute  
To the Deities that made us  
Oh let it be so let our Fleet return in Honour  
Over Lord Poseidons Sea safe from Wind and Storm  
Let me stand before my King and Pledge him Sword and Life for his Glory  
A Thorn grips my voice no more from me now  
Yet if this House could speak what a Tale it could tell  
Of Savage Murder Betrayal Ravenous Feasting and a Daimon with an  
Unquenchable thirst for Blood and Torn Flesh  
No no more from me let actions speak AWAKE
