I have traveled many moonless nights  
Cold and weary with a babe inside  
And I wonder what Ive done  
Holy father you have come  
And chosen me now to carry your son  
  
I am waiting in a silent prayer  
I am frightened by the load I bear  
In a world as cold as stone  
Must I walk this path alone  
Be with me now  
Be with me now  
  
Breath of heaven  
Hold me together  
Be forever near me  
Breath of heaven  
Breath of heaven  
Lighten my darkness  
Pour over me your holiness  
For you are holy  
Breath of heaven  
  
Do you wonder as you watch my face  
If a wiser one should have had my place  
But I offer all I am  
For the mercy of your plan  
Help me be strong  
Help me be  
Help me  
  
Breath of heaven  
Hold me together  
Be forever near me  
Breath of heaven  
Breath of heaven  
Lighten my darkness  
Pour over me your holiness  
For you are holy  
  
Breath of heaven  
Hold me together  
Be forever near me  
Breath of heaven  
Breath of heaven  
Lighten my darkness  
Pour over me your holiness  
For you are holy  
Breath of heaven  
Breath of heaven  
Breath of heaven
