The last days in may  
Before summer lay claim  
Back in the school yard  
We made up a game  
Now is always  
Is always the same  
Too bad always always ends  
  
I remember  
I remember when  
But I was just  
Just a boy  
Then  
  
Innocent envy  
Without compromise  
Recommendations  
All ill advised  
Tall tales  
And little white lies  
The truth had to bend  
  
I remember  
I remember when  
But I was just  
Just a boy  
Then  
  
Now that were tall  
And all grown  
A house a car  
Lives of our own  
We put off  
But we cant postpone  
The way we become men  
  
I remember  
I remember when  
But I was just  
Just a boy  
Then
