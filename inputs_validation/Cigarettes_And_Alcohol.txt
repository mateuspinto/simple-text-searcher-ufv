Is it my imagination  
Or have I finally found something worth living for  
I was looking for some action  
But all I found were cigarettes and alcohol  
  
You could wait for a lifetime  
To spend your days in the sunshine  
You might as well do the white line  
Cause when it comes on top  
  
You gotta make it happen  
Is it worth the aggravation  
To find yourself a job when theres nothing worth working for  
Its a crazy situation  
But all I need are cigarettes and alcohol  
  
You could wait for a lifetime  
To spend your days in the sunshine  
You might as well do the white line  
Cause when it comes on top  
  
You gotta make it happen  
Cigarettes and alcohol Repeats
