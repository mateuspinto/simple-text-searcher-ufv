Welcome to my morning  
Welcome to my day  
Im the one responsible  
I made it just this way  
To make myself some pictures  
See what they might bring  
I think I made it perfectly  
I wouldnt change a thing  
  
Welcome to my happiness  
You know it makes me smile  
And it pleases me to have you here  
For just a little while  
While we open up the spaces  
Try to break some chains  
And if the truth is told  
They will never come again  
  
Welcome to my evening  
The closing of the day  
I could try a million times  
Never find a better way  
To tell you that I love you  
And all the songs I play  
Are to thank you for allowing me  
Inside this lovely day  
  
Welcome to my morning  
Welcome to my day  
Yes Im the one responsible  
I made it just this way  
To make myself some pictures  
And see what they might bring  
I think I made it perfectly  
I wouldnt change a thing  
  
Words and music by john denver
