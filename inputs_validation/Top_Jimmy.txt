Some friends of mine just the other night  
Went to hear this cool cat blow  
The say he sang so good that the roof fell in  
And they didnt even stop the show  
They dont remember the place but they remember the face  
And now everybody want to go  
  
Chorus  
Top Jimmy cooks Top Jimmy swings  
Hes got the look Top Jimmy hes the king  
Jimmy on the television famous people laughing with him  
Jimmy on the news at five  
Jimmy on the radio and even on the video  
That baddest cat alive  
Driving all the women crazy only want Jimmybaby  
Love it when he rolls his eyes  
  
Jukejoint Jimmy is the latest thing  
Hes got the sound that everybody digs  
And the joint been jumpin when the band been pumpin  
And you know theyre playing crazy gigs  
Well you aint been living till youve seen the living thing  
Top Jimmy and his Rhythm Pigs  
  
Chorus
