Well they took some honey from a tree  
Dressed it up and they called it me  
  
Everybodys trying to be my baby  
Everybodys trying to be my baby  
Everybodys trying to be my baby now  
  
Well half past nine half past four  
Fifty women knocking on my door  
  
Everybodys trying to be my baby  
Everybodys trying to be my baby  
Everybodys trying to be my baby now  
  
Went out last night I didnt stay late  
Fore I got home I had nineteen dates  
  
Everybodys trying to be my baby  
Everybodys trying to be my baby  
Everybodys trying to be my baby now  
  
Went out last night I didnt stay late  
Fore I got home I had nineteen dates  
  
Well they took some honey from a tree  
Dressed it up and they called it me

Everybodys trying to be my baby  
Everybodys trying to be my baby no
