The Universe divided  
As the Heart and Mind collided  
With the people left unguided  
For so many troubled years  
In a cloud of doubts and fears  
Their world was torn asunder into hollow Hemispheres  
  
Some fought themselves some fought each other  
Most just followed one another  
Lost and aimless like their brothers  
For their hearts were so unclear  
And the truth could not appear  
Their spirits were divided into blinded Hemispheres  
  
Some who did not fight  
Brought tales of old to light  
My Rocinante sailed by night  
On her final flight  
To the heart of Cygnus fearsome force  
We set our course  
Spiralled through that timeless space  
To this immortal place
