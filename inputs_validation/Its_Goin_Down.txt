You know I got by the name Nitty right Uh huh  
I gotta introduce you to another motherfucker out my squad right Who dis

He resides in College Park College Park  
But for right now what we gotta do for yall what we gonna do  
We gotta give yall a hit huh  
  
Niggaz in my face  
Damn near er day  
Askin a million questions like  
Joc where ya stay  
Tell em College Park  
Where they chop cars  
Eat twenty grand spend a grand at the bar  
Just bought a zone jays on my feet  
Im on that patron so get like me  
69 Cutlass wit the bucket seats  
Beat in my trunk bought it just for the freaks  
Catch me in the hood posted at the sto  
Pistol in my lap on the phone countin dough  
If a girl choose let her do her thang  
Just like her mama and I aint sayin the name brain  
Erybody love me Im so fly  
Niggaz throw the duces erytime I ride by  
I know ya wonder why  
Im so cool  
Dont ask me just do what cha do Okay  
  
Chorus x2  
Meet me in the trap its goin down  
Meet me in the mall its goin down  
Meet me in the club its goin down  
Anywhere ya meet me guaranteed to go down  
  
Verse numba two do the damn thang  
Cubes on my neck pockets full of Ben Franks  
When Im in the mall hoes just pause  
I pop a few tags give me that on the wall  
Time to flip the work make the block bump  
Boys in the hood call me black Donald Trump  
Dope boy magic seven days a week  
Numba one record long as Nitty on the beat  
Oh I think they like me betta yet I know  
Lights camera action when I walk through the door  
Niggaz know my crew we certified stars  
Valet in the front bout thirtyfive cars  
Bitches in the back  
Black beamer coups  
Girls like girls time to recruit  
If ya got a problem say it to my face  
We can knuckle up any time any place  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Time to set it off let these niggas know  
Have ya every seen a Chevy wit the butterfly doors  
I ride real slow no need to speed  
Gotta make sure ya see the buckets on my feet  
Feds on my trail but they dont think I know  
I keep my hands clean cause I never touch dope  
Every time I see em look em in the eye  
Ask me how I know its me suprise  
Put it in the air rep where ya stay  
Take a step back blow the kush in they face  
Stuntin is a habit let em see the karats  
Im a make it rain nigga I aint scared to share it  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Yung Joc  
Nitty strikes again  
This a Nitty beat  
Playmaker
