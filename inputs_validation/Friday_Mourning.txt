Friday mourning Im dressed in black  
Douse the houselights Im not coming back  
For years I warned you  
Through tears I told you  
Friday mourning there comes a time  
Before that breaks this very smug mug of mine  
  
This dawn raid soon put paid to  
All the things Id whispered to you  
At night time  
And I will never stand naked in front of you  
Or if I do it wont be for a long time  
  
Look once to me look once to me  
Then look away  
Look once to me then look away  
  
And when they hold me down  
And when they kick me down the stairs  
I see the faces all lined up before me  
Of teachers and of parents and bosses  
Who all share a point of view  
You are a loser  
You are a loser  
  
Friday Friday mourning  
Dressed in black  
I wont be coming back
