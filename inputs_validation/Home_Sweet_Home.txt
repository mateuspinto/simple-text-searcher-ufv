Met this girl called Josephine and took her up on my machine  
We had a little fun and now we got a little one  
Had to get married being chased out of town  
Found ourselves a place to live we put all our money down  
  
Call it Home Sweet Home home sweet home  
Eleven floors up in a tower block  
Happy just to have a home  
Ive gone and changed the lock on our home  
  
Nothing really worked out right things got broke  
They stayed that way  
None of our friends came around at night and little Sam got  
No place to play  
Weve got to get out of here Bill she said Ive been telling  
You all the while  
When I came home from work that night shed jumped out the  
Window with our child  
  
From our Home Sweet Home home sweet home  
Just a place to take a rest just a place to make our nest  
We call it our home  
  
When the insurance money came through seemed dirty didnt know what to do  
Took the cash went down the casino down on the wheel on the double  
And I won oh yes I won like I never won before  
Bought myself a country house with an antique carved oak door  
  
It was Home Sweet Home home sweet home  
Just a place to lay our head think of all those things we said  
About in our Home Sweet Home
