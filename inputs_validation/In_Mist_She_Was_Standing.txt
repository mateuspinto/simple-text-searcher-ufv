Seven milestones  
Under a watching autumn eye  
Contorted trees are spreading forth  
The message of the wind  
  
With frozen hands I rode with the stars  
With anger the wind blew  
Giving wings to my stallion  
Clouds gathered across the moon  
Blazing the white light  
  
Passing the lake I know so well  
I am near yet so far away  
  
Arrival  
I saw her shadow standing in the darkness  
Awaiting me like the night  
Awaits the day  
Standing silent smiling at my presence  
A black candle holds the only light  
  
Darkness encloses  
And the candle seems to expire  
In her cold cold hand  
And as a forlorn soul  
It will fade away  
  
Touching her flesh in this night  
My blood froze forever  
Embraced before the dawn  
A kiss brought total eclipse  
  
And she spoke  
Once and forever  
I am sol cold  
In mist enrobed the twilight  
She was standing
