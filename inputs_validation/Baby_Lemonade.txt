In the sad town  
Cold iron hands clap  
The party of clowns outside  
Rain falls in gray far away  
Please please Baby Lemonade  
  
In the evening sun going down  
When the earth streams in in the morning  
Send a cage through the post  
Make your name like a ghost  
Please please Baby Lemonade  
  
Im screaming I met you this way  
Youre nice to me like ice  
In the clock they sent through a washing machine  
Come around make it soon so alone  
Please please Baby Lemonade

Send a cage through the post  
Make your name like a ghost
