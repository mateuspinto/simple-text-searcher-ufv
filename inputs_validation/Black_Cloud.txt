The one I love  
Is standing near  
The one I love  
Is everywhere  
I can woo you  
I can amuse you  
But there is nothing I can do to make you mine  
Black cloud black cloud  
  
The one I love  
Roosts in the mind  
Can snap this spell  
Or increase hell  
I can chase you  
And I can catch you  
But there is nothing I can do to make you mine  
Black cloud black cloud  
Oh black cloud  
Oh black cloud  
  
I play the game  
Of favorites now  
I can I must  
I will I do  
I can please you  
Or I can freeze you out  
But there is nothing I can do to make you mine  
Black cloud black cloud black cloud  
I can choke myself to please you  
And I can sink much lower than usual  
But theres nothing I can do  
To make you mine
