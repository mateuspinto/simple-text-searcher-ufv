Were born in a prison  
Raised in a prison  
Sent to a prison called school  
  
We cry in a prison  
We love in a prison  
We dream in a prison like fools  
  
Wood becomes a flute when its loved  
Reach for yourself and your battered mates  
Mirror becomes a razor when its broken  
Look in the mirror and see your shattered fate  
  
We live with no reason  
Kicked around for no reason  
Thrown out without reason like tools  
  
We work in a prison  
And hate in a prison  
And die in a prison as a rule  
  
Wood becomes a flute when its loved  
Reach for yourself and your battered mates  
Mirror becomes a razor when its broken  
Look in the mirror and see your shattered fate  
  
We live in a prison  
Among judges and wardens  
And wait for no reason for you  
We laugh in a prison  
Go through all four seasons  
And die with no vision of truth  
  
Wood becomes a flute when its loved  
Reach for yourself and your battered mates  
Mirror becomes a razor when its broken  
Look in the mirror and see your shattered fate
