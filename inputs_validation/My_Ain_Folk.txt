Far frae my hame I wander but still my thoughts return  
To my ain folk over yonder in the sheiling by the burn  
I see the cosy ingle and the mist upon the brae  
And joy and sadness mingle as I list some auld world lay  
chorus  
And it oh but Im longing for my ain folk  
Though they be but lowly pure and plain folk  
I am far beyond the sea but my heart will always be  
At home in dear old scotland wi my ain folk  
A bonnie lassies greetin tho she tries tae stay the tears  
And sweet will be our meeting after many weary years  
How my mother will caress me when Im standing by her side  
Now she prays that heaven will bless me through the stormy seas divide  
chorus
