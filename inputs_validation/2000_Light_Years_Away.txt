I sit alone in my bedroom  
Staring at the walls  
Ive been up all damn night long  
My pulse is speeding  
My love is yearning  
  
Chorus  
I hold my breath and close my eyes and  
Dream about her  
Cause shes two thousand light years away  
She holds my malakite so tight so  
Never let go  
Cause shes two thousand light years away  
Years Away  
  
I sit outside and watch the sunrise  
Lookout as far as I can  
I cant see her but in the distance  
I hear some laughter  
We laugh together  
  
Chorus  
  
I sit alone in my bedroom  
Staring at the walls  
Ive been up all damn night long  
My pulse is speeding  
My love is yearning  
  
I hold my breath and close my eyes and  
Dream about her  
Cause shes two thousand light years away  
She holds my malakite so tight so  
Never let go  
Cause shes two thousand light years away
