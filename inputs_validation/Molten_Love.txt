First she says Kings  
Then he says Aces  
It gets pretty hard for a lady to tell  
The hearts from the faces  
  
Dont be afraid I know I will bring you home  
Dont be afraid I know I will bring you home  
To me to me me  
  
I want to carry you across a threshold of fireflies  
And violet stones all alone all alone  
Volcanic silver clouds fill pools and canyons around us  
All around all around  
  
But molten love  
Cooled by your kisses  
Take me down take me down  
  
So dont be afraid I know I will bring you home  
Dont be afraid I know I will bring you home  
To me me to me me  
  
Molten love  
Cooled by your kisses  
Take me down take me down  
Yes molten love  
Cooled by your kisses  
Take me down take me down  
  
So dont be afraid I know I will bring you home  
No dont be afraid I know I will bring you home  
Oh dont be afraid I know I will bring you home  
Dont be afraid I know I will bring you home  
No dont be afraid I know I will bring you home
