As we search for black people and white people  
Seeking the world of the four horsemen facing  
John henry the robot dr smith and will Robinson  
Come in please  on track for the remix  
  
kool keith  
Adjusting our systems the horsemen are ready to go  
Our jets should be ready for take off any second  
  
Aheheheheheheheh  
I probe for evidence movin positive beams  
Incite the first gadget my atom explodes  
Just hit the fifth planet the x reload  
Take a brother on a flight for the alpha omega  
I kick lyrics on earth you think Im cosmic  
A spacewalker dippin in my spacecraft  
Through molecules a steel wall interphase  
The fourth horseman legendary universe  
Dark shadow human rhymin on a funky verse  
Im level 7 optimus pull back  
Feeding the world of gamma data to locate  
You interlock power 7 warp speed  
Negative charge biochemically crush  
My own nucleus bomb the great menudo  
Yo wolverine Im down cyclops rhythm x  
X we can back up the four horsemen  
Toronto blue jays field just like dave winfield  
Pick up your bat and go to third  
I see that man at the plate hes waitin home  
  
We are the horsemen  enter your spaceship 3x  
We are the horsemen  enter  
  
While returning back to my spaceship  
On my galactic horse this is what happened  
  
ced gee  
I get super bionic  
No my names not mantronix but Im 4hm  
Kickin flavor so steadily so wickedy wicked  
Can I switchedy switch it I saw my troops last night  
They said ced could you kick it  
I got mega in concert  
Then I wrote a deposit I hit my megamini  
Zoom back to outer space ten nine eight seven six  
Five four three  the chain reaction  
Triggered the mad flows then the rhymin got hyper  
Plus I knew what they likea so I ripped it and rock it  
Frequencies in the pocket one blast two blast  
Yes approximate green in the chambers  
The lights came on infrared and exciting  
Most dont know what Im saying galactic come beams  
Beams beams beams beams beams beams  
Beams beams beams  
Now its classic the atom no I dont mean the phantom  
Molecules in the mix with lots of protons to hand them  
Plus Im billin the workers secret charts led to persia  
When theyre reachin their pickup Ima crossover bezerker  
We turn to the galaxy the universe bothers me  
From the wild wild west I have a spaceship mentality  
When I chill at the planet magnesium flip  
So I shake up the myolex so whats left
