Like a man who has two hearts  
Both of them worlds apart  
Both of them play their part you know  
  
Like a man who has two wives  
His life the becomes alibis  
Nobody asks him why you know  
  
Can there be peace  
Between the heart and the brain  
No release always the same  
I wont come here again  
  
Like a man who has one hand  
Still he does what he can  
Shows he is twice the man you are  
  
Are we just beasts  
With our burdens of pain  
No release always the same  
Cut off my legs  
Torture and maim  
Im back here again  
  
Like a man who has two hearts  
One day they fell apart  
Both of them played their part you know  
  
Can there be peace  
Between the heart and the brain  
No release to try is in vain  
Stories repeat always the same  
I wont come here again
