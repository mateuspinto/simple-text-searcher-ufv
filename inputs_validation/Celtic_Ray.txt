When Lewellyn comes around  
And he goes through Market Town  
Youll be on the Celtic Ray  
Are you ready  
  
When McMannus comes around  
On his early morning rounds  
Crying Heron a lay  
Youll be on the Celtic Ray  
  
Ireland Scotland England and Wales  
I can hear the mothers voices calling  
Children children children  
  
When the coal brick man comes round  
On a cold November day  
Youll be on the Celtic Ray  
Are you ready Are you ready  
  
Ireland Scotland England and Wales  
I can hear the mothers voices calling  
Children children children  
  
Listen Jimmy I want to go home  
Listen Jimmy I want to go home  
Ive been away from the Ray too long  
Ive been away from the Ray too long  
  
All over Ireland Scotland England and Wales  
I can hear the mothers voices calling  
Children children come home children  
Children come home on the Celtic Ray  
In the early morning well go walking  
Where the light comes shining through  
On the Celtic Ray  
  
Come home children  
Come home on the Celtic Ray
