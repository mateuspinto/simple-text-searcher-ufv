Pray God you can cope  
I stand outside this womans work  
This womans world  
Ooh its hard on the man  
Now his part is over  
Now starts the craft of the father  
  
I know you have a little life in you yet  
I know you have a lot of strength left  
I know you have a little life in you yet  
I know you have a lot of strength left  
  
I should be crying but I just cant let it show  
I should be hoping but I cant stop thinking  
  
Of all the things I shouldve said  
That I never said  
All the things we shouldve done  
That we never did  
All the things I shouldve given  
But I didnt  
  
Oh darling make it go  
Make it go away  
  
Give me these moments back  
Give them back to me  
Give me that little kiss  
Give me your hand  
  
I know you have a little life in you yet  
I know you have a lot of strength left  
I know you have a little life in you yet  
I know you have a lot of strength left  
  
I should be crying but I just cant let it show  
I should be hoping but I cant stop thinking  
  
Of all the things we shouldve said  
That we never said  
All the things we shouldve done  
That we never did  
All the things that you needed from me  
All the things that you wanted for me  
All the things that I shouldve given  
But I didnt  
  
Oh darling make it go away  
Just make it go away now
