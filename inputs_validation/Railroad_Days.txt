Jan would climb up so high on the foul screen  
Down below I would yell to watch out  
When wed play  was always the winner  
He was brave never listened to me shout  
Afternoons playin ball by the old wall  
Hidin out and of course be the star  
Kept my records in old looseleaf notebooks  
And today I think I still know where they are  
Oh Railroad days  
Railroad days  
Railroad days  
When I was young in my prime  
On my way  
When the rain never got in my way  
Oh in my younger railroad days  
Some nights Drifters playin on the hifi  
Talkin bout girls or preposterous lies  
Laughin hard watchin Soupy at eleven  
Skonkin down one of Moms lemon pies  
Ten oclock bringin groceries from the market  
Singin songs to the darkness of the night  
Even sang the parts the instruments were playing  
Life was freer dreams were really quite all right  
Oh Railroad days  
Railroad days  
Railroad days  
When the sun seemed to smile on its way  
When the darkness was easier to play yeah  
Oh in my younger railroad days  
Yesterday I heard they shut the trains down  
The ones than ran by the field where I would play  
Said the folks want new and faster transportation  
Its just like me Ill be obsolete one day  
Oh Railroad days  
Railroad days  
Railroad days  
When I was young in my prime  
On my way  
When the rain never got in my way  
Oh in my younger railroad days
