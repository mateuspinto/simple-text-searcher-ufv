If youre reading this  
My mamas sitting there  
Looks like I only got a oneway ticket over here  
I sure wish I could give you one more kiss  
And war was just a game we played when we were kids  
Well Im laying down my gun  
Im hanging up my boots  
Im up here with God  
And were both watching over you  
  
Chorus  
So lay me down  
In that open field out on the edge of town  
And know my soul is where my mama always prayed that it would go  
If youre reading this Im already home  
  
If youre reading this  
Halfway around the world  
I wont be there to see the birth of our little girl  
I hope she looks like you  
I hope she fights like me  
She stands up for the innocent and the weak  
Im laying down my gun  
Hanging up my boots  
Tell dad I dont regret that Ive followed in his shoes  
  
So lay me down  
In that open field out on the edge of town  
And know my soul is where my mama always prayed that it would go  
If youre reading this Im already home  
  
If youre reading this there is going to come a day  
You move on and find someone else and thats okay  
Just remember this  
Im in a better place  
Soldiers live in peace and angels sing amazing grace  
  
So lay me down  
In that open field out on the edge of town  
And know my soul is where my mama always prayed that it would go  
If youre reading this Im already home
