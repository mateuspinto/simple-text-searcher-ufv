King Tee  
Now let me introduce whose first  
The nigga thats been down  
with the set since birth  
Whatever it was worth  
I checked in on the norm  
Since a juvenile callin  
Shots in the dorm  
Moms said you better get right  
Or shake the spot  
I chose to break and be a rollin stone  
Like pop  
Stashin the rocks by the gats  
With the Gs  
So I can talk crazy when the narks yell freeze  
I dont fight the feelin  
Gotta hustle with a passion  
Comin cross state to put you down  
With some action  
In actuallity I keeps it real in the streets  
Remininsin younger days  
Over gangsa ass beats  
And I  
Hit the weed  
Til myeye balls bleed  
While my life is corrupted  
By lust and greed  
Serve you anything from cocaine  
Up to speed  
I came with the drank  
So heres five on the weed  
  
Xzibit  
See kids dont belong  
Up in grown folks business  
The Likwit niggas rollin through with a thickness  
Sickness bear witness  
Like tequlla without a chaser  
It burns going down  
Niggas guaranteed to drown  
Legendary sound  
From the west coast underground  
The mighty King Tee  
And Mr X to the Z see  
Never underestimate the power  
Of the X man  
Dismantle your plans  
Or just catch you with a back hand  
Xzbit bring it to you live  
With the know how  
Cool in a gang  
And aint about to change  
My lifestyle  
Catchin bodies in this uphill battle  
But Xzibit unravel  
Have smoke will travel  
I bust Teflon rhymes  
Into the crowd bitch  
You anint Steve Rif  
So stop trying to get Loud  
You need to pump your brakes to avoid the collision  
Xzibit still winnin  
Unanimous decisions  
  
King Tee  
Its going down  
Once again everybody lay down  
Run your money and the jewels  
To the front without a sound  
The infamous supreme King Tee  
Glad to meet ya  
Derranged in the mothafuckin brain  
Through ya speaka and hey  
I walk around the hood lookin looped  
Strapped like a mothafuckin  
Desert strom troop  
Niggas be like King Tila  
How you get that Benz  
By sending birds to Oklahoma City  
To my friends  
I slang my gangsta funk  
Through the night  
Sometimes I fight  
Like Im the ghost of Eric Wright  
Compton is where I dwell  
Its like hell  
Slangin the shit that got the smokers  
In a spell  
And all my homies live lives  
Like crooks  
Rich and infamous  
Hoes want to look but get shook  
Cause we dont trust you hoes  
Youll have a nigga fucked up  
With a bullet through his clothes  
Positively nothings positive  
Negativity positively how we live  
Positively nothings positive  
Negativity positively how we live  
  
Xzibit  
Ladies and gentlemen  
Undivided attention  
Xzibit get you open like Nicole Brown Simpson  
Its the  
Most dangerous things next to grizzles  
Unsolved mysteries  
Xzibit hit you penetentary style  
Quick sharp and straight to the neck  
Im heavy on your chest  
Im all up in your life  
Like stress  
The coast that resides to your left  
Whre niggas perpitrate  
And catch a fate worse than death  
And like Cyanide Im hard to detect  
Got more desighns and stragiht lines  
Than an architect  
King Tee chapter four  
Verse seven reads  
Xzibit shall come and break down humanity  
Niggas lose therre sanity  
Trying to handle me  
Dysfunctional member of the Alkaholik family
