Chorus  
If its a problem  
Gon let me know  
And if it aint shit  
Nigga gon let it go  
But while its on my mind  
I need to let you kno  
Them choppas on deck  
  
And I aint afraid to let em go Repeat x 4  
  
Yea Ill do ya do ya do ya bad do ya bad  
  
Repeat x 2  
You on that dumb shit aint wit it man  
Thats the main reason murders get committed man  
It can go down any minute man  
Whole squad jump out that black on black many man  
  
So you betta be quick and on ya toes  
Where dem choppa bullets stop nobody knows  
Babies crying niggas dying all ova da place  
Mamma crying cause is blood all ova her face  
This is not a game this is not a test

Ill bust yo head ask questions lata  
Throw yo duces sianara to you hatas  
  
Chorus

When ya crank ya car ya engine catch fire
