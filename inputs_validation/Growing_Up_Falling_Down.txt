We were growing time was going so fast  
Without knowing we were growing up fast  
  
We were lying down in the shade  
I remember the love we made  
  
We were lying down on the bed  
I remember the tears we shared  
  
We were growing time was going so fast Growing up  
Without knowing Falling down we were growing up fast Growing up Falling
down  
Growing up Falling down  
  
We were laughing to we were so  
I remember the fun we had  
We were crying loud with the pain  
We will never be here again  
  
Growing up falling down
