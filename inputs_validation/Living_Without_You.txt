I want to go  
To see your house  
To see how youre living  
Living without you  
  
And if you care  
Im wanting you  
From such a distance  
Living without you  
  
And if you want to try  
To speak to me again  
Ill be your bestest friend  
Whoa ohhh ohhh  
And I want you  
Ohhh ohhh oohh  
  
The things you wrote  
To cut me off  
When I was trying  
Living without you  
  
To get with you  
Would be your friend  
Make me feel so bad  
Living without you  
  
And if you want to try  
To speak to me again  
Ill be your bestest friend  
Whoa ohhh ohhh  
And I want you  
Ohhh ohhh oohh  
  
Yeah sweet girl  
I need you  
Oooh I think it could be so good  
  
Solo  
And if you want to try  
To speak to me again  
Ill be your bestest friend  
Whoa ohhh ohhh  
And I want you  
Ohhh ohhh ohhh  
  
Yeah sweet girl  
I need you  
Oooh I think it could be so good
