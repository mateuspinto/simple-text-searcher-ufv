ANCHOR  
I have this hope  
As an anchor for my soul  
Through every storm  
I will hold to You  
  
With endless love  
All my fear is swept away  
In everything  
I will trust in You  
  
CHORUS  
There is hope in the promise of the cross  
You gave everything to save the world You love  
And this hope is an anchor for my soul  
Our God will stand  
Unshakeable  
  
VERSE  
Unchanging One  
You who was and is to come  
Your promise sure  
You will not let go  
  
BRIDGE  
Your Name is higher  
Your Name is greater  
All my hope is in You  
  
Your word unfailing  
Your promise unshaken  
All my hope is in You
