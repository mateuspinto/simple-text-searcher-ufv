Sometimes I need to remember just to breathe  
Sometimes I need you to stay away from me  
Sometimes Im in disbelief I didnt know  
Somehow I need you to go  
  
Dont stay  
Forget our memories  
Forget our possibilities  
What you were changing me into  
Just give me myself back and  
Dont stay  
Forget our memories  
Forget our possibilities  
Take all your faithlessness with you  
Just give me myself back and  
Dont stay  
  
Sometimes I feel like I trusted you too well  
Sometimes I just feel like screaming at myself  
Sometimes Im in disbelief I didnt know  
Somehow I need to be alone  
  
Dont stay  
Forget our memories  
Forget our possibilities  
What you were changing me into  
Just give me myself back and  
Dont stay  
Forget our memories  
Forget our possibilities  
Take all your faithlessness with you  
Just give me myself back and  
Dont stay  
  
I dont need you anymore dont want to be ignored  
I dont need one more day of you wasting me away  
I dont need you anymore I dont want to be ignored  
I dont need one more day of you wasting me away  
With no apologies  
  
Dont stay  
Forget our memories  
Forget our possibilities  
What you were changing me into  
Just give me myself back and  
Dont stay  
Forget our memories  
Forget our possibilities  
Take all your faithlessness with you  
Just give me myself back control  
Dont stay  
Dont stay  
Dont stay
