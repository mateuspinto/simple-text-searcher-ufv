I used to be crustacean  
In an underwater nation  
And I surf in celebration  
Of a billion adaptations  
  
Got me a big wave ride me a big wave got me a big wave  
Got me a big wave ride me a big wave got me a big wave  
  
I feel the need  
Planted in me  
Millions of years ago  
Cant you see  
The oceans size  
Defining time  
And tide  
Arising  
Arms laid upon me  
Being so kind  
To let me ride  
  
I scream in affirmation  
Of connecting dislocations  
And exceeding limitation  
By achieving levitation  
  
Got me a big wave ride me a big wave got me a big wave  
Got me a big wave ride me a big wave got me a big wave  
  
I feel the need  
Planted in me  
Millions of years ago  
Cant you see  
The oceans size  
Defining time  
And tide  
Arising  
Arms laid upon me  
Being so kind  
To let me ride  
  
Got me a ride  
I got me a ride
