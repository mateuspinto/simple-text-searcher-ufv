Mercury falling  
I rise from my bed  
Collect my thoughts together  
I have to hold my head  
It seems that shes gone  
And somehow I am pinned by  
The hounds of winter  
Howling in the wind  
  
I walk through the day  
My coat around my ears  
I look for my companion  
I have to dry my tears  
It seems that shes gone  
Leaving me too soon  
Im as dark as December  
Im as cold as the man in the moon  
  
I still see her face  
As beautiful as day  
Its easy to remember  
Remember my love that way  
All I hear is that lonesome sound  
The hounds of winter  
They follow me down  
  
I cant make up the fire  
The way that she could  
I spend all my days  
In the search for dry wood  
Board all the windows and close the front door  
I cant believe she wont be here anymore  
  
I still see her face  
As beautiful as day  
Its easy to remember  
Remember my love that way  
All I hear is that lonesome sound  
The hounds of winter  
They follow me down  
  
A season for joy  
A season for sorrow  
Where shes gone  
I will surely surely follow  
She brightened my day  
She warmed the coldest night  
The hounds of winter  
They got me in their sights  
  
I still see her face  
As beautiful as day  
Its easy to remember  
Remember my love that way  
All I hear is that lonesome sound  
The hounds of winter  
They harry me down
