When I took a little loving from you  
Oh I never thought about the hurting inside  
But I took a little more than I should  
Oh why cant explain that I would ever  
Let you slip through my fingers  
Let you escape like yesterday  
I would appreciate you knowing  
I thought your love had come to stay  
  
Talking out of turn  
Shot to pieces  
When will I learn  
Talking out of turn  
Shot to pieces  
When will I learn  
  
But I took a little more of you each day  
When I didnt see that I was breaking you apart  
With angry words of love I didnt mean  
Oh why cant believe that I would ever  
Talk myself out of tomorrow  
Talked like a fool to yesterday  
And as the evening loses colour  
Your love began to fade away  
  
Talking out of turn  
Shot to pieces  
When will I learn  
Talking out of turn  
Shot to pieces  
When will I learn  
  
Talking out of turn  
Talking out of turn  
  
If I upset you  
I didnt mean to hurt you  
I didnt mean to make you cry  
I dont need an alibi  
To start me talking out of turn  
  
When I took a little loving from you  
Oh I cant believe that I would ever  
Let you slip through my fingers  
Let you escape like yesterday  
I would appreciate you knowing  
I thought your love had come to stay  
  
Talking out of turn  
Shot to pieces  
When will I learn  
Talking out of turn  
Shot to pieces  
When will I learn
