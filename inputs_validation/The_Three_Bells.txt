Album Tribute To Tradition  
  
Theres a village hidden deep in the valley  
Among the pine trees half forlorn  
And there on a sunny morning  
Little Jimmy Brown was born  
  
All the chapel bells were ringing  
In the little valley town  
And the songs that they were singing  
Was for baby Jimmy Brown  
  
And the little congregation  
Prayed for guidance from above  
Lead us not into temptation  
Bless this hour of meditation  
Guide him with eternal love  
  
Theres a village hidden deep in the valley  
Beneath the mountains high above  
And there twenty years thereafter  
Jimmy was to meet his love  
  
All the chapel bells were ringing  
Twas a great day in his life  
For the songs that they were singing  
Was for Jimmy and his wife  
  
And the little congregation  
Prayed for guidance from above  
Lead us not into temptation  
Bless oh Lord this celebration  
May their lives be filled with love  
  
From the village hidden deep in the valley  
One rainy morning dark and grey  
A soul which wait in the heaven  
Jimmy Brown had passed away  
  
Just the lonely bell was ringing  
In the little valley town  
Twas there will it was singing  
To our good old Jommy Brown  
And the little congregation  
Prayed for guidance from above  
Lead us not into temptation  
May his soul find this salvation  
Of Thy great eternal love
