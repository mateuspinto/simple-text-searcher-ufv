performed by jann arden and jackson browne from her album living under june  
  
There will be no consolation prize  
This time the bone is broken clean  
No baptism no reprise and no sweet taste of victory  
All the stars have fallen from the sky  
And everything else in between  
Satellites have closed their eyes  
The moon has gone to sleep  
Unloved Unloved Unloved Unloved  
  
Here I am inside a hotel  
Choking on a million words I said  
Cigarettes have burned a hole  
And dreams are drunk and penniless  
Here I am inside my fathers arms  
All jagged bone and whisky dry  
Whisper to me sweetly now and tell me I will never die  
Unloved Unloved Unloved Unloved  
  
Here I am an empty hallway  
Broken window rainy night  
I am nineteen sixtytwo and I am ready for a fight  
People crying hallelujah  
While the bullet leaves the gun  
People falling falling falling  
And I dont know where theyre falling from  
Unloved Unloved Unloved Unloved  
  
Hoping that the kindness will lead us  
Past the blindnes and  
Not another living soul  
Will ever have to feel  
Unloved Unloved Unloved Unloved  
Unloved Unloved
