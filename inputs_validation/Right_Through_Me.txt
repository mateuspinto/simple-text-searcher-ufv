Chorus  
You see right through me  
How do you do that shit  
How do you do that shit  
How do you do that shit  
How do you  
How do you  
How do you  
How do you  
How do you  
  
You let me win  
You let me ride  
You let me rock  
You let me slide  
And when they lookin  
You let me hide  
Defend my honor  
Protect my pride  
The good advice  
I always hated  
But looking back  
It made me greater  
You always told me  
Forget the haters  
Just get my money  
Just get my weight up  
Know when Im lying  
Know when Im crying  
Its like you got it  
Down to a science  
Why am I trying  
No you aint buying  
I tried to fight it  
Back with defiance  
You make me laugh  
You make me hoarse  
From yelling at you  
And getting at you  
Picking up dishes  
Throwing them at you  
Why are you speaking  
When no one asked you  
  
Chorus x2  
  
What are we doing  
Could you see through me  
Cause you say Nicki  
And I say who me  
And you say no you  
And I say screw you  
Then you start dressing  
And you start leaving  
And I start crying  
And I start screaming  
The heavy breathing  
But whats the reason  
Always get the reaction you wanted  
Im actually fronting  
Im askin you something  
Yo answer this question  
Class is in session  
Tired of letting  
Passive aggression  
Control my mind  
Capture my soul  
OK your right  
Just let it go  
OK you got it  
Its in the can  
Before I played it  
You knew my hand  
You could turn a free throw into a goal  
Nigga got the peep hole to my soul  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Stop  
Stop  
Would you just stop looking through me  
Cause I just cant take it  
No I cant take it  
  
You see right through me  
How do you do that shit  
How do you do that shit  
How do you do that shit  
How do you  
How do you  
How do you  
How do you  
How do you  
  
You see right through me  
you see right through me baby  
You see right through me  
You see right through me
