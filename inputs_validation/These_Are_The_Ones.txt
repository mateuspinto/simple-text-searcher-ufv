These are the days  
You have been given  
These are the ones  
These are the ones  
  
These are the times  
We have been given  
These are the ones  
These are the ones  
  
And my dreams are holding  
And my heart is open  
  
These are the times  
They wont be forgiven  
These are the ones  
These are the ones  
  
These are the days  
Please dont forsake them  
These are the ones  
Is everyone  
  
And my dreams are holding  
And my heart is open  
  
These are the ones  
These are the ones  
These are the ones  
These are the ones  
  
And my dreams might shatter  
Still my heart it matters  
  
These are the days  
They wont be forgiven  
These are the ones  
These are the ones
