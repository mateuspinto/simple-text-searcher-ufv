Ships go out I see them every day  
Ships go out I watch them sail away  
And on the decks I see my smiling friends  
Ships go out but they never do come in  
Ships go out I watch them disappear  
Ships go out and leave me standing here  
And I dont know if thats where life begins  
Ships go out but they never do come in  
When life is cheap it never seems to last  
When life is sweet it seems to go too fast  
So on the dock I tell the idle wind  
Ships go out but they never do come in  
Ships go out onto the seas so high  
Ships go out beneath an endless sky  
And on the shore is where their stories end  
Ships go out but they never do come in  
When life is cheap it never seems to last  
Ships go out
