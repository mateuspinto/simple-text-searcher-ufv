Tiamat Adramelch Acheron Baal  
Burning up the city neath unholy citadel  
Summoning Leviathan ready to attack  
Evil one awakens all the gods of Metal Black  
We come alive at the dawn of the night  
Were raising hell and you know that it right  
The music screams on a wing and a prayer  
We turn the volume up come watch if you dare  
Hear me calling  Join the pack  
Raised in hellfire  Metal Black  
This aint no music for light hearted folk  
We tell it straight to the rich and the broke  
Were long haired punks and we dont give a care  
We turn the mayhem up join if you dare  
Hear me calling  Join the pack  
Raised in hellfire  Metal Black  
A celebration of everything loud  
This is the music to incite a crowd  
Satanic forces lays everything bare  
We turn the danger up feel it in the air  
Hear me calling  Join the pack  
Raised in hellfire  Metal Black  
Venoms calling  Join the pack  
Raised in hellfire  Metal Black yeah  
Metal Fucking Black
