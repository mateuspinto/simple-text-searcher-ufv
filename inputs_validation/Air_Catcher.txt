I dont fall slow like I used to  
I fall straight down  
Youve stolen my air catcher  
That kept me safe and sound  
  
My parachutes will guide me  
Safely to ground  
But now the cords not working  
And I see you staring me down  
  
Chorus  
I wont fall in  
Love with falling  
I will try to avoid  
Those eyes  
End Chorus  
  
I think you would beat  
The moon in a pretty contest  
And the moon just happened to be  
The very first thing that I missed  
  
I was doing fine on my own  
And there wasnt much I lacked  
But youve stolen my air catcher  
And I dont know if I want it back  
  
Chorus  
  
Cause Im not sure  
I want to give you  
Tools that can destroy  
My heart  
  
And I just dont say  
What you want to hear  
So Ill write my fears  
And I dont believe  
In talking just to breathe  
And falling selfishly  
  
Chorus  
  
But now Im here  
To give you words  
As tools that can destroy  
My heart
