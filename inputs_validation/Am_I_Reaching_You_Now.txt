Would you believe me  
If I said My head is spinning without you  
Would you believe me  
If I just want to let you know how I feel about you  
  
Now I want to know what I can do to make you stay with me tonight  
Cause I do  
Would you believe me if I leave you cause here I go  
  
Am I reaching you now  
Im just trying to tell you that Im letting you go  
Am I reaching you now  
Dearly departed now that youve started Im going to finish it  
  
Would you believe me  
If I held on too tight to make it without you  
Would you believe me  
If I just gotta let you know I cant live without you  
Would you believe me if I leave you cause here I go  
  
Am I reaching you now  
Im just trying to tell you that Im letting you go  
Am I reaching you now

Or make you think that I wont wait for you  
Cause I will  
But baby this is all I got  
So Im gonna give it one last shot  
I would give you more than enough  
But baby I got to let go
