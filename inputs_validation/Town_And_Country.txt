Touched by a butterfly on my way home  
Flying who knows where  
Walking down that dusty road  
Without a care  
The sun was shining up in the country  
And bells were ringing downtown  
Clouds were moving slow and lazy  
While I was kicking around  
And feeling out the town and the country  
Feeling out the town and the country  
Up on the hill I got a better look  
I watched the river run brown watched the river run brown  
And then I heard those songbirds singing  
The country sound  
When I got home I sat in my kitchen  
And turned the television on turned the TV on  
The news wasnt good so I didnt listen  
I started clicking around  
Thinking of the town and the country  
I was thinking of the town and the country  
Thinking of the town and the country  
In the morning everything will be the same  
Open up your world watch the children play  
In the sun or rain  
Thinking of the town and the country  
A thinking of the town and the country  
I was thinking of the town and the country fade
