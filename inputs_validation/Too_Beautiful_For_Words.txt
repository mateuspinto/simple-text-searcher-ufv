When I try to describe  
How I feel when you hold me  
I get butterflies  
I hear lullabies  
Its hard to explain  
  
Like the scent of a rose  
Or the sound of the rain  
Is too precious and too wonderful  
To give it a name  
  
Too beautiful for words  
A symphony inside me  
Too beautiful for words  
I can not take them lightly  
Can you hear my silent heart  
  
Its on the tip of my tongue  
But my lips are still sealed  
Only violins  
And then innocence  
Can show you how I feel  
  
And I hear them again  
At the end of the day  
Im all teary eyed  
When we kissed goodbye  
Theres nothing I can say  
  
Too beautiful for words  
A symphony inside me  
Too beautiful for words oh  
I can not take them lightly  
Can you hear my silent heart  
  
Must be a million times  
I tried to express this love of mine  
When it goes this deep  
When it tastes this sweet  
Its not easy to define ohh  
  
Too beautiful for words too beautiful  
A symphony inside me a symphony inside of me  
Too beautiful for words for words  
I can not take them lightly  
  
Too beautiful for words too beautiful ohh  
A symphony inside me a symphony oh  
Too beautiful for words ohh too beautiful baby  
I can not take them lightly  
Can you hear my silent heart  
  
Ohh yeah yeah oooh
