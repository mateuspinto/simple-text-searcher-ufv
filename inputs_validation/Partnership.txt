You had so many opportunities  
So much time so much space so much room to breathe  
And you  
  
So much time inside when you put it aside you waste it  
So much time inside when you put it aside you waste it  
You see your fortune lie you can decide to wake it  
So much time inside when you put it aside you waste it  
  
And she will come and take your hand  
She will help you understand  
She will help you understand  
And she will lead you to your peace  
In times when you feel weak  
In times when you are weak  
And when your space it feels deranged  
She will hold the key to change  
She will offer the key to change  
So be sure when she whispers in your ear  
That she will chase away those fears  
Then she will chase away those fears  
  
On your journey be proud of what you seek  
And your love for he or she  
For they will help you feel complete
