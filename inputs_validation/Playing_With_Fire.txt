Hey you got the look of a lonely womans eyes  
Whatcha thinking when youre standing so close to me  
Aint no law says a man cant fantasize  
Theres a secret locked up in you tight  
Oh Id love to turn the key  
  
Chorus  
Whoa playing with fire  
Whoa fighting my desire baby  
Whoa my conscience is a liar  
Oh Lord have mercy on the shameless sinner  
Whoa playing with fire  
Whoa walking on a wire now I  
Whoa I face the crucifier  
Whatcha doin to me  
  
Live by rules made up by society  
But I guess I mustve missed election day  
Cause so much about you looks so good to me yeah  
For what Im thinking I could go to jail  
But some laws are born to break  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Whoa playing with fire  
Whoa fighting my desire baby  
Oh Im beggin you Lord have mercy  
On a shameless sinner  
Whoa playing with fire  
Whoa stakes are getting higher  
I think Im losin it
