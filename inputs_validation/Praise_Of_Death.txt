Deceased in mind decree of Death  
Blackened heart baptized in fire  
Exertion now need to blitz  
Vicious ways brought up in Hell  
  
Draw the line Life or Death  
Potent thrust excessive pain  
Massive dose adrenalin  
Minor threat can not decline  
  
Chorus  
Stricken to live Hell on Earth  
Shackled and bound we lie  
Praise of Death lifes a dream  
Were only living to die  
  
Victim of life insanity lives  
Deep in shock intensive care  
Tables turned blast of strength  
Kill at once time to prevail  
  
Begin to crank feel the rush  
Start to rage take to extremes  
Push too far overkill  
Time to die no way to win  
  
Chorus  
  
Running and hunting and slashing  
And crushing and searching  
And seeing and stabbing and shooting  
And thrashing and smashing and  
Burning destroying and killing  
And bleeding and pleading then Death  
  
At Mach ten velocity  
Pressure builds cant take the strain  
Life blood flows to its grave  
Dripping sweat Death shall erase  
  
Time to think time to breath  
Feel the pulse life will expire  
Surging speed Hell afast  
Cardiac cease to exist  
  
Chorus
