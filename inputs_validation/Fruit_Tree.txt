Fame is but a fruit tree  
So very unsound  
It can never flourish  
Till its stock is in the ground  
So men of fame  
Can never find a way  
Till time has flown  
Far from their dying day  
Forgotten while youre here  
Remembered for a while  
A much updated ruin  
From a much outdated style  
  
Life is but a memory  
Happened long ago  
Theatre full of sadness  
For a long forgotten show  
Seems so easy  
Just to let it go on by  
Till you stop and wonder  
Why you never wondered why  
  
Safe in the womb  
Of an everlasting night  
You find the darkness can  
Give the brightest light  
Safe in your place deep in the earth  
Thats when theyll know what you were really worth  
Forgotten while youre here  
Remembered for a while  
A much updated ruin  
From a much outdated style  
  
Fame is but a fruit tree  
So very unsound  
It can never flourish  
Till its stock is in the ground  
So men of fame  
Can never find a way  
Till time has flown  
Far from their dying day  
  
Fruit tree fruit tree  
No one knows you but the rain and the air  
Dont you worry  
Theyll stand and stare when youre gone  
  
Fruit tree fruit tree  
Open your eyes to another year  
Theyll all know  
That you were here when youre gone
