Who I have become in You  
Is grace beyond all measure  
In the light of all You are  
Who am I to be found here  
  
Who I have become in You  
Is grace beyond all measure  
Raised to life and crowned with love  
Jesus Yours forever  
  
Majesty and mercy  
Meet me in this moment  
How can it be that I have been  
Chosen by the King  
  
Theres no greater honor  
Theres no greater treasure  
Than to be known and loved by You  
I am highly favored I am highly favored  
  
A child of grace I have become  
Adopted into favor  
Now I sing Your Spirits song  
Crying Abba Father  
  
Majesty and mercy  
Meet me in this moment  
How can it be that I have been  
Chosen by the King  
  
Theres no greater honor  
Theres no greater treasure  
Than to be known and loved by You  
I am highly favored I am highly favored

How can it be that I have been  
Chosen by the King  
  
Theres no greater honor  
Theres no greater treasure  
Than to be known and loved by You
