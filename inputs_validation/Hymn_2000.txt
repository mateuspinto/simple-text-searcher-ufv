She chose the soft center  
And took it to bed with her mother  
And the ideal confusion  
Was just an illusion  
To gain further news of her brother  
  
And the comfort of mother  
Was just an appeal for protection  
For the cat from next door  
Was found later at four  
In surgical dissection  
  
And I dont want to be  
The son of any freak  
Who for a chocolate center  
Can take you off the street  
  
For soon theyll plough the desert  
And God knows where Ill be  
Collecting submarine numbers  
On the main street of the sea  
  
The Vicar is thicker  
And I just cant see through to him  
For his cardinal sings  
A collection of hymns  
And a collection of coins is made after  
  
And who wrote the Bible  
Was it Judas or Pilate  
Well one cleans his hands  
While the other one hangs  
But still I continue to stand
