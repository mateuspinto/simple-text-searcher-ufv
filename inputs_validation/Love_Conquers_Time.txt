Love conquers time without fear without proof  
It will rise it will strike in your name  
Love conquers time like the light from the moon  
It must never be taken in vain  
  
So when you feel the beat is gone  
The love you give away will carry on  
  
Love conquers time just like tears in the sand  
It will change with each direction you try  
Love conquers time from the moment you fall  
To those arms like a child you will fly  
  
So when you feel the beat is gone  
The love you give away will carry on  
It will carry on  
  
Seasons rise and fall from a silent command  
Beyond that place of our forever  
The road goes on to where it can never end  
  
Love conquers time without fear without proof  
It will rise it will strike in your name  
Love conquers time like the light from the moon  
It must never be taken in vain  
  
Love conquers time just like tears in the sand  
It will change with each direction you try  
Love conquers time from the moment you fall  
To those arms like a child you will fly
