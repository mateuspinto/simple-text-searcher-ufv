See the lights of your town slowly sink and drown  
Like a ship in a storm  
See the birds against the sun  
Feel the weight of things to come  
And everything thats been before  
  
See the woods with no pathways  
See your grandfathers last days  
See the darkest days my dear  
  
Whisper words soft and low  
To the songs that you know  
  
And take them on your way  
See the fallen snow  
Beneath the street light glow  
By the side of the motorway  
  
See the walls with no doorways  
With a heavy heart always  
See the darkest days my dear  
  
See the woods with no pathways  
See your grandfathers last days  
See the darkest days my dear
