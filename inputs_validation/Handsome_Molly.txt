Well I wish I was in London  
Or some other seaport town  
Id put my foot on a steamboat  
Id sail the ocean round  
While sailing round the ocean  
While sailing round the sea  
Id think of handsome molly  
Wherever she might be  
Dont you remember molly  
You gave me your right hand  
You said whenever youd marry  
I would be the man  
But you broke your promise  
Go with whom you please  
My poor heart is aching  
You are at your ease  
I went to church last Sunday  
Molly came ridin by  
I could tell her mind was changin  
By the rovin of her eye  
I go down to the river  
Though everyones asleep  
I think of handsome molly  
An I begin to weep  
So I wish I was in London  
Or some other seaport town  
Id put my foot on a steamboat  
Id sail the ocean round
