Mind of destructive taste  
I choose to stroll amongst the waste  
It was your heart  
Lost in the dark  
  
Call off the chase  
Walls of thought strong and high  
As my castle crumbles with time  
I think of you  
Oh yes I do  
Such a crime  
  
Chorus  
You opened fire and your mark was true  
You opened fire aim my smiling skull at you  
You opened fire  
  
I live tomorrow youll not follow  
As you wallow in a sea of sorrow  
Lines cut across my face  
Why you laugh at my disgrace  
  
Ill never know  
How far to go  
To reach that place  
  
Chorus  
  
I live tomorrow youll not follow  
As you wallow in a sea of sorrow  
  
Chorus  
  
Repeat x 4  
I live tomorrow youll not follow  
As you wallow in a sea of sorrow
