The entire city is burning  
You can see the flames like the inside of a mad jukebox  
Lost boys stalk the streets with those jungle markings on their chests  
Barbarians prowl in shadows their heads rocking with rodents  
Motorcycles reproduce in nocturnal alleys  
Groaning with greasy pleasure  
And theyve blown up the YWCA like a giant balloon  
And sent it out to sea full of screaming lovely lonely girls
