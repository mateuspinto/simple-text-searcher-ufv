This song was first released on the whose garden was this Album It is the
only album it has been released on  
  
I wish I could have been there on the highway  
When the people came from miles around to see  
The children of the flowers come together  
  
I wish I could have been there in the sunshine  
With the sound of lovely laughter in the air  
And the music makers first began to play  
To hear them play  
  
And I wish I could have been there in the rain  
When the clouds were full of castles in the sky  
And I wish I could have heard the people sing  
As the rhytmn and the words came floating by  
  
I wish I could have been there in the starlight  
When the country side was trying once again  
And the music and the makers the poets and the singers  
And the children of the flowers have all gone
