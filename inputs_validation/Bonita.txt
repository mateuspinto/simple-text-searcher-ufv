What can I say to you Bonita what magic words would capture you  
Like a soft evasive mist you are Bonita you fly away when love is new  
What do you ask of me Bonita what part do you want me to play  
Shall I be the clown for you Bonita I will be anything you say  
Bonita dont run away Bonita  
Bonita dont be afraid to fall in love with me  
I love you I tell you I love you I love you Bonita  
If you love me life would be beautiful Bonita  
I love you I tell you I love you I love you Bonita  
If you love me life would be beautiful Bonita
