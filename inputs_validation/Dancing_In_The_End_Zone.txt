Have you ever had a good time turn bad  
When the leaves turn brown  
And the shattered glass just splinters  
Its days like this that you cant resist  
A long tall drink  
And a big yellow sun in the winter  
And you can go dancing  
You can go dancing  
You can go dancing  
Dancing in the end zone  
And you can go dancing  
You can go dancing  
You can go dancing  
Dancing in the end zone  
Did you ever pray you could stay away  
Company excluded  
From the curse of the family circle  
In a big round room on the edge of the moon  
Theres a shooting star  
In a race for the final hurdle  
You can go dancing  
You can go dancing  
You can go dancing  
Dancing in the end zone  
And you can go dancing  
You can go dancing  
You can go dancing  
Dancing in the end zone  
No need to worry no need to worry  
No need to worry when you dance alone  
You already made it you already made it  
When youre dancing in the end zone  
You can go dancing  
You can go dancing  
You can go dancing  
Dancing in the end zone  
You can go dancing  
You can go dancing  
You can go dancing  
Dancing in the end zone  
You can go dancing  
In the end zone  
You can go dancing  
In the end zone  
You can go dancing  
You can go dancing in the end zone  
You can go dancing  
You can go dancing in the end zone  
You can go dancing  
You can go dancing in the end zone
