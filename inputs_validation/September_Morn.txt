Written by Neil Diamond and Gilbert Becaud  
  
Stay for just a while  
Stay and let me look at you  
Its been so long I hardly knew you  
Standing in the door  
Stay with me a while  
I only want to talk to you  
Weve traveled halfway round the world  
To find ourselves again  
  
September morn  
We danced until the night became a brand new day  
Two lovers playing scenes from some romantic play
