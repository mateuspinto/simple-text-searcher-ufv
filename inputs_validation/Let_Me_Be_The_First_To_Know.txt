If you find a time when things just seem to fall apart  
And theres no way to keep a cheery face  
When the sight of your own reflection only breaks your heart  
And all your dreams have given up the chase  
Pick up the telephone  
You know Im always home  
Any old time of night or day  
Let me be the first to know  
Let me be the first to know  
Let me be the first to know  
If you find a time when you just have to walk away  
Because of a call to pastures new  
Youre in need of some fresh words to wish you on your way  
You need to fly on up and touch the moon  
Sharing this temporary weight  
No time to hesitate  
I will be everything you need  
Let me be the first to know  
Let me be the first to know  
Let me be the first to know  
Let me be the first   
Were water breaking on an endless wave  
Potential bursting from the sea  
Compassion is what sets our minds apart  
Be cheerful when you break  
The chains of morality  
Oo sharing this welcome weight  
Dont even hesitate  
I will be everything you need  
Let me be the first to know  
Let me be the first to know  
Let me be the first to know  
Let me be the first to know  
Let me be the first one to know
