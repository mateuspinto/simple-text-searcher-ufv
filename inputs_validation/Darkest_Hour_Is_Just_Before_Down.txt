Ralph Stanley  
  
The sun is slowly sinkin  
The days almost gone  
Still darkness falls around us  
And we must journey on  
  
The darkest hour is just before dawn  
The narrow way leads home  
Lay down your soul at Jesus feet  
The darkest hour is just before dawn  
  
Like a shepherd out on the mountain  
Awatchin the sheep down below  
Hes coming back to claim us  
Will you be ready to go  
  
The darkest hour is just before dawn  
The narrow way leads home  
Lay down your soul  
Let Jesus in  
The darkest hour is just before dawn  
The darkest hour is just before dawn
