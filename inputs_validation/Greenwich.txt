Are you back in Greenwich dropping acid  
Are you at the archive watching television  
Did you leave for Battery with your weed  
And your leather lookin like Greg Kinnear  
Are you still the king of Rock n Roll babe  
  
Bet you miss hearing me sing calling me Lana  
And did you take your run today  
Along that west side highway  
Do you miss your baby mama Blue hydrangea  
Will my forever love never come back to me  
Does it feel like yesterday to you yet  
  
How quickly you forget how I made you smile  
I remember everything  
The diamond horseshoe wedding ring and the tire light  
Blue hydrangea  
Will my forever love never return to me
