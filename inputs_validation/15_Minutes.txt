All down the streets the signs read cheaper and better technology  
This capitalist vision is my nightmare put up a sign in my face  
What the fuck happened to this place  
I think we made a wrong turn now look at hte lovely concrete  
I drove to my stupid job today got stopped at an intersection  
15 minutes of my life just rolled away  
I looked at the guy next to me he didnt seem so happy  
No ones happy but everyones too busy to see  
Lets go shopping today  
Drive our fancy cars to the fancy malls and for lunch well have big macs  
I wish I could turn the clock back to when I was ten  
When I wasnt scared of everything  
And everything wasnt so fucking crowded  
And I wonder if my kids will ever see a horizon  
Untouched by billboards and shopping malls  
And I wonder if this crazy world thinks Im the one whos crazy  
What if Im the one whos crazy  
What if Im the one whos crazy  
Im not crazy just frustrated
