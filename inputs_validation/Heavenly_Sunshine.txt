Ive searched for words of sweet description to best describe  
The thrill it gives me just to have you by my side  
But I cant find one single word that properly defines  
How sweet it is just knowing that all your love is mine  
  
Your love is heavenly sunshine heavenly sunshine  
You fill my heart with your sweet love so divine  
Heavenly sunshine heavenly sunshine  
You make me happy cos your love is mine  
  
The colors in a rainbow are a lovely sight to see  
But even rainbows lose their glow when you smile at me  
And when you kiss me I can hear a thousand bluebirds sing  
No matter how the sounds of words could only mean one thing  
  
Your love is
