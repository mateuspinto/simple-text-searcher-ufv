So fine so fine the web you spin  
I come too close and Im caught again  
In the web of wild design  
I do not know what fate is mine  
All the day sit and spin  
Spin your web and you draw me in  
Spin spin spin spin  
  
And my daddy said when I was young  
Beware the web of love my son  
To be in love is to be insane  
Make an old man groan a young man pain   
All the day sit and spin  
Spin your web and you draw me in  
Spin spin spin spin  
  
Then I did go and the time did fly  
Many a true love passed me by  
And then you came like a blinding storm  
I landed in your web so warm  
Spin your web and you draw me in  
Spin spin spin spin  
  
So fine so fine the web you spin  
I come too close and Im caught again  
In the web of wild desire  
And I cannot control the fire  
All the day sit and spin  
You spin your web and you draw me in
