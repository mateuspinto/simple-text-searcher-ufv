You cant lease my love x9  
Oh this was just an empty space  
That both we tried to live  
With windows and a can of paint  
And we began to build  
  
In spite of that  
Try to build it up x3  
In spite of this  
Try to build it up x3  
  
I have felt such an imbalance  
Loved my way around it  
And everyone around believed  
That one of us was in it for the profit  
For the profit for the profit  
Just for the profit  
  
Now were months behind the rent  
Every dollar gone unspent  
Getting closer to the end  
It all depends  
  
If you would break from me  
Break from me  
Break away from me  
You tried to lease my love  
Lease my love lease my love  
But you cant cheat my love  
Go on and lease my love  
  
Lease my love lease my love  
You cant cheat my love  
I knew this day will come  
It came so very quick  
I knew that once we fell apart  
No rule will ever stick  
And we would fold the profit  
Fold the profit x5  
  
Now were months behind the rent  
Every dollar gone unspent  
Getting closer to the end  
It all depends  
  
If you would break from me
