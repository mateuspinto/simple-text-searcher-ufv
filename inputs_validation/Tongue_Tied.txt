Oh great good golly he thrills me so  
When the apple of my eye whispers in my ear  
I get real speechless and I act so shy  
And all I can say is neenieneenieny  
  
I get tongue tied ooh

What Im tryin to say is

I met him one day at the candy shop  
My heart started poppin like a popcorn pop  
When he walked up and said hi sweety pie  
  
Well all I could say is neenieneenieny  
I get tongue tied ooh  
I get tongue tied yeah  
I went well ahahahbah

I love him so and he loves me too  
Hes my flat top honey stands six feet two  
I get an itchy twitchy feeling  
  
When he looks into my eyes  
But all I can say is neenieneenieny  
I get tongue tied ooh  
I get tongue tied yeah
