Why should I care why should I care  
  
Girls of fifteen  
Sexually knowing  
The ushers are sniffing  
Eaudecoloning  
The seats are seductive  
Celibate sitting  
Pretty girls digging  
Prettier women  
  
Magically bored  
On a quiet street corner  
Free frustration  
In our minds and our toes  
Quiet storm water  
Mmmy generation  
  
Uppers and downers  
Either way blood flows  
  
Inside outside leave me alone  
Inside outside nowhere is home  
Inside outside where have I been  
Out of my brain on the five fifteen  
  
On a raft in the quarry  
Slowly sinking  
On the back of a lorry  
Holy hitching  
Dreadfully sorry  
Apple scrumping  
Born in the war  
Birthday punching  
  
He man drag  
In the glittering ballroom  
Gravely outrageous  
In my high heel shoes  
Tightly undone  
They know what theyre showing  
Sadly ecstatic  
That their heroes are news  
  
Why should I care
