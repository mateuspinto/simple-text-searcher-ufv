I remember when I was a lad  
Times were hard and things were bad  
But theres a silver linin behind evry cloud  
Just four people that s all we were  
Tryin to make a livin out of blackland dirt  
But wed get together in a family circle singin loud  
  
Daddy sang bass mama sang tenor  
Me and little brother would join right in there  
Singin seems to help a troubled soul  
One of these days and it wont be long  
Ill rejoin them in a song  
Im gonna join the family circle at the throne  
  
Though the circle wont be broken  
By and by Lord by and by  
Daddy sang bass mama sang tenor  
Me and little brother would join right in there  
In the sky Lord in the sky  
  
Now I remember after work mama would call in all of us  
You could hear us singin for a country mile  
Now little brother has done gone on  
But Ill rejoin him in a song  
Well be together again up yonder in a little while  
  
Daddy sang bass mama sang tenor  
Me and little brother would join right in there  
Cause singin seems to help a troubled soul  
One of these days and it wont be long  
Ill rejoin them in a song  
Im gonna join the family circle at the throne  
  
Oh no the circle wont be broken  
By and by Lord by and by  
Daddy sang bass mama sang tenor  
Me and little brother would join right in there  
In the sky Lord in the sky  
  
In the sky Lord in the sky
