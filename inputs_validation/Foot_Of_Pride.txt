Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man  
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male  
They sang Danny Boy at his funeral and the Lords Prayer  
Preacher talking bout Christ betrayed  
Its like the earth just opened and swallowed him up  
He reached too high was thrown back to the ground  
You know what they say about bein nice to the right people on the way up  
Sooner or later you gonna meet them comin down  
  
Well there aint no goin back when your foot of pride come down  
Aint no goin back  
  
Hear ya got a brother named James dont forget faces or names  
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed  
He looked straight into the sun and said revenge is mine  
But he drinks and drinks can be fixed  
Sing me one more song about ya love me to the moon and the stranger  
And your fall by the sword love affair with Erroll Flynn  
in these times of compassion when conformitys in fashion  
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in  
  
Well there aint no goin back when your foot of pride come down  
Aint no goin back  
  
Theres a retired businessman named Red cast down from heaven and hes out of
his head  
He feeds off of everyone that he can touch  
He said he only deals in cash or sells tickets to a plane crash  
Hes not somebody that you play around with much  
Miss Delilah is his a Philistine is what she is  
Shell do wondrous works with your fate  
Feed you coconut bread spice buns in your bed  
If you dont mind sleepin with your head face down in a grave  
  
Well there aint no goin back when your foot of pride come down  
Aint no goin back  
  
Well theyll choose a man for you to meet tonight  
Youll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors  
How to enter into the gates of paradise  
No how to carry a burden too heavy to be yours  
Yeah from the stage theyll be tryin to get water outta rocks  
A whore will pass the hat collect a hundred grand and say thanks  
They like to take all this money from sin build big universities to study in  
Sing Amazing Grace all the way to the Swiss banks  
  
Well there aint no goin back when your foot of pride come down  
Aint no goin back  
  
They got some beautiful people out there man  
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue  
They got mystery written all over their forehead  
They kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young  
They dont believe in mercy  
Judgment on them is something that youll never see  
They can exalt you up or bring you down main route  
Turn you into anything that they want you to be  
  
Well there aint no goin back when your foot of pride come down  
Aint no goin back  
  
Yes I guess I loved him too  
I can still see him in my mind climbin that hill  
Did he make it to the top well he probably did and dropped  
Struck down by the strength of the will  
Aint nothin left here partner just the dust of a plague that has left this
whole town afraid  
From now on thisll be where youre from  
Let the dead bury the dead Your time will come  
Let hot iron blow as he raised the shade  
  
Well there aint no goin back when your foot of pride come down  
Aint no goin back
