As they say two can play  
But keep that song away from me  
In my time too much love  
Has made me sad for so long  
I was lost cant you see  
Through the long lonely night  
  
Heaven knows I believe  
Wont you take a chance with me  
Sometimes I get so blue  
People say Im just a fool  
All the world even you  
Should learn to love the way I do  
  
I was blind cant you see  
Through the long lonely night  
Heaven knows I believe  
You can take a chance with me
