Ever since I was a child  
I loved to wander wild  
Through the bright city lights  
And find myself a life I could call my own  
It was always my ambition  
To see Piccadilly  
Ramble and roam around Soho  
And Pimlico and Savile Row  
And walk down the Abbey Road  
So I saved all my money  
And packed up my clothes  
And I said goodbye to my friends  
And my folks back home  
And I left for a life of my own  
I left for a life on the road  
  
Im a real hungry tyke  
And I know what I like  
And I know where Im goin  
To those bright city lights  
Oh yeah oh yeah  
This time Im gonna get there  
Im bound for a life on the road  
Give me life on the road  
I said life on the road  
  
When I arrived in Euston  
I was little more than a child  
And I didnt know then  
That the dives and the dens  
Would be so vulgar and wicked and wild  
Mama always told me  
The city ladies were bawdy and bold  
And so I searched night and day  
To catch a kissable lady  
But all that I caught was a cold  
Cause those stuckup city ladies  
Didnt notice me walk by  
Now Ive got holes in my shoes  
Cause Ive been walkin the streets all night  
And Im livin the life that I chose  
Livin my life on the road  
I said life on the road  
I want life on the road  
Life on the road  
  
I was standing with the punks in Praed Street  
When a muscle man came my way  
He said
