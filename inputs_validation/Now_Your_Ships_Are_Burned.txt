Now your ships are burned  
And the evil has returned  
It will creep upon you  
Theres nothing to do  
  
It will rip up your mind  
And death you will find  
Life is just a game  
And death is just the same  
  
Within the bloodstained walls  
In the center of your brain  
Demons without mercy  
Driving you insane  
  
It will rip up your mind  
And death you will find  
Life is just a game  
And death is just the same  
  
Now your ships are burned  
And the evil has returned  
It will creep upon you  
Theres nothing to do  
  
It will rip up your mind  
And death you will find  
Life is just a game  
And death is just the same  
  
When the orders are obeyed  
And you have been slayed  
Youre lying on the ground  
Without making a sound  
  
As your soul fades away  
You can hear someone say  
Ring the dooms day bell  
Turn the world into hell
