I love you from the bottom of my pencil case  
I love you in the songs I write and sing  
  
Love you because you put me in my rightful place  
And I love the PRS cheques that you bring  
  
Cheap never cheap  
Ill sing you songs till youre asleep  
When youve gone upstairs Ill creep  
And write it all down  
  
Oh Shirley Oh Deborah Oh Julie Oh Jane  
I wrote so many songs about you  
I forget your name I forget your name  
Jennifer Alison Phillipa Sue Deborah Annabel too  
Jennifer Alison Phillipa Sue Deborah Annabel too  
I forget your name  
  
I love your from the bottom of my pencil case  
I love the way you never ask me why  
I love to write about each wrinkle on your face  
And I love you till my fountain pen runs dry  
  
Deep so deep the number one I hope to reap  
Depends upon the tears you weep so cry lovey cry cry cry cry  
  
Oh Cathy Oh Alison Oh Phillipa Oh Sue  
You made me so much money I wrote this song for you  
Jennifer Alison Phillipa Sue Deborah Annabel too  
I wrote this song for you  
  
So let me talk about Mary a sad story  
Turned her grief into glory  
Late at night by the typewriter light  
She ripped his ribbon to shreds
