Dont get much slicker than fab I strap up with the eagles  
Throw bullets just as quick as a man  
Flicker or jab quicker than ash  
Any chick that I stab says she can feel a dick in her ass  
Its a like it or not thing they like how the watch bling  
And I got cars like micheal has got rings  
Might spice a chicken like she a hot wing  
Never tell her to bounce like if she got springs  
Nicks talk slick on the mic to the shot spring  
And I holla fly like I Got wings  
Cops wanna see this man  
Flash my picture ask my neightbous did they see this man  
Lemme take a long breather  
Before I be on the inside telling my story to don diva  
Thats why I gota lawyer that Dont please my case  
Walk even if the judge id my face  
Got a problem that my cars couldnt Rebitrace  
And a problem with playin jus cuz I Need my space  
With a hong chong ckick  
The green and gold bronze on thatll make the bishop don juan sick  
I done too much to get this three hundred  
Nigga this Yankee cost some big frankys  
Thats why Im so slick and gravy  
Slick and gravy mixed with oh yeah  
Probably seen me on saint nicks on Broadway  
Lookin for some chicks in broad way  
But Im not a brooklyn rapper starring for a tape on recap  
The boy gets some paper when he raps  
And I keep a down ass chick straight on her knee caps  
To keep the family business confidential  
Chick looks pretty in the continental  
You kno what the man do its Monumental  
The way I be stitchin on em  
Im like a hustler in the 80s when the dude saw the sticthin on em  
Im in the seven jeans with the orange stichy on it  
One of em tshirts with the bigger picture on em  
Im too big man And Im so Brooklyn  
The name is just enough to get your throat token  
The real talk new york is holding the toast tighter  
Ima ghostwriters for ghostwriters
