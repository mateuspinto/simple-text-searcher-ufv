Hear the clock strike two am  
Another sleepless night for you  
Oh i have been there too  
But there is healing in the hand of God  
He will cover everybody  
Hell even touch someone like you  
  
Its a natural thing to believe that  
Something wonderful never comes easy  
Let it go  
There is power in the cross to heal us  
There is freedom in the blood that Jesus offered to you  
So freely  
  
Chorus  
Feel the wonder of it all  
Let your heart and your mind receive  
An answer to the call  
Feel the wonder of it all  
Sweet Jesus  
The love of God  the wonder of it all  
  
Another day another twist in the road  
A cloud upon your soul  
Dont let it take control  
Dont be afraid to say the name  
Hes there for those who call him  
Hes your refuge from the cold  
  
To love God is a curious thing  
The more you give it seems the more he brings  
His love back to you  
In the presence of the holy spirit  
Bells ringing and i can hear the angels sing  
So clearly  
  
Repeat Chorus  
the answer is Jesus  
Sweet Jesus  
Feel the wonder of it all  
Sweet Jesus  
The love of God  the wonder of it all  
  
Let your heart and your mind receive  
Answer to the call  
Feel the wonder of it all  
Sweet Jesus  
The love of God  the wonder of it all
