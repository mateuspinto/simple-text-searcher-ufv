Standing here in Your presence  
Thinking of the good things You have done  
Waiting here patiently  
Just to hear Your still small voice I hear  
  
Calling righteous faithful till the end  
Savior healer redeemer and friend  
  
I will worship You for who You are  
I will worship You for who You are  
I will worship You for who You are
