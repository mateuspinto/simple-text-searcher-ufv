See I cant scare anybody  
They come from miles around  
To laugh in my face and eat in my field  
  
Said a scarecrow swinging on a pole  
To some blackbirds sittin on a fence  
Oh the Lord gave me a soul  
But forgot to give me common sense  
  
Said the blackbirds Well well well  
What the thunder would you do with common sense  
Said the scarecrow Would be pleasin  
Just to reason out the reason  
Of the wishes and the whyness and the whence  
  
If I had an once of common sense  
If he had an ounce of common sense  
  
Well what would you do Scarecrow  
I would while away the hours  
Conferrin with the flowers  
Consultin with the rain  
And my head Id be scratchin  
While my thoughts were busy hatchin  
If I only had a brain  
  
Id unravel every riddle  
For every individle  
In trouble or in pain  
With the thoughts Id be thinkin  
I could be another Lincoln  
If I only had a brain  
  
Oh I could tell you why  
The oceans near the shore  
I could think of things I never thought before  
Then Id sit and think some more  
  
I would not be just a nothin  
My head all full of stuffin  
My heart all full of pain  
I would dance and by merry  
Life would be a dingle derry  
If I only had a brain  
  
If I only had a brain  
If he only had a brain  
  
I could tell you why  
The oceans near the shore  
I could think of things I never thought before  
And then Id sit and think some more  
  
Yeah it would be kind of pleasin  
To reason out the reason  
For the things I cant explain  
Then perhaps Id deserve you  
And be even worthy of you  
If I only had a brain  
  
I could dance and by merry  
Life would be a dingle derry  
If I only had a brain  
  
If I only had a brain  
If he only had a brain
