Well they say its kinda frightnin how this younger generation swings  
You know its more than just some new sensation  
Well the kid is into losin sleep and he dont come home for half the week  
You know its more than just an aggravation  
  
And the cradle will rock  
Yes the cradle will rock  
And I say rock on  
Rock on  
  
And when some local kid gets down they try and drum him out of town  
They say You coulda least faked it boy  
At an early age he hits the street and winds up tied with who he meets  
and hes unemployed  
  
And the cradle will rock  
Yeah the cradle will rock  
And I say rock on  
Rock on  
  
Have you seen Juniors grades  
And when some local kid gets down they try and drum him out of town  
They say You coulda least faked it boy  
At an early age he hits the street and winds up tied with who he meets  
and hes unemployed His folks are overjoyed  
  
And the cradle will rock  
Yeah the cradle will rock  
And I say rock on  
  
Rock on  
Rock on  
Rock on
