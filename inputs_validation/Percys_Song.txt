Bad news bad news come to me where I sleep  
Turn turn turn again  
Sayin one of my friends is in trouble deep  
Turn turn to the wind and the rain  
Tell me the trouble tell me once to my ears  
Turn turn turn again  
Juliet prison for ninetynine years  
Turn turn to the wind and the rain  
A crash on the highway threw a car into a field  
Turn turn turn again  
There were four people killed and he was at the wheel  
Turn turn to the wind and the rain  
But I knew him as well as I know my own self  
Turn turn turn again  
And he wouldnt harm a life that belonged to someone else  
Turn turn to the wind and the rain  
That may be so said the judge from the side of his mouth  
Turn turn turn again  
But the witness who saw it he left little doubt  
Turn turn to the wind and the rain  
He may he may have a sentence to server  
Turn turn turn again  
But ninetynine years he just does not deserve  
Turn turn to the wind and the rain  
Too late too late for his case it is sealed  
Turn turn turn again  
A sentence it is passed and it can not be repealed  
Turn turn to the wind and the rain  
But he aint no criminal and his crime it is none  
Turn turn turn again  
And what happened to him could have happened to anyone  
Turn turn to the wind and the rain  
At that the judge jumped forward and his face it did freeze  
Turn turn turn again  
Sayin Would you kindly leave my office now please  
Turn turn to the wind and the rain  
I squinted my eyes and I stood up slow  
Turn turn turn again  
With no other choice except for me to go  
Turn turn to the wind and the rain  
I walked down the hall and I heard his door slam  
Turn turn turn again  
I walked down the stairs but I did not understand  
Turn turn to the wind and the rain  
And I played my guitar through the night and through the day  
Turn turn turn again  
But the only tune that my guitar would play  
Was oh how cruel the wind and the rain
