I had this little bad thing something like them tens  
She gave a nigga mad brain something like the wiz  
But you see the sad thing fucking with her is  
The chick aint even have brains dummy like a bitch  
  
So I tried to show her  
About the world and about just who we really are  
And where weve come and how we still have to go really far  
Like baby look at how we live broke on the boulevard  
But all she ever want me to do is unhook her bra  
And I really want is for her to go down low  
Before you know it she wet enough to get drowned slow  
And all the deep shit I was previously down for  
Replaced by freak shit I am currently down for  
  
You see I peeped it pussy is power  
That proud feeling we get knowing pussy is ours  
And how it feels to feel that feeling you feeling when you be drilling that
shit  
Got her sayin you be killin that shit  
And all the pain the world caused she be healin that shit  
And nah that aint your girl but you be feelin that chick  
And you just want to tell her everything she might need  
But in the mean time its light please  
  
Chorus x2  
Lights please  
Lights please  
Turn off the lights  
For now everything just seems so right  
How you make the darkness seem so bright  
Feeling like thing gon be alright  
  
So now we in the hotel mirrors on the ceiling  
She say she wanna blow Ls I hear her and Im willing  
But every time I smoke well a nigga mind gone  
So that every word I spoke I was tryna put her on  
But she couldnt hear me  
  
I told her all about how we been living a lie  
And that they love to see us all go to prison to die  
Like baby look at how the show us on the TV screen  
But all she ever want me to do is unzip her jeans  
Then all I really want is for her to get on top  
Before you know it she working jerking it nonstop  
And all that next shit I was previously talkin  
Is now that wet shit that Im currently lost in  
  
And while that sweat drip I am reminded  
All the times my brother told me that pussy is blinding  
Im finding  
The more I grow the more yall seem to stay the same  
Dont even know the rules but yet yall trying to play the game  
And aint it shameful how niggas blame hoes for giving birth  
To a baby that took two to make  
Coward nigga you a fake  
How you gon look in your sons face and turn you back  
Then go start another family dog what type of shit is that  
  
She said its okay  
Rubbed my head and told me to relax  
Laid a nigga down proper like she was recordin tracks  
Said I know you wanna change the world but for the night please  
Just reach over and hit the lights please  
  
Chorus x2
