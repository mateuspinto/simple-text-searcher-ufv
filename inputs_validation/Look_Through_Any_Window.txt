Look through any window yeah  
What do you see  
Smiling faces all around  
Rushing through the busy town  
Where do they go  
Moving on their way  
Walking down highways and the byways  
Where do they go  
Moving on their way  
People with their shy ways and their sly ways  
Oh you can see the little children all around  
Oh you can see the little ladies in their gowns when you  
Look through any window yeah  
Any time of day  
See the drivers on the roads  
Pulling down their heavy loads  
Where do they go  
Moving on their way  
Driving down highways and the byways  
Where do they go  
Moving on their way  
Drivers with their shy ways and their sly ways  
Oh you can see the little children all around  
Oh you can see the little ladies in their gowns when you  
Look through any window yeah  
What do you see  
Smiling faces all around  
Rushing through the busy town  
Where do they go  
Moving on their way  
Moving on their way  
Moving on their way
