Story of a man  
Who decided not to breathe  
Turned red purple then blue  
Colorful indeed  
No matter how his friends begged  
Well he would not concede  
And now hes dead  
You see cause everybody knows  
You got to breathe  
  
But oh God  
Under the weight of life  
Things seem brighter on the other side  
Lighter on the other side  
  
Another one See this monkey sitting on a tree  
One day decided to climb down  
And run off to the city  
Look at him now Tired and drunk  
And living on the street  
As good as dead  
You see a monkey should know  
Stay up your tree  
  
But oh God  
Under the weight of life  
Things seem brighter on the other side  
Oh God  
But under the weight of life  
Things seem much brighter on the other side  
  
No way no way no way Out Of here  
  
Another one A big eyed fish  
Yeah swimming in the sea  
Oh how he dreamed  
He wants to be a bird  
Swooping diving through the breeze  
One day he caught a big blue wave  
Up onto the beach  
And now hes dead  
You see a fishs dream  
Should stay in the sea  
  
But oh God  
Under the weight of life  
Things seem brighter on the other side  
  
No way No way No way Out Of here  
  
No way out of life
