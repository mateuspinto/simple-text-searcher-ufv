Sail along silvery moon  
Trail along lovers lane  
Sail along silvery moon  
To my love again  
  
In the glow of your light  
Let me see her tonight  
Once again hold her tight  
Back in lovers lane  
  
And then the whole world wll seem brighter  
As we stroll hand in hand  
Two blue hearts will be lighhter  
You understand  
  
Sail along silvery moon  
Trail along lovers lane  
Sail along silvery moon  
To my love again
