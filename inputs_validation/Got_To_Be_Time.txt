So sad  
Depression deep inside has got your heart held down  
And youre afraid to feel  
Too bad  
Because life is here for living  
God desires to give you joy beyond imagination  
And so the saying goes  
You gotta stop and smell the roses  
  
chorus  
Got to be time for dancing  
Got to be time for singing  
Take the time to celebrate  
The fire of the moment  
Got to be time for laughing  
Got to be time for shouting  
Thank the lord for what hes done  
Theres got to be time  
  
Youve got to hold on  
Dont let the smallest struggle steal the victory  
When you weep in the night  
Stay strong  
Because joy comes in the morning  
Jesus longs to help you make  
The most of your salvation  
And so the saying goes  
You gotta stop and smell the roses  
  
repeat chorus  
So turn it up  
Turn up the music turn up the music  
Let the rhythm set you free to move again  
Hey turn it up  
Turn up the music turn up the music  
You owe it to yourself to hang on tight and lose control  
You can feel it in you soul  
  
Dancing singing celebration  
Theres got to be time  
Laughing shouting celebration  
Theres got to be time 3x  
  
repeat chorus 2x
