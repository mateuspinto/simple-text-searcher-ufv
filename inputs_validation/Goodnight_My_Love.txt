Goodnight my love the tired old moon is descending  
Goodnight my love my moment with you now is ending  
It was so heavenly holding you close to me  
It will be heavenly to hold you again in a dream  
The stars above have promised to meet us tomorrow  
Til then my love how dreary the new day will seem  
So for the present dear well have to part  
Sleep tight my love goodnight my love  
Remember that youre my sweetheart
