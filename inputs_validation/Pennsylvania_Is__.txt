Jackson met a girl in a valley town  
They fell into a teenage love shed grow to hate  
Hes in prison now since he beat her down  
He got her pregnant and she made it go away  
Hey hey hey hey Pennsylvania  
Pennsylvania  
  
I got a card today from a girl I know  
She used to live alone in Philadelphia  
She had to leave the state for a choice she made  
She says she feels just like a hostage in her home  
Hey hey hey hey Pennsylvania  
Pennsylvania  
  
You can close your eyes you can fall and die  
You can make your laws and make it go away  
You can close your eyes but you cant make it go away  
Cant make it go away  
  
I just got a call from my uncle Mike  
He said he left his wife and hes not going back  
Said she changed her mind about a desire child  
I asked him if he wants a place mat or a wife  
Hey hey hey hey Pennsylvania  
Pennsylvania is wrong
