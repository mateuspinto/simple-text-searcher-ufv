I can open doors all by myself  
And Im strong enough to face this world  
Without anybodys help  
But why why would I want to  
Why when you love me like you do  
  
Chorus  
I could go on livin  
Without tasting your kiss  
Get by without this moment  
You touching me like this but why  
  
I could keep this feeling locked in my heart  
I could bury these emotions and put up my guard  
But why why start resisting  
Why look at all Id be missing  
  
Chorus  
  
But why would I do that  
Id have to be crazy  
To give up all you give me  
What you do to me baby  
  
Oh I could go on livin  
Without tasting your kiss  
Get by without this moment  
You touching me holding me and loving me  
Like this but why  
Why would I want to baby  
Oh why
