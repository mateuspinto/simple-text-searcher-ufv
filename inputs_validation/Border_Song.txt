Holy Moses I have been removed  
I have seen the spectre he has been here too  
Distant cousin from down the line  
Brand of people who aint my kind  
Holy Moses I have been removed  
  
Holy Moses I have been deceived  
Now the wind has changed direction and Ill have to leave  
Wont you please excuse my frankness but its not my cup of tea  
Holy Moses I have been deceived  
  
Im going back to the border  
Where my affairs my affairs aint abused  
I cant take any more bad water  
Been poisoned from my head down to my shoes  
  
Holy Moses I have been deceived  
Holy Moses let us live in peace  
Let us strive to find a way to make all hatred cease  
Theres a man over there  
Whats his colour I dont care  
Hes my brother let us live in peace  
Hes my brother let us live in peace  
Hes my brother let us live in peace
