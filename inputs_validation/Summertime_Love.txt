Many times Ive been told by the wise and the old  
Something good Im supposed to remember  
If my first love Ill found in in the warm of July  
Itll cool in the in the nip of September  
Now they point to the skies  
To the old and wise  
And they speak of a chill in the air  
But I dont care  
Oh still I love my summertime love  
Still I love the kissing and the codding  
Still I love my summertime love  
With a heart still summertime true  
Still I love my summertime love  
Still I want her walking close beside me  
Still I love my summertime love  
Let the seasons change as they do  
Oh still I love my summertime love  
Still I love the kissing and the codding  
Still I love my summertime love  
With a heart still summertime true
