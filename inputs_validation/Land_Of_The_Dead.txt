A fortress in the sky  
Whats left of life it holds  
We live on borrowed time  
  
Along a glowing moonlit pier  
Their armies still advance  
From the murky depths they rise  
  
From their rotting bones  
Their souls they scream  
For the flesh they need  
  
Repeat x2  
Tonight tonight  
Zombies walk  
Walk the earth  
Land of the dead  
  
Massive flames arise  
They burn out of control  
In the slums its genocide  
  
Evolved they find a way inside  
Those who could escape  
Had no chance to survive  
  
From their rotting bones  
Their souls they scream  
For the flesh they need  
  
Repeat x2  
Tonight tonight  
Zombies walk  
Walk the earth  
Land of the dead  
  
Tonight tonight  
Zombies walk  
Land of the dead  
The dead
