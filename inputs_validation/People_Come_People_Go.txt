People come and people go  
But your touch cuts me deeper  
And still it grows at the center  
I will always remember  
  
Years gone by  
Seems like youre still here  
Every night in my dreams  
You remind me with kisses so tender  
I will always remember  
  
Never been one to give my heart up so easily  
But now youre gone wish Id given my heart completely  
In the touch of a stranger I can feel you  
In the eyes of a child I see your face  
  
Your hold on my soul  
Keeps me from danger  
No matter how hard I try  
These memories I cant erase  
  
People come and people go  
But your touch cuts me deeper  
And still it grows at the center  
I will always remember  
  
Years gone by  
Seems like youre still here  
Every night in my dreams  
You remind me with kisses so tender  
I will always remember  
  
In the brush of a stranger I can feel you  
In the eyes of a child I see your face  
Your hold on my soul  
Keeps me from danger  
  
No matter how hard I try  
These memories I cant replace
