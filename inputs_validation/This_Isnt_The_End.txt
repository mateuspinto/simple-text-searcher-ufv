Intro  
An 8 year old girl had a panic attack  
Cause the father she loved left and never looked back  
No longer the hero she counted on  
He told her he loved her and then he was gone  
  
Verse 1  
She tried to look happy in front of her friends  
But knew that shed never feel normal again  
She fought back the tears as they filled her eyes  
And wanted him back just to tell him goodbye  
  
Chorus  
When the rain falls down  
When it all turns around  
When the light goes out this isnt the end  
  
Verse 2  
Her dad was a good guy that everyone liked  
But nobody knew he was dying inside  
He promised his family hed be all right  
And then with a gunshot he left them behind  
  
Chorus x2  
When the rain falls down  
When it all turns around  
When the light goes out this isnt the end  
  
Verse 3  
The role of a father he never deserved  
He abandonned his daughter and never returned  
And over the years though the pain was real  
She finally forgave him and started to heal  
  
Bridge  
How close to the ending Well nobody knows  
The futures a mystery and anything goes  
Love is confusing and life is hard  
You fight to survive cause you made it this far  
  
Outro  
Its all too astounding to comprehend  
Its just the beginning this isnt the end  
Its just the beginning this isnt the end
