I made these wishes with you  
Went coast to coast  
And we both felt so alive so alive  
We traded safe for something we just had to be  
And we almost lost our minds lost our minds  
But were still here searching  
  
This is loud  
This is cold  
This is endless and I know  
Growing up has just begun  
But theres a place  
We could find  
Where this pain is useless  
And well forever be the young  
  
Summer came and flew by twice as fast  
It was close enough to feel  
And after all this waiting for skies to fall  
I need this to be real  
Oh please let it be real  
  
This is loud  
This is cold  
This is endless and I know  
Growing up has just begun  
Growing up has just begun  
But theres a place  
We could find  
Where this pain is useless  
And well forever be the young  
Forever be the young  
  
Where I was broken I am healed  
I learned to fight  
I learned to feel  
And I cant believe my eyes  
You are still here next to me  
All I need youre all I see  
In this life we hope to find  
  
This is loud  
This is cold  
This is endless and I know  
Growing up has just begun  
Growing up has just begun  
But theres a place  
We could find  
Where this pain is useless  
And well forever be the young  
Forever be the young  
  
This is loud  
This is cold  
This is endless and I know  
Well forever be the young  
This is loud  
This is cold  
This is endless and I know  
Well forever be the young  
Its endless and I know
