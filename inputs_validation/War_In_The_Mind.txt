Everybody knows that theyre guilty  
Everybody knows that theyve lied  
Everybody knows that theyre guilty  
Resting on their conscience eating their inside  
Its freedom I said its freedom time now  
Its freedom said its freedom time now  
Time to get free or give your selves up now  
Its freedom said its free time yo  
Theres a war in the mind over territory for the dominium  
Who will dominate the opinions  
Schisms and isms keeping us in forms of religion  
Conforming our vision to the world church of decision  
Trapped in a section submitted to committing election  
Moral affection epidemic lies and deception  
Insurrection of the highest possible order  
Distorting our tape recorders from hearin it like underwater  
Beyond the borders find the sin in disorder  
Bound by the strategy of a systemic depravity  
Heavy as gravity head first in the cavity without a bottom  
A fate worst then Sodom  
Whats gotem drunk of the spirit  
Truth comes we cant hear it when youve been programmed to fear it  
I had a vision I was falling in indecision  
Appalling calling religious a program on television  
How can Dominate wisdom  
Be recognized in the system  
Of antichrists The majority rules  
Intelligent fools  
P H D s in illusion masters of mass confusion  
Bachelors of past illusion  
Now who you choosing  
The head or the tail  
The bloodshed of the male or confidence in the veil  
Conferences at Yale discussing doctrines of Baal  
Causing peoples to fail keeping a third in jail  
His words nailed everything to the tree  
Severing all of me from all that I use to be  
Formless and void totally paranoid  
Enjoyed darknesss Lord keeping me from the sword
