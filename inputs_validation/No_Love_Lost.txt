So long sitting here  
Didnt hear the warning  
Waiting for the tape to run  
Weve been moving around in different situations  
Knowing that the time would come  
Just to see you torn apart  
Witness to your empty heart  
I need it  
I need it  
I need it  
  
Through the wire screen the eyes of those standing outside looked in  
At her as into the cage of some rare creature in a zoo  
In the hand of one of the assistants she saw the same instrument  
Which they had that morning inserted deep into her body  
She shuddered  
Instinctively  
No life at all in the house of dolls  
No love lost  
No love lost  
  
Youve been seeing things  
In darkness not in learning  
Hoping that the truth will pass  
No life underground wasting never changing  
Wishing that this day wont last  
To never see you show your age  
To watch until the beauty fades  
I need it  
I need it  
I need it  
  
Twoway mirror in the hall  
They like to watch everything you do  
Transmitters hidden in the walls  
So they know everything you say is true  
Turn it on  
Dont turn it on  
Turn it on
