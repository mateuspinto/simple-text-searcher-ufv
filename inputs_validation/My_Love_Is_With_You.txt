I was just walking down the street  
Looking forward to seeing the friends I was to meet  
Yet what happened so tragically  
Really makes for no sense at all  
Suddenly two guys confronted me  
Saying I was on the wrong turf angrily  
They said their colors were black but I was wearing gray  
I started to turn to go back  
They up and blew me away  
  
My love is with you where ever you are  
My love is with you where ever you are repeat  
  
Though my life theyve taken  
They cant take what weve shared  
Spread the love Ive given  
And Ill be there  
  
I was out playing with my friends  
You know doing those silly things kids do at ten  
But the crossfire I was caught in  
Should not have been in the first place  
A dropped Monte Carlo came to a screech  
Someone yelled nobody gets away with dissin me  
Across the street a man pulled his nine  
Everybody started to run  
A shower of bullets rang out  
Mistakenly my life was done oh  
  
My love is with you where ever you are  
My love is with you where ever you are repeat  
  
Though my life theyve taken  
They cant take what weve shared  
Spread the love Ive given  
Ill be there  
  
My love is with you where ever you are  
My love is with you where ever you are repeat  
  
When youre joyful  
When youre lonely  
When youre happy  
When tears are streamin right down your face  
In the morning  
In the noon time  
In the evening  
In the wee wee hours of the nighttime hour  
In the summer  
In the springtime  
In the autumn  
In the cold long winter winter nights  
My love is with you  
My love is with you my best friend  
My love is with you my brother  
My love is with you my sister  
My love is with you my mother  
My love is with you my father  
Im with you  repeat  
Ban the hand gun  chant
