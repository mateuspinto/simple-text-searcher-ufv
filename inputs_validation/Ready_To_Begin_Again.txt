When my teeth are rinsed in a glass by my bed  
And my hair lies somewhere in a drawer  
You know the world doesnt seem like a very nice place  
Not a very nice place anymore  
  
But I put in my teeth and I slap on my hair  
And a strange thing occurs when I do  
My teeth start to feel like my very own teeth  
And my hair like my very own too  
  
And Im ready to begin again  
Ready to begin again  
Reachin for the soap  
My heart is full o hope  
Again again  
  
Ready to begin again  
Looking fresh and bright I trust  
Ready to begin again  
As everybody must
