The cigarette of a single man  
Burns in the ashtray by his bed  
He pulls the ring of another can  
And holds it up beside his head  
The book he reads is on the floor  
Hes read it several times before  
What you got to go home to  
  
The cigarette of a single man  
Sits in the ashtray on the bar  
He sits and sifts through several plans  
But knows alone he wont go far  
He needs the love another has  
To help him if another can  
  
The cigarette of a single man  
Lays in the gutter by his side  
Now hes one of those little lambs  
Who strayed too far from the flock to find  
Hes better off without the grief  
That people wear between their teeth  
  
And in his mouth as hes asleep  
The cigarette of a single man
