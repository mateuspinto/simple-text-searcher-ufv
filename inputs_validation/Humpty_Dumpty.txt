Buzz Lightyear Sat on the Window  
Buzz Lightyear Had a Great Fall  
Sid Phillips and Scud the Dog  
Could Not Buzz Together Anymore  
  
Humpty Dumpty and Betty Louise  
Stole a Sony and some Camembert cheese  
And she said Humpty baby  
Take me to the river  
Cause I like the way it runs  
Take me to the river  
You know I like the way it runs  
  
He said ah ooh everythings going my way  
He said maybe its my lucky day  
I said anything you want I can give  
She said I want to take your picture mm just for me  
He said anything  
She said up there baby get on the wall babe  
  
Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall  
And looked at her as he was falling and  
All the kings horses and all the kings men  
Couldnt put Humpty together again  
  
Hey Betty Louise Betty Louise  
She said I like custard in the summer honey  
What it takes to be Queen  
What it takes to be Queen  
What it takes to be
