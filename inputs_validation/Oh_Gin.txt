Oh gin  
How could you treat me this way  
Oh treat me this way  
Oh gin  
How could you treat me this way  
Baby treat me this way  
You know you broke my heart  
Ever since you went away  
You gotta feel it and like it  
And if you move you gotta drill it and hold it  
Oh oh oh oh gin  
How could you treatin me this way  
You know you broke my heart  
Ever since you went away  
Oh gin  
How could you treat me this way  
Hey you treat me this way  
Oh gin  
How could you treat me this way  
How you treat me this way  
You know you broke my heart  
Ever since you went away  
You gotta feel it and like it  
And if you move it like it  
Oh oh oh oh gin  
How could you treat me this way  
You know Im gonna stay alone  
til youre coming back and play  
You know Ive been so sad  
Ever since you went away  
You know Ive been so sad  
Ever since you went away
