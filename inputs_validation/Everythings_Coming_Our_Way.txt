Open your eyes  
Let it begin with me  
Brand new day  
Fresh new way to live  
The mornin is callin  
Walk with me into the sun  
  
Everything is comin our way  
Everything is comin our way  
Everything is comin our way  
  
Heres my hand  
Reaching out to you  
Take it darlin  
And lead me on yeah  
  
Everything is comin our way  
Everything is comin our way  
Everything is comin our way  
Ah  
  
Everything is comin our way  
Everything is comin our way  
Everything is comin our way  
Ah  
  
I can feel it in my bones  
No man stands alone  
Sister Brother  
From all the same seed  
  
Everything is comin our way  
Everything is comin our way  
Everything is comin our way
