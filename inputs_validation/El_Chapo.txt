Best coke in the world going through your nostrils  
Plugs steady send the dope in by the boat load

A hundred bricks is nothin if you Jesus alozando  
My big toy meet me o I got it in the choke hold  
Spent a half a million last year on forgiatos  
And no I am not a catholic confessin is a no no  
So many bricks of brown and white you know we got a  
Snow roll

A little handgun in every pocket in my cargo  
And its a stack for a kilo if you get it in the jungle
