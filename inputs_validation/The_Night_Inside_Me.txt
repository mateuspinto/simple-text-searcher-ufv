I used to lay out in a field under the Milky Way  
With everything that I was feeling that I could not say  
With every doubt and every sorrow that was in my way  
Tearing around inside my head like it was there to stay  
  
Night in my eyes the night inside me  
There where the shadows and the night could hide me  
Night in my eyes  
Sky full of stars turning over me  
Waiting for night to set me free  
  
I caught a ride into the city every chance I got  
I wasnt sure there was a name for the life I sought  
Now Im a long way gone down the life I got  
I dont know how I believed some of the things I thought  
  
Night in my eyes the night inside me  
Here where the shadows gather to decide me  
Night in my eyes  
Out at the end of light and gravity  
Waiting for night  
  
It takes the night to clear all of this mess away  
The obligation the burden and the light of day  
It takes the night to fall between the world I obey  
And a world where I hear angels play  
Maybe I should go back to Spain  
  
I walk around inside the questions of my day  
I navigate the inner reaches of my disarray  
I pass the altars where fools and thieves hold sway  
I wait for night to come and lift this dread away  
  
Night in my eyes the night inside me  
Here where the shadows and the light divide me  
Night in my eyes  
Night full of promise and uncertainty  
Waiting for night to set me free
