I saw your face across the room  
Caught me like a favorite tune  
Talking about my girl on the radio  
Ooh ooh I knew I had to say hello  
  
A special moment  
Wonderin what lies ahead  
Was about to make my move  
When she took my arm and said  
  
We oughta take good advantage  
Of the party lights  
Slip away to the night  
Darling I want you  
To come home with me  
We oughta  
I wanna  
  
Girls got style  
Something a little insane  
Now shes acting like she owns me  
I see no reason to complain  
  
Chorus  
  
Hard as I try I cant remember why  
We never spent that time together  
She said Dont bother wanderin  
Around here tonight  
I see that look in you look in you  
We oughta follow through  
Oh its better late than never  
  
Oh we oughta take good advantage  
Of the party lights  
Slip away to the night  
Darling I want you  
To come home with me  
We oughta  
  
Take good advantage  
Real good advantage  
Darling I want you  
Darling I want you  
Come home with me  
Take good advantage  
Slip away  
Take good advantage  
Slip away  
Slip away
