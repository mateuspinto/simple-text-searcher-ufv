No New Years Day to celebrate  
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away  
No first of spring  
No song to sing  
In fact heres just another ordinary day  
  
No April rain  
No flowers bloom  
No wedding Saturday within the month of June  
But what it is is something true  
Made up of these three words that I must say to you  
  
I just called to say I love you  
I just called to say how much I care  
I just called to say I love you  
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart  
  
No summers high  
No warm July  
No harvest moon to light one tender August night  
  
No autumn breeze  
No falling leaves  
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies  
  
No Libra sun  
No Halloween  
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring  
But what it is though old so new  
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do  
  
I just called to say I love you  
I just called to say how much I care I do  
I just called to say I love you  
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart  
  
I just called to say I love you  
I just called to say how much I care I do  
I just called to say I love you  
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart of my heart of my heart  
  
I just called to say I love you  
I just called to say how much I care I do  
I just called to say I love you  
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart of my heart baby of my heart
