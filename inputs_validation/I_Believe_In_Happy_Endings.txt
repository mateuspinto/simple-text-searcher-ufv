I believe in happy endings  
Starry skies and dreams come true  
Ive believed it since I first met you  
I believe in new beginnings  
Extra innings brand new starts  
Loving hearts that care the way I do  
All these things and happy endings too  
Sad songs bring me right down with the blues  
Glad songs take me wherever I choose  
And I choose to be there  
So that I  
Can declare why  
I believe in happy endings  
Youre the reason loves the way  
And Ill believe it till my dying day  
I know the cost of tears and trouble  
Some get lost some make it through  
Me I made it cause I always knew  
That you believed in happy endings too  
  
Instrumental  
  
Sad songs bring me right down with the blues  
Glad songs take me wherever I choose  
And I choose to be there  
So that I  
Can declare  
I know the cost of tears and trouble  
I got lost but I got through  
And I made it cause I always knew  
That you believed in happy endings too  
You and me and happy endings too
