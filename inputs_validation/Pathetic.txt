It feels like theres nothing I can do  
It feels like theres nothing left to do  
Always feels like I must  
Wait  
Just a while  
Because anything worth having is worth the wait  
So it seems  
That this waitings left us somewhere inbetween  
It feels like theres nothing I can do  
It feels like theres nothing left to do  
Blind ambition is overrated  
Apathetic bored and jaded now  
You forget something  
I wanted to be left alone
