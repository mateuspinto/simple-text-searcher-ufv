You make me dizzy Miss Lizzy  
The way you rock and roll  
You make me dizzy Miss Lizzy  
When we do the stroll  
Come on Miss Lizzy  
Love me before I grow too old  
  
Come on give me fever  
Put your little hand in mine  
You make me dizzy dizzy Lizzy  
Oh girl you look so fine  
Just arocking and arolling  
Girl I said I wish you were mine  
  
You make me dizzy Miss Lizzy  
When you call my name  
Ooh baby  
Say youre driving me insane  
Cmon cmon cmon cmon baby  
I want to be your lover man  
  
Run and tell your mama  
I want you to be my bride  
Run and tell your brother  
Baby dont run and hide  
You make me dizzy Miss Lizzy  
Girl I want to marry you  
  
Come on give me fever  
Put your little hand in mine girl  
You make me dizzy dizzy Lizzy  
Girl you look so fine  
Youre just arocking and arolling  
Oh I said I wish you were mine
