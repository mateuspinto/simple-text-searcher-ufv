Oh my oh my oh my what if it was true  
And oh my oh my oh my tell me is it true  
Did he did he did he die upon that cross  
And did he did he did he come back across  
  
Jesus walking on the water  
Sweet Jesus walking in the sky  
Sinking sand took my hand raised me up  
And brought me up  
I can hold my head up high  
  
Will I will I will I be true to my birth  
And will I will I will I give what Im worth  
Oh yes sir yes sir yes sir I come when you call  
And yes sir yes sir yes sir sweet Jesus my allinall
