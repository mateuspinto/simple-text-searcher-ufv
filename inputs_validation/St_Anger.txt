Saint Anger round my neck  
Saint Anger round my neck  
He never gets respect  
Saint Anger round my neck  
  
You flush it out you flush it out  
Saint Anger round my neck  
You flush it out you flush it out  
He never gets respect  
You flush it out you flush it out  
Saint Anger round my neck  
You flush it out you flush it out  
He never gets respect  
  
Fuck it all and fuckin regrets  
I hit the lights on these dark sets  
I need a voice to let myself  
To let myself go free  
Fuck it all and fuckin no regrets  
I it the lights on these dark sets  
I tie a noose to hang myself  
Saint Anger round my neck  
  
I feel my world shake  
Like an earthquake  
Its hard to see clear  
Is it me Is it fear  
  
Im madly in anger with you  
Im madly in anger with you  
Im madly in anger with you  
Im madly in anger with you  
  
Saint Anger round my neck  
Saint Anger round my neck  
He never gets respect  
Saint Anger round my neck  
  
You flush it out you flush it out  
Saint Anger round my neck  
You flush it out you flush it out  
He never gets respect  
You flush it out you flush it out  
Saint Anger round my neck  
You flush it out you flush it out  
He never gets respect  
  
Fuck it all and fuckin no regrets  
I hit the lights on these dark sets  
I need a voice to let myself  
To let myself go free  
Fuck it all and fuckin no regrets  
I hit the lights on these dark sets  
Medallion noose I hang myself  
Saint Anger round my neck  
  
I feel my world shake  
Like an earthquake  
Its hard to see clear  
Is it me Is it fear  
  
Im madly in anger with you  
Im madly in anger with you  
Im madly in anger with you  
Im madly in anger with you  
  
And I want my anger to be healthy  
And I want my anger just for me  
And I need my anger not to control  
And I want my anger to be me  
  
And I need to set my anger free  
And I need to set my anger free  
And I need to set my anger free  
And I need to set my anger free  
  
Set it free  
  
Fuck it all and fuckin no regrets  
I hit the lights on these dark sets  
I need a voice to let myself  
To let myself go free  
Fuck it all and fuckin no regrets  
I it the lights on these dark sets  
I tie noose to hang myself  
Saint Anger round my neck  
  
I feel my world shake  
Like an earthquake  
Its hard to see clear  
Is it me Is it fear  
  
Im madly in anger with you  
Im madly in anger with you  
Im madly in anger with you  
Im madly in anger with you
