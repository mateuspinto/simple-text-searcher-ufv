As I walked out in the streets of Laredo  
As I walked out in Laredo one day  
I spied a poor cowboy wrapped up in white linen  
All wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay  
  
I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy  
These words he did say as I proudly stepped by  
Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story  
Im shot in the breast and I know I must die  
  
Twas once in the saddle I used to go ridin  
Once in the saddle I used to go gay  
First lead to drinkin and then to cardplaying  
Im shot in the breast and Im dying today  
  
Let six jolly cowboys come carry my coffin  
Let six pretty gals come to carry my pall  
Throw bunches of roses all over my coffin  
Throw roses to deaden the clods as they fall  
  
Oh beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly  
And play the dead march as you carry me along  
Take me to the green valley and lay the earth oer me  
For Im a poor cowboy and I know Ive done wrong  
  
We beat the drum slowly and played the fife lowly  
And bitterly wept as we carried him along  
For we all loved our comrade so brave young and handsome  
We all loved our comrade although he done wrong
