In the howlin wind  
Comes a stingin rain  
See it drivin nails  
Into the souls on the tree of pain  
  
From the firefly  
A red orange glow  
See the face of fear  
Runnin scared in the valley below  
  
Bullet the blue sky  
Bullet the blue sky  
Bullet the blue  
Bullet the blue  
  
In the locust wind  
Comes a rattle and hum  
Jacob wrestled the angel  
And the angel was overcome  
  
You plant a demon seed  
You raise a flower of fire  
We see them burnin crosses  
See the flames higher and higher  
  
Woh woh bullet the blue sky  
Bullet the blue sky  
Bullet the blue  
Bullet the blue  
  
Suit and tie comes up to me  
His face red like a rose on a thorn bush  
Like all the colours of a royal flush  
And hes peelin off those dollar bills  
Slappin em down  
One hundred two hundred  
  
And I can see those fighter planes  
And I can see those fighter planes  
Across the mud huts as children sleep  
Through the alleys of a quiet city street  
  
Up the staircase to the first floor  
We turn the key and slowly unlock the door  
As a man breathes into his saxophone  
And through the walls you hear the city groan  
  
Outside is America  
Outside is America America  
  
See across the field see the sky ripped open  
See the rain comin through the gapin wound  
Howlin the women and children  
Who run into the arms of America
