Lay down your head  
And look to your window  
Where do you go  
When its not where youre going  
And how do you see  
When the light isnt shining  
Where you could be  
If you worked out the timing  
  
And how does it feel when the world comes on so real and true  
And how do you do the things you do to you  
  
If I were a king  
And you were a lady  
What would I sing  
To say what Im saying  
And would you believe  
The verses left open  
The heart on my sleeve  
The rhyming all broken  
  
And how does it feel when the world comes on so real and true  
And how do you do the things you do to you  
  
Sell me a river  
And Ill skate away  
To the downstream  
Where I did play  
So easy minded  
Like a hill on the skyline  
Tripped up and blinded  
Getting lost on the sidelines  
  
And how does it feel when the world comes on so real and true  
And how do you do the things you do to you  
And how do you do the things you do to you
