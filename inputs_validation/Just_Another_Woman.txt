Just another woman  
In my life  
Just another woman  
Lost in the night  
Just another woman  
Keepin in touch with a man  
  
Knock upon my window  
Late at night making me believe  
that somethings not right  
I look through the window but all I can see  
Is the rain  
Standing on my doorstep  
Not very old looking so helpless  
And looking so cold  
A woman in need of some help  
Most have lost her way  
  
She was tall  
She was lost  
She could smile  
And her words got crossed  
  
Just another woman  
In my life  
Just another woman  
Lost in the night  
Just another woman  
Keepin in touch with a man  
  
As we sat by the fire  
The flame just grew  
Talking about just the things we knew  
Watching a new day arise outside my room  
The more I listened the more she told  
And in fascination my heart was sold  
Weaving in and out of my mind  
With a skidder off now  
  
She was tall  
She was lost  
She could smile  
And her words got crossed  
  
Just another woman  
In my life  
Just another woman  
Lost in the night  
Just another woman  
Keepin in touch with a man
