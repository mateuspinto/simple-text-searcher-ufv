Under a silver moon tropical temperature  
I feel my lotus bloom come closer  
I want your energy I want your aura  
You are my destiny my mantra  
  
Never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye  
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your life  
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical tonight oh oh  
  
Take me down to the river  
Underneath the blood orange sun  
Say my name like a scripture  
Keep my heart beating like a drum  
  
Legendary lovers we could be legendary  
Legendary lovers we should be legendary  
  
Go down in history  
Go down together into infinity forever  
Youre Cleopatra  
Youre blushing Juliet  
Anything for your love a ride or die  
  
Never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye  
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your life  
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical tonight oh oh  
  
Take me down to the river  
Underneath the blood orange sun  
Say my name like a scripture  
Keep my heart beating like a drum  
  
Legendary lovers we could be legendary  
Legendary lovers we should be legendary  
  
Take me down to the river  
Underneath the blood orange sun  
Say my name like a scripture  
Keep my heart beating like a drum  
  
Legendary lovers we could be legendary  
Legendary lovers we should be legendary  
  
Take me down to the river  
Underneath the blood orange sun  
Say my name like a scripture  
Keep my heart beating like a drum  
  
Legendary lovers we could be legendary  
Legendary lovers we should be legendary
