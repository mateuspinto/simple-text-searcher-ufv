God rest ye merry gentlemen  
Let nothing you dismay  
Remember Christ our savior  
Was born on Christmas day  
To save us all from Satans power  
When we were gone astray  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
  
From God our heavenly father  
The blessed angel came  
And unto certain shepherds  
Brought tidings of the same  
How that in Bethlehem was born  
The Son of God by name  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
  
Fear not said the angel  
Let nothing you affright  
This day is born a savior  
Of the pure virgin bright  
To free all those who trust in him  
From Satans power and might  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
  
And when they came to Bethlehem  
Where our dear savior lay  
They found him in the manger  
Where oxen feed on hay  
His mother Mary knelled down  
And to the Lord did pray  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
  
God rest ye merry gentlemen  
Let nothing you dismay  
Remember Christ our savior  
Was born on Christmas day
