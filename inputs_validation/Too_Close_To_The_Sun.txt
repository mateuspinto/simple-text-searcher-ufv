There must be a thousand ways  
Holding us within this maze  
Every path we take leads us astray  
Comfort me my only son  
Till the day my work is done  
Theres no earthly reason we should stay  
  
And when the wind gets under these wings  
You will feel what freedom brings  
Stay right by me walk dont run  
I dont want you flying too close to the sun  
  
Turn your eyes towards the light  
Steal away in silent flight  
The skies are calling out to you and me  
Over sea and over land  
God protect us with your hand  
Bring us safely to our destiny  
  
And now the wind is under our wings  
We can taste what freedom brings  
Stay right by me walk dont run  
I dont want you flying too close to the sun  
  
God forgive his fall from grace  
The sea conceals his resting place  
Can we learn to stay behind the line  
If we have the means to fly  
Some of us will surely die  
Being reckless was his only crime  
  
And now the wind is under our wings  
We can taste what freedom brings  
Stay right by me walk dont run  
I dont want you flying too close to the sun
