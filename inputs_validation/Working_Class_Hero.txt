As soon as your born they make you feel small  
By giving you no time instead of it all  
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all  
A working class hero is something to be  
  
They hurt you at home and they hit you at school  
They hate you if youre clever and they despise a fool  
Till youre so fucking crazy you cant follow their rules  
A working class hero is something to be  
  
When theyve tortured and scared you for twenty odd years  
Then they expect you to pick a career  
When you cant really function youre so full of fear  
A working class hero is something to be  
  
Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV  
And you think youre so clever and youre classless and free  
But youre still fucking peasants as far as I can see  
A working class hero is something to be  
A working class hero is something to be  
  
Theres room at the top they are telling you still  
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill  
If you want to be like the fool on the hill  
A working class hero is something to be  
A working class hero is something to be  
If you want to be a hero well just follow me
