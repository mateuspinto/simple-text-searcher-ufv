A vision a flash of light  
A gift we were given within each others dreams  
We lived in the gardens of Avalon  
Together believed that we could live there forever  
Then it faded away  
Forgetting we wandered too far from the land wed known  
  
Of all the lonely people youre among the lucky few  
If it comes even once in a life  
  
Chorus  
Love is a lesson hard to learn  
Its never as easy to return  
But if youre willing to go on  
Well find a way back to Avalon  
  
Avalon  
  
They had it it wasnt far away or imagined  
He held her in his arms and planned it all  
The towers of Avalon  
They warned him he only turned around for a moment  
And everything had changed  
He noticed the sun on her face as she turned away  
  
All the lonely people youre among the lucky few  
If it comes even once in a life  
  
Chorus  
  
And when you come to know the miracle its mystical  
When someone elses heart is in your hand  
I learned too late now I must try and find a way back home ohh  
  
Here is a lesson hard to learn  
Its never as easy to return  
But if youre willing to go on  
Well find a way back to Avalon  
  
Avalon  
We gotta go back someday well get it back  
Avalon  
We gotta get it back  
Avalon  
Somebody show me a way somebody tell me the way  
Avalon  
  
Avalon  
We gotta go back someday well get it back  
Avalon  
We gotta get it back  
Avalon  
Somebody show me a way somebody tell me the way  
Avalon
