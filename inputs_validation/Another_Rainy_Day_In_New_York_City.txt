Another rainy day in New York City  
Softly sweet so silently it falls  
As crosstown traffic crawls  
  
Memories in my way in New York City  
Tender tough too tragic to be true  
And nothing i can do  
  
City workers cheer  
The taxis disappear  
Another rainy day in New York City  
  
Another spacey stay in New York city  
High up in an overpriced hotel  
The view is really swell  
  
Windy wet and gray in New york City  
No one here i really want to see  
Old friends and family  
  
So suddenly serene  
The air is fresh and clean  
Another rainy day in New York City
