Back through the years I go wondering once again  
Back to the seasons of my youth  
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us  
And how my mamma put these rags to use  
  
There were rags of many colours and every piece was small  
And I didnt have a coat and it was way down in the fall  
Mamma sewed the rags together sewing ever piece with love  
She made my coat of many colours that I was so proud of  
  
As she sewed she told the story from the bible she had read  
About a coat of many colours Joseph wore and they she said  
Perhaps this coat will bring you much love and happiness  
And I just couldnt wait to wear it and mamma blessed it with a kiss  
  
My coat of many colours that mamma made for me  
Made only rags but I wore it so proudly  
Although we had no money oh I was rich as I could be  
In my coat of many colours my mamma made for me  
  
So with patches on my breaches and holes in both my shoes  
In my coat of many colours I hurried off to school  
Just to find the others laughing and makin fun of me  
In my coat of many colours my mamma made for me  
  
Oh I couldnt understand it for I felt I was rich  
And I told them of the love my mamma sewed in ever stitch  
And I told them all the story mamma told me while she sewed  
And how my coat of many colours is worth more than all of their clothes  
  
They didnt under stand it and I tried to make them see  
That one is only poor only if they choose to be  
Now I know we have no money but Im as rich as I could be  
In my coat of many colours my mamma made for me  
In my coat of many colours my mamma just made for me
