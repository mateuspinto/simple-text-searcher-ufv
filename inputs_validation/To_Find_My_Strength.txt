Sometimes my heart gets weak  
Sometimes my soul feels the edge of the night  
Sometimes my will my foolish pride  
Carries me far far away from your side  
And when I lose my way I know  
I look to You to find my strength  
Carry me to the end of my days  
A steady hand to lead me through  
Arms of faith to bring me back to you  
I will keep my eyes on love  
Set my heart on things above  
When my soul is so afraid  
I look to you to find my strength  
Sometimes my hope it slips away  
Sometimes my dreams come crashing down  
Sometimes my life this crazy life  
Has a heart has a heart of its own  
And when I lose my way  
You know  
I look to you to find my strength  
Carry me to the end of my days  
A steady hand to lead me through  
Arms of faith to bring me back to you  
I will keep my eyes on love  
Set my heart on things above  
When my soul is so afraid  
I look to You to find my strength  
When the tears keep pouring down  
And my lips cant make a sound  
I know you hear my prayer  
And your strength is always there  
I look to you to find my strength  
Carry me to the end of my days  
A steady hand to lead me through  
Arms of faith to bring me back to you  
I will keep my eyes on love  
Set my heart on things above  
When my soul is so afraid  
I look to you to find my strength  
And when I lose my way I know
