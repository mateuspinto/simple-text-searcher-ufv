Got my hands on a little bit of dough  
So I went to the grocery store  
And got some steaks to go  
Went by and picked up my gal Teddi Jo  
We had ourselves a picnic  
Beside a dirty road  
  
Rooty toot toot  
Rooty toot toot  
We had it made in the shade  
Like a bell through the hoop  
Spinning and tumbling inside this  
Hoola hoop  
Living and learning rooty toot toot  
  
We laid out a blanket  
And started a fire  
Had the radio playing  
From inside the car  
I took off my shirt  
And kicked off my shoes  
She read the paper  
And told me the news  
She said Theres a lot of people out there  
Who are at the end of their rope  
Sometimes baby youve got to lay low  
  
Rooty toot toot  
Rooty toot toot  
We had it made in the shade  
Like a bell through the hoop  
Spinning and tumbling inside this  
Hoola hoop  
Livin and learnin rooty toot toot  
  
We stayed there all day  
We both get us some real  
Good suntans  
I thought that was OK  
Sometimes life can be so grand  
  
We were getting ready  
To shake out that place  
When the Illinois state trooper  
Got in my face  
He said Youre on private property  
But once he cooled down he was OK  
Sometimes youre golden man  
Thats all I got to say  
  
Rooty toot toot  
Rooty toot toot  
We had it made in the shade  
Like a bell through the hoop  
Spinnin and tumblin inside this  
Hoola hoop  
Livin and learnin rooty toot toot
