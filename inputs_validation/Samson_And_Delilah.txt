If I had my way I would tear this old building down  
  
Well Delilah was a woman she was fine and fair  
She had good looks God knows and coal black hair  
Delilah she gained old Samsons mind  
When first he saw this woman you know he couldnt believe his mind  
  
Delilah she climbed up on Samsons knee  
Said tell me where your strength lies if you please  
She spoke so kind and she talked so fair  
Well Samson said Delilah cut off my hair  
  
You can shave my head clean as my hand  
And my strength will become as natural as any old man  
  
If I had my way if I had my way if I had my way  
I would tear this old building down  
  
You read about Samson all from his works  
He was the strongest man that ever had lived on earth  
One day when Samson was walking along  
Looked down on the ground he saw an old jawbone  
  
He stretched out his arm God knows chains broke like thread  
When he got to moving ten thousand was dead  
  
If I had my way if I had my way if I had my way  
I would tear this old building down  
  
Now Samson and the lion they got in a tack  
Samson he crawled up on the lions back  
You read about this lion he killed a man with his paws  
But Samson got his hands around that lions jaws  
  
He ripped the beast till he killed him dead  
The bees made honey in the lions head  
  
If I had my way if I had my way if I had my way  
I would tear this old building down
