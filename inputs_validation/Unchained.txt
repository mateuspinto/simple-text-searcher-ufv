You said  
I cannot get there from here baby  
And I dont care where Im goin  
Heres to your thin red line  
Im stepping over  
  
Thought youd never miss me  
Til I got a Fat City address  
Nonstop talker what a rocker  
Blueeyed murder in a size five dress  
  
Change nothing stays the same  
Unchained yeah you hit the ground running  
Change and nothing stays the same  
Unchained yeah you hit the ground running  
  
No I dont ask for permission  
This is my chance to fly  
Maybe enough aint enough for you  
But its my turn to try  
  
Thought youd never miss me  
Til I got a Fat City address  
Nonstop talker what a rocker  
Blueeyed murder in a sideswiped dress  
  
Change nothing stays the same  
Unchained and ya hit the ground running  
Change and nothing stays the same  
Unchained yeah ya hit the ground running  
  
Change nothing stays the same  
Unchained and ya hit the ground running  
Change and nothing stays the same  
Unchained yeah ya hit the ground running  
  
Take a look at this  
Hey man that suit is you  
Youll get some leg tonight for sure  
Tell us how you do  
Come on Dave give me a break  
Hey hey hey hey one break coming up  
  
Change and nothing stays the same  
Unchained yeah ya hit the ground running  
Change and nothing stays the same  
Unchained yeah ya hit the ground running  
Change and nothing stays the same  
Unchained yeah ya hit the ground running  
Change and nothing stays the same  
Unchained yeah ya hit the ground running
