Stand and rise and before your eyes  
The lions will appear  
And when they do theyll be filling you  
With all the lies you will need to hear  
  
Mr Politician just keep on dishin  
Your shit for the TV screen  
Turn off his camera hell drop the propaganda  
Faster than the poverty that he just seen  
  
Got to bring it home  
We got to bring it home  
  
See his campaign run by the power funds  
And makin all the deals he can  
Isnt it funny what greed and money  
Can do to the soul of a man  
  
We dont seen nothin hear nothin  
Just get their news stuffed down our throats at 10  
Makes it hard to conceive who the fuck to believe  
When I dont see no means to an end  
  
Chorus  
We got to bring it home  
I dont know what to believe  
We got to bring it home  
Dont you think youre fooling me  
We got to bring it home  
In this world thats grown so cold  
We got to bring it home  
We will never know until we bring it home  
  
Watch the walls around come tumbling down  
Like a house thats built on a hill  
How can we change a thing or even get in the ring  
If were living our lives in guilt  
  
We dont see it comin hear it comin  
Acting like we know nothing chills me to the bone  
Sure as hell stop foolin ourselves  
Till we bring it home  
  
Chorus  
  
Time has come now to bring it home  
We got to get it home  
Time has come now to bring it home  
We got to get it home  
The truth we will never find  
Until we bring it home
