Please dont throw you away we need you to stay  
When you die a part of us dies  
Not the body but part of the soul  
You have a light for us we need every glimmer  
Dont destroy yourself in a little bit of snow  
When there is no feeling and no pain  
It only lasts a little while  
When one light goes out a part of all of us cries  
  
Please hang on for us  
Please give you to us  
Dont destroy yourself in a little bit of snow  
  
Please dont throw you away we need you to stay  
When you die a part of us dies  
Not the body but part of the soul  
Drink the sunshine warm to the rain  
Keep the glimmer alive for all of us  
And a million matches in the night  
Will help to light the way  
When one light goes out  
A part of all of us cries  
  
Please hang on for us  
Please give you to us  
Dont destroy yourself in a little bit of snow  
  
Drink the sunshine warm to the rain  
Keep the glimmer alive for all of us  
And a million matches in the night  
Will help to light the way  
When one light goes out  
A part of all of us cries
