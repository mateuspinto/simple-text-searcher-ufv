Verse Bless The Lord O my soul  
O my soul  
Worship his holy name  
Sing like never before  
O my soul  
Ill worship your holy name  
  
The sun comes up  
Its a new day dawning  
Its time to sing your song again  
  
Whatever may pass  
And whatever lies before me  
Let me by singing  
When the evening comes  
  
Bless The Lord O my soul  
O my soul  
Worship his holy name  
Sing like never before  
O my soul  
Ill worship your holy name  
  
Your rich in love  
And your slow to anger  
Your name is great  
And your heart is kind  
  
For all your goodness  
I will keep on singing  
Ten thousand reasons  
For my heart to find  
  
Bless The Lord O my soul  
O my soul  
Worship his holy name  
Sing like never before  
O my soul  
Ill worship your holy name
