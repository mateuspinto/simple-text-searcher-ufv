Remember the good old 1980s  
When things were so uncomplicated  
I wish I could go back there again  
And everything could be the same  
  
Ive got a ticket to the moon  
Ill be leaving here any day soon  
Yeah Ive got a ticket to the moon  
But Id rather see the sunrise in your eyes  
  
Got a ticket to the moon  
Ill be rising high above the earth so soon  
And the tears I cry might turn into the rain  
That gently falls upon your window  
Youll never know  
  
Ticket to the moon  
Fly fly through a troubled sky  
Up to a new world shining bright  
  
Flying high above  
Soaring madly through the mysteries that come  
Wondering sadly if the ways that led me here  
Could turn around and I would see you there  
Standing there  
  
Ticket to the moon  
Flight leaves here today from Satellite 2  
As the minutes go by what shall I do  
I paid the fare what more can I say  
Its just one way  
  
Ticket to the moon
