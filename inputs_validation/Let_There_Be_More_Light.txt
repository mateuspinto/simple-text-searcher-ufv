Far far far away way  
People heard him say say  
I will find a way way  
There will come a day day  
Something will be done  
  
Then at last the mighty ship  
Descending on a point of flame  
Made contact with the human race  
And melted hearts  
  
Now now now is the time time  
Time to be be be aware  
  
Carters father saw him there and  
Knew the road revealed to him  
The living soul of  
  
Oh my something in my eye eye  
Something in the sky sky  
Waiting there for me  
  
The outer lock rolled slowly back  
The service men were heard to sigh  
For there revealed in glowing robes  
Was Lucy in the sky  
  
Oh oh did you ever know know  
Never ever will they  
I cannot say  
  
Something in his cosmic art  
And glowing slightly from his toes  
The psychic and the nations fly
