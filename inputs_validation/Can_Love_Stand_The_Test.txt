Did I lose your love a long time ago  
Or did I just wear it out Baby I dont know  
Seems like anymore were not on the same page  
In the same book or on the same stage  
  
We say the words but they feel all wrong  
Like a happy blues like a sad love song  
How two people can bow and scrape  
For every shred of tenderness  
  
Can love stand the test  
Of times that surround us  
Memories that astound us  
Joy and happiness  
Can love stand the test  
  
A long time ago or was it just yesterday  
Why would we fall out of love Baby can you say  
Dont look at me like Im stranger now  
Have I changed that much Baby tell me how  
How two people could bow and scrape  
For every shred of tenderness  
  
Can love stand the test  
Of times that surround us  
Memories that astound us  
Joy and happiness  
Can love stand the test  
  
We said forever for always for good  
But the years were not impressed  
  
Can love stand the test  
Of time that surrounds us  
Moments that astound us  
Can love stand the test  
Of time that surrounds us  
Moments that astound us  
Joy and happiness  
Joy and happiness  
Joy and happiness
