Did you see his name in the local paper  
Stole a tin of beans from a cutpriced grocery store  
The judge said He must pay  
So he put him on probation and the paper gave his name  
Did you see his name in the criminal section  
And the center page gave his name and his address  
They stopped him doing it again  
So they put him to dishonour and put the man to shame  
He lost his little job  
His employer was absolved of blame  
His world just crumbled down  
Incidentally did you see his name in the obiturary column  
Letters edged in black  
Life was much too hard to live  
So he brought it to an end  
In his gasfilled maisonette  
Because he couldnt stand the strain  
La la la la la  
Life was much too hard to live  
So he brought it to an end  
In his gasfilled maisonette  
Because he couldnt stand the strain  
Did you see his name  
Did you see his name  
Did you see his name
