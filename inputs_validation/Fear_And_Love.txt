We always have a choice  
At least I we think we do  
We can always use our voice  
I thought this to be true  
We can live in fear  
Extend ourselves to love  
We can fall below or lift ourselves above  
  
Chorus  
Fear can stop you loving  
Love can stop your fear  
Fear can stop you loving  
But its not always that clear  
  
I always tried so hard  
To share myselve around  
Now Im closing up again  
Drilling through the ground  
  
Chorus  
Fear can stop you loving  
Love can stop your fear  
Fear can stop you loving  
But its not always that clear  
  
I love to give myself away  
But I find it hard to trust  
I got no map to find my way  
And whats these clouds of dust  
  
Chorus  
Fear can stop you loving  
Love can stop your fear  
Fear can stop you loving  
But its not always that clear  
  
But its not always that clear  
But its not always that clear  
But its not always that clear  
But its not always that clear
