I remember standing on the corner at midnight  
Trying to get my courage up  
There was this long lovely dancer in a little club downtown  
I loved to watch her do her stuff  
Through the long lonely nights she filled my sleep  
Her body softly swaying to that smoky beat  
Down on Mainstreet  
  
In the pool halls the hustlers and the losers  
I used to watch em through the glass  
Well Id stand outside at closing time  
Just to watch her walk on past  
Unlike all the other ladies she looked so young and sweet  
As she made her way alone down that empty street  
Down on Mainstreet  
  
And sometimes even now when Im feeling lonely and beat  
I drift back in time and I find my feet  
Down on Mainstreet  
Down on Mainstreet
