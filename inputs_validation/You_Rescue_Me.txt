Among the stars on this side of heaven  
I lay broken and destroyed  
When people on the earth have cut you down  
The skys the only place to hide  
And as I floated in the moonlit night  
You arrived to take me home  
I kissed your hand and I came back to life  
And all the wrong became all right  
In all of my dreams  
You rescue me  
It always seems you rescue me  
I was wandering down endless roads  
A fallen angel in the cold  
You appeared before me like a vision  
To whisper love I used to know  
So easily you gave to me secret promises  
Like only magic words can flow  
In all of my dreams  
You rescue me  
It always seems you rescue me
