I let it fall my heart  
And as it fell you rose to claim it  
It was dark and I was over  
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me  
  
My hands theyre strong  
But my knees were far too weak  
To stand in your arms  
Without falling to your feet  
  
But theres a side to you  
That I never knew never knew  
All the things youd say  
They were never true never true  
And the games you play  
You would always win always win  
  
Chorus  
But I set fire to the rain  
Watched it pour as I touched your face  
Well it burned while I cried  
Cause I heard it screaming Out your name  
Your name  
  
When I lay with you  
I could stay there  
Close my eyes  
Feel you here forever  
You and me together nothing gets better  
  
Cause theres a side to you  
That I never knew never knew  
All the things youd say  
They were never true never true  
And the games you play  
You would always win always win  
  
But I set fire to the rain  
Watched it pour as I touched your face  
Well it burned while I cried  
Cause I heard it screaming out your name  
Your name  
  
I set fire to the rain  
And I threw us into the flames  
Well it felt something died  
Cause I knew that that was  
The last time the last time  
  
Sometimes I wake up by the door  
That heart you caught must be waiting for you  
Even now when were already over  
I cant help myself from looking for you  
  
I set fire to the rain  
Watched it pour as I touched your face  
Well it burned while I cried  
Cause I heard it screaming Out your name  
Your name  
  
I set fire to the rain  
And I threw us into the flames  
Well it felt something died  
Cause I knew that that was the last time  
The last time  
  
Let it burn  
Let it burn  
Let it burn
