Freedom is just a breath away  
Will you live to see the day  
As the heat intensifies  
You start to choke your insides fry  
  
Seizure now sets in  
Torture will begin  
Twisted bodies lie  
Waiting now to die  
  
Choke on it  
As your tongue goes down  
Choke on it  
Death is all around  
  
Screaming fills your frenzied mind  
No way out no more time  
Example made from those to see  
Your freedom turned to misery  
  
World is all around  
Of what they have found  
Lesson to be learn  
You will not return  
  
Choke on it  
As your tongue goes down  
Choke on it  
Death is all around
