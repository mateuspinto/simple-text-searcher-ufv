Romeo and the lonely girl  
They seemed to hit it off  
Till Romeo told the lonely girl  
I must take my leave my love  
  
It was these few words I overheard  
And thought I would move in  
But before I could the lonely girl  
Had fallen in love again  
  
Oh poor Romeo  
Sitting out on his own  
Oh poor Romeo  
  
Romeo he had it rough  
The guy youd like to burn  
But everything that Romeo had  
You can bet it was well earned  
  
For all his good looks there were scars that he took  
And a lesson to be learned  
Never judge lovers by a good looking covers  
The lover might be spurred  
  
Oh poor Romeo  
Sitting out on his own  
Oh poor Romeo  
  
Oh poor Romeo  
Sitting out on his own  
Oh poor Romeo  
  
Oh poor Romeo  
Sitting out on his own  
Oh poor Romeo  
  
Oh poor Romeo  
Sitting out on his own  
Oh poor Romeo  
  
Romeo he like to put it around  
He was everybodys friend  
But in the end even Romeo found  
On no one could he depend  
  
For all his charms in someone elses arms  
Lonely girl safely lay  
When the train came in it had to leave again  
And Romeo pulled away  
  
Oh poor Romeo  
Sitting all on his own  
Oh poor Romeo  
  
Poor Romeo Repeat x6
