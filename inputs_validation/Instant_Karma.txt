Instant karmas gonna get you  
Gonna knock you right on the head  
You better get yourself together  
Pretty soon youre gonna be dead  
What in the world you thinking of  
Laughing in the face of love  
What on earth you tryin to do  
Its up to you yeah you  
  
Instant karmas gonna get you  
Gonna look you right in the face  
Better get yourself together darlin  
Join the human race  
How in the world you gonna see  
Laughin at fools like me  
What on earth do you think you are  
A super star  
Well right you are  
  
Well we all shine on  
Like the moon and the stars and the sun  
Well we all shine on  
On and on and on  
  
Instant karmas gonna get you  
Gonna knock you off your feet  
Better recognize your brothers  
Everyone that you meet  
Why in the world are we here  
Surely not to live in pain and fear  
Why on earth are you there  
When youre everywhere  
Come get your share  
  
Well we all shine on  
Like the moon and the stars and the sun  
Yeah we all shine on  
On and on and on and on  
  
Well we all shine on  
Like the moon and the stars and the sun  
Yeah we all shine on  
Come on and on and on and on  
  
Shine on
