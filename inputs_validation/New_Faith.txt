Holy man open up your eyes  
To the ways of the world youve been so blind  
As the walls of religion come crashing down  
Hows the ignorance taste the second time around  
  
Tell me how it feels knowing chaos will never end  
Tell me what its like when the celebration begins  
  
Welcome to the horror of the revelation  
Tell me what you think of your savior now  
I reject all the biblical views of the truth  
Dismiss it as the folklore of the times  
I wont be force fed prophecies  
From a book of untruths for the weakest mind  
Join the new faith for the celebration  
Cult of new faith fuels the devastation  
  
Holy man come and worship me  
I am all that you ever wanted to be  
Im the life of indulgence you never knew  
The epitome of evil shining through  
  
Tell me how it feels knowing chaos will never end  
Tell me what its like when the celebration begins  
  
Welcome to the horror of the revelation  
Tell me what you think of your savior now  
I reject all the biblical views of the truth  
Dismiss it as the folklore of the times  
I wont be force fed prophecies  
From a book of untruths for the weakest mind  
I keep the bible in a pool of blood  
So that none of its lies can affect me  
  
This is new faith  
A different way of life  
Witness the shame  
See for yourself the lies  
Ill take the fight  
Bring it every time any time  
Refuse to let them win  
My heresy begins  
  
Pray for life wish for death  
Pray for life know in time youll pray for death  
  
Tear it away  
It lives inside your mind  
Silence the fear  
That keeps you pure inside  
Now you can see  
Lifes atrocities endlessly  
Witness the miracle  
Witness the miracle  
  
Pray for life wish for death  
Pray for life with every breath  
Youll pray for death youll pray for death  
Embrace new faith embrace new faith  
Yeah new faith yeah new faith
