You bring light in  
To a dark place  
Walking in light  
Glowing walking in light  
Gold ring around you the  
Hues of you the  
Golden sunlight of you  
  
You bring light in  
You bring light in  
You bring light in

Cool wind following  
Following after you  
Rising for you  
Your skin beautiful  
Everything comes natural  
Fantastic fan  
Rocking rocking floating
