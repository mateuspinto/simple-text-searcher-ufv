Lady of the Dawn you opened up my sleeping eyes  
I never lnew that I was born  
Well I like you for your body but I love cause youre wise  
I am your prisoner Oh my Lady of the Dawn  
You are the dealer  
In this strange uncertain game  
Take my cards and deal again  
I can feel my life is changing  
Woman  
Now you taught me how to learn  
Teach me to earn  
The love you give to me  
The love you give to me  
Lady of the Dawn you opened up my sleeping eyes  
I never lnew that I was born  
Well I like you for your body but I love cause youre wise  
I am your prisoner Oh my Lady of the Dawn  
I was waiting  
In the darkness of the night  
Only now I see the light  
Softly shining in the silence  
Woman  
If you really hold the key  
Turn it for me  
And help me understand  
And help me understand  
Lady of the Dawn you opened up my sleeping eyes  
I never lnew that I was born  
Well I like you for your body but I love cause youre wise  
I am your prisoner Oh my Lady of the Dawn
