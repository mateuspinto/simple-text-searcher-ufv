Its quarter to three and theres no one in the place except you and me  
So set em up Joe I got a little story you ought to know  
Were drinkin my friend on to the end of a brief episode  
Make it one for my baby and one more for the road  
  
I got the routine gonna drop another quarter in this machine  
Feelin so bad I got to have the music dreamy and sad  
I could tell you a lot but you have got to be true to your code  
Make it one for my baby and one more for the road  
  
Joe youd never know it but Im a kind of poet  
And I got a lot of things to say  
But when Im gloomy just listen to me until its all talked away  
  
Well thats how it goes and Joe I know youre gettin anxious to close  
Thanks thanks for the cheer hope you didnt mind my bendin your ear  
The torch that I found must be drowned or soon might explode  
Make it one for my baby and one more for the road  
One more for the road
