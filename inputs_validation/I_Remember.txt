I shouldve known better cmon  
I shouldve known better cmon  
How l long for those warm summer nights  
Of playing the fool and getting uptight  
Crush my precious wish to the ground  
You are the sunshine taste of forgive and forget  
  
Oh I remember having all the love to give  
I remember a precious wish upon my loving lips  
You have touched my mind my soul and my everything  
Oh I remember having all the love to give  
I remember a precious wish upon my loving lips  
Please oh please help me  
  
Looking back at what we had  
Say I still want you so much  
Say I was loving you for just one reason  
Loving you for just one season  
Youre required for desire  
  
Oh I remember having all the love to give  
I remember a precious wish upon my loving lips  
You have touched my mind my soul and my everything  
Oh I remember having all the love to give  
I remember a precious wish upon my loving lips  
Please oh please help me  
  
Oh I remember  
Oh I remember  
  
Say I was say I was loving you loving you loving you  
Loving you loving you loving you  
Please oh please help me  
  
Oh I remember having all the love to give  
I remember a precious wish upon my loving lips  
Oh I remember having all the love to give  
Please oh please help me  
Please oh please help me  
Please oh please help me  
  
And I try to act naturally
