How much love do you need  
Before you give your love to me  
How much time before it grows  
How much love I want to know  
  
What can I do  
What can I say  
The last thing I want  
Is to drive you away  
How much love does it take  
How much love for heaven sake  
  
How much love how much love  
Do I rush right in or do I hesitate  
How much love  
How much love how much love  
  
Am I tryin too hard  
Give me some kind of clue  
There must be a way to get through to you  
Should I come on strong or do I hesitate  
Do I rush right in or do I wait  
  
How much love how much love  
Do I rush right in or do I hesitate  
How much love  
How much love how much love  
  
I got so much love  
Dont know where to begin  
Im pleadin with you babe  
Youve gotta let me in  
  
How much love  
How much love how much love  
  
I got so much love  
Dont know where to begin  
Im pleadin with you babe  
Youve gotta let me in  
  
How much love do you need  
Before you give yourself to me  
Should I come on strong or do I hesitate  
Do I rush right in or should I wait

Do I rush right in or do I hesitate
