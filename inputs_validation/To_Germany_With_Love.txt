I am an emigre  
I write to Germany  
In foreign words  
A tongue of actuality  
  
Hands in grey gloves  
To Germany with love  
A war between the wars  
A war between the wars  
  
Triumph over by  
Gone sorrow  
Can in unity be won  
Let them all pursue this purpose  
  
Till reality is gone  
I am an unexpected spy  
From the outside of my eye  
Translate it first  
  
Then comprehend  
Im here indeed  
But there I stand  
I write to Germany  
  
I write to Germany  
To Germany with love  
To Germany with love  
This is the turn of colours  
  
All real some still unseen  
There is no more decision  
Cause theres too much in between  
Let us build a nightmare nation  
  
Learn and work as never yet  
That this cold new generation  
Faith in its own fears beget  
Here comes the modern rat  
  
Here comes the terror squad  
Ours is the salt of wisdom  
Here we come all dressed in black  
From the ruins risen slowly  
  
To the future turned we stand  
Flourish in this blessing glory  
Flourish German fatherland  
I write to Germany  
  
I write to Germany  
All quiet in Germany  
All quiet in Germany
