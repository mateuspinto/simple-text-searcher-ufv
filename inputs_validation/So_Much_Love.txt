Another day has come and gone  
They fade away like winter sun  
I should have felt what I I didnt see  
I should have known that you needed me  
  
But now youre here  
My heart is young my mind is clear  
The past was gone when you came to me  
You were always a part of my destiny  
  
I always believed that this day had to come  
There was not enough time  
And too much left undone  
I could never deny  
Just how far we had come  
  
Ive got so much love  
So much love  
So much love  
So much love  
  
Another day to spend with you  
Thats all I ask just to be with you  
And how I feel you just dont know  
And now youre here I wont let you go  
  
I always believed that this day had to come  
There was not enough time  
And too much left undone  
I could never deny  
Just how far we had come  
  
Ive got so much love  
So much love  
So much love  
So much love
