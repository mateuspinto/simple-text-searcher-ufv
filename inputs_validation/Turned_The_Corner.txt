I turned a corner  
It didnt seem that was wrong  
I was just having a laugh  
But suddenly my friends are gone  
And I didnt know that life would be so long  
  
I turned the clock  
And went around the block  
Thought I was just having a laugh  
But suddenly my world was gone  
And I found myself standing alone  
  
I thought I was fighting the ebb of life  
I thought I was cutting the web and the strife  
But I look at the mirror where there used to be a smile  
Now I see a stranger
