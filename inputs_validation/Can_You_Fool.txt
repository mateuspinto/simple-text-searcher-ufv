You can take all of the  
Money that you made  
And put it in a jar  
  
Dragged outta my  
Thatll show you  
Is heaven very far  
You can take all of them  
Letters that you need til you  
Find out who you are  
  
And maybe you can figure why  
That woman wanna be so cruel  
But you just cant forget her  
Can you fool  
  
Oh the winter nights and city lights  
And the crying of the train  
Every day the hate of rain  
Every memorys a pain  
  
And you finally used  
The sense God gave you  
To come out of the rain  
  
And still you cant figure why  
That woman wanna be so cruel  
But you just cant forget her  
Can you fool  
  
Love is long and love is hard  
And love brings lots of pain  
For she was here and now shes gone  
Please bring her back again  
  
Now you can take all of  
The money that you made  
And put it in a jar  
Dragged outta my  
Thatll show you  
Is heaven very far  
  
You can take all of that  
Medicine you need til you  
Find out who you are  
  
And maybe you can figure why  
That woman wanna be so cruel  
But you just cant forget her  
Can you fool
