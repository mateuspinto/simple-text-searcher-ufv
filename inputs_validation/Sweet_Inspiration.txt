I need your sweet inspiration  
I need you here on my mind  
Every hour of the day  
Without your sweet inspiration  
The lonely hours of the night  
Just dont go my way  
A woman in love  
Needs sweet inspiration  
Yeah and honey thats all I ask  
Thats all I ask from you  
Ive gotta have your sweet inspiration  
You know there just aint no tellin  
What a satisfied woman might do  
The way you call me baby baby  
Is such a sweet inspiration  
The way you call me darlin darlin  
Sets my heart to skating  
And if Im out in the rain baby  
And in a bad situation  
You know I just reach back in my mind  
And there I find your sweet sweet inspiration  
Sweet inspiration  
Oh what a power  
And Ive got the power  
Every hour of the day  
I need your sweet inspiration  
To go on to go on living  
To keep on giving this way  
I need your sweet inspiration  
Sweet inspiration sweet inspiration sweet inspiration  
Sweet sweet inspiration  
Sweet sweet inspiration  
I need sweet inspiration
