Whyall want to thank whyall for coming out tonight to see me  
Right now put your hands together  
For original original diva original dub plate  
No one can play this but Refugees on the number 1 tour  
Now listen to Miss Whitney Houston come with it  
  
Yo this is Whitney Houston  
Yes massive this is the original vocalist  
Id like to say rest in peace to Dennis Brown  
  
If tomorrow is Judgment Day light is in the air  
And Im standing on the front line aiyyo  
Um and the Lord asks me what I did with my life  
I would say Wyclef murdered a sound boy yo huh  
If I wake up in World War III  
If youo believe in the most high hands in the air  
I see the destruction in poverty  
East coast west coast hey hey  
And I feel like I want to go home South side  
Its okay as long as Wyclef is with me  
North side Jamaican Caribbean Haitian  
Hands in the air everybody hey  
My love is your dubbing my dub is your dub  
It will take eternity to break us  
And the change of our start Listen to me  
As myself is yourself  
Cause the refugee sound is the only sound  
It will take eternity to break us  
And a million sound boys will die before us  
  
This for the hardcore before I had the record deal you kno what Im sayin  
Ima take whyall back when I was walking down the street  
My little girl saying Yo Clef that nigga trying to stick with something  
Walk over to him and said Yo
