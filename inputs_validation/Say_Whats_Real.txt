Why do I feel so alone  
Like everybody passing through the studio  
Is in character as if we acting out a movie role  
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know  
And I dont have the heart to give these  
Bitch ass niggas the cue to go  
So they stick around kicking out feedback  
And I entertain it as if I need that  
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that  
My privacy about the only thing I need back but  
Its hard to think of them polite flows  
Mr Fano Poloto suits are your night clothes  
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes  
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed  
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows  
Life was so full  
Now this shit just being lipod  
Always said Id say it all on the right track  
But in this game you only lose when you fight back  
Black diamond bracelets  
Showing you the basics  
I cant live and hold the camara  
Someone gotta tape this  
I make hits unlike a bitch  
Thats married I aint miss  
24 hours from greatness  
Im that close  
Dont ever forget the moment  
You began to doubt  
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out  
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South  
Watchin whole show  
Embarrassed to pull my camera out  
And my mother embarrassed  
To pull my Phantom out  
So I park about 5 houses down  
She say I shouldnt have it until I have the crown  
But I dont wanna feel the need to wear disguises around  
So she wonder where my mind is accounts in the minus  
But yet Im rolling round the fuckin city like your highness  
Got niggas reactin without a sinus  
Cause what Im working with is timeless  
And promoters try to get me out to they club  
They say I have fun but I cant imagine how  
Cause I just seen my exgirl  
Standing with my next girl  
Standing with the girl that Im fuckin right now  
And shit could get weird unless they all down  
And so I stay clear  
  
We from a small town  
Everybody talks and everybody listen  
But somehow the truth just always comes up missing  
Ive always been something that these labels cant buy  
Especially if they tryin to take a peice of my soul  
And Sylvia be tellin Tez Damn Drake fly  
And he just be like Silly mother fucker I know  
That was your bad  
How could you pass up on em  
He just take them records  
And he gas up on em  
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on em  
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on em  
Oh they did Po  
At least they tried to  
And thats what happens  
When you spitting whats inside you  
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video  
And they think they can market you  
However they decide to nahh  
But Forty told me to do me  
And dont listen to anybody that knew me  
Cause to have known me would  
Mean that theres a new me  
And if you think I changed in the slightest  
Could of fooled me  
Boy in my city Im da 23  
Drug dealers live vicariously through me  
I quit school and its not because Im lazy  
Im just not the social type  
And campus life is crazy understand  
I could get money with my eyes closed  
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo  
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll  
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know  
Cause they need it much more than I ever will  
I got new shit  
Im gettin better still  
Little niggas put my name in they verses  
Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal  
Future said cause this Ye shit you better kill  
And I think this got this Making of a Legend feel  
Problem with these other niggas they  
Aint never real  
Yea thats all I can say
