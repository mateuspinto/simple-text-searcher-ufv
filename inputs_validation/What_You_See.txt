What you see is what you get  
Dont relax youre not home yet  
What you see is what you get  
Dont relax youre not home yet  
Put your life into my hands  
Look around youll understand  
Put your life into my hands  
Its the 80s idiot  
What you see is what you get  
Its the 80s little fool  
Dont forget the golden rule  
What you see is what you get  
What the hell did you expect  
Pretty red roses wet puppy noses  
Men with rubber hoses is more like it  
What you see is not always what you get  
A lesson we must not forget  
One never knows what to expect  
So close your eyes and what you get  
Is what you see and what you get  
Open up your eyes and look around  
Then close them tight and kiss the ground  
You better be thankful youre alive  
And how much longer can you survive  
Underneath the mask theres something brewing  
Underneath the ground theres something moving  
Its the 80s idiot  
What you see is what you get  
Its the 80s little fool  
Dont forget the golden rule  
What you see is what you get  
What the hell did you expect  
Pretty red roses wet puppy noses  
Men with rubber hoses is more like it  
Patrolling the street with all of their friends  
Bashing you around trying to make you like them  
What you see is what you get
