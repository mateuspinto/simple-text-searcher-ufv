Intro  
Mom and Dad went to a show  
Dropped me off at grandpa Joes  
I kicked and screamed  
Said Please dont go  
  
Chorus  
Grandma take me home  
Grandma take me home  
Grandma take me home  
Grandma take me home  
Grandma take me home  
Grandma take me home  
Grandma take me home  
Grandma take me home  
  
Had to eat my dinner there  
Mashed potatoes and stuff like that  
I couldnt chew my meat too good  
  
Chorus  
Grandma take me home  
Grandma take me home  
Grandma take me home  
Grandma take me home  
Grandma take me home  
Grandma take me home  
Grandma take me home  
Grandma take me home  
  
Said Why dont you stop your crying  
Go outside and ride your bike  
Thats what I did  
I killed my toe  
  
Chorus  
Grandma take me home  
Grandma take me home  
Grandma take me home  
Grandma take me home  
Grandma take me home  
Grandma take me home  
Grandma take me home  
Grandma take me home  
  
After dinner I had ice cream  
A bit of sleep and watched TV  
I woke up in my mothers arms  
  
Grandma take me home x19  
  
Wanna be alone
