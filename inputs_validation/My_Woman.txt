Last night as I lay me down in bed  
Over and over I heard the last words my woman said  
Take me with you Im so lonesome  
But I choose to leave instead  
Yesterday she came to me and held my hand  
Said she was blue and oh so lonesome  
And would I try to understand  
I didnt know till this morning  
How much my woman means to me  
This morning when I got home she was not there  
I noticed her clothes were gone  
And a little note lay on my shelf  
Said as you read this I love you still  
But Ill be gone I dont know where  
Today I got the blues and I got em bad  
Last night as I lay sleeping  
My conscious will not go to rest  
Yesterday I lost the best woman I ever had  
One of these days cant say where and I dont know when  
It may be in time it may be soon  
It may be in a place Ive never been  
But Im gonna find that fine woman  
And together with her again
