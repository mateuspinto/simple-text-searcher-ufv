oh look around you  
Tell me what do you see   
Do you see the yellow morning  
And the green land so free    
oh no I see no morning  
But lands of dark and grey  
And they tell me the green land  
Has long gone away  
Has long gone away  
once more look around you  
Tell me what do you see   
Do you see the clear wave laughter  
And the deep blue sea    
oh no there is no sorrow  
Where the laughing tree stood  
And they tell me the blue sea  
Has long turned to blood  
Has long turned to blood  
no more look around you  
Say no more what you see  
But give me your cold hand  
And lay beside me  
And there oh my darling  
You will never worry  
And we like the others  
Will forget in our sleep  
Will forget in our sleep
