Oh yeah yeah  
Girl when we started  
Baby we were friends  
But thats not how this fairytale is gonna end  
See I was thinking  
And it clicked one day  
That no one else has ever made me feel this way  
Next time I saw you  
Girl I knew I had to try  
To tell you everything  
That I was feeling deep inside  
And listen good cause what I say is from my heart  
So if youre ready  
  
Chorus  
You see I toss and turn  
When Im alone  
And I just cant wait till you get home  
Waiting for your call  
Cause tonight were gonna do it all  
Girl its just the two of us  
Cause Im thinking bout you day and night  
And I just cant get you off my mind  
When you get a minute  
Baby I was thinking we could hook up  
Its just the two of us  
The two of us  
Cause in a room full of people  
Youre the only one around  
And nothing in this world  
Could ever bring us down  
Baby Ill be there  
Telling you I care  
This I swear  
Girl its just the two of us  
The two of us  
  
Baby I wonder if you feel the same as I do  
I wonder if youre going  
Through the things Im going through  
I send you flowers on a Saturday  
Insides a letter  
With a message and no name  
See I just love the feeling  
Knowing I can make you smile  
And I havent felt that way  
About someone in quite awhile  
Just listen to these I have to say  
Just take a chance  
  
Chorus  
  
It just gets better with each day  
Baby someday  
I always wanted to tell you  
But I was so afraid  
  
Chorus
