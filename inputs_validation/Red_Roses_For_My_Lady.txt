When Im a million miles away  
Theres so much I want to say  
Oh I wish that you were here babe  
Now I got a feeling coming on  
Ive been away for much too long  
Oh I want to feel you near me  
I wish that you could hear me  
  
Red roses for my lady  
Red roses just to say  
How much I miss my baby  
And Ill be back today  
Red roses for my lady  
Red roses just for you  
  
You know they mean forever and ever  
My love will always be true  
You will be the lady of my heart  
You were the woman from the start  
Such cool sophistication  
  
You are more to me than just my girl  
You are the center of my world  
And if you like the situation  
Heres an open invitation
