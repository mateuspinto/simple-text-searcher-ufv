To give is the reason I live  
To give all I can give  
In return for the life that I earn  
  
I was born as a part of the plan  
With the heart of a man  
With a will to survive  
  
And I believe  
Everything on this earth  
Having meaning and worth  
Made of concrete and air  
Is to share and to feel  
Justify I exist  
To describe on the list  
Of someone  
With a place in the sun  
  
Here I stand reaching out for the sky  
Till the day that I die  
I must give all I can  
When I go  
Ill go out empty hand  
Leaving dust to the land  
Just the soul I have found  
Leaves the ground
