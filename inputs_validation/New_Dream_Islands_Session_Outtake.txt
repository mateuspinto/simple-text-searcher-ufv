And the leaves of autumn will remain unchanged  
Falling though October skies that we brought again  
In time  
  
On winds that hint of winter  
Blowing through your life you will find no shelter  
Or is it answers tonight  
  
Castles made of sand are built against the rain  
And their fragile walls will never claim you  
Hear the distant thunder calling out your name  
Crashing like the waves on New Dream Islands  
  
And you search for comfort in a land so fair  
Reachin for those memories that are always there  
For you  
  
You can wear your sorrow like a veil of tears  
But its just illusion that you hold so dear  
  
Castles made of sand are built against the rain  
And their fragile walls will never save you  
Hear the distant thunder calling out your name  
Crashing like the waves on New Dream Islands  
  
And the leaves of autumn will remain unchanged
