Every little counts  
When I am with you  
I think you are a pig  
You should be in a zoo  
I guess I shouldve known  
Id end up on my own  
Every second counts when I am with you  
  
Every little counts  
When I am with you  
Even though youre stupid  
I still follow you  
The smile upon your face  
It always stays in place  
Every little counts oh when I am with you  
Dodododo  
Every second counts oh when I am with you  
  
Every second counts  
When I am with you  
Even though youre stupid  
I still look at you  
The smile upon your face  
It always stays in place  
Every little counts when I am with you  
Dodododo  
  
Every second counts when I am with you  
Every second counts when I am with you  
Think you are a pig you should be in a zoo
