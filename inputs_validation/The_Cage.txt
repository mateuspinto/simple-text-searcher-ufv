You broke the bread  
We drank the wine  
Your lip was bleedin but it was fine  
Come on inside babe across the line  
I love you more than i  
  
But then this bird just flew away  
She was never meant to stay  
Oh to keep her caged would just delay the spring  
  
You broke your word  
Now thats a lie  
We had a deal that you would try  
Come on inside girl I think its time  
High time we drew the line  
  
But then this bird just flew away  
While I looked the other way  
Oh to keep her caged would just delay the spring  
  
Oh you broke my soul  
Dear you stole the plot  
You left an empty shot  
Theres nothing left here cos you took the lot  
  
An empty cage is all Ive got  
cos when your bird has flown away  
She was never meant to stay  
Oh to keep her caged would just delay the spring  
To keep her caged would just delay the spring
