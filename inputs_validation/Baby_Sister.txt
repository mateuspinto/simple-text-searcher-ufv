Baby sister what a waste to see you in this place  
I lose my mind from worrying over you  
In a bar room filled with people all higher than a steeple  
But I know why you do the things you do  
And I curse the man that made you what you are today  
I hope he dies a thousand times a thousand ways  
Your eyes are filled with tears sis lets get out of here  
Cause I love you baby sister lets go home  
And I curse the man that made you what you are today  
I hope he dies a thousand times a thousand ways  
Your eyes are filled with tears sis lets get out of here  
Cause I love you baby sister lets go home  
Cause I love you baby sister lets go home
