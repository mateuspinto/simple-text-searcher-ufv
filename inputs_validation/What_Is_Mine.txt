Iron winter got me cold  
Convicted like a criminal  
Sharp and nimble the wind unfold  
Got me to my feet again  
Past the mountain I hear a cry  
Coming from the pinnacle  
Oh In the distance a city shines  
Oh what a welcoming  
  
Bridge  
Been to the black rock  
Found my salvation  
Rendered me patient  
But wearing me thin  
So Im  
  
Chorus  
On the way back home  
Seen the big show thousand times  
Got to get back what is mine  
The only way I know  
Feet been walking thousand miles  
Got to get back what is mine  
  
Bless the evening its showed the way  
Back to where it all began  
Oh undercover I made my case  
Im quietly a gentleman  
Man To be a fool is such a waste  
Hell eat until hes sick of it  
Why not stop when you find your place  
And be happy that you made it in  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus  
  
What is mine  
Fallen time  
  
Chorus  
  
On the way back home  
Im on my way  
You know Im on my way back  
The only way I know  
  
Getting what is mine  
Gonna get it back give it back now  
Ive come so far tonight
