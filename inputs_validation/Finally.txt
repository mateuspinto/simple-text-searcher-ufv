Finally we put it to the test  
Dedicate to the true believer in you  
Finally put it to the test  
Finally  
  
Make no mistake to the mainstream  
Music be the master planner  
Just like the books you read  
Youll hear it on your radio scanner  
  
Its not so much what you know  
Or who you know thats coming  
Its what you do regardless  
Its what you do eventually  
  
Finally we put it to the test  
Dedicate to the true believer in you  
Finally put it to the test  
Finally  
  
Ive seen them running down and out  
Never mind the good intentions  
A dreamer with a reason to live  
Is as clear as his next invention  
  
You take a second look to find  
A second chance at giving  
The voices say do not despair  
Theres a real good reason youre living  
  
I could feel the earth moving  
I could see sky falling  
We can chase the storm  
We can sing the rain  
Walk the final distance  
Live this life again  
  
Finally we put it to the test  
Dedicate to the true believer in you  
Finally put it to the test telling me to let go  
  
I can feel the earth moving i can sing the rain  
I can feel the rain coming live this life again  
I can feel the storm  
I can sing the rain  
I can free my heart  
Live this life again  
You can choose to stand  
You can choose to fall  
You can see the rain  
You can have it all  
  
I can feel the rain coming  
I can feel the earth moving  
I can feel the love coming  
  
I can feel the earth moving  
I can feel the rain coming  
I can feel the love coming  
I can feel the earth moving
