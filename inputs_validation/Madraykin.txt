K J Garside  
Let not your hold be so tight  
Shell return in the morning  
If you give her the night  
Madraykin is she suffering  
Is she suffering  
Madraykin is she suffering  
Revealing her birthmark you cast out her eye  
Clipped are the wings of the angels sighs  
Revealing her birthmark you put out her tongue  
Clipped are the wings of the fairies who run  
Madraykin is she suffering  
Is she suffering  
Madraykin is she suffering  
How deep does she weep in your well of unkeep  
The kiss of Madraykin will keep you from sleep  
Keep you from sleep  
Keep you from sleep  
Keep you from sleep  
Keep you from sleep
