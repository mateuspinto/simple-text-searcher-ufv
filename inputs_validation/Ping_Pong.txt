Ping pong  
I use to like  
Ping pong  
Now Im in a ding dong ping pong game of love with you  
Ping pong  
It scares me now  
Ping pong  
My heart is the ball in a ding dong ping pong game with you  
  
I serve it to you  
And you knock it back  
You hit it so hard hard hard  
Its startin to crack  
  
Ping pong  
Youre smashed again  
Ping pong  
And Im losing this ding dong ping pong game of love with you  
  
I serve it to you  
And you knock it back  
You hit it so hard hard hard  
Its starting to crack  
  
Ping pong  
Youre smashed again  
Ping pong  
Im losing this ding dong ping pong game of love with you  
  
Ping pong  
I use to like  
Ping pong  
Now Im in a ding dong ping pong game of love with you  
  
Ping pong  
It scares me now
