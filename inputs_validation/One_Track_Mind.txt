Ah ah  
Ah ah  
Got a one track mind  
  
Somethings happening  
I want everything  
What does the moment bring  
I want it now  
Got a one track mind  
I want it I need it  
Got a one track mind  
I really think so  
  
Ah ah  
I want everything  
And I want it now  
  
Got a one track mind  
  
People say to me  
Mind my Qs and Ps  
Why do they bother me  
Something inside  
Got a one track mind  
Comes over me  
I want it I need it  
Got a one track mind  
I really think so  
  
Ah ah  
Got a  
  
I climb up the stairs  
I sit up and stare  
But nobodys there  
I walk ahead  
Got a one track mind  
You fall behind  
Another victim  
Got a one track mind  
  
Ah ah  
I want everything  
And I want it now
