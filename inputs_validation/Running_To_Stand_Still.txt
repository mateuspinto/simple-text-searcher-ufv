And so she woke up  
Woke up from where she was  
Lying still  
Said I gotta do something  
About where were going  
  
Step on a steam train  
Step out of the driving rain maybe  
Run from the darkness in the night  
Singing ha ah la la la de day  
Ah da da da de day  
Ah la la de day  
  
Sweet the sin  
Bitter the taste in my mouth  
I see seven towers  
But I only see one way out  
  
You got to cry without weeping  
Talk without speaking  
Scream without raising your voice  
  
You know I took the poison  
From the poison stream  
Then I floated out of here  
Singing ha la la la de day  
Ha la la la de day  
Ha la la de day  
  
She runs through the streets  
With eyes painted red  
Under a black belly of cloud in the rain  
In through a doorway she brings me  
White gold and pearls stolen from the sea  
She is raging  
She is raging  
And the storm blows up in her eyes  
She will  
  
Suffer the needle chill  
Shes running to stand  
  
Still
