Jody like a melody  
play inside my head  
till the thought of you is more than I can stand  
just to think of having you is music to my soul  
you make me feel  
as though the world is in my hands  
  
jody like a melody  
you warm me  
and then leave me  
with a chill  
I cant believe the sun will rise  
without me looking in your eyes  
and knowing that your love has made me strong  
why you left Ill never know  
the fire you built will always glow  
I only know I woke to find you gone  
  
jody like a melody  
you warm me  
and then leave me  
with a chill  
jody I cant keep my thoughts  
about me in the daytime  
when your memory is enough to make me blind  
and late at night I lie awake  
and wait for you to come and when you dont  
you know I almost lose my mind  
  
jody like a melody  
you warm me  
and then leave me  
with a chill  
jody like a melody
