Seven islands to the high side of the bay cross the bay  
To the sunset through the blue light of a fiery autumn haze  
We went walking on the high side of the bay on a chilly morn  
And we saw how leaves had fallen on the beds where trees were born  
Any man in his right mind could not fail to be made aware  
Any woman with a gift of wisdom would not seek her answers there  
  
Seven islands to the high side of the bay if youre looking west  
To the sunset you can see it all in fiery autumn dress  
Anytime would be the right time to come up to your bed of boughs  
Anybody with a wish to wander could not fail but to be aroused  
  
Living high in the city guess you think its a pretty good way  
You get to learn but when you get burned you got nothing to say  
You seem to think because you got chicken to go youre in luck  
Fortune will not find you in your mansion or your truck  
Brothers will desert you when youre down and shit out of luck  
  
Look around at the morning guess youre doing the best you can  
Surely you know that when you go nobody gives you a hand  
Think of the air youre breathing in think of the time you waste  
Think of the right and wrong and consider the frown on your face  
  
Its time you tried living on the high side of the bay you need a rest  
Any woman or a man with a wish to fade away could be so blessed  
Fortune will not find you in your mansion turned to gold  
Brothers will desert you when your nights turn long and cold  
  
If you feel it you better believe it youre gonna see it so you really  
know  
It is rising like a feather dipping and dancing from below  
Theres a new wave that is breaking in the wake of a passing ship  
Every nations gonna be shaken put it together dont let it slip  
  
Its time you tried living on the high side of the bay you need a rest  
Any man or a woman with a wish to fade away could be so blessed  
  
Seven islands to the high side of the bay cross the bay  
To the sunset through the blue light of a fiery autumn haze  
To the sunset through the blue light of a fiery autumn haze
