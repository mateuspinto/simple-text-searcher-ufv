Shadows across the floor  
Memories fading in  
Voices are far away  
Now it can all begin  
  
New York are on the phone  
They want you here today  
Was it a fashion show   
Sorry they wouldnt say  
  
Theres a world full of dreams  
Lying on a pillow  
Theres a world noone knows  
Wrapped up in her mind  
Its all imagination  
  
Now she is back in school  
Its the revolution  
Staring at broken glass  
Do what we want you to  
Flicking the flies away  
Total autonomy  
Watching the trains go past  
  
Fighting the Indian war  
Cochise is closing in  
Now she can touch his face   
Riding so close to him  
  
Theres a world full of dreams  
Lying on a pillow  
Theres a world noones seen  
Living in her mind  
  
Sailing across a sea  
Images on a screen  
Watching the boats go by  
Red merging into green  
  
Roxanne dont run away  
Youve been naughty girl  
I told you not to go  
Stay in the garden  
Why do you run away   
Mommy will sorry so
