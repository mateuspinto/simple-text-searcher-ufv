Bring on that pecan pie  
Pour some sugar on it sugar dont be shy  
Scoop me up a mess of that chocolate swirl  
Dont be stingy Im a growing girl  
  
I offer big love with no apology  
How can I deny the world the most of me  
I am not afraid to throw my weight around  
Pound by pound by pound  
  
Because Im big blonde and beautiful  
Face the fact the simply irrefutable  
No one wants a meal that only offers the least  
When girl were serving up the whole damn feast  
  
Slice me off a piece of that hog head cheese  
Then take a look inside my book of recipes  
Now dont you sniff around for something fluffy and light  
We need a man who brings a mansize appetite  
  
Ill use a pinch of sugar and a dash of spice  
Ill let you lick the spoon because it tastes so nice  
Well keep it in a oven til its good and hot  
Keep on stirring til it hits the spot  
  
Because Im big blonde and beautiful  
There is nothing bout us thats unsuitable  
Why sit in the bleachers timid and afraid  
When Edna you look like the whole parade  
  
They say that white has might and thin is in  
Well thats just bull  
Cause ladies big is back and as for black  
Its beautiful  
  
All shapes and sizes follow me  
Who wants a twig when you can climb the whole tree  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Prove it baby prove
