Here a tower shinning bright  
Once stood gleaming in the night  
Where now theres just the rubble  
In the hole here the paddies and the frogs  
Came to gamble on the dogs  
Came to gamble on the dogs not long ago  
  
Oh the torn up ticket stubs  
From a hundred thousand mugs  
Now washed away with dead dreams in the rain  
And the carparks going up  
And theyre pulling down the pubs  
And its just another bloody rainy day  
  
Oh sweet city of my dreams  
Of speed and skill and schemes  
Like Atlantis you just disappeared from view  
And the hare upon the wire  
Has been burnt upon your pyre  
Like the black dog that once raced  
Out from trap two
