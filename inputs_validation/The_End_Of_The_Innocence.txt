Remember when the days were long  
And rolled beneath a deep blue sky  
Didnt have a care in the world  
With mommy and daddy standing by  
  
When happily ever after fails  
And weve been poisoned by these fairy tales  
The lawyers dwell on small details  
Since daddy had to fly  
  
But I know a place where we can go  
Thats still untouched by man  
Well sit and watch the clouds roll by  
And the tall grass wave in the wind  
  
You can lay your head back on the ground  
And let your hair fall all around me  
Offer up your best defense  
But this is the end  
  
This is the end of the innocence  
O beautiful for spacious skies  
But now those skies are threatening  
Theyre beating plowshares into swords  
  
For this tired old man that we elected king  
Armchair warriors often fail  
And weve been poisoned by these fairy tales  
The lawyers clean up all details  
  
Since daddy had to lie  
But I know a place where we can go  
And wash away this sin  
Well sit and watch the clouds roll by  
  
And the tall grass wave in the wind  
Just lay your head back on the ground  
And let your hair spill all around me  
Offer up your best defense  
  
But this is the end  
This is the end of the innocence  
Who knows how long this will last  
Now weve come so far so fast  
  
But somewhere back there in the dust  
That same small town in each of us  
I need to remember this  
So baby give me just one kiss  
  
And let me take a long last look  
Before we say good bye  
Just lay your head back on the ground  
And let your hair fall all around me  
  
Offer up your best defense  
But this is the end  
This is the end of the innocence
