Some say that love is its own  
Love is its own reward  
But I cant help but believe  
Theres got to be more  
A man needs a woman  
To have and to hold  
To love him in body  
As well as in soulI need your desire  
Where did the fire go  
I keep trying to sleep  
But sleep wont be mine tonight  
Theres so much sorrow inside  
And baby I dont know why  
I give you your freedom  
I give you my love  
I give all I have every time that we touch  
I dont know baby  
Maybe I give too much  
Now Im lonely in love  
Why must I be lonely in love  
Im so lonely in love  
Baby why must I be lonely  
Why must I be lonely in love  
I know that love carries no  
She carries no guarantees  
But still I cant seem to  
Find a reason that I can believe in  
You said to be patient  
And give you some room  
You said you had changes  
You need to work through  
But the longer I wait  
The farther I feel from you  
Now Im lonely in love  
Why must I be lonely in love  
Im so lonely in love  
Baby why must I be lonely  
Why must I be lonely in love  
Now Im lonely in love  
Why must I be lonely in love  
Im so lonely in love  
Baby why must I be lonely  
Why must I be lonely in love  
Baby youre my one and only  
Why do you keep me lonely in love
