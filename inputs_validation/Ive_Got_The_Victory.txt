Verse  
  
I thought I lost but actually I won  
For by his blood we all have overcome  
There is no failure our God can never loose  
And that same power it now belongs to You  
  
Chorus  
  
Now it s time to celebrate all banners raised  
Ive got the victory the victory  
Because the devil is defeated and God be praised  
Ive got the victory the victory  
Every situation I face I win  
Ive got the victory the victory  
And everything works for my good in the end  
Ive got the victory the victory  
  
Verse 2  
  
I was on my way to a burning hell  
The devil he had my life set up to fail  
But thanks be to my God who causes me to triumph overcome tread upon the
enemy  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 3  
  
Sombody whos listening right now you think Youre losing  
You feel like you cant win cause You tried everything  
Greater is He that is within You dont doubt  
Cause whatever Youre in now God says  
You have to come out
