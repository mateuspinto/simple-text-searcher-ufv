I saw her dancing dancing  
In some old smokey place  
I bet I was the only one there to watch her face  
  
All night I never saw a smile there  
Cause she didnt even try  
You know for just a little while there  
I saw a tear in her eyes  
  
Come on  
Come on baby I love to see you now  
Ou wi  
One more time baby watch me swinging huh  
  
I sit and watch her on the floor  
I said baby baby baby  
Come on baby just dance some more  
  
I wonder how it is to love her  
I toss it to her in my head  
The way she dance to the music  
She got me going out of my head  
  
Come on  
Watch  
One more time you fine foxy thing you  
Uh yeah   
  
One more time just watch she do  
She do this  
  
Huh  
She walk the mellowman a little bit  
Then she skate a little bit  
Then she boog a little bit  
Then she twist a little bit  
I gotta  
  
One more time  
I got to see her on the floor now now  
Gotta gotta  
I gotta gotta gotta gotta gotta see her now now  
One more time  
Sweet little thing sweet little thing sweet little thing  
You sweet little  
Come on watch that yeah yeah yeah
