You bring hope You bring life  
Awaken hearts open eyes  
With our voices hidden eyes  
We call these dry bones to come alive  
You are faithful you are truth

Blood that covers sin  
Grace that never ends

You have saved us you have won  
Sin is broken death is gone  
Freedoms found us  
Breakthroughs near in Your presence  
No more fear

Hearts are free  
Chains are broken and we believe  
You are mighty you come through  
We can always run to

Arms that never close  
Blood that covers sin  
Grace that never ends
