Golden country your face is so red  
With all of your money your poor can be fed  
You strut around and you flirt with disaster  
Never really carin just what comes after  
Well your blacks are dyin but your back is still turned  
And your freaks are cryin but your back is still turned  
You better stop your hidin or your country will burn  
The time has come for you my friend  
To all this ugliness we must put an end  
Before we leave we must make a stand  
  
Mortgage people you crawl to your homes  
Your security lies in your bed of white foam  
You act concerned but then why turn away  
When a lady was raped on your doorstep today  
Well your blacks are cryin but your back is still turned  
And your freaks are dyin but your back is still turned  
You better stop your hidin or your country will burn  
The time has come for you my friend  
To all this ugliness we must put an end  
Before we leave we must make a stand oh yeah  
  
Golden country your face is so red  
With all of your money your poor can be fed  
You strut around and you flirt with disaster  
Never really carin just what comes after  
Well your blacks are dyin but your back is still turned  
And your freaks are cryin but your back is still turned  
You better stop your hidin or your country will burn  
The time has come for you my friend  
To all this ugliness we must put an end  
Before we leave we must make a stand  
repeat
