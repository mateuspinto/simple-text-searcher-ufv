Its been a hard days night  
And Ive been working like a dog  
Its been a hard days night  
I should be sleeping like a log  
  
But when I get home to you  
I find the things that you do  
Will make me feel all right  
  
You know I work all day  
To get you money to buy you things  
And its worth it just to hear you say  
Youre gonna give me everything  
  
So why on earth should I moan  
Cause when I get you alone  
You know I feel all right  
  
When Im home  
Everything seems to be right  
When Im home  
Feeling you holding me tight tight yeah  
  
Its been a hard days night  
And Ive been working like a dog  
Its been a hard days night  
I should be sleeping like a log  
  
But when I get home to you  
I find the things that you do  
Will make me feel okay oh  
  
So why on earth should I moan  
Cause when I get you alone  
You know I feel all right  
  
When Im home  
Everything seems to be right  
When Im home  
Feeling you holding me tight tight yeah  
  
Its been a hard days night  
And Ive been working like a dog  
Its been a hard days night  
I should be sleeping like a log  
  
But when I get home to you  
I find the things that you do  
Will make me feel all right  
You know I feel all right  
You know I feel all right
