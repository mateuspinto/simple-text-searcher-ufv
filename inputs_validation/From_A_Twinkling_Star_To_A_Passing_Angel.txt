Twinkle Twinkle little star  
How I wonder what you are  
Like a diamond glittring in the sky  
Seems to me you shine your light  
Down to me to say goodnight  
Twinkle Twinkle my old friend  
Sleep is waiting round the bend  
While you travel through the milky way  
From afar  
Twinkle Twinkle Twinkle little star  
  
Raindrops on a window pane  
Stillness of a summer rain  
Silently the haze drifts through the trees  
Slowly dawn is breaking through  
Yet a morning without you  
  
Curtins rustling in the breeze  
Im still trapped within my dreams  
Daylight makes its way into my mind  
Coming through  
Yet another morning without you  
  
Finally when darkness falls  
Casting shadows on the walls  
In the twilight hour I am alone  
Sitting near the fireplace  
Dying embers warm my face  
In this peaceful solitude  
All the outside world subdued  
Everything comes backs to me again  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Mmm Mmm Mmm echoes of a voice I knew  
  
Half awake in half in dreams  
Seeing long forgotten scenes  
So the present runs into the past  
Now and then become entwined  
Playing games within my mind  
Like the embers as they die  
Love was one prolonged goodbye  
And it all comes back to me tonight  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
I close my eyes  
And my twilight images go by  
All too soon  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Long awaited darkness falls  
Casting shadows on the walls  
In the twilight hour I am alone  
Sitting near the fireplace  
Dying embers warms my face  
In this peaceful solitude  
All the outside world subdued  
Everything comes back to me again  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Half awake and half in dreams  
Seeing long forgotten scenes  
So the present runs into the past  
Now and then become entwined  
Playing games within my mind  
Like the embers as they die  
Love was one prolonged goodbye  
And it all comes back to me tonight  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
I close my eyes  
And my twilight images go by  
All too soon  
Like an angel passing through my room
