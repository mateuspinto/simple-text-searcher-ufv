Get out of the way fat man You got something to do  
Go fill up your hands till theyre shining up at you  
You gotta get out while theres gold in the air  
Its falling like water coming down from the hills  
Go West young man  
Earn a dollar a day just like your family said  
Youre rolling your days right on into the night  
The head of the lines going way out of sight  
Go West young man like your family said  
All along the wagons  
All along the dusty trail  
Seventeen years not over a day  
Like children in the wild  
Your mothers milk still wet on your face  
And no one to pray for your safe journey home  
Out beyond the desert  
Across the mountains by the fall  
Servants who leave their masters house  
Are walking all the way  
The golden fields that beckoned you  
Are darkened by the years  
Go West Young Man  
If you knew then what you know today  
Youd be back where you started a happier man  
And leave all the glory to those who have remained  
So Go West Young Man  
Go West Young Man like your family said
