Everybody knew nobody said  
A week ago last Tuesday  
She was just fifteen years  
When she reached her full term  
She went to a grotto  
Just a field  
In The Middle of The Island  
To deliver herself  
  
Her Baby died  
She died  
A week ago last Tuesday  
It was a sad slow stupid death for them both  
Everybody knew nobody said  
At a Grotto  
In a Field  
In The Middle Of The Island
