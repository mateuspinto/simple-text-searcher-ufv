He feeds on fear  
He feeds on hate  
He rules again  
With growing hate  
He will gain their faith again  
Light in the darkness is too small to see  
Theres always a sparkle of hope  
If you just believe  
  
He told the tale so many times  
About the dream not meant to be  
In the world of the free  
He plays with your mind  
As faith for the future faded fast  
He grows strong with their displeasure  
It sets him free  
  
Deceiver of hearts  
Deceiver of fools  
He rules with fear  
Deceiver of hearts  
Deceiver of fools  
He rules again  
  
He feeds on fear  
Poisons the truth  
To gain their faith  
To lead the way  
To a world of decay  
  
He rules your heart  
He will sell your soul to the grave  
Without a hesitation to make  
He belongs to the dark  
  
Please awake  
And see the truth  
He can only be  
If you believe what he tells you  
Remember who you are  
What you stand for  
And there will always be a way  
  
In my heart there is a place  
In my heart there is a trace  
Of a small fire burning  
A sheltering ray shines through this night  
Although its small its bright  
But darkness is lurking  
He will sell your soul to bitterness and cold  
All fear him  
  
Deceiver of hearts  
Deceiver of fools  
He rules with fear  
Deceiver of hearts  
Deceiver of fools  
Shall he rule again
