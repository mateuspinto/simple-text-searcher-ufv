Got the blues like midnight  
Honey wont be long fore day  
Got the blues like midnight  
Honey wont be long fore day  
Wish that tornado would blow my blues away  
Lord I can tell my bulldog  
when I hear him bark  
Lord I can tell my baby  
when I hear her in the dark  
Got the blues like midnight  
Honey wont be long fore day  
Got the blues like midnight  
Honey wont be long fore day  
Lord I wish a tornado would blow my blues away
