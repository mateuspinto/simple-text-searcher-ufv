You bring me roses  
You give me kisses  
You bring me moons and stars  
That shine so high up in the sky  
My heart is beating wild and crazy  
  
Hope that I can find  
A cure for this love  
Could be you want me  
Could be you care  
Could be the words you say  
Are things I just want to hear  
  
You me nervous got me shaking  
Maybe I can find  
A cure for this love  
La la la la  
  
Doctor doctor  
Give me healing so I can stop this feeling  
Its getting so much stronger  
And I just cant go on much longer  
  
Doctor please  
Find me a way out of love  
When the phone rings  
And no one answers  
  
The letters comeback saying  
Lover cannot be found  
Dont go looking dont bother searching  
You see its cause your baby  
Found herself a cure for love  
La la la la
