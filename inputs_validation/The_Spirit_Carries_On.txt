Where did we come from  
Why are we here  
Where do we go when we die  
What lies beyond  
And what lay before  
Is anything certain in life  
  
They say Life is too short  
The here and the now  
And Youre only given one shot  
But could there be more  
Have I lived before  
Or could this be all that weve got  
  
If I die tomorrow  
Id be all right  
Because I believe  
That after were gone  
The spirit carries on  
  
I used to be frightened of dying  
I used to think death was the end  
But that was before  
Im not scared anymore  
I know that my soul will transcend  
  
I may never find all the answers  
I may never understand why  
I may never prove  
What I know to be true  
But I know that I still have to try  
  
If I die tomorrow  
Id be alright  
Because I believe  
That after were gone  
The spirit carries on  
  
Move on be brave  
Dont weep at my grave  
Because I am no longer here  
But please never let  
Your memory of me disappear  
  
Safe in the light that surrounds me  
Free of the fear and the pain  
My questioning mind  
Has helped me to find  
The meaning in my life again  
Victorias real  
I finally feel  
At peace with the girl in my dreams  
And now that Im here  
Its perfectly clear  
I found out what all of this means  
  
If I die tomorrow  
Id be alright  
Because I believe  
That after were gone  
The spirit carries on
