Sometimes it hurts clear to the core  
When we lose all weve cared for  
The hunger and thirst for love that endures is never ending  
  
What will I do with my life  
Try to share it with somebody new  
And how can I learn to disguise that Im lost without you  
  
All I have left is a heart full of mirrors  
A heart full of voices reminding me that its over girl its over  
Ill hear it echo deep inside  
Til the other end of time  
The other end of time  
  
Left over dreams fade in my mind  
And Im counting on this love to die  
cause all that I need is to give my whole life a new beginning  
  
But something is holding me down  
Like Im under a mountain of stone  
And all I can hear is the sound of my own heart breaking  
  
Cause all I have left is a heart full of mirrors  
A heart full of voices reminding me that its over girl its over  
Ill hear it echo deep inside  
Til the other end of time  
Til the other end of time  
  
Cause all I have left is a heart full of mirrors  
A heart full of voices reminding me that its over girl its over  
Ill hear it echo deep inside  
  
All I have left is a heart full of mirrors  
A heart full of voices reminding me that its over girl its over  
Ill hear it echo deep inside  
Til the other end of time  
Til the other end of time
