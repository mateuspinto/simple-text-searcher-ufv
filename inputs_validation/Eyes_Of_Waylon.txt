When it comes to real rounders theres only one  
That was better than I was at havin some fun  
Now its true he shows grey in his beard  
Does that mean hes history or is he a pillar and a peer  
This music called country somethin we all make  
No it didnt just happen cause of the latest rage  
Soon he was the biggest thing to come along in Nashville in those days  
He sang his song called Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way  
I dont know if he did or not but I sure know what I saw  
The 1st triple platinum in that town was hanging on his wall  
Radio will play him until the end of time  
Because hes a real legend not the phony kind  
  
And I looked in the eyes of Waylon  
And there I saw things that Id never seen before  
I saw a father and a brother and a friend  
I saw the nights we spent while out on the road  
Its not the money its not the fame its not the ladies  
And the eyes of Waylon just told me so  
Yes I looked in the eyes of Waylon  
There I learned things that I better know  
And if I doubted there is a hillbilly heaven  
The eyes of Waylon just told me so  
  
And if I doubted there is a hillbilly heaven  
The eyes of old Waylon just told me so
