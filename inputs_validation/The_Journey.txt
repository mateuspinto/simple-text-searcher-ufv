Half the world is sleeping  
half the worlds awake  
half can hear their hearts beat  
half just hear them break  
  
I am but a traveler in most every way  
Ask me what you want to know  
  
What a journey it has been  
And the end is not in sight  
But the stars are out tonight  
and theyre bound to guide my way  
  
When theyre shining on my life  
I can see a better day  
I wont let the darkness in  
what a journey it has been  
  
I have been to sorrow  
I have been to bliss  
Where Ill be tomorrow  
I can only guess  
  
Through the darkest desert  
Through the deepest snow  
Forward always forward I go  
  
What a journey it has been  
and the end is not in sight  
But the stars are out tonight  
and theyre bound to guide my way  
  
When theyre shining on my life  
I can see a better day  
I wont let the darkness in  
what a journey it has been  
  
Forward always forward  
Onward always up  
Catching every drop of hope  
In my empty cup  
  
What a journey it has been  
And the end is not in sight  
But the stars are out tonight  
and theyre bound to guide my way  
  
When theyre shining on my life  
I can see a better day  
I wont let the darkness in  
what a journey it has been  
  
What a journey it has been
