Last thing I remember  
Is the freezing cold water  
Reaching up just to swallow me whole  
Ice in the rigging and howling wind  
  
Shock to my body  
As we tumbled in mercy from God  
My brothers and the others  
Are lost at sea  
  
I alone am returned to tell thee  
Hidden in ice for a century to walk  
The world again Lord have mercy  
On the frozen man  
  
Next words that were spoken to me  
Nurse asked me what my name might be  
She was all in white  
At the foot of my bed  
  
I said angel of mercy  
Im alive or am I dead  
My name is William James McPhee  
I was born in 1843  
  
Raised in Liverpool by the sea  
But that aint who I am  
Lord have mercy  
On the frozen man  
  
It took a lot of money  
To start my heart  
To peg my leg and to buy my eye  
The newspapers call me  
  
The state of the art  
And the children  
When they see me cry  
I thought it would be nice  
  
Just to visit my grave  
See what kind of tombstone I might have  
I saw my wife and my daughter  
And it seemed so strange  
  
Both of them dead and gone  
From extreme old age  
See here when I die  
Make sure Im gone  
  
Dont leave em nothing to work on  
You can raise your arm  
You can wiggle your hand  
Not unlike myself  
  
And you can wave goodbye  
To the frozen man  
  
I know what it means  
To freeze to death  
To lose a little life  
With every breath  
  
To say goodbye to  
Life on earth  
And come around again  
Lord have mercy  
  
On the frozen man  
Lord have mercy  
On the frozen man
