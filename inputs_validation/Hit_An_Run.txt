Ive never had a home sweet home life  
An I dont want a nine to five  
So many women I know  
Think they can tie me down  
But I will never let them take me alive  
I hit an run hit an run hit an run hit an run hit an run  
  
Now some women say they dont want nothing  
But a sweet talkin bull of a man  
Ive heard it before I cant hear it no more  
cause they all take whatever they can  
  
But still I want a heartbreaker  
A love maker a soul shaker  
A women who can turn me on  
For a just little hit an run hit an run  
  
She can be a love stealer  
A double dealer a free wheeler  
As long as she can turn me on  
For just a little hit an run  
A little bit of hit an run  
  
You can keep your lock and key  
No ball and chain can harness me  
Take me home tonight  
Love and treat me right  
But in the morning youll find me gone  
I hit an run  
  
Hit an run
