Precious cups within the flower  
Deadly petals with strange power  
Faces shine a deadly smile  
Back up on you at your trial  
Chill and numbs from head to toe  
Icy sun with frosty glow  
Whyd you go reaching your sorrow  
Whyd you go read no tomorrow  
Feel your spirit rise with the priest  
Feel your body falling to its knees  
Take your walk of remorse  
Take your body to a corpse  
Take your body to a corpse  
Take your body to a corpse  
If you want all remorse  
Take your body to a corpse  
Now from darkness there springs light  
Wall of Sleep is cold and bright  
Wall of Sleep is lying broken  
Sun shines in you are awoken
