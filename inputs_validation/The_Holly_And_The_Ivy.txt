The holly and the ivy  
When they are both full grown  
Of all the trees that are in the wood  
The holly wears the crown  
  
Chorus  
O the rising of the sun  
The running of the deer  
The playing of the merry organ  
Sweet singing in the choir  
Sweet singing in the choir  
The holly bears a blossom  
  
As white as lily flower  
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ  
To be our sweet Savior  
  
Chorus  
  
The holly bears a berry  
As red as any blood  
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ  
To do poor sinners good  
  
Chorus  
  
The holly bears a prickle  
As sharp as any thorn  
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ  
On Christmas day in the morn  
  
Chorus  
  
The holly bears a bark  
As bitter as any gall  
And Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ  
For to redeem us all  
  
Chorus  
  
The holly and the ivy  
When they are both full grown  
Of all the trees that are in the wood  
The holly wears the crown  
  
Chorus
