I know I cannot leave this place for the memories  
Things like they way they knew us all over town  
We used to walk the streets together  
We could be seen  
  
Past shops where people knew us  
Yeah people knew  
Ive got to choose between tomorrow and yesterday  
Cant stop to think about my life here today  
  
Memories can hang you up and haunt you  
All your life you know  
Get so you cannot stay  
And yet cannot go  
  
Hey I could find out where youve gone today  
I feel so unhappy  
Streets seem so empty now  
I want you I want you with me  
  
Maybe Ill find someone to get you  
Off my mind  
Take me away from here and leave it leave it all behind  
Oh Memories can hang you up and haunt you  
  
All your life you know  
Get so you cannot stay and yet cannot go
