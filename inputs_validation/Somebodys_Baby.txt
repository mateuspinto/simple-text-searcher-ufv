He used to be somebodys baby  
Someone used to hold him close and rock him gently  
He used to be the light in someones eyes  
He used to matter he used to matter  
Someone cared if he lived or died  
Someone held him in their arms  when he cried  
And when he hurt someone kept the world away  
Someone loved him someone loved him  
  
He used to be somebodys baby  
Someone used to hold him close and rock him gently  
He used to be the light in someones eyes  
He used to matter he used to matter  
He used to matter  
  
That was then that was so long ago  
Long before they came and took his soul  
Long before he became invisible  
That was when he wasnt human garbage then  
  
He used to be somebodys baby  
Someone used to hold him close and rock him gently  
He used to be the light in someones eyes  
He used to matter he used to matter  
He used to matter  
He used to be somebodys baby
