The night surrounds me  
I cant turn back the hands of time  
When I look around me  
My thoughts are of the lonely kind  
Such a game of high stakes  
We gambled and then we lost  
We were fools to believe  
That we could beat the odds  
  
But the story always ends the same  
you cant turn back the page  
Trying to relive evry moment as it came  
you cant turn back the page  
But it always ends the same  
You cant turn back the page  
  
The night surrounds me  
I try and get you off my mind  
But still Still it hounds me  
If I could see you one more time  
In a moment of madness  
We gambled and the we lost  
Now we live in the shadows  
And pay the cost  
  
And the story always ends the same  
you cant turn back the page  
Trying to relive evry moment as it came  
you cant turn back the page  
But it always ends the same  
You cant turn back the page  
  
The judgements been set  
The jury retired  
The courts now in recess  
The pleas been denied  
  
And the story always ends the same  
you cant turn back the page  
Trying to relive evry moment as it came  
you cant turn back the page  
But it always ends the same  
You cant turn back the page
