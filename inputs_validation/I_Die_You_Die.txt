This is not love  
This is not even worth a point of view  
In Echo Park I  
Pause for effect  
And whisper Who are you  
  
They crawl out of their holes for me  
And I die  You die  
Hear them laugh  
And watch them turn on me  
And I die  You die  
See my scars  
They call me such things  
Tear me tear me tear me  
  
But I have your names  
Screaming You will suffer  
And Youre all too late  
Now I feel young  
Does everything stop when the old tape fails  
  
They crawl out of their holes for me  
And I die you die  
Hear them laugh  
And watch them turn on me  
And I die you die  
See my scars  
They call me such things  
Tear me tear me tear me  
  
But Im still frightened by the telephone
