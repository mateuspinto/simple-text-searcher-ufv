There aint nothin in the world that I like better  
Than bacon n lettuce n home grown tomatoes  
Up in the morning out in the garden  
Get you a ripe one dont get a hard un  
  
Plant em in the spring eat em in the summer  
All winter without em is a culinary bummer  
I forget all about the sweatin and the diggin  
Every time I go out and pick me a big un  
  
Home grown tomatoes home grown tomatoes  
Whatd life be without home grown tomatoes  
Only two things that money cant buy  
Thats true love and home grown tomatoes  
  
You can go out and eat an thats for sure  
But theres nothin a home grown tomato wont cure  
Put em in a salad put em in a stew  
You can make your own very own tomato juice  
  
You can eat em with eggs eat em with gravy  
You can eat em with beans pinto or navy  
Put em on the side put em in the middle  
Home grown tomato on a hot cake griddle  
  
Home grown tomatoes home grown tomatoes  
Whatd life be without home grown tomatoes  
Only two things that money cant buy  
Thats true love and home grown tomatoes  
  
If Is to change this life I lead  
You could call me Johnny Tomato seed  
Cause I know what this country needs  
Home grown tomatoes in every yard you see  
  
When I die dont bury me  
In a box in a cold dark cemetery  
Out in the garden would be much better  
Cause I could be pushin up a home grown tomatoes  
  
Home grown tomatoes home grown tomatoes  
Whatd life be without home grown tomatoes  
Only two things that money cant buy  
Thats true love and home grown tomatoes
