As each day passes by  
I feel my love run dry  
I get so weary worn  
And tossed around in the storm  
Well Im blind to others needs  
And Im tired of planting seeds  
I seem to have a wealth  
Of so many thoughts about myself  
  
I want to I need to be more like Jesus  
I want to I need to be more like him  
  
Our fathers will was done  
By giving us his son  
Who paid the highest cost  
To point us to the cross  
And when I think of him  
Taking on the whole worlds sin  
I take one look at me  
Compared to what Im called to be  
  
I want to I need to be more like Jesus  
I want to I need to be more like him  
  
Remember theres no greater love  
Then to lay down your life for a friend  
The end of all my prayers  
Is to care like my lord cares  
My one and only goal  
His image in my soul  
Yes my weakness is revealed  
When by his stripes Im healed  
Hes faithful and hes true  
To complete the work he begins in you
