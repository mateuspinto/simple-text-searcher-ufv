I am a lineman for the county  
And I drive the main road  
Searchin in the sun for another overload  
I hear you singin in the wire  
I can hear you through the whine  
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line  
  
I know I need a small vacation  
But it dont look like rain  
And if it snows that stretch down south wont ever stand the strain  
And I need you more than want you  
And I want you for all time  
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line  
  
And I need you more than want you  
And I want you for all time  
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line
