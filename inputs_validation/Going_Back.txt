No picnic no barbecue out in the back  
A yard for parked cars left to rot and forget  
For chainedup mad dogs for garbage to sit  
Get lost get lost a part from it  
  
Chorus  
I cant see through it  
But i can see past  
With me with me always  
Without going back  
  
Just people and buildings  
Not city or town  
Great lake crooked river  
Flat land water burns  
The air not smoke  
It tears the eye  
Home is where you live  
Home is where youll die  
  
Chorus  
  
In a glacial slide  
Over ice mirrored glass  
In a slip and past times  
Are in the future brought back  
Reflected reflected reflected  
Every footstep  
  
No walk in the park  
No there is nowhere  
No place can replace  
What a clear eye reveals  
Soft and hard shaped like a wheel  
Made me of rubber made me of steel  
  
Chorus
