Here is babys storybook  
Palms together like in prayer  
  
Opening up wide  
Open the book palms facing upward  
With pinkies touching each other  
  
Here are birdies flying high  
Thumbs together use other fingers  
To flap like wings  
  
That youll find inside  
  
  
Heres a little windmill  
Whirling round and round  
Pointer fingers facing each other  
Spin them around in circles  
  
And here is babys rattle  
Hand in fist as if holding a rattle  
  
Such a noisy sound Chh chh chh  
Pretend to shake rattle while making chh sound  
  
  
Here is babys cradle  
Fingers intertwined with pointer  
Fingers up  like church steeple  
  
Soft and warm and white  
  
This is how the baby  
Goes to sleep at night  
Cup hands together at shoulder  
Resting head on hands eyes closed  
  
  
Heres the big round sun  
Make big circle with arms over head  
  
That wakes the baby up  
  
And this is how she takes a drink  
From her little cup  
Hand fisted as if holding a cup  
Bring cup to mouth to drink
