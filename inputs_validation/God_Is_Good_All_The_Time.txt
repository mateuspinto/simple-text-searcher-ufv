Chorus  
God is good all the time  
He put a song of praise in this heart of mine  
God is good all the time  
Through the darkest night His light will shine  
God is good God is good all the time  
  
If youre walking through the valley  
And there are shadows all around  
Do not fear He will guide you  
He will keep you safe and sound  
Cause Hes promised to never leave you  
Nor forsake you and His Word is true  
  
Chorus  
God is good all the time  
He put a song of praise in this heart of mine  
God is good all the time  
Through the darkest night His light will shine  
God is good God is good all the time  
  
We were sinners and so unworthy  
Still for us He chose to die  
Filled us with His Holy Spirit  
Now we can stand and testify  
That His love is everlasting  
And His mercies  they will never end  
  
Chorus  
God is good all the time  
He put a song of praise in this heart of mine  
God is good all the time  
Through the darkest night His light will shine  
God is good God is good all the time  
  
Though I may not understand  
All the plans He left for me  
My life is in Your hands  
And through the eyes of faith I can clearly see  
  
Chorus  
God is good all the time  
He put a song of praise in this heart of mine  
God is good all the time  
Through the darkest night His light will shine  
God is good God is good all the time
