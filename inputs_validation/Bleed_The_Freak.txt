My cup runneth over  
Like blood from a stone  
These stand for me  
Name your god and bleed the freak  
I like to see  
How you all would bleed for me  
  
When the pig runs slower  
Let the arrow fly  
When the sin lies bolder  
Ill pluck out thine eye  
These stand for me  
Name your god and bleed the freak  
I like to see  
How you all would bleed for me  
  
If you scorn my lover  
Satan got your thigh  
If you steal in hunger  
I will kick you when you try  
These stand for me  
Name your god and bleed the freak  
I like to see  
How you all would bleed for me  
all these things that youve done for me  
Have left me so  
Fucking tired  
  
Im not saying that you havent done a lot of good  
But if theres one thing you can do  
You can bleed for me bleed for me  
  
These stand for me  
Name your god and bleed the freak  
I like to see  
How you all would bleed for me  
These stand for me  
Name your god and bleed the freak  
I like to see  
How you all would bleed for me
