And the men who hold high places  
Must be the ones to start  
To mold a new reality  
Closer to the heart  
Closer to the heart  
  
The blacksmith and the artist  
Reflect it in their art  
They forge their creativity  
Closer to the heart  
Closer to the heart  
  
Philosophers and plow men  
Each must know his part  
To sow a new mentality  
Closer to the heart  
Closer to the heart  
  
You can be the captain  
I will draw the chart  
Sailing into destiny  
Closer to the heart
