When youve prayed every prayer that you know how to pray  
Just remember the Lord will hear and the answer is on its way  
  
Our God is able  
He is mighty  
He is faithful  
  
And He never sleeps He never slumbers  
He never tires of hearing our prayer  
When we are weak He becomes stronger  
So rest in His love and cast all of your cares on Him  
  
Do you feel that the Lord has forgotten your need  
Just remember that God is always working in ways you cannot see  
  
Our God is able  
He is mighty  
He is faithful
