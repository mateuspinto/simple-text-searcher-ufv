Ill never smile again  
Until I smile at you  
Ill never laugh again  
What good would it do  
For tears would fill my eyes  
My heart would realize  
That our romance is true  
Ill never love again  
Im so in love with you  
Ill never thrill again  
  
To somebody new  
Within my heart  
I know I will never start  
To smile again  
Until I smile at you  
Within my heart  
I know I will never start  
To smile again  
Until I smile at you
