Chorus  
Charlie dont surf and we think he should  
Charlie dont surf and you know that it aint no good  
Charlie dont surf for his hamburger Momma  
Charlies gonna be a napalm star  
  
Everybody wants to rule the world  
Must be something we get from birth  
One truth is we never learn  
Satellites will make space burn  
  
Weve been told to keep the strangers out  
We dont like them starting to hang around  
We dont like them all over town  
Across the world we are going to blow them down  
  
Chorus  
  
The reign of the super powers must be over  
So many armies cant free the earth  
Soon the rock will roll over  
Africa is choking on their Coca Cola  
  
Its a one a way street in a one horse town  
One way people starting to brag around  
You can laugh put them down  
These one way people gonna blow us down  
  
Chorus  
  
Charlie dont surf hell never learn  
Charlie dont surf though hes got a gun  
Charlie dont surf think that he should  
Charlie dont surf we really think he should  
Charlie dont surf  
  
Charlie dont surf and we think he should  
Charlie dont surf and you know that it aint no good  
Charlie dont surf for his hamburger Momma  
Charlie dont surf
