Shout  
Standing in the doorway  
Beneath the moonlit sky  
An angel stood before me  
And looked me in the eye  
Aye aye  
  
Aye aye aye  
Aye aye aye  
Aye aye aye  
  
She moved up right beside me  
And we began to dance  
The groove was all around us  
The slipped into a trance  
Aye aye  
  
Aye aye aye  
Aye aye aye  
Aye aye aye  
  
Dancing to the rhythm  
Moving to the beat  
Everybodys singing  
You could feel the heat  
Aye aye
