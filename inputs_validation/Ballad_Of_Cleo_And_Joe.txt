Every day the clock kicks off the beat  
Little Joe struggles just to get up on his feet  
Waits in his platforms for the right train to come  
Sipping his coffee another day has begun  
Little Joe got work for minimum wage  
Tries to get through another dead beat day  
At five oclock he comes home to change  
Takes him many hours just to rearrange  
And he works his body just to be somebody  
Theres a woman in the mirror looking like a dream  
And he works his body  
And he feels somebody  
And the working boy becomes a dancing queen  
Every night the dj kicks off the beat  
Little Cleos jumping just to get up on her feet  
Waits in her platforms for the right song to come  
Sipping her cocktail another night has begun  
And he works his body just to be somebody  
Theres a woman in the mirror looking like a dream  
And he works his body  
And he feels somebody  
And the working boy becomes a dancing queen  
Every morning the clock kicks off the beat  
Little Joe struggles just to get up on his feet  
Waits in his platforms for the right train to come
