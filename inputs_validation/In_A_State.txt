My mind is in a state  
Cause all I seem to do is tempt my fate  
Well I try every space  
But all the while were crushing at the gate  
This time this time  
  
Reality struck me between the eyes  
My mind is in a state  
Cause everything I miss it comes too late  
So I try and disappear  
But there is only one way out of here  
This time this time  
  
Reality struck me between the eyes  
My mind is in a state  
But all I need to do is change my pace  
And I know theres fear to face  
But happiness is firm in its embrace  
This time
