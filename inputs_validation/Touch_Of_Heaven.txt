Your eyes burn through me  
Oh like a raging fire  
I fall blissfully  
Every time you say just one little word  
You know it makes me crazy  
You ask way too much  
Oh when you say that I can look but do not touch  
I have never wanted any other girl  
The way I want you baby  
I surrender to what I cant control  
Drunk with desire Ive opened up my soul  
  
Chorus  
You know I would go around the world  
Id take you anywhere  
Oh baby anywhere  
For a touch of heaven  
Tell me what you want Ill give you anything  
Oh baby everything  
For a touch of heaven  
  
I have dreamed of this  
Your body next to mine  
Drowning in every kiss  
How Ive longed to find my one and only girl  
And I found her in you baby  
All I ever wanted is everything that you are  
Dont leave me longing  
Be tender with my heart  
  
Chorus  
  
Everyone says youve been leading me on  
Too late for warnings I m already gone  
Ooh I surrender to what I cant control  
Drunk with desire  
Im giving you my soul  
  
Chorus
