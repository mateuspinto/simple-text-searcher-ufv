I need someone a person to talk to  
Someone whod care to love  
Could it be you could it be you  
Situation gets rough then I start to panic  
  
Its not enough its just a habit  
Hey kid your sick well darling this is it  
You can all just kiss off into the air  
Behind my back I can see them stare  
  
Theyll hurt me bad but I wont mind  
Theyll hurt me bad they do it all the time  
Yeah yeah they do it all the time  
I hope you know this will go down  
  
On your permanent record  
Oh yeah well dont get so distressed  
Did I happen to mention that Im impressed  
  
I take one one one cause you left me and  
Two two two for my family and  
Three three three for my heartache and  
Four four four for my headaches and  
Five five five for my lonely and  
Six six six for my sorrow and  
Seven seven for no tomorrow and  
Eight eight I forget what eight was for and  
Nine nine nine for a lost god and  
Ten ten ten ten for everything  
  
Everything everything everything
