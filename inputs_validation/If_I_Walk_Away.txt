Lately Ive been the quiet one  
Waiting searching the lines of the songs you played for me  
Sailing into the misty air  
Fading bound for I dont know where  
When Im there Ill see  
  
And If I walk away  
Please follow me  
If I walk away  
Please follow me  
  
Weightless drifting through stars I got  
Faithless woke in the dark and I made this from my dream  
Play me all your sweet rhymes  
Recreate me now comes the time when Ill need your truth to see  
  
And if I walk away  
Please follow me  
If I walk away  
Please follow me  
  
Walk away  
Let the fear fall away  
Into the fire you made  
Scarlet and gold  
Walk away  
Head for the light of day  
Follow a brighter way  
Out of the cold and dark  
Down to the one bright spark  
Futures that all might start  
Someday  
  
So if I walk away  
Please follow me  
If I walk away  
Please follow me  
  
Fragments shells of a long ago lifetime  
Faces that once were mine  
Thrown down by the sea  
  
If I walk away  
Please follow me  
If I walk away  
Would you please follow me
