Ghost of yesterday  
Stalking round my room  
All night long you stay  
Walk around profound gloom  
When the darkness falls  
When Ive gone to bed  
Weirdly come your calls  
Mournfully scornfully dead  
  
Folly of a love I strangled  
Pulsing heart I thought was gone  
Gives no peace  
Will not cease  
Prowling round till dawn  
Ghost of yesterday  
Every night youre here  
Whispering away  
Might have been might have been oh my dear  
Foolish heart must pay  
Ghost of yesterday  
Yesterday
