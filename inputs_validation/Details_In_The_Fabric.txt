Calm down  
Deep breaths  
And get yourself dressed instead  
Of running around  
And pulling all your threads saying  
Breaking yourself up  
  
If its a broken part replace it  
But if its a broken arm then brace it  
If its a broken heart then face it  
  
And hold your own  
Know your name  
And go your own way  
  
And hold your own  
Know your name  
And go your own way  
  
And everything will be fine  
Everything will be fine  
Hmm  
  
Hang on  
Help is on the way  
Stay strong  
Im doing everything  
  
And hold your own  
Know your name  
And go your own way  
  
And hold your own  
Know your name  
And go your own way  
  
And everything everything will be fine  
Everything  
  
Are the details in the fabric  
Are the things that make you panic  
Are your thoughts results of static cling  
  
Are the things that make you blow  
Hell no reason go on and scream  
If youre shocked its just the fault  
Of faulty manufacturing  
  
Yeah everything will be fine  
Everything in no time at all  
Everything  
  
Chorus  
  
Are the details in the fabric Hold your own know your name  
Are the things that make you panic  
Are your thoughts results of static cling Go your own way  
  
Are the details in the fabric Hold your own know your name  
Are the things that make you panic Go your own way  
Is it Mother Natures sewing machine  
  
Are the things that make you blow Hold your own know your name  
Hell no reason go on and scream  
If youre shocked its just the fault Go your own way  
Of faulty manufacturing  
  
Everything will be fine  
Everything in no time at all  
Hearts will hold
