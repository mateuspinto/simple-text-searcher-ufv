It hurts to say goodbye  
And when the words are going by  
The wind can blow them right back in your eye  
You can almost see it  
  
Time will let you know  
And when you turn around to go  
The aching in your heart begins to show  
You can almost see it  
  
You can almost see it  
You can almost see it  
You can almost see it going by  
  
So you take another train  
But the tracks all look the same  
They run around in circles like a game  
You can almost see it  
  
I can almost see it  
I can almost see it  
I can almost see it going by
