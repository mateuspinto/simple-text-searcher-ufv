Many are the words we speak  
Many are the songs we sing  
Many kinds of offerings  
But now to live the life  
  
Many are the words we speak  
Many are the songs we sing  
Many kinds of offerings  
But now to live the life  
  
Help us live the life  
Help us live the life  
All we want to do is bring you something real  
Bring You something true  
  
We hope that Precious are the words we speak  
We pray that Precious are the songs we sing  
Precious all these offerings  
But now to live the life  
  
Help us live the life  
Help us live the life  
All we want to do is bring you something real  
Bring You something true  
  
Help us live the life  
Help us live the life  
All we want to do is bring you something real  
Bring You something true  
  
Now to go the extra mile  
Now to turn the other cheek  
And to serve You with a life  
Let us share your fellowship  
Even of your sufferings  
Never let the passion die  
Now to live the life  
Now to live the life  
Now to live the life  
Now to live the life
