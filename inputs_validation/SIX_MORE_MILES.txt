Oh the rain is slowly fallin  
And my heart is so sore  
Six more miles and leave my darling  
Never on this earth to meet no more  
Six more miles to the graveyard  
Six more miles long and sad  
Six more miles and leave my darling  
Leave the best friend I ever had  
Oh I hear the train acomin  
Bringin my darlin back home  
Six more miles to the graveyard  
And Ill be left here all alone  
Six more miles to the graveyard  
Six more miles long and sad  
Six more miles and leave my darling  
Leave the best friend I ever had  
Six more miles to the graveyard  
Six more miles long and sad  
Six more miles and leave my darling  
Leave the best friend I ever had
