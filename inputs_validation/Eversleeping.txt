Once I traveled seven seas to find my love  
And once I sang seven hundred songs  
Well maybe I still have to walk seven thousand miles  
Until I find the one that I belong  
I will rest my head side by side  
To the one that stays in the night  
I will lose my breath in my last words of sorrow  
And whatever comes will come soon  
Dying I will pray to the moon  
That there once will be a better tomorrow  
Once I crossed seven rivers to find my love  
And once for seven years I forgot my name  
Well if I have to I will die seven deaths just to lie  
In the arms of my eversleeping aim  
I will rest my head side by side  
To the one that stays in the night  
I will lose my breath in my last words of sorrow  
And whatever comes will come soon  
Dying I will pray to the moon  
That there once will be a better tomorrow  
I will rest my head side by side  
To the one that stays in the night  
I will lose my breath in my last words of sorrow  
And whatever comes will come soon  
Dying I will pray to the moon  
That there once will be a better tomorrow  
I dreamt last night that he came to me  
He said My love why do you cry  
For now it wont be long any more  
Until in my cold grave we will lie  
Until in my cold grave we will lie
