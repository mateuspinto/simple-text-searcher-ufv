Alright listen Im back again cause thats what you required of  
Me steady rhyming and Im so sick and tired of  
Being forced to put suckers in their place  
You make me mad enough to punch you in the face  
But Im not trying so never sound like I dont bone to pick with you  
Show and prove that you can stand on your own two  
I speak the poetry dissing those who keep on quoting me  
Try to play me cease it you dont know me  
So smile in my face behind my back take a line or two  
Im not an idiot so who you think you lying to  
Queen Latifahs here to lay the law down  
So speed it up or shake it around because its a showdown  
The 45 King is arising surprising hypnotising star hes up to par  
So I hope youve prepared yourself for what youre in for  
This is Latifahs Law  
BMWs and gold rope chains dont impress me  
Or get you closer to the point you can undress me  
Get skeezed you nose will bleed thats how they live life  
Prepare to feel the wrath of the giver of all life  
Fire and desire make you go a little higher  
When I grab the wire of the mic  
And get hype Im sorry you sound dot  
Cause I roll like the homicide squad  
You must be broke and hoping that Im soft but Im dope and  
Left you in the litter to consider coping with  
Life its trife yeah but these things happen  
You need to make it better stop trying to be the mack again  
Get a grip on the African way  
Cause theres a sucker born every day  
Crimes the way for you to see what the Queen saw  
And this is Latifahs law  
Now DJ Mark made up a beat that he can bring you  
And I of course supply the rhyme that you can swing to  
The Flavor Unit keeps all and keeps a way to band  
And slides keep the hardcore fall cause Im heavyhanded  
Whip out a 45 caliber pen and begin  
A funky message from beginning to end  
Peace be to Africa cant forget my other land  
Wont fulfill my heart unless I speak about the motherland  
You say youre living right but we know its nonsense  
In case you forgot just check your conscience  
At showtime I blow lines you dont get yours I get mine  
Your showtimes you behind the Queen Latifah divine  
Rule number one dont step across the line that I drew  
Number two dont take credit for something that you didnt do  
Number three check your heart every man has a call  
Its time for me to go but Ill be back yall
