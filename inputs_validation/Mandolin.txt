Oh mandolin oh mandolin  
Waiting in the dark  
All centuries passed down upon  
Your smooth Venetian skin  
Memories oh memories  
Lay stains upon your heart  
When lovers dance into the trance  
You weaved by candlelight  
Oh I saw a sunrise like never before  
As mandolin played I cried for more  
Oh mandolin oh mandolin  
Waiting in the dark  
Well centuries passed down upon  
Your smooth Venetian skin  
Incessant sound incessant sound  
That stirs the young and pure  
Incestuous I kiss my hand  
And play the calling drum  
The lover cried into the silk  
Many years ago  
Your voice laid comfort down upon  
His European skin  
Oh I saw a sunrise like never before  
As mandolin played I cried for more  
Oh I saw a sunrise like never before  
As mandolin played I cried for more  
Oh I saw a sunrise like never before  
As mandolin played oh I cried for more  
Mandolin oh mandolin  
Waiting in the dark  
Oh centuries passed down upon  
Your smooth Venetian skin
