Fleetwood Mac cover  
taken from Live 1995  
I took my love and I took it down  
I Climbed a mountain and I turned around  
And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills  
Till the landslide brought me down  
Oh mirror in the sky  
What is love  
Can the child within my heart rise above  
Can I sail thru the changing ocean tides  
Can I handle the seasons of my life  
Uhuh I dont know  
Uhuh  
Well Ive been afraid of changing  
Cause Ive built my life around you  
But time makes you bolder  
Children get older  
Im getting older too  
S0o0o0  
Gutiar solo  
Ive been afraid of changing  
Cause I built my life around you  
But time makes you bolder  
Children get older  
Im getting older too  
Im getting older too  
Oh take this love take it down  
Oh If you Climb a mountain and turn around  
If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills  
Well the landslide will bring it down down  
And If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills  
Well maybe the landslide will bring it down  
Well well the landslide will bring it down
