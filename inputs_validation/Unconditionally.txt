Oh no did I get too close oh  
Oh did I almost see whats really on the inside  
All your insecurities  
All the dirty laundry  
Never made me blink one time  
  
Unconditional unconditionally  
I will love you unconditionally  
There is no fear now  
Let go and just be free  
I will love you unconditionally  
  
Come just as you are to me  
Dont need apologies  
Know that you are worthy  
Ill take your bad days with your good  
Walk through this storm I would  
Id do it all because I love you I love you  
  
Unconditional unconditionally  
I will love you unconditionally  
There is no fear now  
Let go and just be free  
I will love you unconditionally  
  
So open up your heart and just let it begin  
Open up your heart and just let it begin  
Open up your heart and just let it begin  
Open up your heart  
Acceptance is the key to be  
To be truly free  
Will you do the same for me  
  
Unconditional unconditionally  
I will love you unconditionally  
And there is no fear now  
Let go and just be free  
Cause I will love you unconditionally oh yeah  
  
I will love you  
I will love you  
I will love you unconditionally
