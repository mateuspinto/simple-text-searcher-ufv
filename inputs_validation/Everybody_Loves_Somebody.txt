Everybody loves somebody sometime  
Everybody falls in love somehow  
Something in your kiss just told me  
That my sometime is now  
  
Everybody finds somebody someplace  
Theres no telling where love may appear  
Something in my heart keeps saying  
That my someplace is here  
  
If I had it in my power  
Id arrange for every girl to have your charm  
Then every minute every hour  
Every boy would find what Ive found in your arms  
  
Everybody loves somebody sometime  
And although my dream was overdue  
Your love made it well worth waiting  
For someone like you
