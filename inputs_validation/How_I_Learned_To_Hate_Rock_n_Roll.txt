Someone states the obvious  
Someone sneers at all you love  
Someone preaches ugly manners  
excluding some including me  
This is how I learned to hate rock n roll  
This is how I learned to hate rock n roll  
All feelings blunted all passion spent  
Everybody does what everybody does  
All the broken promises  
to recreate a status quo  
This is how I learned to hate rock n roll  
This is how I learned to hate rock n roll
