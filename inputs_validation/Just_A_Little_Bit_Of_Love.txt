Just a little bit of love  
I was alone I was afraid  
I couldnt face another day of pain in my life oh oh oh  
I called your name and you were there  
Just like an answer to a prayer  
You made it all right oh yeah  
  
So I give my heart  
And I give my soul to you oh I do  
And now I know  
I know I found the truth oh hey  
  
Just a little bit of loves gonna turn it around  
A little bit of love can do it  
And just a little bit of loves gonna turn it  
Around and around and around oh yeah  
  
I found the truth I found the way  
Im standing in the light of day  
I got the power  
Im not worried any longer  
No Im only getting stronger by the hour  
  
You can move a mountain  
Or calm the stormy sea  
Theres no doubt about it  
I truly do believe  
  
Just a little bit of loves gonna turn it around  
A little bit of love can do it  
And just a little bit loves gonna turn it  
Around around and around oh yeah  
  
Just a little bit of loves gonna turn it around  
A little bit of love can do it  
And just a little bit of loves gonna turn it  
Around and around and around oh yeah  
  
And it can free your mind  
Yes it can free your soul  
Yes it can free your mind  
And it can free your soul  
  
Free your soul let it go let it go  
Just a little bit of love just a little bit of love  
Yeah  
  
Just a little bit of loves gonna turn it around  
A little bit of love can do it  
And just a little bit of loves gonna turn it  
Around and around and around oh yeah  
  
Just a little bit of loves gonna turn it around  
A little bit of love can do it  
And just a little bit of loves gonna turn it  
Around and around and around oh yeah
