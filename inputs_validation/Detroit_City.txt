Last night I went to sleep in Detroit City  
I dreamed about them cotton fields of home  
I dreamed about my mother dear old pappy sister and brother  
And I dreamed about the girl whos been waitin for so long  
  
I want to go home  
I want to go home  
Oh how I want to go home  
  
Home folks think Im big in Detroit City  
From the letters that I write they think Im just fine yes they do  
But by day I make the cars and by night I make the bars  
If only they could read between the lines  
  
Cause you know I rode a freight train north to Detroit City  
And after all these years I find Ive just been wastin my time  
You know what Im gonna do  
Im gonna take my foolish pride  
Get it on a southbound freight and let it ride  
Im gonna go back to the loved ones  
The ones I left waiting so far behind  
  
I want to go home yeah  
I want to go home  
Oh how I want to go home Cant you hear me  
  
I want to go home  
Whoa baby I want to go home  
Oh how I want to go home Somebody help me  
  
I want to go home yeah  
I want to go home whoa oh  
Oh how I want to go home  
  
To Fade  
Hmm I want to go home
