Lovers depend on moonlight for a love affair  
Babies depend on mothers for their tender care  
Flowers depend on sunshine and the morning dew  
Each thing depends on something and I depend on you  
  
I can be happy I can be sad  
I can be good or I can be bad it all depends on you  
I can be lonely out in a crowd  
I can be humble I can be proud it all depends on you  
  
I can save money or spend it go right on living or end it  
Youre to blame honey for what I do  
I know that I can be beggar I can be queen  
I can be almost any old thing it all depends on you  
  
I can be happy I can be sad  
I can be good or I can be bad it all depends on you  
I can be lonely out in a crowd  
I can be humble I can be proud it all depends on you  
  
I can save money or spend it go right on living or end it  
Youre to blame honey for what I do  
I know that I can be beggar I can be queen  
I can be almost any old thing it all depends on you
