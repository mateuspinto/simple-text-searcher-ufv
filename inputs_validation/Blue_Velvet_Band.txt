If you listen a story Ill tell you  
Of a girl who once lived in this land  
A girl who was once my sweetheart  
She was know as The Blue Velvet Band  
  
On her cheeks was the first flush of nature  
Her beauty it seemed to expand  
Her hair hung down in long tresses  
Tied back with a blue velvet band  
  
I can still see those tears as we parted  
Of my heart broken Blue Velvet Band  
As I left I told her Id never  
Come back to my old home again  
  
Five years on the wide open spaces  
Was all that my poor heart could stand  
Every night as I lay on my pillow  
I would dream of my Blue Velvet Band  
  
Then one night as I lay down dreaming  
Of home and poor mother and dad  
Like a flash by my bedside was standing  
The form of my Blue Velvet Band  
  
I started next day for my darling  
Just to go back and make her my bride  
But as I reached the old country depot  
They told my my sweet heart has died  
  
They laid her to rest in the churchyard  
Midst the sweet summer flowers of the land  
On her finger the ring I had bought her  
On her head was a blue velvet band
