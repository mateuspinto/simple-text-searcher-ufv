Where you live you say the view is so beautiful  
And the astroturf thats on your lawn stays green the whole year around  
And the buildings are so tall they almost reach heaven  
But do you ever ever hear the robins sing  
Do you hear the robins singing in the springtime  
While a mockingbird sings his happy song  
Is all the beauty in your world this artificial thing  
Do you ever ever hear the robins sing  
 acguitar   
Where I live the butterflies still kiss the roses  
And forgetmenots still grow along the shady lane  
And the weeping willow trees still swaying in the breeze  
And often I still hear the robins sing  
Do you hear the robins  
Do you ever ever hear the robins sing
