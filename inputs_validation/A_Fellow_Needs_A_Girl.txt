A fellow needs a girl to sit by his side at the end of a weary day  
To sit by his side and listen to him talk and agree with the things hell say  
A fellow needs a girl to hold in hid arms when the rest of the world goes
wrong  
To hold in his arms and know that she believes that her fellow is wise and
strong  
  
When things go right and his jobs well done  
He wants to share the prize hes won  
If no one shares and no one cares  
Where is the fun of a job well done Or a prize youve won  
  
A fellow needs a home his own kind of home but to make this dream come true  
A fellow needs a girl his own kind of girl my kind of girl is you
