Youre a whole lot a man  
Just take a look  
At your great big hands  
You know you can crush  
Poor me in two  
But gentle oh so gentle  
Are the things you do  
  
I say i never have to worry  
bout you goin out  
There aint no other woman  
Aint no need to doubt  
So early to bed  
And early to rise  
I know just what youre thinkin  
Bye the look in your eyes  
  
I say buck  
So sweet is your back  
I like to wash you  
And kiss you when youre wet  
So hold me close  
And squeeze me till i sigh  
Please love me honey  
Till the day i die  
  
I say buck  
There aint no other man around  
Get your lover gal  
To calm right down  
No question bout the way  
I feel for you  
So gentle oh so gentle  
Are the things you do  
Oh so gentle oh so gentle  
Are the things you do  
Oh so gentle oh so gentle  
Are the things you do
