Hope unkown Sometimes just waking is surreal  
I walk right through the nameless ones  
I know that hopes unknown  
Sometimes the water feels so real  
As I walk through it fills my lungs my god Im drowning  
This day never seems  
This pain never  
This day never seems to end  
This rage I can not let go  
  
I hear them calling  
I feel them gnawing out holes through flawless souls  
  
So alone Sometimes I swear that I can hear the taunting of the voiceless
ones  
I fear that I alone fear those ceased to feel theyre alone inside of this
place  
I am the misplaced  
This day never seems  
This pain never  
This day never seems to end  
This rage I can not let go  
  
Now everything looks familiar  
Then every face would melt away until  
Now everyone do you know I know your deception
