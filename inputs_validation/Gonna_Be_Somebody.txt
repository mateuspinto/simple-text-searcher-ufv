You spin around and turn on me  
Stop me in my crash  
You want to be somebody else  
Say you wont be back  
  
Your bourgeois friends call you dear  
Deal you like a card  
Your eyes out for the diamonds now  
Experienced and scarred  
  
You tell me gonna be somebody  
Gonna be okay  
Gonna be somebody someday  
Youre moving through a different space  
  
Where I dont belong  
Elegance gold and silver  
Superficial grace  
Theyll pervert you  
  
Masquerade you  
Pass evil as good taste  
Theyll chew you up and spit you out  
And put you in your place  
  
You tell me gonna be somebody  
Gonna be okay  
Gonna be somebody someday  
Gonna be somebody  
  
Gonna be okay  
Gonna be somebody someday  
Gonna be somebody  
Gonna be okay  
  
Gonna be somebody someday  
Gonna be somebody  
Gonna be somebody  
Gonna be somebody someday
