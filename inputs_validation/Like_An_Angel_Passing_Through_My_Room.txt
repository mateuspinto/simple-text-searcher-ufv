Long awaited darkness falls  
Casting shadows on the walls  
In the twilight hour I am alone  
Sitting near the fireplace dying embers warm my face  
In this peaceful solitude  
All the outside world subdued  
Everything comes back to me again  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Half awake and half in dreams  
Seeing long forgotten scenes  
So the present runs into the past  
Now and then become entwined playing games within my mind  
Like the embers as they die  
Love was one prolonged goodbye  
And it all comes back to me tonight  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
I close my eyes  
And my twilight images go by  
All too soon  
Like an angel passing through my room
