Verse 1  
  
There was this guy  
A little smaller  
He was great  
And I was taller  
He was the one I needed  
I asked him out  
But he said no  
Just wanna be friends  
But Im sorry though  
So I begged and pleeded  
  
Chorus  
  
So I was left heart broken  
And no more words were spoken  
The next day he didnt even speak  
I looked away I felt so week  
I didnt even get one kiss  
How the hell can he do this  
But he thinks its alright again  
So now still we are just friends  
  
Verse 2  
  
Still love him though  
Atleast I tried  
But I think Id  
Rather have died  
But Im dead over it  
It took some time  
To let him go  
It wasnt easy  
But I think we know  
I like him a bit  
  
Chorus x2  
No more words to be spoken  
You left me heart broken
