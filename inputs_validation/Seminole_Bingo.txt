Im a junk bond king  
And Im on the run  
Me and a friend of mine  
We were headed for the sunshine  
I got my hands on the wheel  
I got gas in the tank  
I got a suitcase full of money  
From a Luxembourg bank  
We didnt stop til we got to Big Cypress  
Wandered in to the Legion Hall  
The sign outside said Seminole Bingo  
Fell in love with the ping pong balls  
And the SEC is far behind  
Down in the swamp with the gators and flamingos  
A long way from Liechtenstein  
Im a junk bond king playing Seminole Bingo  
And my Wall Street wiles  
Dont help me even slightly  
Cause I never have the numbers  
And Im losing nightly  
I cashed in the last of my Triple be bonds  
Bought a doublewide on the Tamiami Trail  
I parked it right outside the reservation  
Fifteen minutes from the Collier County Jail  
And the SEC is far behind  
Down in the swamp with the gators and flamingos  
A long way from Liechtenstein  
Im a junk bond king playing Seminole Bingo  
Well the SEC is far behind  
Down in the swamp with the gators and flamingos  
A long way from Liechtenstein  
Im a junk bond king playing Seminole Bingo
