Ill Take You Home Again Kathleen  
Across the ocean wild and wide  
To where your heart has ever been  
Since first you were my Bonnie bride  
The roses all have left your cheek  
Ive watched them fade away and die  
Your voice is sad when eer you speak  
And tears bedim your loving eyes  
  
Oh I will take you back Kathleen  
To where your heart will feel no pain  
And when the fields are fresh and green  
Ill take you to your home again  
  
I know you love me Kathleen dear  
Your heart was ever fond and true  
I always feel when you are near  
That life holds nothing dear but you  
The smiles that once you gave to me  
I scarcely ever see them now  
Though many many times I see  
A darkning shadow on your brow  
  
Oh I will take you back Kathleen  
To where your heart will feel no pain  
And when the fields are fresh and green  
Ill take you to your home again  
  
To that dear home beyond the sea  
My Kathleen shall again return  
And when thy old friends welcome thee  
Thy loving heart will cease to yearn  
Where laughs the little silver stream  
Beside your mothers humble cot  
And brightest rays of sunshine gleam  
There all your grief will be forgot  
  
Oh I will take you back Kathleen  
To where your heart will feel no pain  
And when the fields are fresh and green  
Ill take you to your home again
