Dear hero imprisoned  
With all the new crimes that you are perfecting  
Oh I cant help quoting you  
Because everything that you said rings true  
And now in my cell  
well I followed you  
And heres a list of who I slew  
  
Reggie Kray  do you know my name  
Oh dont say you dont  
Please say you do oh I am   
  
The last of the famous  
International playboys  
The last of the famous  
International playboys  
  
And in my cell  
well I loved you  
And every man with a job to do  
Ronnie Kray  do you know my face  
Oh dont say you dont  
Please say you do oh I am   
  
The last of the famous  
International playboys  
The last of the famous  
International playboys  
  
In our lifetime those who kill  
The news world hands them stardom  
And these are the ways  
On which I was raised  
These are the ways  
On which I was raised  
  
I never wanted to kill  
I am not naturally evil  
Such things I do  
Just to make myself  
More attractive to you  
Have I failed  
  
Oh  
  
Oh the last of the famous  
International playboys  
The last of the famous
