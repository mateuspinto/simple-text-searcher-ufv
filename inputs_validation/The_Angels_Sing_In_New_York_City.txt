See all stars  so fine tonight  
And the old nightingale is flying tonight  
To my dreams  
Here are the birds are quiet tonight  
And titanic is calling an echo of love  
To your heart  
And it hurts so much  
But I have to go  
Oh it hurts so much  
Cause you have to know  
  
And the angels sing in New York city  
Do what I want to do  
And the angels sing sound so pretty  
Baby Im missing you  
  
Do you need love  
Hey I see the albatros  
Do you fever  
Hey man in the stars above  
Do you need love  
Titanic  a call of love  
  
Im a million miles from home  
And the fire of mountains are calling tonight  
To my dreams  
Dont let the stars get in your eyes  
And the lonely dreamer is crying tonight  
In your dreams  
And it hurts so much  
But I have to go  
Oh it hurts so much  
Cause you have to know
