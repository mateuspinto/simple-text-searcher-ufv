No one in the world  
Ever had a love as sweet as my love  
For nowhere in the world  
Could there be a boy as true as you love  
All my love  
I give gladly to you  
All your love  
You give gladly to me  
Tell me why then  
Oh why should it be that  
  
We go on hurting each other  
We go on hurting each other  
Making each other cry  
Hurting each other  
Without ever knowing why  
  
Closer than the leaves  
On a weepin willow baby we are  
Closer dear are we  
Than the simple letters A and be are  
All my life  
I could love only you  
All your life  
You could love only me  
Tell me why then  
Oh why should it be that  
  
We go on hurting each other  
We go on hurting each other  
Making each other cry  
Hurting each other  
Without ever knowing why  
  
Cant we stop hurting each other  
Gotta stop hurting each other  
Making each other cry  
Breaking each others heart  
Tearing each other apart
