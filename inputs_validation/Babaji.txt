All of my life I felt that you were listening  
Watching for ways to help me stay in tune  
Lord of my dreams although confusion  
Keeps trying to deceive  
What is it that makes me believe in you  
  
Babaji oh wont you come to me  
Wont you help me face the music  
Bring it out so we can sing it out  
Help me to find it before we lose it  
  
At night when the stars are near  
And theres no one to keep you from coming here  
And theres no one to shield me before your eyes  
Is it mine is it mine is it mine to know  
  
I can see its not too good to me  
To be afloat in the sea of glory  
Babaji oh how you comfort me  
By showing me its a different story  
  
Your light in the dark is real  
And I know that you know it is how I feel  
When I see the reflections thats in your eyes  
Is it mine is it mine is it mine to know  
  
Babaji have you a song for me  
To tell the world of its guardian angel  
Bring it out so we can sing it out  
Oh must you always remain a stranger  
  
At night when the stars are near  
And I long for delusion to disappear  
The I see the reflection thats in your eyes  
Is it time is it time is it time to know
