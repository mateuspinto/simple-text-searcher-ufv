Dirt road in the twilight woods so cool and dark  
Up ahead pale neon somewhere a dog barks  
Honky tonk moon keeps shining on my baby and me  
  
Breaking up the pool balls chalking up the cues  
Jukebox pumping softly lazy summer blues  
Honky tonk moon keeps shining on my baby and me  
  
Through the blue smoky haze all through the haze  
Trouble seems to melt away  
My hearts on a roll Im easy in my soul  
Theres no hurry no worry things are goin my way  
  
My arms around my baby shufflin on the floor  
Cigarettes and sawdust squeaky old screen door  
Honky tonk moon keeps shinin on my baby and me  
  
Outside the dark is falling stars are twinkling bright  
That old hoot owl is calling everythings all right  
  
Honky tonk moon keeps shinin on my baby and me  
Honky tonk moon keeps shinin on my baby and me
