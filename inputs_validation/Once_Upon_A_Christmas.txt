Once upon a Christmas far away in Bethlehem  
Mary being great with child had no place to lie down  
So Joseph found a stable in which Mary had her child  
Once upon a Christmas was the birth of Jesus Christ  
  
Once upon a Christmas in a manger far away  
A King was born His palace was a manger filled with hay  
His royal robe was swaddling cloth a halo was His crown  
Once upon a Christmas away in Bethlehem  
  
And all the world rejoiced because the King was born at last  
A savior had been promised now it had come to pass  
And the joyful news that He was born spread quickly far and wide  
Once upon a Christmas was the birth of Jesus Christ  
  
Once upon a Christmas from the Far East wise men came  
With gold and myrrh and frankincense to praise the newborn King  
And shepherds left their flocks and came to see and worship Him  
Once upon a Christmas away in Bethlehem  
  
And all the world rejoiced because the King was born at last  
A savior had been promised now it had come to pass  
And the joyful news that He was born spread quickly far and wide  
Once upon a Christmas was the birth of Jesus Christ  
  
Once upon a Christmas far away in Bethlehem
