The King is dead but the Queen is alive  
Off with his head I am done with his lies  
A fair win I have fought for my life  
A clean slate after all this time  
A revolution and now I am in charge  
My evolution is to shoot for the stars  
His first mistake he underestimates  
He didnt bother to appreciate  
  
Chorus  
Rah rah rah  
Sis boom fuckin blah  
Theres a party in your honour but you wont be there whatever so  
Three cheers for the one that got away  
You were just blah blah blah  
I was oh my god  
And unlike your anatomy  
Im glad I had it in me  
Now The King  
The King  
The King  
The King is dead  
But The Queen is alive repeat  
  
Second verse  
I guess the village didnt raise you right  
Dont think nobodies gonna mourn you tonight  
No more licks to wet your appetite  
You make me sick I didnt wanna fight  
I thought we ruled the heavens in the earth  
I really thought I was the only girl  
Your secrets have all been revealed to me  
Youve been dethroned there goes your legacy  
  
Chorus  
Rah rah rah  
Sis boom fuckin blah  
Theres a party in your honour but you wont be there whatever so  
Three cheers for the one that got away  
You were just blah blah blah  
I was oh my god  
And unlike your anatomy  
Im glad I had it in me  
Now The King  
The King  
The King  
The King is dead  
But The Queen is alive repeat  
  
Third verse  
There are consequences in this life  
A punishment that fits the crime  
Your last words I heard Im sorry  
Now look at me in all my glory  
  
The King is dead but the queen is alive  
I wear your crown and I look quite nice  
I almost let you get the best of me  
But no ones ever gonna get the queen Scream

Chorus  
Rah rah rah  
Sis boom fuckin blah  
Theres a party in your honour but you wont be there whatever so  
Three cheers for the one that got away  
You were just blah blah blah  
I was oh my god  
And unlike your anatomy  
Im glad I had it in me  
Now The King  
The King  
The King  
The King is dead  
But The Queen is alive  
  
Repeat
