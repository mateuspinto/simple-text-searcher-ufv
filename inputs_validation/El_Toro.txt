Theres a legend of a famous matador  
Who went to meet El Toro  
Though he fought as he had never done before  
He could not beat El Toro  
The bull El Toro brought him defeat and pain  
And to his sorrow the matador knew shame  
They said time would never heal the many scars  
Brought by the great El Toro  
And the bitterness that burned deep in his heart  
Caused him to hate El Toro  
The bull El Toro brought him defeat and pain  
And to his sorrow the matador knew shame  
So one night when noone was on sight  
The matador went to finish the score  
In the lonely fields beneath the pale moonlight  
He fought the bulland they fought once more  
When they found the matador and saw him dying  
Hed never see tomorrow  
Now they say that on the spot where he was lying  
Still walks the proud El Toro  
The bull El Toro brought him defeat and pain  
And to his sorrow the matador knew shame
