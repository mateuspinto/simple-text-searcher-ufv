O God of Earth and Altar  
Bow down and hear our cry  
Our earthly rulers falter  
Our people drift and die  
The walls of gold entomb us  
The swords of scorn divide  
Take not thy thunder from us  
But take away our pride  
G K Chesterton English Hymnal  
  
Just a babe in the black abyss  
No reason for a place like this  
The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain  
An easy way for the blind to go  
A clever path for the fools who know  
the Secret of the Hanged Manthe smile on his lips  
The light of the Blindyoull see  
The venom that tears my spine  
The Eyes of the Nile are openingyoull see  
  
She came to me with a serpents kiss  
As the Eye of the Sun Rose on her lips  
Moonlight catches silver tears I cry  
So we lay in the black embrace  
And the Seed is sown in a holy place  
And I watched and I waited for the dawn  
  
The light of the Blindyoull see  
The venom that tears my spine  
The Eyes of the Nile are openingyoull see  
  
Bind all of us together  
Ablaze with Hope and Free  
No storm or heavy weather  
Will rock the boat youll see  
The time has come to close your eyes  
And still the wind and rain  
For the one who will be King  
Is the Watcher in the Ring  
It is You  
It is You
