Seems like only yesterday  
But it started long ago  
Trials tribulations  
And notes in the autumn nights  
  
We didnt know way back then  
What brothers we really were  
Letting the time pass quickly  
And watching it go  
  
But we stood together  
And we made each other strong  
We tried to comfort ourselves when the nights were long  
And we held back the tears  
When they needed to flow  
But where we once stood lie only footprints in the snow  
  
Even when it was hard  
To find a smiling face  
And when others would leave us  
Without a trace  
  
We never thought about tomorrow  
Or what she might bring  
We never stopped to realize  
That we might not always sing  
  
Seems like only testerday  
God whered the time go  
Where we once laughed lie only tears in the snow
