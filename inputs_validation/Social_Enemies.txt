Social weapons that miss  
Pretend them to save  
Cowards bastards to shame  
Condemned social slaves  
  
Here to save the freaks again  
You think and I bet you always will  
Here to save the freaks again  
You think here here to save the freaks  
Here to save the freaks again  
You think here here to save the freaks  
  
Snakes causing the fate  
Sadistic and free so free  
Traders defendents behave  
Lieges stay away from me  
Oh saints keep knocking  
Go home dont sell me mary  
No no making the crazies well inside  
You think and I bet you always will  
  
Calling us no good you are the social enemies  
We change the people day to day  
Making us no good you are the social enemies  
Changing the people day to day  
  
Agitators talking the show  
Messing with the heads  
To be the number one  
Smashers battling the hivs  
Proud of yourselves arent you  
Making the crazies well inside  
You think and I bet you always will  
  
Calling us no good you are the social enemies  
We change the people day to day  
Making us no good you are the social enemies  
Changing the people day to day  
Calling us no good you are the social enemies  
We change the people day to day  
Making us no good you are the social enemies  
Changing the people day to day
