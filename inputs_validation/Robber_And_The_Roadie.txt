When Willie met Ronnie he was runnin up a track  
He was bent down burned out carryin a sack  
Come on boy you got to stop and help me some  
And keep this money hidden when the police come  
  
Ronnie was shiverin and makin funny sounds  
He was lookin like a fox  
That was runnin from the hounds  
Sure little buddy I can lighten up your load  
  
You half it up Ill hit it up Ill take it down the road  
  
Never had a better combination been planned  
Cause Willie was a roadie with a rock n roll band  
They were heads back celebratin drinkin moonshine  
Heads down here we go across another state line  
  
Tanked up and bullet proof  
They couldnt give a monkeys  
Damn if he didnt hide the money in a drum case  
Pack em up hit em up do another show  
  
The robber and the roadie got a long way to go  
  
Willie and Ronnie  
  
Anytime they wanted they would pull another job  
Anywhere they found a place  
And it was fat enough to rob  
If Ronnie saw the police he would make a little sign  
  
Then Willie stuck the money in the bands back line  
In the main racks bass stacks  
Anywhere he thought it could  
Be hidden out of sight  
  
Until the finished out in Hollywood  
Split it down the middle  
When they took it out the sound  
The robber and the roadie got enough to go around  
  
Willie and Ronnie  
The robber and the roadie  
  
Forty seven days and they had only one to go  
When the telegram arived  
To say the band wouldnt show  
The crowd was getting nasty and it turned into a rage  
  
The bottles and the bodies started coverin the stage  
Then the cops came running in  
And breaking up the riotin  
When they saw the money falling  
  
Out the back of everything  
Hey little buddy think its time to run and duck  
The robber and the roadie could be runnin out of luck  
  
Willie and Ronnie had to skip it out of town  
They were sittin by the highway like Jackson Browne  
They were stickin out their thumbs  
In the middle of the night  
  
When they saw the car comin with the spinnin red light  
Wide eyed tongue tied feelin pretty stranded  
No use in runnin they were caught red handed  
Pull em in lock em up put em in a row  
The robber and the roadie got nowhere to go  
  
Willie and Ronnie  
The robber and the roadie  
  
We got state police and the FBI  
Willie and Ronnie  
You get a big reward  
If you can make these boys mamas cry  
The robber and the roadie  
We got the national guard and the bear in the sky  
  
Willie and Ronnie  
You get a big reward if you can make these mothers cry  
The robber and the roadie
