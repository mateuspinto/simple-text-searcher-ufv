How could I have been so cruel  
After all youve done for me  
I should go back to school  
To learn  
The ways  
Of love  
  
I see the tables turn  
Please dont desert me now  
I acted like a fool  
I know  
I just stumble  
Through the night  
  
I pushed you way too far  
Though youre my guiding star  
  
I broke it all in two broke it all in two  
Like a row of paper chains a row of paper chains  
My hearts not made of stone hearts not made of stone  
Though it seems to be that way  
  
Baby what can I say  
You mean the world to me  
Dont throw it all away  
I promise  
Ill change  
One day  
  
I pushed you way too far  
Though youre my guiding star  
  
I broke it all in two broke it all in two  
Like a row of paper chains a row of paper chains  
My hearts not made of stone hearts not made of stone  
Though it seems to be that way my hearts not made of stone  
  
I pushed you way too far  
Though youre my guiding star  
  
I broke it all in two broke it all in two  
Like a row of paper chains a row of paper chains  
My hearts not made of stone hearts not made of stone  
Though it seems to be that way my hearts not made of stone  
  
I broke it all in two broke it all in two  
Like a row of paper chains a row of paper chains  
My hearts not made of wood hearts not made of wood  
Though it seems to be that way  
  
Heart of wooooohood  
Heart of wooooohood
