I was alone on a shelf  
In a world by myself  
Oh where could my prince  
But a man came along  
Made my life like a song  
And tought me these words of ecstasy  
Tenderly  
  
I want some huggin  
And some squeezin  
And some muggin  
And some teasin  
And some stuff like that there  
I want some pettin  
And some spoonin  
And some happy honeymoonin  
And some stuff like that there  
  
I used to think that love was just a lotta rubbish  
A mess o cabbage  
A mess o cabbage  
But now my attitude is only lovey dovish  
And baby you youve done it  
  
Ooh  
  
I used to think romance was bunk  
A doublemickey for the ickey  
But all at once my heart was sunk  
And baby you youve done it  
  
I want some huggin and some teasin  
And some muggin and some squeezin  
And some stuff like that there  
  
I want some weepin and some chasin  
And some sweepin and some pacin  
And some stuff like that there  
  
And when I get a certain feelin I confess it  
I really only know one expression to express it  
I want some huggin squeezin muggin teasin  
And some stuff  
I want some stuff like that there
