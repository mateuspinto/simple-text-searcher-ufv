It was typical of you  
To give it to me plain  
The sign on your door  
Said make your mind up or go away  
  
It was difficult for me  
To figure you out  
Left hand  
Always wants to know what the right is doing  
  
Tell the way we miss out on something  
Were free  
But there is nothing when I present  
It was typical of you  
  
To feather your nest  
Try to explain  
Me and my big mouth were laid to rest  
Theres nowhere to go  
  
But Im not hanging around  
Left hand  
Pick me up and then you put me down  
Left hand  
  
Always wants to know what the right is doing  
Tell the way we miss out on something  
Were free  
But there is one thing when I present  
  
Left hand  
Left hand  
Left hand  
Always wants to know what the right is doing
