Take these chains from my heart and set me free  
Youre grow cold and no longer care for me  
All my faith in you is gone but the heartaches linger on  
Take these chains from my heart and set me free  
  
Take these tears from my eyes and let me see  
Just a spark of the love that use to be  
If you love somebody new let me me find a new love too  
Take these chains from my heart and set me free  
  
Give my heart just a word of sympathy  
Be as fair to my heart as you can be  
Then if you no longer care for the love being there  
Take these chains from my heart and set me free  
  
Take these chains from my heart and set me free  
Youre grow cold and no longer care for me  
All my faith in you is gone but the heartaches linger on  
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
