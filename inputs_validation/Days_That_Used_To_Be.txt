People say dont rock the boat  
Let things go their own way  
Ideas that once seem so right  
Now have gotten hard to say  
I wish I could talk to you  
You could talk to me  
Cause theres very few of us left  
My friend  
From the days that used to be  
  
Seem like such a simple thing  
To follow ones own dream  
But possessions and concession  
Are not often what they seem  
They drag you down  
And load you down  
In disguise of security  
But we never had  
To make those deals  
In the days that used to be  
  
Talk to me my long lost friend  
Tell me how you are  
Are you happy with  
Your circumstance  
Are you driving a new car  
Does it get you where you wanna go  
With a seven year warranty  
Or just another  
Hundred thousand miles away  
From days that used to be
