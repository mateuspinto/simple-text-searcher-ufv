Something in the way she moves  
Attracts me like no other lover  
Something in the way she woos me  
  
I dont want to leave her now  
You know I believe and how  
  
Somewhere in the way she smiles  
That I dont need no other lover  
Something in her style that shows me  
  
I dont want to leave her now  
You know I believe and how  
  
Youre asking me will my love grow  
I dont know I dont know  
You stick around and it may show  
I dont know I dont know  
  
Something in the way she knows  
All I have to do is think of her  
Something in the things she shows me  
  
I dont want to leave her now  
You know I believe and how
