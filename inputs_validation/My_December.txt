This is my December  
This is my time of the year  
This is my December  
This is all so clear  
This is my December  
This is my snow covered home  
This is my December  
This is me alone  
  
And I  
Just wish that I didnt feel  
Like there was something I missed  
And I  
Take back all the things that I said  
To make you feel like that  
And I  
Just wish that I didnt feel  
Like there was something I missed  
And I  
Take back all the things that I said to you  
  
And Id give it all away  
Just to have somewhere  
To go to  
Give it all away  
To have someone  
To come home to  
  
This is my December  
These are my snow covered trees  
This is me pretending  
This is all I need  
  
And I  
Just wish that I didnt feel  
Like there was something I missed  
And I  
Take back all the things that I said  
To make you feel like that  
And I  
Just wish that I didnt feel  
Like there was something I missed  
And I  
Take back all the things I said to you  
  
And I give it all away  
Just to have  
Somewhere to go to  
Give it all away  
To have someone  
To come home to  
  
This is my December  
This is my time of the year  
This is my December  
This is all so clear  
  
Give it all away  
Just to have somewhere  
To go to  
Give it all away  
To have someone  
To come home to  
  
Give it all away  
Just to have somewhere  
To go to  
Give it all away  
To have someone  
To come home to
