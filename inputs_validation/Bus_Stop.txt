Bus stop wet day shes there I say  
Please share my umbrella  
Bus stop bus goes she stays love grows  
Under my umbrella  
  
All that summer we enjoyed it  
Wind and rain and shine  
That umbrella we employed it  
By August she was mine  
  
Every morning I would see her waiting at the stop  
Sometimes shed shopped and she would show me what she bought  
Other people stared as if we were both quite insane  
Someday my name and hers are going to be the same  
  
Thats the way the whole thing started  
Silly but its true  
Thinkin of a sweet romance  
Beginning in a queue  
  
Came the sun the ice was melting  
No more sheltering now  
Nice to think that that umbrella  
Led me to a vow  
  
Every morning I would see her waiting at the stop  
Sometimes shed shopped and she would show me what she bought  
Other people stared as if we were both quite insane  
Someday my name and hers are going to be the same  
  
Bus stop wet day shes there I say  
Please share my umbrella  
Bus stop bus goes she stays love grows  
Under my umbrella  
  
All that summer we enjoyed it  
Wind and rain and shine  
That umbrella we employed it  
By August she was mine
