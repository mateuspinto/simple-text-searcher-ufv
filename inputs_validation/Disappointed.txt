Our unsleepable friend  
Gets the message on an ill wind  
All your friends and your foes  
Would rather die than have to touch you  
To say the least Im truly disappointed  
  
Truly truly truly oh  
Drank too much  
And I said too much  
And theres nowhere to go  but down  
  
Young boy  I want to help you  
See these lines  truly disappointed  
  
Truly truly truly oh  
Dont talk to me no  
About people who are nice  
Cause I have spent my whole life  
In ruins  
Because of people who are nice  
Oh this world may lack style I know  
Each bud must blossom and grow oh  
  
Young girl one day you will be old  
But the thing is I love you now  
Mmm  
  
This is the last song I will ever sing yeah  
No Ive changed my mind again aaw  
  
Goodnight  
  
And thank you
