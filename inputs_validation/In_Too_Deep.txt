All that time I was searching with nowhere to run to it started me thinking  
Wondering what I could make of my life and whod be waiting  
Asking all kinds of questions to myself but never finding the answers  
Crying at the top of my voice and no one listening  
All this time I still remember everything you said  
Theres so much you promised how could I ever forget  
  
Listen you know I love you but I just cant take this  
You know I love you but Im playing for keeps  
Although I need you Im not gonna make this  
You know I want to but Im in too deep  
  
So listen listen to me  
Ooh you must believe me  
I can feel your eyes go throught me  
But I dont know why  
  
Ooh I know youre going but I cant believe  
Its the way that youre leaving  
Its like we never knew each other at all it may be my fault  
I gave you too many reasons being alone when I didnt want to  
I thought youd always be there I almost believed you  
All this time I still remember everything you said oh  
Theres so much you promised how could I ever forget  
  
Listen you know I love you but I just cant take this  
You know I love you but Im playing for keeps  
Although I need you Im not gonna make this  
You know I want to but Im in too deep  
  
So listen listen to me  
I can feel your eyes go throught me  
  
It seems Ive spent too long  
Only thinking about myself  oh  
Now I want to spend my life Just caring bout somebody else  
  
Listen you know I love you but I just cant take this  
You know I love you but Im playing for keeps  
Although I need you Im not gonna make this  
You know I want to but Im in too deep  
  
You know I love you but I just cant take this  
You know I love you but Im playing for keeps  
Although I need you Im not gonna make this  
You know I want to but Im in too deep
