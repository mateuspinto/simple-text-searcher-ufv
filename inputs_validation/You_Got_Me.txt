When I hear voice over the radio  
From a world away so sweet  
Singing up to me I know its a lullaby  
And Im tangled in thoughts of you  
And Im all alone till you come back home  
Why dont you come back home  
  
You got me  
You got me good  
You got me  
You got me good good good  
  
And when I see the curve of the earth in your willow eyes  
Im a rocketeer coming home after years at the speed of light  
Suddenly youre there like a pearl in the palm of the universe  
Your unlikely skies filling up my eyes  
You come as some surprise  
  
You got me  
You got me good  
You got me  
You got me good good good  
You got me good  
  
I was nailed shut like a shack on the edge of town  
You were broken down  
Til you came around  
  
You got me  
You got me  
You got me  
You got me good  
You got me  
You got me  
You got me  
You got me good  
You got me good  
You got me good  
You got me good
