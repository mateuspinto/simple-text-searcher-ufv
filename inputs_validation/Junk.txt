Motorcars handlebars bicycles for two  
Brokenhearted jubilee  
Parachutes army boots sleeping bags for two  
Sentimental jamboree  
  
Buy Buy says the sign in the shop window  
Why why says the junk in the yard  
Ya da da da da La da da da  
  
Buy Buy says the sign in the shop window  
Why why says the junk in the yard  
Ya da da da da da da la la la la la  
  
Candlesticks building bricks something old and new  
Memories for you and me
