I got the power to move ya  
I got the power to move ya  
I got the power to move ya  
JAH got the power to move ya  
  
Dont take it simple  
Babylon get trample  
Them could a big and bad  
Have you ever seen love mad  
Is not a big ak  
Is not a nuclear bomb  
The system try to stop the power  
No way they can  
I got the power to move you  
  
I got the power to move ya  
JAH got the power to move ya  
Now I say things happen just like that  
When music play who knows what step will drop  
Can you feel if its creeping up on you  
Its gonna get you berfore you know what to do  
Turn you inside out  
Make you scream and shout  
The vibe is building  
Crazy reggae rhythm  
  
I got the power to move you  
I got the power to move ya  
JAH got the power to move ya  
JAH got the power to move ya  
  
So dont you try to stop  
What you feel inside  
When we hit that spot  
We tell ya world collide  
Some people try to stick  
TO what they know outside  
Acting like a programmed chip  
We tell them free they mind  
  
I got the power to move you  
I got the power to move ya  
JAH got the power to move ya  
JAH got the power to move ya
