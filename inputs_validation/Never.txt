A new sweet song of love has got you off my mind  
Ive found the new love who will walk the line  
Every night and every day  
I give all my love away  
To someone who can love me all the time  
  
Never again to be lonely again  
Never again  
Heartaches have left me now forever  
  
Ive burned the old love letters that you wrote to me  
Discovered love i thought could never be  
A love as sweet as wine  
Keeps you off my mind  
I said goodbye to my misery  
  
Memories will never bother me again  
And when i think of things that might have been  
I just pledge my love to my new love  
And then we kiss again  
  
And oh what a feeling just to know  
That never again never again never again  
Ive found a love to last forever  
I true love who will leave me never  
  
Never never never  
Never never never  
Never never never
