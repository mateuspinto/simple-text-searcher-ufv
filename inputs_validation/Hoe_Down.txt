When our Grandmas and our Grandpas where just girls and boys  
The seemed to have a lot more fun than we  
Their party clothes were calicos and homemade courturoys  
And the big event was called a husking bee  
A banjo and a fiddle and a big old fashioned barn  
Was all the preparation that they made  
And if they tell you otherwise dismiss it as a yarn  
Refreshments were confined to lemonade  
Now you may say it corny  
And I guess I must agree  
But it was good enough for Grandma it was good enough for Grandpa  
And it good enough for me  
Hoe down The country gone Hoe Down  
It puttin it toe down and kickin it heels  
Hoe Down It really a rare dance A pioneer square dance  
But with a new deal  
One two swing your partner lightly While you hold her ever so tightly  
And bring your best beau down  
We havin a show down and gotta make hast  
cause hoe down on it way  
Stand in line and do the Turkey like a Yankee Doodle Dandy  
When you turkey do it jerky that the trick now your hoein on down  
Sashay sashay sashay around while your hoein on down  
Form a circle in the middle everybody Allemande  
Boys keep tempo with the fiddle and your gal in the calico gown  
Whoa ho whoa ho whoa ho around in your calico gown  
Dosido around it very romantic  
Dosido  
Dosido some more and maybe shell fall  
Now it time to do your honors  
Then when your done your honors promenade the hall  
repeat
