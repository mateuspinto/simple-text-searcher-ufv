Going home in a trailer filled with canada dry  
Looking forward to being with you  
Got in to the broadway and what do I find   
Some ladys been sleeping there too  
I was dreamin of our meetin all down the m1  
cause I hadnt seen you for so long  
Then out of the blue something came down and warned me  
And I sat there and wrote down this song  
That was the day that the coke came to nashville  
That was the day I laughed till I cried  
That was the day all my dreams turned to ashes  
And I lost my blues and I smiled  
Well I walked in the door and I heard you two laughing  
Just like Id hoped that wed do  
So I went up the stairs left your keys on the table  
And I wrote on the mirror were through  
That was the day that the coke came to nashville  
That was the day that I had honey  
That was the day that the coke came to nashville  
And Ive got the blues out just bad  
Going home on a train going back to my mother  
Feeling better already keep telling myself  
dont you cry youll forget him and find a new lover  
So lets sit back and drink to his health  
That was the day that the coke came to nashville  
That was the day I laughed till I cried  
That was the day that I felt my heart breaking  
Aint it funny after all Ive survived  
Aint it funny after all Ive survived
