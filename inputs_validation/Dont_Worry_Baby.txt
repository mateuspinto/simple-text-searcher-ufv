Well its been building up inside of me  
For oh I dont know how long  
I dont know why  
But I keep thinking  
Somethings bound to go wrong  
  
But she looks in my eyes  
And makes me realize  
And she says Dont worry baby  
Dont worry baby  
Dont worry baby  
Everything will turn out alright  
  
Dont worry baby  
Dont worry baby  
Dont worry baby  
  
I guess I shouldve kept my mouth shut  
When I started to brag about my car  
But I cant back down now because  
I pushed the other guys too far  
  
She makes me come alive  
And makes me wanna drive  
When she says Dont worry baby  
Dont worry baby  
Dont worry baby  
Everything will turn out alright  
  
Dont worry baby  
Dont worry baby  
Dont worry baby  
  
She told me Baby when you race today  
Just take along my love with you  
And if you knew how much I loved you  
Baby nothing could go wrong with you  
  
Oh what she does to me  
When she makes love to me  
And she says Dont worry baby  
Dont worry baby  
Dont worry baby  
Everything will turn out alright  
  
Dont worry baby  
Dont worry baby  
Dont worry baby
