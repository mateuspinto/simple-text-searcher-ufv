Little fifteen  
You help her forget  
The world outside  
Youre not part of it yet  
And if you could drive  
You could drive her away  
To a happier place  
To a happier day  
That exists in your mind  
And in your smile  
She could escape there  
Just for a while  
Little fifteen  
Little fifteen  
Why take the smooth with the rough  
When things run smooth  
Its already more than enough  
She knows your mind  
Is not yet in league  
With the rest of the world  
And its little intrigues  
Do you understand  
Do you know what she means  
As time goes by  
And when youve seen what shes seen  
you will  
Little fifteen  
Little fifteen  
Why does she have to defend  
Her feelings inside  
Why pretend  
Shes not had a life  
A life of near misses  
Now all that she wants  
Is three little wishes  
She wants to see with your eyes  
She wants to smile with your smile  
She wants a nice surprise  
Every once in a while  
She wants to see with your eyes  
She wants to smile with your smile  
She wants a nice surprise  
Every once in a while  
Little fifteen
