Olivia NewtonJohn  
I believe one thingyou believe another  
Doesnt mean Im wrong  
It just means each of us has the right to choose  
Dont let anything get in the way of love  
I can love one godyou can love another  
Doesnt mean Im wrong  
Every soul is searching just to seek the truth  
Dont let anything get in the way of love  
I can sing one songyou can sing another  
Doesnt mean Im wrong  
Dont let anything get in the way of love  
Everybody has to walk their path in life  
When it comes to this there is no wrong or right  
I can dream one dreamyou can dream another  
There is no wrong dream  
Every heart is searching just to seek the truth  
And every heart is beating with the way of love  
Show our children  
Its not black or white  
Everyone decides  
When love is with them  
They are safe in its light  
I can walk one roadyou can walk another  
There is no wrong road  
Every heart is searching for the right way home  
And every path will lead us to the way of love  
Oh no dont let anything get in the way of love  
I can sing one songyou can sing another  
There is no wrong song  
Lets not confuse it  
I believe one thingyou believe another  
Doesnt mean Im wrong  
It just means each of us has the right to choose  
Doesnt mean Im wrong  
Dont let anything get in the way of love  
Oh no dont let anything get in the way of love  
I can sing one songyou can sing another  
There is no wrong song  
Lets not confuse it  
I believe one thingyou believe another  
Doesnt mean Im wrong  
It just means each of us has the right to choose  
Doesnt mean Im wrong  
Dont let anything get in the way of love  
I believe you believe we believe ah ha
