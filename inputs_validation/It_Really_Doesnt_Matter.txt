I spent some time across the waves  
I learned a lot of things I never could  
I waved my magic wand over the past  
I never understood  
  
It really doesnt matter at all  
It really doesnt matter at all  
If you found what youre lookin for  
It really doesnt matter at all  
  
We strolled around on different ground  
There must have been some kind of reason  
Nothing ventured nothing found  
Must have been the wrong season  
  
It really doesnt matter at all  
It really doesnt matter at all  
If you found what youre lookin for  
It really doesnt matter at all  
  
I flew you high I flew you low  
I flew you all the way around  
You played for me your pretty tune  
Now look what I have found  
  
It really doesnt matter at all  
It really doesnt matter at all  
If you found what youre lookin for  
It really doesnt matter at all  
  
It really doesnt matter at all doesnt matter at all  
It really doesnt matter at all doesnt matter at all  
If you found what youre lookin for doesnt matter at all  
It really doesnt matter at all
