Yo Yvette theres a lot of rumors goin around  
Theyre so bad baby you might have to skip town  
See somethings smellin fishy and they say its you  
All I know is that you made it with the whole damn crew  
They say youre a maneater during the full moon  
Mascot of the senior boys locker room  
They said Yvette walked in there wasnt too much rap  
Her reputation got bigger and so did her gap  
Cause girl your momma should of taught you better  
Ima sit down and write you a long letter  
  
Chorus  
Dear Yvette  
Dear Yvette  
Dear Yvette  
Dear Yvette  
  
Im glad you aint my sister then again if you was  
Id have to treat you like you was my distant cause  
Im not a news reporter I dont mean to assume  
What should I think I seen ya comin out the mens bathroom  
You wasnt in there alone wasnt usin the phone  
The door was locked for twenty minutes all I heard was Moan  
  
Chorus  
  
I dont really know if the story is so  
I can either ask Curly or Larry or Moe  
Or Earl Shabazz Lou Mookie or Joe  
Like Santa Claus said youre a hohoho  
In every disco you say hello  
Like youre a little angel but we all know  
Since you was eleven you been actin this way  
You always got in bed when you wanted to play  
Youre a freak you think youre Lady Godiva  
Some freaks are live but Yvette youre liver  
  
Chorus  
  
Youre a backseat queen a elevator pro  
A highpowered body makes your Levis grow  
See the stories Ive heard they could amaze  
I heard she did it on a motorcycle back in the days  
So calm down freak get a GED  
Thats a General Education on Decency  
One day youll see and agree with me  
Unless youre gonna be a freak until youre 93  
For you theres no fee everything is free  
This is from me to you not you to me  
Every night is your night your leather pants are tight  
You try to shake your butt with all your might  
I dont really wanna dis nobody  
You might think I had a little too much Bacardi  
But thats not the problem the problems Yvette  
How bad can a girls reputation get  
See shes the kinda girl all the homeboys met  
If youre desperate ask Yvette cause shell say Bet  
  
Chorus  
  
BBoys are hard on the boulevard  
The Reverend at the church said you was barred  
Homeboys on the block love you a lot  
Youre a real famous freak whether you like it or not  
So before you start walking and your beak starts squawkin  
Let me explain to you who is talkin  
Im LL Cool J from around the way  
You boogie down to my records almost every day  
Go a hundred miles an hour when youre standin still  
Youre faster than my Caddy when its goin downhill  
Wont forget that day in the YMCA  
The guy at the desk said it was OK  
For you to come inside cuz he knew youd stay  
Greg G and Garfield yelled Hooray  
  
Chorus x2
