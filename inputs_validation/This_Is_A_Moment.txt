This is the moment  
This is the day  
When I send all my doubts and demons  
On their way  
  
Every endeavor  
I have made  ever  
Is coming into play  
Is here and now  today  
  
This is the moment  
This is the time  
When the momentum and the moment  
Are in rhyme  
  
Give me this moment  
This precious chance  
Ill gather up my past  
And make some sense at last  
  
This is the moment  
When all Ive done  
All the dreaming  
Scheming and screaming  
Become one  
  
This is the day  
See it sparkle and shine  
When all Ive lived for  
Becomes mine  
  
For all these years  
Ive faced the world alone  
And now the time has come  
To prove to them  
Ive made it on my own  
  
This is the moment  
My final test  
Destiny beckoned  
I never reckoned  
Second Best  
  
I wont look down  
I must not fall  
This is the moment  
The sweetest moment of them all  
  
This is the moment  
Damn all the odds  
This day or never  
Ill sit forever  
With the gods  
  
When I look back  
I will recall  
Moment for moment  
This was the moment  
The greatest moment of them all
