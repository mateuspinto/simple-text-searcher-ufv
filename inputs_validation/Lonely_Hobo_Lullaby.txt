Heading out on my way to nowhere  
Just a traveling man  
Hitching rides along the highway  
From whoever I can  
Gotta stop someplace somewhere  
And put some leather on my shoes  
Theyre the only pair that get me there  
Any horizon that I choose  
I know when the cold wind blows  
My coat will keep me warm  
Ive got no womans love  
To call my own  
I saw you lying there  
A castoff from another man  
So I picked you up took you home  
And home is on my back  
Lonely hobo lullaby is my song  
Lonely hobo lullaby gets me along  
My shoes my coat my jeans  
And anything else I own  
Were a family without a tree  
No roots to hold us down
