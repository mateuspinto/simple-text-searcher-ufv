I got to have a shot  
Of what you got  
Its oh so sweet  
You got to make it hot  
Like a boomerang I need a repeat  
  
Gimme all your lovin  
All your hugs and kisses too  
Gimme all your lovin  
Dont let up until were through  
  
You got to whip it up  
And hit me like a ton of lead  
If I blow my top  
Will you let it go to your head  
  
Gimme all your lovin  
All your hugs and kisses too  
Gimme all your lovin  
Dont let up until were through  
  
You got to move it up  
And use it like a screwball would  
You got to pack it up  
And work it like a new boy should  
  
Gimme all your lovin  
All your hugs and kisses too  
Gimme all your lovin  
Dont let up until were through
