Chorus  
How did you feel the morning after  
After the love we made last night  
I never ever knew such rapture  
Before you girl I never felt it right  
You wrapped your arms around me and held me tight  
I kissed your mouth and girl it sure did delight  
And When I felt your body pressing on mine  
The feeling almost drove me crazy out of my mind  
Chorus  
Now and then you started kissing my ear  
You kissed my neck and then you me right on here  
And then you threw your thing in my direction  
Next thing I knew we had the right connection  
I felt good the morning after  
Felt so good the morning after  
Im looking forward to the night  
After the morning had gone and the sun comes up  
You bring me coffee girl in my favourite cup  
I love to love you all night babe  
So tell me pretty baby that youll never go away  
Instrumental  
Chorus  
And as the night went on you thrilled me some more  
You made it happen right there on the floor  
We did the dance of love all night long  
When night was through love was still going strong  
Chorus  
I never want you to be with some one else  
I got to have you all to myself  
After last night I really know the score  
And oh pretty baby I want it more and more  
I felt good the morning after  
Felt so good the morning after  
Im looking forward to the night  
After the morning had gone and the sun comes up  
You bring me coffee girl in my favourite cup  
I love to love you all night babe  
Come on baby say youll never go away  
Chorus repeat 3 times
