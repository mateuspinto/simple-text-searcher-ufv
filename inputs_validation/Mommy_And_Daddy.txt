Ask your mommy and daddy What happened to the Indian  
How come theyre all living in places  
With too much snow or too much sand  
Tell your mommy I got a funny feeling deep inside of me  
Ask your daddy Is it really as bad as people make it seem  
  
Wa ta tick it ta too too  
Ask your mommy why everybody swallows all those little pills  
Ask your daddy why that soldier doesnt care who he kills  
After theyve put you to sleep and tucked you safely down in your bed  
Whisper Mommy and Daddy would you rather that  
I learned it from my friends instead  
Do you think Im to young to know to see to feel or hear  
My questions need an answer or a vacuum will appear  
  
Dont be surprised if they turn and walk away  
And tell your mommy and daddy that you love them anyway  
That you love them anyway  
Give them a kiss  
Love will set you free
