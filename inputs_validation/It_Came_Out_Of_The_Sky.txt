Oh it came out of the sky landed just a little south of Moline  
Jody fell out of his tractor couldnt believe what he seen  
Laid on the ground and shook fearin for his life  
Then he ran all the way to town screamin it came out of the sky  
  
Well a crowd gathered round and a scientist said it was marsh gas  
Spiro came and made a speech about raising the mars tax  
The Vatican said Woe the lord has come  
Hollywood rushed out an epic film  
And Ronnie the popular said it was a communist plot  
  
Oh the newspapers came and made Jody a national hero  
  
Walter and Eric said theyd put him on a network tv show  
The white house said put the thing in the blue room  
The Vatican said No it belongs to Rome  
And Jody said Its mine and you can have it for seventeen million  
  
Oh it came out of the sky landed just a little south of Moline  
Jody fell out of his tractor couldnt believe what he seen  
Laid on the ground a shakin fearin for his life  
Then he ran all the way to town screamin it came out of the sky  
Oh
