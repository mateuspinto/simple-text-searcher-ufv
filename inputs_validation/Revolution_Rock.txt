Revolution rock it is a brand new rock  
A bad bad rock this here revolution rock  
  
Careful how you move Mac you dig me in me back  
An Im so pilled up that I rattle  
I have got the sharpest knife so I cut the biggest slice  
But I have no time to do battle  
  
Everybody smash up your seats and rock to this  
Brand new beat  
This here music mash up the nation  
This here music cause a sensation  
Tell your ma tell your pa everythings gonna be all right  
Cant you feel it Dont ignore it  
Gonna be alright  
  
Revolution rock I am in a state of shock  
So bad bad rock this here revolution rock  
  
Careful how you slide Clyde all you did was glide  
And you poured your beer in me hat  
With my good eye on the beat living on fixation street  
And I aint got no time for that
