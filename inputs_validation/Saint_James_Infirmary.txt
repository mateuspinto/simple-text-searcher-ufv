I hate to see de evnin sun go down  
Hate to see de evnin sun go down  
Cause ma baby he done lef this town  
Feelin tomorrow lak ah feel today  
Feel tomorrow lak ah feel today  
Ill pack my trunk make ma git away  
  
Saint Louis woman wid her diamon rings  
Pulls dat man roun by her apron strings  
Twant for powder an for storebought hair  
De man ah love would not gone nowhere nowhere  
Got de Saint Louis Blues jes as blue as ah can be  
Dat man got a heart lak a rock cast in the sea  
  
Or else he wouldnt have gone so far from me Doggone it  
I loves day man lak a schoolboy loves his pie  
Lak a Kentucky Colnel loves his mint an rye  
Ill love ma baby till the day ah die  
  
Been to de gypsy to get ma fortune tole  
To de gypsy done got ma fortune tole  
Cause Im most wile bout ma Jelly Roll  
Gypsy done tole me
