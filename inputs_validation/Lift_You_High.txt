Who can save the lost  
Who can heal all sickness  
Who can make me new  
No one else but Jesus  
  
Theres no other name  
Theres no other name  
  
We lift You high higher than all others  
We lift You high higher than all else  
For great are You Lord and worthy of all the  
Glory and honor and praise  
  
Who can make me whole  
Who can take all my sin  
Who can cleanse this heart  
No one else but Jesus  
  
You are my God The Great I am  
And You are the rock on which I stand  
And You reign You reign o Lord  
You reign You reign
