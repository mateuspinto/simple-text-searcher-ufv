Lock the bus undo the chain  
  
She  
She  
She  
  
Off the bus on to the chain  
Getting all to hot gotta head on 5th and main  
I look like you I feel the same  
You dont even know my name  
  
I got this tied up to my cell  
Well everybodys gone to the everybody shelf  
  
Are you coming through do you want me to take your body  
It would be so cool to be cool with you I said lordy lordy  
  
I dont like blood into the chain  
There aint a nelly man that stays up in my brain  
A dirty sun will burn away  
Do you even want to stay  
  
Are you coming through do you want me to take your body  
It would be so cool to be cool with you I said lordy lordy  
Whered you get that bruise do you want me to  
Take your body  
I must still taking your bod away
