Only the wind sang the words he could hear  
Born of the sand washed ashore on a tear  
Time wrote the lines on his face like a scroll  
Love is a loss to the man with no soul  
  
Chorus  
  
Run through the darkness he hears  turn back  
Theres no survivors you cant turn back  
Dreams keep him turning back the years  
  
Raising his sail cast away on his own  
Motherless child on a sea all alone  
Morpheus calls but they wont lay him down  
Creatures of midnight appear with no sound  
  
Run through the darkness turn back the years turn back the years
