Here comes yet another day creeping through my window  
Drank myself to sleep last night beer stains on my pillow  
I gotta pull my things together  
The night can last forever  
  
Here comes a new dawn here comes a new day  
Tune up start to play just like any other day  
Cant stop cant be late mustnt make the people wait  
Cant even comb my hair or even change my underwear  
Here comes a new dawn here comes a new day  
Tune up start to play just like any other day  
  
There goes another night here comes another flight  
Cant stop gotta go here comes yet another show  
Gotta pack up my clothes brush my teeth blow my nose  
  
No time to use the john gotta keep a rollin on  
Here comes a new day here comes a new stage  
Tune up start to play just like any other day  
  
Made a lot of conversation talked a lot of weather  
I hope we meet again some day and spend some time together  
No time for affection  
Im moving in a new direction  
  
Here comes a new dawn here comes a new day  
Tune up start to play just like any other day  
Cant stop cant be late mustnt make the people wait  
Cant stop to comb my hair or even change my underwear  
See that morning break oh lord here comes yet another day  
  
Here comes a new dawn here comes a new day  
Tune up start to play just like any other day
