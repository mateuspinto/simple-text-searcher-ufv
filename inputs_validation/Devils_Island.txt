The light that fill my lonely cell  
Is blocked out by the key  
That locks the door to this hell  
The place they wanted me  
Times racing like the wind  
Executions near  
Oh Lord I wait for death  
And yes I have no fear  
I recall that night my every breath  
And step along the way  
Closed my eyes walking  
As danger paved the way  
The devil and the darkness  
Let her evil wander free  
And here on Devils Island  
The final stop for me  
Devils Island Devils Island  
Oh theres no escape  
The sea is full of sharks  
The tides take you way  
And smash you on the rocks  
The sun is shining  
But feel not today  
Its warmth its dying  
And fading away  
Devils Island Devils Island  
Oh hear the call  
From the grave beyond  
Oh so pernicious  
Her soul could it creates song  
As there is no man that is  
Here upon the earth  
Able to terminate our  
Noisome will since birth  
The priest that reads the sermons  
Is walking next to me  
To the stake my last request  
To have her burn with me  
But so it did the heavens opened  
Rain began to fall  
The final judgment came  
And was spread before you all  
Final Judgment  
Old weak and feeble  
But the lesson taught to me  
To stay away from evil  
She doesnt care for me  
She haunts me in my sleep  
Though I tore that page away  
And here on Devils Island  
Ill always have to stay  
Devils Island Devils Island  
Here I am  
Devils Island Devils Island
