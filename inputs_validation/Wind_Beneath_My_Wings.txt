Ohhhh oh oh oh ohhh  
It must have been cold there in my shadow  
To never have sunlight on your face  
You were content to let me shine thats your way  
You always walked a step behind  
  
So I was the one with all the glory  
While you were the one with all the strength  
A beautiful face without a name for so long  
A beautiful smile to hide the pain  
  
Did you ever know that youre my hero  
And everything I would like to be  
I can fly higher than an eagle  
For you are the wind beneath my wings  
  
It might have appeared to go unnoticed  
But Ive got it all here in my heart  
I want you to know I know the truth of course I know it  
I would be nothing without you  
  
Did you ever know that youre my hero  
Youre everything I wish I could be  
I could fly higher than an eagle  
For you are the wind beneath my wings  
  
Did I ever tell you youre my hero  
Youre everything everything I wish I could be  
Oh and I I could fly higher than an eagle  
For you are the wind beneath my wings  
cause you are the wind beneath my wings  
  
Oh the wind beneath my wings  
You you you you are the wind beneath my wings  
Fly fly fly away You let me fly so high  
Oh you you you the wind beneath my wings  
Oh you you you the wind beneath my wings  
  
Fly fly fly high against the sky  
So high I almost touch the sky  
Thank you thank you  
Thank God for you the wind beneath my wings
