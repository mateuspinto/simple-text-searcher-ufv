Fly in me face  
Fly in me face  
Fly in me face  
Fly in me face  
Well i hope de bat dont come out and fly in me face tonight  
  
Well i come home from a party  
And im feelin a little spaced  
And i walk on in the kitchen and  
A bat fly in me face  
Well de bat come down the chimney  
You see he wait in the fireplace  
When he hear that im getting a little snack  
De bat fly in me face  
  
chorus  
Fly in me face  
Fly in me face  
Well i hope de bat he dont come out  
And fly in me face tonight  
  
De bat he rat got wings  
All the children know that  
What i need to know from the lord  
Is how you get de wings on the cat  
They say a bats got radar  
And he can fly through fan  
But what i am afraid of is  
That he got another plan  
To fly in me face  
Fly in me face  
  
chorus  
Well i hope de bat he dont come out  
And fly in me face tonight  
Fly in me face  
  
One thing i forgot to tell you about the human race  
Everybody get a little upset when a bat fly in they face  
Fly in me face  
Fly in me face  
Well i hope de bat he dont come out  
And fly in me face tonight
