Once upon a time in a daymare  
Dying to meet you litlle child enter enter this sideshow  
  
Time for bed the cradle still rocks  
Thirteen chimes on a dead mans clock  
Ticktock ticktock ticktock  
  
The bride will lure you cook you eat you  
Your dear innocence boiled to feed the evil in need of fear  
  
Burning farms and squealing pigs  
A pool of snakes to swim with oh sweet poison  
Bite me bite me  
  
Ladies and gentlemen  
Be heartlessly welcome  
To Cirque De Morgue  
And what a show we have for you tonight  
  
Restless souls will put on their dancing shoes  
Mindless ghouls with lots of limbs to lose  
Illusionists contortionist  
Tightrope  walkers thightening the noose  
  
Horde of spiders closet tentacles  
Laughing harpies with their tallons ripping  
Sherchrisss pervizz  
  
The pendulum still sways for you  
Such are the darks here to show you child in a corner  
Fallen mirrors all kingdom in cinders
