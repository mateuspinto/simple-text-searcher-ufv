I need to feel your heartbeat heartbeat  
So close feels like mine  
All mine  
I need to feel your heartbeat heartbeat  
So close it feels like mine  
All mine  
  
I remember the feeling  
My hands in your hair  
Hands in your hair  
I remember the feeling  
Of the rhythm we made  
The rhythm we made  
I need to land sometime  
Right next to you  
Feel your heartbeat heartbeat  
Right next to me
