Lets take it nice and easy  
Its gonna be so easy  
For us to fall in love  
  
Hey baby whats your hurry  
Relax and dont you worry  
Were gonna fall in love  
  
Were on the road to romance  thats safe to say  
But lets make all the stops along the way  
  
The problem now of course is  
To simply hold your horses  
To rush would be a crime  
Cause nice and easy does it every time  
  
Repeat
