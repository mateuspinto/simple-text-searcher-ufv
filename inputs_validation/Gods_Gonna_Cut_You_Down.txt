You can run on for a long time  
Run on for a long time  
Run on for a long time  
Sooner or later Godll cut you down  
Sooner or later Godll cut you down  
  
Go tell that long tongue liar  
Go and tell that midnight rider  
Tell the rambler  
The gambler  
The back biter  
Tell em that Gods gonna cut em down  
Tell em that Gods gonna cut em down  
  
Well my goodness gracious let me tell you the news  
My heads been wet with the midnight dew  
Ive been down on bended knee talkin to the man from Galilee  
He spoke to me in the voice so sweet  
I thought I heard the shuffle of the angels feet  
He called my name and my heart stood still  
When he said John go do My will  
  
Go tell that long tongue liar  
Go and tell that midnight rider  
Tell the rambler  
The gambler  
The back biter  
Tell em that Gods gonna cut em down  
Tell em that Gods gonna cut em down  
  
You can run on for a long time  
Run on for a long time  
Run on for a long time  
Sooner or later Godll cut you down  
Sooner or later Godll cut you down  
  
Well you may throw your rock and hide your hand  
Workin in the dark against your fellow man  
But as sure as God made black and white  
Whats done in the dark will be brought to the light  
  
You can run on for a long time  
Run on for a long time  
Run on for a long time  
Sooner or later Godll cut you down  
Sooner or later Godll cut you down  
  
Go tell that long tongue liar  
Go and tell that midnight rider  
Tell the rambler  
The gambler  
The back biter  
Tell em that Gods gonna cut em down  
Tell em that Gods gonna cut em down  
  
Tell em that Gods gonna cut you down
