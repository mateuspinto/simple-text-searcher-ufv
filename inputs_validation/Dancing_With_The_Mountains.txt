Everybodys got the dancin fever  
Everbodyd love to rock and roll  
Play it loud and baby play it better  
Funky music gotta stretch your soul  
  
Just relax and let the rhythm take you  
Dont you be afraid to lose control  
If your heart has found some empty spaces  
Dancins just a thing to make you whole  
  
I am one who dances with the mountains  
I am one who dances with the wind  
I am one who dances on the ocean  
My partners more than pieces more than friends  
  
Were you there the night they lost the lightning  
Were you there the day the earth stood still  
Did you see the famous and the fighting  
Did you hear the prophet tell his tale  
  
We are one when dancing with the mountains  
We are one when singing in the wind  
We are one when thinking of each other  
More than partners much more than pieces more than friends
