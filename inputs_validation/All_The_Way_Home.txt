Bluebirds flowers  
Sunshine and showers  
Sunsets and rainbows  
On skies of red and blue  
Badges whistles  
Rockets and missiles  
Puppies kittens  
And penny candy too  
You make me feel so new  
Like carnivals and carousels  
Popsicles and wishing wells  
And I am so in love with you  
I cant believe its true  
Were gonna make it all the way home  
Magic potions  
Incense and lotions  
Bells books and candles  
Can make a witches brew  
But I dont need witches  
Love spells or riches  
You are my treasure  
My fairy tale come true  
With you is where Ill stay  
All the time anywhere  
Turn around and Ill be there  
It was I now its we  
And I know it will be  
You and me all the way home  
Me and you all the way home
