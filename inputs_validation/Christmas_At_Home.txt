Memories of walking home  
From the Christmas party in the falling snow  
Exchanging gifts exchanging smiles  
Hanging pine cones in the hall  
  
Chorus  
Merry Christmas meant lots of whispering  
Special feelings to bridge the difference  
All the years we came together  
For Christmas at home  
  
And the radio played in the distance  
O Night O Holy Night  
  
Memories of old Jack Frost  
Frozen pictures upon the glass  
Changing right before your eyes  
With a warm breath from the happy child  
  
Chorus  
  
Memories of walking home  
From the Christmas party in the falling snow  
Exchanging gifts exchanging smiles  
Hanging pine cones in the hall  
  
Chorus  
  
And the radio played in the distance  
O Night O Holy Night
