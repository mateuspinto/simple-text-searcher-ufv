Seemed like Id gone off the side of a mountain  
Couldnt be sure I was even alive  
Fallen from the icy heights  
Landed with a broken cry  
In this valley of shadows and sorrow and sighs  
Can you save me baby  
  
Chorus  
Nobody lives without love  
Nobody gets to give up  
You can try to lock your heart away  
But love will come back for you some day  
Nobody lives without love  
  
Thought I could live out my life as a stranger  
Hide from the heartbreak that love always brings  
Make it to the higher ground  
Try to turn the volume down  
Couldnt stop the sirens from singing  
Sing for me baby  
  
Chorus  
  
You came along like a flash of pure lightning  
Crashed into my life like a runaway star  
Feel myself falling like gravitys angel  
Now Im standing here offering a stranger my heart  
  
Chorus  
  
Seemed like Id gone off the side of a mountain  
Couldnt be sure I was even alive  
Thought I could live my life as a stranger  
Hide from the heart break that love always brings  
Seemed like Id gone off the side of a mountain  
Couldnt be sure I was even alive
