Corporate decisions made each day  
Affecting everyone  
Commercial growth is all that counts  
Not harming anymore  
Invade in trust ideals unjust  
Hide your reality  
Invisible truth enslaving youth  
For useless vanity  
They do not want to see  
Their own stupidity  
Unskilled hands work unashamed  
Out of necessity  
Incompetence and sickening greed  
Void of mentality  
Abolish choice deal to the voice  
Dismiss it as a lie  
You violate claim to create  
Keep smiling when you die  
They do not want to see  
Their own stupidity  
For whose advantage anyway  
This reckless nature you display  
Is raping those who have to obey  
Undignified  
Undisciplined  
Undeserved  
Unashamed  
Unexplained  
Undisturbed  
They do not want to see  
Their own stupidity  
For whose advantage anyway  
This reckless nature you display  
Is raping those who have to obey
