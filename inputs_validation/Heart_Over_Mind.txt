I love you so much that I cant leave you  
Even though my mind tells me I should  
Then you make me think you really love me  
Then all my thoughts of leaving do no good  
You got me heart over mind worried all the time  
Knowing you will always be the same  
Youll keep hurting me I know but I just cant let you go  
Cause my heart wont let my love for you change  
Cause my heart wont let my love for you change  
Now friends tell me they see you out with others  
In my heart I try hard to forget  
You come home and tell me you still love me  
I still hope theres some chance for us yet  
You got me heart over mind worried all the time  
Knowing you will always be the same  
Youll keep hurting me I know but I just cant let you go  
Cause my heart wont let my love for you change  
Cause my heart wont let my love for you change  
Cause my heart wont let my love for you change
