I lay down by the river  
The shadows moved across me inch by inch  
And all that I heard  
Was the war between the water and the bridge  
Turn to me turn to me turn to me  
Turn and drink of me  
Or look away look away look away  
And never more think of me  
  
Carry me  
Carry me  
  
I heard the many voices  
Speaking to me from the depths below  
This ancient wound  
This catacomb  
Beneath the whited snow  
Come to me come to me come to me  
Come and drink of me  
Or turn away turn away turn away  
And never more think of me  
  
Carry me  
Carry me away  
  
Who will lay down their hammer  
Who will put up their sword  
And pause to see  
The mystery  
Of the Word  
  
Carry me  
Carry me  
Carry me  
Carry me away  
Carry me  
Carry me  
Carry me  
Carry me away
