Savoy the home of sweet romance  
Savoy it wins you at a glance  
Savoy give happy feet a chance  
To dance  
  
Your form just like a clingy vine  
Your lips so warm and sweet as wine  
Your cheek so soft and close to mine  
Devine  
  
How my heart is singin  
While the band is swingin  
Never tired of rompin  
Stompin with you at the Savoy  
What joy  
  
A perfect holiday  
Savoy where we can glide and sway  
Savoy theyll let me stomp away  
With you

Savoy Savoy Savoy  
Your form just like a clingy vine  
Your lips so warm and sweet as wine  
Your cheek so soft and close to mine  
Devine  
  
Oh how my heart is singin  
While the band is swingin  
Never tired of rompin  
Stompin with you at the Savoy  
What joy  
  
Savoy Savoy  
They let me stomp away  
With you
