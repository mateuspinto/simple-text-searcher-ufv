Diana  
There was a time when I flew higher  
Was a time the wild girl running free  
Would be me  
Now I see her feel the fire  
Now I know she needs me  
There to share  
Im nowhere  
  
All these blank and tranquil years  
Seems theyve dried up all my tears  
And while she runs free and fast  
Seems my wild days are past  
  
But I miss the mountains  
I miss the dizzy heights  
All the manic magic days  
And the dark depressing nights  
  
I miss the mountains  
I miss the highs and lows  
All the climbing all the falling  
All the while the wild wind blows  
Stinging you with snow  
And soaking you with rain  
I miss the mountains  
I miss the pain  
  
Mountains make you crazy  
Here its safe and sound  
My mind is somewhere hazy  
My feet are on the ground  
  
Everything is balanced here  
And on an even keel  
Everything is perfect  
Nothings real  
Nothings real  
  
And I miss the mountains  
I I miss the lonely climb  
Wandring through the wilderness  
And spending all my time  
Where the air is clear  
And cuts you like a knife  
I miss the mountains  
I miss the mountains  
I miss my life  
I miss my life
