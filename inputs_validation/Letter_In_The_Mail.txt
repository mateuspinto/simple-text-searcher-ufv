If I could go down now while the whole town is sleeping see the sun creeping
up on the hill  
I know the river and the railroad would run through the valley still  
I guess it never was much to look at just a onehorse town  
The kind of place young people want to leave today  
Store fronts pretty much boarded up Main Street pretty much closed down  
The church bell still rings on Sunday old folks still go the young ones
listen on the radio  
Saturday night nothing but a stray dog running wild like nobodys child  
  
And little by little light after light thats how it died  
They say you never go home again thats no lie  
Its like a letter in the mail to a brother in jail  
Its a matter of time until you can do a little bit better time  
  
It used to be part of the heartland awful proud and strong  
But deep deep down peaceful and serene  
When people used to talk about the country thats what they used to mean  
I might go down come the weekend go on my own  
Drop off Annie and the baby maybe drive alone  
Pay my last respects to a time that has all but gone  
We said Mama come look at the mountain fire in the sky its lit up like the
Fourth of July  
The mill burning down the jobs leaving town the trains rolling by  
  
And little by little light after light thats how it died  
They say you never go home again thats no lie  
Its like a letter in the mail to a brother in jail  
Its a matter of time until you can do a little bit better time
