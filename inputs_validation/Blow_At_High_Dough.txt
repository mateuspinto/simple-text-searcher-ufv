They shot a movie once in my hometown  
Everybody was in it from miles around  
Out at the speedway some kind of Elvis thing  
Well I aint no movie star  
But I can get behind anything  
Yeah I can get behind anything  
  
Get it out get it all out  
Yeah stretch that thing  
Make it last make it last  
At least until the supper bell rings  
Well the taxi driver likes his rhythm  
Never likes the stops  
Throes of passion throes of passion  
When something just threw him off  
  
Sometimes the faster it gets  
The less you need to know  
But you gotta remember  
The smarter it gets  
The further its gonna go  
When you blow at high dough  
When you blow at high dough  
  
Baby I feel fine  
Im pretty sure its genuine  
It makes no sense no it makes no sense  
But Ill take it free anytime  
Whoever fits her usually gets her  
It was the strangest thing how she moved so fast moved so fast  
Into that wedding ring  
  
Out at the speedway same Elvis thing  
Well I cant catch her but I can get behind anything  
Yea I can get behind anything  
Well I can get behind anything
