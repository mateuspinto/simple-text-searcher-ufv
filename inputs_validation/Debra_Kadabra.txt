Debra kadabra say shes a witch  
Shitass charlotte aint that a bitch  
Debra kadabra haw thats rich  
June a rancho granny  
Shook her wrinkled fanny  
Shoes are too tight and pointed  
Ankles sorta puffin out  
Cause me to shout  
Oh debra algebra ebneezra kadabra  
Witch goddess witch goddess of lankershim boulevard  
Cover my entire bodice with avon cologna  
And drive me to some relatives house in east la foogadah    
Just till my skin clears up  
Turn it to channel thirteen  
And make me watch the rubber tongue when it comes out  
From the puffed and flatulent mexican rubbergoods mask  
Next time they show the Bernaca  
Make me buy the flosser  
Make me grow brainiac fingers  
But with more hair  
But with more hair  
Make me kiss your turquoise jewelry  
Emboss me  
Rub the hot front part of my head  
With ridged unguents  
Give me bas relief  
Cast your dancing spell my way  
I promise to go under it  
If she casts a spell my way  
I promise to go under it  
If she casts a spell my way  
I promise to go under it  
Oh hear this  
Learn the pachuco hop and let me twirl you  
Learn the pachuco hop and let me twirl you  
Oh debra fauntleroy magnesium kadabra take me with you  
Dont you want any a these
