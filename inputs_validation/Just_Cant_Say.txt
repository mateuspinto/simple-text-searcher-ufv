Its not that I think you would know  
I just dont feel  
All the things I do for you  
Baby thats the clue that I am true  
Its just unspoken but I mean it yeah yeah  
But if you look into my eyes  
Youll see whats inside  
I wont have to say it  
REFRAIN  
All the things that you wanna hear from me  
And all the things that you want me to say it  
Baby say it  
CHORUS  
Well if you wanna hear me say it  
That I want you  
I would say it a hundred times a day  
Till your heart will drown away  
Just tell me do I have to  
Its not that Im too shy to say  
Bout the words that come out my way  
All the tears that you shed  
I guess I have to pay for if I can only see  
Repeat REFRAIN  
Repeat CHORUS  
Repeat REFRAIN  
CHORUS  
Well if you wanna hear me say it  
That I want you I need you I love you  
A hundred times a day I would say it I would say it  
Till your heart will drown away I would say it yeah yeah  
Just tell me I wanna say it  
Yes Im going to say it  
Do I have to I will say it
