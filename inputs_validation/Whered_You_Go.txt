Whered you go  
Dark eyed traveller  
I almost feel you breathe  
Whered you go  
Dark eyed traveller  
Can you even hear me speak  
  
You make things bright  
When they took the night away  
Led me inside and kissed all my tears away  
Said you were here to stay  
  
Whered you go  
In the morning  
When I was way down with dream  
Whered you go  
In the morning  
When fever pulled me down stream  
You made things bright  
And you took the night away  
Lend me your eyes and show me a brand new way  
Now I just feel dead today
