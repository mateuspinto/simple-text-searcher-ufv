I am an only child  
Born of the wild  
Riddled to spend my time  
Defending my land  
You are the only one  
Born in the sun  
Riddled to spend your time  
Defending my plan  
Dead dog on the highway  
Median cats are growling at me  
I turn my lights on brighter  
Im counting through the night ride  
And its one more life  
For the taker  
Chickenman chickenman  
One more song  
For the maker  
Chickenman chickenman  
On the road to Athens  
I saw a dead deer on the highway  
I slipped into a desert  
Five prairie dogs and a rabbit  
I was running down on Queen Street  
I saw a woman on the sidewalk  
Danger danger  
She was beaten by a stranger  
Danger danger danger danger  
Danger danger danger  
And its one more life  
For the taker  
Chickenman chickenman  
Chickenman hold my hand  
One more song  
For the maker  
Hold my hand  
Chickenman  
I was on the road to Austin  
Met a man on the highway  
He sold me junk and conversation  
He was wise and dirty from the weather  
I said Darkness into darkness  
All the carnage of my journeys  
Makes it harder to be living  
He said Its a long road to be forgiven  
Its one more life  
For the taker  
Chickenman chickenman  
Chickenman hold my had  
One more song  
For the maker  
Chickenman chickenman  
Chickenman hold my hand  
I am an only child  
Born of the wild  
Riddled to spend my time  
Defending my land  
You are the only one  
Born in the sun  
Riddled to spend your time  
Defending my plan  
I went looking for a car  
Found myself beneath the stars  
I went looking for a girl  
Found a man and his world  
Chickenman chickenman  
I went looking for a car  
Chickenman hold my hand  
Found myself beneath the stars  
Chickenman chickenman  
I went looking for a girl  
Chickenman hold my hand  
Found a man and his world  
I am an only child  
Chickenman chickenman  
Chickenman hold my hand  
Hold my hand  
Chickenman chickenman  
Chickenman hold my hand  
I am an only child  
Chickenman chickenman  
Chickenman hold my hand  
Hold my hand  
Chickenman chickenman  
Chickenman hold my hand  
Chickenman chickenman  
Chickenman hold my hand  
Chickenman chickenman  
Chickenman hold my hand  
Chickenman chickenman  
Chickenman hold my hand  
Chickenman chickenman  
Chickenman hold my hand
