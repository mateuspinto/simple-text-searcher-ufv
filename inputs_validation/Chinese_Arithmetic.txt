Candle light it burns in every hole of your eyes  
Its beautiful how much youll never realize  
So hush my love theres something Im to tell you now  
Your time has come around again my sleepless one  
Your friend was young hung and plastered  
He never knew his own disaster  
I think its good in fact it was faster  
Cause it was you that he was after  
Hold me now as if youll never let me go  
Unhand me now as if youve always known my name  
His love was king his love was master  
He needed more he needed always  
He searched in vein for love and shelter  
In every soul in every hallway  
So you thought shed be sweeter than your girlfriend Peter  
Well give it a second chance cause youve yet to meet her  
We got the same ideas we got the same old fears  
Theyre different colors sometimes but hey who cares  
Just years that tears our lives apart  
Just like the time that you tried to teach your cousin to walk  
He couldnt do itpushyou told him twice  
Well I do man but it just dont jive  
Tried so hard to control my behavior  
I tried so hard so hard to believe you  
But now I live only to deceive you  
So KICK and SCREAM
