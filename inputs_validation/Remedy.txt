Verse 1  
I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be  
So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breathe  
Right before my eyes I saw my heart it came to life  
This aint easy its not meant to be  
Every story has its scars  
  
Chorus  
But when the pain cuts you deep  
When the night keeps you from sleeping  
Just look and you will see  
That I will be your remedy  
When the world seems so cruel  
And your heart makes you feel like a fool  
I promise you will see  
That I will be I will be your remedy  
Ohhh ohhh  
  
Verse 2  
No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you  
Come whatever Ill be the shelter that wont let the rain come through  
Your love it is my truth  
And I will always love you  
Love you love you  
  
Chorus x2  
But when the pain cuts you deep  
When the night keeps you from sleeping  
Just look and you will see  
That I will be your remedy  
When the world seems so cruel  
And your heart makes you feel like a fool  
I promise you will see  
That I will be I will be your remedy  
Ohhh ohhh
