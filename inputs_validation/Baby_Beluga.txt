Baby beluga in the deep blue sea  
Swim so wild and you swim so free  
Heaven above and the sea below And a little white whale on the go  
  
Baby beluga oh baby beluga  
Is the water warm  
Is your mama home with you so happy  
  
Way down yonder where the dolphins play  
Where you dive and splash all day  
Waves roll in and the waves roll out  
See the water squirtin out of your spout  
  
Baby beluga oh baby beluga  
Sing your little song sing for all your friends we like to hear you  
  
Baby beluga in the deep blue sea  
Swim so wild and you swim so free  
Heaven above and the sea below And a little whale on the go  
  
When its dark youre home and fed  
Curl up snug in your water bed  
Moon is shining and the stars are out  
Good night little whale good night  
  
Baby beluga oh baby beluga  
With tomorrows sun another days begun  
Youll soon be waking  
  
Baby beluga in the deep blue sea  
Swim so wild and you swim so free  
Heaven above and the sea below And a little whale on the go  
Youre just a little white whale on the go
