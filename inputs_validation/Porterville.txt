Its been an awful long time since I been home  
But you wont catch me goin back down there alone  
Things they said when I was young are quite enough to get me hung  
I dont care I dont care  
  
They came and took my dad away to serve some time  
But it was me that paid the debt he left behind  
Folks said I was full of sin because I was the next of kin  
I dont care I dont care  
  
Oooooooooooooooo  
I dont care I dont care  
  
Folks were out one night to put me up a fence  
And you can guess that Ive been runnin ever since  
Aint no one thats bout to help and Ill keep on I tell myself  
I dont care I dont care  
  
I dont care I dont care  
I dont care I dont care  
  
Aint no one thats bout to help  
And Ill keep on I tell myself  
I dont care I dont care  
I dont care I dont care  
I dont care I dont care  
I dont care I dont care  
I dont care I dont care
