Meanwhile lurking by a stone in the mud  
Two eyes looked to see what I was and  
Then something spoke and this is what  
It said to me  
  
Clothes of brass and hair of brown  
Seldom need to breathe  
Dont need no wings to fly  
Ooh and a heart of stone  
And a fear of fire and water  
Who am I  
  
Clothes of brass and hair of brown  
Seldom need to breathe  
Dont need no wings to fly  
And a heart of stone  
And a fear of fire and water  
Who am I
