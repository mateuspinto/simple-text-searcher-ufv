You know my future like you knew my past  
And Your word concerning me was made to last  
Forever  
  
And I know Your word is Your integrity  
And that Youd do just what You said You would  
You are faithful  
  
Heaven and earth will pass away  
But Your word will remain  
Your word will remain faithful  
  
Now all I have be stripped away  
But to You I remain  
To You I remain faithful  
  
I know that Your love is forever strong  
And I will sing about it all day long  
Forever  
  
I know that there is no one else like You  
And no one else can do the things You would  
You are faithful
