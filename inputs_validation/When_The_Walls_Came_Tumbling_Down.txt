On the first day of the first month in some distant year  
The whole sky froze golden  
Some said it was the aftermath of the radium bomb  
While the others told of a final retribution  
A terrible revenge of the Gods  
But we understood the grand finale  
Fulfillment of a prophecy told many years before  
So all that was left was  
All the women were captured and chained  
And national suicide was proclaimed  
And new America fell to the ground  
And all the children lay crippled lame  
But all the nations came together  
In fear of the thought of the end  
No more would we fight in the streets  
No courage had we to defend  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound  
A blinding light the sun had died a new moon took its place  
Tidal waves and open graves the fate of the unhuman race  
The citys heart no longer beats no pity have I left to lend  
A sinner sits reciting Dylan its now that I welcome the end  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
Nobody made a sound  
Down down down  
Down
