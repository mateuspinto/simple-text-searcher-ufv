Pussywillows cattails soft winds and roses  
Rainbows in the woodland water to my knees  
Shivering quivering the warm breath of spring  
Pussywillows cattails soft winds and roses  
  
Catbirds and cornfields daydreams together  
Riding on the roadside the dust gets in your eyes  
Reveling disheveling the summer nights can bring  
Pussywillows cattails soft winds and roses  
  
Slanted rays and colored days stark blue horizons  
Naked limbs and wheat bins hazy afternoons  
Voicing rejoicing the wine cups do bring  
Pussywillows cattails soft winds and roses  
  
Harsh nights and candlelights woodfires ablazin  
Soft lips and fingertips resting in my soul  
Treasuring remembering the promise of spring  
Pussywillows cattails soft winds and roses
