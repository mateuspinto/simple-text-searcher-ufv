He sleeps alone in the damp  
And rests his head upon a door  
The only bed he knows is the floor  
  
The tramp  
Turned up collar and worn out shoes  
He doesnt care cause he hasnt got nothing to lose  
  
He sleeps alone in the damp  
And rests his head upon a door  
The only bed he knows is the floor  
  
The tramp  
No companion to take him home  
His only friends are the kind that just leave him alone  
No one knows just how lonely his life has been  
In a world that lives in a dream  
  
He sleeps alone in the damp  
And rests his head upon a door  
The only bed he knows is the floor  
  
The tramp
