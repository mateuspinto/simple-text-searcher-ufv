She stood on the tracks  
Waving her arms  
Leading me to that third rail SHOCK  
Quick as a wink  
She changed her mind  
She gave me a night  
Thats all it was  
What will it take until I STOP  
Kidding myself wasting my time whoa  
Theres nothing else I can do  
Cause Im doing it all for Leyna  
I dont want anyone new  
Cause Im living it all for Leyna  
Theres nothing in it for you  
Cause Im giving it all to Leyna  
We laid on the beach  
Watching the tide  
She didnt tell me there were ROCKS  
Under the waves  
Right off the shore  
Washed up on the sand  
Barely alive  
Wishing the undertow would STOP  
How can a man take anymore whoa  
Theres nothing else I can do  
Cause Im doing it all for Leyna  
I dont want anyone new  
Cause Im living it all for Leyna  
Theres nothing in it for you  
Cause Im giving it all to Leyna  
Im failing in school  
Losing my friends  
Making my family lose their minds  
I dont want to eat  
I dont want to sleep  
I only want Leyna one more time  
Now Im in my room  
Watching the tube  
Telling myself she still may DROP  
Over to say shes changed her mind  
So I wait in the dark  
Listening for her  
Instead of hearing my old man saying STOP  
Kidding yourself wasting your time  
Theres nothing else I can do  
Cause Im doing it all for Leyna  
I dont want anyone new  
Cause Im living it all for Leyna  
Theres nothing in it for you  
Cause Im giving it all to Leyna  
  
All For Leyna  
All For Leyna  
All For Leyna  
All For Leyna  
All For Leyna  
All For Leyna
