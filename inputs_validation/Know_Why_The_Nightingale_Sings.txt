What does the free fall feel like  
Asks the boy with a spark in his eye  
Know why the nightingale sings  
Is the answer to everything  
Taking a step to a world unbound  
Spinning my fantasies all around  
Freed from the gravital leash  
I swear the heavens in my reach  
Dancing with the spirit of the air  
In this ocean so open and fair  
Making love to the gods above  
On my maiden voyage so bold  
Landing safely to the blue lagoon  
Dont know if this is the earth or the moon  
Joy of living is no more a mask  
The Eden I found will forever last  
Migrating with the geese  
My soul has finally found peace  
Doesnt matter that man has no wings  
As long as I hear the nightingale sing
