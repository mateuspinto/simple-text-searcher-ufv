African sunrise shine on a brand new day  
African sunrise show us a brand new way  
Give us a brand new morning  
Show us forever beginning to stand on our own  
African sunrise smile on my African home  
  
In this hour of quiet contemplation  
The stillness of the dawning calms my mind  
I face the day with heartfelt exaltation  
The light is both a promise and a sign  
  
In the darkness we have lost the son of our sister  
Though the beauty of his spirit lingers still  
This was a child of love a child of laughter  
Who cannot understand the way I feel  
  
Is it not the sun that gives the seasons  
Is it not the sun that brings the rain  
Our throats are choled with dust but were still singing  
Our song will not be silenced by the rain  
  
All around the village I could hear the roosters crowing  
There was a time it was like music to my ears  
Now all I can hear is the sound of hungry babies crying  
I pray for rain to wash away their tears  
  
African sunrise light of a brand new day  
African sunrise light of a brand new way  
With one who will be our brother  
And one who will be our partner and teach us to know  
  
African sunrise smile on my African home  
African sunrise  
African sunrise
