You gentlemen who think you have a mission  
To purge us of the seven deadly sins  
Should first sort out the basic food position  
Then start your preaching thats where it begins  
  
You lot who preach restraint and watch your waist as well  
Should learn for all time how the world is run  
However much you twist whatever lies you tell  
Food is the first thing morals follow on  
  
Chorus  
So first make sure that those who now are starving  
Get proper helpings when we all start carving  
What keeps mankind alive the fact that millions  
Are daily tortured stifled punished silenced oppressed  
Mankind can keep alive thanks to its brilliance  
At keeping its humanity repressed  
For once you must not try to shirk the facts  
Mankind is kept alive by bestial acts  
  
You say the girls may strip with your permission  
You draw the line dividing art from sin  
So first sort out the basic food position  
Then start your preaching thats where it begins  
  
You lot who bank on your desires and our disgust  
Should learn for all time how the world is run  
Whatever lies you tell however much you twist  
Food is the first thing morals follow on  
  
Chorus  
  
Mankind can keep alive thanks to its brilliance  
At keeping its humanity repressed  
For once you must not try to shirk the facts  
Mankind is kept alive by bestial acts
