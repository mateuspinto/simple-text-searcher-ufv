Hallucinate  
Desegregate  
Mediate  
Alleviate  
Try not to hate  
  
Love your mate  
Dont suffocate on your own hate  
Designate your love as fate  
A one world state  
As human freight  
The number eight  
A white black state  
A gentle trait  
The broken crate  
A heavy weight  
Or just too late  
Like pretty Kate has sex ornate  
Now devastate  
Appreciate  
Depreciate  
Fabricate  
Emulate  
The truth dilate  
Special date  
The animal we ate  
Guilt debate  
The edge serrate  
A better rate  
The youth irate  
Deliberate  
  
Fascinate  
Deviate  
Reinstate  
Liberate  
To moderate  
Recreate  
Or detonate  
Annihiliate  
Atomic fate  
  
Mediate  
Clear the state  
Activate  
Now radiate  
A perfect state  
Food on plate  
Gravitate  
The Earths own weight  
Designate your love as fate  
At ninetyeight we all rotate  
  
Hallucinate  
Desegregate  
Mediate  
Alleviate  
Try not to hate  
  
Love your mate  
Dont suffocate on your own hate  
Designate your love as fate
