Id never been lucky with girls I confess  
Dont know who to blame for my lack of success  
Cause even with ones up the back of a bus  
There was always the risk of a slap in the puss  
  
But Jean oh Jean you let me get lucky with you  
  
The first time I met you it did cross my mind  
The next time I saw you there wasnt the time  
The third time I saw you I thought that I would  
The fourth time I met you I knew that I would  
  
But Jean you let me get lucky with you  
  
I love her  
  
I want you forever I want you for good  
So Im gonna treat you the way that I should  
For your soul and body my hearts gonna pound  
Even after the day that Im laid in the ground  
  
Cause Jean you let me get lucky with you  
  
Love her I love her
