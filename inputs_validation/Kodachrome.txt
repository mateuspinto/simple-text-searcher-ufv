When I think back  
On all the crap I learned in high school  
Its a wonder  
I can think at all  
And though my lack of education  
Hasnt hurt me none  
I can read the writing on the wall  
  
Kodachrome  
They give us those nice bright colors  
They give us the greens of summers  
Makes you think all the worlds a sunny day  
I got a Nikon camera  
I love to take a photograph  
So mama dont take my Kodachrome away  
  
If you took all the girls I knew  
When I was single  
And brought them all together for one night  
I know theyd never match  
my sweet imagination  
Everything looks worse in black and white  
  
Kodachrome etc
