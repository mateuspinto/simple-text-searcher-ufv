You lift up my spirits you shine on my soul  
Whenever Im empty you make me feel whole  
I can rely on you to guide me through any situation  
You hold up a sign that reads follow me  
  
You give me direction you show me the way  
You give me a reason to face every day  
I can depend on you to send me to any destination  
You hold up a sign that reads follow me follow me  
  
Down the track of loneliness down the path of love  
Through the words of heartache to the end  
On the shores of sorrow where the waves of hope crash in  
The perfect place for me to find a friend Ahh yeah yeah yeah oh  
  
You lead to places that Ive never been  
Uncovering secrets that Ive never seen  
I can rely on you to guide me through any situation  
You hold up a sign that reads follow me follow me  
Follow me follow me  
Follow me follow me
