Down the end of this barroom  
Out of sight of the light in the window  
His mind in his whiskey  
And his body in a folding chair  
Far beyond repair  
I enter his vision  
He watches me look for my seat  
He makes his decision  
And he stands to his feet  
Lord its a long way down  
  
It happened to me wonderful sight  
Only for me only for you  
It happened to be a light shining through  
From one who was lost and found  
Just like me and you  
  
Old man says Young man  
My youre looking pretty green  
Like a stranger to this kind of place  
Come sit at my table  
Come and look into my face  
Ive got a story to tell  
There was a father and son  
But that was a long time ago  
And when the time came to run  
I just couldnt say no  
So I left them behind  
  
It happened to me wonderful sight  
Only for me only for you  
It happened to be a light shining through  
From one who was lost and found  
Just like me and you  
  
We have seen it before  
In times of great sorrow  
That human compassion  
Will flow from a well  
That has long run dry  
  
It happened to me wonderful sight  
Only for me only for you  
It happened to be a light shining through  
From one who was lost and found  
Just like me and you
