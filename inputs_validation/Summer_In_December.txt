Yo yo I wanna be close to you  
  
Anytime that you go  
Girl Im gonna miss you so  
I wanna be close to you close to you  
With my head in the clouds  
Oh my heart is crying loud  
Oh I wanna be close to you close to you  
And I know you are my angel  
But angels are not flying low  
And I know oh you are my angel  
And Ill never let you go  
  
A summer in December  
Love we just remember  
A summer love in winter  
I always will remember  
  
And the way you look tonight  
Make the stars shine bright  
I wanna he close to you close to you  
Every step on my way every word I will say  
I wanna be close to you close to you  
And for me it was like heaven  
Everything will turn out fine  
And for me its like a heaven  
Baby give it some more time
