You wore a little cross of gold around your neck  
I saw it as you flew between my reason  
Like a raven in the night time when you left  
I wear a chain upon my wrist that bears no name  
You touched it and you wore it  
And you kept it in your pillow all the same  
  
My highflying bird has flown from out my arms  
I thought myself her keeper  
She thought I meant her harm  
She thought I was the archer  
A weather man of words  
But I could never shoot down  
My highflying bird  
  
The white walls of your dressing room are stained in scarlet red  
You bled upon the cold stone like a young man  
In the foreign field of death  
Wouldnt it be wonderful is all I heard you say  
You never closed your eyes at night and learned to love daylight  
Instead you moved away
