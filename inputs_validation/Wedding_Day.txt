Where were you on our wedding day  
I got the bad news that you went away  
Where were you little girl I say  
Where were you on our wedding day  
Give me back my ring  
I aint gonna let you keep a thing  
  
Where were you when I said I do  
Everybody laughing at my fine new suit  
Now were where you on our wedding day  
  
Give me back my ring  
I aint gonna let you keep a thing  
  
Now where were you when I searched the town  
I turned the whole neighborhood up side down  
Now where were you little girl I say  
Where were you on our wedding day  
  
Give me back my ring  
I aint gonna let you keep a thing  
Give me back my ring  
I aint gonna let you keep a thing  
  
Where were you when I said I do  
Everybody laughing at my fine new suit  
Now where were you little girl I say  
Where were you on our wedding day  
  
Give me back my ring  
I aint gonna let you keep a thing  
  
Now where were you when I searched the town  
I turned the whole neighborhood up side down  
Now where were you little girl I say  
Where were you on our wedding day  
  
Give me back my ring  
I aint gonna let you keep a thing
