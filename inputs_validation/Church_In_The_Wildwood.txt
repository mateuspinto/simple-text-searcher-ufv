  
Come to the church by the wildwood  
Oh come to the church in the vale  
No spot is so dear to my childhood  
As the little brown church in the vale  
  
How sweet on a clear Sabbath morning  
To listen to the clear ringing bells  
Its tones so sweetly are calling  
Oh come to the church in the vale  
  
Come to the church by the wildwood  
Oh come to the church in the vale  
No spot is so dear to my childhood  
As the little brown church in the vale  
  
There she sleeps close by the church in the valley  
Lies one that I love so well  
She sleeps sweetly sleeps neath the willow  
Disturb not her rest in the vale  
  
Come to the church by the wildwood  
Oh come to the church in the vale  
No spot is so dear to my childhood  
As the little brown church in the vale  
  
There close by the site of that loved one  
Neath the tree where the wild flowers bloom  
When farewell hymns shall be chanted  
I shall rest by her side in the tomb  
  
Come to the church by the wildwood  
Oh come to the church in the vale  
No spot is so dear to my childhood  
As the little brown church in the vale  
As the little brown church in the vale
