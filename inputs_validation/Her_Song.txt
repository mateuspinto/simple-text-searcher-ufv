Chorus  
Wrap me in a bolt of lightning  
Send me on my way still smiling  
Maybe thats the way I should go  
Straight into the mouth of the unknown  
I left the spare key on the table  
Never really thought Id be able to say  
I merely visit on the weekends  
I lost my whole life and a dear friend  
  
Ive said it so many times  
I would change my ways  
No nevermind  
God knows Ive tried  
  
Call me a sinner call me a saint  
Tell me its over Ill still love you the same  
Call me your favorite call me the worst  
Tell me its over I dont want you to hurt  
Its all that I can say So Ill be on my way  
Verse  
Eminem  
  
I got a letter from a girl  
Let me read it to you goes like this  
  
Dear old rab my name is ashlee  
Im writing to you cuz Im hurt  
When people laughing at me  
  
I get made fun of  
All the time at school  
They call me fat worthless  
School is so cruel  
I hate when lunch time comes  
Coz I sit alone  
I sit there with tears on my face  
Praying to go home  
But why go home  
All I do there is cut my wrist  
Parents dont care that I do this shit  
No one loves me its like  
Im a piece of trash  
I dont get why god had to make me this fat  
No one would ever care  
If I took my life  
Everynight I get closer to the knife  
And I have to say this all sound about right  
I totally understand if you dont reply  
I just need someone to talk to  
And you seem to be a nice guy  
Believe me or not but your music  
Really helps me  
  
Call me a sinner call me a saint  
Tell me its over Ill still love you the same  
Call me your favorite call me the worst  
Tell me its over I dont want you to hurt  
Its all that I can say So Ill be on my way  
  
Eminem  
  
First off I just wanna say thanks for writing to me  
Your story grabbed my heart as you can see  
They will stop soon just keep fighting  
Believe it or not we been in the same position  
But no one would help me either  
Either I should of listened  
But I promise we all have a vision  
We are here for a reason dont you forget that  
Pulled whats the matter whatcha become  
And let that face you your way to young  
If we could rebound stay strong  
Whenever your hurt just play this song  
Damn I get so mad  
So who are they to judge  
There is to much hate  
Where is the frickin love  
Kiss these days just try to deguise it  
But not bring em back  
Its just lost now I wanna find it  
I wanna stop all this bullying shit  
Cuz all its doing is putting innocent peoples lives at risk  
You wont a girl dead whats the point in all this  
  
I finally put it all together  
But nothing really lasts forever  
I had to make a choice that was not mine  
I had to say goodbye for the last time  
I kept my whole life in suitcase  
Never really stayed in one place  
Maybe thats the way it should be  
You know Ive led my life like a gypsy  
  
Ive said it so many times  
I would change my ways  
No nevermind  
God knows Ive tried  
  
Call me a sinner call me a saint  
Tell me its over Ill still love you the same  
Call me your favorite call me the worst  
Tell me its over I dont want you to hurt  
Its all that I can say So Ill be on my way
