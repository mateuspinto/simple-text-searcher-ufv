I heard it from the gangster  
I heard it from the priest  
I heard it from my best friend  
Way down in the middle east  
  
Have a nice day Thats all I hear every day  
Have a nice day I dont believe a word you say  
  
I heard from the landlord  
When he kicked me out  
I heard it from the spirits  
As they possessed my house  
  
Have a nice day Thats all I hear every day  
Have a nice day I dont believe a word you say  
  
When they look me in the eye I turn the other way  
Its just a trained reaction something they gotta say yeah  
  
I heard it from New Zealand  
I heard it at the club  
I heard it from my doctor  
Before he pulled the plug  
  
Have a nice day Thats all I hear every day  
Have a nice day I dont believe a word you say  
Have a nice day Thats all I hear every day  
Have a nice day I dont believe a word you say
