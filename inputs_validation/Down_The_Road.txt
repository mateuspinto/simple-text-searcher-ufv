When I was a boy  
  
Four houses down from me  
Was a family with an only child  
She was the only girl  
In this whole world that can make me smile  
  
Down the road  
I made up reasons to go  
Down the road  
  
Somewhere inside of me  
There was something she took a liking to  
I asked her to marry me  
She said she really wanted to  
  
Down the road  
To see what lifes gonna hold  
Down the road  
  
Her momma wants to know  
If Im washed in the blood or just in the water  
Her daddy wants to know  
If I make enough to take his daughter  
  
Down the road  
Before he could let her go  
Down the road  
  
Now down the street from here  
Theres an engineer with an only son  
And our baby girl says  
She believes that he is the only one  
  
Down the road  
  
Her momma wants to know  
Is he washed in the blood or just in the water  
And I want to know  
That he makes enough to take my daughter  
  
Down the road  
When it comes time to go  
Down the road  
  
Down the road  
You know I want to help her go  
Down the road  
  
Down down down that road  
Down down down that road
