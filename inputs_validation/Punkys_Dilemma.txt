Wish I was a Kelloggs Cornflake  
Floatin in my bowl takin movies  
Relaxin awhile livin in style  
Talkin to a raisin who caissonly plays LA  
Casually glancing at his toupee  
  
Wish I was an English muffin  
Bout to make the most out of a toaster  
  
Id ease myself down  
Comin up brown  
  
I prefer boysenberry  
More than any ordinary jam  
Im a Citizens for Boysenberry Jam fan  
  
Ah South California  
  
If I become a first lieutenant  
Would you put my photo on your piano  
To Maryjane  
Best wishes Martin  
Old Roger draftdodger  
Leavin by the basement door  
Everybody knows what hes  
Tippytoeing down there for
