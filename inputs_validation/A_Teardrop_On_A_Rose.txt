While strolling through a lovely garden  
As day was drawing to a close  
My eyes beheld a tragic story  
I saw a teardrop on a rose  
  
It should have been a tear of gladness  
But deep inside the sorrow shows  
A trusting heart had just been broken  
I saw a teardrop on a rose  
  
A sobbing tear that follows parting  
Holds all the pain that sorrow knows  
A false goodbye a life is shattered  
There lies a story on a rose  
  
The tear will dry the rose will wither  
When spring and winter comes and goes  
I loved I lost my story ended  
With just a teardrop on a rose
