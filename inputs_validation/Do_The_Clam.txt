Hey everybody gather round  
Listen to that bongo sound  
Grab the first one in your reach  
Now were going to shake the beach  
  
Do the clam do the clam  
Grab your barefoot baby by the hand  
Turn and tease hug and squeeze  
Dig right in and do the clam  
  
You can get your heart to spin  
On the outside looking in  
Moon aint gonna last all night  
Well lets work up an appetite  
  
Do the clam do the clam  
Grab your barefoot baby by the hand  
Turn and tease hug and squeeze  
Dig right in and do the clam  
  
Everybodys got that beat  
Well listen to those happy feet  
Aint you glad that you found out  
What the clam is all about  
  
Do the clam do the clam  
Grab your barefoot baby by the hand  
Turn and tease hug and squeeze  
Dig right in and do the clam  
  
Do the clam do the clam  
Grab your barefoot baby by the hand  
Turn and tease hug and squeeze  
Dig right in and do the clam  
Dig right in and do the clam
