The hands of the wicked  
They lie and they wait for you  
Servants remember  
The torture you put us through  
Living in fear  
Thoughts that never knew  
Your day has come and  
Time has caught up with you  
  
Theres no tomorrow  
Theres no tomorrow for all of you  
  
You wish forever  
The life you have will last  
You can not deceive us  
Remember your evil past  
Were gonna get you  
Destined for the other side  
Nowhere to run  
No place to hide  
  
Theres no tomorrow  
Theres no tomorrow for all of you  
Your life is through  
  
Theres no tomorrow beginning or end  
No choice of life it lies in the hands  
Their minds are made in the end  
No tomorrow cause you are dead  
  
Then caught alive your soul set us on fire  
You scream for mercy the flames and they burn you higher  
Wished with hope not the truth that you would find  
But its hard to live when life is so blind  
  
Theres no tomorrow  
Theres no tomorrow for all of you
