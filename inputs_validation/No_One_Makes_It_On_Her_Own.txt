Have you ever had the feeling  
You take it all for granted  
You wake up every morning  
And expect to rise  
Have you ever had a moment  
To look into the mirror  
To find a person  
Who wont open her eyes  
Have you ever felt a presence  
Or is it all in the past dear  
So mesmerizing  
It chills you to the bone  
Have you ever been in love  
And overcome that first fear  
Well then you know  
No one makes it on her own  
  
Did you ever catch a sunset  
Right across the ocean  
The universe revealed  
And it didnt make sense at all  
When you came into my world  
Causing quite a commotion  
I could have sworn Ive met you  
Many times before  
Cos theres something in your eyes  
That links us together  
Something bout your face your lips  
Your smile looks so alone  
Have you ever been in love  
And thought itd last forever  
Well then you know  
No one makes it on her own  
  
Hey theres something in your eyes  
That links us together  
Something bout your face your lips  
Your smile looks so alone  
Have you ever been in love  
And thought itd last forever  
Then you know  
No one makes it on her own  
  
Nobody makes it on her own  
Nobody makes it  
Nobody makes it  
Nobody makes it on her own  
No one makes it on her own
