My father says  
That children keep growing  
Rivers keep flowing too  
My father says  
He doesnt know why  
But somehow or other they do  
They do  
Some how or other they do  
  
A hundred million miracles  
A hundred million miracles  
Are happning evry day  
And those who say  
They dont agree  
Are those  
Who do not hear or see  
A hundred million miracles  
A hundred million miracles  
Are happning evry day  
  
Miracle of changing weather  
When a dark blue curtain  
Is pinned by the stars  
Pinned by the stars to the sky  
Evry floware  
And tree is a treat to see  
The air is very clean and dry  
  
Then a wind comes blowing  
The pins all away  
Night is confused and upset  
The sky falls down  
Like a clumsy clown  
The flowers  
And the trees get wet  
Very wet  
  
A hundred million miracles  
A hundred million miracles  
Are happning evry day  
And when the wind  
Shall turn his face  
The pins  
Are put right back in place  
A hundred million miracles  
A hundred million miracles  
Are happning evry day  
  
In evry single minute  
So much is going on  
Along the Yangtse Kiang  
Or the Tiber or the Don  
A hundred million miracles  
  
A swallow in Tasmania  
Is sitting on her eggs  
And suddenly  
Those eggs have wings  
And eyes and beaks and legs  
A hundred million miracles  
  
A little girl in Chungking  
Just thirty inches tal  
Decides that she  
Will try to walk  
And nearly doesnt fall  
A hundred million miracles  
  
A hundred million miracles  
A hundred million miracles  
A hundred million miracles  
Are happning evry day  
  
My father says the sun  
Will keep rising over  
The eastern hill  
My father says  
He doesnt know  
Why but somehow  
Or other it will  
It will  
Somehow or other it will  
  
Miracle of making music  
When an idle poet  
Puts words on a page  
Writes on a page  
With his brush  
A musical friend  
Writes the notes to blend  
Suggested  
By an idle thrush  
  
Then a young soprano  
Reads what they wrote  
Learns every note  
Every word  
Puts all they wrote  
In her lovely throat  
And suddenly  
A song is heard  
Very pretty  
  
A hundred million miracles  
A hundred million miracles  
A hundred million miracles  
Are happning evry day
