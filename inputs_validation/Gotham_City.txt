Im lookin over the skyline of the city  
How loud quiet nights in the mist of crime  
How next door to happiness lives sorrow  
And signals of solution in the sky  
  
A city of justice a city of love a city of peace  
For everyone of us  
We all need it cant live without it  
A Gotham City oh yeah  
  
How sleepin awake because of fear  
Oh yeah  
How children are drowning in their tears  
How we need a place where we can go  
A land where every one will have a hero  
Even me  
  
A city of justice a city of love a city of peace  
For everyone of us  
Cause we all need it yeah cant live without it  
A Gotham City oh yeah  
  
A city of justice a city of love a city of peace  
For everyone of us  
Cause we all need it cant live without it  
A Gotham City oh yeah  
  
Yet in the middle of stormy weather  
We wont stumble and we wont fall  
I know a place that all this shelter  
  
City of justice city of love city of peace  
For everyone of us  
We all need it cant live without it  
Gotham City oh yeah  
  
We need a city of justice city of love city of peace  
For everyone of us  
We all need it cant live without it  
Gotham City oh yeah  
  
City of justice city of love city of peace  
For everyone of us  
Yes we all need it cant live without it  
Gotham City oh yeah  
  
A Gotham City  
Everybody needs Gotham City  
Gotham City  
Dont you want one oh yeah  
  
Come on come on Gotham City  
Everybody needs Gotham City
