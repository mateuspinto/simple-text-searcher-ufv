I will bless the Lord forever  
And I will trust Him at all times  
He has delivered me from all fear  
And He has set my feet upon a rock  
I will not be moved and Ill say of the Lord  
You are my shield my strength my portion  
Deliverer my shelter strong tower  
My very present help in time of need  
Whom have I in heaven but You  
Theres none I desire beside You  
For You have made me glad and Ill say of the Lord  
You are my shield my strength my portion  
Deliverer my shelter strong tower  
My very present help  
You are my shield my strength my portion  
Deliverer my shelter strong tower  
My very present help in time of need  
You have made me glad and Ill say of the Lord  
You are my shield my strength my portion  
Deliverer my shelter strong tower  
My very present help  
You are my shield my strength my portion  
Deliverer my shelter strong tower  
My very present help in time of need  
My very present help in time of need
