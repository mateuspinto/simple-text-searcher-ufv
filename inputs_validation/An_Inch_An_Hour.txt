I want a book thatll make me drunk  
Full of freaks and disenfranchised punks  
No amount of hate no load of junk  
No bag or words no costume trunk  
Could make me feel the same way  
An inch an hour two feet a day  
To move through night  
In this most fashionable way  
Theres this fuckin band you gotta see  
They used to scare the living shit outta me  
No frothing dog no cool insanity  
No rock n roll no Christianity  
Makes me feel the same way  
An inch an hour two feet a day  
To move through night with very little else to say  
But Im helpless less with the people than the space  
No struggle town no bemused Trudeau  
No solitary walks through vacant lots in moon glow  
Tonight the winter may have missed its mark  
You can see your breath in Springside Park  
Coffeecolored ice and peeling birch bark  
The sound of rushing water in the dark  
Makes me feel the same way  
An inch an hour two feet a day  
To move through life with very little else to say  
But Im helpless more with the people than the space  
I mean Im helpless less with the people than the space  
You see I dont know Neil I dont know Neil
