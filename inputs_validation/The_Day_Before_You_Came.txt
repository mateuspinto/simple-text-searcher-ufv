I must have left my house at eight because I always do  
My train Im certain left the station just when it was due  
I must have read the morning paper going into town  
And having gotten through the editorial no doubt I must have frowned  
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine  
With letters to be read and heaps of papers waiting to be signed  
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so  
The usual place the usual bunch  
And still on top of this Im pretty sure it must have rained  
The day before you came  
  
I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two  
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue  
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day  
Without really knowing anything I hid a part of me away  
At five I must have left theres no exception to the rule  
A matter of routine Ive done it ever since I finished school  
The train back home again  
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then  
Oh yes Im sure my life was well within its usual frame  
The day before you came  
  
I must have opened my front door at eight oclock or so  
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go  
Im sure I had my dinner watching something on TV  
Theres not I think a single episode of Dallas that I didnt see  
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten  
I need a lot of sleep and so I like to be in bed by then  
I must have read a while  
The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style  
Its funny but I had no sense of living without aim  
The day before you came  
  
And turning out the light  
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night  
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain  
The day before you came
