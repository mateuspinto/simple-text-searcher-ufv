Key ddemo recorded by hank williams probably 1949  
  
d now Ive been married about six months  
Only six d7 months you g see  
The a7 first three months was all ok  
But the last three is killin d me  
My wife began her hissin cut down on her kissin  
And then she failed to d7 shine my g shoes  
My a7 shirts they came up wrinkled  
My pants with dirt were sprinkled  
And then I took the first year d blues  
  
d well then she started naggin  
She left the sink asaggin  
With dishes d7 piled up g high  
No a7 food upon the table she said if she was able  
Shed cook something bye and d bye  
Then I began to wonder if I had made a blunder  
When I d7 said I g do she a7 must have read my thinkin  
Her eyes began to blinkin and that gal broke in d  to  
  
d well I heard the dishes crashin  
And I began to dashin gettin d7 out of g sight  
For a7 right there was my honey  
On who Id spent my money turnin into dy  na  d  mite  
Then after shed exploded her meanness all unloaded  
And things began to d7 simmer g down  
I a7 found myself ableedin and very much aneedin  
Of stitches taken all a  d  round  
  
d well then she started cryin I felt myself asighin  
And then I took her d7 in my g arms  
I a7 was afraid to scold her so I just gently told her  
She didnt do a bit of d harm  
Now the first six months is over and I am much the older  
And experienced d7 with a g wife  
If a7 I can stand the next six my friends all say Ill be fixed  
To take it the rest of my d life
