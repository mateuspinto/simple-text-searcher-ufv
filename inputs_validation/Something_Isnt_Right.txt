Once in a lifetime something happens no one understands  
Turns the whole world inside out turns water into blazing sand  
Who in the world who ever guess that something wasnt right  
Who can explain when the sun comes up in the middle of a winter night  
  
Im burnin up now baby  
Im burnin up now baby baby please  
  
Who would have guessed that when I first set eyes upon your face  
History would be rearranged and nothing would ever be the same  
Who would believe that in my heart is a piece of burning coal  
Slowly turning from a fire to a raging blaze without control  
  
Im burnin up now baby Im burnin up now baby  
Ive seen so much it scares me  
I cant cool off cause something isnt right  
  
What do you think would happen if I sat outside your door  
Howled like a dog and played guitar and begged you baby baby please  
How do you think your folks would feel if I broke into your house  
Snuck in your room while you were asleep  
And prayed to you down on my knees  
Im burnin up now baby  
Im burnin up now baby  
Ive seen so much it scares me  
I cant cool off cause something isnt right  
  
Who in the world would ever guess  
That somewhere in the middle of our cozy nest  
There were dark things lurking in the back of your mind  
Just open the window and look with your eyes  
Where in the good book does it say  
That destiny cannot be changed  
Who in the world would ever know  
If you walked out the door and never came home  
Cause something is not right
