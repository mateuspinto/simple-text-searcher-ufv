Monkeys are jumping from tree to tree  
Whales are swimming from sea to sea  
Birds are flying from sky to sky  
People are seeing eye to eye  
Were all one

Earth is turning evry day  
Rivers are flowing in every way  
Trees are growing day by day  
And people are loving in their own way  
Were all one
