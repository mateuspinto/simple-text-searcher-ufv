I am lost in the world of you  
Cant believe where you take me to  
As soon as you enter my mind or you crawl over my skin  
Leave me no other choice but to let you in  
Love takes over me  
I can feel it  
Cause your love takes over me  
I can see it  
Oh your love takes over me  
I can taste it  
Yeah your love takes over me  
I can be it  
Take take me now  
I cant take no more  
Feel me breathe  
Feel the energy  
How did I fall prey to this  
Pleasure is my lonely guide  
Yeah I escaped despite of you  
Now that youre inside  
Love takes over me  
I can feel it  
When your love takes over me  
I can see it  
Your love takes over me  
I can taste it  
Yeah your love takes over me  
I can be it  
Magic is running through my veins  
Pleasure is coming closer then  
So hurt with me now  
So I wont hurt no more  
Hear me scream  
Hear my suffering  
When your love takes over me  
I can feel it  
Your love takes over me  
I can see it  
Love takes over me  
I can taste it  
Love takes over me  
I can be it  
I can feel it  
Love takes over me  
I can see it  
Your love takes over me  
I can taste it  
Love takes over me  
I can be it
