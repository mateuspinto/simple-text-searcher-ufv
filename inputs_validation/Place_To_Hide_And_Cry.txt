Today I saw you for the first time in a long time  
You looked so happy it brought tears to my eyes  
I tried to speak the words would not come through me  
So I ran to find a place to hide and cry  
A place to hide and cry a place to try and die  
Yes I ran to find a place to hide and cry  
 steel   
I suppose in ways Im weak just like a baby  
But my love for you is stronger than my pride  
Each time I think of you oh how it hurts me  
And I have to find a place to hide and cry  
A place to hide and cry a place to try and die  
Yes I have to find a place to hide and cry
