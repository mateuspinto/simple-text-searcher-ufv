Round n around n around  
Round n around n around  
Round n around n around  
And around and around  
  
Chorus  
Oh stop the world and let me off  
Im tired of goin round n round  
I played the game of love and lost  
So stop the world and let me off  
  
My heart is shattered cant you see  
Cause you no longer care for me  
But someday Im sure youll see  
Loving you did this to me  
  
My dream world tumbled to the ground  
The one I love has let me down  
I lost the wonder of his kiss  
How could he leave me here like this  
  
Chorus  
  
Lock all this burning up inside  
I know his love for me has died  
I lost the wonder of his kiss  
How could he leave me here like this  
  
Chorus
