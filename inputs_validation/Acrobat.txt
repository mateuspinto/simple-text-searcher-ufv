Dont believe what you hear  
Dont believe what you see  
If you just close your eyes  
You can feel the enemy  
When I first met you girl  
You had fire in your soul  
What happened your face of melting in snow  
Now it looks like this  
  
And you can swallow  
Or you can spit  
You can throw it up  
Or choke on it  
And you can dream  
So dream out loud  
You know that your time is coming round  
So dont let the bastards grind you down  
  
No nothing makes sense  
Nothing seems to fit  
I know youd hit out  
If you only knew who to hit  
And Id join the movement  
If there was one I could believe in  
Yeah Id break bread and wine  
If there was a church I could receive in  
Cause I need it now  
  
To take the cup  
To fill it up  
To drink it slow  
I cant let you go  
I must be an acrobat  
To talk like this  
And act like that  
And you can dream  
So dream out loud  
And dont let the bastards grind you down  
  
Oh it hurts baby  
What are we going to do Now its all been said  
No new ideas in the house and every book has been read  
  
And I must be an acrobat  
To talk like this  
And act like that  
And you can dream  
So dream out loud  
And you can find  
Your own way out  
And you can build  
And I can will  
And you can call  
I cant wait until  
You can stash  
And you can seize  
Responsibilities  
And I can love  
And I can love  
And I know that the tide is turning round  
So dont let the bastards grind you down
