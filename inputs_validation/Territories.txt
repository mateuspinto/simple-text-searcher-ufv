I see the Middle Kingdom between Heaven and Earth  
Like the Chinese call the country of their birth  
We all figure that our homes are set above  
Other people than the ones we know and love  
In every place with a name  
They play the same territorial game  
Hiding behind the lines  
Sending up warning signs  
  
The whole wide world  
An endless universe  
Yet we keep looking through  
The eyeglass in reverse  
Dont feed the people  
But we feed the machines  
Cant really feel  
What international means  
In different circles  
We keep holding our ground  
Indifferent circles  
We keep spinning round and round  
  
We see so many tribes  overrun and undermined  
While their invaders dream of lands theyve left behind  
Better people  better food  and better beer  
Why move around the world when Eden was so near  
The bosses get talking so tough  
And if that wasnt evil enough  
We get the drunken and passionate pride  
Of the citizens along for the ride  
  
They shoot without shame  
In the name of a piece of dirt  
For a change of accent  
Or the color of your shirt  
Better the pride that resides  
In a citizen of the world  
Than the pride that divides  
When a colorful rag is unfurled
