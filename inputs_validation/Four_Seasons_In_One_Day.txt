Four seasons in one day  
Lying in the depths of your imagination  
Worlds above and worlds below  
The sun shines on the black clouds hanging over the domain  
  
Even when youre feeling warm  
The temperature could drop away  
Like four seasons in one day  
  
Smiling as the shit comes down  
You can tell a man from what he has to say  
Everything gets turned around  
And I will risk my neck again again  
  
You can take me where you will  
Up the creek and through the mill  
Like all the things you cant explain  
Four seasons in one day  
  
Blood dries up  
Like rain like rain  
Fills my cup  
Like four seasons in one day  
  
It doesnt pay to make predictions  
Sleeping on an unmade bed  
Finding out wherever there is comfort there is pain  
Only one step away  
Like four seasons in one day  
  
Blood dries up  
Like rain like rain  
Fills my cup  
Like four seasons in one day
