How Id love to hear the organ  
In the chapel in the moonlight  
While were strolling down the aisle  
Where roses entwine  
  
How Id love to hear you whisper  
In the chapel in the moonlight  
That the love light in your eyes  
Forever will shine  
  
Til the roses turn to ashes  
Til the organ turns to rust  
If you never come Ill still be there  
Til the moonlight turns to dust  
  
How Id love to hear the choir  
In the chapel in the moonlight  
As they sing Oh Promise Me  
Forever be mine
