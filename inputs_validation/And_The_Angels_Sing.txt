We meet and the angels sing  
The angels sing the sweetest song Ive ever heard  
You speak and the angels sing  
Or am I breathing music into evry word  
  
Suddenly the setting is strange  
I can see water and moonlight beaming  
Silver waves that break on some undiscovered shore  
Then suddenly I see it all change  
Long winter nights with the candles gleaming  
Through it all your face that I adore  
  
You smile and the angels sing  
And though its just a gentle murmur at the start  
We kiss and the angels sing  
And leave their music ringing in my heart
