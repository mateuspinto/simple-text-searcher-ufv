Well I was borned a coal miners daughter  
In a cabin on a hill in butcher holler  
We were poor but we had love  
Thats the one thing that daddy made sure of  
He shoveled coal to make a poor mans dollar  
  
My daddy worked all night in the Van Lear coal mines  
All day long in the field a hoin corn  
Mommy rocked the babies at night  
And read the bible by the coal oil light  
And ever thing would start all over come break of morn  
  
Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miners pay  
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard ever day  
Why Ive seen her fingers bleed  
To complain there was no need  
Shed smile in mommys understanding way  
  
In the summertime we didnt have shoes to wear  
But in the wintertime we all got a brand new pair  
From a mail order catalog  
Money made from selling a hog  
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere  
  
Yeah Im proud to be a coal miners daughter  
I remember well the well where I drew water  
The work we done was hard  
At night wed sleep cause we were tired  
I never thought of ever leaving butcher holler  
  
Well a lot of things have changed since a way back then  
And it feels so good to be back home again  
Not much left but the floor nothing lives here anymore  
Except the memory of a coal miners daughter
