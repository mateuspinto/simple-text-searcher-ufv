Went to the fortune teller  
To have my fortune read  
I didnt what to tell her  
I had a dizzy feeling in my head  
  
Said shed take a look at my palm  
Said Son do you feel kind of warm  
And she looked into her crystal ball  
Said Youre in love  
  
Said it could not be so  
Not with all the girls I know  
Said when the next one arrives  
Looking into her eyes  
  
I left there in a hurry  
Much to my big surprise  
The next thing I discovered  
The fortune teller told me lies  
  
So I ran back to that woman  
Mad as I could be  
Told her I didnt see nobody  
How she made a fool out of me  
  
At last something shook me  
As if it came down from above  
And now the fortune teller  
And I fell in love
