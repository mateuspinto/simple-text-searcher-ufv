On a bench on the beach  
Just before the sun had gone  
I tried to reach you  
Plain faced and falling fast  
You looked so vacant like an empty shell  
Whose life had passed upon the ocean  
  
Before light shook the sky  
Down by the docks I saw  
The masts unfolding  
Dont turn away please understand  
Its a life and a living  
And a way to keep the wolves away  
From hungry hands from hungry hands  
  
Crazy water  
Takes my fishing boat on Monday morning  
Dangerous dreaming  
If we all believe in the things you believe youre seeing  
Oh wed never drop our nets in the crazy water crazy water  
  
Tangled lives lonely wives  
Shoreline widows pray  
For the souls of missing whalers  
Endless nights on an endless sea  
Where nothing lives between us  
Just the breakers on the ocean  
Separating you and me  
Separating you and me
