Find a way to my heart and I will always be with you  
From wherever you are Ill be waiting  
Ill keep a place in my heart you will see it shining through  
So find a way to my heart and I will I will follow you  
  
This journeys not easy for you I know  
If your footsteps get too faint to hear Ill go  
Cause you know questions are never that easy  
And never the same  
You have the answer believe me  
If you have the faith  
  
Find a way to my heart and I will always be with you  
From wherever you are Ill be waiting  
Ill keep a place in my heart you will see it shining through  
So find a way to my heart and I will I will follow you  
  
Time may come and time may go I know  
If you should call out for me Ill go  
But you know there is a code to be broken  
I wrap it around  
Without a word being spoken  
Without a sound  
  
Theres a reason I hide my heart  
Out of sight out of mind  
And when I find out just who you are  
The door will be open for you to  
  
Find a way to my heart and I will always be with you  
From wherever you are Ill be waiting  
Ill keep a place in my heart you will see it shining through  
So find a way to my heart and I will I will follow you
