This the time  
This is the vibe  
Dont you want to get onto the ride  
Come on inside  
From the outside  
The truth will set you free and you will find  
That there is a love  
That wont let you down  
And it always holds ground  
Wear your crown  
  
This love will never leave you  
This love will never let you go  
It is time for a love revolution  
It is time for a new constitution  
You are a child of the most high  
There is nothing you cant do and that is no lie  
You were designed  
To use your mind  
To move what you cant see so dont be blind  
There is a love  
That wont let you down and it always holds ground  
Wear your crown  
  
This love will never leave you  
This love will never let you go  
It is time for a love revolution  
It is time for a new constitution  
  
It is time for a love revolution  
It is time for a new constitution  
It is time for a love revolution  
It is time for a new constitution  
Yeah yeah yeah  
It is time for a love revolution  
It is time for a new constitution  
Yeah yeah yeah
