Fanfare For The Common Man  
Written by Aaron Copland  
Lead vocals by James Young  
  
Another new day takes up on you  
A fanfare wakes the land  
The naked lives just a shining down  
At the dawn of the common man  
  
Outside in the madding crowd  
He laughs along the way  
Traffic city what a pity  
It doesnt have a word to say  
  
Troubled people billions of people  
They cant seem to understand  
The ringing ears are unable to hear  
The sounds of the natural plan  
  
Yeah yeah yeah
