LH cause 714 is the area  
Everybody grab a friend and jump on in  
Get a new view and a message to send  
Look for the truth and hand you can lend  
But you Got something to prove  
A turn of your back and youre on the move  
And me I get to see  
  
All of the things that you had and all you could be  
When the world is all about you  
Cant you make your way through  
And all I can do is say  
Hey man where ya going  
Going real far and I wont stop for nothing  
Hey man what ya thinking  
What I see is me dont you see me shining  
Why do you think you can make the world yours  
No way today  
  
So your a big shot now still dont know who you are and  
Everything you want and need is at your feet so what  
Good times  
Drink your red wine  
Try not to think of things left behind  
Youre a star  
  
And youve made it this far  
Strange how you really dont know who you are  
Divide All your time and your pride  
Take all the names that youve learned in stride  
When the world is all about you  
Cant you make your way through  
And all I can do is say  
Hey man where ya going  
Going real far and I wont stop for nothing  
Hey man what ya thinking  
What I see is me dont you see me shining  
Why do you think you can make the world yours  
No way today  
God damn  
  
Here it comes again  
My friend Ill stay to the end  
But I need some room so that I can get in This place  
Its all a waste  
Your energy spent on just getting a taste  
  
And me  
I get to see  
All the things that you had and all you could be  
When the world is all about you  
Cant you make your way through  
And all I can do is say  
Hey man where ya going  
Going real far and I wont stop for nothing  
Hey man what ya thinking  
What I see is me dont you see me shining  
Why do you think you can make the world yours  
  
No way today  
So ideal  
Your time is running but you dont know why  
And nothing comes for free when you dont want to try  
So unreal  
Your time is running and I see it  
All of your life did you really want to be it  
Your time is running out
