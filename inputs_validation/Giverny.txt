Deep inside these old dusty walls  
Theres a sacred heart Id know this garden anywhere  
She was warm she was deep summertime  
She was love itself and she was standing there  
Standing close so close to me  
I closed my eyes and I could see  
Giverny  
  
And in this strange and holy place  
I looked for love and found it everywhere  
It was what you saw she came to see  
Because of you she was standing there  
Giverny  
  
Books may burn and rain may fall  
But what is here I know will last forever more  
Colours change there are no defines  
She was love itself and I thank you for giving me  
Giverny
