Prine  
She was a levelheaded dancer on the road to alcohol  
I was just a soldier on my way to Montreal  
Well she pressed her chest against me about the time the jukebox broke  
She gave me a peck on the back of the neck and these are the words she spoke  
  
Blow up your tv throw away your paper go to the country build you a home  
Plant a little garden eat a lot of peaches try and find Jesus on your own  
  
I sat there at the table and I acted real naive  
Cause I knew that topless lady she had something up her sleeve  
She danced around the room awhile and she did the hoochy coo  
Yeah singing a song all night long telling me what to do  
  
Blow up your tv throw away your paper go to the country build you a home  
Plant a little garden eat a lot of peaches try and find Jesus on your own  
  
Well I was young and hungry and about to leave that place  
Just as I was going She looked me in the face  
I said You must know the answer she said No but Ill give it a try  
To this day weve been living our way here is the reason why  
  
We blew up your tv threw away your paper went to the country build us a
home  
Had a lot of children fed em on peaches they all found Jesus on their own
