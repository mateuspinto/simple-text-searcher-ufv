Mr money man I know youve had your way  
And I know the way youre winning  
And that bloody hand youre holding  
Aint no bargain at the price you had to pay  
You have stolen all the land that you can steal  
And you killed so many heroes  
But the dreams they left behind them  
Aint as easy as a man to blow away  
Chorus  
And they say el mal sacate ni el fuego lo quema  
And los mexicanos dicen cosa mala nunca muere  
Dont you know   
The fire dont burn a bad weed boy  
And a bad thing never dies  
Like the bad weeds growing wild around  
The broken wounded body of el salvador  
They killed so many heroes  
Like zapata presente and fonseca presente  
And sandino presente and guevarra presente  
And allende presente and aquino presente  
And steve biko presente  
But they can never kill the human spirit  
Not in nicaragua   
Chorus  
And they say el mal sacate ni el fuego lo quema  
And los mexicanos dicen cosa mala nunca muere  
Dont you know   
Aiiiiiaiiiaiiiiii nicaragua   
Aiiiiiaiiiaiiiiii sandinista
