Gonna cut through the dark like a buzzsaw  
Seen a light gonna live by a new law  
Got a gift of grace  
From the Ancient of Days  
Gonna cut through the dark like a buzzsaw  
Law of love gift of faith and a hope sure  
Now I fight the one  
Who opposes Gods Son  
  
You come agains me with  
A sword a lying myth  
I come to you in the Name of the Lord  
For Hes the Lord of Hosts  
The God of Israel  
And it is Him who you have defiled  
  
Darkness flee  
Im a child born of the Cross  
The warrior in me  
Fights to save what which was lost  
Demons flee  
At the sound of His Holy Name  
Set the captives free  
Like a buzzsaw through a wall of flame
