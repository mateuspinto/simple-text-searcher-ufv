We held hands and laughed  
Then we jumped in the water  
Off the jetty wed fly  
As the sun got hotter  
We were any age  
Floating through space  
Happy for once in the human race  
On this sweet Sunday and into Monday  
Your arms wrapped around me  
Where my love has found me  
But am I really free  
If I could read your mind  
I hope Id find  
The same love I have in mine  
If I could go back in time  
Id try to find you  
And make up for all this wasted time  
Like a broken record  
Ive stayed protected  
From promises from disappointments  
I wanna hear your dreams wanna drift away  
Wanna break you in  
Oh I wanna stay  
Stay in heaven oh in heaven  
And see my life finally begin  
Will we be together oh forever  
Darling please let me in  
If I could read your mind  
I hope Id find  
The same love I have in mine  
If I could go back in time  
Id try to find you  
And make up for all this wasted time  
Oh I want to stay in this sweet Sunday and into Monday  
Your arms wrapped around me  
Where my love has found me  
Has finally found me  
But am I really free  
If I could read your mind  
I hope Id find  
The same love I have in mine  
If I could go back in time  
Id try to find you  
And make up for all this wasted time  
Na na na  na na  
If I could read your mind  
Na na na na na
