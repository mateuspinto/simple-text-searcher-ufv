Music by antonio carlos jobim words by vinicius demoraes translated by
norman gimbel  
How insensitive  
I must have seemed  
When she told me that she loved me  
How unnerved and cold  
I must have seemed  
When she told me so sincerely  
Why she must have asked  
Did I just turn and stare in icy silence  
What was I to say  
What can you say  
When a love affair is over  
Why she must have asked  
Did I just turn and stare in icy silence  
What was I to say  
What can you say  
When a love affair is over  
So now shes gone away  
And Im alone  
With a memory of her last look  
Vague and drawn and sad  
I see it still  
All the heartbreak in her last look  
How she must have asked  
Could I just turn and stare in icy silence  
What was I to do  
What can one do  
When a love affair is over
