People have round shoulders from fairing heavy loads  
And the soldiers liberate them laying mines along their roads  
Sorrow paid for valor is too much to recall  
Of the countless corpses piled up along the wailing wall  
  
Melting down all metals turning plows and shears to swords  
Shun words of the Bible we need implements of war  
Chalklines and red puddles of those who have been slain  
Destiny that crooked schemer says the dead shall rise again  
  
Where do we go from here  
And should we really care  
The end is finally here  
God have mercy  
  
Now weve rewritten history  
The one thing weve found out  
Sweet taste of vindication  
It turns to ashes in your mouth  
  
Where do we go from here  
And should we really care  
The end is finally here  
God have mercy  
  
If youre fighting to live  
Its okay to die  
The answer to your question is  
Welcome to tomorrow  
  
Where do we go from here  
God have mercy  
  
Where do we go from here  
And should we really care  
The end is finally here  
God have mercy
