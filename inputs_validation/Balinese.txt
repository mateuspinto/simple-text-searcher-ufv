Deep in the South of Texas  
Not so long ago  
There on a crowded island  
In the Gulf of Mexico  
  
It didnt take too much money  
Man but it sure was nice  
You could dance all night if you felt all right  
Drinking whiskey and throwing dice  
  
And everybody knows  
It was hard to leave  
And everybody knows  
It was down at the Balinese  
  
Yeah I remember Ruby  
She always dressed in red  
Wearing skintight pants Lord and how she could dance  
With a rag wrapped around her head  
  
And everybody knows  
It was hard to leave  
And everybody knows  
It was down at the Balinese  
  
And everybody knows  
It was hard to leave  
And everybody knows  
It was down at the Balinese  
It was down at the Balinese  
It was down at the Balinese
