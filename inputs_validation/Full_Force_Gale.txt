Like a full force gale  
I was lifted up again  
I was lifted up again by the Lord  
  
And no matter where I roam  
I will find my way back home  
I will always return to the Lord  
  
In the gentle evening breeze  
By the whispering shady trees  
I will find my sanctuary in the Lord  
  
I was headed for a fall  
The I looked up and saw the writing on the wall  
  
Like a full force gale  
I was lifted up again  
I was lifted up again by the Lord  
  
I was headed for a fall  
The I looked up and saw the writing on the wall  
  
In the gentle evening breeze  
By the whispering shady trees  
I will find my sanctuary in the Lord  
  
And no matter where I roam  
I will find my way back home  
I will always return to the Lord  
  
Like a full force gale  
I was lifted up again  
I was lifted up again by the Lord
