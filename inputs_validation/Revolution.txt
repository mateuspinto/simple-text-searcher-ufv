Now the end begins  
World is dying from within  
Game is still the same  
Different players  
Fuel the flames  
  
Now is the time to shed our skin  
And we must repent our sins  
  
Revolution  
Revolution  
  
Brewing much too long  
New age dawns  
Its a phenomenon  
Calm before the storm  
Our spirits must be free to roam  
  
Out of chaos we will rise  
No time for compromise no  
  
Revolution  
Revolution  
  
In this relentless quest  
Theres no time to lose  
We must pass the test  
We will wield this power  
To win this battle  
In our finest hour  
  
Then your death will be glorious  
As we stand victorious  
  
Revolution  
Revolution  
  
Revolution  
Revolution  
Revolution  
Revolution
