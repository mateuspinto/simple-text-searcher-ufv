Hoverin by my suitcase tryin to find a warm place to spend the night  
Heavy rain fallin seems I hear your voice callin Its all right  
A rainy night in Georgia a rainy night in Georgia  
It seems like its rainin all over the world  
I feel like its rainin all over the world  
  
Neon signs aflashin taxi cabs and buses passin through the night  
A distant moanin of a train seems to play a sad refrain to the night  
A rainy night in Georgia such a rainy night in Georgia  
Lord I believe its rainin all over the world  
I feel like its rainin all over the world  
  
How many times I wondered  
It still comes out the same  
No matter how you look at it or think of it  
Its life and you just got to play the game  
  
I find me a place in a box car so I take my guitar to pass some time  
Late at night when its hard to rest I hold your picture to my chest and I
feel fine  
minor scat But its a rainy night in Georgia baby its a rainy night in
Georgia I  
Feel its rainin all over the world kinda lonely now And its rainin all
over the  
World  
  
Oh have you ever been lonely people  
And you feel that it was rainin all over this mans world  
Youre talking bout rainin rainin rainin rainin rainin rainin
rainin  
Rainin rainin rainin rainin rainin
