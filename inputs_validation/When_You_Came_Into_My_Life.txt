You give me your smile  
A piece of your heart  
You give me the feel Ive been looking for  
You give me your soul  
Your innocent love  
You are the one Ive been waiting for  
Ive been waiting for  
  
Were lost in a kiss  
A moment in time  
Forever young  
Just forever just forever in love  
  
When you came into my life  
It took my breath away  
Cause your love has found its way  
To my heart  
  
Ooh ah  
Ooh ah  
  
You make me dream  
By the look in your eyes  
You give me the feel Ive been longing for  
I wanna give you my soul  
All my life  
Cause you are the one Ive been waiting for  
Ive been waiting for so long  
  
When you came into my life  
It took my breath away  
And the world stopped turnin round  
For your love  
When you came into my life  
It took my breath away  
Cause your love has found its way  
To my heart  
Into my heart  
  
Just forever in love  
  
When you came into my life  
It took my breath away  
And the world stopped turnin round  
For your love  
When you came into my life  
It took my breath away  
Cause your love has found its way  
To my heart  
When you came into my life  
  
When you came into my life  
It took my breath away  
And the world stopped turnin round  
For your love  
When you came into my life  
It took my breath away  
Cause your love has found its way  
To my heart
