If they gave Olympic medals  
For rocking all night long  
I would have won em all till I turned pro  
I had years of dedication  
And a natural inclination  
And a childhood game I just could not outgrow  
  
I want to be the last man standing  
People crashing on the sofas and passed out on the floor  
But the last man standing  
Was saying bring on a little bit more  
  
When you stop and think about it  
Life is still just high school  
You make the same mistakes you did when you were young  
Contending for the ladies favors  
Tasting every single flavor  
While hopelessly trying not to scald your tongue  
  
I want to be the last man standing  
People crashing on the sofas and passed out on the floor  
But the last man standing  
Was saying bring on a little bit more  
  
I might as well admit it  
Theres been a time or two  
When I contemplated retiring for a while  
But a hundred years from now  
Theyll still be asking how  
As they gaze upon my taxidermic smile  
  
Want to be the last man standing  
Got the devil at the crossroads wolf at the door  
But the last man standing  
Is singing bring on a little bit more  
  
Theyre gonna see the last man standing  
Still got a fun ticket in my hand  
Gonna be the last man standing  
Taking off before I land
