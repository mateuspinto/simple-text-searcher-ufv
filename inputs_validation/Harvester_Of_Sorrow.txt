My life suffocates  
Planting seeds of hate  
Ive loved turned to hate  
Trapped far beyond my fate  
I give  
You take  
This life that I forsake  
Been cheated of my youth  
You turned this lie to truth  
  
Anger  
Misery  
Youll suffer unto me  
  
Harvester of sorrow  
Language of the mad  
Harvester of sorrow  
  
Pure black looking clear  
My work is done soon here  
Try getting back to me  
Get back which used to be  
Drink up  
Shoot in  
Let the beatings begin  
Distributor of pain  
Your loss becomes my gain  
  
Anger  
Misery  
Youll suffer unto me  
  
Harvester of sorrow  
Language of the mad  
Harvester of sorrow  
  
All have said their prayers  
Invade their nightmares  
See into my eyes  
Youll find where murder lies  
  
Infanticide  
  
Harvester of sorrow  
Language of the mad  
Harvester of sorrow  
Language of the mad  
Harvester of sorrow
