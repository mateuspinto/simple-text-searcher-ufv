Out in cucamonga  
Many years ago  
Near a holy roller church  
There was once a place  
Where me and a couple of friends  
Began practicing for the time  
We might go on tv  
And as fate would have it  
Later on we got a chance to play  
All we ever really knew  
That it was crazy nanook nono  
To be doin it any other way
