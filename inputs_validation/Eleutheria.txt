My life is perfect  
Because I accept it as it is  
The sunshine is shining  
Because it is what it is  
  
What a beautiful feeling its bringing  
All the birds in the sky are singing  
  
Eleutheria the fire is burning  
Eleutheria the tables are turning  
  
A new day is dawning  
Because it is time for a change  
With new consciousness forming  
There comes a new day  
  
Oh we got to got to keep on trying  
When the children are cold and alone  
And are crying  
You got to understand  
  
Eleutheria the bells are ringing  
Eleutheria the people are singing  
Eleutheria the people are yearning  
Eleutheria this world keeps on turning  
Turning  
  
What a beutiful feeling  
Its bringing  
All the birds in the sky are singing  
You got to understand  
  
Eleutheria the fire is burning  
Eleutheria the tables are turning  
Eleutheria the bells are ringing  
The people keep singing  
  
The fire is burning  
The tables are turning  
Got to keep on  
Keep on keeping on
