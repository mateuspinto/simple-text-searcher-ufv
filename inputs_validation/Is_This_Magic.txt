Is it the voice of the whispering sea  
Or is it the way were dancing  
Is it the way that the moon  
Hits your eyes  
Or is this magic  
Or is this magic  
Is it the way that you sway  
In my arms  
Or is it the soft winds blowing  
Is it the music that carries us off  
Or is this magic  
Or is this magic  
Close your eyes and drink in  
The sweet sad guitar  
Close your eyes and drift to  
The beat of the moon and the stars  
Is it the rush of the surf  
That I hear  
Or only our mad hearts beating  
Will this be only a fleeting affair  
Or is this magic  
Or is this magic  
Close your eyes and drink in  
The sweet sad guitar  
Close your eyes and drift to  
The beat of the moon and the stars  
Is it the voice of the whispering sea  
Or is it the way were dancing  
Will this be only a fleeting affair  
Or is this magic
