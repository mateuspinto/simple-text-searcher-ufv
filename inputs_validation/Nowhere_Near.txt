Do you know how I feel  
How I feel about you  
Do you know this is real  
How I feel around you  
When I see you look at me  
Im not sure of anything  
All I know is when you smile  
I believe in everything  
Do you know how I dream  
How I dream about you  
Do you know how I feel  
Do you know  
Do you know how I feel  
How I feel about you  
Doesnt take much to tell  
That I love oh I  
Everyone is here but youre nowhere near
