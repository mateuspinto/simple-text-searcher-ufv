Long ago for many years  
White men came in the name of God  
They took their land they took their lives  
A new age has just begun  
  
They lost their Gods they lost their smile  
They cried for help for the last time  
Liberty was turning into chains  
But all the white men said  
Thats the cross of changes  
  
In the name of God the fight for gold  
These were the changes  
Tell me is it right in the name of God  
These kind of changes   
  
They tried to fight for liberty  
Without a chance in hell they gave up  
White men won in the name of God  
With the cross as alibi  
  
Theres no God who ever tried  
To change the world in this way  
For the ones who abuse his name  
Therell be no chance to escape  
On judgment day  
  
In the name of God the fight for gold  
These were the changes  
Tell me is it right in the name of God  
These kind of changes   
  
Tell me why tell me why tell why  
The white men said  
Thats the cross of changes   
  
Tell me why tell me why tell why  
In the name of God  
These kind of changes
