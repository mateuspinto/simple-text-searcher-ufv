All the leaves are brown  
And the sky is grey  
I went for a walk  
On a winters day  
Id be safe and warm  
If I was in L A  
California dreamin  
On such a winters day  
  
I stopped into a church stopped into a church  
I passed along the way passed along the way  
You know I got down on my knees got down on my knees  
And I pretend to pray I pretend to pray  
Oh the preacher likes the cold preacher likes the cold  
He knows Im gonna stay knows Im gonna stay  
Oh california dreamin california dreamin  
On such a winters day  
  
All the leaves are brown the leaves are brown  
And the sky is grey and the sky is grey  
I went for a walk I went for a walk  
On a winters day on a winters day  
If I didnt tell her if I didnt tell her  
I could leave today I could leave today  
  
Oh california dreamin california dreamin  
On such a winters day california dreamin  
On such a winters day california dreamin  
On such a winters day california dreamin  
On such a winters day
