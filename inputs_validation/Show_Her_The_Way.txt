You cant deny it  
When that once in your life  
Comes that one of a kind  
  
Once shes inside it  
She can shake up your heart  
She can make up your mind  
  
Everything in your life will change  
When your love is your best friend  
My advice to you is make no mistake  
If ya never want this feelin to end  
  
Chorus  
Show her the way she makes you love her  
Show her the way she makes you feel  
Let your emotions roll like thunder  
You gotta let her know  
Youll never let her go  
Show her the way  
  
Now love is for dreamers  
Funny thing about dreams  
Any moment theyre gone  
And love is the teacher  
About makin it last about keepin it strong  
  
Promise the moon and stars  
Swear the best is yet to come  
But promises are not what it takes  
To keep the flame forever young  
  
All you really need to show  
Is everything she needs to know  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Show her gotta show her just show her the wayX3  
Show her the way
