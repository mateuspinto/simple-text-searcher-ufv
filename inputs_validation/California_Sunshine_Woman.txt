California woman  
Hanging heavy on my mind  
Never found another like her  
Guess she was just one of a kind  
She never wrapped no strings around me  
She could treat a man so fine  
I still see her golden hair  
And the Caliifornia sunshine  
Mississippi rain falling on my head  
No California woman sleeping in my bed  
Makes me wanna move on leave all this behind  
I need my California woman and the California sunshine  
Golden California beaches  
Knocking on a beach house door  
They say that California woman  
She dont live here anymore  
They say she left with a stranger  
Leaving nothing left behind  
She buried all my dreams here  
In the California sunshine  
Mississippi rain falling on my head  
No California woman sleeping in my bed  
Makes me wanna move on leave all this behind  
I need my California woman and the California sunshine  
I need my California woman and the California sunshine
