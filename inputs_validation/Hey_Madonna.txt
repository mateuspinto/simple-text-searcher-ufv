Ive got a madonnaIve got a big black shiny maddona  
Maybe tonight we could go for a ride  
Out on the road  
Out on the wide wide open road  
Baby lets see what we can find  
Alright

Lets drive  
Anywhere you wanna go i will take you there babe take you there baby  
Yeah lets drive  
Anywhere your dreams go i will take you there take you there baby  
Lets drive  
  
I got a ride  
Ive got a smooth slick shiny ride  
Lets open her up and lets get away  
Back out by the shore  
Top down seats back  
Lights shinning low  
Tonights the night we go all the way  
All the way  
  
Chorus  
  
Everything that you wanna find  
Is waiting for you here inside  
Lets drive  
  
Ive got a car  
Ive got a big black shiny car  
Maybe tonight we can go for a ride
