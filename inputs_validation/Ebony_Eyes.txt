Shes a Miss Beautiful Supreme  
A girl that others wish that they could be  
If theres seven wonders of the world  
Then I know shes gotta be number one  
Shes a girl that cant be beat  
Born and raised on ghetto streets  
Shes a devastating beauty  
A pretty girl with ebony eyes  
  
Shes the sunflower of natures seeds  
A girls that some men only find in their dreams  
When she smiles it seems the stars all know  
Cause one by one they start to light up the sky

Born and raised on ghetto streets  
Shes a devastating beauty  
A pretty girl with ebony eyes

When she starts talking soft and sweet  
Like birds of spring her words all seem to sing  
With a rhythm that is made of love  
And the happiness that she only brings  
Shes a girl that cant be beat  
Born and raised on ghetto streets  
Shes a devastating beauty  
A pretty girl with ebony eyes
