Oh it seems the sun will never shine  
The skies are so gray and the heart you left broken is lonely  
The winter wind blows through the trees and with the song I sing  
I long for the days you loved me only  
  
Sorrow lingers shadows only fill the empty room  
Nights of lonely cries unheard  
In the winter of a broken heart  
  
Oh the nights will never be the same as when the love was new  
Young hearts so tender in their yearning  
But seasons change and lovers too  
And winters twice as cold  
But the fire in one heart is always burning  
  
Sorrow lingers shadows only fill the empty room  
Nights of lonely cries unheard  
In the winter of a broken heart  
  
Though a million hours pass the time and lonely is the pain  
And what was love is just a spell thats broken  
So blow the wind and freeze the rain and try like lovers do  
Seems our hearts have never really spoken  
  
Sorrow lingers shadows only fill the empty room  
Nights of lonely cries unheard  
In the winter of a broken heart
