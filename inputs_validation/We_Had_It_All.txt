I can hear the wind a blowin in my mind  
Just the way it used to sound through the Georgia pines  
You were there to answer when I called yeah  
You and me we had it all  
  
Remember how I used to touch your hands  
While reachin for the feeling that was always there  
Youre the best thing in my life I can recall oh  
You and me we had it all  
  
I know that we can never lives these times again  
So Ill let these dreams take me back to where weve been  
Then I stay there with you just as long as I can  
  
Oh it was so good yeah it was so good  
Oh it was so good when I was your man  
And I never stop believin your smile  
Even though it didnt stay it was all worthwhile  
  
Yes youre the best thing in my life I can recall oh  
You and me we had it all  
You and me we had it all
