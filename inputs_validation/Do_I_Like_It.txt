I was alone and fancy free  
Enjoying all my liberty  
  
I met you baby  
Then things changed  
I started acting  
Oh so strange  
  
Do I like it do I like it  
Yes I do  
  
Well every day I had a ball  
I didnt have a care at all  
And everything was just okay  
Until you made me change my way  
  
Do I like it do I like it  
Yes I do  
  
Like a schoolboy  
Loves his cherry pie  
You really move me  
My oh my  
  
You caught me baby  
Im really hooked  
No doubt about it  
My goose is cooked  
  
It wont be long before I hear  
Her whisper softly in my ear  
I love you baby yes I do  
And from now on  
Its me and you  
  
Do I like it do I like it  
Yes I do  
  
Like a schoolboy  
Loves his cherry pie  
You really move me  
My oh my  
  
You caught me baby  
Im really hooked  
No doubt about it  
My goose is cooked  
  
It wont be long before I hear  
Her whisper softly in my ear  
I love you baby yes I do  
And from now on  
Its me and you  
  
Do I like it do I like it  
Yes I do
