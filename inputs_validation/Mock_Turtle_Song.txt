Will you walk a little faster said a whiting to a snail  
Theres a porpoise close behind us and hes treading on my tail  
Dont you see how eagerly the turtles and the lobsters all advance  
They are waiting on the shingle wont you come and join the dance  
Will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the dance  
3x  
You can really have no notion how delightful it will be  
When they take us up and throw us with the lobsters in the sea  
But the snail replied Too far too far and gave a look askance  
Said he thanked the whiting kindly but he would not join the dance  
Would not could not would not could not would not join the dance  
Chorus  
2x  
Ba ba ba ba ba ba etc continuous background to end  
What matters it how far we go his scaly friend replied  
There is another shore you know upon the other side  
The further off from England the nearer is to France  
Then turn not pale beloved snail but come and join the dance  
Chorus
