Absence makes the heart go mad  
All the solid things become mirages  
The certain things  
Sand running in the hour glass  
Running away  
I scream along the ledge  
As the windows back and close  
I run around try to prove the sunrise  
I believe in belief  
But its proof I need  
Can you show me its me  
Can you show me its me  
Travelling makes the mind go vague  
All the special faces fade away  
Spinning like a heat haze  
Shimmering  
Please send Polaroids  
Or an ear in the post  
A map to the treasure  
A key to the closed  
I need you like hell  
Can you help me again  
Can you show me its me  
Can you show me its me  
I run dry  
I run out  
I run cold  
I need help  
Trying to prove the sunrise  
Trying to prove the tides  
Trying to prove the blue moon sky  
And is it you  
Is it you
