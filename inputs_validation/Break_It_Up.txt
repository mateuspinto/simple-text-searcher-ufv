Car stopped in a clearing  
Ribbon of life it was nearing  
I saw the boy break out of his skin  
My heart turned over and I crawled in  
He cried break it up oh I dont understand  
Break it up I cant comprehend  
Break it up oh I want to feel you  
Break it up dont talk to me that way  
Im not listening  
Snow started falling  
I could hear the angel calling  
We rolled on the ground he stretched out his wings  
The boy flew away and he started to sing  
He sang break it up oh I dont understand  
Break it up I cant comprehend  
Break it up oh I want to feel you  
Break it up dont look at me  
  
The sky was raging the boy disappeared  
I fell on my knee  
Atmosphere broke up the boy reappeared  
I cried take me please  
  
Ice it was shining  
I could feel my heart it was melting  
I tore off my clothes I danced on my shoes  
I ripped my skin open and then I broke through  
I cried break it up oh now I understand  
Break it up and I want to go  
Break it up oh please take me with you  
Break it up I can feel it breaking  
I can feel it breaking I can feel it breaking  
I can feel I can feel I can feel I can feel  
  
So break it up oh now Im coming with you  
Break it up now Im gonna go  
Break it up oh feel me Im coming  
Break it up break it up break it up  
Break it up break it up break it up  
Oh break it up break it up break it up  
Break it up break it up break it on up  
Break it up break it on up up up  
Break it break it break it break it  
Break it on up break it up  
Break it up break it up break it up
