It would be easier to take the wet from water or the dry from sand  
Than for anyone to try to separate us or stop us from holding hands cause  
  
Chorus   
I love you I love you from the bottom of my heart  
And what love has joined together what love has joined together  
Can nobody take it apart  
  
It would be easier to take the cold from the snow or the heat from fire  
Than for anyone to take me love from you cause youre my hearts desire
and  
  
Chorus  
  
Even if they separate us 1000 miles apart  
We will still be together in each others hearts  
It would be easier to change all the seasons of the year  
Than for anyone to change the way I feel about you I love you dear  
  
Chorus  
  
What love has joined together  
What love has joined together
