Oh my mama told me  
Cause she say she learned the hard way  
Say she want to spare the children  
She say dont give or sell your soul away  
Cause all that you have is your soul  
  
Dont be tempted by the shiny apple  
Dont you eat of a bitter fruit  
Hunger only for a taste of justice  
Hunger only for a world of truth  
Cause all that you have is your soul  
  
I was a pretty young girl once  
I had dreams I had high hopes  
I married a man he stole my heart away  
He gave his love but what a high price I paid  
And all that you have is your soul  
  
Why was I such a young fool  
Thought Id make history  
Making babies was the best I could do  
Thought Id made something that could be mine forever  
Found out the hard way one cant possess another  
And all that you have is your soul  
  
I thought thought that I could find a way  
To beat the system  
To make a deal and have no debts to pay  
Id take it all take it all Id run away  
Me for myself first class and first rate  
But all that you have is your soul  
  
Here I am waiting for a better day  
A second chance  
A little luck to come my way  
A hope to dream a hope that I can sleep again  
And wake in the world with a clear conscience and clean hands  
Cause all that you have is your soul  
  
All that you have  
All that you have  
All that you have  
Is your soul
