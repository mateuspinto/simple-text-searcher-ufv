Because I was afraid to speak when I was just a lad  
My father gave my nose a tweak and told me I was bad  
Then one day I learned a word that saved my achin nose  
The biggest word you ever heard and this is how it goes  
Oh supercalifragilisticexpialidocious  
Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious  
If you say it loud enough youll always sound precocious  
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious  
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay  
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay  
Ive traveled all around the world and everywhere I went  
Id use my word and all would say There goes a clever gent  
But when Dukes and maharajahs pass the time of day with me  
I say my special word and then they ask me out to tea  
Oh supercalifragilisticexpialidocious  
Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious  
If you say it loud enough youll always sound precocious  
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious  
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay  
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay  
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay  
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay  
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay  
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay  
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay  
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay  
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay  
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay  
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay  
Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay  
So when the cat has got your tongue theres no need for dismay  
Just summon up this word and then youve got a lot to say  
But better use it carefully or it can change your life  
One night I said it to my girl and now my girls my wife  
Oh supercalifragilisticexpialidocious  
Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious  
If you say it loud enough youll always sound precocious  
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
