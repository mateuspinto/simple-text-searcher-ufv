Applicant I am  
Clean young flesh  
Cubicles we merge  
And me so decent  
  
Lock up my vehicle  
Crack my walls  
Im stealing new words  
And me so honest  
  
Someone took pictures  
Just look at her go  
Her presence exhausted me  
Like spectators we are  
  
I have no address  
Who are you  
Kiss my arse goodbye  
The show goes rusty  
  
Simulate phone call  
Face to face  
Newspaper loose talk  
You wreck my dreams  
  
Exhibit A dog  
So few of them left  
Exhibit be god  
The problem of death  
  
Old sex unclean  
Do you still need the moon  
Recall no names  
Dont ask me how are you  
  
Wheres my attendant  
And where is my wife  
Wait in the doorway  
While I say goodnight  
  
He looks like me
