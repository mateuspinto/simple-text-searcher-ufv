I was born broke  
I be dam if I will ie that way  
I love my momma  
Cant deny that phase  
Every night I pray for a rap record deal  
Man even some times twise I say  
Lord save me take me away from hell  
14 to 9 and Ive been sellin yay for years  
Y we had a house and couldnt keep it  
Y I got more pink slips than victoria secret  
Y I gotta rob  
Y my pappi aint got a job  
Y I aint gradguate  
Y throught school I aint have a date  
Y I hade to masterbate
