Smoky autumn night stars up in the sky  
I see the sailin boats across the bay go by  
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street  
And then I turn my head for youre approachin me  
Moonlight on the water fishermans daughter floatin in to my room  
With a golden loom  
  
First we wash our feet near the immortal shrine  
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine  
I see the hungry clouds up above your face  
And then the tears roll down what a bitter taste  
And then you drift away on a summers day where the wildflowers bloom  
With your golden loom  
  
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light  
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night  
I see the trembling lion with the lotus flower tail  
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil  
But youre gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume  
And your golden loom
