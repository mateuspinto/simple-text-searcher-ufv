Who the hell are you to tell me  
What to do why to do why bother  
Leech in a mask of virtue  
Such waste to ever think of you again  
  
Hey Judas your Christess was our love  
Hit and run your will be done  
Never sorry never wrong  
More more more more more  
  
Master passion greed  
  
Hello How are you  
Let me explain one thing  
All for her and more for me  
Why is it so hard to see  
I see no sense in doing this  
Not enough for me  
I fuck up everything but let me explain  
  
Some day you shall flee  
Panting and weak  
  
Master passion greed  
  
All within me gone but pain and hope  
Hoping that the pain would fade away  
  
Greed your master passion  
I Feed the mouth that bites me  
Mammon opiate of the masses  
The reek of your lies draws flies  
  
Seek her  
Seduce her  
Tame her  
Blame her  
Have her  
Kill her  
Feast on it all  
  
With awakening the tears will begin  
To my everlasting shame silence took me
