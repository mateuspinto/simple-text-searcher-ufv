Jesus Jesus one touch of Your hand  
I am healed and I am whole  
Jesus Jesus one glimpse of Your face  
Brings fire to my soul  
  
And Jesus I come beholding Your face  
I am changed from glory to glory  
And now I see and now I know  
One touch of Your life  
Brings glory to my soul  
  
Jesus Jesus from darkness to light  
My life overflows  
Jesus Jesus Your mercy and grace  
Like a river flowing down  
  
And Jesus I come beholding Your face  
I am changed from glory to glory  
And now I see and now I know  
One touch of Your life  
Brings glory to my soul  
  
And Jesus I come beholding Your face  
I am changed from glory to glory  
And now I see and now I know  
One touch of Your life  
Brings glory to my soul  
  
And now I see and now I know  
One touch of Your life  
Brings glory to my soul  
And now I see and now I know  
One touch of Your life  
Brings glory to my soul  
  
Jesus Jesus  
Jesus Jesus  
Jesus Jesus  
Jesus Jesus
