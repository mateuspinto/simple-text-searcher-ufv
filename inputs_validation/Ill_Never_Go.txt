You always ask me  
Those words i say  
And telling me what it means to me  
  
Every single day  
You always act this way  
For how many times i told you  
I love you  
For this is all i know  
  
Come to me and hold me  
And you will see  
The love i give  
For you still hold the key  
  
Every single day  
You always act this way  
For how many times i told you  
I love you  
For this is all i know  
  
Chorus  
  
Ill never go far away from you  
Even the sky will tell you  
That i need you so  
For this is all i know  
Ill never go far away from you  
  
Come to me and hold me  
And you will see  
The love i give  
For you still hold the key  
  
Every single day  
You always act this way  
For how many times i told you  
I love you  
For this is all i know  
  
Ill never go  
  
Ill never go away
