Oh no matter where you are youll be my lucky star  
Oh every night everyday babe what can I say oh  
I love the way you smile I hate to waft a while  
Oh every night everyday tell me theres a way  
And I swear to you baby I swear to you  
Oh hey you oh baby  
Hey you drive me crazy  
  
Who will love you like I do  
Who will make your dreams come true  
Keep shining keep smiling baby  
Who will love you everyday and night  
Who will kiss you in the morning light  
Keep shining keep smiling baby  
  
Oh no matter what I do oh I do it just for you  
Oh every night everyday baby if you stay oh  
Maybe Im wrong tonight but maybe Im so right  
Oh every night everyday come hear me pray  
Oh I swear to you baby I swear to you  
Hey you oh baby  
Hey you drive me crazy
