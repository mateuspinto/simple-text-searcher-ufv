Childproof to the letter  
You know the truth you know better  
The girl on the pavement  
Shes spinning  
Dont be long come and get her  
I need a drink so just forget her  
Time just slips through my fingers  
Hold onto life  
Hold on despite this  
Ive seen your eyes shine  
Just get through the night this time  
Resolve is weak I abuse it  
You turn your cheek then Ill loose it  
Life just slips through my fingers  
I blame him and I hurt him  
Turn the screw rub the dirt in  
Theres dirt under my fingers  
Hold onto life  
Hold on despite this  
Ive seen your eyes shine  
Just get through the night this time  
Just get through the night this time  
I wanted it and I cant get  
It was heaven sent so I spent it  
The sky just slipped through my fingers  
One more round for the lady  
As I hit the ground whisper maybe  
I will get on my feet again  
Not open to your suggestions  
Ill change the locks wont answer questions  
I will get on my feet again  
Hold onto life  
Hold on despite this  
Ive seen your eyes shine  
Just get through the night this time  
Just get through the night this time  
Just get through the night this time
