Army Officer from beyond the barricade  
You at the barricade listen to this  
The people of Paris sleep in their beds  
You have no chance  
No chance at all  
Why throw your lives away  
  
Enjolras  
Let us die facing our foes  
Make them bleed while we can  
  
Combeferre  
Make em pay through the nose  
  
Courfeyrac  
Make em pay for every man  
  
Enjolras  
Let others rise  
To take our place  
Until the earth is free  
  
Amidst increasingly heavy gunfire Marius is shot Enjolras is killed at the
summit of the barricade All at the barricade are killed except Marius who
is wounded and unconscious and Valjean Valjean discovers that Marius is
still alive and carries him down into the sewers to escape Javert climbs over
the barricade looking for Valjeans body Not finding it he realizes that
Valjean must be in the sewers so he goes off to where he must emerge
