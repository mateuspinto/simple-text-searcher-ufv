We were so young we were too vain  
Dance in the dark sing in the rain  
Time on our hands hope in our hearts  
  
We were talking passing strangers  
Moments caught across an empty room  
Wasted whispers faded secrets  
Quickly passes time goes time goes by too soon  
  
We stood alone silent and proud  
Moments unknown lost in a crowd  
Running through memories like thieves in the night  
Clutching emotions holding too tight  
Hold turns to dust shattered by light  
  
We were talking passing strangers  
Moments caught across an empty room  
Wasted whispers faded secrets  
Quickly passes time goes time goes by too soon  
  
We were talking passing strangers  
Moments caught across an empty room  
Wasted whispers faded secrets  
Quickly passes time goes time goes by too soon  
  
We were talking passing strangers  
Moments caught across an empty room  
Wasted whispers faded secrets  
Quickly passes time goes time goes by too soon
