Ive been quiet for way too long  
Its time to make a sound  
Its time to let it all out  
In my heart is a rising song  
A song of victory  
Of all Youve done for me  
What can I say You blow me away  
Throwing off restraint  
Ill praise You recklessly  
Coz I want the world to see  
I want the world to see Your glory  
Fill me up so much that You  
Bust out of me  
Coz I want the world to see  
I want the world to see Your glory
