The future is around me  
Im not gonna cry for the things that never occurred  
So do not remind me  
Happy to be as I was in the first place  
  
Honey you know where to find me  
Honey you know where to find me  
Kicking away from the mundane everyday  
La la la la la la  
  
The envy is beyond me  
Im not gonna pine for the things that can never be mine  
Do not expect me to  
Im happy to be who I was in the first place  
  
Honey you know where to find me  
Honey you know where to find me  
Kicking away from the mundane everyday  
La la la la la la  
  
The future is around me  
I see it I seize it I use it I throw it away  
Because Im happy to be like I was in the first place  
  
Honey you know where to find me  
Honey you know where to find me  
Running away from the mundane  
La la la la la la  
  
Oh honey you know where to find me  
Honey you know where to find me  
Honey youll find how to know me  
Oh la la la la la la  
  
Oh honey you know how the land lies  
La la la la la la la la la
