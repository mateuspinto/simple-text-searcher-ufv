I hear you breathe so far from here  
I feel your touch so close and real  
  
And I know my church is not of silver and gold  
Its glory lies beyond judgment of souls  
The commandments are of consolation and warmth  
  
You know our sacred dream wont fail  
The sanctuary tender and so frail  
The sacrament of love  
The sacrament of warmth is true  
The sacrament is you  
  
I hear you weep so far from here  
I taste your tears like youre next to me  
  
And I know my weak prayers are not enough to heal  
The ancient wounds so deep and so dear  
The revelation is of hatred and fear
