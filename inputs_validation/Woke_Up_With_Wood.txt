When I woke up this morning  
I was feeling mighty good  
My baby understood had to do what she should  
Lying near a pile of wood  
Laying it on some  
Playing with it some  
When I I woke up with wood  
  
I was lying there thinking bout basketball  
Trying not to lose my mind  
My baby came to help and I let out a yell  
She grabbed me from behind  
Laying on it some  
Playing with it some  
When I I woke up with wood  
  
Beauty queens fall in trances  
Debutantes lose their furs  
But it felt so good from where they stood  
They were working on a pile of wood  
Laying on it some  
Playing with it some  
When I I woke up with wood
