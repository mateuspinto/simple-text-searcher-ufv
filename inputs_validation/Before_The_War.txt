Come take a look up  
To the constelations  
Take the book of god  
You will find your relations  
If you understand  
You will know the solution  
Things will fall back  
To the new constitution  
  
Im a son of a distant future  
Im the last of the seven troopers  
And I came here for the 7th war  
  
Im a child of the stars  
The blaster of the gods  
  
And I have seen it all before  
Before the war  
Cold hearted earth  
Im the master of the universe  
And I have seen it all before  
Before the war  
  
Nature sets a limit to  
Your millenary  
Turning every place into  
A cruel mean scenary  
All will get a chance to shun  
The holy fire  
But you will be few getting  
Under the wire  
  
Im a son of a distant future  
Im the last of the seven troopers  
And I came here for  
The 7th war  
  
Im a child of the stars  
The blaster of the gods  
And I have seen it all before  
Before the war  
Cold hearted earth  
Im the master of the universe  
And I have seen it all before  
Before the war  
  
Mind the 7th war mind the 7th war  
Yes I came here for the 7th war  
  
Im a child of the stars  
The blaster os the gods  
And I have seen it all before  
Before the war  
Cold hearted earth  
Im the master of the universe  
And I have seen it all before  
Before the war
