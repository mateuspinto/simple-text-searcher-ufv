Sun tan toes ticklin the sand  
Cold drink chillin in my right hand  
Watchin you sleep in the evening light  
Restin up for a long long night  
  
Chorus  
Cause when the sun goes down well be groovin  
When the sun goes down well be feelin alright  
When the sun sinks down over the water  
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down  
  
All day long just taking it easy  
Laying in a hammock where its nice and breezy  
Been sleepin off the night before cause when the sun goes down  
Well be back for more  
  
Chorus  
  
This old guitarand my dark sunglasses  
This sweet concoction is as smooth as molasses  
Nothing to do but breath all day  
Until the big moon rises and its time to play  
  
Chorus Repeat 3X  
  
When the sun goes down well be groovin  
When the sun goes down well be feelin alright  
When the sun sinks down over the water  
She thinks crackers sexy when the sun goes down
