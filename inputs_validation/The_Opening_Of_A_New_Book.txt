The opening of a new book  
A singular wave crashing  
The opening of a new book  
Sat on your chuff knowing nothing  
The opening of a new book  
A ticket on a train from nowhere to somewhere  
The opening of a new book  
Are you Elephant Man or George Michael  
The opening of a new book  
A sip a swig a gulp a mouthful a session a bender a life  
The opening of a new book  
Does this personality have any brakes  
The opening of a new book  
Does anyone know who oils the brakes  
Are you supposed to oil them yourself  
  
Can you whisky Can you gin  
Can you speed without brakes  
Are you cancelled Are you taken  
  
Can you whisky Can you gin  
Can you speed without brakes  
Can anyone repair me  
  
Can you whisky Can you gin  
Can you speed without brakes  
Are you cancelled Are you taken in  
  
Can you whisky Can you gin  
Can you speed without brakes  
Can anyone repair me
