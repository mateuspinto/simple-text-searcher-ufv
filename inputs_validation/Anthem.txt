I got a girlfriend  
Only she dont know it yet  
I got a six string best friend  
Who sleeps with a broken neck  
I want to make my mark  
Change the world with this flow  
But all this doubt in my head  
It wont let me go  
  
Cant you see I want to lock my door and shut out all the world surrounding me  
Safe from the problems and the pressures caused by insecurities  
  
Get up Get up  
Let the good times roll  
Get up Get up  
Take my heart and my soul  
Get up Get up  
Let the good times roll  
On and on and on  
  
Feel like everyone else just needs to see through different eyes  
From the outside looking in we shout the anthem of our lives  
Come on and let me go  
And just like everyone else  
I feel the pain each time I try  
But Ill fight the bitter end  
To shout the anthem  
The anthem of our lives  
  
I got a heartache  
Shes my insecurity  
I got all these on my tongue but they escape me  
I want to breakout carpe diem  
I know but all this doubt in my head It wont let me go  
  
Cant you see I want to find my own direction on this busy oneway street  
Where all the influential people never bother helping me  
  
Get up Get up  
Let the good times roll  
Get up Get up  
Take my heart and my soul  
Get up Get up  
Let the good times roll  
One and on and on  
  
Feel like everyone else just needs to see through different eyes  
From the outside looking in we shout the anthem of our lives  
Come on and let me go  
And just like everyone else  
I feel the pain each time I try  
But Ill fight the bitter end  
To shout the anthem  
The anthem of our lives  
  
This is the anthem  
Out to all the misfits  
If you feel you dont belong  
If you dont give a shit  
About authority  
About majority  
About conformity  
Shout it out  
Let us go  
Let us go  
Let us go  
Let us go  
Let us go  
Let us go  
Let us go  
  
Everyone else just needs to see through different eyes  
From the outside looking in  
We shout the anthem of our lives  
Just like everyone else  
I feel the pain each time I try  
But Ill fight the bitter end  
To shout the anthem  
The anthem of our lives  
  
Feel like everyone else just needs to see through different eyes  
From the outside looking in  
We shout the anthem of our lives  
Just like everyone else  
I feel the pain each time I try  
But Ill fight the bitter end  
To shout the anthem  
The anthem of our lives
