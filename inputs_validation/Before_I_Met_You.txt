Repeats in Background  
Remember  
  
You changed my life in so many ways  
I just think back to how I used to be  
And how you dealt with me  
Just want to thank you  
  
Just in case I never see your face again face again  
Just in case the worst was meant to happen happen  
Just in case tomorrow never come there is something you should know should
know  
Ive given you every bit of the man I am of the man I am  
I know at times it wasnt pretty but it was all I had  
I never held back not one lil bit and the world can attest to this  
And baby you flipped my program upside down listen to me now  
  
Chorus  
I was a hustler and player girl before I met you  
Id drink a lil something then hit a lil something  
But how you made a difference look what Ive been missing  
You got my life together and I thank you forever  
I really used to throw a lot  
But I do one every night and sometimes I had two  
But all that done changed my game my frame of mind you got it right  
And I love you life girl I love you for life  
  
There was so many times I wasnt there for you  
And for everyone of those times I hated myself for  
The way I went about it the ups and the downs one foot in while the other
foots out  
Loving on you loving on another and I aint no different from any of the
brothers  
What I did to you right here right now in this here place  
In this here space as my heart pour out as I state my case as I break it down  
To tell you where Im coming from so youve seen the good youve done  
So youve feel the change youve made stay with me everyday  
  
Chorus  
  
Girl if I died tonight before I wake  
Know that you touched my life in oh so many ways  
And sugar this song is this I had to give would you remember  
Remember my heart remember it was good remember that I tried as long as I
could  
Remember that I gave till I had nothing else remember my voice
