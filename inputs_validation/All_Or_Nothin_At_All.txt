Said youd give me just a little kiss  
And youd rock me for a little while  
Well youd slip me just a piece of it  
Listen up little child  
I want it all or nothin at all  
I want it all or nothin at all  
Said youd take me for a little dance  
If you had a little time on your hands  
Well all I do is push and shove  
Just to get a little piece of your love  
I want it all or nothin at all  
I want it all or nothin at all  
Well now I dont want to be greedy  
But when it comes to love there aint no doubt  
You just aint gonna get what you want  
With one foot in and one foot out  
You got to give it all or nothin at all  
All or nothin at all  
Now I only got a little time  
So if youre gonna change your mind  
Then shout out what youre thinking of  
If what youre thinkin of is love  
I want it all or nothin at all  
I want it all or nothin at all
