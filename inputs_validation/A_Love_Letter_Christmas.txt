Do do do do do do do do do  
This is a Christmas remix  
  
And its sang  
La la la la la la la la la la  
Baby  
  
Did you get my card  
Did you read my love letter  
Did it touch your heart  
When you read my love letter  
  
Pour the wine read the signs  
Baby its Christmas time  
You and me underneath this tree  
Candle stories told  
Kisses under mistletoe  
And everyones asking their family  
  
Chorus  
Did you get my card  
Christmas card  
Did you read my love letter  
Did you read my love letter  
Did it touch your heart  
Did it touch your heart girl  
When you read my love letter  
My Christmas love letter  
  
Sleigh bells sweet dreams  
Kids are sleep you and me  
Wrap the gifts I cant wait til morning  
Cause this moments so heaven sent  
Marshmallows hot chocolate  
Fireplace you and me cuddling  
  
Chorus  
  
My hope is  
I hope these words find you  
I wrote this letter according to my love for you  
So I hope these presents will travel safely to where you are  
You find my heart with a ribbon wrapped on it in a box  
Though near or far I will find a way to send my love  
Only pray that it dont come back turned into cinder  
If you are reading this I hope that things are well  
And you can text me back or write me back just check your mail  
  
Chorus  
  
Do do do do do do do do do  
Yeah yeah  
La la la la la la  
Sound real good  
Its Christmas time in the hood  
And everybodys childish  
They be out of this world  
They stepping on Mars  
So mood and ropes up on me  
Say hey whats accurate  
Cause Kellys at Christmas party and  
Everybodys VIP then  
I know we all have our problems  
And tryin to make it better  
So I had to put on my music cake  
And write this Love Letter  
Come on baby  
Dance step move whatever Repeats  
Merry Christmas yall
