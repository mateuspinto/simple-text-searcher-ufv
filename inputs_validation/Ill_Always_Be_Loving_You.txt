You can turn me loose tear me up and run me down  
Cause me shame drag my name all over town  
Makes no difference what you say or what you do  
As for me Ill always be lovin you  
  
Chorus  
My love for you was not built on shifting sands  
I made a promise long ago and it still stands  
Go on and do what your heart tells you to  
As for me Ill always be lovin you  
  
You can change your dreams change your heart  
Or change your mind  
And just pretend that it all ends with your goodbye  
You can walk out and forget the love we knew  
As for me Ill always be lovin you
