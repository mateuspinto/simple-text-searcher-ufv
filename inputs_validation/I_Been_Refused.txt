Sittin after supper  
Watched the fbi  
Asked for the cigarette  
I got no reply  
Then you dropped your culottes  
Revealing rubber underpants  
Sweat was forming in my shoes  
But you ended our romance  
I been refused  
I lost my shoes  
Last Monday morning  
Minus 20 degrees  
Walked to unemployment  
On my knees  
Dogs in the ocean  
Figs in the sea well come on baby  
And wakkawakkawakka with me  
Bought a kodak brownie  
Developed film at home  
Took some shots of sister  
Pants were full of loam  
Took a couple back views  
Took some up front  
Three tries wallet size  
I was lookin at that cunt  
I been refused  
I lost my shoes
