Wont have you see me as your sad sack  
Lost my something and I cant get it back  
Or a kill on your trophy rack  
I checked my schedule now my train is rolling down a track  
Past the sadness of the salt flats  
To the prospect of the land fat  
Or just a lazy orange house cat  
On the sofa where Ill be put up  
Youve been the hole in my sky my shrinking water supply  
Before my well runs dry  
Im going round round round the bend  
Fill it up again  
  
Id like to say that it was clear to me  
Love triangle geometry  
But in the end its still a mystery  
The placement of affection and the disarray  
I gathered up the courage that it took  
Made that bed and took one last look  
And you could hear the pages flapping in the wind blown  
Book of my days my days  
One tank gone second thoughts are on my mind  
Whats this trip gonna cost me this time  
The devil I know is starting to look awfully kind  
But the new road is an old friend  
I fill it up again
