For the love poured out  
For the price of freedom  
Let the whole Earth sing  
Hear the praises rising  
We stand in awe of what Youve done for us at the cross  
  
The hope of the world  
Lifted on high  
Calling us home with arms out wide  
To know You forever  
To love You forever  
You are our everything  
  
Our sin erased  
Were forgiven  
You made a way  
You are our ransom  
We owe this life for all Youve done for us at the cross  
  
The hope of the world  
Lifted on high  
Calling us home with arms out wide  
To know You forever  
To love You forever  
You are our everything  
x2  
  
All we need is You  
All we need is You  
All we need is You  
All we need is You  
  
The hope of the world  
Lifted on high  
Calling us home with arms out wide  
To know You forever  
To love You forever  
You are our everything  
x2  
  
To know You forever  
To love You forever  
You are our everything  
x2
