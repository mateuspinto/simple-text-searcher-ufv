When will the morning come  
I wait in darkness so long  
Will the sun ever rise again  
  
Hours flowing over me  
I wait in vain for some change  
Will light ever pierce this pain  
  
Riding on a humming birds wing  
Caravans fleeing from the east  
May the pilgrim join in the feast  
  
How will the morning be  
I watched the dawn in my dreams  
And imagined the day for years  
Shall I feel warmth again  
And feel it true when they say  
That the day never ends in tears  
  
Riding on a humming birds wing  
Caravans fleeing from the east  
May the pilgrim join in the feast  
  
Tell me please  
  
How will it come  
This release  
A crack in the door  
  
Shall I feel warm again  
And feel it true when they say  
That the day never ends in tears  
  
Beyond and back of the wind  
Little birds fly into the sea  
Morning light shine on me  
  
Oh tell me please how will she come  
Surrounding me the opening door  
  
Riding on a humming birds wing  
Caravans fleeing from the east  
May the pilgrim join in the feast  
  
Beyond and back of the wind  
Little birds fly into the sea  
Morning light shine on me  
  
Riding on a humming birds wing  
Caravans fleeing from the east
