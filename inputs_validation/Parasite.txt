Lifting the mask from from a local clown  
Feeling down like him  
Seeing the light in a station bar  
And travelling far in sin  
Sailing downstairs to the northern line  
Watching the shine of the shoes  
And hearing the trial of the people there  
Whos to care if they lose  
And take a look you may see me on the ground  
For I am the parasite of this town  
  
Dancing a jig in a church with chimes  
A sign of the times today  
And hearing no bell from a steeple tall  
People all in dismay  
Falling so far on a silver spoon  
Making the moon for fun  
And changing a rope for a size too small  
People all get hung  
Take a look and see me coming through  
For I am the parasite who travels two by two  
  
When lifting the mask from a local clown  
And feeling down like him  
And Im seeing the light in a station bar  
And travelling far in sin  
And Im sailing downstairs to the northern line  
Watching the shine of the shoes  
And hearing the trials of the people there  
Whos to care if they lose  
And take a look you may see me on the ground  
For I am the parasite of this town  
And take a look you may see me in the dirt  
For i am the parasite who hangs from your skirt
