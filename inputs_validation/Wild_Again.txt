A diamond sun cuts down a frozen winter sky  
As the world and I go screaming into the phantom night  
It doesnt matter where it leads I got nowhere left to go  
If theres any chance at all its somewhere down this road  
  
Chorus  
To be wild again no ones child again  
Yeah I want to see those eyes in the mirror full of fire again  
Oh to be wild again  
  
The fading light is cold on the shoulders of the trees  
Oh the star wind blows right through me and I never felt so free  
Oh there had to be a crossroad a place to draw the line  
And it came down to the question is this life Im livin mine  
  
Had to be wild again no ones child again  
I want to live every minute so hard that I wear it thin  
I want to find the edge risk it all to win  
I want to see those eyes in the mirror full of fire again Fire again  
I want to be wild again Wild again  
  
There has to be a crossroad a place to draw the line  
And it comes down to the question what is theirs and what is mine  
  
Wild again no ones child again  
I want to live every minute so hard that I wear it thin  
I want to find the edge risk it all to win  
I want to see those eyes in the mirror burn with life again Life again  
Yeah  
I want to be wild Wild again let the change begin  
I want to find the edge risk it all want to burn with life again  
want to be wild again yeah I want to be wild again  
Wild again
