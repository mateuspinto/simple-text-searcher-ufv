Found that man reported missing  
He wandered in his home  
It dont seem to bad if you consider  
Just what hes been through  
  
Seems he met up with a gang of thieves  
Who mistook him for a man of means  
They locked him up then found he had no money  
So they let him go again  
Now hes back at home and happy  
Just to see the kids  
  
I wish that I could really tell you  
All the things that happened to me  
And all that I have seen  
A world full of people their hearts full of joy  
Cities of light with no fear of war  
And thousands of creatures with happier lives  
And dreams of a future with meaning and no need to hide  
  
Oh keep it dark  
  
It seems strange to have to lie  
About a world so bright  
And tell instead a madeup story  
From the world of night  
  
I wish that I could really tell you  
All the things that happened to me  
And all that I have seen  
A world full of people their hearts full of joy  
Cities of light with no fear of war  
And thousands of creatures with happier lives  
And dreams of a future with meaning and no need to lie  
No need to hate  
No need to hide  
  
Oh keep it dark
