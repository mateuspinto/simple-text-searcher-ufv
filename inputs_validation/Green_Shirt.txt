Theres a smart young woman on a light blue screen  
Who comes into my house every night  
And she takes all the red yellow orange and green  
And she turns them into black and white  
  
But you tease and you flirt  
And you shine all the buttons on your green shirt  
You can please yourself but somebodys gonna get it  
  
Better cut off all identifying labels  
Before they put you on the torture table  
  
Cause somewhere in the Quisling Clinic  
Theres a shorthand typist taking seconds over minutes  
Shes listening in to the Venus line  
Shes picking out names  
I hope none of them are mine  
  
But you tease and you flirt  
  
Never said I was a stool pigeon  
I never said I was a diplomat  
Everybody is under suspicion  
But you dont want to hear about that  
  
Cause you tease and you flirt  
  
Better send a begging letter to the big investigation  
Who put these fingerprints on my imagination  
  
You tease and you flirt  
  
You can please yourself but somebodys gonna get it  
You can please yourself but somebodys gonna get it
