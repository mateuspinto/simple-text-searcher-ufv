She shines like a flower  
In my head  
Everybody  
Wants to pick her head  
  
Chorus  
She said she loved me  
And lied to me  
She was by the river  
And lied to me  
  
She shines like a flower  
In my head  
Everybody  
Wants her in their bed  
  
Chorus  
She said she loved you  
And lied to you  
She was by the river  
And lied to you  
  
So eager  
So eager  
So eager  
  
Chorus  
  
So eager7x  
  
So eager 3x  
  
Chorus  
  
So eager 6x
