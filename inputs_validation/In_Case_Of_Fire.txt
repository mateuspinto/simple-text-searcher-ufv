Verse 1  
Burnin up the second Adderall  
To take the edge off the crazy  
Jump out the window a human cannonball  
Congratulations baby  
  
Chorus  
Break glass dont ya look back  
In case of fire  
Escape plan grab what you can  
In case of fire  
Girl you know you gotta burn  
  
Verse 2  
Pass like two auras 2 frozen credit cards  
Another borrowed vacation  
Girl youre a day late and 20 000 short  
But let it be your lizations

Break glass dont ya look back  
In case of fire  
Escape plan grab what you can  
In case of fire  
Girl you know you gotta burn  
  
Verse 3  
Bad girl good moves  
Big dreams but little fuse  
You start fires that you cant put out  
Just watch it burn Let it burn  
  
A lifetime of heartbreak and outta cigarettes  
A melancholy equation  
Street summer memories of the day we met  
Could change the radio station  
  
Chorus X2  
Break glass dont ya look back  
In case of fire  
Escape plan grab what you can  
In case of fire  
Girl you know you gotta burn
