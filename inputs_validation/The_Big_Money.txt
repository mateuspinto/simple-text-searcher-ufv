Big money goes around the world  
Big money underground  
Big money got a mighty voice  
Big money make no sound  
Big money pull a million strings  
Big money hold the prize  
Big money weave a mighty web  
Big money draw the flies  
  
Sometimes pushing people around  
Sometimes pulling out the rug  
Sometimes pushing all the buttons  
Sometimes pulling out the plug  
Its the power and the glory  
Its a war in paradise  
Its a Cinderella story  
On a tumble of the dice  
  
Big money goes around the world  
Big money take a cruise  
Big money leave a mighty wake  
Big money leave a bruise  
Big money make a million dreams  
Big money spin big deals  
Big money make a mighty head  
Big money spin big wheels  
  
Sometimes building ivory towers  
Sometimes knocking castles down  
Sometimes building you a stairway  
Lock you underground  
Its that oldtime religion  
Its the kingdom they would rule  
Its the fool on television  
Getting paid to play the fool  
  
Big money goes around the world  
Big money give and take  
Big money done a power of good  
Big money make mistakes  
Big money got a heavy hand  
Big money take control  
Big money got a mean streak  
Big money got no soul
