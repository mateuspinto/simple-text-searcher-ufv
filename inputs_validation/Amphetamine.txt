She came out west  
To find the sun  
She lost her name  
But found a new one  
Amy goes to school all day  
But at night in the neighborhood  
They call her  
Amphetamine  
  
She is perfect in that fucked up way  
That all the magazines  
Seem to want to glorify these days  
  
She looks like a teenage anthem  
She looks like she used to be happy with  
The girl inside  
  
She looks so bored sometimes  
She has that super pale skin  
And those soft green eyes  
She looks like she  
Could have been happy  
In a better life  
  
She came out west  
Just to break away clean  
From her family and her friends  
And a little girls dream  
All she wants to do every night  
Is to sit beside my window  
And listen to the sirens  
  
She is perfect in that fucked up way  
That all the magazines  
Seem to want to glorify these days  
  
She looks like a teenage anthem  
She looks like she should have been happy  
In another life  
  
In another life  
  
She came out west  
Just to break the spell  
After three long years  
In a marriage from hell  
Six months clean  
Living sober and right  
The doctors tell her  
Everything will be alright  
  
Yeah you just take your pill  
And everything will be alright  
  
She looks like a teenage anthem  
She looks like a magazine girl  
She looks like a teenage anthem  
Like she used to be happy  
In another world  
  
She looks like a teenage anthem  
She is happy with the girl inside  
She looks like a teenage anthem  
And looks like she could have been  
Happy in another life  
  
In another life  
Happy in another life  
  
Met her at a party  
And I took her home  
She is the saddest girl  
That I have ever known  
She wakes me up  
In the middle of the night  
Just to tell me  
Everything will be alright  
Amy smiles at me and tells me  
Everything will be alright  
  
I tell myself the same damn thing  
  
Everyday  
  
Everything will be alright
