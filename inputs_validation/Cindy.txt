All my hopes and dreams are forgotten now  
All the apples in barrel are rotten now  
Standing on a mountain of misery  
Loneliness is my only company  
  
Oh when are gonna come Cindy  
When will you be homeward bound  
Im in need of you and the love we knew  
Cindy  
  
I thought we were birds of a feather now  
And will always be together now  
And were ever I go you will follow me  
A life of love with you as my destiny  
  
Oh when you gonna come come home Cindy  
When will you be homeward bound  
There an empty space since you left this place  
Cindy my Cindy  
  
Come back Cindy comeback  
Cindy you have made a great mistake  
But mistakes were sometimes made to break  
Cindy love is made of give and take  
  
Let are move be made for loves sake  
Come on home  
Cant you see I was made for you you were made for me  
  
People tell me Im not the same now  
I only respond to my name now  
But no one knows it better than me myself  
Without your love I can never be myself  
Oh when you gonna come home Cindy  
Cindy my Cindy
