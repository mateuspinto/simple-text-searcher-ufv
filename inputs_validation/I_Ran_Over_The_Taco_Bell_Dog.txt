I was drivin around in Old Mexico  
I got lost didnt know what way to go  
I was confused It was late and I was in the fog  
I ran over the Taco Bell dog  
  
I felt that smoosh and I said oh Mama  
My lowrider squished that little Chihuahua  
I pray for forgiveness and I sin to my god  
I ran over the Taco Bell dog  
  
If I am caught they will lock me in a cell with 20 locks  
Unless I can pin it on Jack in The Box  
Ill be wipped then beaten and then I will be flogged  
I ran over the Taco Bell dog  
  
His last words were yakey aro el medico  
I flattened that pup to hell I will go  
I should have not gone driving and went for a jog  
I ran over the Taco Bell dog  
I ran over the Taco Bell dog  
I ran over the Taco Bell dog
