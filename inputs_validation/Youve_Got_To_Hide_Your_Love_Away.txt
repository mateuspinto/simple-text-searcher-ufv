Here I stand head in hand  
Turn my face to the wall  
If shes gone I cant go on  
Feelin twofoot small  
Everywhere people stare  
Each and every day  
I can see them laugh at me  
And I hear them say  
Hey youve got to hide your love away  
Hey youve got to hide your love away  
How could I even try  
I can never win  
Hearing them seeing them  
In the state Im in  
How could she say to me  
Love will find a way  
Gather round all you clowns  
Let me hear you say  
Hey youve got to hide your love away  
Hey youve got to hide your love away
