You dont remember my name  
I dont really care  
Can we play the game your way  
Can I really lose control  
  
Just once in my life  
I think itd be nice  
Just to lose control just once  
With all the pretty flowers in the dust  
  
Mary had a lamb  
His eyes black as coals  
If we play very quiet my lamb  
Mary never has to know  
  
Just once in my life  
I think itd be nice  
Just to lose control just once  
  
If I cut you down to a thing I can use  
I fear there will be nothing good left of you  
  
Just to lose control just once
