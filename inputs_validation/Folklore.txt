Hey you will you be true  
When you can see through what I do  
Feel the pain in your brain insane  
Will I see my name in your scars  
  
And you will see what you mean to me  
  
Last between the lines  
Do you feel the need  
When the night comes down  
And when the night comes down  
A father is waiting  
  
And you will see what you mean to me  
  
Lost control and called your name  
Left a home in the pouring rain  
In a sea of guilt and shame  
Will we sustain
