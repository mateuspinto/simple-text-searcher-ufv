I would have waited all my life  
Just to make love out of something other than spite  
But the beauty is the beast youre baiting  
Should really be worth the waiting  
  
Chorus  
You do something very special to  
Mr Average  
Now the lamb lies with the lion  
Hes just a little savage  
  
And so you turn your back on me  
And all the hot air that only echoes stale tobacco  
  
Actions speak louder now than words  
By just a fraction  
Whats the use of saying I love you whe Im drinking to distraction  
We save our sanity  
By saying such and such  
After all its been discussed  
You say you must be touched  
  
Chorus
