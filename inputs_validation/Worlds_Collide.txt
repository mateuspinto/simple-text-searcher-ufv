From the moment that I laid my eyes on you I knew  
The glory of a new day had arrived I was hooked on you  
  
Suddenly life it seemed was greater than my wildest dream  
It never even crossed my mind to try to hide my love  
  
There was no way we could stop getting caught up in that groove  
  
Something happens to my life  
When our worlds collide  
Puts my spirit in the light  
When our worlds collide  
  
I wasnt looking for another love  
I guess my heart was open to persuasion  
So surprised you came into my life out of the blue  
  
Suddenly life it seemed was greater than the wildest of my dreams  
It never even crossed my mind to try to hide my love  
  
There was no way we could stop getting caught up in that groove  
  
Something happens to my life  
When our worlds collide  
Puts my spirit in the light  
When our worlds collide  
  
Your world my world your world my world
