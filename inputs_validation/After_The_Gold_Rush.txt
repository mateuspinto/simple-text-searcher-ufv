Well I dreamed I saw the knights  
In armor coming  
Saying something about a queen  
There were peasants singing and  
Drummers drumming  
And the archer split the tree  
There was a fanfare blowing  
To the sun  
That was floating on the breeze  
Look at Mother Nature on the run  
In the nineteen seventies  
Look at Mother Nature on the run  
In the nineteen seventies  
  
I was lying in a burned out basement  
With the full moon in my eyes  
I was hoping for replacement  
When the sun burst thru the sky  
There was a band playing in my head  
And I felt like getting high  
I was thinking about what a  
Friend had said  
I was hoping it was a lie  
Thinking about what a  
Friend had said  
I was hoping it was a lie  
  
Well I dreamed I saw the silver  
Space ships flying  
In the yellow haze of the sun  
There were children crying  
And colors flying  
All around the chosen ones  
All in a dream all in a dream  
The loading had begun  
They were flying Mother Natures  
Silver seed to a new home in the sun  
Flying Mother Natures  
Silver seed to a new home
