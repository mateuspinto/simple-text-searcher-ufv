You called down the thunder too late now theres no way out  
Nothing is gonna stop me until then better watch your back

There is no retreating I will cut you down to size  
You will beg for mercy a bad seed youre as good as dead  
Yield to new dimension Hells coming better say your prayers

One day you will face me and see the terror trapped inside  
Final retribution torture and pure punishment  
Vengeance running so deep a dungeon of agony awaits  
Fear not as death surrounds you  
Bitch all you want but here it comes
