He wakes up early today  
Throws on a mask that will alter his face  
No one knows his real name  
But now he just uses one he saw on a grave  
  
He pretends hes okay but you should see  
In his bed late at night hes petrified  
  
Take me out finish this waste of a life  
  
Chorus  
Everyone gather around for a show  
Watch as this man disappears as we know  
Do me a favor and try to ignore  
As you watch him fall through a bleeding trapdoor  
End Chorus  
  
He thinks that faith might be dead  
Nothing kills man faster than his own hand  
He used to dream things at night  
But now hes just watching the backs of his eyes  
  
He pretends hes okay but you should see  
In his bed late at night hes petrified  
  
Take me out finish this waste of a life  
  
Chorus  
  
Take me out finish this waste of a life  
  
Everyone gather around for a show  
Watch as this man disappears as we know  
Do me a favor and try to ignore  
As you watch him fall through a bleeding trapdoor  
  
Cause nobody knows his life
