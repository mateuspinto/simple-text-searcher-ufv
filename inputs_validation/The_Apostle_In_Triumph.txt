In solitude I wander  
Through the vast enchanted forest  
  
The surrounding skies are one  
Torn apart by the phenomenon of lightning  
Rain is pouring down my now shivering shoulders  
In the rain my tears are forever lost  
  
The darkened oaks are my only shelter  
Red leaves are blown by the wind  
An ebony raven now catches my eye  
Sitting in calmness  
Before spreading his black wings  
Reaching for the skies  
  
In this forest  
Where wolves cry their agony unto the moon  
My spirit is hidden  
In the form of wisdom  
Carved on a black stone  
The only way to follow  
  
Open your soul  
Redeem I am immortal  
  
Blinded by a light  
My soul is held up in glory  
I engulf the skies  
The apostle in triumph  
  
Through the eternal flame I travel  
As the rain keeps falling
