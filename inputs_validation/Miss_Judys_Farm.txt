Miss Judy she was moody  
Owned a sweaty farm in old Alabam  
I was just 18 crude and mean  
All I needed was to get my own way  
Get out of my way  
  
Miss Judy she could have me  
Any hour of the working day  
Shed send me in the corn field mid afternoon  
Said son its all part of your job  
  
Miss Judy had a cross eyed poodle  
That I would kick if I was given the chance  
Never was amused by the kindness I used  
I was whipped in the barn until dawn  
It hurt me  
  
Last summer we was restless  
Were gonna make a stand and burn down your farm  
But it was all in the head  
Cause out in the yard  
Miss Judy had the National Guard  
We was beaten before we started  
  
Miss Judy she was moody  
And she always didnt get her own way  
  
Just state the facts get it right  
Kick her when shes down
