Last night  
I saw a fire burning on  
The palace lawn  
Oer the land  
The humble subjects watched in mixed  
Emotion  
  
Chorus  
Who is burnin  
Who is burnin  
Effigy  
Who is burnin  
Who is burnin  
Effigy  
  
Last night  
I saw the fire spreadin to  
  
The palace door  
Silent majority  
Werent keepin quiet  
Anymore  
  
Chorus  
  
Last night  
I saw the fire spreadin to  
The country side  
In the mornin  
Few were left to watch  
The ashes die  
  
Chorus  
  
Why  
Why  
Why  
Effigy
