Waiting for  
  
opportunity to strike  
  
I have been your biggest fan  
  
what a tour  
  
a little blow to cure your fright  
  
thats what it takes to trap a man  
  
water me  
  
I am not the desert plant  
  
they would like before you  
  
when I close  
  
will I have my blue eyes  
  
when I open  
  
this time  
  
when I close  
  
should I have my green eyes  
  
when I open  
  
that shine and shine  
  
when I close  
  
will I have my green eyes  
  
when I open  
  
I love you  
  
woohoooo

woohoooo  
  
woohoooo  
  
woohoooo  
  
in my room  
  
underneath the microscope  
  
I remember how it felt  
  
I thought you knew  
  
I was always full of hope  
  
but you could only help yourself  
  
when I close  
  
will I have my blue eyes  
  
when I open  
  
this time  
  
when I close  
  
should I have my green eyes  
  
when I open  
  
that shine and shine  
  
when I close  
  
will I have my green eyes  
  
when I open  
  
I love you  
  
woohoooo

ladadada  
  
will I have my blue eyes  
  
ladadada  
  
this time  
  
ladadada  
  
should I have my green eyes  
  
ladadada  
  
that shine and shine  
  
when I close  
  
will I have my blue eyes  
  
when I open  
  
this time  
  
when I close  
  
or should I have my green eyes  
  
when I open  
  
that shine and shine  
  
when I close  
  
will I have my green eyes  
  
when I open  
  
I love you
