Gold sun rolls around  
Chocolate nipple brown  
Tumble from your arms  
Like the ground your breasts swell  
Land awake from sleep  
Hares will kick and leap  
Flowers climb erect  
Smiling from the moist kiss of her rainbow mouth  
  
Chorus  
  
Stage left  
Enter Easter and shes dressed in yellow yolk  
Stage right  
Now the son has died the father can be born  
Stand up  
If wed all breathe in and blow away the smoke  
New life  
Wed applaud a new life  
  
Odin mounts the tree  
Bleeds for you and me  
Splashing on the lamb  
Gamboling with springs step  
Buds will laugh and burst  
Racing to be first  
Turning all the soil  
As the promptress fingers through her spinning script  
  
Chorus  
  
Easter in her bonnet  
Easter in her hair  
Easter are the ribbons  
She tied everywhere
