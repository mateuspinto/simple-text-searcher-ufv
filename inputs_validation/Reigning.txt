Reigning  
Words by Ray Boltz Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
When You were born  
There lived a king  
And whatever he wanted  
His servants would bring  
His power seemed great  
To the people back then  
But his glory faded  
And Yours never will end  
Chorus  
You are still reigning  
Glorious One  
Mighty Redeemer  
Gods precious Son  
Forever and ever we worship you  
Jesus the King  
You are still reigning  
When Your return  
Unlike before  
Our eyes will see You  
The glorious Lord  
All that we know  
Will suddenly change  
But even in heaven  
This is always the same  
Chorus  
You reign in power  
You reign in power and glory  
And You will reign forever  
And ever and ever and ever  
Chorus repeat
