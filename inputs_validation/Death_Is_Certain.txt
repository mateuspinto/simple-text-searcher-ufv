Death is the best  
Better than all the rest  
On the dutiful lies in the rock paradise  
Losses and wear and the texture of age  
Adds a truth to the heart  
And a light to the face  
  
Its good when you dont give as  
Much of a fuck  
As you did when the threats mount  
To make you suck  
A burst of rage  
A lively cry  
Emotions wide  
  
Your death is certain for sure  
My death is certain alright  
But death is certain no cure  
Cause death is certain  
Cause death is certain so why  
  
Gotta die  
A bone and a skull  
In a conjugal hell  
A mall full of gall  
And the music jerks off  
Pale and fate  
  
At the table they sat  
With their necks choking tight  
In their collars dead white  
Liquor and food till  
They spin and explode  
In a shower of crap  
In Americas lap  
A plicemans numb  
A lazy bum  
Emotions come  
  
Cause death is certain its sure  
Cause death is certain its pure  
Cause death is certain no cure  
Cause death is certain  
Cause death is certain thats why  
  
Gotta die  
Alright  
Alright  
Well alright  
Alright Repeat x6  
  
A beast with legs  
A kid whos numb  
A lazy bum  
Your death is certain its sure  
Cause death is certain its pure  
Cause death is certain no cure  
Cause death is certain
