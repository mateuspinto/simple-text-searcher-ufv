All of my life Ive searched for this  
Its hard to explain this happiness  
All of my searching left me poor  
Now I have tasted my spirits crying  
Out for more  
Everyday its hard to believe  
The way You change whats inside of me  
I wanna get closer to You  
When I think that Ive let You down  
Your open arms of love I have found  
I wanna get closer to You  
There was a time when I was lost  
Caught in a world of selfish cares  
But when You found me something changed  
My eyes were opened now I will never  
Be the same
