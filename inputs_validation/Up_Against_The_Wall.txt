I was just doing my thing hanging out at the spot  
You know the place we go The musics John blaze hot  
and everybody was feeling the DJ  
The smoke cleared and I saw a beautiful lady  
The lights were low and the disco ball came down  
She walked up to me slow and you know what happens now  
The girl was fine and she knew she had game  
What more do I have to say  
  
Chorus  
She took my hand and never said a word at all  
she starting grinding shorty had me up against the wall  
I see you bouncing now you know that I dont care at all  
she took me hand now she had me up against the wall  
We dont we dont care at all  
  
Its almost two oclock its time to make my move  
The afterhour spot is where Im going to  
cause I gotta have some more looking for  
Somebody to hit the dance floor  
And lucky for me I see a fine young ladys eying me  
The lights are low and her friends are all around  
She walked up to me slow and you know what happens now  
She turned around and she worked it the worst way  
What more do I have to say  
  
Chorus x3  
  
You know we dont care at all now let let me see ya up up against the wall
