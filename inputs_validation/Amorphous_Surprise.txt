Take me closer to you  
Push you in your finite  
Smoke in big pic session  
Lurched in broken promise  
  
Silence is pretty finding the city  
Know your disguise above the surprise  
  
Cheap line flights and jet sky  
Pitch like the royal bastard  
Closed present I may taste it  
Closer than I may wasted  
  
Silence is pretty finding the city  
Know your disguise above the surprise  
  
Silence is pretty finding the city  
Know your disguise above the  
Surprise your eyes  
Above the surprise your eyes  
Above the surprise
