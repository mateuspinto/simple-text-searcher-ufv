Oh Wait a minute now  
Ha ha ha  
Come on  
Wait a Minute Now  
Check  
  
To tha young r to tha e tha b to tha e tha l  
Never give up just live up  
Fed upon America  
We be spittin it up  
Rippin it up  
For an even amount in each cup  
To my brothers burning bare feet on black top  
Whose curled neath tha shadows  
From tha gaze of tha cops  
Whose huntin for 9 to 5s through factory locks  
Is now hunted on this modern day auction block

Packin  
  
Flexin and mashin  
With complex text  
Fast and in a fashion  
That snap back necks  
Quicker than a fed cash tha company checks  
Come with tha fire only Marley could catch  
This be tha flame in tha cellar beware  
Nameless cold millions gaspin for air  
Those naked and wageless  
Now scream within cages  
What they make you pull your shit  
Just to get your share what

Welcome down with the warrior sound UGH  
  
With this mic device  
I spit nonfiction  
Who got tha power  
This be my question  
Tha mass of tha few in this torn nation  
Tha priest tha book or tha congregation  
Tha politricks who rob and hold down your zone  
Or those who give tha thieves tha key to their homes  
Tha pig whos free to murder one Shucklak  
Or survivors who make a move and murder one back
