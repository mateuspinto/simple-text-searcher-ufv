Always strapped when I hit the club  
Niggas give me that bitches give me hugs  
And since Im paid niggas be muggin me  
You know Im muggin back niggaz be muggin  
Me you know Im muggin back  
  
Yes sir  
Check me out hod up  
26 inches bitch was sittin croocked  
Old school chevy faster den a silver bullet  
Strawberry paint seats vanilla puddin 2 bitches goin at each others pussy  
Top chopped sent the car to a barbershop  
My driveway looks somethin like a parkin lot  
Im so unorthodox I got your bitch ridin my dick wit no shox  
Bounce bitch bounce bounce  
Im the hottest shit jumping out the coffe pot man Im just tryin  
To get my spot like a polka dot Lil cush make my eyes and my shoulders drop  
Lil syrup and I can make the soda pop keep talking and I can make my soldiers
pop  
Real niggas ridin wit me till the motor stop I got these hoes straight
livin  
Out the soap op I got a couple like a coat on OK  
  
Chorus  
  
Always strapped when I hit the club  
Niggas give me dat bitches give me hugs  
And since Im paid bitches be lovin me  
They know I love em back bitches be lovin me they know I love em back  
  
Put the K in the car while we ridin blazed  
Put the chop and the pussy in the driveway  
Bet the house on the youngen and we got paid  
Triple colors on the bikes and the new Mercedes  
Bustin keys on they ass while we got paid  
But my tens ridin hot to an open bay  
Uptown made man out the hard way crap in the bucket 50 shots bitch make a way  
like father like son  
Ball till ya fall stunting with them paper plates  
Throw hundreds on them hoes while we eating stakes  
We in the club poppin bottles like everyday  
We grind for the shine nigga getting big money  
Got a fleet tossin chicken nigga get cake  
Im on his island with this power like Scarface  
Im in the impala dropped top chawnky ice man birdman rockin red monkeys  
  
Chorus  
  
Always strapped when I hit the club  
Niggas give me that bitches give me hugs  
And since Im paid bitches be lovin me  
They know I love em back bitches be lovin me they know I love em back
