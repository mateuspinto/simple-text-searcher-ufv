Baby the time is right to tell it all like it is  
And now that I feel god like theres nothing that cant be kissed  
The name of a lonely soul is scratched into my brain  
He thought he was king creole  
Until he found out until he found out  
  
He sits upon a throne  
He lives a sleazy lie  
But hes all alone again again  
  
I can see a liar sitting by the fire  
Trouble in his heart laughing at the thought  
Coming as he goes into overdose  
I wonder what he thinks of me
