Have you heard have you heard  
About this girl who was ripped up  
By her roots  
Have you heard what she learned  
  
Like humility you win when you lose  
I have learned I have learned  
The most horrifying nights have an end  
I was hurt I was lost  
  
In the dark I found a way to a friend  
I am standing here in my ravine  
Once again I see a piece of the sky  
And my joyll never be denied  
  
Cause I was meant to be here  
The only place on earth  
Where you are near where you are near  
Was a flower so frail  
  
And I let the trees grow wild around me  
Grew so high hid the sky  
Shaded everything I needed to see  
Then one night someone came  
  
Took a knife an ripped me up by my roots  
Tossed astray far away  
In my darkest night I started to pray  
I am standing  
  
Why do you why do you ask  
Why Im not blaming my god  
Ill tell you Ill tell you what  
He was the only one there  
  
I am standing
