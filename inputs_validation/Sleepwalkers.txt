At night this mindless army ranks unbroken by dissent  
Is moved into action and their pace does not relent  
In step with great precision these dancers of the night  
Advance against the darkness  how implacable their might  
Eyes undulled by moon their arms and legs akimbo  
They walk and live hoping soon to surface from this limbo  
Their minds anticipating the dawn of the day  
Shall never know whats waiting mere insight away  
Too far too soon  
  
Senses dimmed in semisentience only wheeling through this plane  
Only seeing fragmented images prematurely curtailed by the brain  
But breathing living knowing in some measure at least  
The soul which roots the matter of both Beauty and the Beast  
From what tooth or claw does murder spring  
From what flesh and blood does passion  
Both cut through the air with the pendulums swing  
In deadly but delicate fashion  
And every range of feeling is there in the dream  
And every logics reeling in the force of the scream  
The senses sting  
And though I may be dreaming and reality stalls  
I only know the meaning of sight and thats all  
And thats nothing  
  
The columns of the night advance  
Infectiously their cryptic dance  
Gathers converts to the fold   
In time the whole raw world will pace these same steps  
On into the same bitter end  
  
Somnolent muster now the dancing dead  
Forsake the shelter of their secure beds  
Awaken to a slumber whose depths they dread  
As if the ground they tread would give way  
Beneath the solemn weight of their conception  
Id search the hidden corners of all this world  
Make reason of the sensory whorl  
If I only had time  
But soon the dream is ended  
  
Tonight before you lay down to the sweetness of your sleep  
Do you question your surrender to the drop from Lovers Leap  
Or does the anaesthetic darkness take hold on its very own  
Does your body rise in service with not one dissenting groan  
These waking dreams of life and death  
In the mirror are twisted and buckled  
Lashes flicker a catch of breath  
Skin whitening at the knuckles  
The army of sleepwalkers shake their limbs and are loose  
And though I am a talker I can phrase no excuse  
Not to rise again  
In the chorus of the nighttime I belong  
And I like you must dance to that moonlight song  
And in the end I too must pay the cost of this life  
If all is lost none is known  
And how could we lose what weve never owned  
Oh Id search out every knowledge that I could find  
Unravel all the mysteries of mind  
If I only had time  
If I only had time  
But soon my time is ended
