Experience babe kickin stones and cans  
Experience babe cigarettestained hands  
Its not too late hear it in the wind  
Its not too late feel passion creepin in  
Intoxication familiar smells of the hotels  
Infatuation of knowing who you are  
  
You and I you and I you and I  
Arrow through my heart  
Catch a star  
  
Isolation rows and rows of cars  
Isolation like Jupiter and Mars  
Staring faces set in celluloid  
Welcome to the late show starring Null and Void  
Complications things get in the way  
Sweet sensation of knowing you are near and not too far  
  
You and I you and I you and I  
Arrow through my heart  
Catch a star  
  
You and I you and I you and I  
Freeway through your heart  
Catch a star  
  
Catch a star
