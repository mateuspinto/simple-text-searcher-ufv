Somebody told me I know where to go  
Somebody showed me I was last to know  
  
Sell me down the river  
Sell me down the river  
Sell me down the river  
Sell me down the river  
  
What I wanted is what I wanted  
What I wanted is what she wanted  
  
Unfriendly feelings down on wounded knee  
Unfriendly reasons some blind mothers need  
  
Sell me down the river  
Sell me down the river  
Sell me down the river  
Sell me down the river  
  
What I wanted is what I wanted  
What I wanted is what she wanted  
  
You read the words and it sells you life  
They sell their words but its all a lie
