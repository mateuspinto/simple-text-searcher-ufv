If you were here in Starkville  
Townie boys would love the way you stare  
If you were here in Starkville  
Well the local girls they wouldnt have a prayer  
  
Well Ive spent a reckless night inside the wonder  
Of your everlasting charm  
Now Im haunted by geography and the flora  
And the fauna of your heart  
  
At the dawning of some road worn day  
I call you on a whim just to say  
The morning birds are singing  
But I could not do them justice  
So I hung up and I fell back to sleep  
  
But Im in love with my mobility  
Sometimes this life can be a drag  
Like when I noticed your nobility  
And how my leaving  
It only held you back  
  
But I remember one occasion  
When you were drinking  
And you asked me to the coast  
But I was hell bent on agony back then  
And so I missed the boat  
  
At the dawning of some road worn day  
I call you on a whim just to say  
My regrets become distractions  
When I can not do them justice  
Then I hung up and I fell back to sleep  
  
When I was down in Starkville  
I was hiding out inside some comfort inn  
From a local gang of troubadours  
When the homecoming queen  
She come ridin in  
oooh  
Yeah  
  
Yeah but I slipped out of my room into the rain  
oooh  
And I went running for my health  
oooh  
I watched those headlights turn to moonlight  
And finally I was running by myself  
  
Now its the dawning of some road worn day  
And I call you on a whim just to say  
The morning birds are singing
