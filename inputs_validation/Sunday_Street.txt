Im down the lane on Sunday morning  
Hung over and forever yawning  
I look for trousers that will fit me  
She buys a yellow shirt thats sickly  
A sarsparilla drink turns white teeth shades of pink  
Sunday league play in the sunshine  
I hear the whistle blow at halftime  
With chapped legs and muddy shorts  
They walk home past the tennis courts  
A pint of prawns in hand  
I hear a ragtime band  
  
On Monday  
I want the weekend to come  
On Tuesday  
Im glad that Monday is done  
Then Wednesday  
And Thursday fly by  
Then on Friday and Saturday night  
We get happy till Sunday is through  
  
Siesta time in the living room  
Snores go in and out of tune  
After tea time were off to the pub  
To play in the trivia club  
How longs the river Thames  
Its where the evening ends  
In my bed Im reading poetry  
No one knows whats come over me  
I close the book and turning out the light  
I hear the sound of Monday outside
