My eyes burn naked  
My black cold numbers  
My insecurities  
My devious nature  
Make it go away  
  
My rest between rubber  
My spider shadow  
My shattered shadow dancer  
  
Beautiful broken  
My crystal fingers  
Beautiful broken  
My crystal fingers  
  
My glass like rain  
My illumination  
My cracks are sliding  
Shaker feather  
Rubber duster  
Cold cold  
Your fingers broken  
  
Beautiful wonderful  
Paper flaps  
How you love  
Love to love  
Love and stitch  
Shaker rubber striper  
  
Beautiful broken  
My crystal fingers  
Beautiful broken  
My crystal fingers
