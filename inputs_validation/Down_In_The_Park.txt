Down in the park  
Where the machmen meet the machines  
And play killbynumbers  
Down in the park with a friend called five  
  
I was in a car crash  
Or was it the war  
But Ive never been quite the same  
Little white lies like I was there  
  
Come to ZomZoms a place to eat  
Like it was built in one day  
You can watch the humans  
Trying to run  
  
Oh look theres a rape machine  
Id go outside if hed look the other way  
You wouldnt believe  
The things they do  
  
CHORUS  
We are not lovers  
We are not romantics  
We are here to serve you  
  
Down to the park  
Where the chant is death  
Death until the sun cries morning  
Down in the park with friends of mine  
  
chorus  
A different face but the words never change
