Take all the money that we need for school  
And to keep the street people in out of the cold  
Spend it on a weapon you can never use  
Make the world an offer that they cant refuse  
  
Open up the door and let the sharkmen feed Hoover of the future in the land
of greed  
Sell the Ponderosa to the Japanese  
Slap leather head for that line of trees yeah  
Slap leather go on Ron just about to go myself  
  
Turn the whole wide world into a TV show  
So its just the same game wherever you go  
You never meet a soul that you dont already know One big advertisement for
the status quo  
As if these celebrities were your close friends As if you knew how the story
ends  
  
As if you werent sitting in a room alone  
And there was somebody real  
At the other end of the phone yeah  
Squibnocket phone sex  
Just about to dial your number  
  
Get all worked up so we can go to war  
We find something worth killing for  
Tie a yellow ribbon around your eyes  
Big McFalafel and a side of fries

Slap leather phone love big McFalafel  
Just about to dial myself
