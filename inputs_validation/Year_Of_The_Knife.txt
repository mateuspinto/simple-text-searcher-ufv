Hallelujah the king is dead He said  
Love was the knife   
And now hell dream some magic queen might try and save his life  
They say his famous final words  
Came from the heart of the man  
He made his bed on love denied  
He played Jeckyll and Hyde till the day he died  
Too late for the young gun  
To lead a simple life  
Too late for the young gun  
This is the year of the knife  
See the mountains crumble  
Feel the fire go cold  
Summer will turn to winter  
Love will turn to stone  
They say his famous final words  
Came from the heart of man  
I made his bed on love denied  
Now I aint gonna sleep tonight  
Too late for the young gun  
To lead a simple life  
Too late for the young gun  
This is the year of the knife
