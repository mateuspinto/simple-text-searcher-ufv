Heres wishing you the bluest sky  
And hoping something better comes tomorrow  
Hoping all the verses rhyme  
And the very best of choruses too  
Follow all the doubt and sadness  
I know that better things are on the way  
  
Heres hoping all the days ahead  
Wont be as bitter as the ones behind you  
Be an optimist instead  
And somehow happiness will find you  
Forget what happened yesterday  
I know that better things are on the way  
  
Its really good to see you rocking out  
And having fun  
Living like you just begun  
Accept your life and what it brings  
I hope tomorrow youll find better things  
I know tomorrow youll find better things  
  
Heres wishing you the bluest sky  
And hoping something better comes tomorrow  
Hoping all the verses rhyme  
And the very best of choruses too  
Follow all the drudge and sadness  
I know that better things are on the way  
  
I know youve got a lot of good things happening up ahead  
The past is gone its all been said  
So heres to what the future brings  
I know tomorrow youll find better things  
I know tomorrow youll find better things  
  
I hope tomorrow youll find better things  
I know tomorrow youll find better things  
I hope tomorrow youll find better things
