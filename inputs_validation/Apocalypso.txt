They say this universe is bound to blow  
But I say we crank up the calypso control  
Apocalyp apocalyp apocalypso  
  
Now Im no dancer as dancers go  
But this is one step that you need to know  
Apocalyp apocalyp apocalypso  
Well be dancing when we go  
  
Planets come and planets go  
Apocalypso  
Undisturbed the dancers flow  
Apocalypso  
Old galaxies can be cold  
So Ill hold you close  
When this earthly light is burning low  
This dance will take you to the next plateau  
  
Apocalyp apocalyp apocalypso  
Well be dancing when we go  
Well be dancing when we go  
  
Planets come and planets go  
Apocalypso  
Undisturbed the dancers flow  
Apocalypso  
  
Yes well ride that final tide  
Apocalypso  
Gone away just yesterday  
Apocalypso
