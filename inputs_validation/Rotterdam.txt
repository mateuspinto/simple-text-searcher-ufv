And the women tug their hair  
Like theyre trying to prove it wont fall out  
And all the men are gargoyles  
Dipped long in Irish stout  
  
The whole place is pickled  
The people are pickles for sure  
And noone knows if theyve done more here  
Than they ever would do in a jar  
  
This could be Rotterdam or anywhere  
Liverpool or Rome  
Cause Rotterdam is anywhere  
Anywhere alone  
Anywhere alone  
  
And everyone is blonde  
And everyone is beautiful  
And when blondes and beautiful are multiple  
They become so dull and dutiful  
  
And when faced with dull and dutiful  
They fire red warning flares  
BattleKhaki personality  
With red underwear  
  
This could be Rotterdam or anywhere  
Liverpool or Rome  
Cause Rotterdam is anywhere  
Anywhere alone  
Anywhere alone  
  
The whole place is pickled  
The people are pickles for sure  
And noone knows if theyve done more here  
Than they ever would do in a jar  
  
This could be Rotterdam or anywhere  
Liverpool or Rome  
Cause Rotterdam is anywhere  
Anywhere alone  
  
This could be Rotterdam or anywhere  
Liverpool or Rome  
Cause Rotterdam is anywhere  
Anywhere alone
