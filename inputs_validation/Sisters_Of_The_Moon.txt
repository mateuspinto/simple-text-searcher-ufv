Intense silence  
As she walked in the room  
Her black robes trailing  
Sister of the moon  
  
And a black widow spider makes  
More sound than she  
And black moons in those eyes of hers  
Made more sense to me  
Heavy persuasion  
  
It was hard to breathe  
She was dark at the top of the stairs  
And she called to me  
And so I followed  
  
As friends often do  
I cared not for love nor money  
I think she knew  
The people they love her  
And still they are the most cruel  
  
She asked me  
Be my sister sister of the moon  
Some call her sister of the moon  
Some say illusions are her game  
Wrap her in velvet  
  
Does anyone ah know her name  
So we make our choices  
When there is no choice  
And we listen to their voices  
Ignoring our own voice
