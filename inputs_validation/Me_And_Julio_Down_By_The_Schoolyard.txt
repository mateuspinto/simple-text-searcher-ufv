The mama pajama rolled out a bed  
And she ran to the police station  
When the papa found out he began to shout  
  
And he started the investigation  
Its against the law  
It was against the law  
What the mama saw  
It was against the law  
  
The mama look down and spit on the ground  
Every time my name gets mentioned  
The papa said Oy if I get that boy  
Im gonna stick him the house of detention  
Well Im on my way  
I dont know where Im going  
Im on my way Im taking my time  
But I dont know where  
Goodbye to Rosie the queen of Corona  
See you me and Julio  
Down by the school yard  
See you me and Julio down by the school yard  
  
In a couple of days they come and  
Take me away  
But the press let the story leak  
And when the radical priest  
Come to get me released  
We was all on the cover of Newsweek  
  
And Im on my way  
I dont know where Im going  
Im on my way Im taking my time  
But I dont know where  
Goodbye to Rosie the queen of Corona  
See you me and Julio  
Down by the school yard  
See you me and Julio  
Down by the school yard  
See you me and Julio  
Down by the school yard
