When I was born the doc he held me by my ankles  
Smacked my red behind  
They hosed me down wrapped me like a bean burrito  
Then marked the date and time  
  
Hats off to the ones that string the beads together  
And keep the ducks in line  
Hats off to all the ones that stood before me  
And taught a fool to rhyme  
  
At thirteen I made myself a motion picture  
Out of lumps of clay  
At fourteen I pulled some weeds and bought a four string  
Taught myself to play  
At seventeen Id get naked with a beauty queen  
At the hot tub zone  
At nineteen she was livin hard and snortin drugs  
That decayed her bones  
  
Hats off to the ones that put it all together  
And keep their ducks in line  
Hats off to all the ones that erred before me  
And taught me how to survive
