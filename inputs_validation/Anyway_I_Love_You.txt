Heres another little song for you  
Hope youll listen to it well  
Means no different than the others do  
It wont change you I can tell  
  
Chorus  
Anyway I love you  
Everyday I get more sure  
Anyway I love you  
More and more and more and more and more  
  
I have so much I can offer you  
More to please you with than most  
But trying to tie you down is harder than trying to hold on to a ghost  
  
Chorus x 2  
  
So if you ever feel the need for me darlin  
Let it carry you along  
Dont be shy and try to hold it down  
Cause what you feel just cant be wrong  
  
Chorus x 2  
  
More and more and more and more  
And more and more and more and more
