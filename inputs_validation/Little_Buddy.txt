Broken hearted and so sad golden curls all wet with tears  
Twas a picture of sorrow to see  
Kneeling close to the side of his pal and only pride  
A little lad these words he told me  
  
He was such a lovely doggie and to me he was such fun  
but today as we played by the way  
A drunken man got mad at him because he barked in joy  
He beat him and hes dying here today  
  
Will you call the doctor please and tell him if he comes right now  
hell save my precious doggie cause Ill pray  
Then he stroked the fluffy head but his little pal was dead  
Just a shiver and he slowly passed away  
  
He didnt know his dog had died so I told him as he cried  
Come with me son well get that doctor right away  
But I cant leave him here alone I must get my doggie home  
So while youre gone Ill kneel beside him sir and Ill pray  
  
But when I returned he had his little pal upon his knee  
And the teardrops they were blinding his big blue eyes  
Youre too late sir my doggies dead and no help can save him now  
But Ill meet my precious Buddy up in the sky  
  
By a tiny narrow grave where the willows sadly wave  
are these words on a shingle of pine  
Little Buddy rest in peace God will watch you through the years  
Cause I told Him in my prayers that you were mine
