Shes been afraid to go out  
Shes afraid of a knock on her door  
Theres always a shade of a doubt  
She can never be sure  
Who comes to call  
Maybe the friend of a friend of a friend  
Anyone at all  
Anything but nothing again  
  
It used to be her town  
It used to be her town too  
It used to be her town  
It used to be her town too  
  
Seems like even her old girlfriends  
Might be talking her down  
Shes got her name on the grapevine  
Running up and down the telephone line  
Talking bout someone said someone said  
Something bout something else  
Someone might have said about her  
She always figured that they were her friends  
Maybe they can live without her  
  
It used to be her town  
It used to be her town too  
It used to be her town  
It used to be her town too  
  
Well peopled gotten used to seeing them both together  
But now shes gone and life goes on  
Nothing last forever  
Oh no  
  
She gets the house and the garden  
He gets the boys in the band  
Some of them his friends  
Some of them her friends  
Some of them understand  
  
Lord knows that this is just a small town city  
Yes and everyone can see you fall  
Its got nothing to do with pity  
I just wanted to give you a call  
  
It used to be your town  
It used to be my town too  
But you never know til it all falls down  
That somebody loves you  
Somebody loves you  
Darling somebody still loves you  
I can still remember  
When it used to be her town too  
  
It used to be your town  
It used to be my town too  
Ah but you never know til it all falls down  
That somebody loves you  
Somebody loves you
