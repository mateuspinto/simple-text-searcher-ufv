How many dreams am I looking for in your eyes in your eyes  
Ooh baby bet it seems that youre reaching down all alone on your own  
Dreams are emotion baby you know you gotta try  
  
How am I supposed to know whats in your head whats on your mind  
Im searching for your love thats in your heart I need it  
Here I go impossible again  
Should I hold you close to keep the night from ending  
  
I know I put you on a pedestal in my eyes in my eyes  
I dont like it when you put me down cause it hurts yeah it hurts  
Win some and lose some baby you know you gotta try  
  
I feel it my heart and in my soul and through my veins  
Falling from my lips three little words I love you  
Here I go impossible again  
Should I hold you close to keep the night from ending  
  
Dive into the ocean baby you know you gotta try  
  
How am I supposed to know whats in your head whats on your mind  
Im searching for your love thats in your heart I need it  
Here I go impossible again  
Should I hold you close to keep the night from ending  
Here I go impossible again  
Should I hold you close to keep the night from ending
