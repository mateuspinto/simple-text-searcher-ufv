This is something new to me when you ooh coo to me  
Ooh what you do to me bop Goes my heart  
Lips as sweet as muscatel make me jingle like a bell  
Then comes that dizzy spell oh bop Goes my heart  
Jumping with rhythm and romance lit up like a Christmas tree  
Going around in circles I aint a square that I used to be  
Something new to shout about must be love without a doubt  
Baby you just knocked me out bop bop Goes my heart  
instrumental  
Got the gonest feeling all on account of you  
When I get this feeling dont know what to do what to do  
This is something new to me when you ooh you coo to me  
Odelibop ooh what you do to me bop Goes my heart  
Lips as sweet as muscatel make me jingle like a bell  
Then comes that dizzy spell oh bop Goes my heart  
Jumping with rhythm and romance lit up like a Christmas tree  
Going around in circles I aint a square that I used to be  
Something new to shout about must be love without a doubt  
Baby you just knocked me out bop bop Goes my heart
