So you had a little trouble  
Back in your home town  
Had to leave in a hurry  
Before it all came down  
So why you broke a promise  
Could not be found  
Well thats the same old story  
Cause Im a lot like you  
Its all right with me all the crazy things you do  
  
Chorus  
Lovely Girls like you  
Restless Boys like me  
We get a little angry cause weve been lied to  
Lovely Girls like you  
Restless Boys like me  
Never fit in cause we never try to  
Make it with the chosen few oh no  
  
It was another lost night on the same old street  
Another sidewalk savior coming after me  
Trying to help me Jesus he wont come for free  
I see the pavement movin underneath my feet  
I turn to look for you but you were looking back at me  
  
Lovely Girls like you  
Restless Boys like me  
Get a little angry cause weve been lied to  
Lovely Girls like you  
Restless Boys like me  
We never fit in cause we never try to  
Make it with the chosen few oh no  
  
Sailing on along on a ship full of fools  
We never learned how to play by the rules  
Learning the hard way that innocent hearts must pay  
Said innocent hearts must  
  
We got to stand together yeah we gotta face the facts  
You know the dream they gave us now they want to take it back  
The future is not ours we just let it slip away  
  
Girls like you  
Girls like you  
Girls like you  
Restless Boys like me  
Never never try to fit in
