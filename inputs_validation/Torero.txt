She was just a child  
When she fall in love  
And he was everything  
That shed been dreaming of  
She was proud to be the princess  
Of a brave matador  
Cause she knew that it was her  
That he was always fighting for  
She brings him spanish roses  
Cause she can still remember  
All of the spanish roses  
Her lover gave to her  
Torero te quiero  
Torero te quiero  
  
And now hes just a dream  
That she used to love  
Cause deep inside her heart  
Shes hold the memory of  
The days she used to watch him  
As the crowd sheered his name  
To the day he lost the battle  
And they carried him away  
She brings  
Torero  
She brings  
Solo  
Torero  
She brings  
She brings
