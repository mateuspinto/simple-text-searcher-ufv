You see him creeping around the church  
He has been alone for a year  
The sadness took away all of his senses  
He sleeps every night by her grave  
There by the bells sleeps a stone  
And I alone can read it  
And on the fence the red rooster  
Who was your heart at that time  
The fear has been skewered on this fence  
I now go digging every night  
To see what still remains  
Of the face that smiled for me  
There by the bells I spend the night  
There between snails a lonely animal  
During the day I run after the night  
You escape me for the second time  
Marry me  
with my hands I dig deep  
To find what I missed so much  
And under the moon in its most beautiful dress  
I have kissed your cold mouth  
I take you tenderly by the arm  
But your skin rips like paper  
And parts fall off of you  
You escape me for the second time  
Marry me  
So I take what still remains  
The night is hot and we are naked  
According to the curse the rooster greets the morning  
So I hacked off his head
