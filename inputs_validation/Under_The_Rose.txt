I dream of the winter in my heart turning to stone  
While the ice gives way under my feet  
And so I drown with the sun  
  
Ive been been burning in water and drowning in flame  
To prove you wrong and scare you away  
I have never minded the one back home  
Your heart under the rose  
  
I open my eyes with a sigh of relief  
As the warmth of summer sunlight dances around me  
Thats you with the leaves in your hands  
  
Ive been been burning in water and drowning in flame  
To prove you wrong and scare you away  
I have never minded the one back home  
Your heart under the rose
