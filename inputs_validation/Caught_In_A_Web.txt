Silence disguised  
I watch you  
Show me the hurt  
That haunts you  
Would you despise the thrill  
If all you hide were mine  
  
I cant hold on any longer  
These feelings keep growing stronger  
Echoes that deafen the mind  
will bury my voice in their wake  
  
Caught in a Web  
Removed from the world  
Hanging on by a thread  
Spinning the lies  
devised in my head  
  
Ive seen the path  
the one you take  
shows the truth  
for you to make  
This turn of phrase  
we might not see  
is the thirst of desire  
found so easily  
  
Try to push me round  
the world some more  
And make me live in fear  
I bare all that I am  
made of now  
Attractive I dont care  
Cause even when I danced with life  
no one was there to share  
  
Does this voice the wounds of your soul  
Does this voice the wounds of your soul  
  
Caught in a Web  
Removed from the world  
Hanging on by a thread  
Spinning the lies  
devised in my head  
  
Tried to live the life  
you live and saw  
It doesnt work for me  
I bare all that I am  
made of now  
Attractive I cant be  
Inside the Dance of Life is one  
Ill never hold to me  
You cant heal the wounds of my soul  
You cant heal the wounds of my soul  
  
Caught in a Web  
Removed from the world  
Hanging on by a thread  
Spinning the lies  
devised in my head  
  
Caught in a Web  
Refused by the world  
Hanging on by a thread  
Spinning a cage  
Denied and misread
