I am the final silence  
The last electrician alive  
And they called me the sparkle  
I was the best I worked them all  
  
New ways new ways  
I dream of wires  
  
We opened doors by thinking  
We went to sleep by dialing o  
We drove to work by proxy  
I plugged my wife in just for show  
  
New ways new ways  
I dream of wires  
  
So I press c for comfort  
I dream of wires the old days
