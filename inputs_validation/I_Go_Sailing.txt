I took a worthless trip  
Down lifes avenue  
Just to try to find a way to smile again  
While I was on my way  
I met a wise man who said  
That happiness you only find within  
I learned my lesson then  
  
So I go sailing  
Through the rivers of my mind  
I go sailing  
Be surprised what you can find  
I go sailing  
Through the rivers of my mind  
Take a chance on your mind  
Be surprised what youll find  
  
I took a friends advice  
Who said go up and away  
Take the magic of a mystery tour  
But I felt so all alone  
Though I could almost touch the stars  
I started missing things I touched before  
The tour was such a bore  
  
So I go sailing  
Through the rivers of my mind  
I go sailing  
Be surprised what you can find  
I go sailing  
Through the rivers of my mind  
Take a chance on your mind  
Be surprised what youll find  
Repeat
