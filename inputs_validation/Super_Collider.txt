Super collider  
Dust in a moment  
Particles scatter  
Parting from the soup  
  
Swimming upstream  
Before the heavens crack open  
Thin pixelations  
Coming out from the dust  
  
In a blue light  
In a green light  
In a half light  
In a work light  
  
In a Bspin  
Flip flopping  
In a pulse wave  
Outstepping  
  
To put the shadows back into  
The boxes  
  
I am open  
I am welcome  
For a fraction  
Of a second  
  
I have jettisoned my illusions  
I have dislodged my depressions  
  
I put the shadows back into  
The boxes
