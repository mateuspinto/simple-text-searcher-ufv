performed as THE SINGING McENTIRES  
  
In a humble shack many years ago  
Before our Savior was born  
A little old lady was prayin to  
God She cried My son is gone  
Hes lost hes lost hes lost  
  
And suddenly she stopped praying  
And the tears dried from her eyes  
She said But God how would you know  
Your heart has never been broken  
And God You never cried  
  
God turned His face towards the earth  
And covered it with His hands  
He said I must go and redeem my people  
And go in the form of a man  
  
So He came to Earth a stranger  
Among His own people  
Came to live with man came to understand  
The way of life  
Tears of strife were meant for He was a man  
  
He grew to love His own creation  
And when His dearest friend died  
He knew the empty feeling of lonliness  
And at Lazurus tomb God cried  
  
And then came the day in the garden  
And pilots called Judgement Hall  
And there in the dark hills of Calvery  
Hanging between Earth and Heaven  
God wept and cried for them all  
For them all  for them all
