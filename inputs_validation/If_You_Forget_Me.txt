I want you to know one thing  
You know how this is  
  
If I look at the crystal moon  
At the red branch of the slow autumn at my window  
If I touch near the fire the impalpable ash  
Or the wrinkled body of the log  
Everything carries me to you  
As if everything that exists  aromas light metals  
Were little boats that sail toward those isles of yours that wait for me  
  
Well now  
If little by little you stop loving me  
I shall stop loving you  
Little by little  
If suddenly you forget me  
Do not look for me  
For I shall already have forgotten you  
  
If you think it long and mad the wind of banners that passes through my life  
And you decide to leave me at the shore of the heart where I have roots  
Remember  
That on that day at that hour I shall lift my arms  
And my roots will set off to seek another land  
  
But if each day each hour you feel that you are destined for me  
With implacable sweetness  
If each day a flower climbs up to your lips to seek me  
Ahh my love ahh my own in me all that fire is repeated  
In me nothing is extinguished or forgotten  
My love feeds on your love beloved  
And as long as you live it will be in your arms without leaving mine
