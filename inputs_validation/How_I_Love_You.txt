Here I stand  
Before you my heart is still  
Wanting just to be with you  
Waiting here  
Long for your voice to speak  
Touch me now  
Its your face I seek  
  
How my soul longs for you  
To be with you  
Adore you  
Nothing more I want to do  
Than to sing to you  
  
Jesus Im in love with you  
Speak to me  
Whisper you words of truth  
Take my heart  
Wont you make me new  
Jesus how I love you  
How I love you  
  
On my knees  
Before you I lay my life  
Giving all  
A living sacrifice  
Take my life  
And all that I long to be  
Set apart  
Only for you my king  
  
How my soul longs for you  
To be with you  
Adore you  
Nothing more I want to do  
Than to sing to you  
  
Jesus Im in love with you  
Speak to me  
Whisper your words of truth  
Take my heart  
Wont you make me new  
Jesus how I love you  
How I love you  
  
How my soul longs for you  
How my soul longs for you  
How my soul longs for you  
How my soul longs for you
