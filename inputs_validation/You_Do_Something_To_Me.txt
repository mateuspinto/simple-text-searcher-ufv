I was mighty blue  
Thought my life was through  
Til the heavens opened  
And I gazed at you  
  
Wont you tell me dear  
Why when you appear  
Something happens to me  
And the strangest feeling goes through me  
  
You do something to me  
Something that simply mystifies me  
Tell me why should it be  
You have the power to hypnotize me  
  
Let me live neath your spell  
Do do that voodoo that you do so well  
For you do something to me  
That nobody else could do
