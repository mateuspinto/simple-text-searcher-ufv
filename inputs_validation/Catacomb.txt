Down into the dark I go armed with just a candle and then my soul  
Cryptic messages written on the floor  
Rats are nibbling at my feet I send one off to nevermore  
Too much darkness spiders on my eyes  
  
Webs are hanging from my thighs the fatter ones must die  
I see shadows walking straight and tall  
I dont know how they move dancing on the walls  
Presence of fear a presence so near  
  
I wonder what could be so powerful beyond the dark  
Human bones in little chambers all along the narrow halls  
Catacomb death over life Catacomb am I here to die  
I see a light I push some bones aside  
  
Down into the dark I go another chamber a chamber with a glow  
Could this be a doorway to another world  
Or darkness playing tricks with my little mind  
The virgin Mary is standing tall  
  
A full size figure carved in wood up against the wall  
Her face is peeling from all the years gone by  
Is it just a statue or is it what Im looking for  
I break her face and see another one instead  
  
The mummys face appears as the bandages they fall  
Dried out face with hate upon me gaze  
How grotesque the mummy wears a crown of thorns  
From the empty sockets where its eyes should be  
  
An entity of light is pouring out towards me  
And then the sound Jesus Christwhat have they done to you  
Im running for my life Im running from the night  
But its so hard to breathe the stench down here is much too much  
  
Satan help me help me God  
Help me anyone anyone who hears my cry of fear  
Cold winds from far beyond the dark  
Chasing through the catacomb and breathing down my neck  
  
Human bones in little chambers all along the narrow halls  
Catacomb death over life Catacomb am I here to die  
I know Im here to die
