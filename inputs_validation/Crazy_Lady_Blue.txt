Lost through a hole in the garden wall  
On the wrong side of the looking glass  
Call should you need a companion home  
You know you only need to ask  
Crazy Lady Blue  
I sympathize with what youre going through  
Crazy Lady Blue  
Im crazy just to have you be my love  
Hide in the puzzle you call your world  
Baby I know all about the game  
Cry when the walls of the maze crash down  
Ill come and take away your pain  
Crazy Lady Blue  
Someday your head may get the best of you  
Crazy Lady Blue  
Im crazy just to have you be my love
