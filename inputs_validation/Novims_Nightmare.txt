Once I had a dream that worried me  
Like a drunken guillotine  
Lingering just above my head  
Why why why why  
Why was I born The Nine  
Cursed repeatedly  
Who would know if I should die  
  
No one needed me  
Doo doo doo doo doo  
Dark and empty was the place to which Id come  
Cold and silent was the house my name was on  
Nine rooms and a tomb in every one  
  
Sdark and empty was the place to which Id come  
All at once my bones began to change  
I was tall and young again  
Sweet as rain falling on the snow  
Who who who who  
Who is he who am I and  
What laid in between  
  
How can I say goodbye No one let me in  
Cant see no need for Nine no more  
Now its too late to open the door
