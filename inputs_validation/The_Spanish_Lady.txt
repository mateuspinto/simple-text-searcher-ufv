The spanish lady to ming and family  
  
As I went down through dublin city  
At the hour of twelve at night  
Who should I spy but a spanish lady  
Washing her feet by candlelight  
First she washed them then she dried them  
Over a fire of amber coal  
In all my life I neer did see  
A maid so sweet about the soul  
Chorus  
  
Whack for rthe toora loora lie  
Whack for the toora loora lay  
Whack for rthe toora loora lie  
Whack for the toora loora lay  
  
As I came back through dublin city  
At the hour of half past eight  
Who should I spy but the spanish lady  
Brushing her hair in the broad daylight  
First she brushed it then she tossed it  
On her lap was a silver comb  
In all my life I neer did see  
A maid so fair as the spanish lady  
  
Chorus  
  
As I went back through dublin city  
As the sun began to set  
Who should I spy but the spanish lady  
Catching a moth in a golden net  
When she saw me then she fled me  
Lifting her petticoat oer her knee  
In all my life I neer did see  
A maid so fair as the spanish lady  
  
Chorus  
  
Ive wandered north and Ive wandered south  
Throug stonybatter and patricks close  
Up and around the gloster diamond  
And back by napper tandys house  
Old age has laid her hand on me  
Cold as a fire of ashy coals  
In all my life I neer did see  
A maid so fair as the spanish lady  
  
Chorus
