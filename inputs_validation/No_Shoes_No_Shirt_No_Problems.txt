Ive been up to my neck  
Workin six days a week  
Wearin holes in the soles  
Of the shoes on my feet  
Been dreamin of gettin away  
Since I dont know  
Aint no better time than now for Mexico  
  
Chorus  
No shoes no shirt and no problems  
Blues what blues  
Hey I forgot em  
The sun and the sand  
And a drink in my hand with no bottom  
And no shoes no shirt and no problems  
No problems  
  
Want a towel on a chair  
In the sand by the sea  
Want to look through my shades  
And see you there with me  
Want to soak up life for a while  
In laid back mode  
No boss no clock no stress no dress code  
  
No shoes no shirt no problems  
Blues what blues  
Hey I forgot em  
The sun and the sand  
And a drink in my hand with no bottom  
And no shoes no shirt and no problems  
  
Babe lets get packed  
Tank tops and flip flops  
If you got em  
And no shoes and no shirt and no problems  
No problems
