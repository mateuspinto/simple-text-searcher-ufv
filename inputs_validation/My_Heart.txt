This song was first released on the rhymes and reasons album it is the only
album it has been released on  
I told you that I loved you  
You said that is so good  
I called you my darlin  
I thought I always would  
But now youve gone and left me  
I dont know what to do  
So my little darlin  
I write these words to you  
You dun stomped on my heart  
And you mashed that sucker flat  
You just sortta stomped on high aorta  
You started going out with guys  
I felt us drum apart  
And every step you took  
Was a stomp upon my heart  
I onty hope that someday you get  
Them low down blues  
In some smokey honky tonk  
You looked down at your shoes  
Youll think about that tender heart  
That you crushed beneath them soles  
With your cold bustin stompers  
You left my head so full of holes  
Words and music by williams
