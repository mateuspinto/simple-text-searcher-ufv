Only a fool like fools before me  
I always think with my heart  
Only a fool that same old story  
Seems I was born for the part  
Its a lesson to be learned  
And a page I should have turned  
I shouldnt cry but I do like an ordinary fool  
When his ordinary dreams fall through  
How many times have I mistaken  
Good looks and laughs for bad news  
And how many times have I mistaken  
Good looks and laughs for the blues  
When a road I walked before  
Ends alone at my front door  
I shouldnt cry but I do like an ordinary fool  
When his ordinary dreams fall through  
When a road I walked before  
Ends alone at my front door  
I shouldnt cry but I do like an ordinary fool  
When his ordinary dreams fall through
