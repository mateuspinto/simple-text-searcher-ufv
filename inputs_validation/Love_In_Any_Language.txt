Je taime te amo  
Ya tyibya I yublu  
Ani ohevet othka  
I love you  
The sounds are all as different  
As the lands from which they came  
And though our words are all unique  
Our hearts are still the same  
Chorus  
Love in any language  
Straight from the heart  
Pulls us all together  
Never apart  
And once we learn to speak it  
All the world will hear  
Love in any language  
Fluently spoken here  
We teach the young our differences  
Yet look how were the same  
We learn to laugh to dream our dreams  
We know the sting of pain  
From Leningrad to Lexington  
The farmer loves his land  
And daddies get all misty eyed  
When they give their daughters hands  
And maybe now we realize  
How much there is to share  
We have too much in common  
To pretend it isnt there  
Chorus  
Love in any language  
Straight from the heart  
Pulls us all together  
Never apart  
And once we learn to speak it  
All the world will hear  
Love in any language  
Fluently spoken here  
Bridge  
Though the rhetoric of governments  
May keep us worlds apart  
Theres no misinterpreting  
The language of the heart  
Chorus  
Love in any language  
Straight from the heart  
Pulls us all together  
Never apart  
And once we learn to speak it  
All the world will hear  
Love in any language  
Fluently spoken here
