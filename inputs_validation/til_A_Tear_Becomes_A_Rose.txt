Darling I can see the clouds around you  
And in your heart I know a sorrow grows  
But if you weep Ill be right here to hold you  
Til each tear you cry becomes a rose  
  
Dearest love I know your heart been shattered  
And all my words can offer no relief  
But my love will heal the pain youve suffered  
And Ill be here if you should turn to me  
  
I deepest night when memories tend to gather  
Lay with me and put your fears to sleep  
Cause theres no pain no dream can put asunder  
All the love that binds us you and me  
  
Darling I can see the clouds around you  
And in your heart I know a sorrow grows  
But if you weep Ill be right here to hold you  
Til each tear you cry becomes a rose  
Til each tear you cry becomes a rose
