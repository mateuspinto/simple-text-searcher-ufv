  
Headin down to the river feelin all undone  
Might be for the best if I just stare into the sun  
So I cant see what a fool you made of me  
  
Well I am sittin home alone blue as I can be  
Music turned up loud as hell it hurts but just as well  
But I can hear people talking bout us Dear  
  
Chorus  
By the looks I get seems I am the last to know  
Apologetic eyes follow me everywhere I go  
I swear Im twentytwenty but I never saw the signs  
And now I sit alone and try to ease my troubled mind  
  
Headed down to the barroom to get myself a drink  
Money in my pockets gonna help me not to think  
of you at all no I wont think of you at all  
  
Well I swear that women shes like a mystery  
I read those pages through and through  
I still dont have a clue bout what went wrong  
Or why she left after so long  
  
 Chorus  x2
