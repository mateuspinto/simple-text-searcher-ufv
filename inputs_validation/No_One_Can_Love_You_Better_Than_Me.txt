I am the universal mother  
The heart of the family  
When you are born in your innocent world  
You will depend on me  
Mine are the arms to rock you  
When youre scared of the dark of the night  
But soft though the lips of a girl might be  
No one can love you better than me  
  
But somewhere in the dark there is a wall of silence  
That hides the love away that hides the love away  
  
I am the universal father  
The head of the family  
When you imagine a man of the world  
He will be just like me  
I am the lord and master  
My word is the royal decree  
I stand by the side of the woman I love  
No one can love her better than me  
  
I am the universal son  
The pride of the family  
I shine like the stars in my mothers eyes  
She can believe in me  
I am the young pretender  
With fire to bring to the fight  
But strong as anothers arms may be  
No one can love her better than me  
  
But somewhere in the dark there is a wall of silence  
And sometimes in the night there is a wall of silence  
Dont take the love away dont take the love away  
No one can love you better than me  
No one can love you better than me  
  
No one can love you  
No one can love you better than me
