He lays the needle in the vein  
And he asks the music to come inside  
Between his throat and forearm  
The melody travels softly in the bones  
He has closed his eyes  
A battle rages in his blood  
An army marches through his bowel  
The intestines become warm slowly  
Nothing is for you  
Nothing was for you  
Nothing remains for you  
Forever  
He takes the needle from the vein  
The melody travels out of the skin  
Violins burn with shrieking  
Harps cut the flesh  
He has opened his eyes  
But he is not awake  
Nothing is for you  
Nothing was for you  
Nothing remains for you  
Forever
