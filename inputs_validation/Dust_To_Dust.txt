Hey you father  
For you have sinned  
Why did you love  
Let this life begin  
  
Im not your savior  
Im not your son  
A forgotten boy  
Abandoned creation  
  
With these final words I pull the switch  
We turn to dust dust to dust  
My name is like the kiss of death  
And when we embrace we turn to dust  
  
With these final words I pull the switch  
We turn to dust dust to dust  
My name is like the kiss of death  
And we embrace we turn to dust  
  
Turn to dust  
Ooh oh  
Mother father youve answered me  
Your soulless son your thing that should not be  
A brilliant people upon to doubt  
You gave me life but took the soul away  
  
With these final words I pull the switch  
We turn to dust dust to dust  
My name is like the kiss of death  
And when we embrace we turn to dust  
  
With these final words I pull the switch  
We turn to dust dust to dust  
My name is like the kiss of death  
Ashes to ashes dust to dust  
Dust to dust  
  
Now we we belong dead  
We belong dead we belong dead  
We belong  
  
Oh  
With these final words I pull the switch  
We turn to dust dust to dust  
My name is like the kiss of death  
And when we embrace we turn to dust  
  
With these final words I pull the switch  
We turn to dust dust to dust  
My name is like the kiss of death  
And when we embrace we turn to dust  
  
We turn to dust
