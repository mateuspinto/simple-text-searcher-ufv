Did your shadow ever speak to you  
And did he say that somethings wrong  
Only a figure on a lamplit wall  
Never realized he cared at all  
Did he stop you going on  
  
Guess my shadow spoke to me tonight  
And made me throw my dreams away  
Told a story of a twisted man  
Who was playing with some foolish plan  
Bout a girl who had flew away  
  
Sometimes shadows are near  
I see things very clear my life unwinds  
Somewhere Ill make my stand  
Look around at yesterday  
And change my mind  
  
Now your shadow isnt always there  
In the light of cloudy days  
Or in circles where you hide from view  
All the dust that ever bothered you  
And where people loose your name
