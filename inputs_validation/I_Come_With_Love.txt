What was he saying  
Looking to her on the  
Night of his birth  
What did he know this baby  
Could she understand  
How did he know this baby  
As she held is hand in hers  
  
I come with love  
I come with love  
To worship and honor  
My father above  
And so with my eyes  
I say to you  
Softly and peacefully  
I come with love  
  
What was he feeling  
Knowing his time on earth  
Wouldnt be long  
What did he think this young man  
In a world of sin  
What would he tell the strangers  
When he took them in his arms  
  
I come with love  
I come with love  
To worship and honor  
My father above  
And so with my eyes  
I say to you  
Softly and peacefully  
I come with love  
  
When he was dying  
And his sweet mother was  
There by his side  
Who did he blame this savior  
Sending him to death  
She could hear it in a whisper  
As he took his  
Final breath  
  
I come with love  
I come with love  
To worship and honor  
My father above  
And so with my eyes  
I say to you  
Softly and peacefully  
I come with love
