If I could see you once more if I could touch you once more  
If I could tell you I need you once more once more  
To hold you near me once more and feel your kisses once more  
If I could share your love like I once did before  
No simple explanation can tell you how I feel  
I miss the old sensation that was once so warm and real  
Please let me open the door to all we knew once before  
Say youll forgive me and love me once more
