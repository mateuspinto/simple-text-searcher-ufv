It happened in an open field  
Down in a southern state  
And no one knows the reason why  
Some would say its hate  
They shot the guy who sold the dogs  
It came as some surprise  
And to a lady standing there  
Brought sadness to her eyes  
Shes a rock and roll widow living in this town  
Another rock and roll widow since they gunned him down  
The heat of day still hung around  
As night began to fall  
The sheriff came up from the town  
In answer to the call  
The band played on in darkness  
Not knowing what to do  
As people ran from side to side  
Just looking for a clue
