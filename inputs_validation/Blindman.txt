Well the blind man he stood on the way and cried  
Blind man he stood on the way and cried  
Blind man stood on the way and cried  
  
Crying oh show me the way show me the way  
Show me the way the way to go home   
  
My daddy stood on thata way and cried  
My daddy stood on thata way and cried  
Daddy stood on the way and cried  
  
Crying oh show me the way show me the way  
Show me the way the way to go home   
  
Now now now the blind man he stood on the way and cried  
Blind man he stood on the way and cried  
Blind man stood on the way and cried  
  
Crying oh show me the way show me the way  
Show me the way the way to go home   
  
show me the way show me the way  
Show me the way the way to go home
