J Bon jovi  
  
I was walking on a wire  
Looking down there was no net  
Now Im standing at your door  
Me and my last cigarette  
  
Yeah weve been through this before  
Too late to cover up my tracks  
Damn the fool who begs for more  
Ill take my past and paint it black  
  
Now the circus has left town  
This clown has got to get his feet back on the ground  
  
Im learning how to fall  
Learning how to take a hit  
Had to walk before I crawled  
It was winner take it all  
Now Im learning how to fall  
Yeah I got the hang of it  
  
I was standing in the light  
There were faces all around  
I put my gloves up for a fight  
One sucker punch and I was down  
  
Im learning how to fall  
Learning how to take a hit  
Had to walk before I crawled  
It was winner take it all  
Im learning how to fall  
Yeah I got the hang of it  
  
I was flying through the clouds  
Pucker up its time to kiss the ground  
  
Im learning how to fall  
Learning how to take a hit  
Had to walk before I crawled  
It was winner take it all  
Im learning how to fall  
Now I got the hang of it
