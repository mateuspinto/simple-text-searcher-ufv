I am not a pattern to be followed  
The pill that Im on is a tough one to swallow  
Im not a criminal not a role model  
Not a born leader Im a tough act to follow  
I am not the fortune and the fame or the same person telling you to forfeit
the game  
I came in the ring like a dog on a chain and then found out the underbellys
sicker than it seems  
And it seems ugly but it can get worse  
cause even a blueprint is a gift and a curse  
cause once you got a theory of how the thing works  
Everybody wants the next thing to be just like the first  
And Im not a robot Im not a monkey  
I will not dance even if the beats funky  
Opposite of lazy far from a punk  
  
Yall oughta stop talking  
Start trying to catch up motherfucker  
And all the people say  
Try to catch up mother fucker  
  
Lauryn said money change the situation  
Big said it increase the complication  
Kane said dont step I aint the one  
Chuck said an Uzi weighs a motherfuckin ton  
And Im just a student of the game that they taught me  
Rocking every stage and every place that they brought me  
Im awfully underrated but came here to correct it  
And so it aint mistaken Imma say it for the record  
I am the opposite of wack opposite of weak  
Opposite of slack synonym of heat synonym of crack  
Closest to a peak far from a punk  
Yall oughta stop talking start trying to catch up mother fucker  
  
And all the people say  
Try to catch up mother fucker  
  
When they come for me  
Come for me  
Ill be gone x3  
  
And all the people say  
Try to catch up motherfucker
