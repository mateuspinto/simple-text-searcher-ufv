I woke up with my feet nailed down  
And my head moving the speed of sound  
Had a dream I was caught in a maze  
And I couldnt find my way back out  
Some were born to move mountains around  
And some to rot away in jail  
I get an itch and when I am scratching  
Everything can go to hell  
  
And how far is halfway there I  
Didnt see you on the trail now  
But almost become Im good enough  
Should a good life be so hard won  
Is that what our dreams have become  
  
Sometimes when youre shooting an arrow  
It can fly across the sky so proud  
Well I would go all the way to the sun  
If I didnt have to come back down  
  
And how far is halfway there I  
Didnt see you on the trail now  
It almost become Im good enough  
Should a good life be so hard won  
Is that what our dreams have become  
  
Have become  
Yeah  
  
Have you got a car And  
Somewhere to sleep  
Someone who loves you  
Something to eat  
I would say youre doing better than most  
Though maybe not as well as some  
  
And how far is halfway there I  
Didnt see you on the trail now  
But almost become Im good enough  
Should a good life be so hard won  
Is that what our dreams have become  
  
Is that what our dreams have become  
  
Ooh ooh ooh
