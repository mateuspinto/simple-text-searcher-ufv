As the early morning filters through  
My shuttered window pane  
I look about and realize  
That things are still the same  
  
These flowers in a glass  
Mark the hours that have passed  
As I lay sleeping  
  
And I can hear my footsteps ringing  
Down the empty morning street  
And the concrete that I walk upon  
Is cold beneath my feet  
  
A single winging dove  
Reminds me of the sleeping love  
That I am leaving  
  
cause everyone must someday do his own thing  
cause everyone must someday do his own thing  
And I have a brand new song to sing  
  
In the morning skies the stars  
Begin to sputter and to fade  
As the night surrenders all its claim  
On shadows it has made  
  
A watchdogs hungry bark  
Is the mornings first remark  
Upon my walking  
  
And everyone must someday do his own thing  
And everyone must someday do his own thing  
And I have a brand new song to sing  
  
And Im told that if I try  
That I can do most anything  
Well then I would like to sing a song  
And make this morning ring  
  
As the morning turns to day  
Hear the waking city say  
Who is that singing
