Kids hanging out on a Saturday night  
Waitin on wheels wanna go for a ride  
Cruisin round town just feels right  
Got to get away  
  
Blasting rock and hip hop they know  
All dressed down with no place to go  
A difficult age just takin it slow  
Wait for better days  
  
Cant stop the wild and restless  
Still the ritual goes on  
Following the footsteps  
Where their fathers used to run  
  
Turn around and face the change  
Young hearts all beat the same  
The fire in the soul remains  
Ooh in every generation  
Young rebels have their time  
Glory days are gonna shine  
Ooh theres a brand new face waiting right behind  
Every generation  
  
Fashions go and come back around  
And vinyl LPs still got a cool sound  
Flash back to retro retro  
Its all new again  
Fighting wars under different names  
Losing daughters and sons we all feel the pain  
Through the tears why dont things ever change  
Between now and then  
  
While the radios still playin  
That familiar sweet love song  
We still share the same desire  
We all need to belong  
  
Turn around and face the change  
Young hearts all beat the same  
The fire in the soul remains  
Ooh in every generation  
Young rebels have their time  
Glory days are gonna shine  
Ooh theres a brand new face waiting right behind  
Every generation  
  
Some generations leave us heroes of their day  
With magic moments that still take our breaths away  
Some will inherit all the politics and blame  
And some will leave this world a better place

Turn around and face the change  
Young hearts all beat the same  
The fire in the soul remains  
Ooh in every generation  
Young rebels have their time  
Glory days are gonna shine  
Ooh theres a brand new face waiting right behind  
Every generation  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Every generation  
They keep comin around  
Every generation  
Na na na na na  
Yeah  
Na na na na na  
Na na na na na na
