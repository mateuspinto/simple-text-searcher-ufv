When I was nineteen  
I threw my stuff in the car  
I headed up to the Rockies got a job at this bar  
Sellin beer to the locals just barely gettin by  
On the tips from the rich kids their on Daddys dime  
But when I saw her walk in one night  
I knew that Id be alright in  
  
Chorus  
Telluride  
The snow fallin down  
I was wakin up with her in that sleepy little town  
In her eyes my world came so alive  
  
I never will forget the moment she arrived in Telluride  
  
We spent that whole winter tangled up by a fire  
Castin shadows on the cabin wall drownin in desire  
Confessin all our secrets and laughin out loud  
So high up on that mountain  
I thought wed never come down  
It was a dream we were livin in  
And I was the happiest Id ever been in  
  
Chorus  
I will never forget all those sleepless nights in Telleride  
  
It ended just like a movie scene  
And I had to play the part  
Of the lover who stood there and watched her leave  
And me with the frozen heart in  
  
Chorus  
I never will forget the day she said good bye in Telluride  
  
Chorus  
I will never forget all those sleepless nights in Telluride  
  
Telluride Repeat until fade
