I rode my motorcycle through a watermelon patch  
Right on the california freeway  
I took my holy Bible on my blessed boogie woogie drive  
Cause I know I know I know  
Where I go oh lord theyre gonna bless me jive  
  
Poor you poor me  
Poor everybody who buy to be  
Poor me poor you  
Poor everybody who die to do  
  
I parked my motorcycle on hollywood and vine  
And sang till my red blood turned boiling blue  
I took my sole survival and bore my cross on a string  
Cause I know I know I know  
What I dear I bear my charm to king  
  
Poor you poor me  
Poor everybody who buy to be  
Poor me poor you  
Poor everybody who die to do
