In ages past when spells were cast  
In a time of men in steel  
When a man was taught no special thing  
It was all done by feel  
  
So listen so learn so read on  
You gotta turn the page read the Book of Taliesyn  
  
Hear the song of lovely Joan  
Her sound so sweet and clear  
In the courtroom of the King  
Among children and the peers  
  
So listen so learn so read on  
You gotta turn the page read the Book of Taliesyn  
  
Now hear ye the words of Taliesyn  
On the foaming beach of the ocean  
In the day of trouble  
I shall be of more service to thee  
Than three hundred salmon  
  
The hare he bounds across the page  
Past castles white and fair  
Past dreaming chessmen on their boards  
With a fools mate as a snare  
  
So listen so learn so read on  
You gotta turn the page read the Book of Taliesyn  
  
Three times I have been born  
I know this from meditation  
  
The bird he flies the distance  
From pages two to six  
Past minstrels in their boxes  
To the waters of the Styx  
  
So listen so learn so read on  
You gotta turn the page read the Book of Taliesyn  
  
Dont take the pictures lightly  
Listen to their sound  
For from their coloured feeling  
Experience is found  
  
So listen so learn so read on  
You gotta turn the page read the Book of Taliesyn  
  
All the sciences of the world are collected in my breast  
For I know what has been what is now  
And what hereafter will occur
