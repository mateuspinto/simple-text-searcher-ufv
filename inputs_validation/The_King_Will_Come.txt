In the fire the king will come  
Thunder rolls piper and drum  
Evil sons overrun  
Count their sins  judgment comes  
  
The checkerboard of nights and days   
Man will die man be saved  
The sky will fall the earth will pray  
When judgment comes to claim its day  
  
See the word of the prophet  
On a stone in his hand  
Poison pen revelation  
Or just a sign in the sand  
  
The checkerboard of nights and days   
Man will die man be saved  
The sky will fall the earth will pray  
When judgment comes to claim its day  
  
See the word of the prophet  
On a stone in his hand  
Poison pen revelation  
Or just a sign in the sand
