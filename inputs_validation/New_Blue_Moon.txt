I dont want nothing  
Nothing but you  
Am I waiting  
Looking for a new blue moon  
  
Im so tired waiting  
Waiting for you  
Am I waiting  
Looking for a new blue moon  
  
So many moons have come and gone  
And none of them were blue  
So many times the sun came up but  
Came up without you you ya yoo hoo oh  
  
You wont call me  
Call me lonely  
Am I waiting  
Looking for a new blue moon  
  
So many moons have come and gone  
And none of them were blue  
So many times the sun came up but it  
Came up without you you ya yoo hoo oh  
  
Someday when you hold me  
Someday you may see  
I was waiting  
Looking for a new blue moon  
I was waiting  
Looking for a new blue moon  
  
Blue moon
