Stay around dont play around  
This old town and all  
Seems like I got to travel on  
  
A lot of people wont get no supper tonight  
A lot of people wont get no justice tonight  
The battle is gettin hotter  
In this iration Armagideon time  
  
A lot of people runnin and a hiding tonight  
A lot of people wont get no justice tonight  
Remember to kick it over  
No one will guide you  Armagideon time
