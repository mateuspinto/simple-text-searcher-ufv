Theyre really rockin on bandstands Philadelphia P A  
Deep in the heart of Texas way down to Frisco bay  
All over St Louis way down to New orleans  
All the cats wanna dance with sweet little sixteen  
Sweet little sixteen got the growin up blues  
Tight dresses and lipstick sportin high heel shoes  
Oh but tomorrow morning shell have to change her trend  
Go back to bein just sixteen and back in class again
