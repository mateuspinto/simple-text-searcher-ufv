You know what I need  
When my heart bleeds  
I suffer from greed  
A longing to feed  
On the mercy in you  
I cant conceal  
The way Im healed  
The pleasure I feel  
When I have to deal  
With the mercy in you  
I would do it all again  
Lose my way and fall again  
Just so I could call again  
On the mercy in you  
When here in my mind  
I feel inclined  
To wrongly treat you unkind  
I have faith I will find  
The mercy in you  
I would lose my way again  
Be led hopelessly astray again  
Just so I could pray again  
For the mercy in you  
When here in my mind  
I have been blind  
Emotionally behind  
I have faith I will find  
The mercy in you
