You may have a tabloid life  
Pay for all your friend  
You may be a suburban wife  
With your white picket fence  
You may be a suit and tie  
Paying off your high rise rent  
When it all comes down  
When it all comes down baby  
When it all comes down to it  
  
Chorus  
Doesnt everybody want the same thing  
To be loved  
Doesnt everybody want the same thing  
Why isnt that enough  
Doesnt everybody want the same thing  
  
You may be a night shift waitress  
To send your kid through school  
You may be a stubborn doctor  
Pushing for the cure  
You may be a bitter divorce  
Wandering what he saw in her  
When it all comes down  
When it all comes down baby  
When it all comes down to it  
  
Chorus
