I have given you my true love  
But you love a new love  
What am I supposed to do now  
With you now youre through  
Youll be on your merry way  
And theres only this to say  
Im through with love  
Ill never fall again  
Said adieu to love  
Dont ever call again  
For I must have you or no one  
And so Im through with love  
Ive locked my heart  
Ill keep my feelings there  
I have stocked my heart  
With icy frigid air  
And I mean to care for no one  
Because Im through with love  
Why did you lead me  
To think you could care  
You didnt need me  
For you had your share  
Of slaves around you  
To hound you and swear  
With deep emotion and devotion to you  
Goodbye to spring and all it meant to me  
It can never bring the thing that used to be  
For I must have you or no one  
And so Im through with love  
Why did you lead me  
To think you could care  
You didnt need me for you had your share  
Of slaves around you to hound you and swear  
With deep emotion and devotion to you  
Goodbye to spring and all it meant to me  
It can never bring the thing that used to be  
For I must have you or no one  
And so Im through with love
