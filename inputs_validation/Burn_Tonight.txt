Girl  
We used to be one  
I was the moon and you were my sun  
And oh  
We used to love once  
Till you deserted me to hunt down more lunch  
  
But you  
Cant fool me  
I know exactly whatcha doing  
And you  
Cant burn me cause I flicked you into your doom  
  
But still youre trying to burn me  
But it just isnt working  
  
You make us burn  
We can make this burn  
  
You make us burn  
Together we will burn  
  
Oh girl I wanna testify ooh come on and let me light the fire we can  
Make it work tonight rain and thunder when you burn 2 night  
  
Oh girl I want to break your cries ooh come on and watch you fire die we  
Can make it work tonight rain and thunder when you burn 2 night
