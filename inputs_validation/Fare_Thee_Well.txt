If I had wings like Noahs dove  
Id fly up the river just to see  
The woman that I love  
Fare thee well oh my honey  
I say fare thee well  
  
When I woke up this morning  
It was drizzling rain all around my heart  
Oh there was an aching pain  
Fare thee well oh my honey I say fare thee well  
  
Now when you wore your apron low  
You couldnt keep me  
No you couldnt keep me from around your door  
Fare thee well oh my honey I say fare thee well  
  
Now you wear your apron high  
You say you never oh you never you  
Scarcely ever see me passing by  
Fare thee well oh my honey I say fare thee well  
Goodbye woman I know I done you wrong  
Oh fare thee well
