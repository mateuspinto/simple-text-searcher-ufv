Around me many are building  
Homes of beauty and wealth  
But what of a home in heaven  
Where will you live after death  
Are you building a home in heaven  
To live in when this life is oer  
Will you move to that beautiful city  
And live with Christ ever more  
Long is the road that leads you  
To that beautiful home up there  
Is work on your home completed  
Death may be lingering near  
Are you building a home in heaven  
To live in when this life is oer  
Will you move to that beautiful city  
And live with Christ ever more  
Are you ready for his coming  
Have you been true all along  
Have you finished your building in glory  
Will you move to this heavenly home  
Are you building a home in heaven  
To live in when this life is oer  
Will you move to that beautiful city  
And live with Christ ever more
