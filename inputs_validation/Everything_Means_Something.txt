You said youre overreacting  
Youre reading too much into this  
If you think this is important  
Your sense of proportion has gone  
I said really  
  
Everything means something  
And something has occurred  
Everything means something  
All other meaning can be blurred  
  
You said we all can make mistakes  
It doesnt matter that much  
I said really  
  
Everything means something  
You see wrong our mistakes  
Common sense means something  
Not simple give you take  
  
Everything means something  
And something has occurred  
Everything means something  
All other meaning can be blurred  
  
You said oh dont be so pious  
Youre taking this all the wrong way  
I said really  
  
Everything means something  
And something has occurred  
Everything means something  
All other meaning can be blurred  
  
Everything means something  
And something has occurred  
Everything means something  
All other meaning can be blurred
