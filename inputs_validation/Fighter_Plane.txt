Stones falling down  
Rollercoaster heart pound  
Fears overplayed  
Two left feet emergency  
  
Wide open space  
Catch my tail  
Fishing net  
Fold up my frown  
Take the rage  
And smooth it out  
  
Stick to my skin  
Paper mache face to live in  
Same view to paint  
Watercolour your name  
  
Face your mistakes  
You will never have to feel that way again  
Oil your chains under rate  
You will never have to feel that way again  
Read every page  
Press the dents of my fighter plane  
  
I held the fort and I swung my sword I have muted the screams I have broken
the falls oh I have fought and I swung my sword I have muted the screams I
have broken the falls  
  
Fighter Plane  
Fly away
