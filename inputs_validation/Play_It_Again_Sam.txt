Well we read best selling novels  
So we can talk between the lines  
And we often close our eyes  
Just to hide the dollar signs  
And were suddenly pretentious  
And conform with the stream  
Were born and bred believers  
In the american dream  
  
And we drink our whiskey straight  
Though we do not like the taste  
And we dress in obligations  
With a top hat show of haste  
And we hinder our reactions  
As we measure what we say  
Until someone starts to cry  
And the faces turn away again  
  
Play it again sam  
Take it slow and easy  
Sing about the land of the brave  
And the home of the free  
And theres a man who will tip you  
Better than youve gotten yet  
If you play us a happy song  
And help us forget  
Play it again sam  
  
Well we donate to our charities  
To deduct our future taxes  
And we flock to bars for drinking  
Though one never quite relaxes  
And we compromise our standards  
If it means well get attention  
And the things we need the most to say  
Are the things we never mention  
  
Play it again sam  
Take it slow and easy  
Sing about the land of the brave  
And the home of the free  
And theres a man who will tip you  
Better than youve gotten yet  
If you play us a happy song  
And help us all forget  
Play it again sam  
  
Now I know God is up in heaven  
Its hard to keep in mind  
Sometimes when youre searching for relief  
And hell is all you find  
And I know that Im a romantic  
I might seem a fool to say  
Im know Im going to see a few hands joined  
Before my dying day  
  
Play it again sam  
Take it slow and easy  
Sing about the land of the brave  
And the home of the free  
And theres a man who will tip you  
Better than youve gotten yet  
Just play us a happy song  
And help us all forget  
Play it again sam  
Play it again sam  
Play it again sam
