Sun going down in the usa  
Down on main theres a family sleeping in a doorway  
Around the corner you can hear the sound  
People dancing around the golden calf  
Those who have not those who have  
On the billboards and the tv screens  
They got food and cars and toys and trucks and jeans  
Like a homeless childs fitfull dreams  
Smiling faces free from wanting  
Lifes abundances beyond counting  
World in motion  speed your changes  
Close your distances find your angels  
Lose your fears and meet your dangers  
World in motion  
Once we were running through smoke and fire  
Running into the sun  
In the rush of youth for love and truth  
Our deeds were done  
Now we awake with a world at stake  
And a race we run  
We run  
Sun going down on the usa  
Sun coming up a hundred years away  
On another world and another time  
Things like hunger greed and hatred  
One way or another gonna be eradicated  
World in motion  speed your changes  
Close your distances drive your angels  
Lose your fears and meet your dangers  
World in motion  
till the world I look out at this world and see  
Is the world I know this world can be  
You have a volunteer in me  
Now come on
