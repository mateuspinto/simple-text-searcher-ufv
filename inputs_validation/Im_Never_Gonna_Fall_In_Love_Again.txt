Ive been in love so many times  
I thought I knew the score  
But now youve treated me so wrong  
I cant take any more  
  
And it looks like  
Im never gonna fall in love again  
  
All those things I heard about you  
I thought they were only lies  
But when I caught you in his arms  
I just broke down and cried  
  
And it looks like  
Im never gonna fall in love again  
Fall in love  
Im never gonna fall in love  
Fall in love again  
  
I gave my heart so easily  
I cast aside my pride  
But when you fell for someone else baby  
I broke up all inside  
  
And it looks like  
Im never gonna fall in love again  
  
Thats why Im singing  
Fall in love  
Im never gonna fall in love  
Please dont make me  
Fall in love again
