One two three four Nam Myoho Renge Kyo Buddha please  
Can you help a little peasant thats begging on her knees  
Illusion fills my head like an empty can  
Spent a million lifetimes loving the same man  
  
Chorus  
Whoa Every drop that run through the vein  
Always makes its way back to the heart again  
And by the way you look fantastic in your boots of Chinese plastic  
  
Hare Krishna Hare Rama too  
Govinda I am still in love with you  
I see you in the birds and in the trees  
Thats why they call me Krishna Mayee  
  
Chorus  
  
Hoffa told us we should tolerate the people and the things that make me wanna
hate  
Oh have a little mixed mercy on me this seasoned beauty in this human
pageantry  
Jesus Christ came down here as a living man  
If he can live a life of virtue then I hope I can  
Unto others as you would have a turn  
Back here and repeat until you learn learn learn  
  
Whoa Every drop that run through the vein  
Always makes its way back to the heart again  
Every dog that lived his life on a chain knows what its like  
Waiting for nothing  
  
And by the way you look fantastic in your boots of chinese plastic
