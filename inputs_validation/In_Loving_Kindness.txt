We are a new creation the old has gone the new has come  
Reconcile us to Himself through Christ Jesus  
We will be free forever knowing what will become of us  
Thank you for the cross  
Trusting in the balance has tilted me towards righteousness  
Lifting my spirit once again sinking not in my functioning  
Inhale exhale this over and over again  
Looking for tomorrow forgetting about today  
Dying dying  
Through prayer and sacrifice into all the earth  
With love and understanding  
Now I look to importance standing here steadfast  
To renew the or Your spirit within me  
Do not cast me from Your presence  
Or take Your Holy Spirit from me
