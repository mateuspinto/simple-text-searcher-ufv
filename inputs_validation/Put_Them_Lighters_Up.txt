Just to sleep just to sleep  
Put them lighters up up  
Put them lighters up up  
  
My body is cold I need your help  
Im coming down from a perfect spell  
Can I take a hint of your loves device  
Inhale the rum youre just in time  
Your fingertips leave me hypnotized  
And when it hits my lips I am paralysed  
Cause we come too far and it feels so right  
So put up a fight just enjoy the ride  
No wrong or right just want the light  
  
Chorus  
So put them lighters up when you see me coming  
Put them lighters up I wanna see you wave them in the sky  
So put them lighters put them lighters up  
  
Up up put them lighters up  
Up up put them lighters up  
Up up put them lighters up up up  
  
Strike a match while I catch my breath  
Burn it down I see the take  
Open my eyes and let my spirit bright  
Cause we come too far and it feels so right  
So put up a fight just enjoy the ride  
No wrong or right just want the light  
  
Chorus  
So put them lighters up when you see me coming  
Put them lighters up I wanna see you wave them in the sky  
So put them lighters put them lighters up  
Up up put them lighters up  
Up up put them lighters up  
Up up put them lighters up up up
