When Im away from you boy  
All I seem to do is cry  
Then when I see you boy  
My how the time does fly  
I dont know if you need and love me  
The way I love and need you  
I just hope that we can get together soon real soon  
  
When I think about you boy  
Chills run up and down my spine  
If my wishd come true boy  
Id be with you all the time  
Wrong or right day and night I miss you  
And all my heart seems to do  
Is just hope that we can get together soon real soon  
  
Wrong or right day and night I miss you  
And all my heart seems to do  
Is just hope that we can get together soon  
Oh hope that we can get together soon  
Oh just hope that we we can get together baby  
Hope that we can get together soon  
I just hope that we we can get together baby  
Hope that we
