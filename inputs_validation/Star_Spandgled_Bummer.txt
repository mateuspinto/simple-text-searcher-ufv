Ring anvil for the deal  
We dealt us by mistake  
Our angel made of steel  
Is big enough to break  
Cause the rust is at his heel  
And I swear I seen him shakin  
But wholl be here to bring this body home  
  
The cabaret was crowded  
As her bed on payday night  
Sammy hit a soldier  
And the fools begun to fight  
We scattered like the shadows  
In the early morning light  
  
But she remained to bring the body home  
For longer than it seemed  
She loved some honest man  
Who chased her wildest dreams  
And rode her like the wind  
And they forged the bloody chains  
For some wounds too deep for mendin  
But she was there to bring the body home  
  
The barker stood there smilin  
As he beckoned us inside  
To see the shining creature that had  
Grown too big to hide  
Look here he said hes harmless  
And we wished he wasnt lyin  
Cause few remained to bring the body home  
  
Ring anvil for the deal  
We dealt us by mistake  
Our angel made of steel  
Is big enough to break  
Cause the rust is at his heel  
And I swear Ive seen him shakin  
And well be here to bring the body home
