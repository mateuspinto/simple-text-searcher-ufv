Cant believe she fell  
The silence was unnerving  
The crowd began to yell  
Was the thought of her returning  
So you never knew him well  
But you know what youve been seeing  
These images of guilt  
And the concrete in her hair  
So far  
These lions still need taming  
Its very sad very sad  
No no  
She fell very far very far  
No no  
For this cannonball this cannonball  
As desperate as you felt  
Were you strong enough to leave him  
Oh you need to know him well  
Hes an angry acrobat  
So you struggle with the will  
With the will that youve been seeing  
These images of guilt and the concrete in her hair  
So far  
These lions still need taming  
Its very sad very sad  
No no  
She fell very far very far  
No no  
For this cannonball this cannonball  
And he walked away from  
And he walked away from  
And he walked away from  
And he walked away from  
And he walked away from  
Cant believe she fell  
Well it happened in a turning  
Struggle with the will but the thought
