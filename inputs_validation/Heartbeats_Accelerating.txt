Love love where can you be  
Are you out there looking for me  
Love love where can you be  
Love I am waiting  
Heartbeats accelerating  
  
Will you come along the still  
From the river oer the hill  
Love love where can you be  
Love I am waiting  
Heartbeats accelerating  
  
Will you come on a Saturday night  
Maybe then the time will be right  
Love love where can you be  
Love I am waiting  
Heartbeats accelerating  
  
When you steal into my room  
What earthly body will you assume  
Love love where can you be  
Love I am waiting  
Heartbeats accelerating  
  
Will you come on a Saturday night  
Maybe then the time will be right  
Love love where can you be  
Love I am waiting  
Heartbeats accelerating  
  
Love love where can you be  
Are you out there looking for me  
Love love where can you be  
Are you out there looking for me  
Love I am waiting  
Heartbeats accelerating  
Love I am waiting  
Heartbeats accelerating
