Ah   
Ah   
  
This is hell in paradise  
Were all asleep or paralyzed  
Why are we scared to verbalize  
Our multicolor dreams  
  
When will we come to realize  
Were all stoned or pacified  
While the boogie men organize  
Their multilevel schemes  
  
Underqualified for love  
Overqualified for life  
Sticking our heads in slime  
Thinking were in our prime  
  
Mesmerized by mythology  
Hypnotized by ideology  
Antagonized by reality  
Vandalized by insanity  
Desensitized by fraternity  
Sanitized by policy  
Jeopardized by lunacy  
  
Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh  
This is hell  
Penalized by apathy  
And living in the world of fantasy  
Dancing on hot coal waiting for the last call  
Its adams ball eves call  
  
Wake up shake up check out work out speak out  
Reach out its time to time to time to  
To to to to to to to to to to to  
  
This is hell in paradise  
None of us wish to recognize  
But do we want them to materialize  
An endangered species  
  
Mobilize transition  
With inspiration for life
