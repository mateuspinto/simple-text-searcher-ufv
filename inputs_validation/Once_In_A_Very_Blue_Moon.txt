I found your letter in my mailbox today  
You were just checking if I was okay  
And if I miss you well you know what they say  
Just once in a very blue moon  
Just once in a very blue moon  
Just once in a very blue moon  
And I feel one coming on soon  
  
No need to ask me if we can be friends  
And help me right back on my feet again  
And if I miss you well just now and then  
Just once in a very blue moon  
Just once in a very blue moon  
Just once in a very blue moon  
And I feel one coming on soon  
  
Theres a blue moon shining  
When I am reminded of all weve been through  
Such a blue moon shining  
Does it ever shine down on you  
  
You act as if it doesnt hurt you at all  
Like Im the only one whos getting up from a fall  
Dont you remember now dont you recall  
Just once in a very blue moon  
Just once in a very blue moon  
Just once in a very blue moon  
And I feel one coming on soon  
Just once in a very blue moon
