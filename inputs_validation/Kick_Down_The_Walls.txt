Took the long way to the shortcut and the walls were made of stone  
Took the low road to the high ground had to feel it in my bones  
Everybody wants some heaven but nobody wants to die  
Its been brought to my attention  
Youll be dead a long time now aint that a crime  
  
Chorus  
  
Kick down the walls shake down the building help me bust out of this cage  
Kick down the walls shake down the building must be time for a change  
  
I went driving in the moonlight there was no place left to go  
I went digging in my coal mine when I hit the mother load  
If this world could work together like a big old human clock  
It would run on till forever it would never have to stop never have to stop  
  
You cant buy no protection dont care who you are  
Spreading out in all directions now its no hold barred  
Everybody runs for cover from the sun and sex and sin  
If you think you got the answers buddy just you come on in step right in  
  
Kick down the walls shake down the building  
Kick down the walls shake down the building  
Kick down the walls shake down the building  
Kick down the walls shake down the building
