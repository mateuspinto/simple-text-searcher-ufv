God rest you merry gentlemen  
Let nothing you dismay  
Remember Christ our savior  
Was born on Christmas day  
To save us all from Satans poware  
When we were gone astray  
  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
Comfort and joy  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
  
From God our heavenly father  
A blessed angel came  
And unto certain shepherds  
Brought tidings of the same  
How that in Bethlehem was born  
The son of God by name  
  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
Comfort and joy  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
  
How that in Bethlehem was born  
The son of God by name  
  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
Comfort and joy  
O tidings of comfort and joy
