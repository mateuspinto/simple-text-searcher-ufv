You put yourself in stupid places  
Yes I think you know its true  
Situations where its easy to look down on you  
I think you like to be the victim  
I think you like to be in pain  
I think you make yourself a victim  
Almost every single day  
  
Chorus  
You do what you do  
You say what you say  
You try to be everything to everyone  
You know all the right people  
You play all the right games  
You always try to be  
Everything to everyone  
  
Yeah you do it again  
You always do it again  
  
You say they taught you how to read and write  
They taught you how to count  
I say they taught you how to buy and sell  
Your own body by the pound  
I think you like to be their simple toy  
I think you love to play the clown  
I think you are blind to the fact  
That the hand you hold  
Is the hand that holds you down  
  
Chorus  
  
Spin around and fall down  
Do it again  
You stumble and you fall  
Yeah why wont you ever learn  
Spin around and fall down  
Do it again  
You stumble and you fall  
I wonder if you will ever learn  
  
Why wont you ever learn  
  
Come on now  
Do that stupid dance for me  
  
You do what they tell you to do  
You say what they say  
You try to be everything to everyone  
  
You jump through the big hoop  
You play all the right games  
You try to be  
Everything to everyone  
  
Spin around and fall down  
Do it again  
You stumble and you fall  
Yeah you do it again  
Spin around and fall down  
Do it again  
You stumble and you fall
