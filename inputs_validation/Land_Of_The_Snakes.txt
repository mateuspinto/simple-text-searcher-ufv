She told me Watch the snakes cause they watching you  
I told her Aw baby dont start

Could paint a picture of the game but my girl would see  
Gotta ask myself What mean the world to me  
  
Nothings impossible  
And all you lame niggas show me what not to do  
I met a real bad bitch in the club tonight  
She told me Watch the snakes cause they watching you  
I told her Aw baby dont start  
I aint looking for the way to your heart  
She said You bout to miss church while she riding me  
I like my sundaes with a cherry on top  
Make that ass drop drop drop

This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with  
  
A little Fayettenam nigga out in Beverly Hills  
Thats when I ran into this chick I went to college with  
Yeah back when a nigga was on scholarship  
Was in a rush but I still stopped to holla shit  
Thats the least I owed her cause I tried to hit  
On the first night nah I aint proud of it  
I boned her in my dorm room and kicked her out of it  
And I never called back how thoughtfuless  
Now Im standing in the streets tryna politic with her  
In her mind she calling me a misogynist nigga  
On some Bobby Brown shit my prerogative  
Nigga is to hit and never commit  
Now realizing when I hit she never forgets  
So every time I ignore the telephone call  
Saying Ill hit her back knowing Im never gon call  
She was hurting  
Now she staring dead in my face she was smirking  
Like Yeah I remember and nah you aint worth shit nigga  
You aint worth shit nigga  
  
This the shit I used to roll down Lewis Street with
