Longing to sail on  
Through the night to the stars  
On until sunrise  
Where the moon hides her tears  
All through the years  
  
If I could see the world through someone elses eyes  
If I could see through you would I cast you to one side  
And if you gave it all would I throw it all away  
Like the leaves in autumn winds  
  
From the window in the kitchen  
To the fireside by the chair  
Sat in familiar surroundings warm night air  
Under the bridges that were burning  
Before we reached the other side  
All the feelings I remember I cannot hide  
Not for want of trying  
  
And if you held me here would the moment fade away  
Into obscurity like the night becomes the day  
For all the broken promises tell me where do I begin  
To throw my caution to the wind  
  
From the window in the kitchen  
To the fireside by the chair  
Sat in familiar surroundings warm night air  
Under the bridges that were burning  
Before we reached the other side  
All the feelings I remember I cannot hide  
Not for want of trying  
  
From the window in the kitchen  
To the fireside by the chair  
Sat in familiar surroundings warm night air  
Under the bridges that were burning  
Before we reached the other side  
All the feelings I remember I cannot hide  
Not for want of trying  
  
Longing to sail on  
Through the night to the stars  
On until sunrise  
Where the moon hides her tears  
  
Longing to sail on  
Through the night to the stars  
On until sunrise  
Where the moon hides her tears  
  
Longing to sail on  
Through the night to the stars  
On until sunrise  
Where the moon hides her tears  
All through the years  
  
All through the years  
All through the years  
All through the years  
All through the years  
All through the years  
All through the years  
All through the years
