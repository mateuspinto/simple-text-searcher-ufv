Is there a difference between yes and no  
Is there a difference between up and down  
Must I fear what others fear  
What nonsense  
  
Some people are content  
Enjoying things that belong to tradition  
With the seasons they cast their lot  
Without a question  
  
Other men are clear and bright and solid  
Other men are sharp and clever and jolly  
And we go wo oh oh wo oh oh oh wo  
  
Is there a difference between high and low  
Is there a difference between then and now  
Do we have to live in pain and fear  
What nonsense  
  
People are drifting like the waves on the sea  
Without direction like the restless wind  
Not knowing forward not knowing back  
Just existing  
  
Other men are strong and full of courage  
Other men are witty and full of knowledge  
And we go wo oh oh wo oh oh wo  
  
Other men are clear and bright and solid  
I alone am drifting on the sea  
Other men are sharp and clever and jolly  
Restless like the wind  
And we go wo oh oh wo oh oh wo  
  
Is there a difference  
Is there really a difference  
Yes and no  
Is there a difference  
Up and down  
Is there a difference  
High and low  
Is there a difference  
Then and now  
Is there a difference  
Yes and no  
Is there a difference  
Up and down  
Is there a difference
