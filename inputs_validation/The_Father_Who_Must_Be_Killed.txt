Stepchild you have outlived your time  
You represent embarrassment and failure  
And the father who must be killed  
Is the blight upon your blighted life  
And his might is his legal right  
To ground you down  
  
Stepchild with every petty swipe  
You just might find youre fighting for your life  
And the father who must be killed  
Is a step farther but nonetheless  
The way he chews his food  
Rips right through your senses  
  
Stepchild theres a knife in a drawer in a room downstairs  
And you you know what you must do  
So the stepchild ran with a knife to his sleeping frame  
And slams it in his arms his legs his face his neck and says  
Theres a law against me now  
And the father who must be killed  
With his dying breath he grabs her hand  
And he looks into her eyes  
He says Im sorry and he dies  
  
Stepchild I release you  
With this broken voice I beseech you  
  
Why are lives so short  
The stepchild thought half pointing to the sky  
No one to warn me  
No hand to touch me  
And no Biblebelters to mess with me  
Mama dont miss me  
Mama dont miss me  
This death will complete me  
But where I go there will be no one to meet me  
I know there will be no one to meet me  
But still the stepchild press the knife to her throat  
Half pointing to the sky  
Just as motherless birds fly high  
Then so shall I  
So shall I  
So shall I  
So shall I  
So shall I
