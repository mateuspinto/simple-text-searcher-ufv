Who s child am I gonna be tonight  
Who s bed am I gonna sleep in tonight  
You told the other ones  
I was your brothers child  
You told the ones  
I was your sisters child  
Everytime they come to the house  
I got to change my name  
Everytime they come to the house  
I got to change my identity  
Whose child am I gonna be tonight  
As he walked away with tears in his eyes  
I felt every pain that he felt  
I cried every tear that he cried  
Mama why  
  
Chorus  
I wish you could love me the way I am  
  
Whose dogs are gonna be my friends tonight  
Whose bin am I gonna eat out of tonight  
The welfare people when they come  
To the house you told me to say nothing  
Every time they want to take me away  
You say everything is alright  
whos bins am I gonna eat out of tonight  
As he walked away with tears in his eyes  
I felt every pain that he felt  
I cried every tear that he cried  
Mama why  
  
Chorus  
I wish you could love me the way I am
