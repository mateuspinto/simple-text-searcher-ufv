I had a love that was so bright  
I used to dream of her each night  
And then rush to her side every morning oooh  
I had her all to myself  
We never noticed anyone else  
We didnt even hear the radio warnings  
Our love was no joke you know  
It was the talk of downtown Tokyo  
Well be happy forever I promised her  
But just as I proposed her feet  
Were made to touch her nose  
As she was crushed by a Japanese monster  
ohhhohhhohhhAAAAAAGH GODZILLA  
Our love was so true  
But now shes 3 foot 2  
And she used to be 5 foot 11  
Her death was unintentional  
But now shes 2dimensional  
My angel is truly in heaven  
Shes the one I kiss and hug  
Till she was crushed like a bug  
I guess its hard to see a monster above you  
She said shed save her heart for me  
But now its there for all to see  
And her last words to me were I AAAAAGGHH  
Our love was so true  
But now shes 3 foot 2  
And she used to be 5 foot 11  
Her death was unintentional  
But now shes 2dimensional  
My angel is truly in heaven  
Take it George  
Guitar solo consisting entirely of glissandos  
She was young so young  
And sweet so sweet  
But now shes part shes part  
Of the street the street  
And I want so much  
To have her back come back  
So Ill get a putty knife  
So I can scrape her from the crack  
Oh You might need a wider brush  
Our love was so true  
But now shes 3 foot 2  
And she used to be 5 foot 11  
Her death was unintentional  
But now shes 2dimensional  
My angel is truly in heaven  
My angel is truly in heaven  
My angel is truly in heaven
