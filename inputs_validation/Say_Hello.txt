I walk down these lonely strets and try to find you  
In all the same old places we use to go  
And the old friends that I meet still ask about you  
And they tell me if I see you say hello  
  
Say hello to the arms that used to hold me  
Hold me close when those chilly winds would blow  
Say hello with the lips that used to kiss me  
And whisper in my ear I love you so  
  
I remember the night when I first met you  
I knew that I could never let you go  
Now I cant find a way to forget you  
Id give anything to hear you say hello  
  
Say hello to the arms that used to hold me  
Hold me close when those chilly winds would blow  
Say hello with the lips that used to kiss me  
And whisper in my ear I love you so  
  
Id give anything to hear you say hello
