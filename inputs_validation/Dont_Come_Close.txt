You know its generally known  
You got everything at home  
Kisses out of desperation  
Bring you more aggravation  
And you dont come close  
You dont come close  
You dont come close  
You bring out your souvenirs  
Soak them wet with your tears  
You lose your imagination  
Out of more aggravation  
And you dont come close  
You dont come close  
You dont come close  
You turn red with rage  
But act your age  
Only thing that you regret  
You need more time to forget  
And you dont come close  
You dont come close  
You dont come close
