The sky is fallin and the wheels of life are grindin out a brand new beat  
The streets are burnin with the call of the wild and I can feel the heat  
Theyll call you names and spit in your face but legends never die  
Just pick up your guitar on your knees and pray and hold your head up high  
  
And on the eighth day God created rock and roll  
On the eighth day God created rock and roll  
  
Out of the ashes came the dawn and the shape of things to come  
Never surrender just carry on straight to kingdom come  
You sold your soul and virginity ya cant rape a heart of gold  
Yes youre born to rule its destiny now it can be told  
  
And on the eighth day God created rock and roll rock and roll  
And on the eighth day God created rock and roll  
And on the eighth day God created rock and roll rock and roll  
And on the eighth day God created rock and roll  
  
Rock of ages carry the news to the heart of a brave new world  
Feel the noise in the name of rock let the heavens roar  
  
And on the eighth day God created rock and roll rock and roll  
And on the eighth day God created rock and roll  
And on the eighth day God created rock and roll rock and roll  
And on the eighth day God created rock and roll
