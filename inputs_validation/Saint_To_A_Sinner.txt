You put a halo and wings around me now you say that I have gone bad  
But while you were busy with business and booze  
I lost the wings and the halo I had  
You say I went from a saint to a sinner but you cant blame me for it all  
You were the teacher I was just a beginner you dont know how it hurt me to
fall  
 piano  steel   
You didnt think that your angel could wander but Im just like you flesh and
blood  
While you had your drinkin your buddies and business  
I guess I had too much time all alone  
You say I went
