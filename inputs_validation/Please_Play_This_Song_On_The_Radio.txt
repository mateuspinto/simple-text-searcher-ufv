We wrote this song its not too short not too long  
Its got backup vocals in just the right places in just the right places  
Its got a few oohs and ahhs oooh aaah  
And it takes a little pause  
Just before I sing the F word  
  
Please play this song on the radio  
  
Almost every line is sung on time  
Almost every verse ends in a rhyme  
The only problem we had was writing enough words  
Oooh aaah  
But thats okay because the chorus is  
Coming up again now  
  
Please play this song on the radio  
Please play this song on the radio  
  
Please play this song on the radio  
Please play this song on the radio  
Please play this song on the radio  
Please play this song on the radio  
Please play this song on the radio please play this song  
Please play this song on the radio please play this song  
  
Right about this time  
Some shit head will be drawin a fat fuckin line  
Over the title on the back sleave  
What an asshole  
So Mr DJ I hope youve already made your segue  
Or the FCC is gonna take a shit right on your head  
  
Cant play this song on the radio cant play this song  
Cant play this song on the radio cant play this song
