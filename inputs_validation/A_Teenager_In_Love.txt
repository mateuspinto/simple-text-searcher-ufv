Each time we have a quarl  
It almost breaks my heart  
Because Im so afraid  
That we will have to part  
  
But each night I ask the stars up above  
Why must I be a teenager in love  
  
One day I feel so happy  
Then I feel so sad  
Looks like I need to learn  
The good  
From the bad  
  
Each night I ask the stars up above  
Why must I be a teenager in love  
  
I cried a tear  
For nobody but you  
I will be a lonley one if your to say were through  
  
And if you wanna make me cry that wont be so hard to do  
If your gonna say goodbye  
I will still go on loving you  
  
Each night I ask the stars up above  
Why must I be a teenager in love  
  
I cried a tear  
For nobody but you  
I will be a lonley one if your to say were through  
  
And if you wanna make me cry that wont be so hard to do  
If your gonna say goodbye  
I will still go on loving you  
  
Each night I ask the stars up above  
Why must I be a teenager in love  
  
Why must I be a teenager in love X4
