In the absence of your love  
And in the absence of human touch  
I have decided  
Im throwing my arms around around Paris  
Because only stone and steel accept my love  
  
In the absence of your smiling face  
I traveled all over the place  
And I have decided  
Im throwing my arms around around Paris  
Because only stone and steel accept my love  
Im throwing my arms around around Paris  
Because only stone and steel accept my love  
  
Im throwing my arms around Paris  
Because nobody wants my love  
Nobody wants my love  
Nobody needs my love  
Nobody wants my love  
  
Yes you made yourself plain  
Yes you made yourself very plain
