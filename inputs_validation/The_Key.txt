Trenchtown Jamaica  
Gave the Wailers their soun  
Like a steppin razor  
The Brother Tosh im come aroun  
Yellow Man and EekAMouse  
Dem a trod pon newer groun  
While Scratch and The Scientist  
Dem jus keep on mixin down  
  
The mighty General and Eastwood  
Draw me out of my seat  
The Lone Ranger ride in  
To rock me pon me feet  
The dreaded Flabba Holt and Style Scott  
Start fe put down a radical beat  
Wid Mistra Isaacs  
Puttin melodies so sweet  
  
Ad lib  
Refrain  
Reggae music is  
The key to ny heart  
Reggae music is  
My stop and start  
From dusk to dawn  
The music is my high
