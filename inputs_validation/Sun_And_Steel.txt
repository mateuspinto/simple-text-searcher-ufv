You killed your first man at 13  
Killer instinct Animal supreme  
By 16 you had learned to fight  
The way of the warrior you took it as your right  
  
Sunlight falling on your steel  
Death in life is your ideal  
Life is like a wheel rolling on and on  
  
Through earth and water fire and wind  
you came at lastnothing was the end  
Make a cut by fire and stones  
Take you and your blade and break you both  
in twobreak you both in two  
  
Sunlight falling on your steel  
Death in life is your ideal  
Life is like a wheeland its rolling still
