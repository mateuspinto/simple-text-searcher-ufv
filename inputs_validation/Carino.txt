Baby never have I ever wanted anyone like I want you babe  
Come and let me show you just how much I feel inside  
I got so much love  
Oh baby when I get near you  
Ooh I cant control what Im feeling  
Baby  
I got so much love to give that I would probably want all the time  
  
Carino Carino Carino Carino  
I gotta have your love Carino  
Need to feel your touch Carino  
Never get enough Carino Carino  
  
I wish that I could spend all my days  
And nights wrapped in your arms  
Spending time with you cause all I see  
In this world is me and you and no one elase ooh  
I want you more and more  
Oh baby please understand me  
I think that you deserve me  
Cause Im the type that would give you all the love  
And affection that you need  
  
Carino Carino Carino Carino  
I gotta have your love Carino  
Need to feel your touch Carino  
Never get enough Carino Carino
