Spendin all my time  
With you on my mind  
I think its time that we made the score  
Oh it makes me crazy  
This anticipating  
Cause Im loving you more and more  
  
One by one the lonely hours slip away  
Id like to be your fun and games  
Brighten up your day yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
CHORUS  
Any old Sunday any old Sunday will do so what are you waiting for  
Any old Sunday any old Sunday will do so what are you waiting for  
  
Im waitin for the time  
To feel your arms around me so what are you waiting for  
Time keeps passing  
Im yours for the asking  
Because our love is an open door  
Stop cultivating stop hesitating  
No more questions in my mind  
You can be so lovely  
Our love will be like honey to the bee  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
