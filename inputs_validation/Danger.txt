Fearing the day  hiding the light  
My mind is shocked with fever  
Evil will play  night after night  
They are the soul receivers  
  
Yeah they are strangers in the night  
Yeah theyre endangering your life  
Drinking your tears  embracing your fears  
  
Chorus  
Danger  the lair is hard to find  
Danger  so keep that in your mind  
Ripping me up  tearing me down  
My soul is crying action  
Terror is king but I got the crown  
Ill start a chain reaction  
  
Bridge  
Danger  a madness in the air  
Danger  dimensions everywhere  
  
Whispering names on lonely roads  
With eyes camouflaged in shadows  
They stalk the earth in silent packs  
No time to die tomorrow  
  
Chorus
