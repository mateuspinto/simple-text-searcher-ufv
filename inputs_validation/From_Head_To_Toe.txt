Oh well now youre the girl Im simply mad about  
Oh yes Im really glad its been me Oh yeah  
I hope that youve been getting ready  
Cause Im gonna ask you to go steady with me  
I got two eyes that happened by ya  
And when they saw you they said they knew you were fine  
I got two lips that long to kiss you  
And when they speak they say they wish you were mine  
  
Hey sweet baby oh dont you know that I am yours from head to toe  
Oh I got a little heart inside me beating  
And when it speaks it keeps repeating your name all the time  
You better watch out cause of what I say  
Cause baby dont you know that I aint playing a game  
  
Hey sweet baby oh dont you know that I am yours from head to toe  
All the way down from the top to the ground sweet baby  
  
I got two legs and I got two feet that always take me to your street  
Everyday all the time  
No matter which way I try to go my legs and my feet  
They seem to know the way  
  
Hey sweet baby oh dont you know that I am yours from head to toe  
All the way down from the top to the ground Hey sweet baby  
I am yours from head to toe Sweet baby
