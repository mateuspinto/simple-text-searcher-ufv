When the money runs out  
What will we do  
Turn around and start anew  
Takes all your lovin babe  
  
To see me through  
Without your love  
What would I do  
Cause Id put you and me babe  
  
Up against the world  
There aint nobody else  
Like you and me girl  
Who wants the money and the luxury  
  
When love and happiness  
Is all you need  
Cant you see that all youre living for  
Is dollars and cents  
  
Dont make no sense  
And all you think about in the final end  
Is spend spend spend  
So when the money runs out  
  
Well fly away  
And quit the city life and find a hideaway  
Live in the country babe  
Off the fat of the land  
  
Nothing to worry about  
No money in the bank  
Who needs the money  what does it mean  
Another roll of paper babe  in a sea of green  
  
To live life for money  youve got to be mad  
When I watch you burn it up you know I feel so sad  
  
So when the money runs out  
What will you do  
Turn to me babe and Ill pull you through  
Well give back the diamonds  
  
And well sell the car  
Well live the simple life  
And make a brand new start  
Cause I put you and me babe  
  
Up against the world  
There aint nobody else  
Like you and me girl  
Who wants the money and the luxury  
  
When love and happiness  
Is all you need  
Yeah when the money runs out  
I still got you  
  
Yeah when the money runs out  
When the money runs out
