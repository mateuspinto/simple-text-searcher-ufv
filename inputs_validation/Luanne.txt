Luanne luanne  
Why do you run and hide  
Luanne luanne  
Dont keep your love inside  
I wait around for you after school  
You slip away and I dont see you  
Dont know what Im gonna do  
If you cant see how much I need you  
We met one day and then you ran away  
Ive searched the whole town looking for you  
I know youre there somewhere  
Luanne luanne  
Why do you run and hide  
Luanne luanne  
Dont keep your love inside  
I write letters that I never send  
I keep the words to whisper to you someday  
I dont know where and I dont know when  
Luanne Im gonna get to you someway  
I want to feel your love so close to me  
Give me just half a chance  
To prove myself I need to  
Luanne luanne  
Why do you run and hide  
Luanne luanne  
Dont keep your love inside  
These days true love is so hard to find  
Someday I know youre gonna be mine  
Luanne luanne luanne ooh  
Luanne luanne luanne luanne  
Why do you run and hide  
Luanne luanne luanne luanne
