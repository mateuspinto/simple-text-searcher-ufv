Halloween night really such a sight  
All my friends are dressed up right  
Gonna have a party come on everyone  
Lets get together and have some fun  
  
When we dance dance dance  
At the Halloween dance  
Come on everybody lets take a chance  
Dance dance dance  
At the Halloween dance  
Move it all over in England and France  
  
Look over there wearing phony hair  
I see a werewolf sleeping on a chair  
He tried to be scary but he ran out of steam  
Now hes only scary in a Halloween dream  
  
Lets dance dance dance  
At the Halloween dance  
Come on everybody lets take a chance  
Dance dance dance  
At the Halloween dance  
Move it all over in England and France  
  
I see Pocohantas dancing with a king  
Shakin and twistin like everything  
Dance to the left dance to the right  
Having lots of fun on Halloween night  
  
When we dance dance dance  
At the Halloween dance  
Come on everybody lets take a chance  
When we dance dance dance  
At the Halloween dance  
Havin lots of fun with your uncle and aunts  
  
Dance dance dance  
At the Halloween dance  
Move it all over in England and France  
Dance dance dance  
At the Halloween dance  
Come on everybody lets shake your pants
