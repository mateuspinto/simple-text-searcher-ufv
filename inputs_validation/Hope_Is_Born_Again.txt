Starlight falling on the snow  
Fire glows within  
Celebrate the joyful news  
Hope is born again  
  
There is holly round the doorway  
There is cider on the stove  
And the sound of Psalm will fill the air  
As the family gathers close  
  
Lift your voices high and sing  
Grace has entered in  
Praises to the infant King  
Hope is born again  
  
Through the frost upon the window  
See the stocking on the  
Where the light reflects the cheerfulness  
Thats growing in our hearts  
  
Lift your voices high and sing  
Grace has entered in  
Celebrate the joyful news  
Hope is born again  
  
Lift your voices high and sing  
Grace has entered in  
Praises to the infant King  
Hope is born again  
  
And the hope of that first Christmas  
The day that heaven came to Earth  
Now it comes again and fills our heart  
As we celebrate his birth  
  
Starlight falling on the snow  
Fire glows within  
Celebrate the joyful news  
Hope is born again  
Hope is born again
