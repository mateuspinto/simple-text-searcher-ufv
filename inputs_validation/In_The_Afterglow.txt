Here in the afterglow of what weve done  
What remains here in the after show  
Of what weve seen  
Is it strange to be falling away now  
Or would you say we should have known  
It would end this way and both of us turn to dust  
We went deeper deeper in debt to games and lies  
We got over our head and never realized  
How when or why  
But now as I sit reflecting on your face  
In my hand  
Now I can see your picture helps retrace  
All the steps we took places we went to  
Thoughts that we tried tripping along  
On a love we never understood with no guide  
Many things were taken for granted all along  
Firm foundations never were planted  
All went wrong  
We fell down and broke in a million pieces  
We couldnt put it all together  
We couldnt put it all together again
