Verse  
To Who was and is to come  
To the One Who sits on the throne  
To the One Who has freed us from sin by His blood  
To the Alpha and Omega  
To the King of every King

To the One Who deserves the praise  
To the One Who knows our ways  
To the Truth the Way and the Life  
I will say  
  
PreChorus
