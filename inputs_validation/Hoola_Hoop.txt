Somewhere in the hiearchies Mr Big picks up his horn  
Floats a note down to the lowlands and another star is born  
Then he turns another billion and he deals a little porn  
Hoo hoola hoop hoo hoola hoop hoo hoola hoop  
  
I aint never been to art school but I kinda like Picasso  
All his women look Egyptian but then what the hell do I know  
Hes a No 1 attraction like a bottle to a wino  
You could say he was a hoo hoola hoop hoo hoola hoop hoo hoola hoop  
  
If youre bound to be a big star then you better do it right  
Got to get yourself an agent and a healthy appetite  
For some overpaid attention and a lot of neaon lights  
That right and you can be a hoo hoola hoop hoo hoola hoop hoo hoola hoop  
Somewhere in the hiearchies
