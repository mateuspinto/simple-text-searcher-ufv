The steel mill closes down tonight  
As the dying embers fade  
And all the guys are too tired for tears  
Checking their final pay  
  
Those razored sabres of steel they made  
They never got to hold  
So many sold millions  
Silence in the bar tonight  
  
And some arent even here  
And red eyes gaze uncertainly  
Deep down into their beer  
And the Holy Ghost surrounds you with faith  
  
And peace of mind  
And love is all around you everywhere  
  
Stick it  
Stick it out  
  
Were sure if you try  
Youll get by  
Find a way  
  
Stick it  
Stick it out  
  
Were sure if you try  
Youll get by  
Find a way  
  
They tell you its all over  
They dont need you anymore  
You hear him shout bring the next one in  
As youre walking out the door  
  
Decisions for so many dictated by so few  
A free man for the first time  
What are you gonna do now  
  
Stick it  
Stick it out  
  
Were sure if you try  
Youll get by  
Find a way
