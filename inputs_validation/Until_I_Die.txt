Dope black suicide  
Eyes that look right through me  
Dead white feeling fine  
The eyes are in a hurry  
Into the ensuing flood  
Look into never be  
Swimming round in a pool of blood  
A pool she bleeds for me  
  
Chorus  
Time to realize the force inside me  
Seems to paralyze and go away  
Broken and burnin  
And running the lie  
Breakin and burnin me  
Until I die  
  
Stone cold occupied  
Thoughts that I thought I knew  
When only you seem right  
I seem to walk right through you  
Face down in the comfort of  
What youve given me  
I have resolved myself  
To what will never be  
Walking next to me  
The stark reality  
Of what will never be  
  
Chorus  
  
If I had my way  
Id tear it down  
Start anew up from the ground  
And dare I say  
I want you near me  
To live inside this world so cold  
Another day  
Another kill me  
Another shot to be so bold  
  
Dope black suicide  
And eyes that like right through you  
Dead white feeling fine  
I could never hurt you  
  
Chorus
