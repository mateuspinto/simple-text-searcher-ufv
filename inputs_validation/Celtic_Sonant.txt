Celtic Sonant  
Deep peace of the running wave to you  
Deep peace of the flowing air to you  
Deep peace of the quiet earth to you  
Deep peace of the shining star to you  
Deep peace of the son of peace to you  
  
One man stood firm guarding cups overflowing  
Brimful of memories and yesterdays dreams  
He could never explain his own silent thunder  
The ocean just blows rough at this time of year  
  
And the wheel keeps on turning  
The wheel keeps on turning  
The wheel keeps on turning  
Turning around  
  
Words left unsaid may have special meanings  
Dust hidden pages fill the books left unread  
One blank page left the poet crying  
He failed to remember theres a price on his head  
  
And the wheel keeps on turning  
The wheel keeps on turning  
The wheel keeps on turning  
Turning around  
  
Away we sail with all our flags flying  
Too many changes can cause us to delay  
Each star in the sky is there for a reason  
Making it so bright for this time of day  
  
And the wheel keeps on turning  
The wheel keeps on turning  
The wheel keeps on turning  
This fool made it round
