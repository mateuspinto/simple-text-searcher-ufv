Plastic and concrete baby  
These are the facts of life  
Im a nightmare child  
Stuck on my own knife  
Im glad my mother loved me  
Im sick and paranoid  
The hotel generator  
Hums into the void  
Of plastic and concrete  
  
plastic and concrete baby  
I gotta learn to slow down  
Something new from chemistry  
Is jacking my brain around  
I have got the plastic  
And I have got the stone  
Out there in the suburbs  
I learned to be alone  
In plastic and concrete  
  
plastic and concrete sandwich  
Youd like to eat me but  
Later you ll reject me  
I m too much to bite off  
The salad on my outside  
Is made of suicide  
The guy who squirts my mayonnaise  
Is on a oneway ride  
In plastic and concrete  
Plastic and concrete
