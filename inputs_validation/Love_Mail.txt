You know your mine nears  
My songs are written all for you  
Im feeling so confused  
I cant find a way to you  
I need you almost in my life  
To flashes em back to me  
I caught you belong in my eyes  
Bleeding it easy bleeding me

We dont use no word no  
When I need to hear your voice  
Baby may your kisses chill me  
Send your flowers near to me Love Mail  
  
Youre playing with me  
Not answering my calls oh no  
And gotten no replies on my messages to you no more  
I feel like to got crazy  
Thinking of you all day  
But something tells me youre still my life  
I remain to find for your cars  
  
I need you email me love mail

When I need to hear your voice  
Baby may your kisses chill me  
Send your flowers near to me Love Mail  
  
You promise me now before leaving good  
The moment you needed my warm love long lost  
Oh yeah I am a steady in your arms  
Thought that I could loose you one day  
I run far away so far from you I love

When I need to hear your voice  
Baby may your kisses chill me  
Send your flowers near to me Love Mail
