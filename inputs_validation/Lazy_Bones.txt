Long as there is chicken gravy on your rice  
Evrything is nice  
Long as theres watermelon on the vine  
Evrything is fine  
  
You got no time to work  
You got no time to play  
Busy doin nothin all the live long day  
You wont ever change no matter what I say  
Youre just made that way  
  
Lazybones sleepin in the sun  
How you spec to get your days work done  
Sleepin in the noonday sun  
Lazybones sleepin in the shade  
  
How you spec to get your corn meal made  
Never get your corn meal made  
Sleepin in the evenin shade  
  
When taters need sprayin  
I bet you keep prayin  
The bugs fall off the vine  
And when you fo fishin  
I bet you keep wishin  
The fish wont grab at your line  
  
Lazybones loafin through the day  
Now you spec to make a dime that way  
Never make a dime that way  
Well looky here  
He never heard a word I say
