Id just as soon try and count  
The stars up in the sky  
And look for all the raindrops in  
The river rolling by  
Stand a better chance to know  
How many granders sail  
Than to measure the love there is  
Between His outstretched hands  
Oooh Gods love  
Forever on and on  
Oooh Gods love  
Forever on and on  
On and on  
Every passing hour shows  
The time is running out  
The voice of Heaven is calling out  
To a heart thats losing ground  
Though the pain in this world we know  
Is coming to an end  
The face of God In the face of God we see  
An eternity begin  
Oooh Gods love  
Forever on and on  
Oooh Gods love  
Forever on and on  
Gods love  
Forever on and on  
Oooh Gods love  
Forever on and on  
On and on Hey  
Oooh Gods love  
Forever on and on  
Oooh Gods love  
Forever on and on  
Gods love  
Forever on and on ooh  
Oh Gods love  
Forever on and on forever on and on  
His love is forever and ever on and on  
Never ending never failing  
Always loving on and on  
Never ending never failing  
Always loving on and on  
Never ending never failing  
Always loving on and on  
Never ending Its never ending  
Never failing Its never failing  
Always loving Its always loving  
On and on Forever  
Never ending Its never ending  
Never failing Its never failing  
Always loving Its always loving  
On and on Forever  
Never ending never failing  
Always loving on and on  
Never ending never failing  
Always loving on and on
