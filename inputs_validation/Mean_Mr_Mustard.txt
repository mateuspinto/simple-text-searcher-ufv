Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park  
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper  
Sleeps in a hole in the road  
Saving up to buy some clothes  
Keeps a tenbob note up his nose  
Such a mean old man  
Such a mean old man  
  
His sister Pam works in a shop  
She never stops shes a gogetter  
Takes him out to look at the queen  
Only place that hes ever been  
Always shouts out something obscene  
Such a dirty old man  
Dirty old man
