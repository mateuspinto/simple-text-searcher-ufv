Lovin lovin I never seem to get it  
But my mind is always thinkin bout lovin  
Lovin lovin I never seem to get it  
But my mind is always thinkin bout lovin  
Theres a lot of things that seem to go round  
Like the world the love and the fun  
Theres a lot of things that seem to go round  
Like the girls and the love I get numb  
Lovin lovin I never seem to get it  
But my mind is always thinkin bout lovin  
Lovin lovin I never seem to get it  
But my mind is always thinkin bout lovin
