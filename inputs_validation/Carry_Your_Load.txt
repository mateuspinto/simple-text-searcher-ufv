I take what I want  
And I got my eye on you  
Its late in the evening  
What are you gonna do  
  
I got the place  
If you got the time  
I got the motion baby  
If you got the mind  
  
So wise man tell me  
What it means to give and take  
Its double trouble  
But it can ease a little heartache  
  
So you can carry your load  
Down the long winding road  
Carry your load down the long winding road  
  
All Im asking all I want to do is just  
Put a little love in your heart  
Put a little love in your heart  
  
I know what I want  
And its close to the bone  
Sooner or later baby  
Ill be taking you home  
  
You got the cool  
But you give me the heat  
You got the music baby  
But you give me the beat  
  
So wise man tell me  
What it means to give and take  
Its double trouble  
But it can ease a little heartache  
  
So you can carry your load  
Down the long winding road  
Carry your love  
Down the long winding road  
  
All Im asking all I want to do is just  
Put a little love in your heart  
  
Wise man tell me  
What it means to give and take  
Its double trouble  
But it can ease a little heartache  
  
So you can carry your load  
Down the long winding road  
Carry your love  
Down the long winding road  
You got to carry your load  
Down the long winding road
