Come on  
She looked good  
She looked hotter than hell  
All dressed in satins and lace  
I looked at her and it was just too clear  
I had to get on the case  
I said Lady oh lady can I take you home  
Theres just so much we could do  
Ill take you all around the whole wide world  
Before the evening is through  
Hot hot hotter than hell  
You know shes gonna leave you well done  
Hot hot hotter than hell  
Burn you like the midday sun  
I asked her why she couldnt make up her mind  
She said You dont understand  
Id love to go but theres something you should know  
She showed me her wedding band  
Hot hot hotter than hell  
You know shes gonna leave you well done  
Hot hot hotter than hell  
Shell burn you like the midday sun  
Hot hot hotter than hell  
You know shes gonna leave you well done  
Hot hot hotter than hell  
Shell burn you like the midday sun
