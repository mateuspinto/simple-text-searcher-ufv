Small town Romeo kicking cans down the street  
CocaCola van broke down in the heat  
The girls in colored dresses  
They seem to laugh as they run yeah  
But they dream of only sweet caresses  
  
Come back the sun  
We will be like children  
Come back the sun  
Make us into children  
  
Black and white of summer and the golden light  
The way we touched each other in the stolen night  
The voices whisper in darkness  
Dusty shoes on our feet tender  
And on my way to tomorrow I remember  
  
Come back the sun  
We will be like children  
Come back the sun  
Make us into children  
  
So you say that Im dreaming  
Beauty is mine  
If Im only dreaming then its fine  
Incomprehensible  
  
Bring back the sun in my life  
I need your love to be there baby  
Bring back the sun in my life  
  
Bring back the sun in my life  
I need your love to be there baby  
Bring back the sun in my life  
Well you dont care  
  
Come back the sun  
We will be like children  
Come back the sun  
Make us into children  
  
Come back the sun  
We will be like children  
When I was a kid  
I could bring back the sun  
  
Come back the sun  
Come back the sun
