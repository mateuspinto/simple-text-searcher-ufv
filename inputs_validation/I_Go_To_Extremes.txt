Call me a joker call me a fool  
Right at this moment Im totally cool  
Clear as a crystal sharp as a knife  
I feel like Im in the prime of my life  
Sometimes it feels like Im going too fast  
I dont know how long this feeling will last  
Maybe its only tonight  
  
Darling I dont know why I got to extremes  
Too high or too low there aint no inbetweens  
And if I stand or I fall  
Its all or nothing at all  
Darling I dont know why I got to extremes  
  
Sometimes Im tired sometimes Im shot  
Sometimes I dont know how much more Ive got  
Maybe Im headed over the hill  
Maybe Ive set myself up for the kill  
Tell me how much do you think you can take  
Until the heart in you is starting to break  
Sometimes it feels like it will  
  
Darling I dont know why I go to extremes  
Too high or too low there aint no inbetweens  
You can be sure when Im gone  
I wont be out there too long  
Darling I dont know why I got to extremes  
  
Out of the darkness into the light  
Leaving the scene of the crime  
Either Im wrong or Im perfectly right every time  
Sometimes I lie awake night after night  
Coming apart at the seams  
Eager to please ready to fight  
Why do I go to extremes  
  
And if I stand or I fall  
Its all or nothing at all  
  
Darling I dont know why I go to extremes  
Too high or too low there aint no inbetweens  
And if I stand of I fall  
Its all or nothing at all  
Darling I dont know why I go to extremes  
  
No I dont know why I go to extremes  
Too high or too low there aint no inbetweens  
You can be sure when Im gone  
I wont be out there too long  
Darling I dont know why I go to extremes
