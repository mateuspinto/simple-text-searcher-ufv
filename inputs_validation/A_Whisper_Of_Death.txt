ENDYAMON Show you no mercy were far from the Light in PURGATORY  
Sign in the distance leave it behind     
There is no meaning when the promises are lies Ill bring you pain  
far from the Light

Colors turn and run I stay the Same  
There is no meaning when the promises are lies Ill bring you pain  
far from the Light
