Walking around middle of the night  
My enemies like with that innocent face  
Cause everything below your neck killin everything next to it  
Its murder murder  
You say I need to watch out something might go down  
Good I really wanna take this under the ground under the ground  
And Ill be down and throw it at that level  
And even when you speak regular its freaky girl I say OK  
So come on and leave me cause the deeper you take me the better  
You killin me softly but we can go as hard as you want to  
The beds way under the ground under the ground  
And Ill be down and throw it at that level  
  
Oh that girl is murder  
Everybody get down  
Oh that girl is murder  
Everybody get down  
Under the lights and sound  
Everybody get down down  
You know that shes a killer  
Watch it get down watch it get down  
Watch it get down watch it get down

You dancing around hanging out the window  
Talking real big with your little slim waist  
And with all that below your waist  
Girl you know the next scene is murder murder  
Maybe you need to watch out something might go down  
Girl your body is gonna end up  
Under the ground under the ground  
Ill be down and throw it at that level  
And even when you dress regular a freak chic  
Girl you complement my taste  
So girl dont be stingy the more that you give me the better better  
You know you killin me softly but we can go as hard as you want to  
Until the beds way under the ground under the ground  
And Ill be down to go to that level
