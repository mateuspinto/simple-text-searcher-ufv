Ah leave this man alone Ah leave this man alone  
Young girls with long faces come to me at night and stay the night  
Why am I so lonely  
Tell me is it right Is it right  
Leave them leave them leave them leave those things alone  
Leave them leave them leave them leave those things alone  
Someone said I loved you but I cant think where I cant think where  
You know so much about me  
So dont stand and stare stand and stare  
Leave me leave me leave me leave my mind alone  
Leave me leave me leave me leave this man alone  
Ah ah leave this man alone  
Ah ah leave this  
Ah ah leave this man alone  
Ah ah leave this  
Someone said I loved you but I cant think where I cant think where  
You know so much about me  
So dont stand and stare stand and stare  
Leave me leave me leave me leave my mind alone  
Leave me leave me leave me leave this man alone  
Ah ah leave this man alone  
Ah ah leave this man alone  
Ahhhh
