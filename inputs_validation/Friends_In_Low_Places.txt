Blame it all on my roots  
I showed up in boots  
And ruined your black tie affair  
The last one to know  
The last one to show  
I was the last one  
You thought youd see there  
And I saw the surprise  
And the fear in his eyes  
When I took his glass of champagne  
And I toasted you  
Said honey we may be through  
But youll never hear me complain  
  
Cause Ive got friends in low places  
Where the whiskey drowns  
And the beer chases my blues away  
And Ill be okay  
Im not big on social graces  
Think Ill slip on down to the oasis  
Oh Ive got friends in low places  
  
Well I guess I was wrong  
I just dont belong  
But then Ive been there before  
Everythings all right  
Ill just say goodnight  
And Ill show myself to the door  
Hey I didnt mean  
To cause a big scene  
Just give me an hour and then  
Well Ill be as high  
As that ivory tower  
That youre livin in  
  
Cause Ive got friends in low places  
Where the whiskey drowns  
And the beer chases my blues away  
And Ill be okay  
Im not big on social graces  
Think Ill slip on down to the oasis  
Oh Ive got friends in low places  
  
Ive got friends in low places  
Where the whiskey drowns  
And the beer chases my blues away  
And Ill be okay  
Im not big on social graces  
Think Ill slip on down to the oasis  
Oh Ive got friends in low places  
  
Ive got friends in low places  
Where the whiskey drowns  
And the beer chases my blues away  
And Ill be okay  
Im not big on social graces  
Think Ill slip on down to the oasis  
Oh Ive got friends in low places  
  
Ive got friends in low places  
Where the whiskey drowns  
And the beer chases my blues away  
And Ill be okay
