I keep drinking malted milk  
Trying to drive my blues away  
I keep drinking malted milk  
Trying to drive my blues away  
Baby youre just as welcome to my loving  
As the flowers is in May  
  
Malted milk malted milk  
Keep rushing to my head  
Malted milk malted milk  
Keep rushing to my head  
And I have a funny funny feeling  
And Im talking all out my head  
  
Baby fix me one more drink  
And hug your daddy one more time  
Baby fix me one more drink  
And hug your daddy one more time  
Keep on stirring my malted milk mama  
Until I change my mind  
  
My doorknob keeps on turning  
There must be spooks around my bed  
My doorknob keeps on turning  
There must be spooks around my bed  
And I have a funny funny feeling  
And the hairs rising on my head
