And who by fire who by water  
Who in the sunshine who in the night time  
Who by high ordeal who by common trial  
Who in your merry merry month of may  
Who by very slow decay  
And who shall I say is calling  
  
And who in her lonely slip who by barbiturate  
Who in these realms of love who by something blunt  
And who by avalanche who by powder  
Who for his greed who for his hunger  
And who shall I say is calling  
  
And who by brave assent who by accident  
Who in solitude who in this mirror  
Who by his ladys command who by his own hand  
Who in mortal chains who in power  
And who shall I say is calling
