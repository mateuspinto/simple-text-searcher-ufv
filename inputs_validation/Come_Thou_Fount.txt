Come thou Fount of every blessing  
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace  
Streams of mercy never ceasing  
Call for songs of loudest praise  
Teach me some melodious sonnet  
Sung by flaming tongues above  
Praise the mount Im fixed upon it  
Mount of Thy redeeming love  
  
Here I raise mine Ebenezer  
Hither by Thy help Im come  
And I hope by Thy good pleasure  
Safely to arrive at home  
Jesus sought me when a stranger  
Wandering from the fold of God  
He to rescue me from danger  
Interposed His precious blood  
  
O to grace how great a debtor  
Daily Im constrained to be  
Let Thy goodness like a fetter  
Bind my wandering heart to Thee  
Prone to wander Lord I feel it  
Prone to leave the God I love  
Heres my heart O take and seal it  
Seal it for Thy courts above
