I refuse to be another black statistic  
A black man who can wine and dine in the sin of the world and still be
considered a christian  
I plan on being great  
I care not to be less  
I refuse to wear a bar code across my chest  
I refuse to let a black tee or throwback jersey define me  
I refuse to let my children witness divorce  
Or make mature decisions in court  
I refuse to grow up carrying the generational curse  
I refuse to feel the need to curse in my verse  
I hate being automatically looked at when someone asks can anyone rap  
I wanna be a black man that can flip it from urban to corporate measures  
A black man who doesnt gain knowledge from the world for his own pleasures  
A black man who reps Christ to the fullest with no regrets  
My only regret is the stigma that many black statistics in the past have set  
Like going to jail bragging about bail leaving our kids cussing at church  
Married and you still flirt no father present at birth  
Animosity within the ministers of our church  
I refuse to let my people be viewed as temporary  
I plan on planting a seed not for the moment but for one thats legendary  
As for statistics  
My father broke the mode  
And I feel its my job for the next generation to continue in it  
Because I refuse to be another black statistic
