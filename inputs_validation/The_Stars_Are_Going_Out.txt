Naked under bedclothes fallen to the floor hot  
Anticipation causes slumber to withdraw are you going  
Out tonight will the evening be alright or more  
  
The stars are going out the stars are going out we used  
To be so hot a million kilowatt or more  
  
Sifting through the wreckage at a hundred miles an hour  
Searching for a night club a source of worship power  
Grabbing worn out cast off lovers throwing out a trail of  
Need or more I never called you baby made the necessary  
Motion swallowed pride for peace of mind while  
Swimming in your ocean I always had to fit or be aware of  
It or more  
  
The stars are going out the stars are going out we used  
To be so tough but just not tough enough thats all  
  
The stars are going out the stars are going out we used  
To be so bad but that was just a fad thats all  
  
The stars are going out the stars are going out  
The stars are going out the stars are going out we used  
To be so bright but now we shake with fright thats all  
  
The stars are going out the stars are going out we used  
To be so bad but that was just a fad thats all  
  
The stars are going out the stars are going out we used  
To be so tough but just not tough enough thats all
