Astley  
  
Do you ever feel like you are drowning  
Do you ever feel like you are going under fast  
Do you ever feel that you are wasted  
And you need a little confidence to pull you through  
Do you ever feel like you are losing  
Does it ever feel like you are fighting against the tide  
Do you ever feel like you are helpless  
And you need somebody who can show you the way  
  
Chorus  
You know that Im always with you  
You know that Im by your side  
You know that Im always with you  
In body and soul body and soul  
  
Do you ever feel like you are running  
Do you ever feel like you are hiding from the truth  
Do you ever feel that you have wasted all the precious time  
That youve been given all of our life  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
You may get so sad and weary  
But youre never going under  
Do you ever sit and wonder why I  
Always there for you cause I wont let them drag  
No I wont let them drag you down  
  
Repeat chorus
