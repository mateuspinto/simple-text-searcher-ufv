Seems I got to have a change in scene  
Cause every night I have the strangest dreams  
Imprisoned by the way things used to be yeah  
Left here on my own or so it seems  
I got to leave before I start to scream  
Cause somebody locked the door and took the key  
  
Chorus  
Feelin alright Im not feelin too good myself  
Feelin alright Im not feelin too good myself  
  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh oohooh  
  
Baby you sure took me on one big ride  
And even now I sit and wonder why  
Then when I think of you I start to cry  
I know I cant get upset and I must keep dry  
I got to stop believin in all your lies  
Cause I got too much to do before I die  
  
Chorus  
  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh oohooh  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh oohooh
