Aw you up against it now mother fuckers  
You think youre big time You gonna fucking die Big time  
You ready Here come the pain  Al Pachino Carlitos Way  
  
Waiting for my heart to stop I hear it beating in the dark  
It keeps me up here where I lay  
A constant source of agrivation for an overactive imagination  
Keeps me awake here where I lay  
I Will wait  
I will I will wait  
  
Sizing up a brand new rope to use it now would be a joke  
To hang me up here where I wait  
Turning on the light that blinds me to make it easier to find me  
And light me up here where I wait  
I Will wait  
I will I will wait  
  
Not the smell of mercy on me Erase the pain of what I know  
Not the smell of mercy on me  
Not the smell of mercy on meIm reaching down into a new high in lows Not
the smell of mercy on me  
  
Hey hey hey hey  
Whats been doin where ya comin from  
Hey hey hey  
Where you been hiding Been missing more than some  
Took a ride when I shoulda walked  
Got there way to fast  
Shoulda listened stead of talked  
First become the last  
  
Waiting for my heart to stop I hear it beating in the dark  
It keeps me up here where I wait  
But I Will wait  
I will I will wait  
  
4 again  
Not the smell of mercy on me new high in lows  
Not the smell of mercy on me 8x
