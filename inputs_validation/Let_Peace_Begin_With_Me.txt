Let there be peace on Earth  
And let it begin with me  
Let there be peace on Earth  
The peace that was meant to be  
  
With God as our Father  
Brothers all are we  
Let me walk with my brother  
In perfect harmony  
  
Let peace begin with me  
Let this be the moment now  
With every step I take  
Let this be my solemn vow  
  
To take each moment and live each moment  
In peace eternally  
Let there be peace on Earth  
And let it begin with me
