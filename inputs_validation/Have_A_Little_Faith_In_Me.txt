When the road gets dark and you can no longer see  
Just let my love throw a spark baby  
And have a little faith in me  
And when the tears you cry are all you can believe  
Just give these loving arms a try baby  
And have a little faith in me  
  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
  
When your secret heart  
cannot speak so easily  
Come here darlin and from a whisper start  
Have a little faith in me  
And when your backs against the wall  
Just turn around and you will see  
I will catch you I will catch your fall  
So have a little faith in me  
  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
  
Ive been loving you  
For such a long long time baby  
Expect nothing in return  
Just for you to have a little faith in me  
You know time time is our friend  
For you and me yeah there is no end  
All you gotta do is have a little faith in me  
  
Say Ill hold you up Ill hold you up  
Strength is enough so have a little faith in me  
All you gotta do is have a little faith in me  
I said all you gotta do is have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me
