Memories is all thats left behind  
As I lay and wait to die  
Little do they know  
That I hear their choice of life  
  
End it now it is the only way  
Too cruel that is what they say  
Release me from this lonely world  
There is no hope  Why dont you  
  
Pull the plug  
Let me pass away  
Pull the plug  
Dont want to life this way  
  
Once I had full control of my life  
I now behold a machine decides my fate  
End it now its all to late  
  
What has now been days it seems like years  
To stay like this is what I fear  
Life ends so fast so take your chance  
And make it last  
  
End it now it is the only way  
Too cruel that is what they say  
Release me from this lonely world  
There is no hope  Why dont you  
  
Pull the plug  
Let me pass away  
Pull the plug  
Dont want to life this way
