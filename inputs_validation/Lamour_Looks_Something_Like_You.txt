You came out of the night  
Wearing a mask in white colour  
My eyes were shining on the wine  
And your aura  
All in order we move into the boudoir  
But too soon the morning has resumed  
Chorus  
Im hanging on the Old Goose Moon  
You look like an angel  
Sleeping it off at a station  
Were you only passing through  
Im dying for you just to touch me  
And feel all the energy rushing right upame  
Lamour looks something like you  
The thoughts of you sends me shivery  
Im dressed in lace sailing down a black reverie  
My heart is thrown to the pebbles  
And the boatmen  
All the time I find Im living in that evening  
With that feeling of sticky love inside  
Chorus
