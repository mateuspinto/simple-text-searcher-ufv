Sun will shine no matter what I do  
Sun shines bright now with you  
What a wonderful thing for you to do  
Moon shine bright reflection in your eyes  
A finer place he could not find  
  
Winters cold spring erases  
And the calm away by the storm is chasen  
Everything good needs replacing  
Hope all these changes happen with you  
  
In my life never before have I lover so adored  
Her eyes her hair everything she says  
My delight can tickle me inside  
Touch my heart touch my mind  
  
No matter whats inside Ill give to her  
No need to satisfy my hunger lost in her  
And while I spend these hours  
Five senses reading  
With biggest steps Im running  
After her I will run  
  
Winters cold spring erases  
And the calm away by the storm is chasen  
Everything good needs replacing  
Hope all these changes happen with you  
  
Sun will shine no matter what I do  
Sun shines bright now with you  
Touch my heart touch me through  
  
No matter whats inside Ill give to her  
No need to satisfy my hunger lost in her  
And while I spend these hours  
Five senses reading  
With biggest steps Im running  
After her I will run  
  
After her  
After her  
After her
