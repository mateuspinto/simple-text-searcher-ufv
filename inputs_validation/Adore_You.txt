Ah hey ah oh  
  
Baby baby yeah are you listenin  
Wondering where youve been all my life  
I just started living  
Oh baby are you listenin oh  
  
When you say you love me  
Know I love you more  
When you say you need me  
Know I need you more  
Boy I adore you  
I adore you  
  
Baby can ya hear me  
When Im crying out for you  
Im scared oh so scared  
When youre near me  
I feel like Im standing with an army  
Of men armed with weapons hey oh  
  
When you say you love me  
Know I love you more  
When you say you need me  
Know I need you more  
Boy I adore you  
I adore you  
  
I love lying next to you  
I could do this for eternity  
You and me were meant to be in holy matrimony  
God knew exactly what he was doing  
When he lead me to you  
  
When you say you love me  
Know I love you more  
When you say you need me  
Know I need you more  
Boy I adore you  
I adore you  
  
When you say you love me  
Know I love you more  
When you say you need me  
Know I need you more  
Boy I adore you  
I adore you
