Ask ye what great thing I know  
That delights and stirs me so  
What the high reward I win  
Whose the name I glory in  
Jesus Christ the crucified  
  
Who defeats my fiercest foes  
Who consoles my saddest woes  
Who revives my fainting heart  
Healing all its hidden smart  
Jesus Christ the crucified  
  
Who is life in life to me  
Who the death of death will be  
Who will place me on His right  
With the countless hosts of light  
Jesus Christ the crucified  
  
This is that great thing I know  
This delights and stirs me so  
Faith in Him who died to save  
Him who triumphed oer the grave  
Jesus Christ the crucified
