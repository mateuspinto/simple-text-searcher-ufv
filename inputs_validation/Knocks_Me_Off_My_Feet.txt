I see us in the park  
Strolling the summer days of imaginings in my head  
And words from our hearts  
Told only to the wind felt even without being said  
I dont want to bore you with my trouble  
But theres somethin bout your love  
That makes me weak and  
Knocks me off my feet  
Theres sumptin bout your love  
That makes me weak and  
Knocks me off my feet  
Knocks me off my feet  
  
I dont want to bore you with it  
Oh but I love you I love you I love you  
I dont want to bore you with it  
Oh but I love you I love you I love you  
More and more  
We lay beneath the stars  
Under a lovers tree thats seen through the eyes of my mind  
I reach out for the part  
Of me that lives in you that only our two hearts can find  
But I dont want to bore you with my trouble  
But theres sumptin bout your love  
That makes me weak and  
Knocks me off my feet  
But theres sumptin bout your love  
That makes me weak and  
Knocks me off my feet  
  
I dont want to bore you with it  
Oh but I love you I love you I love you  
I dont want to bore you with it  
Oh but I love you I love you I love you  
I dont want to bore you with it  
Oh but I love you I love you I love you  
Darling I dont want to bore you with it  
Oh but I love you I love you I love you  
I dont want to bore you with it  
Oh but I love you I love you I love you  
Darling I dont want to bore you with it
