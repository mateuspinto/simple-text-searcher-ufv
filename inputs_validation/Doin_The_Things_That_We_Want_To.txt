The other night we went to see Sams play  
Doin the things that we want to  
It was very physical it held you to the stage  
Doin the things that he want to   
  
The guys a cowboy from some rodeo  
Doin the things that we want to  
The girl had once loved him but now she want to go  
Doin the things that we want to   
  
The man was bullish the woman was a tease  
Doin the things that we want to  
They fought with their words their bodies and their deeds  
Doin the things that we want to  
When they finished fighting they excited the stage  
Doin the things that we want to  
I was firmly struck by the way they had behaved  
Doin the things that we want to   
  
It reminds me of the movies Marty made about New York  
Doin the things that we want to  
Those frank and brutal movies that are so brilliant  
Doin the things that we want to  
Fool For Love meet The Raging Bull  
Doin the things that we want to  
Theyre very inspirational I love the things they do  
Doin the things that we want to   
  
Theres not much you hear on the radio today  
Doin the things that we want to  
But you still can see a movie or a play  
Doin the things that we want to  
Heres to Travis Bickle and heres Johnny Boy  
Doin the things that we want to  
Growing up in the mean streets of New York  
Doin the things that we want to  
  
I wrote this song cause Id like to shake your hand  
Doin the things that we want to  
In a way you guys are the best friends I ever had  
Doin the things that we want to
