Facing the world aint easy when there isnt anything going  
Standing at the corner waiting watching time go by  
Will I go to work today or shall I bide my time  
Cause when I see that union man walking down the street  
Hes the man who decides if I live or I die if I starve or I eat  
Then he walks up to me and the sun begins to shine  
Then he walks right past and I know that Ive got to get back in the line  
Now I think of what my mamma told me  
She always said that it would never ever work out  
But all I want to do is make some money  
And bring you home some wine  
For I dont ever want you to see me  
Standing in that line  
Cause that union mans got such a hold over me  
Hes the man who decides if I live or I die if I starve or I eat  
Then he walks up to me and the sun begins to shine  
Then he walks right past and I know that Ive got to get back in the line
