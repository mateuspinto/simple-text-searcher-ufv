Starry nights city lights  
Coming down over me  
Skyscrapers and stargazers  
In my head  
Are we we are are we we are  
The waiting unknown  
This dirty town was burning down in my dreams  
Lost and found city bound in my dreams  
  
And screaming  
Are we we are are we we are the waiting  
And screaming  
Are we we are are we we are the waiting  
  
Forget me nots and second thoughts  
Live in isolation  
Heads or tails and fairy tales in my mind  
Are we we are are we we are the waiting unknown  
The rage and love the story of my life  
The Jesus of suburbia is a lie  
  
And screaming  
Are we we are are we we are the waiting  
And screaming  
Are we we are are we we are the waiting  
And screaming  
Are we we are are we we are the waiting  
And screaming  
Are we we are are we we are the waiting  
Ohh  
Are we we are are we we are the waiting  
Ohh  
Are we we are are we we are the waiting
