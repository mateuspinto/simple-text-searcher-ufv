Robin in the rain  
Such a saucy fellow  
Robin in the rain  
Mind your socks of yellow  
Running in the garden on your nimble feet  
Digging for your dinner with your long strong beak  
Robin in the rain  
You dont mind the weather  
Showers always make you gay  
Bet the worms are wishing you would stay at home  
Robin on a rainy day  dont get your feet wet  
Robin on a rainy day
