Amazing love no other shall I need  
Your name brings life more than the air I breathe  
  
My world was changed when your life gave for me  
My purpose found in all that you are for me  
  
Chorus  
And I found myself in You  
And I found myself in You  
  
Amazing love no other shall I need  
Your name brings life more than the air I breathe  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Take me to the place where I can see you face to face  
All I want to do  
All I want to do is worship You  
Take me to the place where I can see you face to face  
All I want to do  
All I want to do is worship You  
  
Is worship You  
You are worthy  
  
I will live  
All my days  
To worship you  
I will live  
All my days  
To worship you  
  
Chorus x2
