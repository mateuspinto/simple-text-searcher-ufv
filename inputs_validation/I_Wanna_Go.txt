Lately I been stuck imagining  
What I wanna do and what I really think  
Time to flow out  
Be a little inappropriate  
Cause I know that everybodys thinkin it  
When the lights out  
  
Shame on me  
To need release  
Uncontrollably  
  
Chorus x2  
I wanna go all the way  
Taking out my freak tonight  
I wanna show  
All the dirt  
I am running through my mind  
  
Lately people got me all tied up  
Theres a countdown waiting for me to erupt  
Time to blow out  
Ive been told who I should do it with  
To keep both my hands above the blanket  
When the lights out  
  
Shame on me  
To need release  
Uncontrollably  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Shame on me shame on me  
To need release to need release  
Uncontrollably uncontrollably  
  
Chorus x2
