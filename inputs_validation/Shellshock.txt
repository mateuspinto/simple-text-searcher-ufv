Thats the way Shellshock  
Hold onIts never enough  
Its never enough until your heart stops beating  
The deeper you get the sweeter the pain  
Dont give up the game until your heart stops beating  
  
You call me on the phone you left me all alone  
All I get from you is shellshock  
Another day goes by and all I do is cry  
All I get from you is shellshock  
Id tell the world and save my soul  
But rain falls down and I feel cold  
A cold that sleeps within my heart  
It tears the earth and sun apart  
But thats the way that I can win  
A victim of your evil sin  
Youve lost the hold youve had on me  
By causing the changes that you never see  
Hold on Its never enough  
Its never enough until your heart stops beating  
The deeper you get the sweeter the pain  
Dont give up the game until your heart stops beating  
  
When we walk through open doorways  
Counting time in one or more ways  
We cant find our peace of mind  
And life becomes a life of crime  
And thats the day I call your name  
I came to you I called in vain  
You lost the faith within your heart  
The fire in your soul from the end to the start  
Hold onIts never enough  
Its never enough until your heart stops beating  
The deeper you get the sweeter the pain  
Dont give up the game until your heart stops beating  
  
Ive been good and Ive been bad  
But common sense Ive never had  
No matter how I try and try  
I hide the truth behind a lie  
But thats the way that I can win  
A victim of your evil sin  
You lost the faith within your heart  
The fire in your soul from the end to the start  
Hold onIts never enough  
Its never enough until your heart stops beating  
The deeper you get the sweeter the pain  
Dont give up the game until your heart stops beating
