All day I sit till dawn just thinkin about your smile I see you in my dreams
how you complete me the flowers you left me here still wilt on the shelf by
the phone you took a part of me all the tears Ive cried for you Its day by
day for me the only way I get by I keep talking in my sleep as if you will
stay right by my side baby  
  
Chorus  
How could you leave and leave here with me all of the precious memories just
left me behind and how my heart cries without you Im so lost baby I still
cant believe that you could just leave standing alone the misery just left me
behind to find this Come back baby  
  
I pray I call your name still wishing that you would come home  
Nothing comforts me But if you could hold me  
My world would start to turn for a moment that things would be right  
Can you hear me  
Baby dont you need me too  
Are you afraid of me Please tell me how love passed us by  
Right now Ill do anything just to have you right back in my life  
Baby  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
All of the pain and the hurt trapped inside keeps pulling me down and God
knows how I try  
So hard when you love someone the way that I love you  
Please come back  
We can talk it out loud the time and space my love away from you  
  
Its day by day for me the only way I get by  
I keep talking in my sleep as if you were still right by my side  
Baby
