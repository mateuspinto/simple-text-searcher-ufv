I took off last night with my coat and my intention  
To make connections with the eyes that left me blind  
Left my love for the strength of that white white line  
I left one more time I could have heard I love you  
One more time I could have heard I care  
One more time when I needed that emotion  
One more time I wasnt even there  
  
Through the darkness and the distance  
Lie champagne and smoky smiles  
Bounded by the sorrow having lost love to the miles  
I feel you  
Youre not a stranger to this white white line  
I watched your eyes chose words so slowly  
Illusions to my view  
But I laugh and say its highway 75 that draws me here  
Its not me and its not you  
There was one more time when I should have said I love you  
One more time when I should have told you I care  
When we sit here in silence  
And we miss the ones we love that cant be here  
Its the love we leave behind  
  
I tried to lose this restless spirit in a mission of regrets  
But I cant survive without this war  
And your eyes reflect the visions that I cant forget  
I find balance on a darkened highway  
I find truth by the side of the road  
And someone elses tune to lift me high above the line  
That leaves me running from the cold  
Running from the cold  
Running from the cold
