Since I reached the charming age of puberty  
And began to think of feminine curls  
Like a show thats typically Shuberty  
I have always had a multitude of girls  
But now that a married man at last am I  
How aware of my dear departed past am I  
Where is the life that late I led  
Where is it now Totally dead  
Where is the fun I used to find  
Where has it gone Gone with the wind  
A married life may all be well  
But raising an heir could never compare  
With raising a bit of hell  
So I repeat what first I said  
Where is the life that late I  
In dear Milano where are you Momo  
Still selling those pictures of the scriptures in the duomo  
And Carolina where are you lina  
Still peddling your pizza in the streetsa Toremina  
And in Firenze where are you Alice  
Still there in your pretty ittybitty pity palace  
And sweet Lucretia so young and gay  
What scandalous doings in the ruins of Pompeii  
Where is the life that late I led  
Where is it now Totally dead  
Where is the fun I used to find  
Where has it gone Gone with the wind  
The marriage game is quite all right  
Yes during the day its easy to play  
But oh what a bore at night  
So I repeat what first I said  
Where is the life that late I  
Where is Rebecca My Beckyweckyoh  
Could still she be cruising that amusing Pontevecchio  
Where is Fedora the wild virago  
Its lucky I missed her gangster sister from Chicago  
Where is Venetia who loved to chat so  
Could still she be drinking in her stinking pink palazzo  
And lovely Lisa where are you Lisa  
You gave a new meaning to the Leaning Tower of Piza  
Where is the life that late I led  
Where is it now Totally dead  
Where is the fun I used to find  
Where has it gone Gone with the wind  
Ive oft been told of nuptial bliss  
But what do you do at quarter to two  
With only a shrew to kiss  
So I repeat what first I said  
Where is the life that late I led
