I remember somewhere in the rain  
the faces of the passersby staring faces broken blinds  
I recall the situation clearly standing in a crowded car  
I can feel the need in me  
  
Hold on nightrider baby hold on youre a nightrider  
Riding the night searching for what is gone  
Never reaching the end so you must travel on  
  
I still see that vision of delight  
While cruising on the black of night  
but she keeps a step ahead  
Looking out the corner of her world nobody ever knows a girl  
who once lived along this way  
  
Hold on nightrider baby hold on youre a nightrider  
Riding the night searching for what is gone  
Never reaching the end so you must travel on  
  
Desolation degradation row  
Go on dont let the feeling show  
Shes a ten a penny dream  
Faces with no name no address keep staring in on my distress  
But she kills me with her smile  
  
Hold on nightrider baby hold on youre a nightrider  
Riding the night searching for what is gone  
Never reaching the end so you must travel on
