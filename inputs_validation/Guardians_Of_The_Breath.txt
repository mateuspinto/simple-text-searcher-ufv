They were guardians of the breath  
Trusted with those precious chances  
Keeping gaia from the fear of death  
Balances must be defended  
  
To take only what they must  
borrowed from the future  
Live in lovers of a global home  
our children will remember  
  
Guardians slept while comfort came  
The vapours poison the acid rain fell  
The spirit cut from earthly bounds  
The creature stirred the pain  
  
How much abuse can she take  
awake from your dreamtime  
The lines are drawn our justice awaits  
will the guardians surrender  
  
The forest bare a desert born  
The life pushed out  
They sold her cheaply  
All for a shilling for next weeks treat  
A marvel that had taken ten thousand years  
  
To take only what they must  
borrowed from the future  
Live in lovers of a global home  
our children will remember  
  
They are guardians of the breath  
Trusted with those precious chances  
They are guardians of the breath  
Balances must be defended
