Now my grandfather was a sailor  
He blew in off the water  
My father was a farmer and I  
His only daughter  
Took up with a no good millworking man  
From Massachusetts  
Who dies from too much whiskey  
And leaves me these three faces to feed  
  
Millwork aint easy millwork aint hard  
Millwork it aint nothing  
But an awful boring job  
Im waiting for a daydream  
To take me through the morning  
And put me in my coffee break  
Where I can have a sandwich and remember  
  
Then its me and my machine  
For the rest of the morning  
For the rest of the afternoon  
And the rest of my life  
  
Now my mind begins to wander  
To the days back on the farm  
I can see my father smiling at me  
Swinging on his arm  
I can hear my granddads stories  
Of the storms out on Lake Erie  
Where vessels and cargoes and fortunes  
And sailors lives were lost  
  
Yes but its my life has been wasted  
And I have been the fool  
To let this manufacturer  
Use my body for a tool  
I can ride home in the evening  
Staring at my hands  
Swearing by my sorrow  
That a young girl  
Ought to stand a better chance  
  
So may I work the mills  
Just as long as I am able  
And never meet the man  
Whose name is on the label  
  
It be me and my machine  
For the rest of the morning  
And the rest of the afternoon  
Gone for the rest of my life
