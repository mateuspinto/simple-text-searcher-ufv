Headed down lifes crooked road lot of things I never knowed  
And because of me not knowin I now pine  
Trouble got in the trail spent the next five years in jail  
Should have read that detour sign  
Detour theres a muddy road ahead detour paid no mind to what it said  
Detour oh the bitter things I find should have read that detour sign  
  
I got stuck in the mud all my hopes dropped with a thud  
And I thought that my heart strings were made of twine  
But the father I go the more sorrow I know should have read that detour sign  
Detour theres a muddy road ahead  
Should have read that detour sign should have read that detour sign
