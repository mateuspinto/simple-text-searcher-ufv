I sang the song slowly  
As she stood in the shadows  
She stepped to the light  
As my silver strings spun  
She called with her eyes  
To the tune Is aplayin  
But the song it was long  
And Id only begun  
  
Through a bullet of light  
Her face was reflectin  
The fast fading words  
That rolled from my tongue  
With a longdistance look  
Her eyes was on fire  
But the song it was long  
And there was more to be sung  
  
My eyes danced a circle  
Across her clear outline  
With her head tilted sideways  
She called me again  
As the tune drifted out  
She breathed hard through the echo  
But the song it was long  
And it was far to the end  
  
I glanced at my guitar  
And played it pretendin  
That of all the eyes out there  
I could see none  
As her thoughts pounded hard  
Like the pierce of an arrow  
But the song it was long  
And it had to get done  
  
As the tune finally folded  
I laid down the guitar  
Then looked for the girl  
Whod stayed for so long  
But her shadow was missin  
For all of my searchin  
So I picked up my guitar  
And began the next song
