Bonnie RaittTrinkets  
Emory Joseph  
When I was a kid  
I had a little record  
I played it over and over  
Each and every day  
Sung by a man  
Named Louie Armstrong  
Saints marched right in from my Close and Play  
When I was a kid  
I had a little picture  
And I looked at that picture  
All the time  
Painted by a man  
Mama said his name was Vinnie  
A farmer sowing seeds on a really nice day  
Mom and daddies get a good idea what your babies like  
To help em be happy  
Like that guy named Mike  
Yeah that groovy old man that fixes my bike  
Down there on Dumaine Street New Orleans Louisiana  
When I was a kid  
I had a little wiener dog  
I loved that little wiener dog  
And she loved me  
Spent warm spring days feeding that little wiener dog  
Ripe sweet cherries from our cherry tree  
An if I ever get older if I ever die  
If I get to a gate at the end of the sky  
And a beautiful creature says  
Now Bonnie what do you want  
Might say a record and a picture and a wiener dog swear to God  
Mom and daddies get a good idea what your babies want  
To help em be happy  
Like that ol gal named Betty  
Yeah that groovy old chick teaches TaiChi on the levee  
Rain or shine shes out there shes dedicated  
She wrinkled but she  
Lovely  
She flexible and dont you wish we all were flexible enough to  
Dance now  
Dance little children now  
The whole round world is your neighborhood  
Dance little children now  
Nekkid as a Jaybird  
Dance little children now  
The whole round world is your neighborhood  
Dance little children now  
Nekkid as a Jaybird  
Theyre just trinkets  
Little stepping stones  
To let you know you was here
