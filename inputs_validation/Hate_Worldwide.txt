I stab you right between the eyes  
You awaken from the lies  
I said it ever since the inception  
Where the masters of deception  
Im a godless heretic  
Not a godfearing lunatic  
Thats why its become my obsession  
To treat God like an infection  
  
My scars insane my life profane  
I deny defy and spread a little hate worldwide  
  
Like a storm that devastates  
Religious power instigate  
Take religion to my confession  
There is no filter on my aggression  
With a blister open wide  
To keep the massacre alive  
I got cold devastation  
With my moral imperfection  
  
My scars insane my life profane  
I deny defy and spread a little hate worldwide  
  
Religious death I instigate  
From what the bible demonstrates  
Does it document creation  
Of this hopeless infliction  
Of a godless heretic  
Not a godfearing lunatic  
Not a godfearing lunatic  
Thats why its become my obsession  
To treat God like an infection  
  
My scars insane my life profane  
I deny defy and spread a little hate worldwide  
  
Open life scars crushing open wounds  
The walls of this scene will be crashing at you  
You left senseless mentally unfit  
Never fucking heard from you again  
Never fucking heard from again
