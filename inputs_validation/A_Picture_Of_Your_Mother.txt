My little girl and I lost Mama just three years ago  
And now that she is older there are things she wants to know  
She said Please Daddy tell me bout my mother cause I miss her  
I said Get pen and paper and Ill help your draw her picture  
I said First draw a heart so big theres room for little else  
Then write a million for the things that she denied herself  
Draw a rose the kind of which therell never be another  
And when you finish you will have a picture of your mother  
If you want to make the picture even more complete  
You could draw a little cottage draw it nice and neat  
Draw a bright and shining sun up in the sky above  
But then again I guess its pretty hard to draw my love  
So draw a heart so big that there is room for little else  
Write a million for the things that she denied herself  
Draw a rose the kind of which therell never be another  
And when you finish you will have a picture of your mother
