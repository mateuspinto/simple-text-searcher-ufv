Eyes of silver hungry and aware  
Eyes of silver your mystic love I share  
Cause Im hungry baby  
For the love you give away  
Kick out all that stupid pride  
Thats standin in my way  
Inside my loving eyes are open wide  
Eyes of silver on which I shall rely  
Diamonds are forever and gold can make you lie  
But your eyes of silver shine on shine on  
Blades of steel have helped a man to conquer all  
Rubies by the hundreds fill the Taj Mahal  
Eyes of silver you tell me what I need  
To bring this cold and lonely man  
Down to his bended knees  
Inside my lovin arms are open wide  
For you eyes of silver  
On which I shall rely  
Diamonds and gold make you lie lie lie  
But your eyes of silver they shine on shine on  
Eyes of silver baby shine on shine on  
Baby shining yeah yeah yeah baby shining
