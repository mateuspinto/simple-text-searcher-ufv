Oh yeah mmm  
Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Let your heart be light  
From now on your troubles will be out of sight yeah  
  
Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Make the Yuletide gay  
From now on your troubles will be miles away oh  
  
Here we are as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore ah  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
They gather near to us once more ooh  
  
Through the years we all will be together and  
If the fates allow  
Hang a shining star upon the highest bow oh yeah oh  
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now oh oh  
  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
They gather near to us once more oh oh  
  
Through the years we all will be together and  
If the fates allow oh yeah  
But til then well have to muddle through somehow  
Oh yeah oh oh  
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now  
Ooh yeah oh ooh
