I think I understand  
The reason you wont stay with me  
You think a ring upon your hand  
Will solve your insecurity  
  
So go ahead and play your games  
If thats what you must do  
Nothing here remains the same  
But the way I feel for you  
  
I can watch you walk away  
And I know that Ill get by  
And I know just what to say  
But honey I cant tell a lie  
  
Figure out what you must do  
Because you think youre so damn clever  
You can marry anytime you want  
But a lover is forever  
  
I can watch you walk away  
And I know that Ill get by  
And I know just what to say  
But honey I cant tell a lie  
  
Figure out what you must do  
Because you think youre so damn clever  
You can marry anytime you want  
But a lover is forever  
You can marry anytime you want  
But a lover is forever
