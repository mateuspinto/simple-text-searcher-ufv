Little broken hearts of the night  
Slowly picking up their knives  
On the way to the fight  
Tonight they want revenge  
  
Beautiful soldiers in their beds  
Making love inside their hands  
With no chance to defend  
Tonight could be their end  
  
With the weapons in their hands  
And their eyes closed as they stand  
Can they end it all tonight so easily  
  
Did the darkness of their days  
Make them let go of their light  
Will they want to find a way  
To make it all right  
  
When the beautiful awake  
See the sadness in their eyes  
Will they want to find a way  
To make it all right  
To make it all right  
  
Only the fallen need to rise  
What if lightning strikes them twice  
Will they give up on their lives  
And finally divide  
  
Did the darkness of their days  
Make them let go of their light  
Can they ever find a way  
To sleep side by side  
  
When the beautiful awake  
See the sadness in their eyes  
Will they ever find a way  
To sleep side by side  
To sleep side by side  
To sleep side by side
