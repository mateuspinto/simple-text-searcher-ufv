You hold it all at once  
The earth and all within  
You look with eyes of love  
To the sons of man  
That I am known by You  
Compels my heart to sing  
  
I live to know You more  
I live to know You more  
I live to know You more  
For me to live is Christ  
To know You is my life  
  
The storms will come and go  
Theres laughter and theres pain  
Your kindness leads me on  
To the light again  
So I live and breathe  
And find myself in You  
  
I live to know You  
I live to know You  
I live to know You more  
  
I count it all but loss  
Compared to knowing You  
I give my life away  
To know You any day
