They found James Ambrose dead in his cell  
A gaping gash in his arm had drained him down to hell  
No one knew for sure if Ambrose was his name  
They called him Yankee Sullivan in early days of fame  
Hed known the game of fisticuffs had always treated him right   
But no one knew the men who came and took his life that night  
  
Hed spent some time in botany bay atoning for his sins  
He fought a bout with hammer lane and took a tainted win  
He was the hero of the Bowery a prince of lawless times  
Then was battered by the butcherman in 1849  
He knew the game of fisticuffs he knew the game of might  
But no one knew the men who came and took his life one night  
He knew the game of fisticuffs  
  
Lilly and McCoy were shy of a hundred and forty pounds  
In 1842 they went a hundred and eighteen rounds  
They begged McCoy to cash it in he said that he would not  
Got up and fought one more round then died right on the spot  
He knew the game of fisticuffs he knew the game of fight  
But no one knew the game would come and take his life that night
