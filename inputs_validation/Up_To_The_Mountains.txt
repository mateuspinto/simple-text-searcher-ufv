I went up to the mountains  
Because you asked me to  
Up over the clouds  
To were the sky was blue  
I can see all round me  
Everywere  
I could see around me  
Everywere  
Sometimes I feel like Iv been nothing but tired  
And ill be working till the day I expire  
So sometimes I just lay down  
Lord what more can I do  
But then go on again  
Because you asked me to  
Somedays I look down  
Afraid aafraid I will fall  
And though the sun shines  
I see nothing at all  
But I hear your your sweet voice  
Oh oh ooo  
Coming and goin  
Coming and goin  
Lord telling me softly  
You love me so
