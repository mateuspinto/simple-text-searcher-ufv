Verse 1  
All the holes at once are coming alive set free  
Out of sight and out of mind lonely  
And their prey  
  
Chorus  
The ones you light your fires to keep away  
Crawling out upon expending  
And all you have to do is say yeah  
  
Verse 2  
All the birds stay up in the trees  
All the fish swim down too deep and lonely  
And they pray  
Honey come to me before its too late  
  
Chorus  
The ones you light your fires to keep away  
Is crawling out upon expelling  
And all you have to do is say yeah
