Tonight tonight wont be just any night  
Tonight there will be no morning star  
Tonight tonight Ill see my love tonight  
And for us stars will stop where they are  
  
Today the minutes seem like hours  
The hours go so slowly  
And still the sky is light  
  
Oh moon grow bright  
And make this endless day endless night  
Tonight  
  
Today the world was just an address  
A place for me to live in  
No better than alright  
  
But here you are  
and what was just a world is a star  
Tonight
