Mean a lot in my life  
Like the feeling like that I want to now ya  
Like the feeling like that I want to now ya

Say I could and I would be strong man  
Say I could and I would be strong man  
  
World in another  
I was trapped within  
A world within another  
World in another  
  
Say I was trapped within  
A world within another

But you may wear your heart  
Upon your sleeve  
But vicious lies only tease tease  
Come on come on come on come on  
  
Every eye open was not see  
Every eye closed is not sleeping
