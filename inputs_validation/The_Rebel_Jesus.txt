Original recording from the chieftains album the bells of dublin  
  
All the streets are filled with laughter and light  
And the music of the season  
And the merchants windows are all bright  
With the faces of the children  
And the families hurrying to their homes  
As the sky darkens and freezes  
Will be gathering around their hearths and tables  
Giving thanks for all gods graces  
And the birth of the rebel Jesus  
  
Well they call him by the prince of peace  
And they call him by the savior  
And they pray to him upon the seas  
And in every bold endeavor  
As they fill his churches with their pride and gold  
And their faith in him increases  
But theyve turned the nature that I worship in  
From a temple to a robbers den  
In the words of the rebel Jesus  
  
We guard our world with locks and guns  
And we guard our fine possessions  
And once a year when Christmas comes  
We give to our relations  
And perhaps we give a little to the poor  
If the generosity should seize us  
But if any one of us should interfere  
In the business of why they are poor  
They get the same as the rebel jesus  
  
But please forgive me if I seem  
To take the tone of judgement  
For Ive no wish to come between  
This day and your enjoyment  
In this life of hardship and of earthly toil  
We have need for anything that frees us  
So I bid you pleasure  
And I bid you cheer  
From a heathen and a pagan  
On the side of the rebel jesus
