Put your hands all over  
Put your hands all over me  
Put your hands all over  
Put your hands all over me  
Put your hands all over me  
  
I cant seem to find  
A pretty little face I left behind  
Wandered out on the open road  
Looking for a better place to call home  
  
Gave her a place to stay  
And she got up and ran away  
And now Ive had enough  
A pretty little face has torn me up  
  
Put your hands all over me  
Please talk to me talk to me  
Tell me everything is gonna be alright  
  
Put your hands all over me  
Please walk with me walk with me now  
Love is a game you say  
Play me and put me away  
Put your hands all over me  
Oh  
  
Now youve lost your mind  
A pretty little girl I left behind  
And now youre getting rough  
But everybody knows youre not that tough  
  
She wandered out on the open road  
Looking for a place to call your own  
Youre scared to death of the road ahead  
Pretty little thing dont get upset  
  
Put your hands all over me  
Please talk to me talk to me  
Tell me everything is gonna be alright

Put your hands all over me  
Please walk with me walk with me now

Say it now and say it loud  
Get up in my face
