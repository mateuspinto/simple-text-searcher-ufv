I have a plan a big plan  
Ill build you a house  
Every stone is a tear and you will never move out  
Yes Ill build a little house for you has no windows no door  
Inside it is dark and no light penetrates within  
Yes Ill make you a home and there you shall spend all your time  
  
Stone by stone I build you in  
Stone by stone I will always be with you  
  
Without clothes without shoes you watch me at my work  
With feet in cement you improve the appearance of the foundation  
There will be a garden outside and nobody hears you screaming  
  
Stone by stone I build you in  
Stone by stone I will always be with you  
  
What a beating what a hammering outdoors it catches in to dawn  
All nails stand to attention if I put them in your body wood ramming  
  
Stone by stone I build you in  
Stone by stone And no one hears you scream
