Mother will you think of me in your prayers  
This twenty first century is a mess  
Oh you can try and fix it  
But it breaks  
Oh you can try and love it  
But it hates  
Oh it hates  
  
Chorus  
This is for everything we had  
Its the good and its the bad  
Its the state of love and trust  
And this is for you  
And this is for us  
  
And father will you comfort me if I call  
This crazy world has lost its mind  
Its our fault  
Oh you can try and straighten it  
It turns it turns it turns  
Oh you can try and smother it  
But it burns  
Oh it burns  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh will you break my fall  
Oh when I climb too high  
I always lose my nerve  
It happens every time  
Oh will you bring me home  
Oh when Im barely alive  
Its the state of love and trust  
And this is for you  
And this is for us  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh will you break my fall  
Oh when I climb too high  
I always lose my nerve  
It happens every time  
Oh will you bring me home  
Oh when Im barely alive  
Its the state of love and trust  
And this is for you  
This is for us  
And this is for you  
And this is for us  
This is for you  
This is for us  
This is for us
