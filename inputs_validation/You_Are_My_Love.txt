I never really told you how much you mean to me  
The words get locked away and I cant set them free  
Never really showed you whats going on inside  
The joy of being near you  
I always seem to  
  
I wish I could throw the fear away  
So I could come right out and say  
Baby Im dying for you  
  
You are my love you are my live  
When Im lost you are the light  
You are the sweetest thing  
And I never gonna let you go  
You are the sweetest thing  
If only I could tell you so  
I watched you when you were sleeping  
Like a little girl  
  
Id like to wake you up and say  
I want you in my world  
Sometimes when I kiss you and look into your eyes  
I have to turn away from you so you wont see me cry  
I wish I could throw away the fear  
I wish I could come right out and say  
Baby Im dying for you
