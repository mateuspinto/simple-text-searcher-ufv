includes a quote from Daddy Daddy Daddy which includes a quote from Tell Me
You Love Me  
  
And if his dick is a monster  
If his dick is a monster  
If his dick is a monster  
They will give him their hearts  
  
Howard  
Hold it Please hold it  
My God Madge  You voluptuous New York City slit   
Why didnt you tell me before  
It was so hard to tell with your little blouseypoo on but   
Now that I see you  I would have helped   
I didnt know you were so obviously  Pregnant   
  
Ive got the thing you need  
I am endowed beyond your wildest  
Clearasilspattered fantasies  
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah   
  
Girls from all over the world  
Flock to write my name on the toilet walls  
Of the Whisky AGoGo  
For I am Bwana Dik  
I am Bwana Dik  
Me Bwana Dik  
Yo Me Bwana Dik  
Say  
  
My dick is a monster  
Give me your heart  
  
Chorus  
Bwana Dik is a legend  
Enormous thou art  
  
Howard  
My dick is a Harley  
You kick it to start  
  
Chorus  
Bwana Dik speaks  
The heavens will part  
  
Howard  
My dick is a dagger  
Ill force it to fit  
My dick is a reamer baby  
To scream up your slit  
  
Chorus  
Steam it  
Ream it  
Cream it
