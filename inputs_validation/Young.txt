Lookin back now well it makes me laugh  
We were growin our hair  
We were cuttin class  
Knew it all already there was nothing to learn  
We were strikin matches just to watch em burn  
  
Listenin to our music just a little too loud  
We were hanging in there with the outcast crowd  
Headin to the rapids with some discount beer  
It was a long train tressle but we had no fear  
  
Man I dont know where the time goes  
But it sure goes fast just like that  
We were wannabe rebels that didnt have a clue  
In our rock n roll tee shirts and our typically bad attitudes  
Had no excuses for the things that wed done  
We were brave we were crazy we were mostly  
Young young  
  
Talked a good game we were right with the guys  
But in the backseat we were awkward and shy  
Girls were a mystery that we couldnt explain  
And I guess there are some things that are never gonna change  
  
Man I dont know where the time goes  
But it sure goes fast just like that  
We were wannabe rebels that didnt have a clue  
In our rock n roll tee shirts and our typically bad attitudes  
Had no excuses for the things that wed done  
We were brave we were crazy we were mostly  
Young young young  
  
Yeah and wishing we were older  
Young  
Hey I wish it wasnt over  
  
Man I dont know where the time goes  
But it sure goes fast just like that  
We were wannabe rebels that didnt have a clue  
In our rock n roll tee shirts and our typically bad attitudes  
Had no excuses for the things that wed done  
We were brave we were crazy we were mostly  
Young young  
  
Hey and wishing we were older  
And I wish it wasnt over
