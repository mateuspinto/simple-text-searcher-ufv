Dance with me I want to be your partner  
Cant you see the music is just starting  
Night is falling and I am falling  
Dance with me  
Fantasy could never be so giving  
I feel free I hope that you are willing  
Pick your feet up and kick your feet up  
Dance with me  
Let it lift you off the ground  
Starry eyes and love is all around us  
I can take you if you want to go  
Dance with me I want to be your partner  
Cant you see the music is just starting  
Night is falling and I am falling  
Dance with me  
Let it lift you off the ground  
Starry eyes and love is all around us  
I can take you if you want to go  
Dance with me I want to be your partner  
Cant you see the music is just starting  
Night is falling and I am falling  
Dance with me
