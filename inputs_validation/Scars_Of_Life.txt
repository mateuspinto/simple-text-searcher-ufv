As were sitting here staring each other down  
You open up your mouth let your lies spew out  
What are we doing here its wrong cant you see  
You wanna leave me here and forget about me  
  
You look me in my face  
Tell me Im your disgrace  
You say that your the victim  
I say your full of shit  
  
All the times you stuck me here  
And put me on my own  
I feel the same thats why  
Ive got a bullet with your name  
  
As were sitting here staring each other down  
I remember how you used to kick me around  
Look deep in my eyes come take all my pain  
I only have just one bullet with your name  
  
You look me in my face  
Tell me Im your disgrace  
You say that your the victim  
I say your full of shit  
  
All the times you stuck me here  
And put me on my own  
I feel the same thats why  
Ive got a bullet with your name  
  
I feel the same  
Get the fuck away  
Yea away  
  
Look deep in my eyes  
Come take the pain from me  
All I ask of you  
Is to get away from me  
  
You look me in my face  
Tell me Im your disgrace  
You say that your the victim  
I say your full of shit  
  
All the times you stuck me here  
And put me on my own  
I feel the same thats why  
Ive got a bullet with your name  
  
All the times you stuck me here  
And put me on my own  
I feel the same thats why  
Ive got a bullet with your name  
  
Yea away
