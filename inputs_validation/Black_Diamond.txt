Out on the street for a living  
Pictures only begun  
Got you under their thumb  
Hit it  
  
Out on the streets for a living  
Pictures only begun  
Your day is sorrow and madness  
Got you under their thumb  
  
Whoo black diamond  
Whoo black diamond  
  
Darkness will fall on the city  
It seems to follow you too  
And though you dont ask for pity  
Theres nothin that you can do no no  
  
Whoo black diamond  
Whoo black diamond  
  
Out on the streets for a living  
Pictures only begun  
Your day is sorrow and madness  
Got you under their thumb  
  
Whoo black diamond yeah  
Whoo black diamond
