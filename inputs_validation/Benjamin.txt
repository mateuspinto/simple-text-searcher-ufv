  
  
  
  
  
Take me away  
  
I know I could use a rest  
  
I want to clear up this mess  
  
I need a few days with my good sense  
  
I need a few good days  
  
Benjamin no oh  
  
Benjamin no oh  
  
Benjamin no  
  
where did you go  
  
no no  
  
when you were falling from my tree  
  
I was not scared  
  
I thought youd meet me back up there  
  
it never dawned on me you were home free  
  
it never dawned on me no  
  
Benjamin no oh  
  
Benjamin no oh  
  
Benjamin no  
  
where did you go  
  
no no no  
  
Benjamin no oh  
  
Benjamin no oh  
  
Benjamin no  
  
where did you go  
  
no no  
  
you said that I could tie you down no  
  
you said that I could tie you down no  
  
you said that I could tie you down no  
  
you said that I could tie you down no  
  
take me away  
  
I know I could use the rest
