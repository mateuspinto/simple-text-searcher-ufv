Early in the morning when the sun come up  
I sat there drinking from your loving cup  
Tell me pretty babe what can I do  
Want to drink from your loving cup  
On the Sunday morn youre acting funny  
You should be working earning money  
Slow down baby you move too fast  
Want to come and catch ya laying in the grass  
  
instrumental  
Early in the morning when the sun comes up  
Hey babe ya your loving cup yeah  
Tell me pretty babe what can I do  
Want to drink from your loving cup  
instrumental  
Just want to drink from your loving cup yeah  
Just want to drink from your loving cup yeah
