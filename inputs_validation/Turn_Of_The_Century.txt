Realising a form out of stone  
Set hands moving  
Roan shaped his heart  
Through his working hands  
Work to mold his passion into clay like the sun  
  
In his room his lady  
She would dance and sing so completely  
So be still he now cries  
I have time oh let clay transform thee so  
  
In the deep cold of night  
Winter calls he cries Dont deny me  
For his lady deep her illness  
Time has caught her  
And will for all reasons take her  
  
In the still light of dawn she dies  
Helpless hands soul revealing  
  
Like leaves we touch we learn  
We once knew the story  
As winter calls he will starve  
All but to see the stone be life  
  
Now Roan no more tears  
Set to work his strength  
So transformed him  
Realising a form out of stone His work  
So absorbed him  
Could she hear him  
Could she see him  
All aglow was his room dazed in this light  
He would touch her  
He would hold her  
Laughing as they danced  
Highest colors touching others  
  
Did her eyes at the turn of the century  
Tell me plainly  
When we meet how well love oh let life so transform me  
  
Like leaves we touched we danced  
We once knew the story  
As autumn called and we both  
Remembered all those many years ago  
Im sure we know  
  
Was the sign with a touch  
As I kiss your fingers  
We walk hands in the sun  
Memories when were young  
Love lingers so  
  
Was it sun through the haze  
That made all your looks  
As warm as moonlight  
As a pearl deep in your eyes  
Tears have flown away  
All the same light  
  
Did her eyes at the turn of the century  
Tell me plainly  
When we meet how well look  
As we smile time will leave me clearly  
  
Like leaves we touch we see  
We will know the story  
As autumn calls well both remember  
All those many years ago
