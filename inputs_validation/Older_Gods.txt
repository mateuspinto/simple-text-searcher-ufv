Aiyyo I roll like a bat out of hell  
Evil acapells fly spittin out of my grill  
Before I hit the sky with springtime colors  
Juicy as a Sunkist certain broads double dutch this  
They carve it in they wrist pales berry blazes  
Straighten the crumbs left on the stove clothes in my lady hair  
Plus yours the look gold God the old tainted bald technique  
Got these vestibules designer niggaz in they whips  
Jumpin out they seats eighteen Bronzeman Part II  
We like Dorothy Hamill on ice  
We in your hood we might circle hats down low in the Range  
Switch lanes change my tire peel out  
Real loud on the stage yo I shitted on your hood kid  
I shitted on your hood got to your burner too late  
Im lookin real good draped out  
Shinin like a fresh fifty cent piece your girlfriend come here  
Oh shit you my mans niece the gourmet pocket twenty  
Bombs made of clay Sexcapades take place  
We fucked in fortyeight shades might walk up in your studio  
Time slap your engineer its lighter fluid to that style  
Hand me the matches now  
  
Aiyyo rainbow Roley on the wrist now whats this  
Niggaz bless this eight and a half Bally banana twist  
E shakes puffin on lye feedin the seeds plate  
Pullin out old dirty eights to rob gates  
Major wake up the kid telltales make a nigga head wake up  
Beats break the nigga would take off his time  
Honolulu status gladdest  
The rich rock cabbage and dollar vans grands  
That nigga mad savage stationary Hall of Justice  
Niggaz came clumped out  
Just came home now they bunked out  
Money be longer than triple life  
Til the sun burn out thats my word  
Move it with the burner out  
Fidel way of thinkin roll with the Mac bent Ac10  
Most of my team Five Percent check what the live said  
Rollin with Guess vests pedestrians yo  
Holdin my nuts fuckin thousand dollar lesbians  
  
Yo the Older God put me on and had to rock this  
Maintain ThreeSixty Lord live prosperous  
It only takes a lesson a day just to analyze life  
One time in the respectable mind  
  
Yo the Older God put me on and had to rock this  
Maintain ThreeSixty Lord live prosperous  
It only takes a lesson a day just to analyze life  
One time in the respectable mind  
  
Let the shot spark soon as his pit bull barks  
Tire scars from skid marks leaves from jams in school parks  
Witness forget his original statement  
Even in protection programs theres no escapement  
Gunned down we in town hit king from seven crowns  
Spent rounds catch him while he rhyme in the Zebra Lounge  
Wounded back in the eightythree summer heat  
Up in threeohnine park rhymin off the drummers beat  
I stalk the city streets demonstratin mic wrecks  
All lookin stank I aint playin wit a full deck  
And as they nervously stare I know they scared  
They saw the coming of Wu the neon in Times Square  
Household name assassin killa bee  
Mill to the grain that possess the Wu trilogy  
Quick to spot those that bite camouflage and blend  
Those that got styles they got identical twins  
Dont stretch the small thing copycats are finnicky  
Without skills they master the art of mimicry  
But I go line for line on the whole page  
Your unspotted life on the mic is old age
