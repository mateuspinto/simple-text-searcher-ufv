Angeliou oh Angeliou  
Oh oh Angeliou Angeliou  
Oh Angeliou oh Angeliou oh my Angeliou  
  
In the month of May  
In the month of May  
In the city of Paris  
In the month of May  
In the month of May  
In the city of Paris  
And I heard the bells ringing and I heard the bells ringing  
In the month of May  
In the city of Paris and I called out your name  
  
In the month of May  
In the city of Paris  
In the month of May  
In the city of Paris  
Oh oh Angeliou oh Angeliou oh oh Angeliou oh my Angeliou  
  
Walkin on a city street who would think you could ever be touched  
By a total stranger not me  
But when you came up to me that day and I listened to your story  
It reminded me so much of myself  
It wasnt what you said but the way it felt to me  
About a search and a journey just like mine  
  
Will you be my baby  
Will you be my baby now  
Will you be my baby  
Will you be my baby now  
Angeliou oh Angeliou  
Angeliou oh Angeliou  
Yes I will yes I will yes I will  
After she told all these things to me I said I got a story too  
It goes something like this
