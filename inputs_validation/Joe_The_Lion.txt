A couple of drinks on the house an he said  
Tell you who you are if you nail me to my car

Youll never know the real story  
Just a couple of dreams  
You get up and sleep  
  
You can buy god its Monday  
Slither down the greasy pipe

Hobble over any freeway  
You will be like your dreams tonight  
  
You get up and sleep
