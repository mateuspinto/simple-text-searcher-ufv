Why do I think theres nobody out there  
No one who wants me and no one who knows  
I wait in this place and no one can see me  
After all this time could I be so alone  
I walk through this old town and still feel so lonely  
The winds play sad songs high in the trees  
The sun never shines this deep in the forest  
And I in the darkness or is the darkness in me  
I wanna break  
I wanna break out  
I wanna break  
I wanna break out  
I want to taste the tears of a lover  
Warm as my blood as wet as a kiss  
But its only dark rain that falls in this old town  
Old as my memory and as cold as my lips  
I wanna break  
I wanna break out  
I dont wanna fake it  
I want to break out  
And when I feel lonely  
And when I feel lonely  
You fly me to the sun  
Above this old town  
From the top of a tower  
I forget about living I forget about pain  
At the edge of the platform  
At the edge of a heartbeat  
Above this old town I flew away  
I wanna break  
I wanna break out  
I dont wanna fake it  
I want to break out  
I wanna break  
I wanna break out  
I want to break  
I want to break out
