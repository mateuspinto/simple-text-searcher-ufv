Who are they to decide what we should hear  
Who are they to decide what we should see  
What do they think we cant comprehend here  
What do they fear that our reaction might be might be  
  
CHORUS  
  
Section 31 on the TV  
Section 31 on the radio  
Section 31 is like a blindfold  
Section 31 makes me feel cold feel cold  
  
The pounding of the footsteps in the early morning light  
  
Another family waking to an awful deadly fright  
Theres a body on the pavement with a bullet to the jaw  
A thirteenyearold victim of plastic bullet law  
  
The silence in my ears the darkness in my eyes  
Heightens the fear deafens the cries  
Of another brother taken in another act of hate  
A family preparing for another dreadful wait  
  
CHORUS
