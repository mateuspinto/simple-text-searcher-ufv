I saw two dreamers dreamin  
They almost caused a spark  
I saw two lovers in paradise right back at the start  
I saw two minds in the world set free  
But it almost broke my heart  
Isnt it strange to be right now havin you close to me  
Much to my surprise  
I saw two schemes schemin  
They almost caused a lark  
They were two brave souls on a wild blue spree  
Right back at the park  
They were like two ships  
And they sailed right by each other in the dark  
Wouldnt ya like to be right now  
Out where the actors play  
So much for your disguise  
I saw two souls out searchin  
They said their last goodbyes  
And I saw two hearts of passion then  
Much to my surprise  
I saw two hearts on passion bent  
The kind which mystifies  
It is so strange to be right now  
Having you on my knee  
Much to my surprise  
I gotta make you see somehow  
I saw two minds that wandered  
They almost caused a wreck  
They were all checked out for a wild blue sea  
When someone cried hit the deck  
I saw two minds in the world set wise  
But I almost broke my specs  
Wouldnt ya like to be right now  
Out where the actors play  
So much for your disguise  
Much to my surprise
