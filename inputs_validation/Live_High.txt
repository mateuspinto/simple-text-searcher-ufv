I try to picture a girl  
Through a looking glass  
See her as a carbon atom  
See her eyes and stare back at them  
See that girl  
As her own new world  
Though a home is on the surface she is still a universe  
  
Glory God oh God is peeking through the blinds  
Are we all here standing naked  
Taking guesses at the actual date and time  
Oh my justifying reasons why  
Is an absolutely insane resolution to live by  
  
Live high  
Live mighty  
Live righteously  
Takin it easy  
Live high live mighty  
Live righteously  
  
Try to picture the man  
To always have an open hand  
See him as a giving tree  
See him as matter  
Matter fact hes not a beast  
No not the devil either  
Always a good deed doer  
And its laughter that were makin after all  
  
The call of the wild is still an ordination why  
And the order of the permeates  
All our politics are too late  
Oh my the congregation in my mind  
Is this assembly singing gratitude  
Practicing their livin for you  
  
Just take it easy  
And celebrate the malleable reality  
Nothing is ever as it seems  
This life is but a dream
