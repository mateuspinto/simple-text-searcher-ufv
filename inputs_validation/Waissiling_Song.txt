Wassail wassail all over the town  
Our toast it is white and our ale it is brown  
Our bowl it is made of the white maple tree  
With the wassailing bowl well drink to thee  
So here is to Cherry and to his right cheek  
Pray God send our master a good piece of beef  
And a good piece of beef that may we all see  
With the wassailing bowl well drink to thee  
And here is to Dobbin and to his right eye  
Pray God send our master a good Christmas pie  
A good Christmas pie that may we all see  
With the wassailing bowl well drink to thee  
So here is to Broad Mary and to her broad horn  
May God send our master a good crop of corn  
And a good crop of corn that may we all see  
With the wassailing bowl well drink to thee  
And here is to Fillpail and to her left ear  
Pray God send our master a happy New Year  
And a happy New Year as eer he did see  
With the wassailing bowl well drink to thee  
And here is to Colly and to her long tail  
Pray God send our master he never may fail  
A bowl of strong beer I pray you draw near  
And our jolly wassail its then you shall hear  
Come butler come fill us a bowl of the best  
Then we hope that your soul in heaven may rest  
But if you do draw us a bowl of the small  
Then down shall go butler bowl and all  
Then heres to the maid in the lily white smock  
Who tripped to the door and slipped back the lock  
Who tripped to the door and pulled back the pin  
For to let these jolly wassailers in
