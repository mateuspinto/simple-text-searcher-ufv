Sat Sufferin  
I knew him when  
Fair weather friends of mine  
  
Try not to think  
I merely blink  
Hope to wish away the lies Lies Can you protect me  
When Im a wrecked  
I pretend youre still alive  
Yeeeaahh  
  
2x Oooo Denied All And tied all the lies  
  
I choose to day  
One deepen grave  
Thick fog that hide our smiles  
  
Clear all your sins  
Get born again  
Just repeat a couple lies  
Yeaheyeeeah  
  
Oooo Denied All And tied all the lies  
  
Can you protect me  
When Im a wrecked  
I pretend your still alive  
  
I choose to day  
One deepen grave thick fog that hide our smiles  
  
Sat Suffferin  
Oooo Denied All And tied all the lies  
Get born again  
Oooo Denied All And tied all the lies  
Sat Sufferin  
Oooo Denied All And tied all the lies  
Get born again  
Oooo Denied All And tied all the lies  
Sat Sufferin  
Oooo Denied All And tied all the lies  
Get born again  
Oooo Denied All And tied all the lies  
Sat Sufferin  
Oooo Denied All And tied all the lies
