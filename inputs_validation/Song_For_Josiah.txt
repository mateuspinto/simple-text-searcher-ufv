Oh my son you were born in a world that hates you  
And I swear I will never forsake you  
But there was a father centuries ago  
Who watched his beloved son die oh die  
  
Oh my son I am weak and Im trembling  
For the lord I am always remembering  
Oh what a strong shepherd holds you in his arms  
Hell break you and make you his own  
And then take you home  
  
Well if I could I would protect you from what you will see  
This world will promise love and beauty but it lied to me  
And I will show you if you will listen  
And I will promise to listen too  
  
Oh yes there are some who love the lies they will kill you if they can  
Though you speak the truth in love they will hate you like the man  
Jesus although he was god he allowed himself broken for you  
  
Well if I could I would protect you from what you will see  
The world might seem so alive but its dead to me  
And I will teach you if you will hear me  
And I will promise to hear you too yes I do  
  
Oh my son I am only your brother  
For a sister god gave me your mother  
But just like a mother so long ago had to watch her beloved son die  
Oh son we will try to let you go
