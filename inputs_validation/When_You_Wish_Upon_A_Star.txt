When you wish upon a star  
Makes no difference who you are  
Anything your heart desires  
Will come to you  
  
If your heart is in your dream  
No request is too extreme  
When you wish upon a star  
As dreamers do  
  
Fate is kind  
She brings to those who love  
The sweet fulfillment of  
Their secret longing  
  
Like a bolt out of the blue  
Fate steps in and sees you through  
When you wish upon a star  
Your dreams come true
