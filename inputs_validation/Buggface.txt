Can I dance  
Oh oh oh aww shit  
Big Boi Big boi  
  
What if everything you ever knew or known was lost  
The needs tend to freeze you when you gatherin yo thoughts  
You pause for the causetry to recall and remember  
But the train is in reverse and the caboose is in the center  
Cause your mind aint free constricting by the motherfuckin boundaries  
An ounce of weed or an pound of dro  
Couldnt place you on the planet where  
Im transmitting life from bro brother bro hem  
Cadillac on bows strike a pose then the door slams  
Wham nigga wham dont they say that in they show damn  
For show man acting like a tadpole out of gonads  
You now how catch the truth hit the booth we making more jams  
Spread the strawberry preserves on your nervous program fuck the learning
curve  
We took our ramp to no mans land  
Hellois anybody home is anybody giving dome  
Serve me up I want some  
  
Chorus  
Buggface toe jam from the face up cause you dont give a jam  
Jam to the jam toast jelly to the jam  
Imagine me now jamming shoving it up your monkey jam  
Buggface toe jam from the face up cause you dont give a jam  
Jam to the jam toast jelly to the jam  
Imagine me now jamming shoving it up your monkey jam  
  
When Im left alone I get to thinking to myself  
The mind is a terrible thing to waste so use it until nones left  
Like everything is alright clearly tight to death  
I can see clearly now analyzing every step  
Clearly you can feel me cause its beating through your chest  
And you can see me clearly through the window paint drip wet wet  
With no tint not yetclearly Im a vet  
And not a veterinarian but clearly pitbulls are the best  
Like the OUTKS cleary nigga you know the rest  
And if you acting like you dont cleary nigga you trying to test  
Crystal clearly I confess and I suggest you clear the runway  
Cause the ticket is a oneway clearly back we wont be coming  
  
Chorus  
  
Can I dance  
Can I dance  
  
Oh shit bamboo Stop  
Yall just playing around now Come on Cross
