I used to be happy  
I used to be  
Such a loving man  
I used to be  
  
That was before  
The end of my world  
That was before  
The end of my world  
  
She used to be happy  
She used to be  
Such a loving woman  
She used to be  
  
That was before  
The end of her world  
That was before  
The end of her world  
  
We used to be happy  
We used to be  
Such a loving people  
We used to be  
  
That was before  
The end of our world  
That was before  
The end of our world
