its hard to be tender  
its hard to stay open  
when youre dizzy with anger  
and your dreams have been broken  
lying with you neath the sky  
the country is so green in the light  
loving yous the key to my survival  
now you have gone away  
the skies turned grey  
the rivers froze  
I remember how you held me close  
and I shiver  
its hard to be tender  
its hard to stay open  
when the woods are on fire  
and the river is frozen  
swore on my knees as a child  
never to forsake God above  
never to betray the ones who love me  
now years have come and gone  
I find the strength to carry on  
but the blood that ran so fast and warm  
has grown colder  
now my heart has turned to ice  
is it just the price of growing older  
its hard to be tender  
but Im tired of defending  
I know that I love you  
so Ill write my own ending
