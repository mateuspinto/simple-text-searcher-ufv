You cant get romantic on a subway line  
Conductor dont like it says youre wastin your time  
But evrybody wants some  
I want some too  
Evrybody wants some  
Baby how bout you

Yeah ya spent a lot Ya got lost in the jetstream  
But evrybody wants some  
I want some too  
Evrybody wants some  
Baby how bout you  
I like the way the line runs up the back of the stockings  
Ive always liked those kind of high heels too You know I  
No no no no dont take em off dont take Leave em on leave em on  
Yeah thats it a little more to the right a little more  
Evrybody wants some  
I want some too  
Evrybody wants some  
Baby how bout you  
Evrybody wants some  
Evrybody needs some  
Evrybody wants some  
Evrybody needs some
