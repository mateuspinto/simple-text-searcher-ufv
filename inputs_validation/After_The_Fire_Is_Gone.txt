Both  
Love is where you find it  
When you find no love at home  
And theres nothin cold as ashes  
After the fire is gone  
  
George  
The bottle is almost empty  
The clock just now struck ten  
Darlin I had to call you  
To our favorite place again  
  
Tammy  
I know its wrong for us to meet  
But the fires gone out at home  
Both  
And there nothin cold as ashes  
After the fire is gone  
  
Love is where you find it  
When you find no love at home  
And theres nothin cold as ashes  
After the fire is gone  
  
Tammy  
Your lips are warm and tender  
Your arms hold me just right  
Sweet words of love you remember  
That the one at home forgot  
  
George  
Each time we say its the last time  
But we keep hangin on  
Both  
And theres nothin cold as ashes  
After the fire is gone  
  
Love is where you find it  
When you find no love at home  
And theres nothin cold as ashes  
After the fire is gone
