I asked for your number but you wanted mine  
You said write on my hand so its easy to find  
We were right at the start  
And everything was possible  
  
We were stupid reckless breaking the rules  
Careless happy fearless and new  
We were right at the start somehow we got here  
  
And this is the perfect night  
It doesnt get better than this  
The perfect time  
Oh tell me that you feel it tell me that you feel it too  
We come so close we got so far  
We made it we made it the perfect night the perfect time  
To say goodbye  
  
We were caught in a bubble no one could burst  
Had whole conversations without any words  
We got right to the top  
And couldnt believe the view  
  
Its a long way down  
Nobody cares when it feels like flying a long way down yeah  
Somehow we got here  
  
And this is the perfect night  
It doesnt get better than this  
The perfect time  
Oh tell me that you feel it tell me that you feel it too  
Weve come so close we got so far  
We made it we made it the perfect night the perfect time  
To say goodbye  
  
To say goodbye  
Doesnt get better  
Doesnt gget better  
It doesnt get better than this  
  
I was stupid reckless breaking the rules  
I was foolish hurtful selfish and cruel  
I was out of control but thats how we got here  
  
And this is the perfect night  
It doesnt get better than this  
The perfect time  
Oh tell me that you feel it tell me that you feel it too  
Weve come so close we got so far  
We made it we made it the perfect night the perfect time  
To say goodbye
