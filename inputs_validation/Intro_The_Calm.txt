Cows mooing and carnival music plays in the background  
  
Here we are This is the calm before the storm We off the track now That
means were heading into  
Brand new unknown territorys yall We into the crop circles It says time
waits for no mutahfuckin  
Body After this short calm a vicious storm will arrive A horendously wicked
storm Lighting bolts  
So powerful they set fire to water Thunder loud enogh to shatter brick walls
And its headin right  
Towards us all We call this storm The Tempest Tornados of fire being chased
by enormus tidal waves  
The tempest Tearing down forests into feilds reveiling crop circles The
Tempest Who will be left  
Who will still be around in the end The Tempest Who will survive long enough
to join us for the new  
Dawn Icp is rollin over
