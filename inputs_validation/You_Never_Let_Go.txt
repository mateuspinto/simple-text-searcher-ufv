Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death  
Your perfect love is casting out fear  
And even when Im caught in the middle of the storms of this life  
I wont turn back  
I know You are near  
  
And I will fear no evil  
For my God is with me  
And if my God is with me  
Whom then shall I fear  
Whom then shall I fear  
  
Oh no You never let go  
Through the calm and through the storm  
Oh no You never let go  
In every high and every low  
Oh no You never let go  
Lord You never let go of me  
  
And I can see a light that is coming for the heart that holds on  
A glorious light beyond all compare  
And there will be an end to these troubles  
But until that day comes  
Well live to know You here on the earth  
  
Oh no You never let go  
Through the calm and through the storm  
Oh no You never let go  
In every high and every low  
Oh no You never let go  
Lord You never let go of me  
  
Yes I can see a light that is coming for the heart that holds on  
And there will be an end to these troubles  
But until that day comes  
Still I will praise You still I will praise You  
  
Oh no You never let go  
Through the calm and through the storm  
Oh no You never let go  
In every high and every low  
Oh no You never let go  
Lord You never let go of me  
  
Oh no You never let go  
Through the calm and through the storm  
Oh no You never let go  
In every high and every low  
Oh no You never let go  
Lord You never let go of me
