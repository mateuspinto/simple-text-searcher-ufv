He seems to be completely unreceptive  
The tests I gave him show no sense at all  
His eyes react to light the dials detect it  
He hears but cannot answer to your call  
  
See me feel me touch me heal me  
See me feel me touch me heal me  
  
There is no chance no untried operation  
All hope lies with him and none with me  
Imagine though the shock from isolation  
When he suddenly can hear and speak and see  
  
See me feel me touch me heal me  
See me feel me touch me heal me  
  
His eyes can see  
His ears can hear his lips speak  
All the time the needles flick and rock  
No machine can give the kind of stimulation  
Needed to remove his inner block  
  
Go to the mirror boy  
Go to the mirror boy  
  
I often wonder what hes feeling  
Has he ever heard a word Ive said  
Look at him now in the mirror dreaming  
What is happening in his head  
  
Listening to you I get the music  
Gazing at you I get the heat  
Following you I climb the mountain  
I get excitement at your feet  
  
Right behind you I see the millions  
On you I see the glory  
From you I get the opinions  
From you I get the story  
  
What is happening in his head  
Ooooh I wish I knew I wish I knew
