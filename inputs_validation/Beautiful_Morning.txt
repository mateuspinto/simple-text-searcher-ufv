Chorus  
Beautiful morning  
On this beautiful morning  
On this beautiful morning  
On this beautiful morning  
Here with you  
  
Driving down the highway on a Friday evening  
Me and my lady had stopped for leaving  
Early stop leave the city behind us  
Good to be the kid that cares alot  
We got just us  
  
We going Starbucks a doner and a coffee  
Thats when I notice it was all around me  
And do today and theres gotta be a winner  
Rolling out the summer were tired of winter  
  
Still left on were climbing all of our years  
Still had hair on a true to fear  
Doves are singing not a cloud in the sky  
Oh my God aint it good to be alive  
  
Chorus  
  
No hesitation and we check into our hotel  
Down about a woosh about a mile at the disco  
Up toss the bed in a room that I seen you  
I just sat here loving that person in me  
  
Dont you worry cause Im back in my case  
Get down to the beach and let the sun on your face  
Doves are singing not a cloud in the sky  
Oh my God aint it good to be alive  
  
Chorus  
  
Cause we keep tryin going fast  
Lets make everything last oh ye  
Well singing  dancing  jumping around  
We cook get drunk we all fall down  
Go through love no regrets
