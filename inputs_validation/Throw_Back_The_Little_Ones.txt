Lost in the Barrio I walk like an Injun  
So Carlo wont suspect somethings wrong here  
I dance in place  
And paint my face  
And act like I belong here  
  
Chorus  
Throw back the little ones  
And panfry the big ones  
Use tact poise and reason  
And gently squeeze them  
  
Hot licks and rhetoric  
Dont count much for nothing  
Be glad if you can use what you borrow  
So I pawn my crown  
For a ride uptown  
And buy it back tomorrow  
  
Chorus  
  
Done like a matador I pray for the weekend  
And hope the little girls still throw roses  
Else Ill change my bait  
And move upstate  
Before the season closes  
  
Chorus
