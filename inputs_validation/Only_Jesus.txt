Verse 1  
Only Jesus is my refuge  
He is my hiding place  
He has been my soul sustainer  
I am safe in His embrace  
Only Jesus love is constant  
Hes an everfaithful friend  
Hes my highest aspiration  
I want nothing more than Him  
  
Chorus  
Only Jesus Only Jesus  
Only Jesus Only Jesus  
My one desire  
Only Jesus  
All my worship All my worship  
All my praises All my praises  
All that I live for  
Only Jesus  
  
Verse 2  
Only Jesus will I worship  
My hear has just begun  
To sing unending praises  
To an audience of one  
Only Jesus will I follow  
I have no higher call  
I owe Him my allegiance  
Only Jesus is Lord of all  
Only Jesus  
  
Bridge  
I want to give  
This life I live  
As a sacrifice of praise of praise  
For Jesus only Jesus
