Camerons getting logical  
A Vulcan in disguise  
The mysteries of the night are  
Putting sparkle in his eyes  
Hes looking for sound reasoning  
But the best that I can do  
Is this transcendental story  
That Ill pass along to you  
  
Past the falls they call Victoria  
Down the river named the Nile  
Drifts a tiny little handmade boat  
Its shaped just like a smile  
  
And steered by a magician  
With the knowledge that he needs  
To keep him on his destined course  
Past the crocodiles and reeds  
  
Hes the Admiral of the ocean  
The Lone Eagle in the sky  
He gave me my first sextant  
And he taught me how to fly  
  
Its been quite a lengthy passage  
From the dawn of time till now  
He has weathered the infernal storms  
In his trusty petite dow  
  
He has soared about colossal waves  
Sailed the endless sea  
Sometimes he resembles you  
Sometimes he looks like me  
  
I saw him through my telescope  
On a cloudless night in June  
As he rested between voyages  
At his beach house on the moon  
  
There are windows to the galaxies  
And hallways to the past  
There are trapdoors to the future  
And a splintered ancient mast  
There are relics from Apollo trips  
When the earthmen came to play  
And a hammock from a distant star  
Out in the Milky Way  
  
Hes the Admiral of the ocean  
The Lone Eagle in the sky  
He game me my first sextant  
And he taught me how to fly  
  
I saw him through my telescope  
On a cloudless night in June  
As he rested between voyages  
At his beach house on the moon  
  
A stripped bass breaks the surface  
As the sunset fades away  
And our journey from the Sea of Storms  
Takes us home beside the bay  
We go fishing in the ocean  
We go traveling back in time  
Like the song says teach your children  
To go fishing with their minds  
  
Camerons contemplating  
Im not sure just what he thinks  
Is my dad some kind of lunatic  
With his stories and high hijinks  
Then he says when I get old and gray  
And feel like Im marooned  
He will take me in his rocket ship  
To that beach house on the moon
