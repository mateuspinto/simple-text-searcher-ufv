I keep thinkin bout that little sparkle in your eye  
Is it a light from the angels or your devil deep inside  
What about the way you say you love me all the time  
Are you liftin me up to heaven just to drop me down the line  
Theres a ring around my finger but will you change your mind  
And you tell me that Im beautiful but that could be lie  
Are you a heartbreaker  
Maybe you want me for the ride  
What if Im fallin for a heartbreaker and everything is just a lie  
I wont be leavin here alive  
I wont be leavin here alive no  
Temporary happiness is like waiting for the knife  
Cause Im always watchin for someone to show their darker side  
So maybe Ill sit back and just enjoy all this for now  
Watch it all play out see if you really stick around  
But theres always this one question that keeps me up at night  
Are you my greatest love or disappointment in my life  
Are you a heartbreaker maybe you want me for the ride what if Im fallin for
a heartbreaker and everything is just a lie  
I wont be leaving here alive  
I might as well lay down and die  
Im holding on with both hands and both feet ooohhhh  
Promise that you wont pull the rug out from under me  
Are you a heartbreaker maybe you want me for the ride  
I pray to god youre not a heartbreaker  
This time around I wont survive cause if Ive fallin for a heartbreaker  
And everything is just a lie  
I wont be leaving here alive  
I might as well lay down and die  
I wont be leaving here alive
