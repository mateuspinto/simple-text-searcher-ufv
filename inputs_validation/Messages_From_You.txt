I forgot about you last night  
For the first time in a long time I Didddd  
I was caught up in these drinks they keep on makin  
In amazin conversation with this girl named lorraine  
Who says shes from L A  
Who keeps makin me laugh and even asks if she can pay  
Ooohhhh  
She could be good for me yeahhh  
This what you text me  
Tell me that you miss me

And shes starin at my face  
Something that could change  
Thought that all these feelings went away yeahh

Thought that all these feelings went away
