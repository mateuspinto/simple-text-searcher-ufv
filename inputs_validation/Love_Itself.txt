The light came through the window  
Straight from the sun above  
And so inside my little room  
There plunged the rays of Love  
  
In streams of light I clearly saw  
The dust you seldom see  
Out of which the Nameless makes  
A Name for one like me  
  
Ill try to say a little more  
Love went on and on  
Until it reached an open door  
Then Love Itself  
Love Itself was gone  
  
All busy in the sunlight  
The flecks did float and dance  
And I was tumbled up with them  
In formless circumstance  
  
Ill try to say a little more  
Love went on and on  
Until it reached an open door  
Then Love Itself  
Love Itself was gone  
  
Then I came back from where Id been  
My room it looked the same  
But there was nothing left between  
The Nameless and the Name  
  
All busy in the sunlight  
The flecks did float and dance  
And I was tumbled up with them  
In formless circumstance  
  
Ill try to say a little more  
Love went on and on  
Until it reached an open door  
Then Love itself  
Love Itself was gone  
Love Itself was gone
