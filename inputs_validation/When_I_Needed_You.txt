Id like to be a child again  
So many things to do  
Playground noise and colored toys  
And everything brand new  
  
Id like to be a pirate ship  
In search of hidden gold  
On ocean waves that swim away  
And sail around the world  
  
Where where were you  
When I needed you most  
When I needed a friend  
Where where were you  
When I needed you most  
When I needed a friend  
  
Id like to be a soldier  
A general I would be  
In battle and in glory  
With ten thousand men to lead  
  
I could be most anything  
There is so much to see  
Id live a different story  
If you were next to me  
  
Where where were you  
When I needed you most  
When I needed a friend  
Where where were you  
When I needed you most  
When I needed a friend  
  
Where where were you  
When I needed you most  
When I needed a friend  
Where where were you  
When I needed you most  
When I needed a friend  
  
I could be most anything  
There is so much to see  
Id live a different story  
If you were next to me  
  
Where where  
Where where were you  
When I needed you most  
When I needed a friend  
Where where were you  
When I needed you most  
When I needed a friend
