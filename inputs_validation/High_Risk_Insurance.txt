High risk insurance  
The time is right  
High risk insurance  
The time is right  
  
Got endurance I was trained  
I got my sights adjusted and my telescope aimed  
  
Everybody wants an explanation  
Got no love for the enemy nation  
  
High risk insurance  
High risk insurance  
High risk insurance  
High risk insurance  
  
You gotta fight to stay independent  
I got my pride and Im gonna defend it
