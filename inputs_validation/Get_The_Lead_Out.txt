Do ya like good boogey  
Like the real boogey woogie  
Hear the juke box singin  
Get the dance hall swingin  
Wont ya grab my shaker  
Got to meet your maker  
Um get out the lead get out of bed get the lead out  
  
Get ready Ill show you my fist  
Get ready Take hold of my wrist  
Get ready We really cant miss  
Get ready  
  
Oh hey good lookin  
What ya got there cookin  
You a young spring chicken  
I make your feet start kickin  
  
No no no no  
  
Oh hey good lookin  
What ya got there cookin  
You a young spring chicken  
Make your feet start kickin  
Boot it out dance without me
