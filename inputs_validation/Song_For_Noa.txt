Hey hey little princess  
So tell me what is your secret  
How do you make my whole world spin around on your own  
  
Your eyes shine like a sunrise by the sea  
Your smile is melting an iceberg inside of me  
Your love is pure as the water fresh from the spring  
  
That is why youre making this world a much more beautiful place  
And I am thankful for every new day  
I get to be with you  
I get to be with you  
  
Hey hey little princess  
So let me tell you a secret  
You are the star in the universe for me  
  
Innocent as a landscape covered with snow  
A colourful mind like a rainbow youve got it too  
Your heart is strong as a mountain and warm like the sun  
  
That is why youre making this world a much more beautiful place  
And I am thankful for every new day  
I get to be with you  
  
That is why youre making this world a much more beautiful place  
And I am thankful for every new day  
I get to be with you  
I get to be with you  
  
All the people that surround you the people that you meet  
Are falling like leaves from a September tree  
When the sky is dark and cloudy and grey youre the candlelight  
I see its shinning for me Its shinning for me  
  
That is why youre making this world a much more beautiful place  
And I am thankful for every new day with you  
And this one is for you for you  
I get to be with you
