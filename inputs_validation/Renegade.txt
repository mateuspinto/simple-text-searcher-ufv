I cant tell you mother why I feel this way  
People passing through my life I let them slip away  
Standing in the bright light let the music play  
Better in the spotlight  
You gotta turn my night to day  
Lead me to the water  
You cant make me drink  
Dressed like a renegade faster than you think  
Cant put down these feelings rising to the boil  
Colours of a rattlesnake ready to uncoil  
Better by far this way  
Turn I want you to turn  
Turn my night to day  
You yourself set me on this course when I was a child  
Walking down these men streets like a boy gone wild  
Programmed for survival  
All will be revealed  
The child is father to the man  
I guess my fate is sealed  
Better by far this way  
Burn my blues  
Burn my blues away  
Like a renegade
