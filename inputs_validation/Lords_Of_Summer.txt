Sight  
Pale riders into the night  
Galloping up harder faster faster  
Through your dreaming wake  
Walk through the fire innate  
Frost bitten soul in a zero zero  
Excitation  
  
Are you remembering the sound  
Recall the shaking of the ground  
Calling calling all as one  
Lords of Summer bring the sun  
Coming coming winters yearn  
Lords of Summer shall return  
  
Eternal thawing has begun  
Come trade your darkness for the sun  
Melting the chill of winters turn  
For soon the Lords of Summer shall return  
Lords of Summer shall return  
  
Straight  
Light passes through penetrate  
Its been a long lonely winter winter  
Illumination bright  
Fading the volume and light  
Reanimated by fire fire  
Transformation  
  
Become the nexus of the sound  
Become the shaking of the ground  
Calling calling all as one  
Lords of summer bring the sun  
Coming coming winters yearn  
Lords of summer have returned  
  
Eternal thawing has begun  
Come trade your darkness for the sun  
Melting the chill of winters turn  
Now that the Lords of Summer have returned  
Lords of Summer have returned  
  
Calling calling all as one  
Lords of summer bring sun  
Coming coming winters yearn  
Lords of summer have returned  
Have returned  
  
Eternal thawing has begun  
Come trade your darkness for the sun  
Melting the chill of winters turn  
Now that the Lords of Summer have returned  
Lords of Summer have returned
