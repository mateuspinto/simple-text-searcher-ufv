God will walk with me down streets where no one else will walk  
God will talk with me of things that no one else will talk  
When no one else will walk and no one else will talk when no one will God will  
God will share with me the little worries no one knows are there  
God will care for me whenever there is no one else to care  
When no one will be there and no one else will share when no one will God will  
God will think of me when friends forget and fail to understand  
God will strengthen me when I am weak and need a helping hand  
When no one understands or lends a helping hand  
When no one will God will when no one will God will
