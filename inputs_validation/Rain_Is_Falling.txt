Early in the morning  
The sun was up and the sky was very blue  
Without a warning  
As I looked out my thoughts returned to you  
A noise in the city made the children run  
And hide themselves away  
And thunder boomed and lightning filled the sky  
  
Looking from this window  
A thousand rivers running past my door  
Standing on an islane looking for someone  
Upon the shore  
I can see it very clearly nothings really changed  
Then lightning strikes across an empty sky  
  
Ooohh the rain is falling  
Ooohh the rain is falling  
Ooohh the rain is falling  
Will it wash away the lonely tears  
  
With their brand new time transporter  
Theyll think maybe I fought to get away  
But with all their great inventions  
And all their good intentions here I stay  
Down on the corner where the sun had shone  
The people gathered round  
Then scattered as the raindrops hit the ground  
  
Ooohh the rain is falling  
Ooohh the rain is falling  
Ooohh the rain is falling  
Will it wash away the lonely tears
