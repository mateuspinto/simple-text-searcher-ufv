He showed you no interest he gave you no love  
From time to time he was funny  
He loved only two things but one was enough for him  
Was it the fame or the money  
  
Was it fame or money  
Lethal vice cold as ice  
Was it fame or money  
Holding tight til everything is all right  
Everything is all right  
  
Up to his eyeballs always in debt  
Hes suddenly off and running  
So what motivation lay at the heart of it  
Was it the fame or the money  
  
Was it fame or money  
Lethal vice cold as ice  
Was it fame or money  
Holding tight til everything is all right  
Everything is all right  
Everything is all right  
  
Were all in the running  
With all of the money  
Take all over and over again  
  
Back in his schooldays foureyed and zits  
No good at games and skinny  
Locked in the boys room left him no choice at all  
Had to be fame and money  
  
So its fame and money  
Lethal vice cold as ice  
So its fame and money  
Holding tight til everything is all right  
Fame and money  
Lethal vice cold as ice  
So its fame and money  
Holding tight til everything is all right  
Everything is all right  
Everything is all right
