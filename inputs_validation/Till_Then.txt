Till then my darling please wait for me  
Till then no matter when it will be  
One day I know Ill be back again  
Please wait till then  
  
Our dreams will live though we are apart  
Our love  I know well keep in our heart  
Till then when all the world will be free  
Please wait for me  
  
Although there are oceans we must cross  
And mountains that we must climb  
I know every gain must have a loss  
So pray that our loss is nothing but time  
  
Till then lets dream of what there will be  
Till then well call on each memory  
Till then when I will hold you again  
Please wait till then
