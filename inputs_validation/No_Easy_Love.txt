There is no easy love  
The one Im thinking of  
I miss you every day  
  
Please just stay around  
You are my beat my sound  
My light my destiny  
  
You rang the door one of a Sunday morning  
Said that I was always on your mind  
Smiled and said its meaningless without me  
Girl youre really one of a kind  
  
There was never anyone  
Until you just came around  
So afraid to be abandoned  
Cant afford to lose again  
  
There is no easy love  
The one Im thinking of  
I miss you night and day  
  
Please just stay around  
You are my beat my sound  
My light my destiny  
  
All I want to do  
Is to be with you  
Have some fun with you yeah  
  
Tired of the past  
It was not a blast  
I dont want to do the same mistake again  
  
I called you up to say that I am sorry  
For all the things I said and I had done  
You told me to relax and not to worry  
You said to me that I was the one  
  
I had been working day and night  
Try to forget your smile so bright  
Didnt know what I should do  
So afraid to choose again  
  
The foolish things we do  
We wish for something new  
Like me when I had you  
  
It doesnt matter to me  
Whatever you choose to be  
My great velocity  
  
Would you talk to me  
Come along with me  
Curiosity yeah  
  
Would you talk to me  
Come along with me  
Leave the past and now this time youll see wont you see  
  
There is no easy love easy love  
The one Im thinking of thinking of  
I miss you everyday everyday  
no no easy love  
  
If you call this romance this romance  
I havent got a chance aint got a chance  
Youre my destiny destiny  
My great velocity
