Highways and dance halls  
A good song takes you far  
Your write about the moon  
And you dream about the stars  
Blues in old motel rooms  
Girls in daddys car  
You sing about the nights  
And you laugh about the scars  
Coffee in the morning cocaine afternoons  
You talk about the weather  
And you grin about the rooms  
Phone calls long distance  
To tell how youve been  
Forget about the losses you exaggerate the wins  
  
And when you stop to let em know  
Youve got it down  
Its just another town along the road  
  
The ladies come to see you  
If your name still rings a bell  
They give you damn near nothin  
And theyll say they knew you well  
So you tell em youll remember  
But they know its just a game  
And along the way their faces  
All begin to look the same  
And when you stop to let em know  
You got it down  
Its just another town along the road  
  
Well it isnt for the money  
And its only for a while  
You stalk about the rooms  
And you roll away the miles  
Gamblers in the neon clinging to guitars  
Youre right about the moon  
But youre wrong about the stars  
And when you stop to let em know  
You got it down  
Its just another town along the way
