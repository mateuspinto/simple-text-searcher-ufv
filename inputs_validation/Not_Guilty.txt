Not guilty  
For getting in your way  
While youre trying to steal the day  
Not guilty  
And Im not here for the rest  
Im not trying to steal your vest  
  
I am not trying to be smart  
I only want what I can get  
Im really sorry for your aging head  
But like you heard me said  
Not guilty  
  
Not guilty  
For being on your street  
Getting underneath your feet  
Not guilty  
No use handing me a writ  
While Im trying to do my bit  
  
I dont expect to take your heart  
I only want what I can get  
Im really sorry that youre underfed  
But like you heard me said  
Not guilty  
  
Not guilty  
For looking like a freak  
Making friends with every Sikh  
Not guilty  
For leading you astray  
On the road to Mandalay  
  
I wont upset the apple cart  
I only want what I can get  
Im really sorry that youve been misled  
But like you heard me said  
Not guilty
