We were headed home in Austin  
Caught pneumonia on the road  
Taking it home to Connie and the kids  
A wheel ran off and jumped a railroad  
Then ran through a grocery store  
  
If you want to buy a bus Im taking bids  
And the devil shivered in his sleeping bag  
He said traveling on the road is such a drag  
If we can make it home by Friday we can brag  
And the devil shivered in his sleeping bag  
  
Well I just got back from New York City  
Kris and Rita done it all  
Raw perfection there for all the world to see  
Lord I heard an angel singing  
In the Philharmonic Hall  
Rita Coolidge Rita Coolidge cleft for me  
And the devil shivered  
And the devil shivered in his sleeping bag
