Gonna walk down that dirt road Til someone will let me ride  
Gonna walk down that dirt road Til someone will let me ride  
If I cant find my baby Im gonna run away and hide  
Well I been pacing round the room hoping maybe she come back  
pacing round the room hoping maybe she come back  
Well I been praying for salvation  
Laying round in a oneroom country shack  
Gonna walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed  
Gonna walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed  
Til theres nothing left to see  
Til the chains have been shattered and I been freed  
But Im looking at my shadow I been watching the clouds up above  
looking at my shadow watching the clouds up above  
Rolling through the rain and hail  
Looking for the sunny side of love  
Gonna walk down that dirt road til everything becomes the same  
Gonna walk down that dirt road til everything becomes the same  
I keep on walking til I hear her holler out my name
