Potiphar had very few cares  
He was one of Egypts millionaires  
Having made a fortune buying shares  
In  
  
Potiphar  
pyramids  
  
Narrator  
Potiphar had made a huge pile  
Owned a large percentage of the Nile  
Meant that he could really live in style  
And he did  
  
Joseph was an uniportant  
Slave who found he liked his master  
Consequently worked much harder  
Even with devotion  
Potiphar could see that Joseph  
Was a cut above the average  
Made him leader of the household  
Maximum promotion  
  
Potiphar was cool and so fine  
  
Potiphar  
But my wife would never tow the line  
  
Narrator  
Its all there in chapter thirtynine of  
Genesis  
She was beautiful but  
  
Potiphars wife  
evil  
  
Narrator  
Saw a lot of men against his will  
He would have to tell her  
That she still was his  
  
Josephs looks and handsome figure  
Had attracted her attention  
Evry morning she would beckon  
  
Potiphars wife  
Come and lie with me love  
  
Narrator  
Joseph wanted to resist her  
Till one day she proved too eager  
Joseph cried in vain  
  
Joseph  
Please stop I dont believe in free love  
  
Narrator  
Potiphar was counting shekels  
In his den below the bedroom  
When he heard a mighty rumpus  
Clattering above him  
Suddenly he knew his riches  
Couldnt buy him what he wanted  
Gold would never make him happy  
If she didnt love him  
  
Letting out a mighty roar  
Potiphar burst through the door  
  
Potiphar  
Joseph Ill see you rot in jail  
The thing you have done are beyond the pale  
  
Narrator  
Poor poor Joseph locked up in a cell  
Things arent going well hey  
Locked up in a cell  
  
Poor poor joseph  
Locked up in a cell  
Things arent going well hey  
Locked up in a cell  
  
Locked up  
In a cell
