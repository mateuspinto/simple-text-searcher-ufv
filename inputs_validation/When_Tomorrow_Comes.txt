Underneath your dreamlit eyes  
Shades of sleep have driven you away  
The moon is pale outside  
And you are far from here  
  
Breathing shifts your careless head  
Untroubled by the chaos of our lives  
Another day another night  
Has taken you again my dear  
  
And you know that Im gonna be the one  
Wholl be there  
When you need someone to depend upon  
When tomorrow comes  
When tomorrow comes  
  
Wait till tomorrow comes yea yea  
Wait till tomorrow comes yea yea  
Last night while you were  
Lying in my arms  
  
And I was wondering where you were  
You know you looked just like a baby  
Fast asleep in this dangerous world  
Every star was shining brightly  
Just like a million years before  
  
And we were feeling very small  
Underneath the universe  
  
And you know that Im gonna be the one  
Wholl be there when you need  
Someone to depend upon  
When tomorrow comes  
When tomorrow comes
