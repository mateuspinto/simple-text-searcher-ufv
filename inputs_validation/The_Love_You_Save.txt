Stop na na na you better save me  
Stop Stop Stop  
You better save me yeah yeah  
  
When we played tag in grade school  
you wanted to be it  
You chased those boys you testified  
You crossed your heart you quit  
When we grew up you traded your promise  
For my ring Now just like back in grade school  
Youre doin the same old thing  
  
Chorus  
Stop the love you save may be your own  
Darlin take it slow or someday youll be all alone  
better stop the love you save may be your own  
Darlin look both ways before you cross me  
Youre heading for a danger zone  
  
Im the one who loves you Im the one you need  
Those other guys will put you down As soon as they succeed  
Theyll ruin your reputation theyll label you a flirt  
The way they talk about you Theyll turn your name to dirt  
Issac said he kissed you underneath the apple tree  
When Benji held your hand you felt the electricity  
When Alexander called you you said he rang your chimes  
Christopher discovered youre way ahead of your time  
  
Chorus  
  
Hold on hold on hold on hold on  
S is for Save me  
T is for Take it Slow  
O is Oh No  
P is for Please Please dont go  
  
Stop the love you save may be your own  
Someday you may be all alone  
Stop it save me girl Baby you better stop  
The love you save may be your own  
  
Darlin take it slow or someday  
Youll be all alone Im the one who loves you  
Im the one you need Those other guys will put you down  
As soon as they succeed  
  
Stop the love you save may be your own  
Baby stop itstop it stop it  
girl youre heading for a danger zone
