Time has saved as time has moved  
Night has come at last to shine on you  
  
Last night I looked inside the moon  
And I knew you were real  
  
So every time I look at you  
You know exactly how I feel  
  
Time has saved us time has moved  
Night has come at last to shine on you  
  
Take the time to know how you will fill my life  
Revolving in my heart  
  
Time has saved us time has moved us  
Night has come at last to shine on you again
