I wished I had you in Carrickfergus  
Only for nights in Ballygrand  
I would swim over the deepest ocean  
The deepest ocean to be by your side  
  
But the sea is wide and I cant swim over  
And neither have I wings to fly  
I wish I could find me a handy boatman  
To ferry me over to my love and die  
  
My childhood days bring back sad reflections  
Of happy days so long ago  
My boyhood friends and my own relations  
Have all passed on like the melting snow  
  
So Ill spend my days in endless roving  
Soft is the grass and my bed is free  
Oh to be home now in Carrickfergus  
On the long road down to the salty sea  
  
And in Kilkenny it is reported  
On marble stone there as black as ink  
With gold and silver I did support her  
But Ill sing no more now till I get a drink  
  
Im drunk today and Im rarely sober  
A handsome rover from town to town  
Oh but I am sick now and my days are numbered  
Come all ye young men and lay me down
