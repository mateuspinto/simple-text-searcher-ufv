Lets go  
  
What happened to the man who used to take me straight into misery  
I want you back and now I must admit it shames me  
How could this be  
Tell me whats this desperation  
Cause I dont recognize hes changed  
I think I made a bad mistake  
  
Cause once I ran away  
I love you since the day the day I broke your heart  
Its more than I could take  
I love you since the day the day we fell apart  
Now everything is coming undone  
Cause you were the chance I cant afford to waste  
I love you since the day the day we fell apart  
  
I must admit the grass is so much greener on the other side  
Since you left I noticed now youre so much meaner  
And its something I think I like  
Tell me whats this desperation  
Cause I dont recognize hes changed  
I think I made a bad mistake  
  
Cause once I ran away  
I love you since the day the day I broke your heart  
Its more than I could take  
I love you since the day the day we fell apart  
Now everything is coming under  
Cause you were the chance I cant afford to waste  
I love you since the day the day we fell apart  
  
I made a bad mistake  
Used to pray for space  
Drowning you one more time  
And mend my wicked ways  
  
Cause once I ran away  
I love you since the day the day I broke your heart  
Its more than I could take  
I love you since the day the day we fell apart  
Now everything is coming under coming under  
Cause you were the chance I cant afford to waste  
I love you since the day the day we fell apart  
The day we fell apart
