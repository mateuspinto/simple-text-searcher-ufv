I hear your heart beating everywhere  
When were apart I can hear you there  
I hear your heart beating everywhere  
Everywhere I go  
  
People say that I must be in love  
The way I forget what were speaking of  
The way I stand there smiling straight ahead  
And walk away without hearing a word they said  
  
I hear your heart beating everywhere  
When were apart I can close my eyes and hear you there  
I hear your heart beating everywhere  
Everywhere I go  
  
In the middle of the football game  
At the beach in the pouring rain  
Standing on a hillside staring at the sun  
People hurry by the unfortunate one  
With the faraway eyes and the mystery smile  
Moving my body in a ragamuffin style  
I cant sit down when I hear it start  
I hear your heart everywhere I go  
  
People say that I must be a fool  
Cause when Im near you I cannot be cool  
I dont quite make sense when I talk to you  
And when you smile I forget everything I knew  
  
I hear your heart beating everywhere  
When were apart I can close my eyes and hear you there  
I hear your heart beating everywhere  
Everywhere I go  
  
Standing in the market where I buy my bread  
With a hunger in my belly and a rhythm in my head  
Looking all around for something good to eat  
Between the butter and the beans and the mops and the meat  
Coffee from the mountain honey from the bee  
Nothing tastes as good as you taste to me  
Rocking in the aisle to my inside song  
People staring at me think I got a Walkman on  
  
I hear your heart beating everywhere  
I hear your heart  
I hear your heart beating everywhere  
I hear your heart  
Beating everywhere I go
