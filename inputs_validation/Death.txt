I will take your final breath  
And I will be your last regret  
  
Cold blood runs in my blackened heart  
Tearing every soul apart  
  
Chorus  
Messenger of death wields the scythe  
Of mans damnation  
Messenger of death hold his blade  
For termination  
  
Sin is what I feast upon  
Im forging my crematorium  
Your tomb is waiting here for you  
Welcome to my ritual  
  
Chorus  
  
Death rides out from the storm  
We turn to God and cry  
Ignored we turn to face  
This vengeance from the sky  
  
Death rides out from the storm  
No time left to repent  
No quarter no escape  
No line of self defense  
  
Death rides out from the storm  
In terror we confess  
Our voice is heard no more  
His deed is merciless  
  
Death rides out from the storm  
Deface humanity  
Theres no escape from this  
Human calamity  
  
Death rides out from the storm  
We turn to God and cry  
Ignored we turn to face  
This vengeance from the sky  
  
Chorus
