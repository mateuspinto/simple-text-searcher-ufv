Im just a man  
please let me  
sing my song  
  
its been ten years  
since I met you  
and I first held your hand  
  
my Suzanne  
  
that summer night  
we dreamed of  
days to come  
  
I held you there  
beside me  
we carved the wishing tree  
  
and then  
we played the part of lovers  
on that summer night  
  
we played the part of lovers  
you gave all your love and you made it seem right  
you made me a man oh so young in my life  
  
one simple verse  
like the words in a play  
you spoke your lines  
and I knew I must stay  
oh I must stay  
  
now we are free  
and we are growing old  
the wishing tree still stands there  
and shades our memories  
  
of when  
we played the part of lovers  
on that summer night  
  
we played the part of lovers  
you gave all your love and you made it seem right  
you made me a man oh so young in my life
