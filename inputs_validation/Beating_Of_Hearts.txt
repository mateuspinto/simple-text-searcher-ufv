Do you know what noise awakes you  
Every morning from your bed  
Acoming from the farthest hillside  
Acoming from inside your head  
  
You have heard  
You have heard the loudest sound  
In this and every world you can think of  
  
Chorus  
Louder than tanks on the highway  
Louder than bombers in flight  
Louder than noises of hatred  
Dancing us from darkest night is the rhythm of love  
Powered on the the beating of hearts  
  
And did you know you had this power  
Drumming on it always stays  
Never try to use it badly  
Tunes of good are all it plays  
  
You have heard  
You have heard the loudest sound  
In this and every world you can visit  
  
Chorus  
  
For a heart without love is a song with no words  
And a tune to which noone is listening  
So your heart must give love and youll find that  
You shine like rain on the leaves youll be glistening  
  
You have heard  
You have heard the loudest sound  
In this and every world you can think of  
  
Louder than thoughts of dictators  
Louder than rattling swords  
Louder than loading of rifles  
Louder than screaming warlords  
  
Chorus
