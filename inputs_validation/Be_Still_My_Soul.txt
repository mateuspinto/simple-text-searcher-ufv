Verse 1  
Surrounded by the cares of Life  
Situations rise they press against my soul  
Desperate thoughts have blocked me in  
Feels like I may lose control  
  
A voice from somewhere inside of me  
Brings comfort and fills my heart with courage  
And lets me know that everything will be alright  
  
Chorus  
I hear Him say  
Be still my soul and know that He is God  
He is God  
Stand quitely  He is the Lord  
If God is for me who can be against me  
He is God  
Be still my soul He is the Lord  
  
Verse 2  
Teach me Lord to stay with You  
When my emotions try to rule me  
Remind me Lord of who I am  
Show me what You want me to be  
  
In His great strength and confidence  
Knowing that You are with me  
Im not afraid of tomorrow  
What waits ahead  
  
Chorus  
I hear Him say  
Be still my soul and know that He is God  
He is God  
Stand quitely  He is the Lord  
If God is for me who can be against me  
He is God  
Be still my soul He is the Lord  
  
Be still my soul He is the Lord  
He is the Lord
