Hand me a tissue  
Hand me your hand  
I feel like crying please understand  
I have been foolish  
  
I crossed that line  
That borders friendship  
In this bed of mine  
We slept together  
  
And it felt so wrong  
Now I know forever  
That that friendship has gone  
She wore the night shirt  
  
You would have worn  
If youd been there  
If I hadve tried  
To stop myself acting  
  
Like I chose to do  
Is this the end  
Need we pretend  
I slept with a friend  
  
And hurt you  
  
Hand me your pencil  
Hand me your heart  
I feel like writing where do I start  
We drank together and jumped into bed  
  
I had the pleasure  
Then I lost my friend  
We slept together and the guilts so strong  
Now I know forever  
  
That that friendship has gone
