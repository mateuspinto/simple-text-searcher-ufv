All that I have I give to you  
All that is love I see in you  
All that I ask this Christmas  
All that I need this Christmas  
All that I want this Christmas is you  
  
All that I am because of you  
You are to me a dream come true  
All that I ask this Christmas  
All that I need this Christmas  
All that I want this Christmas is you  
  
Youre here with me chasing our dreams  
Chasing them everyday  
Tomorrow may be so far away  
Were together each step of the way  
  
All that I pray I pray for you  
I have I have been blessed with all you do  
All that I ask this Christmas  
All that I need this Christmas  
All that I want this Christmas is you haaaaaaaa
