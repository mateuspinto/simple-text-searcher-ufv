Hello  
  
Is there anybody in there  
Just nod if you can hear me  
Is there anyone home  
Come on now  
I hear youre feeling down  
Well I can ease your pain  
Get you on your feet again  
Relax  
Ill need some information first  
Just the basic facts  
Can you show me where it hurts  
  
There is no pain you are receding  
A distant ship smoke on the horizon  
You are only coming through in waves  
Your lips move but I cant hear what youre saying  
When I was a child I had a fever  
My hands felt just like two balloons  
Now Ive got that feeling once again  
I cant explain you would not understand  
This is not how I am  
I have become comfortably numb  
  
OK  
Just a little pinprick  
Therell be no more ah  
But you may feel a little sick  
Can you stand up  
I do believe its working good  
Thatll keep you going through the show  
Come on its time to go  
  
There is no pain you are receding  
A distant ship smoke on the horizon  
You are only coming through in waves  
Your lips move but I cant hear what youre saying  
When I was a child  
I caught a fleeting glimpse  
Out of the corner of my eye  
I turned to look but it was gone  
I cannot put my finger on it now  
The child is grown  
The dream is gone  
I have become comfortably numb
