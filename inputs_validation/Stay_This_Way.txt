You take me to the top  
I wonder when the drop will come  
You make me feel light  
I wonder when the nights will fall  
You make me feel peace  
I wonder when the hearse will come  
You make me feel wise  
I wonder when the time will call  
How can it stay this way  
After the sun theres always rain  
How can it stay this way  
After the sun theres always rain  
You take me to the top  
I wonder when the drop will come  
You make me feel high  
I wonder when the sky will fall  
You make me feel pain  
I wonder when the hearse will come  
You make me feel like  
I wonder when the time will call  
How can it stay this way  
After the sun theres always rain  
How can it stay this way  
After the sun theres always rain  
I hope that we can stay this way  
After the sun I dont want rain  
Hmm
