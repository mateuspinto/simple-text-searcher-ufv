Here we are  
In the maelstrom of love  
Waiting for the call  
To sooth our hearts  
Here we are  
And dont know how to stop  
Waiting for the war  
To end it all  
  
Love is insane and baby  
We are too  
Its our hearts little grave  
And the salt in our wounds  
Love is insane and baby  
So we too yeah  
Its our hearts little grave  
And the salt in our wounds  
  
Here we are  
Right back where we began  
Waiting for sweet love  
With open arms  
Here we are  
Just like before  
Waiting for the wounds  
Of that tender storm  
  
Love is insane and baby  
We are too  
Its our hearts little grave  
And the salt in our wounds  
Love is insane and baby  
So we too yeah  
Its our hearts little grave  
And the salt in our wounds  
  
Love is insane and baby  
We are too  
Its our hearts little grave  
And the salt in our wounds  
Love is insane and baby  
So we too yeah  
Its our hearts little grave  
And the salt in our wounds  
  
Love is insane and baby  
We are too  
Its our hearts little grave  
And the salt in our wounds  
Love is insane and baby  
So we too yeah  
Its our hearts little grave  
And the salt in our wounds  
  
The salt in our wounds  
The salt in our wounds
