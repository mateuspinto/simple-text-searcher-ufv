Fate silent warriors sleeping souls will arise  
Once forgotten soldiers come to life  
Fallen mercenary dormancy is done  
Not content with wars we never won  
  
Memories cant ignore  
Anguish of before  
Satisfy the scorn  
Rise ghosts of war  
  
Target assassinate time of your life has expired  
Hatred victimize gaze in their eyes as they die  
Violence inflicting of pain savage morticians deny  
Drive the salt in the wound arouse the subconscious to lie  
  
Memories cant ignore  
Anguish of before  
Satisfy the scorn  
Rise ghosts of war  
  
I deal in pain  
All life I drain  
I dominate  
I seal your fate  
  
I deal in pain  
All life I drain  
Memories cant ignore  
Rise ghost of war
