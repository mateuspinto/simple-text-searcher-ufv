Easy now with my heart  
Easy now oh with my heart  
Walk a tightrope walk a little tightrope  
You walk a tightrope walk a little tightrope  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh this heart is burning up  
I said oh oh oh oh oh oh oh this heart is burning up  
Careful now ooo with my head  
I said careful now what you do to my head  
Well make your mind up make your little mind up  
To reach is oh to reach is to oh oh oh  
But oh oh oh oh oh oh oh this heart is burning up  
I said oh oh oh oh oh oh this heart is burning up  
  
In my bed Im rolling over  
Im tangling up in chains on the swings on the set on the night that we met  
And now the beads of water move up the glass  
You speak your mind and you can not take it back  
Walk a tightrope walk a little tightrope  
Walk a tightrope walk a little tightrope  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh this heart is burning up  
I said oh oh oh oh oh oh oh this heart is burning up  
I said oh oh oh oh oh oh oh this heart is burning up  
I said oh oh oh oh oh oh oh this heart is burning up  
Its its burning up  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
