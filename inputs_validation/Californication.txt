Psychic spies from China  
Try to steal your minds elation  
And little girls from Sweden  
Dreams of silver screen quotation  
And if you want these kind of dreams  
Its Californication  
  
Its the edge of the world  
And all of western civilization  
The sun may rise in the East  
At least it settles in the final location  
Its understood that Hollywood  
Sells Californication  
  
Pay your surgeon very well  
To break the spell of aging  
Celebrity skin is this your chin  
Or is that war your waging  
  
Chorus  
First born unicorn  
Hard core soft porn  
Dream of Californication  
Dream of Californication  
  
Marry me girl be my fairy to the world  
Be my very own constellation  
A teenage bride with a baby inside  
Getting high on information  
And buy me a star on the boulevard  
Its Californication  
  
Space may be the final frontier  
But its made in a Hollywood basement  
Cobain can you hear the spheres  
Singing songs off station to station  
And Alderaans not far away  
Its Californication  
  
Born and raised by those who praise  
Control of population everybodys been there and  
I dont mean on vacation  
  
Chorus  
  
Destruction leads to a very rough road  
But it also breeds creation  
And earthquakes are to a girls guitar  
Theyre just another good vibration  
And tidal waves couldnt save the world  
From Californication  
  
Pay your surgeon very well  
To break the spell of aging  
Sicker than the rest  
There is no test  
But this is what youre craving  
  
Chorus
