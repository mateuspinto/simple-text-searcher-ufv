Lookin back on my life  
You know that all I see  
Are things I couldve changed  
I should have done  
Where did the good times go  
Good times so hard to hold  
This time this time  
This time Im gonna find  
Lookin back on my life  
You know that all I see  
Are things I couldve changed  
I could have done  
No time for sad lament  
A wasted life is bitter spent  
  
So rise into the light  
In or out of time  
Gonna rise straight through the light  
In or out of time  
  
Woke up one other day  
The pain wont go away  
I am growing  
In peculiar ways  
Into a light I pass  
Another dream another trance  
This time this time  
This time Im gonna rise into the light  
In or out of time  
  
Gonna find my way in life  
In or out of sight  
Im still seeing things in black and white  
Gonna rise straight into the light  
In or out of sight  
  
Im gonna see the light  
Im gonna see the light  
Im gonna see the light  
  
Cause I know there is time  
There is time  
There is time  
There is time  
There is time  
There is time  
There is time  
There is time  
This time this time  
This time this time  
This time this time  
This time this time
