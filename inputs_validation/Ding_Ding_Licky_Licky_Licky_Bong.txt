It seems like it only happened yesterday  
Now that I think about it  
Tears cannot bring you joy  
But joy can bring you tears  
Even though I cry today  
I will not hide it  
It is for a different reason  
That is why Ill shout it out  
For the world to hear  
I say Hello hello happiness  
Oh Jah thank you  
For another day  
I say  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
I say  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Another tear drop falls  
But I dont care  
I took a wrong turn in life before  
But Ive paid my dues  
Objects in the rear view mirror  
They appear closer than they are  
If you dont talk the talk  
Dont walk the walk  
If you wont please dont tease  
Another lesson learned  
Im gonna shout it out again  
Hello hello happiness  
Oh God thank you  
For another chance  
There is no future in the past  
So shout it out  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
They say  
Ding ding licky licky licky bong  
Hey Ringo come and dance with me  
Come on come on  
Rasta  
Come and spend my shoes  
Hey Greek women  
Rasta
