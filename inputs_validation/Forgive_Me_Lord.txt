Make my world a better place to be  
Remove these chains and set me free  
Give my life one reason to begin  
Forgive me Lord for I have sinned  
  
Take my hand and lead me as you choose  
It seems we aint got much to lose  
Give this place one season without shame  
Forgive me Lord Ive sinned again  
  
I been down on my luck as a matter of fact  
Ive even been chaste  
Drifting along singing a song  
For the whole human race  
I been caught in the act as a matter of fact  
Im even well known  
Floating on by with a laugh and a sigh  
On the road that leads home  
I got no more time left to roam if you love me  
  
Take this world and build it as you please  
With a little help from the likes of me  
Keep it safe from harm and make it pure  
Forgive the rich and save the poor  
  
Like the dust on the wind Ive been taken again by my foolish pride  
Drifting along singing a song thats how I get by  
I been caught in the act as a matter of fact Ive even been chased  
Floating on by with a laugh and a sigh for the whole human race  
I got no more time left to waste if you love me  
  
Make my world a better place to be  
Remove these chains and set me free  
Give my face a different point of view  
Forgive us Lord if we run to you  
  
If you love me  
Make my world a better place to be  
Remove these chains and set me free  
Give my life one reason to begin  
Forgive me Lord for I have sinned  
Give my life one reason to begin  
Forgive me Lord for I have sinned
