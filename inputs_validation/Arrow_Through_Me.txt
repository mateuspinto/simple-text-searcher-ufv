Ooh baby  
You couldnt have done a worse thing to me  
If youd had taken an arrow and runned right through me  
Uh uh uh uh  
  
Ooh baby  
A bird in the hand is worth two flying  
But when it came to love I knew youd be lying  
  
It could have been a finer fling  
Would have been a major attraction  
With no other thing  
Offering a note of distraction  
Come on get up get under way and bring your love  
  
Ooh baby  
You wouldnt have found a more down hero  
If youd had started at nothing and counted to zero  
  
Oooooo  
  
Ooh baby  
You couldnt have done a worse thing to me  
If youd had taken an arrow and runned right through me  
  
It could have been a finer fling  
Flying in a righter direction  
With no other thing  
Featuring but love and affection  
Come on get up get under way and bring your love  
  
Ooh baby  
You wouldnt have found a more down hero  
If youd had started at nothing and counted to zero  
  
Ah Ooh
