Once upon a time there was a toy soldier and he lived in the play room  
Once upon a time there was a toy soldier with a whip lash in his hand  
And every night little girl sadie would take all her clothes off and wind up
the toy soldier and he raised his whip and said  
On your knees little sadie  
Little sadie on your knees  
Taste the whip and love might given likely  
Taste the whip and bleed for me  
Little sadie loved her little toy soldier  
And she run home from school each day  
Little sadie loved her little toy soldier  
And she locked her door so she could play  
Little sadie got ambitious  
And wound the clockworks so to tighter  
So he could whip her harder and harder  
On your knees little sadie  
Little sadie on your knees  
Taste the whip and love might given likely  
Taste the whip and bleed for me  
One day sadie wound and wound  
And wound and wound  
And wound and wound  
Til suddenly the little toy soldier spring went    
ugly beat her to death  
Ahhhh  
Cough cough cough
