Is it alive does it writhe  
Can it survive under the sun  
I cant put my finger on it  
Is it green is it red  
  
Is it alive or is it dead  
I cant put my finger on it  
Scathe with a lathe  
All the days in the past  
  
I cant put my finger on it  
Is it brown is it white  
Is it really outta sight  
I cant put my finger on it  
  
Can it squeal does it squirm  
If its fresh will it burn  
I cant put my finger on it  
Can it fly will it try  
  
If the wings are still wet  
I cant put my finger on it  
Can it heal is it real  
Can it feel the threads of time  
  
I cant put my finger on it  
Does it glow will it shine  
Does it leave a trail of slime  
I cant put my finger on it  
  
Repeat x3  
Are you surprised when I touch the dwarf inside
