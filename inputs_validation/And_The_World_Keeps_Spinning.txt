And the World Keeps Spinning  
Well I never thought that I could make it alone  
Thought I would die but I seem to carry on  
And I thought my life would surely leave  
And though almost I have not ceased to be  
And even though I thought I lost everything  
Today I found that the birds still sing in the morning  
And the world keeps spinning round  
And the world keeps spinning round  
When someone says goodbye another dream ends  
And just before you give up another dream begins  
Someone changed their mind tears fall to the ground  
But you know that one mans smile is anothers frown  
And the table will turn someday thats how life is  
I have no doubt cause you know that time dont stand still  
All the world keeps spinning round  
Yes the world keeps spinning round  
Dawn will find me here and I think about  
One that I thought I couldnt live without  
One day she was here the next day gone  
But the love that was never clear was just alone  
And how can you lose something you only thought  
That you found so you wipe away the tears with a smile  
All the world keeps spinning round  
Yes the world keeps spinning round  
All the world keeps spinning round  
All the world keeps spinning round
