Early in the morning when the dew is on  
Each and every rose bud you will find me gone  
So knock me down and pick me up  
And knock me down again  
Break my heart steal my gold  
And slander my good name  
Seven lonely hours on the morning train  
Takes me to a place where I wont come back again  
Seven lonely Pullmans speedin down the line  
Takin me away from an old love of mine  
  
Sixteen miles to seven lakes way up among the pines  
In some hidden valley where the twirlin river twines  
Where the fish swim up and down  
And the sparklin water falls  
Where the thunder rolls  
And the lonely puma calls  
  
Somewhere on the mountain Ill take another name  
Rid my mind of memories and start my life again  
Somewhere in the wilderness  
Ill build a cabin small  
Then forget so I  
Wont remember you at all
