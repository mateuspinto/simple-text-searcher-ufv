I watch you breathe I cannot sleep  
I touch your hair I kiss your skin  
And hope the morning sun wont wake you too soon  
For when you wake and look at me  
You never know you just might see  
Another boy who crept in your room  
Take your timethats what you told me  
Take your time  
But I fell head first and I just dont know what to do  
  
Chorus  
Nothing looks the same in the light  
Only a fool like me would take to heart  
The things you said you meant last night  
Nothing looks the same in the light  
Ill keep my feet firm on the ground  
Nothing looks the same in the light  
Theres danger in a stranger  
With a warm hand and a kiss so right  
Nothing looks the same in the light  
Its been a pleasure  see you around  
  
I watch the sun upon the sheets  
I hear a car out on the street  
And gently pull you close its over too soon  
What can I do but wait and see  
Hold on to you please stay with me  
Because youre the first and I want to stay here with you  
  
Chorus
