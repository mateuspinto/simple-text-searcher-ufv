I am not passers by I am not a white lie  
I am not left to die I am love I am love  
I am not feeling sad I am not a few fad  
I am not quickly mad I am love I am love  
  
You can try to hide you can try to run  
But youll never run far enough  
This is my flesh this is my blood  
And I am love  
You can fly up high You can dig down deep  
You can flee to the west  
You can flee to the east  
But you cant escape what Ive done  
I am love  
  
I am not standing by i am not letting go  
I am not leaving you i am love i am love  
My blood feel like the rain  
I did not bleed in vain  
But from my veins  
I am love
