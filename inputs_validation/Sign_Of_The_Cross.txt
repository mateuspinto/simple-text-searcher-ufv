Eleven saintly shrouded men  
Silhouettes stand against the sky  
One in front with a cross held high  
Come to wash my sins away  
  
Standing alone in the wind and rain  
Feeling the fear that is growing  
Sensing the change in the tide again  
Brought by the storm that is brewing  
Feel the anxiety hold off the fear  
Some of the doubt in the things you believe  
Now that your faith will be put to the test  
Nothing to do but await what is coming  
  
Why then is god still protecting me  
Even when I dont deserve it  
Thought I am blessed with an inner strength  
Some they would call it a penance  
Why am I meant to face this alone  
Asking the question time and again  
Praying to God wont keep me alive  
Inside my head feel the fear start to rise  
  
Theyll be saying their prayers  
when the moment comes  
Therell be penance to pay when its judgment day  
And the guiltyll bleed when the moment comes  
Theyll be coming to claim  
take your soul away  
  
The sign of the cross  
The name of the rose  
a fire in the sky  
The sign of the cross  
  
Theyll be coming to bring the eternal flame  
Theyll be bringing us all immortality  
Holding communion so the world be blessed  
My creator my Godll lay my soul to rest  
  
Lost the love of heaven above  
Chose the lust of the earth below  
Eleven saintly shrouded men  
Came to wash my sins away
