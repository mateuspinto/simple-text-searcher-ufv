New York snow this time of year  
Theres nothing more beautiful to me  
Except for you  
  
Making my way uptown and down  
Seeing familiar places faces  
In my pile of coffee grounds  
  
The days are better the nights are still so long  
Sometimes I think Im the only cab on the road  
Sometimes I think Im the only cab on the road  
  
Watching my breath rise in the sun  
Pulling myself in to make warm  
Helplessly feel for my phone and drive away  
  
This new rhythm I pursue  
Is just my gettin over you  
Telling myself that I need to  
  
The days are better the nights are still so long  
Sometimes I think Im the only cab on the road  
Sometimes I think Im the only cab on the road  
  
Im still looking for a fare no one said that it was fair  
To be alone  
  
The days are better the nights are still so long  
Sometimes I think Im the only cab on the road  
The days are better the nights are still so long  
Sometimes I think Im the only cab on the road  
Sometimes I think Im the only cab on the road
