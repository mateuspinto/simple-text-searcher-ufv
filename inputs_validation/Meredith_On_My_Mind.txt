When the sun comes up and I awake  
I think of you  
When I walk out to meet the day  
I think of you  
When the morning wind is in my face  
I think of you  
And youre on my mind  
On my mind  
And youre on my mind all the time  
  
When the sun gets high and heals the day  
I think of you  
When the air is still and the earth ablaze  
I think of you  
When the shadows stretch and start to fade  
I think of you  
And youre on my mind  
On my mind  
And youre on my mind all the time  
  
When the sun gets low and the day gets cold  
I think of you  
When the evening winds rise up and blow  
I think of you  
In the nights of silver black and gold  
I think of you  
And youre on my mind  
On my mind  
And youre on my mind all the time  
  
When the sun gets low and the day gets cold  
I think of you  
When the evening winds rise up and blow  
I think of you  
In the nights of silver black and gold  
I think of you  
And youre on my mind  
On my mind  
And youre on my mind all the time
