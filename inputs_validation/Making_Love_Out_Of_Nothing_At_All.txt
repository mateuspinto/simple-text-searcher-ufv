I know just how to whisper  
And I know just how to cry  
I know just where to find the answers  
And I know just how to lie  
I know just how to fake it  
And I know just how to scheme  
I know just when to face the truth  
And then I know just when to dream  
And I know just where to touch you  
And I know just what to prove  
I know when to pull you closer  
And I know when to let you loose  
And I know the night is fading  
And I know the times gonna fly  
And Im never gonna tell you everything Ive gotta tell you  
But I know Ive gotta give it a try  
And I know the roads to riches  
And I know the ways to fame  
I know all the rules and then I know how to break em  
And I always know the name of the game  
But I dont know how to leave you  
And Ill never let you fall  
And I dont know how you do it  
  
Making love out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all  
Making love out of nothing at all  
  
Everytime I see you all the rays of the sun are  
Streaming through the waves in your hair  
And every star in the sky is taking aim at  
Your eyes like a spotlight  
The beating of my heart is a drum and its lost  
And its looking for a rhythm like you  
You can take the darkness from the pit of the night  
And turn into a beacon burning endlessly bright  
Ive gotta follow it cause everything I know  
Well its nothing til I give it to you  
I can make the runner stumble  
I can make the final block  
And I can make every tackle at the sound of the whistle  
I can make all the stadiums rock  
I can make tonight forever  
Or I can make it disappear by the dawn  
And I can make you every promise that has ever been made  
And I can make all your demons be gone  
But Im never gonna make it without you  
Do you really want to see me crawl  
And Im never gonna make it like you do  
  
Making love out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all out of nothing at all
