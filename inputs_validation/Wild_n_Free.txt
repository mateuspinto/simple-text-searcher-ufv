Oh Id never known what it was like to free  
I always thought it was never true  
I got a feeling I was lost in space  
Did not like my face  
Just wanted to be

Wild n free wild n free  
Oh insanitys so insane  
Wild n free wild n free

Wild n free wild n free  
Dont want no ball and chain  
  
Damn people telling me that I was thinking bad  
Had me believing they was right  
All they wanted was another slob  
In some stinking job  
That just aint me I just want to be

Just then I found out I was too broke to get out  
So I took to the road no one was having me  
I said dont want no handouts  
Cause Im making out  
You aint like me I just want to be  
Uh uh uh wild n free  
  
I tried to tell you babe but you never understood  
I always tried to make you see  
But you believed just what your old man said  
He had you chained to his head  
And its on tv tv tv tv  
Want to be want to be want to be  
Wild n free wild n free

Wild n free wild n free
