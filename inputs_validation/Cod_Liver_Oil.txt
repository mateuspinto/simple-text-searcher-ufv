Im a young married man and Im tired of life  
Ten years Ive been wed to a pale sickly wife  
Shes nothing to do only sit there and cry  
Praying and praying to God she would die  
A friend of my own came to see me one day  
He told me my wife she was pining away  
He afterwards told me that she would get strong  
If I get a bottle from dear Dr John  
  
Chorus  
Oh doctor oh doctor oh dear Dr John  
Your cod liver oil is so pure and so strong  
Im afraid of my life Ill go down in the soil  
If me wife dont stop drinking your cod liver oil  
  
I bought her a bottle well just for to try  
And the way that she drank it  
Youd think she might die  
I bought her another it vanished the same  
And then she got cod liver oil on the brain  
I bought her another she drank it no doubt  
And then she began to get terrible stout  
And when she got stout  
Well of course she got strong  
And I became jealous of dear Dr John  
  
Chorus  
  
My house it resembles a great doctors shop  
Its covered in bottles from bottom to top  
Well early the morning the kettle does boil  
You would swear it was singing of cod liver oil  
  
Oh doctor oh doctor oh dear Dr John  
Your cod liver oil is so pure and so strong  
Im afraid of my life Ill go down in the soil  
If me wife dont stop drinking  
  
Chorus
