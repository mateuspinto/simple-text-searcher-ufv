If you ever go across the sea to Ireland  
Then maybe at the closing of your day  
You will sit and watch the moon rise over Claddagh  
Or watch the sun go down on Galway Bay  
  
For the breezes blowing oer the sea to Ireland  
Are perfumed by the heather as they blow  
And the women in the uplands diggin praties  
Speak a language that the strangers do not know  
  
For the strangers came and tried to teach their way  
And scorned us just for being what we are  
But they might as well go chasing after moonbeams  
Or light a penny candle from a star  
  
And if there is going to be a life hereafter  
And somehow I am sure theres going to be  
I will ask my God to let me make my heaven  
In that dear land across the Irish sea
