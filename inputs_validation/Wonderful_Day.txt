It was a hot hot day middle of may  
Saw my baby walking my way  
She is the cutest thing Ive ever seen  
Shes got the black black hair  
Little black dress  
And a suit of pair  
Little hunny she walked up to me  
  
we walk and we talk  
We dont have no time to stop that day  
That day was a wonderful day that day   
Was the best damn day that day  
  
well I lost my mind  
I done lost my mind a thousand times  
And you would too  
If you see the things I do  
Oo my baby she burns my world down  
And I cannot thank her enough  
For letting me wear the crown  
And one day she walk up to me  
And that was the best damn day  
I got in my life in my life in my life  
  
so we walk and we talk   
We dont have no time to stop that day   
That day was a wonderful  
That day best damn day that day  
That day that day that day  
Was such a wonderful day  
  
how many of you guys feel  
That today is a wonderful day  
Lets take that attitude into the rest  
Of the evening and into tomorrow  
We appreciate you guys being here tonight
