We were sittin round the supper table and the buzz of the frigidaire  
Was the only sound til momma laid down a book she found upstairs  
It was covered in dust in the back of the closet  
Goodwill box we almost tossed it out  
We could have lost all those memories  
  
There was a picture of mama in the pouring rain  
Ticket stubs to a Braves game  
Silver star and a baggage claim from Hanoi Vietnam  
There was a picture of him callin on grandpa  
Leather skin from a baseball  
We laughed and cried told stories all night long  
From the book of John  
  
Now the pot of coffees almost gone as we turn another page  
Were climbing on him like a Jungle Jim watching his hair turn gray  
All the Polaroids are just reminders  
You cant hold life in a three ring binder  
We flipped on through em anyway  
  
Theres a picture at his sister taken in July  
On the steps of the church pulling out his tie  
Hairs still wet from gettin baptized the brand new blue suit on  
An old set of keys to his Chevrolet  
A crumpled up receipt for a wedding ring  
We watched ourselves grow up there in his arms  
In the book of John  
  
That sun came up we were wide awake  
Head to toe in black and gray  
Long black Lincoln waiting down the drive  
He was father son husband and friend  
I still flip through it every now and then  
When I need just a few words of advice  
Its almost like hes not really gone  
And I know one day Ill be passin on  
The book of John
