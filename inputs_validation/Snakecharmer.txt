Satellites and pair of mirrors and and a man without a home  
With a horse and a rider and a clever cunning killer  
Silent in error and vocal in spotlights  
Lying always sucking on a bottle of that sweet indulgent fluid  
Oh greed oh yes oh greed oh yes  
Oh greed oh yes  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Your friendship is a fog  
That disappears when the wind redirects  
You  
Yes you  
  
Fathers expectations soul soaked in spit and urine  
And you gotta make it where  
To a sanctuary thats a fragile American hell  
An empty dream  
A selfish horrific vision  
Passed on like the deadliest of viruses  
Crushing you and your naive profession  
Have no illusions boy  
Vomit all ideals and serve  
Sleep and wake and serve  
And dont just think just wake and serve  
Yeah  
Yeah Left channel  26 years in this stage  
Yeah youre 26 years in this stage  
Yeah  
Your friendship is a fog  
That disappears when the wind redirects  
You Interested in you interested in you  
Interested in you interested in you
