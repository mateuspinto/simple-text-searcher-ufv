Gently your eyes met mine  
Tender trusting true  
Gently your hand took mine  
Thrilled me through and through  
  
Gently oh so gently  
Gentle as the dawn  
Gently oh so gently  
Our true love was born  
  
Gently your lips kissed mine  
As we strolled along  
Gently your heart touched mine  
Young and warm and strong  
  
Gently the hour is near  
When true loves have to part  
Gently well meet again  
One more kiss sweetheart
