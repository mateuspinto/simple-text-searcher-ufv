You are too beautiful my dear  
To be true  
And I am a fool for beauty  
Fooled by the feeling that  
Because I had found you  
I could have bound you too  
  
You are too beautiful  
For one man alone  
For one lucky fool to be with  
When there are other men  
With eyes of their own  
To see with  
  
Love does not stand sharing  
Not if you care  
Have you been comparing  
My every kiss with theirs  
  
If on the other hand Im faithful  
To you  
Its not through a sense of duty  
You are too beautiful  
And I am a fool for beauty
