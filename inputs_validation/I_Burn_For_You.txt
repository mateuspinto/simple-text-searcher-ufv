Now that I have found you  
In the coolth of your evening smile  
The shade of your parasol  
And your love flows through me  
Though I drink at your pool  
I burn for you I burn for you  
  
You and I are lovers  
When night time folds around our bed  
In peace we sleep entwined  
And your love flows through me  
Though an ocean soothes my head  
I burn for you I burn for you  
  
Stars will fall from dark skies  
As ancient rocks are turning  
Quiet fills the room  
And your love flows through me  
Though I lie here so still  
I burn for you I burn for you  
  
I burn
