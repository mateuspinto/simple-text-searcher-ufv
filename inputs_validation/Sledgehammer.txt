You could have a steam train  
If youd just lay down your tracks  
You could have an aeroplane flying  
If you bring your blue sky back  
  
All you do is call me  
Ill be anything you need  
  
You could have a big dipper  
Going up and down all around the bends  
You could have a bumper car bumping  
This amusement never ends  
  
I want to be your sledgehammer  
Why dont you call my name  
Oh let me be your sledgehammer

Cause I will be your honey bee  
Open up your fruit cages  
Where the fruit is as sweet as can be
