A passing ship  
I have found the open ocean  
Give me no lip  
The waves roll by as I pass on  
A sunlit sea  
On the first day of April  
How fresh the wind  
Will you miss me when Im gone  
How many words  
How many songs still unwritten  
How many ships  
Of the line have come and gone  
In the good old days  
May they never be forgotten  
They had heavy wind  
Or they had no wind at all  
A passing ship  
It is midnight on the ocean  
Had a real long trip  
I have been at sea all winter  
When my ship came in  
I was givin up the ghost  
I think I should be  
Leavin those passing ships alone  
When the sea runs high  
The sea runs wild and Im unsteady  
And I think of you  
In the warmth of your home and family  
When love is true  
There is no truer occupation  
And may this gale  
Blow us to the ones we love  
Another day another ocean  
Give me no lip  
But stand aside as I pass on  
A sunlit sea  
On the last day in October  
How fresh the wind  
Will you miss me from now on  
I guess I should be  
Leavin passing ships alone
