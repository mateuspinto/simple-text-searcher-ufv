Words and music by bob seger  
  
Theres a hard moon risin on the streets tonight  
Theres a reckless feeling in your heart as you head out tonight  
Through the concrete canyons to the midtown light  
Where the latest neon promises are burning bright  
  
Past the open windows on the darker streets  
Where unseen angry voices flash and children cry  
Past the phony posers with their worn out lines  
The tired new money dressed to the nines  
The low life dealers with their bad designs  
And the dilettantes with their open minds  
  
Youre out on the town safe in the crowd  
Ready to go for the ride  
Searching the eyes looking for clues  
Theres no way you can hide  
The fire inside  
  
Well youve been to the clubs and the discotheques  
Where they deal one another from the bottom of a deck of promises  
Where the cautious loners and emotional wrecks  
Do an acting stretch as a way to hide the obvious  
And the lights go down and they dance real close  
And for one brief instant they pretend theyre safe and warm  
  
Then the beat gets louder and the mood is gone  
The darkness scatters as the lights flash on  
They hold one another just a little too long  
And they move apart and then move on  
  
On to the street on to the next  
Safe in the knowledge that they tried  
Faking the smile hiding the pain  
Never satisfied  
The fire inside  
Fire inside  
  
Now the hour is late and he thinks youre asleep  
You listen to him dress and you listen to him leave  
Like you knew he would  
You hear his car pull away in the street  
Then you move to the door and you lock it when  
Hes gone for good  
  
Then you walk to the window and stare at the moon  
Riding high and lonesome through a starlit sky  
And it comes to you how it all slips away  
Youth and beauty are gone one day  
No matter what you dream or feel or say  
It ends in dust and disarray  
  
Like wind on the plains sand through the glass  
Waves rolling in with the tide  
Dreams die hard and we watch them erode  
But we cannot be denied  
The fire inside
