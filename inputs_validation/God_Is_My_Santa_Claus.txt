In a class room at the grade school just before the Hollidays  
Boys and girls were writing notes to Santa far away  
Expect a lad who sat alone his paper put away  
And when his teacher asked him why so softly he did say  
Oh God is my Santa Claus each and every day  
I dont write him letters mam I just kneel and pray  
Dont you know his greatest gift salvation is afound  
God is my Santa Claus each day the whole youre round  
  
Then the teacher stood in silence after what the child had said  
He really knew real Christmas day and not from books hed read  
He truly met real Santa Clause he said him just one word  
God gave his praise for Christmas day my Santa Clause is God  
God is my Santa Claus each and every day  
I dont write him letters mam I just kneel and pray  
Do you know his greatest gift salvation is afonud  
God to be my Santa Claus each day the whole youre round
