To dream the impossible dream  
To fight the unbeatable foe  
To bear with unbearable sorrow  
And to run where  
The brave dare not go  
To right the unrightable wrong  
And to love pure and chaste from afar  
To try when your arms are too weary  
To reach the unreachable star  
This is my quest  
To follow that star  
No matter how hopeless  
No matter how far  
To fight for the right  
Without question or pause  
To be willing to march  
March into hell  
For that heavenly cause  
And I know  
If Ill only be true  
To this glorious quest  
That my heart  
Will lie peaceful and calm  
When Im laid to my rest  
And the world will be  
Better for this  
That one man scorned  
And covered with scars  
Still strove with his last  
Ounce of courage  
To reach the unreachable  
The unreachable  
The unreachable star  
And Ill always dream  
The impossible dream  
Yes and Ill reach  
The unreachable star
