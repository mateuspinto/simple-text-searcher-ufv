Allow me to set the scene first  
This little ngga no older than 17 in a Martin Luther King shirt  
Walking down the mean merc where the fiends lurk  
And the same dirtll find a ngga  
Even if you tryna get that clean work  
He caught eyes with a bad bitch in a jean skirt  
She gave him a mean smurk he smiled back  
  
He remember this man that hit that shit a while back  
He met her fcked her never dialled back  
How nggas do He kept it moving couldnt wait to get home  
Report card for his mother couldnt wait to get shown  
Straight As as usual his momma would smile  
Youngest child college bound  
Knew his momma was proud  
Cause he was headed out the hood  
He promised himself one day hed get her out for good  
That made him smile  
The favourite child but damn fate is foul  
Drive by stray bullets that laid him out  
On the pavement fading out  
Now he bleeding thinking God man you couldnt wait a while  
My momma struggling who gon save her now huh  
Now he fading out thinking God you couldnt wait a while  
My momma need me who gon save her now ngga Uh  
Yeah hes fading out her favourie child  
Hes fading out
