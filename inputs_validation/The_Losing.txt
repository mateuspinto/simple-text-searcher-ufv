Such a drag to want something sometime  
One thing leads to another I know  
Was a time wanted you for mine  
Nobody knew  
You arrived like a day  
And passed like a cloud  
I made a wish I said it out loud  
Out loud in a crowd  
Everybody heard  
twas the talk of the town  
  
Its not my place to know what you feel  
Id like to know but why should i  
Who were you then who are you now  
Common labourer by night by day highbrow  
Back in my room I wonder then i  
Sit on the bed look at the sky  
Up in the sky  
Clouds rearrange  
Like the talk of the town  
  
Maybe tomorrow maybe someday  
Maybe tomorrow maybe someday  
Youve changed your place in this world  
Youve changed your place in this world  
  
Oh but its hard to live by the rules  
I never could and still never do  
The rules and such never bothered you  
You call the shots and they follow  
I watch you still from a distance then go  
Back to my room you never know  
I want you I want you but now  
Whos the talk of the town
