People see us everywhere  
They think you really care  
But myself I cant deceive  
I know its only make believe  
  
My one and only prayer is that some day youll care  
My hopes my dreams come true my one and only you  
No one will ever know how much I love you so  
My only prayer will be someday youll care for me  
But its only make believe  
  
My hopes my dreams come true my life Id give for you  
My heart a wedding ring my all my everything  
My heart I cant control you rule my very soul  
My only prayer will be someday youll care for me  
But its only make believe  
  
My one and only prayer is that some day youll care  
My hopes my dreams come true my one and only you  
No one will ever know how much I love you so  
My prayer my hope and my schemes you are my every dream  
But its only make believe
