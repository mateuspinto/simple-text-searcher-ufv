I see a man without a problem  
I see a country always starved  
I hear the music of a heartbeat  
I walk and people turn and laugh  
  
Is it in my head  
Is it in my head  
Is in my head here at the start  
Is it in my head  
Is it in my head  
Is it in my head or in my heart  
  
I pick up phones and hear my history  
I dream of all the calls I miss  
I try to number those who love me  
And find exactly what the trouble is  
  
Is it in my head etc  
I feel Im being followed  
My head is empty  
Yet every word I say turns out a sentence  
Make love to a stranger  
Just asking for directions  
Turn from being help to being questions  
  
I see a man without a problem
