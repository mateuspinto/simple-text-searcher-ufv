Ooh  
Kelly  
Watchin every motion in  
The foolish lovers game On  
This endliss ocean Finally lovers  
No shame Turning and returning to  
Some secert place inside watchin in slow  
Motion as you turn around and say my love  
  
Chours Both  
Take my breath away  
Take my breath away  
  
Kalan  
Watching I keep waiting  
Still anticipating love never  
Hisating to become the faded  
Ones Turning and returning to  
Some secert place inside watching  
In slow motion as you turn around  
And say  
  
Chours Both  
Take my breath away  
Take my breath away  
  
Both  
Through the hour glass  
I saw you in time you slipped away  
When the mirrior crashed I called to you  
And say  
  
Kelly  
If only for today Iam unfraid  
  
Repeat Chours  
  
Kelly  
Ohh you take my breath away kalan  
Ohhh  
  
Both  
TAKE MY BREATH AWAY  
  
Chours Both  
Take my breath away  
Take my breath away  
Repeat till fade
