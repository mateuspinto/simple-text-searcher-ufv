Lonely lonely lonely lonely eyes  
lonely face lonely lonely in your place  
Lonely lonely lonely eyes lonely face  
lonely lonely in your place  
  
I thought that I knew all that there was to  
lonely lonely lonely  
  
Melanie Jane wont feel the pain  
Lonely lonely lonely eyes lonely eyes  
lonely lonely in your place  
  
And I thought that I knew all that there was to  
Lonely lonely lonely eyes lonely eyes  
lonely lonely in your place and  
I still love you I still love you  
lonely lonely
