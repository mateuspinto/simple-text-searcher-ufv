The Voice  
  
Follow the footsteps  
Or travel down your own road  
Designing your fate  
Hear what your heart says  
Still you decide which way to go  
Your lifes an open gate  
  
CHORUS  
Le bon et le mal  
These are the voices  
We nous somme liberti  
We make the choices  
  
Echoes of laughter  
Dancing in distant corridors  
With the tears of hearts undone  
Dreams we chase after  
Give us the key to any door  
We are what we become  
  
REPEAT CHORUS  
  
Holding and reaching  
We face the calm we face the fear  
As we learn to win and love  
Voices and speaking  
Still we hear what we want to hear  
Our life is ours to choose  
  
Chorus  
  
  
Good King Wenceslaus  
  
Good King Wenceslaus looked out on the feast of Stephen  
When the snow lay round about deep and crisp and even  
Brightly shone the moon that night though the frost was cruel  
When a poor man came in sight gathering winter fuel  
  
Hither page and stand by me if thou knowst it telling  
Yonder peasant who is he where and what his dwelling  
Sire he lives a good league hence underneath the mountain  
Right against the forest fence by Saint Agnes fountain  
  
Bring me flesh and bring me wine bring me pinelogs hither  
Thou and I will see him dine when we bear them thither  
Page and monarch forth they went forth they went together  
Through the rude winds wild lament and the bitter weather  
  
Sire the night is darker now and the wind blows stronger  
Fails my heart I know not how I can go no longer  
Mark my footsteps my good page tread thou in them boldly  
Thou shalt find the winters rage freeze thy blood less coldly  
  
In his masters steps he trod where the snow lay dinted  
Heat was in the very sod which the saint had printed  
Therefore Christian men be sure wealth or rank possessing  
Ye who now will bless the poor shall yourselves find blessing  
  
  
Hark the Herald Angels Sing  
  
Angels we have heard on high  
Sweetly singing oer the plains  
And the mountains in reply  
Echo back their joyus strains  
  
Gloria O Gloria in excelsis Deo x4  
  
Come to Bethlehem and see  
Gloria O sing Gloria  
Him whose birth the angels sing  
Gloria O sing Gloria  
Come adore on bended knee  
Christ the Lord the newborn king  
  
Gloria O Gloria in excelsis Deo x4  
  
Angels we have heard on high  
Gloria O sing Gloria  
Sweetly singing oer the plains  
Gloria O sing Gloria  
Jesus Lord of heavn and earth  
With us sing our Saviors birth  
  
Gloria O Gloria in exelsis Deo x8  
  
Alleluia
