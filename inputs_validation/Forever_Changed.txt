Train entering the city  I lost myself and never came back  
Took a trip around the world and never came back  
Black silhouettes crisscrossed tracks never came back  
  
Forever changed forever changed  
  
You might think Im frivolous uncaring and cold  
You might think Im frivolous  depends on your point of view  
Society Andy who paints and records them  the high and the low  
I left my old life behind me and never went back  
Forever changed forever changed  
  
Got to get to the city  get a job  
Got to get some work to see me through  
My old lifes disappearing from view  
Hong Kong  and I was changed  
Burma and India  and I was changed  
Only art to see me through  
Only heart to see me through  
My old life disappearing from view  
Brigid and Pat  please see me through  
The whole thing quickly receding  
My life disappearing  disappearing from view  
Forever changed forever changed  
I left my old life behind and was forever changed  
Forever changed
