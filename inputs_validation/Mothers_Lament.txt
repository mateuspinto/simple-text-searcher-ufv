Are we rolling A one a two a three a four  
  
A mother was washing her baby one night  
The youngest of ten and a delicate mite  
The mother was poor and the baby was thin  
Twas naught but a skeleton covered with skin  
  
The mother turned round for a soap off the rack  
She was only a moment but when she turned back  
Her baby had gone and in anguish she cried  
Oh where has my baby gone The angels replied  
  
Oh your baby has gone down the plug hole  
Oh your baby has gone down the plug  
The poor little thing was so skinny and thin  
He should have been washed in a jug in a jug  
  
Your baby is perfectly happy  
He wont need a bath anymore  
Hes amuckin about with the angels above  
Not lost but gone before  
  
Do you want to do it again
