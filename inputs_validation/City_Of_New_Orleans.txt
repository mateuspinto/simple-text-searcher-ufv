Riding on the city of New Orleans  
Illinois central Monday morning rail  
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders  
Three conductors and twentyfive sacks of mail  
All along the southbound odyssey  
The train pulls out at Kankakee  
Rolls along past houses farms and fields  
Passin trains that have no names  
Freight yards full of old black men  
And the graveyards of the rusted automobiles  
  
Chorus  
Good morning America  
How are you  
Dont you know me Im your native son  
Im the train they call the city of New Orleans  
And Ill be gone five hundred miles when the day is done  
  
Dealin card games with the old men in the club car  
Penny a point aint no one keepin score  
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle  
Feel the wheels rumblin neath the floor  
  
And the sons of Pullman Porters  
And the sons of engineers  
Ride their fathers magic carpets made of steel  
Mothers with their babes asleep  
Are rockin to the gentle beat  
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel  
  
Chorus  
  
Nighttime on the city of New Orleans  
Changing cars in Memphis Tennessee  
Half way home well be there by morning  
Through the Mississippi darkness  
Rolling down to the sea  
And all the towns and people seem  
To fade into a bad dream  
And the steel rails still aint heard the news  
The conductor sings his song again  
The passengers will please refrain  
This trains got the disappearing railroad blues  
  
Chorus
