Your poor witness  
Crying so loudly on the floor  
Oh well shes only trying to tell you  
What it was that she saw  
She is only trying to tell you  
What it was that she saw  
  
Now see her standing on the table  
With her small arms flailing  
And you feel such compassion  
In your soul for  
Your mute witness  
Still testing the strength  
Of our patience  
  
Oh well shes only trying to tell you  
What it was that she saw  
She is only trying to tell you  
What it was that she saw  
  
Now see her pointing to the Frisbee  
With a memory so fuzzy  
And her silent words  
Describing the fright of last night  
Four AM Northside Clapham Common  
Oh god what was she doing there  
Will she sketch the answer later  
Well I will ask her  
  
Now dry your tears my dear  
Now see her mime in time so nicely  
It would all have been so clear  
If only she had never volunteered  
Your taxi is here my dear  
  
La la lala
