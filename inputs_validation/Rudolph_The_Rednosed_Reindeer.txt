  
You know Dasher and dancer  
And Prancer and Vixen  
Comet and Cupid  
And Donner and Blitzen  
But do you recall  
The most famous reindeer of all  
  
Rudolph the rednosed reindeer  
Reindeer  
Had a very shiny nose  
Like a light bulb  
And if you ever saw it  
Saw it  
You would even say it glows  
Like a flash light  
All of the other reindeer  
Reindeer  
Used to laugh and call him names  
Like Pinochio  
They never let poor Rudolph  
Rudolph  
Play in any reindeer games  
Like Monopoly  
  
Then one foggy Christmas Eve  
Santa came to say  
Ho Ho Ho  
Rudolph with your nose so bright  
Wont you guide my sleigh tonight  
Then all the reindeer loved him  
Loved him  
And they shouted out with glee  
Yippee  
Rudolph the rednosed reindeer  
Reindeer  
Youll go down in history  
Like george washington
