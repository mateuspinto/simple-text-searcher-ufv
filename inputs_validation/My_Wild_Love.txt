My wild love went ridin  
She rode all the day  
She wrote to the devil  
And asked him to pay  
The devil was wiser  
Its time to repent  
He asked her to give back  
The money she spent  
My wild love went ridin  
She rode to the sea  
She gathered together  
Some shells for her head  
She rode and she rode on  
She rode for a while  
Then stopped for an evenin  
And lay her head down  
She rode on to Christmas  
She rode to the farm  
She rode to Japan  
And we entered a town  
By this time the river  
Had changed one degree  
She asked for the people  
To let her go free  
My wild love is crazy  
She screams like a bird  
She moans like a cat  
When she wants to be heard  
My wild love went ridin  
She rode for an hour  
She rode and she rested  
And then she rode on  
Ride cmon
