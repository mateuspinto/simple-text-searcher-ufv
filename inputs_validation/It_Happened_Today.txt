This is not a parable  
This is a terrible  
This is a terrible thing  
  
Yes I will rhyme that after after all Ive done today  
I have earned my wings  
  
It happened today Hooray Hooray  
It happened Hip hip hooray  
  
Well leave the allegory to another Bible story  
Out of deference defiance and choice  
And close in on a promise after after all Ive done today  
I have earned my voice  
  
It happened today Hooray Hooray  
It happened Hip hip hooray
