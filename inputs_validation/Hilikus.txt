About a hundred years ago now  
Thought I was left for dead  
Soliloquy she was my  
A picture a wake  
My metaphoric friend  
  
So then I fell in love with an irony named life  
It taught me this from that and  
A picture a wake youre gonna be Hilikus  
  
History has a tendency  
To block yout the popular beliefs  
About the leaders of the time  
So glisten with my syllables and  
Ponder the thought  
Maybe they should have  
Had to dedicate more to it go  
Youve got to be  
So good to be  
Youve got to be Hilikus  
  
So I took a walk out side  
With my new found friend and the knowledge imbibe  
I figured Id find another  
With the same attitude  
Yes then maybe I could talk  
To someone other than myself  
  
The doors are swinging wide open  
A positive attitude and the ilk in my pocket  
Had a lot to do with my new found friend  
The Hilikus  
  
History has a tendency  
To block out the popular beliefs  
About the leaders of the time  
So glisten with my syllables and  
Ponder the thought  
Maybe they should have had to dedicate more to it go  
  
Youve got to be  
So good to be  
Youve got to be  
Hilikus
