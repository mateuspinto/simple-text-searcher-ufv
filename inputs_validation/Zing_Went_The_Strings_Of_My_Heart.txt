Never could carry a tune never knew where to start  
You came along when everything was wrong and put a song in my heart  
  
Dear when you smiled at me I heard a melody  
It haunted me from the start  
Something inside of me started a symphony  
Zing Went the strings of my heart  
  
Twas like a breath of spring I heard a robin sing  
About a nest set apart  
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony  
Zing Went the strings of my heart  
  
Chorus  
Your eyes made skies seem blue again  
What else could I do again  
But keep repeating through and through  
I love you love you  
  
I still recall the thrill guess I always will  
I hope twill never depart  
Dear with your lips to mine a rhapsody divine  
Zing Went the strings of my heart  
  
Dear when you smiled at me I heard a melody  
It haunted me from the start  
Something inside of me started a symphony  
Zing Went the strings of my heart  
  
Twas like a breath of spring I heard a robin sing  
About a nest set apart  
All nature seemed to be in perfect harmony  
Zing Went the strings of my heart  
  
Chorus  
  
I still recall the thrill I guess I always will  
I hope twill never depart  
Dear with your lips to mine a rhapsody divine  
Zing Oh Oh Oh went the strings of my heart
