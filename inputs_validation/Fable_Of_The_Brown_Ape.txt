Farmer Emmerich went into his barn  
And found a cow suckling a serpent  
And a brown ape clanking a heavy chain  
Said Farmer Emmerich to the ape  
Never ask me to come into this barn again  
So Long  
Farewell  
So Long  
  
Farmer Emmerich caught the serpent  
And the brown ape in a cage  
And took them into his house  
He fed the snake a vat of milk  
And when the ape rattled its chain  
He tossed the ape a mouse  
So Long  
Goodbye  
Farewell  
  
The villagers found out that Farmer Emmerich  
Was nurturing a serpent  
And descended upon his farm  
All rabid in their blindness  
They dragged the snake outside  
Chopped it open with an axe  
And the ground soaked  
In the milk of human kindness  
So Long  
Farewell  
So Long  
  
But the brown ape escaped  
And was heard to roam the ranges  
Clanking its heavy chain  
Down in the valley it sang to its friend  
Whom he may never see again
