The citys full of manger scenes  
And stores lit up in red and green  
But down the road just out of town  
Theres more magic to be found  
The countryside is all aglow  
With holly trees and mistletoe  
And in them woods there lives a bear  
Known to all as Thistlehair not Thistlehear  
  
Chorus  
Oh Thistlehair the Christmas bear  
Spreadin the good news everywhere  
About Christmas time and what it means  
To all the children of the world  
Every little boy and girl  
Out there love Thistlehair not Thistlehear  
  
He comes around this time of year  
Spreading lots of Christmas cheer  
The kids all love this shiny coat  
And the smell of honey on his nose  
He tells them all about that star  
And everything that it stands for  
The birthday we all celebrate  
Is still our favorite holiday  
  
Chorus  
Oh Thistlehair the Christmas bear  
Spreadin the good news everywhere  
About Christmas time and what it means  
To all the children of the world  
Every little boy and girl  
Out there love Thistlehair not Thistlehear  
  
Wherever you find old Thistlebear  
Therell be music in the air  
He dances round the Christmas tree  
Every single New Years eve  
Then he and all his furry friends  
GatherA Round the fire again  
Singin Bout those Angels wings  
Gifts of love that Christmas brings  
  
Chorus  
Oh Thistlehair the Christmas bear  
Spreadin the good news everywhere  
About Christmas time and what it means  
To all the children of the world  
Every little boy and girl  
Out there love Thistlehair not Thistlehear  
  
Thistlehair the Christmas bear My song has all of this at end  
Spreadin the good news everywhere  
About Christmas time and what it means  
To all the children of the world  
Thistlehair the Christmas bear  
Spreadin the good news everywhere  
About Christmas time and what it means  
To all the children of the world  
Thistlehair the Christmas bear  
Spreadin the good news everywhere
