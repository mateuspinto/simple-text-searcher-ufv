Step into these shoes feel this heart  
Step into these shoes they might fit you  
See through these eyes might be the same view  
If Id lived through the same things as you  
Id share the laughs and cry the tears that you do  
Chorus  
Step into these shoes and feel this heart  
Step into these shoes no reason to fight  
Look into m mind it might fit you  
Act out this part is it so different to you  
Even if we dont ever agree  
The only difference is cosmetically  
Step into these shoes no reason to fight  
Step in step into these shoes and feel this heart  
Just feel my heart it beats with you  
We float downstream in the same canoe  
You might find the ocean faster than me  
But Ill see it eventually  
Step into these shoes and feel this heart  
Step into these shoes no reason to fight  
Step into these shoes and feel this heart  
Oh feel this heart please feel it  
Step into these shoes and feel this heart oh feel  
This heart please feel it  
Step into these shoes and feel this heart  
Step in step into these shoes no reason to fight  
Step in step into these shoes and feel this heart  
Step in step into these shoes no reason to fight anymore  
Feel this heart oh feel it  
Step in step into these shoes no reason to fight
