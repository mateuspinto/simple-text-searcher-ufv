No phone No phone I just want to be alone today  
No phone no phone  
Ringing stinging  
  
Jerking like a nervous bird  
Rattling up against his cage  
Calls to me throughout the day  
See the feathers fly  
  
No phone No phone I just want to be alone today  
No phone No phone  
No phone no phone I just want to be alone today  
  
Rhyming chiming got me working all the time  
Gives me such a worried mind  
Now I dont want to seem unkind  
But god its such a crime  
  
No phone No phone I just want to be alone today  
No phone no phone  
No phone No phone I just want to be alone today  
No phone no phone  
  
Shaking quaking  
Waking me when Im asleep  
Never lets me go too deep  
Summons me with just one beep  
The price we pay is steep  
Ive been on fire  
And yet Ive still stayed frozen  
So deep in the night  
My smooth contemplations will always be broken  
My deepest concerns will stay buried and unspoken  
  
No I dont have any change but heres a few subway tokens  
No phone No phone I just want to be alone today  
No phone No phone  
No phone no phone I just want to be alone today  
No phone no phone  
No phone No phone I just want to be alone today  
No phone No phone
