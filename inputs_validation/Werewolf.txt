I could liken you to a werewolf  
The way you left me for dead  
But I admit that I provided a full moon  
  
And I could liken you to a shark  
The way you bit off my head  
But then again I was waving around a bleeding open wound  
  
But you were such a super guy  
Til the second you get away from me  
Were like a wishing well  
And a bolt of electricity  
But we could still support each other  
All we gotta do is avoid each other  
Nothing wrong when a song ends in the minor key  
Nothing wrong when a song ends in the minor key  
  
The lava of a volcano  
Shot up hot from under the sea  
One thing leads to another  
And you made an island of me  
  
And I could liken you to a chemical  
The way you made me compound to compound  
But Im a chemical too  
Inevitable you and me would mix  
  
And I could liken you to a lot of things  
But I always come around  
Cause in the end Im a sensible girl  
I know the fiction of the fix  
  
But you were such a super guy  
Til the second you get away from me  
Were like a wishing well  
And a bolt of electricity  
But we could still support each other  
All we gotta do is avoid each other  
Nothing wrong when a song ends in the minor key  
Nothing wrong when a song ends in the minor key
