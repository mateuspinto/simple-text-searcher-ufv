Im really glad that you called me  
Im unhappy you found someone new  
Ive been looking myself and if Id find someone else  
First so Im telling is you  
  
Were better off to have known love  
Were more than we might have been  
How many can say they went all the way  
From strangers to lovers to friends  
  
Things could have turned out much different  
We could have been strangers again  
We were lucky to learn watched the bridge has been burned  
Only fools try to cross it again  
  
Oh I know that Im going to miss you  
And although Im hurt now and then  
Ill never regret what we went through to get  
From strangers to lovers to friends  
  
Im not one that sorry I loved you  
Or not do it all over again  
I remember we cried when we walked side by side  
From strangers to lovers to friends
