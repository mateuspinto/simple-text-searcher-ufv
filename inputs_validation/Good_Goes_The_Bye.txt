They say Rome wasnt built in a day  
But you and I went and built it anyway  
And it only took a second to watch it all fall to dust  
I thought you hung up the moon  
And you thought I lit up the room  
But the lights turned off and it was the end of us  
  
Chorus  
Slam goes the door  
Hush goes the phone  
Out goes the flame  
And Im standing here alone  
Burn goes the drink  
Down go the tears  
Drip goes the sink  
And Im missing you like hell  
Break goes the heart  
Wrong goes the right  
Good goes the bye  
  
Its like we pulled the pin out of a grenade  
It just didnt go off right away  
But man did it go off when it finally did  
Everythings suddenly magnified  
Its loud and its quiet at the same time  
As the echo of its all over sets in  
  
Chorus  
Slam goes the door  
Hush goes the phone  
Out goes the flame  
And Im standing here alone  
Burn goes the drink  
Down go the tears  
Drip goes the sink  
And Im missing you like hell  
Break goes the heart  
Wrong goes the right  
Good goes the bye  
  
I cant go back we cant be friends  
And we cant be what we were then  
You cant be mine and I cant be yours  
And its not love anymore  
  
Chorus  
Slam goes the door  
Hush goes the phone  
Out goes the flame  
And Im standing here alone  
Burn goes the drink  
Down go the tears  
Drip goes the sink  
And Im missing you like hell  
Break goes the heart  
Wrong goes the right  
Good goes the bye
