Oh Loretta shes a barroom girl  
Wears them sevens on her sleeve  
Dances like a diamond shines  
Tell me lies I love to believe  
Her age is always 22  
Her laughing eyes a hazel hue  
Spends my money like water falls  
Loves me like I want her to  
  
Oh Loretta wont you say to me  
Darling put your guitar on  
Have a little shot of booze  
Play a blue a and wailing song  
My guitar rings a melody  
My guitar sings Lorettas fine  
Long and lazy blonde and free  
And I can have her any time  
  
Sweetest at the break of day  
Prettiest in the setting sun  
She dont cry when I cant stay  
Least not til shes all alone  
Loretta I wont be gone long  
Keep your dancing slippers on  
Keep me on your mind a while  
Ill be back babe to make you smile
