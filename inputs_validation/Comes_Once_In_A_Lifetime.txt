Every day just go along dawn till sundown  
Heres a rundown  
Every day that comes comes once in a lifetime  
  
Take each day and gather the rosebuds in it  
Fill each minute  
Every day that comes comes once in a lifetime  
  
Think of now tomorrow is waiting in the wings  
Who knows what it brings  
While the future waits the present swings  
  
Day to day in Brooklyn or China cross the bay  
Only once comes this particular sky  
Only once these precious hours go by  
Only once in a lifetime the day comes by  
So live live live live today  
  
Think of now tomorrow is waiting in the wings  
Who knows what it brings  
While the future waits the present swings  
  
From day to day in Brooklyn or China cross the bay  
Only once comes this particular sky  
Only once these precious hours go by  
Only once in a lifetime a day comes by  
So live live live come on and live today
