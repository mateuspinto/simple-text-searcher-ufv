James Dean James Dean I know just what you mean  
James Dean you said it all so clean  
And I know my life would look alright  
If I could see it on the silver screen  
  
You were the low down rebel if there ever was  
Even if you had no cause  
James dean you said it all so clean  
And I know my life would look alright  
If I could see it on the silver screen  
  
Well talk about a lowdown bad refrigerator  
You were just too cool for school  
Sock hop soda pop basketball and auto shop  
The only thing that got you off was breakin all the rules  
  
James Dean James Dean so hungry and so lean  
James Dean you said it all so clean  
And I know my life would look alright  
If I could see it on the silver screen  
  
Little James Dean up on the screen  
Wonderin who he might be  
Along came a spyder picked up a rider  
Took him down the road to eternity  
  
James Dean James Dean you bought it sight unseen  
James Dean James Dean you bought it sight unseen  
You were too fast to live too young to die bye bye  
You were too fast to live too young to die bye bye  
Bye bye too fast to live too young to die  
Bye bye too fast to live too young to die  
Bye bye too fast to live too young to die  
Bye bye too fast to live too young to die  
Too fast to live too young to die  
Oooooooo too fast to live too young to die  
Bye bye too fast to live too young to die  
Oh James Dean too fast to live too young to die
