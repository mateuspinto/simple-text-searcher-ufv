Lord I hear of showers of blessings  
Thou art scattering full and free  
Showers the thirsty souls refreshing  
Let some drops now fall on me  
  
Pass me not oh gentle saviour  
Sinful though my heart may be  
I am longing for your favor  
Whilst thou art blessing  
Oh lord  
Come on and bless me  
  
Even me lord  
Even me  
Even me lord  
Even me  
  
Let some drops  
Let some drops  
Whilst thou art blessing  
Oh lord  
Stop by and bless me  
  
Oh stop by lord  
Yes and bless me  
  
Bless me  
Protect me  
Direct me  
Even me lord  
  
I need you  
To come on down  
And bless me  
Sinful though my heart may be  
I need you to come down  
And bless me  
Yes  
  
While  
Whilst thou art blessing  
While you are in the blessing business today  
Not tomorrow  
I need you today  
Yeah  
  
Bless me  
Protect me  
Direct me  
Even me lord  
  
To stop by  
Just drop by  
Oh lord lord lord lord lord lord lord  
Bless me  
Even me  
Even me lord  
Yeah  
I need a blessing  
I need a blessing  
I need a blessing lord
