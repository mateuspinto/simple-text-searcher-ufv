Can you imagine  
I mean can you imagine  
Do you believe it  
I mean do you believe it  
  
I know a girl  
A girl who lands on top  
You could put her face  
Into a pail of slop  
And shed come up smelling like a rose  
How she does it heaven knows  
  
Reporter

Roxie enters followed by a very happy Doctor  
Well Doctor is she or isnt she  
  
Velma

Velma  
I know a girl  
A girl with so much luck  
She could get run over by a twoton truck  
Then brush herself off and walk away  
How she does it I couldnt say  
  
Billy  
So Doc would you swear to that statement in court  
  
Doctor  
Oh yeah  
  
Billy  
Good You wanna button your fly  
  
Velma  
Whilst I on the other hand  
Put my face in a pail of slop  
And I would smell like a pail of slop  
I on the other hand  
Get run over by a truck  
And I am deader than a duck  
  
I know a girl who tells so many lies  
Anything thats true would truly cross her eyes  
But what that mouse is selling  
That whole world buys  
And nobody smells a rat  
  
Roxie

Of us alone so that we can rest
