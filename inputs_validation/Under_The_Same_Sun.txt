I saw the morning  
It was shattered by a gun  
Heard a scream saw him fall no one cried  
I saw a mother  
She was praying for her son  
Bring him back let him live dont let him die  
  
Do you ever ask yourself  
Is there a Heaven in the sky  
Why cant we get it right  
  
Cause we all live under the same sun  
We all walk under the same moon  
Then why why cant we live as one  
  
I saw the evening  
Fading shadows one by one  
We watch the lamb lay down to the sacrifice  
I saw the children  
The children of the sun  
How they wept how they bled how they died  
  
Do you ever ask yourself  
Is there a Heaven in the sky  
Why cant we stop the fight  
  
Cause we all live under the same sun  
We all walk under the same moon  
Then why why cant we live as one  
  
Sometimes I think Im going mad  
Were loosing all we had and no one seems to care  
But in my heart it doesnt change  
Weve got to rearrange and bring our world some love  
  
And does it really matter  
If theres a heaven up above  
We sure could use some love  
  
Cause we all live under the same sun  
We all walk under the same moon  
Then why why cant we live as one  
Cause we all live under the same sky  
We all look up at the same stars  
Then why tell me why cant we live as one
