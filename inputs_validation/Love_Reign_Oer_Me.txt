Petes theme Only love  
Can make it rain  
The way the beach is kissed by the sea  
Only love  
Can make it rain  
Like the sweat of lovers  
Laying in the fields  
  
Love reign oer me  
Love reign oer me rain on me  
  
Only love  
Can bring the rain  
That makes you yearn to the sky  
Only love  
Can bring the rain  
That falls like tears from on high  
  
Love Reign Oer me  
  
On the dry and dusty road  
The nights we spend apart alone  
I need to get back home to cool cool rain  
The nights are hot and black as ink  
I cant sleep and I lay and I think  
Oh God I need a drink of cool cool rain
