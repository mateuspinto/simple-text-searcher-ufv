I met a girl named Tara  
She lived in the heart of america  
She liked black caddies  
Listened to puff daddy  
Danced until her legs were sore  
  
She worked around the corner  
At the diner with the grouchy owner  
And her boyfriends shady dates another girl named katie  
He loves her definately maybe  
  
Dont think I can take it  
Wake me when its over  
So far away  
I wish that it was closer  
I see you every day  
Im too scared to go over  
I wonder what shed say  
I barely even know her  
  
Chorus  
And how much longer  
Will this keep getting stronger  
I wonder what shes doing when Im singing myself to sleep  
Cause hes a faker  
So see ya later  
I wonder when you realize that she means a lot more to me  
  
I saw you in the hallway when my last class was just over  
It was friday school was out tonight  
Everything seems to be allright  
I said yo are you going to the party at the cove  
Hes picking me up six again and I dont wanna disappoint my boyfriend  
  
And shes staring at his picture hanging in her locker  
Shes telling all the girls about all the things that he bought her  
I saw what really happened all those times he went for water  
When we were at the movie theatre watching harry potter  
He had his hands on  
Every single girl he laid his eyes on  
Hate to break it to you hes a pylon  
And even when he kissed her  
He was looking over staring at her sister
