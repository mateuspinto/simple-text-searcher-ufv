Guilty until proven innocent  
We condemn your soul and fate  
Never mind the possibilities  
Too busy for logic or to calculate  
  
Take part in a diminishing breed  
Where complex turns to simplicity  
When pain is acknowledged  
Frivolous calculations will be abolished  
  
Without judgement what would we do  
We would be forced to look  
At ourselves emerged in lost time  
Assuming what may be without judgement  
Perception would increase a million times  
  
Distracted by imagination  
That experiments with ease if you could  
Taste it it might be addictive  
Where life will crush those who defy  
  
Take part in a diminishing breed  
Where complex turns to simplicity  
When pain is acknowledged  
Frivolous calculations will be abolished  
  
Without judgement what would we do  
We would be forced to look  
At ourselves emerged in lost time  
Assuming what may be without judgement  
Perception would increase a million times
