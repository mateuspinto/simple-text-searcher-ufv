Ah ah ah ah  
  
Some live for the bill  
Some kill for the bill  
She wined for the bill  
Grind for the bill  
And she used to be the sweetest girl  
Some steal for the bill if they got to pay they bill  
And she used to be the sweetest girl  
Tonight Wyclef Akon Weezy on the bill  
  
High school she was that girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym  
Just to get a peek again shes a 10  
High school she was  
That girl that make me do the hula hoop around the gym  
Just to get a peek again shes a 10  
Never thought she would come and work for the president  
Mr George Washington where my money at  
She thought hed call where my money at  
She had a good day bad day sunny day rainy day  
All she wanna know is where my money at  
Closed legs dont get fed go out there and make my bread  
All you wanna know is where my money at  
She ended up in a road car bruised up scarred hard  
All you wanna know is where my money at  
She thought hed call where my money at  
  
Chorus  
Cause Im a tell you like you told me  
Cash rules everything around me  
Singin dollar dollar bill yall dollar dollar bill yall  
Singin dollar dollar bill yall dollar dollar bill yall  
Causes Im a tell you like you told me  
Cash rules everything around me  
Singin dollar dollar bill yall dollar dollar bill yall  
Singin dollar dollar bill yall dollar dollar bill yall  
  
Pimpin got harder cos hoes got smarter  
On the strip is something they dont wanna be a part of  
Rather be up in the club shakin for a thug  
For triple times the money and spending it how they wanna  
They got they mind on they money money on they mind  
They got they finger on the trigger hand on the nines  
See everyday they feel the struggle but staying on they grind  
And aint nobody takin from us and thats the bottom line  
But I know theres a draught in the block  
You move slow  
You getting pressure from cops  
you dont know not to lay low  
Because 25 to life is no joke  
To all my real gorillas thuggin  
On top of corners every day strugglin  
All the beautiful women getting money  
Washin them dollar bills like laundry  
  
Chorus  
  
Money moneymoneymoney  
Money moneymoneymoney  
It drives the world crazy  
  
She used to be  
  
She used to be the sweetest girl  
She used to be the sweetest girl ever  
Now she like sour Amaretto  
She wears a dress to the T like the letter  
And if you make it rain she will be under the weather  
She used to run track back in high school  
Now she tricks on the track right by school  
She takes a loss cause she dont wanna see her child lose  
So respect her Ill pay up for the time used  
And then she runs to the pastor  
And he tells her there will be a new chapter  
But she feels no different after  
And then she asks him  
Where my money at  
  
Chorus  
  
Some live for the bill  
Some kill for the bill  
Yeah where my money at  
She wined for the bill  
Grind for the bill  
Whoa where my money at  
Some steal for the bill if they got to pay the bill  
Yeah where my money at  
Tonight Wyclef Akon Weezy on the bill  
Whoa Where my money at
