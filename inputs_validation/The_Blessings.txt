I satnd here lookin up at the starts tonight how can one man have so much in  
Life  
As I look around me what a picture it paints Im much more than lucky I  
Oughta give my thanks  
Theres food on the table a log on the fire and in my womans eyes theres  
Love and desire  
  
The blessings sent from above oh the blessings a life full of love  
When I look around I can see all thats been given me so I lift my eyes up  
To the sky  
I want to give my my my my my thanks for the blessings  
  
Sometimes I fall asleep at the end of the day and I forget to thank you Im  
Ashamed to say  
But as I lay m down to sleep I pray the lord my soul to keep  
I know you can hear me here on earth thank you for giving me more than I  
Deserve  
  
The blessings sent from above oh the blessings a life full of love  
When I look around I can see all thats been given me so ilift my eyes up  
To the sky  
cause I want to give my my my my my thanks for the blessings

So I lift my eyes up to the sky cause I want to give my my my my my  
Thanks for the blessings  
The blessings oh the blessings
