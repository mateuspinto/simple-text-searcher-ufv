Hook  
My raps is better than yours  
My plaques is better than yours  
My tracks is better than yours  
You can have one but I have to charge  
We can start with the hits on my arm I already got the bomb  
Now all I need is my first LP to go gold  
Then I will have the qualm IIIIm  
Im Kan the Louis Vuitton Don  
Bought my mom a purse now she Louis Vuitton Mom  
Still might throw on a little low arm they want me to stop go on go on  
They dont want me to shop and me spending that hard  
Oh my God is that a black card  
I turned around and replied why yes  
But I prefer the term AfricanAmerican Express  
Hook  
La La La La La Off MTV  
La La La La La When you gonna go out with Me  
Brains power and muscle like Dame Puffy and Russell  
Your boy back on his hustle dont know you dont discuss you  
Every rapper want to know when they can get to work  
Every stylist want to know where they can get the shirts  
Everybody ripping my style like the shit that hurts  
But they dont give me my credit thats the shit that hurts  
Theres something I might say Theres something I might play  
A beat I might make might make they life change  
And save their whole deal Their wrist is on chill  
They house is on hill You could be Lauren Hill  
See yall write songs to keep the lights on  
Ima go in Def Jam and turn the brights on  
Man Im just sayin  
When I wanted to rap yall thought I was just playin  
Now you just prayin  
Hook  
Common  
You was a vic in high school now you a thug  
Better step in the name of love  
Before you giving pain a hug  
Needing dope is like pain to drugs  
Or aiming slugs til the game unplugged  
Like a scoreboard with vice and warlords  
Hot merchandise prices they want more for it  
You was pink as ice single need to think it twice  
Over the bitch and you came out like freaks in the night  
Freed your mind at a cheaper price on the street trying to seek advice  
Im on point like I speak to dice  
Took the underground at a steeper heights  
May real niggaz see the light got fat girls eating right
