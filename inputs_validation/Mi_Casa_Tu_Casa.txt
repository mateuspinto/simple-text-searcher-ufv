Verse  
  
Mi casa su casa partna  
Mi casa so full of rahstas  
More ganja then reefer farmers  
You can see me with binoculars  
White girl wit me cindy lauper  
Multi deep like frank sanotra  
Gave 10 birds to waka flocka  
Told him drop em more den floza  
Whoozy like the morning after try me then yo skull get fractured  
Ransom yo lil hansom son  
So sad yo that first daughter captured  
Gucci hot as boiling water  
My pack just came cross the border  
Yo girlfriends a major snoter  
But dat bitch aint worth a quarter  
Dont give that anotha thoughta  
If you serve me and you shorta  
Once a half a eigth a quarter  
Send my goons to do the slaughter  
Hustle hard got from my father  
Take no shit got from my mother  
Never snitched and never will  
I put dat on my baby brother  
  
Chorus  
  
Coca coca coca cola  
yayo bought me everythang  
Yulla yulla baking soda cocaine is my girlfriend boila boila boilin
water damn I gotta forced game snorta snorta make an offer  
no prob I could cook it for ya  
Mi casa su casa partna  
my partnas get stupid guallas  
Retail shops and beauty parlors to

Mi casa su casa partna

Retail shops and beauty parlors
