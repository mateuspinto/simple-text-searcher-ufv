Werent you the pilot  
Who fell from the skies  
Was it a big mistake  
Or just plain homicide  
How does it feel on the other side  
Do you hang out with the  
Saints or the spies  
  
Are you still hellraising  
Are you still hellraising  
Hellraising  
  
Is this the kind of thing we always fear  
Are you so bent on hell youd leave  
Me up here without you  
God bless the miles we traveled too fast  
God help the suckers  
Dead in your path  
  
Are you still hellraising  
Are you still hellraising  
Hellraising  
  
You will pay for your mistakes  
You will pay for your mistakes  
You will pay for your mistakes  
You will pay  
  
This love was born on crutches crippled and bored  
Ripped out asleep and strangled by a phone cord  
Werent you the pilot who swerved off the course  
Was it disaster or just plain divorce  
  
Hellraising  
Hellraising  
Are you still hellraising  
Hellraising  
  
Hell  
Hellraising  
Hellraising  
Hellraising  
Hellraising  
  
Hell  
Hell  
Hell raising  
Hellraising  
Hellraising
