When your a white boy  
Life gets you high  
You hold out thinking  
  
And you know why  
You hold out  
With the law of men  
And when you die  
Your born again  
Put down your gun  
And find your heart  
Were dying soldiers  
We dont dance for the devil  
When your a white boy  
Your life is lust  
You kiss and run  
  
And you mistrust  
You hold out  
With the nowhere men  
You dance your dance  
And try again  
Put down your gun  
And find your heart  
Were dying soldiers  
  
In the dark we are no rebels  
You know white boys cant control it  
You know white boys never hold it  
You know white boys hard to swallow  
You know white boys always follow  
follow who  
  
Put down your gun  
And find your heart  
Were dying soldiers  
We dont dance for the devil
