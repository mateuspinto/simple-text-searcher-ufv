Atlanta was on fire and so was she the night he left her  
Left her there to bear her pain alone hoping soon to return  
Burn Georgia burn  
The roaring of th guns filled the emptiness inside her where once she felt  
the pounding of her heart  
When he held her in his arms tenderness they learned  
Burn Georgia burn  
He was the body she was the soul of a love affair the couldnt control  
While the world was falling down around them they were not concerned  
Burn Georgia burn  
Winter brought the snow and a rider down from Franklin with news of how the  
war had taken toll and he would not return  
Burn Georgia burn  
He was the body she was the soul of a love affair they couldnt control  
While her world crumbled all around her she was not concerned  
Burn Georgia burn  
While strolling through her mind she stumbled on an old familiar feeling of  
how he touched her many years ago and how he made her yearn  
Burn Georgia burn
