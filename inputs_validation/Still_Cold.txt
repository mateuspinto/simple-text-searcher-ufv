You really had a million hearts to break  
Now its time that I never left you in the moonlight  
How comes always someone else driving your car  
Taking you different places in the sunlight  
  
Still cold like the stars  
Thats just the way you are  
Still cold like the stars  
  
You used to say your heart felt like a stone  
Now everything you ever wanted is your own  
  
Still cold like the stars  
Thats just the way you are  
Still cold like the stars
