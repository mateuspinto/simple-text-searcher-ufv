I need a new way to express  
Myself so you dont need to guess  
What otherwise Id say aloud  
And watch it float just like a cloud  
  
High up above you like a thunderhead  
But you would just look down instead  
And wait til foggy skies abate  
And water clouds all dissipate  
  
And when with them all my words for you  
Have softly sublimated too  
And youll just hope that Ive moved on  
So youll look up and find me gone
