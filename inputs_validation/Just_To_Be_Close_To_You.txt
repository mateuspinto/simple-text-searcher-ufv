This is for the lovers  
Strictly for the lovers year  
If you want some one you want to get close to  
Then you get close to this  
  
Woo just to be close to ya  
  
Yo drop the verse  
  
Like a flower to a tree that how close I want to be  
To your heart baby to your heart heart  
Like the stars to the night and daytime is to light  
Will never part will never part  
I want you to be the only thing that I see  
cause I believe its our destiny  
  
Chorus  
Just to be close just to be close  
Its the only thing that I want to do  
Just to be close just to be close  
Just to be close to ya closer to ya  
Just to be close  
  
So lonely is the night without you to hold me tight  
I want to hold ya closer  
I need ya baby hold me closer closer  
My life will mean nothing without the joy you bring  
To me you know you know you know  
There were never never be no one else for me  
You were like the dream that become reality
