Spasm waiter dropping to his knees sees  
Slander on wrap paper ties  
Lifting up his head he feels the sunlight in his eyes  
  
Grasp a kettle top and shoot the breeze please  
Ramble while slop scraper sighs  
Tossing in his bed at night hell dream until he dies  
  
Operations at the sink  
The dribble liquid visible beneath his troubled eyes  
Feels it tilt and start to slide  
  
Mask a pretty hoppers foot with squeeze cheese  
Dangle some grape apple pies  
Tranquil and serene until he runs out of supplies  
  
Your hands and feet are mangoes  
Youre gonna be a genius anyway  
  
Your hands and feet are mangoes  
Youre gonna be a genius anyway
