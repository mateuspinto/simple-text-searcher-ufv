Everyones feeling pretty  
Its hotter than July  
Though the worlds full of problems  
They couldnt touch us even if they tried  
From the park I hear the rhythms  
  
Marleys hot on the box  
Tonight there will be a party  
On the corner at the end of the block  
  
Didnt know you would be jammin  
Until the break of dawn  
I bet you nobody ever told you  
That you would be jammin until the  
Break of dawn  
You would be jammin an jammin and  
Jammin  
Jam on  
  
They want us to join their fighting  
But our answer today  
Is to let all our worries  
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away  
Peace has come to Zimbabwe  
Third worlds right on the one  
Nows the time for celebration  
Cause weve only just begun  
  
Didnt know you would be jammin  
Until the break of dawn  
Bet you nobody ever told you that you  
Were in the middle of the makins  
Of the master blaster jammin  
Would be jammin until the break  
Of Dawn  
I know nobody told you that you  
Were in the middle of the makins  
Of the master blaster jammin  
Would be jammin until the break  
Of dawn  
Were jammin  
Jammin  
Jam on  
  
You ask me am I happy  
Well as a matter of fact  
I can say that Im ecstatic  
Cause we all just made a pact  
Weve agreed to get together  
Joined as children in Jah  
  
When youre moving in the positive  
Your destination is the brightest star  
  
You didnt know that you  
Were in the middle of the makins of  
The master blaster jammin  
Would be jammin until the break  
Of dawn  
I bet you nobody ever told you  
That you  
Were in the middle of the makins of  
The master blaster jammin  
Would be jammin until the break  
Of dawn  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
You  
Were in the middle of the makins of  
The master blaster jammin  
Would be jammin  
Until the brak of dawn  
Dont you stop the music  
Oh no  
  
Were in the middle of the makins of  
The master blaster jammin  
Repeat background  
  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
You  
Were in the middle of the makins of  
The master blaster jammin  
Would be jammin until the break  
Of dawn  
I bet you if someone approached you  
Yesterday to tell you that you would be  
Jammin you would not believe it  
Because you never thought that you  
Would be jammin  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
  
 Were in the middle of the makins of  
The master blaster jammin  
Jammin til the break of dawn  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
You may as well believe what  
You are feeling because you feel your  
Body jammin  
Oh  
Oh  
You would be jammin until the  
Break of dawn  
Were in the middle of the makins of the  
Master blaster jammin
