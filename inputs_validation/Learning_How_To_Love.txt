Creeping through your bedroom door  
Just after all the lights go out  
Feeling the warmth of your body  
And the sweetness of your mouth  
Set the alarm again for 5 am  
Uneasy sleep will soon be following  
Creeping back to my own bed again  
I will see you in our uneasy morning  
Chorus  
Learning how to love  
Learning how to love  
Learning how to love  
Learn how to love  
Sitting down at breakfast time  
A silence always fills the air  
Many things that should be said  
Are ending in a vacant stare  
And they know just what is going on  
But make us feel like we are criminals  
Our only wish is learning how to love  
Just a small word would make us feel its natural  
Set the alarm again for 5 am  
Uneasy sleep will soon be following  
Creeping back to my own bed again  
I will see you in our uneasy morning
