Lets get the show on the road  
At the curtain take a bow  
New Haven just a rendezvous to take you to  
A lover who was then but never now  
  
And Susan paid the lady  
Who called the players song  
Just a figurine of stagehand reveries  
I guess upandcoming cant be that wrong  
  
Lets get the show on the road babe  
The spotlights on the stage  
Somehow it seems that I heard these words before  
Did you forget to turn the page  
  
Just remember what they told you  
About how the show goes on  
How can you come back if youve never been away  
How can you sing without a song  
  
And today is for sale and its all you can afford  
Buy your own admission  
The whole things got you bored  
Well the Lord chooses the good ones  
And the bad ones use the Lord  
  
Lets get the show on the road babe  
Wont you take a look a round  
It seems so easy climbing to the top  
You better know the way back down  
  
I cant believe you really stumbled  
But I always knew youd fall  
It seems so easy to say I knew you when  
Id rather it was not at all  
  
And today is for sale and its all you can afford  
Buy your own admission  
The whole things got you bored  
Well the Lord chooses the good ones  
And the bad ones use the Lord
