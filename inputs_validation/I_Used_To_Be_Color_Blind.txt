Strange  
How a dreary world can suddenly change  
To a world as bright as the evening star  
Queer  
What a difference when your vision is clear  
And you see things as they really are  
  
I used to be colorblind  
But I met you and now I find  
Theres green in the grass  
Theres gold in the moon  
Theres blue in the skies  
  
That semicircle that was always hanging about  
Is not a storm cloud its a rainbow  
And you brought the colors out  
  
Believe me its really true  
Till I met you I never knew  
A setting sun could paint such beautiful skies  
  
I never knew there were such lovely colors  
And the big surprise  
Is the red in your cheeks  
The gold in your hair  
The blue in your eyes
