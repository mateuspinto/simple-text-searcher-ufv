She should have seen the thing in mothers belly  
Grew up along side her sister of ethnical  
She reached up for nourishment and fall from her mothers umbilical cord  
With her sister in the womb  
  
One day she opened her mouth wide and swallowed wide her surroundings  
The red and orange and the sounds all around her  
Now she was in her corner  
Now she was in her corner  
Her eyes closed with some kind of complete  
Happiness  
Some kind of complete  
Happiness  
  
Now she can walk in the sunlight with a quiet of relief inside her  
Now she walks in the sunlight  
An extra feeling inside her soul makes her cry  
  
In her mothers belly her mouth opens wide her sister  
One day she opens her mouth wide and swallows her surroundings  
The red and orange and the sounds all around her  
In the sunlight makes it go away  
Now she was in her corner  
In the sunlight  
Now she was in her corner she listens  
Her eyes closed with some kind of complete  
Happiness  
Some kind of complete  
Happiness  
  
And now she walks in the sunlight  
With the extra feeling inside her  
Now she walks in the sunlight  
With the extra feeling inside her  
Inside her
