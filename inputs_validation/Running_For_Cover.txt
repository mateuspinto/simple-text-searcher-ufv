Spent the best of my life running scared  
In the city  
Left my shoes and my clothes and  
My lovers behind yeah  
Oh but I felt incomplete  
Living out there in the street  
I was always alone and afraid  
Such a pity  
Little girls just dont know what comes  
Out after dark  
But the devil wasnt in here  
Down on that dead end street  
And I say  
Running for cover  
Running for cover  
Running for cover  
Its take keeping me running  
Im just scared that hes out tonight  
Its keeping me running  
I dont know why but its getting dark  
Say the devils in the park  
And its already after dark  
Running for cover  
Running for cover  
Running for cover now  
Life is really so hard when you live in the city  
No one know what a young girl  
Has on her mind yeah  
But youre headed for defect  
Down on that dead end street  
Never learned of the lesson  
You should such a pity  
Still and all youll stay away  
The others behind  
And the promise in the dark  
Is that the devils in the park  
And I say  
Running for cover  
Running for cover  
Running for cover  
Its take keeping me running  
Im just scared that hes out tonight  
Its keeping me running  
I dont know why but its getting dark  
Say the devils in the park  
And its already after dark  
running for cover  
Running for cover  
Running for cover  
Spent the best of my life running scared  
In the city  
Left my shoes and my clothes and  
My lovers behind yeah  
Oh but I felt incomplete  
Living out there in the street  
running for cover  
Running for cover  
Running for cover  
Its take keeping me running  
Im just scared that hes out tonight  
Its keeping me running  
I dont know why but its getting dark  
Say the devils in the park  
And its already after dark
