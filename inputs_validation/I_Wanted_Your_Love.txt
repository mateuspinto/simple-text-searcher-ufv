All of the band was on time for rehearsal  
And played everything just right  
Then came the news telling me not to worry  
The show is selling out tonight  
Well the lights went on and suddenly the crowd began to scream  
And as you could well imagine it was like living a dream  
Oh but when the lights went down and the standing O was done  
I was just another lonely guy who didnt have no one  
  
I wanted your love  
Your love your love love love love love  
  
So busy daydreaming bout you baby  
I didnt even hear the phone  
Then when my friends rang the doorbell it scared me  
They said were so glad youre home  
You just won a million dollars and a trip around the world  
Better get yourself and forget about that girl  
They thought I was acting crazy not to get excited too  
But all the money in the world could never take the place of you  
  
All over the city the lights were so pretty  
The holiday was filled with cheer  
The stars really glistened and lovers were kissin  
It was the special part of the year  
So what a perfect time it was to find someone to say I do  
Thought that I could still be happy even though she wasnt you  
We had told the world we were going to ring the wedding bell  
But when I really thought about it I was really lying to myself
