I saw three ships come sailing in  
On Christmas Day on Christmas Day  
I saw three ships come sailing in  
On Christmas Day in the morning  
And what was in those ships all three  
On Christmas Day on Christmas Day  
And what was in those ships all three  
On Christmas Day in the morning  
The Virgin Mary and Christ were there  
On Christmas Day on Christmas Day  
The virgin Mary and Christ were there  
On Christmas Day in the morning
