sambora  
  
Woke up in a cold sweat  
In the middle of the night  
Seems like a lifetime  
When youre wondering whos wrong or right  
One confession would resurrect the truth  
Revenge or forgiveness for sins between me and you  
  
Now we dance with the devil down lonely  
Street lonely street  
  
Looking for a window in the house of tears  
Living in hell I pray the rain disappears  
Im headed for a breakdown  
And the fever runs higher  
As I kneel at the altar I can feel your fire  
In the church of desire  
Church of desire  
  
You never find a reason why love falls from grace  
Some kind of voodoo like a spirit you cant embrace  
Theres a voice in the mirror and a ghost in my heart  
That relives the passion before we were torn apart  
  
Now we dance with the devil down lonely  
Street lonely street  
  
Looking for a window in the house of tears  
Living in hell I pray the rain disappears  
Im headed for a breakdown  
And the fever runs higher  
As I kneel at the altar I can feel your fire  
In the church of desire  
Church of desire  
  
Now we dance with the devil down lonely  
Street lonely street  
  
Looking for a window in the house of tears  
Living in hell I pray the rain disappears  
Im headed for a breakdown  
And the fever runs higher  
As I kneel at the altar I can feel your fire  
In the church of desire  
Church of desire
