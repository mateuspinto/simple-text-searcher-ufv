Lay your head down  
And sleep on my shoulder  
Lay your head down  
And start a new dream  
  
And for tonight the moment is over  
Drift in a lullaby  
Here where the stars reside  
And angels are always seen  
  
Lay your head down  
The stars they have whispered  
Hear what they say  
And know that it means  
  
The moon is your guide  
The stars they have kissed her  
As she goes gently by  
Light as a babys eye  
Safe on a fairytale stream  
  
And start a new dream
