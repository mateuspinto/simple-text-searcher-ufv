They lived in peace not long ago  
A mighty Indian tribe  
But the winds of change  
Made them realize that the promises were lies  
  
The white mans greed in search of gold  
Made the nation bleed  
They lost their faith  
And now they had to learn  
There was no place to return  
Nowhere they could turn  
  
Cherokee  marching on the trail of tears  
  
They were driven hard across the plains  
And walked for many moons  
Cause the winds of change  
Had made them realize that the promises were lies  
  
So much to bear all that pain  
Left them in despair  
They lost their faith  
And now they had to learn  
There was no place to return  
Nowhere they could turn
