Gambling on instincts well heres what I found  
Voice from my pocket starts pulling me down  
Tells me my bucks aint enough  
And life doesnt have to be rough  
  
But a little white cloud  
Tells me what I crave  
And the way I feel  
Means my heart is saved  
And the money goes round  
And the babes are babes  
And the way I feel  
Means my heart is saved  
  
Personally I like Midwestern tows  
I like the girls there and even the clowns  
But now Ive been out on the wheel  
Out where youre worth what you steal  
And I cant go back to a yesterday  
No I cant turn back cause my heart is saved  
And I gotta believe all night and all day  
And when I believe my heart is saved  
  
Im weird and halfdead  
Theres a fortune in my head  
Dont touch me  
My heart is saved
