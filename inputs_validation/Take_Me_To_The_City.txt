Dont wanna give myself to you  
But your bodys on my mind  
Just wanna dance because of  
YouYou are moving me so right  
Wake me up Wake me up  
Make me crazy Have fun tonight  
First I didnt care for you  
Could pretend it to be shy  
Then I saw the naked truth  
Your body next to mine  
Make me hot Make me hot  
Take me to heaven  
Wanna feel your super body

Chorus  
Wake me up Take me to the city  
Wake me up I make myself so pretty  
Wake me up To you I wanna give it

You make me happy 1 2 3  
For me a reason not to cry  
You lift me up and let me fly  
Wake me up Wake me up

First I didnt see it through  
When I saw that you were right  
You made me scream that I love you  
So I keep your love tonight
