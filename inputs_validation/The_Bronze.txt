I been waiting  
Waiting under things that rise in the morning  
  
I been holding  
Holding back so long  
  
You can own it  
Take it off my hands do me a favor  
  
Nothin wasted  
Just finger fucked and busted up all at once  
  
Im so lost out on the highway  
With no direction left to go  
Everyday sit up and wonder  
Where it was I started from  
  
The more youve found the less youve been around
