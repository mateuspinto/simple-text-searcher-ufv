I was a nighthawkin in my taxi  
On a cruise below the deadline  
My fare was a shaky ol lush  
So I kicked it over and took off  
Then he whipped out this switch blade  
Straight outta nowhere level to my throat  
He said You ever been over to the war boy  
I said Man I was a combat paratrooper daddy  
Well then he slump back cool and he pocket that steel  
He said Take me down to Fourth and Main  
Ah that paratroop bluff always cools oh the red eyed geezers down  
Man that last block that cat was singing  
Man he was sittin in the backseat singing to me this song  
I got my BAR boy  
I got my M1 on my hip right  
You better listen mr president  
Oh boy dont you mess up with my war boy  
I wanna do I wanna do  
Lord I wanna do the Blood Boogaloo  
Im just a Redneck son of a gun  
I wanna kill me a gook before dawn  
Ah night hawkin for my change
