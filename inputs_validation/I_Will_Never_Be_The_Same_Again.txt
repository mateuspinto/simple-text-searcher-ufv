I will never be the same again  
I can never return Ive closed the door  
I will walk the path Ill run the race  
And I will never be the same again  
  
I will never be the same again  
I can never return Ive closed the door  
I will walk the path Ill run the race  
And I will never be the same again  
  
Fall like fire soak like rain  
Flow like mighty waters again and again  
Sweep away the darkness burn away the chaff  
And let the flame burn to glorify Your name  
  
There are higher heights there are deeper seas  
Whatever you need to do Lord do in me  
The Glory of God fills my life  
And I will never be the same again  
  
Fall like fire soak like rain  
Flow like mighty waters again and again  
Sweep aways the darkness burn away the chaff  
And let a flame burn to glorify Your name  
  
Fall like fire soak like rain  
Flow like mighty waters again and again  
Sweep away the darkness burn away the chaff  
And let a flame burn to glorify Your name  
  
I will never be the same again  
I can never return Ive closed the door  
I will walk the path I will run the race  
And I will never be the same again  
And I will never be the same again  
And I will never be the same again
