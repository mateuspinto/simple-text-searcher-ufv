I heard a human voice who sang like no one else  
I heard a proud lady singing loud  
Lived her life as she liked didnt give a damn  
But soon she found she was underground and wasted  
  
I watched her hitting notes as she strutted stage  
Her body shook oh she did her stuff  
She screamed and quake give and take maybe took too much  
If you take the smooth you gotta take the rough  
  
Why do you have to die to be a hero  
Its a shame a legend begins at its end  
Why do you have to die if youre a hero  
When theres still so many things to say unsaid  
  
I heard a mans guitar electrify a crowd  
I felt the sound shower round  
And he would take you with him where no musics been before  
As you merged the power surge together  
  
His music knew no limits if you were in its wake  
You had no choice no but hear its voice  
And you would listen hypnotized and in a dream  
But once so strong survive or become weak  
  
Why do you have to die to be a hero  
Its a shame a legend begins at its end  
Why do you have to die if youre a hero  
When theres still so many things to say unsaid  
  
If you gaze across timeless years youll find them always there  
And many gods will join the list compiled with dying care  
Hungry mouths are waiting to bite the hand that feeds  
And so the living dead carry on immortal deeds  
  
I saw on silver screen an actors rise to fame  
But fast car user lose  
That legends born from death and that is such a shame  
Cause every year new ones appear  
  
Why do you have to die to be a hero  
Its a shame a legend begins at its end  
Why do you have to die if youre a hero  
When theres still so many things to say unsaid
