The Reel in the Flickering Light  
By Christy Moore  
  
As I was walking home one evenin  
I know this takes some believin  
I met a group of creatures  
With the strangest lookin features  
  
A poor old dove and a worm in the weed  
And a fine old pigeon yes indeed  
A daddy longlegs jumpet sprite  
As he danced to the reel in the flickering light  
Oh round we go heel to the toe  
And the daddy longlegs jumpet sprite  
As he danced to the reel in the flickering light  
  
On his thin and wispy spindles  
He was deft and he was nimble  
His eyes were scientific  
And his dancing was terrific  
  
And the rats and worms they made a din  
And the nettles in the corners took it in  
Oh God says I Tonights the night  
Well dance to the reel in the flickering light  
Oh round we go heel to the toe  
Oh God says I tonights the night  
Well dance to the reel in the flickering light  
  
Then he looked at me directly  
With a gaze that could dissect me  
Then he asked me in a whisper  
Have you got any sisters  
  
Oh God almighty says I to him  
What sort of a man dyou think I am  
Ive only one shes not your type  
She wouldnt dance the reel in the flickering light  
So round we go heel to the toe  
Ive only one shes not your type  
She wouldnt dance a reel in the flickering light  
  
Says he  
Does she come from another planet  
Does she got a bee in her bonnet  
Does she do her daily duties  
You never know we might be suited  
  
And the rats and the worms began in to laugh  
And some of them started shufflin off  
Were goin to have some fun tonight  
Getting ready for the reel in the flickering light  
Oh round we go heel to the toe  
Were goin to have some fun tonight  
Getting ready for the reel in the flickering light  
  
I could see he had no scruples  
When I looked into his pupils  
They were purple or magenta  
Like a statue during lent  
  
I said Ill get her right away  
Good man says he now dont delay  
Were going to have some fun tonight  
And he flicked his legs in the flickering light  
Oh round we go heel to the toe  
Were goin to have some fun tonight  
And he flicked his legs in the flickering light  
  
Then up stepped a red carnation  
and they gave her an ovation  
She was warm and enchatin  
As she slowly started dancin  
  
And the wise old pigeon peeled his eye  
And the nettles and the weeds began to sigh  
Daddy longlegs said myohmy  
Are we ready for the reel in the flickering light   
Oh round we go heel to the toe  
Daddy longlegs said myohmy  
Are we ready for the reel in the flickering light   
  
She was gentle she was charmin  
And I heard him call her darlin  
He was graceful as a whisper  
On his delicate legs of silver  
  
And the rats and worms were still as mice  
And the poor old pigeon said Thats nice  
As shimmering there ah the lovely bride  
As they danced to the reel in the flickering light  
Oh round we go heel to the toe  
As shimmering there ah the lovely bride  
As they danced to the reel in the flickering light  
  
Oh round we go heel to the toe  
As shimmering there ah the lovely bride  
As they danced to the reel in the flickering light
