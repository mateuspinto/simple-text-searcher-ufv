Chorus  
For not being who you claim  
You get found guilty  
2 counts of bein lame  
You get found guilty  
The Charge of fuckin up the game  
You get found guilty  
Real niggas sentence you  
Dead Penalty  
Fabolous  
Uhhh  
Lets get back to this real shit  
We ride no pump breaks  
Errbody takin like they the shooters  
Mann I aint goin for them pump fakes  
These niggas is crump cakes  
Wish they would say some snake  
Get banged on like the treble makes  
The dumb mistake tryin to jumpin with blake  
These niggas in my lane  
Lob city in these streets  
Jessus piece on my chain  
Need God with me in these streets  
I went through hell to get to where heaven is  
Lucy in that red dress lookin devilish  
Scale a 1 to 10 she lookin elevenish  
If she aint ridin shotty AK 47 is  
Shorty came to me when she left her man  
I looked at her and said you sumthin else  
But the best way to get over sumbody  
Is gettin under sumone else  
On that note Im in that 1 2 3 pin that  
Baby tellin me Im the best I b yellin I been that  
In the club half a pill and a full clip  
Get a deal on a Rose no bullshit  
Game  
There goes ghost  
Im in that mothafucka like pacman  
Niggas talkin about robin I aint goin for that batman  
King of diamonds like super Sunday  
100 thou for that lap dance  
See straight thorugh you pussy niggas  
I call that a cat scan  
And on that note we in here  
Pink coroc pronto  
My gun throw bullets like payton manning  
My chic walk around wit that bronco  
Extend the clip in that conso  
  
2 mill for that condo  
We gon shot for that green  
I aint talkin no rondo  
Nigga tryin to say that I aint a G  
I point it at him said you sumthin else  
See these basketballs wife all around my table  
We bout to swim through em like Mike phelps  
Now pop open that tin pac  
Your life savings I spend that  
Niggas fan of my instagram  
Beggin me for their bitch back  
Sendin treats to my B M  
Tryin to hack my email  
Niggas wisperin to themselves  
All huddled up like females  
Your bitch about to be detailed  
I aint sparin no details  
She choked up like Sprewell  
I drop her off in the v12 niceee  
Ridin around wit that Houston rocket  
Keep all that of that Jeremy lin shit in yo pocket  
Chorus 2x  
Slim Thug  
Im goin back to cali  
Im goin back to cali  
Im out of drank and dro so Im goin back to cali  
I need pints by the cases for this bag of big faces  
Couple pounds of that kush I aint the only one getting wasted  
Smoke a lil sell the rest ima hustla baby  
Gotta Invest get mine plus interest  
You niggas still aint winiing yet  
I just sold my 4th bentley  
Then I got that photo porche  
Bout to switch it up for the summa  
Thinkin bout that electric hummer  
Strapped up got extra armor  
In case a hatin nigga wanna play  
Everythang I rep a 100  
You could check my resume  
They dont make em like me no more  
They dont make a miss t no more  
I dont see too many Gs  
I jus see a bunch of CP 4s  
Lets get back to that real shit  
That Pac BIG that UGk kinda trill shit  
East West and the South  
If you see a fake nigga point em out point em out
