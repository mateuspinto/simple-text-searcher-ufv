who is of smiling face bestower of all fortunes  
Whose hands are ready to rescue anyone from fear  
Who is adorned by various ornaments with precious stones  
  
Puer natus est nobis  
Et filius datus est nobis  
Cujus emperium super humerum  
For to us a child is born  
To us a son is given  
And the government will be upon his shoulder  
  
Some day you came  
And I knew you were the one  
You were the rain you were the sun  
But I needed both cause I needed you  
  
You were the one  
I was dreaming of all my life  
When it is dark you are my light  
But dont forget  
Whos always our guide  
  
It is the child in us
