Isnt life strange  
A turn of a page  
Can read like before  
Can we ask for more  
Each day passes by  
How hard man will try  
The sea will not wait  
You know it makes me want to cry cry cry  
  
Wish I could be in your heart  
To be one with your love  
Wish I could be in your eyes  
Looking back there your were and here we are  
  
Isnt love strange  
A word we arrange  
With no thought or care  
Maker of despair  
Each breath that we breathe  
With love we must weave  
To make us as one  
You know it makes me want to cry cry cry  
  
Wish I could be in your heart  
To be one with your love  
Wish I could be in your eyes  
Looking back there you were and here we are  
  
Isnt life strange  
A turn of a page  
A book without light  
Unless with love we write  
To throw it away  
To lose just a day  
The quicksand of time  
You know it makes me want to cry cry cry  
  
Wish I could be in your heart  
To be one with your love  
Wish I could be in your eyes  
Looking back there you were and here we are
