He sat up in his open window  
Looking quietly down at the path  
A firefly flew in his room and flew right out again  
  
Down jumped the prince  
And he went again to find his radio  
  
Magic transistor radio  
Glowing magic transistor radio  
Glowing magic transistor radio  
As he made his way he could hear something once again  
Glowing magic transistor radio  
There was that transistor up on the same tree  
  
Then from inside of it came a strange voice
