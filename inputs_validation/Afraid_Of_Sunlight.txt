Drive the road to your surrender  
Time comes around out of my hands  
Small boats on the beach at the dead of night  
Come and go before first light  
  
Leave me running in the wheel  
King of the world  
How do you feel  
What is there to feel  
  
So how do we now come to be  
Afraid of sunlight  
Tell me girl why you and me  
Scared of sunlight  
  
Been in pain for so long  
I cant even say what hurts anymore  
I will leave you alone  
I will deny  
I will leave you to bleed  
I will leave you with your life  
  
So how do we now come to be  
Afraid of sunlight  
Tell me girl why you and me  
Scared of sunlight  
  
All your spirit rack abuses  
Come to haunt you back by day  
All your Byzantine excuses  
Given time given you away  
  
Dont be surprised when daylight comes  
To find that memory prick your thumbs  
Youll tell them where we run to hide  
Im already dead  
Its a matter of time  
  
So how do we now come to be  
Afraid of sunlight  
How do we now come to be  
Afraid of sunlight  
  
DayGlo Jesus on the dash  
Chalk marks on the road ahead  
Friendly fire in hostile waters  
Keep the faith  
Dont lose your head  
  
So how do we now come to be
