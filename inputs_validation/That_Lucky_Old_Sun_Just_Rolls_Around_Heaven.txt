Up in the mornin  
Out on the job  
Work like the devil for my pay  
But that lucky old sun got nothin to do  
But roll around heaven all day  
  
Fuss with my woman toil for my kids  
Sweat till Im wrinkled and gray  
While that lucky old sun got nothin to do  
But roll around heaven all day  
  
Dear Lord above cant you know Im pining tears all in my eyes  
Send down that cloud with a silver lining lift me to paradise  
  
Show me that river take me across  
Wash all my troubles away  
Like that lucky old sun give me nothing to do  
But roll around heaven all day  
  
Send down that cloud with a silver lining lift me to paradise  
  
Show me that river take me across  
Wash all my troubles away  
Like that lucky old sun give me nothing to do  
But roll around heaven all day
