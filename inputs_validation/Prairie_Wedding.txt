We only knew each other by letter  
When I met her over the train  
When the smoke cleared and the dust was still  
She was standing there speaking my name  
  
I guarantee she looked like an angel  
I couldnt think of what I should say  
But when Adam saw Eve in the garden  
I believe he felt the selfsame way  
  
I handed her up on the wagon  
And I loaded up her trunk behind  
She was sitting up there with the gold in her hair  
I tried to get a hope on my mind  
  
You think that you could love me Mary   
You think we got a chance of a life  
Do you think that you could love me Mary  
Now you are to be my wife  
  
We finally headed out of the station  
And drove up my home trail  
And when we came to the farm she laid a hand on my arm  
I thought my resolution would fail  
  
Now froze as she stepped through the doorway  
And I stood there as still as could be  
I said I know it aint much it needs a womans touch  
Perhaps she turned around and looked at me  
  
Do you think that   
  
We had a prairie wedding  
There was a preacher and a neighbor or two  
I gave my golden thing a gold wedding ring  
And the both of us said I do  
  
Now when the sun is going down in the prairie  
And the golden hair is a flame  
I say do you really love me Mary  
I hold her and I whisper her name  
  
Do you think that
