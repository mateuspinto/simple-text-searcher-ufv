What you dont know can lead you to the extremes  
Shunning help though you feel a need  
You fear to be caught limping and you lose your place  
And leaning on the everlasting arms is not your taste  
Maybe youve heard those stories laughed at what you saw on TV  
Or felt disgust as He was used an excuse for bigotry  
But Ive got to tell you thats not what its all about  
Cause the truth I know will turn you around  
If you really knew  
You would change your mind  
If you knew the God I know  
You would have the time  
If you take a chance  
I know you will find  
Everything you need in love of another kind  
I too have been hurt by those who claimed to show the way  
It was crazy their two faces like night and day  
But you dont stop believing cause you once been burned  
In everything theres a lesson learned oh yeah yeah  
Man is imperfect there is just one perfect soul  
So much more loving than than one that youve been shown  
How long is it gonna take for you to realize  
I wish that you would open your eyes  
If you really knew  
You would change your mind  
If you knew the God I know  
You would have the time  
If you take a chance  
I know you will find  
Everything you need in love of another kind  
I apologize to you on behalf of the untrue  
Because the God I know would never do the things they do  
Mercy and compassion on the right and on the left  
Can you give anymore than your last breath  
Oh too hard to see well put your mind aside  
And stop using fear to hide behind  
If you really knew  
You would change your mind  
If you knew the God I know  
You would have the time  
If you take a chance  
I know you will find  
Everything you need in love of another kind  
If you really knew  
You would change your mind  
If you knew the God I know  
You would have the time  
If you take a chance  
I know you will find  
Everything you need in love  
Everything you need in love of another kind  
Love of another kind  
Gods love is enough for you  
And its waiting if you only  
Gods love is enough for you  
And its waiting if you only  
Gods love is enough for you  
And its waiting if you only knew  
Gods love is enough for you  
And its waiting
