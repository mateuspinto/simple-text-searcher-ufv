Last Christmas I gave you my heart  
But the very next day you gave it away  
This year to save me from tears  
Ill give it to someone special  
  
Once bitten and twice shy  
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye  
Tell me baby  
Do you recognize me  
Well its been a year it doesnt surprise me  
Merry Christmas I wrapped it up and sent it  
With a note saying I love you I meant it  
Now I know what a fool Ive been  
But if you kiss me now I know youd fool me again  
  
Last Christmas I gave you my heart  
But the very next day you gave it away  
This year to save me from tears  
Ill give it to someone special  
  
Last Christmas I gave you my heart  
But the very next day you gave it away  
This year to save me from tears  
Ill give it to someone special  
  
A crowded room and friends with tired eyes  
Im hiding from you and your soul of eyes  
My God I thought you were someone to rely on  
Me I guess I was a shoulder to cry on  
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart  
A girl on a cover but you tore her apart  
Maybe this year  
Maybe this year Ill give it to someone special  
  
Cause last Christmas I gave you my heart  
But the very next day you gave it away  
This year to save me from tears  
Ill give it to someone special  
  
Last Christmas I gave you my heart  
But the very next day you gave it away  
This year to save me from tears  
Ill give it to someone special  
  
And last Christmas  
And this year  
It wont be anything like anything like  
  
Last Christmas I gave you my heart  
But the very next day you gave it away  
This year to save me from tears  
Ill give it to someone special
