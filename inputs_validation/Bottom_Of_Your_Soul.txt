Where are the children we lost not long ago  
Feel for the Mothers who weep for them  
I pray for the Fathers who are standing by their side  
In their world of pain and suffering  
  
Have you ever seen the look in a hungry childs eyes  
They cant eat money or promises  
Give them your smile and try holding out your hand  
Let them know youre there let them know youre there  
  
Chorus  
  
Why is it always the ones that we love  
Are the ones that will never come home  
Why must all of the bridges we cross take their toll  
Always remember the voice in your head  
Speaks to you when youre alone  
And it comforts you  
From the top of your heart to the bottom of your soul  
  
You can swim in a river of tears they cry  
For they sleep on the winds of uncertainty  
Show us a sign and make us believe again  
Theres no other way oh theres no other way
