Youre light is over me  
Flooding over me  
The night is lifted  
  
Heaven over me  
Flooding over me  
I cant contain it  
  
My cup overflows  
My cup overflows  
  
Praise the Lord  
With all my heart  
Praise Him for He  
Has done great things  
  
His banner over me is love  
His love  
His banner over me is love  
His love  
  
You brought the sunshine in  
Turned the dark to day  
You made the shadows flee away  
  
You opened up my eyes  
To a new and living way  
The dawning of a brand new day
