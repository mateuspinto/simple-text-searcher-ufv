I said yes I said yes I said yes  
I prayed a thousand times yes  
And the no that was hanging over the buildings  
Faded like the moon at dawn  
  
When I was young I thought I was facing  
A very aware world ahead  
I didnt know it was going to be  
beware of dogs instead  
  
I said no I said no I said no  
I said no a million times to no  
But the yes that was in its last breath  
Still hovered in a room with a permanent flu  
  
When I was young I didnt know  
That one can only read life in braille  
I was still struggling to catch life on its tail  
  
I said why I said why I said why  
I asked why for the billionth time  
And my bone slowly lost its moist  
Like a leftover coke bottle on the street  
  
Yes this dry whiteness of a thing on the square  
thats my bone  
It lets the wind pass over like the last tender fraud  
Makes a little noise like old campaign billboard  
  
I said yes I said yes I said yes  
I prayed a thousand times yes  
And the no that was hanging over faded
