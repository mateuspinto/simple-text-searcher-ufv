All my hopes  
And all my dreams  
God I lay them at Your feet  
Cause all I want is You  
  
All I have  
And all I am  
I surrender every part of me  
Cause all I want is You  
  
Take my life  
Take my everything  
Take my heart  
Take every part of me  
  
God I give my heart my life to You  
And Ill never stop No  
Never stop giving it all to You  
  
Cause all I have is Yours  
And all I am is Yours
