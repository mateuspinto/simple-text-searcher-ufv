The sun will rise  
Our golden prize  
No shadow fall  
Upon our lives  
The sands of time  
Wont fall for us  
No ash to ash no dust to dust  
Eternal summer waits for us  
Our bodies bronze we thirst we lust  
The changes of the years wont touch us no  
  
Chorus  
We are eternal  
We are young we are strong  
We are immortal the life force is in our hands  
On we go through seas of time  
We hear the voive we drink the wine  
I build you burn then one forgets  
The evils of the innocent  
A face of wonder a heart will cry  
The stain of death upon her eyes  
A moment caught in time  
Im alive  
  
Chorus  
We are eternal  
We are immortal  
We are the flame that never dies  
We are eternal  
We are immortal  
Well never die
