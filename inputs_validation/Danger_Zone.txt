New York city is a real cool town  
Society really brings me down  
Our playground is a pharmacy  
Kids find trouble so easily  
  
Other countries are just as bad  
The soviets really make me mad  
On the boulevard where police hide  
Lets steal a car for a joyride  
  
They say youre just an awkward kid  
You flipped your lid you flipped your lid  
You love wine like they love cash  
Feel your rage spread like a rash  
  
You flipped your lid you flipped your lid  
You flipped your lid you flipped your lid  
They say youre just an awkward kid  
You flipped your lid you flipped your lid  
  
All alone in the danger zone  
Danger zone danger zone  
All alone in the danger zone  
Danger zone danger zone
