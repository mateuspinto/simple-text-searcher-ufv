I sat in the window of my room  
Watched you go away  
It was all I could do  
It was all I could do  
  
Your going away  
To leave me alone  
In all of this sorrow  
In this misery  
  
So look now my darling  
Ill have to abandon  
All thought of you  
As your going away  
  
I still see your dear little head  
As it touched mine  
Saying goodbye forever goodbye  
Those words you said to me have broken my heart  
Yes theyve broken my heart  
They were false and did lie  
  
Goodbye my dear  
Goodbye forever  
Your going away  
Your going away  
  
Death is hard  
But your leaving is worse  
Oh yes my dear  
Your leaving is worse  
  
Your going my dear  
Your going forever  
And leaving me all alone with this grief  
  
So how my dear  
How will I forget you  
When I see your face wherever I go  
When I close my eyes  
Its as though I see you  
Your beautiful blue eyes your beautiful lie  
  
I sat in the window of my room  
An I watched you go away  
It was all I could do  
It was all I could do
