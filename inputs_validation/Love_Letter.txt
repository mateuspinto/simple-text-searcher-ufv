L hold d this letter in my hand  
A plea of petition a kind of prayer  
I hope it does as I have planned  
Losing her again is more than I can bear  
  
I kiss the cold white envelope  
Press my lips against her name  
Two hundred words we live in hope  
The sky hangs heavy with rain  
  
Love letter love letter  
Go get her go get her  
Love letter love letter  
Go tell her go tell her  
  
A wicked wind whips up the hill  
Hand full of hopeful words  
I love her and I always will  
The sky is ready to burst  
  
Said something I did not mean to say  
Said something I did not mean to say  
Said something I did not mean to say  
It all came out the wrong way  
  
Love letter love letter  
Go get her go get her  
Love letter love letter  
Go tell her go tell her  
  
Rain your kisses down upon me  
Rain your kisses down in storms  
For all will come before me  
In your thin and fading forms  
  
Out of my mind  
Will leave me standing in the rain  
With a letter and a prayer  
Whispered on the wind  
  
Come back to me  
Come back to me  
Oh baby please come back to me
