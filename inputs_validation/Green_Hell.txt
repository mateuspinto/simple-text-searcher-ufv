Here in this place lies the genie of death  
Touch it see it  
Whoa  
Here in this place is a means to your end  
Touch it feel it  
Green hell  
  
Youve come to this like no one could  
I bet you never knew you woke it  
And dont you run away from anything  
I bet you thought you really could in hell  
  
Were gonna burn in hell  
Green hell  
Like every hell but kind of green  
In hell green hell  
Were gonna face the mess were  
In hell green hell  
I think Id rather be up here  
In hell green hell  
You know I fucking shake apart  
In hell green hell  
Gotta find a way that you will stay  
Green hell  
Cannot forget about the heat  
In hell green hell  
Hell is green I need a flame  
In hell green hell  
Gotta burn in hell  
Green hell  
  
Youve come to this like no one could  
I bet you never knew you woke it  
And dont you run from anything  
I bet you thought you really could take it  
  
Here in this place is the genie of death  
Touch it see it  
Whoa  
Here in this place is the way to your end  
Touch it feel it  
Green hell  
  
Youve come to this like no one could  
I bet you never knew you woke it  
And dont you run away from anything  
I bet you thought you really could  
Youve come to this like no one could  
I bet you never knew you woke it  
Were gonna burn in Hell  
Green hell
