You tell me theres an angel in your tree  
Did he say hed come to call on me  
For things are getting desperate in our home  
Living in the parish of the restless folks I know  
  
Everybody now bring your family down to the riverside  
Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide  
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps  
Its time we put the flame torch to their keep  
  
Burn down the mission  
If were gonna stay alive  
Watch the black smoke fly to heaven  
See the red flame light the sky  
  
Burn down the mission  
Burn it down to stay alive  
Its our only chance of living  
Take all you need to live inside  
  
Deep in the woods the squirrels are out today  
My wife cried when they came to take me away  
But what more could I do just to keep her warm  
Than burn burn burn burn down the mission walls  
  
Bring your family down to the riverside  
Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide  
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps  
Its time we put the flame torch to their keep  
  
Burn down the mission  
If were gonna stay alive  
Watch the black smoke fly to heaven  
See the red flame light the sky  
  
Burn down the mission  
Burn it down to stay alive  
Its our only chance of living  
Take all you need to live inside
