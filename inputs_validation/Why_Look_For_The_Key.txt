And they made the secret pact  
His knowledge would be tapped  
The link was based on a respect  
On their lives they would reflect  
A perfect state of nonattachment  
Was striven for and claimed as fact  
The younger grew and learnt his lesson well  
All his ideals were intact  
Why look for the key in another  
The answer lay in his own heart  
Wont find yourself in some other  
It always was there right at the start  
But power it corrupted  
Thats where attachment starts  
The power had erupted  
The spell will crack  
As each mental bond was broken  
Strength grew in the young mans heart  
What began as love not passion  
Had left a seed in his heart  
Why look for the key in another
