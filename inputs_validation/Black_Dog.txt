Black dog barking in the cold grey light  
He pulls the chain and he pulls it tight  
This aint no lonesome wail that boy aint faking  
He bites the steel and he claws the ground  
He pulls again and he spins around  
His eyes are raging and his burning lungs are steaming  
  
He want to walk in the sun  
Feel love like anyone  
No one knows that black dog better than I  
I said no one knows that black dog better than I  
  
When I see his running I can see me  
Teeth in the collar and hes tearing it free  
Spit out the leather and the cold studs that kept you from singing  
Run till youre bleeding run till youre hot  
till the memory of all this youve long since forgot  
Run till forever till the bells of your freedom are ringing  
  
He want to walk in the sun  
Feel love like anyone  
No one knows that black dog better than I  
I said no one knows that black dog better than I
