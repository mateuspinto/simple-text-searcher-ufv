Softly I will leave you softly  
For my heart would break if you should wake and see me go  
So I leave you softly long before you miss me  
Long before your arms can beg me stay  
For one more hour or one more day  
After all the years I cant bear the tears to fall  
So softly as I leave you there  
Softly long before you kiss me  
Long before your arms can beg me stay  
For one more hour or one more day  
After all the years I cant bear the tears to fall  
So softly as I leave you there  
As I leave I you there  
As I leave I you there
