Fifty thousand men were sent to do the will of one  
His claim was phrased quite simply though he never voiced it loud  
I am he the chosen one  
  
In his name they could slaughter for his name they could die  
Though many there were believed in him still more were sure he lied  
But theyll fight the battle on  
  
Then one whose faith had died  
Fled back up the mountainside  
But before the top was made  
A misplaced footfall made him stray  
From the path prepared for him  
Off of the mountain  
On to a wilderness of ice  
  
This unexpected vision made them stand and shake with fear  
But nothing was his fright compared with those who saw him appear  
Terror filled their minds with awe  
  
Simple were the folk who lived  
Upon this frozen wave  
So not surprising was their thought  
This is he Gods chosen one  
Whos come to save us from  
All our oppressors  
We shall be kings on this world  
  
Follow me  
Ill play the game you want me  
Until I find a way back home  
  
Follow me  
I give you strength inside you  
Courage to win your battles   
  
No no no this cant go on  
This will be all that I fled from  
Let me rest for a while  
  
He walked into a valley  
All alone  
There he talked with water and then with the vine  
  
They leave me no choice  
I must lead them to glory or most likely to death  
  
They traveled cross the plateau of ice up to its edge  
Then they crossed a mountain range and saw the final plain  
Still he urged the people on  
  
Then on a distant slope  
He observed one without hope  
Flee back up the mountainside  
He thought he recognized him by his walk  
And by the way he fell  
And by the way he  
Stood up and vanished into air
