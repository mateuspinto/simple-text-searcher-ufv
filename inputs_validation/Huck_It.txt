Hitting walls for a feet  
With our friends and we hear this free  
All the dogs dropping bombs  
He see  
  
HUCK IT  
You dont have the ties  
You wont have the eyes  
HUCK IT  
Cause you realize  
You dont need to justify  
That cable show is not the lives we know  
  
Drop a bomb in the publics eye  
Fuck the SPONSORS they always lie  
You are pointing to go fast and GO  
  
Broken bombs and baking skin  
Notify your next of kin  
Youll know youll come alive some day  
  
HUCK IT  
Now you feel alive  
Stinks like shit all the time  
HUCK IT  
Its like you gotta try  
Risky shit by the time  
  
You can not practice lay it on the line  
  
HUCK IT  
Now youre down in luck  
Cause you dont give a fuck  
  
HUCK IT  
And go by the time  
You go out doin what you know  
No talking shit just leave it all and go home
