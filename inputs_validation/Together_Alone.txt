Together alone  
Above and beneath  
We were as close  
As anyone can be  
  
Now you are gone  
Far away from me  
As is once  
Will always be  
  
Together alone  
  
Anei ra maua here we are together  
E piri tahi nei in a very close embrace  
E noha tahi nei being together  
Ko maua anake just us alone  
Kei runga a Rangi Rangi the skyfather is above  
Ko papa kei raro the earth mother is below  
E mau tonu nei our love for one another  
Kia mau tonu ra is everlasting  
  
Together alone  
Shallow and deep  
Holding our breath  
Paying death no heed  
  
Im still your friend  
When you are in need  
As is once  
Will always be  
  
Earth and sky  
Moon and sea  
  
Anei ra maua here we are together  
E piri tahi nei in a very close embrace  
E noha tahi nei being together  
Ko maua anake just us alone  
Kei runga a Rangi Rangi the skyfather is above  
Ko papa kei raro the earth mother is below  
E mau tonu nei our love for one another  
Kia mau tonu ra is everlasting
