He walks these streets some nights until way past twelve  
His mind cant decide if hes in heavenhe just cant tell  
He sees her standing there smiling by the lamp post shine  
His heart cant remember ever feeling oh so fine  
  
She gone  
She not coming back no way  
She gone  
She not coming back to stay  
  
She gone  
And as she turns away his eyes lost in her back  
His feet continue down some ancient railroad track  
And right then right there he sees that hes done wrong  
  
And as he opens his eyes realizes that she gone  
Well she gone she not coming back no way  
She gone she not coming back to stay  
Well she gone she never coming back again  
  
She gone whats he gonna do til then  
She gone  
She gone  
She gone  
  
She gone so far away  
She gone
