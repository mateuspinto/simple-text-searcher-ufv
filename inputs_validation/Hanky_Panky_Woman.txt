Youve been treatin me like dirt now you dont care how I hurt now  
But theres no thing you better try and understand  
You gonna come home one of these nights find your mama aint doin you right  
You got a hanky panky woman on your hand  
Well Im tryin to be good now a doin everything I should now  
But you come home just when you want to mend  
Better listen to what I say now cause a gonna come a day now  
Youll have a hanky panky woman on your hand  
What will you say now what will you do now  
You gonna lose your lovin woman you better listen man  
You better stop and realize now aint tellin no lies now  
Youll have a hanky panky woman on your hand  
 guitar   
Well you know you been doin me wrong now it aint a gonna be too long now  
And I try to tell you exactly where you stand  
You know what youve been doin you headed straight toward ruin  
You got a hanky panky woman on your hand  
What will you say now  
Youll have a hanky panky woman on your hand  
Youll have a hanky panky woman on your hand
