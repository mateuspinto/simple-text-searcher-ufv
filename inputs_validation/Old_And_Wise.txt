As far as my eyes can see  
There are shadows approaching me  
And to those I left behind  
I wanted you to know  
Youve always shared my deepest thoughts  
You follow where I go  
  
And oh when Im old and wise  
Bitter words mean little to me  
Autumn winds will blow right through me  
And someday in the mist of time  
When they asked me if I knew you  
Id smile and say you were a friend of mine  
And the sadness would be Lifted from my eyes  
Oh when Im old and wise  
  
As far as my eyes can see  
There are shadows surrounding me  
And to those I leave behind  
I want you all to know  
Youve always shared my darkest hours  
Ill miss you when I go  
  
And oh when Im old and wise  
Heavy words that tossed and blew me  
Like autumn winds will blow right through me  
And someday in the mist of time  
When they ask you if you knew me  
Remember that you were a friend of mine  
As the final curtain falls before my eyes  
Oh when Im Old and wise  
  
As far as my eyes can see
