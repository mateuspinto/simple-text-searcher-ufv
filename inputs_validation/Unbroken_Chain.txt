Blue light rain whoa unbroken chain  
Looking for familiar faces in an empty window pane  
  
Listening for the secret searching for the sound  
But I could only hear the preacher and the baying of his hounds  
  
Willow sky whoa I walk and wonder why  
They say love your brother but you will catch it when you try  
  
Roll you down the line boy drop you for a loss  
Ride you out on a cold railroad and nail you to a cross  
  
November and more as I wait for the score  
Theyre telling me forgiveness is the key to every door  
A slow winder day a night like forever  
Sink like a stone float like a feather  
  
instrumental  
Lilac rain unbroken chain Song of the sawhet owl  
Out on the mountain itll drive you insane Listening to the winds howl  
  
Unbroken chain of sorrow and pearls Unbroken chain of shy and sea  
Unbroken chain of the western wind Unbroken chain of you and me
