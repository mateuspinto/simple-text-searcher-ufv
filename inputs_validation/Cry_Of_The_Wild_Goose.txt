My heart knows what the wild goose knows  
And I must go where the wild goose goes  
Wild goose brother goose which is best  
A wandering fool or a heart at rest  
  
Tonight I heard the wild goose cry  
Hanging north in the lonely sky  
Tried to sleep it wasnt no use  
Cause I am a brother to the old wild goose  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh my heart knows what the wild goose knows  
And I must go where the wild goose goes  
Wild goose brother goose which is best  
A wandering fool or a heart at rest  
  
Woman was kind and true to me  
She thinks she loves me more fool she  
Shes got a love that aint no use  
To love a brother of the old wild goose  
  
The cabin is warm and the snow is deep  
And I got a woman who lies asleep  
Shell wake up tomorrows dawn  
And find poor critter that her man is gone  
  
Oh my heart knows what the wild goose knows  
And I must go where the wild goose goes  
Wild goose brother goose which is best  
A wandering fool or a heart at rest  
  
Let me fly let me fly let me fly away  
  
Spring is coming and the ice will break  
And I cant linger for a womans sake  
Shell see a shadow pass overhead  
And shell find a feather side her bed
