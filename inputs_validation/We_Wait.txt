We wait  
Were not in a hurry  
O we need You Lord  
We wait  
All our cares and worries  
We lay aside for You  
O how we long to see Your face  
O how we long for Your embrace  
  
We wait  
Were not afraid to tarry  
We yearn for You Lord  
We wait  
For Your mighty wind to carry us  
Into Your presence Lord  
And as we fill this house with praise  
Let Your holy fire fill this place  
  
As we wait  
  
And as we fill this house with praise  
Let Your holy fire fill this place  
  
We wait
