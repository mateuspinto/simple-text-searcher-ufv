The birds outside my window  
Want to drive this stupid song into my head  
I wake up in this empty bed alone  
I guess its somethin that I said  
I tried to open up a door between us  
But I guess it was a wall instead  
And I try and I try  
And it tears me all up inside  
  
Tell me your dreams  
What do they mean  
And what do we want from each other  
Where do we go  
Nobody knows  
And what do we want from each other  
  
Seven forty five  
I got a flight  
But youre still mad about last night  
Tear apart Pandoras box  
I try to open every lock in sight  
And I try and I try  
And it tears me all up inside  
  
Tell me your dreams  
What do they mean  
And what do we want from each other  
Where do we go  
Nobody knows  
And what do we want from each other  
  
Another Sunday mornin comin down  
But Im tryin to see the bright side  
Another cold and unforgiving dawn  
I wish I was on your right side right side  
I wish that you could understand  
That words can fail the best intentions maam  
And I try and I try  
And it tears me all up inside  
  
Tell me your dreams  
What do they mean  
And what do we want from each other  
Where do we go  
Nobody knows  
And what do we want from each other  
  
Tell me your dreams  
What do they mean  
And what do we want from each other  
Where do we go  
Nobody knows  
And what do we want from each other  
  
And them birds outside my window  
Wanna drive this stupid song into my head
