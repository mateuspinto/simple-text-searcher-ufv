A warm dry wind is all that breaks the silence  
The highways quiet scars across the land  
People lie eyes closed no longer dreaming  
The earth dies screaming  
Like scattered pebbles cars lie silent waiting  
Oil less engines seized by dirt and sand  
Bodies hanging limp no longer bleeding  
The earth dies screaming  
  
The earth dies screaming  
The earth dies screaming  
Your country needs you lets strike up the band  
  
The earth dies screaming  
The earth dies screaming  
Despite all odds we must defend our land  
  
Half eaten meals lie rotting on the tables  
Money clutched within a bony hand  
Shutters down the banks are not receiving  
The earth dies screaming
