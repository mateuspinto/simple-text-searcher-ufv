If I give up this seat Ive been saving  
To some elderly lady or man  
Am I being a good girl  
Am I still your sweet pearl  
Mother please if youre pleased say I am  
  
And if while in the course of my duty  
I perform an unfortunate take  
Would you punish me so unbelievably so  
Never again would I make that mistake  
This feeling inside me  
Can never deny me  
The right to be wrong if I choose  
And the pleasure I get from say  
Winning a bet  
Is to lose  
  
When Im drinking my Bonaparte shandy  
Eating more than enough apple pies  
Would I glance in my screen  
And see real human beings  
Starve to death right in front of my eyes  
  
Nothing old nothing new  
Nothing ventured nothing gained  
Nothing stillborn or lost  
Nothing further than proof  
Nothing older than you  
Nothing sweeter than wine  
Nothing older than time  
Nothing physically recklessly hopelessly blind  
Nothing I couldnt say  
Nothing why  
Cause today nothing rhymed ooh ooh ooh ooh  
  
Yeah this feeling inside me  
Can never deny me  
The right to be wrong if I choose  
The pleasure I get from say  
Winning a bet  
Is to lose  
  
Nothing good nothing bad  
Nothing ventured nothing gained  
Nothing stillborn or lost  
Nothing further than proof  
Nothing wilder than you  
Nothing sweeter than wine  
Nothing older than time  
Nothing physically hopelessly recklessly blind  
Nothing I couldnt say  
Nothing why  
Cause today nothing rhymed ooh oh oh oh ooh ooh ooh oh  
Nothing rhymed
