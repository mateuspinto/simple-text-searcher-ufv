When time is like a needle  
And night is the longest day  
A home is a cathedral  
A place where a king can pray  
  
Ghosts all gone  
Ghosts all gone  
To another plane  
Los Reyes Catolicos Repeat x4  
  
Ghosts all gone  
Ghosts all gone  
To another plane  
Los Reyes Catolicos  
Los Reyes Catolicos  
  
A home is like a castle  
A place where a king can reign  
Los Reyes Catolicos  
Raoul and The Kings of Spain  
Ghosts all gone  
  
Ghosts all gone  
Ghosts all gone  
To another plane
