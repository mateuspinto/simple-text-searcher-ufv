On the beach in Hawaii  
  
I wish you were here with me walking on the beach in Hawaii  
Playing on the golden sand looking at the ocean now I understand  
Love is like the open sea and I wish you were here with me  
On the beach in Hawaii  
  
Since youve been gone away I think about you everyday  
Dont you know I miss you much and you know I need your touch  
Im on a rocky cliff oh I wish you were hear with me  
On the beach in Hawaii  
  
A little pakalolo and I say mahalo  
Ujjayi breathing to get a real feeling  
Yogi gonna let you know  
That I wish you were here with me  
On the beach in Hawaii  
In Hawaii
