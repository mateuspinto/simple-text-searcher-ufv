Ive gone a long long way  
Since the day you walked into my life  
Weve smoothed out all the rough edges  
Of our sweet love and devotion  
The price is high given life as a scale  
Wondering where Id gone wrong  
And I know its going to work out fine  
When I see that look in your eyes  
I never felt so good  
I never felt so strong  
Nothing can stop us now  
Yeah nothing can stop us now  
Incomprehensible some people say  
That a man who thinks that a woman is weak  
Is so wrong  
Cause nobody can hide from you  
We both know something else is true  
Just the touch of your hand  
And I know were going to make it  
I never felt so good  
I never felt so strong  
Nothing can stop us now  
I never felt so good  
I never felt so strong  
Nothing can stop us now  
Nothing can stop us now  
Nothing can stop us now  
Nothing can stop us now
