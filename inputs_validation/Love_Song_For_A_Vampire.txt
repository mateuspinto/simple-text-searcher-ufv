Come into these arms again  
And lay your body down  
The rhythm of this trembling heart  
Is beating like a drum  
It beats for you  
It bleeds for you  
It knows not how it sounds  
For it is the drum of drums  
It is the song of songs  
  
Once I had the rarest rose  
That ever deigned to bloom  
Cruel winter chilled the bud  
And stole my flower too soon  
Oh loneliness Oh hopelessness  
To search the ends of time  
For there is in all the world  
No greater love than mine  
  
Love oh love oh love oh love  
Still falls the rain  
Love oh love oh love oh love  
Still falls the night  
Love oh love oh love oh love  
Be mine forever  
Love oh love oh love oh love  
  
Let me be the only one  
To keep you from the cold  
Now the floor of heavens laid  
With stars of brightest gold  
They shine for you they shine for you  
They burn for all to see  
Come into these arms again  
And set this spirit free  
  
set it free set it free
