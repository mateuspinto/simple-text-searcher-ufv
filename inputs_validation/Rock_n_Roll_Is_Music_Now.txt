Mama knows and papa knows  
That rock n roll is music now  
Babys been cutting his teeth on Bo Diddleys  
Im a man man  
Listen to the Wolfman howl  
See the white man sailing his ship up on the sea  
Watch the white man shackle the black man to a tree  
To the invader go the fruits of war  
He misses home and his boots are sore  
He has not got no roots no more  
He comes for your gold  
Watch out for your soul  
  
Cause tennis shoes and rhythm and blues  
Are second generation  
All across the nation now  
And mama knows  
Papa too rock n roll is music  
Rock n roll is music now  
To the invader go the fruits of war  
He misses home and his boots are sore  
He has not got no roots no more  
He comes for your gold  
Watch out for your soul  
Mama knows and papa knows  
That rock n roll is music  
Rock n roll is music now
