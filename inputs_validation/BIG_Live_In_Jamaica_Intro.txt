Ladies and Gentlemen  
Were gonna ask you for some fanfare The band fanfare because Ladies and
gentlemen Sting has always gone ahead of itself  
They have done it again and again and again  
I remember the year they brought in the fat boys they were hotter then ten

And if you know And if you enjoy hiphop If you want one of the coldest
brothaz out of North America A brotha that gave you a song like  
Juicy
