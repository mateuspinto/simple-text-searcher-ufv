All around theres hurried confusion  
The cares of life are pressing in  
All through the day  
They try to steal my faith  
With words that hurt and deeds that block my way  
  
Ah but thats when I remind myself whos child that I am  
And inside me there is strength to overcome  
And then I speak His name and the tension breaks  
And His love flows as a song to my heart  
  
Chorus  
Whenever I speak His name I call upon His name  
And all the burdens of my heart They roll away  
I just breathe His name I call upon His name  
And all the cares of this world They roll away  
If God is for me who can be against me  
Whom shall I fear with God on my side  
You see Jesus and me we are a majority  
And no matter how big the mountain itll have to leave  
  
Oh so why should I be troubled and have anxiety  
And let lifes little problems bother me  
Because He lives I have His strength And because He is that assures my
victory  
  
Chorus  
Whenever I speak His name I call upon His name  
And all the burdens of my heart They roll away  
I just breathe His name I call upon His name  
And all the cares of this world They roll away  
  
Tag  
M m m they roll away  
They roll away  
They roll away hey hey  
They roll away  
Whenever I speak His name
