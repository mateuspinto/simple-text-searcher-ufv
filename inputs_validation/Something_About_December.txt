Lights around the tree  
Mamas whistling  
Takes me back again  
Theres something bout December  
  
Were hanging mistletoe  
And hoping that it snows  
I close my eyes and then  
I can still remember  
How to get back home  
  
Let all your memories  
Hold you close  
No matter where you are  
Youre not alone  
Because the ones you love  
Are never far  
If Christmas is in your heart  
  
Who really needs a gift  
When love is meant to give  
I can still recall  
Carry with me always  
Every Christmas dream  
They live in you and me  
  
Let all your memories  
Hold you close  
No matter where you are  
Youre not alone  
Because the ones you love  
Are never far  
If Christmas is in your heart  
  
Lights around the tree  
Mamas whistling  
Takes me back again  
Theres something bout December  
  
Let all your memories  
Hold you close  
No matter where you are  
Youre not alone  
Because the ones you love  
Are never far  
If Christmas is in your heart
