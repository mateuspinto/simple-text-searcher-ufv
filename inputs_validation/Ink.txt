Got a tattoo that says 2gether thru life  
Carved in your name with my pocket knife  
And you wonder when you wake up will it be alright  
Feels like theres something broken inside  
  
All I know all I know  
Is that Im lost whenever you go  
All I know is that I love you so  
So much that it hurts  
  
Got a tattoo and the pains alright  
Just wanted a way of keeping you inside  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
All I know all I know  
Is that Im lost in your fire below  
  
All I know  
Is that I love you so  
So much that it hurts  
  
See the road begin to climb  
See your stars begin to shine  
I see your colors and Im dying of thirst  
  
All I know is that I love you so  
So much that it hurts  
Oh yeah yeah yeah  
So much that it hurts
