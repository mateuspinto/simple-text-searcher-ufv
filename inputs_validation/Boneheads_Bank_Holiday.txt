You know I need a little break  
To get away for a holiday  
So I can see the sun  
Cause in the sun they say its fun  
If you can get some  
Well I could take a train or a boat or an aeroplane  
Or I could steal a car  
Cause in a car you can go far  
Just depends what kinda car you are  
  
La la la la la la la la la la la  
What kinda car you are  
La la la la la la la la la la la  
  
I met a funny looking girl  
On a crowded beach in Spain  
Her name was Avaline  
She said she came to Spain to have a good time  
But she was with her mum  
Who had a face like a nun in pain  
She said her name was Dot  
She didnt half talk a lot  
I couldnt tell if she was mad or not  
  
La la la la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la la la la  
  
Dont you know  I should have stayed in England  
On my polluted beach  with all my special friends  
Dont ya know  I should have stayed in England  
With my big house and my big car  
And all my friends there at the bar  
  
La la la la la la la

It just depends on what kind of car you are
