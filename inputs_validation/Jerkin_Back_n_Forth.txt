I know I let you tell me what to do  
You were confident you know best  
Now things arent working like you want them to  
Your confidence is what I detest  
You got me lookin up high  
You got me searchin down low  
You got me I know you know  
You got me jerkin back n forth  
You told me people like to suffer  
You told me thats the way it is  
You said that things were getting better  
You said I should expect all this  
You think its funny  
But what I say is true  
The reason that I live like this  
Is all because of you  
There is a thought that keeps me thinking  
Like a stone inside my shoe  
It is a vision reoccurring  
A dirty window I can see you through
