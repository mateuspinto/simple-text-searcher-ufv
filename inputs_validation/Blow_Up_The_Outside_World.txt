Nothing seems to kill me no matter how hard I try  
Nothing is closing my eyes  
Nothing can beat me down for your pain or delight  
And nothing seems to break me  
No matter how hard I fall nothing can break me at all  
Not one for giving up though not invincible I know  
  
Ive givin everything I need  
Id give you everything I own  
Id give in if it could at least be ours alone  
Ive given everything I could  
To blow it to hell and gone  
Burrow down in and  
Blow up the outside world  
  
Someone tried to tell me something  
Dont let the world get you down  
Nothing will do me in before I do myself  
So save it for your own and the ones you can help  
  
Want to make it understood  
Wanting though I never would  
Trying though I know its wrong  
Blowing it to hell and gone  
Wishing though I never could  
Blow up the outside world
