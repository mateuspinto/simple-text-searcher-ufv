Looking in your eyes  
Kind of heaven eyes  
Closing both my eyes  
Waiting for surprise  
To see the heaven in your eyes is not so far  
Cause Im not afraid to try and go it  
To know the love and the beauty never known before  
Ill leave it up to you to show it  
  
And golden lady golden lady  
Id like to go there  
Golden lady golden lady  
Id like to go there  
Take me right away  
  
Looking at your hands  
Hands can understand  
Waiting for the chance  
Just to hold your hand  
  
A touch of rain and sunshine made the flower grow  
Into a lovely smile thats blooming  
And its so clear to me that youre a dream come true  
Theres no way that Ill be losing  
  
And golden lady golden lady  
Id like to go there  
Golden lady golden lady  
Id like to go there  
Take me right away  
  
A touch of rain and sunshine made the flower grow  
Into a lovely smile thats blooming  
And its so clear to me that your my dream come true  
There is no way that Ill be losing  
  
Golden lady golden lady  
Id like to go there  
Golden lady golden lady  
Id like to go there
