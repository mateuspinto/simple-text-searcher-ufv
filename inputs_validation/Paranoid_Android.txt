Please could you stop the noise  
Im trying to get some rest  
From all the unborn chicken voices in my head  
Whats that  
Whats that  
  
When I am king you will be first against the wall  
With your opinion which is of no consequence at all  
Whats that  
Whats that  
  
Ambition makes you look pretty ugly  
Kicking and squealing Gucci little piggy  
You dont remember  
You dont remember  
Why dont you remember my name  
Off with his head man  
Off with his head man  
Why dont you remember my name  
I guess he does  
  
Rain down rain down  
Come on rain down on me  
From a great height  
From a great height height  
Rain down rain down  
Come on rain down on me  
From a great height  
From a great height height  
Rain down rain down  
Come on rain down on me  
  
Thats it sir  
Youre leaving  
The crackle of pigskin  
The dust and the screaming  
The yuppies networking  
The panic the vomit  
The panic the vomit  
God loves his children  
God loves his children yeah
