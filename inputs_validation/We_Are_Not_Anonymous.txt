A toast for our sins  
Our instincts drags us deeper  
Throwing us to the wolves  
The nameless were all buried long ago  
We are not anonymous  
The faceless burials are over  
They can see us now  
The fines of freedom  Redrawn  
Held to our curse  
We are not anonymous  
Not alone  
We bound to bear this cross  
A place for our dreams  
What better way to plant the seeds  
Of watch reign and rule  
The nameless were buried long ago  
We are not anonymous  
The faceless burials are over
