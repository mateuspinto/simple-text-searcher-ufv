Take me back to an easy life  
Robin Hood and Marian  
A lone ranger on a silver horse  
Make believe in a box of sand  
Bang bang we all fall down  
Just about dinner time  
Im eatin bullets Come on Fury  take me for a ride  
Rocking Horse Rocking Horse  
Rocking Horse Rocking Horse  
Sun down with a chorus girl  
Ragtime and whiskey pour  
Midnight in a rented room  
With a key inside the bedroom door  
Bang bang we all fall down  
Just about out of my mind  
Come on Lily Come on honey  take me for a ride  
Rocking Horse Rocking Horse  
Rocking Horse Rocking Horse  
Last chance for an easy life  
Double down and let it ride  
Lone ranger with a silver bullet  
For the one arm man inside  
Bang bang we all fall down  
Just about run out of time  
Come on seven Come on eleven  take me for a ride  
Rocking Horse Rocking Horse  
Rocking Horse Rocking Horse
