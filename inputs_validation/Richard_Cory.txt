They say that Richard Cory owns one half of this whole town  
With political connections to spread his wealth around  
Born into society a bankers only child  
He had everything a man could want power grace and style  
But I work in his factory and I curse the life Im living  
And I curse my poverty and I wish that I could be  
Oh I wish that I could be Oh I wish that I could be Richard Cory  
  
The papers print his picture almost everywhere he goes  
Richard Cory at the opera Richard Cory at a show  
And the rumor of his parties and the orgies on his yacht  
Oh he surely must be happy with everything hes got  
But I work in his factory and I curse the life Im living  
And I curse my poverty and I wish that I could be  
Oh I wish that I could be Oh I wish that I could be Richard Cory  
  
He freely gave to charity he had the common touch  
And they were grateful for his patronage and they thanked him very much  
So my mind was filled with wonder when the evening headlines read  
Richard Cory went home last night and put a bullet through his head  
But I work in his factory and I curse the life Im living  
And I curse my poverty and I wish that I could be  
Oh I wish that I could be Oh I wish that I could be Richard Cory
