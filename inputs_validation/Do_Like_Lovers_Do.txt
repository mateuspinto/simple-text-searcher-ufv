Weve been to the movies once or twice  
Had a candlelight dinner baby  
That was oh so nice  
I enjoy all the times at the fair  
And walking hand in hand on the beach  
With the wind in my hair  
  
Oh I really like all the things you do  
But right about now my bodys calling you  
It seems like it seems like  
Its time to put all of that to the side  
Theres a time and place for everything  
And at this time all I ask you bring is yourself  
Cos tonight is just for you and me  
I want you to  
  
Let the night wind down baby  
Fall into my groove  
And meet me at my house  
To do like true lovers do  
I want you to  
Let the night wind down baby  
Fall into my groove  
And meet me at my house  
To do like true lovers do  
  
When you come through my doors  
Take off your clothes  
I aint got all mine baby  
So you wont need yours  
The places Ima take you  
You wont be needing them  
So lets stop all this talking  
And let the party begin  
  
Oh I really like all the things you do  
But right about now my bodys calling you  
It seems like it seems like  
Its time to put all of that to the side  
Theres a time and place for everything  
And at this time all I ask you bring is yourself  
Cos tonight is just for you and me  
I want you to  
  
Let the night wind down baby  
Fall into my groove  
And meet me at my house  
To do like true lovers do  
I want you to  
Let the night wind down baby  
Fall into my groove  
And meet me at my house  
To do like true lovers do  
  
Let me show you how to love me  
Let me show you where to touch me  
Let me show you how to groove me  
Let me show you how to love me  
Let me show you where to touch me  
Let me show you how to groove me
