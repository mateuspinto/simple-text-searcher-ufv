This aint for the good girls gone bad  
This ones for the bad girls tryna go good  
  
Chorus  
How can someone like me so bad just touch a good girl  
Touch a good girl youre a good girl  
And I know that I dont treat you like I should girl  
Like I could girl like my good girl  
  
Here I go again on my shit again  
Walking through the mall acting like a prick again  
You had a halter top I had my Famous socks  
You came to shop I came to ho hop  
You had your girl with you both looking great  
I wanted both of yall how bout a double take  
She was hating looking at me like a scumbag  
But something made you wanna turn around and come back  
Probably cause I just dont give a fuck  
I just wanna see one of these hookas in my truck  
So tell your girlfriend tough luck  
She just wanna see you with somebody dressed up well  
I really aint into that type of shit  
Im into tattoos drink til six  
Fuck until nine sleep until twelve  
And going back to my homies with a story to tell  
  
Chorus  
  
This shit shouldve been finished  
Im as surprised as you are that you still let me in it  
But you continue to text message me  
Right after saying that we should move separately  
But you dont wanna see me go  
Even though Ive only given you dick and cold cereal  
So you must have a thing for Lucky Charms  
Or the bad girl in you just fell in my lucky arms  
You love to cuss me out and call me crazy  
Say Im no good and all of your friends hate me  
Then you show up to my room and damn near rape me  
And then it goes from fuck you to fuck me baby  
You leave early so nobody sees you out the spot  
Now you stuck between a hard place and a rock  
You call me a player but I have lied to you not  
Cause Im not a player I just crush a lot holler  
  
Chorus  
  
Im in jail again on my Johnny Cash  
Some dude was talking shit I had to whoop his ass  
Called you in the morning and you just fucking laughed  
You think this cute you love my crazy ass  
And I wonder if youll ever leave my side  
Cause the more that I ignore you the more you wanna ride  
I tell you that Im bad but you never ask why  
Cause you just want the good from a really bad guy  
You wanna rock lets rock and roll just know  
Im only good at one thing and thats not control  
But I am consistent thats something to be proud of  
Cause I aint shit with you and I aint shit without you  
  
Chorus  
  
To all the bad girls trying to go good  
No such thing as a good girl gone bad  
Just a bunch of bad girls tryna go good  
Holler at me mane  
Hello my name is Yelawolf  
Im a sex addict its a disease  
Theres medication for it and everything  
I take pills
