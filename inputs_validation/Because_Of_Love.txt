Because of love he left his throne  
And made this earth his home  
He did it willingly  
For you and me  
With heaven left behind  
He came to save all mankind  
From sin and shame  
He could have walked away  
But instead he chose  
To stay upon that tree  
And take a crown of thorns for me  
Because of love  
Because of love he bore my pain bore my pain  
Shouldering the blame  
Why did he chose to go he didnt have to go no  
How could he love me so  
Because of love he called to me  
He said child I will set you free  
Youll have life abundantly  
Because of love because of love  
He gave unselfishly  
Caused my blinded to eyes to see  
It was you and me he had in mind  
On the road to Calvary  
I never known such a perfect love  
I had fallen down but he picked me up  
He rescued my soul  
Now I want the world to know  
Because of love he left the grave  
Prepared for us a place  
Hell back again someday  
And I will hear him say  
Because you believed  
Youll live eternally  
And Ill fall on my knees  
And I will cry  
You are holy holy lord god almighty  
You are worthy to receive glory  
Honor and power forever  
Holy holy lord god Almighty  
You are worthy  
To receive glory  
Honor and power forever  
Amen Aamen oh Aamen  
Amen  
Holy holy holy  
Holy holy holy  
Holy holy holy  
Jesus you are  
The angels bow down and say  
Holy holy holy  
All creation cries out  
Holy holy holy  
Youre worthy of all the glory  
Forever  
Amen
