Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity  
Calculate what we will or will not tolerate  
Desperate to control all and everything  
Unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen  
  
Clutch it like a cornerstone Otherwise it all comes down  
Justify denials and grip em to the lonesome end  
Clutch it like a cornerstone Otherwise it all comes down  
Terrified of being wrong Ultimatum prison cell  
  
Saturn ascends choose one or ten Hang on or be humbled again  
  
Clutch it like a cornerstone Otherwise it all comes down  
Justify denials and grip em to the lonesome end  
Saturn ascends comes round again  
Saturn ascends the one the ten Ignorant to the damage done  
  
Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity  
Calculate what we will or will not tolerate  
Desperate to control all and everything  
Unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen  
  
Wear the grudge like a crown Desperate to control  
Unable to forgive And were sinking deeper  
  
Defining confining controlling and were sinking deeper  
  
Saturn comes back around to show you everything  
Lets you choose what you will not see and then  
Drags you down like a stone or lifts you up again  
Spits you out like a child light and innocent  
  
Saturn comes back around Lifts you up like a child or  
Drags you down like a stone  
To consume you till you choose to let this go  
  
Give away the stone  
Let the oceans take and trans mutate this cold and fated anchor  
Give away the stone  
Let the waters kiss and trans mutate these leaden grudges into gold  
Let go
