You noticed that I closed my eyes again  
And smiled in all the silence  
I have grown in me for you  
But then what accident of stars  
Brought you so late into my arms  
Where even now another sleeps   
Here in my heart I know that you and I are one  
I wonder if some joker laughs as he looks on  
I wonder if some joker laughs as he looks on  
I wonder if some joker laughs as he looks on  
At all our misplaced love all our misplaced love  
  
You noticed that I turned my head away  
And cried for all the goodness  
I have found deceiving you  
Ah well how could we know the hand  
Fate chose to be our guide was tired  
Of lovers bliss and holding hands  
And deep in my heart I know that you and I are one  
I wonder if some joker sighs for what weve done  
I wonder if some joker sighs for what weve done  
I wonder if some joker sighs for what weve done  
With all our misplaced all our misplaced love  
  
I noticed that you touched my soul in time  
And lied to stop my leaving  
For a place where no one hears  
But then what randomness and chance  
Could move the mountain from our dreams  
Or break the spell upon us now   
And though deep in my heart I know you and I are one  
I wonder if the joker dies what will become  
I wonder if the joker dies what will become  
I wonder if the joker dies what will become  
Of all our misplaced love  
  
All our misplaced love  
All our misplaced
