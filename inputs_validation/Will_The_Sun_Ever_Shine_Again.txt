Rain is pourin down like the  
Heavens are hurtin  
Seems like its been dark since  
The devil knows when  
How do you go on never knowin  
For certain  
Will the sun ever shine again  
  
Fells like its been years since  
It started to thunder  
Clouds are campin out in the valley  
And glen  
How do you go on when you cant help  
But wonder  
Will the sun ever shine again  
  
What if the rain keeps fallin  
What if the sky stays gray  
What if the wind keeps squallin  
And never go away  
  
Maybe the soon the storm will be  
Tired of blowin  
Maybe soon it all will be over amen  
How do you go on if theres no way  
Of knowin  
Will the sun ever shine  
Wish I could say  
Send me a sign  
One little ray  
Lord if youre listenin how long  
Until then  
Will the sun ever shine again
