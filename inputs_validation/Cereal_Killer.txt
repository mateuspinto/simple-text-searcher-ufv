Wake in the morning my mind is all confused  
Dont no where to turn or what to do pour myself  
A great big bowl of crispy bits of rice the cereal  
That talks gives me some advice  
  
Chorus  
My rice krispies told me to kill you tonight  
My rice krispies never lie  
My rice krispies  
  
Told me so many things you see like how the  
Phone company killed kennedy how oprah is an  
Alien and nixon never lied and by tommorow  
Morning you gotta die chorus this morning  
Breakfast message was so crystal clear  
It was so strange I couldnt believe my ears  
  
My cereal informed me your an agent for  
The feds the CIA they want me dead  
  
Chorus  
  
Elvis is alive living in New Jersey  
Thats right they gotta give me a lobotomy  
One day the aliens are gonna come for me  
I gotta kill you if I wanna be free
