Come by me come talk to me baby  
Tell me how we can combine  
Will you be my sunshine forever  
Will you be a friend of mine  
  
Try me out and if you get excited  
Take me home Id love to be invited  
Once were there Im sure youll be delighted  
We can rock all night  
  
Wait and see we might fit together  
That would be my lucky day  
Come by me come love with me baby  
Maybe we could run away
