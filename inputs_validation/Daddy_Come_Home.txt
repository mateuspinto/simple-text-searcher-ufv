A year and a half did not seem like much time  
But its almost forever when youre only nine  
Yes she still adores him and tears fill her eyes  
As she clings to her pillow and cries  
  
Daddy come home oh please Daddy come home  
Sweet Daddy Are you out there somewhere all alone  
Was Mommy mean to you Did I treat you wrong  
Daddy Oh Daddy come home  
  
Out on the coast in a honeymoon sweet  
Someones tossing and turning and trying to sleep  
Was that just the wind in the pines cross the bay  
Or a small voice from so far away  
  
Daddy come home oh please Daddy come home  
Sweet Daddy Are you out there somewhere all alone  
Was Mommy mean to you Did I treat you wrong  
Daddy Oh Daddy come home  
  
Daddy Oh Daddy come home
