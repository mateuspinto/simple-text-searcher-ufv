I want to paint your portrait in bright color  
I want to paint the lines in red and blue  
I want to make your eyes appear like starlings  
Saying Darling I love you  
I want to set your face upon a landscape  
I want to show the love and toil and sweat  
I want to show your beauty like a crystal  
In an allnight launderette  
  
Chorus  
Oh this line is the flat horizon  
And you are the shape on the left  
Oh this line is the flat horizon  
And this is the sun in the sky  
Oh this line is the flat horizon  
And makes the great divide  
Between heaven and angels  
And earth and men  
  
I want to show what lies beneath the surface  
In little squares of purple green and gold  
So everyone can see their own reflection  
In the mirror of your soul  
I want to paint your arrogance and beauty  
I want to paint the way you laugh at me  
I want to paint th world in which I see you  
Fixed for all eternity  
  
Chorus  
  
I want to paint your portrait in bright color  
I want to paint your personality  
I want to show the world just how I see you  
I want to show the world just how I see you  
You know that only I can guarantee you  
Precious Immortality  
Precious Immortality  
  
Chorus
