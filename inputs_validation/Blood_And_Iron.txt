Out for blood take no prisoners  
Out for the kill and looking for donors  
As terror strikes give your life  
We drink your blood a human sacrifice  
  
Ahh Stick in the knife  
Uhh For blood and iron  
Iron  
Blood and iron  
  
Thirst for more our chosen path  
Awake and find the Devils wrath  
All those who dare and those who disobey  
Alone youll find dead as yesterday  
  
Ahh Fight for you life  
For blood and iron  
Iron  
Blood and iron  
  
All right donors Donate  
  
Flesh of steel a legion of donors  
We are one as our blood transfers  
New found power raging through your veins  
Blood metal donors eat the last remains  
  
For blood And iron
