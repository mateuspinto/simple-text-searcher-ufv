Will you be there in the courtyard for the joy  
Will your honor be avenged with justice done  
When they cover my head over for the joy  
Will you hide your face in shame for what youve done  
  
You were alway wild and reckless Barbara dear  
But I worshiped you my love was like a fire  
And your wedding was the high spot of the whole year  
But your marriage left so much to be desired  
  
Saying that you are were willing Barbara Joy  
The face youre showing gives away your sin  
All your hopes of money cant retore your pride  
Maybe you were willin dont let me die  
  
When the phone rang in the middle of the night  
Your tender voice was shaking with alarm  
So without a thought I hurried to your side  
Always seeking to protect you from all harm  
  
You threw your arms around me it was like a dream  
And what we knew was bound to happen did  
Then the doorway framed your husband and I heard you scream  
Unless you speak tomorrow Ill be dead  
  
Saying that you are were willing Barbara Joy  
The face youre showing gives away your sin  
All your hopes of money cant retore your pride  
Maybe you were willin dont let me die
