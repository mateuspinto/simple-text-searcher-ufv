I want to learn how to fly  
I want to be respected  
I want to get lucky  
I want to get out of this dump  
I just want to watch TV  
I want to be loved  
I want to be different  
I want a brother and sister  
Id just rather be forgotten  
I want to save the world  
I want to be understood  
I want to be rich  
Man I just want to be somebody  
  
Julies got the word today  
She lost her job just one last pay  
Life dont come easy anymore  
Still strugglin on by herself  
Got a picture of Jimmy  
There on the shelf  
And she looks at him and says  
Why did we let it go  
  
I know that sometimes baby  
We didnt see things eyetoeye  
But I got just one question  
Did we have to say goodbye  
  
Just like prisoners in paradise  
Still far from heavens door  
We had it all but still we  
Wanted more  
Now I realize that I cant  
Turn back the futures here  
To stay but hey  
Were just children of tomorrow  
Hangin on to yesterday  
  
Jimmy still recalls the night  
When he took his guitar  
And headed on out  
To find the big time  
That was his dream  
He gave up his past  
And made it alright  
But theres something missin  
In his heart tonight  
Sometimes what you want  
Aint what you need  
  
He misses drivin down  
To the lake at night  
Holdin his baby  
In his arms so tight  
Aint it hard to find illusions  
When youre livin in a memory  
  
Just like prisoners in paradise  
So close but yet so far  
There will come a time  
No matter who you are  
When you ask yourself  
Was it right or wrong  
For me to turn away but hey  
Were just children of tomorrow  
Hangin on to yesterday
