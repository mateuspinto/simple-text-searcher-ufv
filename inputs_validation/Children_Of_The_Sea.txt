In the misty morning on the edge of time  
Weve lost the rising sun a final sign  
As the misty morning rolls away to die  
Reaching for the stars we blind the sky  
  
We sailed across the air before we learned to fly  
We thought that it could never end  
Wed glide above the ground before we learned to run run  
Now it seems our world has come undone  
  
Oh they say that its over  
And it just had to be  
Ooh they say that its over  
Were lost children of the sea oh  
  
We made the mountains shake with laughter as we played  
Hiding in our corner of the world  
Then we did the demon dance and rushed to nevermore  
Threw away the key and locked the door  
  
Oh they say that its over yeah  
And it just had to be  
Yes they say that its over  
Were lost children of the sea  
  
In the misty morning on the edge of time  
Weve lost the rising sun a final sign  
As the misty morning rolls away to die  
Reaching for the stars we blind the sky  
  
Oh they say that its over yeah  
And it just had to be  
Oh they say that its over  
Poor lost children of the sea yeah  
  
Look out The sky is falling down  
Look out The world is spinning round and round and round  
Look out The sun is going black black  
Look out Its never never never coming back look out
