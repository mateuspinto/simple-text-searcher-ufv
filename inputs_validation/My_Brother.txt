My brother  
If you could cast a little light on someone  
Its not too soon  
You took me halfway round the world  
Im running out of time and reasons  
My true friend  
If you could tell me what it is that keeps you  
From coming down  
You left me way up in the clouds  
The higher you fly the less I see you  
So far  
Cross a wild and windy sea  
So far  
That our voices are  
Divided by an ocean an ocean  
My brother  
If you could take a little time to slow down  
Its more your style  
It takes a lifetime to decide  
Im running out of time and reasons  
Im running out Im running out  
So far  
Cross a wild and windy sea  
So far  
That our voices are  
Divided by an ocean an ocean
