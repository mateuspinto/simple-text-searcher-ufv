Did you ever feel the pain  
That he felt upon the cross  
Did you ever feel the knife  
Tearing flesh thats oh so soft  
  
Did you ever touch the night  
Did you ever count the cost  
Do you hide away the fear  
Put down paradise as lost  
  
Yeah youre blinded by rainbows  
Watching the wind blow  
Blinded by rainbows  
Do you dream at night  
Do you sleep at night  
I doubt it  
  
Did you ever feel the blast  
As the semtex bomb goes off  
Do you ever hear the screams  
As the limbs are all torn off  
Did you ever kiss the child  
Who just saw his father shot  
Do you ever shed a tear  
As the war drags on and on  
  
Do you ever touch the night  
Or is it just another job  
Do you feel the final hours  
Put down paradise as lost  
  
Yeah youre blinded by rainbows  
And faces in windows  
Blinded by rainbows  
Do you dream at night  
Do you sleep at night  
I doubt it  
  
Do you ever fear the night  
Could it be the war is lost  
Do you fear the final hour  
Do you kneel before the cross  
  
Youre blinded by rainbows  
And watching the wind blow  
Blinded by rainbows  
Do you dream at night  
Do you scream at night  
Do you smell of fear  
Is your conscience clear  
Are you caked in sweat  
  
Are your clothes all wet  
Do you see the light  
Is the end in sight  
See the face of Christ  
Enter paradise  
I doubt it
