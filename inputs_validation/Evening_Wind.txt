A summer day is gone  
Listen to the evening wind  
Singing tunes of tel aviv  
Into the setting sun  
You lie in twilight sleep  
Dreaming colors deep  
Today all life is gone  
  
Look at the golden chalice  
Flag broken on the ground  
Ringing fire blazing round  
Where are your friends  
You see all hope  
Lying broken on a slope  
Today all life is gone  
  
Have you ever listened to the evening wind  
To the  and it through  
Have a listen and you will see my friends  
Wind is telling you the truth
