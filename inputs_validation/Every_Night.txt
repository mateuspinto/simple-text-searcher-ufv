Every night I just want to go out  
Get out of my head  
Every day I dont want to get up  
Get out of my bed  
Every night I want to play out  
And every day I want to do ooh ooh oh oh  
But tonight I just want to stay in  
And be with you  
And be with you  
  
Ooh  
Ooh  
Believe me mama  
  
Every day I lean on a lamp post  
Im wasting my time  
Every day I lay on a pillow  
Im resting my mind  
Every morning brings a new day  
Every night that day is through  
Ooh ooh oh oh  
But tonight I just want to stay in  
And be with you  
And be with you  
  
Ooh  
Ooh  
Believe me mama ooh  
Ooh
