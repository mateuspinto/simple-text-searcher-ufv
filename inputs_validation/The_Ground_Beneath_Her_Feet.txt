All my life I worshiped her  
Her golden voice her beautys beat  
How she made us feel how she made me real  
And the ground beneath her feet  
And the ground beneath her feet  
  
And now I cant be sure of anything  
Black is white and cold is heat  
For what I worshiped stole my love away  
It was the ground beneath her feet  
It was the ground beneath her feet  
  
Go lightly down your darkened way  
Go lightly underground  
Ill be down there in another day  
I wont rest until youre found  
  
Let me love you let me rescue you  
Let me bring you where two roads meet  
Oh come back above where there is only love  
Only love  
  
My oh my my oh my  
My oh my my oh my  
My oh my my oh my  
My oh my my oh my  
My oh my my oh my  
  
Let me love you true let me rescue you  
Let me bring you to where two roads meet  
  
Let me love you true let me rescue you  
Let me bring you to where two roads meet  
  
My oh my my oh my  
My oh my my oh my  
My oh my my oh my
