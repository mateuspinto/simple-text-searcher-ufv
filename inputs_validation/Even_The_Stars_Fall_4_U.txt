I couldnt bring myself to take you home  
Ive got you out here all alone  
And even this old drunken mind  
Still right here tonight  
  
Yellow fireflies in the field  
Think I know the way I feel  
At the corner of my eye  
Did you see that  
  
Chorus  
Every star up in the sky  
Has got your name on it tonight  
And they dont stand a chance like I know I dont  
And girl you cant tell me that you cant see  
The kind of spell you put on me  
You gotta know just what you do  
Even the stars fall for you  
Even the stars fall for you  
  
So make a wish and make it fast  
I just want this thing to last  
Cause heaven knows its falling hard  
And Im not the only one  
  
Chorus  
Every star up in the sky  
Has got your name on it tonight  
And they dont stand a chance like I know I dont  
And girl you cant tell me that you cant see  
The kind of spell you put on me  
You gotta know just what you do  
Even the stars fall for you  
  
I never counted on your touch  
Making me want you so much  
I never dreamed of your sweet lips  
Could make me feel like this  
Nothing like this  
  
Chorus  
Every star up in the sky  
Has got your name on it tonight  
And they dont stand a chance like I know I dont  
And girl you cant tell me that you cant see  
The kind of spell you put on me  
Cause you gotta know just what you do  
Even the stars fall for you  
Even the stars fall for you  
Even the stars fall for you
