I feel you your sun it shines  
I feel you within my mind  
You take me there you take me where the kingdom comes  
You take me to and lead me through Babylon  
  
This is the morning of our love  
Its just the dawning of our love  
  
I feel you your heart it sings  
I feel you the joy it brings  
Where heaven waits those golden gates and back again  
You take me to you lead me through oblivion  
  
This is the morning of our love  
Its just the dawning of our love  
I feel you your precious soul and I am whole  
I feel you your rising sun my kingdom comes  
  
I feel you each move you make  
I feel you each breath you take  
Where angels sing and spread their wings my loves on high  
You take me home to glorys throne by and by  
  
This is the morning of our love  
Its just the dawning of our love  
This is the morning of our love  
Its just the dawning of our love
