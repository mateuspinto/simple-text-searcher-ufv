Lead vocal the flying pickets  
  
Weve come so far  
To hear the words  
Of hope and consolation  
With no star to guide us through the night  
  
Through many realms of fantasy  
We wander and we roam  
Far away from home  
  
Then all of those  
We held so dear  
Grew tired of understanding  
And we dream through the endless night alone  
What sun can light this darkness  
And what hand remove this stone  
  
Far away far away  
Like a leaf that the wind has blown  
Far away far away  
Far away from home  
Far away from home  
  
All that I am  
What Ive become  
Will I ever find my place in the sun  
  
What sun can light this darkness  
And what hand remove this stone  
  
Far away far away  
Will I ever find my place in the sun  
Far away  
  
I could be happy then  
Far away  
Ill find jerusalem  
Far away from home  
Far away from home
