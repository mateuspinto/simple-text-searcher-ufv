Seems like once upon a time ago  
I was where I was supposed to be  
My vision was true and my heart was too  
There was no end to what I could dream  
I walked like a hero into the setting sun  
Everyone called out my name  
Death to me was just a mystery  
I was too busy raising up Cain  
  
But nothing lasts forever  
Your best efforts dont always pay  
Sometimes you get sick  
And dont get better  
Thats when life is short  
Even in its longest days  
  
So you pretend not to notice  
That everything has changed  
The way that you look  
And the friends you once had  
So you keep on acting the same  
But deep down in your soul  
You know you you got no flame  
And who knows then which way to go  
Life is short even in its longest days  
  
All I got here  
Is a rear view mirror  
Reflections of where Ive been  
So you tell yourself Ill be back up on top some day  
But you know theres nothing waiting up there for you anyway  
  
Nothing lasts forever  
And your best efforts dont always pay  
Sometimes you get sick  
And you dont get better  
Thats when life is short  
Even in its longest days  
  
Life is short  
Even in its longest days
