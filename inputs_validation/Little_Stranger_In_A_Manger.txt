Little stranger in a manger little stranger sweet and mild  
Mother Mary daddy Joseph watch oer you their holy child  
Searching for you to adore you come Three Kings led by a star  
Little stranger in a manger theyll find heaven where you are  
Choir of angels are singing this night of your birth  
Praise and glory to the highest in a stable on earth  
Humble shepherds filled will wonder kneel and pray by lanthern light  
Little stranger in a manger bless our soul this holy night  
Choir of angels are singing this night of your birth  
Praise and glory to the highest little stranger here on earth  
Humble shepherds filled will wonder  
Little stranger here on earth
