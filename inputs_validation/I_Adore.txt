The universe is at Your feet  
Gives You praise  
Evermore  
The stars will light the sky for You  
Always  
God be praised  
And we sing  
The Lord is on high  
The Lord is on high  
  
I adore You  
I adore You  
And theres none that compares  
To Your majesty O Lord  
I adore You  
I adore You  
And I stand  
In wonder of Your love  
  
We will crown You  
King forever  
Living Saviour  
Jesus Redeemer  
Lord of Heaven  
Robed in majesty  
Crowned in glory  
Creation adores You  
  
Holy Holy  
God almighty  
And forever the Lord is exalted  
Hear the angels  
Shout His anthem  
Everliving  
God we adore You
