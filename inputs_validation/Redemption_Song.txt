Old pirates yes they rob I  
Sold I to the merchant ships  
Minutes after they took I  
From the bottomless pit  
But my hand was made strong  
By the hand of the almighty  
We forward in this generation  
Triumphantly  
Wont you help to sing  
These songs of freedom  
Cause all I ever had  
Redemption songs  
  
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery  
None but ourselves can free our minds  
Have no fear for atomic energy  
Cause none of them are gonna stop the time  
How long must they kill our prophets  
While we stand aside and look  
Some say its just a part of it  
Weve got to fulfill the book  
  
Wont you help to sing  
These songs of freedom  
Cause all I ever had  
Redemption songs  
Redemption songs  
Redemption songs
