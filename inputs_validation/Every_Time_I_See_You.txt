Performed by The Heartbreakers  
  
Every time I see you  
Whenever you walk by  
I want to hold you  
Darling please let me try  
Darling I love you  
I really do  
Darling I want you  
Let me be true  
I want to hold  
Every time I see you  
  
If you would love me  
Wed never never part  
We would be lovers  
Heart unto heart  
Darling I love you  
I really do  
Darling I want you  
Let me be true  
I want to hold you  
Every time I see you
