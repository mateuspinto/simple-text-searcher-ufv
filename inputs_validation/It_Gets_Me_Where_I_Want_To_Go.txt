It gets me where I want to go  
  
It gets me where I wanna go  
A ride around the world  
Just around the corner  
In his eyes  
It gets me where I wanna go  
A vision of my day dreams  
About what the good life means  
In my eyes  
Too many sad eyes are open for me now  
Too many dreams of life  
Dissolved and into dust  
Too many moments lost  
The price aint worth the cost  
Too many wasted thoughts of loving  
And leaving you  
Taste of life I have with you  
It gets me where I wanna go  
A ride around the world  
Just around the corner  
In his eyes  
In his eyes  
In his eyes
