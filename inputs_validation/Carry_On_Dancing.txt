The moonlight  
Shines down interstellar beams  
And the groove tonight  
Is something more than youve ever seen  
The stars and planets taking shape  
A stolen kiss has come too late  
  
In the moonlight  
Carry on keep romancing  
Carry on carry on dancing  
In the moonlight  
Carry on keep romancing  
Carry on carry on dancing  
  
Youre never safe till you see the dawn  
And if the clock strikes past midnight  
The hope is gone  
To move under  
  
The moonlight  
Carry on keep romancing  
Carry on carry on dancing  
In the moonlight  
Carry on keep romancing  
Carry on carry on dancing  
  
Move Closer Passion Stronger  
  
Theres a magic only two can tell  
In the dark night  
Ultraviolet is a wicked spell  
The stars and planets taking shape  
A stolen kiss has come too late  
  
In the moonlight  
Carry on keep romancing  
Carry on carry on dancing  
In the moonlight  
Carry on keep romancing  
Carry on carry on dancing  
  
Moving on  
Moving all night
