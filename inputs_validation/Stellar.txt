Meet me in outer space  
We could spend the night  
Watch the earth come up  
Ive grown tired of that place  
Wont you come with me  
We could start again  
  
How do you do it  
Make me feel like I do  
How do you do it  
Its better than I ever knew  
  
Meet me in outer space  
I will hold you close  
If youre afraid of heights  
I need you to see this place  
It might be the only way  
That I can show you how it feels to be inside of you  
  
How do you do it  
Make me feel like I do  
How do you do it  
Its better than I ever knew  
You are stellar
