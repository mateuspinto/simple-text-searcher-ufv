A little later in the day Mother and the Doctor went away  
They left me lying on the floor  
Heading for local church no a trace of guilt in their eyes  
The reverend Sammael the venom of GOD himself  
And so easy to convert  
  
Conspiracy Im being victimized again  
  
Knocking at the preachers door  
none of them were ever here before  
Sammael GOD in his eyes leads them into the silent room  
Oh such a holy gloom  
  
Priest do You remember King the loony one  
the one who killed his Grandma up on the hill  
Yes I do  
  
Conspiracy  
  
Now hes back the loony one  
  
Talking to the preacher for a while  
the Doctor turned him into a child  
Sammael GOD in his eyes swallowed everything the Doctor said  
Oh in the gloom of the night  
  
From what You tell Me we cannot save him  
It could be Satan himselfg or some evil demon  
Let us not waste any time the demon might twist our minds  
We must go and do what must be done  
  
Conspiracy I am being victimized againvictimized  
  
So they left the church conspiracy of the cursed  
Through the dark and the rain the priest was mildly insane  
A crucifix in his handOh no  
  
Soon the house belongs to us My dear  
and King will be gone forever isnt it just heaven
