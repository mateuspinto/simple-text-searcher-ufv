Youll no I be rockin da latsest fashions  
from fendi to parasucco I donT know Y yall even askin  
its nuttin new bout da way I roll its nuttin new bout da way I roll  
  
Plus da lyrics I spit you no day be otta control  
I give em no choice cuz itz all eyez on me  
when I pull up in my rolls royce  
I no people wan hate  
cuz when it comes down to style I makes no mistakes  
everything bout me is classy and sopisticated  
and donT get made at me if Im well educated  
I donT let jealousy get in da way of my fame  
every thing bout me is thorough  
but at the same time nothing bout me remains the same  
Im always dropin something new on you cats  
its hard for yall to keep up wit me  
and stay on the right track  
no slipin outta line if you gone roll wit me  
cuz this chick right hea plays no games as you can see
