Flying through the sky  
His true love waits  
Lonely times gone by  
Theres a problem at the border  
He learns they wont let him through  
She was standing in the rain  
She waits in vain for you  
She was standing in the rain  
She knows her love will pull her through  
Immigration law must be obeyed  
Close the case return another day  
On the phone he tries to tell her  
He must go without a single word  
She was standing in the rain  
She waits in vain for you  
She was standing in the rain  
She knows her love will pull her through  
Taking to the cloudy skies again  
The city lights shimmer on the plane  
In his eyes he sees the sadness  
For his love will always be the same  
She was standing in the rain  
She waits in vain for you  
She was standing in the rain  
She knows her love will pull her through
