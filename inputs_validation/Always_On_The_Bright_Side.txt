You are like a wish come true Im counting on you  
Through two shipwrecked eyes I come to see  
Everything I had to give has been given to you  
Baby thats the way it all should be  
Always on the bright side  
Keeps it kind of light  
That girl gets friendlier each day  
  
Love alone will keep me breathing all through the night  
In that quiet place where dreams abide  
You and I together are a bit of all right  
Feeling good is how we whish to be  
  
Always on the bright side  
Always out of sight  
Nesting like two eagles in the trees  
  
Always on the bright side  
Keeps it kind of light  
That girl gets friendlier each day  
  
Always on the bright side  
Always out of sight  
Nesting like two eagles in the trees
