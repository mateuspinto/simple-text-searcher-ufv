The plot begins with you  
And me in darklit rooms  
Your cigarette cuts through  
I wear it like perfume  
  
The melody gives way  
We silently behave  
The story never read  
Is torn up into shreds  
I see it in your eyes  
The invitation lies  
But pages left to turn  
Our chapters we should burn  
  
The melody gives way  
We silently behave  
The story never read  
Is torn up into shreds  
  
I see it in your eyes  
The invitation lies  
But pages left to turn  
Our chapters we should burn
