I get the same old dreams same time every night  
Fall to the ground and I wake up  
So I get out of bed put on my shoes and in my head  
Thoughts fly back to the breakup  
  
These four wall are closing in  
Look at the fix you put me in  
  
Since you been gone  
Since you been gone  
Im out of my head cant take it  
Could I be wrong  
But since you been gone  
You cast your spell so break it  
Ohoh ohoh ohoh  
Since you been gone  
  
So in the night I stand beneath the backstreet light  
I read the words that you sent to me  
I can take the afternoon the night time comes around  
too soon  
You cant know what you mean to me  
  
Your poison letter your telegram  
Just goes to show you dont give a damn  
  
Since you been gone  
Since you been gone  
Im out of my head cant take it  
Could I be wrong  
But since you been gone  
You cast your spell so break it  
Ohoh ohoh ohoh  
Since you been gone  
  
If you will come back  
Baby you know youll never do wrong  
  
Since you been gone  
Since you been gone  
Im out of my head cant take it  
Could I be wrong  
But since you been gone  
You cast your spell so break it  
Ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh  
Ever since you been gone  
  
Since you been gone  
Since you been gone  
Im out of my head cant take it  
Since you been gone  
Since you been gone  
Im out of my head cant take it
