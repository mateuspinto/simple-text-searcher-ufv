Lord his Daddy was an honest man just a red dirt Georgia farmer  
His momma lived her short life having kids and baling hay  
He had fifteen years and an ache inside to wander  
So he hop a freight at Waycross and wound up in LA  
Well the cold nights had no pity on that Waycross Georgia farm boy  
Most days he went hungry then the summer came  
He met a girl known on the strip San Franciscos Mabel Joy  
Destitutions child born on an LA street called Shame  
Growing up came quietly in the arms of Mabel Joy  
Laughter found their mornings to be the meaning to his life  
Now the night before she left  
Sleep came and left that Waycross country boy  
With dreams of Georgia cotton and a California wife  
Sunday morning found him standing neath the red light at her door  
A right cross sent him reeling put him face down on the floor  
In place of Mabel Joy he found a merchant mad marine  
Growled Your Georgia neck is red Sonny youre still green  
So he turned twentyone in a gray rock federal prison  
That old judge had no mercy on that Waycross Georgia boy  
Staring at those four gray walls in silence learning listen  
Midnight freight he knew could take him back to Mabel Joy  
Sunday morning found him lying neath the red light at her door  
With a bullet in his side he cried Have you seen Mabel Joy  
Stunned and shaken someone said Son she dont live here no more  
Nor she left this house four years today they say shes looking for  
Some Georgia farm boy
