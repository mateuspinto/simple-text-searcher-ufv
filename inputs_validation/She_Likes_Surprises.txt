Girlie dress and making her best  
She makes up her hair for the 90s  
Dirty shoes and hiding her blues  
Shes dying to lose what shes finding  
  
So easy to leave it or take it in stride  
So easy to read when shes faking her smile  
She likes surprises she likes surprises  
Anything in colorful disguises  
  
Lips and thighs abused by our eyes  
Acting surprised that she likes it  
Chocolate cream an amphetamine  
Torn at the seams shes crying  
  
So easy to leave it or take it in stride  
So easy to read when shes faking her smile  
She likes surprises she likes surprises  
Anything in colorful disguises  
  
She gets a little I guess  
She gets it more or less  
She likes surprises  
Anything in colorful disguises  
  
So easy to leave it or take it in stride  
So easy to read when shes faking her smile  
She like surprises she likes surprises  
Anything in colorful disguises
