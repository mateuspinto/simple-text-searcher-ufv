No good boys ever go to heaven  
Bodies moving wunderland  
Open mouth kiss and we dance  
I cant believe cccant cant believe that I met you  
  
Pink champagne  
Merry balls spin round again  
In this wunderland where I met you  
  
So dj play  
Let the record spin again  
In this wunderland where I met you  
  
1 2 3 4 5 6 7  
Hold your breath and count to eleven  
Music music music music  
Bodies moving wunderland  
Open mouth kiss and we dance  
I cant believe cccant cant believe how I met you  
  
Pink champagne  
Merry balls spin round again  
In this wunderland where I met you  
  
So dj play  
Let the record spin again  
In this wunderland where I met you
