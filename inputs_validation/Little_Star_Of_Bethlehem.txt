Little star of Bethlehem  
Perfect as a pearl  
Waiting for our eyes to turn  
And our faith to unfurl  
How I pray that you will cast  
Your light upon the world  
Shine on  
Flame of peace  
Flame of hope  
Oh help us believe  
Those who wait with hungry hearts  
Clinging to despair  
Those whose souls are bound in chains  
The lonely everywhere  
Show them that we hear their cry  
Show them that we care  
Shine on  
Flame of peace  
Flame of hope  
Oh help us believe  
From the west  
To the east  
Shine on us  
We shall be released
