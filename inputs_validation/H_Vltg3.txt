Sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes  
  
Hybrid  
Ive been diggin in crates ever since I was livin in space  
Before the rat race before monkeys had human traits  
I mastered numerology big band theology performed lobotomies with
telekanetic psychology  
Invented the mic to so I can start blessin it  
Chincheckin kids to make my point like an impressionist  
Many men have tried to shake us  
But I twist mic chords like double helixes to show them what Im made of  
I buckle knees like leg braces cast a spell of instrumentalist on all of you
MCs who hate us  
So you can try on leave you without a shoulder to cry on  
From now to infinite let icon be bygones  
I fire bombs ghostly notes haunt this  
I tried threats but moved on to a promise  
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice  
And run the guantlett with whoever that wants this  
  
High voltage  
This is the unforgettable sound  
High voltage  
Bringin you up and takin you down  
High voltage  
Comin at you from every side  
High voltage  
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide  
  
Akira Ive put a kink in the backbones of clones with microphones  
Never satisfied my rhymes jones  
Spraying bright day over what you might say  
My blood types krylon Technicolor type A  
On highways write with road rage  
Cages a win cages a tin that bounce all around  
Surround sound  
Devouring the scenes  
Subliminal gangrene paintings over all the same things  
Sing songs karaoke copy bullshit  
Break bones verbally with sticks and stones tactics  
Forth dimension compact convention  
Write rhymes with ease while the track stands at attention  
Ment to put you away with the pencil  
Pistol official sixteen line a rhyme missile  
While you risk your all  
I pick out at your flaws  
Spitting rah blah blah blah you can say you saw  
  
High voltage  
This is the unforgettable sound  
High voltage  
Bringin you up and takin you down  
High voltage  
Comin at you from every side  
High voltage  
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide  
High voltage  
This is the unforgettable sound  
High voltage  
Bringin you up and takin you down  
High voltage  
Comin at you from every side  
High voltage  
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide  
  
Whos the man the man in your hand over your land  
Roving over mans bolding when hes jammin your plans ova  
I am vics clorousos the most ferocious  
When I spy my third eye its extremely high voltage  
Thats why I need ruby corks glasses cause when I glance at the chest  
Then I might blast the masses  
Subliminals transmitted through piano  
Integrated in flow calculated to nano  
My IU skills are when I mean plea sees the rhyme I hear as I proceed through
time  
I walk through the walls and the inanimate obstacles  
While educed to the reduction of cells and molecules  
I bring the knowledge the you swallow like the state of hologram  
I bot your head fat your lip like collagen  
A telepath of the another verse with no postage  
Mike Shinoda we are high voltage  
  
High voltage  
This is the unforgettable sound  
High voltage  
Bringin you up and takin you down  
High voltage  
Comin at you from every side  
High voltage  
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide  
High voltage  
This is the unforgettable sound  
High voltage  
Bringin you up and takin you down  
High voltage  
Comin at you from every side  
High voltage  
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide  
Linkin Park being scratched over and over again
