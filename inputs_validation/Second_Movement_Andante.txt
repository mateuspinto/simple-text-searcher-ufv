How can I see when the light is gone out  
How can I hear when you speak so silently  
More than enough is never too much  
Hold out a hand Im so out of touch  
  
Do unto me as your heart would have you do  
Words in my head can I get the message through  
Sword in my hand can cut through the wood  
Peace in my heart can soften the mood  
  
What shall I do when they stand smiling at me  
Look at the floor and be oh so cool  
Oh so cool  
  
How shall I know when to start singing my song  
What shall I do if they all go wrong  
What shall I do  
  
What shall I do when they stand laughing at me  
Walk through the door and be oh so cool  
  
How shall I know when to stop singing my song  
What shall I do when it all goes wrong
