Were all just merely passing through  
Doing what we can do in a lifetime  
We have more than one adventure to take  
More than one dream to make in our lifetime  
As for me theres only one dream  
And thats to love you my love  
With a love to last a lifetime  
  
Were fools we sometimes do crazy things  
And our hearts would take wins like a sparrow  
But thats life  
Well take each day as it comes  
Never leaving the crumbs for the morrow  
As for me all of my days I will spend them all with you  
Loving you with love to last a lifetime  
  
If we all could leave something lasting behind to be remembered by  
Just a song for me and that at least I would have tried  
I agree its not so much what we have  
As how we use what we have in our lifetime  
  
Thirty years is worth a hundred and two  
Its really what we can do in our lifetime  
All my love I would give for as long as I may live  
With a love true love to last a lifetime
