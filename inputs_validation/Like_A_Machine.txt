Cant hear you baby  
Hey hey what you say  
Say I am a Vision  
Every time something plays  
Our system go switch  
Tone I am an over grad  
I aint thinking of listening no  
You think you are saying a spot  
But its all in your brain  
I think Im Our hearts straight to the dj  
Now record is flowing going round round  
Like a machine  
  
Chorus  
  
Music is got me on my love this night  
All I can do is keep on dancing  
He got me good now it controls me  
Like a machine  
Repeat  
  
 About the dollar bills bills in your pocket  
I aint tripping it down till the sun is out  
And I am gonna go hard till the floor breaks  
I am coming through I am the  
You think you are saying a spot  
But its all in your brain  
I think Im Our hearts straight to the dj  
Now record is flowing going round round  
Like a machine  
  
Chorus  
  
Feel it taking over me  
The music is all I see  
I cant stop  
What it does to me  
Gonna keep on dancing  
Dancing dancing repeat  
  
Chorus
