She was married and then divorced  
Things seemed to happen that way  
The children were confused sometimes theyd fight  
Sitting in their toys and games  
To them shes mother and I am their friend  
Who sits with them on his lap  
And sleeps on the sofa on alternate weekends  
No substitute for their dad  
Shes a very good mum  
As she tries to explain  
Everything that she can  
But a childs mind is sharp  
They imagine the worst  
Sometimes cant understand  
That theres so much to learn  
When you open a can of worms  
  
So to the park to play on the swings  
To give their mother a break  
When I saw their father walking down the path  
Heading down towards the gate  
I froze on the spot heart in my throat  
I hoped hed not see us there  
He soon disappeared and the kids on the slide  
Were happy and unaware  
  
I read the papers and made scrambled eggs  
The kids got ready to leave  
Their father was taking them for the weekend  
With pocket money and sweets  
They were excited as they waved goodbye  
And I went straight back to bed  
Their mother stood and watched as they drove away  
Standing on the front door step
