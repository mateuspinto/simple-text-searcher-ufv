Hey Mr cage man let me get a fresh breath  
Cherry bomb head strong I could fake my own death  
Hey Mr Fate man shuffle me a ninth life  
Ive been wrong go long  
Throwing me a sharp right  
Its not a picture perfect life  
Not what I had in mind  
Let me write my own line  
  
Chorus  
Ive got this place  
That Ive filled with empty space  
Oh Im trying not to face what Ive done  
My hopeless opus  
Im in this race and Im hoping just to place  
Oh Im trying not to face whats become of me  
My hopeless opus  
  
Hey Mr safe man hustle me an okay  
I could slide take a dive take it for the home team  
Hey Mr postman slip me one more green note  
Ive been low hit the floor looking just to make broke  
Its not a picture perfect life  
Not what I had in mind  
Let me write my own line  
  
Chorus  
Ive got this place  
That Ive filled with empty space  
Oh Im trying not to face what Ive done  
My hopeless opus  
Im in this race and Im hoping just to place  
Oh Im trying not to face whats become of me  
My hopeless opus  
  
Hey Mr  
Hey Mr  
Hey Mr cage man  
Cherry bomb  
Let me get  
Cherry bomb  
Cherry bomb  
  
Chorus  
Ive got this place  
That Ive filled with empty space  
Oh Im trying not to face what Ive done  
My hopeless opus  
Im in this race and Im hoping just to place  
Oh Im trying not to face whats become of me  
My hopeless opus
