Softly falls the morning rain  
Loneliness comes around again  
And I sit and sing my song  
Though it never seems to matter  
And it never fills the emptiness inside  
Frozen notes hang suspended in the autumn air  
While someone waits for someone to come somewhere  
No one waits for me  
Cause I thought I wanted to be free  
Now Im wondering why I said goodbye  
Looking through my window  
At the dark and troubled sky  
I think I see the ship of the brokenhearted passing by  
And I turn away  
From today  
To where we used to lie  
And I cry  
Yes I cry  
And I cry  
While softly falls the morning rain  
Loneliness comes around again
