Dolly Parton  
Down on Music Row  
Down on music Row  
If you want to be a star  
Thats where youve got to go  
I could feel a change a comin  
I left my hometown a hummin  
With my ol guitar a strummin  
Songs that I had wrote  
I was on my way to Nashville  
I just couldnt hardly wait  
Till I could sing my songs  
To the folks on Music Row  
I got into Nashville early  
Sleepy hungry tired and dirty  
And on the steps of RCA  
I ate a stale sweet roll  
In the fountain at the hall of fame  
I washed my face and read the names  
In the walkway of the stars  
Down on Music Row  
Down on Music Row  
Down on music Row  
If you want to be a star  
Thats where youve got to go  
I waited there till eight oclock  
When office doors became unlocked  
Then I started walkin  
Down the streets of Music Row  
Just a walkin up and down the street  
Tryin to find out who to see  
To help me get on record  
And to hear the songs Id wrote  
But I found it goin rough  
Everyone was all tied up  
Either in a conference  
Or in the studio  
They said that I could leave a tape  
But theyd suggest I didnt wait  
Cause everyone was awful busy  
Down on Music Row  
But I could feel that change a comin  
And I just kept right on a hummin  
With my ol guitar still strummin  
All them songs that Id wrote  
And then Chet and Bob at RCA  
Well they listened to my songs that day  
And they both told me that I was on my way  
Down on Music Row  
Down on Music Row  
Down on music Row  
If you want to be a star  
Thats where youve got to go
