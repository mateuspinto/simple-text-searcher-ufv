Rock and Roll music is the main weapon  
Check 1 2  
Alright watch this  
I was born with the voice of a riot a storm  
Lightning the function the form  
Far from the norm I wont follow like cattle Im more like a catalyst  
Calm in the mix of battle  
Who let the cowboy on a saddle he dont know a missile from a gavel  
Para terror troopin flippin loops of death upon innocent flesh but Im  
Back in the cipher my foes and friends with a verse and a pen against a line I
wont toe or defend  
Instead I curse at the murderous men in suits of professionals who act like
animals  
Man child ruthless and wild  
Who gonna chain this beast back on the leash This Texas furor for surea
compasionless con who serve a  
Lethal needle to the poor the cure for crime is murder  
Well I was born voice of a riot a storm  
Lightning the function the form  
Far from the norm I wont follow like cattle Im more like a catalyst  
Calm in the mix of battle  
Who let the cowboy on a saddle he dont know a missle from a gavel

On the Left On the Left left right left  
On the Left Uhh On the Left left right  
  
Ok youre lookin good you might just move a little left  
Just a little left about 170  
  
I read the news today oh boy a snap shot of a midnight ploy  
Vexed and powerless devoured by hours Im motionless with no rest  
Cause a scream now holds the sky under another hightech driveby  
A lie is a lie is a God an eagle is a condor of war and nothing more  
Islam peace Islam stare into my eyes brother please off our knees  
To beef now we feed their disease interlocked our hands across seas  
A flag is a rag is a shroud out loud outside a faceless crowd  
A cowering child just took their last breath one snare in the march of death  
  
Uhh come on  
Get up  
  
On the Left On the Left left right left  
On the Left On the Left left right left  
On the Left On the Left left right left  
On the Left Uhh On the Left left right  
  
Here it comes the sound of terror from above  
He flex his Texas twisted tounge  
The poor lined up to kill in desert slums  
For oil that boil beneath the desert sun  
Now we spit flame flip this game  
All the targets are taking aim  
All targets are taking aim  
Were the targets are taking aim
