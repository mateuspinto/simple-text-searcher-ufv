Past the cafe shutters down  
No one stirs in the town  
  
The morning after the rain  
The barges move on the Seine  
  
Down the avenue lined with trees  
Paris bells ring on the breeze  
Paris bells ring on the breeze  
  
Dawn is breaking birds start to sing  
Sun is rising warms everything  
  
The echo of footsteps on a cobbled street  
Dim alleyways where the shadows meet  
  
Down the avenue lined with trees  
Paris bells ring on the breeze  
Paris bells ring on the breeze  
  
The places where we used to visit  
The chapel where we went to wed  
  
Paris bells on the breeze  
Often stir memories  
  
We both knew the morning rain  
We both wandered down the Seine  
  
Now youre gone away from me  
Youre just a memory  
Like the bells ring on the breeze  
Paris bells ring on the breeze
