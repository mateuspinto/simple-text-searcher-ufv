Her long legs looked like trouble  
As she sasheyed through the door  
And my mind flashed a warning sign  
That I chose to ignore  
For the prize I thought I could win  
The risk seemed mighty small  
The bigger the fool the harder the fall  
  
Fell in love in the heat of passion  
Oh but passion has its price  
Under all that beauty  
Beat a heart that was made of ice  
God knows as far as I could see she didnt have a flaw  
But the bigger the fool the harder the fall  
  
I said a woman to keep  
The softer the skin  
The sweeter the love  
The more bitter the end  
Well one lesson Ive learned that applies to all  
The bigger the fool the harder the fall  
  
One day she was lovin me  
The next day she was gone  
And I became another verse  
To a lonesome heartbreak song  
Now that Ive learned to face the truth  
The words stick in my craw  
Well the bigger the fool the harder the fall  
  
I said a woman to keep  
The softer the skin  
The sweeter the love  
The more bitter the end  
Well one lesson Ive learned that applies to all  
The bigger the fool the harder the fall  
The bigger the fool the harder the fall
