Let it rain let it rain  
Open the floodgates of heaven  
Repeat  
  
The Lord reigns let the earth be glad  
Let the distance shores rejoice  
Clouds and thick darkness surround Him  
Righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne  
A fire goes before Him and consumes His foes on every side  
His lightning lights up the world  
The earth sees and trembles  
The mountains melt like wax before the Lord  
Before the Lord of all the earth  
The heavens proclaim His righteousness  
And all peoples will see His glory  
  
We want to see Your glory God  
Do you want to see His glory  
Lift your voices lift your hands  
  
Let it rain let it rain  
Open the floodgates of heaven  
Let it rain let it rain  
Open the floodgates of heaven
