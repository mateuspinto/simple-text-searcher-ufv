Listen to the tales and romanticize  
How we follow the path of the hero  
Boast about the day when the rivers overrun  
How we rise to the height of our halo  
  
Listen to the tales as we all rationalize  
Our way into the arms of the savior  
Fading all the trials and the tribulations  
None of us have actually been there  
Not like you  
  
Ignorant fibbers in the congregation  
Gather around spewing sympathy  
Spare me  
None of them can even hold a candle up to you  
Blinded by choices hypocrites wont see  
  
But enough about the collective Judas  
Who could deny you were the one who illuminated  
Your little piece of the divine  
  
This little light of mine  
The gift you passed onto me  
Ill let it shine  
To guide you safely on your way  
Your way home  
  
What are they going to do when the lights go down  
Without you to guide them all to Zion  
What are they going to do when the rivers overrun  
Other than tremble incessantly  
  
High is the way but our eyes are upon the ground  
You were the light and the way that theyll only read about  
I only pray Heaven knows when to lift you out  
Ten thousand days in the fire is long enough  
Youre going home  
  
Youre the only one who can hold your head up high  
  
Shake your fist at the gates saying  
I have come home now  
Fetch me the spirit  
The son and the father  
Tell them their pillar of faith has ascended  
Its time now my time now  
Give me my give me my wings  
  
Give me my  
Give me my wings  
  
You are the light a way  
That they will only read about  
  
Set as I am in my ways and my arrogance  
Burden of proof tossed upon nonbelievers  
You were my witness  
My eyes my evidence  
Judith Marie unconditional one  
  
Daylight dims leaving cold fluorescence  
Difficult to see you in this light  
Please forgive this bold suggestion  
Should you see your makers face tonight  
Look him in the eye  
Look him in the eye and tell him  
I never lived a lie never took a life  
But surely saved one hallelujah  
Its time for you to bring me home
