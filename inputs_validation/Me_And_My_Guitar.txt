When my baby leaves me there is nothing I can do  
I pick up my guitar and then I play a little blues or two  
Now a man needs some loving I aint different from the rest  
My baby when she leaves me ah my whole life is in a mess  
  
Just me and my guitar  
I play the blues for you babe  
No matter where you are  
  
I like to start out easy just to get that feel  
When I fell me strange you know I make it for real  
Then I put some hots on it and I play a time or two  
And love you baby and I dont care what you do  
  
Babe ah me and my guitar  
I play the blues for you babe  
No matter where you are alright  
  
Listen to me  
Satisfaction dont come easy you got to get in to make it good  
The way I make my guitar singing just let my woman should  
She never talk right to me like some woman do  
I feel so sad and lonesome when I play this lowdown blues  
  
Hey hey me and my guitar  
I play the blues for you babe  
No matter where you are alright  
  
Hey baby hey baby just me and my guitar  
I play the blues for me baby  
No matter where you are
