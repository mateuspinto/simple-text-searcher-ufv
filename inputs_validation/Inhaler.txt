Water falling down a hundred meters  
Colored by the sun  
In rainbow colors  
Paul is driving me around  
Through fields of light  
Blinded by the sun  
Fight the clouds  
Be an inhaler  
Have no doubts  
  
Let them take you on a voyage to another  
Let them take you on a voyage to another  
Let them take you on a voyage to another
