Jive talkin  
Youre telling me lies yeah  
Jive talkin  
You wear a disguise  
Jive talkin  
So misunderstood yeah  
Jive talkin  
Youre really no good  
  
Nobody gets too much heaven no more  
Its much harder to come by  
Im waiting in line  
Nobody gets too much love anymore  
Its as high as a mountain  
And harder to climb  
  
How deep is your love  
How deep is your love  
I really need to learn  
Cause were living in a world of fools  
Breaking us down  
And they all should let us be  
We belong to you and me  
Do do do do  
How deep is your love  
Do do  
How deep is your  
Do do do do  
How deep is your love  
Do do do do  
How deep is your love  
  
Well you can tell by the way I use my walk  
Im a womans man  
No time to talk  
Musics loud and feelings warm  
Ive been doing it right since I was born  
But thats all right  
Thats ok  
We can look the other way  
We can try to understand  
The New York Times effect on man  
  
Whether youre a mother or whether youre a brother  
Youre stayin alive stayin alive  
Feel the city breakin and everybody shakin  
People stayin alive stayin alive  
Ha ha ha ha stayin alive stayin alive  
Ha ha ha ha stayin alive  
  
Yeah  
Im staying alive
