The writing is on the wall baby  
Were different as day and night  
But I guess that I refused to face it  
The blues in black and white  
  
When I got home I knew baby  
Something was wrong tonight  
When I found the note you wrote it gave  
The blues in black and white  
  
Chorus  
Color my world without you in it  
And the future dont look too bright  
Darlin its not a pretty picture  
The blues in black and white  
  
Since youve been gone Im going crazy  
Ive got to get on with my life  
Maybe Ill write a book and call it  
The blues in black and white  
  
Chorus
