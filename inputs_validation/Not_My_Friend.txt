Help me breathe  
Help me believe  
You seem really glad that I am sad  
  
You are not my friend  
I cannot pretend that you are  
  
You made it sting  
Your voice is ringing  
Just like the boys who laughed at me in school  
  
You are not my friend  
I cannot pretend anymore  
  
You found a place  
No one should ever go  
  
Ill be okay  
Cause when I back away  
Im gonna keep the handle of your gun in sight
