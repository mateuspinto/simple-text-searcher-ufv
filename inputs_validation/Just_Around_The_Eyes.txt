Just around the eyes  
Thats where you remind me  
Of someone I left behind me  
Im sorry if I stare  
  
But you must have stirred a memory  
And it caught me by surprise  
But it was only for a moment  
And just around the eyes  
  
Something in your touch  
Took me back a long way  
And made me say the wrong name  
I wish I could explain  
  
But if I had to tell you  
Where a small resemblance lies  
Its something in your touch  
And just around the eyes  
  
Im over him completely  
I rarely think about him at all  
So when I look at you  
Tell me what should I do  
With the little bit of him that I saw  
  
Only when you smiled  
You could have bowled me over  
A memory out of nowhere  
That came and went so fast  
  
Dont tell me I still love him  
That has to be a lie  
Its just something in your touch  
And only when you smile  
  
And only for a moment  
Just around the eyes
