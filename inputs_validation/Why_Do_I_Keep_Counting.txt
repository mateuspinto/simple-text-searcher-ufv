Theres a plane and I am flying  
Theres a mountain waiting for me  
Oh these years have been so trying  
  
I dont know if I can use them  
Am I strong enough  
To be the one  
Will I live to have some children  
  
Help me get down  
I can make it  
Help me get down  
Help me get down  
I can make it  
Help me get down  
  
If I only knew the answer  
I wouldnt be bothering you  
  
Father  
Help me get down  
I can make it  
Help me get down  
Help me get down  
I can make it  
Help me get down  
  
If I only knew the answer  
And if all our days are numbered  
Then why do I keep counting  
  
My sugar sweet  
Is so attainable  
This behavior so unexplainable  
The days just slip and slide  
Like they always did  
The trouble is my head  
Wont let me forget  
  
I took one last good look around  
So many unusual sounds  
I gotta get my feet on the ground  
  
Help me get down  
I can make it  
  
Help me get down  
I can make it  
Help me get down  
Help me get down  
I can make it  
Help me get down  
  
If I only knew the answer  
I wouldnt be bothering you  
  
Father  
Help me get down  
I can make  
Help me get down  
Help me get down  
I can make it  
Help me get down  
  
If I only knew the answer  
And if all our days are numbered  
I wouldnt be bothering you  
  
Would you help me get down  
  
If I only knew the answer  
If I change my way of living  
And if I pave my streets with good times  
Will the mountain keep on giving  
  
And if all of our days are numbered  
Then why do I keep counting
