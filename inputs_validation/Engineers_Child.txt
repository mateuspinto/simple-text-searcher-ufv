A little child on a sickbed lay and death was very near  
She was the pride and only child of a railroad engineer  
His duty had called him from those he loved and seeing that hope was dim  
While a tear he shed to his wife he said just have two lanterns trimmed  
Just hang a light as I pass tonight hang it where it can be seen  
If our babys dead just show the red if shes better then show the green  
  
In a little house by the railroad track a mother with watchful eye  
Saw a gleam of hope and a feeble smile as the train went rushing by  
Just one short look was his only chance to see the light agleam  
In the midnight air there arose a prayer thank God the light was green  
Just hang a light
