Aah get the burner  
Uh the burner  
Let loose the cannon  
Blood drippin slippin off my planet  
Man the panic funk mode  
Mechanical mix flows competition in my dojo  
Swing a hook got the vertebrae be brave  
Heat gain meltin on my heatwave  
Power to the crowd pandemonium  
Showin em how I gets down  
  
Chorus  
The life of a killer is scandalous  
The life of a killer is dangerous  
The life of a killer is scandalous  
The life of a killer is dangerous  
  
Triggedy skyhigh like a kite  
God diggity every other clouds blue  
Puff on a yeah puff on a  
Bring it on off on baby onetwo  
Peep in the arena death at your doorstep  
Right around the corner is the land of regret  
When ya sweat to get down sweat to get off and on  
Till the nothin normal bout my songs  
  
Chorus x2  
  
LL Cool J jazzy jewel  
Takin dime pieces to the real school  
I got em on nations buckin like fools  
Pitbulls fightin over streets I rule  
Catch it if you can when its hot ta hitcha hand  
Throw ya skunks in the air my funk got the flair man  
I can do division baby I can do math  
Multiplying fractions now ya know the half  
Knuckle games played must pack steel  
Oh yes Im livin like real  
To the highest extent bloody clothes doin battle  
Till the death of my foes its my show  
  
Chorus x2
