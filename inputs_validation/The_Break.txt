Diana  
They told me that the wiring  
Was somehow all misfiring  
And screwing up the signals in my brain  
  
And then they told me chemistry   
The juice and not the circuitry   
Was mixing up and making me insane  
  
What happens if the burn has healed  
But the skin has not regrown  
What happens if the cast at last comes off  
And then you find the break  
Was always in another bone  
  
They tried a millions meds and  
They strapped me to their beds and  
They shrugged and told me thats the way it goes  
  
And finally you hit it  
I asked you just what did it  
You shrugged and said that no one really knows  
  
What happens if the medicine wasnt really in control  
What happens if the cut the burn the break  
Was never in my brain or in my blood but in my soul  
  
What happens if the cut the burn the break  
Was never in my brain  
Or in my blood  
But in my soul
