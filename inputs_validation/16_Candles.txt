words and music by luther dixon and allyson khent  
  
Happy birthday happy birthday baby  
Oh I love you so  
  
Sixteen candles make a lovely light  
But not as bright as your eyes tonight as your eyes tonight oh  
Blow out the candles make your wish come true  
For Ill be wishing that you love me too that you love me too  
  
Youre only sixteen sixteen  
But youre my teenage queen youre my queen  
Youre the prettiest loveliest girl Ive ever seen Ive ever seen oh  
  
Sixteen candles in my heart will glow  
For ever and ever for I love you so for I love you so  
  
Youre only sixteen sixteen  
But youre my teenage queen youre my queen  
Oh youre the prettiest loveliest girl Ive ever seen Ive ever seen oh  
  
Sixteen candles in my heart will glow  
For ever and ever for I love you so for I love you so  
For I love you so
