Oh mercy mercy mercy me  
I look around I need another remedy  
The I dont know is philosophy  
Better yet Ill let you get ahead of me  
Oh mercy mercy  mercy me  
Come around I need another enemy  
Anyone could clearly see  
A summer breeze is part of my anatomy  
When its written in Britain  
We get a little smittin  
Like a kitten a cuddle is where Im benefitin  
Any higher the fire would have to petrify her  
Upon the wire the flyer is gonna satisfy her  
My love is forever my love it can feel this  
My breathless defender  
Step forward and steal this  
Mercy mercy mercy me  
Comin down I gotta catch the gravity  
Even though we disagree  
Give a kiss cause life could be the death of me  
Acrobatic the static is getting too dramatic  
Comin down with the system  
Well get it systematic  
Fascilitatin the maiden my love is circulating  
Rejuvenating the fading but never dialating  
Mercy mercy mercy me  
Lovin on the color of an Emily  
Easy as a guarantee  
Better yet Ill show you what you wanna see  
My love is forever I want you to feel this  
My breathless defender  
step forward and steal this  
We aim to forever I want you to feel this  
My gentle defender  
Step forward and steal this
