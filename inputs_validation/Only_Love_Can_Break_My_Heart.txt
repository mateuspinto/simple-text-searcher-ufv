Youre walking like an angel in heaven  
In the night I see an angel in you  
In my lonely dreams I count to seven  
And I call you baby  
Know that it is true  
When youre young and in love  
Its too hot to stop  
Young and in love  
You never give up  
  
Only love can break my heart  
Its tearing me apart  
Now I never feel brand new  
Only love can break my heart  
Playing its so hard  
Nobody loves me like you do  
  
Only love can break my heart  
Its time to make a start  
Babe I love you without end  
Only love can break my heart  
Youll make it if you start  
Babe take me as your friend  
  
Your feelings are tossing and turning  
You have to love to pay the right price  
Your lonely heart keeps on burning  
But an angel will hear many lies  
When youre young and in love  
Its too hot to stop  
Young and in love  
You can never give up
