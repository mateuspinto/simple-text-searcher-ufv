Highway 51 runs right by my babys door  
Highway 51 runs right by my babys door  
If I dont get the girl Im loving  
Wont go down to Highway 51 no more  
  
Well I know that highway like I know my hand  
Yes I know that highway like I know the back of my hand  
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no mans land  
  
Well if I should die before my time should come  
And if I die before my time should come  
Wont you bury my body out on the Highway 51  
  
Highway 51 runs right by my babys door  
I said Highway 51 runs right by my babys door  
If I dont get the girl Im loving  
Wont go own to Highway 51 no more
