I love it though  
I love it though  
  
Uh put your hands to the constellations  
They way you look should be a sin you my sensation  
I know Im preaching to the congregation  
We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan  
  
I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting  
We aint married but tonight I need some consummation  
  
May the Lord forgive us  
May the Gods be with us  
And that magic hour  
I seen good Christians  
Make brash decisions  
Oh she do it  
What happened to Religion  
Oh she lose it  
She putting on her make up  
She casually allure  
Text message break up the casualty of tour  
How she gone wake up and not love me no more  
I thought I was the ass hole I guess its rubbing off  
Hood phenomenon the Lebron of rhyme  
Hard to be humble when you stuntin on a jumbotron  
Im looking at her like this what you really wantedt huh  
What we argue anyway oh I forgot its summertime  
  
Put your hands to the constellations  
They way you look should be a sin you my sensation  
I know Im preaching to the congregation  
We love Jesus but you done learned a lot from Satan  
  
Satan Satan Satan  
  
I mean a nigga did a lot of waiting  
We aint married but tonight I need some consummation  
  
When the sun go down its the magic hour  
The magic hour  
And outta all the colors that are still up the skies  
You got green on your mind  
I can see it in your eyes  
Why you standing there with your face screwed up  
Dont leave while your hot thats how Mase screwed up  
Throwing shit around the whole place screwed up  
Maybe I should call Mase so that he could pray for us  
I hit the Jamaican spot at the bar take a seat  
I ordered you jerk she said you are what you eat  
You see I always loved your sense of humor  
But tonight you should have seen how quiet the room was  
The Lyor Cohen or Dior Homme thats Dior Homme not Dior homie  
The crib Scarface couldnt be more Tony  
You love me for me could you be more phoney  
  
Uh put your hands to the constellations  
They way you look should be a sin you my sensation  
Havent said a word havent said a word to me this evening  
Cat got your tongue  
  
Lookin at my bitch I bet she give your ass a bone  
Lookin at my wrist itll turn your ass to stone  
Stretch limousine sippin Rose all along  
Doubleheaded monster with a mind of his own  
Cherry red chariot excess is just my character  
All black tux nigga shoes lavender  
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders  
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired  
Before his jaw shattered climbin up the Lords ladder  
We still speedin runnin signs like they dont matter  
Uh hater talkin never made me mad  
Never that when Im in my favorite paper tag  
Therefore G4s at the Clearport  
When it come to tools fool Im a Pep Boy  
When it came to dope I was quick to export  
Never tired of ballin so its on to the next sport  
New Mercedes sedan the Lex sport  
So many cars DMV though it was mail fraud  
Different traps I was gettin mail from  
Polk County Jacksonville rep Melbourne  
Whole cliques appetite had tapeworms  
Spinnin Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my jay burns  
I shed a tear before the nights over  
God bless the man I put this ice over uh  
Gettin 2Pac money twice over  
Still a real nigga red Coogi sweater dice roller  
Im makin love to the angel of death  
Catchin feelings never stumble retracin my steps
