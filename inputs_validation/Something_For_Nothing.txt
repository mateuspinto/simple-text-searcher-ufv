Waiting for the winds of change  
To sweep the clouds away  
Waiting for the rainbows end  
To cast its gold your way  
Countless ways  
You pass the days  
  
Waiting for someone to call  
And turn your world around  
Looking for an answer to  
The question you have found  
Looking for  
An open door  
  
You dont get something for nothing  
You dont get freedom for free  
You wont get wise  
With the sleep still in your eyes  
No matter what your dreams might be  
  
What you own is your own kingdom  
What you do is your own glory  
What you love is your own power  
What you live is your own story  
In your head is the answer  
Let it guide you along  
Let your heart be the anchor  
And the beat of your own song
