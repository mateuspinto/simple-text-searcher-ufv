Baby you summertime fine I let you get on top  
I be the underline Im tryna get beside you  
Like the number nine dime you fine as hell  
I guess I met you for a reason only time can tell  
But well Im wondering what type of shit you wantin  
Do you like the finer things or you a simple woman  
Would you drink with a nigga do you smoke weed  
Dont be ashamed it aint no thing I used to blow trees  
Gettin lifted I quit but shit I might get high with you  
Its only fitting cause Im looking super fly with you  
A flower you are powerful you do something to me  
Cause girl I caught the vibes like you threw something to me  
So I threw em back now all my niggas hollering who was that  
Oh boy she bad nigga what you bout do with that  
Im finna take you home just sip a little patron  
Now we zonin baby you so fine  
  
Chorus x2  
And can I hit it in the morning  
Can I hit it in the morning  
And can I hit it in the morning  
The sun rising while you moanin  
  
Uh baby you winter time cold  
The night is still young drink that dinner wine slow  
Im tryna make the goose bumps on your inner thigh show  
Ill let you beat me there as far as finish lines go  
Yeah and if you gotta leave for work  
Ill be right here in the same bed that you left me in  
I love thick women cause my aunt she rode equestrian  
I used to go to the stables and get them kids to bet me  
And I would always ride the stallions whenever she let me  
Im joking I mean that thing is poking  
I mean you kinda like that girl thats in the US Open  
I mean I got this hidden agenda that you provoking  
I got bath water that you can soak in things I could do with lotion  
Dont need a towel we could dry off in the covers  
And when you think you like it I promise you gonna love it  
Yeah well lights coming through the drapes and we both yawning  
I roll over and ask if I can hit  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Hey God bless the child that can hold his own  
God bless the woman that can hold Patron  
God bless her home girl that drove us home  
No strings attached like a cordless phone  
You see my intentions with you is clear  
Im learning not to judge a woman by the shit that she wear  
Therefore you shouldnt judge a nigga off of the shit that you hear  
Get all defensive apprehensive all because my career  
To be fair I know we barely know each other and yeah  
Somehow I wound up in your bed so where we headed from here  
Just say youre scared if youre scared  
But if you through frontin we can do somethin  
And you know just what Im talkin about  
Tomorrow youll be callin out  
Cause tonight we getting right into the wee morn  
Cook a nigga breakfast after sex is like a reward  
Then I go my own way you think about me all day  
Thats just a warning  
  
Chorus x2
