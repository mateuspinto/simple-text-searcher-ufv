Down along the river  
Where the big bulrushes grow  
You find the old frog jumpin the water  
He wont come up no more babe  
He wont come up no more baby  
He wont come up no more woo  
He wont come up no more sugar mama  
He wont come up no more  
  
Smell that burnin fire baby  
Burnin in the sand  
See that devil rise mama  
He sho want to take yo hand now  
He sho want to take yo hand baby  
He sho want to take yo hand woo  
He sho want to take yo hand sugar mama  
He sho want to take yo hand  
  
Oh harvest moon  
Keep shinin your light down on me  
The lord reach out his hand  
My soul floats out to thee  
  
I dont feel no pain  
When they shot me down  
Lay my body out baby  
They put me in the ground so cold  
They put me in the ground baby  
They put me in the ground woo  
They put me in the ground sugar mama  
They put me in the ground
