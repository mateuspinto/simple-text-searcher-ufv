Somebody saw you at the station  
You had your suitcase in your hand  
You didnt give no information  
You walked off with another man  
Im always standing in the shadows baby  
I watched you give yourself away  
You take them home into your bedroom  
You had another busy day  
  
I tried to look the other way and fake it  
You push me to the limits  
I cant take it  
  
CHORUS  
One down one to go  
Just another bullet in the chamber  
Sometimes loves a loaded gun  
Red lights stop and go  
Whatcha gonna do when you play with danger  
Sometimes loves a loaded gun  
And it shoots to kill  
  
Someday theyll put me in a squad car  
Someday theyll throw away the key  
But til that day Ill be a mad dog  
Cause thats what you taught me to be  
  
You looked into the eyes of men above you  
I was the one who really tried to love you  
  
One down one to go  
Just another bullet in the chamber  
Sometimes loves a loaded gun  
Red lights stop and go  
Whatcha gonna do when you play with danger  
Sometimes loves a loaded gun  
And it shoots to kill  
Pull the trigger  
  
I tried to look the other way and fake it  
You know you push me right to the limit  
I cant take it  
  
One down one to go  
Just another bullet in the chamber  
Sometimes loves a loaded gun  
Red lights stop and go  
Whatcha gonna do when you play with danger  
Sometimes loves a loaded gun  
And it shoots to kill  
  
Somebody saw you at the station
