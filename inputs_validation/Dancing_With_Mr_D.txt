Down in the graveyard where we have our tryst  
The air smells sweet the air smells sick  
He never smiles his mouth merely twists  
The breath in my lungs feels clinging and thick  
But I know his name hes called Mr D  
And one of these days hes gonna set you free  
Human skulls is hangin right round his neck  
The palms of my hands is clammy and wet  
  
Lord I was dancin dancin dancin so free  
Dancin dancin dancin so free  
Dancin Lord keep your hand off me  
Dancin with Mr D with Mr D with Mr D  
  
Will it be poison put in my glass  
Will it be slow or will it be fast  
The bite of a snake the sting of a spider  
A drink of Belladonna on a Toussaint night  
Hiding in a corner in New York City  
Lookin down a fortyfour in West Virginia  
  
I was dancin dancin dancin so free  
Dancin dancin dancin so free  
Dancin Lord keep your hand off me  
Dancin with Mr D with Mr D with Mr D  
  
One night I was dancin with a lady in black  
Wearin black silk gloves and a black silk hat  
She looked at me longin with black velvet eyes  
She gazed at me strange all cunning and wise  
Then I saw the flesh just fall off her bones  
The eyes in her skull was burning like coals  
Lord have mercy fire and brimstone  
I was dancin with Mrs D  
  
Lord I was dancin dancin dancin so free  
I was dancin dancin dancin so free  
Dancin dancin dancin so free  
  
Dancin dancin
