Did it all for you to say  
You never wanted me that way  
Now the dogs have had their meat  
I think I will go plug in the mains  
  
I tumble like a cloud  
Before you burn in hell  
I suffocate myself into your hair  
  
Will the sparrow make her smile  
Im instantly your biggest fan  
How was I to know that you practiced it before hand  
  
I tumble like a cloud  
Before you burn in hell  
I suffocate myself into your hair
