Tombstone shadow stretchin across my path  
Tombstone shadow stretchin across my path  
Evry time I get some good news ooh  
Theres a shadow on my back  
  
Saw the gypsy man way down in san berdoo  
Said I saw the gypsy man way down in san berdoo  
Five dollars on the table ooh  
Keep me way from my tomb  
Oh oh  
  
Said I got thirteen months of bad luck  
Bound to be some pain  
Dont you do no travlin  
Fly in no machines  
Tombstone shadow stretchin across my path  
  
Every time I get some good news ooh  
Theres a shadow on my back  
  
The man gave me a luck charm cost five dollars more  
Said put some on your pillow and put some on your door  
He said take a long vacation ooh  
For thirteen months or more  
Oh lord  
  
Tombstone shadow stretchin across my path  
Tombstone shadow stretchin across my path  
Every time I get some good news ooh  
Theres a shadow on my back  
  
Oh oh lord  
Oh lord
