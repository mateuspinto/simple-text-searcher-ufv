You say youre all alone  
And after all the changes youve been through today  
You can use a little tenderness right now  
  
OK Ive been alone  
And I can understand the way you feel tonight  
Maybe together we can charge it all right now  
  
I can tell by the look in your tearfilled eyes  
You need somebody you can hold onto  
  
If you really want to Id love to hold you  
If you really want to then Id love to be the body that you hold onto  
  
You say he broke your heart  
He left you crying but he did not set you free  
And now you feel like you can never love again  
  
OK so let me know  
Its up to you how long you let his memory stay  
And do you really want to carry on this way  
  
I can tell by the look in your tearfilled eyes  
You need somebody you can hold onto  
  
If you really want to Id love to hold you  
If you really want to then Id love to be the body that you hold onto  
  
If you really want to if you really want to  
Then I really cant deny you  
  
So many things you need to know so many left to say  
But you mean more than words I know  
I can help you chase the pain away  
  
I can tell by the look in your tearfilled eyes  
You need somebody you can hold onto  
  
If you really want to if you really want to  
If you really want to then Id love to be the body that you hold onto  
If you really want to if you really want to  
Then I really cant deny you  
  
If you really want to if you really want to  
If you really want to
