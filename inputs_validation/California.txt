Sitting in a park in Paris France  
Reading the news and it sure looks bad  
They wont give peace a chance  
That was just a dream some of us had  
Still a lot are left to see  
But I wouldnt want to stay here  
Its too old and cold and settled in its ways here  
Oh but California  
California Im coming home  
Im going to see the folks I dig  
Ill even kiss a sunset pig  
California Im coming home  
  
I met a redneck on a Grecian isle  
Who did the goat dance very well  
He gave me back my smile  
But he kept my camera to sell  
Oh the rogue the red red rogue  
He cooked good omelettes and stews  
And I might have stayed on with him there  
But my heart cried out for you California  
California Im coming home  
Oh make me feel good rock n roll band  
Im your biggest fan  
California Im coming home  
  
Chorus  
Oh it gets so lonely  
When youre walking  
And the streets are full of strangers  
All the news of home you read  
Just gives you the blues  
Just gives you the blues  
  
So I bought me a ticket  
I caught a plane to Spain  
Went to a party down a red dirt road  
There were lots of pretty people there  
Reading rolling stone reading vogue  
They said how long can you hang around  
I said a week maybe two  
Just until my skin turns brown  
Then Im going home to California  
California Im coming home  
Will you take me as I am  
Strung out on another man  
California Im coming home  
Im coming home  
Im coming home  
Im coming home  
Yeah  
Take me as I am  
Will you  
Will you
