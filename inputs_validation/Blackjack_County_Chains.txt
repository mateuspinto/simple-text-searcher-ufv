I was sittin beside the road in Black Jack County  
Not knowing that the Sheriff paid a bounty  
For men like me that hadnt got a penny to their name  
So he locked my leg to 35 pounds of Black Jack County  
Chains  
  
And all we had to eat was bread and water  
Each day we built the road a mile and a quarter  
A Black Snake Whip would cut the back of any man who complained  
But we couldnt fight back wearing 35 pounds of Black  
Jack County Chains  
  
One night while the Sheriff he was sleeping  
We all gathered round him slowly creeping  
Heaven help me to forget that night in the cold cold rain  
When we beat him to death with 35 pounds of Black Jack  
County Chains  
  
Now the whip marks have all healed and I am thankful  
Theres nothing left but a scar around my ankle  
But most of all Im glad no man will be a slave again  
To a Black Snake Whip and 35 pounds of Black Jack County  
Chains
