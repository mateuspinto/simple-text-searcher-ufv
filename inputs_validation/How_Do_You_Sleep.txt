Ive seen your severed head at a banquet for the dead  
All dressed up for dinner looked so fine  
Your shining silver salver so tastefully powdered  
With the finest military quick lime  
  
Now try and picture this as I gave you a kiss  
The apple in your mouth slipped in mine  
The orchestra played the sweetest serenade  
We laughed as we put away your wine  
  
So raise your glasses heres a toast to wasted lives  
May all their ghost come back to haunt you  
And tell you how they died  
  
How do you sleep  
How do you last the night and keep the dogs at bay  
How do you feel  
When you close your eyes and try and drift away  
Does it feel any better now does it mean any more  
When the angel of death comes knock knocking  
And banging at your door  
  
When all the fun was over I put you on my shoulder  
Took you home away from it all  
Shot down and claimed mounted and framed  
Tastefully hung up on my wall  
  
Are my dreams your nightmares  
Get off your knees the partys over  
Im coming home to you  
  
How do you sleep  
How do you last the night and keep the dogs at bay  
How do you feel  
When you close your eyes and try and drift away  
Does it feel any better now does it mean any more  
When the angel of death comes knock knocking  
And banging at your door  
  
How do you sleep  
How do you last the night and keep the dogs at bay  
How do you feel  
When you close your eyes and try and drift away  
Does it feel any better now does it mean any more  
When the angel of death comes knock knocking  
And banging at your door  
  
At your door
