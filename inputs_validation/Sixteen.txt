Sweet 16 in leather boots  
Body and soul  
I go crazy  
Baby baby Im a hungry  
sweet 16  
  
Funky bar all full of faces  
Pretty faces beautiful faces  
Body and soul body and soul I give to you  
I am an easy mark with my broken heart  
Sweet 16  
  
Show you my explosion sweet 16  
Go out to the funky bar I get hurt crying inside  
Cause everybodys so fine  
And they dont need me  
  
Tell me what can I do sweet 16  
I give you my body and soul sweet 16  
I must be hungry cause I go crazy  
Over your leather boots  
Now baby I know  
  
Thats not normal  
But I love you  
I love you  
I love you sweet 16  
Everywhere I go I love it
