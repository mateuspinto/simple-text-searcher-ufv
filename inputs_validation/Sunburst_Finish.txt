Ritual dancer spins away  
Lost in a whirling dervish ballet  
Musicians playing  
Out of tune in perfect harmony  
  
Traveling down the sandy track  
Compass in hand guitar on my back  
Trying to find the  
Secret truth inside the pyramid  
  
Foxy pharaoh knows all wont tell  
Dangerous knowledge locked in a cell  
Method in madness  
Ancient logic never ending mystery  
  
Anticipation fills the air  
As the natives gather round  
Watching the fiery sun go down  
In the technicolor sky  
Exploding mandala of light  
Disappearing into darkness  
A stunning sunburst finish  
Shatters the horizon  
  
Eye of the sphinx now winks at you  
What is he thinking wish that i knew  
Wonder of wisdom  
Far beyond this mortal comedy  
  
Wind of the desert blowing strong  
Mist of the ocean kissed by the sun  
Tropical splendor  
Paradise is calling you away  
  
Make up your mind dont make a scene  
Wake up to find your garden is green  
Please take your seat on board  
The destination is utopia  
  
Echoing across the canyon  
Hear the song of the gypsy caravan  
Magical voices in flight  
  
Looking for the next oasis  
Neath the glow of the silvershadow moon  
Radiant princess of night  
  
Stay forever stay for a while  
Hypnotized by sight and sound  
Empty feelings bring a frown  
Only love can make you smile
