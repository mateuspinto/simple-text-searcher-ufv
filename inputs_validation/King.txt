One night at the disco I wanted to dance slow  
I saw a sweet baby such a fine lady  
I walked up to ask her but some dude just grabbed her  
I told him to back off cut me some slack off  
I see you come here drinkin that cheap beer  
Act like you own it I cant condone it  
You show me now respect you got to get off it  
You got to get with it Time for a swift kick  
You see I own this town You best not come around  
If you wanna get by then cool it down  
If you wanna start something know one thing Im king  
If you wanna mess around like that thats just how it is  
If you wanna get by then mind your biz  
If you wanna start something know one thing Im king  
  
You wanted attention and did I mention  
Nobody likes you except for the losers  
You made a whole army an army of babies  
Some of them stupid some of them crazy  
Pick up your action act like a grown man  
Look at the winners you can be like them  
Life is so easy pleasant and dreamy  
If you get off me if you get with me  
You see I own this town You best not come around  
If you wanna get by then cool it down  
If you wanna start something know one thing Im king  
If you wanna mess around like that thats just how it is  
If you wanna get by then mind your biz  
If you wanna start something know one thing Im king  
  
You cant break me  
Never take me  
Thats just how it is  
You cant break me  
Never shake me  
Clear out of my biz
