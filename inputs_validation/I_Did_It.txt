Im mixing up a bunch of magic stuff  
A magic mushroom cloud of care  
A potion that will rock the boat will rock  
Make a bomb of love and blow it up  
  
I did it  
Do you think Ive gone too far  
I did it  
Guilty as charged  
I did it  
It was me right or wrong  
I did it Yeah  
  
I never did a single thing that did a single thing to  
Change the ugly ways of the world  
I didnt know it felt so right inside  
I didnt know at all  
Open up the curtains I heard sirens there the lights flash and crawl  
I did it justice I just did it for us all  
  
Its a nickel or a dime for what Ive done  
The truth is that I dont really care  
For such a lovely crime Ill do the time  
You better lock me up Ill do it again

It was me right or wrong  
I did it

I never did a single thing that did a single thing to  
Change the ugly ways of the world  
I didnt know it felt so right inside  
I didnt know at all  
Open up the curtains I heard sirens there the lights flash and crawl  
I did it justice I just did it for the buzz  
  
All you people are the skewers of our dreams  
Like the cat that collared me  
Oh what I gotta say to you got love dont  
Turn it down  
Turn it loud  
Let it build  
We got a long way to go  
But you gotta start somewhere  
Go door to door spread the love you got  
You got the love  
You get what you want  
Does it matter where you get it from  
I for one  
Dont turn my cheek for anyone  
Unturn your cheek to give your love  
Love to grow

Change the ugly ways of the world

I did it justice I just did it for us all
