You and I  we may look the same  
But we are very far apart  
Theres bulletholes where my compassion used to be  
And there is violence in my heart  
  
Into fire you can send us  
From the fire we return  
You can label us a consequence  
Of how much you have to learn  
  
You can try but youll never understand  
This is something you will never understand  
Can you hear it now  
Hear it coming now  
Can you hear it now  
  
On hands and knees  
We crawl  
You cannot stop us all  
Our bones our skin  
We will not let you in  
  
You have set something in motion  
Much greater than youve ever known  
Standing there in all your grand naivety  
About to reap what you have sown  
  
Time will feed upon your weaknesses  
And soon youll lose the will to care  
When you return to the place that you call home  
We will be there we will be there  
  
On hands and knees  
We crawl  
You cannot stop us all  
Our blood will stay  
We will not go away  
  
On hands and knees  
We crawl  
You can not stop us all  
Our blood our ways  
Will never leave this place  
  
We crawl  
We crawl  
We crawl  
We crawl
