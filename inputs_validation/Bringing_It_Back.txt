If I can never see you if I can never hold you  
If I can never touch your face or feel your warm embrace  
I still remember talkin I still remember laughin  
I still remember lovin you a lot and touchin you  
  
Only bringin it back only just bringin it back  
A familiar face a familiar face just brings it all back  
Everythings bringin it back good songs bringin it back  
Even after so much time everythings bringin it back  
  
Thinkin in my solitude wonderin about your attitude  
Thinkin maybe that your love has died  
There it is I can see it in your eyes  
A look of sweet surrender a touch of too much sadness  
Cause Ive hurt you so you know your sorrow shows  
You just cant stay but you cant let go
