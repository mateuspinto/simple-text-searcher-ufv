While by the sheep we watched at night  
Glad tidings brought an angel bright  
How great our joy  
Great our joy  
Joy joy joy  
Joy joy joy  
Praise we the Lord in Heaven on high  
This gift of God we cherish well  
That ever by our hearts shall fill  
How great our joy  
Great our joy  
Joy joy joy  
Joy joy joy  
Praise we the Lord in Heaven on high  
Praise we the Lord in Heaven on high
