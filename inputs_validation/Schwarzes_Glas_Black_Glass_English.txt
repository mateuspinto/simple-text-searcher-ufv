A small wish oh if you were blind  
we are victims of a bad trick  
black glass is everywhere  
we are guilty because we are ugly  
  
Black glass the light blinds me  
a small wish oh if you were blind  
black glass and I see my face again  
what can I do since we are ugly  
  
In front of the middle of a deep fall  
and under masks fades smooth  
black glass is everywhere  
how beautiful you were is forgotten  
  
Black glass the light blinds me  
a small wish oh if you were blind  
black glass and I see my face again  
what can I do since we are ugly
