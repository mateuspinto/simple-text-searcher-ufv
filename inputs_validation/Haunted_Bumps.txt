I come beatin down the block and I crack the bedrock  
Dishes drop the shit comes to a dead stop  
Motherfuckers think godzillas comin the lights go dark  
The whole house hummin  
My amps draw energy and wipe out the power  
My beat transmits over radio tower  
The woofers might suck all the air out your lungs if you stand too close  
When the monster hums  
People think a nuclear war is at their front door  
When I got my volume only on four  
gas pipes explode and the storefronts shatter  
Killing these kilowatts is all that matter  
Fuck the police the citizens and fuck the judge  
Ill blow they whole house down with some old clown love  
Those that have heard cant describe my bump  
they know something from the beyond in my trunk  
chorus 2x  
Na na na nana na na boom all night  
Na na na nana na na boom all night  
Na na na nana na na boom all night  
Theres something from the beyond in my trunk  
Straight off the freeway and into your city with black swarm of cave bat  
follwing with me they attracted to the hum thatll knock your brain numb  
You keep lookin for the lightin but it aint none when my fuckin bass drops  
the whole block hops everything switch stops clocks and unlock  
You gotta recalculate your computer reset all your clocks and reload all
your shooters  
My woofers blow down trees and then pull em back up  
past the graveyard as the tombstone crack up  
Those that have heard cant describe my bump  
they know theres something from the beyond in my trunk  
chorus 2x  
Na na na nana na na boom all night  
Na na na nana na na boom all night  
Na na na nana na na boom all night  
Theres something from the beyond in my trunk  
Fish jump out the water tryin to swim for the moon  
Vibrational booms drying up the lagoons  
My bumps pop fake titties and melt ice grills  
Relocate your piercings dissolve your pills  
Police wail on they sirens but I blow they tweeters  
Illuminated liquid leaking outta my speakers  
Each drop burns all the way down to the earths core  
dust devils sweep across the earths floor  
Crows and ravens dont flap they wing  
They just float on the waves that the humdrum brings  
Those that have heard cant descibe my bump  
they know something from the beyond in my trunk  
chorus 2x  
Na na na nana na na boom all night  
Na na na nana na na boom all night  
Na na na nana na na boom all night  
Theres something from the beyond in my trunk
