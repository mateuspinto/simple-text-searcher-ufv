In the broad daylight of a Summers day  
On the Cork to Dublin motorway  
Suddenly the singing birds  
Were startled in their song  
In the quiet of that moment  
Our world went out of kilter  
In that split second  
Veronica was gone  
  
But you will never silence her  
Your story will be written  
Her spirit wont rest easy  
Until her job is done  
With fists and boots you broke her bones  
You gunned her down at home  
But as soon as she was able  
She faced you once again  
  
You who made the phone call  
And you who took the message down  
You who hired the hit men  
And you who hatched the plan  
You who drew the money down  
And you who paid it over  
You who remain silent  
You are guilty every one  
  
Chorus  
  
Veronica Veronica Veronica warrior woman  
Veronica Veronica Veronica I offer you this song
