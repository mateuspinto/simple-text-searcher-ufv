Like a stone you watch it fall  
And let it roll out over the fields  
You take your time and watch it crawl  
Like youre the big shot symphony  
But oh what would you say if I told you the pitch is wrong with a smile  
I took a trip to wonderland gonna get you nowhere by a mile  
  
I I could light it up for you  
I I could light it up for you  
We we aint got a shot to lose  
Put it on but fade it out tell you that you werent enough  
Acting like your favorite drug raise a cup  
We can light it up  
We can light it up  
  
I took a shot and missed the mark  
Well every single day I multiply  
A million drums of kerosene  
Baby like a hotel in the sky  
I just want to see all the sparks youre trying to hide  
Lets take a trip to wonderland we can just tune this fire tonight  
  
I I could light it up for you  
I I could light it up for you  
We we aint got a shot to loose  
Put it on but fade it out  
Tell you that you werent enough  
Acting like your favorite drug raise a cup  
We can light it up  
We can light it up
