Many a hand has scaled the grand old face of the plateau  
Some belonged to strangers some to folks you know  
Holy ghosts and talk show hosts are planted in the sand  
To beautify the foothills and shake the many hands  
  
Nothing on top but a bucket and a mop  
And an illustrated book about birds  
See a lot up there but dont be scared  
Who needs action when you got words  
  
Finished with the mop then you can stop  
And look at what youve done  
The plateaus clean no dirt to be seen  
And the work it was fun  
  
Nothing on top but a bucket and a mop  
And an illustrated book about birds  
See a lot up there but dont be scared  
Who needs action when you got words  
  
Many a hand began to scan around for the next plateau  
Some say it was Greenland and some say Mexico  
Others decided it was nowhere except for where they stood  
But those were all just guesses wouldnt help you if they could
