Open the door and adjust my eyes  
The concrete streets are as gray as the skies  
The wind stings my face and this world just melts away  
  
And it brings me back to another place bur memories are such a waste  
You can never go home you left that world behind  
  
Is this the only place  
The only place to go  
Are these tired words the only that we know  
The old familiar taste of the bottle in my hand  
Or is this the only place I can understand  
  
Your whiskey tainted wisdom spills like vomit from your mouth  
The world is closing in and I just gotta get out  
  
Of my head and of this town  
Familiar places are bringing me down  
The truth can be hard to swallow  
When its spit right in your face  
  
I just gotta get out  
Hay
