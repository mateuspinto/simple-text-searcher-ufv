Danger bird he flies alone  
And he rides the wind  
Back to his home  
Although his wings  
Have turned to stone  
  
And we used  
To be so calm  
Now I think  
About you  
All day long  
Cause youve been  
With another man  
Here you are  
And here I am  
  
Thats the moment  
That he cracked  
Long ago in the  
Museum with his  
Friends  
  
The jailbird takes the raps  
And he finds himself  
Spreadeagled on the tracks  
But the training that he learned  
Will get him nowhere fast  
  
And I know we  
Should be free  
But freedoms just  
A prison to me  
Cause I lied  
To keep it kind  
When I left you  
Far behind  
  
With the rain  
Pounding on his  
Back he recalls  
The moment that  
He cracked long  
Ago in the museum  
With his friends  
And like those  
Memories the rain  
Keeps pounding  
Down down down  
  
And though these wings  
Have turned to stone  
I can fly fly fly away  
Watch me fly above the city  
Like a shadow on the sky  
Fly fly fly
