Intro  
Over the mountains and the sea  
Your river runs with love for me  
And I will open up my heart  
And let the Healer set me free  
Im happy to be in the truth  
And I will daily lift my hands  
For I will always sing of  
Of when Your love came down  
  
Chorus  
I could sing of Your love forever x4  
  
Bridge  
Oh I feel like dancing  
Its foolishness I know  
But when the world has seen the light  
They will dance with joy  
Like were dancing now  
  
I could sing of your love forever 5x
