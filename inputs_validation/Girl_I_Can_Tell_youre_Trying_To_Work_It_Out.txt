Girl I can tell youre trying to work it out  
Tryin to get a handle on what life is all about  
Between womenhood and nursery rhymes tryin to find the truth in lovers lies  
Girl I can tell youre trying to work it out  
Girl I can see youre wantin to give it a try  
Taking all the good and the bad the truth and the lies  
Feelings inside you you cant talk about feelings have a way of not comin out  
Girl I can see youre trying to work it out  
 guitar   
Between womenhood and nursery rhymes looking for the truth in lovers lies  
And the ties that bind the things that last through time  
Girl I can tell youre trying to work it out
