One two three  
  
Tell me Im mistaken  
I must be kinda slow  
But the only time you ever cared  
Was when you needed more  easy money easy money  
You got out of control and you sold your soul for easy money  
  
If you see a sucker standing at your door  
Bring him in and make him grin  
Then take him to the store  
Easy money easy money  
Watch out from above  
You broke into the bank of love  
Easy money  
  
Some people never learn to stop when theyve had enough  
Easy money easy money  
Some people only have to shop when the going gets tough  
  
Ive come to the conclusion its like the old man said  
The only thing you gave me was shit and promises  
Easy money whoa whoa whoa easy money  
One day youll have to earn all the money that you burn  
Easy money  
  
Take it Jeff   
  
Easy money  
  
Wha wha yeah  
  
Some people never learn to stop when theyve had enough  
Easy money easy money  
Some people only have to shop when the going gets tough  
  
Funny thing about it  
Dont even make me blue  
Cause theres no better deal around  
Than saying goodbye to you  
Easy money easy money  
  
You snatched that cash right into your stash easy money  
You got out of control and you sold your soul for easy money  
Easy money woo woo woo easy money
