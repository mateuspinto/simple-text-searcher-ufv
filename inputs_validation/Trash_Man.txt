I am your trash man  
Throw out all your trash today  
Clean out your mind today  
Please pass the weed  
And please take some heed  
Take your fast glass guns and  
Throw them away  
There he goes hey  
I just the gypsy bandit  
Gypsy talk  
She has been here 3 times and  
The 4th time she was emptied in from  
The mouth of a bottle  
Seems like I seen you somewhere before  
And her dog named pig had a red  
Neck shaped just like a cracker  
Dipped in rot hole  
Address 3rd trash can from the  
Left thats where Ill be  
Just take all your blues  
And throw them at my feet  
oh thats what friends are for  
Yes I sing the blues for me and you  
Let me do changes and come back  
And tell you so it wont be so hard  
When its time for you to go through  
Anything is possible after an  
Embarrassing situation  
And once you take but all that  
Rubbish and hate and  
Load it on my truck  
But dont make me work late  
I am your trashman  
And dont forget I also want  
To live not just survive  
I aint your black slave just  
Because I just might try to  
Wash out your mind its up to  
Your friend  
To get up off your rusty behind  
And please pass me the peace weed  
And take some heed  
Throw all that mixed up speed  
Away all that dirt is gonna clog and  
Hurt man you reach 100 years old in a day  
I am your trashman  
I am your trashman  
I come to keep your houses clean  
I am the trashman  
Take out all your dirty blues and  
Dreams  
Well when I come around to  
Collect for the bill  
Thats when I come around for  
My pleasure kill  
I am the trashman  
You must have seen me in  
Your tv  
Im here to clean up  
All your hang ups or  
Come downs Im gonna kill  
Thats my duty  
So please dont try to make  
Me crawl up no hill  
May I whisper in your ear  
Say something you ought to hear  
Lots of people so dear  
Theyre getting hurt
