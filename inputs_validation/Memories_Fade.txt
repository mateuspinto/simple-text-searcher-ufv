Theres only need  
I love your need  
So much Im losing me  
I cannot see the reason for the Pain  
With hungry joy  
Ill be your toy  
Just hoping you will play  
Without hope my body starts to fail  
  
Memories fade but the scars still linger  
Goodbye my friend  
Will I ever love again  
Memories fade but the scars still linger  
  
I cannot grow  
I cannot move  
I cannot fell my age  
The vice like grip of tension holds me fast  
Engulfed by you  
What can I do  
When Historys my cage  
Look foward to a future in the past  
  
The more I talk  
The more I say  
The less you seem to hear  
Im speechless in a most peculiar way  
Your mind is weak  
Your need is great  
And nothing is too dear  
For you to use to take the Pain away  
Memories Fade  
No dont pretend you can justify the end  
Memories fade but the scars still linger
