Hey there Mr Lonely Heart if you could find the time  
I would like to sit and talk to see if we could find  
The answer to the mystery of loves most precious seed  
Is it in a touch or in a kiss or simply in the need  
  
Or is it really love itself that always wants to give  
The heart and soul of all of us and everything that lives  
  
Hey there Mr Cold Cold Heart I know I could be wrong  
To think that life could be so sweet and love could be so strong  
As to gather everyone of us like one big family  
To share with one another all we have and all we see  
  
Its true the deepest part of us is everywhere the same  
And that the only differences are really just the names  
  
We can join the childrens song and show them that we care  
Let them know were on their side no matter when or where  
We can free their hearts from fear and hunger reconcile  
We can give a child a chance and give a child a smile  
  
True love is still the answer and we are still the way  
The gift is in the giving and in living what we say  
  
And if you have a lonely heart this song is just for you  
To ask for all that you can give and all that you can do  
Remember that the mystery of loves most precious seed  
  
Is in the heart of all of us true love is all we need  
Its in the heart of all of us true love is all we need  
Within the heart of all of us true love is all we need  
  
Within the heart of all of us true love is all we need  
Within the heart of all of us true love is all we need  
Within the heart of all of us true love is all we need  
Within the heart of all of us true love is all we need
