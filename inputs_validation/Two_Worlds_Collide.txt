She was given the world  
So much that she couldnt see  
And she needed someone to show her  
Who she could be  
And she tried to survive  
Wearing her heart on her sleeve  
And I needed you to believe  
  
Chorus  
You had your dreams I had mine  
You had your fears I was fine  
You showed me what I couldnt find  
When two different worlds collide  
  
She was scared of it all watching from far away  
She was given a role never knew just when to play  
And she tried to survive  
Living her life on her own  
Always afraid of the throne  
You give me strength to find hope  
  
Chorus  
  
She was scared  
Unprepared  
Lost in the dark  
Falling apart  
I can survive  
With you by my side  
Were gonna be alright  
This is what happens when two worlds collide  
  
Chorus  
  
You had your fears I was fine  
You showed me what I couldnt find  
When two different worlds collide  
When two different worlds collide
