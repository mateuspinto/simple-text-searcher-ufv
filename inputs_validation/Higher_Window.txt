For all the times I tried for this  
And every chance at you I missed  
Ive been known to go my way but I confess  
It made me miss you more  
  
I drew my line across the sand  
And set my flag in no mans land  
But here I am the one man band  
With a song thats meant for two  
  
And there is a light from a higher window  
Shining down on you tonight  
And the music floats on the breeze  
Bringing an easier time  
And all of our cards are on the table  
Tell me what you want to do  
Just dont tell me that its too late  
For me to love you  
  
How perfect we were meant to be  
Our warm and silent symmetry  
Its times like these when all all we need  
Is to be reminded  
  
And I have flown a thousand miles  
To empty rooms and crowded isles  
And we went from cathedral bells  
To show and tell and wish you wells  
And I I still look at you and I am blinded I am blinded  
  
Because there is a light from a higher window  
Shining down on us tonight  
And the music floats on the breeze  
From an easier time  
  
And all of our cards are on the table  
Tell me what you want to do  
Just dont tell me that its too late  
Dont tell me that its too late now  
Just dont tell me that its too late  
For me to love you
