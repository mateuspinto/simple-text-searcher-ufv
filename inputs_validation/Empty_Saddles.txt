Empty saddles in the old corral  
Where do ya ride tonight  
Are you rounding up the doggies the strays of long ago  
Are ya on the trail to Buffalo  
Empty saddles in the old corral  
Where do ya ride tonight  
Are there rustlers on the border or a band of Navajo  
Are you heading for the Alamo  
Empty guns covered with rust  
Where do ya talk tonight  
Empty boots covered with dust  
Where do ya walk tonight  
Empty saddles in the old corral  
My tears would be dried tonight  
If youll only say Im lonely as ya carry my old pal  
Empty saddles in the old corral
