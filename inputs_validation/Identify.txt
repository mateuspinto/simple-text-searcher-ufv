Your eyes they send me  
To eternity  
Your heart may cast me down  
To hell  
Again  
But lately its your love  
Its condemnation enough  
  
Identify  
Please Identify  
If its me you want  
Standing by your side  
Identify  
These tears of mine  
Am I lonely Or am I just alive  
  
And what is time to say  
Who and why the test of love  
Your hands were speaking no  
I felt the movement go  
The ice was breaking  
So  
I wonder why  
That Id  
Identify with you  
My life  
Leave me empty and see if I survive  
  
For every questioned hour  
For every second devoured  
You let me wonder you  
Into a myth  
That I  
Missed  
  
Identify  
Please identify  
If its me you want  
Standing by your side  
Identify  
These tears of mine  
Am I lonely or am I just alive  
Am I lonely or am I just alive
