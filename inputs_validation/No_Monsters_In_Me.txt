Gary Golf stops all the clocks  
With night nurse slippers and socks  
He tries to keep this thoughts clean  
By washing with Listerine  
A little peck on the cheek  
In dazed pajamas and sheets  
Keep the light on Im not tired  
I want to read my Dick Francis  
Dirty Frauleins and nasty Nazis  
There are no monsters in me  
  
Car alarms letting off steam  
Gary hears them in his dreams  
Panic outside is seeping in  
Just easylistening to him  
Turns in his sleep and smiles to himself  
There are no monsters in me  
Cause Garrys out on the Green  
No growing pains for him  
Gary Golf Ball Eyes is not in
