I set out on a narrow way many years ago  
Hoping I would find true love along the broken road  
But I got lost a time or two  
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through  
I couldnt see how every sign pointed straight to you  
  
That every long lost dream lead me to where you are  
Others who broke my heart they were like northern stars  
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms  
This much I know is true  
That God blessed the broken road  
That led me straight to you  
Yes it did  
  
I think about the years I spent just passing through  
Id like to have the time I lost and give it back to you  
But you just smile and take my hand  
Youve been there you understand  
Its all part of a grander plan that is coming true  
  
Every long lost dream led me to where you are  
And others who broke my heart they were like northern stars  
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms  
This much I know its true  
That God blessed the broken road  
That led me straight to you  
Yeah  
  
And now Im rolling home  
Into your loving arms  
This much I know is true  
That God blessed the broken road  
That led me straight to you  
  
That God blessed the broken road  
Ooh ooh  
That led me straight to you
