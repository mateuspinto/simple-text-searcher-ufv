Oh Alabama  
The devil fools with the best laid plan  
Swing low Alabama  
You got spare change  
You got to feel strange  
And now the moment is all that it meant  
  
Alabama you got the weight on your shoulders  
Thats breaking your back  
Your Cadillac has got a wheel in the ditch  
And a wheel on the track  
  
Oh Alabama  
Banjos playing through the broken glass  
Windows down in Alabama  
See the old folks tied in white ropes  
Hear the banjo  
Dont it take you down home  
  
Alabama you got the weight on your shoulders  
Thats breaking your back  
Your Cadillac has got a wheel in the ditch  
And a wheel on the track  
  
Oh Alabama  
Can I see you and shake your hand  
Make friends down in Alabama  
Im from a new land  
I come to you and see all this ruin  
What are you doing Alabama  
You got the rest of the union to help you along  
Whats going wrong
