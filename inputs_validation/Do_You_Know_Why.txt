We use to say our love will stay until the cows come home  
And then the cows came home do you know why  
We use to say well love this way till Hades freezes over  
And then it just froze over do you know why  
  
We thought we had a future dancing a jig for us  
Do you suppose our little dream got too big for us  
We use to say our love will stay  
Forever and a night and now forevers gone  
Darling do you know why Neither do I
