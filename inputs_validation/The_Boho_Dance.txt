Down in the cellar in the Boho zone  
I went looking for some sweet inspiration oh well  
Just another hardtime band  
With Negro affectations  
I was a hopeful in rooms like this  
When I was working cheap  
Its an old romancethe Boho dance  
It hasnt gone to sleep  
  
But even on the scuffle  
The cleaners press was in my jeans  
And any eye for detail  
Caught a little lace along the seams  
  
And you were in the parking lot  
Subterranean by your own design  
The virtue of your style inscribed  
On your contempt for mine  
Jesus was a beggar he was rich in grace  
And Solomon kept his head in all his glory  
Its just that some steps outside the Boho dance  
Have a fascination for me  
  
A camera pans the cocktail hour  
Behind a blind of potted palms  
And finds a lady in a Paris dress  
With runs in her nylons  
  
You read those books where luxury  
Comes as a guest to take a slave  
Books where artists in noble poverty  
Go like virgins to the grave  
Dont you get sensitive on me  
Cause I know youre just too proud  
You couldnt step outside the Boho dance now  
Even if good fortune allowed  
  
Like a priest with a pornographic watch  
Looking and longing on the sly  
Sure its stricken from your uniform  
But you cant get it out of your eyes  
  
Nothing is capsulized in me  
On either side of town  
The streets were never really mine  
Not mine these glamour gowns
