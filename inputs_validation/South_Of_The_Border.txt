South of the border down Mexico way  
Thats where they fell in love  
When stars above  
Came out to play  
And now as they wander their thoughts ever stray  
South of the border down Mexico way  
  
She was a picture in old Spanish lace  
Just for a tender while  
He kissed the smile  
Upon her face  
For it was Fiesta and they were so gay  
South of the border down Mexico way  
  
Then she sighed as she whispered maana  
Never dreaming that they were parting  
And he lied as he whispered maana  
For that tomorrow never came  
  
South of the border he rode back one day  
There in a veil of white  
By candlelight  
She knelt to pray  
The mission bells told him that he mustnt stay  
South of the border down Mexico way  
  
Ayayayay ayayayay  
Ayayayay ayayayay
