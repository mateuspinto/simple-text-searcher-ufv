Chorus Surely the presence of the Lord is in this place surely the presence
of the Lord is in this place surely you wont forsake the ones who seek your
face surely the presence of the Lord is in this place

with singing we are changed as we welcome the heart of the Master and the
heavenlies are ringing out with praise in one accord praise praise to the Lord
oh oh oh
