Oh they call me Doctor Brown  
They call me that lovin man  
Oh they call me Doctor Brown  
They call me that lovin man  
And if you got some trouble  
Come around and see what you can  
  
You dont have no prescription  
You dont have to take no pills  
You dont have no prescription  
And baby dont have to take no pills  
If you come to see me  
Doctor Brown will cure your ills  
  
Oh ask any woman in my neighborhood  
You just ask any woman in my neighborhood  
  
You just ask any woman  
In my neighborhood  
You just ask any woman  
In my neighborhood  
If Doctor Brown dont cure you  
Nobody can do you no good  
  
Yes you dont have no prescription  
And baby you dont have to take no pills  
You dont have no prescription  
And baby you dont have to take no pills  
You just come around to see me  
And Doctor Brown will cure your ills
