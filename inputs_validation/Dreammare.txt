Grinning demons smiling sideways  
Laughing in my face  
Here within my troubled sleep  
Theres such a lonely place  
Running fast but never moving  
I cant get away  
Strange but realistic objects  
Making me their prey  
  
Then its gone as fast as it came  
Evil dream  
Changing like the sun turn to rain  
It would seem  
  
La la la la la  
  
Dining with the gods of beauty  
On a distant shore  
Tasting fruits of untold sweetness  
Never seen before  
Dancing stars with crystal voices  
Beckon with their eyes  
Unicorn of many colours  
Rides to paradise  
  
Then its gone as fast as it came  
Peaceful scene  
Changing like the sun turns to rain  
It would seem  
  
La la la la la  
  
Sleepless nights that last a lifetime  
Crucify my head  
Dreams of peace and then disaster  
Wish that I were dead  
Looking for the end of darkness  
Seeking out the day  
For escape with speed unthought of  
Bearing me away  
  
Then its gone as fast as it came  
Peaceful scene  
Changing like the sun turns to rain  
It would seem  
  
La la la la la  
  
Come into my dream
