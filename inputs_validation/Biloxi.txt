Down around Biloxi  
Pretty girls are dancin in the sea  
They all look like sisters in the ocean  
The boy will fill his pail with salty water  
And the storms will blow from off towards New Orleans  
  
Sun shines on Biloxi  
Air is filled with vapors from the sea  
Boy will dig a pool beside the ocean  
He sees creatures from his dream underwater  
And the sun will set from off towards New Orleans  
  
Stars can see Biloxi  
Stars can find their faces in the sea  
We are walking down beside the ocean  
We are splashing naked in the water  
And the sky is red from off towards New Orleans  
And the sky is red from off towards New Orleans  
  
Down around Biloxi  
Pretty girls are swimming in the sea  
They all look like sisters in the ocean  
The boy will fill his pail with salty water  
And the storms will blow from off toward New Orleans
