You told me youd always stay you told me  
You told me youd never stray you told me  
All these things you said you said sincerely  
Still I am leaving you in spite of what you told me  
  
Ive heard things that did not match what you told me  
And of your love that would not last as you told me  
Forwarned is forearmed it hurts Im leaving  
I may be wrong I cant love what Im just hearing  
  
Times have made me shy  
Of all the things youre saying  
Time have made me shy  
Of girls and all the games they are playing  
  
Someday I may see the truth of what you told me  
I may find I left too soon and that you told me  
Only things that you were honestly feeling  
I must have more to love than what you told me  
  
Yes I must have more to love than what you told me  
Yes I must have more to love than what you told me
