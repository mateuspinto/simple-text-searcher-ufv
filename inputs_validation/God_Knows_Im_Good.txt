Was walking through the counters of a national concern  
And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder  
  
And I saw the multitude of faces honest rich and clean  
As the merchandise exchanged and money roared  
And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak  
Into the paper bag at her side  
And her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed  
So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind  
  
Crying  
God knows Im good  
God knows Im good  
God knows Im good  
God may look the other way today  
  
God knows Im good  
God knows Im good  
God knows Im good  
God may look the other way today  
  
Then she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag  
Perspiration trickled down her forehead  
And her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder  
She was led away bewildered and amazed  
Through her deafened ears the cash machines were shrieking on the counter  
As her escort asked her softly  
For her name  
And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady  
Who had fainted to the whirling  
Wooden floor  
  
Crying  
God knows Im good  
God knows Im good  
God knows Im good  
Surely God wont look  
The other way  
  
God knows Im good  
God knows Im good  
God knows Im good  
Surely God wont look  
The other way
