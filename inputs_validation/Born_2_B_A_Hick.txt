See I was born a little pieeyed motherfucker  
Mama she left me and my papa was a hard trucker  
Out on the highway we loved to roll  
He never made me go to school  
  
I never begged to go  
I was a low class livin raised out in the sticks  
I was born to be a hick  
See I love to spend my days just a squirrel huntin  
  
Go see my cousin Ellie May and get some good lovin  
Kissin and huggin on some distant lands  
People always tell me Im a twisted man  
Jim Beam in my hand boones kegged in shit  
  
And I was born to be a hick  
Ohh I was born to be a hick  
  
See I love to spend my days just a squirrel hunter  
Go see my cousin Ellie May and get some good lovin  
Kissin and huggin on some distant lands  
People always tell me Im a twisted man  
Jim Beam in my hand boones kegged in shit  
  
And I was born to be a hick  
See I was born to be a hick man  
Yeah I was born to be a hick man  
Yeah yeah yeah

Im a John Deere drivin  
Im a hick
