Its funny how nothing seems much fun  
Anymore to me now that I quit the drink  
Cause soberness it might be what I need  
But its certainly not how I want to be  
  
Nothing seems much fun anymore to me  
  
Consequence never had anytime to think  
About what coulda shoulda happen to me  
seeCommon sense my parents said I  
Never had any but now look whose  
Got the dough  
  
No longer born to lose  
Put away my party shoes  
Missin the alcohol  
Dont feel like goin out  
Nothing worth singin about  
Missin the alcohol  
Without tonic n gin  
Without no vicodin  
  
Nothing seems much fun anymore to me Repeat x4
