Daddys baby whats got you thinking  
Whats got you sinking so low  
Is there something I should know  
Something new to you  
Daddys baby fussing and fretting  
Keeping on getting it wrong  
  
She can only last so long  
So sing her a lullabybye  
Baby dont like to cry  
So sing her a lullabybye  
Swaddle and swing her  
Sing her a lullaby  
  
She makes her feelings known to me  
Her every side is shown to me  
And in our time alone  
Our love has surely grown of its own  
Silent as a stepping stone  
Silently as the dawn was breaking  
Soft and clear and my tears were dry  
And my tears had flown  
So I called my love my home
