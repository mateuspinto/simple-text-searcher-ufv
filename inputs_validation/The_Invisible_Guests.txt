Late that night I awoke from My sleep  
Hearing unknown voices laughing  
Insane  
Grandma was one Oh its coming  
From the room next to mine  
Its Grandma room the invisible  
Guests  
As I stood there alone in the dark  
Peeking through the keyhole couldnt  
Believe My eyes  
Id never seen anything like it only  
Grandma was inside the room  
Speaking to no one the invisible  
Guests  
Cups were rising in thin air and then  
Emptied on the floor  
Suddenly the door was open and  
Grandma said  
Do come in My little friend  
Missy and Mother were sleeping  
Downstairs  
If they could see me in Grandmothers  
Chair  
  
  
  
  
Grandmother said look Me deep in  
The eyes  
You will forget what You saw here  
Tonight  
I will let You in on the secret of this  
House  
The secret of Amon thats what we  
Call this house  
Now I want you to go back to sleep  
Now go back to sleep My dear  
The invisible guests  
  
  
  
  
Cups were rising in thin air and then  
Emptied on the floor  
Suddenly the door was open and  
Grandma said  
Now you must go back to sleep  
Go to sleep Go to sleep  
Go to sleep  
Missy and Mother were sleeping  
Downstairs  
If they could see me in Grandmothers  
Chair
