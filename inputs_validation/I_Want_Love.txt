I want love but its impossible  
A man like me so irresponsible  
A man like me is dead in places  
Other men feel liberated  
  
I cant love shot full of holes  
Dont feel nothing I just feel cold  
Dont feel nothing just old scars  
Toughening up around my heart  
  
But I want love just a different kind  
I want love wont break me down  
Wont brick me up wont fence me in  
I want a love that dont mean a thing  
Thats the love I want I want love  
  
I want love on my own terms  
After everything Ive ever learned  
Me I carry too much baggage  
Oh man Ive seen so much traffic  
  
But I want love just a different kind  
I want love wont break me down  
Wont brick me up wont fence me in  
I want a love that dont mean a thing  
Thats the love I want I want love  
  
So bring it on Ive been bruised  
Dont give me love thats clean and smooth  
Im ready for the rougher stuff  
No sweet romance Ive had enough  
  
A man like me is dead in places  
Other men feel liberated  
  
But I want love just a different kind  
I want love wont break me down  
Wont brick me up wont fence me in  
I want a love that dont mean a thing  
Thats the love I want I want love  
  
I want love just a different kind  
I want love wont break me down  
Wont brick me up wont fence me in  
I want a love that dont mean a thing  
Thats the love I want I want love
