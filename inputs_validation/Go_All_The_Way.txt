Chorus  
Go all the way  
It feels so right feels so right  
Being with you here tonight  
Please go all the way  
Just hold me close hold me close  
Dont ever let me go  
  
I couldnt say what I wanted to say  
Till she whispered I love you  
  
Chorus  
So please go all the way  
It feels so right feels so right  
Being with you here tonight  
Please go all the way  
Just hold me close hold me close  
Dont ever let me go  
  
Before her love I was cruel and mean  
I had a hole in the place  
Where my heart should have been  
But now Ive changed  
And it feels so strange  
I come alive when she does  
All those things to me  
And she says  
  
Come on come on  
Come on come on  
Come on come on  
Come on come on  
  
I need you come on  
I love you come on  
I need you come on  
  
Chorus  
Please go all the way  
It feels so right feels so right  
Being with you here tonight  
Please go all the way  
Just hold me close hold me close  
Dont ever let me go
