Daylight falls upon the path the forest falls behind  
Today I am not prey to dark uncertainty  
The shadow trembles in its wrath Ive robbed its blackness blind  
And tasted sunlight as my fear came clear to me  
  
I think I understand  
Fear is like a wilderland  
Stepping stones or sinking sand  
  
Now the way leads to the hills above the steeples chime  
Below me sleepy rooftops round the harbor  
Its there Ill take my thirsty fill of friendship over wine  
Forgetting fear but never disregarding her  
  
Oh I think I understand  
Fear is like a wilderland  
Stepping stones and sinking sand  
  
Sometimes voices in the night will call me back again  
Back along the pathway of a troubled mind  
When forests rise to block the light that keeps a traveler sane  
Ill challenge them with flashes from a brighter time  
  
Oh I think I understand  
Fear is like a wilderland  
Stepping stones or sinking sand
