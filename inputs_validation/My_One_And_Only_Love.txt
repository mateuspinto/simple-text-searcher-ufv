The very thought of you makes my heart sing  
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring  
And you appear in all your splendor  
My one and only love  
  
The shadows fall and spreads their mystique charms  
In the hush of night while youre in my arms  
I feel your lips so warm and tender yes  
My one and only love  
  
The touch of your hand is like heaven  
A heaven that Ive never known  
The blush on your cheek whenever I speak  
Tell me that you in are my own baby  
  
You fill my eager heart with such desire  
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire  
I give myself in sweet surrender baby  
My one and only love  
  
Baby you fill my eager heart with such desire  
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire  
I give myself in sweet surrender baby  
My one and only love yes  
My one and my only love
