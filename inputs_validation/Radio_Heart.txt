I lose myself in the night  
Walking the streets in the rain  
I turn away from the light  
To find the shadows again  
I see her face in the window  
I feel the touch of her hand  
I hear her voice say I need you  
I guess I cant understand  
Radio Heart  
Play a sad song for me  
One fom the heart  
So shell come back for me  
Radio Heart  
Send her my love for me  
I hear a sound in the night  
Could be the turn of a key  
And when I switch on the light  
Its you Im hoping to see  
Imagination  
You play a cruel cool game  
Imagination  
You leave me calling her name  
Radio Heart  
Play a sad song for me  
One from the heart  
So shell come back for me  
The morning after  
I find no inspiration  
No love no laughter  
Just my imagination
