White Lightnin  
Written by S Wooley  
  
Well in North Carolina way back in the hills  
Lived my old pappy and he had him a still  
He brewed white lightnin til the sun went down  
Then hed fill him a jug and hed pass it around  
Mighty mighty pleasin pappys corn squeezin  
Whshhhoooh  White lightnin  
  
Chorus  
Well the G men T men revenuers too  
Searchin for the place where he made his brew  
They were looking tryin to book him  
But my pappy kept acookin  
Whshhhoooh  White lightnin  
  
Well I asked my old pappy why he called his brew  
White lightnin stead of mountain dew  
I took a little sip and right away I knew  
As my eyes bugged out and my face turned blue  
Thunder started flashin lightnin started clashin  
Whshhhoooh  White lightnin  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Well a city slicker came and he said Im tough  
I think I wanna taste that powerful stuff  
He took one slug and drank it on down  
And I heard him a moanin as he hit the ground  
Thunder started flashin lightnin started clashin  
Mmmmm White lightnin  
  
repeat chorus
