Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit  
Blessed is the lamb whose blood flows  
Blessed are the sat upon Spat upon Ratted on  
O Lord Why have you forsaken me  
I got no place to go  
Ive walked around Soho for the last night or so  
Ah but it doesnt matter no  
  
Blessed is the land and the kingdom  
Blessed is the man whose soul belongs to  
Blessed are the meth drinkers Pot sellers Illusion dwellers  
O Lord Why have you forsaken me  
My words trickle down like a wound  
That I have no intention to heal  
  
Blessed are the stained glass window pane glass  
Blessed is the church service makes me nervous  
Blessed are the penny rookers Cheap hookers Groovy lookers  
O Lord Why have you forsaken me  
I have tended my own garden  
Much too long
