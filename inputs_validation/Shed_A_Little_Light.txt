Let us turn our thoughts today  
To Martin Luther King  
And recognize that there are ties between us  
All men and women living on the Earth  
Ties of hope and love  
Sister and brotherhood  
That we are bound together  
In our desire to see the world  
Become a place in which our children  
Can grow free and strong  
We are bound together by the task  
That stands before us  
And the road that lies ahead  
We are bound and we are bound  
  
There is a feeling like the clenching of a fist  
There is a hunger in the center of the chest  
There is a passage through the darkness  
And the mist  
And though the body sleeps  
The heart will never rest  
  
Shed a little light oh Lord  
So that we can see  
Just a little light oh Lord  
Want to stand it on up  
Stand it on up oh Lord  
Want to walk it on down  
Shed a little light oh Lord  
  
Cant get no light from the dollar bill  
Dont give me no light from a TV screen  
When I open my eyes I want to drink my fill  
From the well on the hill  
Do you know what I mean  
  
Shed a little light oh Lord  
So that we can see  
Just a little light oh Lord  
Want to stand it on up  
Stand it on up oh Lord  
Want to walk it on down  
Shed a little light oh Lord  
  
There is a feeling like the clenching of a fist  
There is a hunger in the center of the chest  
There is a passage through the darkness  
And the mist  
And though the body sleeps  
The heart will never rest  
  
Oh Let us turn our thoughts today  
To Martin Luther King  
And recognize that there are ties between us  
All men and women living on the Earth  
Ties of hope and love  
Sister and brotherhood
