If I dont think about the fact that she left me  
If I dont see the pearls fall from the sky  
If I dont hear the accusations of blasphemy  
If I dont feel the tears in my eyes  
This is the best day of my life  
You say ull call me and then and then you dont  
Ill want 2 kiss you and then I wont  
We both do nothing and call it love  
Is this love  
Is this love  
  
This morning I wanted a cup of coffee  
But I didnt have any cream  
Last night I wanted some inspiration  
But I didnt have any dreams  
Coupled with the fact that you belong 2 another  
Whose name is selfrighteousness  
So evil girl if one of us has a date  
With the undertaker which one will it be  
You can cry 4 ever but ull get no sympathy  
This is the best day of my life  
  
Ive got 3 chains o gold  
And they will shine 4 ever  
They are the nucleus of my soul  
Melt down no they will never  
  
Ive got 3 chains o gold  
And they will shine 4 ever  
They are the nucleus of my soul  
Melt down no they will never  
  
Give back the chains  if you dont you will die  
Nothing should come between you and I  
  
Ive got 3 chains o gold  
And they will shine 4 ever  
If one of us has 2 go  
You will go before me  
  
If one of us has 2 go 3 chains o gold  
You will go before me  
3 chains o gold  
You will go before me baby they will shine 4 ever  
Cuz I sho nuff say you will  
  
3 chains o gold  
you will go before me  
you will go before me  
you will go before me  
you will go before me  
  
Ive got 3 chains o gold  
They gonna shine  
  
Forever forever forever  
  
3 chains o gold
