Staring at the ceiling the roof has a face  
Its telling me I dont belong with the human race  
Hes askin me to join him in eternal sleep  
I give him my soul my body he can keep  
Reaching just above me  I see my pillows there  
But yet I have no head my head is on the chair  
Im staing at my body I look as if Im weak  
So give me back my soul my body you can keep  
Sitting on my lawn tts just before dawn  
I listen to the screaming another life is gone  
Im playing with the children children of the dead  
My mother says their evil my daddy he gives a shit  
Their eyeballs are bloody their skin is ever pale  
Their askin me to follow I shall I shall  
They dress me as a clown Im screamin as a loon  
We dance upon the cemetery underneath the moon  
Here I come there I go Im a night walker  
Im starin at you sleepin through your window like a stalker  
Im taping on the glass I lick it with my tongue  
I notice that the house is vacant Im starin at no one  
I must of fell asleep I woke up on the floor  
Underneath the carpet underneath the boards  
Im gaged with a dead rat I lay for many weeks  
The rat comes back to life and is chewing on my cheeks  
Mental Warp  
My brain is gone my brain is gone  
say no more my brain is gone 4x  
Coming is my helper tangling my brain  
Somethings wery wrong I cant describe this pain  
Im calling for my mother Im crawling up the stairs  
My mothers laughing at me and shes been dead for years  
Im falling down the stair case tumble to the floor  
I land up in the attic next to the cellar door  
Im play with the pigons they tell me many lies  
They tell me Ill have wings if I let them peck my eyes  
I hear a womans voice calling from the dirt  
I plat my little seed and slowly she will spurt  
And now she is a tree I hear the heart pound  
I take her in my arems and we make love to the sound  
The wind is my ebony blowing evil thoughts  
Carrying the demons soring with the hearts  
I put it in my body the wind will bring the rain  
Only lay its demon egg deep inside my brain  
Theyre calling me a killer I cant say that Im not  
My daddys tried to kill me ever since I was a tot  
By poisoning my bottle I feed it to my friend  
cause if he dies my buddy our friendship will never end  
Im sitting with the darkness talking to the dark  
Its singing lullabies and stringing on the harp  
I notice that the floor is warm and rather sick  
Its cause Im sitting in my stomach  
Mental Warp  
My brain is gone my brain is gone  
say no more my brain is gone 8x
