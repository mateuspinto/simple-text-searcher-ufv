I dig the black girls  
Oh so much more than the white girls  
I was so pleased to learn they were faster  
Siest siest siest vous Im after  
  
All comes a faggot white boy  
Said look look look first kind of joy  
They come around so queer and quiet  
As I rebel and riot  
  
Shall I dig the white boys  
All so much more that the black boys  
I was so pleased to learn theyre not smarter  
Go on give give give it to me harder  
Harder harder just say harder  
  
You know I love the Lord of hosts  
the Father Son and the Holy Ghost  
I was so pleased to learn that hes inside me  
In my time of trouble he will hide me  
  
I dig the black girls  
I dig the black girls  
I dig the black girls  
I dig the black girls
