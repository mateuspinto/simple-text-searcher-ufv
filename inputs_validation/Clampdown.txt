What are we gonna do now  
Taking off his turban they said is this man a jew  
cause theyre working for the clampdown  
They put up a poster saying we earn more than you  
When were working for the clampdown  
We will teach our twisted speech  
To the young believers  
We will train our blueeyed men  
To be young believers  
  
The judge said five to tenbut I say double that again  
Im not working for the clampdown  
No man born with a living soul  
Can be working for the clampdown  
Kick over the wall cause governments to fall  
How can you refuse it  
Let fury have the hour anger can be power  
Dyou know that you can use it  
  
The voices in your head are calling  
Stop wasting your time theres nothing coming  
Only a fool would think someone could save you  
The men at the factory are old and cunning  
You dont owe nothing so boy get runnin  
Its the best years of your life they want to steal  
  
You grow up and you calm down  
Youre working for the clampdown  
You start wearing the blue and brown  
Youre working for the clampdown  
So you got someone to boss around  
It makes you feel big now  
You drift until you brutalize  
You made your first kill now  
  
In these days of evil presidentes  
Working for the clampdown  
But lately one or two has fully paid their due  
For working for the clampdown  
But ha gitalong gitalong  
  
And Ive given away no secrets  
Whos barmy now
