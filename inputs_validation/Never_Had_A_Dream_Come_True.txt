I never never had a dream come true  
In my every dream Im loved by you  
And were free as the wind  
And true love is no sin  
Therefore men are men not machines  
I never never had a dream come true  
Without you the world out there is painted shades of blue  
Since our roads never crossed  
I work just to please the boss  
Think I might as well get lost in my dreams  
Do do do do do  
I never never had a dream come true  
Yes Im gonna dream about you baby my whole life through  
Seems my folks are ashamed  
Said I aint worth a thing  
But Im glad Im chained to my dreams  
Do do do do do  
Keep on dreamin  
Sing along with me  
Keep on dreamin
