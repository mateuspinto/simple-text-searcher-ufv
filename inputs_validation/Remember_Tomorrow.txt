Unchain the colours before my eyes  
Yesterdays sorrows tomorrows white lies  
Scan the horizon the clouds take me higher  
I shall return from out of fire  
Tears for remembrance and tears for joy  
Tears for somebody and this lonely boy  
Out in the madness the all seeing eye  
Flickers above us to light up the sky  
Unchain the colours before my eyes  
Yesterdays sorrows tomorrows white lies  
Scan the horizon the clouds take me higher  
I shall return from out of fire
