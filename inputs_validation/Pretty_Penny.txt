Have you seen your mother girl Has she gone away  
Gone away and found the pearl  
But the price she paid  
  
Gone  When you wake in the morning  
Gone  When you find that theres no one sleeping  
Gone  Pretty Penny was her name  
She was loved and we all will miss her  
  
How far will you go I say just to bait a mouse  
Shorter lived and longer gone  
Can you figure out  
  
Gone  When you wake in the morning  
Gone  When you find that theres no one sleeping  
Gone  Pretty Penny was her name  
She was loved and we all will miss her  
  
Have you lost your sister girl Shes all but blown away  
Blown away and lost the pearl  
And the price she paid  
  
Gone  When you wake in the morning  
Gone  When you find that theres no one sleeping  
Gone  Pretty Penny was her name  
She was loved and we all will miss her
