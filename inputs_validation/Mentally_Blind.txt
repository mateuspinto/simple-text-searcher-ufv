You see your vision and no one elses  
Your every word filled with sarcasm  
Crucify people with invisible knowledge  
Verbal destruction with each compulsion  
We will see where you go  
The future for you is nowhere  
Every minute a cliche of your kind  
Too much to say from a person with no respect  
Your accusations you will regret  
From the mentally blind come ideas that are poison  
Take away the power a shallow person you will find  
  
What would you do without your pathetic narrowminded approach to life  
that reflects your lack of abilities  
Your opinions are selfdestructive  
Despair is your gain delight is corruption  
Destined to fall prey to your stories  
creating problems for your consumption  
We will see where you go  
The future for you is nowhere  
Every minute a cliche of your kind  
Too much to say from a person with no respect  
Your accusations you will regret  
From the mentally blind come ideas that are poison  
Take away the power a shallow person you will find
