Did you ever have a dream or two  
Where the hero is a guy named you  
And the things he does are just too much  
Does he fly like Mr Superman speak Chinese French and Dutch  
And did you ever have a dream or two  
Have you ever woken up one day  
With the feeling that youd been away  
If the girl that you dreamed of last night  
Had the same dream in the very same scene  
With the very same boy hold tight  
Its a very special knowledge that youve got my friend  
You can travel anywhere with anyone you care  
Its a very special knowledge that youve got my friend  
You can walk around in New York while you sleep in Penge  
I will travel round the world one night  
On the magic wings of astral flight  
If youve got the secret tell me do  
Have you ever had a dream or two  
Have you ever had a dream or two
