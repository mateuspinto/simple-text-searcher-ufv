The longer I look at you  
The fairer you become  
Every time I hear your voice  
Sweeter is the song  
  
Each glanced borrowed from your eyes  
Deeper is the story  
Wind burns your sleeping breath  
And waters become one  
  
Longer I look at you  
The fairer you become  
  
Your hair brushed me lightly  
Twice before we met  
Years between familiar moments  
Heaven since  
  
Memories like photographs  
Never knew were taken  
Sun drenched snows from separate hills  
Their waters become one  
  
The longer I look at you  
The fairer you become  
  
The longer I look at you  
The fairer
