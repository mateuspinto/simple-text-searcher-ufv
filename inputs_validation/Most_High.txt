I want to see Your face  
I want to know Your ways  
Let Your light shine upon us  
  
I want to know Your power  
Come fill me once again  
And lift me up in Your hands of grace  
  
And put a new song in my mouth of praise to You  
And the world will see and fear Your name  
And put a new song in my mouth of praise to You  
And the world will see and fear Your name  
  
Worthy worthy is the Lord  
Worthy worthy is the Lord  
Worthy worthy is the Lord most high  
  
I want to know Your power  
Come fill me once again  
And lift me up in Your hands of grace  
  
Put a new song in my mouth of praise to You  
And the world will see and fear Your name  
Put a new song in my mouth of praise to You  
And the world will see and fear Your name  
  
Worthy worthy is the Lord  
Worthy worthy is the Lord  
Worthy worthy is the Lord most high  
  
Worthy worthy is the Lord  
Worthy worthy is the Lord  
Worthy worthy is the Lord most high  
  
And put a new song in my mouth of praise to You  
And the world will see and fear Your name  
And put a new song in my mouth of praise to You  
And the world will see and fear Your name  
  
Worthy worthy is the Lord
