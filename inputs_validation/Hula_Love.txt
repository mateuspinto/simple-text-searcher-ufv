On the isle of Filla Lilla out Hawaii way  
A hula maiden gay strolled by on moonlit bay  
There came to court her over the water from a savage Zinga Zululand  
A bolo chieftain grand sang her this lay  
And he sang hula Hawaii hula smile on your zing gang a zula  
Moonshine above on our sweet jungle love  
For you my bolo is swinging for you my love song Im singing  
Come be my hula hula love  
 steel   
But the chieftain from the peaceful Filla Lilla land  
Would not give him her hand her love took his stand  
Through the rattle of the battle as she heard his sweet voice calm and true  
They fled in his canoe oer waters blue  
And he sang hula  
And he sang hula  
Hula love hula love hula love
