Love like a rose in bloom  
All of the Rainbow Children will feel it soon  
To the east word traveled about this energy  
Until it reached the Banished Ones  
Who just wanted this love to cease  
  
They now fallen in to  
The Resistors dream  
And they built a Digital Garden  
Or so it seemed  
  
In this brilliant darkness  
Socalled angels of light  
Lies lies lies lies lies  
  
And all the Rainbow Children  
Will stand and fight  
For everlasting everlasting life  
For the one who sits on the right  
For Him were willing to do the work  
  
The Banished Ones approaching the palace shouted obscenities  
They tried to confuse the Rainbow Children and dethrone their king  
Using the lies promoted by the whose papers hellavisions and scagazines  
The Banished Ones constructed a Digital Garden around the palace  
That extended throughout the world  
Furthermore they demanded compensation  
For their time spent in the palace before the exile  
This was noise So be it said the Wise One  
And gladly obliged with an invisible deed  
The Banished Ones accepted and returned to their place of birth in Mendacity  
As for the Rainbow Children they began deconstructing the Digital Garden  
Door to door they went in search of those willing to do The Work
