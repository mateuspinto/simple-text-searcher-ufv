Since the beginning of time  
Since it started to rain  
Since I heard you laugh  
Since I felt your pain  
I was too young you were much younger  
We were afraid of each others hunger  
  
I have always loved you  
Theres never been anyone else  
I knew you before I knew myself  
Oh my baby I have always loved you  
  
Since we kissed the first time  
Since we slept on the beach  
You were too close for comfort  
You were too far out of reach  
You walked away I should have held you  
Would you have stayed for me to tell you  
  
I have always loved you  
Theres never been anyone else  
I knew you before I knew myself  
Oh my baby I have always loved you  
Years go by in a matter of days  
And though we go separate ways  
I never stop dreaming of you  
I have always loved you  
  
When you call it makes me cry  
We never made time for you and I  
If I could live it all again  
Id never let it end Id still be with you  
Oh God I miss you  
  
I have always loved you  
Theres never been anyone else  
I knew you before I knew myself  
Oh my baby I have always loved you  
Years go by in a matter of days  
And though we go separate ways  
I never stop dreaming of you  
I have always loved you
