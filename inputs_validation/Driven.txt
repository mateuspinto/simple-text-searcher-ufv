Driven up and down in circles  
Skidding down a road of black ice  
Staring in and out storm windows  
Driven to a fools paradise  
  
But its my turn to drive  
  
Driven to the margin of error  
Driven to the edge of control  
Driven to the margin of terror  
Driven to the edge of a deep dark hole  
  
Driven day and night in circles  
Spinning like a whirlwind of leaves  
Stealing in and out back alleys  
Driven to another den of thieves  
  
But its my turn to drive  
  
Driven in  Driven to the edge  
Driven out  On the thin end of the wedge  
Driven off  By things Ive never seen  
Driven on  By the road to somewhere Ive never been  
  
Its my turn to drive  
  
The road unwinds towards me  
What was there is gone  
The road unwinds before me  
And I go riding on
