Well she was just seventeen  
And you know what I mean  
And the way she looked was way beyond compare  
So how could I dance with another  
And I saw her standing there  
Well she looked at me and I I could see  
That before too long Id fall in love with her  
She wouldnt dance with another  
Since I saw her standin there  
Well my heart went boom  
When I crossed that room  
And I held her hand in mine  
Well we danced through the night  
And we held each other tight  
And before too long I fell in love with her  
Now Ill never dance with another  
Since I saw her standing there
