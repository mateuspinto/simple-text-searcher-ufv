The sound of breathing  
Protect the disease in me she says  
The sound of breathing  
I have never known fear like this before  
  
I remember  
The Beautiess old but still as good she said  
I remember  
That I woke up in a cold dark room again  
  
We are new men  
Were the service the pleasure skin  
We are new men  
No words no image no hope and fame  
  
No shelter  
You could feel the bitch outside the door  
No shelter  
She said nothing is leaving here alive
