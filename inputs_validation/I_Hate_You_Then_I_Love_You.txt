Id like to run away from you  
But if I were to leave you I would die  
Id like to break the chains you put  
Around me  
And yet Ill never try  
No matter what you do you drive me  
Crazy  
Id rather be alone  
But then I know my life would be so  
Empty  
As soon as you were gone  
Impossible to live with you  
But I could never live without you  
For whatever you do  
For whatever you do  
  
I never never never  
Want to be in love with anyone but you  
You make me sad  
You make me strong  
You make me mad  
You make me long for you  
You make me long for you  
  
You make me live  
You make me die  
You make me laugh  
You make me cry for you  
You make me cry for you  
I hate you  
Then I love you  
Then I love you  
Then I hate you  
Then I love you more  
For whatever you do  
I never never never  
Want to be in love with anyone but you  
You treat me wrong  
You treat me right  
You let me be  
You make me fight with you  
I could never live without you  
  
You make me high  
You bring me down  
You set me free  
You hold me bound to you  
I hate you  
Then I love you  
Then I love you  
Then I hate you  
Then I love you more  
I love you more  
For whatever you do  
For whatever you do  
  
I never never never  
Want to be in love with anyone but you  
I never never never  
I never never never  
I never never never  
Want to be in love with anyone but you  
But you
