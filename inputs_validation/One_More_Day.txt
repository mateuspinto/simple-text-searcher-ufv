Listen to the wind  
Hear the voice inside you  
Something in the air  
Something youve been blind to  
People everywhere are dying to be free  
Time has come to live our lives in harmony  
Chorus  
Give the children of the world one more day  
Give the children of the world give them one more day  
Where do we begin  
When will freedom find us  
Bring the new day in  
Free the chains that bind us  
People reaching out for just a little more  
Love is all we need to open up the door  
Chorus  
Now the futures up to you  
Take a stand and see things through  
For the children of tomorrow  
Give the world one more day  
Time enough to find a way  
To start over a way to go on  
One more day  
One more day  
Give the children of the world  
One more day  
One more day  
One more day  
Give the children of tomorrow  
One more day
