So I waited for you  
What wouldnt I do  
And Im covered its true  
Im covered in you  
  
If I ever want proof  
I find it in you  
Yeah I honestly do  
In you I find proof  
  
Light dark  
Bright spark  
Light dark and then light  
  
So I waited all day  
What wouldnt I say  
And all the thing in you way  
Things happen that way  
  
And if I ever want proof  
Then I find it in you  
Yeah I honestly do  
In you I find proof  
  
Light dark  
Bright spark  
Light dark and then light  
  
Light light light light
