The lamp is burnin low upon my table top  
The snow is softly fallin  
The air is still within the silence of my room  
I hear your voice softly callin  
  
If I could only have you near  
To breathe a sigh or two  
I would be happy just to hold the hands I love  
Upon this winter night with you  
  
The smoke is rising in the shadows overhead  
My glass is almost empty  
I read again between the lines upon the page  
The words of love you sent me  
  
If I could know within my heart  
That you were lonely too  
I would be happy just to hold the hands I love  
Upon this winter night with you  
  
The fire is dying now my lamp is growing dim  
The shades of night are liftin  
The mornin light steals across my windowpane  
Where webs of snow are driftin  
  
If I could only have you near  
To breathe a sigh or two  
I would be happy just to hold the hands I love  
And to be once again with with you  
To be once again with with you
