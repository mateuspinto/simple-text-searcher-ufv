Twas brillig and the slithy toves  
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe  
All mimsey were the borogroves  
And the mome raths outgrabe  
Beware the Jabberwock my son  
The jaws that bite the claws that snatch  
Beware the Jubjub bird and shun  
The frumious Bandersnatch   
He took his vorpal sword in hand  
Long time the manxome foe he sought   
He rested neath the Tumtum tree  
And stood awhile in thought  
And while in uffish thought he stood  
The Jabberwock with eyes aflame  
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood  
And burbled as it came  
One two One two And through and through  
The vorpal blade went snickersnack  
He left it dead and with its head  
He went galumphing back  
And hast thou slain the Jabberwock  
Come to my arms my beamish boy  
O frabjous day Callooh Callay   
He chortled in his joy  
Twas brillig and the slithy toves  
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe  
All mimsey were the borogroves  
And the mome raths outgrabe
