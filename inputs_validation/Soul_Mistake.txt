Promises are carved out of lust  
With a fire in the heart  
That burns with no regret  
I vow to play the part  
  
In this a meeting of the soul  
My feelings are unknown  
I learn with no regret  
Im getting what I get  
  
Feel some pain though Im miles away  
And ring to let you know  
Are you seeing someone  
Id better let you go  
  
She said this was a lesson in love  
She said this was a love to end all loves  
This soul never listens to me  
This soul has a lot to learn  
  
Honesty eludes one and all  
Like some gypsys search for gold  
Hes dreaming all the time  
But the gold is hard to find  
  
Made a mistake with myself  
My lover couldnt lie  
She told me of the things  
That made her cry inside  
  
Having the dreams of some gypsy
