Billy was born within sight of the shipyard  
First son of a riveters son  
And Billy was raised as the ship grew a shadow  
Her great hull would blot out the light of the sun  
  
And six days a week he would watch his poor father  
A working man live like a slave  
Hed drink every night and hed dream of a future  
Of money he never would save  
And Billy would cry when he thought of the future  
  
Soon came a day when the bottle was broken  
They launched a great ship out to sea  
He felt hed been left on a desolate shore  
To a future he desperately wanted to flee  
What else was there for a riveters son  
A new ship to be built new work to be done  
  
One day he dreamed of the ship in the world  
It would carry his father and he  
To a place they would never be found  
To a place far away from this town  
  
Trapped in the cage of the skeleton ship  
All the workmen suspended like flies  
Caught in the flare of acetylene light  
A working man works till the industry dies  
And Billy would cry when he thought of the future  
  
Then what they call an industrial accident  
Crushed those it couldnt forgive  
They brought Billys father back home in an ambulance  
A brass watch a cheque maybe three weeks to live  
And what else was there for a riveters son  
A new ship to be built new work to be done  
  
That night he dreamed of the ship in the world  
It would carry his father and he  
To a place they could never be found  
To a place far away from this town  
A Newcastle ship without coals  
They would sail to the island of souls
