I walk alone most every night  
Beneath the stars that shine so bright  
Bright as the eyes of you  
And when the sky comes falling down  
And there is darkness all around all around  
Ill be looking for you  
  
Lonely I look at the dreamflowing meadow  
Wondring what I am to do  
Sun going down and the trees cast their shadow  
In the shadow and the mist I remember the last kiss of you  
  
And when the sky wants more blue  
I get that old longing to to be held in the arms of you  
repeat  
To be held in the arms of you
