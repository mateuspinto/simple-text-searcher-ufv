Im on a mission  
To abuse my position  
Abuse it with you  
  
Love Im a cynical bitch  
Im gonna scratch that itch  
With a bitch like you  
  
Harder thinkers make me miserable  
Everything is unforgivable  
If not for you  
I wouldnt come at all  
  
Find a place to crash  
Boom boom boom boom labida  
Move your phoney ass  
Boom boom boom boom labida  
  
Love me like Im cash  
Boom boom boom boom labida  
You can feel the clash  
Boom boom boom boom labida  
  
Guitar  
  
If theres a freak in here  
Looking for someone like me  
I fit their description  
Perfectly  
  
Boom boom boom  
I bet theyll desert you  
They would if they met you  
Met you with me  
  
Every move you make is poetry  
They all fake what you do naturally  
If not for you  
I wouldnt come at all  
  
Find a place to crash  
Boom boom boom boom labida  
Move your phoney ass  
Boom boom boom boom labida  
  
Love me like Im cash  
Boom boom boom boom labida  
You can see the clash  
Boom boom boom boom labida  
  
Kiss me with your mouth  
Teach me with your brain  
All right  
  
Oh yeah oh yeah  
  
Things that I say  
When I say nothing at all  
It leaves a taste in my stomach  
And its no taste at all  
  
I can sing I cant dance  
But it dont stop me at all  
Its a ball and Ill call  if I call you at all  
  
Love is the reason but it wont pay my rent  
Only baloney fill your dish in the dent  
I wont be happy till the moneys been spent  
I forget to forget oh forget oh forget  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
