Uncle Ernie  
  
Im your wicked Uncle Ernie  
Im glad you wont see or hear me  
As I fiddle about  
Fiddle about  
Fiddle about   
  
Your mother left me here to mind you  
Now Im doing what I want to  
Fiddling about  
Fiddling about  
Fiddle about  
  
Down with the bedclothes  
Up with the nightshirt  
Fiddle about  
Fiddle about  
Fiddle about   
  
You wont shout as I fiddle about  
Fiddle about  
Fiddle about  
Fiddle about   
Fiddle fiddle fiddle
