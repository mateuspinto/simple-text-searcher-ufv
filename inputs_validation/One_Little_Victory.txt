A certain measure of innocence  
Willing to appear naive  
A certain degree of imagination  
A measure of makebelieve  
  
A certain degree of surrender  
To the forces of light and heat  
A shot of satisfaction  
In a willingness to risk defeat  
  
Celebrate the moment  
As it turns into one more  
Another chance at victory  
Another chance to score  
  
The measure of the moment  
Is a difference of degree  
Just one little victory  
A spirit breaking free  
One little victory  
The greatest act can be  
One little victory  
  
A certain amount of resistance  
To the forces of life and love  
A certain measure of tolerance  
A willingness to rise above
