Saxophones were playing in a pool of light  
Corridors of mirrors in a never ending night  
Jukebox electric shining in your face  
Arms like a gorilla playing a stumbling bass  
You were singing under water when you started to drown  
I never did like you much so I didnt slick around  
Matthew was the only one who lasted till the end  
He was swimming in the kitchen when his mind began to bend  
In party town party down  
I saw you with your dress torn down  
In party town party down  
You were naked and alone  
Officers and criminals were walking hand in hand  
The king of executioners he was singing in the band  
Microscopes and laser beams they all were being used  
Girls were drinking novocaine to keep themselves amused  
Senators and ministers were hanging in the sky  
People paying in advance to watch the scene go by  
Magazines were quoting all the things that had been said  
Making fun and money on the fact that she was dead  
Party girl party girl I saw you in your party world  
Party girl party girl you were naked and alone instrumental Party  
Party town party town where the beat goes down  
Party town party town you can hear them beg for more  
In party town party town the girls dont keep you hanging round  
In party town party town they nail you To the floor Ha Haa  
Instrumental out to fade Optional screaming
