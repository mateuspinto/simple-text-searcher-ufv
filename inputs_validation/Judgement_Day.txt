The night is gone  
The time has come  
To find a new day has begun  
An it promises to stay  
To soothe the pain of wasted years  
An kiss away the bitter tears  
A love to light the way  
  
And from the darkness  
Comes a smile  
That reaches out for many miles  
Touching everyone  
No more shadows of the past  
Your spirit free to fly at last  
Shining in the sun  
  
Like the rolling thunder  
I feel the power of love  
Its a gift from heaven  
And the Lord above  
  
We walk toward desire  
Hand and hand  
Through fields of fire  
With only love to light the way  
On the road to Judgement Day  
  
Take it easy take it slow  
Ill take you anywhere you want to go  
Places never seen before  
Cause I love you an I need you  
Ill do my best to please you  
My love can open any door  
  
When you hear the thunder  
In your darkest night  
Ill be there to hold you  
When the lightning strikes  
  
So dont you worry  
You can ease your mind  
Cause well be dancing  
At the end of time  
  
Who loves you who needs you  
Wholl do his best to please you  
I love you I need you  
Ill get down on my knees  
  
We walk toward desire  
Hand and hand  
Through fields of fire  
With only love to light the way  
On the road to Judgement Day  
  
So dont you worry baby  
On the road to Judgement Day  
Who loves you who needs you  
On the road to Judgement Day  
  
So I love you and I need you  
My love can open any door  
My love can open any door
