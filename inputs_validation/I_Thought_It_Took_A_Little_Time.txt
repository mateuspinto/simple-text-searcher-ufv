Am I really hard to please  
Perhaps I have such special needs  
I wondered what was wrong with me  
My friends all fall so easily  
But today I fell in love with someone I hardly know  
Did I make myself imagine that he could love me so  
Cause the feeling was so unexpected  
I could hardly keep myself collected  
I thought it took a little time to learn about lovin  
Never did believe in lovin on sight  
I thought it took time to learn about lovin  
All I know is now its gotta be right  
In the midst of conversation he looked into my eyes  
And all through the conversation much to my own surprise  
Half the words he said to me were missin  
Cause my mind was so intend on kissin  
I thought it took a little time to learn about lovin  
Never did believe in lovin on sight  
I thought it took time to learn about lovin  
All I know is now its gotta be right  
Am I really hard to please  
Perhaps I have such special needs  
I wondered what was wrong with me  
My friends all fall so easily  
But today I fell in love with someone I hardly know  
Did I make myself imagine that he could love me so  
And the feelin was so deep inside me  
I could feel it when he brushed beside me  
I thought it took a little time to learn about lovin  
Never did believe in lovin on sight  
I thought it took time to learn about lovin  
All I know is now its gotta be right  
Took a little time to learn about lovin  
Never did believe in lovin on sight  
I thought it took time to learn about lovin  
All I know is now its gotta be right  
Im in love so in love today I fell in love  
Im in love so in love today I fell in love  
I thought it took a little time to learn about lovin
