Cats eye apple pie what am I going to do  
The woman I loved walked out on me  
What am I going to do  
Hound dog bull frog she just up and gone  
The woman I love has done me wrong  
What am I going to do  
Green beans black eyed peas  
What am I going to do  
The woman I love has let me down  
What am I going to do  
  
Shes a delta queen know what I mean  
As mean as wildfire lightnin  
She can win and break the heart of any man  
Shes the delta queen of New Orleans  
And she loved me somethin frightnin  
But she left me for a dollar wavin man
