Ah wanna tell ya bout a girl  
You kno she lives in Apt 29  
Why Thats the one right up top a mine  
Ah start to cry Ah start to cry  
O ah hear her walkin  
Walkin barefoot cross the floorboards  
All thru this lonesome night  
And ah hear her crying too  
Hottears come splashin on down  
Leaking thru the cracks  
Down upon my face ah catchem in my mouth  
Walkncry Walkncryy  
From her to eternity  
From her to eternity  
From her to eternity  
Ah read her diary on her sheets  
Scrutinizin every lil piece of dirt  
Tore out a pagenstufft it inside my shirt  
Fled outa the window  
And shinning it down the vine  
Outa her nightmare and back into mine  
Mine O Mine  
From her to eternity  
From her to eternity  
From her to eternity  
Cry Cry Cry  
Shes wearing them bloostockens ah bet  
And standin like this with my ear to the ceiling  
Listen ah kno it must sound absurd  
But ah can hear the most melancholy sound  
Ah ever heard  
Walkncry Kneelncryy  
From her to eternity  
From her to eternity  
O tell me why Why Why  
Why the ceiling still shakes  
Why the fixtures turn to serpants snakes  
This desire to possess her is a wound  
And its naggin at me like a shrew  
But ah kno that to possess her  
Is therefore not to desire her  
O o o then ya kno that lil girl would just have to go  
Go Gooo From her to eternity
