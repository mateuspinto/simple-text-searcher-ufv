They told me all the hymns were born  
Out of the saxophone  
And I went down to test them all  
Beneath the Tijuana moon  
I saw violence in the moon  
Two broken lovers strong and strewn  
I drank myself into a dream  
  
Tijuana moon  
My daddy Tijuana moon  
Oh my darlin  
Tijuana moon Lord my daddy  
Tijuana moon  
  
You can keep the Texas blues  
Tequila and the burning stone  
But my amigo  
Nothins good against the Tijuana moon  
  
Talk about daddy Tijuana moon  
Talk about lovin Tijuana moon  
Talk about daddy Tijuana moon
