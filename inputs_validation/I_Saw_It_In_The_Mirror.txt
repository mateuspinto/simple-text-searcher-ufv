I saw it in the mirror  
I saw it in my face  
That Im no longer needed  
Anyone can take my place  
I saw it in the mirror  
When I looked into my eyes  
Cause something sure is wrong  
When this boy cries  
  
This boy cries  
  
I saw it in the mirror  
My head is hanging low  
And it aint too familiar  
With the feelings that I show  
I know you say you love me  
But Im looking through your lies  
It doesnt really bother you  
If this boy cries  
  
This boy cries  
  
I never thought I could cry for you  
But honey I will miss you  
Til the day I die  
Til the day I die  
  
I saw it in the mirror  
I saw it in my face  
That Im no longer needed  
Anyone can take my place  
I saw it in the mirror  
When I looked into my eyes  
Cause something sure is wrong  
When this boy cries  
  
This boy cries  
This boy cries
