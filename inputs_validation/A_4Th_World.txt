Here we are under these particular stars  
Here we stand Victorian  
Where the white folk can grow to know so  
Very little about the black folk  
The same folk who rightfully own  
This piece of beauty that we call our home  
Well negativity is often heard from society  
With conviction they preach  
Not even knowing of whom they speak  
I guess its each to their own  
Those that want to will know  
I guess its each to their own  
Because from the top the views are old and grey  
Well I feel so ashamed  
Of this system and these ways  
The tiny hearts that lead our nation  
And tiny minds that let them in  
And I see your confusion  
I see your pain  
I see your pain and your confusion  
And theres still some with my skin  
Who still try and hide the reason
