Our love was  
Our love was famine frustration  
We only acted out an imitation  
Of what real love should have been  
Then suddenly  
  
Our love was flying  
Our love was soaring  
Our love was shining  
Like a summer morning  
  
Flying soaring  
Shining morning  
Never leaving  
Lying dying  
  
Love love love long  
Love love love long  
Love love love long  
Love love love long  
  
Love love love long  
Love love love long  
Love love love long  
Love love love long  
  
Love love love long  
Love love love long  
Love love love long  
Love love love long  
  
Our love was flying  
Our love was soaring  
Our love was shining  
Like a summer morning  
  
Our love was famine frustration  
We only acted out an imitation  
Of what real love should have been  
And then suddenly  
  
Our love was flying  
Our love was soaring  
Our love was shining  
Like a summer morning
