Oh the trees grow higher than the mountain  
In the land of free love and goodbye  
The rivers ever growin the fish is flowin  
And the love lives in the sky  
  
In the night flies a team of white horses  
And they glimmer clean in your eye  
The bird of dawn is bringin the simpleness of singin  
And the song lives in the sky  
  
The trees grow higher than the mountain  
In the land of free love and goodbye  
The rivers ever growin the fish is flowin  
And the love lives in the sky
