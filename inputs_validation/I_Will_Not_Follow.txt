You say that you will carry the torch  
You say that you will beat the winning drum  
Youll be there when the saints roll in  
With a bat made of rubber half made out of tin  
How many times does the snake crawl out of its skin  
You change your spots  
But I will not  
  
You say youll put your trust in that old American flag  
You say there is still no place like home  
That youll still go to war when your papers come  
Surrender your nerve to a Gatling gun  
Come back home mate  
Tell everyone youll be happy with the time that youve got  
But I will not  
  
I will not follow Repeat x3  
  
You say that youll wear the colors blue and gray  
You say youll wear the colors black and red  
You wear whichever color shines most bright so  
You can shine like Blakes eternal tiger in the night  
You say that you will carry the torch  
You say that you will beat the winning drum  
You say that there is still no place like home  
No place like home sweet home  
You say that everyones gotta change their spots  
But I will not  
No I will not  
  
I will not follow Repeat x4  
No
