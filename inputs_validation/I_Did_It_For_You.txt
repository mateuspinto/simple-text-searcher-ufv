Life without taking chances  
Is no kinda life at all  
You gotta stand up for something  
Even if you might fall  
  
Got to take that road  
Wherever it might go  
No matter where no matter what  
I want you to know I want you to know  
  
I tried to do my best to do the best I could  
I gotta give my all is what I had to do  
I would do all again and thats the honest truth  
II did it for you  
  
Maybe I was crazy  
I guess I was sometimes  
Maybe its hard to change things  
But I had to know whats right  
Everyday youve got to live for too many  
Please understand I had no choice  
Its what had to be its what had to be  
  
I tried to do my best to do the best I could  
I gotta give my all is what I had to do  
I would do all again and thats the honest truth  
II did it for you  
  
And I had no choice  
Its something that I believe  
A dream that was driving me high inside of me  
  
I tried to do my best to do the best I could  
I gotta give my all is what I had to do  
I would do all again and thats the honest truth  
II did it for you  
  
Oh oh  
I did it for you  
I did it for you
