No mercy for what we are doing  
No thought to even what we have done  
We dont need to feel the sorrow  
No remorse for the helpless one  
  
War without end  
No remorse no repent  
We dont care what it meant  
Another day another death  
Another sorrow another breath  
No remorse no repent  
We dont care what it meant  
Another dayanother death  
Another sorrow another breath  
  
Blood feeds the war machine  
As it eats its way across the land  
We dont need the feel the sorrow  
No remorse is the one command  
  
War without end  
No remorse no repent  
We dont care what it meant  
Another day another death  
Another sorrow another breath  
No remorse no repent  
We dont care what it meant  
Another day another death  
Another sorrow another breath  
  
Only the strong survive  
No one to save the weaker race  
We are ready to kill all comers  
Like a loaded gun right at your face  
  
War without end  
No remorse no repent  
We dont care what it meant  
Another day another death  
Another sorrow another breath  
No remorse no repent  
We dont care what it meant  
Another day another death  
Another sorrow Another breath  
  
Attack  
Bullets are flying  
People are dying  
With madness surrounding all hells breaking loose  
Soldiers are hounding  
Bodies are mounting  
Cannons are shouting to take their abuse  
With war machines going  
Blood starts to flowing  
No mercy given to anyone hear  
The furious fighting  
Swords are like lighting  
It all becomes frightening to you  
Know death is near  
No remorse
