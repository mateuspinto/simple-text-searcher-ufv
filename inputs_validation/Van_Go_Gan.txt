From this day on Ill watch the setting sun  
As if it might be my last  
And as I view the changing color hue  
I see the long shadows pass  
  
Van Go Gan Van Go Gan  
Get a a grip if you can  
Van Go Gan Van Go Gan  
Watch it slip through your hands  
  
And through these eyes all the starry skies  
In my mind will explode  
As I lie in my bed at night  
I see my lifeline erode  
  
Van Go Gan Van Go Gan  
Grab ahold if you can  
Van Go Gan Van Go Gan  
Something I understand  
  
So much waiting sentimental memories  
Hesitating maybe Im just a wanna be  
  
Van Go Gan Van Go Gan  
Get a grip if you can  
Van Go Gan Van Go Gan  
Watch it slip through your hands  
Van Go Gan Van Go Gan  
Something I understand
