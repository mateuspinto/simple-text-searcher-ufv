There was trouble in the air  
Just a subtle hint of danger  
And a woman dressed in black  
Out lookin for a stranger  
Well she took me to her room  
Where she offered me a wager  
She promised me the moon  
So I took a chance  
  
Yes I played the King of Hearts  
Put my cards out on the table  
I thought the odds were in my favor  
But she laid the Ace of Spades  
An I wound up where I started  
The King of Hearts no more  
But the King of the Brokenhearted  
  
She cut the deck one more  
By the light of thirteen candles  
She said
