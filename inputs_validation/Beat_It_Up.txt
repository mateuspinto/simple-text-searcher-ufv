Chorus  
Its 4 in the mornin  
She callin my phone  
She wanna be grown  
We gone get it on  
She said that she lonely  
Cause hes never around  
Said she like my style  
He can lay you down  
Say he can lay you down  
But Im a beat it up  
Im a beat it up  
Im a beat it up  
He can lay you down  
But Im a beat it up  
Im a beat it up  
  
I hopped up out my bed  
Got my swag on  
Stronger than fillet Mignon  
Two Gs blown just for cologne  
Money never limited  
So Icey with benefits  
My driver needs a passport  
All my cars are immigrants  
Its so sickening  
History youre witnessing  
I had a girl she quit me  
Now Im single want to get with me  
Sticky again they stick to me  
If you see your chick with GUCCI  
Think before you confronting ruley  
Aint my fault your lady choosin  
430 stepped on purp it  
08 verty rollin dirty  
Wardrobe clean as this detergent  
Got your girlfriend picking purses  
Say she lonely  
Gucci only one with to meet me in person  
When she met me home  
My bitch told me that shes over first  
  
Chorus  
  
Your girlfriend keep callin me  
I feel like she stalkin me  
You at home  
And she with me  
So morning its an argument  
Gucci Mane be doggin it  
Beatin her down  
Straight poundin it  
Drillin on your sheets  
Got your blanket at the laundromat  
Wait baby girl throw it back  
Old man might catch heart attack  
Gucci Mane not hardly that  
Smack you like Im mad at that  
Swear this sex so passionate  
Oral sex she mastered that  
Pornographic poses  
Like she posing for the internet  
Wait I was not finished yet  
Never been a minute man  
Always been a business man  
Gotta catch your feelings man  
Got a man  
Oh really now  
Acting like I give a damn  
  
Used to like her now I dont  
Got a real short attention span  
Gucci  
  
Chorus  
  
Gucci Trey Songz put it on  
My shirt off when I perform  
She say this her favorite song  
She got on my favorite thong  
She so hot  
Too hot to touch  
Truthfully too much for lames  
Gucci mane Im extra game  
So extra rubbers Im a bring  
Got your main thang screaming Gucci  
Every Tuesday night we cool whip  
Wish we could do it more often  
But Im often somewhere flossin  
Lay it down like carpet barbie  
Aston martin double park it  
Beat it like we got a problem  
Pop her till she call me poppa  
Freakin partners  
Why we never bother with a second option  
Hoppin got the mattress poppin  
Rockin while her girlfriend watchin  
Freakin partners  
Why they never bother with a second option  
Hoppin got the mattress poppin  
Rockin while her girlfriend watchin  
Gucci
