Get off your high horse lady I dont need a ride tonight  
Get off your high horse lady I dont need a ride tonight  
Lay down  
  
I hear your soul song singing from a fire in the sky  
I hear your soul song singing from a fire in the sky  
Rain down  
Rain down  
  
Get off your high horse lady I dont need a ride tonight  
Get off your high horse lady I dont need a ride tonight  
Lay down  
Lay down
