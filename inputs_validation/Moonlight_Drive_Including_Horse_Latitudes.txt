Lets swim to the moon ah ha  
Lets climb through the tide  
Penetrate the evenin that the  
City sleeps to hide  
Lets swim out tonight love  
Its our turn to try  
Parked beside the ocean  
On our moonlight drive  
  
Lets swim to the moon ah ha  
Lets climb through the tide  
Penetrate the evenin that the  
City sleeps to hide  
  
Lets swim out tonight love  
Its our turn to try  
Parked beside the ocean  
On our moonlight drive  
  
Lets swim to the moon  
Lets climb through the tide  
You reach your hand to hold me  
But I cant be your guide  
  
Easy I to love you  
As I watch you glide  
Falling through wet forests  
On our moonlight drive  
Moonlight drive  
Moonlight drive  
  
Come on baby gonna take a little ride  
Goin down by the ocean side  
Get real close  
Get real tight  
Baby gonna drown tonight  
Goin down down down down  
Goin down  
Goin down way down  
Down down down down down  
Down baby low  
Children of the caves will let the  
Secret fires glow  
  
When the still sea conspires an armor  
And her sullen and aborted  
Currents breed tiny monsters  
True sailing is dead  
  
  
Awkward instant  
And the first animal is jettisoned  
Legs furiously pumping  
Their stiff green gallop  
And head bob up  
Poise  
Delicate  
Pause  
Consent  
In mute nostril agony  
Carefully refined  
And sealed over  
  
Easy to love you  
As I watch you glide  
Yeah were falling through wet forests  
On our moonlight drive  
Moonlight drive  
Moonlight drive  
Moonlight drive  
  
Thank you thank you
