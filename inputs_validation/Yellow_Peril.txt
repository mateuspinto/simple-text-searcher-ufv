Hunting in the Sea of Japan  
Ambrose left the tourist trail behind him  
So bold with his gun in his hand  
Of his furs there was no need to remind him  
Tripping over a Holy Man  
Mind that here you dont choose your friends  
Ambrose asked for a helping hand  
He heaved his chest and pointed West  
To where the river runs  
With Josie back home on his mind  
Brushing off the fruit flies of the season  
And Brosie was surely struck blind  
By a sight that defies human reason  
On an island of gleaming rock  
Jutting up from the blue lagoon  
A ceremonial music box  
And from it flowed a bright new mode  
That made our hero swoon  
A finer minor from China  
The World when the traveler returned  
As you know played out its bloody romances  
But Ambrose he knew what hed learned  
With his prize in hand he took his chances  
Soon the sound that delights the ear  
Blended in with the armies roar  
When the warriors strained to hear  
This new bebop this shooting star  
Their guns were bulletfull  
A finer minor from China  
A finer minor from China  
A finer minor from China
