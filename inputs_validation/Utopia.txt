Burning desire to live and roam free  
It shines in the dark and it grows within me  
Youre holding my hand but you dont understand  
So where I am going you wont be in the end  
  
Im dreaming in colors of getting the chance  
Im dreaming of china the perfect romance  
The search of the door to open your mind  
The search of the cure of mankind  
  
Help us were drowning  
So closed up inside  
  
Why does it rain rain rain down on utopia  
Why does it have to kill the ideal of who we are  
Why does it rain rain rain down on utopia  
How will the lights die down telling us who we are  
  
Im searching for answers not given for free  
They live inside as they lie within me  
You hold my hand but you dont understand  
Taking the road all alone in the end  
Im dreaming in colors no boundaries again  
Dreaming the dream we all seem to share  
  
The search of the door to open your mind  
The search of the cure of mankind  
  
Help us were drowning  
So closed up inside  
  
Why does it rain rain rain down on utopia  
Why does it have to kill the ideal of who we are  
Why does it rain rain rain down on utopia  
How will the lights die down telling us who we are  
  
Why does it rain rain rain down on utopia  
Why does it have to kill the ideal of who we are  
Why does it rain rain rain down on utopia  
How will the lights die down telling us who we are  
Why does it rain
