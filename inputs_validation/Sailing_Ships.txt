Do you remember  
Standing on the shore  
Head in the clouds  
Your pockets filled with dreams  
Bound for glory  
On the seven seas of life  
But the ocean is deeper than it seems  
  
The wind was with you  
When you left on the morning tide  
You set your sail for an island in the sun  
On the horizon dark clouds up ahead  
For the storm has just begun  
  
Take me with you  
Take me far away  
Lead me to the distant shore  
  
Sail your ship across the water  
Spread your wings across the sky  
Take the time to see  
Youre the one who holds the key  
Or sailing ships will pass you by  
  
You cry for mercy  
When you think youve lost your way  
You drift alone if all your hope is gone  
So find the strength and you will see  
You control your destiny  
After all is said and done  
  
So take me with you  
Take me far away  
An lead me to the distant shore  
  
Sail your ship across the water  
Spread your wings across the sky  
Take the time to see  
Youre the one who holds the key  
Or sailing ships will pass  
Sailing ships will pass you  
Sailing ships will pass you by  
  
Take me with you  
Take me far away  
Well ride the wind across the sky  
Spread your wings and you will see  
You control your destiny  
So sailing ships dont pass you by  
  
So take me with you  
Take me far away  
Well ride the wind across the sky  
Spread your wings and you will see  
You control your destiny  
So sailing ships dont pass  
So sailing ships dont pass you  
So sailing ships dont pass you by  
  
Baby baby baby baby  
Youll find that youre the only one  
Can sail your ship across the sky
