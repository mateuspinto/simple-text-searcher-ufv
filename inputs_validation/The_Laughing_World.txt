Right now day one I fall hard when I fall I always fall on you  
Face first head down eyes closed arms out to break my fall we fall  
Down  
  
Like a world of noise we get lost inside the length of our own time  
And the laughing world will never forget that its when you jam that I  
Jet  
  
I see I want I reach I fail to hold the things that I need  
I turn out reach for you  
  
I want to touch our life before it fades like a burning car in the sun  
We flame for the all in plain view  
And the laughing world will never forget that its when you jam that I  
Jet  
  
The laughing world will never forget  
The laughing world will never forget
