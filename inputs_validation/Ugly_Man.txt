Who am I  
To the rabble and the wise  
Am I just a young and shallow face that years erase  
Am I more than that  
Oh do they wonder how can I  
Bring the world beneath this guise  
In the silence of my languished soul  
Lies a truth unknown  
Oh yes I am  
I am just an ugly man  
Alone  
I work no day with self deception  
All that I am  
Is one common grain of sand  
But the sun does rise for every man alive  
And how my heart is clear cause I have from what I do  
And I do just what I am  
Oh no man is born a starless sky neath his naked hide  
Lord yes I am  
Maybe Im a lucky man  
Inside
