White chalk written on red brick  
Our love told in a heart  
Its there drawn in the playground  
Love kiss hate or adore  
  
I love Jennifer Eccles  
I know that she loves me  
I love Jennifer Eccles  
I know that she loves me  
  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
  
I used to carry her satchels  
She used to walk by my side  
But when we got to her doorstep  
Her dad wouldnt let me inside  
  
One Monday morning found out Id made the grade  
Started me thinking had she done the same

I hope Jennifer Eccles  
Is going to follow me there  
Our love is bound to continue  
Love kiss hate or adore Singing
