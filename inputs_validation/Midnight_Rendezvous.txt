Driving faster than you want me to  
Cant help myself when Im alone with you  
Alright  
Alright  
Ive passed the limit and theres no way back  
Your kind of love gives me a heart attack  
Alright  
Alright  
Cause baby cant you see  
We need to spend some time alone  
We need to see some dreams come true  
I want to feel me touching you  
We need a midnight rendezvous  
On the freeway with the throttle down  
You drive me crazy as we drive around  
Alright  
All night  
The way you look tonight you aim to please  
The dress youre wearin is way past your knees  
Alright  
Alright  
Cause baby cant you see  
We need to spend some time alone  
We need to see some dreams come true  
I want to feel you touching me  
We need a midnight rendezvous  
Midnight  
Midnight rendezvous  
Midnight  
Midnight rendezvous  
Midnight  
Midnight rendezvous  
Midnight  
Midnight rendezvous  
Yeah yeah  
All I really want to do  
Spend some time alone with you  
Yeah  
A midnight  
Baby baby cant you see  
Baby baby you and me  
Baby baby cant you see  
Baby baby you and me  
A midnight rendezvous

All I really want to do  
Oh I really want to fuck you  
Oh  
Midnight rendezvous
