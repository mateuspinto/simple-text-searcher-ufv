What I want I want now  
And its a whole lot more anyhow  
I wanna climb a mountain  
I wanna jump jump jump jump a mountain  
I understand all destructive urges  
Its seems so perfect  
I see I see no evil  
I get ideas notions  
I want a nice little boat made out of ocean  
I get your point youre so sharp  
Gettin good reactions with BeBo talk  
I understand all destructive urges  
Its seems so perfect  
I see I see no evil  
SOLO  
I understand all destructive urges  
Its seems so perfect  
I see I see no evil  
Walkin hand in hand with the one I love I see no evil  
Walkin through Manhattan with the one I love I see no evil  
Walkin hand in hand with the one I love I see no evil  
Walkin in Jackson with the one I love I see no evil  
Walkin in the world with the one I love I see no evil  
Walkin and talkin with the one I love I see no evil  
Walkin walkin and talkin with the one I love
