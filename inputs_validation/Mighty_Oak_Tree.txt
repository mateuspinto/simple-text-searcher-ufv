Like mighty oak trees  
They line a shaded well worn path  
Theyre the souls that hae walked beside me  
And I can see that looking back  
Friends that stood by me  
Right up to the last  
Like mighty oak trees that help me walk this well worn path  
Down by the water  
Of a stream that never ends  
They shelter me from the noon day sun and guard me from the wind  
I close my eyes and I can see them all once again  
  
Like mighty oak trees down by that stream that never ends  
Strong and always there when I needed them the most  
You know theyre rooted way down deep in my soul  
I think about them all the time when Im out on the road  
And every night when I lay down I know Im looking up at mighty oak trees  
Like mighty oak trees  
They have stood the test of time  
They were always there to lean on  
When stregth was hard to find  
I just hope that one day youre lucky enough to find  
Mighty oak trees  
Mighty oak trees like those rowdy friends of mine
