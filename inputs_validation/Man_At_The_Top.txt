Here comes a fireman here comes a cop  
Here comes a wrench here comes a car hop  
Been going on forever it aint ever gonna stop  
Everybody wants to be the man at the top  
  
Chorus  
Everybody wants to be the man at the top  
Everybody wants to be the man at the top  
Aim your gun son and shoot your shot  
Everybody wants to be the man at the top  
  
Rich man poor man beggar man thief  
Doctor lawyer Indian chief  
One thing in common they all got  
Everybody wants to be the man at the top  
  
Chorus  
  
Man at the top says its lonely up there  
If it is man I dont care  
From the big white house to the parking lot  
Everybody wants to be the man at the top  
  
Here comes a banker here comes a businessman  
Here comes a kid with a guitar in his hand  
Dreaming of his record in numberone spot  
Everybody wants to be the man at the top  
  
Chorus
