Jonathan is dead  
And Abigail is watching his wheelchair burn  
The flames lick the wooden floor  
Spreading to the curtains and then the draperies on the wall  
Higher and higher they go  
  
I am the fire Im eating everything  
Ill bring this mansion down through me they all must come  
  
Spirits flying through the air  
Spirits crossing over to the other side  
To rest in peace and never die again  
And to be with long gone friends  
  
The ghosts of those who lived here in the past  
They will use the flames to leave this EVIL house  
  
Abigail is watching the spirits and the flames  
Dancing hand in hand around her long black dress  
Oh around and around they go until they touch  
Abigail is on fire  
  
Mike  
Spirits flying through the air  
Spirits crossing over to the other side  
To rest in peace and never die again  
And to be with long gone friends  
  
Andy  
There is no pain as Abigail is eaten by the flames  
Her body starts to fade emptiness is growing inside  
Slowly shes leaving her body behind  
And the spirits are right by her side  
  
Oh no here she goes her spirit is in the air  
The others guide her to the flames where they all will disappear  
  
Spirits flying through the air  
Spirits crossing over to the other side  
To rest in peace and never die again  
And to be with long gone friends  
  
Andy and Kol  
But Abigail forgot one thing  
Her own little twin
