Should be happy to be loved  
Happy to be  
Unburdened by the thought  
I could still be lonely  
I think youre the one  
Everyone agrees  
But some can see the face of love  
And turn away in disbelief  
  
Every time we get close  
I just run  
And the wind on my face  
Last rays of the sun  
Shine on my skin  
My heart slow me down  
Is all that I can feel  
All that I can feel  
All that I can feel  
All that I can feel  
  
Should be happy to be loved  
Happy to be  
With someone who knows  
And understands me  
I think youre the one  
Everyone agrees  
But some can touch the hand of love  
And pull away in disbelief  
  
Every time we get close  
I just run  
And the wind on my face  
Last rays of the sun  
Shine on my skin  
My heart slow me down  
Is all that I can feel  
All that I can feel  
All that I can feel  
All that I can feel  
  
Should be happy to be loved  
Happy to be  
Possessed by nothing but  
A heart thats chosen freely  
I think youre the one  
Everyone agrees  
But some can feel the grace of love  
And walk away in disbelief  
  
Every time we get close  
I just run  
And the wind on my face  
Last rays of the sun  
Shine on my skin  
My heart slow me down  
Is all that I can feel  
All that I can feel  
All that I can feel  
All that I can feel  
  
All that I can feel  
All that I can feel  
All that I can feel  
All that I can feel  
  
Should be happy to be loved  
Happy to be  
  
Should be happy to be loved  
Happy to be
