I came to town in the heat  
A lonely man with tired feet  
Covered heat to toe in perspiration  
Then you caught me unaware  
Body so sleek I had to stare  
And me a man in need of transportation  
I do not how you got  
Into Hernandez Used Car Lot  
But I knew that you were  
Coming back with me  
I had to have you for my own  
But should I lease or get a loan  
Sometimes love is not free  
And Ill dress you up in fuzzy dice  
A liscence plate that glows  
And chrome exhaust pipes  
Ill dress you up in fuzzy dice  
And together we ride into the night  
Paid Hernandez to let you go  
My lovely El Camino  
Could hardly wait to get you to my place  
And even though we love each other  
I will put on plastic seat covers  
Nowadays you cannot be too safe  
I will buff you every night  
And put your lugnuts on so tight  
Do you love me as much as I love you  
And when I drive you round a corner  
Do you think of another owner  
Am I enough for you  
Oh Ill dress you up in fuzzy dice  
Funny bumper stickers and tires with walls of white  
Ill dress you up in fuzzy dice  
And together we will ride into the night  
Vroom vroom vroom
