Born in Louisiana in a town called Franklin  
I was fully matured by the time I reached the age of ten  
A mulatto girl is what they called me  
And us mulattos had no trouble at all with men  
All men say that Im as sweet as honey  
Cause on 34 38 and 22 at the tonky  
  
They called me Sweet Rhode Island Red Sweet Rhode Island Red  
Sweet Rhode Island Red Sweet Rhode Island Red  
Sweety is what they said about Sweet Rhode Island Red  
  
Tried to live a life I thought I wanted me to  
I went to church been to school  
But there never had to be a White near you  
 But on fast uptown Id need the jobs  
They were just too hard headed to leave me alone  
They said that I was sweet as honey  
Cause on 34 38 and 22 at the tonky  
  
They called me Sweet Rhode Island Red Sweet Rhode Island Red  
Sweet Rhode Island Red Sweet Rhode Island Red  
Sweety is what they said about Sweet Rhode Island Red  
  
I was 17 when I moved to New Orleans  
Cause living in the city has always been my dream  
People laughed said it was a shame and a pity  
When old mayor Daley gave me the key to the city  
He too said that I was as sweet as honey  
Cause on 34 38 and 22 at the tonky  
  
They called me Sweet Rhode Island Red Sweet Rhode Island Red  
Sweet Rhode Island Red Sweet Rhode Island Red  
Sweety is what they said about Sweet Rhode Island Red
