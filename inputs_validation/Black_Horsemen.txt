So there they stood at the top of the stairs  
Miriam in the mood Jonathan was scared  
Gazing into the dark Jonathan saw the star  
For a second he turned his back  
And she was there like a ghost  
She him hard and clean  
To the bottom of the stairs  
  
Now were finally alone Miriam  
Abigail is here to stay  
  
The birth of Abigail would soon be realized  
The second coming of a devil in disguise  
And the moon did not shine  
It was darker than ever before  
  
On this sacred night  
The soul of Miriam was crying out in pain  
Remembering the day arrival in the rain  
  
The pain of labor was so strong that Miriam died  
The final seeing was a pair of yellow eyes  
You can still hear her screaming  
If Youre walking the stairs in July  
  
Riding from beyond  
The 7 Horsemen would arrive before the dawn  
Servants of the count when Abigail was born the first time  
  
Oh no they found her in the sarcophagus  
Baby Abigail was eating Oh I cannot tell You  
  
Take her and bring her  
To the chapel in the forest  
So go nowThe ceremony  
And the coffins waiting  
  
The Black Horsemen  
  
Thats the end of another lullaby  
Time has come for me to say goodnight
