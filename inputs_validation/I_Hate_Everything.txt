He was sitting there beside me throwing doubles down  
When he ordered up his third one he looked around  
Then he looked at me  
And said I do believe  
Ill have one more  
He said I hate this bar and I hate to drink  
But on second thought tonight I think I hate everything  
  
Then he opened up his billfold and threw a twenty down  
And a faded photograph fell out and hit the ground  
I picked it up  
He said thank you bud  
I put it in his hand  
He said I probably oughta throw this one away  
cause shes the reason I feel this way  
I hate everything  
  
I hate my job  
And I hate my life  
And if it werent for my two kids  
Id hate my ex wife  
I know I should move on and try to start again  
But I just cant get over her leaving me for him  
Then he shook his head looked down at his ring said I hate everything  
  
Said that one bedroom apartment where I get my mail  
Is really not a home its more like a jail  
With a swimming pool and a parking lot view  
Man its just great  
I hate summer winter fall and spring  
Red and yellow purple blue and green  
I hate everything  
  
I hate my job  
And I hate my life  
And if it werent for my two kids  
Id hate my ex wife  
I know I should move on and try to start again  
But I just cant get over her leaving me for him  
Then he shook his head looked down at his ring said I hate everything  
  
So I pulled out my phone and I called my house  
I said Babe Im coming home were gonna work this out  
I payed for his drinks  
And I told him thanks  
Thanks for everything
