I lay my heart on you and you can show the way  
I give my everlasting love until my dying day  
Take this lonely soul  the water or the wine  
A chance to make you mine  
I lay my body on the line

My life was emptiness until you came along  
I nearly fell apart  you took my heart and made me strong  
I need all of you to get me through the night  
A chance to see the light  
I lay my body on the line
