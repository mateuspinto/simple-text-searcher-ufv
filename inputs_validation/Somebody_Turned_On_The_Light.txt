Ive been to wild Montana  
I went there in a storm  
My boots were Texas leather  
My Levis wet and torn  
  
I loved it in Montana  
Loved it in the storm  
I think Im gonna cross that river  
I just might be reborn  
  
New York New York winter 61  
Takin me a city ride  
Somebody tall musta put out the lights  
Cause it got real dark outside  
  
Chorus  
And I never saw the sun till 71  
But I never gave up the fight  
I sure was glad when I saw the dawn  
Somebody somebody turned on the light  
Somebody turned on the light  
  
Women wine and fast red cars  
And I couldnt seem to read the signs  
Somebody said Whose life is this  
And I said that it cant be mine  
  
Chorus  
  
When the world is wrong better right yourself  
Itll make the dark clouds fly  
Nobody tall can put out the lights  
Just dont let the spirit die  
  
If you never see the sun till 91  
Dont you ever give up the fight  
Sure be glad when you see the dawn  
Somebody somebody turns on the light  
Somebody turns on the light
