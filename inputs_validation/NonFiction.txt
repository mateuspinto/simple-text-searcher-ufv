Intro  
The story you bout to hear is complete fiction It is however made up of a
group of stories true stories about real people Thus creating real
characters going through real things Thus making the story itself real true
and a real story a true story is nonfiction  
  
Our story begins in a dark place A place where you learn that everything that
you wanted could potentially be the very thing that leads to your
destruction The very thing you should fear This is a lesson learned the hard
way experience being the only teacher I mean you cant exactly tell a broke
man that money is evil and expect him to listen to you now can you Naw hes
got to go down that road hes got to face them demons himself before he can
acquire that knowledge The money solves one group of problems only to
introduce another Strangers become friends friends become enemies The fame
just like any other drug feels incredible until you realize all that
adoration all that love aint real And the women huh the women a drug
you use that uses you right back A high for a high so to speak Which brings
us to Tammy
