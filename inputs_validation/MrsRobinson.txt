And heres to you Mrs Robinson  
Jesus loves you more than you will know Wo wo wo  
God bless you please Mrs Robinson  
Heaven holds a place for those who pray  
Hey hey heyhey hey hey

Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home

Hey hey heyhey hey hey  
Hide it in a hiding place where no one ever goes  
Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes  
Its a little secret just the Robinsons affair  
Most of all youve got to hide it from the kids  
Coo coo cachoo Mrs Robinson  
Jesus loves you more than you will know Wo wo wo  
God bless you please Mrs Robinson  
Heaven holds a place for those who pray  
Hey hey heyhey hey hey  
Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon  
Going to the candidates debate  
Laugh about it shout about it  
When youve got to choose  
Evry way you look at it you lose  
Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio  
A nation turns its lonely eyes to you Woo woo woo  
Whats that you say Mrs Robinson  
Joltin Joe has left and gone away  
Hey hey heyhey hey hey
