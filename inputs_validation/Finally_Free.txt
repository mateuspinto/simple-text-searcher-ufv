You are once again surrounded by a brilliant white light  
Allow the light to lead you away from your past and into this lifetime  
As the light dissipates you will slowly fade back into consciousness
remembering all you have learned  
When I tell you to open your eyes you will return to the present  
feeling peaceful and refreshed  
Open your eyes Nicholas  
  
Friday evening  
The blood still on my hands  
To think that she would leave me now  
For that ungrateful man  
  
Sole survivor  
No witness to the crime  
I must act fast to cover up  
I think that theres still time  
  
Hed seem hopeless and lost with this note  
Theyll buy into the words that I wrote  
  
This feeling inside me  
Finally found my love Ive finally broke free  
No longer torn in two  
Id take my own life before losing you  
  
Feeling good this Friday afternoon  
I ran into Julian  
Said wed get together soon  
  
Hes always had my heart  
He needs to know  
Ill break free of the Miracle  
Its time for him to go  
  
This feeling inside me  
Finally found my love Ive finally broke free  
No longer torn in two  
Hed kill his brother if he only knew  
  
Their love renewed  
Theyd rendezvous  
In a pathway out of view  
They thought no one knew  
Then came a shot out of the night  
  
One last time  
Well lay down today  
One last time  
Until we fade away  
One last time  
Well lay down today  
One last time  
We fade away  
  
As their bodies lie still  
And the ending draws near  
Spirits rise through the air  
All their fears disappear it all becomes clear  
A blinding light comes into view  
An old soul exchanged for a new  
A familiar voice comes shining through  
  
This feeling inside me  
Finally found my life Im finally free  
No longer torn in two  
I learned about my life by living through you  
  
This feeling inside me  
Finally found my life Im finally free  
No longer torn in two  
Living my own life by learning from you  
  
Well meet again my friend someday soon

lead story all anticipating the outcome of the man considered to

resign themselves to the possibility that they are witnessing yet  
another tragedy in a long string of misfortunes Reaction from

Open your eyes Nicholas
