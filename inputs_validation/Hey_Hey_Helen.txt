So at last youre free  
Its the way you wanted it to be  
And the price you paid  
To become a woman of today  
Is it worth the pain to see the children cry  
Does it hurt when they ask for Daddy  
  
Hey hey Helen  
Now you live on your own  
Hey hey Helen  
Can you make it alone  
Yes you can  
  
So youre free at last  
And beginning to forget the past  
Does it make you sad  
When you think about the life you hahahad  
But youre right you had to take a second chance  
So you fight to find your freedom  
  
Hey hey Helen  
Now you live on your own  
Hey hey Helen  
Can you make it alone  
Hey hey Helen hey hey Helen  
Whats the matter with you  
Hey hey Helen hey hey Helen  
Dont you know what to do  
Yes you do  
Yes you do yes you do  
Yes you do yes you do  
  
Hey hey Helen  
Now you live on your own  
Hey hey Helen  
Can you make it alone  
Hey hey Helen hey hey Helen  
Whats the matter with you  
Hey hey Helen hey hey Helen  
Dont you know what to do  
Hey hey Helen hey hey Helen  
Now you live on your own  
Hey hey Helen hey hey Helen
