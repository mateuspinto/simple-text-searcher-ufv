I desire Jesus  
Precious Lamb  
Who ransomed me  
Upon the cross  
He took my sin  
By His blood  
He set me free  
  
I desire Jesus  
Oh His Name  
My soul esteem  
For upon  
His thornscarred brow  
Is the crown of victory  
  
He is worthy of all honour  
All glory to His Name  
He alone deserves  
Our highest praise  
And forever He will reign  
  
I desire Jesus  
Triumphant One  
The earth awaits  
For on that day  
The earth will shine  
With the glory of Your Name  
  
You are worthy of all honour  
All glory to Your Name  
You alone deserve  
Our highest praise  
And forever You will reign  
  
You are all glorious  
You are all glorious  
My heart leans in  
My soul must sing  
You are all glorious  
X3  
  
You are worthy of all honour  
All glory to Your Name  
You alone deserve  
Our highest praise  
And forever You will reign  
  
You are all glorious  
You are all glorious  
My heart leans in  
My soul must sing  
You are all glorious  
X2  
  
I desire Jesus  
Precious Lamb  
Who ransomed me  
And unto You an offering  
Will my life forever be
