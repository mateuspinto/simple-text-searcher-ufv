I came home in the middle of the night  
My father says What you gonna do with your life  
Well lady dear youre still number one  
Oh girls they wanna have fun  
Oh girls they  
  
The phone rings in the middle of the night  
My mother says When you gonna live your life right  
Well mother dear  
Were not the fortunate ones  
Oh girls they wanna have fun  
Oh girls they they  
  
Its all they really want  
Those girls they wanna have fun  
  
Some boys take a beautiful girl  
Oh and they hide her away from the rest of the world  
Well not me I wanna be the one in the sun  
Girls they wanna have fun  
Oh girls they they  
Thats all they really want  
Those girls they wanna have fun
