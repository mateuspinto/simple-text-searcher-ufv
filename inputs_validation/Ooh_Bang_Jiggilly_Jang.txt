If you wonder  
Why I love him so  
Hes different from  
The other boys I know  
  
Some have ginger  
And some have snap  
Some have this  
And some have that  
  
But my guy all hes got  
Is ooh bang jiggilly jang  
  
Some have kisses  
That taste so sweet  
Taste like taters  
Or taste like meat  
  
But my guy what a flavor  
Ooh bang jiggilly jang  
  
My bonnie lies over the mmm  
My bonnies lies over the  
Ooh bang jiggilly jang  
  
Theres nobody lies  
Like my bonnie  
But even though my  
Bonnie lies to me  
  
I forgive him cause  
Some are charming  
And some have looks  
Some have money  
And some read books  
  
But my guy hes got  
So much ooh bang jiggilly jang  
  
My bonnie lies over the mmm  
My bonnies lies over the  
Ooh bang jiggilly jang  
  
Theres nobody lies  
Like my bonnie  
But even though my  
Bonnie lies to me  
  
I forgive him cause  
Some are charming  
And some have looks  
Some have money  
And some read books  
  
But my guy all hes got  
Is ooh bang jiggilly jang  
  
Ooh bang jiggilly jang  
Ooh bang jiggilly jang  
Ooh bang jiggilly jang
