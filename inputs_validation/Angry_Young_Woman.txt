Angry young woman on sunrise strip  
Walking away to the new world  
She left her man she left her children  
Cause she knows she has only one life to live  
  
Angry young woman with her background on her forehead  
Three children and two abortions  
Played a little piano ten years ago  
And some typing from the college where she met her husband  
  
Angry young woman in the dark of the night  
Hears her children crying for dinner  
Hears her man shouting for his shirt  
And thinks of the first sundays they spent in the park  
  
Angry young woman angry young woman  
Theres no way back so just keep walking  
Leave your past in your raincoat pocket  
And when you turn the corner youll see the new world  
  
Angry young woman angry young woman  
Theres no way back so just keep walking  
Leave your past in your raincoat pocket  
And when you turn the corner youll see the new world  
  
Angry young woman angry young woman  
Theres no way back so just keep walking  
Leave your past in your raincoat pocket  
  
Angry young woman angry young woman
