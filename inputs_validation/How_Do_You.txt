Hes bitter and twisted he knows what he wants  
He wants to be loved and he wants to belong  
He wants you to listen he wants us to weep  
And he was a stupid baby who turned into a powerful freak  
  
But how do you  
How do you  
How do you  
  
He lives with his mother but we show him respect  
Hes a dangerous bigot but we always forget  
And hes just like his daddy cause he cheats on his friends  
And he steals and he bullies any way that he can  
  
But how do you  
How do you  
How do you
