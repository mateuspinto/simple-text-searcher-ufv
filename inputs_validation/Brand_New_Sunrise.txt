City wins another fight  
To take the day into the night  
My shadows been around for too long  
Daylight understands me the part thats not alone  
  
Hide n seek they try to be discreet  
Moonlight walks with me Sunset talks to me  
But all I want from you is a brand new sunrise  
Silently keeping what they are keeping  
  
Moon clouds are flocking streetlamps mockin  
Time to work it out somehow  
But the day whispers someone  
The night moves so slowly  
  
He wont take it out on his head  
night walks away with the summer  
Day gives into the fall  
  
Moonlight walks with me  
Sunset talks to me  
But all I want from you is a brand new sunrise
