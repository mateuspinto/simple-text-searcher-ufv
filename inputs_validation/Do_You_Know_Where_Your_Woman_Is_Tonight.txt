Do you know where your woman is tonight  
Do you know if shes sleepin alone tonight  
Well you might be right and you might be wrong  
when you say you trust her alone  
But this rock n roll road has led you far into the night  
Do you know where your woman is tonight  
So you think you know where your woman spends her time  
And you think you know her every rhythm and rhyme  
Well I thought so too baby long a ago  
But now I know how a blind man sees  
Cause this rock n roll road has led you far into the night  
Do you know where your woman is tonight
