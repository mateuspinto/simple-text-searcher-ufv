Why do I have to dream of you when I dont want to dream a lie  
Why do I have to dream of you when I dont want to dream a lie  
  
There never was a better time  
For trying to set the words to rhyme  
Of when a golden love turns blue  
And dreams of dreams that wont come true  
  
Every night I call your name  
Were still together just the same  
  
A lonely room an empty bed  
It always seems that way
