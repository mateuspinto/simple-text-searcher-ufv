It was a rainy night  
We took a taxi to your mothers home  
She went to Florida and left you  
With your fathers gun alone  
Upon her small white bed  
I fell into a dream  
You sat up all the night and watched me  
To see who in the world I might be  
  
I am from the Sunday school  
I sing soprano in the upstairs choir  
You are a holy man  
On the FM radio  
I sat up all the night and watched thee  
To see who in the world you might be  
  
You called me beautiful  
You called your mothershe was very tanned  
So you packed your tent and you went  
To live out in the Arizona sand  
You are a refugee  
From a wealthy family  
You gave up all the golden factories  
To see who in the world you might be
