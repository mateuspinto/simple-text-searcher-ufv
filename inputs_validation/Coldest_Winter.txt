On lonely nights I start to fade  
On lonely nights I start to fade  
Her love is a thousand miles away  
Her love is a thousand miles away  
Memories made in the coldest winter  
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again  
  
Memories made in the coldest winter  
  
Its 4am and I cant sleep  
Its 4am and I cant sleep  
Her love is all that I can see  
Her love is all that I can see  
Memories made in the coldest winter  
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again  
  
Memories made in the coldest winter  
Winter winter  
  
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again  
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again  
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again  
  
If spring can take the snow away  
If spring can take the snow away  
Can it melt away all of our mistakes  
Can it melt away all of our mistakes  
Memories made in the coldest winter  
Goodbye my friend I wont ever love again  
  
Never again
