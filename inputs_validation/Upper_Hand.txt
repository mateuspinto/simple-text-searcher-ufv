Honey on a teaspoon  
Sugar in a bowl  
An eager mans always an easy catch  
Butter on the skillet  
Whiskey in a glass  
To start a flame youve got to light a match  
  
Ooh you got what he wants  
You got what he wants  
ooh  
  
Chorus  
Got to get a hold got to get a hold get a hold of your man  
Better get him while better get him while better get him while you can  
Good to be a lion good to be a lion instead of a lamb  
Use what you got take the upper hand  
  
Always be a lady  
But tease him like a tramp  
A temptation thats hard to resist  
Treat him like a hero  
  
Let him long to be your slave  
Take advantage of your God given gift  
  
Ooh you know what he wants  
You know what he wants  
ooh  
  
Chorus  
  
Generations before will testify its true  
Girl your gonna see how much he really loves you  
  
Chorus
