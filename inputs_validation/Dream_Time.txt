Streets I ran this whole town  
Backstreets and all I wanted to leave there  
But no matter how fast I ran my feet were glued  
I just couldnt move there  
  
I saw the hate and lots of people  
I heard my name called above the noise  
I tried to speak but my tongue was tied  
Bumped into emptiness and started to cry oh no  
  
Chorus  
I saw the lights and the pretty girls  
And I thought to myself what a pretty world  
But theres something else here that puts me off  
And Im so scared dear my love comes in frozen packs  
Bought in a supermarket  
  
Streets I ran through wind and rain  
Around this place amongst streaming sunshine  
Scared I was sweating now  
Feeling of doom my bowels turned to water  
  
I felt hot breath whisper in my ear  
I looked for somewhere to hide but every wheres closed  
I shut my eyes pretend not to be here  
This feelings much to real to ever disappear oh no  
  
Chorus  
  
And Im so scared dear  
My love comes in frozen packs
