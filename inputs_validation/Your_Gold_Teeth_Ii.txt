Who are these children  
Who scheme and run wild  
Who speak with their wings  
And the way that they smile  
What are the secrets  
They trace in the sky  
And why do you tremble  
Each time they ride by  
  
Chorus  
Throw out your gold teeth  
And see how they roll  
The answer they reveal  
Life is unreal  
  
Who are these strangers  
Who pass through the door  
Who cover your action  
And go you one more  
If youre feeling lucky  
You best not refuse  
Its your game the rules  
Are your own win or lose  
  
Chorus
