She sends me blue valentines  
All the way from philadelphia  
To mark the anniversary  
Of someone that I used to be  
And it feels like  
A warrant out for my arrest  
Baby you got me checkin in my rearview mirror  
And Im always on the run  
Thats why I changed my name  
And I didnt think youd ever find me here  
  
To send me blue valentines  
Like half forgotten dreams  
Like a pebble in my shoe  
As I walk these streets  
And the ghost of your memory  
Baby Its the thistle in the kiss  
Its the burgler that can break a roses neck  
Its the tatooed broken promise  
I gotta hide beneath my sleeve  
And I see you every time I turn my back  
  
She sends me blue valentines  
While tring to remain at large  
Theyre insisting that our love  
Must have a eulogy  
Why do I save all of this madness  
Here in the nightstand drawer  
There to haunt upon my shoulders  
Baby I know  
Id be luckier to walk around everywhere I go  
With this blind and broken heart  
That sleeps beneath my lapel  
  
She sends me my blue valentines  
To remind me of my cardinal sin  
I can never wash the guilt  
Or get these bloodstains off my handa  
And it takes a whole lot of whiskey  
To take this nightmares go away  
And I cut my bleedin heart out every nite  
And I die just little more each st valentines day  
Remember that I promised I would  
Write you  
These blue valentines  
Blue valentines  
Blue valentines
