When you walked into my lonely life tonight  
I saw my destiny I saw eternity tonight  
And the moment I held you I knew it  
What we do is decided before we do it  
  
Chorus  
Fate this could only be  
Fate I never thought Id believe in  
Fate now I understand  
Its part of the plan  
I was meant to be your woman  
  
Time stood still and we lost on words to say  
And though the people stared they seemed a million miles away  
Oh we knew it was love we were feeling  
We were destined to give it a whole new meaning  
  
Chorus  
  
In my heart I feel Ive loved you all my life  
I was in the dark but now I think Ive seen the light  
I rang like a bell with your laughter  
Something tells me Ill love you forever and ever  
  
Fate this could only be  
It was fate this could only be  
Its part of the plan  
I was meant to be your woman  
Its part of the plan  
Ill love you forever and ever
