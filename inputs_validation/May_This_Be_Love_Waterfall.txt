Waterfall  
Nothing can harm me at all  
My worries seem so very small  
With my waterfall  
  
I can see  
My rainbow calling me  
Through the misty breeze  
Of my waterfall  
  
Some people say  
Daydreamings for all the  
Lazy minded fools  
With nothin else to do  
So let them laugh laugh at me  
So just as long as I have you  
To see me through  
As long as I have you  
  
Waterfall  
Dont ever change your ways  
Fall with me for a million days  
Oh my waterfall
