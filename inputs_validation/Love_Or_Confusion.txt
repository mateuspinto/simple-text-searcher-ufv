Is that the stars in the sky or is it rain fallin down  
Will it burn me it I touch the sun yeah  
So be it so round  
Will I be truthful yeah  
In a choosing you as the one for me  
  
Is this love baby  
Or is it a just confusion  
  
Oh my mind is so messed up goin round n round  
Must there be all these colors without names  
Without sounds babe  
My heart burns with feelin but  
Oh but my mind is cold and reeling  
Is this love baby  
Or is it confusion  
  
Oh my head is pounding pounding  
Going round and round and round and round  
Must there always be these colors  
Without names without sound  
My heart burns with feelin but  
Oh but my mind is cold and reeling  
Is this love or is it just confusion  
  
Ah you tell me baby  
Is this love or confusion  
We must get together and find out  
Exactly what were trying to do  
  
Confusion
