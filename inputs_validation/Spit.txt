If You came by me  
Would I crown You my King  
Or brush You off as though  
I really didnt see  
If You walked by my side  
Would our souls then be unified  
I swore Your name  
Would never be denied  
  
But I took up this hammer  
And laughed at all Your slander  
And pierced Your hands  
With the nails of blasphemy  
How could I do this I dont know  
Said something forced me to it so  
Spit in Your face and passed You by  
Id forgotten those words  
Your name wont be denied  
  
But time and time again  
Id live that life of sin  
I knew it hurt you bad  
But I wasnt ready to give in  
Maybe someday  
But not this day I said  
I wanted to live my life  
I was willing to pay the price  
  
Chorus  
  
But looking into my eyes  
I knew You felt this hearts cry  
I needed You  
Bad my life was oh so sad  
But looking back at all this pain  
This guilt this strife  
Would You take it all away  
If I were to give you back my life  
  
But You said  
Ive forgiven thee  
And You said  
Ive forgiven thee repeat  
  
He was hanging on a cross  
With a crown of thorns  
In His head repeat  
  
But You said  
Ive forgiven thee  
And You said  
Ive forgiven thee repeat
