Its early morning the sun comes out  
Last night was shaky and pretty loud  
My cat is purring it scratches my skin  
So what is wrong with a night of sin  
  
The bitch is hungry she needs to tell  
So give her inches and feed her well  
More days to come new places to go  
Ive got to leave its time for the show  
  
Here I am  
Rock you like a hurricane  
Here I am  
Rock you like a hurricane  
  
My body is burning it starts to shout  
Desire is coming it breaks out loud  
Lust is in cages till storm breaks loose  
Just have to make it with someone I choose  
  
The night is calling I have to go  
The wolf is hungry he runs the show  
Hes licking his lips hes ready to win  
On the hunt tonight for love at first sting  
  
Here I am  
Rock you like a hurricane Are you ready baby  
Here I am  
Rock you like a hurricane  
Here I am  
Rock you like a hurricane Come on come on baby  
Here I am  
Rock you like a hurricane  
  
Rock you like a hurricane  
  
Its early morning the sun comes out  
Last night was shaky and pretty loud  
My cat is purring it scratches my skin  
So what is wrong with a night of sin  
  
The night is calling I have to go  
The wolf is hungry he runs the show  
Hes licking his lips hes ready to win  
On the hunt tonight for love at first sting  
  
Here I am  
Rock you like a hurricane Are you ready baby  
Here I am  
Rock you like a hurricane  
Here I am  
Rock you like a hurricane Come on come on come on come on  
Here I am  
Rock you like a hurricane
