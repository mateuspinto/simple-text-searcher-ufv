Is it just me or a message from above  
Bells are ringing push has finally come to shove  
The door before me now is open just enough  
And Im sick and tired of waiting for dreams that never come  
And games I never played in but still wish that I had won  
Im alive Ive got one shot and Im taking it to you  
Im alive Ive come to realize not a moment too soon  
That this is my one small step this is my walk on the moon  
Dont you think their hands were shaking as that rocket ship touched down  
Im sure they shivered when they finally touched the ground  
And the giant leap so fragile that it hardly made a sound  
But it must have been amazing what a world they got to see  
So I dont care my foolish fear wont get the best of me now  
Im alive Ive got one shot and Im taking it to you  
Im alive Ive come to realize not a moment too soon  
That this is my one small step this is my walk on the moon  
This is my walk on the moon  
Oh it must have been amazing what a world they got to see  
So I dont care my foolish fear wont get the best of me now  
Im alive Ive got one shot and Im taking it to you  
Im alive Ive come to realize not a moment too soon  
Im alive Ive got one shot and Im taking it to you  
Im alive Ive come to realize not a moment too soon  
That this is my one small step  
This is my one small step  
This is my walk on the moon  
This is my walk on the moon  
This is my walk on the moon
