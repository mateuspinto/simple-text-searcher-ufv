Youre a cool little one  
My dark southern breeze  
Sweeps through my fingers  
And it amazes me  
  
Dixie shadowland  
Your envy shelters me  
Lay down your burden  
Mystery of ebony  
  
And it amazes me  
Oh it amazes me  
Maybe the heat babe could be this tune  
It amazes me  
It amazes me  
What drives me crazy is that big fat yellow moon  
  
Look up that pale light  
Well shes waking the trees  
Im drifting in your hoodoo  
And it amazes me  
  
That magnolia state  
Got a hold on me  
I got no blues to preach  
Just Mississippi company  
  
Aint no magic potion  
No grigri on her side  
Shes bound to my salvation  
Sweet little mama  
Take me down by the river tonight  
And it amazes me
