It was there for the first time  
I could see it by the look in your eyes  
Youre so shy but I know you want me  
Your desire will not be denied  
We will be together our love has just begun  
We will be together we will be together again  
Wanna be in love with you I want to be loved by you  
This feeling is all brand new  
Wanna be in love with you I want to be loved by you  
You make my dreams come true  
Dont you know I love the way you hold me  
I feel so safe in your arms  
It means so much the way you hold my hand  
All a part of your charm  
We will be together our love has just begun  
We will stay together we will be together again  
Wanna be in love with you I want to be loved by you  
This feeling is all brand new  
Wanna be in love with you I want to be loved by you  
You make my dreams come true  
Be in love with you  
Being together tonight  
Well together tonight  
Everybodyd searching for a love to call their own  
You will never have to be alone  
Im so in love with you I will give you my heart  
Baby we will never be apart  
You Regine I love you I know what you need  
I must have you forever together and ever and ever again  
Regine I need you I need you so much  
Come a little bit closer to hold ya I gotta have ya  
Regine
