How beautiful do the words have to be  
Before they conquer every heart  
How will you know if Im even in the right key  
If you make me stop before I start  
  
Chorus  
If I came back as a dolphin  
Would you listen to me then  
Would you let me be your friend  
Would you let me in  
You can cut off all my fins  
But to your ways I will not bend  
Ill die before I let you tell me how to swim  
And Ill come back again as a dolphin  
  
Why does my brother have to go hungry  
When you told him there was food for all  
This is the man that stands next to the man  
That stands to catch you when you fall Oh  
  
If Im under water will you find me Find me  
Will you shine a light and try to guide me  
Its happened before Ive knocked on your door  
But you wouldnt let me in  
  
How beautiful do the words have to be  
Before they conquer every heart Oh  
  
Chorus  
  
Ill come back baby  
Let me in let me in As a dolphin  
Be my friend Dolphin  
Yeah yeah  
  
Dolphin  
As a dolphin  
As a dolphin  
As a dolphin
