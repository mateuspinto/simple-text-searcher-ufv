Way down  
Way down it must be  
I cant stop this misery  
It must be way down  
  
Spring is just a smile away  
Laughing at a summer day  
Turn around look at fall  
Winter hear my lonely call  
Way down  
  
The air is thin and the sky is fat  
Im gonna buy me a brand new hat  
Wear it out and go insane  
Christ I hope it never rains  
Way down  
  
Thought I saw a neon sign  
Flash my name with the time  
Probably didnt see a thing  
Crazy dreams and a broken wing  
Way down  
  
How ya gonna get sunshine  
Peeking through Venetian blinds  
Dont you know all that fear  
Begins and ends the same place  
Here  
Way down
