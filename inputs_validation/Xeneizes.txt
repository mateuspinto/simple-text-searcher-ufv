Welcome to the Quarashi game here I am the noname yeah the same boy  
Who doesnt need a frame Im surrounded by foes and anything goes so I gotta
be  
Like Tony Montana on his toes Up up and down your spinning round and round  
You dont know why your spinning maybe its the syntha sound but this is me  
you hear the rocking sonic youth theres an eye for an eye and a tooth for a  
tooth Another dimension on a frequency in ecstacy Biting bastards but in a
way  
licking sinners ashtray Trying to get through the Zoo and get no penalty I  
know how to beat because thats for the winners Im on the clouds ready to  
jump off in the free fall I see you all looking so small Stepping on  
stepping off I want to feel my skin blowing through the wind You gotta take  
it all back we allready got a stack what a get away deal if you dont know
what  
you lack and you gotta fix that if you want to get that up suck it out of a
tube  
and dont ever ever stop rocking that type o mad beat we lead the pack from a  
rack to a seat And so was I when I was trying to get by on planet 9 well  
nice try Tequila flats while Im flipping my hats I do the new jaywalking  
while I feed the stray cats on the one two three a dididumdidi you know youll  
get back when I say open Sesame
