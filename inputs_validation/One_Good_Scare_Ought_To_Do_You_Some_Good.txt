Phineas  
Come lets tiptoe into the dark  
One good scare ought to do it  
Youll find our bite much worse then our bark  
One good scare ought to do you some good  
If you should find the daily grind a tad bit taxing on my mind to help unwind
it so inclined  
I have a small suggestion  
That if you dare into my lair you should prepare for quite A scare  
But will you share in this nightmare will be my only question  
If your hair lies lifeless and limp one good scare ought do you are  
Come with me now dont be A wimp  
One little scare ought to do you some good  
That is quite right  
I would delight it taking flight into the night and finally give you such a
fright you know I surely would  
But if I seem a bit extreme at my attempts to make you scream  
Remember that this spooky scheme will cure your hiccups for good

Phineas and Scary Faces
