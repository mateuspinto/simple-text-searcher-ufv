Lets get out of this town baby were on fire  
Everyone around here wants to be going down down  
If you stick with me I can take you higher and higher  
It feels like all of our friends are lost  
Nobodys found found found  
  
I got so scared I thought no one could save me  
You came along scooped me up like a baby  
  
Every now and then the stars align  
Boy and girl meet by the great design  
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones  
  
Everybody told me love was blind  
Then I saw your face and you blew my mind  
Finally you and me are the lucky ones this time  
  
Bugging into my car got a bad desire  
You know that well never leave if we dont get out now now now  
Youre a crazy con and youre a crazy liar  
But baby nobody can compare to the way you get down down down  
  
I tried so hard to act nice like a lady  
You taught me that it was good to be crazy  
  
Every now and then the stars align  
Boy and girl meet by the great design  
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones  
  
Everybody told me love was blind  
Then I saw your face and you blew my mind  
Finally you and me are the lucky ones this time  
  
Feels like feels like you know it feels like  
Falling in love for the first time  
Feels like you know it feels like  
Falling in love  
  
Every now and then the stars align  
Boy and girl meet by the great design  
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones  
  
Everybody told me love was blind  
Then I saw your face and you blew my mind  
Finally you and me are the lucky ones this time
