Wake up everybody no more sleepin in bed  
No more backward thinkin time for thinkin ahead  
The world has changed so very much  
From what it used to be  
There is so much hatred war and poverty  
Oh yeah  
  
Wake up all the teachers time to teach a new way  
Maybe then theyll listen to whatcha have to say  
Cause theyre the ones whos coming up  
And the world is in their hands  
When you teach the children  
Teach em the very best you can  
Oh yeah  
  
Chorus  
The world wont get no better  
If we just let it be  
The world wont get no better  
We gotta change it yeah  
Just you and me  
  
Wake up all the doctors make the ol people well  
Theyre the ones who suffer an who catch all the hell  
But they dont have so very long before the Judgment Day  
So wontcha make them happy before they pass away  
  
Wake up all the builders time to build a new land  
I know we can do it if we all lend a hand  
The only thing we have to do is put it in our minds  
Surely things will work out cause they do every time  
  
The world wont get no better  
If we just let it be  
The world wont get no better  
We gotta change it yeah  
Just you and me  
  
Yeah yeah  
  
Its the God hour  
The morning I wake up  
Just for the breath of life I thank my maker  
My mom say I come from hustlers and shakers  
My mom buidin on skyscrapers and acres  
He said take us back to where we belong  
I try to write a song  
As sweet as the Psalms  
Though Im the type to bare arms  
And wear my heart on my sleeve  
Even when I fell in God I believe  
Read the days that weave through the maze  
The seasons so amazing  
Feed them and raised them  
Seasons are aging  
Earthquakes wars and rumors  
I want us to get by but  
Were more than consumers  
We more than shooters more than looters  
Created in this image so God live through us  
And even in this generation living through computers  
Only love love love can reboot us  
  
Wake up everybody no more sleepin in bed  
Wake up everybody  
Need a little help  
Cant do it alone  
Need a little help yall  
Cmon cmon cmon cmon  
Need a little help yall  
Cant do it alone  
Need a little help yall  
Cant do it alone  
Oh wake up everybody  
Wake up everybody  
Wake up everybody
