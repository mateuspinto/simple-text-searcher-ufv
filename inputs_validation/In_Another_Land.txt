In another land where the breeze and the  
Trees and flowers were blue  
I stood and held your hand  
And the grass grew high and the feathers floated by  
I stood and held your hand  
And nobody elses hand will ever do  
Nobody else will do  
Then I awoke  
Was this some kind of joke  
Much to my surprise  
I opened my eyes  
  
We walked across the sand and the sea and  
The sky and the castles were blue  
I stood and held your hand  
And the spray flew high and the feathers floated by  
I stood and held your hand  
And nobody elses hand will ever do  
Nobody else will do  
Then I awoke  
Was this some kind of joke  
Much to my surprise  
When I opened my eyes  
  
We heard the trumpets blow and the sky  
Turned red when I accidently said  
That I didnt know how I came to be here  
Not fast asleep in bed  
I stood and held your hand  
And nobody elses hand will ever do  
Nobody elses hand  
Then I awoke  
Was this some kind of joke  
I opened my eyes  
Much to my surprise
