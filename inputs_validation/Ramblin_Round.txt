By Woody Guthrie  
Ramblin around your city  
Ramblin around your town  
I never see a friend I know  
As I go ramblin round boys  
As I go ramblin round  
My mother hoped that I might be  
A man of some renown  
But I am just a refugee  
As I go ramblin round boys  
As I go ramblin round  
The peach trees they are loaded  
The branches bending down  
I pick em all day for a dollar boys  
As I go ramblin round  
As I go ramblin round  
Sometimes the fruit gets rotten  
And falls on to the ground  
Theres a hungry mouth for every peach  
As I go ramblin round boys  
As I go ramblin round
