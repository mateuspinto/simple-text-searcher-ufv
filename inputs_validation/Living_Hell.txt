Imprisoned in this world of darkness few have known  
A monster lusting blood and the hunger grows  
Out on the street dangers real the killers still at large  
A trail of death through sewers to the underground  
  
I feel their fleeting life draw into my bones  
Hear the heart that pounds the blood that flows  
Eternity I damn thee let me rot into the ground  
As the empty veins collapse cast them down  
  
Living hell whoa  
Living hell whoa  
Living hell whoa  
I just cant go on  
In this living hell  
  
This town has worn thin everybody knows  
Panic in the news and the terror grows  
A tunnel full of filth escape into the night  
Another hole to dwell in the underground  
  
I feel their fleeting life draw into my bones  
Hear the heart that pounds the blood that flows  
Eternity I damn thee let me rot into the ground  
As the empty veins collapse cast them down  
  
Living hell whoa  
Living hell whoa  
Living hell whoa  
I just cant go on  
In this living hell  
  
In this living hell  
In this living hell  
  
I feel their fleeting life draw into my bones  
Hear the heart that pounds the blood that flows  
Eternity I damn thee let me rot into the ground  
As the empty veins collapse cast them down  
  
Living hell whoa  
Living hell whoa  
Living hell whoa  
I just cant go on  
In this living hell
