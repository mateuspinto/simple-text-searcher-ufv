Love is real  
It is not just in novels  
Or the movies  
It is fact and it is standing here  
Right in front of you  
So if you just open your eyes  
Oh what a sweet discovery  
There is hope and there is joy  
And there is exceptance  
So now let all the light collect that collects on your plants  
Keep your wamr make you smile  
And I iwll be there with this pen in my hand  
To record all the while youll be laughing so loud  
That the house would shake with sound  
And everything will be as new as the day  
It was found  
  
Love is real  
It is not just in long distance commercials  
Or something that you thought you  
Felt back in highschool  
So I will turn black and white  
Become that horoscope your readin  
It predicts that something good is on its way  
Oh and Ill send you all the world green and blue  
In a box through the mail  
You can open it up hold it right in your hand  
And be glad that its there  
And be glad that youre there  
Now you can feel all the knotts in ur stomach  
They start to untie  
And suddenly its not so hard to say your alright  
  
Oh Love is real  
It is not just in poetry and stories  
It is truth and it will follow you  
Everywhere you go from now on  
So if you just cast off your doubts  
Then your lips would answer for you  
Oh my darling when you smile it is like a song  
  
And I can heart it now  
I can hear it now  
I can hear it now  
I can hear it now Can hear it now  
And I can hear it now  
I can hear it now  
I can hear it now
