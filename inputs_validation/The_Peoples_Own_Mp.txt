How many more must die now how many must we lose  
Before the island people their own destiny can choose  
From immortal Robert Emmet to Bobby Sands mp  
Who was given thirty thousand votes while in captivity  
  
No more hell hear the larks sweet notes upon the Ulster  
Air  
Or gaze upon the snowflake to calm his deep despair  
Before he went on hunger strike young Bobby did compose  
The Rhythm of Time The Weeping Wind and The Sleeping  
Rose  
  
He was a poet and a soldier he died courageously  
  
And we gave him thirty thousand votes he was the peoples  
Own mp  
  
Thomas Ashe gave everything in 1917  
The Lord Mayor of Cork Mcswiney died freedom to obtain  
Never a one of all our dead died more courageously  
Than Bobby Sands from Twinbrook the peoples own mp  
  
Forever well remember him that man who died in pain  
That his country north and south be united once again  
To mourn him is to organise and build a movement strong  
With ballot box and armalite with music and with song
