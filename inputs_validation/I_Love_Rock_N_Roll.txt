Hey is this thing on  
  
I saw him dancing there by the record machine ah  
I knew he must have been about 17  
The beat was going strong playin my favorite song  
I could tell it wouldnt be long till he was with me  
Yeah me  
I could tell it wouldnt be long till he was with me  
Yeah me  
  
Chorus  
Singing I love rock and roll  
So put another dime in the jukebox baby  
I love rock and roll  
So come and take the time and dance with me  
  
Owwwwwwwwwwww  
  
He smiled so I got up and asked for his name  
But that dont matter he said cuz its all the same  
He said can I take ya home where we can play alone  
And next were moving on and he was with me  
Yeah me  
We were movin on and singing that same old song  
Yeah me  
  
Chorus  
  
I love Rockn Roll yeah  
Cuz it soothes my sooouuuull

Yea yea yea  
  
He said can I take ya home where we can be alone  
And next were movin on and he was with me

And we were movin on and singing that same old song  
Yeah whit me  
  
Chorus x5
