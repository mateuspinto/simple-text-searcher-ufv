Well pay attention  
Attention to my words  
I love ya  
I dont know what you heard  
And this fire  
Has got to go for sure  
  
Red bowling ball  
Red bowling ball Ruth  
Well thats somethin  
Then I should know the truth  
I said you roll it  
And then it breaks your tooth  
  
Well Peter  
Are you in the wrong town  
Well I love this girl  
So hell shall come around  
And you leavin  
Will be the only sound
