So I sing you to sleep  
After the lovin  
With a song I just wrote yesterday  
And I hope you can hear  
What the words and the music have to say  
  
Its so hard to explain  
Everything that Im feelin  
Face to face I just seem to go dry  
Cause I love you so much  
That the sound of your voice can get me high  
  
Thanks for takin me Thanks for takin me  
On a one way trip to the sun On a one way trip to the sun  
And thanks for turnin me Turnin me  
Into a someone Someone  
  
So I sing you to sleep  
After the lovin  
I brush back the hair from your eyes  
And the love on your face  
Is so real that it makes me want to cry  
  
And I know that my song  
Isnt sayin anything new  
Oh but after the lovin  
Im still in love with you
