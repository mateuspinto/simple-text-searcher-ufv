From the beginning of this own world  
Man has shed a million tears  
Tears for the pain theyve had  
In their lives and for all the  
Wasted years  
But the saddest tears that ever fell  
Fell not from just any mans eyes  
But they were shed by my Savior  
And they stained The Sands Of Time  
As the Father looked upon His Son  
He had to turn His face away  
And as Jesus hung upon that cross  
He gave His all for us that day  
And as the tears ran down His face  
As He cried mixed with the blood  
That flowed from His side Oh what  
A sacrifice of love and it stained  
The Sands Of Time  
  
  
Oh yes it stained The Sands Of Time  
It stained The Sands Of Time  
The blood that was shed for a lost  
And dying world  
Oh yes it stained  
The Sands Of Time of time
