Oh when the saints go marching in  
Yes when the saints go marching in  
Oh Lord I want to be in that ever lovin number  
When the saints go marching in  
Oh when the saints go marching in  
Yes when the saints go marching in  
Oh Lord I want to be in that number  
When the saints go marching in  
Oh yes I had a dear old mother  
And if you should see her before I do  
Wont you tell her that you saw me coming  
I was struttin straight on through  
Oh when the saints go marching in  
Yes when the saints go marching in  
Oh Lord I want to be in that number  
When the saints go marching in
