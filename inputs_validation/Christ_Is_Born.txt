It is He Christ who is born today  
See Him crying in the manger  
King of Heaven  
Son of God  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
  
There He lies  
there with the lamkin  
Only swaddle for his garment  
With his Holy Mother Mary  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
  
Glory Glory Almighty God  
And on Earth  
Peace to All Men  
Hear the joyful angels singing  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
  
He is born  
let us adore Him  
Christ the Lord  
King of Kings  
Prince of Peace  
for All the Universe  
Hallelujah Hallelujah
