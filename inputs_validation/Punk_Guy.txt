Crazier than GG yet more PC than Ian  
Got colored teeth like Johnny  
Exudes a vicious disposition  
His hair sticks out like Colin did he jumps  
  
Similar to Springa he points his middle finga  
Not just he singer in the band  
Voted biggest asshole and role model of the year  
Got a face like Charles Bronson  
  
Straight outta Green Bay Wisconsin  
Not just a singer in the band  
Hell puke on you hell fuck your mom hell smoke while huffing gas  
He was the punkest mother fucker I ever did see  
  
Hell he was even more punk than me  
He shouldve been on the cover  
He shouldve been on the cover  
He shouldve been on the cover of Punk and Disorderly Volume II
