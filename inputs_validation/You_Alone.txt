My greatest joy is within Your presence  
Where the love You gave saved me  
And my most treasured times are in the stillness  
Where Your loving arms hold me  
  
Cause Youre all I want  
You are all I search for  
It is You Ive always longed for  
  
God I come  
To be here with You  
To be here for You and You alone  
  
I worship You  
With my heart and soul  
Everything I give to You alone  
  
All creation sings Your praises  
Crowns You Lord of all  
Kings and rulers bow before You  
Hail You Lord of lords
