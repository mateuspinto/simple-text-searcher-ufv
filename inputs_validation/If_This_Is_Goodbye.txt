Those famous last words are lying around in tatters  
Sounding absurd whatever I try  
But I Love you and thats all that really matters  
If this is goodbye if this is goodbye  
  
Bright shining sun would light up the way before me  
You were the one made me feel I could fly  
And I love you whatever is waiting for me  
If this is goodbye if this is goodbye  
  
Who knows howlong we got or what were made of  
Who knows if theres a plan or not  
There is our love I know there is our love  
  
Those famous last words could never tell the story  
Spending unheard and the dark of the sky  
But I love you and this is our glory  
If this is goodbye if this goodbye  
If this is goodbye if this goodbye
