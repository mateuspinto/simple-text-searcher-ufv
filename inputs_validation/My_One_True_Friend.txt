And now is it too late to say  
How you made my life so different in your quiet way  
I can see the joy in simple things  
A sunlit sky and all the songs we used to sing  
  
I have walked and I have I prayed  
I could forgive and we could start again  
In the end  
You are my one true friend  
  
For all all the times you closed your eyes  
Allowing me to stumble or to be surprised  
By life with all its twists and turns  
I made mistakes you always knew that I would learn  
  
And when I left its you who stayed  
You always knew that Id come home again  
In the end  
You are my one true friend  
  
Though love may break it never dies  
It changes shape through changing eyes  
What I denied I now can see  
You always were the light inside of me  
  
I know I know I know I know it was you  
  
I have walked and I have I prayed  
I could forgive and we could start again  
In the end you are my one true friend  
  
My one true friend  
I always always knew  
I always knew that it was you  
My one true friend
