Weather round here choppin and changin  
Surgery in the air  
Print shirts and southern accents  
Cigars and big hair  
We got the wheels and petrol is cheap  
Only went there for a week  
Git the sun got the sand  
Got the batteries in the handy cam  
Her eyes all swimming pool blue  
Dumb bells on a diving board  
Babys always attracted to the things shes afraid of  
Big girl with the sweet tooth  
Watches the skinny girl in the photo shoot  
Freshmen squeaky clean  
She tastes of chlorine  
  
Miami  
My mammy  
  
Love the movies  
Love to walk those movie sets  
Get to shoot someone in the foot  
Get to smoke some cigarettes  
No big deal we know the score  
Just back from the video store  
Got the car and the car chase  
Whats he got inside the case  
I want a close up of that face  
Here comes the car chase  
  
Miami  
My mammy  
Miami  
  
I bought two new suits  
Miami  
Pink and blue  
Miami  
I took a picture of you  
My mammy  
Getting hot in a photo booth  
Miami  
I said you looked like a madonna  
You said maybe  
Said I want to have your baby  
Baby  
Baby  
We could make something beautiful  
Something that wouldnt be a problem  
At least not in  
Miami  
Some places are like your auntie  
But theres no place like  
  
Miami  
My mammy  
  
Miami  
  
Miami
