Single file in the girls corridor  
Come along Stewart laddie  
  
Stewart boy youll never be much  
cause youre too busy acting the fool  
Thank you Sir for them few kind words  
On my last day of school  
  
Oh but my mama said I could be a success  
If Id only get myself out of bed  
Words of wisdom but I wasnt listening  
I had plans in my head  
  
Only a boy  
Trying it on  
Coming on strong  
Restless to roam  
Only a boy  
Silly and proud  
Reckless and loud  
Impressing the crowd  
Only a boy  
  
Rockn Roll was in my brain  
Eddie Cochrane running through my brain  
Skin tight trousers in council houses  
The unemployment exchange  
  
The blues I played were Mississippi made  
And evry Friday night Id fall in love  
Football fields and teenage pills  
Nothings enough  
  
Only a boy  
Dressing to kill  
Passion to spill  
Hand in the till  
Only a boy  
Slipping it in  
Thin as a pin  
Chasing a dream  
Only a boy  
  
Climb down off the school roof laddie  
  
Oh and them dukes of freedom I used to believe them  
And all their rebelious vows  
The critics the cynics who never understood it  
Where are they now  
  
And all the wondering and the stumbling  
That goes hand in hand with change  
The yearning the earning was it all part of learning  
Or am I still the same  
  
Only a boy  
Laughing aloud  
Quick as a shot  
Nobody can stop  
Only a boy  
Plans of his own  
Leaving his home  
Knows where hes going  
Only a boy  
  
Only a boy  
Only a boy  
Only a boy ha ha oh
