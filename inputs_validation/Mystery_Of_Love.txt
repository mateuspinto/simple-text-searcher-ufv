Seasons are changing  
Children of love are alive  
People reach out to survive  
Together  
  
Love is the message  
We carry across the sky  
Down through the passage of  
Time forever  
  
History unfolds  
As this storys told  
  
And its the mystery of love  
How we go on and on forever  
and its the mystery of love  
Coming to rescue  
Rescue me  
  
A man and a woman  
Lost in each others embrace  
Starcrossed in time in a place  
Far away  
Innocent dreamers  
Turning the wheels of chance  
Searching to find romance  
Forever  
  
We will surely find  
Love is for all time  
  
And its the mystery of love  
How we go on and on forever  
and its the mystery of love  
Only one heart can turn the key  
Down through the history  
Of love  
Time is the one that holds  
The answer  
and its the mystery of love  
Oh will it set me free  
  
For all time  
And its the mystery of love  
How we go on and on forever  
and its the mystery of love  
Only one heart can turn the key  
Down through the history  
Of love  
Time is the one that holds  
The answer  
and its the mystery of love  
How we go on and on forever  
and its the mystery of love  
Only one heart can turn the key
