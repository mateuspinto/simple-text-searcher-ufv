Verse 1In the little village of Bethlehem  
There lay a child one day  
And the sky was bright  
With a holy light  
Oer the place where Jesus lay  
  
Alleluia  
O how the angels sang  
Alleluia  
How it rang  
And the sky was bright  
With a holy light  
Twas the birthday of a King  
  
Twas a Humble birthplace  
But O  
How much God gave to us that day  
From the manger bed what a path has led  
What a perfect holy way  
  
Alleluia  
O how the angels sang  
Alleluia  
How it rang  
And the sky was bright  
With a Holy light  
Twas the birthday of a King
