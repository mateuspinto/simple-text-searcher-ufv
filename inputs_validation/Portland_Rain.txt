I stand out breaking in the Portland rain  
I see the end there in your eyes as I watch you drive away  
I walk back blind into my cold dreamhouse  
And I think about the damage  
I put the big light out  
I sit down smoking on my basement floor  
I hear footsteps up above me  
They are right outside my front door  
The only place that I want to be  
Is watching you move up on top of me  
The only sound that I want to hear  
Is the rain against my window as you whisper in my ear  
Baby you know I love it when you call me baby  
I go upstairs and find my twelveyearold  
Shes got tears running down her face  
Sitting sad at my piano  
She sings soft words from that old Beatles song  
And I think about my yesterday and all the things I did wrong  
The only place that I want to be  
Is watching you sweet dream in bed right next to me  
The only sound that I want to hear  
Is the rain against my window as I pull you near  
Dont give up on me  
Baby cant you you see  
We could make this be the way it used to be  
Dont give up on me  
I wish I could make you see  
That I am changing everyday trying to build a better me  
We could make this be the way its supposed to be  
Dont give up on me  
I stand out in the rain where I watched you drive away  
I never thought I would live to see  
This fuckedup day  
I stand out in the rain in the middle of the night  
I wish that it could wash away the beast inside  
The only thing I want to do is kiss you when I am coming deep inside of you  
The only sound that I want to hear  
Is the rain against my window as I hold you  
Dont give up on me  
Oh baby cant you see  
We could make this be the way it used to be  
Dont give up on me  
I wish I could make you see that I am changing everyday  
Trying to build a better me  
We could make this be the way its supposed to be  
Dont give up on me
