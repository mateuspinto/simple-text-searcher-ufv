Did you ever hear the story of the Christmas tree  
Who just didnt want to change the show  
He liked living in the woods and playing with squirrels  
He liked bicycles and snow  
He liked wolves and eagles and grizzly bears  
And critters and creatures that crawled  
Why bugs were some of his very best friends  
Spiders and ants and all  
Now thats not to say that he ever looked down  
On a vision of twinkled lights  
Or on mirrored bubbles and peppermint canes  
And a thousand other delights  
And he often had dreams of tiny reindeer  
And a jolly old man in a sleigh  
Full of toys and presents and wonderful things  
And a story of Christmas day  
Oh Alfie believed in Christmas alright  
He was full of Christmas cheer  
All of each and every day  
And all throughout the year  
To Him it was more than a special time  
Much more than a special day  
It was more than a beautiful story  
It was a special kind of way  
You see some folks have never heard a jingle bell ring  
And theyve never heard of Santa Claus  
Theyve never heard the story of the Son Of God  
And that made Alfie pause  
Did that mean that theyd never know of peace on earth  
Or the brotherhood of man  
Or know how to love or know how to give  
If they cant no one can  
You see life is a very special kind of thing  
Not just for a chosen few  
But for each and every living breathing thing  
Not just me and you  
So when youre at Christmas prayers this year  
Alfie asked me if Id ask you  
Say a prayer for the wind and the water and the wood  
And those who live there too
