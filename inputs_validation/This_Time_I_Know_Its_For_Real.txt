What would I have to do  
To get you to notice me too  
Do I  
Stand in line  
One of a million  
Admiring eyes  
  
Walk a tightrope way up high  
Write your name across the sky  
  
Im going crazy just to let you know  
Youd be amazed how much I love you so baby  
When I get my hands on you I wont let go  
This time I know its for real  
  
Should I write or call your home  
Shout it out with a megaphone  
Radio tv news  
Got to find a way  
To get the message to you  
  
To say I love you with a neon sign  
Anything to make you mine  
  
Im going crazy just to let you know  
If I wait too long for you I might explode oh baby  
Ive been around the block enough to know  
This time I know its for real  
  
Ooo baby  
This time this time this time this time  
Oh baby  
This time this time oh baby  
  
Walk a tightrope way up high  
Write your name across the sky  
  
Im going crazy just to let you know  
Youd be amazed how much I love you so oh baby  
When I get my hands on you I wont let go  
This time I know its for real  
  
Im going crazy just to let you know  
If I wait too long for you I might explode oh baby  
Ive been around the block enough to know  
This time I know its for real
