Like a candle  
Burning bright  
Love is glowing in your eyes  
A flame to light our way  
That burns brighter everyday  
But now I have you  
Nobody loves me like you do  
  
Like a leaf  
Upon the wind  
I could find a place to land  
I dream the hours away  
And wonder everyday  
Do dreams come true  
Nobody loves me like you do  
  
Chorus  
What if I never met you  
Where would I be right now  
Funny how life just falls in place somehow  
Oh you touched my heart in places  
That I never even knew  
Cause nobody loves me like you do  
  
Mm I was words without a tune  
I was a song still unsung  
Poem with no rhyme  
A dancer out of time  
But now theres you  
Nobody loves me like you do  
  
Chorus  
  
Nobody loves me  
Nobody loves me like you do  
Nobody loves me like you do
