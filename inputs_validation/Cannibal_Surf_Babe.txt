Lets meet up and get beat up  
  
Well she tied me to the headboard with a surf leash  
And her wet hair hugged her body like a longlost friend  
And I really tried my best to get across to her  
But nothing she would say could be defended  
  
Well her birthday suit it was her only present  
When I looked into her eyes  no history  
And I told her eating people wasnt pleasant  
But she laughed a snake eye laugh and walked away from me  
  
And I watched her as she walked across the coals  
I watched her as she walked across the coals  
  
Singing I was born in nineteen sixty weird  
And Im your nightmare surfer babe  
Mr Wilson wheres your sandbox and your beard  
You still looking for the perfect microwave  
  
So I really did my best to get across to her  
I said One day every pebble hits the beach  
And I kissed her face and held her like a longlost friend  
But she was too far out there to be reached  
To be reached  
She was too far out there  
  
She was singing I was born in nineteen sixty weird  
Im your nightmare surfer babe  
Mr Wilson wheres your sandbox and your beard  
You still looking for the perfect microwave  
  
And the sun came up over the mountain  
And the waves rolled in across the bay  
And the fabulous brightlycoloured birds flew up out of the forest  
And she said Well were all heavens beautiful children living together in
paradise  
Lie down my dear youre going to enjoy this  
  
And she looked like shed had sex  
With a Tyrannosaurus Rex  
  
Singing I was born in nineteen sixty weird old man  
Im your nightmare surfer babe  
Mr Wilson wheres your sandbox and your beard  
You still looking for that perfect microwave  
Perfect microwave  
  
And I watched her as she walked across the coals  
  
And the sun came up over the mountain  
And the waves rolled in across the bay  
And the fabulous brightlycoloured birds flew up out of the forest  
And she said Well were all heavens beautiful children living together in
paradise  
Lie down my dear you have enjoyed this
