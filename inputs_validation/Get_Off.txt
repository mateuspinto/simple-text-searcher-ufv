New power  
Let down your funky  
Get off  
Get off baby  
  
What can a brother do when the clock keeps ticking you off  
Turn the other cheek or kick a nut til it coughs  
Get off get off  
  
On the positive tip Im equipped with a whip  
I dont have to spank you cause this is my ship  
Get off get off get off baby  
  
I will still be hip when the words from your lip  
take a dip in the ratings  
And Ill be stripping your Mercedes of your lubricated lady  
And taking her for a walk taking her for a walk  
  
On the positive tip Im equipped with a whip  
I dont have to spank you cause this is my ship  
Get off get off  
Get off get off  
  
Uh is this a dream No  
Everybody get off  
Is this a dream  
Is this a dream  
Getogetogetoget off  
  
On the positive tip Im equipped with a whip  
I dont have to spank you cause this is my ship  
Get off get off I got the best of you  
Get off hey hey sugar  
Get off  
  
Once I give her back to ya  
She wont ever want to do ya  
Cause I wrote the book  
I taught her how to look  
She showed me the money you gave her I took  
I even ate her cooking thats more than you did  
  
Get off get off  
  
What can a brother do when the clock keeps ticking you off  
Turn the other cheek or kick a nut til it coughs  
Get off uh help me  
Get off  
  
Get get get off
