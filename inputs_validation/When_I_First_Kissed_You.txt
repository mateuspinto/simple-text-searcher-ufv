New york city can be so pretty  
from a birds eye view  
Because up there  
Yeah thats where I first kissed you  
A modern day romance  
A perfect performance  
Acting like two fools  
Saying silly things  
Whisper sweet nothings  
Live young lovers only do  
  
I was shaking  
You were breathtaking  
Like the empire state  
My voice was so far  
Not quite Sinatra  
Singing songs so great  
The clock struck one  
The night still very young  
In the city that never sleeps  
Then a whirlwind blew  
When I first kissed you  
Nearly swept me  
Swept me off my feet  
  
When I first kissed you  
Thats when I knew  
I was in love  
  
Because up there  
Yeah thats where  
I first kissed you
