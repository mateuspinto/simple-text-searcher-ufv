Someone says  
Wake up child  
And throw your life away  
See you in the crime file  
What will your mama say  
  
Sometimes you get angry  
No focus in your life  
When people get hungry  
They learn how to survive  
  
Chorus  
Changing every day  
Changing every day  
Changing every day  
Changing every day  
  
Summer syncopation  
The space between your eyes  
Is a place for heroes  
That never compromise  
  
Sometimes you feel lonely  
No focus or surprise  
Pushed into production  
What a way to live our lives  
  
Chorus
