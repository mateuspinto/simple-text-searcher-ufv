Oh my dear oh my dear sweet love  
Oh my dear oh my dear sweet love  
When Im away from you when Im away from you  
Well I feel yeah well I feel so sad and blue  
Well I feel well I feel so sad and blue  
Oh my dear oh my dear oh my dear sweet love  
When Im away from you I just have to sing my hymns  
Hymns to the silence hymns to the silence  
Hymns to the silence hymns to the silence  
  
Oh my dear oh my dear sweet love its a long long journey  
Long long journey journey back home  
Back home to you feel you by my side  
Long journey journey journey  
Yeah in the midnight in the midnight I burn the candle  
Burn the candle at both ends burn the candle at both ends  
Burn the candle at both ends burn the candle at both ends  
And I keep on cause I cant sleep at night  
Until the daylight comes through  
And I just and I just have to sing  
Sing my hymns to the silence  
Hymns to the silence hymns to the silence  
My hymns to the silence  
  
I want to go out in the countryside  
Oh sit by the clear cool crystal water  
Get my spirit way back to the feeling  
Deep in my soul I want to feel  
Oh so close to the One close to the One  
Close to the One close to the One  
And thats why I keep on singing baby  
My hymns to the silence hymns to the silence  
Oh my hymns to the silence hymns to the silence  
Oh hymns to the silence oh hymns to the silence  
Oh hymns to the silence hymns to the silence  
Oh my dear my dear sweet love  
Can you feel the silence can you feel the silence  
Can you feel the silence can you feel the silence  
  
Hymns to the silence hymns to the silence  
Hymns to the silence hymns to the silence  
Hymns to the silence hymns to the silence  
Hymns to the silence hymns to the silence  
Hymns to the silence hymns to the silence
