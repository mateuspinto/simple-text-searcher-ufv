He talked to me like I was smart he sexed me up  
All the time I did not get it was this my time to shine  
I did not get it had my luck finally turned  
  
I saved up to take him out at night  
He said the restaurant was all wrong  
He said he had a dream about me  
And in that dream I was beautiful  
I made him a present it was a photograph of me  
I did not get it he said it did not cost me anything
