Hey come this May  
Well be running in the sun again your time will come  
Youre just a young broken heart  
Been out sleepin in the yard how could you be so dumb  
  
CHORUS  
All we losers stand in line just waiting for our time  
Broken angel take that plane and finger paint the sky  
Til everything shines  
Everything shines  
Everything shines  
Everything shines  
Hey broken clock  
Hhavent heard your old tick tocking man for much too long  
And lonely jukebox  
Iin the corner of the nightclub man I need your song  
I need your song  
  
CHORUS
