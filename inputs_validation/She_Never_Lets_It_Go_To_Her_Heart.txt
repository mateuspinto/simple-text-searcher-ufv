Everywhere I go  
Theyre staring at her  
Every man I know  
He wants to have her  
I guess I ought to be a jealous man  
Id look the other way  
Theyre hittin on her  
Every night and day they telephone her  
They try to get to her but I know they cant  
  
Chorus  
Cause she never lets it go to her heart  
She never lets it go that far  
When they start talking  
She starts walking  
Right back to my arms  
She can turn every head  
But she never lets it go to her heart  
  
She walks into the room  
And everybody watches every move  
Hoping she dont love me  
I know it by the way they hang around  
But they dont realize  
Theres more to her than what meets the eye  
Thats why Im certain  
No matter what they do to reach her now  
  
Chorus  
  
When they start talking  
She starts walking  
Right back to my arms  
She can turn every head  
But she never lets it go never lets it go  
To her heart
