I have been given  
One moment from heaven  
As I am walking  
Surrounded by night  
Stars high above me  
Make a wish under moonlight  
  
On my way home  
I remember  
Only good days  
On my way home  
I remember all the best days  
Im on my way home  
I can remember  
Every new day  
  
I move in silence  
With each step taken  
Snow falling round me  
Like angels in flight  
Far in the distance  
Is my wish under moonlight  
  
On my way home  
I remember  
Only good days  
On my way home  
I remember all the best days  
Im on my way home  
I can remember  
Every new day
