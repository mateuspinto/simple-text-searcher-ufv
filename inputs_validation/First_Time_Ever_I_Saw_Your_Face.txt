The first time ever I saw your face  
I thought the sun rose in your eyes  
And the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave  
To the dark and the endless sky my love  
  
And the first time ever I kissed your mouth  
I felt the earth move through my hands  
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird  
That was there at my command  
  
And the first time ever I lay with you  
I felt your heart so close to mine  
And I know our joy would fill the earth  
And last till the end of time my love  
  
The first time ever I saw your face
