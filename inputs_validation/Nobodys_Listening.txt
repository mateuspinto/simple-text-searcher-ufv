Come come come coming at you  
Come coming at you  
Come coming at you  
Peep the style and the kids checking for it  
The number one question is  
How could you ignore it  
We drop right back in the cut  
Over basement tracks  
With raps that got you backing this up like rewind that  
Were just rolling with the rhythm  
Rise from the ashes of stylistic division  
With these nonstop lyrics of life living  
Not to be forgotten  
But still unforgiven  
But in the meantime there are those who want to  
Talk this and that so I suppose  
It gets to a point feelings gotta get hurt  
And get dirty with the people spreading the dirt  
  
Chorus  
Try to give you warning  
But everyone ignores me  
Told you everything loud and clear  
But nobodys listening  
Call to you so clearly  
But you dont want to hear me  
Told you everything loud and clear  
But nobodys listening  
  
I got a  
Heart full of pain head full of stress  
Handful of anger held in my chest  
And everythings left is a waste of time  
I hate my rhymes  
But hate everyone elses more  
Im riding on the back of this pressure  
Guessing that its better  
I cant keep myself together  
Because all of this stress  
Gave me something to write on  
The pain gave me something  
I could set my sights on  
You never forget the blood sweat and tears  
The uphill struggle over the years  
The fear and trash talking  
And the people it was to  
And the people that started it  
Just like you  
  
Chorus  
  
I got a  
Heart full of pain head full of stress  
Handful of anger held in my chest  
Uphill struggle blood sweat and tears  
Nothing to gain everything to fear  
  
Scratches  
Coming at you at every style
