Used to ride the highway  
I used to know where I was going  
Now this shady dirt road is feelin cool beneath my feet  
Used to ride on  
To get to where I was going in a day  
Now Ive got to stop  
And go and stop and go along the way  
  
Was a fool to waste my time  
Just searchin my mind  
But the more I find  
The more I find the time to search  
Used to ride on  
To get to where I was going in a daze  
And now Ive got to stop  
And go and stop and go along the way
