I want to top the rose petals that whisper sweet  
Come on  
So dark dark so dark  
So dark dark so dark  
  
Inside lookin out my window  
I dont see nothin but rain  
Sun up in the sky just a shinin just a shinin  
Still Im lost in my shadow of pain  
  
Like an innocent man thats on death row  
I dont understand what made you go  
And want to leave me baby  
Leave me in the dark  
  
Can you tell me tell me  
  
You took my sex and my money money  
Took all my self esteem yes you did  
You had the nerve to think it was funny funny  
I never knew a bitch so mean yes sir  
  
You absolutely drove a man to tears  
All I really know is that you sincerely  
You want to hurt me baby oh yes you do  
You want to hurt me in the dark  
  
Sunshine Somebody make the sun shine  
Dark cloud Somebody take this dark cloud away  
  
Just as sure as Noah built the ark  
Thats how sure  
Thats how sure I am you broke my heart  
  
How could you baby leave me in the dark  
Baby so dark  
So dark dark so dark  
Feel like the sun aint never gonna shine  
You left me in the dark  
So dark dark so dark  
I dont know I dont know why we ever had to part  
Baby cant see a damn thing out my window its so dark so dark  
So dark dark so dark  
  
Sometimes I want to curse the ground you walk on  
Even when I know that everything you feel I feel it to  
I want to curse you baby  
You left me in the dark  
And now I want to I want to curse you baby  
For leavin me alone alone alone  
You left me in the dark yes you did  
  
And now all I want to say is  
In the dark  
Ow you left me  
Ow you left me  
Its like being on death row In the dark  
I dont understand why you had to go  
I dont understand why you hurt me in the dark  
Dont understand why you hurt me in the dark  
Dont understand why you hurt me hurt me hurt me  
Hurt me hurt me in hurt me in  
Hurt me hurt me hurt me hurt me in the dark  
Just leave me  
In the dark  
  
In the dark  
So dark dark so dark In the dark  
So dark dark so dark  
In the dark
