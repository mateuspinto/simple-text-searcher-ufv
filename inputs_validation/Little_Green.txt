Born with the moon in Cancer  
Choose her a name she will answer to  
Call her green and the winters cannot fade her  
Call her green for the children whove made her  
Little green be a gypsy dancer  
  
He went to California  
Hearing that everythings warmer there  
So you write him a letter and say Her eyes are blue  
He sends you a poem and shes lost to you  
Little green hes a nonconformer  
  
Just a little green  
Like the color when the spring is born  
Therell be crocuses to bring to school tomorrow  
Just a little green  
Like the nights when the Northern lights perform  
Therell be icicles and birthday clothes  
And sometimes therell be sorrow  
  
Child with a child pretending  
Weary of lies you are sending home  
So you sign all the papers in the family name  
Youre sad and youre sorry but youre not ashamed  
Little green have a happy ending  
  
Just a little green  
Like the color when the spring is born  
Therell be crocuses to bring to school tomorrow  
Just a little green  
Like the nights when the Northern lights perform  
Therell be icicles and birthday clothes  
And sometimes therell be sorrow
