When I sing I cant bring everything on the wing  
Flying down from dizzy air  
To the ground because I care  
You will be love and your love will live  
When I smile I beguile all the while every mile  
As I walk across the sky  
Of the clockwork of your eye  
You will be love and your love will live  
Casting spells from the well I can tell you the bells  
Listen to my magic voice  
Learn the tune of childrens toys  
You will be love and your love will live  
When I die do not cry hear my sigh passing by  
After I have turned to win  
I will try to help you then  
You will be love and your love will live
