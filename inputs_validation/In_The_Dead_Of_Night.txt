Are you one of mine who can sleep with one eye open wide  
Agonizing psychotic solitary hours to decide  
Reaching for the light at the slightest noise from the floor  
Palms of hands perspire heart goes leaping at a knock from the door  
In the Dead of Night  
In the Dead of Night  
Rich and powerful ascend complicated bends to be free  
To indulge in what they will and jaded thrill or fanstasy  
Shuttered windows that belie all stifled cries from within  
And prying eyes are blind to proceedings of the kind that begin  
In the Dead of Night  
In the Dead of Night
