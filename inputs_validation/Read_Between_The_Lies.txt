Evangelist you claim God speaks through you  
Your restless mouth full of lies gains popularity  
You care not for the old that suffer  
When empty pockets cry from hunger  
  
Penniless from their generosity  
Sharing their money to quench your greed  
Searching for the answer to their prayers  
They cry their last wish of need  
Save me  
  
His spirit lives and breathes in me  
The almighty transformed to your screen  
The meanings lost in its translation  
No holy words describe his deception  
  
You say youll help us find the lord  
Tell me preacher how do you know  
A simple quest for a visible savior  
To lead us through our final prayer  
Save me  
  
Send your donations  
Contribute to the cause  
Luxuries  
Your righteous reward  
  
Praise the lord praise god  
Is what you wish to sell  
There is no heaven without a hell  
  
In your minds eye could you truly believe  
That by giving you can save your soul  
Could you be so naive  
You heal the sickyou raise the dead  
You blind the congregation  
With the things you say  
  
Religious blackmail a deceit of trust  
That death will come and all will be lost  
  
Can you hear the serpents call  
Look deep in those deceiving eyes  
Ignore the writing on the wall  
You should read between the lies  
  
When doubt subsides his honesty  
An inquiry is it blasphemy  
Impure the soul thats made to suffer  
No sermons left to hide or cover  
An empty promise lie unfulfilled  
To steal a dream or get it killed  
They claim your trip to heavens nearby  
You may believe it but Satan wouldnt lie
