I would dare you but I know I dont need to  
Youre going to do just what you want to  
Youre going to take the leading chair at the fairground  
Youre going to sing the praises of your fruit  
  
Mine smell like honey uh  
Mine smell like honey uh  
Mine smell like hu hu hu hu honey uh  
  
Dig a hole dig it deeper deeper  
Climb a mountain climb it steeper steeper  
Dig a hole Dig it deeper deeper  
Track a trail of honey through it all  
  
If the end comes faster than we had expected  
And predictions lead us to the final fall  
If the flowers crack the grain and weave the patterns of the pavement  
I can hear you shouting over it all  
  
Mine smell like honey uh  
Mine smell like honey uh  
Mine smell like hu hu hu hu honey uh  
  
Dig a hole dig it deeper deeper  
Climb a mountain climb it steeper steeper  
Dig a hole Dig it deeper deeper  
Track a trail of honey through it all  
  
Dig a hole dig it deeper deeper  
Climb a mountain climb it steeper steeper  
Dig a hole Dig it deeper deeper  
Track a trail of honey through it all  
  
You track a trail of honey through it all  
You track a trail of honey
