I dont want to live in a world of darkness  
I want to live in a world of light  
I dont want to live in a world thats heartless  
I want to live in a world of sight  
Well you know I want to make the world turn around  
Living in a world of justice  
Living in a world of shame  
Living in a world of freedom  
Living in a world of pain  
Well you know I want to make the world turn around  
Turn the darkness into light  
Turn the hunger into life  
Turn the wrong into right  
Put an end to the strife  
Turn the blindness into sight  
Save a human life  
Make the world turn around  
I want to live in a world of gladness  
I want to know what your heart is made of  
Dont want to live in a world of sadness  
I want to live in a world of love  
Well you know I want to make the world turn around  
Living in a world of justice  
Living in a world of light  
Living in a world of freedom  
Living in a world of sight  
I want to send a message  
To every boy and girl  
I want to send a message  
About the world  
We got to build it up  
Stop tearing it down  
We got to build it up  
Make the world turn around
