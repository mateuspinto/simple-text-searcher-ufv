The most hunted and most wanted  
With a pocket full of hundreds you know how we run it

Anticipation 213  
We contemplate and regulate  
Now we got the game tight its money to make money money money  
The game wont wait but you can wait for the game  
Worldwide tour with skirts screamin our name  
  
The hits dont stop because the game wont change

The hits dont stop because the game dont wait  
I got no time for no payin much rate  
I gotta go out and buy some brand new clothes
