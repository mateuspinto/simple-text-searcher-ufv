Well I see youve got a new boyfriend  
Got your mixed up husband too  
I got 25 dollars in my pocket  
Want me to spend it all on you  
But I know that you cheat on all of us  
Thats just the way that you do  
Hey girl I dont care where youve been  
I know Ive been there too  
  
Chorus  
Woo woo baby Do you think thats fair  
Do we really have to be so lonely and so scared  
Woo woo baby Do you think thats fair  
Well I know this is up to me and you  
We make this thing turn out like we want to  
Well last time I thought about you  
Didnt really think that much  
And the last time we spoke you said  
You were afraid of my touch  
And then you went your way  
I stumbled down a highway I went mine  
You know I think its funny the  
Way infatuation gets beat up by the time  
  
Chorus  
  
Well I see your life has evolved  
Into one big masquerade  
And all of those old fools you used to run to  
They shot you full of old age  
Well dont go expecting too much no no  
From this new love affair  
Probably fall flat on its face  
No one to pick you up no one who cares  
  
Chorus
