What I must do to hold you in my hands  
Is give you all I have and be right here with you  
  
Something happened on the way  
Something I dont want to lose  
Stared my heart right in the face  
Telling me the truth telling me it to you

Is be right here with you  
I know that I need to give you all I am  
And this time we make it stand stand right here with you  
  
Of all the things I wanted most  
Here you are the one I need  
Now for all the times I did not know  
So let my love go free now I speak

Is be right here with you

And this time make it stand stand right here with you

Theres one thing I must do
