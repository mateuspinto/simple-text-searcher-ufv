I went to pick this little girl up I met last night  
Shes ready waitin for me under the front porch light  
She said Aint it dark out there ooh its so dark out there  
I hope your car got bright lights ooh its so dark out there  
  
We went to a house party it was really outta sight  
It was about forty people dancin under one dim light  
Aint it dark in there ooh its too dark in there  
Will you take me somewhere else darlin cause its too dark in there  
  
So I drove her out the freeway into the country air  
She said I hope you aint gonna park around here nowhere  
Its too dark out there so dark out there  
Lets go back into town and do something cause its too dark out there  
  
So I asked her just where she had in mind to go  
She said Maybe to a scary movie picture show  
I said Its too dark in there  
I said Its too dark in there  
Ive seen that movie before baby its too dark in there  
  
So it was nothing left for me to do but take her back home  
Twas no one there the lights was out and the fuse was blown  
And it was dark in there yes it was dark in there  
And we finally got the fuse in  
Ooh it was dark in there
