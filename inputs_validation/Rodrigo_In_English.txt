Arunjuez a place of love and dreams  
Where crystal fountains  
Playing in the garden seem  
To murmer to the roses  
  
Arunjuez the dry and faded leaves  
Now swept away by the wind  
Are memories of the romance  
You and I once began  
And then for no reason forgot  
  
Perhaps that love is hiding  
In the twilight  
In the breeze or in a flower  
Awaiting your return  
  
Arunjuez the dry and faded leaves  
  
In Arunjuez my love  
You and I
