I think of you and I together  
I picture you and I as one  
When we sit there in  
The firelight baby  
When we wake to the morning sun  
And though you may leave me  
Were never apart  
Youre Always In My Heart  
  
When youre standing at the window  
With the moonlight in your hair  
And you turn and smile  
My favorite smile  
I just have to stop and stare  
And babe when you hold me  
I go off the chart  
Youre Always In My Heart  
  
Stay with me stay  
Stay with me babe forever  
Be by my side  
Lets spend our lives together  
  
I picture you and I together  
I think of you and I for years  
And if youre ever lost or worries Baby  
Ill be there to calm your fears  
I think that Ive loved you  
Right from the start  
  
Always In My Heart  
Always In My Heart
