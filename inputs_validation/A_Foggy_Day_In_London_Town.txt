I was a stranger in the city  
Out of town were the people I knew  
I had that feeling of selfpity  
What to do What to do What to do  
The outlook was decidedly blue  
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone  
It turned out to be the luckiest day Ive known  
  
A foggy day in London Town  
Had me low and had me down  
I viewed the morning with alarm  
The British Museum had lost its charm  
How long I wondered could this thing last  
But the age of miracles hadnt passed  
For suddenly I saw you there  
And through foggy London Town  
The sun was shining everywhere
