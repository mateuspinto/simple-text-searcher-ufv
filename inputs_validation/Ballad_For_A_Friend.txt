Sad Im sittin on the railroad track  
Watchin that old smokestack  
Train is aleavin but it wont be back  
  
Years ago we hang around  
Watchin trains roll through the town  
Now that train is agraveyard bound  
  
Where we go up in that North country  
Lakes and streams and mines so free  
I had no better friend than he  
  
Something happened to him that day  
I thought I heard a stranger say  
I hung my head and stole away  
  
A diesel truck was headin down  
Pullin down a heavy load  
It left him on a Utah road  
  
They carried him back to his home town  
His mother cried his sister moaned  
Listenin to them church bells tone  
  
A diesel truck was rollin slow  
Pullin down a heavy load  
And it left him on a Utah road
