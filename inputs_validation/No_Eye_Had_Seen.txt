No eye had seen  
No ear had heard  
Til hosts on high  
Proclaimed the birth  
And heaven brought down  
Quietly with no one watching  
Its only child  
From the womb of perfect peace  
The son of man  
Wellspring of our joy delivered  
The world reconciled  
Into earthly destiny  
  
And song broke forth  
Angelic strain  
And none could help  
But sing the name  
  
Emmanuel  
Kyrie eleison we sing  
Emmanuel  
Glory to the newborn King  
Emmanuel  
Mortal and immortal voices  
Emmanuel  
Endless praises echoing
