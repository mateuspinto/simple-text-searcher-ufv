Walking in the pouring rain  
Walking with Jesus and Jane  
Jane was in her turtleneck  
I was much happier then  
  
If I were to ask you  
What would you do with yourself  
If I were to tell you  
Would you just talk to yourself  
  
Am I asking oh for so much  
Im not asking to be understood  
Am I asking oh for so much  
Im just looking for a brand new friend  
A brand new friend  
  
Walking in the pouring rain  
Walking with Jesus and Jane  
Jane was in her turtleneck  
I was much happier then  
  
Am I asking oh for so much  
You could do anything you wanted to  
Am I asking oh for so much  
No just something that I can hold down  
Cause its all downhill now  
  
So let me count the times that we swore and lied that wed  
Tie ourself to the railway line  
Let me count the times when of course we lied  
Well we knew no better it was no crime  
Let me count the times  
  
I well I dont know when I when Ill be content  
But I do know I need a brand new friend
