This is the start of something beautiful  
This is the start of something new  
You are the one whod make me lose it all  
You are the start of something new ooh  
  
And Ill throw it all away  
And watch you fall into my arms again  
And Ill throw it all away  
Watch you fall now  
  
You are the earth that I will stand upon  
You are the words that I will sing  
  
And Ive thrown it all away  
And watched you fall into his arms again  
And I thrown it all away  
Watched you fall now  
  
And take me back  
Take me home  
Watch me fall  
Down to earth  
Take me back for  
  
This is the start of something beautiful  
You are the start of something new
