Moon blue rivers of love you shine Bathe me in light sublime  
Flood me with all your glowing heart can give  
Moon blue memories bind like chains  
When will you come again  
I wait in darkness just for your bright to beam  
Cause Im not afraid of the consequence  
Of being in love with you  
And Id rather be alone some nights  
Awaiting your full hue  
For though the sun makes bright the day  
My world is dark when theres no you  
You light my skies and make dark night bright day Moon blue  
Moon blue your beautys seen by all the yearning of your call  
Travels the world and then makes home my soul  
Moon blue lift me to starry heights I long to live within your light  
Solace of mind my heart is yours for always  
Cause Im not afraid of the consequence  
Of being in love with you  
And Id rather be alone some nights  
Awaiting your full hue  
For though the sun makes bright the day  
My world is dark when theres no you  
You light my skies and make dark night bright day Moon blue
