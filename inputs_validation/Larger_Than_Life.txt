If you want to make believe  
Theres nothing up my sleeve  
Im a man as man can be  
As you can plainly see  
  
Dont want to see no tears  
Eliminate your fears  
When you think youve seen it all baby  
  
You cant believe your eyes what you heard werent lies  
My love is too much to hold too much to hold  
Much to much  
  
Im someone you cant fight  
Im plain in size  
You cant believe your eyes  
What you heard were not lies  
Im too much to hold  
I cant be bought or sold  
Im far more than a man  
Im gonna make you understand  
Im larger than a life size man  
  
And you cant believe your eyes what you heard werent lies  
My love is too much to hold too much to hold  
  
My love is larger than life ooh larger than life  
My love is larger than life larger than life  
My love is too much to hold it cant be sold oh no  
  
You cant believe your eyes what you heard werent lies  
My love is too much to hold too much to hold  
  
My love is larger than life larger than life  
My love is larger than life larger than life  
My love is too much to hold it cant be sold oh no  
Im larger than a life size man  
  
My love is larger than life larger than life  
My love is larger than life ooh larger than life  
My love is too much to hold it cant be sold oh no
