A beautiful and blinding morning  
The world outside begins to breathe  
See clouds arriving without warning  
I need you here to shelter me  
  
And I know that only time will tell us how  
To carry on without each other  
  
So keep me awake to memorize you  
Give me more time to feel this way  
We cant stay like this forever  
But I can have you next to me today  
  
If I could make these moments endless  
If I could stop the winds of change  
If we just keep our eyes wide open  
Then everything would stay the same  
  
And I know that only time will tell me how  
Well carry on without each other  
  
So keep me awake for every moment  
Give us more time to be this way  
We cant stay like this forever  
But I can have you next to me today  
  
Well let tomorrow wait youre here right now with me  
All my fears just fall away when you are all I see  
  
We cant stay like this forever  
But I have you here today  
  
And I will remember  
Oh I will remember  
Remember all the love we shared today
