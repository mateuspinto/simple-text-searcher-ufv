It takes a lot to know what is love  
Its not the big things but the little things  
That can mean enough  
A lot of prayers to get me through  
And there is never a day that passes by  
I dont think of you  
You were always there for me  
Pushing me and guiding me  
Always to succeed  
  
Chorus  
You showed me  
When I was young just how to grow  
You showed me  
Everything that I should know  
You showed me  
Just how to walk without your hands  
Cause mom you always were  
The perfect fan  
  
God has been so good  
Blessing me with a family  
Who did all they could  
And Ive had many years of grace  
And it flatters me when I see a smile on your face  
I want to thank you for what youve done  
In hopes I can give back to you  
And be the perfect son  
  
Chorus  
  
You showed me how to love  
You showed me how to care  
And you showed me that you would  
always be there  
I want to thank you for that time  
And Im proud to say youre mine  
  
Chorus  
  
Cause mom you always were  
Mom you always were  
Mom you always were  
you know you always were  
Cause mom you always were the perfect fan  
  
I love you mom
