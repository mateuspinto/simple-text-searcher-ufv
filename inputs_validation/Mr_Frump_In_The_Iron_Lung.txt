I visit Mr Frump in the hospital  
I see him most every day  
And when I see Mr Frump in his iron lung  
This is what I hear him say  
  
whyknow Mr Frump is my very best friend  
Hes never a chump or a tease  
He never tells me lies and best of all  
He never disagrees  
  
I bring him candy and flowers every afternoon  
Sit down by his side and say Hi  
And then I ask him his opinion of the world situation  
And I wait for Mr Frumps reply and Mr Frump would say  
  
Well unfortunately soon it came to be  
Mr Frumps dying day  
And now I bring to you the very last thing  
That Mr Frump had to say  
  
deep breathing that fades and dies off  
  
Amen
