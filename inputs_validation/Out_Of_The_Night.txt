Out of the night  
You came movin  
Out of the night  
Movin so cool  
Lookin for a lover  
Lookin for a friend  
You must surely be some new kind of cool  
Out of the night  
You came running  
Didnt have to baby  
But you just couldnt stop  
Said that you love me  
But you wont tell me why  
You better watch it  
Watch it watch it watch it watch it  
Pretty baby or youre gonna make me cry  
I wear my heart on my sleeve  
You know the one I love Ill never leave  
Im not blind to the shining light  
Of a heart thats true in the middle of the night  
Out of the night  
You came movin  
Out of the night  
Movin so cool  
Say that you love me but dont tell me why  
You got to want me want me want me  
Got to want me pretty baby  
Or youre gonna make me cry  
Take me for a lover take me for a friend  
cause you know if you do  
I will stay here with you to the end  
I wear my heart on my sleeve  
You know the one I love Ill never leave  
Im not blind to the shining light  
Of a heart thats true in the middle of the night  
Out of the night  
And into the dawn  
We keep movin movin movin movin movin  
Pretty baby we keep movin on  
Dont worry bout tomorrow  
Or yesterday  
We got to live this life  
That we love from day to day to day to day to day
