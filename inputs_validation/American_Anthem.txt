All weve been given  
By those who came before  
The dream of a nation  
Where freedom would endure  
The work and prayers  
Of centuries  
Have brought us to this day  
What shall be our legacy  
What will our children say  
Let them say of me  
I was one who believed  
In sharing the blessings  
I received  
Let me know in my heart  
When my days are through  
America  
America  
I gave my best to you  
Each generation from the plains  
To distant shore with the gifts  
What they were given  
Were determined  
To leave more  
Valiant battles fought together  
Acts of conscience fought alone  
These are the seeds  
From which America has grown  
Let them say of me  
I was one who believed  
In sharing the blessings  
I received  
Let me know in my heart  
When my days are through  
America  
America  
I gave my best to you  
For those who think  
They have nothing to share  
Who fear in their hearts  
There is no hero there  
Know each quiet act  
Of dignity is  
That which fortifies  
The soul of a nation  
That never dies  
Let them say of me  
I was one who believed  
In sharing the blessings  
I received  
Let me know in my heart  
When my days are through  
America  
America  
I gave my best to you
