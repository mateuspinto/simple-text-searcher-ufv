Still falling  
Breathless and on again  
Inside today  
Beside me today  
Around broken in two  
Till you eyes shed  
Into dust  
Like two strangers  
Turning into dust  
Till my hand shook with the way I fear  
  
I could possibly be fading  
Or have something more to gain  
I could feel myself growing colder  
I could feel myself under your fate  
Under your fate  
  
It was you breathless and tall  
I could feel my eyes turning into dust  
And two strangers turning into dust  
Turning into dust
