My body is sanctuary  
My blood is pure  
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo  
You want me bad  
I think youre cool  
But Im not sure  
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo  
  
Follow me  
Dont be such a holy fool  
Follow me  
I need something more from you  
Its not about sex or champagne  
You holy fool  
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo  
  
Chorus  
If you want me  
Meet me at electric chapel  
If you want me  
Meet me at electric chapel  
If you wanna steal my heart away  
Meet me meet me baby in a safe place  
Come on meet me  
In electric chapel  
  
Come dance to me where you have been  
Next to the bar  
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo  
Pray for your sins  
Right under the glass disco ball  
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo  
  
Follow me  
Dont be such a holy fool  
Follow me  
I need something sacred from you  
Together well both find a way  
To make it pure  
Love working in dirty way  
  
Chorus  
  
Ho oh oh oh ho oh oh oh  
Uh uh uh uh uh uh  
Ho oh oh oh

If you want me  
Meet me in electric chapel  
Oh if you want me  
Meet me in electric chapel  
If you wanna steal my heart away  
Meet me meet me baby in a safe place  
Come on meet me  
In electric chapel  
Oh oh
