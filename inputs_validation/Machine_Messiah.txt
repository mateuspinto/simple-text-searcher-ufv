Run down a street  
Where the glass shows  
That summer has gone  
Age in the doorways  
Resenting the pace of the dawn  
All of them standing in line  
All of them waiting for time  
From time the great healer  
The machineMessiah  
Is born  
  
Cables that carry the life  
To the cities we build  
Threads that link diamonds of life  
To the satanic mills  
Ah to see in every way  
That we feel it every  
Day and know that  
Maybe well change  
Offered the chance  
To finally unlearn our lessons  
And alter our stance  
  
Friends make their way into systems of chance  
Reply friends make their way of escape into systems of chance  
Escape to freedom I need to be there  
Waiting and watching the tables are turning  
Im waiting and watching  
I need to be there  
  
I care to see them walk away  
And to be there when they say  
They will return  
  
Machine Messiah  
The mindless  
Search for a higher  
Controller  
Take me to the fire  
And hold me  
Show me the strength of your  
Singular eye  
  
History dictating symptoms of ruling romance  
Claws at the shores of the water upon which we dance  
All of us standing in line  
All of us waiting for time  
To feel it all the way  
And to be there when they  
Say they know that  
Maybe well change  
Offered the chance  
To finally unlearn our lessons  
And alter our stance  
  
Machine machine Messiah  
Take me into the fire  
  
Hold me machine Messiah  
And show me  
The strength of your singular eye
