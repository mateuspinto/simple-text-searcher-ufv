Morning found me lyin on a floor in New Orleans  
Looking like the patches was about to eat my jeans  
Feeling like my belly was a warehouse for the blues  
And I sure miss my sweet Cocaine Carolina  
Met her on an oceanliner called her Cocaine Carolina  
She was quite a lady then and I was twenty two  
God knows how much I adored her I just never could afford her  
Cocaine Carolina how did I get hooked on you  
So goodbye Cocaine Carolina you and I are through  
Im going back to Sandy Scag she knows just what to do  
She dont love me for my money she just wants my body honey  
Cocaine Carolina how did I get hooked on you  
Oh someone said if I was lucky I could go back to Kentucky  
Lexington was famous for its bluegrass and its hills  
Carolina we should get up dont you know well have to split up  
Maybe I should go to California  
So goodbye Cocaine Carolina you and I are through  
Im going back to Sandy Scag she knows just what to do  
She dont love me for my money she just wants my body honey  
Cocaine Carolina how did I get hooked on you  
Oh goodbye Cocaine Carolina  
Oh goodbye Cocaine Carolina
