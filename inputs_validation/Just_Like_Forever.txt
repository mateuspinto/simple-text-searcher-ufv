Jackson Browne  
  
Unreleased Jackson Browne song sung in concert a few times  
  
It wasnt me at your window Baby  
It wasnt me at your door  
It must have been some other fool  
With his heart in his hand  
Coming back for more  
  
I was there when you closed your eyes  
But it wasnt me when you came  
I just thought I heard you call my name  
  
You were there when I needed someone  
With your warmth and your style  
I was back in the world again  
And it was real for awhile  
  
I was ready for love to be coming  
But not for what love became  
And I thought I heard you call my name  
  
Call my name  
Now there was something only we knew together  
Far too simple to explain  
Love smiled on us just like forever  
  
Youre always leaving town  
First you come around  
Then you cant be found  
It always brings me down  
  
Theres nothing wrong with my heart Baby  
Theres nothing wrong with the world  
If a girl dont feel the same way I feel  
Theres nothing wrong with the girl  
  
Maybe we were too different to love each other  
Maybe too much the same  
Anyway I thought I heard you call my name  
  
Call my name  
Like you were drifting away down the river  
All my voices and curses in the pain  
Love flows on just like forever  
  
Youre always leaving town  
First you come around  
Then you cant be found  
And it always brings me down  
  
Da da da da da  
Da da da dum dum dum  
Da da da  
Ohhhh no no no no no no  
Na na na na na  
  
Just like forever  
Da da da da da  
Just like forever  
Just like forever
