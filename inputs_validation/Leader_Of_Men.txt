Tell your friends not to think aloud  
Until they swallow  
Whisper things into my brain  
Your voice sounds so hollow  
  
I am not a leader of men  
Since I prefer to follow  
Do you think I could have a drink  
Since its so hard to swallow  
So hard to swallow  
  
So turn the television off  
And I will sing a song  
And if you suddenly have the urge  
You can sing along  
  
I touch your hand I touch your face  
I think the fruit is rotten  
Give me lessons on how to breath  
Cause I think Ive forgotten  
I think Ive forgotten  
  
One day up to a cliff  
That overlooked the water  
I jumped in to save a girl  
It was somebodys daughter  
And now the ring is on my hand  
It was given to me by her  
To this day we all sit around  
And dream of ways to get higher  
To get much higher
