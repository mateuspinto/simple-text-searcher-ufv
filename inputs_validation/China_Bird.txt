One fine day these words I pray  
Will breathe a truth  
Within yourself upon a shelf  
A life anew  
So many roads  
Its hard to know what to do  
All your dreams  
All it seems  
Is as you choose  
For destiny my china bird  
Is calling for you  
  
The world turns  
The flame burns  
Bright and true  
Near and far  
Where you are  
Guiding you china bird  
The open skies  
Is yearning for you  
  
If they say its not that way  
Hold your view  
Fly above and with my love  
A light anew  
Oh spread your wings  
The open sky  
Is calling to you china bird  
My heart is yearning for you  
  
If you fly away  
Ill be waiting come what may  
All my love a fragile ray  
For you for you
