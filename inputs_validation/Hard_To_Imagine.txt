Paint a picture using only gray  
Light your pillow lay back watch the flames  
Ill tell a story no one would listen that long  
  
Its hard to imagine its hard to imagine  
Tear into yourself count tales on your arm  
Ah the beating tickin like a bomb  
After having seen all that they saw  
  
Its hard to imagine its hard to imagine  
Things were different then all is different now  
I tried to explain somehow  
Things were different then all is different now  
I tried to explain somehow  
  
Things were different then all is different now  
I tried to explain I hope this works somehow  
Things were different then all is different now  
I tried to explain oh somehow  
Ooh oh oh
