Am I blue am I blue  
Aint these tears in my eyes telling you  
Am I blue You would be too  
If each plan with your man just fell through  
  
Was a time I was his only one  
Now Im the sad and lonely one  
Ooh was I gay till today  
Now hes gone and were through am I blue  
  
Was a time I was the only one  
Now Im the sad and lonely one  
Ooh was I gay till today  
Now hes gone and were through am I blue am I blue  
  
Ooh ho am I blue
