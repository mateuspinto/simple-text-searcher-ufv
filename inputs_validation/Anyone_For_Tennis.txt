Twice upon a time  
In the valley of the tears  
The auctioneer is bidding  
For a box of fading years  
And the elephants are dancing  
On the graves of squealing mice  
  
Anyone for tennis  
Wouldnt that be nice  
  
And the icecreams are all melting  
On the streets of bloody beer  
While the beggars stain the pavements  
With fluorescent Christmas cheer  
And the Bentleydriving guru  
Is putting up his price  
  
Anyone for tennis  
Wouldnt that be nice  
  
And the prophets in the boutiques  
Give out messages of hope  
With jingle bells and fairy tales  
And blind colliding scopes  
And you can tell theyre all the same  
Underneath the pretty lies  
  
Anyone for tennis  
Wouldnt that be nice  
  
Yellow Buddhist monk  
Is burning brightly at the zoo  
You can bring a bowl of rice  
And then a glass of water too  
And fate is setting up the chessboard  
While death rolls out the dice  
  
Anyone for tennis  
Wouldnt that be nice
