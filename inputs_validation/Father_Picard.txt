A new chaplain has arrived  
Madeleine and a few other nuns  
At the convent will meet him tonight  
Father picard  
welcome to my quarters do come inside  
Welcome dearest sisters come into the light  
Im father picard Im taking over  
Things will be different here  
You are the four God has chosen  
To be his angels in white  
Drink my sweet holy wine  
oh yeah come on its not a crime  
From now on every Sunday this time  
You will attend this communion of mine  
Father picard is hiding something  
A white powder for the wine  
Father picard  
Im father picard Im taking over  
Things will be different here  
You are the four God has chosen  
To be his angels in white  
Drink my sweet holy wine  
The nuns freak out lust in their eyes  
From now on every Sunday this time  
Father picards in control of their minds  
Father picard is hiding something  
A white powder for the wine
