In the town of Springhill Nova Scotia  
Down in the dark of the Cumberland Mine  
Theres blood on the coal and the miners lie  
In the roads that never saw sun nor sky  
In the roads that never saw sun nor sky  
  
In the town of Springhill you dont sleep easy  
Often the earth will tremble and roar  
When the earth is restless miners die  
Bone and blood is the price of coal  
Bone and blood is the price of coal  
  
In the town of Springhill Nova Scotia  
Late in the year of fiftyeight  
Day still comes and the sun still shines  
But its Dark as the grave in the Cumberland mine  
But its Dark as the grave in the Cumberland mine  
  
Down at the coal face miners working  
Rattle of the belt and the cutters blade  
Rumble of the rock and the walls closed round  
The Living and the dead men two miles down  
The Living and the dead men two miles down  
  
Twelve men lay two miles from the pit shaft  
Twelve men lay in the dark and sang  
Long hot days in the miners tomb  
It was Three feet high and a hundred long  
It was Three feet high and a hundred long  
  
Three days past and the lamps gave out  
And Caleb Rushton got up and and said  
Theres no more water or light or bread  
So well Live on song and hope instead  
So well Live on song and hope instead  
  
Listen for the shouts of the barefaced miners  
Listen through the rubble for a rescue team  
Six hundred feet of coal and slag  
Hope imprisoned in a three foot seam  
Hope imprisoned in a three foot seam  
  
Eight days passes and some were rescued  
Leaving the dead to lie alone  
Through all their lives they dug their grave  
Two miles of earth for a marking stone  
Two miles of earth for a marking stone
