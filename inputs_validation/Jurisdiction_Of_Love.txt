Someone said that  
No one knows what  
Goes on inside  
Someone in love  
Strange as it seems  
It makes them do things  
In their right minds  
Would never think of  
People get away with things  
They dont deserve  
A jurisdiction of love  
Enoughs not enough  
When love gets rough  
The jurisdiction of love  
Off their walls  
Just like Niagara Falls  
Logical thought  
Is no comfort  
It only makes the  
Matter seem worse  
Might equals right  
In connubial fight  
The jurisdiction of love  
Love equals war  
I dont like it no more  
The jurisdiction of love  
Someone said that  
No one knows what  
Goes on inside  
Someone in love  
People get away with things  
They dont deserve  
A jurisdiction of love  
When love turns the crank  
It demands Carte Blanche  
The jurisdiction of love  
Might equals right  
In connubial fight  
The jurisdiction of love  
Love equals war  
I dont like it no more  
The jurisdiction of love
