Sitting in Darwins theory  
And youre down in the 48  
Im practicing politics  
Your practicing guitar and staying out late  
Howd we get so turned around  
Why did we make it so hard  
Why cant we cut it out tender  
Give us something good to remember  
  
Hey my my my my rock star  
Saw your feet leave the ground  
You said all I wanted to be is loud  
I was ushering your friends in  
I was I was  
I was trying to clear the aisles  
Howd you get so turned around  
Why did you make it so hard  
Why cant you cut it out Im tender  
Give me something good to remember  
  
I said  
Cut it out  
Cut it all out  
  
So its Alaska in the summertime  
In the wintertime Im free  
The days are short cold and wasted  
Nowhere is warm enough for me  
Baby you tell me what happened  
Why did I make it so hard  
Cant I cut it our youre tender  
Give you something good to remember  
  
Baby you tell me what happened  
Why did we make it so hard  
How did I make it so hard  
Can you tell me what happened  
I wonder  
Oh cut it out Im tender  
Why did we make it so hard  
Give me something  
Give me something good to remember  
Why did we make it so hard  
Why did we make it so hard  
Can you tell me what happened  
Why did we make it so hard  
Can you tell me what happened  
Why did you make it so hard  
can you tell me what happened  
Why did we make it so hard  
Can you tell me what happened  
  
I said  
Cut it out  
Cut it all out  
Cut it out  
Cut it all out  
  
Hey my my my rock star

How did we get so turned around
