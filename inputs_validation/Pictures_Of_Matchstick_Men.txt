Oh Ah Oh Ah  
  
When I look up to the sky  
I see your eyes in a funny kind of yellow  
I rush to bed I soak my head  
I see your face underneath my pillow  
  
I wake next morning tossed and yawning  
I see your face come peeping through my window  
Oh no  
  
Oh Ah Oh Ah  
  
Pictures of matchstick men and you  
Images of matchstick men and you  
All I ever see is them and you  
  
Oh Ah Oh Ah  
  
Windows echo your reflection  
When I look in their direction  
Gone  
Yeah theyre gone  
  
When will this haunting stop  
Your face just wont leave me alone  
Oh no  
  
Pictures of matchstick men and you  
Images of matchstick men and you  
All I ever see is them and you  
  
Oh youre in the sky  
Youre with this guy  
You make men cry you lie  
  
Pictures of matchstick men  
Pictures of matchstick men  
Pictures of matchstick men  
Pictures of matchstick men  
Pictures of matchstick men  
Pictures of matchstick men  
  
I can see those matchstick men  
I can see those matchstick men  
I can see those matchstick men  
I can see those matchstick men  
I can see those matchstick men  
I can see those matchstick men
