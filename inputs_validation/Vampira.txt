Hey  
Black dress moves in a blue movie  
Graverobbers from outer space  
Well your pulmonary trembles in your outstretched arm  
Tremble so wicked  
  
Two inch nails  
Micro waist  
With a pale white feline face  
Inclination eyebrows to there  
  
Mistress to the horror kid  
cemetery of the white love ghoul well  
Take off your shabby dress  
Come and lay beside me  
  
Come a little bit closer  
Come a little bit closer  
Come a little bit closer  
Come a little bit closer to this  
  
Vampira Vampira Vampira  
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
