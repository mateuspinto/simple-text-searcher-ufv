In your brown eyes walked away  
In your brown eyes couldnt stay  
In your brown eyes you watch her go  
  
And turn the record on  
And wonder what went wrong  
What went wrong  
  
If everything was everything  
But everything is over  
Everything could be everything  
If only we were older  
  
Guess its just a silly song about you  
And how I lost you  
And your brown eyes  
  
In your brown eyes I was feeling low  
Cause theyre brown eyes and you never know  
Got some brown eyes but a soft face  
  
I knew that it was wrong  
So baby turn the record on  
Play that song  
  
Where everything was everything  
But everything is over  
Everything could be everything  
If only we were older  
  
I guess its just a silly song about you  
And how I lost you  
And your brown eyes  
  
Brown eyes  
  
Everything was everything  
But baby its the last show  
Everything could be everything  
But its time to say goodbye so  
Get your last fix and your last hit  
Grab your old girl with her new tricks  
  
Honey yeah its no surprise  
I got lost in your brown eyes  
  
In your brown eyes  
Brown brown eyes  
Your brown eyes  
Brown brown eyes  
Got some brown eyes  
Brown brown eyes  
Your brown eyes
