Lets take a slow boat to china leave from south carolina  
Lets take our time and go the long way  
On a junk boat to thailand with your hand in mine hand  
I sure hope we got something to say

For awhile

New way to play those same old games  
The stars just might show us and the captain will know us  
Shake our hands and call us by our first names  
Well send a postcard to grandpa of a vase or rickshaw  
He dont care

On the bay
