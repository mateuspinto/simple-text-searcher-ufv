I saw you  
And you saw me  
And I didnt even know your name  
Just one look  
That was all it took  
And I knew Id never be the same  
If walkin on air compares to what I feel  
Then how can I keep it sealed when  
  
Chorus  
I want to tell the world  
If the smile on my face  
Hasnt given me away already  
I want to tell the world  
There aint no way to hide it  
Your love has got me flyin high  
Since the day  
  
That you looked my way  
I knew we were meant to be together  
Now I thank the Lord  
For a love like yours  
Cause I know its gonna last forever  
Its hard to believe my dreams have all come true  
And Im so in love with you that  
  
Chorus  
  
I just want the world to know  
Love has got me good to go  
I want to tell the world I want to tell the world  
I have got to get it out  
She is all I think about  
I want to tell the world I want to tell the world  
Its something that I need to say  
Love has overtaken me  
  
Chorus
