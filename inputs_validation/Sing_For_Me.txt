Look at me  
And listen close  
So I can tell you how I feel before I go  
Just a year  
Its not much time  
For me to show you I am proud that you are mine  
  
I wish I had known  
The future in my heart  
Was just about to start  
  
Say tomorrow  
I can follow you there  
Just close your eyes  
And sing for me  
I will hear you  
Always near you  
And Ill give you the words  
Just sing for me  
  
Every lock  
On every door  
I put them there to try and hide you from the world  
And you kicked  
Yeah you screamed  
You never understood youre everything to me  
  
I just hope you know  
The future in your heart  
Is just about to start  
  
Say tomorrow  
I can follow you there  
Just close your eyes  
And sing for me  
I will hear you  
Always near you  
And Ill give you the words  
Just sing for me  
  
No looking back when I am gone  
Sing for me  
Following your heart its never wrong  
Sing for me  
No looking back when I am gone  
Sing for me  
Dont second guess the note youre on  
  
Out of time  
All out of fight  
You are the only thing in life that I got right  
  
Say tomorrow  
I can follow you there  
Just close your eyes  
And sing for me  
I will hear you  
Always hear you  
And Ill give you the words  
Just sing for me  
  
Just close your eyes  
And sing for me  
Just close your eyes  
And sing for me
