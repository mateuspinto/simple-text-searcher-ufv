Oh yeah  
7 am thinking bout you  
Wondering  
If the thoughts Im feeling  
Youre feeling too  
Like a new born child  
Soft to the touch  
Baby is it possible  
To love someone so much  
I wish I may  
I wish I might  
Be that certain someone  
You wish for every night  
If you knew what I knew  
You wouldnt say what you said  
Say what you said  
If you knew what I knew  
Wed be together instead  
Together instead  
Of you breaking my heart  
Breaking my heart  
Over things that arent true  
My lady yes my lady  
My lady  
If you knew what I knew  
Time passes by  
The only tears I cry  
Are filled with disillusion  
And fears I have inside  
Like a lost soul  
I feel like Im all alone  
All alone  
If only I could feel your pain  
Within your heart of stone woh oh  
I wish I may  
I wish I might  
Be that certain someone  
You wish for every night  
If you knew what I knew  
You wouldnt say what you said  
Say what you said  
If you knew what I knew  
Wed be together instead  
Together instead  
Of you breaking my heart  
Breaking my heart  
Over things that arent true  
My lady yes my lady  
If you knew what I knew  
Then you wouldnt have to go away  
If you knew what I knew  
Then you would be here to stay  
Right by my side always  
Always  
If you knew what I knew  
You wouldnt say what you said  
Say what you said  
If you knew what I knew  
Wed be together instead  
Of you breaking my heart  
Breaking my heart  
Over things that arent true  
My lady yes my lady  
My lady  
If you knew what I knew my baby  
You would have never have said what you said  
If you knew what I knew my baby  
We would be together instead  
If you knew what I knew my baby  
You would have never have said what you said  
If you knew what I knew my baby  
We would be together instead  
Girl if you knew  
Say what you said  
If only you knew my baby  
We would be together instead  
Girl if you knew  
If you knew what I knew my baby  
You know you will always  
You would have never have said what you said  
If you knew what I knew my baby  
We would be together instead  
Girl if you you knew  
If you knew what I knew my baby  
Say what you said  
You would have never have said what you said  
If you knew what I knew my baby  
We would be together instead  
Girl if you you knew  
If you knew what I knew my baby  
Say what you said  
You would have never have said what you said  
If you knew what I knew my baby  
We would be together instead
