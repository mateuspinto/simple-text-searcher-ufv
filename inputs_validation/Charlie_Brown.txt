Stole a key  
Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet  
Took a car downtown and took what they offered me  
To set me free  
  
I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene  
I saw the lights go down and standing in front of me  
  
In my scarecrow dreams  
When they smashed my heart into smithereens  
Be a bright red rose come bursting the concrete  
Be the cartoon heart  
  
Light a fire light a spark  
Light a fire a flame in my heart  
  
Well run wild oh  
Well be glowing in the dark  
Well be glowing in the dark  
  
All the boys all the girls  
All that matters in the world  
All the boys all the girls  
All that matters that occurs  
All the highs all the lows  
As the room is spinning oh  
  
Well run wild  
Well be glowing in the dark  
  
Living innocent wild  
Well be glowing in the dark
