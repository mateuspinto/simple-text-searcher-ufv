Guard your body with the best barbed wire  
And ward off foe with the fiercest of fire  
But let love unguarded into the strangest of nights  
  
Wear your dresses like theyre up for hire  
And leave them with your humour in the tumble dryer  
And watch yourself stumble down a lane with no lights  
  
School like life turns some men into mice  
What you need now is a little piece of mouse advice  
  
Well they say be wary of strangers  
Especially if they offer you sweets  
But there aint no government health warning  
On half the mad fuckers you meet  
  
Save yourself personal tradegy  
Go back to the man with the sweets  
Do yourself schooling favour  
Head back to the man with the sweets  
  
Those who feared cancer never had much to say  
They bored us at parties onto forty a day  
They forced us into corners and onto forty a day  
  
The dentiists chair is the only time  
That anybody ever looks at their mouth  
Let the dentist give their teeth something to chatter about  
  
School like life turns some men into mice  
To avoid the rattrap take the mouses advice  
  
Well they say be wary of strangers  
Especially if they offer you sweets  
But there aint no government health warning  
On half the mad fuckers you meet  
  
Save yourself personal tradegy  
Go back to the man with the sweets  
Do yourself schooling favour  
Head back to the man with the sweets
