Whenever its a rainy day  
I pack my troubles up in my room  
I chase all the clouds away  
I get myself back to the womb  
  
But I know that youre gonna cry  
Tears are runnin from your eyes  
The piece of my life you take  
Is one that so often breaks  
  
Whenever you are miles away  
I think of you the way you are  
Your shining lips your auburn hair  
And then it dont seem quite so far  
  
Well I know that youre gonna cry  
Tears are runnin from your eyes  
The piece of my life you take  
Is one that so often breaks  
  
Well I know that youre gonna cry  
Tears are runnin from your eyes  
The piece of my life you take  
Is one that so often breaks
