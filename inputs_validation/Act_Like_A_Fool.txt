Dolly Parton  
You make me act like a fool  
You treat me mean and cold and cruel  
You make me do things that I hate to do  
Why do you make me act like a fool  
Now that you know just how much I care  
You treat me mean and it aint right nor fair  
I keep holdin on though I dont know what to  
While you make me act like a fool  
You know just how to hurt me and you often do  
When were out in publib I start fightin with you  
You start trouble in private when nobody knows  
Oh then you go away smellin just like a rose  
Though you make me act like a fool  
You treat me mean cold and cruel  
You make me do things that I hate to do  
Oh why must you make me act like a fool  
You know just how to hurt me as you often do  
You start flirtin in public with somebody new  
You start trouble in private when nobody knows  
Oh then you go away smellin just like a rose  
Though you make me act like a fool  
You treat mean and cold and cruel  
You make me do things that I hate to do  
Oh but why do you make oh why do I let you  
Make me look like a fool
