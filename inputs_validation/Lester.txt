Saw my life go flashin past  
In the eyes of a faithful friend  
Four legs four lives  
And the screechin tires never seem to end  
  
I will change if Lester lives  
Not mess him round just cause I own him  
He was nearly wiped away  
But he had good luck and strong bones  
  
You make me clench my teeth  
Us humans aint got dignity  
Eat my plants and steal my things  
Youre the head of security  
  
I will change if Lester lives  
Not mess him round just cause I own him  
He was nearly wiped away  
But he had good luck and strong bones  
Inside and behind him  
  
I will change if Lester lives  
Not mess him round just cause I own him
