I used to get feels on a bitch  
Now I throw shields on the dick  
To stop me from that HIV shit  
And niggaz know they soft like a Twinkie filling  
Playin the villian  
Prepare for this rap killin  
Biggie Smalls is the illest  
Your style is played out like Arnold wondered  
What you talkin bout Willis  
The thrill is gone the black Frank White  
is here to excite and  
throw dick to dykes  
Bitches I like em brainless  
Guns I like em stainless steel  
I want the fuckin Fortune like the Wheel  
I squeeze gats till my clips is empty  
Dont tempt me THOD Man  
You dont want to fuck with Biggie  
  
Here I am Ill be damned if this aint some shit  
Come to spread the butter lyrics over hominy grit  
Its the low killer death trap yes Im a jet black ninja  
Comin where you rest at surrender  
Step inside the ring youse the number one contender  
Lookin cold booty like your pussy in December  
Nigga stop bitchin button up ya lip and  
From Method all you gettin is a can of asswhippin  
Hey Ill be kickin you son you doin all the yappin  
Actin as if it cant happen  
You front and got me mad enough to touch somethin  
Yo Im from Shaolin Island and aint afraid to bust somethin  
So what cha want nigga ya punk nigga  
I got a sixshooter and a horse named Trigger  
Its real ninetyfour rugged raw  
Kickin down your god damn door and it goes a lil somethin like this  
  
Fuck the world dont ask me for shit  
And everything you get ya gotta work hard for it  
Honies shake your hips ya dont stop  
And niggaz pack the clips keep on  
  
Verse two comin with that Olde E brew  
Methtical puttin niggaz back in ICU  
Im lifted troop you can bring yours wack ass crew  
I got connections Ill get that ass stuck like glue huh  
No question I be comin down and shit  
Yo I gets rugged as a motherfuckin carpet get  
And niggaz love it not in the physical form but in the mental  
I spark and they cells get warm  
Im not a gentle man Im a Method Man  
Baby accept it utmost respect it  
Assume the position Stop look and listen  
I spit on your grave then I grab my Charles Dickens  
  
Welcome to my center  
Honies feel it deep in they placenta  
Cold as the pole in the winter  
Far from the inventor but I got this rap shit sewed  
And when my Mac unloads  
Im guaranteed another video  
Ready to die why I act that way  
Pop Duke left Mom Duke  
The faggot took the back way  
So instead of makin hoes suck my dick up  
I used to do stickup  
Cause hoes is irritatin like the hicCUPS  
Excuse me flows just grow through me  
Like trees to branches  
Cliffs to avalanches  
Its the praying mantis  
Deep like the mind of Farrakhan  
A motherfuckin rap phenomenon plus  
  
I got more glocks and techs than you  
I make it hot Nigga wont even stand next to you  
Nigga touch me you better bust me  
tree times in the head  
Or motherfuckers dead ya thought so  
  
Fuck the world dont ask me for shit  
And everything you get ya gotta work hard for it  
Honies shake your hips ya dont stop  
And niggaz pack the clips keep on  
  
Fuck the world dont ask me for shit  
And everything you get ya gotta work hard for it  
Honies shake your hips ya dont stop  
And niggaz pack the clips keep on
