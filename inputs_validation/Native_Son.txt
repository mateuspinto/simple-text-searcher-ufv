Mount up move on  
May you find the way back home  
  
Down and down we go  
Down into bright October  
Brothers in arms no more  
Now that the war is over  
Have you waded in  
And been to hell  
Will you lie upon the sofa  
See to the decoration of your shell  
Now that the war is over  
  
Mount up move on  
Damn the darkness  
Speed the dawn  
They lost we won  
Try to find  
Your way back home native son  
  
Down and down we go  
Down into bright October  
Brothers in arms no more  
Now that the war is over  
Have you waded in  
And been to hell  
Will you lie upon the sofa  
See to the decoration of your shell  
Now that the war is over  
  
Mount up move on  
Damn the darkness  
Speed the dawn  
They lost we won  
Try to find  
Your way back home native son
