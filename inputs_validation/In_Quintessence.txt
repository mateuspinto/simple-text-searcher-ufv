He smokes himself into double vision  
Leaves his mind on an indecision  
Thinks hes invented imagination  
Says that god is some relation  
He leaves his cigarette burning on the desk  
His clothes and magazines make up such a mess  
Sitting up in bed transistor on his chest  
In quintessence  
  
He and his friends sit around all evening  
Leaving their laughter upon the ceiling  
Seems so funny yet it leaves me yawning  
Then I find its the following morning  
He says his girlfriend lives too far away  
Always at a friends house or on holiday  
His bible of romance hides itself away  
In quintessence  
  
A 15 year olds browse through life  
Is fine with his quintessence safe and sound in mind  
Lifes an adolescence from time to time  
With us all  
In quintessence  
  
In the corner with his book and tissue  
All he can do is pretend to miss you  
Closes his eyes as he sees her body  
Pulls funny faces and thats his hobby  
On the other hand love aint a happy word  
On the other hand love aint a piece of skirt  
Makes for something special in your football shirt  
In quintessence
