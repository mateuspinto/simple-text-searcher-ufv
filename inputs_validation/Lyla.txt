Calling all the stars to fall  
And catch the silver sunlight in your hands  
Call for me to set me free  
Lift me up and take me where I stand  
  
She believes in everything  
And everyone and you and yours and mine  
I waited for a thousand years  
For you to come and blow me off my mind  
  
Hey Lyla  
The stars about to fall  
So what you say Lyla  
The world around us makes me feel so  
Small Lyla  
If you cant hear me call  
Then I cant say Lyla  
Heaven help you catch me if I fall  
  
Shes the queen of all Ive seen  
And every song and city far and near  
Heaven help my mademoiselle  
She rings the bell for all the world to hear  
  
Hey Lyla  
The stars about to fall  
So what you say Lyla  
The world around us makes me feel so  
Small Lyla  
If you cant hear me call  
Then I cant say Lyla  
Heaven help you catch me if I fall  
  
Hey Lyla  
The stars about to fall  
So what you say Lyla  
The world around us makes me feel so  
Small Lyla  
If you cant hear me call  
Then I cant say Lyla  
Heaven help you catch me if I fall  
  
Hey Lyla  
Hey Lyla  
Hey Lyla  
Hey Lyla
