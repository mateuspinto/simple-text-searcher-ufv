Dream love dream universe dream come true  
Dream power dream energy dream eternity  
  
In dream you can fly forever  
And never miss a turn  
In dream you can spread your wings  
And know where to turn  
  
Dream sunrise dream sunset dream together  
Dream you dream me dream each other  
  
In dream the world is clear forever  
And theres no return  
In dream you can love forever  
And theres no return  
  
Dream power  
Dream reality  
Dream together theres no return  
  
In dream you can fly forever  
And never miss a turn  
In dream you can spread your wings  
And know where to turn  
  
Dream dream dream
