Well I took my baby to the carnival  
And I heard that barker yell  
Come on and win yourself a pretty kewpie doll  
All you gotta do is ring the bell  
  
Well I swung the hammer just as hard as I could  
And you shouldve heard the wild applause  
When bong went the bell and the man said well  
I guess the kewpie doll is yours  
  
I said give me a doggie or a teddy bear  
Or a high school banner for my wall  
Cause I got me a real live kewpie doll  
And shes the cutest one of them all  
  
Then we walked down the midway till we saw a crowd  
And the man said try your skill  
Five shots for a quarter make a duck hit the water  
And give your little baby a thrill  
  
Well my baby smiled and she kissed me once  
And I felt I was nine feet tall  
Oh five shots crashed and five ducks splashed  
And the man gave me a kewpie doll  
  
Then my baby said honey let me try my luck  
And knock the milk bottles off the shelf  
You shouldve seen this chick she was a dead eye dick  
Hey I couldnt do better myself  
  
And then my face got red and my chest swelled up  
And my eyes bugged outta my head  
Cause when the prize turned out to be a kewpie doll  
This is what my baby said  
  
She said give me a doggie or a teddy bear  
Or a high school banner for my wall  
Cause I got me a real live kewpie doll  
And hes the cutest one of them all
