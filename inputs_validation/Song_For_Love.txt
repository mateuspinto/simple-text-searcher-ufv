I lie awake with open eyes  
My love just died  
Im cold inside  
Cant face the thought to be alone  
All by myself on my own  
Loves come and gone  
  
I look around and see  
The hearts that still are broken  
I cant believe all of our hearts remain unopened  
We cant go go on and on  
Wit that same old song  
So wipe off the frown  
And turn around and face each other  
Come on come on  
Lets sing a song  
  
A song for you a song for me a song for love  
  
All for one and one for all together  
Singing a song for love  
You and I are none without the other  
Singing a song for love  
  
You let the time pass by  
Big boys dont cry  
Believe that lie  
A broken heart that never mends  
Is this the end  
Listen my friend  
  
These walls of hate  
That separate on from the other  
Time to rebuild bridges of love  
One to another  
Come on come on  
Lets sing a song  
  
A song for you a song for me a song for love  
  
All for one and one for all together  
Singing a song for love  
You and I are none without the other  
Singing a song for love
