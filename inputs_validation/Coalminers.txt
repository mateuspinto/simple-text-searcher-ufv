Come all you coalminers  
Wherever you may be  
And listen to the story  
That I relate to thee  
My name is nothing extra  
But the truth to you I tell  
I am a coalminer  
And Im sure I wish you well  
  
I was born in old Kentucky  
In a coal camp born and bred  
I know about old beans  
Bulldog gravy and cornbread  
I know how the miners work and slave  
In the coalmines every day  
For a dollar in the company store  
For that is all they pay  
  
Mining is the most dangerous work  
In our land today  
Plenty of dirty slaving work  
For very little pay  
Coalminers wont you wake up  
And open your eyes and see  
What this dirty capitalist system  
Has done to you and me  
  
Dear miners they will slave you  
Until you cant work no more  
And what will you get for your labor but a dollar in the company store  
A tumbledown shack to live in  
Snow and rain pouring through the top and you have to pay the company rent and
your payments will never stop  
  
They take our very lifeblood  
They take our childrens lives  
Take fathers away from children  
Take husbands away from wives coalminers wont you organize  
Wherever you may be  
And make this a land of freedom  
For workers like you and me  
  
I am a coalminer  
And Im sure I wish you well  
Lets sink this capitalist system  
To the darkest pits of hell
