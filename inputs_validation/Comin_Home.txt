Its been so long since Ive been gone  
Another day might be too long for me  
Traveling around Ive had my fill  
Of broken dreams and dirty deals  
A concrete jungle surrounding me  
Many nights Ive slept out in the streets  
I paid my dues and I changed my style  
Seen hard times all over now  
  
I want to come home Its been so long since Ive been away  
And please dont blame me cause Ive tried  
Ill be coming home soon to your love to stay  
  
I miss old friends that I once had  
Times aint changed and Ill be glad when I go home  
I dont know why the thought came to me  
But why Im here I really cant see and now  
  
I want to come home Its been so long since Ive been away  
And please dont blame me cause Ive tried  
Ill be coming home soon to your love to stay  
Coming home to stay  
Coming home to your love mama  
Ive seen better days  
  
I miss old friends that I once had

And please dont blame me cause Ive tried  
Ill be coming home soon to your love to stay  
Coming home to stay  
Coming home to your love mama  
Ive seen better days
