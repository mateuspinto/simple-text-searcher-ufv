Todays the day our younger son  
Is goin off to war  
Fightin in the age old battle  
Weve sometimes won before  
Flags that line old Main Street  
Are blowin in the wind  
These must be the flags of freedom flyin  
  
Church bells are ringin  
As the families stand and wave  
Some of them are cryin  
But the soldiers look so brave  
Lookin straight ahead  
Like they know just where theyre goin  
Past the flags of freedom flyin  
  
Sister has her headphones on  
She hears the music blasting  
She sees here brother marchin by  
Their bond is everlasting  
Listening to Bob Dylan singin  
In 1963  
Watchin the flags of freedom flyin  
  
She sees the president speakin  
On a flatscreen TV  
In the window of the old appliance store  
She turns to see her brother again  
But hes already walkin past  
The flags of freedom flyin  
  
Have you seen the flags of freedom  
What color are they now  
Do you think that you believe in yours  
More than they do theirs somehow  
When you see the flags of freedom flyin  
  
Todays the day our younger son  
Is goin off to war  
Fighting in the age old battle  
Weve sometimes won before  
Flags that line old Main Street  
Are blowin in the wind  
These must be the flags of freedom flyin
