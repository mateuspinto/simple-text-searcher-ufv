I tried so hard to be her day  
But the night has already taken me away  
Shedding dreams under the maple tree  
Where I carved your name  
Nothing left not even time  
Straight reads the line  
His life had reached the end  
Wanting only to be loved by adrienne  
Letters explained his grief  
But she would never read  
His wrists would bleed  
But she would never see  
So he took his life at the age of 23  
And she had always loved him  
Be he would never know  
For she covered her love  
Like stars cover the sky  
Hiding her heart  
Fearing what he would find inside  
Years took her away  
A widow she remained  
Holding him deep inside  
Wishing she too would die  
Time favors no one and if we wait  
We too can fall in love  
A second too late
