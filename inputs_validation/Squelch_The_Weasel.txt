Squelch the little weasel crush him before he spawns  
Break it to me gently but with merriment and song  
Squelch the little weasel juice him as he bleeds  
Feed him to the many for thoust their souls shall weep  
  
Sipping of the sunray blading in the earth  
Evolving was the nectar given to the weasel birth  
I was just a puppet until the clouds caved in  
Bless me now you are sacred my flesh betwixt my skin  
  
Sipping of the sunray blading in the earth  
Evolving was the nectar given to the weasel birth
