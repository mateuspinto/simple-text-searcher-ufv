Hey Negrita hey now  
Move your body move your mouth  
Shake lady way down south  
Shake baby in your home town  
  
Come si chiama whats you game  
Im just a poor man whats your name  
Shake your body do it up now  
Shake body move it up now  
  
Hey Negrita hey now  
Hey conchita shake it up now  
Bate las caderas do it up now  
  
Flash of gold in your ears child  
Flash of gold in your eyes  
Saw the gleam in your mouth  
Saw the steel in your thighs  
Do it up now  
  
Bate las caderas do it up now  
Just a momentita not so fast  
I need money my sweet ass  
Listen Im a poor man  
My pay is low  
Heres one last dollar then we go  
One last dollar she say I got my pride  
Going to get your boss boy  
Going to tan your hide  
  
Hey Negrita hey now
