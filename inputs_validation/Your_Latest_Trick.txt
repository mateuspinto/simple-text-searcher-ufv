All the late night bargains have been struck  
Between the satin beans and their bells  
Prehistoric garbage trucks  
Got the city to themselves  
Echoes and the roars dinosaurs  
Theyre all doing the monster mash  
And most of the taxis and the whores  
Are only taking calls for cash  
  
I dont know how it happened  
It all took place so quick  
But all I can do is hand it to you  
And your latest trick  
  
My door was standing open  
Security was laid back and lax  
But it was only my heart got broken  
You must have had a pass key made out of wax  
You played robbery with insolence  
And I played the blues in twelve bars on Lovers Lane  
And you never did have the intelligence to use  
The twelve keys hanging off my chain  
  
I dont know how it happened  
It all took place so quick  
But all I can do is hand it to you  
And your latest trick  
  
Now its past last call far alcohol  
Past recall has been here and gone  
The landlord finally paid us all  
The satin jazzmen have put away their horns  
And were standing outside of these wonderlands  
Looking so bereaved and so bereft  
Like a bowery bum when he finally understands  
The bottles empty and theres nothing left  
  
I dont know how it happened  
It all took place so quick  
But all I can do is hand it to you  
And your latest trick
