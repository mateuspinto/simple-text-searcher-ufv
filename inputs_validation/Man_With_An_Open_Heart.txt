She wouldnt need to be a bird without a wing  
Or be a servant to a telephone ring  
She could be sleeping in the comfort of another bed  
It wouldnt matter to a man with an open heart  
Here comes right now  
  
She could be moody dramatic as a play  
Or be evasive as a shadow in the shade  
Could be irregular and singing in her underwear  
It wouldnt matter to a man with an open heart  
Here comes right now  
  
Her wild and wise womanly  
Introspectiveness  
Her faults and files of foolishness  
  
Wouldnt matter to a man with an open heart  
Here comes right now
