Well I rocked over italy and I rocked over spain  
I rocked in memphis it was all the same  
Till I rocked to africa and rolled off ship  
And seen them natives doing a odd looking skip  
I parted the weeds and looked over the swamp  
I seen them cats doing the ubangi stomp  
Ubangi stomp with rock and roll  
Beats anything thats ever been told  
Ubangi stomp ubangi style  
When the beat just drives a cool cat wild  
Well I looked up the chief and he invited me in  
Said a heap big jam session bout to begin  
He handed me a tomtom I picked up the beat  
That crazy thing sent shivers to my feet  
Rocked and rolled and I skipped with a smile  
Ubangi stomp ubangi style  
Ubangi stomp with rock and roll  
Beats anything thats ever been told  
Ubangi stomp ubangi style  
When the beat just drives a cool cat wild  
Well we rocked all night and part of the day  
Had a good rocking time with the chiefs daughter mae  
I was making time and gettin in the know  
The captain said son we gotta go  
I said thats alright you go on ahead  
Im gonna ubangi stomp until I roll over dead  
Ubangi stomp with rock and roll  
Beats anything that you ever told  
Ubangi stomp ubangi style  
When the beat just drives a cool cat wild  
When the beat just drives a cool cat wild  
When the beat just drives a cool cat wild  
When the beat just drives a cool cat wild
