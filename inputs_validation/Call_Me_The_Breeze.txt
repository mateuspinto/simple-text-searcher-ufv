Call me the breeze  
I keep blowin down the road  
Well now they call me the breeze  
I keep blowin down the road  
I aint got me nobody  
I dont carry me no load  
Aint no change in the weather  
Aint no changes in me  
Well there aint no change in the weather  
Aint no changes in me  
And I aint hidin from nobody  
Nobodys hidin from me  
Oh thats the way its supposed to be  
Well I got that green light baby  
I got to keep movin on  
Well I got that green light baby  
I got to keep movin on  
Well I might go out to California  
Might go down to Georgia I dont know  
Well I dig you Georgia peaches  
Makes me feel right at home  
Well now I dig you Georgia peaches  
Makes me feel right at home  
But I dont love me no one woman  
So I cant stay in Georgia long  
Well now they call me the breeze  
I keep blowin down the road  
Well now they call me the breeze  
I keep blowin down the road  
I aint got me nobody  
I dont carry me no load  
Ooh Mr Breeze
