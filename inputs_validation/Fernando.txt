Can you hear the drums Fernando  
I remember long ago another starry night like this  
In the firelight Fernando  
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar  
I could hear the distant drums  
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar  
  
They were closer now Fernando  
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally  
I was so afraid Fernando  
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die  
And Im not ashamed to say  
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry  
  
There was something in the air that night  
The stars were bright Fernando  
They were shining there for you and me  
For liberty Fernando  
Though I never thought that we could lose  
Theres no regret  
If I had to do the same again  
I would my friend Fernando  
If I had to do the same again  
I would my friend Fernando  
  
Now were old and grey Fernando  
And since many years I havent seen a rifle in your hand  
Can you hear the drums Fernando  
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande  
I can see it in your eyes  
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land  
  
Repeat x2  
There was something in the air that night  
The stars were bright Fernando  
They were shining there for you and me  
For liberty Fernando  
Though I never thought that we could lose  
Theres no regret  
If I had to do the same again  
I would my friend Fernando  
  
Yes if I had to do the same again  
I would my friend Fernando
