Theres gotta be something more to this life were given  
Gotta be peace o mind and a piece o living  
When the losers have won and the damage is done  
Only then will you be saved  
She dancing on thin ice while her mind is skating  
Hes building on the dust that is suffocating  
And a baby that cries in a city of lies  
For a freedom that is craved  
High will you fly tonight  
In dreams you can hold this tight  
But when will love blow round  
When will love blow all through Windy Town  
Sunny had a street that she couldnt live in  
Sunny had a room that she couldnt breath in  
But a heart that could feel and a hand that could heal  
And a passion filled with rage  
I never felt the air with a wind of change  
I only felt a storm with a wind and rain  
A city so deep a soul without sleep  
And a heart thats filled with pain  
High will you fly tonight  
In dreams you can hold this tight  
But when will love blow round  
When will love blow all through Windy Town  
Look out on a million dreams  
Theres fire in all those schemes  
I feel the burn of investigation  
Love will be your inspiration  
Baby lets go again  
On me and you it all depends  
The power of love is a powerful friend  
And I will love you till the end  
High will you fly tonight  
In dreams you can hold this tight  
But when will love blow round  
When will love blow around  
When will love blow all through Windy Town  
Baby through Windy Town
