Waiting for the break of day  
Searching for something to say  
Dancing lights against the sky  
Giving up I close my eyes  
Sitting crosslegged on the floor  
Twenty five or six to four  
  
Staring blindly into space  
Getting up to splash my face  
Wanting just to stay awake  
Wondering how much I can take  
Should have tried to do some more  
Twenty five or six to four  
  
Feeling like I ought to sleep  
Spinning room is sinking deep  
Searching for something to say  
Waiting for the break of day  
Twenty five or six to four  
Twenty five or six to four
