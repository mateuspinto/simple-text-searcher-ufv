I can hear the wind blowing in my mind  
Just the way it used to do through the Georgia pines  
And you were there to answer when I called  
You and me Lord knows we had it all  
  
Remember how I used to touch your hair baby  
Looking for the feeling it was always there  
Youre the best thing in my life I can recall  
Yeah baby you and me we had it all  
  
I know that we can never live those times again  
And I get old feelings that Ill be there back again  
And Ill stay with you girl just as long as I can  
Cause it was so good oh it was so good you know  
Yes it was so good when I was your man  
  
And Ill never stop believing in your smile  
Even though you didnt stay it was all worth while  
And I know that beneath of it all baby  
Just you and me we had it all  
  
You and me we had it all  
You and me we had it all
