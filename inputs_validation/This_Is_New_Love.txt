We are strangers here  
I suppose  
We are not welcome  
Or so Im told  
We are not old friends  
But believe this  
We can be nightmares  
  
Picture the man when the heartbeat stops  
This is new love  
  
We are the hunters  
So one by one  
You know well find you  
  
Picture the man when the heartbeat stops  
  
These boys of passion  
Will rule the world  
Put their fingers in a dyke  
Well you know its what she needed  
These boys of passion  
With cruel idiot smiles  
Fight for you  
You know they said so  
  
Cold fascination  
With dead sound  
Oh God let me sleep  
Forever  
  
Picture the man when the heartbeat stops
