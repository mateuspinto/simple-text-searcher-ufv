When I was younger  
I used to go and tip cows for fun yeah  
Actually I didnt do that  
Cause I didnt want the cow to be sad  
But some of my friends did  
They were all just a little bit wicked  
Theyd blow up mail boxes  
With a baseball bat  
Go for direct hits  
  
I know how to win you can forget it  
They throw rotten eggs into traffic  
Toilet paper the fences  
Throw the tables chairs and the benches  
After practice  
Sometimes we would break into mad fits  
Causin damage  
Burnin amplifiers and mic stands  
  
Chorus  
Everybody get dangerous  
Everybody get dangerous Boo yah  
Everybody get dangerous  
Everybody get dangerous Boo yah  
Everybody get dangerous  
Everybody get dangerous Boo yah  
Everybody get dangerous  
Everybody get dangerous  
  
Ive got a confession  
That I will make if you will listen  
Late in the nighttimes  
Wed drive around with hairspray and sharp knives  
Lookin for road kills  
Lightin things on fire for cheap thrills  
Stab the corpses  
And lick the knives like were evil forces  
  
Hockey games on frozen ponds  
No safety pads were ever put on  
Drivin home on country roads  
Sixtyfive in a twentyfive zone  
In my parents Tercel  
How did we survive so well  
Throw the keys and the wheel locked up  
I almost killed every one us  
  
Chorus  
  
There must be  
A guardian angel  
Or some kind of destiny we have  
Cause we should have died  
A long time ago  
The way that we were livin in our paths  
  
What will we say when our kids come to us  
And ask with a smile on their face  
Hey Dad my friends got some new ninja swords  
Is it cool if we slash up his place  
Hey  
Hey  
Hey Is it cool if we slash up his place  
And get dangerous  
  
Chorus
