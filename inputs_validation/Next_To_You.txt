I cant stand it for another day  
When you live so many miles away  
Nothing here is gonna make me stay  
You took me over let me find a way  
  
I sold my house  
I sold my motor too  
All I want is to be next to you  
Id rob a bank  
  
Maybe steal a plane  
You took me over  
Think Im goin insane  
What can I do  
  
All I want is to be next to you  
What can I do  
All I want is to be next to you  
Ive had a thousand girls or maybe more  
  
But Ive never felt like this before  
But I just dont know whats come over me  
You took me over take a look at me  
What can I do  
  
All I want is to be next to you  
What can I do  
All I want is to be next to you  
All I want is to be next to you  
  
All I want is to be next to you  
All I want is to be next to you  
I saw my doctor he said give it time  
I got this feeling gonna lose my mind  
  
When all it is is just a love affair  
You took me over baby take me there  
What can I do  
All I want is to be next to you  
  
What can I do  
All I want is to be next to you  
What can I do  
All I want is to be next to you  
  
What can I do  
All I want is to be next to you  
All I want is to be next to you  
All I want is to be next to you  
  
All I want is to be next to you  
All I want is to be next to you
