I lost my grip  
Began to fall  
On the way down  
Made one last call  
You wanted me and him besides  
I laughed so much  
I nearly died  
  
Even the bad times were good times  
Even the bad times were alright  
Maybe you wanted the good times  
Maybe the bad times were all you could find  
  
I went to sleep  
To grind my teeth  
No mirror ball  
Faulty T V  
I felt my coat  
Around my throat  
I couldnt sing  
Another note  
  
Sometimes its tough  
Sometimes its rough  
No matter what you got  
You cant get enough  
  
Even the bad times were good times  
Even the bad times were alright  
Maybe you wanted the good times  
Maybe the bad times were all you could find  
  
I worshipped you  
You know its true  
I worshipped you  
What else could I do  
  
Even the bad times were good times  
Even the bad times were alright
