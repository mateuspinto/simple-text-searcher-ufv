A victim of collision on the open sea  
Nobody ever said that life was free  
Sank swam go down with the ship  
But use your freedom of choice  
  
Ill say it again in the land of the free  
Use your freedom of choice  
Your freedom of choice  
  
In ancient Rome  
There was a poem  
About a dog  
Who found two bones  
He picked at one  
He licked the other  
He went in circles  
He dropped dead  
  
Freedom of choice  
Is what you got  
Freedom of choice  
  
Then if you got it you dont want it  
Seems to be the rule of thumb  
Dont be tricked by what you see  
You got two ways to go  
  
Ill say it again in the land of the free  
Use your freedom of choice  
Freedom of choice  
  
Freedom of choice  
Is what you got  
Freedom of choice  
  
In ancient Rome  
There was a poem  
About a dog  
Who found two bones  
He picked at one  
He licked the other  
He went in circles  
He dropped dead  
  
Repeats  
Freedom of choice  
Is what you got  
Freedom from choice  
Is what you want
