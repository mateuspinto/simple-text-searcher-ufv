And I know  
It will be  
An easy ride all right  
And I know  
It will be  
Easy ride okay  
The mask that you wore  
My fingers would explore  
Costume of control  
Excitement soon unfolds  
And I know  
It will be  
Easy ride yeah  
Joy for vaguely  
Which your pride  
Which your pride yeah  
Black polished stone  
Black polished stone  
I see your eyes  
Like burnin glass  
Like burnin glass  
Hear you smile smile babe  
The mask that you wore  
My fingers would explore  
Costume of control  
Excitement soon unfolds hey  
Easy baby  
Call the queen now  
Be my bride  
Ragin darkness  
By my side  
Seize the summer  
In your pride  
Take the winter  
In your stride  
Lets ride yeah  
Easy easy easy  
Easy easy ease easy  
Yeah yeah ride  
dumb dumb dumb dumb  
dumb dumb dumb  
Ride
