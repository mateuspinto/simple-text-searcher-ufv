One and two and three and four and  
One and two and three and four and  
One and two and three and four and  
One and two and three and four  
  
I was writing  
Thinking with my long hand  
Flippin the paper  
Everything was sinking  
In start to wonder  
How you gonna handle me  
When Im under  
Swimming in the dark sea  
  
Everybody wants you to make  
Its all yours  
Everybody wants to take  
Its all yours  
Everybody wants you to make  
Its all yours  
Everybody wants to take it ttttake it  
  
Can you feel all the love  
Can you feel all the love  
Can you feel all the love  
Can you feel all the love  
Like it was made for you  
Like it was made for you  
Like it was made for you  
It was made for you  
  
Tell me something  
Something that can move me  
Dont tell me lies  
I swear your gonna lose me  
Big like an ocean  
Jealous of the fish it feeds  
Your devotion  
Swimming inside of me  
  
Everybody wants you to make  
Its all yours  
Everybody wants to take  
Its all yours  
Everybody wants you to make  
Its all yours  
Everybody wants to ttttake it  
Can you feel all the love  
Can you feel all the love  
Can you feel all the love  
Can you feel all the love  
  
Like it was made for you  
Like it was made for you  
Like it was made for you  
It was made for you  
  
Can you feel  
Can you feel  
Can you feel  
  
All the right friends in all the right places  
All the right moves and all the right faces  
All the right friends in all the right places  
All the right moves and all the right faces  
Can you feel all the love  
All the right friends in all the right places  
Can you feel all the love  
All the right moves and all the right faces  
Can you feel all the love  
All the right friends in all the right places  
Can you feel all the love  
All the right moves and all the right faces
