Am I ready can my heart be true  
Am I ready to fall in love with you  
  
One love one girlone dream shared by two  
Am I ready to fall in love with you  
  
I have touched your lips and now I know  
I would be a fool to let you go  
  
Should I could I how I wish I knew  
Am I ready to fall in love with you  
  
Should I could I how I wish I knew  
Am I ready to fall in love with you  
  
Fall in love  with  you
