So many nights I sit by my window  
Waiting for someone to sing me his song  
So many dreams I kept deep inside me  
Alone in the dark but now  
Youve come along  
  
And you light up my life  
You give me hope  
To carry on  
You light up my days  
And fill my nights with song  
  
Rollin at sea adrift on the water  
Could it be finally Im turning for home  
Finally a chance to say hey  
I love you  
Never again to be all alone  
  
Cause you  
You light up my life  
You give me hope  
To carry on  
You light up my days  
And fill my nights with song  
  
And you  
You light up my life  
You give me hope  
To carry on  
You light up my days  
And fill my nights with song  
With song  
You give me hope  
To carry on  
You light up my days  
And fill my nights with song  
  
It cant be wrong  
When it feels so right  
Cause you  
You light up my life my life my life my life oooh
