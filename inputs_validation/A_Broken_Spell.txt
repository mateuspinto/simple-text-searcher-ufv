I stumbled out of Grandmas room  
Down the stairs and out of the house  
Once outside I felt My mind begin to  
Fight a battle for control  
  
With the tea pot broken I kind of  
Realized  
That THEIR power was less here  
Here on the outside  
  
I fell to my knees in haziness  
And I looked in through the window  
To the cellar  
  
Things were moving down there  
THEY were searching for something  
And THEY really found it  
The big axe was flying  
  
Flying out through the cellar door  
Up the stairs to the kitchen  
Then I passed out  
  
The next thing I remember seeing was  
The smoke coming from the chimney  
I soon realized the smoke I saw was  
Actually Oh No  
All there was left of Missy and her  
Dress poor little girl  
  
The spell was broken I really felt the  
Change  
As my mind and body became one  
Again  
  
The moon was alive with its silvery  
Eye  
Staring right into My evil heart  
  
I went back to see if My Grandma  
Was still there  
Waiting for me in the attic  
Oh I hate that bitch
