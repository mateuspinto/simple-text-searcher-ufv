I climbed the Redwood Hill  
Twas on a rainy day  
To rise above the throng  
And talk with Mother Nature for a while  
She told me of her love  
For the children in her trust  
And of her grave concern  
For the likes of you and me and us  
Crying though she was  
She did speak these tender words  
The things that I am  
I could not change for any man  
I tried to comfort her  
Ah but she would not be still  
And how the rain did fall  
As I found my way back down the Redwood Hill  
Crying though she was  
She did speak these tender words  
The things that I am  
I would not change for any man  
I tried to comfort her  
Ah but she would not be still  
Ill not forget that day  
When Mother Nature cried on Redwood Hill  
Ill not forget that day  
When Mother Nature cried on Redwood Hill
