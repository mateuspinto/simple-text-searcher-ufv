It s really not important  
 cause your mind is somewhere else  
And you re busy with your numbers  
Drowning in yourself  
  
And it really doesn t matter  
 cause your eyes are on the clock  
And now your feet are tapping to the rhythm  
But very soon they ll walk  
  
You think it s done  
But it didn t even start  
Passing by your ear  
And missing your heart  
  
And it s really not important  
You have troubles of your own  
And your mind is on the weekend  
And all the things to do back home  
  
So when she tells you of her sorrow  
When her soul becomes unsealed  
She may be foolish but she s hoping  
For a small crack in your shield  
  
You think she s done  
But she didn t even start  
Passing by your ear  
And missing your heart  
  
It s really not important  
 cause your mind is somewhere else  
And you re busy with your numbers  
Drowning in yourself  
  
And me I only want to hold you  
And to tell you it s ok  
Though it really makes me sad  
Every time you turn away  
  
You think we re done  
But we didn t even start  
Passing by your ear  
And missing your heart
