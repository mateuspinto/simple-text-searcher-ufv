Now I been gone for sometime baby  
But I been thinkin of you the whole time through  
The thought of your love got me excited  
And now that all the waitin is done  
Its time to have some fun my baby  
  
Chorus  
Baby I love you so  
I wanna love you head to toe  
I cant wait no I cant wait no longer  
Come on baby lets do this  
You were my lover and my friend  
I wanna love you til the end  
To the very end girl  
I cant wait no I cant wait no longer  
So come on baby lets do this yeah  
  
Now you know Im  Im not complicated  
I only need you my sweet baby and your love to drive me crazy  
Now that Im back you better get ready  
Cause I saved it all for you  
Im gonna love you through and through my baby  
  
Chorus  
  
I waited so long to get to this  
Come on baby lets do this yeah  
  
Ha ha wait a minute Mr Vandross  
You say you been gone so long you need a dose  
But oh no that coming and going its got to go  
Check my flow  
  
You say you want this  
Well baby this you besta know  
Spinderella aint aint new to this

So work it out lace this if you can  
And stay around  you the man  
And I need you to be down  
  
Chorus
