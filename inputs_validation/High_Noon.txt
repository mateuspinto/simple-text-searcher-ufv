Do not forsake me oh my darlin  
On this our weddin day  
Do not forsake me oh my darlin  
Wait wait along  
  
I do not know what fate awaits me  
I only know I must be brave  
And I must face a man who hates me  
Or lie a coward a craven coward  
Or lie a coward in my grave  
  
Oh to be torn tweenst love and duty  
Supposin I lose my fairhaired beauty  
Look at that big hand move along  
Nearin high noon  
  
He made a vow while in state prison  
Vowed it would be my life or his and  
Im not afraid of death but oh  
What will I do if you leave me  
  
Do not forsake me oh my darlin  
You made that promise as a bride  
Do not forsake me oh my darlin  
Although youre grievin dont think of leavin  
Now that I need you by my side  
  
Wait along wait along wait along  
Wait along wait along  
Wait along wait along wait along wait along
