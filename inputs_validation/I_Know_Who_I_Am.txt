Chorus  
I know who I am  
I know who I am  
I know who I am  
I am yours  
I am yours 2x  
  
And you are mine  
Jesus you are mine  
You are mine  
Jesus you are mine  
  
I was running and you found me  
I was blind and you gave me sight  
You put a song of praise in me  
I was broken and you healed me  
I was dying and you gave me life  
Lord You are my identity  
  
I know I know  
Chorus  
  
I am forgiven I am your friend  
I am accepted I know who I am  
I am secure Im confident  
That I am loved I know who I am  
I am alive I am set free  
I belong to you and you belong to me  
  
Chorus
