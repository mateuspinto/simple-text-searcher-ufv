My little crazy cat  
Took a train to meet his gang downtown yeah  
They played Black Jack  
Fritz played his false game too far ooh  
A guy got up and started a gunfight  
  
Hes looking for trouble day by day  
For trouble day by day  
Dont waste time cute runaway  
You cute runaway  
He kept being taken by surprise  
My stray cat in town  
  
Addicted to chicks  
Hes got a rental tree near the nudist beach yeah  
Oh watch out  
Booze and ladies are his fate ooh  
Too much sex and food and Rock n Roll  
  
Hes looking for trouble day by day
