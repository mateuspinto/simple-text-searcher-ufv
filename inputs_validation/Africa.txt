I hear the drums echoing tonight  
But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation  
Shes coming in twelvethirty flight  
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation  
I stopped an old man along the way  
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies  
He turned to me as if to say Hurry boy its waiting there for you  
  
Its gonna take a lot to drag me away from you  
Theres nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do  
I bless the rains down in Africa  
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had  
  
The wild dogs cry out in the night  
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company  
I know that I must do whats right  
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti  
I seek to cure whats deep inside frightened of this thing that Ive become  
  
Its gonna take a lot to drag me away from you  
Theres nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do  
I bless the rains down in Africa  
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had  
  
Hurry boy shes waiting there for you  
  
Its gonna take a lot to drag me away from you  
Theres nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do  
I bless the rains down in Africa  
I bless the rains down in Africa  
I bless the rain  
I bless the rains down in Africa  
I bless the rain  
I bless the rains down in Africa  
I bless the rains down in Africa  
Ah gonna take the time  
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had
