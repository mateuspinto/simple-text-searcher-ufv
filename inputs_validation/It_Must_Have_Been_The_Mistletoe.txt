It must have been the mistletoe  
The lazy fire the falling snow  
The magic in the frosty air  
That feeling everywhere  
  
It must have been the pretty lights  
That glistened in the silent night  
It may be just the stars so bright  
That shined above you  
  
Our first Christmas  
More than wed be dreaming of  
Ah Saint Nicholas had his fingers crossed  
That we would fall in love  
  
It could have been the holiday  
The midnight ride upon sleigh  
The countryside all dressed in white  
The crazy snowball fight  
  
It could have been the steeplebell  
That wrapped us up in its spell  
It only took one kiss to know  
It must have been the mistletoe  
  
Our first Christmas more than wed be dreaming of  
Ah St Nicholas must have know that kiss  
Would lead to all of this  
It must have been the mistletoe  
  
The lazy fire the falling snow  
The magic in the frosty air  
That made me love you  
On Christmas eve our wish came true  
That I would fall in love with you  
It only took one kiss to know  
  
It must have been the mistletoe  
It must have been the mistletoe  
It must have been the mistletoe
