Resting so alone  
Way back home  
Waiting for a long  
Way to go  
  
Nothing if I take you back  
Id rather never take you back for you  
  
Waiting so fast  
For a way to go  
Wrestling with the past  
Long way to go  
  
Nothing if I take you back  
Id rather never take you back for you  
  
I got more than I can have cant really say  
I get more than I can use day to day  
I get more time to take you back  
Id rather never take you back for you  
  
Waiting so alone  
Long time ago  
Waiting so hard  
On the radio  
  
Wasting if I take you back  
Id rather never take you back for you  
  
I got more than I can have cant really say  
I get more than I can use day to day  
I get more time to take you back  
Id rather never take you back for you
