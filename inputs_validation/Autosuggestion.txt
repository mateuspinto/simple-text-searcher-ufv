Everything is by design  
Everything is by design  
  
Here here  
Everything is kept inside  
So take a chance and step outside  
Your hopes your dreams your paradise  
Heroes idols cracked like ice  
  
Here here  
Everything is kept inside  
So take a chance and step outside  
Pure frustration face to face  
A point of view creates more waves  
So take a chance and step outside  
  
Take a chance and step outside  
Lose some sleep and say you tried  
Meet frustration face to face  
A point of view creates more waves  
  
So lose some sleep and say you tried  
So lose some sleep and say you tried  
So lose some sleep and say you tried  
So lose some sleep and say you tried  
Say you tried  
Say you tried  
Say you tried  
Say you tried  
Say you tried  
Say you tried  
Say you tried  
Say you tried  
Say you tried  
Say you tried  
Say you tried  
Yeah lose some sleep and say you tried  
Yeah lose some sleep and say you tried  
Yeah lose some sleep and say you tried  
Yeah lose some sleep and say you tried
