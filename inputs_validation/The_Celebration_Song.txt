Ease Up a Little bit  
Cause I want to want you  
If all of the moneys spent  
Well thats fine to got you  
  
By my side lets go for a long ride  
In my car Ill drive you to my star  
Out in space wont matter where we are  
  
A celebration about time  
A generation out of line yea  
The revolutions in everyone  
Blame the gun  
  
Ease up a little bit  
Cause I have to have you  
Drink up a little bit  
If your mine Ill find you
