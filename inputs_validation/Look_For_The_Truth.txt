All my dark dreams  
Drift like smoke in the breeze  
The fear grips me as I fall towards my sleep  
Here comes the nightmare that never ends  
Here is the dream that makes monsters of men  
  
In the house of my soul  
In rooms of ugliness and cold  
Memories locked away  
All the doubts and fears I never faced  
  
Now they come again  
I am falling down to meet with them  
fear within us all  
Mine awake and they stand up tall  
  
Look for the truth  
Deepest cut of all from you  
Knife of the truth  
Blade of hatred slicing through  
  
I pray my sleep will break  
Maybe this time I wont wake  
Weakness I hide so well  
This dagger in my mind will tell  
  
Its my final stand  
I make a fist out of each hand  
To the shadows of the past  
Take a breath and I scream attack
