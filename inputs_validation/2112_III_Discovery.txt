Iii Discovery  
Words by Neil Peart Music by Alex Lifeson  
  
 Behind my beloved waterfall in the little room that was  
Hidden beneath the cave I found it I brushed away the  
Dust of the years and picked it up holding it reverently in  
My hands I had no idea what it might be but it was  
Beautiful  
 I learned to lay my fingers across the wires and to turn  
The keys to make them sound differently As I struck the  
Wires with my other hand I produced my first harmonious  
Sounds and soon my own music How different it could  
Be from the music of the Temples I cant wait to tell the  
Priests about it    
  
What can this strange device be  
When I touch it it gives forth a sound  
Its got wires that vibrate and give music  
What can this thing be that I found  
  
See how it sings like a sad heart  
And joyously screams out its pain  
Sounds that build high like a mountain  
Or notes that fall gently like rain  
  
I cant wait to share this new wonder  
The people will all see its light  
Let them all make their own music  
The Priests praise my name on this night
