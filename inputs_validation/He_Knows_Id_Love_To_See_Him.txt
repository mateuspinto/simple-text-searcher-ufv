He knows he knows  
Or I think he does  
Cause when I lived  
In the arse of the world  
  
He knows he knows  
He knows Id love  
To see him happy  
Or as close as is allowed  
Oh cause when I lived  
In the arse of the world  
  
He knows he knows  
He knows Id love  
To see him happy  
Or as close as possible  
As close as possible  
As close as possible  
As close as is allowed  
  
Oh my name still conjures up deadly deeds  
And a bad taste in the mouth  
And the police  they actually know me  
They said   
  
Youre just another person in the world  
Youre just another fool with radical views  
Youre just another who has maddening views  
You want to turn it on its head  
By staying in bed   
  
I said  I know I do  
  
He doesnt know
