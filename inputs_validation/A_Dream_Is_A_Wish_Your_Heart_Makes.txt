A dream is a wish your heart makes  
When youre fast asleep  
In dreams you will lose your heartaches  
Whatever you wish for you keep  
Have faith in your dreams and some day  
Your rainbow will come smilin through  
No matter how your heart is grievin if you keep on believin  
The dream that you wish will come true  
Have faith in your dreams and someday  
Your rainbow will come smilin through  
No matter how your heart is grievin if you keep on believin  
The dream that you wish will come true
