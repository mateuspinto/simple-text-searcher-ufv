Right where you are standing  
The dinosaurs did a dance  
The indians told a story  
Now it has come to pass  
  
The Indians had a legend  
The Spaniards lived for gold  
The white man came and killed them  
But they havent really gone  
  
Chorus  
We live in the city of dreams  
We drive on the highway of fire  
Should we awake  
And find it gone  
Remember this our favorite town  
  
From Germany and Europe  
And Southern USA  
They made this little town here  
That we live in to this day  
  
The children of the white man  
Saw Indians on TV  
And heard about the legend  
How their city was a dream  
  
Chorus  
  
The Civil War is over  
And World War One and Two  
If we can live together  
The dream it might come true  
  
Underneath the concrete  
The dream is still alive  
A hundred million lifetimes  
A world that never dies  
  
Chorus
