Day by day you work off your claws  
The line of fate in them may not pay your loans  
You got to keep going and going on strive  
Day by day  
  
Do you know Ooh do you know Ooh  
  
Do you know what youre fighting for  
The seed is sown but we dont know the score  
They will rule us this breed of futility  
You wont make an escape  
Cause we will still be alive  
  
Disenchantment alienation  
A slog to feed future estranged generations  
And retired will you get rewarded  
Your brave restraint  
  
Do you know Ooh do you know Ooh  
  
Do you know what youre fighting for  
The seed is sown but we dont know the score  
They will rule us this breed of futility  
You wont make an escape  
Cause we will still be alive  
  
Do you know what youre fighting for  
The seed is sown but we dont know the score  
They will rule us this breed of futility  
You wont make an escape  
Cause we will still be alive  
  
Ooh will they need you  
Will they pay you
