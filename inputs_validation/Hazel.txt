Hazel dirtyblonde hair  
I wouldnt be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere  
You got something I want plenty of  
Ooh a little touch of your love  
  
Hazel stardust in your eye  
Youre goin somewhere and so am I  
Id give you the sky high above  
Ooh for a little touch of your love  
  
Oh no I dont need any reminder  
To know how much I really care  
But its just making me blinder and blinder  
Because Im up on a hill and still youre not there  
  
Hazel you called and I came  
Now dont make me play this waiting game  
Youve got something I want plenty of  
Ooh a little touch of your love
