Slings and arrows slings and arrows  
Slings and arrows slings and arrows  
No chance for a second chance  
When the arrows start to fly  
No way is an easy way  
To say goodbye  
No dream is ever lost  
If you never cease to try  
Never thought you would walk away  
From my side  
I just cant hide from  
Slings and arrows slings and arrows  
Slings and arrows slings and arrows  
  
Life is ever changing  
Nothing stays the same  
Nothing in this whole wide world  
Can turn us back again  
cause where were standing now  
Is the point of no return  
Looking back on a world thats got to learn  
You just cant hide from  
Slings and arrows slings and arrows  
Slings and arrows slings and arrows  
  
  
Love is the shield  
When youre standing  
With your back to the wall  
And if you turn around  
And walk away  
Youre never gonna lose  
cause love conquers all  
  
No chance for a second chance  
When the arrows start to fly  
No way is an easy way  
To say goodbye  
No dream is ever lost  
If you never cease to try  
Never thought you would walk away  
From my side  
I just cant hide from  
Slings and arrows slings and arrows
