Sun comes every morning but it aint no friend  
I get dressed and I go back again  
The rain keeps on falling on twisted bones and dirt  
Im buried to my heart here in this hurt  
Fire keeps on burning youre waiting in the cold  
Down in the hole  
  
Dark and bloody autumn pierces my heart  
The memory of your kiss tears me apart  
The sky above is turning the world belows gone gray  
I thought that I could turn and walk away  
Fire keeps on burning and Im working in the cold  
Down in the hole  
  
Radios crackling with the headlines wind in the phone lines  
The sun upon your shoulder empty city skylines  
The day rips apart a dark and bloody arrow pierced my heart  
  
I got nothing but heart and sky and sunshine the things you left behind  
I wake to find my citys gone to black  
The days just keep on falling your voice it keeps on calling  
Im gonna dig right here until I get you back  
Fires keep on burning Im here with you in the cold  
Down in the hole  
  
Down in the hole
