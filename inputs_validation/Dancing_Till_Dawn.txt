The way she moves really talks to me  
Im going out of my mind  
Cause the way that she winds Is truly divine  
  
She takes her time as she approaches me  
Then she gives me the sign as she moves her behind  
That only God would design  
  
Like a bullet from a gun the dj makes a run  
When she feels a beat my baby  
I cant get her off the floor  
She keeps me dancin til dawn  
  
The lights are low  
She likes to dance for me  
Its making me high cause the look in her eye  
Is hot as July  
Hey  
  
The night is young gold bars the place to be  
The music is right cause the dj is tight  
Zappa into Barry White yeah  
  
Like a bullet from a gun the dj makes a run  
When she feels a beat my baby I cant get her off the floor  
She keeps me dancin til dawn  
  
Like a bullet from a gun the dj makes a run  
When she feels a beat my baby I cant get her off the floor  
She keeps me dancin til dawn  
  
Like a bullet from a gun the dj makes a run  
When she feels a beat my baby I cant get her off the floor  
She keeps me dancin til dawn  
  
Like a bullet from a gun the dj makes a run  
When she feels a beat my baby I cant get her off the floor  
She keeps me dancing til dawn  
Like a bullet from a gun the dj makes a run  
When she feels a beat my baby I cant get her off the floor  
She keeps me dancing til dawn  
She keeps me dancing  
Like a bullet from a gun the dj makes a run  
When she feels a beat my baby I cant get her off the floor  
She keeps me dancing til dawn
