Kinda like a cloud I was up way up in the sky  
And I was feeling some feelings you wouldnt believe  
Sometimes I dont believe them myself and I decided I was never coming down  
Just then a tiny little dot caught my eye  
It was just about too small to see  
But I watched it way too long  
That dot was pulling me down  
  
Chorus  
I was up above it  
I was up above it  
I was up above it  
I was up above it  
Now Im down in it  
Shut up  
  
So what what does it matter now  
I was swimming in the hate now I crawl on the ground  
And everything I never liked about you is kind of seeping into me  
I try to laugh about it now but isnt it funny how everything works out  
I guess the jokes on me  
  
Chorus  
  
I used to be so big and strong  
I used to know my right from wrong  
I used to never be afraid  
I used to be somebody  
I used to have something inside  
Now just this hole its open wide  
Used to want it all  
I used to be somebody  
Ill cross my heart and hope to die  
But the needles already in my eye  
And all the worlds weight is on my back and I dont even know why  
And what I used to think was me is just a fading memory  
I looked him right in the eye and said goodbye  
  
Chorus  
  
Rain rain go away  
Come again some other day  
Chorus  
Na na na na na na na na
