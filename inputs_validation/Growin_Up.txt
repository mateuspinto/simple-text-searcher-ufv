I stood stonelike at midnight suspended in my masquerade  
I combed my hair till it was just right and commanded the night brigade  
I was open to pain and crossed by the rain and I walked on a crooked crutch  
I strolled all alone through a fallout zone and came out with my soul  
Untouched  
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said Sit down I stood
up  
Oohooh growin up  
The flag of piracy flew from my mast my sails were set wing to wing  
I had a jukebox graduate for first mate she couldnt sail but she sure could
sing  
I pushed B52 and bombed em with the blues with my gear set stubborn on
standing  
I broke all the rules strafed my old high school never once gave thought to
landing  
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said Come down I threw
up  
Oohooh growin up  
  
I took monthlong vacations in the stratosphere and you know its really hard
to hold your breath  
I swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared I was the cosmic kid  
Well my feet they finally took root in the earth but I got me a nice little  
Place in the stars  
I swear I found the key to the universe in the engine of an old parked car  
I hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd but when they said Sit down I stood
up  
Oohooh growin up  
Oohooh growin up
