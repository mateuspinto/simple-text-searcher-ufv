Please dont see  
Just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies  
Please see me  
Reaching out for someone I cant see  
  
Take my hand lets see where we wake up tomorrow  
Best laid plans sometimes are just a one night stand  
Ill be damned Cupids demanding back his arrow  
So lets get drunk on our tears  
  
And God tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young  
Its hunting season and the lambs are on the run  
Searching for meaning  
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark  
  
Who are we  
Just a speck of dust within the galaxy  
Woe is me  
If were not careful turns into reality  
  
But dont you dare let our best memories bring you sorrow  
Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer  
Turn the page maybe well find a brand new ending  
Where were dancing in our tears  
  
And God tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young  
Its hunting season and the lambs are on the run  
Were searching for meaning  
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark  
  
I thought I saw you out there crying  
I thought I heard you call my name  
I thought I heard you out there crying  
But just the same Oh yeah yeah yeah  
  
And God give us the reason youth is wasted on the young  
Its hunting season and this lambs are on the run  
Searching for meaning  
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark  
  
And I thought I saw you out there crying  
And I thought I heard you call my name  
And I thought I heard you out there crying  
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark  
Are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark
