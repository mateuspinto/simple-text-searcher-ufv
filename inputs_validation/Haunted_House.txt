I know babys bad for my selfesteem  
Find another face for your sympathy  
Some of us cry some of them lie  
but no one sees inside  
  
The spark of babys eyes and I turn to stone  
Maybe I cant survive in the danger zone  
Sounds of the night  
Streets without light  
And babys not alone  
  
Try to hold her to myself  
Someone else is breaking all my dreams She  
needs so many games to play  
One more time I climb the stairs  
Open up the door and she was gone  
  
And baby here I go  
like a lamb to slaughter  
  
Dont stop haunting me in this old house like a lamb to slaughter  
I still love you when youre not around  
Im still waiting for your midnight ride like a lamb to slaughter  
Ill still love you when its cold outside  
Me so sorry that I let you down like a lamb to slaughter  
But you keep haunting me in this old town  
  
And the smile is no longer there  
The face and the eyes and the hair  
Nothing stands the test of time  
You live forever never mine  
I cling to dreams that turn to sand  
Our life is now a distant land  
  
We commit emotional suicide  
Every single room is electrified  
Your memory shadowing me  
The house where sorrow hides  
  
Pull it down blow it up  
Help me send these walls of love away  
  
And baby here I go  
like a lamb to slaughter  
  
Dont stop haunting me in this old house like a lamb to slaughter  
I still love you when youre not around  
Im still waiting for your midnight ride like a lamb to slaughter  
Ill still love you when its cold outside  
Me so sorry that I let you down like a lamb to slaughter  
But you keep haunting me in this old town  
  
Like a lamb to slaughter  
Dont stop haunting me in this old house like a lamb to slaughter  
I still love you when youre not around
