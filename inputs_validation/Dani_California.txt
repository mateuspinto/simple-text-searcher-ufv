Getting born in the state of Mississippi  
Papa was a copper and mama was a hippie  
In Alabama she would swing a hammer  
Price you got to pay when you break the panorama  
She never knew that there was anything more than all  
What in the world does your compliment take me for  
Black bandana sweet Louisiana  
Robbing on a bank in the state of Indiana  
Shes a runner  
Rebel and a stunner  
On her merry way sayin Baby watcha gonna  
Looking down the barrel of a hot metal fortyfive  
Just another way to survive  
  
Chorus  
California rest in peace  
Simultaneous release  
California show your teeth  
Shes my priestess  
Im your priest  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Shes a lover  
Baby and a fighter  
Shoulda seen it comin when it got a little brighter  
With a name like Dani California  
Tje day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya  
A little loadedshe was stealin another breath  
I love my baby to death  
  
Chorus  
  
Who knew the other side of you  
Who knew that others died to prove  
Too true to say goodbye to you  
Too true to say say say  
  
Pushed the fader  
Gifted animator  
One for the now  
And eleven for the later  
Never made it up to Minnesota  
North Dakota man  
Was a gunnin for the quota  
Down in the Badlands she was savin the best for last  
It only hurts when I laugh  
Gone to fast  
  
Chorus x2
