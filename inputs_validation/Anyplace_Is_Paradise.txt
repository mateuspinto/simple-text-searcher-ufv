Whether youre riding down a highway  
Or walkin down a street  
It makes no difference baby  
Im gonna love you just as mean  
Cause holdin your little hand  
Makes me feel so very nice  
Anyplace is paradise  
When Im with you  
  
Whether were standin on a doorstep  
Or sittin at a park  
Or strollin down shady lane  
Or dancin in the dark  
Well I can take you in my arms  
And look into your pretty eyes  
Anyplace is paradise  
When Im with you  
  
Give me a cave up in the mountain  
Or a shack down by the sea  
And I will be in heaven honey  
If you are there with me  
Well kiss your pretty lips  
See the lovelight in your eyes  
Anyplace is paradise  
When Im with you  
  
Baby Id live deep in the jungle  
And sleep up in a tree  
And let the rest of the world go be  
If you were there with me  
Well I could love you all the time  
Baby a jungle would be fine  
Anyplace is paradise  
When Im with you
