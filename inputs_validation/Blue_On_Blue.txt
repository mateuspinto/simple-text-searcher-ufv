Found your picture in an old coat  
And the ghost stirred deep inside  
All this time and I still feel the cold  
From the madness in my pride  
Dont know why you ended it that way  
I wouldve thought that you would tell  
Me to my face  
CHORUS  
Color me blue on blu  
Color me sadness without you  
Color me blue on blue  
And I will wear it well  
I will wear it well  
Painted someone from a vision  
You saw the future in his eyes  
I know that wasnt how you pictured me  
You stole my hope now Ill never know why  
Two hearts who began to beat as one  
I guess you scared yourself  
And now youre on the run
