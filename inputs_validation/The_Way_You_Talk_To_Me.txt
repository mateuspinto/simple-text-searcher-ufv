Over the phone love to hear  
All of the things you say to me mmm  
I just cant wait to hear your voice  
Whispering sweetly to me baby  
All I may want I know you got  
Ready for me to receive oh  
Making me know that youre there for me  
Feels so good inside  
I like the way  
You talk to me  
I like the way  
You talk to me  
Making me feel safe from harm  
With your soft and silky tone mmm  
Cant help but show how good yes I know  
That you got it going on  
And never has come or been a day  
You misled me the wrong way oh no  
Knowing that youre just a just a  
A phone call away oh  
I like the way  
You talk to me  
I like the way  
You talk to me  
I like the way  
You talk to me  
I like the way  
You talk to me  
I like the way  
You talk to me  
I like the way  
You talk to me  
Is that all  
Okay
