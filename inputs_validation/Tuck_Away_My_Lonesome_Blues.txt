Yodel  
Im always blue feeling so blue  
I wish I had someone I knew  
Just to help me tuck away my blues  
Lonesome blues  
So wont you be that someone  
To help me lose the blues  
I really need someone to love me someone to kiss  
Someone to scold me someone to miss  
So help me tuck away my lonesome blues  
Yodel  
I really need someone to love me someone to kiss  
Someone to scold me someone to miss  
So help me tuck away my lonesome blues
