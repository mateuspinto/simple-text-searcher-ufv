Girl Ive known you very well  
Ive seen you growing every day  
I never really looked before  
But now you take my breath away  
  
Suddenly youre in my life  
A part of everything I do  
You got me workin day and night  
Just tryin to keep a hold on you  
  
Here in your arms I found my paradise  
My only chance for happiness  
And if I lose you now I think I would die  
Say youll always be my baby  
We can make it shine  
We can take forever just a minute at a time  
  
More than a woman  
More than a woman to me  
More than a woman  
More than a woman to me  
  
There are stories old and true  
Of people so in love like you and me  
And I can see myself  
Let history repeat itself  
  
Reflecting how I feel for you  
And thinking about those people then  
I know that in a thousand years  
Id fall in love with you again  
  
This is the only way that we should fly  
This is the only way to go  
And if I lose your love I know I would die  
Oh say youll always be my baby  
We can make it shine  
We can take forever just a minute at a time  
  
More than a woman  
More than a woman to me  
More than a woman  
More than a woman to me  
  
More than a woman  
More than a woman to me  
More than a woman  
More than a woman to me  
  
More than a woman  
More than a woman to me  
More than a woman  
More than a woman to me  
  
More than a woman
