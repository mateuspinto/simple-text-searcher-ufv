Well did your baby leave you alone  
And with nobody now to call your own  
I know the feelin I got the feelin  
Oh it happened to me yeahyeah baby  
Well did your baby yeah make you cry  
And did you cry now till you thought you would die  
Well I know the feelin I got the feelin  
It happened to me Im gonna tell you bout it too  
Did you ever oh have the blues  
Say right from your hair child to the bottom of your shoes  
Because you know now down deep in your soul  
Hey that your baby dont love you no more ohohoh  
Would you crawl on your hands and knees  
And would you beg her oh come back please  
Well I know the feelin baby I got the feelin  
It happened to me Oh talk to me baby
