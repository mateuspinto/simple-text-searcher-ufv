Well you knock knock knock and I say Come in  
You open the door and you take a big spin  
Slap your heels and you slap your knees  
Why dont you do the Head and Shoulders with me  
  
Head shoulders knees and toes knees and toes  
Head shoulders knees and toes knees and toes  
And eyes and ears and mouth and nose  
Head shoulders knees and toes knees and toes  
  
Well you knock knock knock and I say Come in  
You open the door and you take a big spin  
Slap your heels and you slap your knees  
Why dont you do the Head and Shoulders with me  
  
Head shoulders knees and toes knees and toes  
Head shoulders knees and toes knees and toes  
And eyes and ears and mouth and nose  
Head shoulders knees and toes knees and toes  
  
Neck elbows hips and feet hips and feet  
And thighs and rears and lips and teeth  
Neck elbows lips and teeth lips and teeth  
  
Well you knock knock knock and I say Come in  
You open the door and you take a big spin  
Slap your heels and you slap your knees  
Why dont you do the Neck and Elbows with me  
  
Neck elbows hips and feet hips and feet  
And thighs and rears and lips and teeth  
Neck elbows lips and teeth lips and teeth  
  
One more time   
  
Well you knock knock knock and I say Come in  
You open the door and you take a big spin  
Slap your heels and you slap your knees  
Why dont you do the Neck and Elbows with me
