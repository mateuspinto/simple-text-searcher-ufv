I would lie awake and cry at night  
But that was then and this is now  
I had an anger that was strong enough  
And I would face the things I run from now  
And everything we did was wonderful  
Now its practical and I dont know how  
All the moves we made were done for love  
Now its not enough it seems somehow  
And all the feeling that I knew would last  
Well they are gone where are they now  
And you were beautiful and dangerous  
And now youve sacrificed some sacred cow  
And I would listen to the things you said  
They all made sense why dont they now  
Not a penny in our pockets then  
We never worried so why do we now  
  
Standing tall against my destiny  
Oh I had visions and I could see  
I would walk a thousand miles for you  
But that was the that was then  
And this ins now this is now  
Look at me now  
This is now  
  
Over decades things are changing me  
I have no energy where am I now  
Too many people seem in need of me  
When I was younger I felt so free  
Can you see the things I care about  
They are not important now time has run out  
And only memories are left with me  
This shallow history becomes my destiny  
I would lie awake and cry all night  
That was then this is now  
This is now
