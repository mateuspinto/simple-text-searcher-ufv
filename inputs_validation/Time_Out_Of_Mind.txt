Son you better be ready for love  
On this glory day  
This is your chance to believe  
What Ive got to say  
  
Keep your eyes on the sky  
Put a dollar in the kitty  
Dont the moon look pretty  
  
Tonight when I chase the dragon  
The water will change to cherry wine  
And the silver will turn to gold  
Time out of mind  
  
I am holding the mystical stone  
Its direct from Lasa  
Where people are rolling in the snow  
Far from the world we know  
  
Children we have it right here  
Its the light in my eyes  
Its perfection and grace  
Its the smile on my face  
  
Tonight when I chase the dragon  
The water will change to cherry wine  
And the silver will turn to gold  
Time out of mind  
  
Children we have it right here  
Its the light in my eyes  
Its perfection and grace  
Its the smile on my face  
  
Tonight when I chase the dragon  
the water will change to cherry wine  
And the silver will turn to gold  
Time out of mind
