I quit thinking about killing myself  
When you died  
Just for a day or two  
I must have wanted to  
Just for a day or two  
I must have wanted to live  
I quit believing these lies I tell myself  
When you died  
Just for a day or two  
I must have wanted to  
Just for a day or two  
I must have wanted the truth  
I will always love you my friend  
Now that you died  
But just for a day or two  
Id like to be with you  
Just for a day or two  
Id like to have you alive
