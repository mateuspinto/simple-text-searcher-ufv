Father to son husband to wife  
Brother to brother black man to white  
Living together falling apart  
Looking for the common ground in every human heart  
It all comes down to the two of us  
Yeah this is where we start  
  
We are building the bridge  
One small stone at a time  
With a lot of love  
And some help from above  
From your heart to mine  
  
Theres a land of justice cities filled with pride  
A mountain of hope just on the other side  
Across a river of indifference and a valley of despair  
Theres a tower of courage piercing through the air  
I have a dream for our children I want to take them there  
  
And we are building the bridge  
One small stone at a time  
With a lot of love  
And some help from above  
From your heart to mine  
  
As we seek out understanding  
As we learn to forgive  
When we open up our minds  
When our words are true and kind  
We are building the bridge
