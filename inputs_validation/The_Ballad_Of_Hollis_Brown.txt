Hollis Brown he lived on the outside of town  
Hollis Brown he lived on the outside of town  
With his wife and five children  
In his cabin broken down  
  
He looked for work and money and he walked a ragged mile  
He looked for work and money and he walked a ragged mile  
Your children are so hungry  
That they dont know how to smile  
  
Your babys eyes look crazy and theyre tuggin at your sleeve  
Your babys eyes look crazy and theyre tuggin at your sleeve  
You walk the floor and you wonder why  
With every breath you breathe  
  
The rats have got your flour bad blood it got your mare  
The rats have got your flour bad blood it got your mare  
Is there anyone that knows  
Is there anyone that cares  
  
You prayed to the Lord above to please send you a friend  
You prayed to the Lord above to please send you a friend  
Your empty pockets tell you  
That you aint got no friend  
  
Your babys a cryin louder now its poundin on your brain  
Your babys a cryin louder now its poundin on your brain  
Your wifes screams are a stabbin you  
Like dirty drivin rain  
  
Your grass is turnin black and theres no water in your well  
Your grass is turnin black and theres no water in your well  
You spent your last lone dollar  
On them seven shotgun shells  
  
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls  
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls  
Your eyes fix on the shotgun  
Thats hangin on the wall  
  
Your brain it is a bleedin and your legs cant seem to stand  
Your brain it is a bleedin and your legs cant seem to stand  
Your eyes fix on the shotgun  
That youre holdin in your hand  
  
Theres seven breezes blowin around the cabin door  
Theres seven breezes blowin all around the cabin door  
Seven shots ring out  
Like the oceans pounding roar  
  
Theres seven people dead on a South Dakota farm  
Theres seven people dead on a South Dakota farm  
Somewhere in the distance  
Theres seven new people born
