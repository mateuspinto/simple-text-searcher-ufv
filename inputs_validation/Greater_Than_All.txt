We call out Your Name in the darkness  
And watch as Your glory unfolds  
For there is no measure or end  
To the power You hold  
  
Justice and truth are Your virtues  
With many too vast for our words  
No mind contains the splendor  
Of all that You are  
  
Our God  
Our God has done great things  
Our God is greater than all  
  
Miracles are Your memorial  
The promise of wonders to come  
You are the Author  
God You complete it all  
  
Our God  
Our God has done great things  
Our God is greater than all  
x2  
  
All of the praise  
Unto Your Name  
Be lifted higher  
All of the praise  
Unto Your Name  
Forever  
x2  
  
Our God  
Our God has done great things  
Our God is greater than all  
x3  
  
All of the praise  
Unto Your Name  
Be lifted higher  
All of the praise  
Unto Your Name  
Forever  
x2
