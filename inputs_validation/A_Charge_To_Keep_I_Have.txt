A charge to keep I have  
God to glorify  
A never dying soul to save  
And fit it for the sky  
  
To serve to present age  
My calling to fulfill  
O may it all my powers engage  
To do my Masters will  
  
Arm me with jealous care  
As in Thy sight to live  
And O Thy servant Lord prepare  
A strict account to give  
  
Help me to watch and pray  
And on Thyself rely  
Assured if I my trust betray  
I shall forever die
