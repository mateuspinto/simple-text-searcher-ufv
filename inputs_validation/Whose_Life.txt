Uuu youre just in time  
Come get inside my head  
Uuu the war of words  
Youre underneath my skin  
You hate the way I wear my clothes  
You hate my friends and where we go  
I see you in the shadows  
You think you know whats best for me  
You hate everything you see in me  
Have you looked in a mirror  
Hey just whose life is this anyway  
You tell me how to live but who asked you anyway  
Hey just whose life is this anyway  
Got so much more than a price  
When are you gonna pay  
  
You only point out fault  
An anxiety attack  
Youre a nay you mouth  
You stab me in my back  
  
You hate the way I wear my clothes  
You hate my friends and where we go  
I see you in the shadows  
You think you know whats best for me  
You hate everything you see in me  
Have you looked in a mirror  
Hey just whose life is this anyway  
You tell me how to live but who asked you anyway  
Hey just whose life is this anyway  
Got so much more than the price  
When are you gonna pay  
  
Hey just whose life is this anyway  
You tell me how to live but who asked you anyway  
Hey just whose life is this anyway  
Got so much more than the price  
When you gonna pay  
  
Hey just whose life is this anyway  
You tell me how to live but who asked you anyway  
Hey just whose life is this anyway x3
