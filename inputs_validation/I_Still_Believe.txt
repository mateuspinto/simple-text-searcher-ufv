No oh No Yeah Yeah Oh  
You look in my eyes and I get emotional inside  
I know its crazy but you still can touch my heart  
And after all this time you think that I wouldnt feel the same  
But time hasnt done nothing nothing has changed  
  
I still believe  
Someday you and me  
Will find ourselves  
In love again  
  
I had a dream  
Someday you and me  
Will find ourselves  
In love again  
  
Each day of my life I am filled with all the joy I could find  
You know that I Im not the desperate type  
If theres one spark of hope left in my grasp Id hold it with both  
Hands  
Its worth the risk of burning to have a second chance  
  
No no no no no no I need you baby  
I still believe that we can be together no  
If we believe that true love never has to end  
Then we must know that we will love again mmm  
  
I still believe  
Someday you and me  
Will find ourselves  
In love again Oh baby yeah  
  
I had a dream  
You and me  
Will find ourselves  
In love again  
  
I still believe Ooh baby I do  
Someday you and me Just give me one more try  
In love again  
  
I had a dream I miss your love  
Someday you and me  
Will find ourselves  
In love again  
  
I still believe  
Someday you and mewill find ourselves in love
