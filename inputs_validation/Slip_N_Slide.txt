Band gonna play that rock n roll  
Sound of the music gonna groove your soul  
Band gonna do that slip n slide  
Sound of the music gonna get you high  
  
Now if you dig Chuck Berry and your heads into rock n roll  
Come on down the road a piece  
The cats are gonna burn your soul  
  
Chorus  
And they all was a reelin  
Well they all was a rockin  
The place was blown sky high  
Grandpas sittin in the corner  
Mixin his rock with rye  
  
Now if you dig the dixieland and your hearts into rhythm and blues  
Come on down the road a piece  
The cats are gonna break the news  
  
Chorus  
And they all was a reelin  
They all was a rockin  
The bass man drives it on home  
Now if you dig the dixieland  
Listen to that slide trombone  
  
If you think Im a bit oldfashioned  
And you want to maintain your cool  
The rhythm of the music is guaranteed  
To make you out a fool  
  
Chorus  
And they all was a slippin  
They all was a slidin  
The place was blown sky high  
Now if you dig the boogie  
The cats will blow your mind  
  
Band gonna play that rock n roll  
Sound of the music gonna groove your soul  
Band gonna do that slip n slide  
Sound of the music gonna get you high  
  
Slip n slide  
Slip n slide
