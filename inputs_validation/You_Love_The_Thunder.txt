When you look over your shoulder  
And you see the life that youve left behind  
When you think it over do you ever wonder  
What it is that holds your life so close to mine  
You love the thunder and you love the rain  
What you see revealed within the anger is worth the pain  
And before the lightning fades and you surrender  
Youve got a second to look at the dark side of the man  
You love the thunder and you love the rain  
You know your hunger like you know your name  
And I know you wonder how you ever came  
To be a woman in love with a man in search of the flame  
Draw the shade and light the fire  
For the night that holds you and calls your name  
And just like your lover knows your desire  
And the crazy longing that time will never tame  
You love the thunder and you love the rain  
You know your hunger like you know your name  
I got your number if its still the same  
You can dream  
But you can never go back the way you came
