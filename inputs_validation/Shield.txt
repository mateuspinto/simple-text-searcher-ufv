Mama plays a queen on the hill built on a dream  
While the children play in the field  
Papa smokes the pipe of a sweet and better life  
But how strong is the shield  
Can peace be found on the carpet above ground  
Where sky is forever blue  
  
So let it pass baby now the slow and riding cloud  
Which may take me from you  
  
Many things a man can lose  
His self his rights his views  
But never his heart or his love  
So take this hand of mine and climb baby climb  
To the hill up above  
  
Now you can play a queen on the hill built on a dream  
While our children play in the field  
I can smoke the pipe of a sweet and better life  
And trust in the strength of the shield  
  
So trust in you love and Lucy of above  
And let light pass like a wheel  
Dont take the chance of lifes hectic dance  
Kiss the strength of the shield  
  
The seeker will be found by the looker on the ground  
And to his wish he will yield  
  
Fate will have its word of course  
Think this line is wrong  
And time will change its course  
And hold the strength of the shield
