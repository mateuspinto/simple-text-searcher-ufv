come on children mind the gap  
  
Miracle people with marvelous hair  
And a knack to do anything  
Better than anyone  
I got a home with electrical air  
And I live in a world  
Smaller than any one  
I got a line a new frontier  
I got a line on a new America  
All of the people are vanishing here  
I could be huge if I could just get from  
  
The outside of everything  
To the inside of you  
From the outside of everything  
To the inside of you  
  
Purest Aluminum people  
Are walking the streets of London  
So hysterical  
Nobody here gets a word that I say  
And the problems Im told  
Are more than medical  
I got a friend from the new frontier  
And Galen she says  
this is not america  
You need a girl with electrical hair  
And the word that you wanted was alyouminium  
  
From the outside of everything  
To the inside of you  
From the outside of everything  
To the inside  
  
I was in bed with  
The girl at the end of the world  
She says Im goin home  
And you should come home too  
Im at the end of a new frontier  
Here at the edge of the flat earth ending  
Im getting off to get lost in the air  
At the end of the world where the light is bending  
  
From the outside of everything to the inside of you  
From the outside of everything to the inside of you  
From the outside of everything to the inside of you  
From the outside of everything to the inside of you  
To the inside of you  
To the inside of you  
To the inside of you  
To the inside of you
