Dont haunt me  
Dont haunt me  
  
Gather up the lost and sold  
Into your arms  
Into your arms  
  
Gather up the pitiful  
In your arms  
In your arms  
In your arms  
In your arms  
  
What seems impossible  
In your arms  
In your arms  
  
I think I have had my fill  
In your arms  
In your arms  
In your arms  
In your arms  
  
Ive think I should give up the ghost  
Into your arms  
Into your arms
