On your own when it all goes wrong like youre in jail  
Torn in two threw the blame at you  
Night met reveals  
There is no guarantee what crazy heart like me  
Should I go curl up and die  
Surreal  
Precious time is slipping away  
Revealed  
Dont go wishing your life away  
Unreal  
A fortune can spend it on anyway  
A steal  
Precious time is running away  
One line folds and the next strikes gold  
Finds me in jail  
Try to run gotta buy me some free time and bail  
There is no guarantee fool for a hangmans tree  
Should I go curl up and die  
Surreal  
Precious time is slipping away  
Revealed  
Dont go wishing your life away  
Unreal  
A fortune can spend it on anyway  
A steal  
Precious time is running away  
There is no guarantee what crazy fool like me  
Should I go curl up and die
