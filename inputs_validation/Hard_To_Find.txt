I tried to tie you to the bed saliva at my lips  
I made it look so comfortable but could not feel to grip  
Your eyelids flickered with surprise as suddenly you saw  
Your hands and feet all bound and gagged and me out on the floor  
It gets harder and hard so hard  
It gets harder and hard so hard  
It gets harder and hard so hard  
It gets so hard  
  
I tried to dance around the room in ballerina tights  
With music from the Valkyries and dimmers on my lights  
You tapped your feet and said that I should take another twirl  
You said that I would be so good if I was just a girl  
  
I try to touch you with a song arouse you with some grapes  
Enchant you with some lavender but this was my mistake  
Cause you prefer to move around to play at postmans knock  
Id like to see your sails go up the face smile on your clock
