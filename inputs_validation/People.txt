People  
People who need people  
Are the luckiest people in the world  
Were children needing other children  
And yet letting a grownup pride  
Hide all the need inside  
Acting more like children than children  
Lovers are very special people  
Theyre the luckiest people in the world  
With one person one very special person  
A feeling deep in your soul  
Says you were half now youre whole  
No more hunger and thirst  
  
But first be a person who needs people  
People who need people  
Are the luckiest people in the world  
With one person one very special person  
A feeling deep in your soul  
Says you were half now youre whole  
No more hunger and thirst  
But first be a person who needs people  
People who need people  
Are the luckiest people in the world
