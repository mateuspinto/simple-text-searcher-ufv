They cant stop us  
Let em try  
For Heavy Metal  
We will die  
  
Quit my job this morning sad forever  
I would hold my head up high  
Cause I need Metal in my life  
Just like an eagle needs to fly  
  
So I walked outside into the street  
From a hall I heard thunder and screams  
I walked inside so I could hear  
And the guy beside me gave me a beer  
  
He had his fist up in the air  
And called me brother said my friends  
Are over there  
  
They call themselves Immortals  
Theyre the truest of the true  
And in that very moment  
I was born again like you  
  
They said hold your head up high  
Raise your fist up in the air  
Play Metal louder than Hell  
Louder than Hell  
  
They cant stop us  
Let em try  
For Heavy Metal  
We will die  
  
Brothers stand beside me theres a battle on  
Know my words are true  
Theres a battle for true Metal  
Theyre marching
