We used to ride baby  
Ride around in limousines  
We looked so fine baby  
You in white and me in green  
Drinking and dancing  
All inside and crazy dream  
Well now look at your face now baby  
Look at you and look at me  
  
I get so scared  
Just to see you on the street  
Theyre living dead  
Your all the same you never speak  
Your wrecked out now  
Washed up high up on the beach  
Well now look at your face now baby  
Look at you and look at me  
  
We used to shine shine shine shine  
Say what a pair say what a team  
We used to ride ride ride ride  
In a long black limousine  
Those dreams are gone baby  
Locked away and never seen  
Well now look at your face now baby  
Look at you and look at me
