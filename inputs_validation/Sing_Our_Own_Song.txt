The great flood of tears that weve cried  
For our brothers and sisters whove died  
Over four hundred years  
Has washed away our fears  
And strengthened our pride  
Now we turn back the tide  
  
We will no longer hear your command  
We will seize the control from your hand  
We will fan the flame  
Of our anger and pain  
And youll feel the shame  
For what you do in gods name  
  
Chorus  
We will fight for the right to be free  
We will build our own society  
And we will sing we will sing  
We will sing our own song  
  
When the ancient drum rhythms ring  
The voice of our forefathers sings  
Forward Africa run  
Our day of freedom has come  
For me and for you  
Amandla Awethu  
  
Chorus  
  
We will fight for the right to be free  
We will build our own society  
And we will sing we will sing  
We will sing our own song
