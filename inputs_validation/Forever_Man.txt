How many times must I tell you baby  
How many bridges Ive got to cross  
How many times must I swear to myself  
Before I can talk to the boss  
Before I can talk to the boss  
  
Repeat x2  
How many times must I say I love you  
Before you finally understand  
Wont you be my forever woman  
Ill try to be your forever man  
Try to be your forever man  
  
Forever man forever man forever man  
Forever man forever man forever man  
Ill try to be your forever man  
Forever man forever man forever man  
Forever man forever man forever man  
Forever man forever man forever man  
Ill try to be your forever man
