Listen easy you can hear God calling  
Walking barefoot by the stream  
Come on to me Your hairs softly falling  
On my face as in a dream  
And the time will be our time  
And the grass wont pay no mind  
  
Saying nothing lying where the sun is  
Baking down upon our sides  
My lips touch you with their soft wet kisses  
Your hands gentle in reply  
And the time will be our time  
And the grass wont pay no mind  
  
Child touch my soul with your cries  
And the music will know what weve found  
I hear a hundred goodbyes  
But today I hear only one sound  
The moment were living is now  
Now now now now now now now  
  
Young bird flying and a soft wind blowing  
Cools the sweat inside my palms  
Close my eyes hear the flowers growing  
As you lay sleeping in my arms  
And the time will be our time  
And the grass wont pay no mind  
No the grass wont pay no mind
