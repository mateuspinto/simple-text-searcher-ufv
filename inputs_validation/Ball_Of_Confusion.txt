People moving out  
People moving in  
Why because of the color of their skin  
Run run run but you just cant hide  
  
An eye for an eye  
Tooth for a tooth  
Vote for me and Ill set you free  
Rap on brother rap on  
  
Well the only person talking about loving thy brother is the preacher  
And it seems nobodys interested in learning but the teacher  
Segregation demonstration integration determination aggravation
humiliation  
Obligation to our nation  
  
Ball of confusion  
Thats what the world is today hey  
  
The sale of pills is at an all time high  
Young folks walk with their heads in the sky  
The cities aflame in the summertime  
And oh the beat goes on  
  
Evolution revolution gun control sound of soulshooting rockets to the
moon  
Kids growing up too soon  
Politicians say More taxes will solve everything  
The band played on  
  
So round and around and around we go  
Where the worlds headed nobody knows  
  
Oh Great Googamooga  
Cant you hear me talking to you  
Just a ball of confusion  
Thats what the world is today hey  
  
Fear in the air tension everywhere  
Unemployment rising fast  
The Beatles new records a gas  
And the only safe place to live  
Is on an Indian reservation  
The band played on  
  
Eve of destruction tax deduction  
City inspectors bill collectors mod clothes in demand  
Population out of hand suicide too many bills  
Hippies moving to the hills  
People all over the world are shouting End the war  
And the band played on  
  
Great Googamooga  
Cant you hear me talking to you  
Just a Ball Of Confusion ac
