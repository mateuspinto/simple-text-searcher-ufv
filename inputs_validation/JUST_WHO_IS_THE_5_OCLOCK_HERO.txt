Hello darlin  Im home again  
Covered in shit and aches and pains  
Too knackered to think so give me time to come round  
Just gimme the living room beat to the TV sound   
  
My hard earned dough goes in bills and the larder  
And that Prince Philip tells us we gotta work harder  
It seems a constant struggle just to exist  
Scrimping and saving and crossing of lists   
  
From this window Ive seen the whole world pass  
From dawn to dusk Ive heard the last laugh laughed  
Ive seen enough tears to wash away this street  
Ive heard wedding bells chime and a funeral march  
  
When as one life finishes another one starts   
Alright then love so Ill be off now  
Its back to the lunchbox and workermanagement rows  
Theres gotta be more to this old life then this  
Scrimping and saving and crossing of lists
