Wake up  
My love  
Never thought youd make me break me  
Now Im up from below  
Such a brilliant star you are  
And will your love keep burning baby  
Burn a hole right through my eyes  
All these short times feel like no time  
I thought you ought to know  
Im so far gone now I been running on empty  
Im so far gone now  
Do you want to take me on  
  
Do Do you Do you know  
Do you know how long Ive waited  
To look up from below  
Just to find someone like you  
And will your love like burn me baby  
Burn a hole right through my heart  
I think I might just trust you maybe  
But Im not sure  
Im not sure I want to know  
  
Im so far gone now I been running on empty  
Im so far gone now  
Do you want to take me on

Could make me take my life

Never thought youd make me break me  
Now Im up from below
