Love is born with lightning bolts  
Electromagnetic force  
Burning skin and fireworks  
A storm on a raging course  
  
Like a force of nature  
Love can fade with the stars at dawn  
Sometimes it takes all your strength  
Just to keep holding on  
At the speed of love  
A radiance that travels  
At the speed of love  
My heart goes out to you  
  
Love is born with solar flares  
From two magnetic poles  
It moves towards a higher plane  
Where two halves make two wholes  
  
Like a force of nature  
Love shines in many forms  
One night we are bathed in light  
One day carried away in the storms  
At the speed of love  
Nothing changes faster  
Than the speed of love  
My heart goes out to you  
  
We dont have to talk  
We dont even have to touch  
I can feel your presence  
In the silence that we share  
Got to keep moving  
At the speed of love  
Nothing changes faster  
Than the speed of love  
Got to keep on shining  
At the speed of love  
Nothing changes faster  
Than the speed of love  
My heart goes out to you
