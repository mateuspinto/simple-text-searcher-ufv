Bring out the charge of the love brigade  
There is spring in the air once again  
Drink to the sound of the song parade  
There is music and love everywhere  
Give a little love to me I want it  
Take a little love from me I want to share it with you  
I feel like a millionaire  
  
Once we were mad we were happy  
We spent all our days holding hands together  
Do you remember my love  
How we danced and played  
In the rain we laid  
Wish that we could stay there forever and ever  
  
Now I am sad  
You are so far away  
I sit counting the hours day by day  
Come back to me how I long for your love  
Come back to me  be happy like we used to be  
Come back come back to me  
Come back come back to me  aah  
Oh come back to me oh my love  
How I long for your love  wont you come back to me yeah  
My fine friend  take me wiz you unt love me forever  
My fine friend  forever  forever  
  
Bring out the charge of the love brigade  
There is spring in the air once again

Come back come back to me  make me feel  
You make me feel like a millionaire
