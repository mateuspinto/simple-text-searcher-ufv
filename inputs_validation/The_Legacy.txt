Tell you a thing  
That you ought to know  
Two minutes of your time  
Then on you go  
  
Tell tale of the men  
All dressed in black  
That most of them  
Not coming back  
  
Sent off to the war  
To play little games  
And on their return  
Cant name no names  
  
Some strange yellow gas  
Has played with their minds  
Has reddened their eyes  
Removed all the lies  
  
And strange as it sounds  
Death knows no bounds  
How many get well  
Only time will tell  
Only time will tell  
  
You lie in your death bed now  
But what did you bring to the table  
Brought us only holy sin  
Utter trust is a deadly thing  
  
To the prayer of holy peace  
We didnt know what was lying underneath  
So how could we be such fools  
And to think that we thought you the answer  
  
I cant begin to understand in all the lies  
But on your death bed I can see it in you eyes  
Just as clear as all the sweat upon your brow  
It really makes sense I can see it clearly now  
  
Tangled up in a web of lies  
Could have been a way to prophesise  
Unaware of the consequence  
Not aware of the secrets that you kept  
  
Nothing that we could believe  
To reveal the facade of faceless men  
Not a thing that we could foresee  
Now a sign that would tell us the outcome  
  
You had us all strung out with  
Promises of peace  
But all along you cover plan was to deceive  
Can it put to rights now only time will tell  
Your prophecies will send us all to hell as well  
  
Left to all our golden sons  
All to pick up on the peace  
You could have given all of them  
A little chance at least  
  
Take the world to a better place  
Given them all just a little hope  
Just think what a legacy  
You know will leave  
  
We seem destined to live in fear  
And some that would say Armageddon is near  
But where theres a life while theres hope  
That man wont self destruct  
  
Why cant we treat our fellow men  
With more respect and a shake of their hands  
But anger and loathing is rife  
The death on all sides is  
Becoming a way of life  
  
We live in an uncertain world  
Fear understanding and ignorance  
Is leading to death  
Only the corpses are left  
For vultures that prey on their bones  
  
But some are just not wanting peace  
Their whole life is death and misery  
The only thing that they know  
Fight fire with fire life is cheap  
  
But if they do stop to think  
That man is teetering right on the brink  
But do you think that they care  
They benefit from death and pain and despair
