One crown  
Shines on through the sound  
One crown  
Born to lose  
One man  
Does not give a damn  
One man  
No excuse  
  
Aces wild  
Aces high  
All the aces  
Aces til you die  
  
White lines fading  
The iron horse rolls on and on and on  
  
Hear your thunder  
Still feeding back  
Still hear your thunder  
The man in black  
Born to lose  
Living to win  
  
One fist  
Hammers through the mist  
One fist  
Steady on  
One heart  
Diehard from the start  
One heart  
Beats its song  
  
Murder all  
Murder one  
Give me murder  
Second class to none  
  
Headlights fading  
The iron horse rolls on and on and on  
  
Hear your thunder  
Still feeding back  
Still hear your thunder  
The man in black  
Born to lose  
Living to win  
  
Hear your thunder  
Still feeding back  
I still hear your thunder  
The man in black  
Born to lose  
No excuse  
  
Til the end  
Been living to win  
Been living to win
