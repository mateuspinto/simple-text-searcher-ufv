Hey there baby with the long hair I know you played it cool  
You play the game of broken hearts with the heart of a fool  
Cause I believed you yes I believed you  
You let me love you with the heart of a fool  
I never was a scholar was never good at school  
I learned to love the hard way with the heart of a fool  
Cause I believed you yes I believed you  
You let me love you with a heart of a fool  
  
You know you should have warned me I didnt know the rules  
Now Im just a lonesome traveller with a heart of a fool  
Cause I believed you yes I believed you  
You let me love you with the heart of a fool  
Too many times I loved you too soon you said goodbye  
Too late I learned my lesson now too many times I cried  
Cause I believed you yes I believed you  
You let me love you with the heart of a fool
