The lightning flashes tensions high  
Bringing light to darkened skies  
Live Jonah in the belly of the beast  
Inside the ark the sound desist  
  
And so the ark swept  
Upon the rising water  
  
Forty days and forty night  
There came a mighty flood upon the land  
Where once were green pastures  
Teeming with life  
Now were oceans deeper than any abyss  
  
Out of depths of sorrow I cry  
Before thee I lye  
If this world shall inherit the mild  
Hear your orphaned child  
  
Lord pray tell save thy child  
The storm still rages inside  
Lord guide them  
Unto dry land amen
