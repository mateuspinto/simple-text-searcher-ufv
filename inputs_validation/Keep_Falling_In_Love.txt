I am found in Your embrace  
Covered by Your love  
Youre my deepest dream I know  
Your love so strong Spirit come  
  
You lift me up to heavens door  
You restored my soul  
I come here without Your touch  
I need You so much need You more  
  
Refrain  
Youre my rock and my redeemer  
The rock on which I stand  
  
Chorus  
I keep falling in love with You Lord  
Every beat of my heart breath that I take  
Through the seasons that change  
Your love remains  
My hiding place my home  
Fallin in love
