Ive been fragile for a long time  
A big old hole inside my heart  
And I was searching through the valley  
Stumbled on love in the dark  
  
Was afraid to try but afraid to never know  
What it feels like to be loved  
Had a hill to climb  
But the places we could go  
Oh I gotta know  
  
So if we ever fell in love  
Would the wind blow would the pain go oh  
So if we ever fell in love  
Oh oh oh  
  
I was empty it was all gone  
The birds would sing but made no sound  
Till I met you found I was all wrong  
You picked me up right off the ground  
  
Was afraid to try and afraid Id fall again  
Crashing down from the sky you know  
Had a hill to climb but with you my heart wont mend  
Thats the one thing we all wanna know  
  
So if we ever fell in love  
Would the wind blow would the pain go oh  
So if we ever fell in love  
Oh oh oh  
  
I just wanna know I just wanna know  
Tell me tell me so baby I just wanna know  
  
I just wanna know I just wanna know  
Tell me tell me so baby I just wanna know  
  
I just wanna know I just wanna know  
Tell me tell me so baby I just wanna know  
  
I just wanna know I just wanna know  
Tell me tell me so baby I just wanna know  
  
So if we ever fell in love  
Would the wind blow would the pain go oh  
Yeah So if we ever fell in love  
Oh oh oh  
  
So if we ever fell in love  
Oh I wanna know what it feels like to be loved
