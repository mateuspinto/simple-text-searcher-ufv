People come around the window  
People come around the door  
People come around and ask me  
If I can say some more  
cause Im a whisperman yes I am  
  
I can read somebodys back hand and I can read your mind  
What you need is body heat ask for it any time  
cause Im a whisperman yeah yes I am  
  
I can see up your staircase and I can see down your hall  
I can see almost anything or anything at all  
cause Im a whisperman yeah yes I am  
  
I can see behind your eyelid  
I can see behind your head  
I can only check you on the windshield  
Write them on your bed  
cause Im a whisperman yeah yes I am  
  
Next ones a song we do called women is losers
