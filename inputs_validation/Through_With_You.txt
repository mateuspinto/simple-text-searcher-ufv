Can you see me  
Floating above your head  
As you lay in bed  
Thinking about everything  
That you did not do  
Cause saying I love you  
Has nothing to do with meaning it  
  
And I dont trust you  
Cause every time youre here  
Your intentions are unclear  
I spend every hour waiting for a phone call  
That I know will never come  
I used to think you were the one  
Now Im sick of thinking anything at all  
  
Chorus  
You aint ever coming back to me  
Thats not how things were supposed to be  
You take my hand just to give it back  
No other lover has ever done that  
  
Do you remember  
The way we used to melt  
Do you remember how it felt  
When I touched you  
Cause I remember very well  
  
And how long has it been  
Since someone you let in  
Has given when I gave to you  
  
And at night when you sleep  
Do you dream I would be there  
Just for a minute or two  
Do you  
  
Chorus  
  
Heartache heartache I just have so much  
A simple love with a complex touch  
There is nothing you can say or do  
I called to let you know Im through with you
