Ow  
Ooh yeah  
Oh  
I never needed love before  
Till I met you girl  
A girl like you I have never seen  
You came into my life like a whirlwind girl  
You let me know what lovin really means  
  
Lady strange oh lady strange I want you  
Lady strange oh lady strange I need you  
  
You got me where you want me girl  
So no messin around  
You know I never played that hard to please  
Ive been here many times before  
And walked this sacred ground  
But this time you got me on my knees  
You got me  
  
Lady strange oh lady strange I want you  
Lady strange oh lady strange I need you  
Lady strange oh lady strange I want you  
Lady strange oh lady strange I want you  
I need you  
  
Oh youre so strange  
Oh oh oh  
Taking love from yous like taking candy from a baby  
But lady strange there is no stranger lady  
No  
Just you and me we make love good love  
So let me know what lovin really means  
Woman please  
  
Lady strange oh lady strange I want you  
Lady strange oh lady strange I need you  
  
I need you  
I want you  
Yeah
