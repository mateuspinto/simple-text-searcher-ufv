When the feeling is ended  
There aint no use pretending  
Dont you worry its only love  
When your world has been shattered  
Aint nothing else matters  
It aint over its only love  
And thats all  
  
When your heart has been broken  
Hard words have been spoken  
It aint easy but its only love  
And if your life aint worth living  
And youre ready to give in  
Just remember that its only love  
Yeah thats all  
  
You can live without the aggravation  
You gotta want to win you gotta want to win  
You keep looking back in desperation  
Over and over and over again
