Youd rather have wine than gin  
Only the finest by your skin  
Always running after Time catching  
Youre fancy with rhyme  
Shining on the front page again  
  
Hot on the presses today little queen  
Making your passion play little queen  
Nobody knows your melancholy mind  
Little queen  
  
Away from the sellers the papers said  
Your crown was tight and heavy on your head  
Still you danced and you sang all night  
The telephone rang  
Music kept on playing from your pen  
  
Hot on the presses today little queen  
Making your passion play little queen  
Nobody knows your melancholy mind  
Little queen  
  
Raining Raining he knows your Soul aint free  
Raining Raining he feels you little queen  
  
Slipping away with your gypsy band  
Hot on your music and playing a winning hand  
He was standing in the line thinking how you  
Moved his mind  
Feeling like he held you in his hand
