I see you walking baby down the street  
Pushing that baby carriage at your feet  
I see the lonely ribbon in your hair  
Tell me I am the man for whom you put it there  
  
You never smile girl you never speak  
You just walk on by darlin week after week  
Raising two kids alone in this mixed up world  
Must be a lonely life for a working girl  
  
Chorus  
Little girl I want to marry you  
Oh yeah little girl I want to marry you  
Yes I do  
Little girl I want to marry you  
  
Now honey I dont want to clip your wings  
But a time comes when two people should think of these things  
Having a home and a family  
Facing up to their responsibilities  
They say in the end true love prevails  
But in the end true love cant be no fairytale  
To say Ill make your dreams come true would be wrong  
But maybe darlin I could help them along  
  
Chorus  
  
My daddy said right before he died  
That true true love was just a lie  
He went to his grave a broken heart  
An unfulfilled life makes a man hard  
  
Oh darlin  
Theres something happy and theres something sad  
Bout wanting somebody oh so bad  
I wear my love darlin without shame  
Id be proud if you would wear my name
