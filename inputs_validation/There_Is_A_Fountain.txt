There is a fountain filled with blood  
Drawn from Immanuels veins  
And sinners plunged beneath that flood  
Lose all their guilty stains  
  
Lose all their guilty stains  
Lose all their guilty stains  
And sinners plunged beneath that flood  
Lose all their guilty stains  
The dying thief rejoiced to see  
That fountain in his day  
And there may I though vile as he  
Wash all my sins away  
  
Away  
Away  
Wash all my sins away  
  
Eer since by faith I saw the stream  
Thy flowing wounds supply  
Redeeming love has been my theme  
And shall be till I die  
  
And shall be till I die  
And shall be till I die  
Redeeming love has been my theme  
And shall be till I die  
  
Wash all my sins away  
Wash all my sins away  
Redeeming love has been my theme  
And shall be till I die
