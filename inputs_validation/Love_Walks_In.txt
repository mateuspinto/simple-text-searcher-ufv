Contact is all it takes  
To change your life to lose your  
place in time  
Contact asleep or awake  
Coming around you may wake up  
to find  
Questions deep within your  
eyes  
Now more than ever you realize  
  
And then you sense a change  
Nothing feels the same  
All your dreams are strange  
love comes walkin in  
Some kind of alien  
Waits for the opening  
Then simply pulls a string  
  
Another world some other time  
You lay your sanity on the line  
Familiar faces familiar sights  
Reach back remember with all  
your might  
Ohh there she stands in a  
silken gown  
Silver lights shining down  
  
And then you sense a change  
Nothing feels the same  
All your dreams are strange  
love comes walkin in  
Some kind of alien  
Waits for the opening  
Then simply pulls a string love  
comes walkin in  
  
Sleep and dream is all I crave  
I travel far across the milky way  
To my master I become a slave  
Tel we meet again some other day  
Where silence speaks as loud  
as war  
And the earth returns to what it  
was before  
  
And then you sense a change  
Nothing feels the same  
All your dreams are strange  
love comes walkin in  
Some kind of alien  
Waits for the opening  
Then simply pulls a string love  
comes walkin in
