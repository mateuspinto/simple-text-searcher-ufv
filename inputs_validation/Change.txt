Once there was a man of power  
Had no care for human life  
Then one day he saw his living lie  
Growing all around him  
The wheel of change had taken over  
Found a love he never knew  
Now he teaches children what is true  
Gather all around him  
What made him choose to turn away  
What makes us change our mind  
The will to see turns you around  
There is no explanation why  
There is no rhyme or reason  
Just feel the love and youre alive  
Running around in your confusion  
From the cradle to the grave  
Aint got time to see the world go by  
Where are you going  
Always moving round in circles  
Talking words that never end  
Standing in the grip of madness  
Why oh why  
What are you saying  
How can we choose to run away  
How do we change our mind  
See the perception turn around  
There is no explanation why  
There is no rhyme or reason  
Just feel the love and youre alive  
Realise this understanding  
Move before it gets too late  
Take this chance  
Or life will pass you by  
This is the only way  
We must pull ourselves together  
Theres so much we must explain  
Got to teach the children what is true  
There is no other way  
Why did we choose to turn away  
Why did we change our mind  
The will to see turns you around  
There is no explanation why  
There is no rhyme or reason  
Just feel the love and youre alive  
The incredible gift of life  
Where the fire within burns bright  
Every moment we live is true  
And the spirit is all in you
