Bah bah bah bah bya ba ba dada  
Bah bah bah bah bya ba ba dada  
Bah bah bah bah bya ba ba dada  
Bah bah bah bah bya ba ba dada da  
  
Welcome my friends  
To a place that may seem  
Most disturbing  
Quite unnerving  
  
Lend me your dreams  
And well add what we need  
To be free  
Terminally  
  
Well fly to a spot  
Where I know there is not  
Any sorrow  
No tomorrow  
  
People just laugh  
Cause they know how it feels  
To have loved  
And be loved  
  
Dont you worry  
Aint no need to hurry  
All you really need  
Is love  
  
Bah bah bah bah bah  
  
Now you may say  
Tell me more of this place  
So inviting  
And exciting  
  
Here and above  
Children love without doubt  
And can be  
They can be  
  
Listen my friends  
Carefully to direction  
To get there  
And you know where  
  
Love is the place  
Skewed to matter and space  
For us all  
For us all  
  
Dont you worry  
Aint no need to hurry  
All you really need  
Is love love love
