I want to be loved I want to be loved  
I want to be loved I need to be loved  
I want to be loved with inspiration  
I want to be loved starting tonight  
Instead of merely holding conversation  
Oh hold me tight  
I want to be loved I crave affection  
Those kisses of yours I gladly share  
I want your eyes to shine in my direction  
Oh make me care  
I want a cant of romance  
That should be strong and equally as tender  
I only asked for the chance to know the meaning  
The word surrender surrender come on surrender  
I want to be thrilled by only you dear  
I want to be thrilled by your caress  
I want to find each dream of mine come true dear  
I want to be loved  
I want the cant of romance  
That should be strong and equally as tender  
I only asked for the chance to know the meaning  
Come on come on surrender surrender surrender surrender  
I want to be thrilled by only you dear  
I want to be thrilled by your caress  
I want to find each dream of mine come true dear  
Oh I want to be loved oh I want to be loved  
I want to be loved oh I want to be loved I need to be loved
