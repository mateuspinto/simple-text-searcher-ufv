I thought I heard someone crying thought I heard someone crying  
And I thought it was me  
I thought I heard someone screaming thought I heard someone screaming  
  
I bleed for you I bleed for I bleed for  
I I I need something to live for  
Is this the end were deserving  
I I I need something to live for  
Im on my knees and Im begging  
  
Somethings fallen from heaven looks like a nightmare coming to haunt me  
I dont believe it  
Fallen from heaven looks like a nightmare coming to save me  
I dont believe it  
  
I thought I saw the sky bleeding thought I saw the sky bleeding  
And I thought I saw you  
I thought I saw oceans burning thought I saw oceans burning  
And I thought I saw you  
  
I thought I saw angels falling  
Beautiful but still falling down  
I bleed for you  
I bleed for  
I bleed for  
  
I I I gave you something to die for  
And this is how you betray me  
I I I gave you something to die for  
And this is how you repay me  
  
Somethings falling from heaven looks like a nightmare coming to haunt me  
I dont believe it  
Falling from heaven looks like a nightmare coming to take me  
I dont believe it
