You are like a secret garden  
As I shuffle through this broken town  
Think of you and you are all around me  
Like the sky when the suns going down  
I want to tell the whole wide world  
And see how love can light your soul  
But you are like my secret garden  
And I want to be with you alone  
  
Oh Hold tight  
Cause the road can be a crazy ride  
And I know were going to be alright  
Cause you are here with me  
Oh woman is so right  
And even if the oceans divide us  
I will be here right by your side  
For the rest of our days  
Here for the rest of our days  
  
If you are tired Ill bear your burden  
If you are dreaming I will not disturb you  
Whatever your heart desires love love  
Ill clear the way for you  
Come winter I will build you a fire  
From the bones of who I used to be  
Before you came and washed the weary away  
Before you came here for me  
So right every day and every night  
By the fire with the snow outside  
And the two of us  
Oh child hold tight  
If it gets to be a crazy ride  
Ill be here right by your side  
For the rest of our days  
Oh for the rest of our days  
  
So right  
Holding on to this crazy ride  
Hold on well be alright  
Me and you and you and me  
Here you come you bring me real love  
From the ground beneath to the stars above  
I was growing down now Im growing up  
With you in my blood  
Yeah this is real love  
Shining down like the stars above  
Arms out and I am growing up  
With you in my blood  
Oh you know that its alright  
Feels bigger than the whole world wide  
You know come the morning light  
Oh I know that I am yours  
That I am yours  
That I am yours
