How do you do what you do to me  
I wish I knew  
If I knew how you do it to me  
Id do it to you  
  
How do you do what you do to me  
Im feeling blue  
Wish I knew how you do it to me  
But I havent a clue  
  
You give me a feeling in my heart oohlala  
Like an arrow piercing through it  
I suppose that you think youre very smart  
But wont you tell me how do you do it  
  
How do you do what you do to me  
I wish I knew  
If I knew how you do it to me  
Id do it to you  
  
You give me a feeling in my heart oohlala  
Like an arrow piercing through it  
I suppose that you think youre very smart  
But wont you tell me how do you do it  
  
How do you do what you do to me  
I wish I knew  
Wish I knew how you do it to me  
But I havent a clue  
  
Wish I knew how you do it to me  
Id do it to you  
Wish I knew how you do it to me  
Id do it to you
