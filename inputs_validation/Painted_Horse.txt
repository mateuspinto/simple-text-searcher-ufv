Child on a painted horse  
Streams that will run their course  
Gone to a far away shore  
Ooh ooh ah  
My painted horse is weeping  
  
Days of another kind  
Frost gets a bruising vine  
Why did the carpenter die  
Ooh ooh ah  
My painted horse is weeping  
  
Sweet as a rose so fine  
Peaceful as a final time  
How old could the lion man cry  
Ooh ooh ah  
My painted horse is weeping  
  
Thoughts of a winter moon  
Warm in a distant room  
Why did I fall asleep so soon  
Ooh ooh ah  
My painted horse is weeping
