How many times have I seen you running  
Just one step ahead of the past  
So many nights have I seen it coming  
I try to talk to you when you pass  
  
I dont know who you were before I met you  
You keep your secret safe with a mask  
Its almost as though the truth is out to get you  
Youre just a runaway from the past  
  
Girl weve got a love worth keeping  
Maybe theres a way to let it go  
Someday when your demons are sleeping  
Let me know let me know  
  
Come out of the darkness baby  
Come in from the night  
You can let the light  
Wash it from your mind  
Open the blinds  
  
So many times have I seen you crying  
Never knowing what its about  
I do my best I just keep on trying  
To find a way inside to let it out  
  
Girl weve got a love worth making  
It would be a shame to close the show  
Now you got a chance worth taking  
Let me know let me know  
  
Come out of the darkness baby  
Come in from the night  
You can let the light  
Wash it from your mind  
  
Come out of the darkness baby  
Come in from the night  
Open up your life leave the past behind  
Open up the blinds
