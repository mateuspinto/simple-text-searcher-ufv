Well the rain is apourin down in a fury  
And the road is lookin long  
And the only thing that comes to mind  
Is the tune of this sad song  
Tune of this sad song Oh Lord  
  
Well the wind is acreepin up my back  
Through the door through the roof through the window crack  
Tossin and aturnin all night long  
To the rhythm and the sound of a saddened song  
Saddened song Oh Lord  
  
In a dream of passion I saw a face  
Of a beautiful woman in a terrible place  
She looked at me and she called for you  
Then she closed her eyes and she sang this tune  
Sang this tune Oh Lord
