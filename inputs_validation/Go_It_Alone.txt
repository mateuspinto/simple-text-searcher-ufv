Its so hard to say goodbye  
When theres nothing left to give  
When this house is just a hill of bones  
Where you and I once lived  
If we put it back together  
By the skin of our teeth  
Youd still pull it all apart  
Bit by bit piece by piece  
And Ill go it alone call this house my home  
Build it up again with someone new  
Build it brick by brick till I find a girl that fits  
This homes a whole lot better without you  
Theres no passion alive  
When you count your phony schemes  
And the cars you drive to buy your friends  
They dont ever come back clean  
If the cards on the table  
Always turn up spades  
The cards that always cheat the hearts  
The spades you play just dug my grave  
And Ill go it alone call this house my home  
Build it up again with someone new  
Build it brick by brick till I find a girl that fits  
This homes a whole lot better without you  
And Ill go it alone call this house my home  
Im gonna build it up again with someone new  
Build it brick by brick till I find a girl that fits  
This homes a whole lot better without you  
Oh Ill go it alone call this house my home  
Build it up again with someone new  
Ill build it brick by brick till I find a girl that fits  
This homes a whole lot better without you  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you
