You and me  
We have no faces  
Soon our lives theyll be erased  
Do you think they will remember  
Or will we just be replaced  
Oh I wish that I could see  
How I wish that I could fly  
All the things that hang above me  
To a place where I can cry  
So what can it be  
No one hears me call  
Echoes back at me  
No ones there  
  
To all these nameless feelings  
I cant deal with in my life  
To all these greedy people  
Trying to feed on what is mine  
Youve got to fill your hunger  
And stop fucking with my mind  
I know its time to leave these places far behind  
You and me  
We have no faces  
They dont see us anymore  
  
Without love as they had promised  
And no faith for whats in store  
Oh I wish that I could see  
How I wish that I could fly  
All the things that hang above me  
To a place where I can cry  
So what can it be  
No one hears me call  
Echoes back at me  
No ones there  
  
To all these nameless feelings  
I cant deal with in my life  
To all these greedy people  
Trying to feed on what is mine  
Youve got to fill your hunger  
And stop fucking with my mind  
I know its time to leave these places far behind  
Where are all these feelings hiding  
  
Dancing in and out my mind  
Burning up all that I long for  
Feeding me till my decline  
Where are you My soul is bleeding  
I am searching am I blind  
All alone and bound forever  
Trapped inside me for all time  
To all these nameless feelings  
I cant deal with in my life  
To all these greedy people  
Trying to feed on what is mine  
Youve got to fill your hunger  
And stop fucking with my mind  
I know its time to leave these places far behind  
I know its time to leave these places far behind
