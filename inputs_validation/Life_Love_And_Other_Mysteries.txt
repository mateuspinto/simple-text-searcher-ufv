You are Lord of life love and other mysteries  
I find in You all I ever need to know  
  
Some say that life is a string of romances  
To some its a series of choices and chances  
While some only live for the curious dances  
Of whatever musics at hand  
  
And some look for love in the eyes of a stranger  
And some love the thrill of the edges of danger  
But I have found joy in a world filled with anger  
Cause I finally understand  
  
Chorus  
You are Lord of life love and other mysteries  
You know my future You know my history  
I find in You all I ever need to know  
About life and love and other mysteries  
  
I cannot reason with men in defiance  
Or try to explain all the mysteries of science  
Cause Im just a child in the face of these giants  
But I never face them alone  
  
Cause when it seems that my heart is surrounded  
When all of our questions of life have been sounded  
I rest in the hope where my faith has been grounded  
I do not fear the unknown cause  
  
Chorus  
  
Your wisdom confounds the wisest of wise  
Your mercy is truth in a world full of lies  
Your grace saves us all from a certain demise  
  
CHORUS 2x  
  
You are lord of life youre lord of love  
and other mysteries  
You are lord of life youre lord of love  
other mysteries
