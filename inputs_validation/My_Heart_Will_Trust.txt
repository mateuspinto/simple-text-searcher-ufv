Ill walk closer now on the higher way  
Through the darkest night will You hold my hand  
Jesus guide my way  
Oh You mourn with me and You dance with me  
For my heart of hearts is bound to You  
Though I walk through valleys low  
Ill fear no evil  
By the waters still my soul  
My heart will trust in You  
Though I walk through valleys low  
Ill fear no evil  
By the waters still my soul  
My heart will trust in You  
My heart will trust in You  
Oh You counsel me and You comfort me  
When I cannot see You light my path  
Though I walk through valleys low  
Ill fear no evil  
By the waters still my soul  
My heart will trust in You  
Though I walk through valleys low  
Ill fear no evil  
By the waters still my soul  
My heart will trust in You  
Though I walk through valleys low  
Ill fear no evil  
By the waters still my soul  
My heart will trust in You  
My heart will trust in You  
My heart will trust in You  
My heart will trust in You  
My heart will trust in You  
My heart will trust in You  
My heart will trust in You  
My heart will trust in You  
Though I walk through valleys low  
Ill fear no evil  
By the waters still my soul  
My heart will trust in You  
Though I walk through valleys low  
Ill fear no evil  
By the waters still my soul  
My heart will trust in You  
My heart will trust in You  
My heart will trust in You  
My heart will trust in You
