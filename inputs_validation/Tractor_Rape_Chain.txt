Why is it every time I think about you  
Something that you have said or implied makes me doubt you  
Then I look into your cynical eyes and I know it  
As if it never meant anything to me  
  
Parallel lines on a slow decline  
Tractor rape chain  
Better yet lets all get wet on the tractor rape chain  
Speed up slow down go all around in the end  
  
In the first place its probably just paranoia  
But theres a ghost in my room and he says I better run  
Its a thing I know  
Its a thing I believe in  
Wont you tell it to go away  
  
Parallel lines on a slow decline  tractor rape chain  
Better yet lets all get wet on the tractor rape chain  
Speed up slow down go all around in the end  
Speed up slow down go all around in the end
