In our times of trouble  
We only had ourselves nobody else  
No one there to save us  
We had to save ourselves  
  
And when the storms came through  
They found me and you Uh back together  
And when the sun would shine  
It was yours and mine Yours and mine forever  
  
Chorus  
Oh how the years go by  
Oh how the love brings tears to my eyes  
All through the changes the soul never dies  
We fight we laugh we cry As the years go by  
  
There were times we stumbled  
They thought they had us down We came around then  
How we rolled and rambled  
We got lost and we got found  
Now were back on solid ground  
  
We took everything  
All our times would bring In this world of changes  
Cause when your heart is strong  
You know youre not alone In this world of strangers  
  
Chorus  
  
And if we lose our way  
Any night or day  
Well well always be  
Where we should be  
  
Im there for you  
And I know youre there for me  
  
As the years go by  
  
You know youre not alone  
In this world of strangers
