To Canaans land Im on my way  
Where the soul of man never dies  
My darkest nights will turn to day  
Where the soul of man never dies  
  
Dear friend there will be no sad farewells  
Dear friend farewell  
There will be no tear dimmed eyes  
Where all is peace and joy and love  
Where all is joy  
Where the soul of man never dies  
  
Ohh garden blooming there for me  
Where the soul of man never dies  
And I shall spend eternity  
Where the soul of man never dies  
  
Dear friend there will be no sad farewells  
Dear friend farewell  
There will be no tear dimmed eyes  
Where all is peace and joy and love  
Where all is joy  
And the soul of man never dies
