Fear runs wild in the veins of the world  
The hate turns the skies jet black  
Death is assured in future plans  
Why live if theres nothing there  
  
Specters of doom await the moment  
The mallet is sure and precise  
Cover the crypts of all mankind  
With cloven hove begone  
  
Chorus  
Sadistic minds  
Delay the death  
Of twisted life  
Malicious world  
  
The crippled youth try in dismay  
To sabotage the carcass Earth  
All new life must perish below  
Existence now is futile  
  
Decrepit breath vile in its stench  
A world in decay  
Transgressor is as one  
  
Chorus  
  
Convulsions take the world in hand  
Paralysis destroys  
Nobodys out there to save us  
Brutal seizure now we die
