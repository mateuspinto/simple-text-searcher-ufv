In the gloom the gathering storm abates  
In the ships gimlet eyes await  
The call to arms to hammer at the gates  
To blow them wide throw evil to its fate  
  
All summers long the drills to build the machine  
To turn men from flesh and blood to steel  
From paper soldiers to bodies on the beach  
From summer sands to Armageddons reach  
  
Overlord your master not your god  
The enemy coast dawning Grey with scud  
These wretched souls puking shaking fear  
To take a bullet for those who sent them here  
  
The worlds alight the cliffs erupt in flame  
No escape remorseless shrapnel rains  
Drowning men no chance for a warriors fate  
A choking death enter hells gate  
  
Sliding we go only fear on our side  
To the edge of the wire  
And we rush with the tide  
Oh the water is red  
With the blood of the dead  
But Im still alive pray to God I survive  
  
Chorus x2  
How long on this longest day  
Til we finally make it through  
How long on this longest day  
Til we finally make it through  
  
The rising dead faces bloated torn  
They are relieved the living wait their turn  
Your numbers up the bullets got your name  
You still go on to hell and back again  
  
Valhalla waits valkyries rise and fall  
The warrior tombs lie open for us all  
A ghostly hand reaches through the veil  
Blood and sand we will prevail  
  
Sliding we go only fear on our side  
To the edge of the wire  
And we rush with the tide  
Oh the water is red  
With the blood of the dead  
But Im still alive pray to God I survive  
  
Chorus x 4
