Lady Writer on the TV  
Talk about the Virgin Mary  
Reminded me of you  
Expectations left to come up to yeah  
  
Lady writer on the TV  
Yeah she had another quality  
The way you used to look  
And I know you never read a book  
  
Chorus  
Just the way that her hair fell down around her face  
Then I recall my fall from grace  
Another time another place  
  
Lady writer on the TV  
She had all the brains and the beauty  
The picture does not fit  
You talked to me when you felt like it  
  
Chorus  
  
Yes and your rich old man  
You know hed call her a dead ringer  
You got the same command  
Plus you mother was a jazz singer  
  
Chorus  
  
Lady writer on the TV  
She knew all about a history  
You couldnt hardly write your name  
I think I want you just the same as the  
  
Lady writer on the TV  
Talking about the Virgin Mary  
Yeah you know Im talking about you and me  
And the lady writer on the TV  
Lady writer on the TV  
Talking about the Virgin Mary  
Yeah you know Im talking about you and me  
And the lady writer on the TV
