You dont call me anymore  
But dont you think that I dont care  
I check the numbers every night  
Just to see if you are there  
Was it just another love affair  
Was it just another love affair Ooh  
My clock goes ticking through the night  
Counting the seconds I dont sleep  
I wish that I could turn back time  
But some things were never meant to keep  
Was it just another love affair  
Was it just a love affair  
Another love affair love affair love affair  
Was it just another love affair  
Was it just a love affair  
Another love affair another love affair  
It will never be the same  
It will never be the same  
It will never be the same  
Without you  
Oh  
Will never be the same will never be the same  
Will never be the same will never be the same  
Will never be the same will never be the same  
Will never be the same never be the same  
And remember how we once were  
When you held me so closely  
We were breathing in the dark light  
There was no more pain  
One love one heart one soul together ooh  
Was it just another love affair  
Was it just a love affair  
Another love affair love affair love affair  
Was it just another love affair  
Was it just a love affair  
Another love affair another love affair oh
