I been working all day long on some old forgotten place  
A place where mom and papa rest beneath the cold cold clay  
Though the tears may fill my eyes theres a smile upon my face  
I see God remembered mom and daddy put flowers on their grave  
  
And theres wild flowers blooming on mom and papas graves  
Theres no tame ones ever brought here anymore  
For the family theyve all gone Ive been in prison much too long  
But God keeps the wild flowers blooming on mom and papas grave  
  
You know I still remember just as though it was only yesterday  
All the hell that my mom and dad went through to live on from day to day  
But the love they both gave us oh it was surely heaven sent  
And all the heartaches that I know Ive caused em God knows Ill always
regret  
  
And theres wild flowers blooming
