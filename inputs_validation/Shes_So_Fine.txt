She walks with a bell clock round her neck  
So the hippies think shes in with time time  
Her hair glistens like robins on a deck  
Branches attack me from her neck  
  
Shes so fine  
Shes so very very fine  
  
The sun from a cloud sinks into her eyes  
The rain from a tree soaks into her mind mind  
Morning sign sounds just like a lock  
All these signs are always a stock  
  
She s so fine  
Shes so very very fine  
  
When I veer I get so near  
But so far far far away  
Listen to me today  
  
We united just beside a leaf  
The ground was hard underneath her her  
  
Shes so fine
