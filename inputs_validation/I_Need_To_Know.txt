Well the talk on the street  
Says you might go solo  
A good friend of mine saw you leavin by the back door  
  
Chorus  
I need to know I need to know  
I need to know I need to know  
If you think youre gonna leave  
Then you better say so  
I need to know I need to know  
I need to know I need to know  
Because I dont know how long  
I can hold on  
And if your makin me wait  
If youre leadin me on  
I need to know I need to know  
I need to know I need to know  
  
Who would a thought  
That youd fall for his line  
All of a sudden its me on the outside  
  
Chorus x2  
  
I need to know I need to know  
I need to know
