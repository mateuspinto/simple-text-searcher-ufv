Brothers here I stand  
Spread my wings and take command  
The sky he justly planned  
The boy become a man  
  
After all this time  
I tell myself that Im  
Not just wasting time  
Oh you know Im not that way inclined  
  
Brothers if you hear  
Raise your flags and make it clear  
There is more to fear  
If we wait for another year  
  
After all this time  
I tella tella myself that Im  
Just passing through time  
  
Oh  
  
After all this time  
I tell myself that Im  
Not just wasting time  
Oh you know Im not that way inclined  
  
Brothers fight or fall  
Its man for man and one for all  
No more can we crawl  
Brothers brothers hear the call  
  
After all this time  
I tell myself that Im  
Not just wasting time  
Oh you know Im not that way inclined  
  
Brother brother  
Brother brother  
  
Brother fight or fall  
Its man for man and one for all  
  
Brother brother  
Brother brother  
  
What you want  
We gotta fight for one another
