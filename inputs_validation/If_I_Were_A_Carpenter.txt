If I were a carpenter and you were a lady  
Would you marry me anyway  
Would you have my baby  
If I worked my hands in wood  
I wonder would you still love me  
I say yes I would Ill put you above me  
Thats what I want you to say  
And would you save my love from loneliness  
Would you save my love from sorrow if you would  
I give you my onlyness girl and all of my tomorrows  
If a tinker were my trade would you still find me  
Carrying the pots and the pans that I made  
Walking along the highway  
That long lonely highway  
If I was a carpenter and you were a lady  
And I was just a carpenter  
Instead of a rock and roll star  
Just a carpenter a carpenter a carpenter
