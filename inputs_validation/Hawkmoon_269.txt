Like a desert needs rain  
Like a town needs a name  
I need your love  
  
Like a drifter needs a room  
Hawkmoon  
I need your love  
I need your love  
  
Like a rhythm unbroken  
Like drums in the night  
Like sweet soul music  
Like sunlight  
I need your love  
  
Like coming home  
And you dont know where youve been  
Like black coffee  
Like nicotine  
I need your love I need your love  
I need your love I need your love  
I need your love I need your love  
  
When the night has no end  
And the day yet to begin  
As the room spins around  
I need your love  
I need your love  
  
Like a Phoenix rising needs a holy tree  
Like the sweet revenge of a bitter enemy  
I need your love  
  
Like the hot needs the sun  
Like honey on her tongue  
Like the muzzle of a gun  
Like oxygen  
I need your love I need your love  
I need your love I need your love  
I need your love I need your love  
  
When the night has no end  
And the day yet to begin  
As the room spins around  
I need your love  
  
I need your love  
Repeat 9 times  
  
Like thunder needs rain  
Like a preacher needs pain  
Like tongues of flame  
Like a sheet stained  
I need your love  
I need your love  
  
Like a needle needs a vein  
Like someone to blame  
Like a thought unchained  
Like a runaway train  
I need your love  
  
I need your love  
Repeat 7 times  
  
Like faith needs a doubt  
Like a freeway out  
I need your love  
  
Like powder needs a spark  
Like lies need the dark  
I need your love  
  
In the heart of the heat of the love  
In the heart of the heat of the love  
Repeat until end
