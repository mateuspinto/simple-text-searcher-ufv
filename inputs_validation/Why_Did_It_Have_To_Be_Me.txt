When you were lonely you needed a man  
Someone to lean on well I understand  
Its only natural  
But why did it have to be me  
Nights can be empty nights can be cold  
So you were looking for someone to hold  
Thats only natural  
But why did it have to be me  
  
I was so lonesome I was blue  
I couldnt help it it had to be you and I  
Always thought you knew the reason why  
I only wanted a little love affair  
Now I can see you are beginning to care  
But baby believe me  
Its better to forget me  
  
Men are toys in the game that you play  
When you get tired you throw them away  
Thats only natural  
But why did it have to be me  
Falling in love with a woman like you  
Happens so quickly theres nothing to do  
Its only natural  
But why did it have to be me  
  
I was so lonesome I was blue  
I couldnt help it it had to be you and I  
Always thought you knew the reason why  
I only wanted a little love affair  
Now I can see you are beginning to care  
But baby believe me  
Its better to forget me
