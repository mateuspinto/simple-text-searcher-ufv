Ooh I got a busted wing and a hornet sting  
Like an out of tune guitar  
Ooh she got Hercules on her side  
And Diana in her eyes  
  
Some men like the Chinese life  
Some men kneel and pray  
Ooh well I like women and I like wine  
And Ive always liked it that way  
Always liked it that way  
  
I cant dig it the way she tease  
That old tough man routine up her sleeve  
Living and loving kissing and hugging  
Living and loving with a cat named Hercules  
A cat named Hercules  
  
Oh and it hurts like hell to see my gal  
Messing with a muscle boy  
No superman gonna ruin my plans  
Playing with my toys  
  
Rich man sweating in a sauna bath  
Poor boy scrubbing in a tub  
Me I stay gritty up to my ears  
Washing in a bucket of mud  
Washing in a bucket of mud
