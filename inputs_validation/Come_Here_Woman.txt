You caught me staring so gently  
You tease me and turn away  
Unlike the young ones  
Your movements you savor  
Like a tango  
My hideaways are longing for you  
You shyly conjure  
These moments surrounding  
Keep me tonight  
All your practiced ways you secretly entice me  
Come here woman  
  
Like an old window  
I need a little shade  
Like an old tomcat  
Lord I love to parade  
Like a broken old man  
Lord I need sun  
  
Ah I need you darlin  
Cause I just aint done  
  
While wheel waters set  
Now my blood yearns  
Your mouth opens woman  
Give me broken lies  
When you dont feel pain  
Let me smell your thighs mama  
Let me drink down a little rain man  
While were drifting cold  
Out beyond the seas  
We wither time into a coil of fear
