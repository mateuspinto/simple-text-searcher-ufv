What does a man do  
What does a man  
That cant distinguish a person from an animal  
What  
  
He will go to his daughter so late  
She is young and shes such sweet bait  
Just as if he were a dog  
With his own flesh and blood he will mate  
  
What  do you do  
What  do you feel  
What  are you  
Only an animal  
  
What does a woman do  
What does a woman do  
That cant tell the difference between a man and an animal  
  
She dips the feather in his blood  
Writes herself so many lines  
A lifeless letter from her childhood  
As her father slept by her side  
  
What animal do you do  
What animal do you feel  
What animal are you  
Only an animal
