Its poetry carved in flesh  
This beautiful hell of ours  
To the deadliest sin we confess  
Tears of joy fill our eyes  
We are safe where disfigured saints  
Cry out their prophecies of doom  
  
My hearts a graveyard baby  
And to evil we make love  
On our passions killing floor  
In my arms you wont sleep safely  
And of lust we are reborn  
On our passions killing floor  
  
At the first kiss  
the seeds of hatred are sown  
Back into darkness we flee  
To tear our hearts out  
We are saved where all faiths fail  
Alive inside of our tomb  
  
My hearts a graveyard baby  
And to evil we make love  
On our passions killing floor  
In my arms you wont sleep safely  
And of lust we are reborn  
On our passions killing floor  
  
My hearts a graveyard baby  
And to evil we make love  
On our passions killing floor  
In my arms you wont sleep safely  
And of lust we are reborn  
On our passions killing floor  
  
My hearts a graveyard baby  
My hearts a graveyard baby  
On our passions killing floor  
  
In my arms you wont sleep safely  
And to evil we make love  
On our passions killing floor  
  
Forever more
