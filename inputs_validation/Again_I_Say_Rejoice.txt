Rejoice in the Lord always  
And again I say again I say  
Rejoice in the Lord always  
And again I say again I say  
Rejoice  
  
Come bless the Lord come  
Bless the Lord  
Draw near to worship  
Christ the Lord  
And bless His name  
His holy name  
Declaring He is good  
  
O that men would praise Him  
O that men would praise Him  
  
O that men would praise  
His name  
Praise His name  
To the ends of the earth
