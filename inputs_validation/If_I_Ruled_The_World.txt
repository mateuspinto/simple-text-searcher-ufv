If I ruled the world  
Every day would be  
The first day of Spring  
Every heart would have  
A new song to sing  
And wed sing of the joy  
Every morning would bring  
  
If I ruled the world  
Every man would be  
As free as a bird  
Every voice would be  
A voice to be heard  
Take my word  
We would treasure each day  
That occurred  
  
My world would be  
A beautiful place  
Where we would weave  
Such a wonderful dream  
My world would wear  
A smile on its face  
Like the man in the moon  
When the moon beams  
  
If I ruled the world  
Every man would say  
The world was his friend  
Thered be happiness  
That no man could end  
No my friend  
Not if I ruled the world  
Every head  
Would be held up high  
Thered be sunshine  
In everyones sky  
If day ever dawned  
When I ruled the world  
If I ruled the world
