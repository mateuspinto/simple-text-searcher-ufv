Saturday night I was downtown  
Working for the FBI  
Sitting in a nest of bad men  
Whiskey bottles piling high  
  
Bootlegging boozer on the west side  
Full of people who are doing wrong  
Just about to call up the DA man  
When I heard this woman singing a song  
  
A pair of moneybags made me open my eyes  
My temperature started to rise  
  
She was a long cool woman in a black dress  
Just a 59 beautiful n tall  
Just one look I was a bad mess  
Cause that long cool woman had it all  
  
I saw her heading to the table  
Well a tall walking big black cat  
Charlie said I hope that youre able boy  
Cause Im telling you she knows where its at  
  
Suddenly we hear the sirens  
Everybody started to run  
Jumping under doors and tables  
Well I heard somebody shooting a gun  
  
Well the DA was pumping my left hand  
She was holding my right  
Well I told her Dont get scared  
Cause youre gonna be spared  
Im gonna be forgiven if I wanna spend my living  
  
With a long cool woman in a black dress  
Just a 59 beautiful n tall  
Just one look I was a bad mess  
Cause that long cool woman had it all  
She had it all she had it all she had it all  
She had it all  
  
You got it all you got it all you got it all  
You got it all got it all got it all got it all  
Pretty long cool woman had it all
