At first we three thought  
Twas the biblical cord of life  
Then noticing twas connected to his head  
  
How strange not to believed  
I reached out to feel and the ponys eyes opened  
The cord got hard the head looked around  
And you know who pushed and gushed  
The waters of life  
First two hooved feet then the shine of his fur  
  
But at first to my eyes only  
Feather  feathers  wings  
The butterflies flew up in such colors  
Exploding all around us  
  
The rest I did not see  till there he stood  all eyes in wonder  
  
Who me  who you  
  
Look
