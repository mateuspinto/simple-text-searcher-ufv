Jill came tumbling down  
At the bottom of the hill  
Jack busted his crown  
Ah my fairytale love story  
My fairy life  
My fairytale love story  
To get you off of my  
I got to thinking  
Things arent as good as they can be  
I got to drinking  
The bitch is over the brink  
The bitch is over the brink  
Tommy Prince kissed a few there on the lips  
She woke him with a cold sore she aint so pretty no more  
Ah my fairytale love story  
My fairy life  
My fairytale love story  
To get you off of my  
I got to thinking  
Im not as sweet as them all  
I got to drinking again  
The bitch is over the brink  
The bitch is over the brink  
My fairytale love story  
Ooo My fairytale love story  
Yeah youre my fairytale love story  
Ooo my fairytale love story  
The bitch is over the brink  
The bitch is over the brink  
Rapunzel let down your hair Ill cut it off
