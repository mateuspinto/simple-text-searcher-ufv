He built this wall around himself  
Many years ago  
To protect himself from being hurt again  
But he couldn t stop his feelings  
Last night yeah  
When he saw the young lady in the bar  
Blonde hair blue eyes  
Waited till the band played the last song  
And took her home  
His mother didn t like her  
His father didn t like her  
The only thing that kept them  
Going was knowing that  
Love would conquer all  
  
Chorus  
They were lovers  
In a dangerous time  
  
They ran away to another country  
Cause they thought things would be  
Better for them out there  
In the month of December  
They got married in Chicago  
And it was all the same  
Everywhere they went  
Heads would turn  
  
Chorus till fade
