Refrain  
Lift high the cross  
The love of Christ proclaim  
Till all the world  
Adore His sacred name  
  
Led on their way  
By this triumphant sign  
The hosts of God  
In conquering ranks combine  
  
Refrain  
Lift high the cross  
The love of Christ proclaim  
Till all the world  
Adore His sacred name  
  
Each newborn servant  
Of the Crucified  
Bears on the brow  
The seal of Him who died  
  
Refrain  
Lift high the cross  
The love of Christ proclaim  
Till all the world  
Adore His sacred name  
  
O Lord once lifted  
On the glorious tree  
As Thou hast promised  
Draw the world to Thee  
  
Refrain  
Lift high the cross  
The love of Christ proclaim  
Till all the world  
Adore His sacred name  
  
So shall our song  
Of triumph ever be  
Praise to the Crucified  
For victory  
  
Refrain  
Lift high the cross  
The love of Christ proclaim  
Till all the world  
Adore His sacred name
