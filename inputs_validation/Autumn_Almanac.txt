From the dewsoaked hedge creeps a crawly caterpillar  
When the dawn begins to crack  
Its all part of my autumn almanac  
Breeze blows leaves of a mustycoloured yellow  
So I sweep them in my sack  
Yes yes yes its my autumn almanac  
  
Friday evenings people get together  
Hiding from the weather  
Tea and toasted buttered currant buns  
Cant compensate for lack of sun  
Because the summers all gone  
  
Lalalala  
Oh my poor rheumatic back  
Yes yes yes its my autumn almanac  
Lalalala  
Oh my autumn almanac  
Yes yes yes its my autumn almanac  
  
I like my football on a Saturday  
Roast beef on Sundays all right  
I go to Blackpool for my holidays  
Sit in the open sunlight  
  
This is my street and Im never gonna to leave it  
And Im always gonna to stay here  
If I live to be ninetynine  
Cause all the people I meet  
Seem to come from my street  
And I cant get away  
Because its calling me come on home  
Hear it calling me come on home  
  
Lalalala  
Oh my autumn Armagnac  
Yes yes yes its my autumn almanac  
Lalalala  
Oh my autumn almanac  
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
