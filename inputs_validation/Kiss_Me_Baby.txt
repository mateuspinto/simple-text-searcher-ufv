Please dont let me argue anymore  
I wont make you worry like before  
Cant remember what we fought about  
Late late last night we said it was over  
But i remember when we thought it out  
We both had a broken heart  
Woah baby  
kiss me baby  
Woah baby  
love to only  
Woah baby  
kiss me baby  
Woah baby  
love to only  
As i drove away i felt a tear  
It hit me i was losing someone dear  
Told my folks i would be alright  
Tossed and i turned my head was so heavy  
Then i wondered as it got light  
Were you still awake like me  
Woah baby  
kiss me baby  
Woah baby  
love to only  
Woah baby  
kiss me baby  
Woah baby  
love to only  
Time  
Woah baby  
kiss me baby  
Woah baby  
love to only  
Woah baby  
kiss me baby  
Woah baby  
love to only  
Woah baby  
kiss me baby  
Woah baby  
love to only
