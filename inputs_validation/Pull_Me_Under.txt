Lost in the sky  
Clouds roll by and I roll with them  
Arrows fly  
Seas increase and then fall again  
  
This world is spinning around me  
This world is spinning without me and  
Every day sends future to past  
Every breath leaves me one less to my last  
  
Watch the sparrow falling  
Gives new meaning to it all  
If not today nor yet tomorrow then some other day  
  
Ill take seven lives for one  
And then my only fathers son  
As sure as I did ever love him I am not afraid  
  
This world is spinning around me  
The whole world keeps spinning around me and  
All life is future to past  
Every breath leaves me one less to my last  
  
Pull me under  
Pull me under  
Pull me under Im not afraid  
All that I feel is honor and spite  
All I can do is to set it right  
  
Dust fills my eyes  
Clouds roll by and I roll with them  
Centuries cry  
Orders fly and I fall again  
  
This world is spinning inside me  
The whole world is spinning inside me  
Every day sends future to past  
Every step brings me closer to my last  
  
Pull me under  
Pull me under  
Pull me under Im not afraid  
Living my life too much in the sun  
Only until your will is done  
  
  
Pull me under  
Pull me under  
Pull me under Im not afraid  
All that I feel is honor and spite  
All I can do is to set it right  
Pull me under  
Pull me under  
Pull me under Im not afraid  
Living my life too much in the sun  
Only until your will is done  
  
Oh that this too  
Too solid flesh  
Would melt
