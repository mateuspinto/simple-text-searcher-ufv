Down by the bay  
Where the watermelons grow  
Back to my home  
I dare not go  
For if I do  
My mother will say  
Did you ever see a bear  
Combing his hair   
Down by the bay  
  
Down by the bay  
Where the watermelons grow  
Back to my home  
I dare not go  
For if I do  
My mother will say  
Did you ever see a bee  
With a sunburned knee   
Down by the bay  
  
Down by the bay  
Where the watermelons grow  
Back to my home  
I dare not go  
For if I do  
My mother will say  
Did you ever see a moose  
Kissing a goose   
Down by the bay  
  
Down by the bay  
Where the watermelons grow  
Back to my home  
I dare not go  
For if I do  
My mother will say  
Did you ever see a whale  
With a polka dot tail   
Down by the bay
