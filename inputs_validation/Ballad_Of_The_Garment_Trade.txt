If you dont want to get nervous  
Do yourself a great big service  
Stay away please far from seventh avenue  
You can lose your sense and reason  
Guessing what style for next season  
Yes the dress business will make a wreck of you  
Its a battle of fierce and grim  
That depends on the ladies whim  
Whatll miss and misses americas answer be  
Will she say with a tossing head  
And that rare guy wouldnt drop dead  
Or shell say  yes this dress is really me  
On guessing what a day will say  
A sheer impossibility  
This poor kids brave he worked away  
And try to build that industry  
How crazy bold and reckless  
Can human beings be  
Hip hip hooray for the garment trade  
Hear the cheer to push the music hits us everyone  
Day after daythey go on this way  
To the cockeyed way the job that must be done  
Off to the fray on the brave crusade  
Gallant ladies garment trade  
Though in health got speed  
In a gesture breed made all answers on parade  
What a business what a sack game  
Yet its about as much your business is a crap game  
Snapper zipper bowler button  
All we know is what the experts know from nothin  
So the last line you got pie with  
Coming right up is another you could die with  
If youre right the dough could flow in  
If youre not you havent got a pot to sew with  
Off to the fray on the brave crusade  
Gallant ladies garment trade  
Though in health got speed  
In a gesture breed made all answers on parade  
Off to the fray on the brave crusade  
Gallant ladies garment trade  
Though in health got speed  
In a gesture breed made all answers on parade
