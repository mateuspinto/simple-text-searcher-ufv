Her heart shivers in my hand  
Shes melting on me like cotton candy  
I make the faces that make you cry  
I want you more when afraid of my  
Disease disease is draining me  
Anymore your not so pretty please  
Disease disease is draining me  
I want you more when your afraid of me  
I will break you inside out you are mine you are mine  
I will break you inside out you are mine you are mine  
Her hair hangs in swollen strings  
Im choking on her it feels so  
Sickening  
I make the faces that make you cry  
I want more when your afraid of my  
Disease disease is draining me  
I want you more when your afraid of  
Me
