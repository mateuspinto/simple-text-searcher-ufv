Two dozen roses  
A question that poses  
As someone whos calling your name  
Listen the loner  
The man on the corner  
Is singing you songs at the end of the day  
  
Lady be good lady be kind  
Lately the things that cross my mind  
Are somehow the same  
Links in a chain  
Oh lady my love  
Lady I run lady I fly  
To come to your door and open wide  
Ill wait for you there forever I swear  
My lady my love  
  
He gulps and he chances it  
Dances his way cross the floor  
To the place where you stand  
Hes walking hes flying  
The poor boy is trying to be by your side  
When the waltzing begins  
  
Lady be good lady be kind  
Lately the things that cross my mind  
Are somehow the same  
Links in a chain  
Oh lady my love  
Lady I run lady I fly  
To come to your door and open wide  
Ill wait for you there forever I swear  
My lady my love  
  
Lady be good lady be kind  
Lately the things that cross my mind  
Are somehow the same  
Links in a chain  
Oh lady my love  
Lady I run lady I fly  
To come to your door and open wide  
Ill wait for you there forever I swear  
My lady my love  
My lady my love  
My lady my love
