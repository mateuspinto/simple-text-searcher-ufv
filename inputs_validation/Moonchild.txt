Call her moonchild  
Dancing in the shallows of a river  
Lonely moonchild  
Dreaming in the shadow  
Of the willow  
  
Talking to the trees of the  
Cobweb strange  
Sleeping on the steps of a fountain  
Waving silver wands to the  
Nightbirds song  
Waiting for the sun on the mountain  
  
Shes a moonchild  
Gathering the flowers in a garden  
Lovely moonchild  
Drifting on the echoes of the hours  
  
Sailing on the wind  
In a milk white gown  
Dropping circle stones on a sun dial  
Playing hide and seek  
With the ghosts of dawn  
Waiting for a smile from a sun child
