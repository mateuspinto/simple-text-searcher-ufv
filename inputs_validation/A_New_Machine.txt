I have always been here  
I have always looked out from behind these eyes  
It feels like more than a lifetime  
Feels like more than a lifetime  
  
Sometimes I get tired of the waiting  
Sometimes I get tired of being in here  
Is this the way it has always been  
Could it ever have been different  
  
Do you ever get tired of the waiting  
Do you ever get tired of being in there  
Dont worry nobody lives forever  
Nobody lives forever
