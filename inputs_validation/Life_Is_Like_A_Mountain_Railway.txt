Life is like a mountain railway  
With an engineer thats brave  
We must make this run successful  
From the cradle to the grave  
Heed the curves and watch the tunnels  
Never falter never fail  
Keep your hands upon the throttle  
And your eye upon the rail  
Blessed Saviour there to guide us  
Till we reach that blissful shore  
And the angels there to join us  
In Gods grace forevermore  
As you roll across the trestle  
Spanning Jordans swelling tide  
You will reach the Union Depot  
Into which your train will ride  
There youll meet the superintendent  
God the father God the son  
With a happy joyous greeting  
Weary pilgrim welcome home  
Blessed Saviour there to guide us  
Till we reach that blissful shore  
And the angels there to join us  
In Gods grace forevermore  
In Gods grace forevermore
