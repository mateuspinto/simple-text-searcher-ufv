Haha look at that girl  
Woman  
  
Not enough never too much  
The woman look just like love  
Rolling stone gathers no moss  
But leave a trail of busted stuff  
  
I know shes gonna leave my broken heart behind her  
I take what shes giving up  
I know shes gonna leave this broken man behind her  
I take what shes giving up  
  
Sweet sugar lips push from the hips  
Woman looks just like love  
Without a care she floats above  
She got me down here looking up  
  
I know shes gonna leave my broken heart behind her  
I take what shes giving up  
I know shes gonna leave my broken heart behind  
Yeah yeah  
  
She me one  
She my one  
She my one  
Little love  
When she move  
She move so cool  
She make me feel just like a fool  
But inside where the devil hides  
Women looks just like love  
  
I know shes gonna leave my broken heart behind  
I take what shes giving up oh  
I know shes gonna leave my broken heart behind her now  
I get what shes giving up oh  
  
I know shes gonna leave her broken man behind  
Hey yeah  
  
She my one  
She my one  
She the one for me  
Yeah  
  
I know shes gonna leave my broken heart behind  
Yeah yeah  
  
She my one
