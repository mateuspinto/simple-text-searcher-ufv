I was born in a house with the television always on  
Guess I grew up too fast  
And I forgot my name  
Were in cities at night and we got time on our hands  
So leave the driving to us  
And its the real thing  
  
And youre rolling  
In the blender  
With me  
And I can love you  
Like a color  
TV  
  
Now love is here  
Cmon and try it  
I got love for sale  
Got love for sale  
And now love is here  
Cmon and try it  
Got love for sale  
Got love for sale  
  
You can put your lipstick all over my designer jeans  
Ill be a video for you  
If you turn my dial  
You can cash my check if you go down to the bank  
You get two for one  
For a limited time  
  
Push my button  
The toast pops up  
Love and money  
Gettin all  
Mixed up  
And now love is here  
Cmon and try it  
I got love for sale  
Got love for sale  
  
Love is here  
Cmon and try it  
I got love for sale  
I got Love  
Love  
Love  
Love  
Love  
Love  
Love  
Love
