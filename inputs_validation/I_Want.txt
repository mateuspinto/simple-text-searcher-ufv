I want to  
I want you to trust me  
I want you to believe me  
I want to feel your eyes  
I want to control every heartbeat  
I want to hear your voices  
I want to disturb the peace  
I want you to see me well  
I want you to understand me  
I want your fantasy  
I want your energy  
I want to see your hands  
I want to go down in applause  
Do you see me  
Do you understand me  
Do you feel me  
Do you hear me  
Can you hear me  
We hear you  
Can you see me  
We see you  
Can you feel me  
We feel you  
I dont understand you  
I want  
We want you to trust us  
We want you to believe everything from us  
We want to see your hands  
We want to go down in applause  yeah  
Can you hear me  
We hear you  
Can you see me  
We see you  
Can you feel me  
We feel you  
I dont understand you  
Can you hear us  
We hear you  
Can you see us  
We see you  
Can you feel us  
We feel you  
We dont understand you
