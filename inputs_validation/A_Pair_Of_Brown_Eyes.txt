One summer evening drunk to hell  
I sat there nearly lifeless  
An old man in the corner sang  
Where the water lilies grow  
And on the jukebox johnny sang  
About a thing called love  
And its how are you kid and whats your name  
And how would you bloody know  
In blood and death neath a screaming sky  
I lay down on the ground  
And the arms and legs of other men  
Were scattered all around  
Some cursed some prayed some prayed then cursed  
Then prayed and bled some more  
And the only thing that I could see  
Was a pair of brown eyes that was looking at me  
But when we got back labeled parts one to three  
There was no pair of brown eyes waiting for me  
  
And a rovin a rovin a rovin Ill go  
For a pair of brown eyes  
  
I looked at him he looked at me  
All I could do was hate him  
While ray and philomena sang  
Of my elusive dream  
I saw the streams the rolling hills  
Where his brown eyes were waiting  
And I thought about a pair of brown eyes  
That waited once for me  
So drunk to hell I left the place  
Sometimes crawling sometimes walking  
A hungry sound came across the breeze  
So I gave the walls a talking  
And I heard the sounds of long ago  
From the old canal  
And the birds were whistling in the trees  
Where the wind was gently laughing  
  
And a rovin a rovin a rovin Ill go  
For a pair of brown eyes
