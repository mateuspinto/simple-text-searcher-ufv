Theres something that sounds like a song  
In my garden by the willow  
A piper  
Oohoo ahoo oohoo ahoo oohoo ahoo hoooo  
I see him when I turn the lights down low  
In my garden wading through the pond  
Dressed in sailing wear  
Oohoo ahoo oohoo ahoo oohoo ahoo hoooo  
Ive called him by every name I know  
By every name I know  
But he wont answer me  
He keeps coming forward but never moving  
Is there no destiny here  
It sounds like a song  
In my garden by the willow  
A piper  
Oohoo ahoo oohoo ahoo oohoo ahoo hoooo
