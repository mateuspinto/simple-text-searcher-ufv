Moses come ridin up on a quasar  
His spurs were jingling the door was ajar  
His buckle was silver his manner was bold  
And I asked him to come in out of the cold  
  
His brain was boiling his reason was spent  
His motto is nothing is borrowed nothing is lent  
He ask me for mercy I gave him a gun  
He said these things just got to be done  
  
Abraham and Isaac sitting on a fence  
Youd get right to work if you had any sense  
You know the one thing we need is a lefthand monkey wrench  
  
Gideon come up with his eyes on the floor  
Said you aint got a hinge you cant close the door  
Moses stood up above his six foot and ten  
Said you cant close the door when the walls caved in  
  
Ask him for water he poured me some wine  
We finished the bottle and broke into mine  
You get what you come for ya ready to go  
Well its one in ten thousand that come for the show  
  
Abraham and Isaac diggin on a well  
Mama came quick with the water witch spell  
Well cool clear water well you cant ever tell  
  
Abraham and Isaac sitting on a fence  
Youd get right to work if you had any sense  
You know the one thing we need is a lefthand monkey wrench
