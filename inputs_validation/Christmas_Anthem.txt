Hear what glorious song of angels  
Is now ringing through the air  
Never valley never mountain  
Heard an anthem half so fair  
  
Refrain  
Hallelujah hallelujah  
Is the jubilant refrain  
God is sending us a Savior  
Peace on earth good will to man  
  
Messengers of Gods free mercy  
Are now seen by human eye  
Shepherds hear the wondrous message  
Glory be to God on high  
  
Refrain  
Hallelujah hallelujah  
Is the jubilant refrain  
God is sending us a Savior  
Peace on earth good will to man  
  
Let us also sing the praises  
Of our God so full of love  
Who on Christmas sent a Savior  
Sent a Savior from above  
  
Refrain  
Hallelujah hallelujah  
Is the jubilant refrain  
God is sending us a Savior  
Peace on earth good will to man
