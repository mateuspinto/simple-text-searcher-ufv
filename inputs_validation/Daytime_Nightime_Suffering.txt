What does she get for all the love she gave you  
There on the ladder of regrets  
Mighty river give her all she gets  
What does she get for all the love she gave you  
There on the ladder of regrets  
Daytime nightime suffering is all she gets  
  
Where all the prizes for the games she entered  
With little chance of much success  
Daytime nightime suffering is all she gets  
  
Come on river all the flow  
Let your love of you people show  
Come on river flow through me  
Let your love of you people be  
You are the river I am the stream  
Flow mighty river through me  
  
What does it pay to play the leading lady  
When the like the damsel in distress  
Daytime nightime suffering is all she gets  
  
No less no less no more no more  
No sea no sea no shore no shore  
No sand no sand no pail no pail  
No fairy tale anymore  
  
Come on river flow through me  
Dont be stopped by insanity  
Come on river overflow  
Let your love for your neighbours show  
You are the river I am the stream  
Flget it  
But if we forget it every now and then  
But if you dont feel it later on youll regret it  
And if we let it we could set it free you and me
