Somewhere in the city  
Theres a struggle going on  
Someones making money  
Someones doing wrong  
Everybody searching for a little piece of gold  
power play fix a face  never grow old  
Its a shame  
Whos gonna take control  
Its a game they play  
Whos gonna save your soul  
And theyre never gonna stop  
Till they reach the top  
All across the nation  
Fever takes control  
Money is temptation  
Money saves your soul  
One thing I can tell you  
Of this there is no doubt  
The rich man needs his comfort  
And the poor man does without  
Everybody loves somebody  
All around the world  
But everybody knows  
Its the rich man gets the girl  
chorus  
Look at all the little people  
cowering  from the rain  
Standing at the bus stop  
Dreaming bout spain  
Here comes the rich man  
Driving his car  
When he was poor he was sure  
He was gonna go far  
repeat chorus to fade
