Take it you can have it  
What I got baby I cant hold  
If you find the secret  
Tell me how to build the mold  
And I cant handle your problems  
Dont try to handle mine  
Get yourself a shotgun a pocketful of shells  
While away the time  
Get it right do it nice  
If you make a mistake pay for it twice  
But if you need it got to have it  
Get yourself a shotgun and bring it back home  
Look up the wall you know you gotta call  
Before you start calling be ready to fall  
And if you fall in my direction  
Dont expect no help at all  
Get it right do it nice  
If you make a mistake pay for it twice  
And if you need it got to have it  
Get yourself a shotgun and bring it back home  
Look up the wall you know you gotta call  
Before you start calling be ready to fall  
And if you fall in my direction  
Dont expect no help at all  
Dont expect no help at all  
Dont expect no help at all  
And if you fall in my direction  
Dont expect no help at all
