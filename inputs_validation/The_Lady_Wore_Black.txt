On a lonely walk this morning  
A light mist in the air  
Dark clouds laughing at me in silence  
Casting shadows through my hair  
  
In the distance I saw a woman  
Dressed in black with eyes of grey  
She wore her pain like a shackled spirit  
Eternal life was her debt to pay  
  
The lady wore black  
Its the sign of the prisoners lives  
The lady wore black  
See the years through the tears in her eyes  
The lady wore black  
Her mystic power calls to me  
The lady wore black  
Her love can set me free  
  
The wind song whispered a warning  
Telling me to beware  
Of the quiet shadowed woman  
And of the sadness I would share  
  
We sat together for sometime together in silence  
Never speaking in words  
Of all her thoughts she spoke with her eyes  
And I listened remembering all I heard  
  
The lady wore black  
Its the sign of the prisoners lives  
The lady wore black  
See the years through the tears in her eyes  
The lady wore black  
Her mystic power calls to me  
The lady wore black  
Her love can set me free  
  
The words she spoke were of forgotten lives  
And of all knowledge gained  
Memories I had and didnt know why  
With a smile she explained  
I should have listened to the winds cold warning  
And walked the other way  
I touched her soul and now I bear her sentence  
But for her love Ill gladly pay  
  
The lady wore black  
Its the sign of the prisoners lives  
The lady wore black  
See the years through the tears in her eyes  
The lady wore black  
Her mystic power calls to me  
The lady wore black  
Her love can set me free
