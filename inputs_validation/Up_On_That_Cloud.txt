Its so easy to fall in love with you  
I know I did for a day or two  
You never noticed lost in your crowd  
Just no room for me up on that cloud  
  
Cant find no changes  
For better in my luck  
Empty are my eyes and my heart  
Cold grey days  
The nights are so long  
My heart is sinking  
Bound to a stone  
  
This old world is a bag of tricks  
A whole lot of nothin  
Where nothin ever fits  
In all her glory she just dont compare  
To one single tear  
In your beautiful eyes  
  
Thank you December  
For your cold grey air  
Lakes are frozen trees are bare  
I once loved her  
Of that I am proud  
Just no room for me  
Up on that cloud
