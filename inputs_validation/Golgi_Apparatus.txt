I look into the finance box  
Just to check my status  
I look into the microscope  
See Golgi Apparatus  
  
Golgi oh woe is me  
You cant even see the sea  
Golgi olgi oh ooo olgi  
Golgi  
Golgi  
  
They call him Lysasome  
Cause he runs so fast  
Runs like a junkyard dog  
With a brain of brass  
  
I saw you  
With a ticket stub in your hand  
Under the light  
Middle of the night  
Couldnt get it wrong  
So I had to
