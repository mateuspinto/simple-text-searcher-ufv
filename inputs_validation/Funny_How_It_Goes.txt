Like trying to knock down pins with marbles in my hand  
She wouldnt take a hi from me the average man  
Funny what money can do to people  
But she had a light that had sparked up her evil  
Trying to chat up women who rate themselves so high  
Shouldnt be my subject but I felt like I should try  
Funny what drink can do for soldiers  
Well she must into men a little bit older  
  
Funny how it goes how money steals the show  
And all her diamonds twinkle as she dances and whats it got for me  
Hung over in my tree  
I saw the sun shine bright in front of  
  
Trying to get her dancing was not an easy job  
She made out like Houdini when I said do you bop  
Funny what rhythm does it kills me  
Like champagne women only seem to spill me  
Trying to get the picture I settled down to a drink  
When up came Cinderella so what was I to think  
Funny how these shoes fit a dragon  
Well shes like the sharks that you get in Manhattan  
  
Funny how it goes how money steals the show  
And all her diamonds twinkle as she dances and whats it got for me  
Hung over in my tree  
I saw the sun shine bright in front of
