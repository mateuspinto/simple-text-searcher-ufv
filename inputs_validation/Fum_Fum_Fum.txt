On this joyful Christmas Day  
Sing fum fum fum  
On this joyful Christmas Day  
Sing fum fum fum  
For a blessed Babe was born  
Upon this day at the break of morn  
In a manger poor and lowly  
Lay the Son of God most holy  
Fum Fum Fum  
  
Thanks to God for holidays  
Sing fum fum fum  
Now we all our voices raise  
And sing a song of grateful praise  
Celebrate in song and story  
All the wonders of His glory  
Fum fum fum
