Only my soul stops me crying  
Wondering why I feel alone  
And only my love keeps me from  
Weeping so bad  
Giving me strength to carry on  
  
Lead me on thro restless waters  
Walk with me along the way  
Live the moment and tomorrow  
For the Lord will take it all  
On judgment day  
  
Broken dreams lay all around me  
Sad eyed children of despair  
Whispered voices in the distance  
Call me on to who knows where  
  
Lead me on thro restless waters  
Walk with me along the way  
Live the moment and tomorrow  
Cause the Lord will take it all on judgment day  
And the Lord will take it all on judgement day  
  
Hear me crying out for love  
Hear me crying out for love  
Ill never let you know it  
I can only show it in my song  
  
Only my soul  
  
Hear me crying out for love  
Hear me crying out for love  
Ill never let you know it  
I can only show it in my song  
Only my soul
