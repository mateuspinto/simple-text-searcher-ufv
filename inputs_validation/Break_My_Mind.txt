Baby oh baby  
Tell the man at the ticket stand that youve changed your mind  
Well let me run on out and tell the cab to keep his meter flying  
Cause if you say goodbye to me babe youre gonna break my mind  
  
Break my mind  
Break my mind  
Well I just cant stand to hear the big jet engines whine  
Break my mind  
Break my mind oh lord  
Well if you leave youre gonna leave a babbling fool behind  
  
Baby oh baby  
Well let me take your suitcase off of that scale in time  
Just tell the man that you suddenly developed a thing about high flying  
Cause if you say goodbye to me you know youre gonna break my mind  
  
Break my mind  
Break my mind  
Well I just cant stand to hear the big jet engines whine  
Break my mind  
Break my mind oh lord  
Well if you leave youre gonna leave a babbling fool behind  
  
Break my mind  
Break my mind  
Well I just cant stand to hear the big jet engines whine  
Break my mind  
Break my mind oh lord  
Well if you leave youre gonna leave a babbling fool behind  
Well if you leave youre gonna leave a babbling fool behind
