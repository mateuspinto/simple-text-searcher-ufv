He was my best friend I tried to help him  
But he traded everything for suffering  
And found himself alone  
I watched the lying turn into hiding  
With scars on both his lips his fingertips  
Were melted to the bone  
  
Chorus  
But I can still remember what his face looked like  
When I found him in an alley in the middle of the night  
Tell me what you know Tell me what you gone and done now  
Tell me what you know Tell me what you gone and done now  
Gun would do the trick get it over with  
Youre better off  
To take all youve got and burn it on the spot  
Just to get highhigh  
  
Three days no sleeping he gave up eating  
He sold his mothers rings she said nothing  
And pretended not to know  
He started stealing to supply the feeling  
Found out he pulled a knife on someones wife  
And held it to her throat  
  
Chorus  
  
Tell me what did where you gone and hid  
Show me  
What you really want was it what you got  
Slowly  
Circle in the drain throw it all away  
Just to get high high  
High oh  
  
High high  
High  
High high  
High  
  
Tell me what you know Tell me what you gone and done now  
Tell me what you know Tell me what you gone and done now  
Gun would do the trick get it over with  
Youre better off  
To take all that youve got and burn it on the spot  
Just to get high high  
Tell me what did where you gone and hid  
Show me  
What you really want was it what you got  
Slowly  
Circle in the drain throw it all away  
Just to get high  
Just to get high  
Circle in the drain throw it all away  
Just to get high
