Whoa Hey hey  
Oh what a ride  
What a perfect sky to frame  
Your hazel eyes  
Id scream on the inside  
But right now it feels like Ive  
Been tranquilized  
Oh what a fool am I  
To be tonguetied  
Sitting next to her  
The princess and the passenger  
  
You touch the rain and suddenly  
Theres waterfalls  
Now every day is something more  
Worth fighting for  
  
Chorus  
  
Baby you make the sun shine down  
You make the sun shine down  
You can paint the darkest clouds  
And turn them into rainbows  
You take your secret smile  
The one that turns me on  
Hey girl youve been what Ive waited for  
  
Feet back on the pavement to the  
Basement  
On the bright side of the road  
Fumbling my lines to a lazy cat  
On the step outside her door  
She opens up  
And Im in the Polaroid  
Standing next to her  
The princess and the passenger  
  
Touching the rain and suddenly  
Theres waterfalls  
Now every day is something more  
Worth living for  
  
Chorus x2  
  
On a day like this when the world  
Is elevated  
On a day like this when I know just  
Why I waited  
On a day like this when the world  
Is elevated  
On a day like this when I know just  
Why I waited
