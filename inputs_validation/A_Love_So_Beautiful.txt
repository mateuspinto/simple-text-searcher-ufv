The summer sun went down on  
Our love long ago  
But in my heart I feel the same  
Old afterglow  
  
A love so beautiful  
In every way  
A love so beautiful  
We let it slip away  
We were too young to understand  
To ever know  
That lovers drift apart  
And thats the way love goes  
  
A love so beautiful  
A love so free  
A love so beautiful  
A love for you and me  
And when I think of you  
I fall in love again  
A love so beautiful  
In every way  
A love so beautiful  
We let it slip away  
  
And when I think of you  
I fall in love again  
  
A love so beautiful  
We let it slip away  
A love so beautiful  
In every way  
A love so beautiful  
We let it slip away
