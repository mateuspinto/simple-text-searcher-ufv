All the sailors with their seasick mamas  
Hear the sirens on the shore  
Singin songs for pimps with tailors  
Who charge ten dollars at the door  
  
You can really learn a lot that way  
It will change you in the middle of the day  
Though your confidence may be shattered  
It doesnt matter  
  
All the great explorers  
Are now in granite laid in Granite Lake  
Under white sheets for the great unveiling  
At the big parade  
  
You can really learn a lot that way  
It will change you in the middle of the day  
Though your confidence may be shattered  
It doesnt matter  
  
All the bush league batters  
Are left to die on the diamond  
In the stands the home crowd scatters  
For the turnstiles  
For the turnstiles  
For the turnstiles
