Here I am sitting on my porch  
Thinkin my life has got to be beyond reproach  
Have I forgot some friends close to me  
Real ones that dont use me  
And does my woman love me now  
Like she loved me then  
Here I ammy defenses are down  
Will she remember me when Im not around  
Will she still dream by me  
Or will she find a new life  
Will I ever get used to being alone at night  
Ill never know but would it do me any good if I did  
Life is a strange brew maybe we should not lift the lid  
Lift the lid  
Ill never know but would it do me any good if I did  
Life is a strange brew maybe we should not lift the lid  
Lift the lid
