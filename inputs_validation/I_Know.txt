 I Know I know oh yes I know   
I know what it means  
To be lost in the dark  
I know what it means  
To be tossed by the storm  
I have walked alone  
With a heart of stone  
And despair too heavy for tears  
But you caught my heart  
And you taught my heart  
To forget its doubts and fear  
And now that I know  
The joy of your love  
My head is high I can face the sky  
And know that heaven is here below  
I know     
For you I could die  
For you I will live  
I know  
 I Know I know I know
