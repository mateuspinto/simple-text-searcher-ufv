Happiest girl I ever knew  
Happiest girl I ever knew  
  
Wanted to feel the joy  
Flow between our lips  
Wanted to feel the joy  
Flow between our hips  
  
Happiest girl I ever knew  
Why do you smile the smile you do  
  
Happiest girl I ever knew  
Wanted to feel the joy  
Pass between our eyes  
Wanted to feel the joy  
Pass between our thighs  
  
And I would have to pinch her  
Just to see if she was real  
Just to watch the smile fade away  
And see the pain shed feel  
  
Wanted to feel her joy  
Feel it deep within  
Wanted to feel her joy  
Penetrate my skin  
  
Happiest girl I ever knew  
Why do you smile the smile you do
