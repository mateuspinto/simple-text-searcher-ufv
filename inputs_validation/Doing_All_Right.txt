Yesterday my life was in ruin  
Now today I know what Im doing  
Got a feeling I should be doing all right  
Doing all right  
  
Where will I be this time tomorrow  
Jumped in joy or sinking in sorrow  
Anyway I should be doing all right  
Doing all right  
  
Should be waiting for the sun  
Looking round to find the words to say  
Should be waiting for the skies to clear  
There aint time in all the world  
  
Should be waiting for the sun  
And anyway Ive got to hide away  
  
Yesterday my life was in ruin  
Now today God knows what Im doing  
Anyway I should be doing all right  
Doing all right  
  
Doing all right
