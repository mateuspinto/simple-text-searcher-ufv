I laughed at sweethearts  
I met at schools  
All indiscreet hearts  
Seemed romantic fools  
A house in Iceland  
Was my hearts domain  
I saw your eyes  
Now castles rise in Spain  
  
I took one look at you  
Thats all I meant to do  
And then my heart stood still  
My feet could step and walk  
My lips could move and talk  
And yet my heart stood still  
  
Though not a single word was spoken  
I could tell you knew  
That unfelt clasp of hands  
Told me so well you knew  
I never lived at all  
Until the thrill of that moment when  
My heart stood still  
  
Though not a single word was spoken  
I could tell you knew  
That unfelt clasp of hands  
Told me so well you knew  
I never lived at all  
Until the thrill of that moment when  
My heart stood still  
All that moment when  
My heart stood still  
My heart stood still  
My heart stood still
