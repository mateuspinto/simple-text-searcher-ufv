Oh Rah  
  
Father almighty turn the darkness to day  
Father providing turning desert to grain  
Gods son the pharaoh speaks to Rah calling his name  
Oh rah devour those who dare open my grave  
Place a curse in his hand  
  
The mummys hand  
The mummys hand  
  
My tomb so mighty scorns the world as time slips away  
Thieves hunt for bounty through the stone they search for a way  
Treasure inviting to my lair where hell awaits  
Rotting this body steals the souls of those who betray  
Place your curse in his hand  
  
The mummys hand  
The mummys hand  
  
Father almighty turn the darkness to day  
Oh Rah devour those who dare open my grave  
Place a curse in his hand  
  
The mummys hand  
The mummys hand  
  
The mummys hand  
The mummys hand  
The mummys hand
