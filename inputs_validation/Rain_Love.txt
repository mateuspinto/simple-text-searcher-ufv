Rain rain love rain rain love  
Rain rain love rain rain love  
Threw out my old raincoat set sail without a boat  
For places somewhere far beyond my dreams  
As the sky came pouring down I lay down on the ground  
Like I was dreaming I let the feeling wash all over me  
Rain love covered around me  
Rain rain love finally found me  
This time youre gonna recognize  
One drop will open up your eyes rain love  
Its the color of every sky its the way to change the tide  
When the world is crumbling down on you and me  
Its the calm that lifts the storm its the promise that keeps you warm  
When you dont understand just touch the guiding hand that comforts me  
Rain love  
Takes this lot to make you realize  
No greater love could ever fill the sky  
Rain love
