I lift my hands to the highest of all  
As I draw near  
Surrender my life to Your promise oh God  
There is no other  
  
I will find my life in You  
Youre always enough  
Always enough  
Let the fullness of Your love  
Be all I need  
All I need  
  
Consume me come like a fire oh God  
Reign in me  
For You alone will satisfy  
There is no other  
If I have You I have everything  
But without You I have nothing
