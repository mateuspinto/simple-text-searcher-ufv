When sunny gets blue  
Her eyes get gray and cloudy  
Then the rain begins to fall  
Pitter patter pitter patter  
Love has gone so what can matter  
No lover man comes to call  
  
When sunny gets blue  
She breathes a sigh of sadness  
Like the wind that stirs the tree  
Wind that sets the leaves to swayin  
Like some violins are playin  
Weird and haunting melody  
  
People used to love to hear her laugh to see her smile  
Thats how she got her name  
Since that sad affair  
Shes lost her smile shes changed her style  
Somehow shes not the same  
But memories will fade and pretty dreams will rise up  
Where her other dreams fell through  
Hurry new love hurry here  
And brush away each falling tear and hold her near  
When sunny gets blue
