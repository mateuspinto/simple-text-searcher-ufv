One more  
Sunday in Savannah  
Hear the whole creation shoutin  
Praise the Lord  
  
See them flinging out the banner  
While the congregation says amen  
Young folk  
Tendin Sunday School  
  
They sing merrilly bout the golden rule  
Horse sense preaching all the day  
They all hollar in the righteous way  
Its time for me to call on Mother Hannah  
  
While she sits there wishing for her last reward  
One more Sunday in Savannah  
One more Sunday in Atlanta  
Its the same thing  
  
Same feeling  
Dont ya dare  
Go fishin son  
Amen
