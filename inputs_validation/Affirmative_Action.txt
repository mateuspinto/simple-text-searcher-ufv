From where I stand  
I can see the world  
Getting smaller and smaller  
And therell be no place  
  
For people like you Georgie  
Who still live in the past  
When you couldnt do things  
For yourself you blamed it on apartheid  
  
Chorus  
You blamed it on the government and everybody  
Now is the time to prove yourself  
If you think affirmative action  
Is the way out no way no way  
  
Constitution can be changed  
From time to time  
But that does not mean that  
You dont need no education  
  
We are tired of people who  
Think that affirmative action is the way out  
And is another way of putting puppets  
  
Where they dont belong  
Im so sorry Georgie  
But the only way to get our economy  
Strong is to have  
An educated nation  
And if you think affirmative action  
Is the way out no way no way  
  
Chorus  
  
Education is still the key  
Even though we have Affirmative action  
  
Chorus until fade
