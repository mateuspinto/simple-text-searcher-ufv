I took a ride in a limousine  
I took a road Id never been  
I met a stranger by the way  
His coat was torn but his eyes were clear  
  
Standing in a slide zone  
Steppin in a slide zone  
  
He told me where a river flows  
He showed me how the apple grows  
He told me of a magic stream  
His face was worn but his eyes were clear  
  
Standing in a slide zone  
I could be steppin in a slide zone  
Standing in a slide zone  
I could be steppin through a time zone  
  
He went to find a shooting star  
Around the bend thats where they are  
I went along just for the ride  
Suddenly I began to slide  
  
Standing in a slide zone  
I could be steppin through a time zone  
  
The air raced by there was no sound  
We drifted high above the ground  
And then he said you know this place  
And then a smile lit up his face  
  
Standing in a slide zone  
I could be steppin in a slide zone  
Standing in a slide zone  
I could be steppin through a time zone  
  
I turned my head and I looked below Slide zone  
And there was something there I know  
Suddenly I began to fall  
I looked around and tried to call  
  
Standing in a slide zone  
He had me steppin in a time zone  
Standing in a slide zone  
Falling through a time zone  
  
Help me please I thought I said  
Then something happened in my head  
Music came from all around  
And I knew what I had found  
  
Standing in a slide zone  
Falling through a time zone  
Steppin in a slide zone  
He had me falling through a time zone  
Slide zone slide zone  
Slide zone time zone
