Once in a while  
In a big blue moon  
There comes a night like this  
Like some surrealist  
Invented this fourth of July  
Night ride home  
  
Hula girls  
And caterpillar tractors in the sand  
The ukulele man  
The fireworks  
This 4th of July  
Night ride home  
  
I love the man beside me  
We love the open road  
No phones till Friday  
Far from the overkill  
Far from the overload  
  
Back at the bar  
The band tears down  
But out here in the headlight beams  
The silver power lines  
Gleam  
On this fourth of July  
Night ride home  
  
Round the curve  
And a big dark horse  
Red taillights on his hide  
Is keeping right alongside  
Rev for stride  
Fourth of July  
Night ride home  
  
I love the man beside me  
We love the open road  
No phones till Friday  
Far from the undertow  
Far from the overload  
  
Once in awhile  
In a big blue moon  
There comes a night like this  
Like some surrealist  
Invented this fourth of July  
Night ride home
