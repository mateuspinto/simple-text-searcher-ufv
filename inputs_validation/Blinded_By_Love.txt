The queen of the Nile  
She laid on her throne  
And she was drifting downstream  
On a barge that was burnished with gold  
Royal purple the sails  
So sweetly perfumed  
And poor Mark Antonys  
Senses were drowned  
And his future was doomed  
  
He was blinded by love  
He was blinded by love  
  
The Philistines paid  
For Samsons blind rage  
The secrets that two lovers share  
Should never have been betrayed  
  
He was blinded by love  
He was blinded by love  
  
Now its no use crying or weeping  
You better lock up your soul for safe keeping  
Promise me  
  
The poor Prince of Wales  
He gave up his crown  
All for the trivial pursuit of  
A parvenu secondhand lady  
So lovers beware  
If you lose your heart  
Careful now dont lose your mind  
Dont mortgage your soul to a stranger  
  
Dont be blinded by love  
Dont be blinded by love  
  
Blinded by love  
Blinded by love
