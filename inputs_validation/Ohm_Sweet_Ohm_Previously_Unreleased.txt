I like you and I like this town  
I mean you and this wonderful town  
I like you you put a smile on my face  
Ohmtown town its my kind of place  
  
I like the pace I like the pace of this place  
I like the style Id like to stay here awhile  
I like the birds singing in the trees  
I like the girls and they like me  
  
The kind of town you can kick off your shoes  
The kind of town can take away the blues  
The kind of town we can all use  
Ohm sweet Ohm  
  
Ohmtown its my kind of place  
Ohmtown you put a smile on my face  
Ohmtown it must be love  
Ohm sweet Ohm
