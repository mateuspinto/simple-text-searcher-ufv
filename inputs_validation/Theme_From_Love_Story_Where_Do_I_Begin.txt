Where do I begin  
To tell the story of how great a love can be  
The sweet love story that is older than the sea  
The simple truth about the love she brings to me  
Where do I start  
  
With her first hello  
She gave a meaning to this empty world of mine  
Thered never be another love another time  
She came into my life and made the living fine  
She fills my heart   
  
She fills my heart with very special things  
With angels songs with wild imaginings  
She fills my soul with so much love  
That anywhere I go Im never lonely  
With her along who could be lonely  
I reach for her hand its always there   
  
How long does it last  
Can love be measured by the hours in a day  
I have no answers now but this much I can say  
I know Ill need her till the stars all burn away  
And shell be there   
Shell be there
