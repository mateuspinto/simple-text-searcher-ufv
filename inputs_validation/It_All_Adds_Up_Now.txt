The way you look at her  
Is the way you use to look at me  
When things were different  
Too many changes have gone down  
Strange vibrations all around  
Makes me think perhaps  
Our love aint right  
So ask your heart and soul  
They will surely know  
If you still love me  
No break down is too big  
For you not to dig  
The kind of love Im putting down  
It all adds up now  
Two and two are really four  
It all adds up now  
My heart knows the score  
Put me in your loving bag  
Please dont say I am a drag  
I gave you more than life itself  
So if you can walk away  
Love will come another day  
In a new disguise  
Maybe youre the kind of guy  
All you want to do is make me cry  
Sometimes I wonder why today  
It all adds up now  
Two and two are really four  
It all adds up now  
My heart knows the score
