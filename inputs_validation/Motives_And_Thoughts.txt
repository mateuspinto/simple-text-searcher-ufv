Rotating bodies confusion of sound  
Negative imagery holding us down  
Social delusion clearly constructed  
Human condition morals corrupted  
Trapped in reaction lawlessness war  
Dissatisfaction from bowels to core  
Devils technology strategy for  
Human mythologies urban folklore  
Sick of psychology counterfeit cure  
Wicked theology robbing the poor  
Scheme demonology mislead the pure  
Strictly strategically studying war  
Light shown in darkness image exposed  
Few can see through the new emperors clothes  
Lustful this hustle turn humans to hoes  
When the blind lead the blind  
Just more trouble and woes  
Its the mind that they chose  
Its designed to stay closed  
Standard of jokers court just a logic  
Sick looking cosmics from schoolyards to college  
Primitive man with civilize knowledge  
System collapse and he still wont acknowledge  
God is the saviour studies behavior  
Trying to fix the mix mind that he gave ya  
Stiffnecked scholars on prescription meds  
Wishing their problems were all in their heads  
Moral dilemma pride is the root  
Misguided from youth heart divided from truth  
Egyptians and Grecians spiritually dead  
Imperially led by the gods in their heads  
Motives and thoughts  
Industrial wealth  
Global economy in it for self  
Heart full of madness covered with kind  
Pleasure designed to take over your mind  
Furnished in godliness painted in good  
This tainted priesthood got real saints misunderstood  
While classes in government set up the veil  
And cultivate minds for more mythical tales  
Typical Hollywood follies good girl  
While vice and corruption take over the world  
Motives and thoughts  
Check your motives and thoughts  
Blind with the wickedness deep in your heart  
Modern day wickedness is all youve been taught  
Lied to your neighbors so you get ahead  
Modern day trickery is all youve been fed  
Motives and thoughts  
Check your motives and thoughts
