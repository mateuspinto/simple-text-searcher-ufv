In a room above a busy street  
The echoes of a life  
The fragments and the accidents  
Separated by incidents  
  
Listen to by the walls  
We share the same spaces  
Repeated in the corridors  
Performing the same movements  
  
Chorus x2  
Story to story  
Building to building  
Street to street  
We pass each other on the stairs  
  
Listen to by the walls  
We share the same spaces  
Repeated in the corridors  
Performing the same movements  
  
The nature of your tragedy  
Is chained around your neck  
Do you lead or are you lead  
Are you sure that you dont care  
  
There are reasons here to give your life  
And follow in your way  
The passion lives to keep your faith  
Though all are different all are great  
  
Climbing as we fall  
We dare to hold on to our fate  
And steal away our destiny  
To catch ourselves  
With quiet grace  
  
Chorus  
  
Listen to by the walls  
We share the same spaces  
Repeated in the corridors  
Performing the same movements  
  
Chorus
