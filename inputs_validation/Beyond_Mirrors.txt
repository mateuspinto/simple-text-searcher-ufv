The age of science has failed  
To explain our universe in rational terms  
  
Consequently the power of magic  
Has gradually emerged from our conscious minds  
To fathom the unfathomable  
  
Our most distinguished scientists  
Reluctantly admit that mankind is nothing  
But some billion creatures  
Sitting on a piece of solar driftwood floating in space  
  
Magic is the art of influencing the course  
Of events by the intervention  
Of spiritual forces or some other occult device  
  
According to Arthur C Clarke  
Any sufficiently advanced technology  
Is indistinguishable from magic  
  
Early civilization often mistook  
The unexplainable world around them to be magic  
  
Rupert Sheldrake in his book  
Seven experiments that could change the world  
Has stated that scientists attitude  
Toward their experiments affect  
The results of their experiments  
  
There is no such thing as a definite  
Fact in science and therefore the irrationality of magic  
Plays an important part in our rational world  
  
Werner Heisenberg the leading 20th century  
Physicist has stated that mass  
Is a physical interpretation of energy  
  
Religious organizations have understood the power of magic  
And therefore monopolized the interpretation  
Of the supernatural to control the human mind  
  
The universe as a whole is beyond explanation  
  
Only at the end of the 20th century  
The RomanCatholic Church admitted  
That the great visionary Galileo Galilei was in fact correct  
  
The second millennium has come to an end  
Scientists have to admit that the universe is magic
