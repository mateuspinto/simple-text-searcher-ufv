Convicted witch my life will end  
At midnight on the stake  
My dedicated life was spent  
To insubordinate  
Secured by lock inside a cell  
Imprisoned for no crime  
The shackles will be useless  
When your life is out of time  
  
Incantation spell gone by  
I will see life again  
My deals will made eternally  
I signed the book of red  
My rage will be unleashed again  
Burning the next morn  
Death means nothing there is no end  
I will be reborn  
  
No gift of exile in my fate  
Ill get no amnesty  
You cant control my destiny  
There is no habitual need  
Proclaim my death to end my wrath  
It takes more than one try  
Indulge your ineffective curse  
I will never die  
  
You think by killing me tonight  
My powers will not rise  
Therell be nowhere for you to run  
When my hatred comes to life  
Condemned to fill the prophecy  
Allowing no first born  
Defy your morbid declaration  
Leave you ripped and torn  
  
Count your blessing would be priest  
As I burn upon the stake  
Youd be forgiven endlessly  
But your values are all fake  
Forever servant of my Lord  
By choice and not submission  
Maybe now Ive made you wonder  
Am I superstition  
  
Incantation spell gone by  
I will live again  
My deals will made eternally  
I signed the book in red  
My rage will be unleashed again  
Burning the next morn  
Death means nothing there is no end  
I will be reborn
