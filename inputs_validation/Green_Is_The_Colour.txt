Heavy hung the canopy of blue  
Shade my eyes and I can see you  
White is the light that shines through the dress that you wore  
  
She lay in the shadow of the wave  
Hazy were the visions of her playing  
Sunlight on her eyes but moonshine made her cry every time  
  
Green is the color of her kind  
Quickness of the eye deceives the mind  
Envy is the bond between the hopeful and the damned
