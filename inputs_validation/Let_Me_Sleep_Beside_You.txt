Baby baby brush the dust of youth from your shoulder  
Because the years of fretting days are right behind you now  
Dont return to fields of green where rainbow secrets were told  
Place your ragged doll with all the toys and things and deeds  
I will show you a game where the winner never wins  
Let your hair hang down wear the dress your mother wore  
Let me sleep beside you  
Lock away your childhood and throw away the key  
For now the streets and city sounds will burn your eyes as coals  
We shall drink the oldest wine and velvet skies will linger  
Child youre a woman now your heart and soul are free  
I will boldly light that lamp and we shall walk together  
Let your hair hang down wear the dress your mother wore  
Let me sleep beside you  
Your darkened eyes throw mystery  
But your lips are void of history  
You could not imagine that it could happen this way could you  
I will give you dreams and Ill tell you things youll like to hear  
Let your hair hang down wear the dress your mother wore  
Let me sleep beside you  
Let me sleep beside you
