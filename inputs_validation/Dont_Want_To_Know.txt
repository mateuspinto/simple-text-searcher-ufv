And I dont want to know about evil  
Only want to know about love  
I dont want to know about evil  
Only want to know about love  
  
Sometimes it gets so hard to listen  
Hard for me to use my eyes  
And all around the cold is glistening  
Making sure it keeps me down to size  
  
And I dont want to know about evil  
Only want to know about love  
I dont want to know one thing about evil  
Only want to know about love  
  
Im waiting for the planes to tumble  
Waiting for the towns to fall  
Im waiting for the cities to crumble  
Waiting till I see you crawl  
  
Yes its getting hard to listen  
Hard for us to use our eyes  
Cause all around that gold is glistening  
Making sure it keeps us hypnotized  
  
And I dont want to know about evil  
I only want to know about love  
I dont want to know about evil  
Only want to know about love  
  
I dont want to know anything about evil  
Only want to know about love  
I dont want to know about evil  
Only want to know about love
