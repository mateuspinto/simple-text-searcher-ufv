They say Im not what I used to be  
All the same  
Im happier than a willow tree  
Shine or rain sitting here by a stream  
Mmm Theres nothing Id rather feel  
In this world  
You and your sweet serenity  
Rocking me  
Melting my heart away  
  
I know something so dear to me  
Beyond words  
Beautiful feeling in my soul  
Sounds Ive heard  
Like humming birds in a dream  
Mmm That mystical one I knew  
Is returned  
Lulling me with those raincloud eyes  
Taking me  
Melting my heart away  
  
I am yes I am  
I know what I feel  
You came in my life  
Made me more real  
  
I know whatever we may have been  
In past times  
Has sorted the truth out from the rest  
Win or lose  
I always knew youd be there  
Mmm You answer my deepest prayer  
In a song  
Shimmering slowhand flowing clear  
Moving me  
Melting my heart away  
  
I am yes I am  
I know what I feel  
You came in my life  
Made me more real  
  
Mmm That mystical one I knew  
Is returned  
Lulling me with those raincloud eyes  
Taking me  
Melting my heart away
