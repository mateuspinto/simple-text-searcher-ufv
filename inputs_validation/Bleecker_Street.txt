Fogs rollin in off the East River bank  
Like a shroud it covers Bleeker Street  
Fills the alleys where men sleep  
Hides the shepherd from the sheep  
  
Voices leaking from a sad cafe  
Smiling faces try to understand  
I saw a shadow touch a shadows hand  
On Bleeker Street  
  
A poet reads his crooked rhyme  
Holy holy is his sacrament  
Thirty dollars pays your rent  
On Bleeker Street  
  
I head a church bell softly chime  
In a melody sustainin  
Its a long road to Caanan  
On Bleeker Street  
Bleeker Street
