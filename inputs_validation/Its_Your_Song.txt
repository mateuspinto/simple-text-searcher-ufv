Standing in the spotlight  
On such a perfect night  
Knowing that your out there listening  
I remember one time  
When I was so afraid  
Didnt think I had the courage  
To stand up on this stage  
Then you reached into my heart  
And you found the melody  
And if there ever was somebody  
Who made me believe in me  
It was you  
It was you  
It was your song that made me sing  
It was your voice that gave me wings  
And it was your light that shined  
Guiding my heart to find  
This place where I belong  
It was your song  
Every night I pray  
Before the music starts to play  
That Ill do my best and I wont let you down  
And for all the times Ive stood here  
This feeling feels brand new  
And any time I doubt myself I think of you  
Cause It was your song that made me sing  
It was your voice that gave me wings  
And it was your light that shined  
Guiding my heart to find  
This place where I belong  
It was your song  
Dreams can come true  
With Gods great angels like you  
It was your song that made me sing  
It was your voice that gave me wings  
And it was your light that shined  
Guiding my heart to find  
This place where I belong  
It was your song  
It was your song  
Its always been your song
