Chorus  
See the man on the phone  
With a gun in his hand  
Sipping courage from a crystal cup  
Hes a man in the wrong  
With a gun at his head  
Pushes on and now its time to cut and run  
Time passing so slowly  
Still as he sits and he watches the sand slip through his hands  
He demands something more  
Something strong  
Something savage and pure  
One more twist of the knife and its time to cut and run  
Chorus  
He smiles as he draws on his last cigarette  
And he tries to forget all that forces every move  
He commands something new  
Something strong  
Something spiteful and true  
One more twist of the knife and its time to cut and run  
Cries on his tape so they might understand  
Signs his farewell with a squeeze of his hand  
Chorus  Repeat 4 times and fade
