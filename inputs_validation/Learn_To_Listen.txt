You gotta learn to listen listen to learn  
You gotta learn to listen before you get burned  
Learn to listen listen to learn  
You gotta learn to listen before you get burned  
  
You gotta have fun not a fix in the arm  
You gotta stay out of deep water  
Happiness is something youve gotta earn  
You gotta fight to make your love into returns  
  
Learn to listen listen to learn  
You gotta learn to listen before you get burned  
  
You got the rights and theres always a temptation  
This one more screwed up the nation  
Gotta have a plan gotta learn to listen  
Gotta take a stab you have my blessing alright  
  
You gotta take the cotton out of your ears  
You gotta start hanging on to all your affairs  
Ive lived your life for so many years  
All I got was selfpity and tears
