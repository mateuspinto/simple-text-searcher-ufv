He will be there  
Through the hurricane  
Through the pouring rain  
He will be there  
  
Through the longest night  
Everythings gonna be alright  
The storm is gonna end  
And the suns gonna rise again  
  
Chorus  
Keep on shining  
Let Love light up the darkest sky  
And youll be flying  
Rise above all the hardest times  
So hold on Hold on  
Be strong Be strong  
Come on Come on come on  
Keep on shining  
  
Nothing can stop  
The way He feels  
Cause His Loves so real  
No mountain top  
  
Will ever be too high  
Cause with Jesus by your side  
Theres nothing you cant do  
Youre gonna make it through  
  
Chorus  
  
You know in your soul  
You know in your heart  
He will always be your only  
Guiding star  
  
Chorus
