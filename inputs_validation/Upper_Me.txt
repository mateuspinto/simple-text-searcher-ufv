The ego and the id  
  
Lead vocal eric stewart  
  
The time has come the wild one said  
When we must all decide  
We cannot carry on this way  
And so we must divide  
The road before us runs both ways  
So which one do you choose  
But all will not go well if you refuse  
  
What becomes of the upper me when the fire burns in my mind  
How can I leave my ego behind  
I return to another me or I lose the will to survive  
How can I keep my hero alive  
  
It seems to me the wise one said  
That mountains are so high  
The river is too deep to cross  
And none of us can fly  
But I believe that compromise  
Is what is needed here  
Or surely we become the things we fear  
  
But the good in me dont wanna believe  
That the evil me is so  
And a voice somewhere said do as you please  
But the upper me said no no no no no no  
  
What becomes of the upper me when the fire burns in my mind  
How can I leave my ego behind  
I return to another me or I lose the will to survive  
How can I keep my hero alive  
To survive  
How can I keep my hero alive
