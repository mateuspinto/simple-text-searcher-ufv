Oh my Lord  
You sent your son to save us  
Oh my Lord  
Your very self you gave us  
Oh my Lord  
That sin may not enslave us  
And love may reign once more  
  
Oh my Lord  
When in the crib they found him  
Oh my Lord  
A golden halo crowned him  
Oh my Lord  
They gathered all around him  
To see him and adore  
  
This day will live forever  
Oh my Lord So praise the Lord  
They had become to doubt you  
Oh my Lord He is the truth forever  
What did they know about you  
Oh my Lord So praise the Lord  
But they were lost without you  
They needed you so bad His light is shining on us  
  
Oh my Lord So praise the Lord  
With the childs adoration  
Oh my lord He is a personation  
There came great jubilation  
Oh my Lord So praise the Lord  
And full of admiration  
They realized what they had until the sun falls from the sky  
  
Oh my Lord Oh praise the Lord  
You sent your son to save us  
Oh my Lord This day will live forever  
Your very self you gave us  
Oh my Lord So praise the Lord  
That sin may not enslave us  
And love may reign once more
