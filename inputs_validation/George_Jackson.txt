I woke up this mornin  
There were tears in my bed  
They killed a man I really loved  
Shot him through the head  
Lord Lord  
They cut George Jackson down  
Lord Lord  
They laid him in the ground  
  
Sent him off to prison  
For a seventydollar robbery  
Closed the door behind him  
And they threw away the key  
Lord Lord They cut George Jackson down  
Lord Lord  
They laid him in the ground  
  
He wouldnt take shit from no one  
He wouldnt bow down or kneel  
Authorities they hated him  
Because he was just too real  
Lord Lord  
They cut George Jackson down  
Lord Lord  
They laid him in the ground  
  
Prison guards they cursed him  
As they watched him from above  
But they were frightened of his power  
They were scared of his love  
Lord Lord  
So they cut George Jackson down  
Lord Lord  
They laid him in the ground  
  
Sometimes I think this whole world  
Is one big prison yard  
Some of us are prisoners  
The rest of us are guards  
Lord Lord  
They cut George Jackson down  
Lord Lord  
They laid him in the ground
