  
Fly me to the moon  
Let me play among the stars  
Let me see what spring is like  
On aJupiter and Mars  
In other words hold my hand  
In other words baby kiss me  
Fill my heart with song  
And let me sing for ever more  
You are all I long for  
All I worship and adore  
In other words please be true  
In other words I love you  
Fly me to the moon  
Let me play among the stars  
Let me see what spring is like  
On aJupiter and Mars  
In other words hold my hand  
In other words baby kiss me  
Fill my heart with song  
Let me sing for ever more  
You are all I long for  
All I worship and adore  
In other words please be true  
In other words in other words
