All Along  
Deep inside secrets burning  
I Should have known all the while whats true  
I went along to fool myself  
  
Cant go on I cant escape it  
All along  
I think I really knew  
It was there in the words unspoken  
  
All along  
Still believed in you  
Now I stand here betrayed and broken  
Close my eyes from the burning  
  
All along all the while its true  
Take it on or turn your back  
Either way you cant escape it
