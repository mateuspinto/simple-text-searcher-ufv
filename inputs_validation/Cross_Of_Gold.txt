Where do you stand  
What is your statement  
What is it youre trying to say  
Whats in your hand  
Whats in your basement  
Whats in the cards you dont play  
Are you holding the key  
Or are you intending  
To pick the lock of heavens gate  
Its confusing to me  
The message youre sending  
And I dont know if I can relate  
  
Chorus  
Whats you line  
Tell me why you wear your cross of gold  
State of mind  
Or does it find a way into your soul  
  
Is it a flame  
Is it a passion  
A symbol of love living in you  
Or is it a game  
Religion in fashion  
Some kind of phase youre going through  
We all travel the extremes  
From cellar to rafter  
Looking for a place in the sun  
So Im trying to see  
What youre headed after  
But I dont know where youre coming from  
  
For some its simply something to wear around your neck  
Just a chain  
Jewelry  
Is it decoration  
Is it an icon  
Or proclamation  
An icon of what  
What  
For some its simply something to wear around your neck  
Just a chain  
It means a lot more than that to me  
  
Chorus
