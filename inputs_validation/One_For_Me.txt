There s nothing I would rather do  
Take my praise to You  
Cause Your love brought me to this place  
And I just can t contain my praise  
  
Chorus  
I m gonna tell the whole world  
That there s no one else like you  
Jesus You are the one for me  
I m gonna shout you re praises  
And tell of all the things you ve done  
Jesus You are the one for me  
  
There s something I just have to do  
That is to lift my hands to You  
Coz Your love has brought me to this place  
And I just can t contain my praise  
  
repeat chorus  
You re the one for me  
Jesus you are the one for me  
You re the one for me  
You re everything I need
