Packed up all my cares and woes  
Here I go soft and low  
Bye bye black bird singing in the dead of night  
Take these broken wings and learn to fly  
All your life you were only waiting for this moment to arise  
  
Black bird sing in the dead of night  
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see  
All your life your were only waiting for this moment to be free  
Black bird fly Black bird fly  
Into the light of the black dark night  
  
Black bird fly black bird fly  
Into the light of the dark black  
  
Black bird singing in the dead of night  
Take these broken wings and learn to fly  
All your life you were only waiting for this moment to arrive  
  
Make my bed and light the light Ill be home late tonight  
Black bird bye bye
