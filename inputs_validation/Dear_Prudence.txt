Dear Prudence wont you come out to play  
Dear Prudence greet the brand new day  
The sun is up the sky is blue  
Its beautiful and so are you  
Dear Prudence wont you come out to play  
  
Dear Prudence open up your eyes  
Dear Prudence see the sunny skies  
The wind is low the birds will sing  
That you are part of everything  
Dear Prudence wont you open up your eyes  
  
Look around round  
Look around round round  
Look around  
  
Dear Prudence let me see you smile  
Dear Prudence like a little child  
The clouds will be a daisy chain  
So let me see you smile again  
Dear Prudence wont you let me see you smile  
  
Dear Prudence wont you come out to play  
Dear Prudence greet the brand new day  
The sun is up the sky is blue  
Its beautiful and so are you  
Dear Prudence wont you come out to play
