Shall I tell you about my life  
They say Im a man of the world  
Ive flown across every tide  
And Ive seen lots of pretty girls  
  
I guess Ive got everything I need  
I wouldt ask for more  
And theres no one Id rather be  
But I just wish that Id never been born  
  
Break  
  
And I need a good woman  
To make me feel like a good man should  
I dont say Im a good man  
Oh but I would be if I could  
  
I could tell you about my life  
And keep you amused Im sure  
About all the times Ive cried  
And how I dont want to be sad anymore  
And how I wish I was in love
