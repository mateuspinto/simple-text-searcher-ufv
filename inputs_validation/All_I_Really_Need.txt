All I really need is a song in my heart  
Food in my belly and love in my family  
All I really need is a song in my heart  
And love in my family  
  
And I need the rain to fall  
And I need the sun to shine  
To give life to the seeds we sow  
To give the food we need to grow grow  
  
All I really need is a song in my heart  
Food in my belly and love in my family  
All I really need is a song in my heart  
And love in my family  
  
And I need some clean water for drinking  
Drinking  
And I need some clean air for breathing  
Breathing  
So that I can grow up strong  
And take my place where I belong  
  
All I really need is a song in my heart  
Food in my belly and love in my family  
All I really need is a song in my heart  
And love in my family
