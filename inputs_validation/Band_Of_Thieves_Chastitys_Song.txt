Band of thieves ChastityS song  
Writer elyse weiberg  
  
Wind up when a band of thieves  
Making my way across town  
Lost in a manner of speech  
Making my way across town  
What about the good life  
That I have been expecting for so long  
What about the good life  
Hush about my lonesome child  
Dont cha cry  
Mommas gonna bring you something  
Gonna get you high  
Never you mind how I came here  
I just knew someone was laying here  
Cause you buy  
So long I carried this load  
Feel like I never been born  
So long I traveled this road  
Feel like Im really worn  
What about the good life  
That I have been expecting for so long  
What about the good life  
Hush about my lonesome child  
Dont cha cry  
Mommas gonna bring you something  
Gonna get you high  
Never you mind how I came here  
I just knew someone was laying here  
Cause you buy  
So long I carried this load  
Feel like I never been born  
So long I traveled this road  
Feel like Im really worn  
What about the good life  
That I have been expecting for so long  
What about the good life  
What about the good times  
What about the good times  
What about the good times  
What about the good times  
What about the good times  
What about the good times  
What about the good times  
What about the good times
