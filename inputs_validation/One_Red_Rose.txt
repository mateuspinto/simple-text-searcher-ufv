The rain came down on the tin roof  
Hardly a sound was left from the birthday party  
The kitchen light fell asleep on the bedroom floor  
Me and her were talking softer  
Than all the time before I lost her  
Picture sat on top of the chest of drawers  
One red rose in the Bible  
Pressed between the holy alphabet  
Probably wouldnt believe you if you told me  
But what I never knew I never will forget  
Rainy nights get dark real early  
Her dress was soft and her hair was curly  
We danced around the table to the old banjo  
Rainy nights were made for lovers  
We lay there still beneath the covers  
And I aint never felt like that before  
One red rose in the Bible  
Pressed between the holy alphabet  
Probably wouldnt believe you if you told me  
But what I never knew I never will forget  
One red rose in the Bible  
Pressed between the holy alphabet  
Probably wouldnt believe you if you told me  
But what I never knew I never will forget  
What I never knew I never will forget
