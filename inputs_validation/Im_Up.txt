I am holding to the joy of my salvation  
I am glad to have a life that always grows  
And if the Word of God is any indication  
I am doing even better than I know  
I am doing even better than I know  
Theres a joy that even people of the world find  
In every good and perfect gift the Father sends  
So I thank the Lord that I was born the first time  
But I thank Him more that I was born again  
Oh I thank Him more that I was born again  
  
Chorus  
I am up  
Like the sun is up  
I can feel my life on a rise  
I am up  
Like the stars at night  
I get up on bein alive  
I am up  
Like the Lord is up  
And my life is filled with His life  
I was freed and I am saved  
I am up  
I am up  
  
There are times life is so fine I cant contain it  
Everywhere I look I see what God had done  
And I dont have to work and worry to sustain it  
When I walk with God His joy will always come  
When I walk with God His joy will always come  
  
Chorus
