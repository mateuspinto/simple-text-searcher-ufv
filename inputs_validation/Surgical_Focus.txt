With surgical focus  
She stared at me and said  
Im willing to reach out  
Get in to your head  
And I will keep you and cleanse you  
She glared at me and wept  
A change is not going to hurt you  
Not this time  
And Ive been waiting in line for this  
Now that its taken forever I insist  
Until I get it I cant breathe  
Climbing high upon the rocky cliffs she flies  
With surgical focus with surgical focus  
With surgical focus  
She stared at me and said  
Im willing to reach out  
Get in to your head  
And I will keep you and cleanse you  
She glared at me and wept  
A change is not going to hurt you  
Not this time  
And Ive been waiting in line for this  
Now that its taken forever I insist  
Until I get it I cant breathe  
Climbing high upon the rocky cliffs she flies  
With surgical focus with surgical focus  
Well Ive been waiting in line for this  
Now that its taken forever I insist  
Until I get it I cant breathe  
Climbing high upon the rocky cliffs she flies  
With surgical focus with surgical focus  
With surgical focus  
With surgical focus  
With surgical focus
