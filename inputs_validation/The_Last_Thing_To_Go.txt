The angels were singing a sad country song  
It sounded like something of yours  
With a conscience as clear as the tear in your eye  
And a heart beaten golden and pure  
  
And I felt all the feelings we set down in song  
Torn from the body and soul  
And the fortunes that faded like stars into daylight  
And tear drops we turned into gold  
  
Chorus  
Every hard rocking wreck on the highway  
Every heartbroken rule of the road  
Every true thing we wrote on the wind is still singing  
Love is the last thing to go  
  
Love is the reason we happened at all  
And it paid for the damage we done  
And it bought us the freedom to fall into grace  
On our way to our place in the sun  
  
Chorus
