Joy to the world the Lord is come  
Here was a man a man who was born in a small village the son of a peasant
woman  
He grew up in another small village  
Until he reached the age of thirty he worked as a carpenter  
  
Then for three years he was a traveling minister  
But he never traveled more than two hundred miles from where he was born  
And where he did go he usually walked  
He never held political office he never wrote a book never bought a home  
  
Never had a family he never went to college and he never set foot inside a big
city  
Yes here was a man  
Though he never did one on the things usually associated with greatness  
He had no credentials but himself he had nothing to do with this world  
  
Except through the devine purpose that brought him to this world  
While he was still a young man the tide of popular opinion turned against him  
Most of his friends ran away one of them denied him  
One of them betrayed him and turned him over to his enemies  
  
Then he went through the mockery of a trial  
And was nailed to a cross between two thieves  
And even while he was dying his executioners gambled  
For the only piece of property that he had in this world  
  
And that was his robe his purple robe  
When he was dead he was taken down from the cross  
And laid in a borrowed grave provided by compassionate friends  
More than nineteen centuries have come and gone  
  
And today hes a centerpiece of the human race  
Our leader in the column to human destiny  
I think Im well within the mark when I say that all of the armies that ever
marched  
All of the navies that ever sailed the seas  
  
All of the legislative bodies that ever sat and all of the kings that ever
reigned  
All of them put together have not affected the life of man on this earth  
So powerfully as that one solitary life  
Here was a man joy to the world the Lord is come
