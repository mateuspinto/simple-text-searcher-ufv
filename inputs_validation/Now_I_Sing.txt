Can you just give me a second please  
I would like to give my testimony

How he saved me made me holy  
If you want to know the reason why  
I gave it all this lifes no longer mine  
How He made a way kept me alive  
Well listen close as I testify  
You dont know like I know

Everything the Lord has done for me so  
That you understand Im just gonna say it

Cause His love is true His mercies new
