What goes up must come down  
What must rise must fall  
And what goes on in your life  
Is writing on the wall  
  
If all things must fall  
Why build a miracle at all  
If all things must pass  
Even a miracle wont last  
  
What goes up must come down  
What must stand alone  
And what goes on in your mind  
Is turning into stone  
  
If all things must fall  
Why build a miracle at all  
If all things must pass  
Even a pyramid wont last  
  
How can you be so sure  
How do you know what the earth will endure  
How can you be so sure  
That the wonders youve made in you life  
  
Will be seen  
By the millions wholl follow to visit the site  
Of your dream  
  
What goes up must come down  
What goes round must come round  
Whats been lost must be found
