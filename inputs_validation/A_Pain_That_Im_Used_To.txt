Im not sure what Im looking for anymore  
I just know that Im harder to console  
I dont see who Im trying to be instead of me  
But the key is a question of control  
  
Can you say what youre trying to play anyway  
I just pay while youre breaking all the rules  
All the signs that I find have been underlined  
Devils thrive on the drive that is fueled  
  
Chorus  
All this running around well its getting me down  
Just give me a pain that Im used to  
I dont need to believe all the dreams you conceive  
You just need to achieve something that rings true  
  
Theres a hole in your soul like an animal  
With no conscience repentance oh no  
Close your eyes pay the price for your paradise  
Devils feed on the seeds of the soul  
  
I cant conceal what I feel what I know is real  
No mistaking the faking I care  
With a prayer in the air I will leave it there  
On a note full of hope not despair  
  
Chorus x2
