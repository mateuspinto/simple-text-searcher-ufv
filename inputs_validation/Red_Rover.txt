Why do you come around  
So very much  
You know it just brings you down  
Its just something you can touch  
  
You dont belong here  
I guess you never did  
Whisper look up in your ear  
You just keep it so well hid  
  
Anyone at all  
Could see what was missin  
Could see you were dyin  
But no one was cryin  
  
And I did hear what you said  
Now I can go home  
All my days are blue  
All my days are bright  
  
Red Rover Red Rover Red Rover  
We come we come we come we come  
To take you over ah  
Take you over ah  
Red rover ah  
Take you over ah  
  
One of the quiet ones  
One of the few  
Now fall down onto your knees  
Show us all what you can do  
  
We came around here  
To see if you were well  
And theres nothing for you to fear  
In Heaven or in Hell  
  
Anyone at all  
Could see what was missin  
Could see you were dyin  
But no one was cryin  
  
And I did hear what you said  
Now time to drive home  
All my days are blue  
All days bright  
  
Red Rover Red Rover Red Rover  
We come we come we come we come  
To take you over ah  
Take you over ah  
Red rover ah  
Take you over ah  
Red rover ah  
Take you over ah  
Red rover ah  
Take you over ah
