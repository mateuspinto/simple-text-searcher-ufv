Your love for me is gone  
But my love for you lives on  
And my memories of you  
Will never die  
  
I can just see you now  
The special smile you gave to me  
The face Ill love eternally  
I see all the things you do  
  
Your nearness seems so real to me  
As though you really care with me  
Cant believe its just a memory  
I can just see you now  
  
Oh girl if I only could  
I wish with all my heart I could  
Holding you would feel so good  
If I could just see you now  
  
I can just feel you now  
The tender sweetness of your lips  
As they brush across my fingertips  
I feel the softness on your mind  
  
So warm beside through the night  
Holding you to the morning light  
Oh did you really say goodbye  
I can just feel you now  
  
Oh girl if I only could  
I wish with all my heart I could  
Holding you would feel so good  
If I could just see you now  
  
I could just see you now  
The special smile you gave to me  
The face Ill love eternally  
I see all the things you do
