Im born  
Im alive  
I breathe  
In a moment or two I realize  
That the sphere upon which I reside  
Is asleep on its feet  
Should I go back to sleep  
We orbit the sun  
I grow up  
My open eyes see  
  
A zombified somnambulist society  
Leaving us as vitamins  
For the hibernating human animal  
Do you see what I mean  
You stare at me like a vitamin  
On the surface you hate  
But you know you need me  
  
Ill come dressed as any pill you deem fit  
Whatever helps you swallow truth  
All the more easily  
  
And I wonder will you digest me  
Into the sleep machine I wont plug in  
In fact Id rather die before I will comply  
To you my friend  
I write the reason I still live  
cause in my mind its set the vitamin is ripe to give  
Coming closer to another 2000 years  
You and I will pry  
The closed eye of the sleep machine
