Verse 1  
I want a smile on my face  
A happy alert to my brain  
I want to be on the other side  
I want a wonderful life  
I want to avoid the rush  
I dont even wanna hide

I want a smile make this worth while  
And get as much  
As I can  
I want to fly just you and I  
Im ready for love  
Yes I am  
  
Verse 2  
I want a rainbow above me  
And feel inside so free  
  
I want to have you right here  
I want to fly up above  
And feel all the love  
I want everything so clear  
  
Chorus x1

All worth while  
I want to change  
And just rearrange  
I want to be  
Just only me  
I want a smile on my
