When youre just out walking and you pass  
Little signs that say keep off the grass  
Did you ever stop and ask yourself why  
Pretty playgrounds children used to know  
Little squares where lovers love to go  
Disappear so parking lots can grow  
Why  
  
Once you start the questions never cease  
Whats disturbed when you disturb the peace  
Pets and children are prohibited  
  
Why ask yourself why  
And when you think about it  
Bullets fly like popcorn on the screen  
Recommended wholesome nice and clean  
Making loves the thing that cant be seen  
Why  
  
Let your hair down just an inch or two  
Let your skin be red or green or blue  
They invent a special name for you  
Why  
  
On a clear day oh say can you see  
What remains of mountains scenery  
Catch a glimpse of all the scenery sky  
Beautiful sky as shiny as a penny  
So when youre out walking and you pass  
Near a sign that say keep off the grass  
Put a sign right next to it that says why
