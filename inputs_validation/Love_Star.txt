Love Star oh star of love have you forgotten me  
Im so lonely for someone to love  
Love Star oh star of love look down so you may see  
Someone for me like Im dreaming of  
  
You see because my heart is shy  
Somehow love has passed me by  
And no one knows how much I cry  
When Im all alone for a love of my own  
  
Love Star they say for every heart a love star shines  
So please please shine for mine and let me find my love  
  
You see because my heart is shy  
Somehow love has passed me by  
And no one knows how much I cry  
When Im all alone for a love of my own  
  
Love Star they say for every heart a love star shines  
So please please shine for mine and let me find my love
