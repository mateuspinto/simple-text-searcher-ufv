You got your crust  
Turning my daydreams into dust  
  
Oh look at you over there  
Ripping the sawdust from my teddybear  
Yeah look at you over there  
Ripping the sawdust from my teddybear  
  
Youre so darn pretty girl  
Well I think you know it you was you  
On Monday morning putting back yakity yak  
  
Oh look at you over there  
Ripping the sawdust from my teddybear  
Yeah now look at you over there  
Ripping the sawdust from my teddybear  
  
You take the pebbles from the babies rattle  
You make Santas raindeer look like cattle  
You take Tinkerbells rust  
And turn it into sawdust  
  
Yeah now look at you over there  
Ripping the sawdust from my teddybear  
Yeah look at you over there  
Ripping the sawdust from my teddybear  
  
You take the pebbles from the babies rattle  
You make Santas raindeer look like cattle  
You take Tinkerbells rust  
And turn it into sawdust  
  
You got your crust  
Turning my daydreams into dust  
  
Yeah now look at you over there  
Ripping the sawdust from my teddybear  
Yeah now look at you over there  
Ripping the sawdust from my teddybear  
Look at you over there  
Look at you over there  
Look at you over there  
Look at you over there  
Look at you over there  
Look at you over there  
Yeah look at you over there  
Look at you over there  
Look at you over there  
Look at you over there  
Look at you over there  
Over there over there over there over there  
My poor teddybear teddybear teddybear teddybear
