Im all grown up  
But somehow it feels like Im pretending  
Visions of my younger years they are buried  
But the scenes that play inside of me are impending  
They are never ending  
  
Chorus  
Where where where where where are you  
You dont have to look out that window anymore  
You can just come back to yourself you can come back to this world  
Where are you Tell me who heard you And where are you  
  
He led me into his room and had me lay down  
My heart and my soul and anything else that you could own  
When youre six years old  
But now Im older  
  
Chorus  
  
Such a quiet secret it hurt too much trying hard to keep it  
Oh and I looked up to you I wanted so much to believe in you  
I wanted so much for you to believe it me  
Oh I tried I tried  
  
Where where where where where are you  
You dont have to look out anymore  
I dont have to look out of that window anymore  
I can just come back to myself I can come back this world  
  
Where are you Tell me who heard you And where are you now  
Where are you Where are you Where are you Where are you  
Tell me who hurt you
