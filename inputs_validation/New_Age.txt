Can I have your autograph  
He said to the fat blonde actress  
You know Ive seen every movie youve been in  
From Paths of Pain to Jewels of Glory  
And when you kissed Robert Mitchum  
Gee but I thought youd never catch him  
  
Over the hill right now  
And youre looking for love  
Youre over the hill right now  
And youre looking for love  
Ill come running to you  
honey when you want me  
Ill come running to yoy  
honey when you want me  
  
Can I have your autograph  
He said to the fat blonde actress  
You know I know everything youve done  
Anyway I hate divorces  
To the left is a marble shower  
It was fun even for an hour  
  
Yourre over the hill right now  
And youre looking for love  
Youre over the hill right now  
And youre looking for love  
Ill come running to you  
honey when you want me  
Ill come running to you  
honey when you want me  
  
Somethings got a hold on me  
And I dont know what  
  
Somethings got a hold on me  
And I dont know what  
  
Its the beginning of a new age  
Its the beginning of a new age  
  
Its a new age
