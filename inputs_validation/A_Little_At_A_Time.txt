Stop lovin me a little at a time let me lose you a little at a time  
Walk away slow like you dont want to go leave me a little at a time  
  
For my benefit try to cry a little bit  
For old times sake give me a slow heartbreak  
I put up a fight but Ill be all right if you stop lovin me a little at a
time  
  
Hurt me a little at a time turn me away a little at a time  
Walk away slow like you dont want to go leave me a little at a time  
  
For my benefit try to cry a little bit  
A little at a time a little at a time a little at a time a little at a time
