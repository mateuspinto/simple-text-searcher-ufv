Well you get down the fiddle and you get down the bow  
Kick off your shoes and you throw them on the floor  
Dance in the kitchen till the morning light  
Louisiana Saturday Night  
  
Waitin in the front yard sittin on a log  
A single shot rifle and a oneeyed dog  
Yonder come our kinfolk in the moonlight  
Louisiana Saturday Night  
  
Well you get down the fiddle and you get down the bow  
Kick off your shoes and you throw them on the floor  
Dance in the kitchen till the morning light  
Louisiana Saturday Night  
  
My brother Bill and my other brother Jack  
Barrel full of beer and a possum in a sack  
Fifteen kids in the front porch light  
Louisiana Saturday Night  
  
When the kinfolk leave and the kids get fed  
Me and my woman gonna slip off to bed  
Have a little fun when we turn out the lights  
Louisiana Saturday Night  
  
Well you get down the fiddle and you get down the bow  
Kick off your shoes and you throw them on the floor  
Dance in the kitchen till the morning light  
Louisiana Saturday Night x3
