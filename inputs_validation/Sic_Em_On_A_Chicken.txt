Chorus  
Sic em on a chicken  
Sic em on a chicken  
Sic em on a chicken and watch them feathers fly  
  
Sic em on a chicken  
Sic em on a chicken  
Sic em on a chicken Bring out the butter and the flour were ready to fry  
  
My dog Pete is the smallest dog of all the dogs in my yard  
Hes a mean son bitch  
Drinks Beam and water from a broken mason jar  
  
Chorus  
  
Sic em on a chicken  
Sic em on a chicken  
Sic em on a chicken  
Bring out the butter and the flour were ready to fry  
  
I heard this awful noise coming from the woods  
I heard chicken screams  
Know it aint gonna be good  
  
Well I think we lost the chicken  
Think we lost the chicken  
Think we lost the chicken because I just heard him cry  
  
Think we lost the chicken  
Think we lost the chicken  
Think we lost the chicken but you can get another one for a dollar 79  
  
In a couple of years his spurs have grown  
He wasnt safe to keep around the house  
When he almost took an eyeball from Lonnys son  
And I was sitting at home making fig preserves  
And Id seen where that rooster kicked him in the eye  
And I knew that that was the day that chicken was going to get what he
deserved  
  
So I chased the chicken  
I chased the chicken  
I chased the chicken and Pete hit em from the side  
  
I chased the chicken  
I chased the chicken  
I chased the chicken and me and Pete suppered on a home made chicken pot pie  
  
Chorus  
  
Sic em on a chicken  
Get that chicken  
I can smell the kitchen and its almost supper time
