In the year of 1492  
When Columbus sailed the ocean blue  
Had he landed on Indias shore  
You might never have come to knock on my door  
  
Who needs a rhyme or a reason  
Some dreams were made to find  
So I know that I must follow  
Ask me just how much I love you  
You are starlight Im Galileo  
Even on the darkest night oh  
I will find the shining light of our love  
  
Through the rain clouds thundering nights  
Mr Franklin stood there holding his kite  
He was crazy always pressing his luck  
But he got what he wanted when lightning struck yeah  
  
Who needs a rhyme or a reason  
Some dreams were made to find  
So I know that I must follow  
Ask me just how much I love you  
You are starlight Im Galileo  
Even on the darkest night oh  
I will find the shining light  
  
Ask me just how much I love you  
You are starlight Im Galileo  
Even on the darkest night oh  
I will find the shining light of our love  
  
I believe in you and the special love we could share  
And maybe one day darling youll turn around  
And all I really know is I will be there  
  
Who needs a rhyme or a reason  
This dream was made to find  
So I know that I will follow  
  
Ask me just how much I love you  
You are starlight Im Galileo  
Even on the darkest night oh  
I will find the shining light  
I will find the shining light of our love  
  
Ask me just how much I love you of our love  
Im Galileo  
Even on the darkest night oh  
I will find the shining light of our love  
Ask me just how much I love you of our love  
Im Galileo
