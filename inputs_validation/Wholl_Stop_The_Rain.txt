Long as I remember the rain been comin down  
Clouds of mystery pourin confusion on the ground  
Good men through the ages tryin to find the sun  
And I wonder still I wonder wholl stop the rain  
  
I went down Virginia seekin shelter from the storm  
Caught up in the fable I watched the tower grow  
Five year plans and new deals wrapped in golden chains  
And I wonder still I wonder wholl stop the rain  
  
Heard the singers playin how we cheered for more  
The crowd had rushed together tryin to keep warm  
Still the rain kept pourin fallin on my ears  
And I wonder still I wonder wholl stop the rain
