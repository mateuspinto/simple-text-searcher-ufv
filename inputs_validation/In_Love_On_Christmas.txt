Because everybody should be in love with somebody on Christmas  
  
Last year Christmas  
It happened without us Out us out us  
I was all mixed up and confused  
I didnt know what to do baby What to do babe

I always thought that Christmas was a happy day  
I always prayed that Santad pack love on his sleigh  
And send it my way
