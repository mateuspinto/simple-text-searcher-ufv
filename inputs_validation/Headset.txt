See I got a little bit of a problem  
Back where I come from  
Feels like five people in my population  
And no one ever leaves there  
Im gonna be the first one  
  
I guess my papa always told me the way it was  
And my mama think she knows me I know she doesnt  
Ah ah ah  
  
But I got my head set on California  
Ill fly away tomorrow wont even warn ya  
And Ill send a big postcard just to piss you off  
I got my head set on California  
Here I come  
  
See I got what you would call an obsession  
It feels like I think sane  
The limits of a small town  
Frustrating my brain  
Might leave some roots there  
But my heads on the next plane  
  
Cause my daddy always told me the way it was  
And my mama think she knows me I know she doesnt  
Ah ah ah  
  
But I got my head set on California  
Ill fly away tomorrow wont even warn ya  
And Ill send a big postcard just to piss you off  
I got my head set on California  
Here I come  
  
Papa always tells me the way it was  
And my mama think she knows me I know she doesnt  
Ah ah ah  
  
But I got my head set on New York City  
Ill fly away tomorrow wont even miss me  
And Ill get a big boyfriend just to piss you off  
  
But I got my head set on California  
Ill fly away tomorrow wont even warn ya  
And Ill send a big postcard just to piss you off  
I got my head set on California  
  
Here I come here I come
