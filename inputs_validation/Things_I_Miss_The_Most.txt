I dont mind the quiet  
Or the lonely nights  
I dont miss the funky attitudes  
And I dont miss the fights  
I lie on the couch till suppertime  
And hunker down and read the Post  
And thats when I remember the things I miss the most  
  
The talk  
The sex  
Somebody to trust  
The Audi TT  
The house on the Vineyard  
The house on the gulf coast  
These are the things I miss the most  
  
I kinda like frying up  
My sad cuisine  
Gettin in bed and curling up with a girlie magazine  
But sometimes in the corner of my eye  
I see that adorable ghost  
And then baboom I remember the things I miss the most  
  
The talk  
The sex  
Somebody to trust  
The comfy Eames chair  
The good copper pans  
The 54 Strat  
These are the things I miss the most  
  
I had a little birdy friend  
By morning she was gone  
Birdy goodbye  
Birdy byebye  
  
Im learning how to meditate  
So far so good  
Im building the Andrea Doria out of balsa wood  
The days really dont last forever  
But its getting pretty damn close  
And thats when I remember the things I miss the most  
  
The talk  
The sex  
Somebody to trust  
The Audi TT  
The house on the Vineyard  
The house on the gulf coast  
These are the things I miss the most
