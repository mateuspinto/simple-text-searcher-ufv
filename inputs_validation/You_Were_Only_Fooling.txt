You were only fooling  
while I was falling in love  
  
Words by billy faber and fred meadows  
Music by larry fotine  
  
You were only fooling  
While I was falling in love  
Its a story as old as adam and eve  
I was making love but you were making believe  
  
You lied to me with kisses  
I tried to stop dreaming of  
But you were only fooling me  
While I was falling in love  
  
repeat from start
