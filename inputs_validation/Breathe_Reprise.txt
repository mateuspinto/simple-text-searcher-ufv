Breathe breathe in the air  
Dont be afraid to care  
Leave but dont leave me  
Look around and choose your own ground  
  
Long you live and high you fly  
And smiles youll give and tears youll cry  
And all you touch and all you see  
Is all your life will ever be  
  
Run rabbit run  
Dig that hole forget the sun  
And when at last the work is done  
Dont sit down its time to dig another one  
  
For long you live and high you fly  
But only if you ride the tide  
And balanced on the biggest wave  
You race towards an early grave
