As the deer panteth for the water  
So my soul longs after You  
You alone are my hearts desire  
And I long to worship You  
  
You alone are my strength my shield  
To You alone may my spirit yield  
You alone are my hearts desire  
And I long to worship You  
  
I want you more than gold or silver  
Only You can satisfy  
You alone are the real joy giver  
And the apple of my eye  
  
You alone are my strength my shield  
To You alone may my spirit yield  
You alone are my hearts desire  
And I long to worship You  
  
Youre my friend and Youre my brother  
Even though you are a King  
I love You more than any other  
So much more than anything  
  
You alone are my strength my shield  
To You alone may my spirit yield  
You alone are my hearts desire  
And I long to worship You
