Our Father which art in heaven in heaven  
Hallowed be Thy name  
Thy kingdom come Thy will be done  
On earth as it is in heaven

Give us this day  
Our daily bread  
And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors

And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil

For Thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory  
Forever and ever Amen Amen 2x  
Forever and ever 3x  
  
Ending  
Amen
