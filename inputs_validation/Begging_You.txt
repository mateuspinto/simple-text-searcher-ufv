Im begging you  
  
The fly on the coachwheel told me that he got it  
And he knew what to do with it everybody saw it  
Saw the dust that he made  
  
King bee in a frenzy ready to blow  
Got the horn good to go wait oh his stings all gone  
Now hes begging you begging you  
  
Here is a warning the sky will divide  
Since I took off the lid no theres nowhere to hide  
Now Im begging you begging you  
  
This is a mystery not to be solved  
But be minded like minded Im gone still Im with you  
Im begging you begging you  
  
Give it over give it over  
Give it over give it over  
Give it over give it over  
Give it over give it over  
Yeah Im begging you Im begging you  
Give it over give it over  
Give it over  
Yeah Im begging you Im begging you  
  
Weigh it and say it is it all in a name  
Does it call you or maul you and drive you insane  
Can it make you remember time is a place  
How Im begging you Im begging you  
  
The fly on the coachwheel told me that he got it  
And he knew what to do with it everybody saw it  
Saw the dust that he made  
  
Make all the dust that you can  
Make all the dust that you can  
  
King bee in a frenzy ready to blow
