And so you have come back to me  
And say the old loves growin yet  
Youve tried through all these weary years  
Youve tried to vainly to forget  
Oh no I cannot take your hand  
God never gives is back our youth  
The lovin heart you slighted then  
Was yours my friend in perfect truth  
Come close and let me see your face  
Your raven hair is tinged with snow  
Oh yes it is the same dear face  
I loved so many years ago  
Oh no I cannot take your hand  
God never gives is back our youth  
The lovin heart you slighted then  
Was yours my friend in perfect truth  
Farewell I think I love you yet  
As friend to friend God bless you dear  
And guide you through these weary years  
To where the skies are always clears  
Oh no I cannot take your hand  
God never gives is back our youth  
The lovin heart you slighted then  
Was yours my friend in perfect truth  
Oh no I cannot take your hand  
God never gives is back our youth  
The lovin heart you slighted then  
Was yours my friend in perfect truth
