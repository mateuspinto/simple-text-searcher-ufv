Raindrops falling  
Winter feels so gloomy  
Hear the knock upon my door  
Stranger calling  
Eyes that look like mine  
Said you know Ive called before  
  
What is veiled now soon will be shown  
Come walk with me through the unknown  
  
Familiar stranger  
Should I know your name  
Did we meet some time ago  
I feel uncertain  
Shadows whisper to me now  
Sudden wind begins to blow  
  
What is veiled now soon will be shown  
Come walk with me through the unknown  
  
Darkened doorways  
Strangest things can happen  
Dont know who youre talking to  
Find yourself  
When lightning strikes you now  
You could be looking back at you  
  
What is veiled now soon will be shown  
Come walk with me through the unknown  
  
What is veiled now soon will be shown  
Come walk with me through the unknown  
  
Stranger  
  
Familiar stranger  
Should I know your name  
Did we meet some time ago  
Are you someone I should know  
Did we meet sometime ago
