Her life gets smaller in his eyes  
And he wonders if he thinks he should cry  
Oh mother the colours gone and left your hair  
And he wonders if he thinks he should care  
She told him how to play a guitar  
She told him how to be a star  
But mother were you really there  
  
My friend dont speak hes such a mixed up boy  
I wonder if she sold him his toys  
A kiss on the cheek a conversation decoy  
In his cute little corduroys  
Oh she taught him how to win the game  
She taught him everything is your name  
Oh mother did you have to destroy  
Mother if you really cared  
Youd talk to him cry for him  
All you every did was dream  
All you ever said was be cool be cool be cool  
And I think you made a mess of his life  
And I think he made a mess of your life  
And I think it made a mess of my life  
  
Mother if you really cared  
Youd talk to him cry for him  
All you every did was dream  
All you ever said was be cool be cool be cool  
And I think you made a mess of her life  
And I think she made a mess of your life  
And I think it made a mess of my life  
I think you made a mess of my life  
I think you made a mess of my life
