Hey Mrs C please dont jump why not  
Nothing is making sense anymore to me  
I dont know when I stopped making him smile  
Now the kids see me crying all the time  
  
From one mother to the other  
Theyll never get over this for their lifetime  
All their wishes will be dashed upon those cliffs  
So lets be strong for you and  
Me the night is opening  
Our angels are falling and they will warm us  
She asked right now right here  
Im feeling so mad dear  
  
Maybe California  
Maybe California  
  
As mothers we have our troubles  
Youll leave them with emptiness for their lifetime  
All their wishes will be dashed upon those cliffs  
So lets be strong you and me the night is opening  
Our angels are falling and they will warm us  
She asked right now right here  
Im feeling so mad dear  
  
Maybe California  
Maybe California  
  
Until then there will be starlight shining down  
For every tear and every child
