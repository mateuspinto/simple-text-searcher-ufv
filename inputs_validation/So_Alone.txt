She calls on the phone  
She says she doesnt want to be alone  
She says its making her neurotic  
But please dont mistake it for being erotic  
  
So alone so all alone  
She says lets go for a walk  
Well have a drink and maybe we will talk  
And he thinks she has possibilities  
If she could just put away her rosary  
  
So alone nobody wants to be alone  
But I just didnt know  
I swear to you I just didnt know  
I would never make you sad  
If I had known I never would have  
Said those things to you  
You have to be crazy to say those things to you  
  
Lets face it I made a mistake  
Well you know fools rush in where angels take a break  
I cant be smart all of the time  
And anyway I didnt know you were making time over him  
  
To tell you the truth I forget all about him  
And you know I dont think its nice  
Asking one man about another mans vice  
I dont care if you pick my head  
As long as we end up in bed  
  
Alone just the two of us alone  
I just didnt know  
I swear to God I just didnt know  
Cant you understand that its frightening  
When you hear women talking about castrating and hating men  
Who wants to know about how you hate men  
  
Well you said now you wanted to dance  
So now were going to dance  
You said that you werent complete  
But were going to put you on your feet  
You said that you were very vexed  
You told me to forget about sex  
You said you liked me for my mind  
Well I really love your behind  
  
Oh get up and boogie oh baby get up and dance  
Oh get get get get up and boogie baby oh get up and dance  
Shake your booty mama oh get up and dance  
  
Your points very clear  
Youre not one to cry into your beer  
Why dont we go to my place  
Believe me Im very chaste  
And Im so alone ao all alone  
  
Sure all men are beasts  
Hey look Ill sit here quietly and Ill stare at my feet  
I dont blame you for taking umbrage  
With animals staring at your cleavage  
So alone were so all alone  
  
Hey do you mind if I turn out the light  
Dont take offense but why dont you spend the night  
I know your passions run very deep  
But at this point we both need sleep  
So alone and who wants to be alone
