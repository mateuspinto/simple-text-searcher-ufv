Would you be mine  
Would you be my baby tonight  
Could be kissing my fruit punch lips in the bright sunshine  
Cause I like you quite a lot everything you got  
Dont you know Its you that I adore  
Though I make the boys fall like dominoes  
  
Kiss me in the dark dark tonight  
Dark do it my way  
Kiss me in the park park tonight  
Park let them all say  
  
Hey Lolita hey Hey Lolita hey  
I know what the boys want Im not gonna play  
Hey Lolita hey Hey Lolita hey  
Whistle all you want but Im not gonna stay  
No more skipping rope  
Skipping heartbeats with the boys downtown  
Just you and me feeling the heat  
Even when the sun goes down  
  
I could be yours I could be your baby tonight  
Topple you down from your sky 40 stories high  
Shining like a God cant believe I caught you and so  
Look at what I bought not a second thought  oh Romeo  
  
Kiss me in the dark dark tonight  
Dark do it my way  
Kiss me in the park park tonight  
Park let them all say  
  
Hey Lolita hey Hey Lolita hey  
I know what the boys want Im not gonna play  
Hey Lolita hey Hey Lolita hey  
Whistle all you want but Im not gonna stay  
No more skipping rope  
Skipping heartbeats with the boys downtown  
Just you and me feeling the heat  
Even when the sun goes down  
  
I want my cake and I want to eat it too  
I want to have fun and be in love with you  
I know that Im a mess with my long hair  
And my suntan short dress bare feet  
I dont care what they say about  
What they say about me  
Because I know that its love  
You make me happy you make me happy  
And I never listen to anyone  
Let them all say   
  
Hey Lolita hey Hey Lolita hey  
I know what the boys want Im not gonna play  
Hey Lolita hey Hey Lolita hey  
Whistle all you want but Im not gonna stay  
No more skipping rope  
Skipping heartbeats with the boys downtown  
Just you and me feeling the heat  
Even when the sun goes down
