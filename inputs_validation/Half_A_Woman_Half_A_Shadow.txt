Daylight is breaking again  
I hide in the dark  
Im watching the rain  
Youre out of touch  
Youre out of reach  
What can I say  
I never wanted it this way  
  
Love sleeps all alone  
The cold telephone  
I know the heart  
Yes I know the kind  
The kisses of fire turning to grey  
I never wanted it this way  
I always wanted you to stay  
  
Wash my pain away cause Im half a woman half a shadow  
  
Love always change with the trees  
the spring and the leaves  
the waves on the sea  
Wilder than light the wind in your eyes led me astray  
I never wanted it this way  
I always wanted you to stay  
  
Oh I need you yes I need you  
Give me a reason to believe
