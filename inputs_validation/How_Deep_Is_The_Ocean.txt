How much do I love you  
Ill tell you no lie  
How deep is the ocean  
How high is the sky  
  
How many times a day do I think of you  
How many roses are sprinkled with dew  
  
How far would I travel  
To be where you are  
How far is the journey  
From here to a star  
  
And if I ever lost you how much would I cry  
How deep is the ocean  
How high is the sky  
  
How far would I travel  
To be where you are  
How far is the journey  
From here to a star  
  
And if I ever lost you how much would I cry  
How deep is the ocean  
How high is the sky  
How high is the sky
