Oh fuck you cant even sing  
Hey baby I like it rawww  
Yeah baby I like it raawww  
Ooh baby I like it raww  
Yeah baby I like it rawww  
Sh  
  
Shimmy shimmy ya shimmy yam shimmy yay  
Gimme the mic so I can take it away  
Off on a natural charge bon voyage  
Yeah from the home of the Dodgers Brooklyn squad  
WuTang Killerrr Bees on a swarm  
Rain on ya dollars ass disco dorm  
For you to even touch my skill  
You gotta have the one Killer Bee and he aint gonna kill Now  
My producer slam my flow is like bam  
Chop that down pass it all around  
Lyrics get hard quick cement to the ground  
For any MC in any fifty two states  
I gets psycho killerrrr Norman Bates  
My producer slam sharp like bam  
Jump on stage and then I dundaaaah  
I like the way you come  
Hey baby I like it rawww  
Yeah baby I like it rawww  
Ooh baby I like it raww  
Yeah baby I like it rawww  
  
Repeat
