Today was supposed to be  
Just another day  
Before the meeting of our minds and  
What you had to say  
Its been a long time comin and  
I guess i never saw  
Ill have a short time adjusting to it all  
  
You have come to your conclusion  
You no longer care for me  
And that we dont belong together  
I suppose we should agree  
There is nothing i can do  
Now that youve made up your mind  
But could you come back and see me sometime  
  
Chorus  
Is there any way that you could leave a little at a time  
I need the time to make adjustments of the heart and of the mind  
It might be that youll remember some old feeling left behind  
And if you do would you come back and see me sometime  
  
I am left with no defenses  
For i have no control  
And for the first time in my man wood  
Ill do what i am told  
Its all over but the leaving youre  
Determined now to do  
Ill have the burden of gettin over you  
  
Theres no need to be suspicious i have  
Nothing left to hide  
Its all out in the open i have  
Nothing left inside  
Just seeing you would be enough  
Its all i have in mind  
So could you come back see me sometime  
  
Chorus
