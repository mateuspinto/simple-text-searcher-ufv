Is there a place in your heart left for me  
Is there some space where the parkin sign says free  
Maybe theres just one little spot  
Maybe some corner that you forgot  
Is there a place in your left for me  
  
Well I know you got so many you can choose from  
Theres always flowers lyin by your door  
I betcha your phone it never stops  
Bet youre the queen at the local hops  
I bet you get valentines but never keep the score  
  
Is there a place in your heart left for me  
Is there some space where the parkin sign says free  
Maybe theres just one little spot  
Maybe some corner that you forgot  
Is there a space in your heart left for me  
  
I betcha your phone it never stops  
I know your the queen at the local hops  
I bet you get valentines but never keep the score  
  
Is there a place in your heart left for me  
Is there some space where the parkin sign says free  
Maybe theres just one little spot  
Maybe some corner that you forgot  
Is there a place in your heart made for me  
  
Is there a place in your heart made for me  
Is there a place in your heart made for me
