Have you ever felt  
That your life is a wasting  
Happiness beyond your reach  
Sweet love has gone astray  
Suddenly its bitter  
  
Hard times  
Hard times  
  
When youre all alone  
Nothing seems to matter  
Sadness always fills the air  
Hurts so deep inside  
You just have to cry out  
Wow hard times  
Wow hard times  
Wow hard times  
Wow hard times  
  
Give yourself a chance  
You have something special  
That nobody else can claim  
Deep inside your heart  
Shines a revelation  
Wow shine on  
Wow shine on  
Wow hard times  
Wow hard times
