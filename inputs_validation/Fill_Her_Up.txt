Mobil station where I stand  
This old gas pump in my hand  
My boss dont like me got a face like a weasel  
Oil on my hands and the smell of diesel  
Here comes a big shot from the city  
V8 engine she runs so pretty  
Fill her up son unleaded  
I need a full tank of gas where Im headed  
Up in the front seat a pretty red head  
Were going to Vegas were gonna get wed  
So fill her up son dont be staring  
Thats a real diamond she be wearing  
Im gonna take my baby one day  
Im gonna fill her up and head west  
Im going find some money all right  
See those tail lights heading west  
I got no money to invest  
Got no prospects no education  
I was lucky getting a job at this gas station  
That old cash box on the top shelf  
The boss is sleeping Ill just help myself  
Lets consider this as just a loan  
I can sort it out later on the phone  
Im gonna pick my girl up tonight  
Im gonna fill her up and head west  
Im gonna show her all the bright lights  
Were gonna say we lived for we come home  
And as I head through the woods on the way back  
The evening sun is slanting through the pine trees real pretty  
Its like I walked into a glade of heaven  
And theres music playing  
This money is cold in my hand  
And a voice somewhere is saying  
Why would you wanna take that stolen thing  
And what real happiness can it bring  
Youre gonna fill her up with sadness  
Youre gonna fill her up with shame  
Youre gonna fill her up with sorrow  
Before she even takes your name  
Youre gonna fill her up with madness  
Youre gonna fill her up with blame  
Youre gonna live with no tomorrow  
Youre gonna fill her up with pain  
Youre gonna fill her up with darkness  
Youre gonna fill her up with night  
You gotta fill her up with Jesus  
You gotta fill her up with light  
You gotta fill her up with spirit  
You gotta fill her up with grace  
You gotta fill her up with heaven  
You got the rest of life to face  
You gotta fill her up the right way  
You gotta fill her up with care  
You gotta fill her up with babies  
You gotta fill her up and swear  
Youre gonna love that girl forever  
Youre gonna fill her up for life  
Youre gonna be a loving husband  
Shes gonna be your loving wife  
You gotta fill her up with gladness  
You gotta fill her up with joy  
You gotta fill her up with love  
You gotta fill her up with love
