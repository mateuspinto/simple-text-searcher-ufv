Salvation spring up from the ground  
Lord rend the heavens and come down  
Seek the lost and heel the lame  
Jesus bring glory to your name  
Let all the prodigals run home  
All of creation waits and groans  
Lord weve heard of your great fame  
Father cause all to shout your name  
X2  
Stir up our hearts oh lord  
Open our spirits to know who you are  
Put a cry in us so deep inside that we cannot find the words we need  
We just weep and cry out to you  
Chorus again
