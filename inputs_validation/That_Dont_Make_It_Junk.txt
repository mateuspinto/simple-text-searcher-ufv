I fought against the bottle  
But I had to do it drunk  
Took my diamond to the pawnshop  
But that dont make it junk  
  
I know that Im forgiven  
But I dont know how I know  
I dont trust my inner feelings  
Inner feelings come and go  
  
How come you called me here tonight  
How come you bother  
With my heart at all  
You raise me up in grace  
Then you put me in a place  
Where I must fall  
  
Too late to fix another drink  
The lights are going out  
Ill listen to the darkness sing  
I know what thats about  
  
I tried to love you my way  
But I couldnt make it hold  
So I closed the Book of Longing  
And I do what I am told  
  
How come you called me here tonight  
How come you bother with my heart at all  
You raise me up in grace  
Then you put me in a place  
Where I must fall  
  
I fought against the bottle  
But I had to do it drunk  
Took my diamond to the pawnshop  
But that dont make it junk
