In my rear view mirror the sun is going down  
Sinking behind bridges in the road  
And I think of all the good things  
That we have left undone  
And I suffer premonitions  
Confirm suspicions  
Of the holocaust to come  
  
The wire that holds the cork  
That keeps the anger in  
Gives way  
And suddenly its day again  
The sun is in the east  
Even though the day is done  
Two suns in the sunset  
Hmm  
Could be the human race is run  
  
Like the moment when the brakes lock  
And you slide towards the big truck  
Oh no  
Daddy Daddy  
You stretch the frozen moments with your fear  
And youll never hear their voices  
And youll never see their faces  
You have no recourse to the law anymore  
  
And as the windshield melts  
My tears evaporate  
Leaving only charcoal to defend  
Finally I understand the feelings of the few  
Ashes and diamonds  
Foe and friend  
We were all equal in the end  
  
And now the weather Tomorrow will be cloudy with scattered showers  
Spreading from the east with an expected high of 4000 degrees  
Celsius
