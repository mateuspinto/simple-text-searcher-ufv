No standing with these burning feet  
I got to kill the the fire  
Got to kill the heat  
I see a road and a river  
I gotta go  
cause theres fire in my shoes  
And youre moving too slow  
For these burning feet  
  
I got to move  
Burning feet  
Need a cool groove  
Burning feet  
Win or lose  
Looking to kill the heat  
Oh these burning shoes  
  
One day theyll find me in pieces  
By the side of the track  
Smoke trail behind me  
Flames from my back  
This is what made me  
Yeah how I was made  
Forever in the heat  
And never in the shade  
Of these burning feet  
  
Burning feet  
I got to move  
Burning feet  
Need a cool groove  
Burning feet  
Win or lose  
Looking to kill the heat  
Oh these burning shoes
