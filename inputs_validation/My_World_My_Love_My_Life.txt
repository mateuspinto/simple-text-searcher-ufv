Some days are covered in rain  
while other days are made for glory  
And you are the summer sun  
The only one who knows the story  
  
Do you want to talk about it  I dont know  
Do you want to say some words  Oh I cant let go  
Im talking about my world my love my life  
Everytime I try to close my eyes  
you just enter my mind  
and you lay yourself down beside me oh why  
  
Some streets are covered with sweat  
there are no regrets just new connections oh why  
You are the Summer Son and im the one who wants affection  
  
Do you want to talk about it  I dont know  
Do you want to speak some words  Oh I cant let go  
Im talking about my world my love my life  
Everytime I try to close my eyes  
you just run through my head  
and you lay yourself down beside me oh why  
  
My world my life  
  
Im talking about my world my love my life  
Everytime I try to close my eyes  
You just enter my mind  
and you lay yourself down beside me oh why  
You just run through my head  
and you lay yourself down beside me oh why  
  
My world my life
