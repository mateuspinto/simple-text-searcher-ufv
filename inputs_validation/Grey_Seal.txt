Whys it never light on my lawn  
Why does it rain  
And never say goodday to the newborn  
On the big screen they showed us the sun  
But not as bright in life as the real one  
Its never quite the same as the real one  
  
And tell me grey seal  
How does it feel  
To be so wise  
To see through eyes  
That only see whats real  
Tell me grey seal  
  
I never learned why meteors were formed  
I only farmed in schools  
That were so warn and torn  
If anyone can cry then so can I  
I read books and draw life from the eye  
All my life is drawings from the eye  
  
And tell me grey seal  
How does it feel  
To be so wise  
To see through eyes  
That only see whats real  
Tell me grey seal  
  
Your mission bells were wrought by ancient men  
The roots were formed by twisted roots  
Your roots were twisted then  
I was reborn before all life could die  
The Phoenix bird will leave this world to fly  
If the Phoenix bird can fly then so can I  
  
And tell me grey seal  
How does it feel  
To be so wise  
To see through eyes  
That only see whats real  
Tell me grey seal
