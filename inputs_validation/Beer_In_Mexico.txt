Starin out into the wild blue yonder  
So many thoughts to sit and ponder  
Bout life and love and lack of  
And this emptiness in my heart  
  
Too old to be wild and free still  
Too young to be over the hill  
Should I try to grow up  
But who knows where to start  
  
Chorus  
So I just  
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico  
Do my best to waste another day  
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico  
Let the warm air melt these blues away  
  
Sun comes up and sun sinks down  
And I seen em both in this tourist town  
Up for days in a rage  
Just tryin to search my soul  
  
From the answers and the reasons why  
Im at these crossroads in my life  
And I really dont know  
Which way to go  
  
So I just  
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico  
Do my best to waste another day  
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico  
Let the warm air melt these blues away  
  
Maybe Ill settle down get married  
Or stay single and stay free  
Which road I travel  
Is still a mystery to me  
  
So I just  
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico  
Do my best to waste another day  
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico  
Let the warm air melt these blues away  
  
Down in Mexico
