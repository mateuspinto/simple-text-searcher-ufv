I want to trip inside your head  
Spend the day there  
To hear the things you havent said  
And see what you might see  
  
I want to hear you when you call  
Do you feel anything at all  
I want to see your thoughts take shape  
And walk right out  
  
Freedom has a scent  
Like the top of a new born babys head  
  
The songs are in your eyes  
I see them when you smile  
Ive seen enough Im not giving up  
On a miracle drug  
  
Of science and the human heart  
There is no limit  
There is no failure here sweetheart  
Just when you quit  
  
I am you and you are mine  
Love makes nonsense of space  
And time will disappear  
Love and logic keep us clear  
Reason is on our side love  
  
The songs are in your eyes  
I see them when you smile  
Ive had enough of romantic love  
Id give it up yeah Id give it up  
For a miracle a miracle drug a miracle drug  
  
God I need your help tonight  
  
Beneath the noise  
Below the din  
I hear your voice  
Its whispering  
In science and in medicine  
I was a stranger  
You took me in  
  
The songs are in your eyes  
I see them when you smile  
Ive had enough of romantic love  
Id give it up yeah Id give it up  
For a miracle miracle drug  
  
Miracle miracle drug
