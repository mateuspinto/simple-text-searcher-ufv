Fate took a freeway to my room  
Said to much while he stayed  
And left too soon  
Bright on an evening sea  
He washed in with the tide  
Deep in each others dreams  
Where all but dreams had died  
  
Wretched in your thoughts  
Gentle hate within the love you bought  
  
Words fade like flowers shadowed  
There beneath your wall  
Wind cries from every angle  
Dead leaves left to wait for fall  
  
And in my darkest hour  
When I can find no light  
My goals are out of sight  
And nothing warms the night  
  
I close my eyes  
And with such sweet surprise  
I can be anywhere  
I can be anyone  
  
And in my darkest hour  
When I can find no light  
My goals are out of sight  
And nothing warms the night  
  
I close my eyes  
And with such sweet surprise  
I can be anywhere  
I can be anything  
I can be anyone  
I can be anyone
