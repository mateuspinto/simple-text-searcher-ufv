Where did they go  
Where did everybody go  
I wanna know  
  
We couldve tried  
Why did everybody cry  
If you werent mine  
  
Now everything is gonna change  
Youve made your mind up Well my friend  
Youve got a lot to learn ya do  
Why do we deny ourselves  
In terms of love  
Im at a loss So well  
Oh Well oh Well  
Oh Well Oh Well  
  
Cant find the words  
But hey man everbody hurts  
When it doesnt work  
  
Now everything is gonna change  
Youve made your mind up Well my friend  
Youve got a lot to learn ya do  
Why do we deny ourselves  
In terms of love  
Im at a loss So well  
Oh Well oh Well  
Oh Well Oh Well  
  
Your love drowned us in a hole  
You never ever wanted her to grow  
To grow Oh Oh  
Why Why Why Why Why  
  
If everything is gonna change  
Was it worth it Oh my friend  
Youve got a lot to learn ya do  
Why do we deny ourselves  
In terms of love  
You werent strong enough Oh Well for me  
  
Oh Well oh Well  
Oh Well Oh Well
