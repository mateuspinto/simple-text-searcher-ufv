Hello fear  
Before you sit down theres something I need to explain  
Since youre here  
I think I should tell you since we last talked things have changed  
See Im tired of being brokenhearted  
So I made a list and youre on it  
All my hopes and my dreams you took from me  
I want those back before you leave  
  
Hello fear  
I knew I would see you  
You have a hard time letting go  
See these tears  
Take a good look cause soon they wont fall anymore  
Gods healing my hurtful places  
That seat that was yours now is taken  
Im no longer afraid see Im better this way  
And one more thing before you leave  
  
Chorus  
Never again will I love you  
My heart it refuses to be your home  
No longer your prisoner  
Today I remember  
Apart from you is where I belong  
And never again will I trust you  
Im tired of fighting its been way too long  
No longer your prisoner  
Today I remember  
Who I was and now its gone  
  
Theyre gone hello fear  
Da da da da da da da da da da da da  
  
Farewell goodbye so long  
Farewell goodbye so long  
Farewell goodbye so long  
  
Hello grace  
It feels like forever I thought my chance with you was gone  
See your face it reminds me of mercy  
And please let me say I was wrong  
Never knew your touch was endless  
How you never run dry of forgiveness  
Didnt know how bad it was was afraid just because  
Sorry fear grace took your place  
  
Chorus  
  
Farewell goodbye so long  
Farewell goodbye so long  
Farewell goodbye so long  
Farewell goodbye so long  
Farewell goodbye so long  
Farewell goodbye so long  
Farewell goodbye so long  
  
Hello fear  
Before you sit down theres something I need to explain
