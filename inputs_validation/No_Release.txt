Through the smoke of dancers move  
Demonic dirty downtown groove  
Visions of the day retreat  
Come on baby feel the heat  
  
Then I can disappear  
And be at peace  
But when my mind is clear  
I cant get no release  
  
In the dark the dancers shout  
Scream the cry of freedom out  
Strobe crescendos in the night  
Minds take cover souls take flight  
  
Oh let me disappear  
Set me free set me free  
But when my mind is clear  
I cant get no release  
  
Set me free set me free baby  
Well I can feel it yeah  
I can feel it feel it feel it feel it
