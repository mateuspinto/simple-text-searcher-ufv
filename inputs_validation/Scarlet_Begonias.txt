As I was walkin down rubadub square  
Not a chill to the window but a little to the air  
From another direction she was calling my eye  
It could be an illusion but I might as well try  
Might as well try  
  
She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes  
And I knew without asking she was into the blues  
She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls  
I knew right away she was not like other girls like other girls  
  
Well I aint never been right as I aint never been wrong  
As everything works out the way it does in this song  
Cause once in a while you get shown in the light  
In the strangest of places if you look at it right  
  
It was the summer of love and I thank the stars above  
Because the women took a lovin over me  
And just to gain her trust I bought a microbus  
Because I sold off all my personal property  
  
A tietiedyed dress she was a psychedelic mess  
We toured to the north south east and west  
We sold some mushroom tea  
We sold some ecstasy  
We sold nitrous opium acid heroin and PCP  
And now I hear the police coming after me  
Yes now I hear the police coming after me  
The one scarlet with the flowers in her hair  
Shes got the police coming after me  
  
Well there aint nothing wrong with the way she moves  
All scarlet begonias and a touch of the blues  
And there aint nothin wrong with the love thats in her eyes  
I had to learn the hard way just to let her pass by let her pass by  
Oh just let her pass by
