Felt a pang late one afternoon  
I was fishin off Muir beach  
With Larry Lelonde  
Grabbed a tuna salad sandwich  
And I started to chew  
Pretty soon Lers yellin  
Fish on Fish on  
  
I was just a little pup  
And it was derby day  
Was dad and me and Darrell  
Out in San Pablo bay  
Taco flavored Doritos  
And my orange life vest  
Dad caught a hundred pound sturgeon  
On twentypound test  
Now he fought that fish for an hour  
And a half  
Darrelld say Jump ya sons a bitch  
And he grabbed for the gaff  
When we got him in the boat  
He measured six feet long  
I was so danged impressed I had  
To write a song called  
Fish on  
  
Twas a bright and sunny day  
It was me and Todd Huth  
Fishin shark Stingray  
Out of Bohuas Lagoon  
Well hey hey hey Ill be screwed  
Blued and tatooed  
Looks like I got me one of them fish on  
Fish on
