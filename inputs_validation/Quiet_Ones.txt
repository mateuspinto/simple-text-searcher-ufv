Its always the quiet ones  
Who are stranger than fiction  
They hide under tables like a child  
  
What kind of chemistry is it  
Leaden or golden  
Nobody sees them driving us wild  
  
Its your life  
Dont just collide with the waves  
  
Oh look into her eyes  
Youll see such silent calling  
Nothing seems to matter in this life  
  
Wake up your majesty there are  
Thieves in the temple  
Picking the sunspots out of the sun  
  
Looking for symmetry in man  
Another dead Beetle  
Down through the path we see how they run  
  
Its your life  
Dont just collide with the ways  
  
Oh look into her eyes  
Youll see such silent calling  
Nothing seems to matter in this life  
  
Oh so many reasons why  
You hear the silence calling  
Nothing seems to matter in this life  
  
Oh salvation shine a light on a different world  
And carry out thoughts on golden rays
