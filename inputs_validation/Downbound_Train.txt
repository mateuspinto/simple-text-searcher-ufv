A stranger lying on a bar room floor  
Had drank so much he could drink no more  
And so he fell asleep with a troubled brain  
To dream that he rode on that down bound train  
  
The engine with blood was sweaty and damp  
And brilliantly lit with a brimstone lamp  
And imps for fuel was shovelling bones  
While the furnace rang with a thousand groans  
  
The boiler was filled with lots of beer  
The devil himself was the engineer  
The passengers were most a motley crew  
Some were foreigners and others he knew  
  
Rich men and lost beggars in rags  
Handsome young ladies and wicked old hags  
As the train rushed on at a terrible pace  
Sulphuric fumes scorched their hands and face  
  
Wider and wider the country grew  
Faster and faster the engine flew  
Louder and louder the thunder crashed  
Brighter and brighter the lighting flashed  
  
Hotter and hotter the air became  
Til their clothes were burned with each quivering refrain  
Then out of the din there came a yell  
Ha ha said the devil were nearing home  
  
Oh how the passengers shrieked with pain  
They go to Satan with this down bound train  
The stranger awoke with an anguished cry  
His clothes wet with sweat and his hair standing high  
  
He fell on his knees on the bar room floor  
And prayed a prayer like never before  
And the prayers and vows were not in vain  
For he never rode that down bound train
