What ever happened to Saturday night  
When you dressed up sharp and you felt alright  
It dont seem the same since cosmic light  
Came into my life I thought I was divine  
I used to go for a ride with a chick whod go  
And listen to the music on the radio  
A saxophone was blowing on a Rock and Roll show  
We climbed in the back seat really had a good time  
  
Hot patootie bless my soul  
Really love that Rock and Roll  
Hot patootie bless my soul  
I really love that Rock and Roll  
Hot patootie bless my soul  
I really love that Rock and Roll  
Hot patootie bless my soul  
I really love that Rock and Roll  
  
Saxophone solo  
  
My head used to swim from the perfume I smelled  
My hands kinda fumbled with her white plastic belt  
Id taste her baby pink lipstick and thats when Id melt  
Shed whisper in my ear tonight she really was mine  
Get back in front and put some hair oil on  
Buddy Holly was singing his very last song  
With your arms around your girl you try to sing along  
It felt pretty good woo  
Really had a good time  
  
Hot patootie bless my soul  
Really love that Rock and Roll  
Hot patootie bless my soul  
I really love that Rock and Roll  
Hot patootie bless my soul  
I really love that Rock and Roll  
Hot patootie bless my soul  
I really love that Rock and Roll  
  
Saxophone solo  
  
Hot patootie bless my soul  
I really love that Rock and Roll  
Hot patootie bless my soul  
I really love that Rock and Roll  
Hot patootie bless my soul  
I really love that Rock and Roll  
Hot patootie bless my soul  
I really love that Rock and Roll  
Hot patootie bless my soul  
I really love that Rock and Roll  
Hot patootie bless my soul  
I really love that Rock and Roll  
Hot patootie bless my soul  
I really love that Rock and Roll  
Hot patootie bless my soul  
I really love that Rock and Roll
