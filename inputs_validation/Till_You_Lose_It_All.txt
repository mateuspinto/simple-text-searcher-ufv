We take a lot of things for granted  
One day it ll be taken away  
That s when you ll realize  
How important it was  
You never miss your water  
Till your well runs dry  
Give thanks and praise all the time  
The wolf is always by the door  
  
Chorus  
You don t know what you ve got  
Till you lose it all again  
You never miss your water  
Till your well runs dry  
  
He s a hero now that he s dead  
Oh what a bull preacher man talks about him  
When he was alive  
He didnt even know his name  
When he was alive  
He didnt get this love  
You never miss your water  
Till your well runs dry  
  
Chorus  
You don t know what you ve got  
Till you lose it again  
You never lose your water  
Till your well runs dry
