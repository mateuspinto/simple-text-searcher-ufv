Thats what we want  
Spiritual love spiritual love spiritual love  
Thats what we want  
Spiritual love thats what we want  
Spiritual love thats what we need  
Spiritual love thats what we always wanted  
Spiritual love spiritual love  
And were living in a waste land with a cancer  
So deep rooted in the hearts of all men  
Whatwe need is a little miracle  
Well here is comes  
Spiritual love ah the spiritual love  
Spiritual love for the good of man  
Spiritual love we want a spiritual love  
Spiritual love for the spirit of the man  
Spiritual love in this world full of politics  
Spiritual love in a world full of leaders  
Spiritual love we want a spiritual love  
Spiritual love we want a spiritual love  
And he said I love you  
And I said I love you too  
To free the world its an emotion away  
To free the world you must free your mind  
To free the world in an emotional way  
To free the world from the blind leading the blind  
Spiritual love ah spiritual love  
Spiritual love we want a spiritual love  
Spiritual love sing it loud for the spiritual love  
Spiritual love thats what we want  
To all my enemies  
To the power crazed dictators  
To all the far flung legionnaires  
To all the empty cynics  
To all the negative forces in the world  
To the nonbelievers  
To the corporation owners  
To their guilt ridden sleepless nights  
From the seven oceans poetic license  
From the beautiful mountains  
From the birds in the sky  
From the animal kingdom
