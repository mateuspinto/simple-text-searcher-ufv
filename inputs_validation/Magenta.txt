Longing for winter  
Longing for cold  
Bike ride through the snow  
Blinded by darkness  
Summer flows to the cemetery slow  
  
Pink versus black  
Black versus magenta  
This picture of you  
Just melts in my agenda  
While seasons change you know  
Yes the season change you know  
With the flow  
  
Days just shorten  
Days just glow  
This fire keeps us warm  
While this storm will uncover  
Our secret place called  
The cemetery dawn  
  
Pink versus black  
Black versus magenta  
This picture of you  
Just melts in my agenda  
While seasons change you know  
Yes season change you know  
With the flow
