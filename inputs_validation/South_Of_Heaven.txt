An unforeseen future nestled somewhere in time  
Unsuspecting victims no warnings no signs  
Judgment day the second coming arrives  
Before you see the light you must die  
  
Forgotten children conform a new faith  
Avidity and lust controlled by hate  
The Never ending search for your shattered sanity  
Souls of Damnation in their own reality  
  
Chaos rampant  
An age of distrust  
Confrontations  
Impulsive habitat  
  
Bastard sons beget your cunting daughters  
Promiscuous mothers with your incestuous fathers  
Engreat souls condemned for all eternity  
Sustained by immoral observance a domineering deity  
  
Chaos rampant  
An age of distrust  
Confrontations  
Impulsive sabbath  
  
On and on south of heaven  
On and on south of heaven  
On and on south of heaven  
On and on south of heaven  
  
The root of all evil is the heart of a black soul  
A force that has lived all eternity  
A never ending search for a truth never told  
The loss of all hope and your dignity  
  
Chaos rampant  
An age of distrust  
Confrontations  
Impulsive habitat  
  
On and on south of heaven  
On and on south of heaven  
On and on south of heaven  
On and on south of heaven
