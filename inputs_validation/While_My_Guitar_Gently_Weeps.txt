I look at you all see the love there thats sleeping  
While my guitar gently weeps  
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping  
Still my guitar gently weeps  
I dont know how nobody told you how to unfold your love  
I dont know how someone controlled you  
They bought and sold you  
I look at the world and I notice its turning  
While my guitar gently weeps  
With every mistake we must surely be learning  
Still my guitar gently weeps  
  
I dont know how you were diverted  
You were perverted too  
I dont know how you were inverted  
No one alerted you  
  
I look at you all I see the love there thats sleeping  
While my guitar gently weeps  
Look at you all  
Still my guitar gently weeps
