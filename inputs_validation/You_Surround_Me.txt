Dont ever let me take you for granted  
Youve got your finger on the pulse of my soul  
Let me place a kiss in the small of your back  
Love and protect you from the evils of this world  
  
Oh baby dont ever leave me stranded  
Whoever said that the streets were paved with gold  
Well Im afraid that were all sadly mistaken  
Theres nothing here til you have someone to hold  
  
I love you with all the joy of living  
Til the lights go down in New York City  
Its a special love affair  
And theres magic in the air  
  
You gotta shake me down  
Bring me round to my senses  
Til Im lost and found  
And surround me with your senses  
  
If love wasnt here would we reinvent it  
Oh take me down to the very root of my soul  
Oh baby say it as if you really mean it  
And feel the passion work its way up through your skin  
  
I love you with all the joy of living  
Til the lights go down in New York City  
Its a special love affair  
And theres magic in the air  
  
You gotta shake me down  
Bring me round to my senses  
Til Im lost and found  
And surround me with your senses  
  
Let me take you by the hand  
And we can go and find a brand new world  
Starlight  star bright  
  
Let me take you by the hand  
And lead you to a safe place in this world  
  
You gotta shake me down  
Bring me round to my senses  
Til Im lost and found  
And surround me with your senses  
  
You gotta shake me down  
Bring me round to my senses  
Til Im lost and found  
And surround me with your senses  
  
You gotta shake me down  
Bring me round to my senses  
Til Im lost and found  
And surround me with your senses  
  
You gotta shake me down  
Bring me round to my senses  
Til Im lost and found  
And surround me with your senses  
  
You gotta shake me down  
Bring me round to my senses  
Til Im lost and found  
And surround me with your senses  
  
You gotta shake me down  
Bring me round to my senses  
Til Im lost and found  
And surround me with your senses
