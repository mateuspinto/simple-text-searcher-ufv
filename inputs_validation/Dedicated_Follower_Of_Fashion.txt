They seek him here they seek him there  
His clothes are loud but never square  
It will make or break him so hes got to buy the best  
Cause hes a dedicated follower of fashion  
  
And when he does his little rounds  
Round the boutiques of London Town  
Eagerly pursuing all the latest fads and trends  
Cause hes a dedicated follower of fashion  
  
Oh yes he is oh yes he is oh yes he is oh yes he is  
He thinks he is a flower to be looked at  
And when he pulls his frilly nylon panties right up tight  
He feels a dedicated follower of fashion  
  
Oh yes he is oh yes he is oh yes he is oh yes he is  
Theres one thing that he loves and that is flattery  
One week hes in polkadots the next week he is in stripes  
Cause hes a dedicated follower of fashion  
  
They seek him here they seek him there  
In Regent Street and Leicester Square  
Everywhere the Carnabetian army marches on  
Each one an dedicated follower of fashion  
  
Oh yes he is oh yes he is oh yes he is oh yes he is  
His world is built round discotheques and parties  
This pleasureseeking individual always looks his best  
Cause hes a dedicated follower of fashion  
  
Oh yes he is oh yes he is oh yes he is oh yes he is  
He flits from shop to shop just like a butterfly  
In matters of the cloth he is as fickle as can be  
Cause hes a dedicated follower of fashion  
Hes a dedicated follower of fashion  
Hes a dedicated follower of fashion
