Were you there when they crucified my Lord  
Were you there when they crucified my Lord  
Sometimes it causes me to tremble tremble  
Were you there when they crucified my Lord  
  
And were you there when they laid Him in the tomb  
Were you there when they laid His precious body in the tomb  
Sometimes it causes me to tremble I cry and I tremble  
Were you there when they laid Him in the tomb  
  
Were you there when He rose from the grave  
Were you there when my Jesus rose from the grave  
Sometimes it makes me want to shout  
And I cry and I begin to tremble I tremble  
Were you there when He rose from the grave
