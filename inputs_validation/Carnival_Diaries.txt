What would you sacrifice for reality  
Is it important what we used to be  
  
Looks like I got here first  
Offer a king and Ill invite you in  
Spend carnival money  
Because tomorrow wont be as sunny  
  
Praise you  
I cant change you  
When I try to  
  
Above it all  
We end up somewhere  
If were equal  
We could go far  
Dim the lights  
Were everything  
The day we try to bend it  
We fall like any other star  
  
Would you save this moment for another day  
If youre told maybe and thats all the say  
  
Cross the waters to the silent  
Focus on love  
A golden dove  
Wake up to a new day  
Lets climb to the top
