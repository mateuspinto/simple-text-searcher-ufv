VERSE 1  
Jesus this life is for You  
Everything Lord that I do  
Deeds that are pleasing  
And ways that are pure  
Lord make my life bear this fruit  
  
CHORUS  
This means I love You  
Singing this song  
Lord I dont have the words  
But I do have the will  
This means I love You  
That I take up my cross  
I will sing as I walk out this love  
  
VERSE 2  
For these are the plans of my heart  
Yet often Im missing the mark  
See my desire to live in Your truth  
This surely means I love You
