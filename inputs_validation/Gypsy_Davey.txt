Traditional arranged and adapted by Arlo Guthrie  
  
It was late last night when the boss came home  
Asking about his lady  
The only answer that he got was  
Shes gone with the Gypsy Davey  
Gone with the Gypsy Dave  
  
Go saddle me up my buckskin home  
And my hundred dollar saddle  
Point out to me their wagon tracks  
And after them Ill travel and after them lll ride  
  
Well I had not rode till the midnight moon  
I saw their campfire gleaming  
I heard the notes of the big guitar  
And the voice of the Gypsies singing  
That song of the Gypsy Dave  
  
It was there in the light of the camping fire  
I saw her fair face beaming  
Her heart in tune to the big guitar  
And the song of the gypsies singing  
That song of the Gypsy Dave  
  
Have you forsaken your house and home  
Have you forsaken your baby  
Have you forsaken your husband dear  
To go with the Gypsy Davey  
And sing with the Gypsy Davey  
The song of the Gypsy Dave  
  
Yes Ive forsaken my husband dear  
To go with the Gypsy Davey  
And Ive forsaken my mansion high  
But not my blue eyed baby  
Not my blue eyed babe  
  
She smiled to leave her husband dear  
To go with the Gypsy Davey  
But the tears come atrickling down her cheeks  
To think about her blue eyed baby  
To think about her blue eyed babe  
  
Take off take off those buckskin gloves  
Made of Spanish leather  
Come give to me your lilywhite hand  
And well ride home together  
And home again well ride  
  
No I wont take off my buckskin gloves  
Made of Spanish leather  
Ill go my way from day to day  
And sing with the Gypsy Davey  
The song of the Gypsy Davey  
The song of the Gypsy Dave
