When I was a young man just barely fourteen  
Craving adventure and lore  
I boarded a clipper me dad was the skipper  
And sailed it along the French Shore yeah  
We sailed all along the French Shore  
  
What beautiful vessels were sailing back then  
All bound for the North Labrador  
And so for that reason they came here that season  
To sail all along the French Shore yeah  
To sail all along the French Shore  
  
On each ship a maiden was hired to cook  
A beautiful girl to adore  
So young and cavorting all ready for courting  
While sailing along the French Shore yeah  
While sailing along the French Shore  
  
Being too young for courting I soon did decide  
To spy on the lovers on shore  
I spied on a couple so loving and supple  
While sailing along the French Shore yeah  
While sailing along the French Shore  
  
Theyre actions peculiar appeared to me then  
But now theyre not funny no more  
They were hugging and kissing  
Oh what Ive been missing  
While sailing along the French Shore yeah  
While sailing along sailing along  
Sailing along the French Shore  
  
That couple has children now married I know  
You see theyre not young anymore  
Still yet they dont know  
How I witnessed the show that they played  
All along the French Shore yeah  
They played along the French Shore  
  
That ends the story of my bonny days  
Would that I could live them once more  
And this much I know Id produce my own show  
And Id stage it along the French Shore yeah  
While sailing along sailing along  
While sailing along sailing along  
While sailing along the French Shore
