Crime in the streets  
I read about it everyday in the papers  
Justice needs and justice wants  
But just in times yes too late here  
Feels like I wasnt born there  
I feel just like a Boogie Pilgrim  
  
Boogie Pilgrim  
Hustled to get it  
To get it together  
Down on the jive talk  
Down on the weather  
Boogie Pilgrim  
Brother I never felt better  
No I never felt better  
  
Low lifes complete  
When youve lived that way out on the sidewalk  
Walking on the sidewalk everyday  
I got the speed if you got the need  
But the need in me needs nothing  
But you know that I need nothing  
But I know that you all want something  
Just like Boogie Pilgrim
