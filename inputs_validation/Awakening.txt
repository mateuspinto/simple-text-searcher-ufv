Bottoms up tonight I drink to you and I  
Cause with the morning comes the rest of my life  
And with this empty glass I will break the past  
Cause with the morning I can open my eyes  
I want this to be my awakening  
  
I give this one to you an anthem full of truth  
I tell you now an epic tail of what you put me through  
And even though you dont deserve one of your own  
A melody a song about the life that you let go  
I cant believe that I still care enough to write  
  
Bottoms up tonight I drink to you and I  
Cause with the morning comes the rest of my life  
And with this empty glass I will break the past  
Cause with the morning I can open my eyes  
I want this to be my awakening  
  
Yes I miss you still and probably always will  
Im living with a busted heart that I will have until  
I find the strength I know its somewhere in my bones  
To pull the curtain up again and get on with this show  
At least you know that I care enough to write  
  
Bottoms up tonight I drink to you and I  
Cause with the morning comes the rest of my life  
And with this empty glass I will break the past  
Cause with the morning I can open my eyes  
And maybe I will see a different destiny  
Like knowing you at all was only a bad dream  
I want this to be my awakening  
  
No rest for the wicked they say  
Forgive me if I try to change  
No rest for the wicked they say  
Forgive me if I try to change  
  
Bottoms up tonight I drink to you and I  
Cause with the morning comes the rest of my life  
And with this empty glass I will break the past  
Cause with the morning I can open my eyes  
And maybe I will see a different destiny  
Like knowing you at all was only a bad dream  
I want this to be my awakening
