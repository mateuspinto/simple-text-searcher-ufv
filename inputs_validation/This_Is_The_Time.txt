We walked on the beach beside that old hotel  
Theyre tearing it down now  
But its just as well  
I havent shown you everything a man can do  
So stay with me baby  
Ive got plans for you  
  
This is the time to remember  
Cause it will not last forever  
These are the days  
To hold on to  
Cause we wont  
Although well want to  
This is the time  
But time is gonna change  
Youve given me the best of you  
And now I need the rest of you  
  
Did you know that before you came into my life  
It was some kind of miracle that I survived  
Some day we will both look back  
And have to laugh  
We lived through a lifetime  
And the aftermath  
  
This is the time to remember  
Cause it will not last forever  
These are the days  
To hold on to  
Cause we wont  
Although we want to  
This is the time  
But time is gonna change  
I know weve got to move somehow  
But I dont want to lose you know  
  
Sometimes its so easy  
To let a day  
Slip on by  
Without even seeing each other at all  
But this is the time youll turn back and so will I  
And those will be the days you can never recall  
  
And so we embrace again  
Behind the dunes  
This beach is cold  
On winter afternoons  
But holding you close is like holding the summer sun  
Im warm from the memory of days to come  
  
This is the time to remember  
Cause it will not last forever  
These are the days  
To hold on to  
But we wont  
Although well want to  
This is the time  
But time is gonna change  
Youve given me the best of you  
But now I need the rest of you
