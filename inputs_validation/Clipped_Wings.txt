Sunny days I promised you  
Lifes window pane  
With a perfect view  
A vow to love unconditional  
Be there for you all season  
  
And I never meant to clip your wings oh my love  
And I never meant to clip your wings oh my love  
Baby I never meant to clip your wings ooh baby  
Now Im wishing you  
You would fly right back to me yeah  
  
I made a vow to walk with you  
Through anything life puts you through  
Told you the world is yours and everything in it  
Then took your heart for granted  
  
And baby I never meant to clip your wings never  
Baby I never meant to clip your wings  
Baby I never meant to clip your wings  
Now Im wishing you  
You could fly right back to me yeah  
  
I was your eagle you were my dove yeah  
And nothing would come between us no no no  
Now the fun and laughter going to the park  
And all the pictures we took  
Now its all gone away  
  
And baby I never meant to clip your wings oh baby  
I never meant to clip your wings oh my love  
And baby I I never meant to clip your wings  
Now Im wishing you  
You could fly right back to me yeah  
  
Baby baby baby baby  
I never meant to clip your wings oh my love  
Baby girl I never  
Meant to clip the wings of an angel  
When I was supposed to love you baby  
For eternity  
Now Im wishing you  
You could fly right back to me yeah
