So this is Christmas and what have you done  
Another year over a new one just begun  
  
And so this is Christmas I hope you have fun  
The near and the dear ones the old and the young  
  
A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year  
Lets hope its a good one without any fears  
  
And so this is Christmas for weak and for strong  
The rich and the poor ones the road is so long  
  
And so happy Christmas for black and for white  
For the yellow and red ones lets stop all the fights  
  
A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year  
Lets hope its a good one without any fear  
  
And so this is Christmas and what have we done  
Another year over a new one just begun  
  
And so happy Christmas we hope you have fun  
The near and the dear ones the old and the young  
  
A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year  
Lets hope its a good one without any fear  
  
War is over if you want it war is over now
