Time time and again I see you staring down at me  
Now then and again I wonder what it is that you see  
with those Angry Eyes  
Well I bet you wish you could cut me down  
With those Angry Eyes  
  
You want to believe that I am not the same as you  
And now I cant conceive oh Lord of what it is youre trying to do  
with those Angry Eyes  
Well I bet you wish you could cut me down  
with those Angry Eyes  
What a shot you could be if you could shoot at me  
With those Angry Eyes  
  
You and I must start to realize  
Blindness binds us in a false disguise  
Can you see me through those Angry Eyes  
  
You try to defend that you are not the one to blame  
But Im finding it hard my friend when I m in the deadly aim  
Of those Angry Eyes  
Well I bet you wish you could cut me down  
With those Angry Eyes  
What a shot you could be if you could shoot at me  
With those Angry Eyes
