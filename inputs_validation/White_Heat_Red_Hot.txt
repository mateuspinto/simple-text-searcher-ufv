The fathers son thy kingdom come electric ecstasy  
Deliver us from all the fuss and give us sanctuary  
Lead us all into arena magnificent in death  
Well let us serenade the sinner well follow in his step  
  
White heat red hot burns deep white heat red hot  
The fury songs venomous wrongs so rich in tragedy  
An overture forever more to senseless victories  
Give to us this day of glory the power and the kill  
So we avoid the wrath and all the almighty fire of  
  
White heat red hot burns deep white heat red hot  
The heats hot burns a lot  
Who are not cut out to fight this day will surely fall  
The few who stand to take command forever and ever are men  
  
Prepare to fight unsheathe your scythe a ghastly beam of ill  
To slice the life with blinding light and seventh dimensional skill  
The centuries of dedication inherited till at last  
From years of solar gladiation can only end in  
  
White heat red hot burns deep white heat red hot  
The heats hot burns a lot  
Who are not cut out to fight this day will surely fall  
The few who stand to take command forever and ever are men  
  
White heat  
Red hot  
White heat  
Red hot
