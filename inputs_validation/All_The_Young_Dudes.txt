Mott the Hoople cover  
  
Billy rapped all night about his suicide  
How hed kick it in the head when he was 25  
Sweet guy dont wanna stay alive when youre 25  
  
Wendys stealing clothes from marks and sparks  
Freddys got spots from ripping off stars from his face  
Funky little boat race  
The television man is crazy  
Saying were juvenile delinquent wrecks  
Oh man I need tv when Ive got T Rex

Now jimmy looking sweet though he dresses like a queen  
He can kick like a mule  
Its a real mean team  
We can love  
We can love  
And my brothers back at home  
With his beatles and his stones  
We never got if off on that revolution stuff  
It was such a drag too many snags  
Well I drunk a lot of wine  
And Im feeling fine  
Gonna race some cat to bed  
Is this concrete all around me or is it in my head
