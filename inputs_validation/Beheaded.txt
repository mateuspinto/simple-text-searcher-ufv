Mommy doesnt have a head any more  
Keep it underneath my bed on the floor  
Well thats alright thats OK  
She never really used her head anyway  
  
Daddy called me a silly bore  
Bet he wont say that any more  
Because the way his body is severed too  
His vocal chords are gonna be hard to use  
  
Beheaded watch you spurt like a garden hose  
Beheaded bloody mess all over my clothes  
  
Watch my girl friend come to the door  
Chop off her head she falls to the floor  
Now watching my babys jugular flow  
Really makes my motor go  
  
Wrap a towel round the bloody stump  
Take my babys body to the city dump  
Then wipe the mess off the bloody axe  
Scoop all the heads into my burlap sack  
  
Beheaded watch her spurt like a garden hose  
Beheaded bloody mess all over my clothes  
  
All my collection adorns my room on bamboo poles  
Use to be a little but a little got more and more  
Now Im craving yours  
  
Night brings bad dreams bad dreams and guillotines  
  
Off with her head  
Off with her head  
Off with her head  
Off with her head  
Off with her head  
Off with her head  
  
Find another victim for my machine  
Put him in a homemade guillotine  
Blade falls gonna need a casket  
Watch your head plop in a wicker basket  
  
Leave the house at a quarter to four  
Come back with sixteen or more  
Cause the more I want the more I see  
I got a funny feeling coming over me  
  
Beheaded watch you spurt like a garden hose  
Beheaded bloody mess all over my clothes
