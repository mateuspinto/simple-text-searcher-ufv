Looking at the news today is a cold depressing thing we see our nation stained  
And the whole worlds up in flames People starving all over the land what a
low  
Down dirty shame and abroad we see the same we have our selves to blame Well  
Its been said that we should share what the master gives to us well the time  
Has come to help someone less fortunate than us  
chorus  
Save the world feed the hungry people clothe the little babies lend a  
Helping hand  
Save the world feed the hungry people show them we love and care  
I took a walk into town this morning a beggar followed me he said he needed  
Food to eat and spare some change please I took him into the closest grill
and  
Paid for all he could eat it warmed my heart as he said thank you maam to me  
Well it saddened me as walked a little further just to see that there is more  
Than one on every corner without a place to sleep  
chorus  
Weve got to feed the hungry mind soul and body shelter feed and cloth
everybody  
With much as we can please stretch out your hand  
chorus
