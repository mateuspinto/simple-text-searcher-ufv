Nobody feel no way  
Its coming close to payday I say  
Nobody feel no way  
Everyman get paid a quotas work this day  
CHORUS 2x  
Can I plant peas and reap rice  
Can I plant cocoa and reap yam  
Can I plant turnip and reap tomato  
Can I plant breadfruit and reap potato  
CHORUS  
Can I tell lie and hear truth  
Can I live bad and love good  
Can I deliver and get down  
Can I give a dollar and want a pound  
CHORUS  
Can I be wrong and get right  
Can I be kicked and dont fight  
Can I drink water and get drunk  
Can I drink whiskey and stay sober
