I have fallen from grace and my ashes are scattered  
No longer a passion and flesh  
My flame is alive though my wings have been shattered  
They laid my body to rest  
  
My spirit is breathing my senses are pure  
Like reincarnation my soul will endure  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Back on earth  
Back on earth  
Back on earth  
The spirit it never lets go  
  
Like fountains of sorrow the faces are crying  
Im witnessing all of their pain  
Death is so final for only the living  
The spirit will always remain  
  
Bury me deep just to cover my sins  
My soul is redeemed as the journey begins  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Back on earth  
Back on earth  
Back on earth  
The spirit it never lets go  
  
ah ah ah ah  
ah ah ah ah  
  
Another dimension a river of light  
Im twisting Im turning my soul is entwined  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Back on earth you thrill me  
Back on earth reveal me  
Back on earth still breathing  
Back on earth release me  
Back on earth you thrill me  
Back on earth reveal me
