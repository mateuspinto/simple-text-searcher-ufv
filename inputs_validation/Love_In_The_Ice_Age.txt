Its a cold world that we live in all the people say  
That this world is gettin colder day by day  
Too little warmth left in our lives  
I dont know if what the people say is true  
But I noticed theres a change in you  
Too little warmth left in your eyes  
  
I am freezing no love in this ice age  
Whoa whoa  
I am freezing theres no love in this ice age  
Whoa whoa  
  
There is friction without fire when the passions spent  
As we shiver in the winter of our discontent  
So little love left in our lives  
  
Now were standing in the shadows of a fading sun  
Words like weapons the cold war touches everyone  
So little love left in our eyes  
  
I am freezing no love in this ice age  
Whoa whoa  
I am freezing theres no love in this ice age  
Whoa whoa  
  
Feeling the chill that comes with the pain  
Love in the ice age  
  
I am freezing no love in this ice age  
Whoa whoa  
I am freezing theres no love in this ice age  
Whoa whoa  
Whoa whoa  
Whoa whoa
