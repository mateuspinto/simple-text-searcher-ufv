Do you want to drive to ride mount on your pony  
Loosen up my tie to help me breathe  
Insisting that I pay my alimony  
Each and every day is the same old scene  
  
Come on do the roll do the roll with me  
Come on do the roll do the roll with me  
I said honey I said honey  
I said honey I said honey  
Come on do the honey roll with me  
  
Well I want to say that Im your mister funky  
Singing this song is taking up your time  
I did the donkey now Im your funky monkey  
Sing it children sing it on your mind
