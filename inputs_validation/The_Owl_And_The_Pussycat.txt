The owl and the pussy cat went to sea in a beautiful  
Pea green boat they took some honey and plenty of money  
Wrapped up in a five pound note  
The owl looked up to the stars above  
And sang from a small guitar  
Oh lovely pussy oh pussy my love  
What a beautiful pussy you are you are what a beautiful  
Pussy you are So they sailed away for a year and a  
Day to the land where the palm trees grow  
And there in a wood a piggy wig stood with a ring on  
The end of his nose his nose a ring on the end of his  
Nose Dear pig are you willing to sell for one shilling  
Your ring Said the piggy I will  
So they took it away and were married nest day by the  
Turkey who lived on the hill  
The dined on mince and slices of quince which they  
Ate with an runcible spoon and hand in hand by the  
Edge of the sand they dance in the light of the moon  
The moon they danced in the light of the moon
