And now the purple dusk of twilight time  
Steals across the meadow of my heart  
Love is now the stardust of yesterday  
The music of the years gone by  
  
Sometimes I wonder why I spend the lonely nights  
Dreaming of a song  
The melody haunts my reverie  
And I am once again with you  
When our love was new  
And each kiss an inspiration  
  
But that was long ago  
And now my consolation  
Is in the stardust of a song  
  
Beside a garden wall where stars are bright  
You are in my arms  
A nightingale sings its fairy tale  
Of paradise where roses bloom  
  
Though I dream in vain  
In my heart it will remain  
That stardust melody  
The memory of loves refrain
