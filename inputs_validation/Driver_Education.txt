I fell for guys who tried to commit suicide  
With soft rock hair and blood shot eyes  
He tastes like Marlboro cigarettes Reeses Peanut Butter Cups  
A Pepsi in his hand getting off the school bus  
  
Films and drills and safety illustrations  
The crushed cars of driver education  
  
Now its tattooed girls with a past they cant remember  
Who pledged allegiance to a life of bending the curriculum  
She tastes like spring there she goes again  
Drinking with the older guys tripping by the lakeside  
  
Films and drills and safety illustrations  
The crushed cars of driver education  
  
When you were sweet sixteen I was already mean and  
Feeling bad for giving it up to the man just to make the scene  
Where were you back when I had something to prove  
With the switchblade set and the church kids learning my moves  
  
I ran for miles through the suburbs of the seventies  
Pollen dust and Pixie sticks kissing in the deep end  
Of swimming pools before I knew whats in there  
We come into this life waterlogged and tender  
  
Films and drills and safety illustrations
