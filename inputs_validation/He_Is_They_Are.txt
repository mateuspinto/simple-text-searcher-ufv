He is good  
They are happy  
He is strong  
They are secure  
He is right  
They are unquestioning  
He is wrong  
They are demure  
  
When she left  
He was tortured  
She was gone  
They were confused  
He was forgetful  
They were supportive  
He was funny  
They were amused  
  
He did things that only superman could do  
Things that sis and I could not believe were true  
  
He is older  
They are loving  
He is hardened  
They are grown  
He is needing  
They are giving  
He is glad they are his own
