Cruised into a bar on the shore  
Her picture graced a grime on his door  
She a long lost love at first sight  
Baby mabye youre wrong  
But you know its all right  thats right  
  
Back stage were having the time  
Of our lives until somebody says  
forgive me if i seem out of line  
Then she whipped out a gun  
Tried to blow me away  
  
chorus  
Dude looks like a lady  
Dude looks like a lady  
Dude looks like a lady  
Dude looks like a lady  
  
So never judge a book by its cover  
Or who you gonna love by your lover  
Love put me wise to her love in disguise  
She had the body of a venus  
Lord imagine my surprise  
  
chorus  
  
baby let me follow you down  
Let me take a peak dear  
baby let me follow you down  
Do me do me do me all night  
baby let me follow you down  
Turn the other cheek dear  
baby let me follow you down  
Do me do me do me sue me  
  
What a funky lady  
Oh she like it like it like it like it  
Oh he was a lady  
  
repeat chorus
