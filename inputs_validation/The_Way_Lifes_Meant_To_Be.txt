Well I came a long way to be here today  
And I left you so long on this avenue  
And here I stand in the strangest land  
Not knowing what to say or do  
As I gaze around at these strangers in town  
I guess the only stranger is me  
And I wonder yes I wonder  
Is this the way lifes meant to be  
  
Although its only a day since I was taken away  
And left standing here looking in wonder  
The ground at my feet maybe its just the old street  
But everything that I know lies under  
And when I see what theyve done to this place that  
was home  
Shame is all that I feel  
And I wonder yes I wonder is this  
The way lifes meant to be  
  
Too late too late to cry  
The people say  
Too late for you too late for me  
Youve come so far now you know everything  
My friend  
Just look and see the wonders of our world  
  
As I wander around this wreck of a town  
Where people never speak aloud  
With its ivory towers and its plastic flowers  
I wish I was back in 1981  
Just to see your face instead of this place  
Now I know what you mean to me  
And I wonder yes I wonder is this  
The way lifes meant to be
