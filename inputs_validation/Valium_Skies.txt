Can you keep yourself on for good  
Seems like the whole world is losing  
How do you stop yourself up  
Even if seems like the whole world is crying  
  
Aaaah oooh  
Aaaah oooh  
She got all I need  
The air I breath  
When it comes to my valium skies  
She dont mind if I cry  
  
How do you stop your love from crying  
Even if you knew she was lying  
How do you stop this world from loathing  
Still no knocking with all these cards Im holding  
  
Aaaah oooh  
Aaaah oooh  
She got all I need  
The air I breath  
When it comes to my valium skies  
She dont mind if I cry  
  
She dont mind if I cry  
She dont mind if I cry  
  
Aaaah oooh  
Aaaah oooh  
She got all I need  
The air I breath  
When it comes to my valium skies  
She dont mind if I cry  
  
When it comes to my valium skies  
She dont mind if I cry
