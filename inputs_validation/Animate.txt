Polarize me  
Sensitize me  
Criticize me  
Civilize me  
Compensate me  
Animate me  
Complicate me  
Elevate me  
  
Goddess in my garden  
Sister in my soul  
Angel in my armor  
Actress in my role  
  
Daughter of a demonlover  
Empress of the hidden face  
Priestess of the pagan mother  
Ancient queen of inner space  
  
Spirit in my psyche  
Double in my role  
Alter in my image  
Struggle for control  
  
Mistress of the dark unconscious  
Mermaid of the lunar sea  
Daughter of the great enchantress  
Sister to the boy inside of me  
  
My counterpart  my foolish heart  
A man must learn to rule his tender part  
A warming trend  a gentle friend  
A man must build a fortress to defend  
  
A secret face  a touch of grace  
A man must learn to give a little space  
A peaceful state  a submissive trait  
A man must learn to gently dominate
