I had tinted windows on my first car  
We used to park out by the reservoir  
We had the water radio and the stars  
Never had to worry our friends would come knocking on those  
  
Tinted windows covered in steam  
Floorboard piled up with tshirts and jeans  
You didnt know what you were doing to me  
But I was so gone baby I was so gone for you  
  
Oh it doesnt seem like it could really be  
So long ago when we were seventeen  
So long ago it feels just like a dream when it was you and me and  
  
Tinted windows and sixpack of light  
I know I didnt pop the question right  
But that diamond looked good in the dashboard light  
And you said Yes you know the answer is Yes  
  
Oh it doesnt seem like it could really be  
So long ago when we were seventeen  
So long ago it feels just like a dream when it was you and me and  
Tinted windows  
  
We sold that car back in 97  
Should have got fifteen but we only got eleven  
We grew up and we grew apart  
The years rolled by and now your eyes are  
  
Tinted windows and I wanna believe  
Somewhere inside youre still in love with me  
I keep looking hoping to see it through those  
Tinted windows all those tinted windows  
  
Tinted windows those tinted windows  
Tinted windows  
Tinted windows
