It looked like any other piece of paper  
But I thought there was love between the lines  
But it was  
  
Just another piece of paper  
And it really didnt mean one little thing  
To you from the very start  
Just another piece of paper  
Now I got another piece of paper  
Your lawyer he sent it in the mail today  
It looks like any other piece of paper  
But it says that you have gone away to stay  
And it is  
  
Just another piece of paper  
Blowing in an empty wind  
That slows into my heart  
Just another piece of paper  
Tearing us apart  
And it is
