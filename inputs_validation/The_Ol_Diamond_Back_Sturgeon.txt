The old diamondback sturgeon came swimmin along  
Minding his business one day  
Rooting and sniffing and urging to spawn  
In the mud flats of San Pablo Bay  
  
A scent came around so he followed his snout  
He found what was to his surprise  
A golden morsel a tidbit a tight bunch of grass shrimp  
Was there right before this bucks eyes  
  
He circle round twice and he took a big whiff  
Then sucked up this savory meal  
Then came a jolt and to the diamondbacks surprise  
Through his lips cut the cold barbed steel  
  
In a panic the old diamondback sped to the north  
He sped to the east west and south  
But the harder he swam he still could not break free  
From the tugging that pulled at his mouth  
  
The old diamondback sturgeon came swimmin along  
Minding his business one day
