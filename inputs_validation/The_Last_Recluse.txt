We rode hard  
For the boat as we could  
Tears you said understood understood  
I said alright  
A crowd will be born   
Only bornI  
I want to watch for a sign  
In the night  
I watch a bomb go off in a young girls life  
  
Who were you  
The last recluse  
Who were you  
The last Canada girl  
  
Who were you  
What is it with you  
Who were you  
Who were you  
  
When the wind comes up  
Surfers up  
What a scuzz  
Nothing up with surprise  
Just ride you said  
Ride and shut up  
  
I jump on broadturned around  
To wave goodbye  
You were only on your bike  
Riding with my bike by your side  
  
Who were you  
The black canoe  
Who were you  
The last of the   
Who were you  
You rode a lot   
As far as I know it was you  
  
You broke my heart from the start  
Made me work work so hard  
To where I am  
To where Id let you do it all again  
  
Who were you  
Who were you  
What do I do  
Without you  
  
Who were you  
The last recluse  
Who were you  
The last of the   
  
The last color  
The last Canada girls  
Who were you  
Who were you  
Who were you  
Who were you
