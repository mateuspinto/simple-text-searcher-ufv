Standing in a forest gazing at the sun  
Looking at the trees but theres not even one  
See a rippling stream that smiles and then goes by  
Run to feel its comfort but the waters dry  
  
I see her face and run to take her hand  
Why shes never there I just dont understand  
The trumpets sound my whole world crumbles down  
  
Visions of angels all around  
Dance in the sky  
Leaving me here  
Forever goodbye  
  
As the leaves will crumble so will fall my love  
For the fragile beauty of our lives must fade  
Though I once remember echoes of my youth  
Now I sense no past no love that ends in love  
  
Take this dream the stars have filled with light  
As the blossom glides like snowflakes from the trees  
In vengeance to a god noone can reach  
  
Visions of angels all around  
Dance in the sky  
Leaving me here  
Forever goodbye  
  
Ice is moving and the worlds begun to freeze  
See the sunlight stopped and deadned by the breeze  
Minds are empty bodies more insensitive  
Some believe that when they die they really live  
  
I believe there never is an end  
God gave up the world its people long ago  
Why shes never there I still dont understand  
  
Visions of angels all around  
Dance in the sky  
Leaving me here  
Forever goodbye
