Strangulation mutilation cancer of the brain  
Limb dissection amputation from a mind deranged  
  
Asphyxiation suffocation gasping for air  
Explain to me the feeling after sitting in the chair  
  
Ripping apart  
Severing flesh  
Gouging eyes  
Tearing limb from limb  
  
Experimentation slow infection internal decay  
Execution need transfusion body rots away  
  
Sliced incision zero vision loss of vital signs  
Skin contortion bone erosion your life becomes your fine  
  
Ripping apart  
Severing flesh  
Gouging eyes  
Tearing limb from limb

Necrophobic cant control the paranoia  
Scared to die
