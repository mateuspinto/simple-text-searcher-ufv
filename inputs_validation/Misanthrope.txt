From above and around  
observations are collected  
Knowledge is taken in by curious life forms  
That may bring hope from beyond  
Beneath the giver of life our sun  
An examination of another kind is done  
  
A view from those who stood high  
And breathing the sky  
An opinion from below and from above  
  
Some were decided some were not  
A few looked away but none forgot  
  
Misanthrope  
Hater of all mankind  
There is some hope  
For those who own their mind  
They came they saw and acknowledged  
Some good some bad  
Opinion Dangerous  
  
Stay where you are dont get consumed  
By what they created from sheer neglect  
In denial of years and years of  
shattered souls  
That were lost to the power of  
Fragile frightful minds  
  
A view from those who stood high  
And breathing the sky  
An opinion from below and from above  
  
Some were decided some were not  
A few looked away but none forgot  
  
Misanthrope  
Hater of all mankind  
There is some hope  
For those who own their mind  
They came they saw and acknowledged  
Some good some bad  
Opinion Dangerous
