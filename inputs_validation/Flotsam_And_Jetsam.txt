Doing nothing stuck in the mud  
Just pumping the blood  
The water levels getting low  
Something ugly is going to show  
  
If I could only touch you  
I guess youd be alarmed  
If only I could touch you  
I dont mean you no harm  
  
If only I could touch you  
like the wind can touch the sail  
If only I could touch you darling  
now that words have failed  
Oh Flotsam still afloat  
Oh Jetsam thrown out of the boat  
  
Oh love my love  
nothing here is what it seems  
  
We both know it  
Christ you show it  
Oh oh my love
