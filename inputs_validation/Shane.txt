Theyll shine a light in your eyes  
Theyll set you up with their lies sweet lies  
Shane if you leave me theyll hurt you believe me  
And something inside you will die  
  
I know the reason you bleed  
I understand what you need and you need me  
Babe I can help you think of nights that I held you  
And only I can make you sleep  
  
Shane Shane no one will hide you  
Like the one that cries your name  
Shane nobody wants you  
Like the one that haunts your dreams  
  
I know the voices you hear  
I know the secrets you fear  
Dreams that will wake you faces that shake you  
Remember that Ive always been near  
  
Forget the love that I gave you  
Forget the child that I saved  
Only I know your heartbeat only I know your backstreets  
And only I can take you away
