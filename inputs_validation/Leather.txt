Look Im standing naked before you  
Dont you want more than my sex  
I can scream as loud as your last one  
But I cant claim innocence  
  
Oh God could it be the weather  
Oh God why am I here  
If love isnt forever  
And its not the weather  
Hand me my leather  
  
I could just pretend that you love me  
The night would lose all sense of fear  
But why do I need you to love me  
When you cant hold what I hold dear  
  
Oh God could it be the weather  
Oh God why am I here  
If love isnt forever  
And its not the weather  
Hand me my leather  
  
I almost ran over an angel  
He had a nice big fat cigar  
In a sense he said youre alone here  
So if you jump you best jump far  
  
Oh God could it be the weather  
Oh God why am I here  
If love isnt forever  
And its not the weather  
Oh God could it be the weather  
Oh God its all very clear  
If love isnt forever  
And its not the weather  
Hand me my leather
