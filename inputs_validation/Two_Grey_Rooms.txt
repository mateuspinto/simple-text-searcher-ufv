Tomorrow is Sunday  
Now theres only one day left to go  
Till you walk by  
Below my window  
The weekends drive me mad  
Holidays are oh too sad  
Cause you dont go  
Below my window  
  
No one knows Im here  
One day I just disappeared  
And I took these two grey rooms up here  
With a view  
When you walk by  
Below my window  
  
You look so youthful  
Time has been untruthful  
Heaven knows I loved you  
30 years ago  
Hot days your shirts undone  
Rainy days you run  
Oh and then you fade so fast  
Below my window  
  
No one knows Im here  
One day I just disappeared  
And I took these two grey rooms up here  
With a view  
Only when you walk by  
Below my window  
When you walk by  
  
Below my window  
Below my window  
Hey hey  
Below my window  
Below my window  
Below my window
