Standing around  
Hoping everything works out  
Cause I want them all to work out  
You were always so in love with the truth  
Why did you change  
Why did you land  
  
Chorus  
Look at the photograph  
Nothing is real  
Spend another lonely life  
With nothing to feel  
  
Was it something  
In the stories everyone told you  
You neednt heed them  
Maybe you should read them  
Go back to where you came from  
Why did you land  
You couldnt have stayed in flight forever  
  
Chorus  
  
Why did you land  
Why did you land  
Why did you land  
Why did you land  
Why did you land
