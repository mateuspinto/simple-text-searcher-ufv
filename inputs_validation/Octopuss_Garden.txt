Id like to be under the sea  
In an octopuss garden in the shade  
Hed let us in knows where weve been  
In his octopuss garden in the shade  
  
Id ask my friends to come and see  
An octopuss garden with me  
  
Id like to be under the sea  
In an octopuss garden in the shade  
  
We would be warm below the storm  
In our little hideaway beneath the waves  
Restin our head on the sea bed  
In an octopuss garden near a cave  
  
We would sing and dance around  
Because we know we cant be found  
  
Id like to be under the sea  
In an octopuss garden in the shade  
  
We would shout and swim about  
The coral that lies beneath the waves  
Lies beneath the ocean waves  
Oh what joy for every girl and boy  
Knowing were happy and were safe  
Happy and were safe  
  
We would be so happy you and me  
No one there to tell us what to do  
  
Id like to be under the sea  
In an octopuss garden with you  
In an octopuss garden with you  
In an octopuss garden with you
