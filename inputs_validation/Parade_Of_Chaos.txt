We march like fools in the parade of chaos  
We march like fools in the parade of chaos  
Led by our enemies  
While we sing there praises  
Led by our enemies  
While we kiss their hands  
The morning rained fire  
Let heavens retire  
Over the eyes of the blind  
And the voices of spoiled children  
True leaders are gone  
We turned our backs to many times  
And bit the hand of the provider  
Chaos kills us  
Chaos
