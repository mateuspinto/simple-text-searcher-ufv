Oh why in this world must we work life like a deal sometimes I feel  
Its all make believe  
Put glory in your heart and never say die  
forget your troubles go where hearts are Happy hi  
so Happy hi yeah  
  
And why in this world is life like a train never stopping at stations  
If I could freeze time under the starry sky never questioning why  
And what in this world is achieving perfection  
We may not get there but boy do we care  
Dont be scared  
  
Put glory in your heart and never say die  
forget your troubles go where hearts are Happy hi  
so Happy hi yeah  
  
Put glory in your heart and never say die  
forget your troubles go where hearts are Happy hi  
so Happy hi yeah  
  
Put glory in your heart and never say die  
forget your troubles go where hearts are Happy hi  
so Happy hi yeah
