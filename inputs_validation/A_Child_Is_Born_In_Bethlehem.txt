A Child is born in Bethlehem  
In Bethlehem  
And gladness fills Jerusalem  
Allelujah allelujah  
  
A lowly manger shelters Him  
This Holy Boy  
Gods angels sing above with joy  
Allelujah allelujah  
  
We now give thanks eternally  
Eternaly  
To God the Holy Trinity  
Allelujah allelujah  
  
The work which His goodness began  
The arm of His strength will complete  
His promise is Yea and Amen  
And never was forfeited yet  
  
Things future nor things that are now  
Not all things below or above  
Can make Him His purpose forego  
Or sever my soul from His love  
  
My name from the palms of His hands  
Eternity will not erase  
Imprest on His heart it remains  
In marks of indelible grace  
  
Yes I to the end shall endure  
As sure as the earnest is givn  
More happy but not more secure  
When all earthly ties have been rivn
