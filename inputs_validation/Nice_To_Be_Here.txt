Nice to be here hope you agree  
Lying in the sun  
Lovely weather must climb a tree  
The show has just begun  
  
All the leaves start swaying  
To the breeze thats playing  
On a thousand violins  
And the bees are humming  
To a frog sat strumming  
On a guitar with only one string  
  
I can see them they cant see me  
I feel out of sight  
I can see them they cant see me  
Much to my delight  
  
And it seems worth noting  
Water rats were boating  
As a lark began to sing  
The sounds kept coming  
With Jack Rabbit loudly drumming  
On the side of a biscuit tin  
  
I can see them they cant see me  
I feel out of sight  
I can see them they cant see me  
Much to my delight  
  
Silver minnows were devising  
Water ballet so surprising  
A mouse played a daffodil  
A mole came up blinking  
Underneath an owl whos thinking  
How he came to be sat on a hill  
  
I can see them they cant see me  
I feel out of sight  
I can see them they cant see me  
Much to my delight  
  
I know you wont believe me  
But Im certain that I did see  
A mouse playing daffodil  
All the band was really jumping  
With Jack Rabbit in there thumping  
I found that I couldnt sit still  
I just had to make it with them  
Cause they played my kind of rhythm  
And the bees hummed in harmony  
And the owl played his oboe  
Then the frogs guitar solo  
It was all just too much for me  
  
I know you wont believe me  
But Im certain that I did see  
A mouse playing daffodil  
All the band was really jumping  
With Jack Rabbit in there thumping  
I found that I couldnt sit still
