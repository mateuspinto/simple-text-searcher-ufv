I was on a sleeper train  
Bound for anywhere  
And I was gazin out the window  
In a long stare  
Watchin the sage brush go by  
And a pink and yellow sky  
Thinkin bout your eyes  
Feelin good to be alive  
I was dreamin of you  
Feelin lucky  
I was dreamin of you  
Feelin lucky  
And I was watchin the towns drift into view  
Listenin to my thoughts of you  
And the rhythm of the wheels  
And the shadows on the hills  
Leavin one more life behind  
Never knowin what Id find  
Such a distant great expanse  
And the dustdevils they dance  
And I was dreamin of you  
Feelin lucky  
I was dreamin of you  
Feelin lucky  
Abandon everything that went before  
Ahead now lies another open door  
Abandon everything that went before  
I was on a sleeper train  
Bound for anywhere  
And I was gazin out the window  
In a long stare  
Watchin the sage brush go by  
And a pink and yellow sky  
Thinkin bout your eyes  
Feelin good to be alive  
I was dreamin of you  
Feelin lucky  
I was dreamin of you  
Feelin lucky  
I was dreamin of you  
Feelin lucky  
I was dreamin of you  
Feelin lucky  
The train kept rollin
