I can see all the footsteps left behind every second I gave  
Every song was a snapshot of my life I needed something to say  
  
It started out in the last slow motion scene watching everyone change  
Made a map of the one way road from here I had no reason to stay  
  
I am awake and alive there is something calling me  
More than a moment in time its a dream Im following on my own  
On my own On my own  
More than a moment in time its a life of leaving home  
  
Think of me when the stars come out tonight take a look at the sky  
I never said I could burn out that bright but I needed to try  
  
I am awake and alive there is something calling me  
More than a moment in time its a dream Im following on my own  
On my own On my own  
More than a moment in time its a life of leaving home  
  
The day that I found my voice I knew that I had no choice  
The only way that Id ever learn to love is if i found it on my own  
On my own  
  
I am awake and alive there is something calling me  
More than a moment in time its a dream Im following on my own  
On my own On my own  
On my own on my own On my own on my own  
More than a moment in time its a life of leaving home
