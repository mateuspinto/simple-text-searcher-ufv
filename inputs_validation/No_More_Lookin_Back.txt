My friend called just the other day  
Packed it up he wont be back this way  
  
Its not your heart but the spirit they break  
Theres only so much a small town boy can take  
  
See the eyes of the countless masses  
Drinking life from the empty glasses  
  
Chorus  
No more victims  
No more lies  
Ne sheer heart attacks  
No more empty promises  
No more lookin back  
  
I came here loaded searching for the dream  
But nothing is ever easy as it seems  
  
I thought I got closer to it every day  
But every day it just got so far away  
  
See all the faces paled  
Shot to hell when the system failed  
  
Chorus  
  
I thought I could take all the shit in grind  
And stand much more pain  
But see all those dead end wishes  
Eats away at the brain  
  
Solo chorus
