Dont fly away come along quick  
South where the breezes blow  
Leave this storm land  
Come away to a warm land  
  
Pack up fly away learn an old trick  
All of the wise guys know  
Headin to the south you cant miss it  
Let me be explicit  
  
When you see blue skies and fields of white  
And the sun is shinin bright  
Yes sir Thats the good old sunny south  
When you hear that same old robin sing  
That you heard up north in spring  
Yes sir Thats the good old sunny south  
  
Where your heart wants to play  
And your feet want to dance  
Where the close of each day  
Brings a night of romance  
Where you meet those gals that sweetly drawl  
Mighty glad to meet you all  
Yes sir Thats the good old sunny south  
  
musical interlude punctuated by Babys Yes sir  
  
Where you meet those gals that sweetly drawl  
Mighty glad to meet you all  
Yes sir Thats the good old sunny south
