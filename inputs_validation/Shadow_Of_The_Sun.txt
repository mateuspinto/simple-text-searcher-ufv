Across the concrete sky come walk with me  
Something we need to know  
Something we need to see  
Is it love yes its love  
Only love that is growing inside me  
If its love yes its love  
Only love is the pillar of plenty  
  
You you make me feel this is all I need  
And its all so real  
You help me understand where I want to be  
When I touch your hand  
  
I can see to the shadow of the sun  
We can be in the shadow of the sun  
  
Untie the sails the shore will melt away  
Without a trace I hear the raven say  
When its love this is love when its love  
That we must know we must enter  
This is love this is love only love  
When the dove is descended  
  
You are the winding stream going to somewhere  
That we ve never seen  
You are the dare to dream and the silent scream  
And the final prayer  
  
I can see to the shadow of the sun  
We can be in the shadow of the sun  
Reach out for the shadow of the sun  
Cry out for the shadow of the sun  
You are the colors of the wind  
Singing hopes eternal spring  
In a symphony for every lonely year  
You are the keeper of the key  
And the one that longs to be  
The light for each and every frozen tear
