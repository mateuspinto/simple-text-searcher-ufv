Theres no need to find a reason for your dreams  
for there is always more to dreaming than there seems to be  
And Ill be thankful if through out my life you dream of me  
Its all that I could ask for while I live  
A dream is such a lovely gift to give  
Ah da da  
  
Your fragile beauty caught me in its web  
And I am held by every silver strand of love you spin  
Here in a swirl of sleeping circles all my dreams begin  
Dreams that somehow always end with you  
Youre the one that makes my dreams come true  
  
Sleep is lovely when you sleep next to me  
And while youre dreaming let your thoughts all run free  
  
But if I could understand what makes you free  
then I would capture you and hold you for eternity  
But Im afraid that would destroy the love you feel for me  
And loving you is how it has to be  
Reasons dont mean anything to me  
Loving you is how it has to be  
Reasons dont mean anything to me
