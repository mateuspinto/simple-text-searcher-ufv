As I look into my life  
Searching for that paradise  
  
Oh Lord will you help me find me  
Take this crazy ghetto past of mine  
And put it all behind me  
Look down on the ghetto man  
And change his mission  
And put it in the hearts  
Of many to stop confusion  
  
Chorus  
My sistas brothas  
Lets put these hands together  
We need to stop chokin on the truth  
And start smokin on a plan man  
Love and respect that woman  
And bring her happiness  
Im talkin to the ghetto  
For each other we should help  
While our babies are dying in the street  
Weve got to be saying to ourselves
