Now the reason were here  
As man and woman  
Is to love each other  
Take care of each other  
When love walks in the room  
Everybody stand up  
Oh its good good good  
Like Brigitte Bardot  
  
Now look at the people  
In the streets in the bars  
We are all of us in the gutter  
But some of us are looking at the stars  
Look round the room  
Life is unkind  
We fall but we keep gettin up  
Over and over and over and over and over and over  
  
Me and you every night every day  
Well be together always this way  
Your eyes are blue like the heavens above  
Talk to me darlin with a message of love  
  
Now the reason were here  
Every man every woman  
Is to help each other  
Stand by each other  
When love walks in the room  
Everybody stand up  
Oh its good good good  
Say i love you i love you i love you i love you i love you i love you  
  
Talk to me darlin
