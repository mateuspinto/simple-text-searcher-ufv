George I  
I took the throne of England  
Just cause I was protestant  
A German prince whose English stank  
King George number one  
  
George II  
I like to argue now thats clear  
Especially with my father here  
And when he died of diarrhoea  
I fought with my son  
  
George III  
I broke records with my sixty year reign  
  
George VI  
And I broke the scales with my giant frame  
  
all  
Born to rule over you  
King George four three one and two  
You had to do what we told you to  
Just because our blood was blue  
  
George I  
I was a hunk girls adored me  
Ladies all swooned before me  
They would do anything for me  
Or Id have their husbands killed  
  
George II  
Had a war with Prince Charles Bonnie  
  
George III  
Everyone said that I was fffunny  
  
George IV  
I spent everyones money  
  
All  
Our subjects were not thrilled  
  
George I  
I was the sad one  
  
George II  
I was the bad one  
  
George III  
I was the mad one  
  
George IV  
and I was the fat one  
  
All  
We were born to rule over you  
Georges one three four and two  
Englands kings though we were German too  
Him then him then me then you  
  
We were bornBorn to rule over youborn 2 rule  
  
George I  
Gorged on fruit then I died on the loo  
  
ALL  
People hated us and we hated them too  
Born to rule over you  
  
Born to rule over you  
  
George III  
Me I was as batty as a bonkers kangaroo  
  
George IV  
Me I would have been more at home in a zoo  
And now now our song is through  
  
Yeah  
  
Georges  
  
George III
