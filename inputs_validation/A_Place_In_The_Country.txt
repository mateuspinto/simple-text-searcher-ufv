For thirty some odd years he faced a grinder in the city  
Hustlin day in day out just tryin to survive  
He bought his wife the finer thingsand sent his kids to collage  
That always took what little bit he tried to put aside  
  
But through it all he had one thing that seemed to keep him going  
A dream that someday he could leave this city life behind  
I watched his hair turn thin and gray but his dream never faded  
He told me all about it at least a thousand times  
  
Chorus  
He always wanted a place out in the country  
Where the birds sing in the morningand the grass is emerald green  
A place where he could feel the mornin sunshine  
And sit out in the evenin where the air is fresh and clean  
  
It took lots of overtime to keep his wife up with the jonses  
And more to get his son out of his runins with the law  
The more it took the more he gave never once complaining  
I dont know how he ever stood the pressure of it all  
  
I never thought hed make it but he finally left the city  
And now hes got that special little place to call his own  
Today I took a ride out in the country just to see him  
It wasnt hard to find because his name was on the stone
