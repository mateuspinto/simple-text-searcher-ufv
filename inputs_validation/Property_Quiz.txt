Little seas can be big seas  
To the wrong or long of sights  
But the Mediterranean  
Looks like aspirin tonight  
  
The Doctor told me the chemist  
He had nothing for my plights  
But the Mediterranean  
Looks like aspirin tonight  
  
This ocean puts in motion  
All our wildest Crusoe thoughts  
Turns brain to Kontiki  
When its always been left in port  
  
Id rather be cemented  
In deep blue building site  
Cause drugs can get you higher  
But my chosen drug tonight  
Is the reliable Mediterranean  
Is the reliable Mediterranean  
Is my chosen my chosen drug tonight  
  
Little voyage can be big voyage  
If you sail in the middle of night  
But the Mediterranean  
Needs the compass tonight  
  
It gives cheap thrills to the seagulls  
Life to lifes little kites  
But the Mediterranean  
Is my aspirin tonight  
  
This ocean puts in motion  
All our wildest Crusoe thoughts  
Turns brain to Kontiki  
When its always been left in port  
  
Id rather be cemented  
In deep blue building site  
Cause drugs can get you higher  
But my chosen drug tonight  
Is the reliable Mediterranean  
Is the reliable Mediterranean  
Is my chosen my chosen drug tonight  
  
Id rather be cemented  
In deep blue building site  
Cause drugs can get you higher  
But my chosen drug tonight  
Is the reliable Mediterranean  
Is the reliable Mediterranean  
Is my chosen my chosen drug tonight
