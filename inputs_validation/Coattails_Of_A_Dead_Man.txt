He wasnt lookin for fanfare or fame  
But it all came around just the same  
He then met a girl with desire in her eye  
He gave her love she took his name  
  
The times they were good the times they were bad  
Most times it was just in between  
The hard pill he swallowed was the times that they had  
She put on display for all to be seen  
  
Some find their solace in work or the lord  
She was quite content in her dream  
When his eyes they burned from the bright lime light  
He found comfort in the bottle of Ol Jimmy Beam  
  
One day from the depths of his deep darkened hole  
He reached out for something to feel  
She offered back nothin but lack of respect  
So he left himself out with two barrels of steel  
  
She cried in the day she cried in the night  
She cried loudest when someone was near  
Whether crying for him or she cried for herself  
The bigger the camera the bigger the tear  
  
Most folks agree that she was living a hell  
And publicly she showed her pain  
And never once was there a thought for herself  
And the evergrowing slices of fortune and fame  
  
Now on the coattails of a dead man shell ride  
On the coattails of a dead man shell ride  
On the coattails of a dead man shell ride shell ride  
On the coattails of a dead man shell ride shell ride high
