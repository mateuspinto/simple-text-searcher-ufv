No more trouble  
In this town  
Silent night for a change  
  
Brand new year  
Coming up ahead  
You know its been so long  
Since I rang one in  
  
I close my eyes  
Think about the path I took  
Just when I think these times  
Have gotten the best of me  
  
I can see my mother in the kitchen  
My father on the floor  
Watching television  
Its a wonderful life  
  
Cinnamon candles burning  
Snowball fights outside  
Smile below each nose and above each chin  
  
Stomp my boots before I go back in  
  
I wasted my wishes  
On Saturday nights  
Boy what I would give  
For just one more  
  
I soften my heart  
  
Shocked the world  
Do you hear my voice  
Do you know my name  
Light my way  
Lift my head  
Light my way I can see my mother in the kitchen  
  
My father on the floor  
Watching television  
Its a wonderful life  
  
Cinnamon candles burning  
Snowball fights outside  
Smile below each nose and above each chin  
  
Family all together  
Presents piled high  
Frost on all the windows  
What a wonderful night  
  
Cinnamon candles burning  
Snowball fights outside  
Smile below each nose and above each chin  
  
So happy they found me  
Love was all around me  
Stomp my boots before I go back in
