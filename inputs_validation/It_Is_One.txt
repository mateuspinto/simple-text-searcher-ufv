They shot a man into the sky  
The moon and stars became his bed  
He saw the sun rise seven times  
And when he came back down he said  
  
It is one it is one  
One world spinning round the sun  
Wherever it is you call home  
Whatever country you come from  
It is one it is one it is one it is one  
  
They shot a man if Africa  
At a time of rivalry and war  
He had some dreams of a good life  
But dreams arent what they killed him for  
  
Now people stand themselves next to the righteous  
And they believe the things they say are true  
They speak in terms of what divides us  
To justify the violence they do  
  
But it is one it is one  
One world spinning round the sun  
Wherever it is you call home  
Whatever country you come from  
It is one it is one it is one it is one  
One the deep blue ocean  
One the endless sky  
One the purple mountains  
One you and I  
  
Its not a world of our own choosing  
We dont decide where we are born  
This life is a battleground between right and wrong  
One way or other we are torn  
  
And people stand themselves next to the righteous  
And they believe the things they say are true  
And speak in terms of what divides us  
To justify the violence they do  
  
But it is one it is one  
One world spinning round the sun  
Wherever it is you call home  
Whatever country you come from  
It is one it is one it is one it is one  
It is one it is one it is one it is one  
One the deep blue ocean  
One the endless sky  
One the purple mountains  
One you and I
