Next we have the dearheartsandgentlepeoples school of songwriting in
which the singer tells you that no matter how much sin and vice and crime go
on where he comes from its still the be  
Ace in the world because its home you know sort of gets you this example
is called my home town  
I really have a yen  
To go back once again  
Back to the place where no one wears a frown  
To see once more those superspecial just plain folks  
In my home town  
No fellow could ignore  
The little girl next door  
She sure looked sweet in her first evening gown  
Now theres a charge for what she used to give for free  
In my home town  
I remember dan the druggist on the corner e  
Was never mean or ornery  
He was swell  
He killed his motherinlaw and ground her up real well  
And sprinkled just a bit  
Over each banana split  
The guy that taught us math  
Who never took a bath  
Acquired a certain measure of renown  
And after school he sold the most amazing pictures  
In my home town  
That fellow was no fool  
Who taught our Sunday school  
And neither was our kindly parson brown  
Were recording tonight so I have to leave this line out  
In my home town  
I remember sam he was the village idiot  
And though it seems a pity it  
Was so  
He loved to burn down houses just to watch the glow  
And nothing could be done  
Because he was the mayors son  
The guy that took a knife  
And monogrammed his wife  
Then dropped her in the pond and watched her drown  
Oh yes indeed the people there are just plain folks  
In my home town
