You walk in half past nine  
Lookin like a queen  
Serving me with papers  
Calling me obscene  
Woman Ive tried so hard  
Just to do my best  
Theyre gonna put me in the poor house  
And youll take all the rest  
  
Up all day down all night  
Working on the job  
Everything I do is wrong  
I always end up   
Woman I try so hard  
Done all I can do  
Theyre gonna put me in the poor house  
Keep all the best for you  
  
Ooh in the poor house  
Ooh in the poor house  
  
If a drove a pulpwood truck  
Would you love me more  
Will you bring me diamonds  
And hang around my door  
Woman Ive done my best  
Theyre aint much left for me  
Theyre gonna put me in the poor house  
And throw away the key in the poor house  
  
Ooh in the poor house  
  
You walked in half past nine  
Lookin like a queen  
Serving me with papers  
Calling me obscene  
Woman Ive tried so hard  
Just to do my best  
Theyre gonna put me in the poor house  
And youll take all the rest  
  
In the poor house  
Ooh in the poor house  
In the poor house  
Ooh in the poor house
