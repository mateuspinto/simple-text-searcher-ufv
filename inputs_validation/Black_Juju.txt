Body  
Body  
  
Touched by the toil and plunged into his arm  
Cursed through the night through eyes of alarm  
A melody black flowed out of my breath  
Searching for death but bodies need rest  
  
Body  
  
Under the soil now waiting for worms  
All that I feared is all that Ive learned  
All that I know is all that I think  
Dead feelings are cool down lower I sink ahhah  
  
Bodies need rest  
We all need our rest  
Sleep an easy sleep  
Rest  
Rest  
Bodies need their rest  
We all need our rest  
Sleep an easy sleep  
Rest  
Rest  
Rest  
Rest  
But come back in the morning  
  
Come back hard  
  
Wake up  
Wake up  
Wake up  
Wake up  
  
Bodies  
Clutching and biting my soul has caught on fire  
My evil is now and Im caught up in desire  
Everything Im living for is all that I am  
Liking it and loving it thats all in the plan
