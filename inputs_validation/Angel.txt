Spend all your time  
Waiting for that  
Second chance  
For a break that  
Would make it okay  
Theres always one reason  
To feel not good enough  
And its hard at  
The end of the day  
I need some distraction  
Oh beautiful release  
Memory seeps  
From my veins  
Let me be empty  
And weightless and maybe  
Ill find some peace tonight  
In the arms of an angel  
Fly away from here  
From this dark  
Cold hotel room  
And the endlessness  
That you fear  
You are pulled  
From the wreckage  
Of your silent reverie  
Youre in the  
Arms of the angel  
May you find  
Some comfort there  
  
So tired of the straight line  
And everywhere you turn  
Theres vultures and  
  
Thieves at your back  
And the storm  
Keeps on twisting  
You keep on  
Building the lie  
That you make up  
For all that you lack  
It dont make no difference  
Escaping one last time  
Its easier to  
Believe in this  
Sweet madness oh  
This glorious sadness  
That brings me  
To my knees  
  
In the arms of an angel  
Fly away from here  
From this dark  
Cold hotel room  
And the endlessness  
That you fear  
You are pulled  
From the wreckage  
Of your silent reverie  
Youre in the  
Arms of the angel  
May you find  
Some comfort there  
Youre in the  
Arms of the angel  
May you find  
Some comfort here
