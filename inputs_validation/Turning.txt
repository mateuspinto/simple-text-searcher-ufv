The women of Paris mourn their lost loved ones  
  
Women  
Did you see them  
Going off to fight  
Children of the barricade  
Who didnt last the night  
Did you see them  
Lying where they died  
Someone used to cradle them  
And kiss them when they cried  
Did you see them  
Lying side by side  
  
Who will wake them  
No one ever will  
No one ever told them  
That a summer day can kill  
They were schoolboys  
Never held a gun  
Fighting for a new world  
That would rise up like the sun  
Wheres that new world  
Now the fightings done  
  
Nothing changes nothing ever will  
Every year another brat another mouth to fill  
Same old story whats the use of tears  
Whats the use of praying if theres nobody who hears  
Turning turning turning turning turning  
Through the years  
  
Turning turning turning through the years  
Minutes into hours and the hours into years  
Nothing changes nothing ever can  
Round and round the roundabout and back where you began  
Round and round and back where you began
