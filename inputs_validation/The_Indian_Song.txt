And I was lost for words  
In your arms  
Attempting to make sense of  
My aching heart  
If I could just be everything  
And everyone to you  
This life is just too short  
To divide into  
Divide into divide into two  
  
Yeah theres not enough  
Time for all of that I want to show you  
Not enough time  
For every kiss and every touch  
And all the nights  
I want to be inside of you  
  
Drift away  
To make time stop  
For the two of us  
Im gonna make time stop  
Make time stop stop stop  
  
Better listen to  
The sighs of love  
In our fight against  
The end of time  
We were making love  
We are immortal  
We are the last two left  
Yeah the last two left  
Yeah the last two left  
Yeah the last two left  
Were the last two lefton earth
