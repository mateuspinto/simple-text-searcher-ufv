One way in and one way out  
You dont know what its all about  
You look to the left  
You look to the right  
The brightest day and the darkest night  
  
Chorus  
And if you see me stealin away  
You better believe that Id much rather stay  
Daughter of the night  
Everything right  
Is getting to you baby  
Sister of the sun  
Born on the run  
  
Just let me move you baby  
On the road well I been told  
The people need a highway code  
The harder the chase  
The sweeter the catch  
I aint the driver but you met your match  
  
Chorus  
  
You can win and you can lose  
Listen mama you got to choose  
You can give up tryin  
Or break down cryin  
Or keep on goin  
Change your mind  
  
Chorus
