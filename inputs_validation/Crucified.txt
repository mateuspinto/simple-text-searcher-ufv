Chain him jail him judge and crucify find him bind him nail him crucify  
Raised boy the virgin is pure and good father to the race  
Sinful in sodom with cold blind luster praying to the golden calf  
Walking the land with twelve good men that follow talking the hand of one
whose blind  
Curing the lame causing mutes to speak miracles prevail to the open mind  
Chain him jail him judge and crucify find him bind him nail him crucify  
Saved for forty days and nights he roamed the desert sand  
No food to nourish only faith temptations close at hand  
Evil abounds in every footstep that he takes in the sand he must stay true  
All this in vain because hell die for sure saving the frame of all thats
good  
Forgive them father for they know not what they do
