Yes Lisa  
  
Is the water warm enough  
  
Yes Lisa  
  
Shall we begin  
Yes Lisa  
  
Ow  
  
Where is my love life  
Where can it be  
There must be something wrong with the machinery  
  
Where is my love life  
Tell me where has it gone  
Somebody please please tell me what the hell is wrong  
  
Till I find the righteous one  
Computer blue  
Till I find the righteous one  
Computer blue  
  
Oh  
Yeah  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
