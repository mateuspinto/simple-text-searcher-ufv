Charva I loved you  
I loved you through and through  
I loved you since in grammar school  
When we were sniffing glue  
I loved you purty baby doll  
And I dont know what in the world  
To do about it  
Boppabahboppachoowah  
Charva my darling  
The only love I had  
I hope you will forgive me dear  
For punching out your dad  
I loved you I loved you  
And I dont know what in the world  
Im gonna do about it  
Ooohhohoooh  
Lahmbuhbuhmbuhm  
I remember remember the junior prom  
And I remember the time I broke your fathers arm  
And I remember remember all the love we shared  
Every place and everywhere  
Oh charva charva  
I love you more and more  
I swear it aint because your father owns a liquor store  
Charva my baby  
I love you and I dont know what to do about it  
Ohoh charva  
Ooooohh  
Ohoh charva

Come back my little darling charva  
I love you so much honey  
Come back to me charva  
Please charva please come back to me  
I miss you so much
