Black candles slowly burning white fangs and flashing eyes  
Hells wind and incantations summon living fire  
Darkest forces and your demons black order black king  
The cult that serves the living accept this offering  
  
Black candles slowly burning white fangs and flashing eyes  
Hells wind and incantations summon living fire  
As the seven steps await hear the great bell toll  
With a dead mans bones conjure the enemy of the soul  
  
From the misery and sadness of the molten seas of hell  
Mystic love and mystic symbols in evil dreams there dwell  
Darkest forces and your demons black order black king  
The cult that serves the living accept this offering  
  
A deadly drink a meal of hearts now sacrifice and die  
In darkness and destruction behold the evil eye  
And the Demons whip  
  
Armies of the gods of hell ride across the astral plane  
Bearing curses of destruction sworn beyond the grave  
Children of the darkness all born but to deceive  
By the ancient code of evil grant not one reprieve  
  
In the place where evil dwells death can live when all life dies  
Wage eternal war on heaven immortal hate below the sky  
Your scripture and your sermons are leaves born on the wind  
To heal the unrepentant one needs a greater sin  
  
Night winds oblivion see my dark desire  
Come forth appear he is living fire  
Feel the Demons whip  
  
Armies of the gods of hell ride across the astral plane  
Bearing curses of destruction sworn beyond the grave  
Children of the darkness all born but to deceive  
By the ancient code of evil grant not one reprieve  
  
In the place where evil dwells death can live when all life dies  
Wage eternal war on heaven immortal hate below the sky  
Your scripture and your sermons are leaves borne on the wind  
To heal the unrepentant one needs a greater sin  
Feel the Demons whip
