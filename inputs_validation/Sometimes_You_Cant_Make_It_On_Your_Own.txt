Tough you think youve got the stuff  
Youre telling me and anyone  
Youre hard enough  
  
You dont have to put up a fight  
You dont have to always be right  
Let me take some of the punches  
For you tonight  
  
Listen to me now  
I need to let you know  
You dont have to go it alone  
  
And its you when I look in the mirror  
And its you when I dont pick up the phone  
Sometimes you cant make it on your own  
  
We fight all the time  
You and I thats alright  
Were the same soul  
I dont need I dont need to hear you say  
That if we werent so alike  
Youd like me a whole lot more  
  
Listen to me now  
I need to let you know  
You dont have to go it alone  
  
And its you when I look in the mirror  
And its you when I dont pick up the phone  
Sometimes you cant make it on your own  
  
I know that we dont talk  
Im sick of it all  
Can you hear me when I  
Sing youre the reason I sing  
Youre the reason why the opera is in me  
  
Where are we now  
Ive got to let you know  
A house still doesnt make a home  
Dont leave me here alone  
  
And its you when I look in the mirror  
And its you that makes it hard to let go  
Sometimes you cant make it on your own  
Sometimes you cant make it  
The best you can do is to fake it  
Sometimes you cant make it on your own
