Now he was blond and she was dark  
They called him thunder cause he had the spark  
The dream he dreamed was straight and pure  
But the confusion of life was gonna get him for sure  
  
Look away look away  
  
They shared their clothes and their cowboy boots  
Left them all over the floor while they dyed their roots  
They live the dream and they went nonstop  
They did ok til the band broke up  
  
Look away look away look away look away  
  
Unfortunately the needle broke  
Their rock and roll love like a bicycle spoke  
I found her in a back street with her looks half gone  
She was selling something that I was on  
  
Look away look away  
  
Now thunder and me did not part friends  
What we did once I wouldnt do again  
So he stayed with the pure dream and followed the moon  
til the drugs in his body made his mind a cartoon  
  
Look away look away  
  
So a few years later thunder died broke  
Sable had a baby back at her folks  
Me I went straight and serious too  
There wasnt much else that I could do  
  
Look away look away  
  
So now that Im straight Im settled too  
I eat and I sleep and I work like you  
I got lots of feelings but I hold them down  
Thats a way I cope with this shitty town  
  
Look away look away  
Look away look away
