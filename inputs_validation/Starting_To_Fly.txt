I know the answers from the words of  
The prophet  
Ive seen the light through the fingers  
Made of magic  
  
Ive seen an image of the future  
Its a vision and I know who you are  
  
Chorus  
Go away cant you see youre not real  
Open your eye some place far away  
Ive seen the ocean and Ive seen the sky  
Ive got my wings and Im starting to fly  
  
I met a poet tonight behind the masses  
I sang a song about my many true  
Addictions  
I saw myself in a hole down below  
And I know who you are  
  
Chorus  
Im alright though its hard to feel  
Open your eye some place far away  
Ive seen the ocean and Ive seen the sky  
Ive got my wings and Im starting to fly  
  
Oh yeah oh yeah  
  
Open your eyes  
Look to the sky  
Grab your wings  
And then start to fly  
  
2x  
  
Chorus  
Ive seen the ocean and Ive seen the sky  
Ive got my wings and Im starting to fly  
  
2x
