From blackened flame  
Ye shall remain  
Ballistic brethren  
Dark souls in pain  
Defecate on the teachings  
Burn into the dirt  
Suffocate all the preachings  
Bury them in earth  
All hail  
Black flame of satan  
From frozen fire  
Black angels choir  
Safety in numbers 666  
Worship the liar  
Defecate on the teachings  
Burn into the dirt  
Suffocate all the preachings  
Bury them in earth  
All hail  
Black flame of satan  
Black flame of satan  
By candle light  
All hail ye tonight  
The master takes a bow  
From flame of life
