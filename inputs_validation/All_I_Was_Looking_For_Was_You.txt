When I was a boy  
I could not stand the silence  
I needed the noise  
I was underage and overjoyed  
Changing my ways  
But theres so many ways to change  
Im growing up  
Im getting wise Im getting strange  
  
All I was looking for was you  
All I was looking for was you  
I ran my ship into the ground  
Chasing some high and lonesome sound  
From Venice Beach to Kathmandu  
My moneys gone my time it flew  
All I was looking for was you  
All this time Repeat x2  
  
Some marry for love  
Some marry for money  
Dollars and cents  
Through open arms and barbed wire fence  
Running away  
From everything that looks like me  
I heard a voice  
I saw your face it set me free  
  
All I was looking for was you  
All I was looking for was you  
The endless highways I road down  
The girls I kissed in every town  
Midnight on heartbreak avenue  
All twisted up on bitches brew  
All I was looking for was you  
  
Running away  
From everything that looks like me  
I heard a voice  
I saw your face it set me free  
  
All I was looking for was you  
All I was looking for was you  
The endless highways I road down  
The girls I kissed in every town  
Midnight on heartbreak avenue  
All twisted up on bitches brew  
All I was looking for was you  
All this time  
I learned the words I sang the song  
Then I got lost in Babylon  
I ran my ship into the ground  
Chasing some high and lonesome sound  
The lies I told you kept them through  
Nobody knows me like you do  
All I was looking for was you
