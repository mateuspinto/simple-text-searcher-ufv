I like the sunrise cos it brings a new day  
I like the new day it brings new hope they say  
I like the sunrise blazing in the new sky  
Nighttimes so weary and oh so am I  
  
Every evening I wish upon a star  
That my brand new tomorrow isnt very far  
When that heavy blue curtain on night  
Is high in the sky way out of sight  
  
I like the sunrise so heavenly to see  
I like the sunrise and I hope it likes poor me
