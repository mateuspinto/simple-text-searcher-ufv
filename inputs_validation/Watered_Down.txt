In my eyes  
Course and jaded  
Its no surprise  
The lights have faded  
I always walk away  
Youll always hear me say  
I dont need this  
Ive been given such a gift  
Shame to take advantage of it  
Watch it wasting leaves you wanting more  
Be careful what youre wishing for  
  
Nothing that I can hold on to  
With my broken hands  
Not thinking that I should anyway  
So I leave holding nothing  
Dont care what you say  
Cause it makes no difference if I throw it away  
Yeah it makes no difference if I throw it away  
  
Now my days are feeling numbered  
This sad cliche Im hiding under  
This spider web of dreams  
Im stuck here as it seems to be breaking  
Shining brighter than you burn  
Something that I would never learn  
I could never lay this curse on you  
Cursing the days where theres  
  
Nothing that I can hold on to  
With my broken hands  
Not thinking that I should anyway  
So I leave holding nothing  
Dont care what you say  
Cause it makes no difference if I throw it away  
Cause it makes no difference  
Yeah it makes no difference if I throw it away  
It makes no difference  
It makes no difference if I throw it away  
Makes no difference if I throw it away  
Throw it away  
Throw it away  
  
It all just ends up tasting watered down  
Instead of being so complicated  
And everyone has found an easy way out an easy way out  
It all just ends up tasting watered down  
Instead of being so complicated  
And everyone has found an easy way out an easy way out  
  
Nothing that I can hold on to  
With my broken hands  
Not thinking that I should anyway  
So I leave holding nothing  
Dont care what you say  
Cause it makes no difference if I throw it away  
Cause it makes no difference  
Yeah it makes no difference if I throw it away  
It makes no difference  
It makes no difference if I throw it away  
Yeah it makes no difference if I throw it away  
Throw it away  
Throw it away  
  
Get outta town by Sunday  
I say if they dont get outta town  
We kill the men  
We kill the women  
We kill the children  
We kill the babies  
We kill the blind  
We kill the crippled  
We kill the crazy
