Nations come  
Stand in awe  
At the wonder of Your name  
The whole earth sings  
The oceans roar  
To the glory of Your name  
  
Lift our praise to You  
From all eternity  
Lift our hands to You  
Forever shout Your name  
  
Glory to your name  
Forever we will shout Your praise  
Your majesty  
Heaven sings your praise  
Wonder of your majesty  
  
Forever shout Your name  
  
Lift our praise to You  
From all eternity  
Lift our hands to You  
Forever shout Your name  
  
Nations come  
Stand in awe  
At the wonder of Your name  
The whole earth sings  
The oceans roar  
To the glory of Your name  
  
We cry Holy  
We cry Holy  
We cry Holy  
Forever we will sing x3
