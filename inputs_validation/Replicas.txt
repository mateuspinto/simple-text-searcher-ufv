It was hard to avoid  
I suppose it was the shame  
But they didnt even try  
You see wed never met  
And they didnt have names  
There was nothing I could do  
  
So I turned on the crowd  
And I screamed you and you  
It could have been you  
And they seemed to think  
That I looked that way  
Or maybe I was wrong  
  
So I said  
Do you know Mr wall  
And they looked the other way  
And then they smiled at me  
  
But the police came  
And I said it was me  
And I just walked away
