Because he called the forest brother  
Because he called the earth his mother  
They drove him out into the rain  
Some people even said the boy from the country was insane  
  
Because he spoke with fish in the creek  
He tried to tell us that the animals could speak  
Who knows perhaps they do  
How do you know they dont  
Just because theyve never spoken to you  
  
Chorus  
Boy from the country he left his home when he was young  
Boy from the country he loves the sun  
  
He tried to tell us that we should love the land  
We turned our heads and laughed  
And we did not understand  
Sometimes I think that the boy from the country  
Is the only one who sees  
Because the boy from the country  
Doesnt want to see the forest for the trees  
  
Chorus
