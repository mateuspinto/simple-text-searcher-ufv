When I think about the good love you gave to me  
I cry like a baby  
Living without you is driving me crazy  
I cry like a baby  
Lord knows now that youre not a plaything  
Not a toy or a puppet on a string  
  
When I think about a love so sweet now  
I cry like a baby  
Every road is a lonely street now  
I cry like a baby  
Lord knows now that Im not a plaything  
Not a toy or a puppet on a string  
  
Today we passed on the street  
And you just walked on by  
My heart just fell to my feet  
And once again I began to cry  
  
When I think about the good love you gave to me  
I cry like a baby  
Living without you is driving me crazy  
I cry like a baby  
Lord knows now that youre not a plaything  
Not a toy or a puppet on a string  
  
When I think about a love so sweet now  
I cry like a baby  
You left done a lot of running  
I cry like a baby  
When I think about a love so sweet now  
I cry like a baby
