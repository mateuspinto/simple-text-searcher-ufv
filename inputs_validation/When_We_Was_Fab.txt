One Two  
Back then long time ago when grass was green  
Woke up in a daze  
Arrived like strangers in the night  
Fab Doot doot doot doo  
Long time ago when we was fab Fab  
Back when income tax was all we had  
Caressers fleeced you in the morning light  
Casualties at dawn  
And we did it all  
Fab Doot doot doot doo  
Long time ago when we was fab Fab  
In my world you are my only love  
  
And while youre in this world  
The fuzz gonna come and claim you  
But you mo better wise  
When the buzz gonna come and take you away  
Take you away Take you away  
  
The microscopes that magnified the tears  
Studied warts and all  
Still the life flowed on and on
