Give me strength to face the truth the doubt within my soul  
No longer I can justify the bloodshed in his name  
Is it a sin to seek the truth the truth beneath the rose  
Pray with me so I will find the gate to Heavens door  
  
I believed it would justify the means  
It had a hold over me  
  
Blinded to see the cruelty of the beast  
It is the darker side of me Forgive me my sins  
The veil of my dreams deceived all I have seen  
Forgive me for what I have been  
Forgive me my sins  
  
Pray for me cause I have lost my faith in holy wars  
Is paradise denied to me cause I cant take no more  
Has darkness taken over me consumed my mortal soul  
All my virtues sacrificed can Heaven be so cruel  
  
I believed it would justify the means  
It had a hold over me Forgive me my sins  
  
Blinded to see the cruelty of the beast  
It is the darker side of me Forgive me my sins  
The veil of my dreams deceived all I have seen  
Forgive me for what I have been  
Forgive me my sins  
  
Im hoping Im praying  
I wont get lost between two worlds  
For all I have seen the truth lies in between  
Give me the strength to face the wrong that I have done  
Now that I know the darkest side of me  
  
How can blood be our salvation  
And justify the pain that we have caused throughout the times  
Will I learn whats truly sacred  
Will I redeem my soul will truth set me free  
  
Forgive me my sins  
  
Blinded to see the cruelty of the beast  
It is the darker side of me Forgive me my sins  
The veil of my dreams deceived all I have seen  
Forgive me for what I have been  
Forgive me my sins
