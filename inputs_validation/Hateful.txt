Well I got a friend whos a man  
What man  
The man who keeps me from the lovely  
He gives me what I need  
What you need What you got  
I need it all so badly  
  
Chorus  
Oh anything I want he gives it to me  
Anything I want he gives it but not for free  
Its hateful  
And its paid for and Im so grateful to be nowhere  
  
This year Ive lost some friends  
Some friends What friends  
I dunno I aint even noticed  
  
You see I gotta go out again  
Again My friend  
I gotta see that main man  
  
I killed all my nerves  
My nerves What swerves  
And I cant drive so steady  
  
Ive lost my memory  
My mind Behind  
I cant see so clearly  
  
Chorus
