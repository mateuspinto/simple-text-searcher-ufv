When the world has seen the light  
At the beginning of the day  
You will let me call your name  
Cause I love you more than light  
And it will always be this way  
As long as I believe in life  
  
When the morning comes too soon  
And I am still without your love  
You will let me call your name  
Cause I love you more than light  
And it will always be this way  
As long as I believe in life  
  
Whatever happened to the girls I used to know  
Whatever happened to the places that wed go  
When we were running in and out of time  
But all the time we still believed in life  
We were running in and out of time  
But still believed in life  
  
And when the day is almost done  
And there is nothing left to say  
You will let me call your name  
Cause I love you more than light  
And it will always be this way  
As long as I believe in life  
  
Running in and out of time  
But still believed in life  
  
And when the day is almost done  
And there is nothing left to say  
You will let me call your name  
Cause I love you more than light  
And it will always be this way  
As long as I believe  
As long as you believe  
As long as I believe that you believe then Ill believe Ill believe in
life  
As long as I believe that you believe then Ill believe Ill believe in
life  
  
Believe in life  
I believe in life  
I believe in life
