High rise veins of the avenue  
Bright eyes and subtle variations of blue  
Everywhere is balanced there like a rainbow above you  
  
Street lights glisten on the boulevard  
And cold nights make staying alert so hard  
For heavens sake keep me awake so I wont be caught off guard  
Clearly I am a passerby but Ill find a place to stay  
Dear pacific day wont you take me away  
  
Small town hearts of the New Year  
Brought down by gravity crystal clear  
City fog and brave dialogue converge on the frontier  
  
Make haste I feel your heartbeat  
With new taste for speed out on the street  
Find a road to a humble abode where both of our routes meet  
The silver sound is all around and the colors fall like snow  
The feeling of letting go I guess well never know  
  
Cheer up and dry your damp eyes and tell me when it rains  
And Ill blend up that rainbow above you and shoot it through your veins  
Cause your heart has a lack of color and we shouldve known  
That wed grow up sooner or later cause we wasted all our free time alone  
  
Your nerves gather with the altitude  
Exhale the stress so you dont come unglued  
Somewhere there is a happy affair a ghost of a good mood  
Wide eyed panic on the getaway  
The high tide could take me so far away  
VCRs and motorcars unite on the Seventh Day  
A popular gauge will measure the rage of the new PostModern Age  
Cause somewhere along the line all the decades align  
  
We were the crashing whitecaps  
On the ocean  
And what lovely seaside holiday away  
A palm tree in Christmas lights  
My emotion  
Struck a sparkling tone like a xylophone  
As we spent the day alone  
  
Cheer up and dry your damp eyes and tell me when it rains  
And Ill blend up that rainbow above you and shoot it through your veins  
Cause your heart has a lack of color and we shouldve known  
That wed grow up sooner or later cause we wasted all our free time alone
