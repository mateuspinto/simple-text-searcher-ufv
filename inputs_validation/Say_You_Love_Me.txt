Say you love me say Im the one your eyes see  
Tell me you need me deep down inside like I need you  
You see I need you to see me through I want to hear you say Darling Darling  
I love you so say say you love me Say you love me yeah yeah  
Say you love me Say just say you love me  
Say you love me say you love me Through the rain and through the cold  
Together we will never grow old sometimes the going will get a little tough  
And I must admit living with me can be rough I need you to see me through  
I get off when you say baby baby baby I love you  
Say So say say just say you love me want to hear you say say say  
Say you love me you love me oh ooh let me be I want to be your woman  
Together we can make a stand I know I know let me take your trembling hand  
Somewhere in Gods country well settle on a piece of land  
Because I need you to see me through I just want to hear you say  
Oh oh oh baby baby baby I love you I love say you  
So say Say say you love me say you love me
