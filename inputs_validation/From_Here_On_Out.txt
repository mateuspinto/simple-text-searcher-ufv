A little birdie whispered in my ear  
Youve been cooking up a world of fear  
Put your hands in things you shouldnt have known  
You was riding in the danger zone  
  
Well you had us all fooled with your quarterback smile  
And your crocodile tears there for a while  
And my paradigm shifted man youre making me shout  
  
Hey from here from out  
Friends are gonna be hard to come by  
Left us wonderin what it all was about  
He had it easy man he chose the hard way  
Walk that old lonely road in the shadow of a doubt  
From here on out  
  
Should our paths ever decide to cross  
You may wonder what the trouble cost  
That dont matter now life goes on  
Hallelujah the troubles gone  
  
No sense in holding purpose and its better to forgive  
These are things that I must learn to practice while I live  
And my paradigm shifted man youre making me shout  
  
Hey from here from out  
Friends are gonna be hard to come by  
Left us wonderin what it all was about  
He had it easy man he chose the hard way  
Walk that old lonely road in the shadow of a doubt  
  
Hey from here on out  
Let the bugle blow a song of peace time  
Left us wonderin what it all was about  
You may deny it but you carry it with you  
Down that old lonely road in the shadow of a doubt  
Yeah from here on out
