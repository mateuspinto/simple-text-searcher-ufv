Its awful hard to find a job  
On one side the government the other the mob  
Hey hey aint that right  
The workin mans in for a hell of a fight  
  
Oh this country sure looks good to me  
But these fences are comin apart at every nail  
  
Way up on the old dew line  
Some of the boys were feelin fine  
A big light flashed across the sky  
But somethin else went slippin by  
Meanwhile at the Pentagon  
The brass was a wonderin what went wrong  
  
Oh this country sure looks good to me  
But these fences are comin apart at every nail  
  
Hey hey aint that right  
The workin mans in for a hell of a fight  
  
Oh this country sure looks good to me  
But these fences are comin apart at every nail
