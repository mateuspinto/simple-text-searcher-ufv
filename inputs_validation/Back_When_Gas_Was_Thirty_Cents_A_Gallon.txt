Back when gas was thirty cents a gallon America was young and strong and brave  
Lord knows that I didnt have much money  
And my old car had seen some better days  
You were young and fresh as brand new roses  
I was so in love and strong and brave  
Back when gas was thirty cents a gallon and love was only sixty cents away  
I dont think Id know you if Id see you I practice my forgettin till it
works  
Back when gas was thirty cents a gallon I didnt know the meaning of hurt  
  
Back when gas was thirty cents a gallon  
And sweet magnolias line those country roads  
We burned a tank of love most every weekend  
And on work days I helped em fix the roads  
My friends were many and our dreams were certain  
Whoever thought wed go our separate ways  
Back when gas was thirty cents a gallon and love was only sixty cents away  
I dont think Id know you  
Back when gas was thirty cents a gallon and love was only sixty cents away
