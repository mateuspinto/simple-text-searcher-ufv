Today I stumbled from my bed  
With thunder crashing in my head  
My pillow still wet  
From last nights tears  
As I think of giving up  
A voice inside my coffee cup  
Kept crying out  
Ringing in my ears  
  
Chorus  
Dont cry daddy  
Daddy please dont cry  
Daddy youve still got me and little Tommy  
And together well find a brand new mommy  
Daddy daddy please laugh again  
Daddy ride us on your back again  
Oh daddy  
Please  
Dont cry  
  
Why are children always first  
To feel the pain and the hurt the worst  
Its true but somehow  
It just dont seem right  
Cause every time I cry I know  
It hurts my little children so I wonder  
Will it be the same tonight  
  
Chorusx2  
Oh daddy please dont cry
