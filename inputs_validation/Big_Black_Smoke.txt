She was sick and tired of country life  
A little country home  
A little country folk  
Made her blood run cold  
Now her mother pines her heart away  
Looking for her child in the big black smoke  
In the big black smoke  
  
Frailest purest girl the world has seen  
According to her ma according to her pa  
And everybody said  
That she knew no sin and did no wrong  
Till she walked the streets of the big black smoke  
Of the big black smoke  
  
Well she slept in caffs and coffee bars and bowling alleys  
And every penny she had  
Was spent on purple hearts and cigarettes  
  
She took all her pretty coloured clothes  
And ran away from home  
And the boy next door  
For a boy named Joe  
And he took her money for the rent  
And tried to drag her down in the big black smoke  
In the big black smoke  
  
In the big black smoke  
In the big black smoke
