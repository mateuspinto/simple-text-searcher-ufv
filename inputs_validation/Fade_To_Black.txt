Life it seems will fade away  
Drifting further everyday  
Getting lost within myself  
Nothing matters no one else  
I have lost the will to live  
Simply nothing more to give  
There is nothing more for me  
Need the end to set me free  
  
Things not what they used to be  
Missing one inside of me  
Deathly loss this cant be real  
Cant stand this hell I feel  
Emptiness is filling me  
To the point of agony  
Growing darkness taking dawn  
I was me but now hes gone  
  
No one but me can save myself but its too late  
Now I cant think think why I should even try  
  
Yesterday seems as though it never existed  
Death greets me warm now I will just say goodbye  
Goodbye
