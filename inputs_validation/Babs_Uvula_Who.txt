Ive got a knack for fucking everything up  
My temper flies and I get myself all wound up  
My fuse is short and my blood pressure is high  
I lose control and I get myself all wound up  
Tension mounts and I fly off the wall  
I self destruct and I get myself all wound up  
Petulance and irritation sets in  
I throw a tantrum and I get myself all wound up  
Chip on my shoulder and a leech on my back  
Stuck in a rut and I get myself all wound up  
Killed my composure and it will never come back  
Loss of control and I get myself all wound up  
Blown out of proportion again  
My temper snaps and I get myself all wound up  
Spontaneous combustion  
Panic attack  
I slipped a gear and I get myself all wound up
