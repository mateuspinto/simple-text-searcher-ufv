A to be  
Different degrees  
  
So much style without substance  
So much stuff without style  
Its hard to recognize the real thing  
It comes along once in a while  
  
Like a rare and precious metal  
Beneath a ton of rock  
It takes some time and trouble  
To separate from the stock  
You sometimes have to listen to  
A lot of useless talk  
  
Shapes and forms  
Against the norms  
Against the run of the mill  
Swimming against the stream  
Life in two dimensions  
Is a mass production scheme  
  
So much poison in power  
The principles get left out  
So much mind on the matter  
The spirit gets forgotten about  
Like a righteous inspiration  
Overlooked in haste  
Like a teardrop in the Ocean  
A diamond in the waste  
Some worldviews are spacious  
And some are merely spaced  
  
Against the run of the mill  
Static as it seems  
We break the surface tension  
With our wild kinetic dreams  
Curves and lines  
Of grand designs
