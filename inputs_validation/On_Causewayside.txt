Did they build this tenement  
With stone from Fife  
Does it have a memory  
Of an earlier life  
  
Before it was transported  
To be cut with pride  
And built up to let look down  
On Causewayside  
  
At the edge of the pavement  
There stands a girl  
Of no more than three  
Years in this world  
  
Looking up at her mother  
With sheer delight  
For a moment  
On Causewayside  
  
The rats in the sewer  
And the autumn sky  
Stand still for a moment  
And so do I  
  
As we touch the eternal  
Then the cold wind sighed  
And blowed it away  
Down Causewayside
