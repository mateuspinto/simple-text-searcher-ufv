Christmas time is here  
Happiness and cheer  
Fun for all that children call  
Their favorite time of the year  
  
Snowflakes in the air  
Carols everywhere  
Olden times and ancient rhymes  
Of love and dreams to share  
  
Sleigh bells in the air  
Beauty everywhere  
Yuletide by the fireside  
And joyful memories there  
  
Christmas time is here  
Well be drawing near  
Oh that we could always see  
Such spirit through the year  
Oh that we could always see  
Such spirit through the year
