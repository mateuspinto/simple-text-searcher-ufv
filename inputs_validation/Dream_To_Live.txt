Set off for America far across the ragin sea  
From the frozen coves of my island home  
To the land of liberty  
I have to leave my girl behind  
Until I make my way  
Oh Molly dear please wait for me  
Ill come back for you some day  
We landed hard in Boston  
And Id never seen the like  
A small boat boy from around the bay  
In this sea of shining lights  
Two days in I got a job  
Building towers of high steel  
I had to learn to not look down  
And I quickly learned to kneel  
All I need is one good nights sleep  
In your loving arms to mend  
We sleep to dream  
And we dream to live  
Will I live to love you again  
I saved every cent I could  
But the months turned into years  
Then a letter came from Molly  
And confirmed my deepest fears  
She would no longer wait for me  
Shed found a better man  
I might have been in America  
But my heart was broken  
In Newfoundland  
My working days are over now  
And my children have all grown  
I did the best with what I had  
But some days I feel alone  
I often wonder where you are  
Do you still know my name  
Deep inside this old mans heart  
Theres a love that still remains
