Now as we speed a little faster through the stars  
To this new world of ours  
With the seed that the garden requires  
  
And as we drift a little further from the shore  
Like the sea evermore  
Im the ivy that clings round your door  
  
When you wake up  
You will find  
That youre not where you left yourself  
  
Ahhhh  
Ahhhh  
  
Now as we drift a little further down the stream  
Was it all what it seemed  
Was it true  
Was it real  
Or just a dream  
  
When you wake up  
You will find  
That youre not where you left yourself  
  
Ahhhh  
Ahhhh  
  
Now as we speed a little faster through the stars  
Ahhhh  
Ahhhh  
Ahhhh
