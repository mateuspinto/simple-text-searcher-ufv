Across the earth  
Your praises rise  
We lift our voice  
Call upon Your Name  
You gave us hope  
That never ends  
In Christ alone  
The victory remains  
  
For You are great and mighty  
Let the nations sing  
  
Your praise fills the heavens  
For You have redeemed us  
Our hope is in You alone  
The cross has released us  
To sing of Your freedom  
By grace You make all things new  
  
You came to us  
To save our lives  
The love of God  
Was seen upon the cross  
You rose again  
The glory Yours  
The highest praise  
Belongs to You alone  
  
Your kingdom reigns  
Your kingdom reigns  
Above all  
Above all
