Im sorry to have taken so long  
It must have been a bitch while I was gone  
You mind if I sit down for a while  
Youll reacquaint yourself with my style  
Well how could you have waited so long  
It must have been a bitch while I was gone  
All this time you put up a fear  
For a hundred thousand years  
Im sorry to have taken so long  
It must have been a bitch while I was gone  
All this time you put up a fear  
For a hundred thousand years  
And baby wont you let me  
I think Im goin out of my head  
Im just about to ooh yeah ha  
Im sorry to have taken so long  
It must have been a bitch while I was gone  
You mind if I sit down for a while would you babe  
Youll reacquaint yourself with my style
