Can I forget you  
Or will my heart remind me  
That once we walked in a moonlight dream  
  
Can I forget you  
Or will my heart remind me  
How sweet you made the moonlight seem  
  
Will the glory of your nearness fade  
As moonlight fades in a veil of rain  
  
Can I forget you  
When every night reminds me  
How much I want you back again  
  
Can I forget you  
When every night reminds me  
How much I want you back again
