I was always baby I was always  
Well almost always true to you  
Met a pretty mademoiselle  
Her papa owned a small hotel  
Oh I was almost always true to you  
  
I resisted tho my arm was twisted  
I was almost always true to you  
Stayed away from drinkin wine  
Thought about you all the time  
Oh I was almost always true to you  
  
Kept refusin dont jump to conclusions  
I was almost always true to you  
I would never grab like this  
I would never steal a kiss  
Oh I was almost always true to you
