Love me tender love me true  
Oooh baby what a song could do  
We were sharp like needles in the dark no question mark  
My friend billy was one of a kind  
Growin up and runnin wild  
We could take a sunset and make it real  
We stood together on the edge of a knife  
Fools To be friends brothers for life  
  
And we have seen the night run its a thousand miles away  
Yes we have seen the night run it passed us by in just one day  
  
Chorus 1  
Used to say well its me and you  
Oooh we could make dreams come true  
And we put some magic in this night oh feels so right  
Came across your photograph  
Everything was just a laugh  
Where do you go when you reach the end  
Into the night we would explode  
With hand on my heart rules of the road  
  
Chorus 1 x2  
  
Chorus 2  
Big city lights they fade then they go  
Along with your sense of humor no  
Some people give up and lose the fight  
We could prove it night after night after  
  
Chorus 2 x3
