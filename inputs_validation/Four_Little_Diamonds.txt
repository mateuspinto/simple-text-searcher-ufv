I used to think she was the greatest thing  
I really cared gave her a diamond ring  
She said shed rather die than ever leave me  
Well I never saw her face since then  
And if the law dont get her then I will  
Four little diamonds  
  
She must be somewhere on the open road  
She always said she was a lonely one  
She gets you down with her tales of woe  
She took me for everything  
And if the law dont get her then I will  
Four little diamonds  
  
I looked around I climbed up high into the dawn  
But she was gone with the night  
I thought about the things she said  
And all the things wed done  
But where could she run she ran away  
Theres just no answer to give  
  
I keep wonderin about her day and night  
She probably thinks I was a fool shes right  
She dont know it  
But Im gonna keep on searchin for that woman  
Im gonna search everywhere  
And if the law dont get her then I will  
Four little diamonds  
  
I looked around I climbed up high into the dawn  
But she was gone with the night  
I thought about the things she said  
And all the things wed done  
But where could she run she ran away  
Theres just no answer to give  
  
I still hear her callin out to me  
I still listen for her endlessly  
But it never even crossed my mind she was a cheater  
I gotta find where she hides  
Cause if the law dont get her then I will  
Four little diamonds
