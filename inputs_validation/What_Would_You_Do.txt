Ive come a long way by car  
The road went narrow  
The bridges too far  
Screaming at 90  
Whisper at 10  
Feel the towns make you spend  
  
Another city phone rings  
Letting tears come through  
Mixed among feelings  
Fed on your body  
Fed on your mind  
Words that always remind  
  
Closed eyes and no more breathing  
A trick I had played  
To scare the living  
She laughs at my game  
Questions if Im sane  
And all we can do is grin  
  
Look see the story  
What would you do  
All the facts before me  
What would you do
