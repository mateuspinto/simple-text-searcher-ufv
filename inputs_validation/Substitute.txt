You think we look pretty good together  
You think my shoes are made of leather  
  
But Im a substitute for another guy  
I look pretty tall but my heels are high  
The simple things you see are all complicated  
I look pretty young but Im just backdated yeah  
  
Substitute your lies for fact  
I can see right through your plastic mac  
I look all white but my dad was black  
My fine looking suit is really made out of sack  
  
I was born with a plastic spoon in my mouth  
The north side of my town faced east and the east was facing south  
And now you dare to look me in the eye  
Those crocodile tears are what you cry  
Its a genuine problem you wont try  
To work it out at all you just pass it by pass it by  
  
Substitute me for him  
Substitute my coke for gin  
Substitute you for my mum  
At least Ill get my washing done
