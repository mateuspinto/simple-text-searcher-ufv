When was the point that you showed  
Move on to another love  
Laughing with kindness  
When did you decide to break  
How much more will it take for two people to be happy  
But you lied  
Looked me straight in the eye  
As if you had nothing to hide  
With no shame  
As if we were still the same  
But now Im back in the game  
Im over you  
  
When did you decide to go  
Were you ever going to let me know  
I was deciding  
When did you decide to change  
What did I do that made our situation weary  
  
When you lied  
You looked me straight in the eye  
As if you had nothng to hide  
With no shame  
As if we still were the same  
But now Im back in the game  
Im over you  
  
Who was the one to tell  
I thought I knew you way too well  
But I didnt  
The thought of you thinking of him  
Assumptions made on a whim  
Drives me crazy  
  
Cause you lied  
Looked me staight in the eye  
As if you had nothing to hide  
But I know you did  
With no shame  
As if we still were the same  
But now Im back in the game  
Im Over you
