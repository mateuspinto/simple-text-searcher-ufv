The oceans of the world were the home of big blue  
He was the greatest monster that the world ever knew  
And the place that he loved best  
Was the waters to the west  
Around the blue Pacific he did roam  
  
Big Blue moved alone for a mighty blue was he  
And the battles of the whales was an awesome sight to see  
And he took them one by one and he drove them all away  
In the mating of the day he was the king  
  
Big blue had fifty wives and he sired forty sons  
Though most of them feel victim to the cruel harpoon guns  
Ah but he was too much wise to get caught by the gunners eyes  
And so he lived at sea a hundred years  
  
His mouth was as large as a tunnel so they say  
His hide was thick as leather and his eyes quick and small  
And his back was all scarred by the times he got away  
And he knew the smell of whalers did Big Blue  
  
Big Blue passed away to his natural decay  
Beside the Arctic Circle as he travelled up that way  
And there never was a man who was born with a gunners hand  
Who ever took a pan to Big Blue  
  
Now the gray whale has run and the sperm is almost done  
The finbacks and the Greenland rights have all passed and gone  
Theyve been taken by the men for the money they could spend  
And the killing never ends it just goes on  
  
The oceans of the earth were the home of big blue  
He was the greatest monster that the world ever knew  
And the place that he loved best was the waters to the west  
Around the blue Pacific he did roam
