Yea yea yea yea  
This is the Carter motherfucker yea  
And in my building I must keep it real  
  
And man I miss the times we would shine you would keep on your side  
You would teach me how to ride and you would teach me how to pry  
Then we get on the line and go over our lines  
We were in the same position and thats when you change position shit  
I never change and I miss ya and its strange but I never forget ya  
Throw that at you and them bitches homie  
And I know that aint you wit that dissing on me  
Thats why I never replied and never will just let em live phony  
If ya ever died I swear to God I got yo kids homie  
Whats mine is their I gotta give homie and yea  
We still a army in this bitch homie  
Yea Cash Money still the shit homie shit homie  
Whats really real is you feeling me nigga  
That Hot Boy shit still in me nigga word the giggity nigga  
And I aint got time to speak the history  
I miss you and I know you missing  
Gizzle but  
  
Chorus x2  
Man I miss my dogsyea  
Many nights club poppingyea  
Many nights we were blowing treesyea  
Many nights we were hustlingyea  
Man I miss my dogsyea  
Me and you through thick and thinyea  
Me and you through the very endyea  
For only you I was in the gameyea  
  
And I remember when you came to the click  
I had already made my name in the click but you got famous and shit  
I got my soldier rag and dangled my shit  
I was down to just to hang wit you shit  
And I banged to the boogie bang bang wit yo click  
And I aint even from the 33rd Ward my hood was angry at me shit  
But I rose to my feet played the post wit the heat  
At them shows while you performed and posed  
I was waiting for a nigga to jump see I was patient but was ready to duck  
Cause you my brother chump  
Real Gs never buckle up  
But every family aint filled wit gangstas thats real  
And thats real and I would never turn my back or turn ya down  
Even if you turned around motherfucker  
But history is history  
I miss you and I know you missing me  
Juve but  
  
Chorus x2  
  
You was my nigga my nerd my joy my herb  
My main motherfucking man Turk  
My other my partner I was teacher he was father  
I skilled he schooled we chilled we moved  
We thug we hung we ate we slept  
We lived we died I stayed you left  
Remember how we played to the left  
And we stayed out of trouble cause we stayed to our self  
Member B and Slim leaving hand the kis over  
Tell me not to go Uptown and we went straight to tha Nolia  
While I watched you reunite wit yo soljas  
And yo mom and brothers while I lied to the stunna  
Yea those were the times my brother  
Now I recognize real and I honor my brother  
Yea nigga sub mage my brother the Sqads my brother  
The nigga you left behind is my brothers  
  
Chorus x2
