Dedicated to A M Klein 19091972  
Hurt once and for all into silence  
A long pain ending without a song to prove it  
Who could stand beside you so close to Eden  
When you glinted in every eye the heldhigh  
Razor shivering every ram and son  
And now the silent loony bin where  
The shadows live in the rafters like  
Dayweary bats  
Until the turning mind a radar signal  
Lures them to exaggerate  
Mountainsize on the white stone wall  
Your tiny limp  
How can I leave you in such a house  
Are there no more saints and wizards  
To praise their ways with pupils  
No more evil to stun with the slap  
Of a wet red tongue  
Did you confuse the Messiah in a mirror  
And rest because he had finally come  
Let me cry Help beside you Teacher  
I have entered under this dark roof  
As fearlessly as an honoured son  
Enters his fathers house
