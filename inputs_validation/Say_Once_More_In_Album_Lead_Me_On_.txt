Ohhh  
  
Let me say once more that I love you  
Let me say one time maybe two  
That I love the way that you love me  
And I wish I knew more of you  
  
Let me say once more that I love you  
Let me say one time maybe two  
That I love the way that you love me  
And I wish I knew more of you  
  
Tell me that time cant erase  
This look of love on your face  
  
Let me say once more that I need you  
One more time or just maybe two  
Oh my life will always be richer  
For the time Ive spent here with you  
  
Let me say once more that I love you  
Let me say one time maybe two  
That I love the way that you love me  
And I wish I knew more of you  
  
Tell me that time wont erase  
The way that my heart sees your face  
  
I call your name  
You look my way  
Its clear you trust each word I say  
When life is long and problems come  
Youll always be my only one  
So now were standing face to face  
And with one look your eyes embrace me  
Squeeze away each haunting fear  
And say the words I long to hear  
  
Tell me that time wont erase  
This look of love  
  
Ohhhh  
  
Let me say once more  
I love you  
I do I do I do I do I do  
  
Let me say once more that I love you  
Let me say one time maybe two  
That I love the way that you love me  
And I wish I knew more of you  
  
Let me say once more that I love you  
One more time or just maybe two  
That I love the way that you love me  
And I want to know more of you  
  
I call your name  
You look my way I love you  
Its clear you trust each word I say I do  
When life is long and problems come  
Youll always be my only one  
So now were standing face to face Oh I need you  
And with one look your eyes embrace me I want you  
Squeeze away each haunting fear More and more and more  
And say the words I long to hear  
  
I call your name Let me say once more  
You look my way That I love you  
Its clear you trust each word I say Let me say one time maybe two  
When life is long and problems come That I love the way that you love  
Me  
Youll always be my only one And I wish I knew more of you  
So now were standing face to face Let me say once more that I love you  
And with one look your eyes embrace me Let me say one time maybe two  
Squeeze away each haunting fear That I love the way that you love me
