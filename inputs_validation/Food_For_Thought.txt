Ivory Madonna dying in the dust  
Waiting for the manna coming from the west  
Barren is her bosom empty as her eyes  
Death a certain harvest scattered from the skies  
  
Skin and bones is creeping doesnt know hes dead  
Ancient eyes are peeping from his infant head  
Politicians argue sharpening their knives  
Drawing up their Bargains trading baby lives  
  
Ivory Madonna dying in the dust  
Waiting for the manna coming from the west  
  
Hear the bells are ringing Christmas on its way  
Hear the angels singing what is that they say  
Eat and drink rejoicing joy is here to stay  
Jesus son of Mary is born again today  
  
Ivory Madonna dying in the dust  
Waiting for the manna coming from the west  
Ivory Madonna dying in the dust  
Waiting for the manna coming from the west
