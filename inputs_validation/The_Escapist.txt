Whos there knocking at my window  
The owl and the Dead Boy  
This night whispers my name  
All the dying children  
  
Virgin snow beneath my feet  
Painting the world in white  
I tread the way and lose myself into a tale  
  
Come hell or high water  
My search will go on  
Clayborn Voyage without an end  
  
A nightingale in a golden cage  
Thats me locked inside realitys maze  
Come someone make my heavy heart light  
Come undone bring me back to life  
It all starts with a lullaby  
  
Journey homeward bound  
A sound of a dolphin calling  
Tearing off the mask of man  
The tower my sole guide  
  
This is who I am  
Escapist paradise seeker  
Farewell now time to fly  
Out of sight out of time away from all lies  
  
A nightingale in a golden cage  
Thats me locked inside realitys maze  
Come someone make my heavy heart light  
Come undone bring me back to life  
It all starts with a lullaby
