As it was before shall it ever ever be  
Hear it on the crying wind  
Heart it weeping on the sea  
Through the winder valley wild and through the darkest night  
Here comes the evil news of the coming fight  
So love bring your birds bring your feathers of peace  
All through the storm let the tides release  
Love bring your birds bring your feathers of peace  
All through the storm let the tides release  
  
Chorus  
Come on down lost angel find us now  
From the clouds above right down to the ground  
Come on down lost angel find us now  
From the clouds above right down to the ground  
Lost Angels come on down  
  
Stardust yeah we are and the river is pushed to bend  
Too much too much of man  
And stardust we will someday be again  
Oh love bring your birds bring your feathers of peace  
All through the storm let the tide release  
Love bring your birds bring your feathers of peace  
All through the storm let the tide release  
  
Chorus
