Theres a girl Ill remember  
Oh for such a long long time  
This girl Ill remember  
She was an old flame of mine  
  
Beneath the stars just sipping wine  
Young lovers then in summertime  
Ill always remember  
That old flame of mine  
  
Love she comes and goes  
True love she hides then shows  
My love may I propose  
That love she comes and goes  
  
Two hearts together two hearts alight  
To keep us warm on winter nights  
With each dying ember  
I remember that old flame of mine  
  
Once this flame it did brightly blaze  
Among the ashes there still remains  
A glowing spark in my heart  
For that old flame of mine
