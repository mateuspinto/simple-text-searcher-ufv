I woke up on Angel Island in your arms  
To the smell of burning bridges  
And the sound of those alarms in my head  
We should have stayed in bed  
  
But we held them up for ransom anyway  
When the coldest days of winter were  
The summers that we took aim at the Bay  
And grateful wasnt dead  
  
And like your lips were only made for me to kiss  
Oh oh oh oh  
We were made for this  
  
While the girls all danced beneath a burning man  
And the last waltz did somersaults to finish off the Band  
Where they began in a wonder Winterland  
All we ever wanted was to be alone  
Learning how to fly to Sly trying to find home  
Underneath the Family Stone  
  
And just like New Years Day was made to reminisce  
Oh oh oh oh  
We were made for this  
  
Love and stardust settle on us like a net  
While Buckleys Hallelujah fills our ears from your cassette  
While my heart stops beating and you stop breathing Juliette  
  
Youre the only thing Im ever gonna miss  
Oh oh oh oh  
We were made for this
