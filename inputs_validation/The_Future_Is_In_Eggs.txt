Roses before sign  
This one pushed his weight  
Day the chain  
Dogs barking the sign flashing  
Come one and all to the execution  
Shot shot bang go  
clothing to films we  
Die string to sadistI have no clue here  
And pirates coffee  
Computer the fat birds  
Loafing on bringlers  
Floating on a leg  
Pissing from a keg  
The future is in eggs the future is in eggs  
Spying without chim  
Choking out a grin  
Splitting kids in cub scout suits  
Are crushed by marching army boots  
Their fearless leader on his back  
Cut from a cocaine heart attack  
You knew we had to go  
Its an ordinary show  
The movie of the year  
Stars realistic beer  
Billy says something  
Act what is does  
Theres pervertically nothing  
To help you and me  
Here is my human machine  
With incredible mileage  
Invective and clean  
You kids arent smiling smiling  
And all the coalition no nutrition
