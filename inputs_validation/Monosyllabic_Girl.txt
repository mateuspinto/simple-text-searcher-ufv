I take her to the aquarium she says shark  
I take her to the planetarium she says dark  
I take her to the seaside  
Where she likes to spin and twirl  
She says sure and cool and yeah  
Shes my monosyllabic girl  
  
I take her to the university she says huh  
I take her to anniversary she says one  
I take her to jewelry store  
I say diamonds she says pearl  
Oh everyone knows Im in love  
With a monosyllabic girl
