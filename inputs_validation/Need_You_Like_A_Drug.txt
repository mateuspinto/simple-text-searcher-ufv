Youve got a halo hanging over your head  
Nothing can touch you  
Nothing can hurt you  
  
You take the world out of my eyes  
You suck the words out of my mouth  
When we kiss  
  
Need you like a drug  
Need you like a drug  
Cant make it stop  
Keep fucking it up  
Need you like a drug  
  
Dont ever want to be like you  
You have your friends calling you to say  
That nothing can touch you  
Nothing can hurt you  
Nothing can take your fantasy away  
Nothing can touch you  
Nothing can hurt you  
When we kiss  
  
It stings like a needle in me
