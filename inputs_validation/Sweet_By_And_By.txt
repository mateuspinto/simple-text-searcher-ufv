Theres a land that is fairer than day  
And by faith we can see it afar  
And the father waits over the way  
To prepare us a dwelling place there  
  
In the sweet by and by  
We shall meet on that beautiful shore  
In the sweet by and by  
We shall meet on that beautiful shore  
  
To our bountiful father above  
We will offer our tribute of praise  
For the glorious gift of his love  
And the blessings that hallow our days  
  
In the sweet by and by  
We shall meet on that beautiful shore  
In the sweet by and by  
We shall meet on that beautiful shore  
  
In the sweet by and by  
We shall meet on that beautiful shore  
In the sweet by and by  
We shall meet on that beautiful shore  
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
