Sunrise creepin in your eyes  
Cold empty side walks  
Miles away from trustin someone  
Far from giving up  
Young blood cry tough  
Mean street run  
Theres a hunger inside you  
Desperate rebel runaway  
Far from giving up  
  
Someday someway all very soon  
Youll end long nights chasin the moon  
  
War with yourself  
Makes you feel better  
Caught behind the lines  
Troubles child  
Faith finds a cure  
It makes you feel better  
You know you can shine  
Troubled child  
  
Voices echo from the past  
Decisions made for you  
Trials they made  
To touch your heart  
Never found their way
