Speak to the sinners  
Is it a crime for  
Stopping the innocent  
Rotting all away  
Rotting all away  
  
Have you forgotten  
All that I live for  
Hardened forever  
You will always be the same  
Always be the same  
  
Every time I close my eyes  
Angels visit me and feed me lies time  
To the end of my life  
Ill ask you why why why  
Tell me why  
  
You miss somebody  
Is it the same for  
Sorry for everything  
I thought Id given you  
Thought Id given you  
  
Trapped in the cavern  
Is it a shame for  
Endlessly searching  
For the force behind the wall  
The force behind the wall  
  
I Cant  
  
Every time I close my eyes  
Angels visit me and feed me lies time  
To the end of my life  
Ill ask you why why why  
Tell me why  
  
My Friend This is what you
