When I was just a child my life was  
Oh so simple  
And the ways of the great world  
Seemed strange and funny  
Then when I was a young man  
I learned of that machine  
That turns out all those bails of precious money  
  
Money money money money money money money money money money  
Oh that money machine  
Now you can measure you manhood by it  
You can get your children to try it  
You can bring your enemies to their knees  
With the possible exception of the North Vietnamese  
It takes a strong hit from the money machine sitting on top on top of the
world  
Strong hit from the money machine  
Sitting on top on top of the world  
  
Oh General Motors and IBM  
AFLCIO and all the kings men  
When I began the game  
See me singing about the fire and rain  
Let me just say it again  
Ive seen fives and Ive seen tens  
It was a strong hit from the money machine Sitting on top on top of the
world  
Strong hit from the money machine  
Sitting on top on top of the world  
  
Money money money money money money money money money money ha ha
ha  
Money money money money money money money money money money  
Give me that dough give me that dough give me that dough give me that
dough  
  
Been living in the lap of luxury too long  
Please Mr DJ wont you play my song  
Maybe my baby will listen on the radio  
Come back home to me help me spend my dough  
I need a strong hit from the money machine Sitting on top on top of the
goddamn world  
Strong hit babe from the money machine woo sitting on top on top of the
world  
  
Money money money money money money money money money money  
Money money money money money money money money money money  
From that money machine
