Like the sound of silence calling  
I hear your voice and suddenly Im falling  
Lost in a dream  
Like the echoes of our souls are meeting  
You say those words my heart stops beating  
I wonder what it means  
What could it be that comes over me  
At times I cant move  
At times I cant hardly breathe  
  
When you say you love me  
The world goes still so still inside  
When you say you love me  
For a moment theres no one else alive  
  
Youre the one Ive always thought of  
I dont know how but I feel sheltered in your love  
Youre where I belong  
And when youre with me if I close my eyes  
There are times I swear I feel like I can fly  
For a moment in time  
Somewhere between  
The heavens and earth  
Im frozen in time  
Oh when you say those words  
  
When you say you love me  
The world goes still so still inside  
When you say you love me  
For a moment theres no one else alive  
  
And this journey that were on  
How far weve come and I  
Celebrate every moment  
When you say you love me  
Thats all you have to say  
Ill always feel this way  
  
When you say you love me  
The world goes still so still inside and  
When you say you love me  
In that moment I know why Im alive  
  
When you say you love me  
  
When you say you love me  
Do you know how I love you
