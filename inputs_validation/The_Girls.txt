Hey  
  
I remember the day I found her  
You know it was just like magic  
The way things happened  
Oh so natural  
  
She smiles so sweetly  
And I fell completely  
And the words from her lips  
Filled with such tenderness that I could not resist  
  
Chorus  
Dont you know the girls so right for me  
Everything we do just comes so easily  
The girls so right for me  
There in this lonely world I found the girl thats right for me  
  
Sunday morning  
The day is starting  
And were wrap around each other  
Perfect lovers under the covers baby  
  
The way that my heart is beating  
This gotta be the real thing  
And its hand and the glove  
Baby this kind of love  
I know that she still want  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
I thought that I have good love before  
Baby to you I feel it all  
And darling you should be something  
That day by day you keep that coming  
  
Dont you know the girls so right for me  
Everything we do just comes so easily  
The girls so right for me  
There in this lonely world I found the girl thats right for me  
  
And the girl so right for me  
Yeah  
Everything we do  
You know the girl  
Hey  
In this lonely world I found the girl so right for me  
  
Repeat till fade
