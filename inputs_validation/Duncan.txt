Couple in the next room  
bound to win a prize  
theyve been going at it all night long  
Well Im tryin to get some sleep  
but these motel walls are cheap  
Lincoln Duncan is my name  
and heres my song heres my song  
  
My father was a fisherman  
my mama was a fishermans friend  
and I was born in the boredom and the chowder  
So when I reached my prime  
I left my home in the Maritimes  
headed down the turnpike for New England sweet New England  
  
Holes in my confidence  
holes in the knees of my jeans  
I was left without a penny in my pocket  
Oooowee I was about as destituted as a kid could be  
and I wished I wore a ring so I could hock it  
Id like to hock it  
  
A young girl in a parkin lot  
was preaching to a crowd  
singing sacred songs  
and reading from the Bible  
Well I told her I was lost  
and she told all about the Pentecost  
and I seen that girl as the road to my survival  
my survival  
  
Just later on  
the very same night  
when I crept to her tent with a flashlight  
and my long years of innocence ended  
well she took me to the woods  
sayin Here comes something and it feels so good  
and just like a dog I was befriended I was befriended  
  
Oh oh what a night  
oh what a garden of delight  
Even now that sweet memory lingers  
I was playing my guitar  
lyin underneath the stars  
just thankin the Lord  
for my fingers  
for my fingers
