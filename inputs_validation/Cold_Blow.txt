My cap is frozen to my head  
My heart is like a lump of lead  
My shoes are frozen to my feet  
With standing at your window  
  
Let me in the soldier cried  
Cold blow the rainy night  
Oh let me in the soldier cried  
Ill not go back again  O  
  
My fathers walking on the street  
My mother the chamber keys do keep  
The doors and windows they do creak  
I dare not let you in  O  
  
Let me in the soldier cried  
Cold blow and the rainy night  
O let me in the soldier cried  
For Ill not go back again  O  
  
Oh then she rose and let him in  
And kissed his ruby lips and chin  
And then they went to bed again  
And soon he gained her favor  
  
Then she blessed the rainy night  
She rose and let him in  O  
Now since you had your will of me  
Soldier will you marry me  
  
No such thing can ever be  
So fare you well for ever  
Then she cursed the rainy night  
Cold blow and the rainy night  
  
O then she cursed the rainy night  
That ever she let him in  O  
Then he jumped out of the bed  
He put his cap upon his head  
And she had lost her maidenhead  
And her mother heard the din  O  
  
Then she cursed the rainy night  
Cold blow and the rainy night  
O then she cursed the rainy night  
That ever she let him in  O
