Violence surround me  
Violence in society  
Violence in our eyes  
Violence in their cries  
Violence its our fate  
Violence its too late  
Violence no escape  
Violence give in to hate  
  
Is it human nature to act like animals  
Were all guilty were all criminals  
Selfish species headed for a self destruction  
Violent product of a moral corruption  
  
Violence for love  
Violence because of hate  
Violence revolution  
Violence of the state  
Violence you will find  
Violence it grips your mind  
Violence its too late  
Violence give in to hate
