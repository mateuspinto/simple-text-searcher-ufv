Listen to my voice  
And please try to understand  
The one you call Messiah is a lie  
You are just a game and It has won  
You are not the plan  
And your beginning to annoy  
You will never see  
You will never know eternal peace  
The places promised by your faith  
The God you love is gone  
He lies broken by your shame  
The thing that took His place already died  
Send black Angels for you  
It will send Angels  
I am just a voice  
Only you are pure enough for truth  
That noone else will hear  
And then tear away belief  
You must write The Book  
Only you can save the light of man  
It will send Angels  
Send black Angels for you
