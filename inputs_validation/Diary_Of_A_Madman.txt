Screaming at the window  
Watch me die another day  
Hopeless situation endless price I have to pay  
  
Sanity now its beyond me theres no choice  
  
Diary of a madman  
Walk the line again today  
Entries of confusion  
Dear diary Im here to stay  
  
Manic depression befriends me  
Hear his voice  
Sanity now its beyond me  
Theres no choice  
  
A sickened mind and spirit  
The mirror tells me lies  
Could I mistake myself for someone  
Who lives behind my eyes  
Will he escape my soul  
Or will he live in me  
Is he tryin to get out or tryin to enter me  
  
Voices in the darkness  
Scream away my mental health  
Can I ask a question  
To help me save me from myself  
  
Enemies fill up the pages  
Are they me  
Monday till Sunday in stages  
Set me free
