Watch out now take care  
Beware of falling swingers  
Dropping all around you  
The pain that often mingles  
In your fingertips  
Beware of darkness  
Watch out now take care  
Beware the thoughts that linger  
Winding up inside your head  
The hopelessness around you  
In the dead of night  
Beware of sadness  
It can hit you  
It can hurt you  
Make you sore  
And what is more  
That is not what  
You are here for  
Watch out now take care  
Beware of soft shoe shufflers  
Dancing down the sidewalks  
As each unconscious sufferer  
Wanders aimlessly  
Beware of maya  
Watch out now take care  
Beware of greedy leaders  
Theyll take you where you should not go  
While weeping atlas cedars  
They just want to grow grow and grow  
Beware of darkness
