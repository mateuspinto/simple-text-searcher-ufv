The blessed dawn of Christmas day  
As honestly as children pray  
The warmth that melts the eve away  
The holiness of afterglow  
  
I rose to join the glorious morn  
Whose calm and splendor would adorn  
The virgin mothers infant born  
The blessed dawn of Christmas day  
  
The hearts of sinners reconciled  
Amid the ancient morrow mild  
Exalt the birth of Marys child  
The blessed dawn of Christmas day  
  
I pray one day my heart will see  
The light of Gods eternity  
And know that Jesus died for me  
Now close my eyes  
So I may rise  
At blessed dawn of Christmas day
