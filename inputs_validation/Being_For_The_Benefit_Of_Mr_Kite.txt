For the benefit of Mr Kite  
There will be a show tonight on trampoline  
The Hendersons will all be there  
Late of Pablo Fanques Fairwhat a scene  
Over men and horses hoops and garters  
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire  
In this way Mr K will challenge the world  
  
The celebrated Mr K  
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishops Gate  
The Hendersons will dance and sing  
As Mr Kite flies through the ring dont be late  
Messrs K and H assure the public  
Their production will be second to none  
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz  
  
The band begins at ten to six  
When Mr K performs his tricks without a sound  
And Mr H will demonstrate  
Ten somersaults hell undertake on solid ground  
Having been some days in preparation  
A splendid time is guaranteed for all  
And tonight Mr Kite is topping the bill
