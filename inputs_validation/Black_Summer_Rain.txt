Where is the sun  
The sun that used to shine on me  
Where has it gone  
Or is it just a memory  
  
I looked through the window  
Staring at the sky  
Waiting for a moment  
That always passed me by  
  
Chorus  
Black summer rain  
Black summer rain  
Black summer rain is falling on me girl  
  
Where is the love  
The love I need to set me free  
And how can I escape  
This gloom that is swallowing me  
  
Chorus x2
