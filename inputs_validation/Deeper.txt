Yeah so it all comes down to this what  
Specialist with a hit list  
Right fist bomb type MGM fight night type ding ding  
So when I hits in the stage we can Face Off  
Watch me rattle your Nicholas Cage  
Bring heat in ridiculous ways never compromise  
Look into my eyes tell me what you see what  
Victory ecstasy maybe Hennessy  
Energy wasted enemies gettin laced with  
That point blank to the face shit  
Who you think this is  
Young black bust a nigga ass strictly business man  
Self disciple Heineken let the record spin  
Paparazzi all over again times ten  
Like thee original sin  
Im tryin to fuck it up for everybody  
The hot  get collect calls from John Gotti  
I kick back like karate  
Butter soft burn off and solid black Mazaratti like  
  
Get caught up in the game it gets deeper then that  
No gain with no pain it gets deeper then that  
Dyin in the fast lane way deeper then that  
To the place where the motherfuckin problem is at  
  
Long hair ganja smoke but dont be mistaken  
I aint Jamacian  
Find another chick to jerk  
A world of hurt 9 to 5 puttin in work  
Never rest put to the test get put to the death  
Never the less only greater than  
Trust no man  
Soon to have the whole wide world inside of my hand  
So I suggest you act right my insight like sunlight  
Burn your cornea  
Big bad California  
To the Waldord Historia cmon  
NYC competition wish to some day roll like me  
But all I see is capital HEAT  
Im makin motherfuckers Run like DMC run  
The Likwit MC is here to blaze a nigga like a fat one  
Non radio bangin shit goin platinum  
And keep slappin em with a Colt 45  
While my Old English leave you broken down with a Crooked Ise eye  
  
Get caught up in the game it gets deeper then that  
No gain with no pain it gets deeper then that  
Dyin in the fast lane way deeper then that  
To the place where the motherfuckin problem is at  
  
Suck it easy Movin On Up like George and Weezy  
You cant stop it love it or leave it alone  
Xzibit writtin more pages then the state penetentary  
Full of well known villians that want to come home  
Never relax aint no tellin lay it on wax  
Make it bang let Stever sell em and dip em in chrome  
My nigga Budda chip off beats like cellular phones  
Heir to the thrown  
Xzibit bring the lead to your dome  
Like a 3rd world rebellion squad on your boulevard  
Protect they spots with heat  
They kids ggotta eat to make it big in Cali it depends on who you meet  
And who you sleep with  
Might find yourself in deep shit  
So hit me with your best shot  
Im lookin forward to it  
You shouldnt repeat it if you aint really goin through it  
How dare you try to check the fluid  
Rip the track chillin on your big plans like Wilsure and Farefax  
  
Get caught up in the game it gets deeper then that  
No gain with no pain it gets deeper then that  
Dyin in the fast lane way deeper then that  
To the place where the motherfuckin problem is at
