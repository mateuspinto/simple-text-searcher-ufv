A long time ago from the valley of the sun  
Came the holy power  
When the gods were one  
Searching for a new home  
Searching for this land  
Guided by the stars and a vision they had seen  
The pillars of the temple  
In these hills of green  
Buried deep inside for only us to find  
chorus  
It is the roar of the wind  
The power of the sun  
The strength of a thousand bows  
And those who near it again will fear it again  
And its here in the heart of the rose  
Painted in the sky was the moment to awake  
All that lay within you  
As this dawn should break  
With this force awoken none can stand before  
This is the hour now is the time  
Driven by the purest love I give you mine  
All that we must be is everything we see  
  
chorus  
Our love has brought us both together  
And its our love that will go on forever  
There is no love that can become as one  
Before its time  
  
chorus  
It is the trees in the earth  
It is the rivers that run  
And through us this secret flows  
And now our destiny calls  
Youll remember it all  
Our love for the heart of the rose
