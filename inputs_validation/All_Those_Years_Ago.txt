Im shouting all about love  
While they treated you like a dog  
When you were the one who had made it so clear  
All those years ago  
  
Im talking all about how to give  
They dont act with much honesty  
But you point the way to the truth when you say  
All you need is love  
  
Chorus  
Living with good and bad  
I always looked up to you  
Now were left cold and sad  
By someone the devils best friend  
Someone who offended all  
  
Were living in a bad dream  
Theyve forgotten all about mankind  
And you were the one they backed up to the wall  
All those years ago  
You were the one who imagined it all  
All those years ago  
  
All those years ago  
All those years ago  
  
Deep in the darkest night  
I send out a prayer to you  
Now in the world of light  
Where the spirit free of lies  
And all else that we despised  
  
Theyve forgotten all about God  
Hes the only reason we exist  
Yet you were the one that they said was so weird  
All those years ago  
You said it all though not many had ears  
All those years ago  
You had control of our smiles and our tears  
All those years ago  
  
All those years ago  
All those years ago
