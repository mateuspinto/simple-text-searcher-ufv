I do swear that Ill always be there Id give anything and everything  
and I will always care Through weakness and strength happiness and  
sorrow for better or worse I will love you with every beat of my  
heart

From this moment on  
  
From this moment I have been blessed  
I live only for your happiness  
And for your love Id give my last breath  
From this moment on

My dreams came true because of you  
  
From this moment as long as I live  
I will love you I promise you this  
There is nothing I wouldnt give  
From this moment on  
  
Youre the reason I believe in love  
And youre the answer to my prayers from up above  
All we need is just the two of us  
My dreams came true because of you  
  
From this moment as long as I live

There is nothing I wouldnt give  
From this moment  
I will love you  
I will love you as long as I live  
From this moment on
