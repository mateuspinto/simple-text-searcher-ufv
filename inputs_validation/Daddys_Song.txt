Years ago I knew a man  
He was my mothers biggest fan  
We used to walk beside the sea  
And hed tell how my life would be  
When I grew up to be a man  
Years ago we used to play  
He used to laugh when I ran away  
But when I fell and hurt my knee  
He used to come and comfort me  
And the pain would go away  
  
Years ago I knew a boy  
He was his daddys pride and joy  
But when the daddy went away  
It was such a rainy day  
That he brought out all his toys  
Now the momma did explain  
Trying to take away the pain  
He just couldnt understand  
That his father was not a man  
And it all was just a game  
  
Years have passed and so have I  
Making it hard to cry  
And if and when I have a son  
Let it all be said and done  
Let all that sadness pass him by
