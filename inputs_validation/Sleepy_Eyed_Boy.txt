Where are the boot straps  
To lift myself up  
Where is the well  
Where I once filled my cup  
Where does this sorrow  
All turn into joy  
And where oh where is the sleepy eyed boy  
  
Where is my true love  
When the wind starts to moan  
Is she out in the wild  
Is she there all alone  
Have I cast her aside  
Like an unwanted toy  
Tell me where oh where is the sleepy eyed boy  
  
Hes goin down the backroads  
In a cold pourin rain  
Hes a waitin for a postcard  
In the south coast of Spain  
Postmarked from a sweetheart  
Back in ol Illinois  
Sayin where oh where is my sleepy eyed boy
