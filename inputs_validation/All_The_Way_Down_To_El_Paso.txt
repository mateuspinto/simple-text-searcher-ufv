You know it it is only true  
That you could be the best of you  
How I wonder miles away  
Tying horshoes by the bay  
  
As we know maybe faster  
All the way down to El Paso  
  
Many say and lucky do  
My own fire once said it too  
Leave the ocean live and play  
Door on sockets yesterday  
  
As we know maybe faster  
All the way down to El Paso  
  
Is it fair or nestled sorrow  
You could be there tomorrow  
  
As we know maybe faster  
All the way down to El Paso  
  
Whooo  
  
Whooo  
  
As we know maybe faster  
All the way down to El Paso
