Will their children cry  
When their mother dies  
And in the autumn of their lives  
Will they feel the same  
  
reversed lyrics 203222  
  
The longing for me  
Comin down like hail  
Why did you leave me  
  
Come here inside  
And tell me how  
How in my final days  
You found around  
  
Your concern  
The signal for us to end our lives  
To wipe beneath the watches  
And you wait forever  
  
The night comes high  
Your weakness  
Storing trace on your eyes  
So I left you alone  
We all left you alone

Lock the children away from harm  
Theyll lock all your reason why  
Seeking  with a dagger  
Skin is blocked by the years of trial  
  
You felt abandoned in the fog of flesh  
Sitting in place from the dead  
Awaiting the face of the moon to ascend  
You follow the siren in your head  
  
In your head
