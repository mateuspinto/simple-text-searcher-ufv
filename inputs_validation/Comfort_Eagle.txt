We are building a religion  
We are building it bigger  
We are widening the corridors  
And adding more lanes  
  
We are building a religion  
A limited edition  
We are now accepting callers  
For these pendant key chains  
  
To resist it is useless  
It is useless to resist it  
His cigarette is burning  
But he never seems to ash  
  
He is grooming his poodle  
He is living comfort eagle  
You can meet at his location  
But youd better come with cash  
  
Now his hat is on backwards  
He can show you his tattoos  
He is in the music business  
He is calling you DUDE  
  
Now today is tomorrow  
And tomorrow today  
And yesterday is weaving in and out  
  
And the fluffy white lines  
That the airplane leaves behind  
Are drifting right in front  
Of the waning of the moon  
  
He is handling the money  
He is serving the food  
He knows about your party  
He is calling you DUDE  
  
Now do you believe  
In the one big sign  
The double wide shine  
On the boot heels of your prime  
  
Doesnt matter if youre skinny  
Doesnt matter if youre fat  
You can dress up like a sultan  
In your onion head hat  
  
We are building a religion  
We are making a brand  
Were the only ones to turn to  
When your castles turn to sand  
  
Take a bite of this apple  
Mr corporate events  
Take a walk through the jungle  
Of cardboard shanties and tents  
  
Some people drink Pepsi  
Some people drink Coke  
The wacky morning DJ  
Says democracys a joke  
  
He says now do you believe  
In the one big song  
Hes now accepting callers  
Who would like to sing along  
  
He says do you believe  
In the one true edge  
By fastening your safety belts  
And stepping towards the ledge  
  
He is handling the money  
He is serving the food  
He is now accepting callers  
He is calling me DUDE  
  
He says now do you believe  
In the one big sign  
The double wide shine  
On the boot heels of your prime  
  
Theres no need to ask directions  
If you ever lose your mind  
Were behind you  
Were behind you  
And let us please remind you  
We can send a car to find you  
If you ever lose your way  
  
We are building a religion  
  
We are building it bigger  
  
We are building  
  
A religion  
  
A limited  
  
Edition  
  
We are now accepting callers  
For these beautiful  
Pendant key chains
