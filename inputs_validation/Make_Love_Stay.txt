Now that we love  
Now that the lonely nights are over  
How do we make love stay  
Now that we know  
The fire can burn bright or merely smolder  
How do we keep it from dying away  
  
Elusive as dreams  
Barely remembered in the morning  
Love like a phantom flies  
But held in the heart  
It pales like the emply smile adorning  
A statue with sightless eyes  
  
Moments fleet taste sweet within the rapture  
When precious flesh is greedily consumed  
But mysterys a thing not easily captured  
And once deceased not easily exhumed  
  
Now that we love  
Now that the lonely nights are over  
How do we make love stay  
  
Now that we loved  
Look at the moonless night and tell me  
How do we make love stay
