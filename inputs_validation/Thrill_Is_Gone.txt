Verse 1 Drake  
Look  
In This World Of Desperate Housewives And Freakin Players  
Rappers They Tend To Be Smilin  
Because They Swimmin In Women  
Most Of Em Sick Of Favors  
They Come In Secret Flavors  
Thats Why I Envy Omar  
Because So Far Im Nowhere Close To Malik and Deja  
  
And thats Some Higher Learning  
Trying Ta Excel With The Brake On  
Ill Have You Stuck In The Same Spot  
With The Tires Burnin  
And Im A Liar Turnin 19 Jaded With No Faith  
In Any Female thats Askin What I Was Earnin  
I Met This Recent Lady  
She Knew A Piece Of Sadey By Spinners  
I Guess In My Southern Eyes That She Decent Maybe  
Well Second Thought If We Have It Then She Can Keep The Baby  
Cuz She Aint Give Me The Butterflies That Aleshia Gave Me  
Its Like Im Using Some Bread To Sop Up Some Decent Gravy  
Now Im Out Of Both And Ive Been Thinkin Of Aleshia Lately  
Im All Alone I Got A Feelin its On  
Cuz Nowadays Most Of The Thrill Of Chillin Is Gone And Uh  
  
Chorus  
Loves Lost  
Loves Gone  
Love Lost  
Love Is Gone  
  
Verse 2 Drake  
Some Dudes They Turn Purple With Hurt Faces  
Circling Workplaces  
And Following Girls On The Assumptions Of What The Worst Case Is  
They Get To First Bases  
Then They Get To Retreating Cuz If She Cheatin  
Theye Wanna Know What The First Trace Is  
Now You Like Macgyver  
Cuz You Sneakin Around  
And She dont Know That You There When You Standin Right Beside Her  
I cant Relate To That  
I Had To Take It Back A Couple A Years  
When Some Of The Best Kicked It With Drake In Fact  
  
I Bet That They Knew It Cuz In My Mind I Play Through It  
With Yoshi Lee And A Lewis And A Couple Things That They True In  
And In The End I Listen But I dont See Me As They Do  
Cuz its My Opinion My Life My Potentials For My Wife  
And I Used To Be Eager To Buy Em The World  
Maybe Im Confused About What I Desire From Girls  
Either Way Im All Alone Got A Feelin its On  
Cuz Nowadays Most Of The Thrill Of Just Chillin Is Gone And Uh  
  
Chorus  
Loves Lost  
Loves Gone  
Love Lost  
Love Is Gone  
  
Verse 3 Drake  
Check  
And Nowadays Some Girls Are The Type Of Person That  
Will Tell They Friends That They Use Him Which Is Confusin  
Since I Aint Made Them A Purchase Yet  
But theres Logic Behind It  
Emotions Double And They Try To Cover Up  
Like A Mansion With The Projects Behind It  
I Tend To Freak With This  
I Get A Girl And Pretend That I Love The Spendin  
And All She Gave Was A Decent Kiss  
Thinkin She Been Spoiled  
But Golddiggin Is Nothing When You Can Shovel For Days  
And Come Up With Tin Foil  
  
We Could Dissect It See  
You Take A Dominique Or Another Freak In The Sheets  
And You Picture That She Just Slept With Me For Nothing  
Gave Her Nothing  
Her Reputations In Jeopardy  
Cuz It Aint Take Her 3 Of That Shopping To Get Her Next To Me  
Collectively I Look For A Proper Chick Thatll Rep For Me  
Instead Of Seeing Something She Wants And Callin And Textin Me  
For Thinkin That Exists I Got A Feeling Im Wrong  
Nowadays Most Of The Thrill Of Just Chillin Is Gone And Uh  
  
Chorus  
Loves Lost  
Loves Gone  
Love Lost  
Love Is Gone
