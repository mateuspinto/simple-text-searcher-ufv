Mr Sandman showing his beam  
When he walks into the room  
The walls lean in to listen  
Surf out brain waves  
Click back and forth like old headlights  
Sniffing model glue again  
  
Head like a steel trap  
Wish I didnt I didnt I didnt I didnt  
I didnt I didnt I didnt I dont  
Just want to be a footnote in someone elses happiness  
  
Does your husband know the way that  
The sunshine gleams from your wedding band  
Does he know the way to worship I know  
Of the crickets that would convince me to call it a night  
  
I will never end up like him  
Behind my back I already am  
Keep a calendar this way  
You will always know  
  
The last time you came through  
Oh darling I know what youre going through  
The last time you came through  
Oh darling oh darling oh darling  
  
Tempest in a teacup  
Get unique  
Peroxide Princess shine like shark teeth  
Its a sign its a sign  
Its a sign its a sign  
Its a sign what if you peaked early  
  
Does your husband know the way that  
The sunshine gleams from your wedding band  
Does he know the way does he know the way  
Of the crickets that would convince me to call it a night  
  
Does he does he know the way to worship our love  
Does your husband know the way  
That the sunshine gleams from your wedding band  
  
But I will never end up like him  
Behind my back I already am  
Keep a calendar this way you will always know  
  
The last time you came through  
Oh darling I know what youre going through  
The last time you came through  
Oh darling oh darling oh darling  
  
Does your husband know  
Does your husband know  
Does your husband know  
  
Does he know  
Does he know  
Does he know  
  
But I will never end up like him  
Behind my back I already am  
Keep a calendar this way you will always know  
  
Oh the last time you came through  
Oh darling I know what youre going through  
Oh the last time you came through  
Oh darling I know what youre going through
