At first I thought it was the moonlight shining through the mist  
Cause after all a kiss is just a kiss or so I thought  
But I must have been wrong  
It could have been the music cause it sounded so sweet  
Something sure was sweeping me off of my feet  
All night long it sure was strong  
Before I knew what was going on I was going going gone  
I suppose it could have the perfume from a honeysuckle vine  
Something sure was driving me out of my mind  
But I should have known all along  
It was your love and it was so strong  
I was going going gone  
It might have been the magic written in the stars  
Some gypsy might have read it somewhere in the cards  
It really doesnt matter cause whatever it was  
It led me straight to your arms  
First I thought it was the moonlight shining through the mist  
After all a kiss is just a kiss or so I thought so I thought  
But I must have been wrong  
Before I knew what was going on  
I was going going gone  
Going going gone  
Going going gone
