Theres a girl  
From back roads Tennessee  
And she works in the factory  
All day on the line  
Then she clocks at five finally  
And theres a bar  
The boys treat her like a queen  
Shes the bell of the ball in blue jeans  
And they all get a turn  
Just to turn her around the floor  
And they always want more  
  
She says take me for one more song  
Mr Whoever You Are  
Spin me around and pull me in close  
And the band slows down  
Then lets get the hell out of this bar  
Mr Whoever You Are  
Mr Whoever You Are  
  
They dance  
Melt to the heat of the song  
Their bodies feel like they belong  
And the boys hold on tight  
Thinking I might get lucky tonight  
And theyre probably right  
Yeah theyre probably right  
  
She says take me for one more song  
Mr Whoever You Are  
Spin me around and pull me in close  
And the band slows down  
Then lets get the hell out of this bar  
Mr Whoever You Are  
Mr Whoever You Are  
  
They hold onto her waist  
She falls into the night  
And she throws back her head  
She looks up toward the sky  
And she laughs  
At all the pretty lights  
  
And says take me for one more song  
Mr Whoever You Are  
Spin me around and pull me in close  
And the band slows down  
Lets get the hell out of this bar  
Mr Whoever You Are  
Mr Whoever You Are  
  
Aw Mr Whoever You Are  
Mr Whoever You Are
