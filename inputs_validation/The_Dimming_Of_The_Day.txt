This old house is falling down around my ears  
Im drowning in a river of my tears  
When all my will is gone you hold me sway  
I need you at the dimming of the day  
  
You pull me like the moon pulls on the tide  
You know just where I keep my better side  
  
What days have come to keep us far apart  
A broken promise or a broken heart  
Now all the bonnie birds have wheeled away  
I need you at the dimming of the day  
  
Come the night youre only what I want  
Come the night you could be my confident  
  
I see you on the street in company  
Why dont you come and ease your mind with me  
Im living for the night we steal away  
I need you at the dimming of the day  
Oh I need you at the dimming of the day
