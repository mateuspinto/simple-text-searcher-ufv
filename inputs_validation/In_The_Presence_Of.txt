Deeper than every ocean  
Deeper than every river  
Thats what your presence brings to me  
  
Revealing the words I listen  
Seeing you in my silence  
Learning Im with you constantly  
As I was before  
  
If we were flowers  
We would worship the sun  
So why not now  
This high is shining brightly  
Brighter than before  
  
As the door was open wide  
There inside was a diamond chair  
Where I sat when I was young  
I wrote down the words  
  
Only when the young at heart  
Can enter the real world  
This chance Ive waited for  
For you to see  
  
If I had chances I would spend them with you  
To hold you close and let your love surround me  
Deeper than before  
  
Deeper than every ocean  
And I know this love is real  
Deeper than every river  
Realize this is meant to be  
Thats what your eyes they say to me  
You are listening to how I feel  
So expectedly  
Brighter than every morning  
From the ocean to the sky  
Beautiful as the sunset  
Every river to the sea  
Nature surrounds me constantly  
We can hear love constantly  
This is for you and me  
  
Turn around and come deeper now  
So what happens when I touch you there  
You feel the words roll over you  
Thinking of the better scenes  
The memories  
As everybody else just  
Hasnt got the time  
To help you anymore  
  
Cause if the reason for  
The things that pleasure us  
To please ourselves  
Not pressure us  
To give our ego  
Some pleasure time  
  
Can you imagine  
Any reason  
To know youre only fooling yourself  
And then youll understand why  
Youll understand why  
  
So if we choose to realize  
All existence is a dream  
This perfect resume to you  
From me  
  
Just had a tough time with magic  
The death of ego  
The moon  
It was just coming through  
  
Send me such a good time  
In a letter form tell me  
The pleasure no pressure  
Pure imagination in a metaphoric dream  
  
I get amazed like a true beginner  
I get amazed like a true believer  
I get amazed when I see you there  
And I come alive  
  
I believe Im a true beginner  
I believe Im a true beginner  
In your arms I can see it all  
I can see it all  
  
If we were flowers  
We would worship the sun  
So why not now  
This light is burning brightly  
This light is burning brightly  
Brighter than before  
Brighter than before  
Brighter than before  
Brighter than before  
  
Turn around and remember that  
When it gets so low  
As you finally hit the ground  
  
Turn around and remember that  
Now Im standing tall  
Standing on my sacred ground  
  
Turn around and remember that  
When it gets so low  
As you finally hit the ground  
  
Turn around and remember that  
Now youre standing tall  
Standing on sacred ground  
Standing on sacred ground  
Standing on sacred ground
