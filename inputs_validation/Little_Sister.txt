Hey sister are you all alone  
Im standing out your window  
Hey little sister can I come inside you  
I want to show you all my love  
I want to be the only one  
I know you like nobody ever baby  
  
Little sister cant you find another way  
No more living life behind a shadow  
  
You whisper secrets in my ear  
Slowly dancing cheek to cheek  
Such a sweet thing when you open up baby  
They say Ill only do you wrong  
Come together cause I understand  
Just who you really are yeah baby  
  
Little sister cant you find another way  
No more living life behind a shadow
