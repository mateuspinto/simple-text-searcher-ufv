I was standing by the ocean when I saw your face  
I couldnt look at you  
I guess you knew it but I never realized  
That we were through  
  
And now Im down here all alone  
With every feeling that I own  
You cant take that away  
  
And with every breath we take  
And the illusions we create  
Will come to you someday  
  
And I was touched  
By the hand of God  
Never knew it  
But of course I was  
  
I never hoped to do the things in this world  
I wanted to  
Because everything I own  
It belongs to you  
  
I never looked at you in a sexual way  
In my life before  
And Ive never woken up like this  
So desperately before  
  
And I was touched  
By the hand of God  
Never knew it  
But of course I was
