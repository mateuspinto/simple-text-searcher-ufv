Jerry got ready with her boots and furs  
Put a wig on her head and stumbled down the stairs  
Fell into the back of a limousine  
Nobody would have I guessed she was a beauty queen  
Out of reach out of touch out of time  
Out of luck out of loves out of her mind  
Madame George got played today  
She almost forgot she could feel that way  
Information coming from north and south  
She could barely get the words out of her mouth  
Out of reach out of touch out of time  
Out of luck out of love out of her mind  
Play the plastic guitar  
Now Jerrys on the verge of a major breakthrough  
Shes gonna stop lying gonna tell the truth  
She made it with a major in the Lincoln Hotel  
And nobody knows why she gets treated so well  
Out of reach out of touch out of lime  
Out of luck out of love out of her mind
