It was bout 15 years ago  
Just about this time  
The child we both were waiting for  
Soon opened his eyes  
First the cough and then the pain  
Showed within your face  
I felt the cold mist round your hand  
Like death was in its place  
  
Lord Lord take my hand  
Take me down to the promised land  
Ever since you died my heart has died  
Ill be with you in the sunshine sand  
  
I called the doctor to your side  
He knelt down by your bed  
He looked at you he held your hand  
Then he shook his head  
The child you want wont give the love  
You both want to get  
As your wife come quickly now  
Cos she has not long to live  
He said  
  
Lord Lord take my hand  
Take me down to the promised land  
Ever since you died my heart has died  
Ill be with you in the sunshine sand  
  
Every day I go to kiss the ground in which you lay  
Your golden hair has turned to dust  
Your smile has turned to clay  
The pain I felt for 15 years  
This life wont take a win  
And I will lie within your arms  
By the evening of this day  
  
Lord Lord take my hand  
Take me down to the promised land  
Ever since you died my heart has died  
Ill be with you in the sunshine sand
