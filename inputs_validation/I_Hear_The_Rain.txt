  
  
  
I hear the rain I hear the rain  
  
I hear the rain  
  
Got to kill the pain  
  
I hear the rain I hear the rain  
  
I hear the rain  
  
Got to kill the pain  
  
  
Burry me out on a lone prarie  
  
Prarie water washin over me  
  
Burry me out on a lone prarie  
  
A friend who calls a coyote  
  
  
Burry me out in the lone city  
  
Sewer water color of my tea  
  
Burry me out in the lone city  
  
Sewer water wash we all down to sea  
  
  
  
She use to sit and watch and wait  
  
Now I think Ill go and sit
