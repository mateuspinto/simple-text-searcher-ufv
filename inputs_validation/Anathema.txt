You will never know whats behind my skull  
So wont you say goodnight so I can say goodbye  
  
You will never know whats under my hair  
So wont you say goodnight so I can say goodbye  
  
You will never know whats under my skin  
So wont you say goodnight so I can say goodbye  
  
You will never know what is in my veins  
So wont you say goodnight so I can say goodbye  
  
Wont you go to someone elses dreams  
Wont you go to someone elses head  
Havent you taken enough from me  
Wont you torture someone elses sleep  
  
And you will never know what Im thinking of  
So wont you say goodnight so I can say goodbye  
  
And you will never understand what I believe  
So wont you say goodnight so I can say goodbye  
  
Havent you taken enough from me  
Wont you torture someone elses sleep  
Wont you go to someone elses dreams  
Wont you go to someone elses head  
Havent you taken enough from me  
Wont you torture someone elses sleep  
  
I start to part two halves of my heart in the dark and I  
Dont know where I should go  
And the tears and the fears begin to multiply  
  
Taking time in a simple place  
In my bed where my head rests on a pillowcase  
And its said that a wars lead but I forget  
That I let another day go by  
  
I want to be afraid but it seems that these days  
Im caught under water and Im falling farther  
My hearts getting harder Im calling my Father  
Am I screaming to an empty sky  
  
Empty sky no way thats me cause one half of my heart is free  
Empty sky no way thats me cause the other half of my hearts asleep
