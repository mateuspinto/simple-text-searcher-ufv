By Bill Chadwick and John Chadwick  
The king of Zor he called for war  
And the king of Zam he answered  
They fashioned their weapons one upon one  
Ton upon ton they called for war at the rise of the sun  
  
Out went the call to one and to all  
That echoed and rolled like the thunder  
Trumpets and drums roar upon roar  
More upon more  
Rolling the call of Come now to war  
  
Throughout the night they fashioned their might  
With right on the side of the mighty  
They puzzled their minds plan upon plan  
Man upon man  
And at dying of dawn the great war began  
  
They met on the battlefield banner in hand  
They looked out across the vacant land  
And they counted the missing one upon one  
None upon none  
The war it was over before it begun  
  
Two little kings playing a game  
They gave a war and nobody came  
And nobody came  
And nobody came  
And nobody came  
And nobody came
