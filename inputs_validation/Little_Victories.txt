When your baby up and leaves you  
Up and leaves you flat  
Dont you laugh my friend sometimes it happens just like that  
First you feel the anger then the sorrow will soon take control  
And therell be hard times for sure  
Long cold lonely nights  
  
It might not sound like much  
But itll mean a lot youll see  
Every hour you survive will come to be  
A little victory  
Little victory  
  
As you struggle through each day  
Each strange new day  
Feelin lost and wounded tryin hard to find your way  
No one there to talk it out with  
Learnin how to sleep alone  
Overcomin each new doubt  
Tryin hard just to accept it all  
  
Everytime you keep control when youre cut off at the knees  
Everytime you take a punch and still stand at ease  
Little victories  
Little victories  
  
And when night falls and theres no one around  
The cruelest time of all and not one sound  
Listenin to the wind blow  
Listenin to the tickin of the clock  
Tryin hard to forget  
Tryin hard to just accept it all  
  
As you step out in the night take a lesson from the trees  
Watch the way they learn to bend with each breeze  
Little victories  
Everytime you make it through  
Its another little victory  
Day by day minute by minute  
Little victories
