The moon was yellow and the night was young  
A smile brought us together a  
And I was wondring whether  
Wed meet again some day  
  
The moon was yellow and a song was sung  
That vocal inspiration gave me the inclination  
To give my heart away  
  
Her we are is our romance to continue  
Will it be my luck to win you  
May I look that far  
  
Ah My love is mellow and my hopes are strung  
Around that cupid fellow  
Behold The moon is yellow  
And the night is young
