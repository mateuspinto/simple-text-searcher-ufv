The satellites trackin Santa  
We text our Christmas list  
And leave our mobile numbers  
To help out ole Saint Nick  
Sometimes we stop and wonder  
Has that ole bubble burst  
Or will this Christmas morning be like the first  
But tonight we still thank Bethlehem  
And bless the Lord for love again  
Bring peace on earth goodwill to men  
Its the future not the past  
  
Lets have a  
First night  
Star bright  
Child of light  
So right  
21st century Christmas  
Magic morn  
Tree adorn  
Child is born  
Safe and warm  
21st century Christmas  
  
Well microwave some popcorn  
Put on a dvd  
Fax Tiny Tim a thank you  
For blessing you and me  
Sometimes we watch and wonder  
Has Christmas lost its touch  
Can a world beyond the money  
Be worth that much  
  
And tonight as we thank Bethlehem  
And bless the Lord for love again  
Bring peace on earth goodwill to men  
The future is the past  
  
Well have a  
First night  
Star bright  
Child of light  
So right  
21st century Christmas  
We got a  
Magic morn  
Tree adorn  
Child is born  
Safe and warm  
21st century Christmas
