I loved that song  
I saw a little story in the newspaper about the size of a pack of cigarettes 
it said  
Pinto the Wonder Horse is Dead  
But I was reading the newspaper and I was looking for part two of the story  
I had already started   
so I never read the story I just saw the headline and kept going  
A week later I said My God wheres that newspaper I started askin people
 I figured he was the horse that belonged to some cowboy movie star but
nobody had a horse named Pinto So I just made him up made him into a
childhood hero  
I read it in the paper just about a week ago  
It was on the back page and not many people know  
Boy it made me feel bad when I picked it up and read Pinto the wonder horse is
dead  
Oh we rode the dusty trails together at the Saturday morning picture show  
The dusty trailsre gone now but it hurts to hear it said  
Pinto the wonder horse is dead  
My memory goes back to when I was a little kid  
We believed in everything that Pinto ever did  
Will our kids have a hero half as brave or half as strong  
Pinto the wonder horse is gone  
Oh we rode the dusty trails together  
We believed that Pinto was the fastest horse alive  
If he outrun the wind itself we never were surprised  
In my childhood memory full of boys grow into men Pinto the wonder rides again  
Oh we rode the dusty trails together  
Pinto the wonder horse is gone
