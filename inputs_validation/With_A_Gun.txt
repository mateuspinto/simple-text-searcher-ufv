I could be wrong but I have seen your face before  
You were the man that I saw running from his door  
You owed him money but you gave him something more  
With a gun  
With a gun  
  
You will be what you are just the same  
Did you pay the other man with the piece in your hand  
And leave him lying in the rain  
  
You were the founders of the clinic on the hill  
Until he caught you with your fingers in the till  
He slapped your hand so you settled up your bill  
  
With a gun  
With a gun  
You will be what you are just the same  
Did you pay the other man with the piece in your hand  
And leave him lying in the rain  
  
When youre born to play the fool  
And youve seen all the western movies  
Woe to the one who does you wrong  
You hide in the bushes  
Murder the man  
With Luger in hand  
  
I understood that you will soon be leavin town  
Dont try to call me when they finally run you down  
Just give fair warning any time you come around  
  
With a gun  
With a gun  
You will be what you are just the same  
Did you pay the other man with the piece in your hand  
And leave him lying in the rain
