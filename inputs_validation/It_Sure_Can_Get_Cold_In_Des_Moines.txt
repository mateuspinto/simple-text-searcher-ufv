The Iowa weather was 13 below  
I had come to Des Moines for a radio show  
I awoke in the evening from a travelers sleep  
With notions of something to eat  
  
The old elevator slid down past the floors  
My head and my eyes said You should have slept more  
The man at the desk said the restaurant was closed  
Outside it was 14 below  
  
The lounge was still open and so I walked in  
In place of my food I had two double gins  
I looked round the room as a tourist would do  
Thats when I saw the girl in the booth  
  
She sat there and cried in the smoky halfdark  
The silent type crying that tears out your heart  
Her clothes were not cut in the new modern way  
And her suitcase had seen better days  
  
Nobody asked her what caused her such pain  
Nobody spoke up yet no one complained  
Without even asking I knew why she cried  
Life is just like that sometimes  
  
The man at the desk said Its 15 below  
The bellhop said Yeah man thats coldthats cold  
I went back to my room and I wrote down this song  
Oh it sure can get cold in Des Moines
