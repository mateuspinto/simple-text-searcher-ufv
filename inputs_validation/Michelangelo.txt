Last night I dreamed about you  
I dreamed that you were older  
You were looking like Picasso  
With a scar across your shoulder  
You were kneeling by the river  
You were digging up the bodies  
Buried long ago  
Michelangelo  
  
Last night I dreamed about you  
I dreamed you were a pilgrim  
On a highway out alone to find  
The mother of your children  
Who were still unborn and waiting  
In the wings of some desire  
Abandoned long ago  
Michelangelo  
  
Were you there at Armageddon  
Was Paris really burning  
Could I have been the one to pull you  
From the point of no returning  
And did I hear you calling out my name  
Or was it forgotten long ago  
Michelangelo  
  
Last night I dreamed about you  
I dreamed that you were riding  
On a blood red painted pony  
Up where the heavens were dividing  
And the angels turned to ashes  
You came tumbling with them to earth  
So Far below  
Michelangelo  
  
Last night I dreamed about you  
I dreamed that you were dying  
In a field of thorn and roses  
With a hawk about you crying  
For the warrior slain in battle  
From an arrow driven deep inside you  
Long ago  
Michelangelo  
  
Did you suffer at the end  
Would there be no one to remember  
Did you banish all the old ghosts  
With the terms of surrender  
And could you hear me calling out your name  
Well I guess that I will never know  
Michelangelo  
  
Last night I dreamed about you  
I dreamed that you were weeping  
And your tears poured down like diamonds  
For a love beyond all keeping  
And you caught them one by one  
In a million silk bandannas that I gave you long ago  
Michelangelo
