Ill steal your life and cut out your heart  
Rip the core of your world apart  
Then Ill take your sight  
Leave ya blind  
Laughing hard as you loose your mind  
Smash in your skull  
Kick out your brains  
Dance all over  
What remains  
  
Life The living danger  
Death The welcome stranger  
In sin You deny the cross  
  
Deny the cross  
  
Im an angel Im virgin white  
This only happens every night  
Restitution for my sin  
Imprisoned virtue time begins  
Killer instincts  
Escape my find  
Path of destruction  
Left behind  
  
Life it walks away  
It walks today  
It fades away  
Death is here to stay  
Is here today  
To deny the cross  
  
Draw and quarter slice the meat  
Now theres something more to eat  
Nothing left there is just a frame  
This poor soul has no name  
Back to dirt  
Six feet deep  
I take a breath  
Long and deep  
  
Deny the cross
