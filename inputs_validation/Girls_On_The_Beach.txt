Ah ah ah ah oo ooo ooo oo ahh  
The girls on the beach  
  
On the beach youll find them there  
In the sun and salty air  
The girls on the beach  
Are all within reach  
If you know what to do  
  
How we love to lie around  
Girls with tans of golden brown  
The girls on the beach  
Are all within reach  
And one waits there for you  
Girls on the beach  
  
The sun in her hair  
The warmth of the air  
On a summer day  
  
As the sun dips out of sight  
Couples on the beach at night  
The girls on the beach  
Are all within reach  
And with the boys tonight  
Girls on the beach  
  
Girls on the beach girls on the beach  
Girls on the beach girls on the beach
