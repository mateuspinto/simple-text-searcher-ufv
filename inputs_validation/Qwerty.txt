I didnt think that I had a debt to pay  
Till they came to take what I had left away  
You said you wouldnt put me to the test today  
But I remember you saying that yesterday  
  
There was a time when your mind wasnt out of control  
Every memory and confession born out of your soul  
Like a pill you couldnt swallow so it swallowed you whole  
Another lie hard to follow it followed you home  
  
And like that  
Broken down  
A victim of your plight  
  
Fire so out of control  
Every memory and confession born out of your soul  
  
And like that  
Broken down  
A victim of you lies  
  
You hide behind  
Lies  
You dont know  
Why  
You crossed the line  
Wrapped up inside your  
Lies  
You hide behind  
Lies  
Youre lost inside that cold disguise  
Behind your lies  
  
I dont know what I thought I might say  
Seems like we never would talk the right way  
Every other minute I fought for my place  
And drop what I made thought you might say so  
  
Im guessing that you probably know  
When your insides hollow and you want to be cold  
Like a pill hard to swallow so it swallowed you whole  
Another lie hard to follow it followed you home  
  
And like that  
Broken down  
A victim of your lies  
  
You hide behind  
Lies  
You dont know  
Why  
You crossed the line  
Wrapped inside your lies  
You hide behind  
Lies  
Youre lost inside that cold disguise  
Behind your lies  
  
Youre faking youre mistaken  
If you think that you could climb out of this hole  
Forsaken what would take me  
Analyzing by the power of your soul  
  
Broken down a victim of your  
Faking your mistaken  
If you think that you could climb out of this hole  
Broken down a victim of your lies  
  
You hide behind  
Lies  
You dont know  
Why  
You hide behind  
Lies  
You dont know  
Why  
You hide behind  
Lies  
You dont know  
Why  
You hide behind  
Wrapped up inside your lies  
  
You hide behind  
Lies  
You dont know  
Why  
You crossed the line  
Wrapped up inside your  
Lies  
You hide behind  
Lies  
Youre lost inside that cold disguise  
Behind your lies
