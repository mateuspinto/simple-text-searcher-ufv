Thought you were one who wouldnt run  
Who wouldnt do me wrong  
But the song that you were singing  
Was the same old heartache song  
You treat me fine and you wined and dined  
And I believed you when you said  
I love you babe but your only aim  
Was to get me in your bed  
Now I dont even like you no more  
But I cant get you off of my mind  
Baby youve got me livin in  
Heartache central time  
Heartache central  
Heartache central  
Heartache central time  
  
Anytime is a hurting time  
With a hurting heart like mine  
God knows Id get over you  
If only I could find  
A way to get my hurtin heart  
Off heartache central time  
  
Remember last september  
When you looked into my eyes  
I should have known that the love youd shown  
Was nothing more than lies  
I fell for you and I know its true  
That I should have stopped myself  
But my lonely heart was too alone  
To hurt all by itself  
Now I dont even like you no more  
But I cant get you off of my mind  
Baby youve got me livin in  
Heartache central time  
Heartache central  
Heartache central  
Heartache central time  
  
Anytime is a hurting time  
With a hurting heart like mine  
God knows Id get over you  
If only I could find  
A way to get this hurtin heart  
Off heartache central time
