I hear the sound in a metal way  
I feel the power rolling on the stage  
Cause only one thing really sets me free  
Heavy metal loud as it can be  
  
Baby I was born to play music  
I am a man with a screaming guitar  
Theres a light in a middle of the stage  
And in a minute Ill be wearing it all  
I dont know another way of living  
Man I couldnt really care  
Give me a pair of jeans and a riff thats mean  
And girls that love to share  
  
Heavy metal metal daze  
Heavy metal heavy metal daze  
Heavy metal heavy metal daze  
  
Living like theres no tomorrow  
Yeah Currie says were on the edge  
He said man youre really graffic  
This bands a social wedge  
Yeah we all got hearts made of metal  
And our blood is hot molten rock  
And If I dont hear the sound of metal  
I go into shock  
  
So mister D J play just one for me  
You know the one with the crashin and the screams  
Cause only one thing really sets me free  
Heavy metal loud as it can be
