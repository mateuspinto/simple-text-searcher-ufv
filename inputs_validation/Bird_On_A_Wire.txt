Like a bird on a wire  
Like a drunk in a midnight choir  
I have tried in my way to be free  
Like a fish on a hook  
Like a knight in an old fashioned book  
I have saved all my ribbons with thee  
  
And if I have been unkind  
I hope you will just let it go by  
And if I have been untrue  
I hope you know it was never to you  
  
Like a baby stillborn  
Like a beast with his horn  
I have torn everyone who reached out for me  
  
But I swear by this song  
By all I have done wrong  
Ill make it all up to you  
  
I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch  
He called out to me Dont ask for so much  
And a young man leaning on his darkened door  
He cried out to me Hey why not ask for more  
  
Like a bird on a wire  
Like a drunk in a midnight choir  
I have tried in my way to be free
