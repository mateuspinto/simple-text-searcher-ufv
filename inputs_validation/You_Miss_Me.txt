Everything comes around again  
The circus returns to town again  
Oh no oh yeah  
Now you are at my door again  
Crawling around my floor again oh yeah  
  
Cause your love is gone and  
Your all alone and you miss me  
But you didnt miss me when  
I was all alone your back cause you know  
I cant help but love you  
I cant help but kiss you  
I cant help but let you in  
Im off to the slaughter and off to the lifehole  
Right back to where we begin  
  
Everything comes around again  
What goes up will come down again  
Oh no oh yes  
Wearing your old white dress again  
Making my head a mess again  
  
Cause your love is gone and  
Your all alone and you miss me  
But you didnt miss me when  
I was all alone your back cause you know  
I cant help but love you  
  
I cant help but kiss you  
I cant help but let you in  
Im off to the slaughter and off to the lifehole  
Right back to where we begin  
Cause the love has gone  
And your on your own  
Cause you missed me la la la la  
You just press rewind we go back in time  
  
Cause your love is gone and  
Your all alone and you miss me  
But you didnt miss me when  
I was all alone your back caz you know  
I cant help but love you  
I cant help but kiss you  
I cant help but let you in  
Im off to the slaughter and off to the lifehole  
Right back to where we begin  
  
Cant help but love you  
I cant help but kiss you  
I cant help but let you in  
You miss me you miss me  
Your love has gone and your all alone  
You miss me you miss me
