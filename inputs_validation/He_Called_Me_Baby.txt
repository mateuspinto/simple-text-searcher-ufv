He called me baby baby all night long  
Used to hold and kiss me until dawn  
Then one day I woke and he was gone  
Now theres no more baby baby all night long  
He called me baby baby all night long  
Kissed my tears away when things went wrong  
Oh what Id give if hed just come on back home  
And call me baby baby all night long  
He called me baby baby all night long  
Built me up so high and made me strong  
Now each night in dreams just like a song  
I still hear baby baby  
Still hear baby baby  
Still hear baby baby all night long
