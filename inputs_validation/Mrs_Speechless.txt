Flying through the space  
In my dream there was just a sort of faith  
Surrounded by all the stars  
Took a little trip to Mars  
That was nice  
That was nice  
  
In the dream there was no talking  
There was no shouting  
There was no fighting  
There was just you and me  
Without each others history  
That was nice  
That was nice  
  
Shes my little Miss Speechless  
Shes my biggest weakness  
So hello Mrs Speechless  
How do you do  
How do you do  
Do you know how much I love you  
How do you do  
Do you know how much I miss you  
  
I love the colour of your hair  
And love your lips  
Touch me with your fingertips  
Makes me all warm inside  
Then I just wanna hide  
From you  
From you  
  
Shes my little Miss Speechless  
Shes my biggest weakness  
So hello Mrs Speechless  
How do you do  
How do you do  
Do you know how much I love you  
How do you do  
Do you know how much I miss you  
  
Mrs Speechless  
Dont give up  
Things go wrong  
Dont have her stop  
Dont have her stop  
  
Hold on hold on  
Mrs Speechless  
Hold on hold on hold on hold on  
Mrs Speechless  
Hold on hold on hold on hold on  
  
So hello Mrs Speechless  
How do you do
