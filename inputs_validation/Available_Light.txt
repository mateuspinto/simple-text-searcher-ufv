The restless wind  
Has seen all things  
In every kind of light  
Rising with the full Moon  
To go howling through the night  
  
The sleepless wind  
Has heard all things  
Between the sea and sky  
In the canyons of the city  
You can hear the buildings cry  
  
Oh the wind can carry  
All the voices of the sea  
Oh the wind can carry  
All the echoes home to me  
  
Run with wind and weather  
To the music of the sea  
All four winds together  
Cant bring the world to me  
Chase the wind around the world  
I want to look at life  
In the available light  
  
Play of light  
A photograph  
The way I used to be  
Some halfforgotten stranger  
Doesnt mean that much to me  
  
Trick of light  
Moving picture  
Moments caught in flight  
Make the shadows darker  
Or the colors shine too bright  
  
Oh the light can carry  
All the visions of the sea  
Oh the light can carry  
All the images to me  
  
Run to light from shadow  
Sun gives me no rest  
Promise offered in the east  
Broken in the west  
Chase the sun around the world  
I want to look at life  
In the available light  
  
All four winds together  
Cant bring the world to me  
Shadows hide the play of light  
So much I want to see  
Chase the light around the world  
I want to look at life  
In the available light  
  
Ill go with the wind  
Ill stand in the light
