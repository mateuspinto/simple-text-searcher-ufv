Turn on tha radio nah fuck it turn it off  
Fear is your only god on the radio  
Nah fuck it turn it off  
Turn it off turn on tha radio nah fuck it turn it off  
Fear is your only god on the radio  
Nah fuck it your saviours my guillotine crosses and kerosene  
  
Merge on tha networks slangin nerve gas  
Up jump tha boogie then bang let em hang  
While tha paraniod try ta stuff tha void  
Lets capture this AM mayhem  
Undressed and blessed by tha Lord  
Tha power pendulum swings by tha umbilical cord  
Shock around tha clock from noon til noon  
Men grabbin they mics and stuff em into tha womb  
Terrors tha product ya push  
Well Im a truth addict oh shit I gotta headrush  
Sheep tremble an here come tha votes  
Thrown from tha throat new cages an scapegoats  
Undressed and blessed by tha Lord  
Tha same devil that ran around Managua wit a sword  
Check out tha new style that Ollie found  
I tune in wit a bullet ta shut down tha devil sound  
Shut down tha devil sound  
Tha program of Vietnow  
Shut down tha devil sound  
  
Turn on the radio nah fuck it turn it off

Fear is your only god on the radio

Flex tha cerebellum fire uh  
Somebody gotta shell em  
These evil angels lists hittin tha AM playlist  
Paid ta say this  
That one inhuman illegal single woman  
Tha one wit out a room  
The transmissions wippin our backs  
Yeah comin down like bats from Stacy Coon  
Terrors tha product ya push  
Well Im a truth addict oh shit I gotta headrush  
Tha sheep tremble an here come tha votes  
Thrown from tha throat new cages and scapegoats  
One caution tha mics a detonator unwound  
Ta shut down tha devil sound  
Shut down tha devil sound  
Check tha heads bow in vietnow  
Shut down tha devil sound  
  
Is all tha world jails and churches
