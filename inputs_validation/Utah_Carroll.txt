Arranged and adapted by Arlo Guthrie  
So you ask me my kind friend  
Why I am sad and still  
And why my brow is darkened  
Like the clouds upon the hill  
Rein in your ponies closer  
And Ill tell you all a tale  
Of Utah Carroll partner  
And his last ride on the trail  
In a grave without a headstone  
Without a date or name  
My partner lies there silent  
In the land from which I came  
Long ago we rode together  
Wed ridden side by side  
I loved him like a brother  
And I wept when Utah died  
While riding up one morning  
And our work was almost done  
The cattle quickly started  
On a wild and maddening run  
The bosss little daughter  
Who was riding on that side  
Rushed in to stop the stampede  
It was there my partner died  
Lenore upon her pony  
Tried to turn the cattle right  
But her blanket slipped beneath her  
And she caught and held on tight  
When we all saw that red blanket  
Each cowboy held his breath  
For should her pony fail her  
None could save the girl from death  
When the cattle saw the blanket  
Almost dragging on the ground  
They were maddened in a moment  
And they charged with deafening sound  
The girl soon saw her danger  
And she turned her ponys face  
And bending in her saddle  
Tried the blanket to replace  
Just then she lost her balance  
In the front of that wild tide  
Carrolls voice controlled the round up  
Lie still Lenore he cried  
And then close up beside her  
Came Utah riding fast  
But little did the poor boy know  
The ride would be his last  
Full often from the saddle  
He had caught the trailing rope  
To pick her up at full speed  
Was now his only hope  
He swung low from his saddle  
To take her to his arm  
We thought that hed succeeded  
That the girl was safe from harm  
But such a strain upon his saddle  
Had neer been put before  
And the cinches gave beneath him  
And he fell beside Lenore  
When the girl fell from her saddle  
She had dragged the blanket down  
It lay there close beside them  
Where they lay upon the ground  
Utah took the blanket  
And to Lenore he said  
Lie still and quickly running  
Waved the red thing oer his head  
He turned the maddened cattle  
From Lenore his little friend  
And as the mighty herd rushed toward him  
He turned to met his end  
And as the herd came on him  
His weapon quickly drew  
He was bound to die defended  
As all brave cowboys do  
The weapon flashed like lightning  
And it sounded loud and clear  
As the cattle rushed and killed him  
He dropped the leading steer  
When I broke through that wide circle  
To where poor Utah lay  
With a thousand wounds and bruises  
His life blood ebbed away  
I knelt down close beside him  
And I knew that all was oer  
As I heard him faintly whisper  
Goodbye my sweet Lenore  
Next morning at the churchyard  
I heard the preacher say  
Dont think our kind friend Utah  
Was lost on that great day  
He was a muchloved cowboy  
And not afraid to die  
And well meet him at the round up  
On the plains beyond the sky  
So you ask me my kind friend  
Why I am sad and still  
And why my brow is darkened  
Like the clouds upon the hill  
Rein in your ponies closer  
And Ill tell you all a tale  
Of Utah Carroll partner  
And his last ride on the trail
