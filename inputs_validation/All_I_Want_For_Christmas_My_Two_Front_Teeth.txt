Every body Pauses and stares at me  
These two teeth are gone as you can see  
I dont know just who to blame for this catastrophe  
But my one wish on Christmas Eve is as plain as it can be  
  
All I want for Christmas  
Is my two front teeth  
My two front teeth  
See my two front teeth  
  
Gee if I could only  
Have my two front teeth  
Then I could wish you  
Merry Christmas  
It seems so long since I could say  
Sister Susie sitting on a thistle  
Gosh oh gee how happy Id be  
If I could only whistle  
  
All I want for Christmas  
Is my two front teeth  
My two front teeth  
See my two front teeth  
  
Gee if I could only  
Have my two front teeth  
Then I could wish you  
Merry Christmas
