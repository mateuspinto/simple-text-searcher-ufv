Spread it out over time and find out  
Your prone to let it go  
And it lives  
All about the undead devotion  
About to let it go  
You seem to live  
  
Drop me into the mouth of sorrow  
Wait to swallow me  
And it lives  
Pull me out of a dead tomorrow  
As Im about to give  
I seem to live  
  
From the mouth of the gone  
Laughing out loud  
And it lives  
From the hand of the wrong  
Bury the proud  
As I did  
It lives  
  
Into extinction fall the essence of life  
Spiritual eclipse turns the days into nights  
  
Whitout distinction gotgot got to believe  
Threat of extinction put them down on their knees  
  
Cold desolation calling beckoning you  
Into exctinction fades the rest of what is good and true  
  
Tearing into the last remaining  
Shreds of sanity  
And it lives  
Pull me out of undead devotion  
As Im about to give  
I want to live  
  
From the mouth of the gone  
Laughing out loud  
And it lives  
From the hand of the wrong  
Bury the proud  
As I did  
  
From the mouth of the gone  
Laughing out loud  
And it lives  
From the hand of the wrong  
Bury the proud  
As I did  
It lives
