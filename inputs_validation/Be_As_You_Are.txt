Man I could use a Pina Colada  
Little bit of sun on my skin  
A hammock a book  
Never gonna look back  
Once my feet hit the sand  
Ive had it up to here with this rat race  
Need a smile on my face  
  
I want to go where I can lighten up the load  
Drive a little while on the wrong side of the road  
Get this laying low off to a flying start  
Play my guitar in the Caribbean sun  
Hang with the locals at the Quiet Mon  
Where you can be a tourist a beach bum or a star  
And be as you are  
  
Gettin stuck sure would be easy  
In this palm tree paradise  
Ambition fades with every wave  
For the finer things in life  
Maybe Ill just hang around here  
Go home later next year  
  
I want stay down here lighten up the load  
Drive a little while on the wrong side of the road  
Get this laying low off to a flying start  
Play my guitar in the Caribbean sun  
Hang with the locals at the Quiet Mon  
Where you can be a tourist a beach bum or a star  
And be as you are  
  
I want to play my guitar in the Caribbean sun  
Hang with the locals at the Quiet Mon  
Where you can be a tourist a beach bum or a star  
And be as you are  
Be as you are
