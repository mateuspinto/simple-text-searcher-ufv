See my hand is moving  
Touching all thats real  
And once it stroke the loves body  
Now it claws the past  
  
The scent of a flower  
The colors of the morning  
Friends to believe in  
Tears soon forgotten  
See how the rain drives away another day  
  
If a leaf has fallen  
Does the tree lie broken  
And if we draw some water  
Does the well run dry  
  
The sigh of a mother  
The screaming of lovers  
Like two angry tigers  
They tear at each other  
See how for him lifetimes fears disappear  
  
Once a Jesus suffered  
Heaven could not see him  
And now my ship is sinking  
The captain stands alone  
  
A pawn on the chessboard  
A false move by God will now destroy me  
But wait on the horizon  
A new dawn seems to be rising  
Never to recall this passerby born to die
