My sight finally returns  
Only to see my hands covered with the innocent blood  
Of those I stand before as an example  
And I hold this ember in my heart  
It reminds me of who I once was  
Its the only warmth that I know  
  
Ember of Your faithfulness  
Ember of Your still small voice  
Ember of embracing arms  
Ember of rebirth to You my King  
  
To You my King I offer up this ember  
For the wind of Your Spirit to consume  
Consumed by fire consumed  
Consumed by fire consumed  
Consumed to purge their blood from my hands
