Theres a paper sun  
In a paper sky  
Theres an empty place  
And I dont know why  
That paper sun  
In that paper sky  
Cant help me now shes gone  
Im on my own  
Cant help me now Im all alone  
Theres a painted moon  
In a painted night  
Theres an empty plate  
And it dont seem right  
That painted moon  
In that painted night  
Cant help me now shes gone  
Im on my own  
Cant help me now Im all alone  
And all the pain  
And all the rain that falls  
Cant bring her back  
She dont want me at all  
Theres a falling star  
And it wont touch down  
Theres and empty face  
Another lonely clown  
That falling star that wont touch down  
And all the pain  
And all the rain that falls  
Cant bring her back  
She dont want me at all  
And all the pain  
And all the rain that falls  
Cant bring her back  
She dont want me at all  
And all the pain  
And all the rain that falls  
Cant bring her back  
She dont want me at all Ll Ll  
Ahhhh
