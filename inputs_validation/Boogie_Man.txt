Well there hasnt been a party on a Saturday night  
When the music starts rollin and the feelin is right  
Some joker in the back screams loud as he can  
Boogie is the message that he sends to the band  
So if you really want to boogie  
You better begin by getting up on your feet  
  
And boogie boogie woogie baby now boogie  
Boogie woogie baby now boogie  
Boogie woogie baby now boogie  
Well if you really want to boogie  
Then boogie with me baby tonight  
  
There was a time when boogie was the law of the land  
And everybodyd boogie from New York to Japan  
Even little babies sing before they can speak  
To do the boogie woogie just by putting the beat  
So if you really want to boogie  
You better begin by getting up on your feet  
  
And boogie boogie woogie baby now boogie  
Boogie woogie baby now boogie  
Boogie woogie baby now boogie  
Well if you really want to boogie  
Then boogie with me baby tonight  
  
Well boogie boogie woogie baby now boogie  
I said Boogie woogie baby now boogie  
Boogie woogie baby now boogie  
  
Do you really want to boogie  
Yes I would really like to woogie  
Well if you really want to boogie  
Then boogie with me baby tonight  
Im gonna do your little boogie tonight
