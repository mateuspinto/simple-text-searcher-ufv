Last night I let the party get the best of me  
Waking up in the morning two hoes laying next to me  
Plus I heard an officer arrested me  
Good weed and cold drinks thats the motherfucking recipe  
Nigga and we roll deep so deep  
Its going down in this bitch concrete  
We gon party all night no sleep  
Tell the owner them is all my guys  
So tonight everything is on me  
  
The drinks is on me  
The bitches the hotel  
The weed is all free  
Get high I mean so high  
We dont see the whole suite  
Then we goin fly to a level  
Where you goin need yo own key

Live it up like its the weekend  
When the DJ play the right song  
Gonna drink gon party all night long  
No driving no sleeping  
Live it up like its the weekend  
When the DJ play the right song  
Gonna drink gon party all night long  
  
Leaving from the club now she wanna stay with us  
Came to spend it all dont care what Im paying for  
Used to be too young now Im out here buying the bar  
Every time I look up its another red cup  
Bunch of niggas in the game but they aint playing with us  
They just paying enough  
Man them niggas aint ballin they just laying it up

While on my way to the club  
I had to wait at the club  
But now I dont cause everything is on me
