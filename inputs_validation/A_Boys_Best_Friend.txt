I just dont fit it in this place  
Their thoughts cast me out of here  
Their home has run out of space  
My minds already out of here  
  
Wont you come along dear  
Wont you come along  
  
Words that are spoke alone  
Phrases you will never hear  
  
Empty rooms and a telephone  
That I will never use  
Never fear  
  
I am all alone dear  
I am all alone  
  
My dogs come sit next to me  
A pack of dogs and cigarettes  
My only friends speak no words to me  
But they look at me and they dont forget  
That a boys best friend  
Is his mother or whatever has become his pet
