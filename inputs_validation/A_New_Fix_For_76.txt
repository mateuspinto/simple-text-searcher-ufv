And now that psychedelias gone when the hell ya gonna face reality boy  
We cant be that asinine to think that nineteen sixty nine was the way it
should be  
Theres a new moon with an old shine  
So its time to open your heart as wide as you see  
Sing a new song of mobility  
Get a new fix for seventy six  
And now whether our hairs short or long  
The issue is not really if its right or wrong  
But as long as its clean  right  
Ive gotta realize that our new found philosophies  
Were only synthesized in the delusion of a flower child scene  
Theres a new star in an old space  
So its time you open your soul and set yourself free  
Sing a new song of totality  
Get a new fix for seventy six  
So we thought we were cool and free  
But then our heros blew their minds  
With X and whys and LSD oh what a sin  
Friend we gotta comprehend and we gotta learn from the past  
And not dwell in it again and again and again  
Hold one hand with time  
And open your mind naturally  
Sing a new song of vitality  
Get a new fix for seventy six
