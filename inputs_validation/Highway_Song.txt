I need not fear the love  
You love to love the fear  
I never want to be alone  
Ive forgotten too  
The road keeps moving the clouds  
The clouds become unreal  
I guess Ill always be at home  
Do you want me to try  
Directing your night  
  
An exit lights the sky  
The sky becomes complete  
Traveling hearts divine the throne  
Ive forgotten too  
Friction lines bumps  
The highway song complete  
The signs are all turning right  
  
Do you want me to try  
Directing your night  
Want me to try  
Directing your LIFE  
  
The purest forms of life  
Our days are never coming back  
The cannons of our time  
Our days are never coming back  
  
The purest forms of life  
Our days are never coming back  
The cannons of our time  
Our days are never coming back  
  
Our days are never coming back  
Our days are never coming back  
Our days are never coming back
