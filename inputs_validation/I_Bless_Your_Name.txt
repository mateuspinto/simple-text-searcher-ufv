In prisoners chains with bleeding stripes  
Paul and Silas prayed that night  
And in their pain began to sing  
Their chains were loosed and they were free  
I bless Your name I bless Your name  
I give You honor give You praise  
You are the Life the Truth the Way  
I bless Your name I bless Your name  
Some midnight hour if you should find  
Youre in a prison in your mind  
Reach out and praise defy those chains  
And they will fall in Jesus name  
We bless Your name we bless Your name  
We give You honor give You praise  
You are the Life the Truth the Way  
We bless Your name we bless Your name  
You are the Life the Truth the Way  
We bless Your name we bless Your name
