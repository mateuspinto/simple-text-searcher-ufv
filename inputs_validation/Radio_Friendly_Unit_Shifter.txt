Use just once and destroy  
Invasion of our piracy  
Afterbirth of a nation  
Starve without your skeleton key  
  
I love you for what I am not  
I do not want what I have got  
A blanket acneed with ciggarette burns  
Speak at once while taking turns  
Secondrate third defree burns  
What is wrong with me  
What is what I need  
What do I think I think  
This had nothing to do with what you think  
If you ever think at all  
Bipolar opposites attract  
All of a sudden my water broke  
Hate hate your enemies  
Save save your friends  
Find find your place  
Speak speak the truth
