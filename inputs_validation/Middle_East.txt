In my Promised Land  
In the Middle East  
What will we do about terrorism  
In my Promised Land  
In the Middle East  
What can we do about fanaticism  
You and I on parallel lines  
You and I we are the key  
Dreams are not enough  
To lead and guide us  
To peace  
In the Middle East  
Oh oh oh  
In the Middle East  
Oh oh oh  
Desire for peace  
Such yearning for peace  
Does your country do  
What you believe in  
In my Land there is war  
And were losing our soul  
And ideology  
Is losing meaning  
You and I on parallel lines  
You and I when can we meet  
Dreams are not enough  
To lead and guide us  
To peace  
In the Middle East  
Oh oh oh  
In the Middle East  
Oh oh oh  
  
Sholem sholem  
Ween sholem  
Sholem sholem  
Wen essalam  
Sholem sholem  
Ween sholem  
Salam  
  
You and I on parallel lines  
You and I we are the key  
Dreams are not enough  
To lead and guide us  
To peace  
In the Middle East  
Oh oh oh  
Wen essalam  
Oh oh oh  
In the Middle East  
  
Flare lights flowers mothers fathers  
Homeland green fields and tears  
Borders rivers desert Dead Sea  
We are the key  
Flare lights flowers mothers fathers  
Homeland green fields and tears  
Borders rivers desert Dead Sea  
When can we meet  
  
Yerushalaym  
Yerushalem  
Oh oh oh  
In the Middle East  
Oh oh oh  
In the Middle East
