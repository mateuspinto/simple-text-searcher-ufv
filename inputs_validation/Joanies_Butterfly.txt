What a stormy night when I met the pony  
It was so dark that I could hardly see  
It smelled so sweet you know who and Joanie  
So many butterflies one could not see  
We all could feel desire took off in flight  
It was hotter than fire then came the light  
I smell the heat the dancing ponies  
Unwrapped his wings to dry off Joanie  
The pony he grew in size the thunder and rain  
And finally realized what was what it does and what it come to say  
Love to kiss the cheek of mother nature nobody here can deni such things  
Make the ladies you love come honey no butterfly should be denied its
wings  
He was kick ass rocking horse He was like a hell bent tied to the Gavin pole  
He was a one time fantasy I got the bare bones riding to the Holy Land  
Bare backed riding like a running man nightmares  
And he cant hold the candle to my dreams  
We rode the night and took to wing it was so all right it was everything  
We flew into burning skies the thunder and rain and finally realized  
What it is what it does and what it come to say  
No no no no took off in flight  
No no no no then came the light  
Flashback somethings coming over me no sweat one time fanatsy  
Bare bones all in the wind it seems hell whos the chick  
That rides into my dreams  
No Libury  
No stablize  
No one try to please  
Nobodys eyes  
Well never see us again tell me when it passed  
Let it all begin but all of that time somebody shot an arrow  
Being tempted by the time is never  
Breaking me cause your cold sometimes  
Being seduced by your own pleasures  
Being king on your own time  
He was a kick ass rocking horse he was a  
One horn unicornucopia  
Two two in utopia  
Three star verge in to infinity  
Four four ya yaa hoo
