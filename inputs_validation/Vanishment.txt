Take my hand and come with me  
Take a plate full of everything here  
Thats more than what you need  
  
All my life  
Ive given back  
Build an army to set us back on track  
Youll see when nothing is here  
Then who will you blame  
  
A sickening growl from our forgotten planet  
Its bare and scarred from all weve taken from it  
Then who will you blame  
Now everything must change  
All must change  
  
Were all damned  
Raped unfed world  
  
Gone  
Change  
  
Save enough for them  
There will be nothing left but waste  
Save enough for them  
There will be nothing left
