In the right light study becomes insight  
But the system that dissed us  
Teaches us to read and right  
So called facts are fraud  
They want us to allege and pledge  
And bow down to their God  
Lost the culture the culture lost  
Spun our minds and through time  
Ignorance has taken over  
Yo we gotta take the power back  
Bam Heres the plan  
Motherfuck Uncle Sam  
Step back I know who I am  
Raise up your ear Ill drop the style and clear  
Its the beats and the lyrics they fear  
The rage is relentless  
We need a movement with a quickness  
You are the witness of change  
And to counteract  
We gotta take the power back  
  
Yeah we gotta take the power back  
Come on come on  
We gotta take the power back  
  
The present curriculum  
I put my fist in em  
Eurocentric every last one of em  
See right through the red white and blue disguise  
With lecture I puncture the structure of lies  
Installed in our minds and attempting  
To hold us back  
Weve got to take it back  
Holes in our spirit causin tears and fears  
Onesided stories for years and years and years  
Im inferior Whos inferior  
Yeah we need to check the interior  
Of the system that cares about only one culture  
And that is why  
We gotta take the power back  
  
Yeah we gotta take the power back  
Come on come on  
We gotta take the power back  
  
Hey yo check were gonna have to break it break it  
break it down  
Aw shit  
Ugh  
And like this Ugh  
Come on yeah Bring it back the other way  
  
The teacher stands in front of the class  
But the lesson plan he cant recall  
The students eyes dont perceive the lies  
Bouncing off every fucking wall  
His composure is well kept  
I guess he fears playing the fool  
The complacent students sit and listen to some of that  
Bullshit that he learned in school  
Europe aint my rope to swing on  
Cant learn a thing from it  
Yet we hang from it  
Gotta get it gotta get it together then  
Like the motherfuckin weathermen  
To expose and close the doors on those who try  
To strangle and mangle the truth  
Cause the circle of hatred continues unless we react  
We gotta take the power back  
  
Yeah we gotta take the power back  
Come on come on  
We gotta take the power back  
  
No more lies  
Ugh  
Yeah  
  
Take it back yall  
Take it back atake it back  
Atake it back yall come on  
Take it back yall  
Take it back atake it back  
Atake it back yall come on  
  
Ugh
