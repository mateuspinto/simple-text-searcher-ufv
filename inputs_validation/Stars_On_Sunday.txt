A man walked into a bar  
And said oooooooohhhhh  
And the barman said  
Oooooooohhhhh where did you get that suit  
And the man said  
Give me a drink  
And the barman said oooooooohhhhh  
Closed circuit tv  
Spins round zooms  
On a packet of cigarettes  
Stays on the ashtray  
And fingernails  
And the barman said oooooooohhhhh  
Maybe I just had a bad day  
Program crashing  
Disenchanted  
I hope nobody tries to get in my way  
Solid traffic  
Faces frozen  
She came home  
With cigarette papers  
No compassion  
Just a companion  
She was cooking  
A casserole empty  
No connection  
To our problem  
  
Ice on the window  
Hands on the wheel  
The glove compartment  
Holds a secret  
Stars on Sunday  
You on Tuesday  
I dont know  
If you can hear me
