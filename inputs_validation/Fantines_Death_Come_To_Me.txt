Fantine  
Cosette its turned so cold  
Cosette its past your bedtime  
Youve played the day away and soon it will be night  
  
Come to me Cosette the light is fading  
Dont you see the evening star appearing  
Come to me and rest against my shoulder  
How fast the minutes fly away and every minute colder  
Hurry near another day is dying  
Dont you hear the winter wind is crying  
Theres a darkness which comes without a warning  
But I will sing you lullabies and wake you in the morning  
  
Valjean  
Oh Fantine your time is running out  
But Fantine I swear this on my life  
  
Fantine  
Look Msieur where all the children play  
  
Valjean  
Be at peace  
Be at peace evermore  
  
Fantine  
My Cosette  
  
Valjean  
Shall live in my protection  
  
Fantine  
Take her now  
  
Valjean  
Your child will want for nothing  
  
Fantine  
Good Msieur you come from God in heaven  
  
Valjean  
And none will ever harm Cosette as long as I am living  
  
Fantine  
Take my hand the night grows ever colder  
  
Valjean  
And I will keep you warm  
  
Fantine  
Take my child I give her to your keeping  
  
Valjean  
Take shelter from the storm  
  
Fantine  
For Gods sake please stay till I am sleeping  
And tell Cosette I love her and Ill see her when I wake
