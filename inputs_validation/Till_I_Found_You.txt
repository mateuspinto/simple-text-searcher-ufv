I was alone not long ago  
Without a love to call my own  
I was afraid and thought  
It wasnt meant for me  
I didnt need anybody else  
That was what I would tell myself  
And I believed that was how it would be  
  
I used to think that I was fine  
Oh that I was doing ok  
I didnt know that I was blind  
I just went on along my way  
I didnt know what I was missing  
Til I felt you tender lips  
Kissing my fears away  
Im so glad youre here today  
  
I never had somebody I could lean on  
I never had a shoulder I could cry on  
Til I found you babe   
Til I found you  
And I never had somebody I would think about  
I Never had someone I coudlnt do without  
Til I found you babe   
Til I found you  
  
I had been badly hurt before  
Eversince then I would ignore  
Any chance for love   
I thought it was a lie  
I learned to rely on myself  
And I thought that I was doin well  
Until you came with something  
I just cant deny  
  
I used to think that I was fine oh  
I was doing alright  
I would go on and do my thing  
Everyday and every night  
I didnt know what I was missin  
Til i felt your tender love  
Fillin me up inside  
I love you with all my might  
  
And i never knew how good a love could feel  
Til I found you babe wooh  
And I never thought a love could be so real  
Til I found you
