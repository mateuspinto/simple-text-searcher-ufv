Generals gathered in their masses  
Just like witches at black masses  
Evil minds that plot destruction  
Sorcerers of deaths construction  
In the fields the bodies burning  
As the war machine keeps turning  
Death and hatred to mankind  
poisoning their brainwashed minds  
Oh Lord yeah  
  
Politicians hide themselves away  
They only started the war  
Why should they go out to fight  
They leave that all to the poor  
  
Time will tell on their power minds  
Making war just for fun  
Treating people just like pawns in chess  
Wait till their judgment day comes  
  
Now in darkness world stops turning  
As the war machine keeps burning  
No more war pigs have the power  
Hand of God has struck the hour  
Day of judgment God is calling  
On their knees the war pigs crawling  
Begging mercy for their sins  
Satan laughing spreads his wings  
Oh Lord yeah
