A winning smile of gleaming teeth  
WO on his handkerchief  
He does a handstand for his fans  
Have you seen those beautiful hands  
  
Marching to the sound of drums  
Look at the guitar he strums  
Hes the man with the golden gums  
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm he hums  
  
Chorus  
Just to hear the words you speak  
Just to feel your body heat  
Just to see whats underneath this week  
So take a look at this boy  
Stand back enjoy  
Take a look at his ploy  
Hes cool hes coy  
They go higher higher  
Til they set themselves on fire  
They go higher higher  
Til they set the neighbourhood on fire  
  
In baggy underpants and vest  
He makes a move toward his guest  
Round and round and up the spire  
Loving like a tumble dryer  
Just to see him undressed  
Put his manhood to the test  
I suppose I could have guessed  
  
Repeat chorus
