feat Bon Jovi  
  
It might be hard to be lovers  
But its harder to be friends  
Baby pull down the covers  
Its time you let me in  
Maybe light a couple candles  
Ill just go ahead and lock the door  
If you just talk to me baby  
Til we aint strangers anymore  
  
Lay your head on my pillow  
I sit beside you on the bed  
Dont you think its time we say  
Some things we havent said  
It aint too late to get back to that place  
Back to where we thought it was before  
Why dont you look at me  
Til we aint strangers anymore  
  
Sometimes its hard to love me  
Sometimes its hard to love you too  
I know its hard believing  
That love can pull us through  
It would be so easy  
To live your life  
  
With one foot out the door  
Just hold me baby  
Til we aint strangers anymore  
  
Solo  
  
Its hard to find forgivness  
When we just run out of lies  
Its hard to say youre sorry  
When you cant tell wrong from right  
It would be so easy  
To spend your whole damn life  
Just keeping score  
So lets get down to it baby  
There aint no need to lie  
  
Tell me who you think you see  
When you look into my eyes  
Lets put our two hearts back together  
And well leave the broken pieces on the floor  
Make love with me baby  
Til we aint strangers anymore  
  
Were not strangers anymore  
Were not strangers  
Were not strangers anymore
