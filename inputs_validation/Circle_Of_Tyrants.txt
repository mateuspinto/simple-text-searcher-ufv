After the battle is over  
And the sands drunken the blood  
All what there remains  
Is the bitterness of delusion  
  
The immortality of the gods  
Sits at their side  
As they leave the walls behind  
To reach the jewels gleam  
  
The days have come  
When the steel will rule  
And upon his head  
A crown of gold  
  
Your hand wields the might  
The tyrants the precursor  
You carry the will  
As the morning is near  
  
I sing the ballads  
Of victory and defeat  
I hear the tales  
Of frozen mystery  
  
The new kingdoms rise  
By the circle of the tyrants  
In the land of darkness  
The warrior that was me  
Grotesque glory  
None will ever see them fall  
And hunts and war  
Are like everlasting shadows  
  
Where the winds cannot reach  
The tyrants might was born  
And often I look back  
With tears in my eyes  
Grotesque glory  
None will ever see them fall  
And hunts and wars
