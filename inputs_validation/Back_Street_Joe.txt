Dancing with Back Street Joe  
That was a time I loved  
When we were kids so young  
So long ago  
  
Dancing with Back Street Joe  
Back in a time I loved  
We used to move all night  
That was a time to know  
  
There comes a time in your life  
When you just want to break free  
But now I want to go back  
I want to have him with me  
  
Dancing with Back Street Joe  
We used to want that sound  
And everytime it played  
We used to hang around  
  
There was music and  
There was rhythm and  
There was something I cant explain  
Out of nowhere hed  
Move his shoulder  
And make you feel you could  
Live again  
  
Then came a moment in time  
When I just had to be free  
But now I want to go back  
I want to go back and see  
That look in his eyes again  
And now on the streets  
I look for you Joe  
  
Dancing with Back Street Joe  
Back in the streets I love  
We used to dance all night  
Was it so long ago
