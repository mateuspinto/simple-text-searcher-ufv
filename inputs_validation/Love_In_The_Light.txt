Darkness thick and heavy  
Black and steady screaming darkness  
Anyone who hates his brother  
Who plans evil for another  
Walks in darkness  
Sonlight warm and shining  
Purifying welcome Sonlight  
Everyone who loves completely  
With a heart that opens freely  
Walks in Sonlight  
  
Chorus  
Let us love in the light  
For love is from God  
If we love what is right  
We show whose we are  
In a world of the dying  
Were living our parts  
If we love in the light  
With all of our hearts  
  
Blindness terrifying left for dying spirit blindness  
Anyone who thirsts for evil plots  
His very own upheaval  
Lost in blindness  
New sight truth unending faith unbending new sight  
Everyone who seeks the father leaves the world  
And all its bother  
Sees with new sight  
  
Chorus
