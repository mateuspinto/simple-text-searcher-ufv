You were under the impression  
That when you were walking forward  
Youd end up further onward  
But things aint quite that simple  
  
You got altered information  
You were told to not take chances  
You missed out on new dances  
Now youre losing all your dimples  
  
My jackets gonna be cut and slim and checked  
Maybe a touch of seersucker with an open neck  
I ride a GS scooter with my hair cut neat  
Wear my wartime coat in the wind and sleet  
  
Love reign oer me  
Love reign oer me  
Love  
  
Ive had enough of living  
Ive had enough of dying  
Ive had enough of smiling  
Ive had enough of crying  
Ive taken all the high roads  
Ive squandered and Ive saved  
Ive had enough of childhood  
Ive had enough of graves  
  
Get a job and fight to keep it  
Strike out to reach a mountain  
Be so nice on the outside  
But inside keep ambition  
  
Dont cry because you hunt them  
Hurt them first theyll love you  
Theres a millionaire above you  
And youre under his suspicion  
  
Ive had enough of dance halls  
Ive had enough of pills  
Ive had enough of street fights  
Ive seen my share of kills  
Im finished with the fashions  
And acting like Im tough  
Im bored with hate and passion  
Ive had enough of trying to love
