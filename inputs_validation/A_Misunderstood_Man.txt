The story is a famous one  
Now worshipped now dismissed  
Rehearsed and trawled for meanings  
That may well not exist  
The demon at the storys heart  
The cuckoo in the nest  
Gives so little of himself away  
Which is the reason why you will stay  
In case he falters should betray  
By whom or what possessed  
These are the facts of the matter  
These are the names in the case  
This the story the passion  
The time and the place  
Theyre laid here before you  
So judge if you can   
The devil incarnate or  
A misunderstood man  
His origins his way of life  
His motives  theyre all news  
No shortage of detractors  
To air their noisy views  
The man inspires a thousand lies  
The lover takes his choice  
Remaining coldly in control  
Aware that sadly on the whole  
It is the fool who bares his soul  
Ill give the man a voice  
These are the facts of the matter  
These are the names in the case  
This the story the passion  
The time and the place  
Theyre laid here before you  
So judge if you can   
The devil incarnate or  
A misunderstood man
