Love strung out I am found in the price You paid  
I know that Your life is the blood running through my veins  
My eyes fixed wide on the light of the cross again  
I feel the weight drop in the wake of the empty grave  
  
I want You need You  
I love You Jesus  
My heart beats forever  
Just to know You  
Let go and throw  
My future into Your hands  
Again  
  
Heart beats loud to the sound of a different drum  
Calling me out from the crowd to pursue the One  
  
I want You need You  
I love You Jesus  
My heart beats forever  
Just to know You  
Let go and throw  
My future into Your hands  
  
I want You need You  
I love You Jesus  
My heart beats forever  
Just to know You  
Let go and throw  
My future into Your hands  
Again  
  
Break me down till I soar on grace  
Lead me on through the fire and rain  
The rhythm of my heart beats wild  
For Your endless praise  
Every waking hour I will seek Your face  
  
I want You need You  
I love You Jesus  
My heart beats forever  
Just to know You  
Let go and throw  
My future into Your hands  
  
I want You need You  
I love You Jesus  
My heart beats forever  
Just to know You  
Let go and throw  
My future into Your hands  
Again  
Again  
Again
