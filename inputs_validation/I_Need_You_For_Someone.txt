I need you to keep me straight  
When the world dont seem so great  
And its hard enough you know  
I need you to be around  
When my conscience brings me down  
And the world seems so obscure  
I want you to be the one  
Who tells me off when I do wrong  
And you know I can be bad  
I need you I need you  
Say youll stay make my day  
Now what have I done  
Was it something I said  oh dear  
I need you to turn me off  
When you think Ive said enough  
To the extent of being a bore  
I need you to tell me no  
Slap my wrists and send me home  
Tell me I cant come again  
Now why are you crying   
Have I gone too far  again  
I need you keep me straight  
when the world dont seem so great  
and its hard enough you know  
I need you I need you  
Say youll stay  
Make my day
