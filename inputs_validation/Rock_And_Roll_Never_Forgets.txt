So youre a little bit older and a lot less bolder  
Than you used to be  
So you used to shake em down  
But now you stop and think about your dignity  
So now sweet sixteens turned thirtyone  
You get to feelin weary when the work days done  
Well all you got to do is get up and into your kicks  
If youre in a fix  
Come back baby  
Rock and roll never forgets  
You better get yourself a partner  
Go down to the concert or the local bar  
Check the local newspapers  
Chances are you wont have to go too far  
Yeah the rafters will be ringing cause the beats so strong  
The crowd will be swaying and singing along  
And all you got to do is get in into the mix  
If you need a fix  
Come back baby  
Rock and roll never forgets  
Oh the bands still playing it loud and lean  
Listen to the guitar player making it scream  
All you got to do is just make that scene tonight  
Heh tonight  
  
Well now sweet sixteens turned thirtyone  
Feel a little tired feeling under the gun  
Well all Chucks children are out there playing his licks  
Get into your kicks  
Come back baby  
Rock n Roll never forgets  
Said you can come back baby  
Rock n Roll never forgets
