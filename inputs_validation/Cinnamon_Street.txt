Growing up on Cinnamon Street Everywhere you look there are lots of people to
meet its seven oclock the breakfast treat Now the schoolbus is here
hurry up and grab a seat All the dreams are tiny ones another week has just
begun on Cinnamon Street  
  
There was a girl on Cinnamon Street the same age as me we shared the
curiosity I won her heart cause I could play guitar I promised her heaven
at once and later all the stars But it all remained the same cause things
can never change on Cinnamon Street  
  
I can hear my heartbeat the very first time we made love life was a lazy rest
in the sun Later we went dancing staying up all night long  playing all our
favourite songs Cinnamon songs Oh oh na na na na na  
  
I say goodbye to Cinnamon Street Springtime is here and the air is so dry and
sweet I walk in a cloud the smell of cinnamon bread its in my blood since
the day I was born til I wake up dead And the sun is smiling gently a
funny shade of red Cinnamon Street  
  
I still feel my heartbeat the very first time we made love life was a lazy
day in the sun Later we went dancing hanging out all night long  singing
all our favourite songs Cinnamon songs Oh oh na na na na na na
