I had a hard run  
Running from your window  
I was all night running running running  
I wonder if you care  
I had a runin  
Run around and run down  
Run around a corner  
Run smack into a tree  
  
I had to move  
Really had to move  
Thats why if you please  
I am on my bended knees  
Bertha dont you come around here anymore  
  
Dressed myself in green  
I went down to the sea  
Try to see whats going down  
Maybe read between the lines  
Had a feeling I was falling falling falling  
  
Turned around to see  
Heard a voice calling calling calling  
You was comin after me  
Back to me  
  
I had to move  
Really had to move  
Thats why if you please  
I am on my bended knees  
Bertha dont you come around here anymore  
  
Ran into a rainstorm  
Ducked into a bar door  
It was all night pouring pouring rain  
But not a drop on me  
  
Test me test me  
Why dont you arrest me  
Throw me in the jail house  
Until the sun goes down  
Till it go down  
  
I had to move  
Really had to move  
Thats why if you please  
I am on my bended knees  
Bertha dont you come around here anymore
