Summer days where did you go  
Youve let me down so bad  
Clouds fill the sky  
Gone is the dream  
My happy hunting ground  
Wild buffalo played and I never saw a rainy day  
But it looks like summer days aint coming back  
  
March April May June and July  
You took me for a fall  
Big chief he lie  
Cold wind blows cool so cold to make you die  
Mountain breeze ocean bay and I never saw a rainy day  
But it looks like them summer days aint coming back

Adios amigos  
What can you do when your dream world is gone  
And your friends and lovers too  
  
West Winter Street under the ground  
The air that makes you choke  
Towers of concrete hellish goround  
Were there when I awoke  
City sky pouring down with rain  
That can never hope to ease the pain  
And it looks like summer days aint coming back  
  
Laredo Tornado  
Adios amigos  
Laredo Tornado  
Adios amigos
