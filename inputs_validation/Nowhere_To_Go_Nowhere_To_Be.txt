Like an empty bottle washed up by the waves  
Like an old scooter slipping slowly to its grave  
Like ghosts of old sailors caught somewhere in time  
Like a lone palm watch the world unwind  
  
Chorus  
Nowhere to go and nowhere to be  
Trinidad Charlie on a stool next to me  
Reading his book bout the have and havenots  
In between chapters we take another shot  
And one by one we slide from reality  
With nowhere to go and no where to be  
  
Theres jerk chicken grilling on the grill  
Sure feels good for some time to be still  
Even if its only for a little while  
Sight of the sails in the wind makes me smile  
  
Days turn into night  
When youre stuck in still life  
  
Chorus
