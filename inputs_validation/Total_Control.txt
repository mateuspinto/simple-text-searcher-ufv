Looking counter clockwise  
Knowing what could happen  
Any moment maybe you  
Maybe even you  
  
Steadfast collapse  
Always certain any moment  
Maybe you maybe you  
Maybe even you  
  
Recline complete dreams too sweet  
I cant do it not with you  
Not even with you  
Maybe never with you  
  
And Id sell my soul for total control  
Yeah Id sell my soul for total control  
  
Street wet tonight lovers touch  
Its pure delight  
Always certain any moment  
Maybe even you  
  
Stay in bed stained sheets  
My head hurts I repeat  
Maybe you maybe you  
Maybe even you  
  
And Id sell my soul for total control  
Yeah Id sell my soul for total control  
Id sell my soul for total control  
Over you over you  
Total control over you
