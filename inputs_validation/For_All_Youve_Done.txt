Oh cleanser of the mess Ive made  
Upon the hill our places trade  
Stretched on a cross Your body crushed  
By human hands You formed from dust  
  
Chorus  
How wonderful Your mercy is  
How awesome are Your ways  
I come I come  
To worship You  
For all Youve done  
Oh cleanser of the mess Ive made  
Your boundless love for me portrayed  
With patience for my learning curve  
By holding back what I deserve  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh cleanser of the mess Ive made  
With everything at Your feet laid  
I watch as all my cares erode  
And from my soul these words explode  
  
Chorus
