How do I tell my heart not to break  
Today I met you on the street I smiled at you and then I tried to speak  
But you just turned around and walked away  
Tell me what could I do oh what can I say how do I tell my heart not to break  
On down the street I saw you run to him  
He seemed so happy holdin you again how many times will he kiss you tonight  
Tell me what could I do oh what can I say how do I tell my heart not to break  
I know how to tell my eyes to stop crying  
I know how to tell my hands not to shake  
I know how to tell my friends not to be concerned  
But how do I tell oh but what do I say how do I tell my heart not to break  
Please dont break how do I tell my heart not to break
