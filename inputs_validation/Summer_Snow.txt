Unexpectedly you came back to see  
If Id was waiting like I promised long before  
Your shadow filled the room the music changed its tune  
When I saw you you were standing at the door  
  
Like summer snow you were an unexpected sight  
A blazing sun you were shining in the night  
When I really should have known that youd be coming home  
I waited patiently but I found it hard to see  
  
If you were coming why was there such a long delay  
At times I thought you lied or else you would have tried  
To let me know that you were coming home today  
Like summer snow it falls around me in the cold  
  
I can hear the echoes of the warnings I was told  
That I should know that youd be coming home  
Like summer snow you were an unexpected sight  
A blazing sun you were shining in the night  
  
When I really should have known that youd be coming home  
Unexpectedly you came back to see
