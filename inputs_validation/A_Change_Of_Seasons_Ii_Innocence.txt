I remember a time  
My frail virgin mind  
Watched the crimson sunrise  
Imagined what it might find  
Life was filled with wonder  
I felt the warm wind blow  
I must explore the boundaries  
Transcend the depth of winters snow  
  
Innocence caressing me  
I never felt so young before  
There was so much life in me  
Still I longed to search for more  
  
But those days are gone now  
Changed like a leaf on a tree  
Blown away forever  
Into the cool autumn breeze  
The snow has now fallen  
And my suns not so bright  
I struggle to hold on  
With the last of my might  
  
In my den of inequity  
Viciousness and subtlety  
Struggle to ease the pain  
Struggle to find the same  
  
Ignorance surrounding me  
Ive never been so filled with fear  
All my lifes been drained from me  
The end is drawing near
