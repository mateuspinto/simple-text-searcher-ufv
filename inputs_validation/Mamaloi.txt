Patrick simmons  
Layin back and sittin in the sunshine  
Hot wind I drink me little rum wine  
Straw hat down across my eyes  
Lettin the world go by  
Music it start my toes a tappin  
Drum beat it set my hands a clappin  
Rum wine it get my head a spinnin  
Turnin around and round  
Caribbean current please take me  
I hear you callin me home  
Got to get back to jamaica  
I want no more to roam  
Caribbean current please take me  
I hear you callin me home  
Got to get back to jamaica  
Gypsy she say I got the fever  
I dont know whether to believe her  
But when the wind blow from the sea  
My soul start to fly away  
She give me charm that will protect me  
Necklace with stone from far across the sea  
But island magic much too strong  
It wont let me go this time  
Caribbean current please take me  
I hear you callin me home  
Got to get back to jamaica  
I want no more to roam  
Caribbean current please take me  
I hear you callin me home  
Got to get back to jamaica  
Caribbean current please take me  
I hear you callin me home  
Got to get back to jamaica  
I want no more to roam  
Caribbean current please take me  
I hear you callin me home  
Got to get back to jamaica
