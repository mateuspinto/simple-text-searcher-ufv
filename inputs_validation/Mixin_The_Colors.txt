All across the continents  
Everywhere a soul is sent  
A new mix of the races is taking  
Its what Hitler didnt like  
And it makes a pretty sight  
Just look at what you see on your MTV  
  
Out on the edges they re mixin the colors  
Some they don t like it but me I don t mind  
In every city they re mixing the colors  
Different shades for the whole countryside  
If you leave the hate alone tonight  
Musics gonna get you home tonight  
If you leave the hate alone tonight  
Musics gonna get you home tonight  
Mixin they re mixin  
  
On the edges of the line  
Theres a different kind of kind  
No one seems to claim for  
The race war games  
cause you don t have to choose sides  
It just crucifies your mind  
Theres a hundred million ways  
To live your life for yourself  
  
Out on the edges they re mixin the colors  
Some they don t like it but me I don t mind  
In every city they re mixin the colors  
Different shades for the whole countryside  
  
I like the kids with the ways of their own  
If you leave the hate alone tonight  
Musics gonna get you home tonight  
If you leave the hate alone tonight  
Musics gonna get you home tonight  
Mixin the colors  
  
Now a language that sounds new  
Comes adriftin next to you  
And the music that you hear ls changin too  
cause they re mixin the colors  
Baby the colors
