Chorus 1  
  
Can you smile with everyone on your back  
everyone screamin everyone yellin  
Without the sensitivity there is no fact  
I see you runnin I see ure scared  
  
Chorus 2  
  
You will feel  
The wrath of me  
Can you see  
What I want you 2 be  
  
verse  
I cant see  
its blinding  
Ur love  
used to be so blinding  
But now all I feel  
is the fading taste  
Of ur opinion  
the theory that used to be  
But now stuck in the vibe  
is my heart  
  
You will feel  
The wrath of me  
Can you see  
What I want you 2 be  
You will feel  
The wrath of me  
Can you see  
What I want you 2 be  
  
Can you smile with everyone on your back  
everyone screamin everyone yellin  
Without the sensitivity there is no fact  
I see you runnin I see ure scared  
Can you smile with everyone on your back  
everyone screamin everyone yellin  
Without the sensitivity there is no fact  
I see you runnin I see ure scared  
Can you smile with everyone on your back  
everyone screamin everyone yellin  
Without the sensitivity there is no fact  
I see you runnin I see ure scared  
Can you smile with everyone on your back  
everyone screamin everyone yellin  
Without the sensitivity there is no fact  
I see you runnin I see ure scared  
  
You will feel  
The wrath of me  
Can you see  
What I want you 2 be  
You will feel  
The wrath of me  
Can you see  
What I want you 2 be
