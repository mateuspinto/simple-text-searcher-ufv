Photographs of fancy tricks  
To get your kicks at sixtysix  
He thinks of all the lips that he licks  
And all the girls that hes goin to fix  
She gave a little flirt gave herself a little cuddle  
But theres no place here for the miniskirt waddle  
Capital punishment shes last years model  
They call her Natasha when she looks like Elsie  
I dont want to go to Chelsea  
Oh no it does not move me  
Even though Ive seen the movie  
I dont want to check your pulse  
I dont want nobody else  
I dont want to go to Chelsea  
Everybodys got new orders  
Be a nice girl and kiss the warders  
Now the teacher is away  
All the kids begin to play  
Men come screaming dressed in white coats  
Shake you very gently by the throat  
Ones named Gus ones named Alfie  
I dont want to go to Chelsea  
Oh no it does not move me  
Even though Ive seen the movie  
I dont want to check your pulse  
I dont want nobody else  
I dont want to go to Chelsea
