They say the heart must feel it all  
Know every rise and everyfall  
To earn the right to stand in sunlight  
Someday the sun will always shine  
Deep down inside this heart of mine  
And it will be my time  
  
Rivers keep flowing  
Cold winds keep blowing inside me  
I walk alone  
Hard rain keep fallin  
Lost souls keep callin so lonely  
I hope I find  
Love in time  
Love in time  
  
You know a man cant always choose  
Love has its rhythm and its blues  
I hope its there for me  
  
Rivers keep flowing  
Cold winds keep blowing inside me  
I walk alone  
Hard rains keep callin so lonely  
I hope I find   
Love in time  
Love in time  
  
I hope I find it  
Shinin somewhere  
Somewhere out there  
There will be love in time  
In time  
  
Rivers keep flowing again this part
