Stretching filing  
Against her skin  
Blessed are those  
Who are not kin  
In sin we breathe  
In sex we tie  
Duct tape her legs  
To the red sky  
Foolsome flesh allowances  
The pansies raided the pantry of  
Gabardine dreams promiscuous  
Delight deny not the flavor  
Custard dreams  
Abusing musing  
Marmalade flesh  
Naked spread am I  
  
Actors of the tragic fanthom  
Extend your legs to great saturn  
Brown table tops scream for cover  
At the sight of your new lover  
If today I die  
And cant deny  
The poison chosen  
For tonight  
Borrowed dreams  
Hollowed reveries  
Metal pillows  
Pewter yellows  
Furry roadkill  
House on the hill  
Pouring gravy  
On her thighs still  
If today I die  
And cant deny  
The poison chosen  
For tonight  
  
Borrowed dreams  
Hollowed reveries  
Metal pillows  
Pewter yellows  
Furry roadkill  
House on the hill  
Pouring gravy  
On her thighs still  
  
If today I die  
And cant deny  
The poison chosen  
For tonight
