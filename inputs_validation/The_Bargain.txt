Valjean and Young Cosette arrive at the now empty inn hand in hand  
  
Valjean  
I found her wandering in the wood  
This little child I found her trembling in the shadows  
And I am here to help Cosette  
And I will settle any debt you may think proper  
I will pay what I must pay  
To take Cosette away  
There is a duty I must heed  
There is a promise I have made  
For I was blind to one in need  
I did not see what stood before me  
Now her mother is with God  
Fantines suffering is over  
And I speak here with her voice  
And I stand here in her place  
And from this day and evermore  
  
Mme Thenardier  
Let me have your coat Msieur  
  
Valjean  
Cosette shall live in my protection  
  
Thenardier  
You are very welcome here  
  
Valjean  
I shall not forsake my vow  
  
Thenardier  
Take a glass  
  
Mme Thenardier  
Take a chair  
  
Valjean  
Cosette shall have a father now
