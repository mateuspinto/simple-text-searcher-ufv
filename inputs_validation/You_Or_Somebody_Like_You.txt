Outside my window I swear on my mamas grave  
Faded out the street noise like an out of focus Polaroid  
So I shot the moon and I cursed the wind  
Making me think that you were here again  
Smoke and mirrors somebody stole you away  
Thats the biggest conspiracy since JFK  
So we combed the corners and glass houses  
Right directions but never found it  
  
Well Id trade in all the rest of my days  
Just the mere reflection of your face  
For one shining moment  
  
With you or somebody like you  
With you or somebody just like you  
  
Called inspectors the cops and the CIA  
The drew chalk circles round the place that we used to lay  
But nobody testified not a single witness  
I swore I was crucified with no forgiveness  
The sheriff shined his light like I was drunk and dangerous  
My hands were already tied so he  put away his handcuffs  
And in my blindspot I saw the silhouette  
Your crazy legs smoking a long black cigarette  
But Id trade in all the rest of my days  
Your crooked smile your wicked ways  
Id fill up all this empty space  
  
With you or somebody like you  
With you or somebody just like you  
Oh you or somebody like you oh  
  
Now I should of learned my lesson  
Done what I was told  
Should of counted all my blessings  
Like fingers and toes  
And now Im tripping like a blind man  
And searching high and low  
For you or somebody like you  
For you or somebody just like you  
  
For you or somebody like you  
For you or somebody just like you oh oh  
  
Yeah whoa somebody just like you  
Oh somebody just like you oh
