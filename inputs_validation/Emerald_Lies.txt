To be the prince of possession in the gallery of contempt  
Suffering your indiscreet discretions and you ask me to relent  
As you accumulate flirtations with the calculated calmness of the whore  
I am the harlequin  diamonded costume dripping shades of green  
I am the harlequin  sense strangers violate my sanctuary  
Prowl my dreams  
Plundering your diaries Ill steal your thoughts innocence  
Ravaging your letters unearth your plots innocence  
To don the robes of Torquemada resurrect the inquisition  
In that tortured subtle manner inflict questions within questions  
Looking in shades of green through shades of blue  
I trust you trust in me to mistrust you  
Through the Silk Cut haze to the smeared mascara  
A 40 watt sun on a courtroom drama  
And the coffee stains gather till the pale kimono  
Set the wedding rings dancing on the cold linoleum  
And accusations moths that circle on the light  
Char their wings and spiral senseless suicidal flight  
You packed your world within a suitcase hot tears melt this icy palace  
Dissolve a crystal swallowed by the night  
Looking in shades of green through shades of blue  
Looking in shades of green through shades of blue
