I hear your heartbeat heartbeat heartbeat  
Playing with my mind  
Oh I need you wrapped around me  
Just like I be on a veil  
But now Im only lonely lonely  
Holding on to you  
Oh I need you back here with me yeah  
I think you want it too  
Now I feed you with a new emotion  
Heal you when you cry  
Ill be your loving doctor of the night  
  
Do you want to take me tonight  
Do you want to make me at night  
Do you want to if you want to take what you need  
  
Do you want to make it alright  
Do you want to heaven is tonight  
Oh baby do you want to if you want to take what you need  
  
I hear your heartbeat heartbeat heartbeat  
Begging for more  
Oh I need to hear that question  
Like a dancer needs the floor  
And now youre only only only  
Holding on to me  
Oh now tell me that youre coming back  
One word is all I need  
Now I feed you with a new emotion  
Heal you when you cry  
Ill be your loving doctor of the night
