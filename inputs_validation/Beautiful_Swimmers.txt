Marilyn Monroe did a night shoot in a pool  
Posing naked for a playboy spread  
She was old but she still was cool  
When they wrapped right after midnight  
And the crew went to the bar  
Norma Jean just did the backstroke  
Like she was reachin for a falling star  
  
Beautiful swimmers they know how to move  
Slidin cross the water like a steel guitar  
Beautiful swimmers stay in the groove  
Riding constant currents near and far  
  
Standing in a tidal pool just east of Baltimore  
Watching little blue crabs navigate the eastern shore  
Every bayou stream and river in time runs to the sea  
Every flounder tadpole and soft shell feels the choreography  
  
Beautiful swimmers they know how to move  
Sneakin past the draggers and the oyster bars  
Beautiful swimmers just feel the groove  
Painting liquid brush strokes like Renoir  
  
I miss my dorsal fin I cant explain  
Im a big fish outta water  
Dwellin on the coastal plain  
  
Now if I was as rich as the Agacon  
I tell you what I would do  
Buy every man woman and child on this planet  
A mask and a snorkel too  
Then Id leave that wild migration  
Destination Chesapeake Bay  
Then wed splash our way around the world  
Life is just a water ballet  
  
Come all you beautiful swimmers you know how to move  
Lets crowd across the water like a steel guitar  
Beautiful swimmers stay in the groove  
Catching constant currents near and far
