Intoxicated by the orchids abandoned in the garden  
Demanding morphine curse my soul is burning  
Stranded in the sweet wonderings  
breathing the pale moon silver  
Torn painted lips tasting the last drops of life  
  
Sometimes I feel like screaming  
Sometimes I feel I just cant win  
Sometimes I feelin my soul is as restless as the wind  
Maybe I was born to die in Berlin  
  
I sprinkled cocaine on the floor  
when no one was watching  
I closed my eyes and I let myself sleep  
Creeps and dirty bastards  
demons waitin by my bed  
Theres no choice or difference  
no one seems to notice  
  
Sometimes I feel like screamin  
Sometimes I feel I just cant win  
Sometimes I feelin my soul is as restless as the wind  
Maybe I was born to die in Berlin  
  
Sometimes I feel like screamin  
Sometimes I feel I just cant win  
Sometimes I feelin my soul is as restless as the wind  
Maybe I was born to die in Berlin  
Maybe I was born to die in Berlin
