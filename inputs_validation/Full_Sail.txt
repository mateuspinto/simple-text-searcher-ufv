Full sail full sail  
Steady as you go  
The wind will blow  
Set sail at Frisco Bay  
In a fog cold and gray  
Clear sailing day after day  
Full sail full sail  
Now the air is still  
We lay adrift  
Come upon a sea of trouble  
Till the winds of change shift  
My course is set  
Theres no turning back  
But theres no goin anywhere yet  
Full sail full sail  
Waiting for the wind to blow  
The wind will blow  
Does the silence of the sea  
Sound warning of a storm ahead  
Whispers of the breeze  
Stir and disappear  
To soft to hear  
Whats in store for me  
Adventure on the high seas  
Put the childhood dream to the test  
Find the measure of the man  
Follow the sun heading west  
Full sail  
Steady as you go  
Steady as you go  
Full sail  
Waiting for the wind to blow  
The wind will blow  
Hey full sail  
Mmmm mmmmm  
Hey full sail
