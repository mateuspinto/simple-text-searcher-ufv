Baby your all that I want  
I dont believe in religion I believe in god and baby you my heaven  
Baby your all that I want  
When you lying here in my arms  
Im finding it hard to believe were in heaven  
Shes my lady my baby my women  
  
Shes hot as hell yeah  
But shes my heaven  
She is my eve  
Im her apple for example  
We got that thing for passion  
We got that hot lust  
We got that one in a million love  
All of the above  
Let them talk they envy  
I love them texts you send me  
With a pic attached  
Your girlfriend she friendly  
You like a quarterback  
Your going down in the sack  
Our love is never ending  
Thats why they hate like that  
  
Chorus  
Baby your all that I want  
When your lying here in my arms  
Im finding it hard to believe were in heaven  
And loving is all that I need  
And it found it there in your heart  
It isnt too hard to see  
Were in heaven  
shes my lady my baby my women  
  
Shes there thick n thin  
Shes there rain or fall  
Shes there whether I lose or win whether I rise or fall  
Shes with me wherever we live ravisly on poverty  
She loves me for me  
  
Hold fire thats right  
This life can be deceitful  
In my career attracts  
All the wrong people  
If you find a keeper  
Then you better keep her  
I always put her first  
Her love is heaven on earth  
  
chorus  
Baby your all that I want  
When your lying here in my arms  
Im finding it hard to believe  
Were in heaven  
And loving is all I need  
And it found it there in your heart  
It isnt too hard to see  
Were in heaven  
  
Ooohooahooooo x3  
Were in heaven  
Baby your all that I want  
When your lying here in my arms  
Im finding it hard to believe  
Were in heaven  
Loving is all I need  
And it found it there in your heart  
It isnt too hard to see were in heaven
