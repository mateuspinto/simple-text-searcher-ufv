A Friday night affair  
Out in the city heat  
Always a party there  
Along the sordid street  
And it was guaranteed  
The place to be was Rocketown  
The drinks were two for one  
Inside the crowded bars  
The girls would make their run  
Out on the boulevard  
It was the idol place  
We lived the ways of Rocketown  
Hang around by the street light  
In the heart of the night life  
  
There came a certain man  
A stranger to the crowd  
We didnt understand  
What he was all about  
He walked a different pace  
So out of place in Rocketown  
  
They made a fool of him  
They teased him when hed speak  
But when they knocked him down  
Hed turn the other cheek  
He told me I could find  
A life outside of Rocketown  
Hang around by the street light  
In the heart of the night life  
  
Chorus  
What was his mission  
Where was he going  
Why was his heart light  
Always glowing  
All I was missing  
He stood there holding  
What was his secret  
Could I know it  
  
Some didnt like him near  
Some laughed and turned away  
But me I longed to hear  
All that he had to say  
He had a peace of mind  
I couldnt find in Rocketown  
And when I reached down inside me  
I could feel the emptiness  
  
Chorus  
  
He said its in the heart  
This change that comes to be  
Now he had done his part  
The choice was up to me  
As we were standing there  
He said a prayer for Rocketown  
As we were standing there  
He said a prayer for Rocketown  
As we were standing there  
He said a prayer for Rocketown  
  
He walked off silently  
And prayed for me  
And Rocketown  
  
Chorus
