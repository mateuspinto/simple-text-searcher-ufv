Hey Kids  
You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen  
Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen  
But do you recall  
The most famous reindeer of all  
  
Rudolph the rednosed reindeer  
Had a very shiny nose  
And if you ever saw it  
You would even say it glows  
  
All of the other reindeer  
Used to laugh and call him names  
They never let poor Rudolph  
Join in any reindeer games  
  
Then one foggy Christmas Eve  
Santa came to say  
Rudolph with your nose so bright  
Wont you guide my sleigh tonight  
  
Then how the reindeers loved him  
As they shouted out with glee  
Rudolph the rednosed reindeer  
Youll go down in history
