If you get up in the morning at a quarter to one  
And you want to have a little fun  
You brush your teeth ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch  
  
If you get up in the morning at a quarter to two  
And you want to find something to do  
You brush your teeth ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch  
  
If you get up in the morning at a quarter to three  
And you want to hum a tweedle dee dee  
You brush your teeth ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch  
  
If you get up in the morning at a quarter to four  
And you think you hear a knock at the door  
You brush your teeth ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch  
  
If you get up in the morning at a quarter to five  
And you just cant wait to come alive  
You brush your teeth ch ch ch ch ch ch ch ch
