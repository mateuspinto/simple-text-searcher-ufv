Revelation unknowing has been taken  
Why had I waited so long  
Refrained for this love  
Never open to the hope He has  
How could reject this  
He was calling my name  
Searchin for me  
I always turned away  
Not wanting to believe  
I have a need for Him  
Feeling this emptiness  
Not knowing he could fill  
Drowning in my efforts to find comfort  
I searched and strived for the answer  
But every step I fell and the earth crumbled underneath me  
Now I found this rock  
This stable place  
The pain has gone away  
I place my hope in no other  
My heart it cries it toils inside me  
Wantin all to have this life  
Wanting all to know this love  
But Im reminded of my turning  
Closing my eyes  
Running the other way but Ive decided  
I open my eyes to find more than I was looking for  
My mind screams  
Knowing this is for all  
But not all I want Ive found  
Now I found this rock  
This stable place  
The pain has gone  
I place in no other
