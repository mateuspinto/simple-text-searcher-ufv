The city streets are wet with rain tonight  
Taxi drivers swerve from lane to lane  
A lonely guitar man playin down the hall  
Midnight blues comin through the walls  
  
I tried to call you on the telephone  
I left it off the hook  
Just to hear it ring  
You told me you were better off alone  
I never knew that tears could stain  
  
Im on the roof and Im starin at the stars  
Lookin down at all the cars  
I can see you  
In the window of your favorite corner bar  
But to reach you is just too far  
And I might as well be on mars  
  
The city seems so old and grey and beat  
It closes in and makes me want to suffocate  
And you just live across the street  
But thats a billion miles away  
  
Youve turned my world into a dark and lonely place  
Like a planet lost in space my light is fadin  
Id cross the universe to be right where you are  
But Im right in your backyard  
And I might as well be on mars  
  
Chorus  
I might as well be on mars  
You cant see me  
I might as well be the man on the moon  
You cant hear me  
Oh can you feel me so close  
And yet so far  
Baby I might as well be on mars  
  
Baby I cant fly  
If I could Id come down to ya  
Maybe I should try  
  
Im on the roof and Im starin at the stars  
Lookin down at all lthe cars  
I can see you  
In the window of your favorite corner bar  
But to reach is just too far  
And I might as well be on mars  
  
Chorus
