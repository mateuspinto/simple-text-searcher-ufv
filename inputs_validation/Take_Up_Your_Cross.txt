Take Up Your Cross  
Words by Steve Millikan Jane Johanson and Ray Boltz Music by Steve Millikan  
Chorus  
Take up your cross  
And follow Jesus  
Take up your cross  
Every day  
Dont be ashamed  
To say that you know Him  
Count the cost  
Then take up your cross  
And follow Him  
Chorus  
What are you doing for the King  
Have you given everything  
For the one  
Who gave His all for you  
Dont be satisfied just to know  
That the Lord has saved your soul  
Have you forgotten  
What you need to do  
Chorus repeat  
I said I know sometimes  
That the road is long  
And I know sometimes  
You feel like you cant go on  
But you just
