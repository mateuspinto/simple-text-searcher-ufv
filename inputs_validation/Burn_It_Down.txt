The cycle repeated  
As explosions broke in the sky  
All that I needed  
Was the one thing I couldnt find  
And you were there at the turn  
Waiting to let me know  
  
Were building it up  
To break it back down  
Were building it up  
To burn it down  
We cant wait  
To burn it to the ground  
  
The colors conflicted  
As the flames climbed into the clouds  
I wanted to fix this  
But couldnt stop from tearing it down  
And you were there at the turn  
Caught in the burning glow  
And I was there at the turn  
Waiting to let you know  
  
Were building it up  
To break it back down  
Were building it up  
To burn it down  
We cant wait  
To burn it to the ground  
  
You told me yes  
You held me high  
And I believed when you told that lie  
I played soldier you played king  
And struck me down when I kissed that ring  
You lost that right to hold that crown  
I built you up but you let me down  
So when you fall Ill take my turn  
And fan the flames  
As your blazes burn  
  
And you were there at the turn  
Waiting to let me know  
  
Were building it up  
To break it back down  
Were building it up  
To burn it down  
We cant wait  
To burn it to the ground  
  
When you fall Ill take my turn  
And fan the flames  
As your blazes burn  
  
We cant wait  
To burn it to the ground  
  
When you fall Ill take my turn  
And fan the flames  
As your blazes burn  
  
We cant wait  
To burn it to the ground
