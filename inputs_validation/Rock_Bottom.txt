Seventeen a natures queen know what I mean  
Twenty one a long one  
And you can see the numbers run  
Now you look so peaceful lyin there asleep  
With the wings of God above you  
Before the spirits meet  
  
Rock bottom rock bottom rock bottom  
Rock bottom rock bottom rock bottom  
  
Shadow Earth is closin in above the lamps in your street  
Lucifer goes walkin down free to meet  
Minutes pass so slowly by the hands on your clock  
Heaven dont open when you knock  
  
Rock bottom rock bottom rock bottom  
Rock bottom rock bottom rock bottom  
  
With all darkness closin in  
Will the light reveal your soul  
One sweet kiss on your clay cold lips  
Ill know sleep youll never know  
Where do we go where do we go  
Where do we go from here  
  
Rock bottom rock bottom rock bottom  
Rock bottom rock bottom rock bottom
