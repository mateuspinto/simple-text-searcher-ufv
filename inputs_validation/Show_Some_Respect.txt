I made a resolution and I plan to keep my work  
But I need you to make it work  
Youve got to read the message understand whats on my mind  
Cause not to see would be a crime  
And we could lose it anytime  
  
Weve got to show some respect  
Weve got to learn to protect  
Dont take it for granted I know  
That if you want to stay close  
Weve got to show some respect  
  
But I believe in working then I believe in a little help  
Cause Im not a light unto myself  
Without a thing of value why settle for second best  
We dont know whats up ahead  
And we cant let ourselves forget  
  
Weve got to show some respect  
Weve got to learn to protect  
Dont take it for granted I know  
That if you want to stay close  
Weve got to show some respect  
  
For the things that I love about you  
From the woman that you see inside  
Dont let it walk out the door  
Love follows every time
