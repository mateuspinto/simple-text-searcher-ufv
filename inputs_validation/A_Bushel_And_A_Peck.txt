I love you a bushel and a peck  
A bushel and a peck and a hug around the neck  
A hug around the neck and a barrel and a heap  
A barrel and a heap and Im talkin in my sleep  
About you about you  
Cause I love you a bushel and a peck  
You bet your pretty neck I do  
  
Adoodleoodleoohdoo Adoodleoodleoodleoohdoo  
I love you a bushel and a peck  
A bushel and a peck though you make my heart a wreck  
Make my heart a wreck and you make my life a mess  
Make my life a mess yes a mess of happiness  
About you about you  
Cause I love you a bushel and a peck  
You bet your pretty neck I do  
  
Adoodleoodleoohdoo Adoodleoodleoodleoohdoo  
I love you a bushel and a peck  
A bushel and a peck and it beats me all to heck  
It beats me all to heck how Ill ever tend the farm  
Ever tend the farm I want to keep my arm  
About you about you  
Cause I love you a bushel and a peck  
ou bet your pretty neck I do
