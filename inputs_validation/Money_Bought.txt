Cherry stem with her mouth she could tie in a knot  
Favorite trick she does one in ten that shes got  
Making friends setting trends hardly having to try  
All the looks by the book best that money can buy  
  
Look what your money bought  
Its all that shes got  
It keeps her company  
Straight from Mom and Daddy  
  
Last chance to dance out in back of the bar  
Shakin hands nice to meet you I dont know who you are  
She has a toke and makes a joke about the alley man  
Never pleasured from the treasure in a garbage can  
  
Look what your money bought  
Its all that shes got  
It keeps her company  
Straight from Mom and Daddy
