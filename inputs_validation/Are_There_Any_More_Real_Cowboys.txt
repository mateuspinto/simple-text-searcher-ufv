Are there any more  
Real cowboys  
Left out in these hills  
Will the fire hit the iron  
One more time  
And will one more  
Dusty pickup  
Coming rolling down the road  
With a load of feed  
Before the sun gets high  
Well I hope that  
Working cowboy never dies  
  
Not the one  
Thats snortin cocaine  
When the honkytonks all closed  
But the one  
That prays for more rain  
Heaven knows  
That the good feed  
Brings the money  
And the money buys the clothes  
Not the diamond sequins  
Shining on tv  
But the kind the  
Working cowboy really needs  
  
Are there any more  
Country families  
Still working hand in hand  
Trying hard to stay together  
And make a stand  
While the rows and rows of houses  
Come creepin up on the land  
Where the cattle graze and  
An old grey barn still stands  
Are there any more  
Real cowboys in this land  
  
Are there any more  
Real cowboys in this land
