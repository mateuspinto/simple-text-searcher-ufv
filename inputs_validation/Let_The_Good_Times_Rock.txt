You say that you want me  
I hope that you do  
Cause tell me just where I would be in this world  
Without someone like you  
  
When you say that you need me  
Like only you can  
Oh baby you dont really know what youve done  
To the heart of this man  
  
So baby tonight we will celebrate  
And talk of the times til it gets real late  
Yes baby tonight well appreciate  
Just what weve got  
So let the good times rock  
  
Oh when you squeeze me  
And say that you care  
Theres nothin I know that could drag me away  
When that feelin is there  
  
Oh the way that you move me  
And makin me feel  
Well I could have sworn that I lived in a dream  
If it wasnt for real  
  
Oh baby tonight we will celebrate
