And so my love  
From my window I can see  
A beautiful vision  
And when the music plays  
Your body rises like a bird of grace  
  
Chorus  
Mi morena  
I saw you dancing in the rain  
Holy water  
Shining like a silver flame  
Come like a ghost  
I will watch you dance alone  
Mi morena  
Youre the light within my soul  
  
And so my love  
The way youre moving in your dress  
To a nylon guitar  
On wings of silk and lace  
You lift upon the notes and slip away  
  
Chorus  
  
Take this cross of feathers and bone  
Take this heart Ive carved into stone  
In your name  
  
Where the setting sun surrenders to the moon  
Mi querida  
I will wait for you  
  
Chorus  
  
Mi morena  
Hold your hands out to the light  
Be my lover  
I will fall into your eyes  
Sweet fire of love  
For you Id steal the stars  
Cause I adore you  
O my morena
