I have carried all my hopes and dreams  
To this new land with my own two hands  
I have followed the sun away from ireland  
Now like the red man here I stand  
  
You hear whispers of the homeland call  
Love is less kind than the twilight  
And the passion for me once in your green eyes  
Like the sunlight fades from sight  
  
Twilight eyes I can taste the salty tears of goodbye  
I can feel the cold north sea  
Youll be sailing with the tide  
To the island in your emerald twilight eyes
