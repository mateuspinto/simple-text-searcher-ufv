Cause if I laugh just a little bit  
Maybe I can forget the chance  
That I didnt have to know you  
And live in peace in peace  
  
Cause if I laugh just a little bit  
Maybe I can forget the plans that  
I didnt use to get you  
At home with me alone  
  
Oh yeah  
  
Cause if I laugh just a little bit  
Maybe I can recall the way  
That I used to be before you  
And sleep at night and dream  
Cause if I laugh baby if I laugh  
Just a little bit  
Oh yeah
