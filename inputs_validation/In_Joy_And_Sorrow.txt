Oh girl we are the same  
We are young and lost and so afraid  
Theres no cure for the pain  
No shelter from the rain  
All our prayers seem to fail  
  
In joy and sorrow my homes in your arms  
In a world so hollow  
It is breaking my heart  
In joy and sorrow my homes in your arms  
In a world so hollow  
It is breaking my heart  
  
Oh girl we are the same  
We are strong and blessed and so brave  
With souls to be saved  
And faith regained  
All our tears wiped away  
  
In joy and sorrow my homes in your arms  
In a world so hollow  
It is breaking my heart  
In joy and sorrow my homes in your arms  
In a world so hollow  
It is breaking my heart  
  
In joy and sorrow my homes in your arms  
In a world so hollow  
It is breaking my heart  
In joy and sorrow my homes in your arms  
In a world so hollow  
It is breaking my heart  
  
And my homes in your arms  
And it is breaking my heart  
My homes in your arms  
And it is breaking my heart
