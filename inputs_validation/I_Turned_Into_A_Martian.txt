Oh go  
Possession of the mind is a terrible thing  
Its a transformation with an urge to kill  
Not the body of a man from earth  
Not the face of the one you love cause  
  
Well I turned into a Martian  
Whoa oh oh  
I cant even recall my name  
Whoa oh oh  
Times I never hardly sleep at night  
Whoa oh oh  
Well I turned into a Martian today  
  
I walk down city streets  
On an unsuspecting human world  
Inhuman in your midst  
This world is mine to own cause  
  
Well I turned into a Martian  
Whoa oh oh  
Well I cant even recall my name  
Whoa oh oh  
Times I never hardly sleep at night  
Whoa oh oh  
Well I turned into a Martian today  
  
Go go  
Well I turned into a Martian  
Whoa oh oh  
Well I cant even recall my name  
Whoa oh oh  
Times I never hardly sleep at night  
Whoa oh oh  
Turned into a martian  
Whoa oh oh  
Cant even recall my name  
Oh wont you tell me what the fuck is my name Martian  
Whoa oh oh  
Whoa oh oh
