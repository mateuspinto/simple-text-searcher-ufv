The promoter says he wants to cancel  
Cause there aint enough tickets sold  
The air conditioner on the bus just broke  
And I cant shake this cold  
  
The single lost the bullet  
The singers losin his wife  
Well I might be crazy but I wouldnt change  
A single thing about this life  
  
Sometimes we feel like champions  
Sometimes we just cant win  
Sometimes our records hit the top of the charts  
Or the discount bargain bins  
  
Chorus  
Through 30 years of touring  
Weve remained partners brothers and friends  
We keep it together cause we love it and were sure  
Well be big time before it all ends  
  
Well you know youve got the nitty gritty  
And jimmys got his drums along  
Then Jeffrey and me and bobby will be  
Singing all our favorite songs  
  
Catch the fire from the folks in the front row  
Fan the flames as the beat gets strong  
Its great to be a part of something  
So good thats lasted so long  
  
Well I saw a story in the paper  
Suddenly the bands big news  
The critics all like our records just fine  
But they seem a bit confused  
  
Is it folk or rock or country  
Seems like everybody cares but us  
So just leave us an early wake up call  
So we dont miss the bus  
  
Chorus  
  
The band says it cant stand my latest song its too personal  
But my first wifes second marriage blew up  
She had to get the dang thing annulled  
Well if that aint something to sing about  
Well you tell me what is  
And well give it a beat and put it on the street  
And we just might have another hit  
  
Chorus
