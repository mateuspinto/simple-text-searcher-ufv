Holy  
No measure knows Your worth  
Face down  
Where mercy finds me first  
  
PreChorus  
If You sought perfection  
Id die trying to reach it  
But this broken heart is all You want  
  
Chorus  
Singing holy  
Heart like heaven  
Singing holy  
God Almighty  
Own this heart broke sound  
Singing holy is Your Name  
Singing holy is Your Name  
  
Bridge  
Own the sound forever  
Heart and heaven together  
Singing holy is Your Name  
  
And if it lifts You higher  
Burn in me Your desire  
A passion worthy of Your Name  
  
PreChorus  
And Ill throw my weakness  
Into Your greatness  
If this broken heart is all You want  
  
Chorus 2  
Youre worthy of all praise 2x  
  
For You are worthy  
Jesus Saviour  
You are worthy  
King forever  
Hear my soul cry out  
Singing holy is Your Name
