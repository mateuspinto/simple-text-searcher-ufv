Its a fact Ill attest to mess around and Ill arrest you  
I aint playing you know what Im saying  
This aint the best youve ever hear coming from a female MC  
But you know what I mean Hail to the Queen  
This MC stands for Microphone Commando  
When I command that you take a hand  
And throw it up in the air yeah just like that now  
Chill and watch me rap cause Im flowing Flowing  
Just like water I slaughter Slaughter  
A battle put me in it I win it  
The mission is music and rhythm  
Rhythm backed by words all in my system  
System by techniques techniques I got my heart in  
Heart into the music music I take part in  
One try one God and one destiny  
Just dance for me  
Dance to the music Repeat 2x  
Now understand that you must dance because this is a beat to clap to  
My brother Lance said Latifah you got to make them get up off their feet  
So I put my rhyme to a DJ Mark beat  
Ample samples this for example  
Are made by the 45 King so cancel  
Your plans of moving to the front lines  
Hes a DJ producer and mind you a friend of mine  
I hop dip and spend with the children  
So get down with the sound and you will lend  
To let me bring while I bring  
Queen Latifah to the 45 King creating  
A new style in the name of the Flavor Unit  
Thats the way we like it so Im doing it  
So if you want to know what the plan is to be  
I order you to dance for me  
Dance to the music Repeat 2x  
My voice is your choice at a stage show  
I do it for the Flavor Unit to make you say ho  
With powerful lyrics Im armed  
To let a sucker step up and get bombed  
By a beat created by my producer  
To break you out of the stuff that youre used to  
This here is a moment of truth  
So take the record to the DJ booth  
And lets start this let the beat get dumb  
Cause Im a shake it all night and then some  
People dancing I can spot em  
When I take control you know I got em  
Stop the music Thats not a question  
The Flavor Unit takes no suggestions  
If youre not on the dance tip heres your chance to be  
I order you to dance for me  
Dance to the music Repeat 6x
