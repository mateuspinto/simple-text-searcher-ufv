Oh well well well youve blown my clouds away  
My rains have gone and my sunshines here to stay  
And I feel so good I could really get down today  
Hollerin yes yes Oh what a thrill  
Hollerin yes yes Oh what a thrill  
If you say I can stay baby you know I will  
I could stay here all evenin listenin to the music you play  
Those same sweet songs of a golden yesterday  
Squeezin and teasin and pleasin the evenin away  
Hollerin yes yes Oh what a thrill  
Hollerin yes yes Oh what a thrill  
If you say I can stay baby you know I will  
I will wake up in the morning and do the same sweet things  
Rockin with the record that the same sweet people sing  
All the clouds from the west go east you confess it is spring  
Hollerin yes yes Oh what a thrill  
Hollerin yes yes Oh what a thrill  
I want you to want you to love you of your own free will  
Baby youre so beautiful to want me here to stay  
I would be here forever but I gotta die someday  
But I will be lovin you baby when I pass away  
Hollerin yes yes Oh what a thrill  
Hollerin yes yes Oh what a thrill  
I will love you like a lover loves a lover always
