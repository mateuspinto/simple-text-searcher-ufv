Liam  
Girl I see it in your eyes youre disappointed  
Cause Im the foolish one that you anointed with your heart  
I tore it apart  
And girl what a mess I made upon your innocence  
And no woman in the world deserves this  
But here I am asking you for one more chance  
  
Harry  
Can we fall one more time  
Stop the tape and rewind  
Oh and if you walk away I know Ill fade  
Cause there is nobody else  
  
Its gotta be you  
Only you  
Its gotta be you  
Only you  
  
Liam  
Now girl I hear it in your voice and how it trembles  
When you speak to me I dont resemble who I was  
Youve almost had enough  
And your actions speak louder than words  
And youre about to break from all youve heard  
Dont be scared I aint going no where  
  
Zayn  
Ill be here by your side  
No more fears no more crying  
But if you walk away  
I know Ill fade  
Cause there is nobody else  
  
Its gotta be you  
Only you  
Its gotta be you  
Only you  
  
Zayn  
Oh girl can we try one more one more time  
One more one more can we try  
One more one more time  
Ill make it better  
One more one more can we try  
One more one more  
Can we try one more time to make it all better  
  
Harry  
Cause its gotta be you  
Its gotta be you  
Only you  
Only you  
  
Its gotta be you  
Only you  
Its gotta be you  
Only you
