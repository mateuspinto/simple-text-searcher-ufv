What Are We Doing Here  
Words by Ray Boltz Music by Steve Millikan and Ray Boltz  
Last days big city  
What a place to live  
High rise accommodations  
Are so executive  
Real life just around the corner  
Take a walk aroung the block  
Pass by a family in the alley  
Sleeping in a paper box  
Chorus  
What are we doing here  
Do we spend our time  
Waiting on heaven  
What are we doing here  
Should we pack our bags  
The moment were forgiven  
Oh theres a world  
That needs to know  
Jesus loves them so  
His commission seems quite clear  
What are we doing here  
They say we are pilgrims  
Just passing through  
Strangers in a strange land  
Thats me and you  
One day well be up in glory  
Walking on streets of gold  
But right now my feet  
Are on the pavement  
And I just want to know  
Chorus  
I see a starving brother  
In a foreign land  
I see a homeless child  
Reaching out his hand  
I see a world so angry  
I can feel the rage  
I see a city dying  
Filled with crack cocaine  
I hear the lions roar  
The tires squeal  
A generation saying what is real  
If we know the truth  
If we know the way  
There ought to be something  
We can do or say  
We need to make a stand  
Take a walk  
Win this city  
Do it block by block  
Stand up tall  
And preach it without fear  
If we wont do it  
Then what are we doing here
