Halfway through the night  
I wake up in a dream  
Echoes in my head  
Make every whisper turn into a scream  
  
I dreamed I could fly  
Out in the blue  
Over this town  
Following you  
Over the trees  
Subways and cars  
Id try to find out  
Who you really are  
  
In the middle of the night  
Cool sweatin in my bed  
Got the windows open wide  
Thinkin about all the things you said  
  
I wish I could fly  
Out in the blue  
Over this town  
Following you  
Id fly over rooftops  
The great boulevards  
To try to find out  
Who you really are  
Who you really are  
  
I wish I could fly now  
Wish I could fly now  
Wish I could fly now  
  
I wish I could fly  
Around and around  
Over this town  
The dirt on the ground  
Id follow your course  
Of doors left ajar  
To try to find out  
Who you really are  
  
To try to find out  
Who you really are
