Waiting for the revolution  
New clear vision  Genocide  
Computerize god  Its the new religion  
Program the brain  Not the heartbeat  
  
Onward all you crystal soldiers  
Touch tomorrow  Energize  
Digital dreams  
And youre the next correction  
Mans a mistake so well fix it  
  
Take a look at your own reflection  
Right before your eyes  
It turns to steel  
  
Theres another side of Heaven  
This way  To technical paradise  
Find it on the other side  
When the walls fall down  
  
Love is automatic pleasure  
Virtual reality  
Terminal hate  Its a calculation  
Send in the child for connection  
  
Take a look at the toys around you  
Right before your eyes  
The toys are real  
  
Midnight confessions  
Never heal the soul  
What you believe is fantasy  
  
Your past is your future  
Left behind  
Lost in time  
Will you surrender  
  
Waiting for the revolution  
Program the brain  
Not the heartbeat  
  
Deliver us to evil  
Deny us of our faith  
Robotic hearts bleed poison  
On the world we populate  
  
Virtual existence  
With a superhuman mind  
The ultimate creation  
Destroyer of mankind  
  
Termination of our youth  
For we do not compute
