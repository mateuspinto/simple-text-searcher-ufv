I am hunted by the future  
Will the future be my past  
Or is time a fade out picture  
Of my everlasting cast  
  
Love is phasing  
Love is moving  
To the rhythm of your sight  
I get closer  
To the crossing point of light  
  
Sanctus Sanctus Dominus Deus Sabaoth  
Pleni sunt caeli et terra gloria tua  
Hosanna in excelsis Benedictus  
Holy Holy Lord God of hosts  
Heaven and earth are filled with Thy glory  
Hosanna in the highest  
Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord  
Hosanna in the highest  
  
Let us try to live our lost illusions  
Theyre the sun at night  
If we dont well never taste  
The spice of life  
  
And when it seems that were in a dead end street  
Theres no reason to cry  
Cause we have a helping hand whos always aside  
  
Forever light
