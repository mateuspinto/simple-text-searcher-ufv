There is a shaking  
Let hearts awaken  
Our God is moving  
Forever changing us  
There is a trembling  
There is revival  
The sound of worship  
So great and glorious  
Holy Spirit hear us now  
Chorus  
Breathe on us  
Holy fire fall  
Come and fill this place with  
Your presence  
Like a rushing wind  
Send Your spirit here  
Breath of Heaven breathe on us  
Breath of Heaven breathe on us  
Bridge  
Lift up your hands and shout  
The Lord is with us now  
Lift up your voice and sing  
He is Holy
