There will never be  
Another one like you  
There will never be  
Another one who can  
Do the things you do oh  
Will you give another chance  
Will you try little try  
Please stop and you remember  
We were together anyway all right  
And if you have a certain evenin  
You could lend to me  
Id give it all right back to you  
A how it has to be with you  
I know your moves and your mind  
And your mind  
And your mind  
And your mind  
And your mind  
And your mind  
And your mind  
Will you stop and think and wonder  
Just what youll see  
Out on the train yard  
Nursin penitentiary  
Its gone I cry out long  
Go head brother  
Did you stop it to consider  
How it will feel  
Cold grinded grizzly bear jaws  
Hot on your heels  
Do you often stop and whisper  
Its Saturdays shore  
The whole worlds a savior  
Who could ever ever ever  
Ever ever ever  
Ask for more  
Do you remember  
Will you stop  
Will you stop  
The pain  
And there will never be  
Another one like you  
There will never be  
Another one who can  
Do the things you do oh  
Will you give another chance  
Will you try little try  
Please stop and you remember  
We were together anyway all right  
How you must of think and wondered  
How I must feel  
Out on the meadows  
While you run the field  
Im alone for you  
And I cry  
The sweat look at it  
Optical promise  
Heh heh heh  
Youll be dead and in hell  
Before Im born  
Sure thing  
Brides maid  
The only solution  
Isnt it amazing
