I met a woman at the laundry mat  
She left her sock in my dryer  
I met a woman in a yellow cap  
It said brimstone and fire  
I said is this luck With just a glance  
She smiled and I thought is this a sign   
From above or below Oh nobrimstone  
Brimstone and fire  
  
The next week at the cinema  
She pur her hand on my shoulder  
She almost kissed me walking home  
And I didnt even scold her  
Then I said where is this leading with just a heavy sigh  
I quickened my pace and she was following  
As if her heart would never tire  
Brimstone and fire brimstone and fire  
  
Now we have dinner every Saturday  
I make spaghetti she brings cake  
I make spaghetti with tomato sauce  
Because thats all I can make  
And when she lights the candles  
I think here we go  
But its so pleasant after all  
And I say very low  
Dont forget to light the fire  
  
Brimstone and fire  
Brimstone and fire  
Brimstone and fire
