Just about love like the wing of some highflying bird  
Of the songs I will sing to you you can hear every word  
That I ever heard come to you  
Of the people Ive been of the visions I have seen  
Of the things I think about of situations that I can hear sometimes  
And the places I have been at times just trying to be  
These things can only happen once in a lifetime  
These things can only matter here if you have time  
Someone will touch you softly and it will be me  
Someone will call your name and then come to me free  
Free as the wind free as the rain falling  
Free as the night free as nature calling
