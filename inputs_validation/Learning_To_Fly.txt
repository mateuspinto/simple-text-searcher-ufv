Into the distance a ribbon of black  
Stretched to the point of no turning back  
A flight of fancy on a windswept field  
Standing alone my senses reeled  
A fatal attraction holding me fast how  
Can I escape this irresistible grasp  
  
Cant keep my eyes from the circling skies  
Tongue tied and twisted Just an earth bound misfit I  
  
Ice is forming on the tips of my wings  
Unheeded warnings I thought I thought of everything  
No navigator to find my way home  
Unladened empty and turned to stone  
  
A soul in tension thats learning to fly  
Condition grounded but determined to try  
Cant keep my eyes from the circling skies  
Tonguetied and twisted just an earthbound misfit I  
  
Friction lock set  
Mixture rich  
Propellers fully forward  
Flaps set ten degrees  
Engine gauges and suction check  
  
Mixture set to maximum percent recheck  
Flight instruments  
Altimeters check both  
Garbled word  on  
Navigation lights on  
Strobes on  
To tower Confirm 38Echo ready for departure  
Tower Hello again this is now 1294  
To tower 1294 Its to go  
Tower You may commence your takeoff winds over 10 knots  
To tower 38Echo  
Easy on the brakes Take it easy its gonna roll this time  
Just hand the power gradually and it  
  
Above the planet on a wing and a prayer  
My grubby halo a vapor trail in the empty air  
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly  
Out of the corner of my watering eye  
A dream unthreatened by the morning light  
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night  
  
Theres no sensation to compare with this  
Suspended animation A state of bliss  
Cant keep my mind from the circling skies  
Tonguetied and twisted just an earthbound misfit I
