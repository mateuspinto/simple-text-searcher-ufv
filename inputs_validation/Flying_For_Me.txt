Well I guess that you probably know by now  
I was one who wanted to fly  
I wanted to ride on that arrow of fire right up into heaven  
And I wanted to go for every man  
Every child every mother of children  
I wanted to carry the dreams of all people right up to the stars  
  
And I prayed that Id find an answer there  
Or maybe I would find a song  
Giving a voice to all of the hearts that cannot be heard  
And for all of the ones who live in fear  
And all of those who stand apart  
My being there would bring us a little step closer together  
  
They were flying for me  
They were flying for everyone  
They were trying to see a brighter day for each and everyone  
  
They gave us their light  
They gave us their spirit and all they could be  
They were flying for me  
They were flying for me  
  
And I wanted to wish upon the Milky Way  
And dance upon a falling star  
I wanted to give myself and free myself and join myself with it all  
  
Given the chance to dream it can be done  
The promise of tomorrow is real  
Children of spaceship Earth  
The future belongs to us all  
  
She was flying for me  
She was flying for everyone  
She was trying to see a brighter day for each and everyone  
  
She gave us her light  
She gave us her spirit and all she can be  
She was flying for me  
They were flying for me  
They were flying for everyone  
They were trying to see a brighter day for each and everyone  
  
They gave us their light  
They gave us their spirit and all they can be  
They were flying for me  
They were flying for me  
They were flying for me  
They were flying for me
