Standing alone in the middle of the city  
Man looks around him  
He hardly recognizes what he sees  
Cause he s a man from the past  
Two thousand years ago  
This was his home  
Rivers used to run here  
Birds used to fly around here  
But now it is a different jungle  
A concrete jungle  
  
Chorus  
He s a lonely man  
In the middle of the city  
Missing home so badly  
  
Man s own creation  
Has become his worst enemy  
Weapons of destruction  
Have brought about  
Human extinctionwoho  
Two thousand years ago  
This was his home  
But now it is  
A different jungle  
A concrete jungle  
  
Chorus  
He s a lonely man  
In the middle of the city  
Missing home so badly
