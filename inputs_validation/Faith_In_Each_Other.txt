All the people  
In this world  
All the people  
In this world  
  
Gotta tell you  
Its alright  
Look at the cover  
Of a magazine  
The pride of a nation  
Theyre down on their knees  
I got to tell you  
Let the people speak  
  
Chorus  
I got to tell you  
Yeah you got to have faith  
In each other  
All you ever  
All you ever have for each other  
  
They give us a reason  
To go on living  
Its all in the choices  
That you have to make  
I got to tell you  
You better make them good  
  
Chorus  
  
All the people  
In this world  
All the people  
In this whole wide world  
I got to tell you  
Let the people speak  
  
Chorus
