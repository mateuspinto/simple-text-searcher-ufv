We could try to count the stars  
You already know them each by name  
Every single galaxy was Your design  
Your majesty displayed  
  
Your glory shines before our eyes  
The more we see the more we love You  
  
King of wonders we stand amazed  
Theres no other other than You  
King of wonders You know the way to our hearts  
And the more we see the more we love You  
  
You reveal and we respond  
You have shown theres no one like You God  
Your love and mercy welcomes us  
Into the beauty of this Holiness  
  
Your glory shines before our eyes  
The more we see the more we love You  
  
King of wonders we stand amazed  
Theres no other other than You  
King of wonders You know the way to our hearts  
And the more we see the more we love You  
  
King of wonders we stand amazed  
Theres no other other than You  
King of wonders You know the way to our hearts  
And the more we see the more we love You  
The more we see the more we love You God  
  
Your glory shines before our eyes  
You shine You shine  
  
King of wonders we stand amazed  
Theres no other other than You  
King of wonders You know the way to our hearts  
And the more we see the more we love You  
  
King of wonders we stand amazed  
Theres no other other than You  
King of wonders You know the way to our hearts  
And the more we see the more we love You  
The more we see the more we love You God
