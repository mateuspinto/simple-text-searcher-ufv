You got your reasons to choose not to ever believe me believe me  
Maybe life done you so dirty youll never be free  
Look what youre doing to someone who surreally loves you  
Is that the lonesome old way you wanted to be  I didnt think so  
  
Partner I know we could be soul to soul if we want to  
Oh aint it worth it theres so little lovin today  
Wastin our feelings on something when so little matters  
Think of the time and the chances were throwing away  
  
Chorus  
We can do better than this we can go for the glory   
I hope to God we can handle the worst of our fears   
Then if you will if youre up to the thrill of a lifetime  
Maybe well tear down the walls between heaven and here  
  
Maybe the secret is making believe when it matters  
Maybe just keeping it simple and close to the heart  
Love is so easy to make and so easy to shatter  
We can be stronger together or tear it apart
