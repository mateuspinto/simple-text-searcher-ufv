Fingertip sun at sideshow stalls they throw the balls  
At coconut fur that hides behind coloured shades that blind your eyes  
Every childs mother holds an icecream cone they circle round  
Perceived unknown by an eye that peers from a hole in the tent where no one
goes  
A figure sitting crosslegged on the floor hes clogged and clothed in saffron
robes  
His beads are all he owns  
Slow down slow down  
Someone must have said that slow him down  
Slow down slow down  
Its pictured on the arms of the karma man  
Fairy tale skin depicting scenes from human zoos  
Impermanent toys like peace and war a gentle face youve seen before  
Karma man tattooed on your side the wheel of life  
I see my times and who Ive been I only live now and I dont know why  
I struggle hard to take these pictures in but  
All my friends can see is just the pinkness of his skin  
Slow down slow down  
Someone must have said that slowed him down  
Slow down slow down  
Its pictured on the arms of the karma man  
Slow down slow down  
Someone must have said that slowed him down  
Slow down slow down  
Its pictured on the arms of the karma man
