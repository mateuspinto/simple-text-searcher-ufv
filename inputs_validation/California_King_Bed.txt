Chest to chest  
Nose to nose  
Palm to palm  
We were always just that close  
Wrist to wrist  
Toe to toe  
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose  
So how come when I reach out my finger  
It feels like more than distance between us  
  
In this California king bed  
Were ten thousand miles apart  
Ill be California wishing on these stars  
For youre heart on me  
My California king  
  
Eye to eye  
Cheek to cheek  
Side by side  
You were sleeping next to me  
Arm in arm  
Dusk to dawn  
With the curtains drawn  
And a little last night on these sheets  
So how come when I reach out my finger  
It seems like more than distance between us  
  
In this California king bed  
Were ten thousand miles apart  
Ill be California wishing on these stars  
For youre heart on me  
My California king  
  
Just when I felt like giving up on us  
You turned around and gave me one last touch  
That made everything feel better  
And even then my eyes got wetter  
So confused wanna ask you if you love me  
But I dont wanna seem so weak  
Maybe Ive been California dreaming  
  
In this California king bed  
Were ten thousand miles apart  
Ill be California wishing on these stars  
For youre heart on me  
My California king  
My California king  
  
In this California king bed  
Were ten thousand miles apart  
Ill be California wishing on these stars  
For youre heart on me  
My California king
