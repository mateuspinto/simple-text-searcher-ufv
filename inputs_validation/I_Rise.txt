Voluntary action leading to the scar upon the face  
Planning the reaction the color the moment paint the place  
In blood in fire calling you back home to the demise  
In black desire calling you witnessing the rise  
  
Chorus  
God damn this light  
Take it out  
Let me see what you to hide  
The parasite  
Has his way  
Until the day  
I rise  
  
In pure retribution remorseful as the moment of his birth  
In reconciliation he ponders a solution in the dirt  
In blood in fire a blessing of the few immortalize  
In black desire a calling to the witness of the rise  
  
Chorus  
  
Awaken in time  
God self liberty  
Broken into  
Pride all over me  
Soaring climbing  
Self god liberty  
Broken by ym  
Drive to set it free  
Fire in my freedom  
Hatred in my heart  
Long live the kingdom  
As the king does fall apart  
  
Back off the ceremony  
Count all the flies  
Fight through the maggots  
To reachthe underly  
Pushing to infinty  
Laughs replaced by cries  
Push into liberty  
Sanctify the rise  
God damn your light  
Its in my eyes  
God dman the will to kill me  
God damn your pride  
  
Chorus
