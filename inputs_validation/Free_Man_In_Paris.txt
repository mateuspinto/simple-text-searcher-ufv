The way I see it he said  
You just cant win it  
Everybodys in it for their own gain  
You cant please em all  
Theres always somebody calling you down  
  
I do my best  
And I do good business  
Theres a lot of people asking for my time  
Theyre trying to get ahead  
Theyre trying to be a good friend of mine  
I was a free man in Paris  
I felt unfettered and alive  
There was nobody calling me up for favors  
  
And no ones future to decide  
You know Id go back there tomorrow  
But for the work Ive taken on  
Stoking the star maker machinery  
Behind the popular song  
I deal in dreamers  
And telephone screamers  
Lately I wonder what I do it for  
If l had my way  
Id just walk out those doors  
  
And wander  
Down the Champs Elysees  
Going cafe to cabaret  
Thinking how Ill feel when I find  
That very good friend of mine  
I was a free man in Paris  
I felt unfettered and alive  
Nobody was calling me up for favors  
No ones future to decide  
You know Id go back there tomorrow  
  
But for the work Ive taken on  
Stoking the star maker machinery  
Behind the popular song
