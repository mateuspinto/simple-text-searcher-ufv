I been fightin gravity since I was two  
  
Questers of the prize  
Blind men in the snow  
Some streak the skies  
I choose to go below  
  
Skin moves towards malignant  
Worshiping the sun  
They clamber over corpses  
To be the chosen ones  
  
Drift along liquid sky  
  
Descending through the darkness  
To the vast terrain  
Down here on the bottom  
You rarely hear the rain  
  
Drift along liquid sky
