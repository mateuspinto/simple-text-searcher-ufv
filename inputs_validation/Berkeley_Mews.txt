The leaves of brown came falling through the view  
In Berkeley Mews I first met you  
I staggered through your chilly dining room  
In Berkeley Mews I first met you  
  
Your kitchen sink was cluttered up  
So I couldnt shut her Up forlornly  
I brewed another cuppa up  
And tried to sneak out early in the morning  
  
I thought you had much better things to do  
In Berkeley Mews I first met you  
You drowned my conversation with champagne  
And Berkeley Mews was not the same  
  
I thought you were an intellect  
But now that I reflect you left me reeling  
You made me drink a toast  
And when you finished I was looking at the ceiling  
  
The flood of tears Ive wept thinking of you  
Remind me of that night in Berkeley Mews  
You know that you left me broken hearted  
Berkeley Mews
