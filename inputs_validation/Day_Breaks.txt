Day breaks in your head  
And youre finally alone  
Ill find a way to make it through  
But it keeps raining in your heart  
  
Time follows you around  
Ticking slowly at your nerves  
Its amazing that we made it through  
Cause it keeps raining in your heart  
Raining in your heart  
Maby you should go away  
If the love we had is meant to stay  
Find a place to call your own  
No need to roam around the rooms  
That once made up a home  
  
Day breaks in my head  
And I find myself alone  
Hope you find a way to make it through  
Cause it keeps raining in my heart  
Raining in my heart  
Raining in my heart
