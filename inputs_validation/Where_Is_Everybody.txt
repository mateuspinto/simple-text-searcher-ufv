Did you happen to catch  
Or did it happen so fast  
What you thought would always last  
Has passed you by  
Is everything speeding up  
Or am I slowing down  
Just spinning around  
And I dont know why  
All the pieces dont fit  
Thought I didnt give a shit  
I never wanted to be like you  
But for all I aspire  
I am really a liar  
And Im running out of things I can do  
  
Id like to stay  
But every day  
Everything pushes me further away  
If you could show  
Help me to know  
How its supposed to be  
Where did it go  
  
Pleading and  
Needing and  
Bleeding and  
Breeding and  
Feeding  
Exceeding  
Where is everybody  
Trying and lying  
Defying denying  
Crying and dying  
Where is everybody  
  
Well okay enough  
Youve had your fun  
But come on there has to be someone  
That hasnt yet become  
So numb and succumb  
And god damn I am so tired of pretending  
Of wishing I was ending  
When all Im really doing is trying to hide  
And keep it inside  
And fill it with lies  
Open my eyes  
Maybe I wish I could try  
  
Pleading and needing  
And bleeding and breeding  
And feeding exceeding  
Where is everybody  
Trying and lying  
Defying denying  
Crying and dying  
Where is everybody
