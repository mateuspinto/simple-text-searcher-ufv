My horse is a shackled old man  
His his remorse was that he couldnt survey  
The skies right before  
Right before they went gray  
My horse and my remorse  
Flying over a great bay

My source is the source of all creation  
Her discourse is that we all dont survey  
The skies right before  
Right before they go gray  
My source and my remorse  
Flying over a great bay
