I left her by the river sainte marie  
We pledged our love from to eternity  
Now along the pebbled pathway to her door  
We kissed and then we kissed again and parted on the shore  
  
The angels wings reached out upon the sea  
I saw her kneel and say a prayer for me  
When winters gone and spring is on  
I will meet her by the river sainte marie hay  
  
musical interlude  
  
Hay I left her by the river sainte marie  
We pledged our love from to eternity  
Now along the pebbled pathway to her door  
We kissed and then we kissed again and parted on the shore  
The angels wings reached out upon the sea  
I saw her kneel and say a prayer for me  
When winters gone and spring is on  
I will meet her by the river  
We will meet by the river sainte marie
