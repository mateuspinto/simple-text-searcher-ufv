Aryan mist  
Among the bridges  
You hang by the river  
Youve been here forever  
Aryan mist  
  
What can the matter be  
In a world full of glamor  
Does it lift you up  
Or is it railway carriage charm  
  
You just sit here  
And look from your carriage  
As you watch the scene go by  
  
Gurus from the east  
Gurus from the west  
Does it lift you up  
Or is it railway carriage charm  
  
Aryan mist  
Among the bridges  
You hang by the river  
Youve been here forever  
Aryan mist  
Aryan mist  
  
Theres so many people  
Going down by the river  
Down by the river  
To get clean  
  
The fog of illusion  
The fog of confusion  
Is hanging all over the world  
  
Gurus from the east  
Gurus from the west  
Does it lift you up  
Or is it railway carriage charm  
  
Aryan mist  
Youve been here forever  
Remind me of Krishna  
Love first sweet kiss  
Aryan mist  
  
Aryan mist  
Among the bridges  
You hang by the river  
Youve been here forever  
Aryan mist  
  
Does it lift you up  
Or is it railway carriage charm
