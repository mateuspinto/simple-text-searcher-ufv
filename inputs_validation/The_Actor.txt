Principal actors to the stage please  
Act One is about to begin in 8 seconds  
  
First you cant act now you cant stop  
Whats my motivation  
I used to like you a lot  
I was the class nerd  
Exactly who Im sposed to be  
Im totally Strasberg  
You play a doctor on TV  
What youre doing is SO brave  
  
Deep down youre dirty but you try  
Im a good person  
The truth would break you so you lie  
I want my work to matter  
Its in the choices that you make  
I want to inspire  
No talent just fate  
  
Chorus  
I dont know where you begin  
I end we start  
Again  
They need you love  
We all watch  
The Actor Acting  
  
Good from far but far from good  
All I have is my instinct  
You love to act I wish you would  
Its not acting its reacting  
Act like youre not from out of space  
When Im on stage I feel alive  
You know ambition isnt grace  
For me its the craft  
  
Made of Sex Maida Vale  
Would I do better in New York  
You are the Alpha Male  
Im just too pretty for that role  
You are the good you are the great  
The words have power  
Now let me fill you with my hate

In the future  
Everybody will be anonymous for fifteen minutes  
You are we all are a test card

We ARE the nature of the beast
