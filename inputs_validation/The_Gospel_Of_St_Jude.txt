I have walked down this road you call love  
It is hard and its shallow stony ground  
I have built with these hands some great fortune  
But my heart still beats a hollow sound  
  
Oh yea still now my tears remain  
With all my dreams embraced  
I am told there is peace drawn from wisdom  
But no rest only answers have I found  
Oh yea still now my tears remain  
With all my dreams embraced
