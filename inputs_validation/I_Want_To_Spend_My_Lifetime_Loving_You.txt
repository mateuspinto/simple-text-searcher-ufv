Moon so bright night so fine  
Keep your heart here with mine  
Lifes a dream we are dreaming  
Race the moon catch the wind  
Ride the night to the end  
Seize the day stand up for the light  
  
Chorus  
I want to spend my lifetime loving you  
If that is all in life I ever do  
Heroes rise heroes fall  
Rise again win it all  
In your heart cant you feel the glory  
  
Through our joy through our pain  
We can move worlds again  
Take my hand dance with me  
I want to spend my lifetime loving you  
If that is all in life I ever do  
I will want nothing else to see me through  
If I can spend my lifetime loving you  
  
Though we know we will never come again  
Where there is love life begins  
Over and over again  
Save the night save the day  
Save the love come what may  
Love is worth everything we pay  
I want to spend my lifetime loving you  
If that is all in life I ever do  
I want to spend my lifetime loving you  
If that is all in life I ever do  
I will want nothing else to see me through  
If I can spend my lifetime loving you
