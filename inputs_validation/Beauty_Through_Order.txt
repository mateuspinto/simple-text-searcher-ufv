Its the feel of your blood  
As it flows smoothly down my skin  
Intoxicating my soul  
Immortality seducing me  
  
Burning in your own hell which now binds you to me infinitely  
Spirits of angels dont weep for you enticing me  
Vanity blood  
Left for you to drink  
  
Eternity waits for you  
Vanity blood  
Left for you to drink  
Eternity waits for you to drink  
  
Frozen in time is the ice flowing in your veins  
Are you insane  
At your mercy they suffered while you sat there painless  
Vile and shameless  
  
Crowned you are now for the merciless sins  
Its the end  
Your beauty through order is where blood flows through you  
Where it begins  
  
Vanity blood  
Left for you to drink  
Eternity waits for you  
Vanity blood  
  
Left for you to drink  
Eternity waits for you to drink  
Young life striped down of all its dignity  
Sliced flesh pours out its youthfulness  
  
My lust will never be fully quenched  
Your screams tell me that youre not prepared to die  
  
Creature from hell why cant you see the things I see  
Mirror tells me that you were always meant for me  
You are my sacrifice  
Blood is the deficit  
  
Biting the flesh face my sick prelude  
Now meet your frozen death  
God did not do this  
Heated iron bar I will insert inside your cunt  
  
Mistress of cruelty a name that will not die  
You are my sacrifice  
Blood is the deficit  
Bathing in blood your heart your soul your god  
  
It all belongs to me  
God belongs to me  
It all belongs to me  
  
Murder is my birthright the bloodline proves aristocracy  
Walled in left for dead your actions show no hypocrisy  
My birthright is murder  
Birthright murder  
  
Birthright murder
