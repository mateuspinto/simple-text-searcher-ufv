You must leave now take what you need you think will last  
But whatever you wish to keep you better grab it fast  
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun  
Crying like a fire in the sun  
Look out the saints are comin through  
And its all over now Baby Blue  
  
The highway is for gamblers better use your sense  
Take what you have gathered from coincidence  
The emptyhanded painter from your streets  
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets  
This sky too is folding under you  
And its all over now Baby Blue  
  
All your seasick sailors they are rowing home  
All your reindeer armies are all going home  
The lover who just walked out your door  
Has taken all his blankets from the floor  
The carpet too is moving under you  
And its all over now Baby Blue  
  
Leave your stepping stones behind something calls for you  
Forget the dead youve left they will not follow you  
The vagabond whos rapping at your door  
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore  
Strike another match go start anew  
And its all over now Baby Blue
