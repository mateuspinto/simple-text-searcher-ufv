Lady Madonna children at your feet  
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet  
Who finds the money When you pay the rent  
Did you think that money was Heaven sent  
Friday night arrives without a suitcase  
Sunday morning creep in like a nun  
Mondays child has learned to tie his bootlace  
See how they run  
  
Lady Madonna baby at your breast  
Wonder how you manage to feed the rest  
  
See how they run  
Lady Madonna lying on the bed  
Listen to the music playing in your head  
  
Tuesday afternoon is never ending  
Wednesday morning papers didnt come  
Thursday night you stockings needed mending  
See how they run  
  
Lady Madonna children at your feet  
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
