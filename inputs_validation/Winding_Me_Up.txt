Well it was only a game she was mine for the asking  
And Id figured the whole thing out  
When she told me her name it was more than a feeling  
There wasnt any doubt  
Well it felt so good it was hard to break it  
Too much for me to explain  
But in a matter of time Im gonna be myself again  
Youve been  
Winding me up too long  
Im over my head is it day or night  
Cause woman you aint so strong  
But you caught me by surprise  
Burned me with your eyes  
Cut me down to size  
Well it was only a game she was only a number  
But I figured it out all wrong  
Every time that I said Ill move on tomorrow  
I hung around too long  
Well it felt so good it was too hard to break it  
Too much before me to face  
Now I got nowhere to run she knows my every hidin place  
Youve been  
Winding me up too long  
Im over my head is it day or night  
Cause woman you aint so strong  
But you caught me by surprise  
Burned me with your eyes  
Cut me down to size  
Saw through my disguise  
Winding me up too long  
Im over my head is it day or night  
Cause woman you aint so strong  
But you caught me by surprise  
Burned me with your eyes  
Cut me down to size  
Beat me to the prize  
Hurt me with your lies  
Burned me with your eyes  
Cut me down to size
