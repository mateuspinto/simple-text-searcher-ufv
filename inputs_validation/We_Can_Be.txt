Talk with me  
I believe that we can find a tomorrow  
Lend to me and I will try to borrow  
I can see you and me  
Love is free  
We can be free  
  
Sing with me  
Melodies that soar as high as a swallow  
I can lead the way if you will follow  
I can see you and me  
Love is free  
We can be free  
  
You show me  
Words of beauty that describe your love  
Let me know the things that you are sure of  
I can see you and me  
Love is free  
We can be free  
  
You know me  
Im as reckless as a mountain stream  
Careless as a couldbe someday dream  
I can see you and me  
Love is free  
We can be free
