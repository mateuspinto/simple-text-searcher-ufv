My radio believe me I like it loud  
Im the man with a box that can rock the crowd  
Walkin down the street to the hardcore beat  
While my JVC vibrates the concrete  
Im sorry if you cant understand  
But I need a radio inside my hand  
Dont mean to offend other citizens  
But I kick my volume way past 10  
My story is rough my neighborhood is tough  
But I still sport gold and Im out to crush  
My name is Cool J I devastate the show  
But I couldnt survive without my radio  
Terrorizing my neighbors with the heavy bass  
I keep the suckers in fear by the look on my face  
My radios bad from the Boulevard  
Im a hiphop gangster and my name is Todd  
Just stimulated by the beat bust out the rhyme  
Get fresh batteries if it wont rewind  
Cause I play everyday even on the subway  
I would of got a summons but I ran away  
Im the leader of the show keepin you on the go  
But I know I cant live without my radio  
  
Suckers on my jock when I walk down the block  
I really dont care if youre jealous or not  
Cause I make the songs you sing along  
And your radios def when my records on  
So get off the wall become involved  
All your radio problems have now been solved  
My treacherous beats make ya ears respond  
And my radios loud like a fire alarm  
The floor vibrates the walls cave in  
The bass makes my eardrums seem thin  
Def sounds in my ride yes the front and back  
You would think it was a party not a Cadillac  
Cause I drive up to the ave with the windows closed  
And my bass is so loud it could rip your clothes  
My stereos thumpin like a savage beast  
The level on my power meter will not decrease  
Suckers get mad cause the girlies scream  
And Im still gettin paid while you look at me mean  
Im the leader of the show keepin you on the go  
But I know I cant live without my radio  
Im the leader of the show keepin you on the go  
And I know I cant live without my radio  
  
Dont touch that dial Ill be upset  
Might go into a fit and rip off your neck  
Cause the radios thumpin when Im down to play  
Im the royal chief rocker LL Cool J  
Let your big butt bounce from right to left  
Cause its a actual fact this jam is def  
Most definitely created by me  
Goin down in radio history  
Im good to go on your radio  
And Im cold gettin paid cause Rick said so  
Make the woofers wallop and your tweeters twitch  
Some jealous knuckleheads might try to dis  
But its nothin ya frontin ya girl I am stuntin  
And my radios loud enough to keep you gruntin  
My name is Cool J Im from the rock  
Circulating through your radio nonstop  
Im lookin at the wires behind the cassette  
And now Im on the right standing on the eject  
Wearin light blue Pumas a whole lot of gold  
And jams like these keep me in control  
Im the leader of the show keepin you on the go  
And I know I cant live without my radio  
  
Your energy level starts to increase  
As my big beat is slowly released  
Im on the radio and at the jam  
LL Cool J is who I am  
Ima make ya dance boogie down and rock  
And youll scratch and shake to my musical plot  
And to expand my musical plan  
Cut Creator rock the beat with your hands  
  
Thats right so dont try to front the move  
As you become motivated by the funky groove  
You can see me and Earl chillin on the block  
With my box cold kickin with the gangster rock  
See people cant stop me neither can the police  
Im a musical maniac to say the least  
For you and your radio I made this for  
Cool Js here to devastate once more  
Pullin all the girls takin out MCs  
If ya try to disrespect me I just say Please  
Here to command the hiphop land  
Kick it live with a box inside my hand  
Im the leader of the show keepin you on the go  
But I know I cant live without my radio  
  
Farmers Boulevard yeah you know thats where me and E hang out  
Cool out you know what Im sayin Thats where the cribs at
