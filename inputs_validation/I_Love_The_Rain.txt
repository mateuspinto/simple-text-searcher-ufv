Verse 1  
The clouds are forming  
She comes again  
Ill go and walk with her  
Along the Seine  
Soon shell be storming  
Here comes the wind  
But that dont bother me  
Cause shes my friend  
  
I love the rain  
I love the rain  
  
Verse 2  
Ive held our memories  
All of these years  
So many good times  
And many tears  
I share my dreams with her  
I share my fears  
So I just walk with her until she veers  
Off in the distance  
  
I love the rain  
I love the rain  
I love  
I love  
I love the rain  
  
Verse 3  
Oh  
Just as she always does  
She has to leave  
With her she takes my heart  
Into her breeze  
Sometimes I think that she  
Just likes to tease  
Still Ill be waiting  
For her reprise  
  
I love the rain  
I love the rain  
I love the rain  
I love the rain  
I love the rain  
I love  
I love  
I love  
I love the rain  
Oh yeah  
I love  
I love  
I love  
I love the rain  
Oh yeah
