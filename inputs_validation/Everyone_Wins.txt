CHORUS  
Everyone wins  
If we agree  
Life is a treasure  
And love is the key  
Brothers and sisters  
We must understand  
No ones a loser  
Everyone wins  
CHORUS repeat  
He practiced hard  
So he could run the race  
At the start he fell  
Flat on his face  
The other runners  
Did not pass him by  
They stopped to help him up  
And this is why  
CHORUS repeat  
In the Bible is a special verse  
It says the very last  
Will be the first  
If you are struggling  
Put your hand in mine  
Together we will cross the finish line  
CHORUS repeat 3X
