Hoof prints and foot prints deep ruts the wagons made  
The victor and the loser came by here  
  
No head stones but these bones bring Mascalero death moans  
See the smooth black nuggets by the thousands laying here  
  
Petrified but justified are these Apache tears  
Dead grass dry roots hunger crying in the night  
  
Ghost of broken hearts and laws are here  
And who saw the young squaw they judged by their whiskey law  
  
Tortured til she died of pain and fear  
Where the soldiers lay her back are the black Apache tears  
  
The young men the old men the guilty and the innocent  
Bled red blood and chilled alike with fears  
  
The red men the white men no fight ever took this land  
So dont raise the dust when you pass here  
  
Theyre sleeping and in my keeping are these Apache tears
