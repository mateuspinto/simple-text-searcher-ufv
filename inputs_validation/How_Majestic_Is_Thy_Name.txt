Oh Lord our Lord  
How majestic is thy name in all the Earth  
Oh Lord our Lord  
How majestic is thy name in all the Earth  
  
Thou has displayed thy splendor above the heavens  
Thou has established strength from mouths of infants  
To show all thine enemies  
  
Oh Lord our Lord  
How majestic is thy name in all the Earth  
Oh Lord our Lord  
How majestic is thy name in all the Earth  
  
For when I consider the heavens the work of thy fingers  
The moon and the sun which thou hast appointed  
For what is man that thou dost take thought of him  
And the son of man that thou doest care for him  
  
Hallelujah Lord our Lord  
Oh how I love you  
Hallelujah Lord our Lord  
Oh how I love you  
  
Youve made man a little lower than all of the angels  
And crowned him with glory to rule over your creation  
And under his feet  
Youve put the beasts of the field  
The birds of the heavens and what passes through the seas  
The birds of the heavens and what passes through the sea  
  
Hallelujah Lord our Lord  
Oh how I love you  
Hallelujah Lord our Lord  
Oh how I love you  
  
Hallelujah Lord our Lord  
Oh how I love you  
Hallelujah Lord our Lord  
Oh how I love you
