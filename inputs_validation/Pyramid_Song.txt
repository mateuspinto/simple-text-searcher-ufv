I jumped in the river what did I see  
Blackeyed angels swam with me  
A moon full of stars and astral cars  
And all the figures I used to see  
  
All my lovers were there with me  
All my past and futures  
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat  
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt  
  
I jumped into the river  
Blackeyed angels swam with me  
A moon full of stars and astral cars  
And all the figures I used to see  
  
All my lovers were there with me  
All my past and futures  
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat  
There was nothing to fear nothing to doubt  
  
There was nothing to fear nothing to doubt  
There was nothing to fear nothing to doubt
