May not know by lookin at me  
Who youre looking at exactly  
Wonder who could that be in your stockin  
Suit of red and cheeks of cherry  
Lookin extraordinary  
Spare me cause you scare with your gawkin  
Hold your applause  
Pick up your jaws  
Call me Claus hoah  
I got the spirit of the season in me  
Spreadin joy and toys aplenty  
Nimbly down your chimney Ill be bumpin  
Give me room cause Im a packin  
Only time for toys and snackin  
Love to stay here yackin  
But Im humpin  
I got a cause  
No time to pause  
They call me Claus  
Hoah call me Santa  
Call me Kringle  
Call me Old Saint Nick  
All those have a beautiful ring  
Pleasin is the reason  
And the seasons a kick  
When your Santa  
Baby you gotta swing  
Swing I dare ya yeah  
Hey call me Santa  
Call me Kringle  
Call me Old Saint Nick  
All those have a beautiful ring  
Pleasin is the reason  
And the seasons a kick  
When you Santa  
Baby you gotta swing  
So while in your jammies sleepin  
Roof to roof Ill be a leapin  
Quickly if your creepin for a peepin  
The oohs and aahs  
Are all because  
They call me Claus  
Hold your applause  
Hey watch the paws  
They call me Claus
