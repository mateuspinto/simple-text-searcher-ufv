The Chinese have a saying Dangerous men will meet in our streets  
And so it was We were raised between the clans  
And that meant pressure on me to make more weapons  
And as word of the gold shipment spread  
Strangers suddenly appeared in jungle village  
  
Ay yo ay yo Machete still stainless  
The archbishop run from the Knox  
A Chris biscuit plus play the heart wrists glisten  
Goon captain catch me in Africa black down with 4 5 Somalians  
Black Tims rubber suit Wonder Woman bangers a blue coupe  
Im usually upon the roof countin mad loot  
Root beer reefer teeth frame doin my 1 2  
Smokin with a plain Jane trooper  
Excellent with rifles out in Japan  
In a flight goons switchblade poke out the night boots   
Thrusted on a bullet train with chains on gettin my train on  
Thunder money make bread brainstorm  
All this is made for the Forbes list  
Broads get pissed say Yo he fucked me out his drawers he dissed me  
All this is calculated the Batman with a black hand  
Mafia money killas who rock tans  
  
Bone crushing smooth kicks blades choppin move  bricks  
Masters of the weaponry sells to both cliques  
Blacksmith with the iron fist

Rigamortus I watch the body rot to the bone structure  
Scrape out your brain watch your eyeballs rupture  
Black magic leave your fuckin skull in a soup pot  
Makaveli Vamoose like 2pac  
Suicidal tendencies down to white Hennessy  
Look in the book Im the definition of menace b  
Chokin niggas out for no reason its duck season  
Im cold as ice 6 degrees below freezing  
Stay dipped rock a striped shirt like Freddy Kreuger  
Youse a baby piranha surrounded by barracudas  
Seven thirty Im more like 6 o clock  
Straight up and down beatin up niggas till theres blood in they socks  
Ox em duff em stuff em in black bags  
Without gettin no blood on my fresh rags  
Ruthless heart of a stone grown with no emotions  
I piss out brewhas poisonous potion  
  
Bone crushing smooth kicks blades choppin move  bricks  
Masters of the weaponry sells to both cliques  
Blacksmith with the iron fist  
  
Yeah its the three deadly venoms with weapons in the denims  
Shit thatll shake windows and break lay tenants  
Left field aim crooked and straight blaze in em  
Have you niggas with straightlegs with a fake leg in em  
Wolf in sheeps clothing eyes scoping a tender lamb  
Spin you bitches like a ballroom dinner dance  
GMode dress code got suspender clamps  
Russian roulette money bet go and spend your chance  
You little fleas get killa bees and army ants  
EMS cut up your jeans like zombie pants  
Hollow chrome to your collarbone  
Ping against your dome piece and sound like the first key on a xylophone  
Grown men discussing death and the malice tone  
See how quick the smiley faces turn solid stone  
Ghostface Rae and G be the wildest known  
We straight street we keep seats in the palace throne  
  
Bone crushing smooth kicks blades choppin move  bricks  
Masters of the weaponry sells to both cliques  
Blacksmith with the iron fist
