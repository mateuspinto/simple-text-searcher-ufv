Death Cab for Cutie  
Sung it like a beauty  
Stepped out forgetting  
Danger has a duty  
Lonely night  
He wants to squeeze her tight  
  
They murder for a dollar  
Noone hears you holler  
Wrap up your baby  
Then youll be a scholar  
  
Chorus  
Love stops knocking  
Your heart stops rocking  
Its crime time  
Crime time  
  
Out on the mainland  
Hit him with a right hand  
Stepped on his ego  
Now he feels like a man  
Do it right  
Its a lonely fight  
  
Playing Fats Waller  
Lipstick on your collar  
Back in 1950  
People had their honor  
  
Chorus  
  
They murder for a dollar  
Noone hears you holler  
Wrap up your baby  
Then youll be a scholar  
  
Chorus
