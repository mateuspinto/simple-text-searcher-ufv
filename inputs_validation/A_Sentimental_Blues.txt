A sentimental blues  
Will worry you  
And make you do  
Things that you  
Wouldnt do  
Only when you  
Hear these blues  
  
A sentimental blues  
Will wet your eye  
You wonder why  
You heave a sigh  
You start to cry  
Each time that you  
Hear these blues  
  
Sigh sigh sigh  
And drool  
Cry cry cry  
You fool  
Yes I know that its cool  
  
A sentimental blues  
Deep down inside  
Will make you hide  
Your foolish pride  
A sentimental blues  
Will make you lose  
Your mind  
  
Sigh sigh sigh  
And drool  
Cry cry cry  
You fool  
Yes I know that its cool  
  
A sentimental blues  
Deep down inside  
Will make you hide  
Your foolish pride  
A sentimental blues  
Will make you lose  
Your mind
