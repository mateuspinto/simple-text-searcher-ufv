You make me strong  
You make me weak  
You lift me off my feet  
You give me hope  
When all my dreams  
Seem like theyre out of reach  
You make me understand  
The way the perfect love should be  
You take me to a place  
So high  
I never wanna leave  
Sometimes all the things  
I should have said  
I hope its not too late  
I wanna make you understand  
If the world came crashing down over me  
I know that my life is complete  
Cause Ive held you  
In my arms all night  
Cause I cant imagine life  
Without you by my side  
You whisper in my ears the words  
Just hold me close tonight  
And then the pain is holding me  
Your love just set me free
