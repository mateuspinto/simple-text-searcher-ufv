Tell me all the things you would change  
I dont pretend to know what you want  
When you come around and spin my top  
Time and again time and again  
  
No fire where I lit my spark  
I am not afraid of the dark  
Where your words devour my heart  
And put me to shame put me to shame  
  
When your seven worlds collide  
Whenever Im by your side  
And dust from a distant sun  
Will shower over everyone  
  
Still so young to travel so far  
Old enough to know who you are  
Wise enough to carry the scars  
Without any blame theres no one to blame  
  
Its easy to forget what you learned  
Waiting for the thrill to return  
Feeling your desire burn  
And drawn to the flame  
  
When your seven worlds collide  
Whenever Im by your side  
Dust from a distant sun  
Will shower over everyone  
Dust from a distant sun  
Will shower over everyone  
  
And Im lying on the table  
Washed out in a flood  
Like a Christian feeling vengeance from above  
I dont pretend to know what you want  
But I offer love  
  
Seven worlds will collide  
Whenever Im by your side  
Dust from a distant sun  
Will shower over everyone  
  
As time slips by  
  
As time slips by
