You are my love you are my song liger on  
You are my song I am your singer  
You are my one you are my own melody  
You are my song I am your singer  
  
Someday when were singing  
We will fly away going winging  
  
Sing singing my love song to you  
  
My song is sung  
When day is done harmonies willinger on  
I am your singer  
I am your singer  
Singing my love song to you
