I just needed someone to hold  
When the bottle was empty  
and the nights grew cold  
  
In my hour of darkness  
In my time of need  
You were my angel of mercy  
And helped me to believe  
  
You touched my soul  
When I was lonely  
You held me up  
when I couldnt fly  
  
Theres no words could explain  
How I feel inside  
And this I tell you  
  
In a world full of anger  
and times gone strange  
You held me close  
You held me close to you  
  
Lay my head on your shoulder  
I finally let it all out  
It felt good for a moment  
Not living in a shadow of doubt  
  
But everybody needs a little something  
Tu pull them through  
I gave one for the other  
And God know that the other was you  
  
Chorus  
Now only time will tell  
Only time will tell  
If our love is scratched in sand  
Or if its etched in stone  
Only time will tell  
Only time will tell  
If our love will stand  
Or walk the road along  
  
My angel of mercy  
Pulled me through somehow  
I just hope you know  
I need you now  
  
Youre the one  
That touched my very soul  
The one who held on tight  
God knows you never let go  
  
Angel of mercy  
Its time we closed the door  
Put out the lights  
And burn the fire  
Burn the fire inside  
  
Angel of mercy  
You pulled me through  
And this I tell to you  
God know Id tell it to you
