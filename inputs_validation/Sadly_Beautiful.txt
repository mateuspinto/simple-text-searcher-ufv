From the very first day that you were born  
To the very last time you waved and honked your horn  
Had no chance at all to watch you grow  
Up so sadly beautiful  
Up so sadly beautiful  
  
Baby needs a brand new pair of eyes  
Cause the ones you got now see only goodbyes  
Had no chance at all to let you know  
Oh so sadly beautiful  
Sadly beautiful  
  
Well you got your fathers hair  
And you got your fathers nose  
But you got my soul  
Sadly beautiful  
  
From the very last time you waved and honked your horn  
To a face that turned away pale and worn  
Had no chance at all to let you know  
You left me sadly beautiful  
Left me sadly beautiful  
Sadly beautiful  
So sadly  
So sadly
