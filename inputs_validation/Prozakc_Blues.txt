Well I woke up this morning in a cloud of despair  
I ran my hand across my head  
Pulled out a pile of worried hair  
I went to my physician who was buried in his thoughts  
He said Son youve been reading  
Too much Elephant Talk  
  
He said The thing about depression is  
Well you just cant let it get you down  
You have to see the world for what it is  
A circus full of freaks and clowns  
And youll never please everybody  
Its a well established fact  
He said I recommend a fifth of Jack  
And a bottle of Prozac  
  
What can you give a man who has everything  
Can you give him back his edge  
Can you make him want to sing  
No you can only take from him  
And theres nothing he can do  
Ive got the driving me to drink and eat  
A bottle of Prozac blues  
  
Well I woke up this morning and I shaved off my head  
By the time I realized what I had done I was already dead  
I went to see the gatekeeper who was standing by Heavens door  
He said I hope you brought a good supply of you know
