Went down to Coddingtown to buy for lucky dog  
Moved on up to sonoco to clear my head of smog  
People round town they all line up to buy them chevrolets  
But me I talked to the mopar man been talkin now for days  
  
I went down to Coddingtown it seemed the thing to do  
You can get it all down there from tennis balls to glue  
Standin up in the old smoke shop met a girl named honey pie  
If you shamble long enough you wanna go you gotta go  
  
Bring me on back  
  
Lordy lordy Coddingtown thats the place to be  
Lordy lordy Coddingtown thats the place for me  
  
I went down to Coddingtown and met old Santy Claus  
Beanie boy got a hold of that beard nearly yanked it from his jaws  
I stepped on up to the pizza man and gobbled down some filth  
I shambled round now too damn long I wanna go I gotta go  
  
Bring me on back  
  
Lordy lordy Coddingtown thats the place to be  
Lordy lordy Coddingtown thats the place for me
