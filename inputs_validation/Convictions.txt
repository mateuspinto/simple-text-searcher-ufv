Convictions  
Lost direction  
Once a fielded dream  
Controlled by the heat within  
Cold could not withstand pressure to keep the sky in my hand  
Now a failing breeze grabs a hold and pulls me down  
Hands have turned to clay gripping the hope that lives inside  
I move on praying for a way to save my own will  
Time falls whisked away with each breath I take  
Falling into time  
A waste an endless torture sealing a fate of nothing  
Dark times how do I conquer a life now chains  
Go onward is the only method  
Forget the pain and face our progression on  
Survival is vital  
In pain we succeed  
How did I lose my convictions  
Lost direction  
Try to find a hold  
Certain steps are led astray  
Seems no other space  
Forcing me out theres not enough time  
Now its time to bring all I know to help me win  
Efforts have gone to hell  
Crushing my will to act as the lead  
Failed Fault Lost  
Now climb  
Push away fading terms the burn the skin  
Saved till now  
Haunts me in each step I take  
Times have changed  
Overload is bearing down  
Face each day circled by what I should have done  
Dive Crime Loss  
Give into time and fall  
Procrastination  
Fail to follow through with all I must do  
Days they fall in shame  
I slip in deeper  
Confined by the weight that overbears  
Stood tall but killed in its nature  
Forced steps I do not care whats there  
They can see it in my eyes  
I can it in my eyes  
Time lies  
I am falling further down  
Ive tried but landing is hard  
Fallen chance  
Another lesson  
Ill give it all I can  
Another lesson  
I gave it all I could
