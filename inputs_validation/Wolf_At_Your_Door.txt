Two am with the lost and the lonely  
Walkin past the kids comin back from the party  
Smiles on their faces you remember so well how it was  
Nights in the back of that Buick that you got runnin  
Your baby by your side told the whole world youre comin  
  
Chorus  
Work so hard to do what is right  
Believed in what youre doin  
But so many fights  
Trusted too many believed too much  
Workin your life to the bone  
  
Theres a wolf at your door  
He wants your money wants your soul  
A wolf at your door you give it all he wants more  
Theres a wolf at your door  
He says hes playin for keeps  
Breathin down your neck boy  
Its sure hard to sleep  
  
With a wolf at your door  
  
Theyll take it away when youre not lookin  
Look you in the eyes tell you how good theyre doin  
Smiles on their faces are lies to keep you from knowin  
Youre not guilty you are the victim  
But you still pay for the crime  
Dont look for trouble itll always find you in time  
  
Work so hard to do what is right  
Believed in what youre doin  
But so many fights  
Trusted too many relieved too much  
Workin your life to the bone  
  
Theres a wolf at your door  
He says hes playin for keeps  
Breathin down your neck boy  
Its sure hard to sleep  
  
With a wolf at your door  
  
It wont be broken Ill fight til I drop  
Blood burnin hot in my veins  
  
But they wont be satisfied until they take everything  
  
Chorus
