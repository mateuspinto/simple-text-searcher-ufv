I got a secret you can live and learn  
I got a secret you can live and learn  
You don t know me but I burn  
You don t know me but I burn  
  
Deep in your gut you know  
The right way out  
Deep in your gut you know  
Not like those guys who mess around  
Not like those guys who fake it now  
Perforation problems not all right  
Hanging on a needle out of spite  
Perforation problems no one home  
Stumbling like a dirty slave  
In anger  
  
I got a worm down in my troubled soul  
I got a worm down in my troubled soul  
Now I m all right but theres still holes  
Now I m all right but theres still holes  
  
Every time I think it was my last  
Every time I hoped it was my last  
I watched my future become my past  
I watched my future become my past  
Perforation problems not all right  
  
Hanging on a needle outta fright  
Perforation problems no one home  
Stumbling like a dirty slave  
In anger  
  
I still get angry when I look back  
I still get angry when I look back  
When I look ahead my bags are packed  
Perforation problems not all right  
Hanging on a needle out of fright  
Perforation problems no one home  
Stumbling like a dirty slave  
  
Perforation problems not all right  
Perforation problems every night  
Perforation problems no one home  
Stumbling like a dirty slave  
Perforation problems  
Fright
