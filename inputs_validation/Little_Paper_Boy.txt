Out on the corner standin so bold  
Stood a little paper boy so hungry and cold  
And as the crowd came passin by  
These words he said with tears in his eyes  
  
Please buy a paper from me  
So I can get me somethin to eat  
My clothes are ragged no shoes on my feet  
Said the little paper boy there on the street  
  
Out in this cold wide world all alone  
I have no place on this earth to call home  
I havent had the chance that other kids had  
I have no mother nor even a dad  
  
So please buy a paper from me  
So I can get me somethin to eat  
My clothes are ragged no shoes on my feet  
Said the little paper boy there on the street  
  
Early next mornin as the crowd passed by  
The little boy was gone and they wondered why  
They started searchin and then found him dead  
He died with the papers under his head  
  
No one was there his body to claim  
There he was lying but he felt no pain  
Now he has gone up to Heaven we know  
The little paper boy who died in the snow  
  
There ya have it friends
