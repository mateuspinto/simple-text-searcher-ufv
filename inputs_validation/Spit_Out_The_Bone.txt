Come unto me and dedicate  
Come unto me youll never feel rejection  
Come unto me and terminate  
Remove your heart its only good for bleeding  
Bleeding through your fragile skin

Man overthrown  
Spit out the bone  
  
The flesh betrays the flesh  
Your man has had his time  
We lay him down to rest  
Machine the new divine  
  
Stop breathing  
And dedicate to me  
Stop dreaming  
And terminate for me  
All meaning  
You dedicate to me  
All feelings  
You terminate for me  
  
Disappear like man was never here  
  
Long live machine  
Our future supreme  
Your man overthrown  
Spit out the bone yeah
