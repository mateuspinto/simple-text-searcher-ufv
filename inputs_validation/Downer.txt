Portray sincerity  
Act out of loyalty  
Defend your true country  
Wish away the pain  
Hand out lobotomies  
To save little families  
Surrealistic fantasy  
Bland boring plain  
  
Hold me down in restitution  
Living out your date with fusion  
Is the whole fleece shun in master  
Dont feel guilty master writing  
  
Somebody said that theyre not much like I am  
I know I can  
Make enough of the words for you to follow along  
I sink and then some  
  
Slippery pessimist hypocrite master  
Conservative communist apocalyptic bastard  
Thank you dear God for putting me on this earth  
I feel very privileged in debt for my thirst  
  
Hold me down in restitution  
Living out your date with fusion  
Is the whole fleece shun in master  
Dont feel guilty master writing  
  
Somebody said that theyre not much like I am  
I know I can  
Make enough of the words for you to follow along  
I sink and then some
