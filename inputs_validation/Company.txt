Some can see its poetry  
Come as you are in your broken car  
The company  
Carousel is wishing well  
As a wonder night that spoke delight  
To the company  
Can you hear the summer calling you  
Can you hear him call you now  
Can you hear the summer calling you  
Can you hear him call you now  
Broken dream just a token scheme  
Silver man with a telegram  
For the company  
Scalding blue come talk to you  
Search the cave for the grave  
Of the company  
Can you hear the summer calling you  
Can you hear him call you now  
Can you hear the summer calling you  
Can you hear him call you now  
Can you hear the summer calling you  
Can you hear him call you now  
Can you hear the summer calling you  
Can you hear him call you now  
Can you hear the summer calling you  
Can you hear him call you now  
Can you hear the summer calling you  
Can you hear him call you now
