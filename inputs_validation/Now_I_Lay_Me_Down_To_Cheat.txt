Now I lay me down to cheat  
On the woman I love so  
And if I die between these sheets  
I pray to God shell never know  
  
Shes the best thing in this life  
Why she worships the ground that he walks on  
She waits up for him at night and worries  
Until hes safely home  
And she always believes his stories about working overtime  
And in 20 years beside him cheatins never crossed her mind  
  
Aw but it crossed his  
Early last summer  
In a person of a neighbor that she still calls her friend  
And with a little push from drinkin one too many one night in the fall he gave
in  
And now he wishes he could stop himself  
But theres no easy way  
So he lays down with his lover  
And silently he prays  
  
Now I lay me down to cheat  
On the woman I love so  
And if I die between these sheets  
I pray to God shell never know  
  
In his heart and soul  
He knew he was playing a game he could never win  
But ya know forbidden fruit is sweet  
Why it was sweet enough to make him risk it all again  
And now hes givin up on lookin for a way  
To fight the feeling  
So he prays this simple pray  
And hope it makes it past the hotel ceiling  
  
Now I lay me down to cheat  
On the woman I love so  
And if I die between these sheets  
I pray to God shell never know
