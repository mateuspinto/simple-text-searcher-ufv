Bury me deep in love  
Bury me deep in love  
Take me in under your wing  
Bury me deep in love  
  
Theres a chapel deep in a valley  
For travelling strangers in distress  
Its nestled among the ghosts of the pines  
Under the shadow of a precipice  
  
When a lonesome climbing figure  
Slips and loses grip  
Tumbles into a crevice  
To his icy mountain crypt  
  
Bury him deep in love bury him deep in love  
Take him in under your wing  
Bury him deep in love  
  
When the rock below is shaking  
The heart inside is quaking  
How long this cold dark night is taking  
Bury me deep in love  
  
Bury me deep in love bury me deep in love  
Take me in under your skin  
Bury me deep in love  
  
And the little congregation gathers  
Prays for guidance from above  
They sing Hear our meditation  
Lead us not into temptation  
But give us some kind of explanation  
Bury us deep in love  
  
You may lose me on the east face  
You may lose me on the west  
I may be covered over in the night  
Bury me deep in your love yes  
  
Bury me deep in love Bury me deep in love  
Take me in hide me under your skin  
Bury me deep in love  
  
Bury me deep in love darling bury me deep in your love  
Deeper and deeper Deeper and deeper  
Bury me deep in love
