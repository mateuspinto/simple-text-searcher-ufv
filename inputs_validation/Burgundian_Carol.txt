The winter season of the year  
When to this world our Lord was born  
The ox and donkey so they say  
Did keep his holy presence warm  
How many oxen and donkeys now  
If they were there when first he came  
How many oxen and donkeys you know  
At such a time would do the same  
  
And on that night it has been told  
These humble beasts so rough and rude  
Throughout the noght of holy birth  
Drank no water ate no food  
How many oxen and donkeys now  
If they were there when first he came  
How many oxen and donkeys you know  
At such a time would do the same  
  
As soon as to these humble beasts  
Appeared our Lord so mild and sweet  
With joy they knelt before his Grace  
And gently kissed His tiny feet  
How many oxen and donkeys now  
Dressed in ermine silk and such  
How many oxen and donkeys you know  
At such a time would do as much
