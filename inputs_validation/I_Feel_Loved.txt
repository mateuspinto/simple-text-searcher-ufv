Its the dark night of my soul  
And temptations taking hold  
But through the pain and the suffering  
Through the heartache and trembling  
  
Chorus  
I feel loved  
I feel loved  
  
As the darkness closes in  
In my head I hear whispering  
Questioning and beckoning  
But Im not taken in  
  
Chorus  
  
From the depths of my emptiness  
Comes a feeling of inner bliss  
I feel wanted I feel desired  
I can feel my soul on fire  
  
Chorus
