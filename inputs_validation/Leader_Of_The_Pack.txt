MmIs she really going out with him  
Well there she is Lets ask her  
Betty is that Jimmys ring youre wearing  
Mmhm  
Gee it must be great riding with him  
Is he picking you up after school today  
Mmmm  
By the way where did you meet him  
  
I met him at the candy store  
He turned around and smiled at me  
You get the picture  
Yes we see  
Thats when I fell for the leader of the pack  
  
My folks were always putting him down  
They said he came from the wrong side of town  
They told me he was bad but I knew he was sad  
Thats why I fell for the leader of the pack  
  
One day my dad said find someone new  
I had to tell my Jimmy were through  
He stood there and asked me why but all I could do was cry  
Im sorry I hurt you the leader of the pack  
  
Do do  
He sort of smiled and kissed me good bye  
The tears were beginning to show  
As he drove away on that rainy night  
I begged him to go slow whether he heard  
Ill never know Look out Look out Look out  
  
I felt so helpless what could I do  
Remembering all the things wed been through  
In school they all stop and stare  
I cant hide the tears but I dont care  
Ill never forget him the leader of the pack  
  
Ooh the leader of the pack now hes gone  
the leader of the pack now hes gone  
the leader of the pack now hes gone
