Breakin rocks in the hot sun  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
I needed money cause I had none  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
  
I miss my baby and I feel so sad  
I guess my race is run  
Shes the best girl that I ever had  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
  
Robbin people with a sixgun  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
I miss my baby and I miss fun  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
  
I miss my baby and I feel so sad  
I guess my race is run  
Shes the best girl that I ever had  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law  
  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law  
  
I miss my baby and I feel so sad  
I guess my race is run  
Shes the best girl that I ever had  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won
