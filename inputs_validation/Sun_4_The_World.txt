Forty million years ago  
There was a boy called Leif  
His skin was grey his eyes were red  
The tentacles counted five  
  
Grown up in a normal house  
His parents beloved son  
There never was the slightest sign  
Hed be the chosen one  
  
Leif No  
Help us No  
Shelter us  
  
He turns into the Sun for the world  
Sun for the world  
What would I say what would I say  
Would it be me my friend  
  
Down on earth we see a star  
Dying in its light  
Then suddenly it all explodes  
A new sun shines with Leif  
  
Leif No  
Help us No  
Shelter us  
  
He turns into the Sun for the world  
Sun for the world  
What would I say what would I say  
Would it be me  
  
Sun for the world  
Sun for the world  
What would you do what would you do  
Would it be you my friend  
  
Leif  
Help us  
Shelter us  
  
He turns into the Sun for the world  
Sun for the world  
What would I say what would I say  
Would it be me  
  
Sun for the world  
Sun for the world  
What would you do what would you do  
Would it be you my friend
