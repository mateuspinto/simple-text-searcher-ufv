How many roads must a man walk down  
Before you can call him a man  
How many seas must a white dove sail  
Before she sleeps in the sand  
How many times can a cannon ball fly  
Before theyre forever banned  
  
Chorus  
The answer my friend is blowin in the wind  
The answer is blowin in the wind  
  
How many years can a mountain exist  
Before it is washed to the sea  
How many years can some people exist  
Before theyre allowed to be free  
How many times can a man turn his head  
And pretend that he just doesnt see  
  
Chorus  
  
How many times can a man look up  
Before he can see the sky  
How many ears must one man have  
Before he can hear people cry  
How many deaths will it take till he knows  
That too many people have died  
  
Chorus
