Have you ever heard a love song that you didnt understand  
Were you ever in a tea house on the Island of Japan  
And have you ever traveled over many thousand miles  
To see a pretty Geisha girl dressed in Oriental style  
Theyve read it in the Tealeaves and its written in the sand  
I found love by the heartfull in the foreign distant land  
Tell the homefolks that Im happy with someone whos true I know  
I love a pretty Geisha girl where the ocean breezes blow  
  
I have stood and watched the sunrise by the waters of the sea  
And wondered how much beauty in this whole world can that be  
My dreams are all worth dreaming and it makes my life worth while  
To see a pretty Geisha girl dressed in Oriental style  
Theyve read it in the Tealeaves
