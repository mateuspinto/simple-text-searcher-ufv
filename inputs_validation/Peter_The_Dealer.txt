We were waiting for peter the dealer  
He comes in the evening when were fussing in bed  
He says good morning heres your breakfast  
And give us plates of stone  
Take a pinta blood each from us to give to the poor  
  
We count the windows in the cities and tell each other  
Yes life is a helluva lot of waiting time  
  
Our minds are objects of constipation  
Our bodies are subject to dissipation  
So keep your intentions in a clear bottle  
And leave it in the cupboard when youre out  
  
We were waiting for peter the wheeler  
He comes in the morning when were fast asleep  
Gives us a trip thats spending hundred years in a day  
And takes a bone each from us to give to the dogs  
  
We count the wrinkles on the globe and tell each other  
Yes life is a helluva lot of waiting time  
  
Our minds are objects of constipation  
Our bodies are subject to dissipation  
So keep your intentions in a clear bottle  
And leave it on the shelf when you rap  
  
We were waiting for peter the blower  
He comes in when were fixing snow on rock  
Gives us orange juice laced with sunshine and spring  
And takes a heart each from us to give to the world  
  
We count the memories that are lost and tell each other  
Yes life is a helluva lot of waiting time  
  
Our minds are objects of constipation  
Our bodies are subject to dissipation  
So keep your intentions in a clear bottle  
Throw it in the ocean when you go  
  
We were waiting for peter the weaver  
He comes in a flash when were wide awake  
Says the world cant give us answers  
Cause its stuttering in its mind  
Takes a head each off us to give us some peace  
  
We count the lights in the universe and tell each other  
Yes life is a helluva lot of waiting time
