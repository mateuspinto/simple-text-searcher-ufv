I used to be such a sweet sweet thing  
Til they got a hold of me  
I opened doors for little old ladies  
I helped the blind to see  
I got no friends cause they read the papers  
They cant be seen with me and Im gettin real shot down  
And Im feeling mean  
  
Chorus  
No more Mister Nice Guy  
No more Mister Clean  
No more Mister Nice Guy  
They say hes sick hes obscene  
  
I got no friends cause they read the papers  
They cant be seen with me and Im feelin real shot down  
And Im gettin mean  
  
No more Mister Nice Guy  
No more Mister Clean  
No more Mister Nice Guy  
They say hes sick hes obscene  
  
My dog bit me on the leg today  
My cat clawed my eyes  
Mas been thrown out of the social circle  
And dad has to hide  
I went to church incognito  
When everybody rose the Reverend Smith  
He recognized me  
And punched me in the nose he said  
  
No more Mister Nice Guy  
No more Mister Clean  
No more Mister Nice Guy  
He said youre sick youre obscene  
  
No more Mister Nice Guy  
No more Mister Clean  
No more Mister Nice Guy  
He said youre sick youre obscene
