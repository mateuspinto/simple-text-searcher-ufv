there is no space  
in the millimeter between me and you  
and the light turns suddenly blue  
  
in the millimeter between you and me  
I can see  
a snapshot of an orange childhood  
  
and you told me come come close  
look at the sun setting into the sea  
and you told me come come close  
the millimeter between them both  
holds all of the dreams in the world  
  
in the kilometer between me and you  
no flowers bloom  
and a cold white light fills the room  
  
a speedometer with broken arms  
cannot supply  
the numbers that I need to fly  
  
and you told me come come close  
look at the sun setting into the sea  
and you told me come come close  
the millimeter between them both  
holds all of the dreams in the world  
  
in the millimeter between pen and page  
nothings new  
the same old soul Ive had for years  
I give to you  
  
the millimeter bove the brow  
cannot hide  
the vast and hollow space  
inside
