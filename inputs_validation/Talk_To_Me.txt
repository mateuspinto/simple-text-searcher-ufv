Close the door turn out the light  
Theres something really wrong tonight with you  
Me and you  
  
You say youre too young to love  
And too old to hate  
Remote control keeps you awake  
So turn me on  
  
Maybe you could talk and make my day  
You dont have to walk away to  
Stay with me  
Make me change  
Answer me  
Break the chain  
  
News at Ten Eastenders and another cup of tea  
And then I fight  
Baby not tonight  
  
Cause Im not dressed to be a clown  
Im not in the mood for shouting out  
Talk to me  
Break the chain  
Talk to me  
Make me change  
  
Do you keep your lover out of sight  
Cause you smell like someone else tonight  
All right all right  
  
Talk to me  
Break the chain  
Talk to me  
Make me change  
  
Answer me  
Answer me  
Answer me  
Answer me
