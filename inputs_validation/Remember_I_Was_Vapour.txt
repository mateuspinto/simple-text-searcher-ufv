Chorus  
Theres nothing here but us  
Theres nothing here but us  
  
Remember I was vapor  
Remember I was just like you  
Remember I was liquid  
Remember I was someone too  
  
Remember I need others  
Remember I need oxygen  
Remember I need lovers  
Remember I need to forget  
  
Chorus  
  
Remember I am human  
Remember I feel just like you  
Remember I had reasons  
Remember I had friends like you  
  
Remember I grow tired  
Remember I could end all this  
Remember I have memories  
Remember I need to forget  
  
Chorus
