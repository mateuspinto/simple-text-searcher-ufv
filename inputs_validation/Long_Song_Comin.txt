Politician bout to make his speech  
Signal for attention please  
Then he shuffled his notes  
And wiped his sweating brow  
I looked at my friend next to me  
And we dont dare agree  
Before this is over  
Well wish we woulda left right now  
Cause it sounds like a long song comin  
And it looks like he might throw in a little dancin too  
Yes it sounds like a long song comin  
And buddy listen buddy  
We got better things to listen to  
Lady from a church bizarre  
Was smiling from her head to her feet  
All the way down to her feet  
That she couldnt see  
She started speeking her piece  
I said Stop Wait a minute please  
Before you start talkin  
I wish youd please listen to me  
Cause it sounds like a long song comin  
And though some of the things you say might be true  
It still sounds like a long song comin  
And baby listen lady I got better things to listen to  
Yes it sounds like a long song comin  
And it looks like you might throw in a little dancin too  
Yes it sounds like a long song comin  
And buddy listen buddy I got better things to listen to  
Say so it sounds like a long song comin  
And it sounds like some just might be true  
Still it sounds like a long song comin  
And buddy listen buddy I got better things to listen to  
And buddy listen buddy we got better things to listen to
