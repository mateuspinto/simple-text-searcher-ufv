Who are you now  
First love of mine  
If you could see  
Youd reach out for me  
  
In hallways  
And in secret doorways  
Were loves hiding places  
With nowhere to go  
Goodbye  
To the fields and byways  
I remember saying  
I dont want to leave  
Cos you were all there was to know  
About me  
  
Somewhere  
On this crazy island  
A familiar stranger  
Sleeps so far away  
Wonder in the eyes of children  
And the smile of fortune  
Helps the memory fade  
Cos they are all there is to know  
About me  
  
Who are you now
