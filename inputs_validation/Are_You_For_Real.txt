Are you for real  
Are you for real  
Hey you are you feeling like me too  
I need to get an answer out of you well  
All the days  
All the time  
All the lies lie on the line  
Did you just try to set me off well  
Yeah ya know Im easy  
And I know its true  
That this situation  
Isnt so easy on you  
Cause I  
I need to know what you want I  
I wonder how you feel and I  
I need to know what you want  
I can not guess anymore  
Are you for real

Hey you Is there truth behind your lies  
Is all this love  
Or is it compromise well  
All the days  
All the time  
No regrets youre on my mind  
Did you just try to set me off well  
Yeah this awkward silence  
Feels so cold and used  
Is this infatuation  
Or am I addicted to you  
Cause I  
I need to know what you want I  
I wonder how you feel and I  
I need to know what you want  
I can not guess anymore  
Are you for real  
Rererereverse the beat  
Back up direction  
Tries and trust and planned out deception  
The look in your eyes  
Verbal dissection  
Lose myself in you  
And then sex then rejection  
Self destruct in you arms  
As your words stacks kill  
Are you for real  
Are you for real  
Are you for real  
Hey you are you feeling lonely too
