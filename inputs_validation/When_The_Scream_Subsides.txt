And we talked Just the two of us  
All the time Nothing serious  
We pretend Time is on our side  
Til the end When the scream subsides  
  
Yes we had it all had the key gripped in our hands  
We could see the fall as a martyr understands  
When the chorus calls theres no room for hope inside  
Lose it all when the scream subsides  
  
And we talked Just the two of us  
All the time Nothing serious  
We pretend Time is on our side  
Til the end When the scream subsides  
  
Yes we took the role of the lovers and the friends  
And we played the parts til the words came to an end  
But the tongues were tied in the passion and the pride  
Wasted all when the scream subsides  
  
And we talked Just the two of us  
All the time Nothing serious  
We pretend Time is on our side  
Til the end When the scream subsides
