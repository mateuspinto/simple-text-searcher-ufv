In cape clear  
I saw a little girl crying  
She said she lost her teddy bear  
Oh then I can get you another one  
No no no no no no  
It was it was my teddy bear  
  
As we were talking  
A cloud passed and cast a pool of light around her  
I saw that she was not a little girl oh  
No no no no no no  
But you are but you are  
  
All my life I felt like I was in the middle of an ocean  
Unable to touch the horizon  
All my life I was floating on my emotion  
Not knowing life had its own motion  
  
In cape clear  
I saw a little girl crying
