When a boy like me meets a girl like you  
Then I must believe wishes come true  
I just look at you and I touch your hand  
And this ordinary world becomes a wonderland  
  
There are many girls I have met before  
But I pass them by because I knew  
There would be this magic moment  
One to last a lifetime through  
When a boy like me meets a girl like you  
  
When a boy like me meets a girl like you
