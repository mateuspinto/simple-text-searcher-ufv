If you tuned in correctly this morning  
Kissed his cheek get your tea and your toast in  
Got the greatest of the latest Top Thirty  
To clear your mind of all things unfaithful or dirty  
What do you like to hear with your soldiers  
The sponsor needs to know what you told us  
Got a chorus written for us straight from the file  
Just check your brain into the AM dial  
Waking up is easy when youve got a voice you know  
Rattling up the ratings on the breakfast show  
Waking up is easy when youve got a throat you love  
Telling you whats out there  
Is anyone out there  
Is anyone out there  
Is anyone out there  
If you dont like the nest that youve made  
We got a competition running you can leave today  
Pack your bags clean your ears of the city  
We got a place where even your car looks pretty  
Waking up is easy when you got a host you know  
Rattling up the ratings on the breakfast show  
Waking up is easy when you got a throat you love  
Telling you whats out there  
Is anyone out there  
Is anyone out there  
Is anyone out there  
Good morning ladies do you need a man  
Put your trust in our thirtiesandover plan  
Trust me  
Waking up is easy when youve got a voice you know  
Rattling up the ratings on the breakfast show  
Waking up is easy when youve got a throat you love  
Telling you whats out there  
Is anyone out there
