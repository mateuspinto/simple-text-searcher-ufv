Intro cool Keith  
Yeah yo Don gimme a little bit of that chicken  
That smooth chicken a little bit of that gravy  
And I want some old hot jazz biscuits  
With a little bit of that blues butter  
Bring in the snare  
  
Verse One cool Keith  
They never understood many people were so slow  
My funky type of rhyme and my style is pyscho  
Complex wrecks wrecks my style go X X  
I move around off beat creatin more styles  
Showin white boys other kids my black styles  
I kick lyrics like shoes right in your face  
Walk up on a carJack of Spades pluck the ace  
I get slower down in on in  
Flowin like I used to be on Critical Beatdown  
I drop styles on ears the public bite em  
Not many went to school so the dummies wouldnt write em  
They say yo Keith yo cool you usin big words  
I went to college Im even more stupid herb  
Back on the scene to put a lesson out  
Even if I have to pull a black Smith and Wesson out  
I grab a hammer stick a nail in that little crack  
Tame the monkey show the hummingbird how to act  
I get atomic hypogalactical  
Word to mom Im in my own world  
Galaxy raised Powerful  
  
Chorus  
Raise it up 8X  
Verse Two Ced G  
Yo yo money grip money grip now this aint no ego trip  
Yo money grip money grip now this aint no ego trip  
Now back in the days and we used to use elevation  
And then the people said
