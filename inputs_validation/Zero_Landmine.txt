This Is My Home  
The Land Of My Mother  
The Place I Play  
With Sisters And Brothers  
The Trees Are Rooted  
In The Ground Beneath  
Take Away The Violence  
Give The Earth Back Its Peace  
  
This Is Our World  
Our Common Salvation  
It Knows No Borders  
It Serves No Nation  
The Same Sun Shines Equally  
On Those Beneath  
Take Away The Violence  
Give The Earth Back Its Peace  
  
Theres Fire In The Ground  
In The Space Between The Trees  
In The Forests and Fields  
On Pathways In Dreams  
  
The Stars Are Whispering  
To The Ground Beneath  
Take Away The Darkness  
Give The Earth Back Its Peace  
  
Who Painted The Green Grass Red  
With Danger  
Who Coloured The Big Sky Blue  
With Sorrow  
A Strong Wind Carrying Fear  
And Anger  
Came And Went And Stole Tomorrow  
  
This Is My Home  
The Land Of My Mother  
The Place I Play  
With Sisters And Brothers  
The Trees Are Rooted  
In the Ground Beneath  
Take Away The Violence  
Give the Earth Back Its Peace  
  
The Same Sun Shines Equally  
On Those Beneath  
Take Away The Darkness  
Give The Earth Back Its Peace  
  
Like Trees Were Rooted  
In the Ground Beneath  
Take Away the Violence  
Give the Earth Back Its Peace  
  
Give The Earth Back Its Peace
