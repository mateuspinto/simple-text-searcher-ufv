Any old time you want me  
I am yours for the asking darling  
Any old time you need me  
Ill be their with love thats lasting darling  
All through the years well stand together  
Sharing the tears and stormy weather  
And the sunshine will be yours and mine  
Any old time your blue  
Youll have our love to chase away the blues  
And any old thing you do ill see you through  
So just remember that I am waiting dear  
If ever you want me ill be near  
Any old time and any place you may be
