Turn my mic up louder  
I got to say something  
Lightweights stepping aside  
When we come in  
Feel it in your chest  
The syllables get pumping  
People on the street  
They panic and start running  
Words on loose leaf  
Sheet complete coming  
I jump on my mind  
I summon the rhyme Im dumping  
Healing the blind  
I promise to let the sun in  
Sick of the dark ways  
We march to the drumming  
Jump when they tell us  
They want to see jumping  
Fuck that I want to  
See some fist pumping  
Risk something  
Take back whats yours  
Say something that you know  
They might attack you for  
Cause Im sick of being treated  
Like I had before  
Like its stupid standing for  
What Im standing for  
Like this war is really just  
A different brand of war  
Like it doesnt cater the rich  
And an abandon the poor  
Like they understand you  
In the back of the jet  
When you cant put gas in your tank  
These fuckers are laughing their way  
To the bank and cashing their check  
Asking you to have compassion and to have some respect  
  
For a leader so nervous  
In an obvious way  
Stuttering and mumbling  
For nightly news to replay  
And the rest of the world  
Watching at the end of the day  
In the living room laughing  
Like what did he say  
  
Amen amen amen amen amen  
  
In my living room watching  
But I am not laughing  
Cause when it gets tense  
I know what might happen  
The world is cold  
The bold men take action  
Have to react  
Or get blown into fractions  
Ten years old is something to see  
Another kid my age drugged under a jeep  
Taken and bound and found later under a tree  
I wonder if he thought the next one could be me  
Do you see  
The soldiers theyre out today  
That brush the dust from bulletproof vests away  
Its ironic  
At times like this you pray  
But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday  
Theres bombs in the buses bikes roads  
Inside your markets your shops your clothes  
My dad hes got a lot of fear I know  
But enough pride inside not to let that show  
My brother had a book he would hold with pride  
A little red cover with a broken spine  
In the back he hand wrote a quote inside  
When the rich wage war its the poor who die  
  
Meanwhile the leader just talks away  
Stuttering and mumbling  
For nightly news to replay  
And the rest of the world  
Watching at the end of the day  
Both scared and angry  
Like what did he say  
  
Amen amen amen amen amen  
  
With hands held high  
Into a sky so blue  
As the ocean opens up  
To swallow you  
  
With hands held high  
Into a sky so blue  
The ocean opens up  
To swallow you  
  
With hands held high  
Into a sky so blue  
The ocean opens up  
To swallow you  
  
With hands held high  
Into a sky so blue  
The ocean opens up  
To swallow you  
  
With hands held high  
Into a sky so blue  
The ocean opens up  
To swallow you  
  
With hands held high  
Into a sky so blue  
The ocean opens up  
To swallow you
