Chorus  
All I ever wanted to do was live the life  
Money drugs cars clothes hoes  
Brick paints pounds of dro fa sho  
A young nigga living how he supposed ya know  
  
I got sixteen 28 grams broke down to dimes  
Whats my life like nigga its a constant grind  
You got seven eight or nine you can push on  
Cause Im a selfish nigga I want 10 strong  
Oh no it happened again  
Let me get a good flow of that dro again  
Got phone blowin up like a high school bell  
Plus the price sky rocket like dope in jail  
Break it down in small portions fuck sellin a O  
Youd rather make seven or eight or cock bound for da 4  
Im a hustla far from being a busta nigga  
You got good game but still dont trust ya nigga  
You can catch me in the neighborhood winter or summer  
Spring or fall cause nigga I be selling it all  
From junts to blunts blunts to bags and bags to Os  
Os to pounds Im just holding it down  
  
Chorus x2  
  
I got 36 ounces blocked up pure yola  
Make it times 2 once I hit it with the soda  
Whip it up good in a beacon and a blender  
Have it rock hard plus white as December  
I switch up my raps yo I never go the same way  
Plus I get a different prepaid every 30 days  
So if I get jam I know where it came from  
Rub my shit suitable never serve unusual  
All money aint good and all money aint fine  
Some money come with blood and some money come with time  
Some money cant spend and some money aint safe  
Money in the wrong way Ill lead you to the wrong place  
  
Chorus x2  
  
I got 8 or 9 paints and a bottle of kay row  
And I wouldnt give a fuck if you nod or stay woke  
I just got back from the N Y C 250 a paint  
Back in Memphis Tenn with drank  
50 a ounce after I done added the bounce  
45 get the nine and every dollar gone count  
Im a hustla dont make me say it again  
I aint trying to please a nigga Im trying to stack some ends  
The strong survive while the weak slowly dying  
Im congruent to them boys Im out there slanging them pies  
They never stop trying they never give up they gotta succeed  
My life is like the saying nigga crack speed or weed  
  
Chorus
