Imagine a man  
Not a child of any revolt  
But a plain man tied up in life  
  
Imagine the sand  
Running out as he struts  
Parading and fading ignoring his wife  
  
Imagine a road  
So long looking backwards  
You cant see where it really began  
  
Imagine a load  
So large and so smooth  
That against it a man is an ant  
  
Then you will see the end  
You will see the end  
  
Imagine events  
That occur everyday  
Like a shooting or raping or a simple act of deceit  
  
Imagine a fence  
Around you as high as prevention  
Casting shadows you cant see your feet  
  
Imagine a girl  
You long for and have  
And the body of chalky perfection and truth  
  
Imagine a past  
Where you wish you had lived  
Full of heroes and villains and fools  
  
And you will see the end  
You will see the end  
And you will see the end  
You will see the end  
Oh yeah  
  
Imagine a man  
Not a child of any revolt  
But a man of today feeling new  
  
Imagine a soul  
So old it it is broken  
And you will know your invention is you  
  
And you will see the end  
You will see the end  
You will see the end  
You will see the end  
Oh yeah
