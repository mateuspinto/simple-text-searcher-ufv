Five foot two eyes of blue  
But oh what those five foot could do  
Has anyone seen my gal  
  
Turned up nose and turned down hose  
Never had another beau  
Has anyone seen my gal  
  
Now if you run into five foot two covered with fur  
Diamond ring and all those things  
Bet your life it isnt hers  
Could she love Could she woo  
Could she love Could she coo  
Has anyone seen my gal  
  
Five foot two eyes of blue  
But oh what those five foot could do  
Has anyone seen my gal  
Now if you run into five foot two covered with fur  
Diamond ring and all those things  
Bet your life that it wasnt her  
  
Could she loving Could she coo  
Could she Could she woo  
Has anyone seen my gal
