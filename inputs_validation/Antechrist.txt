I bear the soul of Satan  
I wear the seal of death  
I hold the keys to destiny  
Steal your dying breath  
Your breath  
Your breath  
Your breath  
Staring death in the face  
King of inhuman race  
Lightning sets the pace  
Antechrist  
There is no sweet salvation  
Your soul belongs to me  
A screaming pain for redemption  
My angels watch you bleed  
You bleed  
You bleed  
You bleed  
We sell you pain and anger  
And thrive on sex and lies  
I summon storms to please me  
And you beg to the skies  
The skies  
The skies  
The skies
