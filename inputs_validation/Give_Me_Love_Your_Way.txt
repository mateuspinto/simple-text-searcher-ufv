Got every reason to feel like I do  
From the top of my head to the bottom of my shoes  
Cause last night my baby took the weight off my mind  
Told me everything was gonna be fine  
She said she loved me  
Im never gonna be without the love she promised to give me  
Cause she says every night hold me tight forever is right  
Love is bright moon delight shes outta sight  
Give me give me give me love your way  
She could have resisted my efforts to pry  
But she knows how I feel and shes not exactly shy  
Though right now Im lonely I know it wont be long  
I can hear the train comin bringin lovin along  
She said she loved me  
Im never gonna be without the love she promised to give me  
Cause she says every night hold me tight forever is right  
Love is bright moon delight shes outta sight  
Give me give me give me love your way  
Oh I used to be so lost and confused  
I stumbled through knowing that each door I tried  
Was closed before me and knowing that I cried  
But still I didnt rest I had to know  
What was behind it all Id come so far  
And then I saw her note I couldnt believe she wrote  
I couldnt resist it being beside her  
Could have held that moment forever in my heart  
The moment I saw her was the moment I knew  
That her love is my life and her lights shining through  
She said she loved me  
Im never gonna be without the love she promised to give me  
Cause she says every night hold me tight forever is right  
Love is bright moon delight shes outta sight  
Give me give me give me love your way  
Oh I used to be so lost and confused  
I stumbled through knowing that each door I tried  
Was closed before me and knowing that I cried  
But still I didnt rest I had to know  
What was behind it all Id come so far  
And then I saw her note I couldnt believe she wrote
