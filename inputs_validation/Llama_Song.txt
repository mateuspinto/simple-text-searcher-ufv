Heres a llama  
Theres a llama  
And another little llama  
Fuzzy Llama  
Funny Llama  
Llama Llama duck  
  
Llama llama  
Cheesecake llama  
Tablet brick potato llama  
Llama llama mushroom llama  
Llama llama duck  
  
I was once a tree house  
I lived in a cake  
But I never saw the way  
The orange slayed the rake  
I was only three years dead  
But it told a tale  
And now listen little child  
To the safety rail  
  
Did you ever see a llama  
Kiss a llama  
On the llama  
Llamas llama  
Tastes of llama  
Llama llama duck  
  
Half a llama  
Twice a llama  
Not a llama  
Farmer llama  
Llama in a car  
Alarm a llama  
Llama duck  
  
Is that how its told now  
Is it all so old  
Is it made of lemon juice  
Doorknob ankle cold  
Now my song is getting thin  
Ive run out of luck  
Time for me to retire now  
And become a duck x6
