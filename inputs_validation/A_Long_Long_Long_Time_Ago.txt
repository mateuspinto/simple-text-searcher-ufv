Yesterday arrived too quickly  
Caught me right off guard  
My defense moved in too slowly  
Missed it by a yard  
Id just settled down  
With a bottle of gin  
So I moved on to whiskey  
And it hit me again  
Memories were raining punches  
Down on my head  
Knocked me into the past so quickly  
They almost raised the dead  
So I drank some more booze  
And it helped me to sleep  
Where I dreamed of my youth  
And the secrets I keep  
  
Oh history is a friend of mine  
She comes over to my place  
And we have a good time  
But the memories  
She sometimes brings with her  
Get out of line  
Theyre out of line  
  
Show me things I dont want to see  
Wanna see want to see wanna see  
Remind me of who I thought I was gonna be  
Ganna be gonna be gonna be  
Take me places I used to go  
Used to go used to go  
A long long time ago  
  
When I woke I remembered nothing  
Suppose thats just as well  
And although my head was aching  
I could hear a bell  
So I put on some clothes  
And I reached my front door  
When I pulled it wide open  
She joined me once more  
  
Oh history is a friend of mine  
She comes over to my place  
And we have a good time  
But the memories  
She sometimes brings with her  
Get out of line  
Theyre out of line  
  
Show me things I dont want to see  
Wanna see want to see want to see  
Remind me of who I thought I was gonna be  
Ganna be gonna be gonna be  
Take me places I used to go  
Used to go used to go  
A long long time ago  
A long long time ago
