Four hundred years back in this time  
Seven Doors Hotel  
A massacre took place and a young man died  
Opened one gate to Hell  
The Eibon is open use your eyes  
To read and learn  
In the end it could be your turn  
  
1981 traces were found  
That could not exist in ones mind  
A woman could lead you totally deceive you  
Without your knowing shes blind  
  
Seven Doors Hotel  
One of seven gates to Hell  
Seven Doors Hotel  
One of seven gates to Hell  
  
Do always watch out for things  
That you see but dont understand  
The Devil is there always somewhere  
Ready to command
