Look across the world  
And let us shine for you Lord  
The whole world is yours  
And I want to live for you  
  
One thing I know  
Is that youve changed my life  
I give you my all  
All you are is good  
Give you my heart  
God its only you I seek  
Give you my praise  
Cause I believe in you  
  
Look across the world  
And let us shine for you Lord  
The whole world is yours  
And I want to live for you O God  
  
All that I know  
Is that youve changed my life  
I give you my all  
And all you are is good  
Carry the lost  
Make my prayer in this life real  
Carry my cross  
Hold on til I see you  
  
Look across the world  
And let us shine for you Lord  
The whole world is yours  
And I want to live for you O God  
  
And I want to live  
I want to love you more  
I want to be used  
Father in all of the world  
May your word be heard  
May it stay on my lips  
Live what I speak  
Until your kingdom come  
Look across the world  
And let us shine for you  
And let us shine for you  
Look across the world  
And let us shine for you Lord  
The whole world is yours  
And I want to live for you  
Look across the world  
And let us shine for you Lord  
The whole world is yours  
And I want to live for you  
And I want to live for you  
And I want to live for you
