Clenched fist  Hot blooded  
Make no mistake  
These eyes have seen what drives the blind  
I need a Cutman to bleed these angry eyes  
Hallowed are those  
They pay no price  
Ruins abound  These pawns of sacrifice  
Bleed away  
I recognize where the allegiance lies  
Its cut in stone  
Now bleed these angry eyes  
Cut in stone  Bleed  Bleed away  
Trampled are those  
Theyll face our hell  
Ruins come round  These pawns will turn the tide  
Bleed away  
I recognize where the allegiance lies  
Its cut in stone  
Now bleed these angry eyes  
Clenched fist  Hot blooded  
Make no mistake  
These eyes have seen what drives the blind  
I need a Cutman to bleed these angry eyes
