You made the sun  
You made the moon  
Gave seasons change  
Woah  
You made the clouds  
You put the rainbow after rain  
Woah  
Created time  
Now this ones mine  
Gave pictures frames  
Woah  
Created man gave him woman  
Why did you do that for me  
  
These are the questions asked before I lay me down and go to sleep ooh
sometimes I wonder  
Sometimes I wonder why you decided to keep you hands on me  
Of all the miracles signs and wonders  
Theres still one mystery  
How did you manage to love me  
  
You breathed the life right into me  
Then made my heart beat  
Woah  
Created the mountains  
And all of the deep seas  
Flowers in the trees  
Woah  
You made tommorrow come again  
You calmed the strong winds  
Woah  
And after all Ive done  
Gave me a son  
Tell me why would you do that for me  
  
These are the questions asked before I lay me down and go to sleep  
Right in the middle of my prayers  
Sometimes I wonder why you decided to keep you hands on me  
Of all the miracles signs and wonders  
Theres still one mystery  
How did you manage to love me how did you manage that  
How did you manage to love me  
  
Said Ive got to know how how did you manage to love  
After all that I have done oh Lord  
How how did you manage to love  
How could I have been so bad oh Lord  
How how did you manage to forgive me  
Even when I didnt believe in me you believed in me Lord  
How how did you manage to forgive me  
Jesus you sacrificed your dear life for me  
How did you manage to forgive me  
Ooooh Lord tell me why did the pain uprise for me
