One One perfect lie  
Was it told too soon  
And one one perfect life  
Turned to stone  
Cold mercy  
  
I kneel down by your grave  
I kneel down torn and guilty  
  
Did I let you down  
Say goodbye too soon  
And did you understand  
My mistake  
Forgive me  
  
I kneel down by your side  
I kneel down scared and helpless  
  
One perfect lie  
Wrapped in kindness and tears  
I wish I believed in your heaven  
One perfect life  
Led by blind faith and trust  
If God has a heart he will find you  
  
Im torn and guilty  
Im torn and guilty  
Im torn and guilty
