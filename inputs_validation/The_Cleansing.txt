Cool muthafucka in a deep blue sea  
I said I loose my mind  
Cool muthafucka in through what I see  
I said that I dont mind  
  
He said walk on through we been waitin for you  
Theres a place set at the table  
Welcome home is where the heart is  
And since ya been gone my hearts been broke in two  
  
Your return among the strangest see  
Your lifes gone through some changes  
Dont recognize you  
Dont dont dont dont dont recognize  
  
Down home to the cool cool water  
Down home to the cleansing water  
  
Cool muthafucka said I know your name  
But do ya know your god  
Cool muthafucka said I had your pain  
Ya then I blew my wad  
  
My god made love and my god made pain  
I feel at home among the insane  
I see sunshine in the pourin rain  
Welcome home oh yes I recognize you  
  
See ya been rearranged to suit  
And you know well never change  
What they put ya through  
What they put what they put what they put ya  
  
Move it to the right now  
  
Jesus cleanse me can you hear him  
Jesus cleanse me now
