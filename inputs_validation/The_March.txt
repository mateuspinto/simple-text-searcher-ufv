This moment  
One moment  
A time to face hate horror  
A clash  
Great clash  
The two worlds collide  
The power  
Vast power  
Each side drives its armies  
The solace  
No solace  
This is what weve become  
  
The past thou shalt never cross  
Things here will never be the same  
All bear witness to the gathering of the march  
  
This is what weve become  
No solace  
  
This truth  
One truth  
The underlying reason  
One hope  
All hope  
The strength of mankind risen  
Our kind  
Their kind  
Once one  
Now shattered  
Unite  
Unite  
We hold the key to tomorrow  
  
The past thou shalt never cross  
Things here will never be the same  
All bear witness to the gathering of the march  
  
Bring them down  
Take it back
