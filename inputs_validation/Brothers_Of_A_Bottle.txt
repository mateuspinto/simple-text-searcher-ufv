Bartender come over here  
I want to buy the next round of beer  
Boys name your poison dont nobody pass  
Were all brother of a bottle an glass  
  
The happiest moment that Ive ever known  
Was the day that she told me she would be my own  
But the bluest moment that ever could be  
When she said she loved someone much better than me  
  
Bartender come over here  
I want to buy the next round of beer  
Boys name your poison dont nobody pass  
Were all brother of a bottle an glass  
  
Well I once had a buddy as fine as could be  
We trusted each other completely you see  
Well then I betrayed him just like any wretch  
No one but a woman could make you do that  
  
Bartender come over here  
I want to buy the next round of beer  
Boys name your poison dont nobody pass  
Were all brother of a bottle an glass  
  
When God made man I guess this made him sad  
For now theyre all good and none are all bad  
Then he made woman to cheat and deceive  
Theres been hell ever since the snake tempted Eve  
  
Bartender come over here  
I want to buy the next round of beer  
Boys name your poison dont nobody pass  
Were all brother of a bottle an glass
