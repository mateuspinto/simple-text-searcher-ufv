Snow in springtime storm in the sea  
Mist at my window no leaf on my tree  
Showers in the garden with no flowers to touch  
When will you bring us your sunshine and such  
  
Season tell me true  
Whats been wrong with you  
Wont you turn again  
Blow away the rain  
Blue season turn away  
  
Wind in the evening dust in your eye  
Heart full of shadow and cloud in your sky  
Everythings wrong and you know youre to blame  
Nothing will change while youre still the same  
Cold in the city tears on the street  
Faces are empty in those that you meet  
Lovers and losers who fail in the night  
When will it be that youll treat them right  
  
Season tell me true  
How much do we need you  
Wont you turn your wheel  
Hide your heart of steel  
Blue season turn away  
  
Countries and people caught in the rain  
When will they learn to feel fine again  
Wandering lost now for nothing is clear  
Waiting for signs of the turn of the year  
  
Season tell me true  
Whats been wrong with you  
Wont you turn again  
Blow away in the rain  
Blue season turn away
