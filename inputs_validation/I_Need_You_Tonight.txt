Open up your heart to me  
And say whats on your mind oh yes  
I know that we have been through so much pain  
But I still need you in my life this time and  
  
Chorus  
I need you tonight  
I need you right now  
I know deep within my heart  
It doesnt matter if its wrong or right  
I really need you tonight  
  
I figured out what to say to you  
But sometimes the words they they come out so wrong oh yes they do  
And I know in time that you will understand  
That what we have is so right this time and  
  
Chorus  
  
All those endless times we tried to make it last forever more  
And baby I know  
I need you  
I know deep within my heart  
It doesnt matter if its wrong or right  
I really need you oh  
  
Chorus  
  
All I know is baby  
I really need you tonight
