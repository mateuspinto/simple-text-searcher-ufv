Anna  
You come and ask me girl  
To set you free girl  
You say he loves you more than me  
So I will set you free  
Go with him  
Go with him  
  
Chorus  
Anna  
Girl before you go now  
I want you to know now  
That I still love you so  
But if he loves you mo  
Go with him  
  
All of my life  
Ive been searchin for a girl  
To love me like I love you  
Oh now but every girl Ive ever had  
Breaks my heart and leaves me sad  
What am I what am I supposed to do  
  
Anna  
Just one more thing girl  
You give back your ring to me and I will set you free  
Go with him  
  
Chorus  
  
All of my life  
Ive been searchin for a girl  
To love me like I love you  
Oh now but every girl Ive ever had  
Breaks my heart and leaves me sad  
What am I what am I supposed to do
