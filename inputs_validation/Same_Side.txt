It doesnt matter who you are  
Or what youre gonna be  
People from all walks of life  
You gotta have diversity  
Were all in this together  
And together we shall be  
You gotta be a friendly neighbor  
If youre gonna live next to me  
Were all  
  
Livin on the same side  
Same side of town  
Walkin down the same streets  
The streets that are all around  
  
You could be my brother  
Or you could be my friend  
But dont turn your back on me  
Cause well be here til the end  
Yeah were all in this together  
And we all have that dream  
To live in perfect harmony  
Like a family thats the scene  
Yeah were all  
  
Livin on the same side  
Same side of town  
Walkin down the same streets  
The Streets that are all around  
Livin on the same side  
Same side of town  
Shufflin to the same beat  
The beat thats all around  
  
Stumblin down on DP keggers all around  
Laughin at the police as they try to take us down  
Hangin with each other yeah hangin with our bros  
We all love one another from our heads down to our toes
