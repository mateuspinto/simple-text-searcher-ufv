Well I used to sit at home and wonder why why why  
All the happiness in life just passed me by  
I didnt think in all the world there could ever be  
One girl in a million who was meant for me  
  
Then along came you walkin down the street  
Then along came you you knocked me off my feet  
I never thought Id find a girl that ever would be true  
Somewhere outta nowhere along came you  
  
I had just about forgotten how to smile  
You could see my misery for a country mile  
Used to being lonely surrendered to the blue  
Then somehow outta nowhere along came you  
  
Then along came you walkin down the street  
Then along came you you knocked me off my feet  
I never thought Id find a girl that ever would be true  
Somewhere outta nowhere along came you  
  
Then along came you walkin down the street  
Then along came you you knocked me off my feet  
I never thought Id find a girl that ever would be true  
Somewhere outta nowhere along came you
