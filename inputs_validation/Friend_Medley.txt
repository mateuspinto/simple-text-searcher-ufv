There will never be a friend as dear to me  
There will never be a friend as dear to me  
There will never be a friend as dear to me as You  
  
I worship You in spirit and in truth

Theres not a friend like the lowly Jesus  
No no no no no not one  
No no not one  
  
Theres not an hour that He is He is not near us  
No no not one  
O no no not one  
  
Jesus knows  
He knows all about our trouble  
And He will guide till the day  
The day is done

O what peace we often forfeit  
O what needless pain we bear  
All because we do not carry  
All we gotta do is carry  
Everything to God in prayer  
  
What a friend we have in Jesus  
All our sins and griefs to bear  
What a privilege to carry  
Everything to God in prayer  
Everything to God in prayer  
Everything to God in prayer  
  
Everytime You call me I receive Your healing  
Everytime You call me friend  
I receive Your healing
