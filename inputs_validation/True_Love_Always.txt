Just you know why  
Why you and I  
Will by and by know true love ways  
Sometimes well sigh  
Sometimes well cry  
And well know why  
Just you and I  
Know true love ways  
Throughout the days  
Our true love ways  
Will bring us joys to share  
With those who really care  
Sometimes well sigh  
Sometimes well cry  
And well know why  
Just you and I  
Know true love ways  
Throughout the days  
Our true love ways  
Will bring us joys to share  
With those who really care  
Sometimes well sigh  
Sometimes well cry  
And well know why  
Just you and I  
Know true love ways
