Your life is leaning downhill  
Sloping off the outer edge  
Your undetermined oyster beds  
Were found to be a hedge  
You caused the kids of Elmer Fudd  
To feed the farmer whose  
Cadavers filled with onion rings  
And feet are filled with glue  
Now sinister exaggerator  
Whats your claim to fame  
Is still your favorite Ferlinghetti  
Found in Auntie Maim  
Your alter life is superseded  
Only from above  
Your heart is like a silken sponge  
That calls saliva love
