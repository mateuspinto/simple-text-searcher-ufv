Suckin on a screw down  
Lie lappin break down  
Kissin up the boy while the church burns down  
Makin up to God  
Makin up your bed  
Lyin up the God playin dead  
  
I see the fizzle where the bombs fell on the beach  
Tell me why the truth is whats stuck between your teeth  
  
No ones leaving till I say so  
Hold that breathin This much I know  
  
I know where it hurts  
  
Open up the flood gates  
Open up the seven gates  
Open up the door hear the church burns down  
Streakin like a comet  
Chokin on yer vomit  
One more roll play dead  
Lord I feel the pressure comin down upon my head  
Lord tell me why the truth is sometimes better dead  
  
Hit the streets hit the wall  
Hit the sheets have a ball  
In the mouth in the face  
In the teeth take a taste  
Hit me where it hurts  
Come on and hit me where it hurts  
  
Make em pay make a stand  
Break away be a man  
Who ya be who ya are  
Where ya live what ya are  
Hit you where it hurts  
Gonna hit you where it hurts  
  
Playin dead dead dead  
  
No one leaving till I say so  
No more reason this much I know  
  
Where it hurts
