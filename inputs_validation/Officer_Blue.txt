Officer Blue  
Really love the things you do  
Even when I was just eight years old eight years old  
Officer Blue  
Is it true what they say  
That when you work youre still at play still at play  
Oh Officer Blue  
I really love the things you do  
Its magical  
People in a human zoo  
Officer Blue  
Cast a shadow on the wall  
But by torchlight even mice look tall they dont fall  
Officer Blue  
In a blaze of human form  
And your stripes and badges to conform you conform  
Officer Blue  
Really love the things you do  
Even when I was just eight years old eight years old  
Officer Blue  
Is it true what they say  
That when you work youre still at play still you play
