Come all ye maids that live at a distance  
Many a miles from off your swain  
Come and assist me this very moment  
For to pass away some time  
Singing sweetly and completely  
Songs of pleasure and of love  
For my heart is with them all together  
Though I live not where I love  
  
When I sleep I dream about you  
When I wake I find no rest  
For every moment thinking of you  
My heart affixed in your breast  
Although far distance may be assistance  
From my mind his love to remove  
Yet my heart is with him all together  
Though I live not where I love  
  
All the world shall be one religion  
Living things shall cease to die  
If ever I prove false to my jewel  
Or any way my love deny  
The world shall change and be most strange  
If ever I my mind remove  
For my heart is with him all together  
Though I live not where I love  
  
So farewell lads and farewell lasses  
Now I think Ive got my choice  
I will away to yonder mountain  
Where I think I hear his voice  
And if he calls then I will follow  
Though the world it is so wide  
For my heart is with him all together  
Thought I live not where I love
