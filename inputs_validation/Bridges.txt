All the bridges that you burn  
Come back one day to haunt you  
One day youll find youre walking lonely  
  
Baby I never meant to hurt you  
Sometimes the best intentions  
Still dont make things right  
  
But all my ghosts they find me  
Like my past they think they own me  
In dreams and dark corners they surround me  
Till I cry I cry  
  
Let me take this time to set the record straight  
Let me take this time to take it all back  
Let me take this time to tell you how I felt  
Let me take this time to try and make it right  
  
But you can walk away  
Be all alone  
Spend all your time  
Thinking about the way things used to be  
If love feels right  
You work it out  
You dont give it up  
Baby  
  
Anybody tell you that  
Anybody tell you that  
Anybody tell you that  
  
You should take some time maybe sleep on it tonight  
You should take some time baby heed the words I said  
You should take some time think about your life  
You should take some time before you throw it all away  
  
I aint got the time  
To sit here and wait around  
But I got the time  
If you say Im what you want
