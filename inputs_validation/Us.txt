The world is always changing  
You can see it everyday  
But in a tragic situation  
You just cant hide yourself away  
So try a little kindness  
Cause it shouldnt be that hard  
Youre shining in the darkness  
When you open up your heart  
  
Your love is all we need  
To bring us together  
Dont leave it to me nothings for free  
It comes down to us  
  
Hungry babies on television  
Can you feel the shame  
Youve gotta keep on giving to one another  
Cos its all gonna happen again  
Why dont you try a little kindness  
Cause it shouldnt be that hard  
Just think about what binds us  
And find a new place to start  
  
Your love is all we need  
To bring us together  
Dont you leave it to me  
Nothings for free  
It comes down to us  
  
Your love is all we need  
To bring us together  
Were not indestructible  
Some kind of miracle  
Happens every day  
  
Your love is all we need  
To bring us together  
Dont leave it to me  
Nothings for free  
  
Your love is all we need  
To bring us together  
Were not indestructible  
Some kind of miracle  
Happens every day  
Oh it comes down to us  
It comes down to us  
We all have to stop stop  
Stop pretending now  
It comes down to us
