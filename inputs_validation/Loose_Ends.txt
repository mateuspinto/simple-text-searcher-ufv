Climbing a mountain  
In darkness  
Stranded alone on the ledge  
Every attempt that I make to hold on  
Pushes me nearer the edge  
  
Sensing the changes impending  
My thoughts are diffused by despair  
I feel like Im swimming straight up  
Underwater  
Desperately racing for air  
Im racing for air  
  
And the chords struck at birth  
Grow more distant  
Yet we strike them again and again  
And we plead and we pray  
For a glimmer of day  
As the night folds its wings  
And descends  
Exposing the loose ends  
  
Surrounding myself with possessions  
I surely have more than I need  
I dont know if this is justice hard earned  
Or simply a matter of greed  
A matter of greed  
  
And the chords struck at birth  
Grow more distant  
Yet we strike them again and again  
And we plead and we pray  
For a glimmer of day  
As the night folds its wings  
And descends  
  
Exposing the loose ends  
And the chords struck at birth  
Grow more distant  
Yet we strike them again and again  
And we plead and we pray  
For a glimmer of day  
As the night folds its wings  
And descends  
  
Exposing the loose ends
