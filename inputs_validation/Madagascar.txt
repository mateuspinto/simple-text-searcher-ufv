I wont be told anymore  
That Ive been brought down in this storm  
And left so far out from the shore  
That I cant find my way back my way anymore  
  
No I wont be told anymore  
That Ive been brought back in this storm  
And left so far out from the shore  
That I cant find my way back my way anymore  
  
No I  
No I  
  
Forgive them they teared down my soul  
Bless them that they might grow old  
And free them so that they may know  
That its never too late  
  
For the many times would seem like a memory  
I searched and found the way to choose to the end  
I found the ways why it had to be  
Mired in denial and saw all the rain  
  
If we ever find it true  
Life we have is made to choose  
Free the ball the chain  
Were here together  
  
Im gonna tell you a story  
Stand up for righteousness  
What  
Stand up for justice  
What  
Stand up for truth  
How can a person grow up with all this around them  
You got to call on that something  
Where does it come from  
That can make a way out of no way  
All this hatred  
What weve got here is  
Fear  
That power that can make a way out of now no way  
Failure to communicate  
I tell ya I seen the lightningIve heard the thunder roll  
Everybodys acting like we can do anything and it dont matter what we  
Do Maybe we gotta be extra careful because maybe it matters more than  
We even know  
Sometimes  
Hatred isnt somethin youre born with  
I feel discouraged  
It gets taught  
Sometimes I feel discouraged  
I felt this fear  
He promised never to leave me never to leave me alone no never alone  
No never alone  
Lets get something straight alright  
Promised never to leave me  
This whole thing was fucked up  
Never to leave me alone  
All men betray All lose heart  
I dont want to lose heartI want to believe  
Black men and white men  
Together at the table of brotherhood  
I have a dream  
Free at last Free at last Thank God almighty WE ARE FREE AT LAST  
  
  
I wont be told anymore  
That Ive been brought down in this storm  
And left so far out from the shore  
And I cant find my way back my way anymore  
  
No I wont be told anymore  
That Ive been brought back in this storm  
And left so far out from the shore  
That I cant find my way back my way anymore
