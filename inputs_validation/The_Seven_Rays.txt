My great grandfather was a satisfied man  
Contented in every way  
Such was the course of his everyday life  
Til he heard of the seven rays Repeat 3X  
  
Every modern man in the back of his mind  
Has a problem to face  
He wants security for the home in his head  
All he needs is the seven rays Repeat 2X  
  
And when you think about tomorrow  
What goes through your mind  
Now dont nobody get uptight  
Do you think that we can put up  
With this shit one more night  
All you need is just six more rays Repeat 2X  
  
Take one beam of light  
Prism acquire  
Break the white light down  
Seven rays appear Repeat  
  
One Red the ruler seeking freedom  
Two Gold the father seeking unity  
Three Orange the thinker seeking understanding  
Four Yellow the poet seeking harmony  
  
Take the seven rays  
Pure as fire  
Focus anywhere  
White light will appear Repeat 2X  
  
Five Green the scientist seeking truth  
Six Blue the disciple seeking goodness  
Seven Indigo the artist seeking beauty  
  
This may sound like a bunch of trumped up words  
But we keep no secrets today  
The only hope for you is in your brothers my friend  
All you need is just six more rays  
All we need is the seven rays Repeat 3X
