Nobody knows about whats going on  
With the world and the steel  
The flesh and the bone  
River keeps flowing and the grass still grows  
And the spirit keeps going nobody knows  
Poets they come and the poets they go  
Politicians and preachers they all claim to know  
The words that are written and the melodys played  
As the years turn their pages they all start to fade  
The oceans still move with the moon and the sky  
The grass still grows on the hillside  
Got to believe in believing  
Got to believe in a dream  
Freedom is ever deceiving  
Never turning out to be what it seems  
Its amazing how fast our lives go by  
Like the flash of the lightning or the blink of an eye  
We all fall in love and we fall into life  
We look for the truth on the edge of a knife  
Heavens turn around the river still flows  
Spirit keeps going nobody knows  
Words that are written and melodys played  
As the years turn their pages it all start to fade  
Oceans still move with the moon and the sky  
The grass still grows on the hillside  
Got to believe in believing  
Got to believe in a dream  
Freedom is ever deceiving  
Never turning out to be what it seems
