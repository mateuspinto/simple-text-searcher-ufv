Here we are  
We drift like gas  
On someone elses bed  
I pay high you know  
  
Here we are  
How old are you  
Its just a job to me  
  
Here the ladies always ring twice  
Thought youd slip away tonight with me  
In a subway I called you  
  
Hello you no more this talk of  
My boys will be yours  
  
No more I  
This conversation drains  
My patience dry  
  
Here the business always rings twice  
No relaxing for the boys tonight  
In a subway I called you  
  
Here the tension always slows twice  
Shed one tear its just routine for now  
In a subway I called you
