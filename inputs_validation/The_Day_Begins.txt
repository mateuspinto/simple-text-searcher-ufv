Cold hearted orb that rules the night  
Removes the colors from our sight  
Red is gray and yellow white  
But we decide which is right  
And which is an illusion  
  
Pinprick holes in a colorless sky  
Let insipid figures of light pass by  
The mighty light of ten thousand suns  
Challenges infinity and is soon gone  
  
Nighttime to some a brief interlude  
To others the fear of solitude  
Brave Helios wake up your steeds  
Bring the warmth the countryside needs
