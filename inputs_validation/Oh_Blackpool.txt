I wasnt sure if it was Marx or Hitler that was in this year  
I hadnt been to Brighton for a while so it wasnt too clear  
So imagine my surprise when I opened my eyes  
To find it was the Liberals who were hip to sloganeer  
  
Im out tonight and cant decide between Soviet hip or British pride  
  
So help me out so help me out  
Blackpool help me out Scarborough pull me through  
So help me out  
  
They wore enamel badges of David Steel on their sleeves  
And nuclear power no thanks not sure and yes please  
And their faces were two fold and their teeth they were gold  
And they wore their pinstripe suits with a rip at the knee
