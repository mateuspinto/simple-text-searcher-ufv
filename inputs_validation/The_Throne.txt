Far above the highest heavens  
On a throne of crystal light  
Dwells the God of all creation  
Rays of wonder crown His might  
Human voices blend with the angels  
Giving praise to God alone  
Heavens music rises upward  
To the Lamb upon the throne  
To the Lamb upon the throne  
  
Chorus  
Blessing Glory Sing Hallelujah  
Shout the saints of God alone  
Honor Power and Dominion  
Praises gather at the throne  
Oh they gather at the crystal throne  
Gather at the crystal throne  
  
Lightning flashes and thunder echoes  
Diamond rainbows fill the sky  
Awesome beauty Gods provision  
Never seen by human eye  
Blazing colors show the glory  
Of the Master Artists plan  
Built by god for those who love Him  
Those who trust the great I am  
Those who trust the great I am  
  
Chorus
