Baby baby baby got to say whats on my mind  
Tomorrow you are leaving and i will be left behind  
Nothing only changing youre doing what you got to do  
One moment between us  
One moment to cling to you  
  
Let the darkness fall  
Woah  
Hear your body call  
hear your body call  
  
Let the hours crawl  
Woah  
You can have it all  
hear your body call  
  
Wont you stay with me tonight  
Wont you stay with me tonight  
  
Baby baby baby all the lights are going on  
you just come in closer now just come in closer  
  
We can can be together only till the night has gone  
we should be together for the final time for ever  
  
Somewhere in the future will you smile when you think of me  
somewhere in the future some for the future  
  
Somewhere in your heart will you hold a tender memory  
some for the future always for the future  
  
Let the darkness fall  
Woah  
Hear your body call  
hear your body call  
  
Let the hours crawl  
Woah  
You can have it all  
hear your body call  
  
Wont you stay with me tonight  
Wont you stay with me tonight  
Wont you stay with me tonight  
Wont you stay with me tonight  
Tonight  
  
Wont you stay with me tonight  
Wont you stay with me tonight  
Tonight  
  
Wont you stay with me tonight  
Tonight  
  
Woah  
So let the darkness fall  
Woah  
Hear your body call  
Let the hours crawl  
Woah  
You can have it all  
  
Let the darkness fall  
Woah  
Hear your body call  
Let the hours craw
