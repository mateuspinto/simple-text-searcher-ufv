How do I stop loving you  
Writers artie butler norman martin  
  
Im trying so hard to forget you  
And leave the life we had behind  
And there are times I feel the day has come  
Ive chased you from my mind  
But Im afraid theres always something  
That sets me back and makes me see  
Youre more than just a memory in the past  
Youre still a part of me  
So how do I stop loving you  
Forget things that we used to do  
Forget all the dreams that we shared  
And how my life was knowing you cared  
Why do I end up where I start each time I try  
Just tell me how I can forget  
So I can say goodbye  
Im tired of all the lonely evenings  
And all the many times Ive cried  
Im tired of wondering what I might have done to keep you by my side  
And reaching out across your pillow  
I start remembering youre gone  
And though I know that we can never be  
The pain in me goes on  
So how do I stop loving you  
Forget things that we used to do  
Forget all the dreams that we shared  
And how my life was knowing you cared  
Why do I end up where I start each time I try  
Just tell me how I can forget  
So I can say goodbye  
So how do I stop loving you  
Please tell me why  
I find it so hard to forget  
And hard to say Goodbye  
Goodbye
