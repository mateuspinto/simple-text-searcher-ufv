Im so amazed  
at how you take my life  
love me more more than I deserve  
  
Im blown away  
by your power to  
change this life once lost  
and plant it in you  
  
And who would know  
that I was once  
on a road  
so far away from you  
All I know is that I live my life  
to show the world your amazing love  
Your amazing love  
  
Your love is so pure  
Your loves so divine  
Your love transforms my soul my mind  
Your love has the power to  
breed through hope  
Amazing Love  
amazing love  
  
Im so amazed wonderful creation  
I will live to honor you my LORD  
You are the gold treasure of a life  
I will rest in you and praise eternally  
  
And who would know  
that I was once  
on a road so far away from you  
All I know is that I live my life  
to show the world your  
amazing love  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Im so amazed
