From the highest throne  
To the earth below  
You laid down Your life  
For the likes of us  
Great is the love of the Saviour  
  
From a wounded heart  
To a life made whole  
Every human heart  
Will declare as one  
Great is the love of the Saviour  
  
Lord of endless light  
Let Your glory shine forever  
All the earth  
All the earth  
Will sing Your praise  
  
From the mountain heights  
To the valleys low  
All created things  
Given life to show  
Jesus we live for Your glory  
  
From the rising sun  
To the still of night  
Every waking moment  
For Your delight  
Jesus we live for Your glory  
  
Lord of endless light  
Let Your glory shine forever  
All the earth  
All the earth  
Will sing Your praise  
  
Hope of every heart  
Let Your name be lifted higher  
All our hearts  
All our hearts  
Will sing Your praise  
  
God be exalted  
God be exalted  
In everything  
We live for Your glory  
Live for Your glory
