Why dont you tell me that its over  
Why do you keep this hangin on  
Pack up your bags and run for cover  
Say what you mean and see it done  
Why dont you cut me loose you dont need me  
Lift up your dress and walk away  
Theres nothin left you can say to please me  
Youre just a dog whos had its day  
You beat around the bush and mumble  
About the good old days we had  
Your face grows longer as you crumble  
You had the good now taste the bad  
Let it all hit the fan  
Let it all hit the fan  
You promised me nothing would change you  
More empty words from an empty soul  
The same old stories you still cling to  
The truth be told you leave me cold  
You used to lead the dance and fumble  
Howl in the night you could not sleep  
You climbed to the top of the hill then tumbled  
Too many promises come cheap
