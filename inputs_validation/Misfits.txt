Youve been sleeping in a field but you look real rested  
You set out to outrage but you cant get arrested  
You say your image is new but it looks well tested  
Youre lost without a crowd yet you go your own way  
  
You say your summer has gone  
Now the Winter is crawlin in  
They say that even in your day  
Somehow you never could quite fit in  
Though its cold outside  
I know the Summers gonna come again  
Because you know what they say  
Every dog has his day  
  
Youre a misfit afraid of yourself so you run away and hide  
Youve been a misfit all your life  
Why dont you join the crowd  
And come inside  
You wander round this town like youve lost your way  
You had your chance in your day  
Yet you threw it all away  
But you know what they say  
Every dog has his day  
  
Look at all the losers and the mad eyed gazers  
Look at all the looneys and the sad eyed failures  
Theyre giving up living cause they just dont care  
So take a good look around  
The misfits are everywhere  
La la la la la la  
  
Youre a misfit  
Afraid of yourself so you run away and hide  
Youve been a misfit all your life  
But why dont you join the crowd and come inside  
You wander round this town  
Like youve lost your way  
You had your chance in your day  
Yet you threw it all away  
Now youre lost in the crowd  
Yet still go your own way  
  
This is your chance this is your time  
So dont throw it away  
You can have your day  
Yes its true what they say  
Every dog has his day
