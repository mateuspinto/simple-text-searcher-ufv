Cha cha cha damour  
Take this song to my lover  
Shoo shoo little bird  
Go and find my love  
Cha cha cha damour  
Serenade at her window  
Shoo shoo little bird  
Sing my song of love  
Tell her I will wait  
But if she names the date  
Tell her that I care  
More than I can bear  
When we are apart  
How it hurts my heart  
So fly away oh fly away  
And say I hope and pray  
This lovers melody will bring her back to me  
Cha cha cha damour  
Take this song to my lover  
Shoo shoo little bird  
Go and find my love  
Cha cha cha damour  
Serenade at her window  
Shoo shoo little bird  
Sing my song of love  
Shoo shoo little bird  
Tell her of my love
