I went down to the station  
I leaned up against the door  
Yeah I went down to the station  
I leaned up against the door  
I said goodbye to my sweet ride on  
I said now she couldnt use me no more  
  
It was a mean old fireman  
And a cruel old engineer  
He was a mean old fireman  
And a cruel old engineer  
Yes takin way my sweet woman  
And left me standing here  
  
Break  
  
I used to roll my baby  
Till she  was forced to jump and shout  
I used to roll my sweet baby  
Till she was forced to jump and shout  
Now that train pulls in boys  
And Ill come walkin out  
  
I heard the fireman blow the whistle  
And the engineer ring the bell  
I heard the fireman blow the whistle  
And engineer ring the bell  
I knew it was time boys  
To  bid my baby farewell  
Um
