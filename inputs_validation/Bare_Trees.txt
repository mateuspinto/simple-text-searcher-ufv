Bare trees gray light  
Oh yeah it was a cold night  
Bare trees gray light  
  
I was alone in the cold of a winters day  
You were alone and so snug in your bed  
I was alone in the cold of a winters day  
You were alone and so snug in your bed  
  
Bah do dah do dah da do da do  
Bah do dah do dah da do da do  
Bah do dah do dah da do da do  
Bah do dah do dah da do da do
