You dont care one thing about me and you never will I know  
Still I hang around you darling you know I cant let you go  
I know you will only hurt me just because I love you so  
I know I should be leaving but my heart wont let me go  
  
Tonight when you are sleeping I will lie awake and cry  
For in my heart I know that soon youll say goodbye  
How I hate to see tomorrow it will just bring tears and woe  
I know I should be leaving but my heart wont let me go
