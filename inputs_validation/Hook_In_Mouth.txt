A cockroach in the concrete courthouse tan and beady eyes  
A slouch with fallen arches purging truths into great lies  
A little man with a big eraser changing history  
Procedures that hes programmed to all he hears and sees  
  
Altering the facts and figures events and every issue  
Make a person disappear and no one will ever miss you  
  
Rewrites every story every poem that ever was  
Eliminates incompetence and those who break the laws  
Follow the instructions of the New Ways Evil Book of Rules  
Replacing rights with wrongs the files and records in the schools  
  
You say youve got the answers well who asked you anyway  
Ever think maybe it was meant to be this way  
Dont try to fool us we know the worst is yet to come  
I believe my kingdom will come  
  
F is for fighting R is for red  
Ancestors blood in battles theyve shed  
E we elect them E we eject them  
In the land of the free and the home of the brave  
D for your dying O your overture  
M they will cover your grave with manure  
This spells out freedom it means nothing to me  
As long as theres a PMRC  
  
F is for fighting R is for red  
Ancestors blood in battles theyve shed  
E we elect them E we eject them  
In the land of the free and the home of the brave  
D for your dying O your overture  
M is for money and you know what that cures  
This spells out freedom it means nothing to me  
As long as theres a PMRC  
  
Put your hand right up my shirt  
Pull the strings that make me work  
Jaws will part words fall out  
like a fish with hook in mouth  
  
Rewrites every story every poem that ever was  
Eliminates incompetence and those who break the laws  
Follow the instructions of the New Ways Evil Book of Rules  
Replacing rights with wrongs the files and records in the schools  
  
Im not a fish  
Im a man  
Hook in mouth
