There must be more than this  
O breath of God come breathe within  
There must be more than this  
Spirit of God we wait for You  
Fill us anew we pray  
Fill us anew we pray  
Chorus  
Consuming fire fan into flame  
A passion for Your Name  
Spirit of God wont you fall in this place  
Lord have Your way  
Lord have Your way with us  
Come like a rushing wind  
Clothe us with power from on high  
Now set the captives free  
Leave us abandoned to Your praise  
Lord let Your glory fall  
Lord let Your glory fall  
Chorus  
Consuming fire fan into flame  
A passion for Your Name  
Spirit of God wont you fall in this place  
Lord have Your way  
Lord have Your way with us  
Come like a rushing wind  
Clothe us with power from on high  
Now set the captives free  
Leave us abandoned to Your praise  
Lord let Your glory fall  
Lord let Your glory fall  
Chorus  
Consuming fire fan into flame  
A passion for Your Name  
Spirit of God wont you fall in this place  
Lord have Your way  
Lord have Your way with us  
Stir it up in our hearts Lord  
Stir it up in our hearts Lord  
Stir it up in our hearts  
A passion for Your Name  
A passion for Jesus  
Stir it up in our hearts Lord  
Stir it up in our hearts Lord  
Stir it up in our hearts  
A passion for Your Name
