It was a hot and sultry day somewhere in early September  
I dont hardly remember the day just the way the sun beat down upon the bay
baby  
I did not even need to know your name  
It was oh so plain to see that you had eyes for me  
Halfway open halfway closed halfnaked eyes for me baby  
  
It was a slow burning love a fairweather love affair  
A slow burning smoldering love for you and I  
And like the sun on the edge of the Western sky it died  
  
Oh the lights of the city were close at hand I might just as well have been
another man  
You might just as well have been another girl  
It might just as well have been another world  
  
It was a slow burning love a fairweather love affair  
A slow burning smoldering love for you and I  
And like the sun on the edge of the Western sky it died  
  
Oh slow burning love You were smoking up that day some kind of hot  
It was a slow burning love a fairweather love affair  
A slow burning smoldering love for you and I  
And like the sun on the edge of the Western sky it died
