When I fell from grace  
I never realized  
How deep the flood was around me  
A man whose life was toil  
Was like a kettle left to boil  
And the water left scars on me  
  
I know now who I am  
If only for a while  
I recognize the changes  
I feel like I did before the  
Magic wore thin and the baptism  
Of stains began  
  
They used to say I was  
Nowhere man  
Heading down  
Was my destiny  
But yesterday I swear  
That was someone else not me  
  
Here I stand at the crossroads edge  
Afraid to reach out for eternity  
One step when I look down  
I see someone else not me  
  
Looking back and I see  
Someone else  
  
All my life they said I  
Was going down  
But Im still standing  
Stronger proud  
And today I know theres  
So much more I can be  
  
From where I stand at the crossroads edge  
Theres a path leading out to sea  
And from somewhere  
Deep in my mind  
Sirens sing out loud  
Songs of doubt  
As only they know how  
But one glance back reminds and I see  
Someone else not me  
  
I keep looking back  
At someone else me
