If I give my heart to you tonight  
Will you still be by my side  
Or will you be gone with the morning sun  
Like a restless bird in flight  
  
Take me in your arms  
Let the love you seek  
Wash away your sorrow  
Let the morning be ours to keep  
  
And if I should tell you of the love that I feel  
Will you still be there for me  
Or will I awake to a faded love searching for freedoms gain  
  
Take me in your arms  
Let the love you seek  
Wash away your sorrow  
Let the morning be ours to keep  
  
Take me in your arms  
Let the love you seek  
Wash away your sorrow  
Let the morning be ours to keep  
  
If I give my heart to you tonight  
Will you still be by my side  
Or will you be gone with the morning sun  
Like a bird who yearns to fly
