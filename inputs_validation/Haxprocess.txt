A lifeline in a drop of blood  
A dying wish to shun a God  
Sought a dream inside the light  
Finally relieved from plight  
  
O this night is deceiving  
One eternal Winter  
Earth below and reeling  
Moon is riding high  
  
Father and a liar  
One forgotten season  
Secrets in the mire  
Moor is riding high  
  
Aligning  
  
A name inside a memory  
Waiting for you  
When words cant win her  
There is nothing to do  
  
Save your children  
Drenched in poverty  
Tracks in the snow  
Leading them to woe
