Your precious love that means so much  
Will it ever stop or will I just lose touch  
What I want to say but my words just fail  
Is that I need it so I cant help myself  
Like a hungry child I just help myself  
And when Im all full up I go out to play  
  
Lonely as the moors on a winters morning  
Quiet as the sea on a good calm night  
In your tranquil shadow I try and follow  
I hear your distant shoe clicks  
To the midnight beat  
I feel trapped in sorrow  
In this imagery  
But thats how I am and why I need you so  
  
But I dont mean to bleed you dry  
Or take you over for the rest of your life  
Its just that I need something solid in mine  
Believe me baby  
  
Your precious love that means so much  
Will it ever stop or will I just lose touch  
What I want to say but my words just fail  
I hear your distant shoe clicks  
To the midnight beat  
I feel trapped in sorrow  
In this imagery  
But thats how I am and why I need you so
