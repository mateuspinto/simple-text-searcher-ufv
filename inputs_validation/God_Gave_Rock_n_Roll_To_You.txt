God gave rock and roll to you gave rock and roll to you  
Put it in the soul of everyone  
Do you know what you want You dont know for sure  
You dont feel right you cant find a cure  
And youre gettin less than what youre lookin for  
You dont have money or a fancy car  
And youre tired of wishin on a falling star  
You gotta put your faith in a loud guitar  
Chorus  
God gave rock and roll to you gave rock and roll to you  
Gave rock and roll to everyone oh yeah  
God gave rock and roll to you gave rock and roll to you  
Put it in the soul of everyone  
Now listen  
If you wanna be a singer or play guitar  
Man you gotta sweat or you wont get far  
Cause its never too late to work ninetofive  
You can take a stand or you can compromise  
You can work real hard or just fantasize  
But you dont start livin till you realize  I gotta tell ya  
God gave rock and roll to you gave rock and roll to you  
Gave rock and roll to everyone  
God gave rock and roll to you gave rock and roll to you  
Put it in the soul  
Instrumental break  
God gave rock and roll to you to everyone he gave the song to be sung  
Gave rock and roll to you gave rock and roll to everyone  
God gave rock and roll to you to everyone he gave the song to be sung  
Gave rock and roll to you saved rock and roll for everyone  
Saved rock and roll  
chorus repeats out  
I know life sometimes can get tough And I know life sometimes can be a  
drag  
But people we have been given a gift we have been given a road  
And that roads name is Rock and Roll
