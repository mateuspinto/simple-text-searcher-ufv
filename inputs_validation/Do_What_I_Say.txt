I cry from my heart  
I want to please You lord  
To serve You each day  
Love you and learn all your ways  
You said if I love you  
Then I will keep you commands  
You did the Fathers will  
Oh Your love is so real  
To love you Lord  
Is to obey and my  
  
Jesus Ill do what you say  
Jesus Ill do what you say  
Jesus Ill do what you say  
  
Your word is my light  
Pure and live in my heart  
And I know I am  
Your hands and feet to the world  
I pray help me to love my brother as myself  
You showed the greatest love  
Is the life for your friend  
I love You Lord  
And I live to please You my  
  
Jesus Ill do what you say  
Jesus Ill do what you say  
Jesus Ill do what you say  
  
You tell me to go and I will go  
You tell me to stay and I will stay  
To hear You say  
My servant well done my servant well done
