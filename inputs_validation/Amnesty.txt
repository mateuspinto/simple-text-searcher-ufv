Love is the sweetest amnesty  
Floats like a cloud between the sky and sea  
Ill give it to you  
Could you please give it to me  
  
Love is the sweetest amnesty  
Given by the powers  
Then let us be  
Ill give it to you  
Could you please give it to me  
Cause I need you  
  
Chorus  
We can talk  
We can see  
If we disagree we do it honestly  
Let our lovin be  
The sweetest amnesty  
  
Between you and me  
Theres bound to be  
Some conscientious objection  
Our spirits dressed in mystery  
Speak solely through affection  
  
Love is the sweetest amnesty  
Floats like a cloud between the sky and sea  
Ill give it to you  
Could you please give it to me  
  
Cause I need you need you  
  
Chorus  
Let our lovin be  
The sweetest amnesty
