He was the first punk ever to set foot on this earth  
He was a genius from the day of his birth  
He could play the piano like a ring and a bell  
And evrybody screamed  
Come on rock me Amadeus  
  
He was a superstar he was dynamite and whatever he did it  
Seemed to be alright  
And he drank and he cursed and he fooled around  
But when the women would shout  
Rock me Amadeus  
Amadeus Amadeus Amadeus  
Amadeus Amadeus Amadeus  
Oh oh oh Amadeus  
  
With a bottle of wine in one hand and a woman in the other  
Cause he was a ladies man  
He never stopped to worry what the next day would bring  
Because the girls would sing  
Rock me Amadeus  
Amadeus Amadeus Amadeus  
Amadeus Amadeus Amadeus  
Oh oh oh Amadeus  
  
His mind was on rock and roll and having fun  
Because he lived so fast he had to die so young  
But he made his mark in history  
Still evrybody says  
Rock me Amadeus  
Amadeus Amadeus Amadeus  
Amadeus Amadeus Amadeus  
Oh oh oh Amadeus
