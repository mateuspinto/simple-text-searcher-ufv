By a lonely prison wall  
I heard a young girl calling  
michael they are taking you away  
For you stole travelyns corn  
So the young might see the morn  
Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay   
  
Chorus  
  
Low lie the fields of athenry  
Where once we watched the small freebirds fly  
Our love was on the wing  
We had dreams and songs to sing  
Its so lonely rond the fields of athenry  
  
By a lonely prison wall  
I heard a young man calling  
nothing matters mary when youre free  
Against the famine and the crown  
I rebelled they cut me down  
Now you must raise our child with dignity   
  
Chorus  
  
By a lonely harbour wall  
As she watched the last star falling  
As the prison ship said out against the sky  
For she lived in hope and prayed  
For her love in botany bay  
Its so lonely round the fields of athenry  
  
Chorus  
  
Its so lonely round the fields of athenry
