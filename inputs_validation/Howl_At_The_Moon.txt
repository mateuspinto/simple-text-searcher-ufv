Halloween night  
Moon shining bright  
Youll see such an amazing sight  
All of the wolves gather round  
They make a very sad and lonely sound  
  
Sadder than the wind through the trees  
It puts a lot of little goose bumps on me  
When the wolves sing their song  
They want you to sing along and  
  
Howl at the moon  
Howl at the moon  
Howl at the moon  
Howl at the moon  
  
They come from miles and miles away  
Howl at the moon  
Howl at the moon  
Howl at the moon  
Howl at the moon  
They sing all night till the moon sinks low  
  
Howl at the moon  
Howl at the moon  
Howl at the moon  
Howl at the moon
