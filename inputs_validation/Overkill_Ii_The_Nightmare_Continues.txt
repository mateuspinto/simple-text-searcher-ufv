Strangled in this knot of sin  
He returns again begins  
Again to bend and tear the will  
A witness to this Overkill  
  
Awaken Awaken in me  
Through my eyes through my eyes you will see  
What is real what is to be  
All the madness madness in me  
  
You taste the blood that I long for  
Regain my strength and complete my chore  
  
Like a serpent poised to strike  
Like the moon that fills the night  
You the question answer they cried  
Youve always been destined to ride  
  
Passion rests in an empty will  
The nightmare continues  
  
Into the night  
A rider goes then disappears  
Out of the light  
He reappears again  
  
Beware  
One eye does follow you  
To kill again  
And again  
  
Slow and sure a beating heart  
Is sure to have the killing starts  
The beating stops fin de la vie  
Overkill rides again  
  
A killer like no man  
A faster death by ones own hand  
Safety comes when the wind is still  
This the legend Overkill
