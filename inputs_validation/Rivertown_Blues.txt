Here I go again  
Another leap of faith  
I close my eyes and wait to fall  
I see a future in which I will soon become  
The only truth you know at all  
You wanna know what Im thinking  
I think about back then  
  
Back when we built something new  
The world was ours to conquer  
And we were not afraid to lose ourselves  
Somewhere inside this you changed  
And I could never follow you that way  
  
I miss you madly and its raining on the coast  
Im supposed to say this was your loss and Im fine  
I stare for hours at these numbers in my hand  
But ringing you would mend your heart and break mine  
You wanna know what Im thinking  
I think about back then  
  
Back when we built something new  
The world was ours to conquer  
And we were not afraid to lose ourselves  
Somewhere inside this you changed  
And I could never follow you that way  
  
Sometimes I dream  
We laugh til we cry  
With smoke in our eyes  
Just like old times  
Never again  
That was back then  
  
Back when we built something new  
The world was ours to conquer  
And we were not afraid to lose ourselves  
Somewhere inside this you changed  
And I could never follow you that way  
  
Somewhere inside this you changed  
And I could never follow you that way
