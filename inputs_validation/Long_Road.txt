And I wished for so long Cannot stay  
All the precious moments Cannot stay  
Its not like wings have fallen Cannot stay  
But still somethings missing I cannot say yeah  
Holding hands are daughters and sons  
And their faiths are falling down down down down  
I have wished for so long How I wish for you today  
Will I walk the long road the long road Cannot stay the long road  
Theres no need to say goodbye to say goodbye  
All the friends and family  
All the memories going round round round round  
I have wished for so long How I wish for you today  
And the wind keeps roaring And the sky keeps turning grey  
And the sun is set The sun will rise another day  
I  
I have wished for so long How I wish for you today  
I have wished for so long How I wish for you today  
Will I walk the long road We all walk the long road  
Will I walk the long road We all walk the long road  
Will I walk the long road  
Will I walk the long road We all walk the long road  
Will I walk the long road We all walk the long road  
Will I walk the long road
