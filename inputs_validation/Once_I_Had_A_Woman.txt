Lord I had a woman  
Lord knows she was good to me in every way  
Yes I had a woman  
A real woman  
Lord she gave me lovin both night and day  
My sun shine  
Whoo hoo  
For my woman  
Or else or else  
Its going to take me one more day  
If it takes me  
She went way down in Dallas  
Way down in Texas land  
Lord she had me wrapped around her wrist and around her finger baby  
Like a ring wrapped around a finger of a severed hand  
Im lookin for my Dallas honey bee  
Who can you be  
Who can you be  
Oooh hoo hoo help me  
Help me look for her  
Oh yeah
