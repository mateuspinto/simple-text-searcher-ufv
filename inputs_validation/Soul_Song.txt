I will be waiting  
With a song in my soul  
A fortunate weakling  
Which I have foretold  
  
He raises his arms tied  
Above the abyss  
Singing his sweet song  
His melody opens up the sun  
  
Freedom raid  
God has come  
Rivers of blood  
Pushed back in my veins  
  
She sleeps with her eyes closed  
To dream of the past  
Her mind has gone blind now  
While the memory closes up this sun  
  
Freedom rain  
God has come  
Rivers of blood  
Pushed back in my veins  
  
yeah  
I will be waiting  
With a song in my soul  
A fortunate weakling  
Which I have foretold
