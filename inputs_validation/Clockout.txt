All right clockout  
I got my coat  
I got my keys  
I got my head down to my lungs  
And move my feet  
Me I got all the secretaries  
Down on their knees  
Look at em scoot  
They gonna clockout  
I got my money  
Tied up in stock  
I got my mammy  
Take my doggie for a walk  
Me I got the biggest little business  
Down on the block  
Get ready get set  
Cause we gonna clockout  
Down on all fours  
Cause we gonna we gonna  
We gonna we gonna clockout  
Take my advice  
Hear my decree  
Im afraid the futures gonna be  
Maintenance free  
I got the big brush for your bowl  
Baby cant you dig my plea  
Gonna gag  
Unless we clockout  
No no no
