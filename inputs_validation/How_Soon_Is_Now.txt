I am the son  
And the heir  
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar  
I am the son and heir  
Of nothing in particular  
  
You shut your mouth  
How can you say  
I go about things the wrong way  
I am human and I need to be loved  
Just like everybody else does  
  
I am the son  
And the heir  
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar  
I am the son and heir  
Of nothing in particular  
  
You shut your mouth  
How can you say  
I go about things the wrong way  
I am human and I need to be loved  
Just like everybody else does  
  
Theres a club if youd like to go  
You could meet somebody who really loves you  
So you go and you stand on your own  
And you leave on your own  
And you go home and you cry  
And you want to die  
  
When you say its gonna happen now  
Well when exactly do you mean  
See Ive already waited too long  
And all my hope is gone  
  
You shut your mouth  
How can you say  
I go about things the wrong way  
I am human and I need to be loved  
Just like everybody else does
