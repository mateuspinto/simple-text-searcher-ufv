Why ask  
Why not it goes with this night  
So will it ever stop  
Will it always be this hard  
  
There will always be a jar of ash  
There will always be an unfit mind  
There will always be a lonely son  
There will always be a humiliated little girl  
  
Why ask  
Is there any reason  
Why ask  
If itll just let up  
  
Why ask  
Is there any reason  
Why ask  
If itll just let up  
  
Up up up up  
There will always be a headless neck  
There will always be happiness  
There will always be a handless wrist to crush  
  
There will always be a hopeful heart to disrespect  
Why ask  
Is there any reason  
Why ask  
  
If itll just let up  
Why ask  
Is there any reason  
Why ask  
  
If itll just let up  
Up up up up
