I confess to have a willingness and wanting for you  
To have you here by me near by me all my life through  
  
You run around  
You run around  
Run around baby  
Run around baby  
Some day maybe  
Well have a love  
  
Someday you say yeah someday you may  
Be my girl  
Hand in hand we walk through the land we walk  
Around the world  
But right now  
But right now  
  
You run around  
You run around  
Run around baby  
Run around baby  
Some day maybe  
Well have a love  
  
Youll be with me til eternity  
And be mine  
Sent from above will be my love til  
The end of time  
But right now  
But right now  
  
You run around  
You run around  
Run around baby  
Run around baby  
Some day maybe  
Well have a love  
  
I confess to have a willingness and wanting for you  
To have you here by me near by me all my life through
