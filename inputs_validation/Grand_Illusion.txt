I saw you in a dream it hit me like a bright light  
Flashing on a screen visions of my whole life  
I used to chase the moment of desire  
Back to when my young heart burned like a fire  
  
Chorus  
It was just a nothing but a grand illusion  
Heart was quicker than the eye  
Nothing but a grand illusion  
Legend in my own mind  
  
I held you in my arms till the other side of midnight  
Kept you in my mind you got me through some long nights  
Standing on the threshold of desire  
Caught between the madness and the fire  
  
Chorus  
  
It was all a grand illusion  
Hand was quicker than the eye  
Nothing but a grand illusion  
Legends in our own minds  
  
I used to chase the moments of desire  
Back to when my young heart burned like a fire  
  
It was just a nothing but a it was all a grand illusion  
Nothing but a grand illusion  
It was all a grand illusion  
Legend in my own mind  
  
It was just a grand illusion  
Nothing but a grand illusion  
It was just a grand illusion  
Legend in our own mind
