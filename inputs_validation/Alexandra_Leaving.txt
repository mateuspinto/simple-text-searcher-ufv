Suddenly the night has grown colder  
The god of love preparing to depart  
Alexandra hoisted on his shoulder  
They slip between the sentries of the heart  
  
Upheld by the simplicities of pleasure  
They gain the light they formlessly entwine  
And radiant beyond your widest measure  
They fall among the voices and the wine  
  
Its not a trick your senses all deceiving  
A fitful dream the morning will exhaust  
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving  
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost  
  
Even though she sleeps upon your satin  
Even though she wakes you with a kiss  
Do not say the moment was imagined  
Do not stoop to strategies like this  
  
As someone long prepared for this to happen  
Go firmly to the window Drink it in  
Exquisite music Alexandra laughing  
Your firm commitments tangible again  
  
And you who had the honor of her evening  
And by the honor had your own restored  
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving  
Alexandra leaving with her lord  
  
Even though she sleeps upon your satin  
Even though she wakes you with a kiss  
Do not say the moment was imagined  
Do not stoop to strategies like this  
  
As someone long prepared for the occasion  
In full command of every plan you wrecked  
Do not choose a cowards explanation  
that hides behind the cause and the effect  
  
And you who were bewildered by a meaning  
Whose code was broken crucifix uncrossed  
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving  
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost  
  
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving  
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost
