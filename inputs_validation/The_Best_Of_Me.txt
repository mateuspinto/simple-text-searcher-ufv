So many years gone  
Still I remember  
How did I ever let my heart believe  
In one who never  
Gave enough to me  
  
And so many years gone  
Love that was so wrong  
And I cant forget the way  
It used to be  
And how you changed the touch  
Of love for me  
  
CHORUS  
You were my one more chance  
I never thought Id find  
You were the one romance  
Ive always known in my mind  
No one will ever touch me more  
And I only hope that in return  
I might have saved the best of me  
For you  
  
And well have no ending  
If we can hold on  
And I think Ive gone this far  
Because of you  
Could be no other love but ours  
Will do  
  
repeat chorus  
  
No one will ever touch me more  
And I only hope that in return  
No matter how much we have to learn  
I saved the best of me for you
