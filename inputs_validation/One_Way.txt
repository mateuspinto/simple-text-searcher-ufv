I lay my life down at your feet  
Cause your the only one I need  
I took to You and You are always there  
  
In troubled times its You I seek  
I put You first thats all I need  
I humble all I am all to You  
  
Here we go   
  
One Way Jesus Youre the only one that I could live for  
One Way Jesus Youre the only one that I could live for  
  
You are always always there  
Everyhow and everywhere  
Your grace abounds so deeply within me  
  
You will never ever change  
Yesterday today the same  
Forever till forever meets no end  
  
Here we go   
  
One Way Jesus Youre the only one that I could live for  
One Way Jesus Youre the only one that I could live for x2  
  
You are the way the truth and the life  
I live by faith and not by sight for You  
Were livin all for You x4  
  
One Way Jesus Youre the only one that I could live for  
One Way Jesus Youre the only one that I could live for x2
