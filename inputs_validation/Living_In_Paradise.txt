I dont like those other guys looking at your curves  
I dont like you walking round with physical jerks  
Everything they say and do is getting on my nerves  
Soon they will be lucky to be picking up the perks  
Cause when they pull the shutters down and throw up in the dark  
Theyll find that all the dogs outside bite much worse than they bark  
  
Chorus  
Here we are living in paradise living in luxury  
Oh the thrill is here but it wont last long  
You better have your fun before it moves along  
And youre already looking for another fool like me  
  
I call you Betty Felon cause you are a pretty villain  
And I think that I should tell them that youd make a pretty killing  
Cause meanwhile up in heaven they are waiting at the gate  
Saying We always knew youd make it didnt think youd come this late  
And now its much too dangerous to stop what youve begun  
When everyone in paradise carries a gun  
  
Chorus  
  
Later in the evening when arrangements are made  
Ill be at the keyhole outside your bedroom door  
Cause Im the first to know whenever the plans are laid  
That never go further than floor to floor  
You think that I dont know the boy that youre touching  
But Ill be at the video and I will be watching  
  
Chorus
