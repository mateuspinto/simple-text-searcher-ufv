In the shadow of the saddle running wild and running free  
In a herd of running mustangs theres a part of you and me  
Broken spirit broken promises make them fear the sight of man  
In the shadow of the saddle lives the wild horse bronco band  
Call em cayuse call em broncos call em mustangs call em free  
In the shadow of the saddle let them run boys let them be  
We have changed the land and water just to fit our selfish needs  
Now the shadow of the saddle falls across these gallant steeds  
Oh the Spanish and the Indians gave them freedom in the sun  
In the name of God and nature let them run boys let them run  
Call em cayuse call em broncos unverified
