Do you remember me  
I sat upon your knee  
I wrote to you  
With childhood fantasies  
  
Well Im all grown up now  
And still need help somehow  
Im not a child  
But my heart still can dream  
  
So heres my lifelong wish  
My grown up christmas list  
Not for myself  
But for a world in need  
  
No more lives torn apart  
That wars would never start  
And time would heal all hearts  
And everyone would have a friend  
And right would always win  
And love would never end  
This is my grown up christmas list  
  
As children we believed  
The grandest sight to see  
Was something lovely  
Wrapped beneath our tree  
  
Well heaven surely knows  
That packages and bows  
Can never heal  
A hurting human soul  
  
No more lives torn apart  
That wars would never start  
And time would heal all hearts  
And everyone would have a friend  
And right would always win  
And love would never end  
This is my grown up christmas list  
  
What is this illusion called the innocence of youth  
Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth  
thered be  
  
No more lives torn apart  
That wars would never start  
And time would heal all hearts  
And everyone would have a friend  
And right would always win  
And love would never end oh  
This is my grown up christmas list  
  
This is my grown up christmas list
