I lie in bed beside you and watch you while you sleep  
And wonder who I was before I loved you  
Lying here beside you feeling so complete  
Thinking how I love and need and trust you  
Because I love you Im a brand new person now because you love me  
I can face the world and have the cause I love you  
Because you love me because I love you  
  
Sweeter even still is knowing that youre lying there  
And let you soon awake and reach to hold me  
And anyway you want me thats the way that I am yours  
Love as strong as this lets you control me  
Because I love you  
Because I love you
