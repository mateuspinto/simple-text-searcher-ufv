As our standards fall  
Belief and faith dies  
Its made its mark  
  
Now we wander into our final our  
Wars  
Faith  
Failing methods fill the days  
  
Undermine life  
Baneful steps that conjure hate  
Claiming our lives  
Balance fades with every day  
  
A growing cloud  
Simple lessons show the way  
  
Fall into void  
We stopped listening  
Followed our nature  
Bound by hatred our lives grow torn  
  
Finding new ways to betray  
Claiming the weak  
Boundaries crossed with no remorse  
  
Killing ourselves  
Forcing dogma overthrown  
A new standard waits  
Credence in all but one  
  
Our own kind  
Are you listening  
Now can you feel me  
Now are you listening  
Now can you feel me  
  
Take one look at our battered existence  
This persists in unity as every culture burns and segregates  
Wars  
  
Shattered our lives grow torn  
Who will save you  
Our demise  
  
Stand up its time to face your day  
Regret is such a bitter taste  
Such a bitter taste  
Regret  
  
Such a bitter taste
