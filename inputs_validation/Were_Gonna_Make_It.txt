I know the Lord will make a way  
He will make a way yes he will  
Yes he will  
  
Oh I do believe that we will make it  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Uh uh  
I was at rock bottom my whole life was mo problems  
Reincarnation of a slave pickin cotton  
Stress beamin down like the sun I felt rotten  
To the core was at war cause the enemy is plottin  
I hear him knockin sayin that we got him  
Hot like solar he wanna burn my soul up  
World on my shoulders but I roll back ya boulders  
Words have a funny way of comin back to scold ya  
Watch what come out of your mouth you crack a molar  
I tried to told ya he he he  
Enemies gunnin true believers aint runnin  
Or duckin we aint scared of nothin ya feel me  
They wanna test me and press my buttons oh really  
Allow Uncle L to hip yall to somethin uh uh  
Yeah uh check it out  
Theres a living power make a man out a coward  
Rebuild your strength like the new Trade Towers  
I thought that I was over my life got devoured  
Now Im on top and I pray for all the doubters  
Time to shout it sing it louder  
  
Chorus  
Yeah were gonna make it  
Were gonna make it were gonna make it  
Thank God we made it yeah  
And I mean it yeah yeah oh yeah  
  
I was feelin like my whole world was spinnin and spillin  
On the ground and that God wasnt willin  
It seemed like the only ones ballin was the villains  
Dollar signs in they eyes lyin to our chillin  
I wanna kill em Id rather God hit em  
They sellin venom and we buyin it like denim  
These world wide webs they weave we caught in em  
Old folks is dyin and CEOs skimmin  
The bats in your hand and this is the 9th inning  
Keep your eyes on the ball when you swingin  
Dont be confused dont be fooled by the windup  
Start switchin your position make your mind up  
Pull your bootstraps tight get your grind up  
Get your life lined up before times up  
Yo yo you know what  
Take ten percent of that dough you tryin to stack  
Send it up to God I guarantee he send it back  
Multiply it by a hundred times yall remember that  
Thats just a little jewel to get the monkey off your back  
Uh yeah sing it out now  
  
Chorus  
  
In the darkest valley through the loneliest alley  
Never give up press on through the storm  
Weepin man fall for the night seem long  
But if you stand strong joy come within the morn  
And it goes on and on and on and on and on andah  
I know it feels like your backs to the wall  
Whos sittin in the crib and you dont know who to call  
Jesus Hangin on a tight rope fingers slippin off  
But you aint by yourself dog we all been lost  
Stay on your course carry your cross  
Aint no stoppin got to keep it poppin  
You want it you can get it believe me the king did it  
Nothin gonna hold you back theres no limits  
Im sent to bring truth to rap not gimmicks  
And Im not finished man listen  
Heres the moral to the thesis yall cats need Jesus  
He put your life back together pick up the pieces  
Word to the masses I heard God asked us  
For less fake rappers and more real pastors  
Uhhuh uhhuh so hereafter  
  
Chorus x2  
  
We made it we made it  
Through the storm and rain yeah  
You can make it yes you can  
You can make it you got me  
I know you can I know you can  
I know you can yes yeah  
I do believe well make it Hallelujah  
Glory Glory
