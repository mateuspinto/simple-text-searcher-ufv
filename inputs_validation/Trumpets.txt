Your love feels like trumpets sound  
I said your love feels like trumpets sound  
Your life is like a mountain  
Your life is like a mountain  
And your heart is like a church  
With wide open doors  
And to be with you  
Is to find myself in the best of dreams  
Your love feels like trumpets  
  
Your love feels like high summer  
Your love feels like high high summer  
Your life is like an ocean  
I want to dive in naked  
Lose myself in your depths  
I want to be with you  
To find myself in the best of dreams  
Your love feels like trumpets  
  
Please dont wake me  
No dont shake me  
I want to be with you  
When being with you is  
The same as being you  
Your love feels like trumpets
