This aint rocknroll This is genocide  
  
As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent  
You asked for the latest party  
With your silicone hump and your ten inch stump  
Dressed like a priest you was  
Todd Brownings freak you was  
  
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee  
Im sure youre not protected for its plain to see  
The diamond dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees  
Hunt you to the ground they will mannequins with kill appeal  
  
Will they come  
Ill keep a friend serene  
Will they come  
Oh baby come unto me  
Will they come  
Well shes come been and gone  
Come out of the garden baby  
Youll catch your death in the fog  
Young girl they call them the Diamond Dogs  
Young girl they call them the Diamond Dogs  
  
The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat  
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase  
The elevators broke so he slides down a rope  
Onto the street below oh Tarzie go man go  
  
Meet his little hussy with his ghost town approach  
Her face is sans feature but she wears a Dali brooch  
Sweetly reminiscent something mother used to bake  
Wrecked up and paralyzed Diamond Dogs are stabilized  
  
Will they come  
Ill keep a friend serene  
Will they come  
Oh baby come unto me  
Will they come  
Well shes come been and gone  
Come out of the garden baby  
Youll catch your death in the fog  
Young girl they call them the Diamond Dogs  
Young girl they call them the Diamond Dogs  
Ooooooh call them the Diamond Dogs  
Ooooooh call them the Diamond Dogs  
  
In the year of the scavenger the season of the bitch  
Sashay on the boardwalk scurry to the ditch  
Just another future song lonely little kitsch  
Theres gonna be sorrow try and wake up tomorrow  
  
Will they come  
Ill keep a friend serene  
Will they come  
Oh baby come unto me  
Will they come  
Well shes come been and gone  
Come out of the garden baby  
Youll catch your death in the fog  
Young girl they call them the Diamond Dogs  
Young girl they call them the Diamond Dogs  
Ooooooh call them the Diamond Dogs  
Ooooooh call them the Diamond Dogs  
  
Bowwow woof woof bowwow wow  
Call them the Diamond Dogs  
Dogs  
Call them the Diamond Dogs call them call them  
Call them the Diamond Dogs call them call them ooo  
Call them the Diamond Dogs  
  
Keep cool  
Diamond Dogs rule OK  
Heyheyheyhey  
Beware of the Diamond Dogs  
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
