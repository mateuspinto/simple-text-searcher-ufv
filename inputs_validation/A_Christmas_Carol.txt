One very familiar type of song is the Christmas carol  
Although it is perhaps a bit out of season at this time  
However Im informed by my disk jockey friends  of whom  
I have none that in order to get a song popular by Christmas  
Time you have to start plugging it well in advance So here  
Goes  
It has always seemed to me after all that Christmas  
With its spirit of giving offers us all a wonderful opportunity  
Each year to reflect on what we all most sincerely and deeply  
Believe in  I refer of course to money And yet none of the  
Christmas carols that you hear on the radio or in the street  
Even attempt to capture the true spirit of Christmas as we  
Celebrate it in the United States that is to say the commercial  
Spirit So I should like to offer the following Christmas carol  
For next year as being perhaps a bit more appropriate  
  
Christmas time is here by golly  
Disapproval would be folly  
Deck the halls with hunks of holly  
Fill the cup and dont say when  
  
Kill the turkeys ducks and chickens  
Mix the punch drag out the Dickens  
Even though the prospect sickens  
Brother here we go again  
  
On Christmas Day you cant get sore  
Your fellow man you must adore  
Theres time to rob him all the more  
The other three hundred and sixtyfour  
  
Relations sparing no expense ll  
Send some useless old utensil  
Or a matching pen and pencil  
Just the thing I need how nice  
  
It doesnt matter how sincere it is  
Nor how heart felt the spirit  
Sentiment will not endear it  
Whats important is the price  
  
Hark the Herald Tribune sings  
Advertising wondrous things  
God rest ye merry merchants  
May ye make the Yuletide pay  
Angels we have heard on high  
Tell us to go out and  buy  
  
So let the raucous sleighbells jingle  
Hail our dear old friend Kriss Kringle  
Driving his reindeer across the sky  
Dont stand underneath when they fly by  
  
Spoken  
Actually I did rather well myself this last Christmas  
The nicest present I received was a gift certificate  
Good at any hospital for a lobotomy rather thoughtful
