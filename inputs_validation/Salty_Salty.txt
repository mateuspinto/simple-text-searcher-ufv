Hey sailor what you think hey buy a girl a drink  
That was the first thing she said to me  
I was on dry land but I was back at sea  
She was so pretty but she was so mean  
Cmon boys Im sure youve been  
  
Chorus  
  
Na na na na na salty salty  
Na na na na na salty salty  
  
Hey mama whats your name hey whats it matter  
You just tied up from your long voyage  
Im sure gonna make you feel better  
She was a beauty she was so good  
Doin her duty now its understood  
  
Chorus  
  
Hey lady whats your game hey can I play it  
Everybody knows when the price is right  
So just come out and say it  
She was a beauty she was so good  
Doin her duty now its understood
