I could give you a mirror  
  
How can you be so cold  
With my arms to hold you  
How can you be so cold  
With my arms to enfold you  
  
I could give you  a mirror  
To show you  dissappointments  
I could give you  a history  
Could you ever listen in to me  
  
How can you be so cold  
When theres a fire burning  
How can you be so cold  
When all the ice is melting  
  
I could give you  a mirror  
To show you  dissappointments  
I could give you  a history  
Could you ever listen in to me
