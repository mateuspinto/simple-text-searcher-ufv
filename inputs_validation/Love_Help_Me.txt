Vibrant flashes in my mind  
Remind me of a foregone time  
The blackened faces broken romance  
Blackened faces  
  
My broken heart has bled  
With memories of a love thats dead  
Sometimes happy then sad  
I need love love help me  
  
Passing by the grounds of time  
Memories that are only mine  
Looking for love a brand new love  
Looking for love  
  
Dreams that are hard to see  
Finding a new love for me  
Someday she must come along  
I need love love help me  
  
I need love to come home  
Somewhere there must be one  
  
Hoping someday for good news  
Waiting for that girl to choose  
Only hoping all I can do  
Only hoping  
  
One day she must come along  
A girl as pretty as a song  
A woman just meant for me  
I need love love help me  
  
Vibrant flashes in my mind  
Remind me of a foregone time  
The blackened faces broken romance  
Blackened faces  
  
My broken heart has bled  
With memories of a love thats dead  
Sometimes happy then sad  
I need love love help me  
  
I need love love help me
