We dim the light  
We stoke the fire  
We breathe the evergreen  
Young ones wait  
  
While the old ones make up  
Tales of how it used to be  
China dolls  
Candy corn  
  
Painted wooden toys  
Treasures found  
To the wondrous sound  
Of carolling the Savior  
  
Born to us on Christmas morn  
Emmanuel God with us  
Emmanuel  
Emmanuel God with us  
  
The son of Israel  
And still he calls  
Through the night  
Beyond the days of old  
  
A voice of peace  
To the weary ones  
Who struggle with the human soul  
All of us  
  
Travellers  
Through a given time  
Who can know  
What tomorrow holds  
  
But over the horizon  
Surely you and I will find  
  
Emmanuel God with us  
Emmanuel  
Emmanuel God with us  
  
The son of Israel  
And the years they come  
And the years they go  
Though we may forget somehow  
  
That the child once born in Bethlehem  
Is still among us now  
Emmanuel  
Emmanuel God with us  
The son of Israel  
  
Emmanuel God with us Emmanuel  
Emmanuel Emmanuel  
Emmanuel God with us Emmanuel  
  
The son of Israel Israel  
The son of Israel  
The son of IsIsrael Son of Israel
