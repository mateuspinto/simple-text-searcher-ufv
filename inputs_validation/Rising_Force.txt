Out of the darkness the voices are calling  
Riding the wings of a song  
The fury is screaming and Heaven is falling  
I feel it coming on strong  
  
The lightning strikes cracking the night  
It feels like never before  
Thunder and sparks in the heart of the dark  
I hear a rising force  
  
Searching my soul I find something else  
I take my life in my hands  
From the gates of Heaven to the altars of Hell  
The power is at my command  
  
The lightning strikes cracking the night  
Im not the same anymore  
Thunder and spark in the heart of the dark  
I feel a rising force  
  
Burned by the glory of a sacred fire  
A rising force starts to shine  
Alone in the inferno it soars ever higher  
Leaving the demons behind
