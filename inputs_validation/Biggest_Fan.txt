You would think we in a waterbed  
All the sheets are soaked  
Im glad that I aint gotta work today  
Cause last night I did the most  
Girl you would think I was inside your head  
Cause I know everything you want  
And no one asked you if you got a man  
And do I care I dont  
Thats when we started sexing  
Its getting loud got them feeling like they in the clouds  
Got them screaming like they in the crowd  
I make them scream baby baby baby baby  
  
When you scream I need  
To pull your body closer let me sex you baby  
Girl you better not change your mind  
Cause girl we got one night only  
One just to love right baby  
Youre my biggest fan girl I want you to holler  
  
Two girls and one champ no is not an option  
Girl Ill be the captain of the ship  
They gonna have my motor rocking  
Singing to them like play the dj all night long  
Getting these bitches and play in my song  
And switching positions I got the money so  
Im granting they wishes  
Ill be that sugar daddy  
Its getting loud got them feeling like they in the clouds  
Got them screaming like they in the crowd  
I make them scream  
  
When you scream I need  
To pull your body closer let me sex you baby  
Girl you better not change your mind  
Cause girl we got one night only  
One just to love right baby  
Youre my biggest fan girl I want you to holler for me yeah  
  
Come on girl tear it up  
You can make it clap for me girl give it up  
God damn youre fine Im bout to stand up stand up  
I just came do you just to make you holler  
Doing it for hours even in the shower  
Over and over again  
Baby Im all up in your driveway kissing flowers  
Are you ready Im a take whats mine  
You get comfortable slow and easy  
Im kinda tipsy from this wine  
So what I say might be a little confusing  
I got a magnum in my wallet  
Im a pull it out of there then Ill use it  
Im gonna make you scream  
  
When you scream I need  
To pull your body closer let me sex you baby  
Girl you better not change your mind  
Cause girl we got one night only  
One just to love right baby  
Youre my biggest fan girl I want you to holler  
  
When you scream I need  
To pull your body closer let me sex you baby  
Girl you better not change your mind  
Cause girl we got one night only  
One just to love right baby  
Youre my biggest fan girl I want you to holler
