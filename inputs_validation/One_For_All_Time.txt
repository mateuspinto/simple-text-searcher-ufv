I can still remember the magic I saw in your eyes so honest  
And so tender true love with no compromise  
  
All those things I miss when I reminisce about you baby um hm  
  
Chorus  
Why cant we go back in time when I was your and you where mine  
Love is special meant to be eternally our love is one for all time  
Um time mm this time only  
  
How is it I see you in every strangers face I dont wanna need you  
But my stubborn heart keeps going and I just cant erase  
  
Oh oh oh oh all these things I miss when I remenise about you boy  
Bet you didnt know how much I love ya wont mean to show ya baby  
  
Chorus  
  
I got to hear your conversation intelligent debating baby that  
Would move me they way you make me fell so special how could  
You forget that you where made for me you where made for me  
  
Chorus  
  
Skatting one for all time mine
