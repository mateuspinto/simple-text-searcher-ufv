All the sailors theyre all home from leave  
And everybodys waiting for them to try to deceive  
The storekeepers have drawn their lace curtains bare  
And all the women and the wee young girls all waiting there  
Ooooh but how the ladies pay  
Oh if they only knew how the ladies pay  
Yeah now now the ladies pay  
Oh when the men theyve gone away  
Nobody is standing on upon the door  
And nobody is feeding any of the poor  
The poor sick soldier lies in bed beside his girl  
Thinking of another place on the other side of the world  
Ah how the ladies pay  
Oh oh how the ladies pay  
When the men theyve gone away  
Oh I wish I knew how the ladies pay  
Day and night night and day  
How the ladies pay  
Day and night night and day night and day  
Ladies pay now
