I woke up the other day walked out to blue suburban skies  
Skies filled with dreams and butterflies  
And I wondered to myself how do I fit in this game  
Just a nameless face or faceless name  
Then I remembered an old friend of mine how wed watch tv all night  
Tell each other about our dreams but I dont see him no more no  
Light a cigarette and watch this day go by  
Burned another six minutes to the sky  
I need a fucking answer but I guess thats why we live this life  
A constant search for something right  
Now my mind is wondering how am I going to get fucked up today  
Light a bowl and see it all fade away  
It happens everyday
