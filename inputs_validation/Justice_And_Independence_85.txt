He was born on the fourth day of July  
So his parents called him Independence Day  
He married a girl named Justice who gave birth  
To a son called Nation  
Then she walked away  
Independence he would daydream and hed pretend  
That someday him and Justice and Nation would get together again  
But Justice held up in a shotgun shack  
And she wouldnt let nobody in  
So a Nation cried  
  
Oh oh  
When a Nation cries  
His tears fall down like missiles from the skies  
Justice look into Independences eyes  
Can you make everything alright  
Can you keep your Nation warm tonight  
  
Well Nation grew up and got himself a reputation  
Couldnt keep the boy at home no no  
He just kept running round and round and round and round  
Independence and Justice well they felt so ashamed  
When the Nation fell down they argued who was to blame  
Nation if youll just come home well have this family again  
Oh Nation dont cry  
  
Oh oh  
When a Nation cries  
His tears fall down like missiles from the skies  
Justice look into Independences eyes  
Can you make everything alright  
Can you keep your Nation warm tonight  
  
Roll a rock across the country  
Everybody come along  
When youre feelin down yeah yeah  
Just sing this song yeah yeah
