All alone  
Nothing to do  
Its lonely here  
Without you  
  
The candle light is burning low  
A love songs on the radio  
And memories are all I have to show  
  
Photographs  
Tickets for two  
Promises  
That all fell through  
  
Now everythings in black and white  
The colors faded with the night  
The stars we used to wish upon  
Have somehow lost their light  
  
Where is the feeling we used to know  
Where is the music that played  
Oh what happened to the love  
That used to show  
Where did the feeling go  
  
A cigarette  
A glass of wine  
A paperback  
To pass the time  
  
As I lie awake tonight  
Ill leave the porch light burning bright  
And miss the loving arms  
That used to hold me tight  
  
Where is the feeling we used to know  
Where is the music that played  
Oh what happened to the love  
That used to show  
Where did the feeling go
