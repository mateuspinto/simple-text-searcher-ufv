In the Valley of Dying Stars  
as the Gods dream their angry dreams  
Restless Spirits thoughts arise  
from the porcelain shuttered rooms  
they shift and glide  
The Dawn becomes lighter  
for the Weeping of the Spirits Crystallize  
  
Welcome my friend I know your face well  
I know the mark that you wear  
Your Fathers eyes watch from afar  
I know the gift that you bear for we are one  
  
Thunder and Blood rage on the wind  
Spirits of Vengeance collide  
Brother of mine Tyrant of air  
I see the gift that you bear  
For we are one  
For we are one  
  
Chorus  
Ride like the wind in chains of defiance  
I see the scars and the pain  
Shatter the ground I stand beforr you  
Kill me or die where you stand  
  
Ten thousand sons scream through the wind  
Burning the Angels alive  
Shining in chains Blood stains the air  
I know the mark that you wear  
For we are one  
For we arc one  
  
Chorus  
  
Ride like the wind in chains of defiance  
I see the scars of the pain  
Shatter the ground the Spirits Alliance  
I see the whips and the stain  
Ride like the wind in chains of defiance  
I see the work of your name  
Shatter the ground I stand before you  
Kill me or die where you stand  
Die where you stand
