Blackbird singing in the dead of night  
Take these broken wings and learn to fly  
All your life you were only waiting for this moment to arise  
  
Blackbird singing in the dead of night  
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see  
All your life you were only waiting for this moment to be free  
  
Blackbird fly Fly  
Blackbird fly Fly  
Into the light of the dark black night  
  
Blackbird fly Fly  
Blackbird fly Fly  
Into the light of the dark black night  
  
Blackbird singing in the dead of night  
Take these broken wings and learn to fly  
All your life you were only waiting for this moment to arise  
You were only waiting for this moment to arise  
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
