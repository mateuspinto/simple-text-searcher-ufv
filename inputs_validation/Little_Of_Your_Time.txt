Im sick of picking the pieces  
And secondguessing  
My reasons why you dont trust me  
Why must we do this to one another  
  
We are just passionate lovers  
With trouble under the covers  
Nothing worse than when  
You know that its over  
  
Chorus  
I just need a little of your time  
A little of your time  
To say the words I never said  
Just need a little of your time  
A little of your time  
To show you that I am not dead  
  
Please dont leave stay in bed  
Touch my body instead  
Gonna make you feel it  
Can you still feel it  
Gonna make you feel it  
Can you still feel it  
  
Well Ive got nothing to hide  
Dip down and come for a ride  
Im a racy devil so sly  
You cannot hear him coming  
  
Cause my defenses are weak  
I have no breath left to speak  
So take the evidence  
And bury it somewhere  
  
Chorus  
  
Please dont leave stay in bed  
Touch my body instead  
Gonna make you feel it  
Can you still feel it  
Gonna make you feel it  
Can you still feel it  
  
Oh my I dont mind being the other guy  
Nice try for these games I do not have the time  
If you want me call me  
Come and take a risk kiss  
Leave somewhere deep under the surface  
  
Chorus  
  
Please dont leave stay in bed  
Touch my body instead  
Gonna make you feel it  
Can you still feel it  
Gonna make you feel it  
Can you still feel it  
Gonna make you feel it  
Can you still feel it  
Gonna make you feel it  
Can you still feel it
