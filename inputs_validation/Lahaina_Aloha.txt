Where the sea breeze  
Sways the palm trees  
Paradise awaits  
And so does she  
  
Reliving love  
That was like a romance  
From a page in history  
  
It was the last place  
That he stopped at  
On the way back to his boat  
  
She was dancing  
Met his glancing  
Like they say  
It was all she wrote  
  
You know I want to  
But I cant stay bye bye  
Girl you know Im gonna sail away sail away  
When the wind comes up  
And when the sun goes down  
Ill say goodbye to this Hawaiian town  
  
I dont know what way you pull this shines   
You and Lahaina always on my mind  
  
They left the dance floor  
So they could spend more  
Precious time near the water side  
  
It wasnt wrong  
And it wasnt right  
They were two ships  
Passing in the night  
  
You know I want to  
But I cant stay bye bye  
Girl you know Im gonna sail away sail away  
When the wind comes up  
And when the sun goes down  
Ill say goodbye to this Hawaiian town  
  
I think about you when the full moon shines  
Lahaina always on my mind  
  
You know I want to  
But I cant stay bye bye  
Girl you know Im gonna sail away sail away  
When the wind comes up  
And when the sun goes down  
Ill say goodbye to this Hawaiian town  
  
I think about you when the full moon shines  
Lahaina always on my mind  
  
You know I want to  
But I cant stay bye bye  
Girl you know Im gonna sail away sail away  
When the wind comes up  
And when the sun goes down  
Ill say goodbye to this Hawaiian town  
  
I think about you when the full moon shines  
Lahaina always on my mind
