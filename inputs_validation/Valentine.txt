Inside these moments waiting  
Beneath the windows of  
The house of love  
Like Romeo to Juliet above  
The lights out on the freeway  
They lead me back to you  
For always and forever now  
Ill be with you  
Cause you know that Ive come here for a reason  
Tell me that theres something to this rhyme  
Listen to your heart  
Tell me what you want now  
But dont let me be denied  
And be my valentine  
Be mine  
The dragonfly at midnight  
The jasmine of your room  
The candle light inside our eyes  
The dawn will come too soon  
I come to you as nothing now  
But everything I am  
Im burning for you constantly  
Just let me be your man  
Cause you know that Ive come here for a reason  
Tell me that theres something to this rhyme  
Listen to your heart  
Tell me what you want now  
But dont let me be denied  
And be my valentine  
Be mine  
Valentine  
Cause you know that Ive come here for a reason  
Tell me that theres something to this rhyme  
Listen to your heart  
And tell me what you want now  
But dont let me be denied  
And be my valentine  
Be mine  
Be my valentine  
Be mine
