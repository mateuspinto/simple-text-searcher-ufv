Ill never know why I had to go  
Why I had to put up such a lousy rotten show  
Boy I was tough packing all my stuff  
Saying I dont need you anymore Ive had enough  
And now look at me standing here again cause I found out that  
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here  
Gotta have you near  
  
As good as new my love for you  
And keeping it that way is my intention  
As good as new and growing too  
Yes I think its taking on a new dimension  
Its as good as new my love for you  
Just like it used to be and even better  
As good as new thank God its true  
Darling we were always meant to stay together  
  
Feel like a creep never felt so cheap  
Never had a notion that my love could be so deep  
How could I make such a dumb mistake  
Now I know Im not entitled to another break  
But please baby I beg you to forgive cause I found out that  
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here  
Gotta get you near  
  
I thought that our love was at an end but here I am again  
  
As good as new my love for you  
And keeping it that way is my intention  
As good as new and growing too  
Yes I think its taking on a new dimension  
Its as good as new my love for you  
Just like it used to be and even better  
As good as new thank God its true  
Darling we were always meant to stay together  
  
Yes the love I have for you feels as good as new  
Darling we were always meant to stay together
