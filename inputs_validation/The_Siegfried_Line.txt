All the guns are silent on the Western wall  
And they cleaned the rifles that we never use it all  
And were writing letters just to pass the time  
And the days go by on The Siegfried Line  
  
Oh they say the English have given up the war  
And we heard the Russians wont last through 44  
But a longtime soldier has an open mind  
And a man grows old on The Siegfried Line  
  
Soon soon they say the war will be over oh oh  
Home home we will be home in the summer no no  
  
Oh we light the campfire and we drank the beer  
And we know the flag we fly must last a thousand years  
And we eat Dutch chocolate and we drink French wine  
And they feed us well on The Siegfried Line  
  
Soon soon they say the war will be over oh oh  
Home home we will come home in the summer la la la  
We will come home we will come home we will come home come home
