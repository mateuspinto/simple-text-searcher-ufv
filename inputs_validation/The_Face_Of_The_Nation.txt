As I run through this life  
Sometimes it breaks my heart  
Seein old people goin downtown  
Stumblin their way through the dark  
And the little babies cry  
For their mothers warmth  
Sometimes I feel so helpless  
I dont know where to start  
  
And the face of the nation  
Keeps changin and changin  
The face of the nation  
I dont recognize it no more  
The face of the nation  
The face of the nation  
  
So many lonely people  
Damn those broken dreams  
Oh yes it could be better  
You can say that about anything  
Some got it worse than me  
Some got it worse than you  
You see the people starvin underneath the tree  
And you wonder what happened to the golden rule  
  
And the face of the nation  
Keeps changin and changin  
The face of the nation  
I dont recognize it no more  
The face of the nation  
The face of the nation  
  
You know babe Im gonna keep on tryin  
To put things right  
If only for me and you  
Cause the devil sleeps tonight  
  
And the face of the nation  
Keeps changin and changin  
The face of the nation  
I dont recognize it no more  
The face of the nation  
The face of the nation  
  
And the face of the nation  
Keeps changin and changin  
The face of the nation  
I dont recognize it no more  
The face of the nation  
The face of the nation
