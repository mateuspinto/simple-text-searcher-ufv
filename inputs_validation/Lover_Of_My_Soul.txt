Mmm when I see the winter  
Turning into spring  
Oh it speaks to this heart of mine  
More than anything  
Underneath a blanket of snow  
Cold and white  
Something is stirring in the still of the night  
When the sun comes up  
Slowly with the dawn  
Oh this is the common feeling  
That I hang my hope up on  
There is a love and beauty  
In all that I see  
And no one nobody  
Is explaining you to me  
  
And maybe my eyes cant see  
But you are surrounding me  
Here in the wind and rain  
The things that I know  
Are tender and sweet  
This song as my lead  
I know the voice I know the touch  
Lover of my soul  
  
When the evening sun  
Slowly fades to red  
Time and time and time again  
I whisper in my head  
Give me grace  
Give me strength  
To firmly believe  
That the maker of this whole wide world is a father to me  
  
And maybe my eyes cant see  
But you are surrounding me  
Here in the wind and rain  
The things that I know  
Are tender and sweet  
This song as my lead  
I know the voice I know the touch  
Lover of my soul  
  
And maybe my eyes cant see  
But you are surrounding me  
Here in the wind and rain  
The things that I know  
Are tender and sweet  
This song as my lead  
I know the voice I know the touch  
Lover of my soul
