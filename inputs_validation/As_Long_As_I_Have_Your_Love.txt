The word you send today  
From somewhere far away  
Cut in deep to the bone  
Though I am not with you now  
I feel you close somehow  
Too many days so far from home  
And I send my dream to you  
And I will go on  
As long as I have your love  
  
I see your candle burn  
You wait for my return  
I feel your shadow in the night  
The question still remains oh love its still the same  
Oh Ill get by  
Dont you know Ill be alright  
As long as I have your love
