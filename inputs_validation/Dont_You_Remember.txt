When will I see you again  
You left with no goodbye not a single word was said  
No final kiss to seal anything  
I had no idea of the state we were in  
  
I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness  
And a wandering eye and a heaviness in my head  
But dont you remember dont you remember  
The reason you loved me before  
Baby please remember me once more  
  
When was the last time you thought of me  
Or have you completely erased me from your memories  
I often think about where I went wrong  
The more I do the less I know  
  
But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness  
And a wandering eye and a heaviness in my head  
But dont you remember dont you remember  
The reason you loved me before  
Baby please remember me once more  
  
Oh I gave you the space so you could breathe  
I kept my distance so you would be free  
In hope that you find the missing piece  
To bring you back to me  
  
Why dont you remember dont you remember  
The reason you loved me before  
Baby please remember me once more  
When will I see you again
