Daddy cool with a ninety dollar smile  
Took my money out of gratitude  
And he git right outa town  well  
  
I gotta getty up steady up shoot him down  
Gotta hit that latitude  babe  
  
chorus repeat  
  
Big bad leroy brown he got no common  
Sense  no no  
He got no brains but he sure gotta lot of style  
Cant stand no more in this here jail  
I gotta rid myself of this sentence  
  
Gotta get out the heat step into the shade  
Gotta get me there dead or alive  babe  
  
Wooh wooh big bad leroy wooh wooh  
Wooh wooh big bad leroy  brown  well  
  
chorus repeat  
  
Big mama lulu belle she had a nervous breakdown  
she had a nervous breakdown  
Leroys taken her honey chile away  
But she met him down at the station  
Put a shot gun to his head  
And unless I be mistaken  
This is what she said  
big bad big boy big bad leroy brown  
Im gonna get that cutie pie  
  
chorus repeat
