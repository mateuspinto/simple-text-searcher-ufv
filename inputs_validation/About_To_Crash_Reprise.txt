Im alive again  
Darkness far behind me  
Im invincible  
Despair will never find me  
  
I feel strong  
Ive got a new sense of elation  
Boundless energy  
Euphoria fixation  
  
Still talk to just get by  
Seems so meaningless to try  
When all I want to do is cry  
Who would ever know I felt so sad  
  
Cause even though I get so high  
I know that I will never fly  
And when I fall out of the sky  
Wholl be standing by  
Will you be standing by
