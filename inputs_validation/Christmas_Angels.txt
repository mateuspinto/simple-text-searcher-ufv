Christmas angels sing all around us  
Spread good tidings over the earth  
Telling of a child in a manger who is born  
He is the King of kings  
King of glory hope for our nations  
Sent to earth to save and redeem  
Prince of peace behold and adore  
The Son of God has come to set us free  
Celebrate and sing Hallelujah  
Raise the banner dance and rejoice  
Celebrate the birth of Messiah  
Hes the King of King the Lord of all  
Hosanna hosanna hosanna in the highest  
Hosanna hosanna hosanna in the highest  
We sing joy to the world the Lord has come  
Joy to the world the Lord has come  
Joy to the world He is here forever and always  
Christmas angels sing all around us  
All creation hears what they say  
Bow before Him come and behold  
The Son of God born on Christmas day  
Joy to the world the Lord has come
