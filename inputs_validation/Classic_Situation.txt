  
Sleep on it see if it makes a difference in the morning  
Go to work get through the day and try not to remember  
Even if we had something to say  
Would you hold it dear would it fly away with you with you  
  
Long ago it felt like we were both so much younger  
Here we are a repeat of a classic situation  
Did you build us up just to say how high  
Would you let me down  
Even notice that I was with you with you  
There you go gone again without an explanation  
So anyway get through the day and try not to remember  
Even if we found nothing to say  
Would it finally hide all the reasons to stay with you with you
