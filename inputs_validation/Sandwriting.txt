Sandwriting  
Leave your name and  
Let the wind  
And high tide  
Take it away  
Each white gold grain  
That made up your name  
  
Take it away  
  
Sandwriting  
Write your lovers monogram  
Upon the cool damp  
White gold grain  
say this is who I am  
Yes this is all you are my friend  
Some shapes upon the sand  
Of white gold grain  
Washed and blown away  
With the memory of your name  
  
Take it away  
  
Go tell the story  
To the wind and sea  
What ever became of you and me  
Each letter of love  
That had its golden day  
A love song  
Without goodbye  
  
Take it away  
  
Sandwriting
