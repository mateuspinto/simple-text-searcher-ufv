Alons viens encore cherie  
Jattendrai patiemment sous la lampe dans la vieille avenue  
  
Then I may end  
She had things to buy  
I close my eyes  
Yet I dont know why  
I gave her money said she knew someone  
And she said she wont be long  
  
Lamplight keep on burning while this heart of mine is yearning  
Lamplight keep on burning till this love of yours is mine  
  
I sat alone with my thoughts and laughed  
Then saw your face in an old photograph  
I didnt think that I could live without you but what am I to do   
  
Lamplight keep on burning while this heart of mine is yearning  
Lamplight keep on burning till this love of yours is mine  
  
Come home again dear  
I have waited year after year  
Under the lamp in our old avenue  
If all in the world thats laughing why should it make us cry
