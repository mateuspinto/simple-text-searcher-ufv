Oh Willa Mae acome ashakin by my way  
You gonna drive me wild  
You know I love you child Willa Mae  
Oh Willa Mae I love you more everyday ooh  
Oh Willa Mae yeah I love you more everyday  
They say that love is blind but they did not know your kind  
Oh Willa Mae you give me chills when we meet  
Like a bulldog walkin barefoot on a coldcold street  
Willa Mae acome ashakin by my way  
You got the love I need honey yes indeed  
Oh Willa Mae yeah
