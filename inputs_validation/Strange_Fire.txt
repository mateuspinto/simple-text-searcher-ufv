I come to you with strange fire  
I make an offering of love  
The incense of my soil is burned  
By the fire in my blood  
I come with a softer answer  
To the questions that lie in your path  
I want to harbor you from the anger  
Find a refuge from the wrath  
  
This is a message  
A message of love  
Love that moves from the inside out  
Love that never grows tired  
I come to you with strange fire  
Fire  
  
Mercenaries of the shrine  
Now who are you to speak for god  
With haughty eyes and lying tongues  
And hands that shed innocent blood  
Now who delivered you the power  
To interpret calvary  
You gamble away our freedom  
To gain your own authority  
  
Find another state of mind  
You know its time we all learned  
To grab hold  
Strange fire burns  
With the motion of love  
  
Fire  
Fire  
  
When you learn to love yourself  
You will dissolve all the stones that are cast  
Now you will learn to burn the icing sky  
To melt the waxen mask  
I said to have the gift of true release  
This is a peace that will take you higher  
Oh I come to you with my offering  
I bring you strange fire  
  
This is a message  
A message of love  
Love that moves from the inside out  
Love that never grows tired  
I come to you with strange fire  
Fire  
Fire  
I come to you with strange fire
