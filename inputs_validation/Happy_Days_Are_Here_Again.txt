So long sad times  
Go long bad times  
We are rid of you at last  
Howdy gay times  
Cloudy gray times  
You are now a thing of the past  
  
Happy days are here again  
The skies above are clear again  
So lets sing a song of cheer again  
Happy days are here again  
  
Altogether shout it now  
Theres no one  
Who can doubt it now  
So lets tell the world about it now  
Happy days are here again  
  
Your cares and troubles are gone  
Therell be no more from now on  
From now on  
  
Happy days are here again  
The skies above are clear again  
So lets sing a song of cheer again  
Happy times  
Happy nights  
Happy days  
Are here again
