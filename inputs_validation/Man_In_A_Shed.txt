Well there was a man who lived in a shed  
Spent most of his days out of his head  
For his shed was rotten let in the rain  
Said it was enough to drive any man insane  
When it rained  
He felt so bad  
When it snowed he felt just simply sad  
  
Well there was a girl who lived nearby  
Whenever he saw her he could only simply sigh  
But she lived in a house so very big and grand  
For him it seemed like some very distant land  
So when he called her  
His shed to mend  
She said Im sorry youll just have to find a friend  
  
Well this story is not so very new  
But the man is me yes and the girl is you  
So leave your house come into my shed  
Please stop my world from raining through my head  
Please dont think  
Im not your sort  
Youll find that sheds are nicer than you thought
