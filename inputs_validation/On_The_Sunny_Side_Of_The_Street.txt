Grab your coat and get your hat  
Leave your worries on the doorstep  
Life can be so sweet  
On the sunny side of the street  
  
Cant you hear the pitterpat  
And that happy tune is your step  
Life can be complete  
On the sunny side of the street  
  
I used to walk in the shade with my blues on parade  
But Im not afraid This rovers crossed over  
  
If I never had a cent  
Id be rich as Rockefeller  
Gold dust at my feet  
On the sunny side of the street  
  
Instrumental  
  
I used to walk in the shade with them blues on parade  
Now Im not afraid This rover has crossed over  
  
Now if I never made one cent  
Ill still be rich as Rockefeller  
There will be gold dust at my feet  
On the sunny  
On the sunny sunny side of the street
