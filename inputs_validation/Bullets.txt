Well hes been collecting since the age of nine  
Every shiny bullet that he could find  
Built himself a house with the wooden floors  
Put the shiny bullets in a chest of drawers  
  
Well his wifes long gone and the kids have grown  
And trees they fall down on their own  
Memories fade like an old slideshow  
But the bullets still shine like coins in the snow  
  
Well one day took himself into town  
The men with a truck well they came around  
Took the television and the gun from the war  
And almost every bullet from the chest of drawers  
  
Well he came back home and found the house in a mess  
Run into the bedroom and the old brown chest  
Didnt care much for the vcr  
But he cried for the space where the bullets were  
  
The men drove the truck down into town  
And sold all the silver they had found  
But they couldnt sell the bullets cause they werent live rounds  
So they dug a big hole put the bullets in the ground  
  
Now he doesnt leave the house much anymore  
Cause the men are gonna come like they did before  
And hell hold onto the three or four  
Bullets that they left in the chest of drawers  
Oh yeah the bullets that they left in the chest of drawers
