Chorus x2  
You throw Rose by the case   
Three hundred dollar jewellery  we  by the cases  
You define my case Gucci is got no laces  
Its all about the cases in the kitchen gonna make it  
  
Up down up down my top doing the matrix  
 well run shit basic  
Everything kitty cocaine crazy  
Bitch they hit my phone they fucked out my situation  
DJ drop they got it dont   
 youre gambling with your savings  
 doing numbers I may need a helper  
Bitch say she wanna fucking so you know what nigger left for  
Rose by the cases  by the boxes  
 Im the shit so how the fuck she gonna be cocky

Trap on  I stay down   
Hell on Earth I say hello to my neighbor  
Ghetto nigger got a mansion and   
Steel  I said get   
Try me in the club we gonna  your ass inside it  
All my hoes excited damn your  cry

Me and you got it from Atlanta down to Memphis  
Getting money I could pay you niggers
