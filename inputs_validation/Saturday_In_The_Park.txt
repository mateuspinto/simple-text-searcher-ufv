Saturday in the park  
I think it was the Fourth of July  
Saturday in the park  
I think it was the Fourth of July  
People dancing people laughing  
A man selling ice cream singing Italian songs  
Eh Cumpari ci vo sunari  
Can you dig it yes I can  
And Ive been waiting such a long time  
For Saturday  
  
Another day in the park  
I think it was the Fourth of July  
Another day in the park  
I think it was the Fourth of July  
People talking really smiling  
A man playing guitar  
Singing for us all  
Will you help him change the world  
Can you dig it yes I can  
And Ive been waiting such a long time  
For today  
  
Slow motion riders fly the colors of the day  
A bronze man still can tell stories his own way  
Listen children all is not lost  
All is not lost oh no no  
  
Funny days in the park  
Every days the Fourth of July  
Funny days in the park  
Every days the Fourth of July  
People reaching people touching  
A real celebration  
Waiting for us all  
If we want it really want it  
Can you dig it yes I can  
And Ive been waiting such a long time  
For the day
