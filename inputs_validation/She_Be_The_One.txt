She wakes you up  
Early in the morning  
She tell you babe  
I feel a little horny  
She bring you up and then  
You know you want it  
I like the way  
You give it girl  
Your mouth is dry  
Your heart is beating faster  
You want to die  
Youre too afraid to ask her  
She pops the gun  
Your prayers already answered  
Tick tock bang  
Thank you maam  
Dont fool yourself  
You cant stop it if you try  
And its a bumpy ride  
  
She be the one  
She be the drug  
She gonna take you high  
Take you low  
Never get enough  
She be the one  
She be the bomb  
Watch out here she come  
You know youre gonna get some  
  
She hits the club and  
Everybody watches  
When she dances  
Everybody wants it  
The kind of girl  
You kinda gotta watch it  
She might just get away  
She makes you wait  
She likes to play  
That kind of game  
She take your money  
You gladly give it all away  
She makes you nasty  
Even want to feel pain  
Then shell make you  
Born again  
  
Dont fool yourself  
You cant stop it if you try  
And its a bumpy ride  
  
She be the one  
She be the drug  
She gonna take you high  
Take you low  
Never get enough  
She be the one  
She be the bomb  
Watch out here she come  
She be the one  
She be the drug  
She gonna take you high  
Take you low  
Never get enough  
She be the one  
She be the bomb  
Watch out here she comes  
You know you gonna  
Get some  
  
You know you gonna  
Get some  
  
She be the one  
  
She be the one  
She be the drug  
She gonna take you high  
Take you low  
Never get enough  
She be the one  
She be the bomb  
Watch out here she come  
  
She be the one  
She be the drug  
She gonna take you high  
Take you low  
Never get enough  
She be the one  
She be the bomb  
Watch out here she comes  
You know you gonna  
Get some
