Ive got some records here  
To put you in the mood  
The phone is off the hook  
So no one can intrude  
I feel romantic  
And the record changes automatic baby  
Sweetheart we hurried through the dinner  
And we hurried through the dance  
We left before the picture show was through  
Why did we hurry through the dinner  
And hurry through the dance
