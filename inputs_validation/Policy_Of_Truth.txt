You had something to hide  
Should have hidden it shouldnt you  
Now youre not satisfied  
With what youre being put through  
  
Its just time to pay the price  
For not listening to advice  
And deciding in your youth  
On the policy of truth  
  
Things could be so different now  
It used to be so civilised  
You will always wonder how  
It could have been if youd only lied  
  
Its too late to change events  
Its time to face the consequence  
For delivering the proof  
In the policy of truth  
  
Never again  
Is what you swore  
The time before  
Never again  
Is what you swore  
The time before  
  
Now youre standing there tongue tied  
Youd better learn your lesson well  
Hide what you have to hide  
And tell what you have to tell  
Youll see your problems multiplied  
If you continually decide  
To faithfully pursue  
The policy of truth  
  
Never again  
Is what you swore  
The time before
