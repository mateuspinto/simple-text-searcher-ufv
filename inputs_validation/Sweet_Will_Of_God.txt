My stubborn will at last hath yielded  
I would be Thine and Thine alone  
And this the prayer my lips are bringing  
Lord let in me Thy will be done  
  
Chorus  
Sweet will of God still fold me closer  
Til I am wholly lost in Thee  
Sweet will of God still fold me closer  
Til I am wholly lost in Thee  
  
Im tired of sin footsore and weary  
The darksome path hath dreary grown  
But now a light has risn to cheer me  
I find in Thee my Star my Sun  
  
Chorus  
  
Thy precious will O conquring Savior  
Doth now embrace and compass me  
The storms have ceased my peace a river  
My soul a prisoned bird set free  
  
Chorus
