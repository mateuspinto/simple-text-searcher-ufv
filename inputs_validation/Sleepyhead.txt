And you said  
It was like fire around the brim  
Burning solid  
Burning thin the burning rim  
Like stars burning holes right through the dark  
Flicking fire like saltwater in my eyes  
You were one inch from the edge of this bed  
I drag you back a sleepyhead sleepyhead  
  
Instrumental  
  
They couldnt think of something to say the day you burst  
With all their lions and all their might and all their thirst  
They crowd your bedroom like some thoughts wearing thin  
Against the walls against your rules against your skin  
My beard grew down to the floor and out the doors  
Of your eyes but go in disguise like a sleepyhead sleepyhead  
  
Instrumental
