Nothing is forever  
Always is a dream  
Life goes by so fast  
You try to make it last  
The future turns to past  
And summer turns to snow  
Ohhh  
Ohhh  
  
Nothing is forever  
I will understand  
If you want me for tonight  
Just come and hold me tight  
And with the morning light  
If summer turns to snow  
You can go  
Ohhh  
Ohhh  
  
Now here I am wanting you  
Yes here I am wanting to  
  
For a lifetime or a day  
Or just the month of May  
Well its easier to stay  
Knowing you can go  
Ohhh  
Ohhh  
  
And nothing is forever  
Nothing is forever
