By Willie Dickson  
  
Could be spoonful of diamonds  
Could be spoonful of gold  
But I want a spoon ot your precious love  
To satisfy my soul  
  
Chorus  
Men lies about it  
Some are wild about it  
Some dies without it  
Everythings right about spoonful  
That spoon that spoon that spoonful  
That spoon that spoon that spoonful  
  
Could be spoonful of coffee  
Could be spoonful of tea  
But I want a spoon of your precious love  
Thats good enough for me  
  
Chorus  
Men lies about it  
Some are wild about it  
Some dies without it  
Everythings right about spoonful  
That spoon that spoon that spoonful  
That spoon that spoon that spoonful  
  
Could be a spoonful of water  
Searching from the desert sand  
But just a spoon of that fortifies  
Saved you from another man  
  
Chorus  
Men lies about it  
Some are wild about it  
Some dies without it  
Everythings right about spoonful  
That spoon that spoon that spoonful  
That spoon that spoon that spoonful
