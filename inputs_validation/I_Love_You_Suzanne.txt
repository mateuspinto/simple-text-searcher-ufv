You broke my heart and you made me cry  
You said that I couldnt dance  
But now Im back to let you know  
That I can really make romance  
You do what you gotta do  
You do everything you can  
You do what you want to do  
Hey but I love you Suzanne  
You do anything once  
You try anything twice  
You so what you gotta do  
Hey but I love you Suzanne hey hey  
Do what you want to do  
You do what you can  
You do what you want to do  
But I love you Suzanne  
I love you when youre good  
Baby I love you when youre bad  
You do what you gotta do  
Hey but I love you Suzanne  
Do what you want to do  
Hey baby do what you can  
You do what you want to do baby  
But I love you Suzanne  
I know you try anything once baby  
You try anything twice  
Do what you gotta do  
But I love you Suzanne
