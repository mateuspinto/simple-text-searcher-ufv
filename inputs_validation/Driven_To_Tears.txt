How can you say that your not responsible  
What does it have to do with me  
What is my reaction  
What should it be  
Confronted by this latest atrocity  
Driven to tears  
Driven to tears  
Driven to tears  
  
Hide my face in my hands shame wells in my throat  
My comfortable existence is reduced  
To a shallow meaningless party  
Seems that when some innocents die  
All we can offer them is a page in a some magazine  
Too many camras and not enough food  
Cause this is what weve seen  
Driven to tears  
Driven to tears  
Driven to tears  
  
Protest is futile  
Nothing seems to get through  
Whats to become of our world  
Who knows what to do  
Driven to tears  
Driven to tears  
Driven to tears  
Driven to tears  
Driven to tears  
Driven to tears
