Its a beautiful day in the neighborhood  
Alls well that ends well  
Outside watering their lawn and shit  
Birds are chirping dogs are barking  
Its beautiful  
That may be your hood but this is my hood  
  
Got the red dogs trippin and these niggas still snitchin  
The old lady across the street still bitchin  
Its 3 in the mornin take your old ass to sleep  
The third time shes called the police this week  
Lookin at my Franck Muller its about that time  
Your folks just left so Im on my grind  
Said you wanna twofifty cause you need that nine  
I want that bread but I dont need that dime  
Charger fresh out the shop with that suicide doors  
Swear I died and came back alive  
With 22 inches all under the frame  
Keep my pocket full of bread you niggas know the name  
  
Chorus  
Jeezy like to drink  
Jeezy like to smoke  
Jeezy like to mix arm and hammer with his coke  
Jeezy at the trap  
Jeezy like to grind  
Jeezy bout his paper  
Cause Jeezy like to shine  
  
Sold those squares yeah I cooked them ohs  
Guilty as charged yeah I rock them shows  
I cant even lie yeah I fucked them hoes  
Trapped all day spent it all on clothes  
Shop all day till the mall is clothed  
Come back to the trap get my pockets swoll  
Fruitopia smoke blueberry  
Mix it with the purp we call it cranberry  
The Bin Laden clips yeah they came with the chopper  
Got a slick mouth I hope you came with a doctor  
The boy stacks cheese like it came with the whopper  
Stay fly like I came in a chopper  
  
Chorus  
  
Aint shit shakin but the leaves in the trees  
Between me and you I got a deal on the Kis  
Six in one run laid a mil on the trees  
Hit the broad every night keep a plug on the white  
Mr 175 you niggas know the name  
Why yall playin yall know it aint a game  
This is me motherfucker why would I ever change  
120 carats you niggas see the chain  
Im a bathing ape fanatic  
Red monkey junkie  
Glass pots on the stove got the kitchen smellin funky  
Sold a million records but I still flip them blocks  
On the TV every day but Im still pop them glocks  
  
Chorus
