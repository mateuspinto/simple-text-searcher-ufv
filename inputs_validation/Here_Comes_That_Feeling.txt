Up in the morning  
Politely yawning  
Theres frost on the roof of the car  
First cigarette puffs  
Gold links in my cuffs  
Egg on the shirt of my heart  
  
Fingerprints in the dust with my name  
Squint my eyes to see from my fame  
Spot the words that fall from my lines  
The deafness hides the light from the blind  
  
Stop starting journey  
The road returns me  
Back to the world in the evening  
The stage rehearsals  
Voice on the circles  
Blah blah my way to the ceiling  
  
I cant see the walls from the chairs  
Are there people sitting out there  
Feed me with a frown or a laugh  
Featureless the faces that ask  
  
Tonight Im cracking  
Im murder acting  
Footlight the visual of my lines  
Ill smoke and drink it  
Ill eat and think it  
Miserable the murder plot unwinds
