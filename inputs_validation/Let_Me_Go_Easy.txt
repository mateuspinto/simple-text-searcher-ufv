Come pleasure me again Im so tired of digging in  
Ive done my share dont need to win just let me go easy  
For two years my body fights At this point it dont seem right  
Just to do it out of spite and keep hanging on  
Go on let me go easy  
Wont you let me go easy you let me go right now  
I see the numbers dwindling of my enemies and of my friends  
And still I know it never ends so Im passing you this torch  
Fight the greed and the federals Fight the need and the toxic spills  
Drink from that wishing well but may it never quench your thirst  
Let me go easy  
Go on let me go easy Wont you let me go easy you let me go right now  
Let me go easy  
Go on let me go easy Wont you let me go easy you let me go right now  
So when you get to Ladenville fore the tears the fare thee wells for a
moment stand real still and youll me moving on  
You go ahead with your plans you wont be seeing me again but youll feel me
in the hand the hand that holds the plough  
Let me go easy  
Go on let me go easy Wont you let me go easy you let me go right now  
Let me go easy  
Go on let me go easy Wont you let me go easy you let me go right now
