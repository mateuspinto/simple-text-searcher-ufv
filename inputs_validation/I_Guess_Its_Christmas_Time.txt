Feel the magic in the air  
Christmas is all around  
Something about this special time of year  
A blanket of snow falls down from the sky  
Voices of angels  
Open our hearts so we can open our arms  
  
Chorus  
And well all join hands  
To celebrate the goodness  
That shines inside of everyone  
It must have been a part of some great design  
Guess its Christmas time  
  
Seein the faces of the little boys and girls  
Singing their First Noel  
A sweet refrain heard all around the world  
A song of forgiveness comforting peace  
A time to remember what life really means Life really means  
The important things Important things  
  
Chorus  
  
Guess its Christmas time  
Open our hearts so we can open our arms  
  
Chorus  
  
Must have been a part of some great design  
Guess its Christmas time  
Merry Christmas
