When I was a little girl I had a rag doll  
The only doll Ive ever owned  
Now I love you just the way I loved that rag doll  
But only now my love has grown  
And it gets stronger in every way  
And it gets deeper let me say  
And it gets higher day by day  
  
Do I love you my oh my  
River deep mountain high  
If I lost you would I cry  
Oh how I love you baby baby baby baby  
  
When you were a young boy did you have a puppy  
That always followed you around  
Well Im gonna be as faithful as that puppy  
No Ill never let you down  
Cause it goes on and on like a river flows  
And it gets bigger baby and heaven knows  
And it gets sweeter baby as it grows  
  
Do I love you my oh my  
River deep mountain high  
If I lost you would I cry  
Oh how I love you baby baby baby baby  
  
I love you baby like a flower loves the spring  
And I love you baby like a robin loves to sing  
And I love you baby like a schoolboy loves his bag  
And I love you baby river deep mountain high
