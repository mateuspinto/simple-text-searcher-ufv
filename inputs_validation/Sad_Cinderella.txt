When the bandits have stolen your jewelry and gone  
and your crippled young gypsy hes grown tall and strong  
and your dead misconceptions have proven you wrong  
well then princess where you plannin to turn to  
when your magazine memory has spun you around  
and you realize your lovers were just painted clowns  
and outside your window you start hearing sounds  
where theyre building a cross for to burn you  
  
when all your bright scarlet turn slowly to blue  
will you stop and decide that its over  
  
When your teardrops go sour and no longer fall  
the splash cross the virgin that lives down your hall  
and spends all her nights with an ear to your wall  
well then what will you have you can offer  
When the firedancers finish and leave you alone  
with nothing but embers and sacks full of stone  
that hang round your neck slicing through to the bone  
will there still be place for your laughter  
  
As your shattered illusions come atumblin home  
and all of the butchers youve nourished have grown  
and they are suddenly able to leave you alone  
and they run like slaves that are set free  
when your questions are answered and your pleading is done  
and your mind starts to screaming that you aint the one  
that once dwelled within you will you turn will you run  
Then princess will you come home and get me
