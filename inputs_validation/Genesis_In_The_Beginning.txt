In the beginning there was nothingness and God but waved his hand  
And from the endless void there sprang the beauty of the land  
And high above the canyon walls the diamond stars were new  
And breezes blew from nothingness and herbs and grasses grew  
And silent creatures roamed the Earth and multiplied their Do7kind  
And man was but a molecule that God had left behind  
  
Chorus  
We have grown we have grown we have captured the throne  
Of the kingdom God made for our winning  
We have grown we have grown but our children alone  
Have so little time left for beginning  
  
And mountains sprang and chaos rang the overture of life  
And rivers coursed the twisted blade of natures sharpest knife  
And cut beneath the rolling dales a gateway to the sea  
While tidal waves and mighty gales were heard in symphony  
And sunshine fell upon the waves and warmed the virgin land  
And from the mud a drop of blood was left upon the sand  
  
Chorus  
And eagles flew from craggy peaks above the garden wall  
The drop of blood became a man the tree of life grew tall  
And perfect in his loneliness a rib pulled from his chest  
Formed a sweet companion of pulchritude and breast  
And from the tree of knowledge God said they could not eat  
And perfect was their paradise unto the serpent at their feet  
  
Chorus  
Tree of knowledge tree of death upon the ground they trod  
The serpent said your eyes will see and ye will be a god  
Defy the word and eat the fruit and ye will never die  
And you will chart your destiny and rule the Earth and sky  
And man was banished east of Eden See what we have lost  
For though the father sets the price the children pay the cost  
  
Chorus
