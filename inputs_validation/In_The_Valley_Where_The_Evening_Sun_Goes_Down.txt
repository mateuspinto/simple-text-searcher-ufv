When white clouds go sailin  
To make my wedding gown  
Then well go trailin  
To the valley where the evening sun goes down  
  
And hidden away in the gloamin  
When leaves are turning brown  
Well end our roaming  
In the valley where the evening sun goes down  
  
Well build a home in our valley there  
And watch it grow into a town  
And you can sit in your rockin chair  
And watch the evening sun go down  
The evening sun go down
