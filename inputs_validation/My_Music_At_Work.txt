Everything is bleak  
Its the middle of the night  
Youre all alone and  
The dummies might be right  
You feel like a jerk  
My music at work  
My music at work  
  
Avoid trends and cliches  
Dont try to be up to date  
And when the sunlight gets the olive oil  
Dont hesitate  
The nights so long it hurts  
My music at work  
In a symbol to near or far  
Or the anatomy of a stain  
To determine where you are  
In a sink full of ganges Id remain  
No matter what you heard  
My music at work  
My music at work  
My music at work  
  
I call it Olga Waits  
The cloud that entertains  
The dim possibility of  
Showing some restraint  
The rain came down berserk  
My music at work  
My music at work  
  
On a star beyond the chart  
Or the dark side of a drop of rain  
Determining where you are  
In a sink full of ganges I remain  
No matter what you heard  
My music at work  
My music at work  
My music at work  
  
Everything is bleak  
Its the middle of the night  
Youre all alone and  
The dummies might be right  
Outside the darkness lurks  
My music at work  
My music at work  
  
Hey fallen hummingbird  
My music at work  
From the middle of the earth  
My music at work  
Bound for bed without dessert  
My music at work  
My music at work  
My music at work
