I got two black eyes  
A nasty cut on my nose  
A real funny feeling  
From my head to my toes  
But does she care  
No she dont care  
No she dont care  
But she loves me just the same  
  
Blind date overweight  
Made me late I couldnt navigate  
Red wine white wine  
Rise and shine I got to draw the line  
  
Black jack clap trap  
Any kind of flap trap  
Big mac lookin back  
Diggin burt bacharach oh  
  
Were in a black limousine  
And onto a plane  
Into the hotel  
Missin breakfast again  
But does she care  
No she dont care  
No she dont care  
But she loves me just the same  
  
Contemplate my watergate  
Two and eight I didnt hesitate  
Day time night time  
Underline I gotta draw the line  
  
Blackjack clap trap  
Any kind of flap trap  
Big mac lookin back  
Diggin burt bacharach oh
