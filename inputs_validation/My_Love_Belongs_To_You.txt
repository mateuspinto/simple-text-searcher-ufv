My nights belong to the sandman  
Cause I sure like a dream  
My mornings belong to the wildwoods  
Cause I like to hear the birds sing  
My soul belongs to heaven  
My feet belong to my shoes  
Oh but baby my love belongs to you  
My thoughts belong on tomorrow  
Cause today is all but gone  
My memories belong on yesterday  
Cause I like to recall  
My wishes belong upon a star  
Cause I believe they come true  
But baby my love belongs to you  
My love belongs to you  
You and only you  
These words are my heart talking  
Believe me girl theyre true  
Oh my wishes belong upon a star  
Cause I believe they come true  
Oh but my baby my love belongs to you  
But baby my love belongs to you
