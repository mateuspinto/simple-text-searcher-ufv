Olivia NewtonJohn  
Do you feel the way I do  
Tell me now oh tell me now  
I need to know that its true  
Oh do you feel the way I do  
I need to know  
Do you love me the way that I love you  
Tell me now oh tell me now  
I need to know that its true  
Oh do you feel the way I do  
I need to know  
The world is a wonderful place  
It spins around and spins around  
And spins around in space  
The world has a magic about it  
The stars above are like my love  
You never need to doubt it  
Oh are we real or is this a dream  
Tell me now oh tell me now  
Is it all that it seems  
Oh do you feel the way I do  
I need to know  
The world is a wonderful place  
It spins around and spins around  
And spins around in space  
The world has a magic about it  
And though I try theres so much I  
Will never know about it  
Oh do you feel the way I do  
Tell me now oh tell me now  
I need to know that its true  
Oh do you feel the way I do  
I need to know  
I need to know  
Do you feel the same way  
Do you feel the same way that I do  
Do you feel like I do  
I need to know  
I need to know  
Do you feel like I do
