All I know is something like a bird within her sang  
All I know she sang a little while and then flew on  
Tell me all that you know Ill show you snow and rain  
  
If you hear that same sweet song again will you know why  
Anyone who sings a tune so sweet is passin by  
Laugh in the sunshine sing cry in the dark fly through the night  
  
Dont cry now dont you cry dont you cry anymore  
Sleep in the stars dont you cry dry your eyes on the wind  
  
All I know is something like a bird within her sang  
All I know she sang a little while and then flew off  
Tell me all that you know Ill show you snow and rain
