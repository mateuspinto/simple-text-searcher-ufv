Sit down on that stool hear the cant of a fool  
And a strange tale Ill tell to ye  
Of a time that I lived at the buff of a hill  
Neath the burial chambers you see  
One Saturday night I get up on me bike  
For to go to a dance in the town  
I set off at seven to be there for eleven  
No thought of the rain comin down  
I pushed up the hill the rain started to spill  
So for shelter I had to resort  
Helterskelter I went as downhill I sped  
To the trees at the old fairy fort  
I pulled up me bike be a tree in the gripe  
To find shelter out of the storm  
The rain it came down and like stones beat the ground  
It was grand to be dry in that storm  
I was dreamin away about better days  
When a voice it says Dirty old night  
I fell over me bike I got such a fright  
When the ghostly voice bid me the night  
But you jumped up with a start gave the storm not a thought  
As the hail beat a rhythm on me  
And I stared at the tree that had spoken to me  
Not a body was there I could see  
I trembled and shook the tree twisted and booked  
As the wind got into a scream  
And I grabed for me bike in that devils owned night  
Expecting to wake from a dream  
The voice I had heard not another word said  
As the hair on the head stood on me  
And I said an Our Father as I peddled much faster  
Away from that ghost haunted tree  
For weeks and weeks after with nerves a disaster  
Nowhere near that road would I go  
And from dusk through the night I would shake with the fright  
Of the tree that had haunted me so  
Now whenever I go to a dance in the town  
I make sure not to stop on the way  
To be there for eleven I still leave at seven  
But I go be a different way
