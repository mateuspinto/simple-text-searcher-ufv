Disciples to Jesse Never say die  
Never say die no  no  
Never say die no more  
  
Never say die  
Never say die no  no  
Never say die my boy  
  
Judah to Jesse Where will we go from here  
My Neon One  
Or will we wander from now on  
Is there a promised land we hear  
Of ever Neon sun  
Take us all down to you Heaven  
My pagan son  
  
Lead us a thousand years  
Red rising sun  
Stoned wilderness  
And give us love  
You blew a breath into our ears  
With your dying dove  
Are we all hellbound forever  
My heathen son  
  
Disciples to Jesse Never say die  
Never say die no  no  
Never say die no more  
  
Judah to Jesse Never say die  
Never say die no  no  
Never say die my boy  
But where do we go from here  
We really want to know  
It is down down down down  
Or is it our Neon God
