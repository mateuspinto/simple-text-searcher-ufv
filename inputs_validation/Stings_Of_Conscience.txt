Left you on your own  
Your own blood  
Your lesson for living  
Pointed yourself in the wrong direction  
Abandoned for your actions  
Crucified for wrong decisions made  
Full circle of friends lost  
Due to ignorance and fear  
  
Now left only stranded family to lead you  
Through your darkest day  
  
This cant wait anymore for your love  
This cant wait anymore for your love  
Answer why your blood has been betrayed  
Answer why he was left for dead  
Now sticken by deaths grip  
Only few supporters stay  
  
A lesson for the black sheep  
Makes his days forever gray  
No boundaries for the love lost  
When your gone they all will brag how much  
They guided you right up until the very end  
Your torturing him when you walk away  
  
Blood has been betrayed  
Dont you close your eyes  
You just let him die  
You let him die  
  
Tomorrow comes much faster  
Than anyone can believe  
Your soul is crying anguish  
There is still time to change
