Heavy is the burden  
That brings you  
To your knees  
Lost in the confusion  
Of lifes uncertainties  
Feel youre suffocating  
With every breath you take  
Moment left remaining  
Time for you to pray  
Time for you to pray  
  
Pray for peace  
Pray for peace  
Pray for peace  
Pray for peace  
  
Whirl wind  
Shes aturning  
The rivers  
On the rise  
Suddenly surrounded  
In the middle  
Middle of her eye  
Light precedes  
The thunder trembles  
Trembles and it shakes  
The ground your feet  
Are under  
Time for you to pray  
Time for you to pray  
  
Pray for peace  
Pray for peace  
Pray for peace  
Pray for peace
