Give me a second I  
I need to get my story straight  
My friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire State  
My lover shes waiting for me just across the bar  
My seats been taken by some sunglasses asking about a scar and  
  
I know I gave it to you months ago  
I know youre trying to forget  
But between the drinks and subtle things  
The holes in my apologies you know  
Im trying hard to take it back  
So if by the time the bar closes  
And you feel like falling down Ill carry you home  
  
Tonight we are young  
So lets set the world on fire  
We can burn brighter than the sun  
  
Tonight we are young  
So lets set the world on fire  
We can burn brighter than the sun  
  
Now I know that Im not  
All that you got I guess that I I just thought  
Maybe we could find new ways to fall apart  
But our friends are back  
So lets raise a tab  
Cause I found someone to carry me home  
  
Tonight we are young  
So lets set the world on fire  
We can burn brighter than the sun  
  
Tonight we are young  
So lets set the world on fire  
We can burn brighter than the sun  
  
Carry me home tonight Na na na na na na  
Just carry me home tonight Na na na na na na  
Carry me home tonight Na na na na na na  
Just carry me home tonight Na na na na na na  
  
The world is on my side  
I have no reason to run  
So will someone come and carry me home tonight  
The angels never arrived  
But I can hear the choir  
So will someone come and carry me home  
  
Tonight we are young  
So lets set the world on fire  
We can burn brighter than the sun  
  
Tonight we are young  
So lets set the world on fire  
We can burn brighter than the sun  
  
So if by the time the bar closes  
And you feel like falling down  
Ill carry you home tonight
