Like a thumb in a rubber glove  
Or a moonrock in the sky above  
Im thinking could it be  
Im falling in love  
Like a Chunky or a Charleston Chew  
Like shoe crab soup or chicken stew  
Like Cinderellas other shoe  
I just want to be next to you  
I wanna be I wanna to be next to you  
I wanna be I wanna be next to you  
Like a palindrome or a friend indeed  
Like wow or Tara Key  
It seems I always need remindin  
What a fool believes  
Like Horton hearing a Who  
Like everything old becoming new  
Like looking out for number two  
I just want to be next to you  
I wanna be I wanna to be next to you  
Yeah I wanna be I wanna be next to you  
Like Dr Tom like Mr Met  
Like Professor Frink like a Chia pet  
Like Eddie Bow like Bob Levito  
Like Jill Talley like Don Cheadle  
I want to be next to you x4  
Like eatin ribs with Calvin Trillin  
Like Timothy Carey in The Killing  
Like Steve Coogan and Rebecca Front  
Like Jefferson Airplane except no Grunt
