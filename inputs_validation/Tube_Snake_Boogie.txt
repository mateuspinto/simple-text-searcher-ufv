I got a girl she lives cross town  
Shes the one that really gets down  
When she boogie  
She do the tube snake boogie  
Well now boogie little baby  
Boogie woogie all night long  
  
I got a girl she lives on the block  
She kinda funky with her pink and black socks  
She likes to boogie  
She do the tube snake boogie  
Well now boogie woogie baby  
Boogie woogie all night long  
  
I got a girl she lives on the hill  
She wont do it but her sister will  
When she boogie  
She do the tube snake boogie  
Well now boogie little baby  
Boogie woogie all night long  
Blow your top blow your top blow your top
