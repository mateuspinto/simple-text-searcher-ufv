The only unforgivable thing  
Hauls itself out of bed  
Looks over my shoulder  
At the Bloodyenglishweather  
The only unforgivable thing  
Waits for me in the corner of the room  
Laughs as I clean my teeth  
Laughs as I rub at my eyes  
  
The only unforgivable thing  
Is curled up in the wardrobe with my clothes  
Sticks like chicken bones in my throat  
Ruins the ritual Sunday lunchtimes  
  
The only unforgivable thing  
Watches itself with me  
Every night on the tv  
Follows me across the park  
As I go out walking in the dark  
Waits for me in the kitchen cupboards  
  
The only unforgivable thing  
The only unforgivable thing  
  
We will close down  
Hide in the corner of the  
Lost and Found  
For to live without the ground  
Is so unsound  
Gravity would only pull us down  
  
Will no one help the boys  
Who exist only as voices  
  
I have lost the stars and the sky  
It was so that I could keep the earth  
So now Im found  
Beyond the rocketburst among the burned out fireworks  
In November  
  
The only unforgivable thing  
Is comfortable in its own skin  
Whispers Why did you do this to me  
til its just about all  
Just about all I can see  
  
The only unforgivable thing  
The only unforgivable thing  
The only unforgivable thing  
  
I did  
I did  
You did You did You did  
We did
