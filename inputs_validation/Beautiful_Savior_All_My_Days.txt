All my days I will sing this song of gladness  
Give my praise to the fountain of delights  
For in my helplessness You heard my cry  
And waves of mercy poured down on my life  
  
Beautiful Savior wonderful counselor  
Clothed in majesty Lord of history  
Youre the way the truth the life  
  
Star of the morning glorious in holiness  
Youre the risen one heavens champion  
And You reign You reign over all  
  
I will trust in the cross of my Redeemer  
I will sing of the love that never fails  
Of sins forgiven of conscience cleansed  
Of death defeated and life without end  
  
Beautiful Savior wonderful counselor  
Clothed in majesty Lord of history  
Youre the way the truth the life  
  
Star of the morning glorious in holiness  
Youre the risen one heavens champion  
And You reign You reign over all over all  
  
Wonderful counselor  
Beautiful risen one yeah  
  
Beautiful Savior wonderful counselor  
Clothed in majesty Lord of history  
Youre the way the truth the life  
  
Star of the morning glorious in holiness  
Youre the risen one heavens champion  
And You reign You reign over all  
Yes You reign over all  
  
I long to be where the praise is never ending  
Yearn to dwell over glory never fades  
Where countless worshipers will sing one song  
And cries of worthy will honour the Lamb  
  
Worthy worthy worthy
