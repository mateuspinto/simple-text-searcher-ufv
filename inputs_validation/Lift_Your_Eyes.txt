You should have let me know that I have no chance at all  
I can never be what you wanted  
Should let me know still think about us  
You told me you was on it  
Sometimes I wonder why why I even bother  
Try to pull you out boy  
Should have let me know I would lose you to the drink  
  
Chorus  
Lift your eyes lift your eyes  
Just a little higher just a little higher  
Lift those eyes look into mine  
Cause I can guide you I can guide you  
Lift those eyes lift your eyes  
I know that youre scared to death  
Running out of breath  
I can hold you hold you  
  
You should have let me know  
But you worked around the clock  
They try to live harder yeah  
You should have let me know  
But youre afraid to love me  
Youre looking like a liar  
Sometimes I wonder why why I even ask you  
But I do  
  
Chorus  
Lift your eyes lift your eyes  
Just a little higher just a little higher  
Lift those eyes look into mine  
Cause I can guide you I can guide you  
Lift those eyes lift your eyes  
I know that youre scared to death  
Running out of breath  
But I can hold you hold you
