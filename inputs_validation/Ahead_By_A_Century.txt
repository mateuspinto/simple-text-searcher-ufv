First thing wed climb a tree  
And maybe then wed talk  
Or sit silently  
And listen to our thoughts  
With illusions of someday  
Cast in a golden light  
No dress rehearsal  
This is our life  
  
And thats where the hornet stung me  
And I had a feverish dream  
With revenge and doubt  
Tonight we smoke them out  
  
You are ahead by a century  
You are ahead by a century  
You are ahead by a century  
  
Stare in the morning shroud  
And then the day began  
I tilted your cloud  
You tilted my hand  
Rain falls in real time  
And rain fell through the night  
No dress rehearsal this is our life  
  
But thats when the hornet stung me  
And I had a serious dream  
With revenge and doubt  
Tonight we smoked them out  
  
You are ahead by a century  
You are ahead by a century  
You are ahead by a century  
  
You are ahead by a century  
You are ahead by a century  
You are ahead by a century  
And disappointing you is gettin me down
