See me a big woman big woman look how you dance  
See me a big woman big woman caught in a trance  
  
Dancing on the tabletop covered up with the Easter feast  
Youre dancing for the fishermen from the very large right  
to the least  
Dancing for the slow release first the boy and then the beast  
Then the beast  
  
Burning burning with the kiss of life  
Burning burning with the kiss of life  
  
See me a big woman big woman so full of life  
See me a big woman big woman going to be my wife  
  
Watching for the different eyes they change your face they come inside  
Watch the spirits laugh and cry watch them find a place to hide  
Watch the spirits talk in tongues watch them take you for a ride  
  
Down at the ocean lies a body in the sand  
Big woman sits beside head in hand  
With heat from her skin and fire from her breath  
She blows hard she slows deep in the mouth of death  
  
Burning burning with the kiss of life  
Burning burning with the kiss of life  
Burning burning with the kiss of life
