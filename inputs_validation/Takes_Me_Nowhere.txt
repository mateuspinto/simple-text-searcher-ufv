When the day begins  
All the guilt sinks in  
And I look on the wreckage of the night  
Though I try to break free  
The cycle breaks me  
Am I ever gonna see the light  
  
All the friends Ive lost  
And the pain Ive caused  
Have never been enough just to make me stop  
The lines I draw to look at myself  
Are turning into somebody else  
  
I know how this will end  
But Im starting up again  
Turned around inside out  
Cause this way  
  
Takes me nowhere I cant cant see a way out  
Takes me nowhere I cant cant see a way out  
Takes me nowhere I cant cant see a way out  
It beats me up  
  
When I go there I know I could start again  
When I go there Oh no here we go again  
Takes me nowhere Oh no here we go again  
It beats me up  
  
Open on this scene  
A familiar dream  
Of you telling me what I already know  
Though the truth seems near  
You cant get there from here  
But you sure know where youre gonna go  
  
As the rumor wind blows  
My infamy grows  
Seeing friends above  
And I hit another low  
The picture I paint to look at myself  
Is turning into somebody else  
  
I know how this will end  
But Im starting up again  
Turned around inside out  
Cause this way  
  
But today if I change  
And stop digging my own grave  
I will try to set things right  
Cause this way
