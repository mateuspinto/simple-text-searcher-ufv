Do you feel what I feel see what I see hear what I hear  
There is a line you must draw between your dream world and reality  
Do you live my life or share the breath I breathe  
Lies feed your judgement of others  
Behold how the blind lead each other  
The philosopher  
You know so much about nothing at all  
  
Ideas that fall under shadows of theories that stand tall  
Thoughts that grow narrow upon being verbally released  
Your mind is not your own  
What sounds more mentally stimulating is how you make your choice  
So you preach about how Im supposed to be yet you dont you know your own  
Sexuality  
Lies feed your judgement of others  
Behold how the blind lead each other  
The philosopher  
You know so much about nothing at all
