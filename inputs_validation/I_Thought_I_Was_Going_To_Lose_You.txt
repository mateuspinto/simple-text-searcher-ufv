I thought that I was going to lose you  
Just for a moment you looked like slipping away  
And my only thought was to come with you  
There was no other reason to stay  
Now Im sinking in a river of happy returns  
Though Im tired I can do nothing but sigh  
For the greatest relief Im so thankful  
As I gaze at your comingback smile  
  
Lord I thought I was going to lose you  
Yes I thought I was going to lose you
