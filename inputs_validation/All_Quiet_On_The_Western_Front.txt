All quiet on the Western Front nobody saw  
A youth asleep in the foreign soil planted by the war  
Feel the pulse of human blood pouring forth  
See the stems of Europe bend under force  
  
All quiet  
All quiet  
All quiet on the Western Front  
  
So tired of this gardens grief nobody cares  
Old kin kiss the small white cross their only souvenir  
See the Prussian offense fly werent we grand  
To place the feel of cold sharp steel in their hands  
  
Its gone all quiet on the Western Front male angels sigh  
Ghosts float in a flooded trench as Germany dies  
Fever reaps the flowers of France fairhaired boys  
String the harps to Victorys voice joyous noise
