Give us this day all that you showed me  
The power and the glory  
Till my kingdom comes  
Give us this day all that you showed me  
The power and the glory  
Till my kingdom comes  
Give me all the storybook told me  
The faith and the glory  
Till my kingdom comes  
And they said that in our time  
All thats good will fall from grace  
Even saints would turn their face in our time  
And they told us that in our days  
Different words said in different ways  
Have other meanings from he who says in out time  
Give us this day all that you showed me  
And they said that in our time we would reap from their legacy  
  
We would learn from what they had seen in our time  
And they told us that in our days  
We would know what was high on high  
  
We would follow and not defy in our time  
Give us this day all that you showed me  
Faithless in faith  
We must behold the things we see  
Give us this day all that you showed me
