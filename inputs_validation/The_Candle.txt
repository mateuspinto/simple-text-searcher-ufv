From The Book of Jonah  
  
7 Years Have Gone It Can No Longer Be Left Undone  
The Candle Must Be Burn Again And Pain  
Must Follow the Unholy Flame  
So BurnBurnBurn  
And Free the Spirit From Its Chain  
  
Here I AM Blinded Again By That Flame  
In Every Candle That I Burn Burn   
I See That Same Face Return It Returns  
  
Eyes In Pain My Little Queen Are You A Dream  
In Every Candle That I Burn Burn   
I See That Same Face Return It Returns  
Solo Mike  
Time Has Come For You To Tell The Truth What Shall I Do  
Tears Are Running From Her Eyes  
If She Could Only Tell Me Why Tell Me Why  
Solo Mike  
The JonahThe Jonah  
  
In Twisted Key She Speaks A Word To Me And Then I See  
Her Face Falling Apart  
The Word Jonah Is Her Mark Shes Branded  
Solo Andy
