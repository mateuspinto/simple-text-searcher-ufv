The night is black  
7 figures walk the streets of Louviers  
Picard is one another two are priests  
And then the nuns going to  
  
The meetings held in secrecy  
Evil company full of secrecy again and again  
  
The room is dark  
Candies on the wall theyve been here before  
The christian cross is hanging high above  
The altar of GOD  
  
Madeleine is at the gate  
Hazy feeling in her brain  
As the strangers come in to  
  
The meetings held in secrecy  
Evil company full of secrecy again and again  
  
The strangers brought  
The sweetest little child but somethings wrong  
The baby cries someone here will die  
And now the nuns pray  
  
The meetings held in secrecy  
Evil company full of secrecy again and again  
  
Madeleine and the other nuns  
They hold the infant up to the cross  
As father Picard and the priests  
Approach with hammers and nails  
Theres no more to tell
