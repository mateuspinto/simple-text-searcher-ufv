When I was six I had my first lady  
When I was eight my first drink  
When I was fourteen I was speeding in the street  
What could anybody say to me  
  
Bridge  
You can call me Mister you can call me Sir  
But dont you point your finger at me  
  
Chorus  
I want a mistrial to clear my name  
I want a mistrial in front of the people  
I want a mistrial to clear my name  
I want to bring my case to the people of New York City  
  
When I was thirty my attitude was bad  
If I said differently itd be a lie  
But theres some smarts you learn down in the street  
That a college education cant buy  
  
Bridge  
  
I want a mistrial to clear my name  
I want a mistrial in front of the people  
I want a mistrial to clear my name  
I want to bring my case in front of the people at New York City  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus  
  
And I said MISTRIAL mistrial  
In front of all the people  
I said MISTRIAL mistrial  
In front of the people of New York City  
  
Mistrial  
The people of New York City  
I said mistrial  
MISTRIAL
