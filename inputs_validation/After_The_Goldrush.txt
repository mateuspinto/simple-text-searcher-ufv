Well I dreamed I saw the knights in armor coming  
Sayin something about a queen  
There were peasants singin and drummers drumming  
And the archer split the tree  
There was a fanfare blowin to the sun  
That was floating on the breeze  
Look at mother nature on the run in the nineteen seventies  
Look at mother nature on the run in the nineteen seventies  
  
I was lyin in a burned out basement  
With a full moon in my eyes  
I was hopin for a replacement  
When the sun burst through the skies  
There was a band playin in my head  
And I felt like getting high  
Thinkin about what a friend had said  
I was hopin it was a lie  
Thinkin about what a friend had said  
I was hopin it was a lie  
  
Well I dreamed I saw the silver spaceships flying  
In the yellow haze of the sun  
There were children crying and colors flying  
All around the chosen ones  
All in a dream all in a dream  
The loading had begun  
Flyin mother natures silver seed  
To a new home in the sun  
Flyin mother natures silver seed  
To a new home in the sun
