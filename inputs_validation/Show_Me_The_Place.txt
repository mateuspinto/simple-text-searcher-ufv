Show me the place where you want your slave to go  
Show me the place Ive forgotten I dont know  
Show me the place where my head is bend and low  
Show me the place where you want your slave to go  
  
Show me the place help me roll away the stone  
Show me the place I cant move this thing alone  
Show me the place where the word became a man  
Show me the place where the suffering began  
  
The troubles came I saved what I could save  
A shred of light a particle away  
But there were chains so I hastened to the hay  
There were chains so I loved you  
Like a spade  
  
Show me the place where you want your slave to go  
Show me the place Ive forgotten I dont know  
Show me the place where you want your slave to go  
  
The troubles came I saved what I could save  
A shred of light a particle away  
But there were chains so I hastened to the hay  
There were chains so I loved you like a slave  
  
Show me the place  
Show me the place  
Show me the place  
  
Show me the place help me roll away the stone  
Show me the place I cant move this thing alone  
Show me the place where the word became a man  
Show me the place where the suffering began
