Verse 1 Fabolous  
Now I hardly be parkin in the pees  
Cause the system in the sl make it shake like it got Parkinsons disease  
Bout to go back to mark it in the trees  
Watchin out for narcs in the fatigues  
And them markings on the cees  
Catch me with a bitch in Gucci Parkas and Capris  
With a set of full lips and bruise markings on her knees  
Yall gon run to the precinct start talking when I squeeze  
So I put snipers on the roof marksmen in the trees  
Fuck you I like who write ya shit  
With voice command me and my car talk like Michael Knight and Kit  
Ever since they put my face on the screen  
Fuck a box and a dash I stash my guns in the waist of my jeans  
Niggas start nonsense again  
He thinkin its sweet get shots like you on Insulin  
When I pull off the dealers lots no mileage is on it  
This bad boy move with guns with silencers on it
