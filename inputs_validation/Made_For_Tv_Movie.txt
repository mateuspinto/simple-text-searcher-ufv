I heard a word from on high  
Glare like a light in the sky it said  
quit blowing each other up  
A voicing so crystalline clear so  
Somethings unclear in your ear  
When only blood will fill your cup  
  
Hello Im trying to focus  
But my eyes deceive me  
Focus Im witnessing history repeating  
  
It fell like a tear from my eye  
Flying machine so up high well  
There goes the neighborgood  
A scene set to singe innocence  
Up heave unhinge and pit against  
Like every made for TV should  
  
Hello Im trying to focus  
But my eyes deceive me  
Focus Im witnessing history repeating  
  
Focus  
  
We are  
We know  
We see  
We think  
For you  
  
The who  
The what  
The when  
The where  
The why  
  
We build your young  
We built you too  
Wee see you all  
  
Hello Im trying to focus  
But my eyes deceive me  
Focus Im witnessing history repeating
