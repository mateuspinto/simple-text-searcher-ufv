I let you put it in my mouth  
I let it get under my skin  
I let you pump it through my veins  
I let you take me from within  
They tell us what we can and cannot do  
Same thing weve heard a hundred times before  
The way I put you inside of me  
None of that matters anymore  
  
My god can we go any faster  
Oh my god I dont think I can last here  
My god can we go any faster  
Oh my god I dont think I can last here  
  
I am you and you are me  
You will never be alone  
But I have finally found my place in everything  
I have finally found my home  
I can leave all the best behind  
I can see right through the whole facade  
I am becoming something else  
I am turning into god  
  
My god can we go any faster  
Oh my god I dont think I can last here  
My god can we go any faster  
Oh my god I dont think I can last here  
I dont think I can  
My god can we go any faster  
Oh my god I dont think I can last here  
My god can we go any faster  
Oh my god I dont think I can last here
