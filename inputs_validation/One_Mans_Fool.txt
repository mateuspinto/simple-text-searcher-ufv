As the buildings crumble tumble to the ground  
And the dustfilled smoke rises in the air  
You know that somebody somewhere looks with pride theyre satisfied  
  
To all who think they know  
To everyone that knows that theyre right  
Dyou ever wonder why  
Dyou never ask the question even in the depths of night  
  
Now as the daylight fading ends another day  
For too many life will never be the same  
And it is all for the reason they will never understand  
  
To all who think they know  
To everyone that knows that theyre right  
Dyou ever wonder why  
Dyou never ask the question even in the depths of night  
  
And on the morning after do you realize  
See the ruined faces and the ruined lives  
Inside your head do you never have the thought a moment of doubt  
  
To all who think they know  
To everyone that knows that theyre right  
Dyou ever wonder why  
Dyou never ask the question even in the depths of night  
  
There are only dreams one like any other  
What means the earth to one or few means nothing to another  
There are only dreams like any other  
  
Drawing lines upon the sand on the land on the sea  
Then dying to defend them seems quite meaningless to me  
  
Dont you know what means the earth to some or only one  
Can mean just nothing nothing nothing to another  
  
There are only dreams like any other  
There are only differences worth living but not dying for  
  
One mans joy makes another man weep  
Nothing you can do is ever gonna change it  
One mans saint is another mans fool  
One mans hot is another mans cool  
  
And when the war is over won  
Will there be peace for evermore  
  
Statues carved right out of stone out of wood made from gold  
Praying for their mercy that wont save their souls  
  
Dont you know what means the earth to some or only one  
Can mean just nothing nothing nothing to another  
  
There are only dreams like any other  
There are only hopes and beliefs one like any other there are only dreams
like any other  
Worth living but not dying for  
Living but not dying for not killing for  
There are only dreams like any other like any other  
  
To all of those who think that they know  
All I can say yes all I can say  
  
One mans joy makes another man weep  
Nothing you can do is ever gonna change it  
One mans saint is another mans fool  
One mans hot is another mans cool  
  
There are only dreams like any other  
There are only hopes and beliefs one like any other  
There are only dreams like any other
