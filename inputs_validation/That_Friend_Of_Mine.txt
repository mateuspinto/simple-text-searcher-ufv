That friend of mine wears an old work shirt  
For a long long time she has blessed this earth  
And a smile that shines even when she hurts  
O how I love that friend of mine  
That friend of mine gave her heart to me  
How sweet and kind the truth can be  
And Gods tie that binds us as family  
Oh how I love that friend of mine  
  
Shes an angel shes the answer  
The sweetest piece of heaven in my eyes  
Shes drawn to me like gravity  
Id lay down and die for that friend of mine  
  
Shes an angel shes the answer  
The sweetest piece of heaven in my eyes  
Shes drawn to me like gravity  
Id lay down and die for that friend of mine  
Id lay down and die for that friend of mine  
That friend of mine wears an old work shirt
