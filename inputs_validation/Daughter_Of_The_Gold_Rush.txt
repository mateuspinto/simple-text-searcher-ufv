Standing on solid soil  
Coping with raging wars  
Once I was young and wired  
Now I am old and tired  
  
Waiting hoping for a change  
  
Havent I seen you before  
Standing outside my door  
Racing through space and time  
Without a reason or rhyme  
  
Waiting hoping for a change  
  
Only on to open skies  
Running away  
Looking for a new way to rise  
Rolling away  
  
Standing on solid soil x3
