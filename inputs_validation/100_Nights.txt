A hundred nights of fun and games  
A thousand empty glasses  
I feel it change  
And stay the same  
As each day passes  
  
They invite me to their gatherings  
In the finer parts of town  
They seem attracted to my indifference  
The irony just knocks me out  
  
And I love them as if I love them  
And they reciprocate with help  
But I look up at these mirrors sometimes  
And I cant see myself  
  
They say that some are born to burn  
And some are born to give  
They say that people live and learn  
Some people only live and live  
  
You dont know that I come here  
But if you did you would know why  
So we close our eyes  
  
You didnt notice me  
As I passed you on the stairs  
How could you ever guess  
Looking at my face  
How closely I share your taste  
How well I know your place  
Even the clothes you wear  
Ive seen them when youre not there  
  
You say that you can win win win  
If you know how to play the game  
But while youre out there playing you see  
Theres something you should know  
She spends your money  
She spends your money on me
