He was a friend of mine  
Every time I think of him  
I just cant keep from cryin  
Cause he was a friend of mine  
  
He died on the road  
He died on the road  
He just kept on moving  
Never reaped what he could sow  
And he was a friend of mine  
  
I stole away and cried  
I stole away and cried  
Cause I never had too much money  
And I never been quite satisfied  
And he was a friend of mine  
  
He never done no wrong  
He never done no wrong  
A thousand miles from home  
And he never harmed no one  
And he was a friend of mine  
  
He was a friend of mine  
He was a friend of mine  
Every time I hear his name Lord  
I just cant keep from cryin  
Cause he was a friend of mine
