Head on my shoulder  
Tears on my shirtsleeve  
What did I say wrong  
Hurt by a gesture  
Not by reaction  
Is love saying so long  
Inside my heart  
Young young young wise people  
Young young young loud sound  
Onto the dance floor  
Out of the sadness  
Tears without tempo  
Swim in their beauty  
Swim in their upset  
The bell will ring  
For me and my girl  
Up to the altar time standing still  
When he says will you you say you will  
  
Its the proposal  
She thought shed never  
Hear on a dance floor  
Joy finds its features  
Upon her lipstick  
Kissed with an answer  
Inside my heart  
All up to day break  
All up to dropsake  
I hear a slow song  
Close gets the love ones  
Onto the dance floor  
The bells are ringing  
For me and my girl  
Nothing can alter nothing can change  
Ill go to pieces pieces of eight
