In the night when youre lonely and you cant find a word for how you feel  
Theres a place that you know of where the lights are so low theyre hardly
real  
In a chair on the front veranda is a weight with a thought to set you free  
The weight is my soul  
  
The weight is my soul come to me  
I can see through the streetlights where the evening air is turning round  
All I hear is the hangin of the moon and the stars on the sky  
In a chair on the front veranda is a weight with a thought to set you free  
  
The weight is my soul  
The weight is my soul come to me  
Have you thought of the times when your heart and your mind are free  
Have you thought of the times when your heart and your mind are free  
  
In the night when youre lonely and you cant find a word for how you feel  
Theres a place that you know of where the lights are so low theyre hardly
real  
In a chair on the front veranda is a weight with a thought to set you free  
The weight is my soul  
  
The weight is my soul come to me
