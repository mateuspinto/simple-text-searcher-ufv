Bonus track  
  
A priest caught in lust  
Is roaming the red light  
Pays to indulge his sins  
Body cry  
Each day he awakes  
And prays for forgiveness  
Our Father he cries to his God  
Set me free  
Once we may ask for forgiveness  
Someday we could see paradise  
His words echo to his disciples  
Yet again hell give in to his vice  
Caught and bound by temptation  
So ashamed of running free  
Sweet embrace captivation  
Carnal truth against out beliefs  
Deliver us  
Deliver us  
His suit hides the truth  
His business is pushing  
Supplying the kings of the street  
Rich mans pride  
Higher than high a kid passing by  
Blows off his head and escapes  
Outta sight  outta sight  
Who finds the road to redemption  
The preacher the kid or the man  
Who will decide it I wonder  
Vicious circle entangled and trapped  
Caught and bound by temptation  
So ashamed of running free  
Sweet embrace captivation  
Carnal truth against our beliefs  
Deliver us  
Deliver us  
Once we may ask for forgiveness  
Someday we could see paradise  
His words echo to his disciples  
Yet again hell give in to his vice  
Caught and bound by temptation  
So ashamed of running free  
Sweet embrace captivation  
Carnal truth against our beliefs  
Deliver us  
Deliver us  
Deliver us  
Deliver us
