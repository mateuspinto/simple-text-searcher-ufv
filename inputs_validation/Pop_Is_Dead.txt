Oh no pop is dead  
Long live pop  
It died an ugly death  
By back catalogue  
  
And know you know it gets you nowhere  
And now you know you realize  
  
Oh no pop is dead  
It just gave up  
We raise the dead but they wont stand up  
  
And radio have salmonella  
And now you know you gotta die  
It left this message for us  
  
So what pop is dead its no great loss  
So many face lifts its face flew off  
  
The Emperor he has no clothes on  
And his skin is pealing off  
  
Oh no pop is dead long live pop  
One final lot of coke to jack him off  
Jack him off He left this message for us  
  
He left this message for us  
He left this message for us
