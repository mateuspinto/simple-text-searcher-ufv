Maybe its the way she walked Wow  
Straight into my heart and stole it  
Through the doors and past the guards Wow  
Just like she already owned it  
  
I said Can you give it back to me  
She said Never in your wildest dreams  
  
And we danced all night to the best song ever  
We knew every line now I cant remember  
How it goes but I know that I wont forget her  
Cause we danced all night to the best song ever  
  
I think it went oh oh oh  
I think it went yeah yeah yeah  
I think it goes oh  
  
Said her name was Georgia Rose Wow  
And her daddy was a dentist  
Said I had a dirty mouth I got a dirty mouth  
But she kissed me like she meant it  
  
I said Can I take you home with me  
She said Never in your wildest dreams  
  
And we danced all night to the best song ever  
We knew every line now I cant remember  
How it goes but I know that I wont forget her  
Cause we danced all night to the best song ever
