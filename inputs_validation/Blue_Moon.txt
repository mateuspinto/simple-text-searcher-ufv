Blue moon  
You saw me standing alone  
Without a dream in my heart  
Without a love of my own  
  
Blue moon  
You knew just what I was there for  
You heard me saying a prayer for  
Some one I really could care for  
  
And then you suddenly appeared before me  
The only one my arms could ever hold  
I heard somebody whisper please adore me  
And when I looked the moon had turned to gold  
  
Blue moon  
Now Im no longer alone  
Without a dream in my heart  
Without a love of my own
