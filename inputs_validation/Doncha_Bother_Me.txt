I said Oh no doncha follow me no more  
I said Oh no doncha follow me no more  
Well Im looking for my face  
And I got no place to go  
  
I said Oh no doncha follow me no more  
I said Oh no doncha follow me no more  
Well pick your own mind  
And dont you touch mine no more  
  
Still waiting here for a single idea  
In your clothes and your hair  
I wore it last year  
Oh no doncha follow me no more  
  
I said Oh no doncha copy me no more  
I said Oh no doncha copy me no more  
Well the lines around my eyes  
Are protected by a copyright law  
  
Well all the clubs and the bars  
And the little red cars  
Not knowing why but trying to get high  
Oh no doncha follow me no more  
  
Doncha follow  
Doncha follow
