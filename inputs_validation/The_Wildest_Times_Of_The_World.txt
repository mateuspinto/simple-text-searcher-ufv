I have fallen I have stood up Ive had the patience of a tree  
  
You have trembled you have stayed still you have tumbled like a weed  
  
All the mountains all the deserts go for miles and miles around  
  
We have driven for years now baby just to get bak to a place we had  
  
already  
  
found  
  
Now youre driving me downtown baby on a rainy night  
  
Youre driving me crazy baby is this really life  
  
In the wildest times of the world  
  
Oh I never thought Id be here with you tonight  
  
In the wildest times of the world  
  
Lets stay together in this lonely and crazy life  
  
I was mistaken our love was forsaken the worst mistake I ever made  
  
Were you lonely were you brave now  
  
I guess the two are one and the same  
  
Now Im singing here with my sweet sweet darling in my eye  
  
Aint it funny how youre walking through life and it turns on a dime  
  
I was missing you crazy baby are you really mine  
  
In the wildest times of the world  
  
Oh I never thought Id be here with you tonight  
  
In the wildest times of the world  
  
Lets stay together in this lonely and crazy life  
  
Hey Hey Hey
