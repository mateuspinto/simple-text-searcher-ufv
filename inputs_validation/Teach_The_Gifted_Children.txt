Teach the gifted children  
Teach them to have mercy  
Teach them about sunsets  
Teach them about moonrise  
Teach them about anger  
The sin that comes with dawning  
Teach them about flowers  
And the beauty of forgetfulness  
  
Then take me to the river take me to the river  
And put me in the water and put me in the water  
Bless them and forgive them take me to the river  
Father cause they just dont know take me to the river  
  
All the gifted children  
Teach the gifted children  
The way of men and animals  
Teach them about cities  
The history of the mysteries  
Their vice and their virtues  
About branches that blow in the wind  
On the wages of their sins  
Teach them of forgiveness  
Teach them about mercy  
Teach them about music  
And the cool and cleansing waters  
  
What do they say take me to the river take me to the river  
Take me to the river take me to the river  
Put me in the water take me to the river  
And teach the gifted children take me to the river  
All the gifted children take me to the river  
Take me to the river  
Take me to the river
