Evil hearted you  
You always try to put me down  
With the things you do and words  
You spread around against me  
  
Evil hearted you  
You kept kidding me along  
With your phony smile  
And with your siren song smiling beguiling  
  
You lead me on till all hopes gone  
Persuading degrading  
On my knees I try to please  
But I love you just the same  
  
And I want you to remain by my side  
And youll see just how much you mean to me  
  
Evil hearted you  
You always try to put me down  
With the things you do and words  
You spread around against me  
  
About me  
What would you do without me  
Smiling beguiling  
You lead me on till all hope has gone
