Muriel since you left town  
The clubs closed down  
And theres one more burned out lamppost  
On Main Street  
Down where we used to stroll  
  
And Muriel  
I still hit all the same old haunts  
And you follow me wherever I go  
  
And Muriel I see you  
On a Saturday night  
In a penny arcade  
With your hair tied back  
And the diamond twinkle  
Is in your eye  
Is the only wedding ring that Ill buy you  
Muriel  
  
And Muriel how many times  
Ive left this town  
To hide from your memory  
And it haunts me  
  
But I only get as far  
As the next Whiskey bar  
I buy another cheap cigar  
And Ill see you every night  
  
Hey Muriel  
Muriel  
Hey buddy  
Got a light
