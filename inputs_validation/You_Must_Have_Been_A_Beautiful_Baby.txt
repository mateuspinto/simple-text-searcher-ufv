You must have been a beautiful baby  
You must have been a wonderful child  
When you were only starting to go to kindergarten  
I bet you drove those other childs wild  
  
And when it came to winning blue ribbons  
I bet you taught those other kids how  
I can see the judges eyes when they handed you the prize  
You had the cutest bow  
  
You mustve been a beautiful baby  
Cause baby look at you now
