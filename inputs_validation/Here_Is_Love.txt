Here is love vast as the ocean  
Loving kindness as the flood  
When the Prince of Life our Ransom  
Shed for us His precious blood  
Who His love will not remember  
Who can cease to sing His praise  
He can never be forgotten  
Throughout Heavens eternal days  
  
On the mount of crucifixion  
Fountains opened deep and wide  
Through the floodgates of Gods mercy  
Flowed a vast and gracious tide  
Grace and love like mighty rivers  
Poured incessant from above  
And Heavens peace and perfect justice  
Kissed a guilty world in love  
  
No love is higher no love is wider  
No love is deeper no love is truer  
No lover is higher no lover is wider  
No love is like Your love o Lord
