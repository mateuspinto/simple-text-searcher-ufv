Where the angels see  
You are praised as You should be  
But how can I express  
My yearning for Your Holiness  
May it be that  
  
Chorus  
I will open my heart  
Search me in the deepest part  
And I will stand in cleansing fire  
By You purified  
By You Im purified  
  
Savior of my soul  
To your strength I yield control  
Purge me of my stain  
Sin will lose its mortal reign  
Make me free and  
  
Chorus  
  
You are Holy  
You are Holy  
Yes You are Holy  
You are Holy  
You are Holy  
Holy  
  
Chorus  
  
You are Holy  
You are Holy  
Yes You are Holy  
You are Holy  
You are Holy  
Holy
