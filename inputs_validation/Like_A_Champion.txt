Tonight become alive  
Stand up cause you got the pride  
Dancing and the sweat dont dry  
Once shot so baby hit it right  
No doubt cause we young and free  
Walk like you run the city like your name in the sky  
Live it up cause baby its your time  
  
Its in the way you hold yourself  
You gotta know youre something else  
Its sure that youve never felt so sexy sexy sexy
