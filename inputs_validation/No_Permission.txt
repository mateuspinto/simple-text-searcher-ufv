Verse  
Pass me a joint guarantee Imma hit it  
Come to that life I dont talk it I live it  
I got a old school ass car you can sit in  
I got a crib that you probably cant get in  
I got a pound we can grind it and twist it  
I been at work on the grind for a minute  
Smokin that loud and still mindin my business  
She fuck with me because I got the vision  
Countin my benjis  
Puttin it all in the bank but I dont really mind if I spend it  
Cant take it Dont cross the line when you finish  
When you stay all on your grind you can get it  
When we be fuckin Im climbin up in it  
She fuck with me because I got the vision  
Haters be talkin dont mind em dont listen  
Duckin em shots thats divine intervention  
I be so high try me come visit  
You make a choice hope you like your decision  
Come to my crib we can spark and get lifted  
Go up in smoke just like Im a magician  
Aint fuck with me then she probably was trippin  
Lightin em up just like we electricians  
Get to this money get high my intentions  
Roll me one up thats as loud as the engine  
She fuck with me because I got the vision  
I fuck with her when Im talkin she listen  
When we together we stick to the mission  
Sparkin that weed up without no permission  
She fuck with me because I got the vision  
I fuck with her when Im talkin she listen  
When we together we stick to the mission  
Rollin that weed up without no permission uh  
  
Outro  
Oh oh money come and money go we stay the same though  
Oh oh money come and money go we stay the same though
