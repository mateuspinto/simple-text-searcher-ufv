Oh Louisiana I stayed away from you too long  
Oh Louisiana how can a true love go so wrong   
She put me in shame and in sorrow and I come home tomorrow  
Oh Louisiana  
Oh Louisiana yea yea Creole baby Cajun queens  
Quaint porches and windows filet de gumbo the Basin beans  
Your beautiful Delta and bayous in greens  
Oh Louisiana  
Oh Louisiana yeaee yea Im flyin on Delta Nineothree  
Right over St Louis high over Memphis Tennessee  
On southward to the sea where I long to be  
Oh Louisiana  
Oh o Louisiana yea yea them Yankee nights are cold and long  
Oh Louisiana she broke my heart and wrecked my home  
She shamed me in sorrow to face my tomorrow  
Oh take me back oh Louisiana
