Do you smoke do you drink do you yell out Hank  
Do you fold it in your pocket do you lock it in the bank  
Jack it up drop it down to the ground  
Put the juice in the goose or the Coke in the Crown  
  
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star  
Yeah you can kick it back chillin or you can rock hard  
You busted your ass all week  
And now its your time to be  
Whatever you wanna be  
You can dress to kill you can shoot to thrill  
Try to seal the deal  
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star  
  
Do you kick the dirt or work a Vegas stop  
Do you hit the strip or roll a country mile  
Do you wear em uptight or do you keep it loose  
Do you leave it in the truck or sneak it in in your boot  
  
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star  
Yeah you can kick it back chillin  
Or you can rock hard  
You busted your ass all week  
And now its your time to be  
Whatever you wanna be  
You can dress to kill you can shoot to thrill  
Try to seal the deal  
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star  
  
Now whether youre pimped up hangin in the VIP  
Or way up high in the cheapest seats  
Hey pretty mama if you roll with me  
Therell be diamonds in the sky and the radio screen  
  
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star  
Yeah you can kick back chillin or you can rock hard  
You busted your ass all week  
And now its your time to be  
Whatever you wanna be  
You can dress to kill you can shoot to thrill  
Try to seal the deal  
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star  
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star  
  
Do you smoke do you drink do you yell out Hank  
Do you fold it in your pocket do ya lock it in the bank  
  
Do you jack it up or drop it down to the ground  
Put the juice in the goose or the Coke in the Crown  
  
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star  
Whatever makes you feel like a rock star
