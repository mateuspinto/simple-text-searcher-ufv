In the days of Noah before the Lord  
When the wicked had all forgotten God  
Brother Noah built a boat which above  
Gods wrath did float  
  
And the people saw that they were made of mud  
As the doors swang open and gang plank standing out  
Noah and his family entered with a shout  
As the scorners stretched their necks  
  
Noah stepped out on the deck  
Saying Im so glad Im on the inside looking out  
  
Chorus  
Oh Id rather be on the inside looking out  
Than to be on the outside looking in  
When the rain began to fall sinners on the  
Lord did call  
The door was shut and night was setting in  
Then old Noah from the window looking out  
Gazed to heaven beyond the water spout  
And he said I thank the Lord that I took Him  
at His word  
Im so glad Im on the inside looking out  
  
Good old Daniel lived in Babylon long ago  
And he had the grace to tell the devil no  
Though he prayed three times a day in the  
Good old fashioned way  
  
They said he to the lions den must go  
And lions made him welcomed to their home  
For they knew he was nothing but backbone  
When the king looked in and said Are you  
  
Alive or are you dead  
He was stirred as Daniel spoke in gentle tones
