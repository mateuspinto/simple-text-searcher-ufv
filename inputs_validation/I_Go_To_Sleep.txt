When I look up from my pillow  
I dream you are there with me  
Though you are far away  
I know youll always be near to me  
  
I go to sleep sleep  
And imagine that youre there with me  
I go to sleep sleep  
And imagine that youre there with me  
  
I look around me  
And feel you are ever so close to me  
Each tear that flows from my eye  
Brings back memories of you to me  
  
I go to sleep sleep  
And imagine that youre there with me  
  
I go to sleep sleep  
And imagine that youre there with me  
  
I was wrong I will cry  
I will love you till the day I die  
You were all you alone and no one else  
You were meant for me  
  
When morning comes again  
I have the loneliness you left me  
Each day drags by  
Until finally my time descends on me  
  
I go to sleep sleep  
And imagine that youre there with me  
I go to sleep sleep  
And imagine that youre there with me
