Ah tom is young and tom is bold  
Tom is as bold as the knights of old  
But whenever he gets in a bit of a jam  
Theres nothing he wont do to get a harry rag  
  
Harry rag harry rag  
Do anything just to get a harry rag  
And he curses himself for the life hes led  
And rolls himself a harry rag and puts himself to bed  
  
Ah toms old ma is a dying lass  
Soon they all reckon shell be pushing up the grass  
And her bones might ache and her skin might sag  
But still shes got the strength to have a harry rag  
  
Harry rag harry rag  
Do anything just to get a harry rag  
And she curses herself for the life shes led  
And rolls herself a harry rag and puts herself to bed  
  
Ah bless you tax man bless you all  
You may take some but you never take it all  
But if I give it all I wont feel sad  
As long as I got enough to buy a harry rag  
  
Harry rag harry rag  
Do anything just to get a harry rag  
And I curse myself for the life Ive led  
And roll myself a harry rag and put myself to bed  
  
Ah the smart young ladies of the land  
Cant relax without a harry in their hand  
And they light one and they boast and brag  
So content because they got a harry rag  
  
Harry rag harry rag  
Do anything just to get a harry rag  
And theyll light one and theyll boast and brag  
So content because they got a harry rag  
  
Harry rag harry rag  
Ill do anything just to get a harry rag  
And I curse myself for the life Ive led  
And roll myself a harry rag and put myself to bed
