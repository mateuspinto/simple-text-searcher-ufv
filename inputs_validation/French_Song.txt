A little girl  
Goes out walking in the night  
A little boy  
Calls Good evening  
From the light  
They stop to talk for just a while  
Then shes gone  
  
A little girl  
Sits beside her window pane  
Thinking about an evening in the rain  
A little talk a little boy  
Then shes gone  
  
A little girl  
Goes out walking  
Once again  
A little boy  
Finds that he has done the same  
They stop to talk for just a while  
Then theyre gone
