We could be so good together  
Ya so good together  
We could be so good together  
Ya we could I know we could  
Tell you lies  
I tell you wicked lies  
Tell you lies  
Tell you wicked lies  
Tell you bout the world that well invent  
Wanton world without lament  
Enterprise expedition  
Invitation and invention  
Ya so good together  
Ah so good together  
We could be so good together  
Ya we could know we could  
Alright  
Do da do do do do do bup bup de day  
We could be so good together  
Ya so good together  
We could be so good together  
Ya we could know we could  
Tell you lies  
Tell you wicked lies  
Tell you lies  
Tell you wicked lies  
The time you wait subtracts the joy  
Beheads the angels you destroy  
Angels fight angels cry  
Angels dance and angels die  
Ya so good together  
Ah but so good together  
We could be so good together  
Ya we could know we could
