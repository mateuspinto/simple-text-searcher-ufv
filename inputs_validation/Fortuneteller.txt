Cast your eyes into the crystal  
Deep inside the mystery  
Is that a vision of a lonely man  
I fear it looks a lot like me  
Is that a man without a woman  
Whose empty life is but a shell  
Empty hearts will echo  
Forever in the wishing well  
  
Fortuneteller  
Youve got to help me find an end to the nightmare  
Cause I cant stand this pain and the curse of time  
Somewhere in your eyes Ill find the answer  
Give me the truth Ive been looking for  
Be my guiding light Ill take my chances  
Turn the card seal my fate close the door  
  
Some days come with a vengeance  
Some days I feel so bad  
The mirror holds no secrets  
I lost the best thing that I had  
  
Fortuneteller  
Can you help me to see is there an end to the sorrow  
Or was this slow ride to nowhere always meant to be  
Somewhere in your eyes Ill find the answer  
Give me the truth Ive been looking for  
Be my guiding light Ill take my chances  
Turn the card seal my fate close the door  
  
She always taking more than shed need  
But we were both to blame somehow  
In the heat of the moment I told her to leave  
I guess I lost more than I found  
But I remember
