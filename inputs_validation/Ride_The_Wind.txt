Hearts of fire  
Streets of stone  
Modern warriors  
Saddle iron horses of chrome  
  
Taste the wild  
Lick the wind  
Like something they never saw before  
Their jaws dropping to the floor  
Steel made of soul and sin  
  
Rebels born without a care  
And the day he listens  
Only to fly where eagles dare  
And the night she whispers  
  
Chorus  
Ride the wind  
Never coming back until I touch the midnight sun  
Ride the wind  
Never coming back again  
Ride the wind  
Never coming back until I touch the midnight sun  
  
Painted flesh  
Loyalty  
Humble pride  
Just as far as the eye can see  
  
Stories told  
Two old friends  
Of battle scars and lonely bars  
And nights the rain wouldnt end  
  
Heres to withered eyes wearing gypsy smiles  
And the day he listens  
Heres to lovely ladies and a million miles  
And the night she whispers  
  
Chorus  
  
Ride the wind  
Im still the bravest soul in sin  
Burning till the night is done  
  
Of all the truths and lies  
And stories of riders in the sky  
They say only the bravest try  
Where eagles and angels dare to fly  
  
Chorus
