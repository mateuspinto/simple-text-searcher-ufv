Verse  
You knew me before I was born  
You knew every mistake that I would make  
You chose me to walk by your side  
You even knew the path that I would take  
Everyday I live for You  
I want to get to know you more and more  
The things I feel inside my heart  
Can only come from knowing more of You  
  
Chorus  
You have brought Your Love into my life  
Now I live each day within Your light  
Hopelessly Ive fallen for You  
Your love surrounds me everyday I live for You  
You have brought Your freedom in my life  
Youre teaching me to shine a little light  
In every situation You are guiding me coz  
Everyday I live for You
