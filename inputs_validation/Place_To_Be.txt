When I was younger younger than before  
I never saw the truth hanging from the door  
And now Im older see it face to face  
And now Im older gotta get up clean the place  
  
And I was green greener than the hill  
Where the flowers grew and the sun shone still  
Now Im darker than the deepest sea  
Just hand me down give me a place to be  
  
And I was strong strong in the sun  
I thought Id see when day is done  
Now Im weaker than the palest blue  
Oh so weak in this need for you
