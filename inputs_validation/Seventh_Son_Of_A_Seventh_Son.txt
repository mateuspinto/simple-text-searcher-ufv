Here they stand brothers them all  
All the sons divided theyd fall  
Here await the birth of the son  
The seventh the heavenly the chosen one  
  
Here the birth from an unbroken line  
Born the healer the seventh his time  
Unknowingly blessed and as his life unfolds  
Slowly unveiling the power he holds  
  
Seventh son of a seventh son  
Seventh son of a seventh son  
Seventh son of a seventh son  
  
Then they watch the progress he makes  
The Good and the Evil which path will he take  
Both of them trying to manipulate  
The use of his powers before its too late  
  
Seventh son of a seventh son  
Seventh son of a seventh son  
Seventh son of a seventh son  
  
Today is born the seventh one  
Born of woman the seventh son  
And he in turn of a seventh son  
He has the power to heal  
He has the gift of the second sight  
He is the chosen one  
So it shall be written  
So it shall be done
