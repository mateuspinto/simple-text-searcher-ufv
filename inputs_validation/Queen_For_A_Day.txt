Queen for a day queen for a night  
Dressed head to toe so youd never know its me its me  
  
Ribbons and lace shoes made of glass  
Rouge on my face off to the dance  
To dance  
  
To dance and dance and dance and dance  
Queen for a day queen for a day  
  
Queen for a day queen for a night  
Just time to find the man who could be so right  
  
Queen for a day ribbons and lace  
Shoes made of glass rouge on my face  
  
To dance and dance and dance and dance  
And dance the night away

Gonna be a queen for a day  
Want to dance the night away  
What Id give to be a queen for a day  
Gonna dance and dance and dance  
Gonna dance and dance and dance

Just time to find the man who could be

Ribbons and lace suit me just fine
