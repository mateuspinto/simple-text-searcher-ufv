Down at the house with the red light  
She works from seven til dawn  
Youll find her there any time that you like  
Some days a week shell be on  
Down at the house with the red light  
  
I was a boy not to sure of myself  
When I was first taken down  
Down to the house with the red light  
Two miles west of town  
I paid my fee and I went on in  
  
Into the house with the red light  
Pull up a chair up the stairs  
The key was cold and dampened my hand  
Opened the door heard her say  
Into my room and set yourself down  
  
She let us lie on this shiny brass bed  
Curtains and flowers in her hair  
She played my soul and she shattered my head  
Could not believe I was there  
Down at the house with the red light  
  
I fell in love with that lady  
First love I knew she gave me  
Seven days a week you can find her  
Down at the house with the red light  
  
I fell in love with that lady
