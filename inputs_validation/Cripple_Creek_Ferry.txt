Hey hey Cripple Creek ferry  
Butting through the overhanging trees  
Make way for the Cripple Creek ferry  
The waters going down its a mighty tight squeeze  
  
All alone the captain stands  
Hasnt heard from his deck hands  
The gambler tips his hat and walks towards the door  
Its the second half of the cruise  
And you know he hates to lose  
  
Hey hey Cripple Creek ferry  
Butting through the overhanging trees  
Make way for the Cripple Creek ferry  
The waters going down its a mighty tight squeeze
