Well I found a bunch of letters  
That were written for the fellow who broke your mommas heart  
And the envelope folds smelled of her ancient perfume  
Ill bet she didnt know  
How to respond before the blankets of snow  
Caught him out wandering alone  
With no place to go  
  
There were stars in the sky  
There were houses on the hill  
And there bottles of pills that were easy to buy  
To keep her warm from the oncoming storm  
  
Well I found them in the northwest corner of the attic in a box  
Labeled tinsel and lights  
Didnt know what I was I looking for  
Maybe just a blanket or artifacts  
Eisenhower sent him to war  
He kept her picture in his pocket that was closest to his heart  
And when he hit shore  
Must have been a target for the gunman  
  
There were stars in the sky  
There were bunkers on the hill and there were caskets to fill  
Where he will lie  
Shrouded in the red white and blue with the stripes  
  
There were stars in the sky  
There were houses on the hill  
And there were bottles of pills that were easy to buy  
To keep her warm from the oncoming storm
