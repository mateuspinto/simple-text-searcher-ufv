What is broken or ready to break  
Who is asleep and who stays awake  
Who lives with all of memorys ache  
  
Who has gone and who stayed still  
Who looked back and who never will  
Who is empty who can fill  
  
Who is blind and who reflects  
Who has sworn and who defects  
Who can sleep and who protects  
  
Who has made it all so clear  
Who has lost and who will cheer  
Who kept still erased the tear  
  
If not you  
Who will do  
Who will do for you if not you  
  
Be strong be strong  
Lift your chin up high  
That way your tears go no further than your cheek  
Take care take care  
Of the thunder in your sky  
The spark in your eye  
Always keep  
  
If not you  
Who will do  
Who will do for you if not you  
Never soft or tender  
No brother or mender will render your fall without pain  
If not you  
Who will do  
If not you  
Who
