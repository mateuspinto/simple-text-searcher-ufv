The sun thats shining through the shattered window  
Is breaking into colors in the car  
Through the heat the dust blows round the pueblo  
The sounds of people drift in from afar  
  
Can we really lose everything  
On a matter of pride  
Is this really the end of our love  
How am I to decide  
  
Are you ever coming back  
Are you ever coming back  
Are you ever coming back  
Are you ever coming back  
  
Another village rises in the distance  
To mark the passage to the journeys end  
The droning of the engine is existence  
Its too far for the mind to comprehend  
  
Can we really lose everything  
On a matter of pride  
Is this really the end of our love  
How am I to decide  
  
Are you ever coming back  
Are you ever coming back  
Are you ever coming back  
Are you ever coming back
