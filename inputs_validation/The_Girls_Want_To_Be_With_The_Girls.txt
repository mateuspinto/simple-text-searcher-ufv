The girls dont want to play like that  
They just want to talk to the boys  
The just want to do what is in their hearts  
And the girls want to be with the girls  
  
Chorus  
And the boys say What do you mean  
And the boys say What do you mean  
Well there is just no love  
When theres boys and girls  
And the girls want to be with the girls  
And the girls want to be with the girls  
  
Girls want things that make common sense  
The best for all concerned  
They dont want to have to go out of their way  
And the girls want to be with the girls  
  
Chorus  
  
Girls are getting into abstract analysis  
They want to make intuitive leap  
They are making plans that have far reaching effects  
And the girls want to be with the girls  
  
Chorus
