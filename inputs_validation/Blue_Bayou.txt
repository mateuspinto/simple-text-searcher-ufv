I feel so bad I got a worried mind  
Im so lonesome all the time  
Since I left my baby behind on Blue Bayou  
Saving nickels saving dimes  
  
Working till the sun dont shine  
Looking forward to happier times on Blue Bayou  
Im going back someday come what may to Blue Bayou  
Where you sleep all day and the catfish play on Blue Bayou  
  
All those fishing boats with their sails afloat if I could only see  
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes how happy Id be  
Gonna see my baby again  
And to be with some of my friends  
  
Maybe Id be happier then on Blue Bayou  
Saving nickels saving dimes  
Working till the sun dont shine  
Looking forward to happier times on Blue Bayou  
  
Im going back someday gonna stay on Blue Bayou  
Where the folks are fine and the world is mine  
On Blue Bayou  
And that girl of mine by my side  
  
The silver moon and the evening tide  
Some sweet day gonna take away this hurting inside  
Ill never be blue my dreams come true on Blue Bayou
