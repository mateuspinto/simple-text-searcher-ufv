When the shades are drawn  
And the light of the moon is banned  
And the stars up above  
Walk the heavens hand in hand  
Theres a shady place  
At the end of the working day  
Where young lovers go  
And this hot little trio plays  
  
Thats where we meet  
Thats where we meet  
Me and you rendezvous  
In the club at the end of the street  
Oh where we meet  
Oh where we meet  
Me and you rendezvous  
In the club at the end of the street  
  
From the alleyways  
Where the catwalks gently sway  
You hear the sound of Otis  
And the voice of Marvin Gaye  
In this smoky room  
Theres a jukebox plays all night  
And we can dance real close  
Beneath the pulse of a neon light  
  
Theres a downtown smell of cooking  
From the flame on an open grill  
Theres a sax and a big bass pumping  
Lord have mercy  
You cant sit still  
You cant sit still
