Time has come  
Start your search for tomorrow  
No escape  
From that long trail of sorrow  
You dont know how it keeps goin on oh no  
  
Wake up out of misty dreams  
Evil drug is starting to grab you to grab you  
  
Step out of hell demons dancing round your brain  
Step out of hell streams of madness flow through your veins  
Step out of hell go on like this youre gonna be dead  
Step out of hell take my heand I want to help but can I  
  
You did your best  
To keep yourself down  
Give it a rest  
And just turn around  
Its only a one way street of lies yes it is  
  
Living in a twilight zone  
Get away out of that drug jungle that drug jungle  
  
Step out of hell demons dancing round your brain  
Step out of hell streams of madness flow through your veins  
Step out of hell go on like this youre gonna be dead  
Step out of hell take my heand I want to help you  
  
Another line have a good time you dont mind  
To turn your brain inside out  
To serve the final right  
  
Step out of hell demons dancing round your brain  
Step out of hell streams of madness flow through your veins  
Step out of hell go on like this youre gonna be dead  
Step out of hell take my hand I want to help you
