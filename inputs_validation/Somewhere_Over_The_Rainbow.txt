Somewhere over the rainbow  
Way up high  
And the dreams that youve dreamed of  
Once in a lullaby  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow  
Bluebirds fly  
And the dreams that youve dreamed of  
Dreams really do come true  
  
Someday ill wish upon a star  
And wake up where the clouds are far  
Behind me  
Where troubles melts like lemon drops  
Away above the chimney tops  
Thats where youll find me  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow  
Bluebirds fly  
And the dreams that you dare to  
Oh why oh why cant i  
  
Well I see  
Trees of green and red roses too  
Ill watch them bloom for me and you  
And I think to myself  
What a wonderful world  
  
Well I see  
Skies of blues and clouds of white  
And the brightness of day I like the dark  
And I think to myself  
What a wonderful world  
  
The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky  
Are also on the faces of people passing by  
I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do  
Theyre really saying i I love you  
  
I hear babies cry I watch them grow  
Theyll learn much more than really know  
And I think to myself  
What a wonderful world  
  
Someday ill wish upon a star  
And wake up where the clouds are far  
Behind me  
Where troubles melt like lemon drops  
Away above the chimney tops  
Thats where youll find me  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow  
Way up high  
And the dreams that you dare to  
Oh why oh why cant i
