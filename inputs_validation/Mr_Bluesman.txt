sambora  
  
He was a man  
A ramblin man he was yes he was  
Guitar in hand  
His home was on the road and thats where he was  
  
Hes seen a thousand roads  
Hes been a million miles  
And when hed bend a note  
A tear would fill my eyes  
Where are you playin  
Mr bluesman  
Mr bluesman  
  
Town to town  
Honkytonks and dives all look the same  
His gipsy heart keeps his shadow ridin through the rain  
  
A graveyard full of scars  
His life will paint his songs  
cause when youre on the road  
Theres nowhere you belong  
Youre just alone  
Where are you playin  
Mr bluesman  
Mr bluesman  
  
Hes seen a thousand roads  
Hes been a million miles  
And when hed bend a note  
A tear would fill my eyes  
Where are you playin  
Mr bluesman  
Mr bluesman  
  
Ive paid some dues  
Now I make my living as a music man  
I play the blues  
I guess the blues must be just what I am  
  
A graveyard full of scars  
His life will paint his songs  
cause when youre on the road  
Theres nowhere you belong  
Youre just alone  
Where are you playin  
Mr bluesman  
Mr bluesman  
  
Hes seen a thousand roads  
Hes been a million miles  
And when hed bend a note  
A tear would fill my eyes  
Where are you playin  
Mr bluesman  
Mr bluesman
