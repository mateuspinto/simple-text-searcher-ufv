Born again  
Because have you at just being borne again  
At last I feel that Im alive and more  
This is the moment Ive waited for  
Born to be loved by youBorn to be loved by you  
Born to walk with youBorn to talk with you  
I was born for you  
Born to be with you only you  
Born to be loved by you  
Born for you born for you baby  
Born for you born for you baby  
Born for you born to be loved by you  
you and only you Born to be with only you  
I look at you and all at once I know that dreams come true  
For there you are the other part of me  
I have found my destiny  
Born to be loved by youBorn to be loved by you  
Right or wrong for youWeak or strong for you  
Faithful or untrue  
Born chained forever and far beyond  
Born to be loved by you and only you  
No one else will do  
Heart and soulBorn to be loved  
Born to be loved  
Born to be loved by you  
you and only youBorn to be with only you  
Born for you  
Born for you baby  
Born for you  
Born for you baby
