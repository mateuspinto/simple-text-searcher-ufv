Repair the hull replace the sails  
The monkey wrestles with the ghost  
And a thousand pleasures form a thin veneer  
Over lack of hope  
The captain was rightly murdered by the crew  
But now they dont know what to do   
Drifting on the murky Sargasso of the everyday  
Work and slave and skimp and save  
And you can buy yourself a bigger cave  
And a thousand little cruelties we agree to pretend to ignore  
The ghost has got the monkey by the tail  
And all they both can do is wail  
And you and I go drifting by the abandoned vessels of he everyday
