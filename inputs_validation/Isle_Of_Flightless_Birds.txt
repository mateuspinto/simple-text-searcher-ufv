Now is the climax to the story  
That gives the demons and angels purpose  
They fly around while we are walking  
And mold our emotions just to please them  
I am cold can you hear  
I will fly with no hope no fear  
And the ground taunts my wings  
Plummet as I sing plummet as I sing  
All we are is an isle of flightless birds  
We find our worth in giving birth and stuff  
Were lining our homes against winding roads  
And we think the going is tough  
We pick songs to sing remind us of things that no body cares about  
And honestly were probably more suicidal than ever now  
If you decide to live by what you thinks wrong and whats right  
Believe me youll begin to wish you were sleeping  
Your weeping will creep in head and youll cry  
But if we wake up every morning and decide what we believe  
We can take a part our very heart and the light will set you free  
I am cold can you hear  
I will fly with no hope no fear  
And the ground taunts my wings  
Plummet as I sing plummet as I sing  
How frustrating and so degrading  
His time were wasting  
And time will fly by and the sky will cry as light is fading  
And he is waiting oh so patiently  
While we repeat the same routine as we will please comfortability  
Please think about why you cant sleep in the evening  
And please dont be afraid of what your soul is really thinking  
Your soul knows good and evil your soul knows both sides  
And its time you pick your battle and I promise you this is mine
