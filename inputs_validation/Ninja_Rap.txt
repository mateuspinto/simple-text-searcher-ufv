YO Its the green machine  
Gonna rock the town without being seen  
Have you ever seen a turtle Get Down  
Slammin and Jammin to the new swing sound  
Yeah everybody lets move  
Vanilla is here with the New Jack Groove  
Gonna rock And roll this place  
With the power of the ninja turtle bass  
Iceman ya know Im not playin  
Devastate the show while the turtles are sayin  
  
Chorus  
Ninja Ninja RAP Ninja Ninja RAP GO GO GO GO  
Go Ninja Go Ninja GO Go Ninja Go Ninja GO  
Go Ninja Go Ninja GO Go Ninja Go Ninja GO  
GO GO GO GO  
  
Lyrics fill in the gap  
Drop that bass and get the NINJA RAP  
Feel it if you know what I mean  
Give it up for those heroes in green  
Just flowin smooth with the power  
Kickin it up Hour after hour  
Cause in this life theres only one winner  
You better aim straight so you can hit the center  
In it to win it With a team of four  
Ninja Turtles that you gotta adore its the  
  
Chorus  
  
Villains you better run and hide  
Because one day you might not slide  
So choose your weapon dont slip  
Vanillas in control with the flex of the mic grip  
Rockin the crowd the way it should be rocked  
With the Miami drop that you like a lot  
You know its hittin Like a ninja turtle  
When the bass kicks in You better check your level  
The power of the ninja is strong  
Fightin the crooks til theyre all gone  
  
Chorus x2
