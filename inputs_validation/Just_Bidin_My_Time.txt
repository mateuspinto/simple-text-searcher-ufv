I cant believe that youre honestly thinking of leaving me  
Cause I thought that leaving really wasnt even on your mind  
Im drowning in tears drowning constantly nearer to misery  
Just bidin my time while the glow from the wine makes a fool of me  
Over and over I practice every day  
What to say when I see you but when I see you my tears get in the way  
Just bidin my time while the glow from the wine makes a fool of me  
I spend my nights making up things I might have to say to you  
To stop you from going yet keep you from knowing how I feel  
But till the light says goodbye to the night and your face I see  
Ill just bidin my time while the glow from the wine makes a fool of me  
 guitar   
Over and over
