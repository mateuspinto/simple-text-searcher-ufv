Here is the news from my little hideaway  
My sweet Ivory Tower  
Ive sent you songs about so many thing  
Mighty moon dogs skipping waves  
Dolphins playing their lives away  
Golden circus girls and pharaohs  
Fallen angels street side Romeos  
  
Patricias park and Anyway  
Eternal youth and never ending summer days  
Lonely girls music halls the mysteries of love  
In the event that I dont return  
Please take this message to understand  
In the event  
I am a stranger in a strange land  
  
Welcome stranger to the land of the free  
Welcome Carol to Phantasy  
Oh my God I feel so alone  
A million light years far from home  
It seems to be a tragedy  
How can I live in Germany  
  
Another house is burning down  
Its time to face the cruel reality  
This is a game no more  
Disasters in the 20th Century
