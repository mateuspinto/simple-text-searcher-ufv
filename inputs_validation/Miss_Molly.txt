Miss Molly had a steam boat  
The steam boat had a bell  
Miss Molly went to heaven  
The steam boat went to hello operator  
Please give me number 9  
And if you disconnect me  
Ill kick you in the behind the yellow curtain  
There Was a piece of glass  
Miss Molly sat upon it  
And hurt her big fat assk  
Me no more questions  
Tell me no more lies  
The boys are in the washroom  
Doing up their flyies  
Are in the city  
Bees are in the park  
Miss Molly and her boyfriend are  
Kissing in the dark dark dark  
  
The dark is like a movie  
A movies like a show  
A show is like a video  
And that is all I Know know know  
  
My mother is the queen  
My father is kingkong  
My sister is the physco one  
Who made this stupid song song song
