I was sittin on a bar stool  
In a barbecue joint in Tennessee  
When this old boy walked in  
And he sat right down next to me  
  
I could tell hed been through some hard times  
There were tear stains on his old shirt  
And he said You wanna know what you get  
When you play a country song backwards  
  
You get your house back  
You get your dog back  
You get your best friend Jack back  
You get your truck back  
  
You get your hair back  
You get your first and second wives back  
Your front porch swing  
Your pretty little thing  
  
Your bling bling bling and a diamond ring  
You get your farm and the barn  
And the boat and the Harley  
First night in jail with Charlie  
  
It sounds a little crazy  
A little scattered and absurd  
But thats what you get  
When you play a country song backwards  
  
Well I never heard it said quite like that  
It hit me in the face cause thats where Im at  
I almost fell flat out on the floor  
He said Wait a minute thats not all  
Theres even more  
  
You get your mind back  
You get your nerves back  
Your first heart attack back  
You get your pride back  
  
You get your life back  
You get your first real love back  
You get your big screen TV a DVD  
And a washing machine  
  
You get the pond and the lawn  
And the bail and the mower  
You go back where you dont know her  
It sounds a little crazy  
  
A little scattered and absurd  
But thats what you get  
When you play a country song backwards  
Oh play that song  
  
We sat there and shot the bull  
About how it would be  
If we could turn it all around  
And change this CRAP  
  
You get your house back  
You get your dog back  
You get your best friend Jack back  
You get your truck back  
  
You get your hair back  
You get your first and second wives back  
Your front porch swing  
Your pretty little thing  
  
Your bling bling bling and a diamond ring  
You get your farm and the barn  
And the boat and the Harley  
First night in jail with Charlie  
You get your mind back  
  
You get your nerves back  
Your first heart attack back  
You get your pride back  
You get your life back  
  
You get your first real love back  
You get your big screen TV a DVD  
And a washing machine  
You get the pond and the lawn  
  
And the bail and the mower  
You go back where you dont know her  
It sounds a little crazy  
A little scattered and absurd  
  
But thats what you get  
When you play a country song backwards
