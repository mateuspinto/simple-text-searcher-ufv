Waiting for you again seems like this never ends  
I close my eyes and I see your face and I see it all fading away  
  
Woke up before you again youre still asleep I cant pretend  
I feel like Im losing you and I am trying to make everything right  
  
Chorus  
Only you only me say the words I want to hear for all eternity  
Only you holding my heart in your hands  
Only me still trying to understand whoa no oh oh  
  
If I could have a second chance maybe change the circumstance  
Imagine if the dream came true we could start it all over tonight  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Only me say the words I want to hear for all eternity  
Only you holding my heart in your hands  
Only me still trying to understand whoa no oh oh
