She told me she loved me  
Which means  
She must be insane  
Ive had my face dragged in  
Fifteen miles of shit  
And I do not and I do not  
And I do not like it  
So how can anybody say  
They know how I feel  
The only one around here who is me  
Is me  
  
They said they respect me  
Which means  
Their judgment is crazy  
Ive had my face dragged in  
Fifteen miles of shit  
And I do not and I do not  
And I do not like it  
So how can anybody say  
They know how I feel  
When they are they  
And only I am I  
  
He said he wants to befriend me  
Which means  
He cant possibly know me  
The voices of the real  
And the imagined cry  
The future is passing you by  
The future is passing you by  
So how can anybody possibly think they  
Know how I feel  
Everybody look and see pain and walk away  
And as for you in your uniform we told you  
Your smelly uniform we told you  
And so you think you can be rude to me  
Because you wear a uniform we told you  
A smelly uniform we told you  
And so you think you can be rude to me  
But even I as sick as I am  
I would never be you  
Even I as sick as I am  
I would never be you  
Even I sick and depraved  
A traveler to the grave  
I would never be you  
I would never be you
