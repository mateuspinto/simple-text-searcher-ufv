I miss the warm embrace I felt  
First time you touched me  
Secure and safe in open arms  
I should have known youd crush me  
A snake you were when me met  
I loved you anyway  
Pulling out your poisoned fangs  
The venom never goes away  
Serpent swims free in my blood  
Dragons sleeping in my veins  
Jackyl speaking with tongue  
Roach egg laying in my brain  
Once stalked beneath your shadow  
Sleepwalking to the gallows  
Im the sun that beats your brow in  
Til I finally threw the towel in  
Never knowing if Id wake up in a whirlpool got redundant  
My brain was just some driftwood in a cesspool I became dead  
From a rock star to a desk fool was my destiny someone said  
Loves a tidepool taste the waters lifes abundant  
Taste me
