Ooooooooh  
When I met you baby  
You put a circle of love around me  
Ooooooooh  
When I met you baby  
You put a circle of love around me  
And I give you my heart  
I was in love right from the start  
Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii  
Got my first kiss in the back seat of a car  
I was hot I was really rarin to go  
Got my first kiss in the back seat of a car  
At the drivein the drivein movie show  
And I gave her my heart  
I was in love right from the start  
Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii  
Ooooooooh  
When I met you baby  
You put a circle of love around me  
Ooooooooh  
When I met you baby  
You put a circle of love around me  
And I give you my heart  
I was in love right from the start  
Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii Iiiii
