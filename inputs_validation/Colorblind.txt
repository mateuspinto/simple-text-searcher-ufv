I am colorblind  
Coffee black and egg white  
Pull me out from inside  
I am ready I am ready I am ready  
I am taffy stuck and tongue tied  
Stutter shook and uptight  
Pull me out from inside  
I am ready I am ready I am ready  
I am fine  
  
I am covered in skin  
No one gets to come in  
Pull me out from inside  
I am folded and unfolded and unfolding  
I am colorblind  
Coffee black and egg white  
Pull me out from inside  
I am ready I am ready I am ready  
I am fine  
I am fine  
I am fine
