Im so tired of playing  
Playing with this bow and arrow  
Gonna give my heart away  
Leave it to the other boys to play  
Been tempted for too long  
Go on give me a reason to love you  
Give me a reason to wanna your man  
Give me a reason to love you  
Give me a reason if you can  
From this time unchained  
Were all looking at a different picture  
Through this new frame of mind  
A thousand flowers could bloom  
Move over move over and give us some room  
Go on give me a reason to love you  
Give me a reason to wanna be your man  
Give me a reason to love you  
Reason  
Dont you stop looking like some woman  
Take a little look from the outside if you can  
Saw a little tenderness  
Go on give me a reason to love you  
Give me a reason to want to be your man  
Give me a reason to love you  
Oh please give me a reason if you can  
This is the beginning of forever and ever ever ever  
Im so tired of playing  
Of playing with this bow and this arrow  
Gonna give my heart away  
Gonna leave ti to the other boys to play  
Ive been tempted too long  
Too long  
Ive been tempted every day  
Tempted too long  
Oh please  
Give me a reason too love you  
Give me a reason to want to love you  
Give me a reason to love you  
Give me a reason every day  
Reason every day
