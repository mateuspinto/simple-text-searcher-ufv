Valjean  
Not another word my son  
Theres something now that must be done  
Youve spoken from the heart  
And I must do the same  
There is a story sir  
Of slavery and shame  
That you alone must know  
  
I never told Cosette  
She had enough of tears  
Shes never known the truth  
Of the story you must hear  
Of years ago  
  
There lived a man named Jean Valjean  
He stole some bread to save his sisters son  
For nineteen winters served his time  
In sweat he washed away his crime  
Years ago  
He broke parole and lived a life apart  
How could he tell Cosette and break her heart  
Its for Cosette that this must be faced  
If he is caught she is disgraced  
The time is come to journey on  
And from this day he must be gone  
Who am I  
Who am I  
  
Marius  
Youre Jean Valjean  
What can I do  
That will turn you from this  
Monsieur you cannot leave  
Whatever I tell my beloved Cosette  
She will never believe  
  
Valjean  
Make her believe  
I have gone on a journey  
A long way away  
Tell her my heart was too full for farewells  
It is better this way  
Promise me Msieur Cosette will never know  
  
Marius  
I give my word  
  
Valjean  
 What I have spoken why I must go  
  
Marius  
For the sake of Cosette it must be so
