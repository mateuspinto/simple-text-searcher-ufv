Here I am waiting abide in me I pray  
Here I am longing for You  
Hide me in Your love bring me to my knees  
May I know Jesus more and more  
  
Come live in me all my life take over  
Come breathe in me I will rise on eagles wings  
Come live in me all my life take over  
Come breathe in me I will rise on eagles wings

Come breathe in me I will rise on eagles wings  
Come live in me all my life take over
