My Daddy was a charmer boys he had a lot of style  
He was shining best at everything he did  
They said that he could lighten up a room with just a smile  
And I was proud as hell to be his kid  
  
It seemed like just as we were growing close together he was gone  
But it was long enough to show what I could be  
And I sometimes feel his spirit fill my body like a song  
And this is what my Daddy sings to me  
  
Chorus  
If they deal you down and dirty in a way you dont deserve  
Youll feel better if you take it like a man  
If you let em drive you crazy boy theyll shut your business down  
Shake it off and get your licks in when you can  
Cause the heart is all that matters in the end  
  
They say every song is sweeter when you sing it from the heart  
I wont knock it cause I tried it and its true  
I may never get to heaven but Ive seen a lot of stars  
And Im here to bring the same advice to you  
  
Chorus  
  
Yes the heart is all that matters in the end  
The heart is all that matters in the end
