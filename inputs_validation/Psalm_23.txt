Chorus  
The Lord is my Shepherd and I  
I shall not want for He makes me to  
Lie down in green pastures and He  
He leads me beside still waters  
He resoreth my soul and He  
Leads me in paths of righteousness  
For His namesake yea though I walk  
Through the valley of the  
Shadow of death I shall fear no evil  
Fear no evil for thou are with me  
  
Verse  
Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me  
Thou preparest a table before me  
In the presence of mine enemy  
Thou anointeth my head with oil  
My cup runneth over  
Surely goodness and mercy  
Shall follow me  
All of the days of my life  
And Im gonna dwell in the house of the Lord forever  
  
Bridge  
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me  
All of the days of my life  
And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever  
repeat  
Surely
