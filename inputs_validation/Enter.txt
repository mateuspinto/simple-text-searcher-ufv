The gates of time have opened  
Now its chains are broken  
An ancient force unleashed again  
As I enter the portal I feel the enchantment  
It takes me away away from here  
  
Come near me  
Enter my private chambers  
I want to feel the warmth on my face  
Lightin darkness lift me up from here  
Give me your wings  
To flee from my ivory tower  
  
As I enter the portal  
I feel the enchantment  
The stars above are lying at my feet  
  
Come near me  
Enter my private chambers  
I want to feel the warmth on my face  
Light in darkness lift me up from here  
Give me your wings  
To flee from my ivory tower
