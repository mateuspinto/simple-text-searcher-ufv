I ride an old paint I lead an old Dan  
Im off to Montan for to throw the hooley ann  
They feed in the coulees they water in the draw  
Their tails are all matted their backs are all raw  
Ride around little dogies ride around slow  
The fiery and snuffy are raring to go  
Well Johns had two daughters and the song  
One went to Denver the other went wrong  
His young wife died in a poolroom fight  
But he tries to keep singing from morning till night  
Ride around little dogies ride around slow  
The fiery and snuffy are raring to go  
When I die take my saddle from the wall  
Strap it my pony lead him out of the stall  
Throw my bones on his back turn our faces to the west  
And well ride the prairie that we love the best  
Ride around little dogies ride around slow  
The fiery and snuffy are raring to go
