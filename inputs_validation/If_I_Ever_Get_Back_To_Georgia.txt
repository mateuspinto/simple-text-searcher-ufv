Well the wind blows cold in New York City along about the middle of now  
And Im telling you Id be a happy man if I could get away somehow  
Cause Im growing old before my time finally I see the light  
But if it costs a dime to get around the world I couldnt get out of sight  
But if I ever get back to Georgia therell be no messin around  
If I ever get back to Georgia Im gonna nail my feet to the ground  
 guitar   
Well the buildings here in New York City grow so doggone tall  
Sometimes you can walk for a couple of days and never see the sun at all  
So I left last night I was homeward bound now I wanna sit and I cry  
Cause I stuck out my thumb till my thumb got numb and the cars went right on
by  
But if I ever get back to Georgia  
 piano   
Well I guess my time in New York City hasnt been a total waste  
Cause I met a little girl from a social world and really put her in her place  
When she sold me half of the Brooklyn Bridge I hung around just for spite  
And I played this part till I won her heart and I bought the other half last
night  
But if I ever get back to Georgia
