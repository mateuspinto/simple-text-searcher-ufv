Turn and run  
Nothing can stop them  
Around every river and canal their power is growing  
Stamp them out  
We must destroy them  
They infiltrate each city with their thick dark warning odour  
  
They are invincible  
They seem immune to all our herbicidal battering  
  
Long ago in the Russian hills  
A Victorian explorer found the regal Hogweed by a marsh  
He captured it and brought it home  
Botanical creature stirs seeking revenge  
Royal beast did not forget  
He came home to London  
And made a present of the Hogweed to the Royal Gardens at Kew  
  
Waste no time  
They are approaching  
Hurry now we must protect ourselves and find some shelter  
Strike by night  
They are defenceless  
They all need the sun to photosensitize their venom  
  
Still theyre invincible  
Still theyre immune to all our herbicidal battering  
  
Fashionable country gentlemen had some cultivated wild gardens  
In which they innocently planted the Giant Hogweed throughout the land  
Botanical creature stirs seeking revenge  
Royal beast did not forget  
Soon they escaped spreading their seed  
Preparing for an onslaught threatening the human race  
  
Mighty Hogweed is avenged  
Human bodies soon will know our anger  
Kill them with your Hogweed hairs
