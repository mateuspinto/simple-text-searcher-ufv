Granada Im falling under your spell  
And if you could speak what a fascinating tale you would tell  
Of an age the world has long forgotten  
Of an age that weaves a silent magic in Granada today  
  
The dawn in the sky greets the day with a sigh for Granada  
For she can remember the splendor that once was Granada  
It still can be found in the hills all around as I wanderr along  
Entranced by the beauty before me  
Entranced by a land full of sunshine and flowers and song  
  
And when day is done and the sun starts to set in Granada  
I envy the blush of the snowclad Sierra Nevada  
For soon it will welcome the stars while a thousand guitars  
Play a soft habanera  
Then moonlit Granada will live again the glory of yesterday  
Romantic and gay
