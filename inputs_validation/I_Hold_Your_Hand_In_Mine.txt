One more love song I generally like to include at least one or two love songs
in the evenings program partly perhaps to convince people that even at the
harvard university graduate school th  
Tbed of celibacy that I used to call home we did have our moments this one
is a tender ballad entitled simply I hold your hand in mine  
I hold your hand in mine dear  
I press it to my lips  
I take a healthy bite  
From your dainty fingertips  
My joy would be complete dear  
If you were only here  
But still I keep your hand  
As a precious souvenir  
The night you died I cut it off  
I really dont know why  
For now each time I kiss it  
I get bloodstains on my tie  
Im sorry now I killed you  
For our love was something fine  
And till they come to get me  
I shall hold your hand in mine
