There must be some misunderstanding  
There must be some kind of mistake  
I waited in the rain for hours  
You were late  
  
Now its not like me to say the right thing  
But you couldve called to let me know  
I checked your number twice dont understand it  
So I went home  
  
Well Id been waiting for this weekend  
I thought that maybe we could see a show  
Never dreamed Id have this feeling  
But seeing you is believing  
Thats why I dont know why  
You didnt show up that night  
  
There must be some misunderstanding  
There must be some kind of mistake  
I was waiting in the rain for hours  
You were late  
  
Since then Ive been running around trying to find you  
I went to the places you always go  
I rang your home but got no answer  
Jumped in my car I went round there  
I still dont believe it  
He was just leaving  
  
There must be some misunderstanding  
There must be some kind of mistake
