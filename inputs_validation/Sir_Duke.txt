Music is a world within itself  
With a language we all understand  
With an equal opportunity  
For all to sing dance and clap their hands  
But just because a record has a groove  
Dont make it in the groove  
But you can tell right away at letter A  
When the people start to move  
  
They can feel it all over  
They can feel it all over people  
They can feel it all over  
They can feel it all over people  
  
Music knows it is and always will  
Be one of the things that life just wont quit  
But here are some of musics pioneers  
That time will not allow us to forget  
For theres Basie Miller Sachmo  
And the king of all Sir Duke  
And with a voice like Ellas ringing out  
Theres no way the band can lose  
  
You can feel it all over  
You can feel it all over people  
You can feel it all over  
You can feel it all over people  
You can feel it all over  
You can feel it all over people  
You can feel it all over  
You can feel it all over people  
You can feel it all over  
You can feel it all over people  
You can feel it all over  
You can feel it all over people  
You can feel it all over  
You can feel it all over people  
You can feel it all over  
  
I can feel it all overall over now people  
Cant you feel it all over  
Come on lets feel it all over people  
You can feel it all over
