I tried to find out  
What love is all about  
And every day  
It sure lets out  
I see my baby  
I get week in my knees  
Theres nothing shaking  
But the leaves on the trees  
My pappie told me  
Thered be times like these  
Theres nothing shaking  
But the leaves on the trees  
  
We meet the gang  
And go to rocking Joes  
The cats are something  
On the heels and toes  
I grab my baby  
Tried to give her a squeeze  
Theres nothing shaking  
But the leaves on the trees  
Why must she be  
Such a doggone tease  
Theres nothing shaking  
But the leaves on the trees  
  
Shes got a way  
That makes me act like a fool  
Spent my money  
Then she plays me cool  
I beg her for kisses  
On my bended knees  
Oh wont you give me  
Some loving baby  
Please please please  
  
Though I keep trying hard  
To make her mine  
One day the wind will blow  
And the sun will shine  
Till that time  
She puts my heart at ease  
Theres nothing shaking  
But the leaves on the trees  
She locked my heart  
And threw away the keys  
Theres nothing shaking  
But the leaves on the trees yeah  
  
Shes got a way  
That makes me act like a fool  
Spent my money  
Then she plays me cool  
Im begging her for kisses  
On my bended knees  
Oh wont you give me  
Some of your loving baby  
Please please please  
  
Though I keep trying hard  
To make her mine  
One day the wind will blow  
And the sun will shine  
Till that time  
She puts my heart at ease  
Theres nothing shaking  
But the leaves on the trees  
She locked my heart  
And threw away the keys  
Theres nothing shaking  
But the leaves on the trees  
Theres nothing shaking  
But the leaves on the trees  
Theres nothing shaking  
But the leaves on the trees  
Theres nothing shaking  
But the leaves on the trees
