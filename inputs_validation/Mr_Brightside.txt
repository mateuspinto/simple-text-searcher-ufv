Coming out of my cage  
And Ive been doing just fine  
Gotta gotta be down  
Because I want it all  
It started out with a kiss  
How did it end up like this  
It was only a kiss it was only a kiss  
Now Im falling asleep  
And shes calling a cab  
While hes having a smoke  
And shes taking a drag  
Now theyre going to bed  
And my stomach is sick  
And its all in my head  
But shes touching his chest  
Now he takes off her dress  
Now letting me go  
  
I just cant look its killing me  
And taking control  
Jealousy turning saints into the sea  
Swimming through sick lullabies  
Choking on your alibis  
But its just the price I pay  
Destiny is calling me  
Open up my eager eyes  
Cause Im Mr Brightside

I never  
I never  
I never  
I never
