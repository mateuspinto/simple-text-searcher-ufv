You really like my limousine  
You like the way the wheels roll  
You like my seven inch leather heels  
And goin to all of the shows  
  
But  
Do you love me  
Really love me  
Do you love me  
  
You like the credit cards and private planes  
Money can really take you far  
You like the hotels and fancy clothes  
And the sound of electric guitars  
  
You really like rock n roll  
All of the fame and the masquerade  
You like the concerts and studios  
And all the money honey that I make  
  
Your backstage pass and black sunglasses  
Make you look just like a queen  
Even the fans they know your face  
From all of the magazines
