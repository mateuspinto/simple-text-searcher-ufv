Theres red in my head  
but I dont want it  
The blues were swarming  
there in my soul  
Shadows over me and  
The only colour I can paint my soul  
  
I want black and dont fade away  
I want it black forever  
Inside of me all I want to sees  
The colours in my head  
Im in black the only way  
And make it black forever  
Go inside and go inside and  
Never come back out again  
  
Dont colourize me  
Cause I dont want it  
The ravens taken over my soul  
The only thing I want is  
The only way I want to go  
  
The reds were in my head the blues were my soul  
Swirl in my mind never let go  
Blind my eyes with a cold embrace  
Ill lay my veil all across my face  
Everyone I used to know  
Sees me strange sees me bold  
Everything I used to hold  
Will fade away my soul  
  
No confessions and no regrets  
Ill paint the black all across my chest  
Gimme darkness and gimme rest  
Gimme blackness or gimme death
