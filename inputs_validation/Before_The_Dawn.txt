Before the dawn I hear you whisper  
In your sleep Dont let the morning take him  
Outside the birds begin to call  
As if to summon up my leaving  
  
Its been a lifetime since I found someone  
Since I found someone who would stay  
Ive waited too long and now youre leaving  
Oh please dont take it all away  
  
Its been a lifetime since I found someone

Oh please dont take it all away
