It gives me such a thrill  
When you tell me bout the way  
You feel  
It really makes my day  
I just love to hear you say  
  
Chorus  
Say it again say it high say it low  
Say it again so the whole wide  
World will know  
Say it that youre still loving me  
Still loving me still in love with me  
Say it again tell me where tell me when  
  
Say it again that our love will never end  
Say it that youre still loving me  
Still loving me still in love with me  
  
You know it sounds so sweet  
It just knocks me right up off of  
My feet  
To hear you talk that way  
I just love to hear you say  
  
Chorus  
  
I hear the echoes in my mind  
Theyre calling to me all the time  
I hear those voices start to sing  
Again and again  
  
It gives me such a thrill  
When you tell me bout the way  
You feel  
It really makes my day  
I just love to hear you say  
  
Chorus
