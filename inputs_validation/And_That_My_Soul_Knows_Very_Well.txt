You make Your face to shine on me  
And that my soul knows very well  
You lift me up Im cleansed and free  
And that my soul knows very well  
  
When mountains fall Ill stand  
By the power of Your hand  
And in Your heart of hearts Ill dwell  
And that my soul knows very well  
  
Joy and strength each day I find  
And that my soul knows very well  
Forgiveness hope I know is mine  
And that my soul knows very well
