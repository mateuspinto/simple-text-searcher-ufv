Standing by the elevator  
Feeling gloomy and down  
Waiting for the flashing light  
To lift me up from the ground  
  
Then the elevator opened  
And I saw her standing there  
She had to be a young executive  
She looked so corporate and clean  
  
And I thought Id seen her somewhere before  
On the cover of a magazine  
I didnt think shed even look at me  
Or bother to glance my way  
  
But she actually smiled at me and said  
Hiya handsome have a good day  
  
Chorus  
I must be dreaming if she looks at me  
I gotta be dreaming is it a fantasy  
Now Ive got positive emotions  
Buzzing round every molecule in me  
I gotta be dreaming is it reality  
But over and over I live that memory  
Was it real or only a dream  
La la la la  
  
Was it my imagination playing tricks on me  
When she looked my way  
Maybe she took me for somebody else  
Whatever it was it made my day hey hey  
  
I wake up in the morning  
Smiling with anticipation  
Suddenly I feel alive  
Face the world with expectation  
  
I must be dreaming this world is a better place  
Was my imagination playing tricks on me  
Was it real or only a dream  
I see a great big sunset  
  
Where only clouds used to be  
Was it all an illusion is it fantasy  
If its just a dream  
Its good enough for me yeah yeah  
  
Waiting by the elevator  
Feeling optimistic and keen  
Waiting for my executive goddess  
To appear as if in a dream  
  
Then the elevator opened  
She was talking to another guy  
And I tried to say hello to her  
But I failed to even catch her eye  
  
Then everybody crowded inside  
And I sadly stood my ground  
Thinking lifes just like that elevator  
It takes you up and brings you down  
  
Chorus  
  
Was it only an illusion  
Was it real or only a dream  
  
Chorus
