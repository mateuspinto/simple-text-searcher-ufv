I can not hold this anymore  
My hands are tired of only waiting to let go  
And I am waiting still  
  
I used to know which way to turn  
You were a light inside a tunnel in my head  
I try to follow still  
I try to follow still  
  
Its hard to see you we are older now  
And when I find you you just turn around  
This is a black and white of you Ive found  
I hang you up and then I pull you down  
I hang you up and then I pull you down  
  
No more apologies from me  
My arms are tired of picking up what I put down  
Youre all I think of still  
  
Im gonna miss you everyday  
I turn my back on anyone who wont believe  
And it gets lonely still  
It gets lonely still  
  
Its hard to see you we are older now  
And when I find you you just turn around  
This is a black and white of you Ive found  
I hang you up and then I pull you down  
  
I hang you up and then I pull you down  
  
I get lost sometimes  
Another year flies by  
But I know if I try  
Memories of the light in your eyes  
Can take me back in time  
  
Its hard to see you we are older now  
And when I find you you just turn around  
This is a black and white of you I found  
I hang you up and then I pull you down  
Its hard to see you we are older now we are older now  
And when I find you you just turn around you turn around  
This is a black and white of you I found you I found  
I hang you up and then I pull you down  
Pull you down  
I hang you up and then I pull you down  
Pull you down  
I hang you up and then I pull you down  
Pull you down  
  
I dont hear music anymore  
My ears are tired of all the pictures in the words  
Cause you are in them still
