You know the cards are stacked against this  
As we surrender our defenses  
And Ive torn down all my fences just for you  
And you feel it too  
What do we do  
Do we run or see it through  
The longer were together  
It just keeps gettin better  
And you hide your little love letters  
Around the house for me  
And its plain to see  
That youll always be all Ill ever need  
  
Chorus  
The webs we spun  
Wove into one  
And left us tangled up in love  
You squeeze my hand I understand  
About a woman and a man  
I love the way you make me feel  
You got me tangled up in love  
The webs we spun  
Wove into one  
Left us tangled up in love  
  
Chorus
