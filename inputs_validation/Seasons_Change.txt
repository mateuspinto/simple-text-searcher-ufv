I see a farmer in a field at dawn  
His land is crying out for the rain  
The years been hard  
His crops are almost gone but he is not to blame  
The morning sun is climbing in the sky  
I see him smiling through the tears  
I wonder how can men like this survive  
But hes been here for years  
Seasons change barren fields will bloom again  
Seasons change gentle rains will fall  
Seasons change better days will come and then  
You will find the blessing is worth the pain  
So just believe and let the seasons change  
I see a farmer in his field at dusk  
With joy he bring a harvest in  
The pride he feels  
Is in the one he trusts and he offers thanks to Him  
Seasons change barren fields will bloom again  
Seasons change gentle rains will fall  
Seasons change better days will come and then  
You will find the blessing is worth the pain  
So just believe and let the seasons change  
Hearts grown cold  
May be warmed by the summer sun  
Dreams you hold  
May be closer than you know let the  
Seasons change barren fields will bloom again  
Seasons change gentle rains will fall  
Seasons change better days will come and then  
You will find the blessing is worth the pain  
So just believe and let the seasons change
