I had wrists donning slits  
Flowing constantly  
My broken body in a wreck  
Wrapped around a tree  
A crosswalk hit and run  
The finish line for me  
People clutter in the gutter  
Take a look and see  
  
No escaping pain  
You belong to me  
Clinging on to life  
By the skin omy teeth  
  
My blood flows through the streets  
Deluge from the wounds  
Empty jars of sleeping pills  
On the dresser in my room  
My wet brain neighbor cranes  
His neck to see in time  
The white lights a train  
Bearing down on me  
  
No escaping pain  
You belong to me  
Clinging on to life  
By the skin omy teeth  
  
Solo  Marty  
  
I wont feel the hurt  
Im not trash any longer  
That that doesnt kill me  
Only makes me stronger  
I need a ride to the morgue  
Thats what 911 is for  
So tag my toe and dont forget  
Ooh to close the drawer  
  
No escaping pain  
You belong to me  
Clinging on to life  
By the skin omy teeth
