Jeremiah was a bullfrog he was good friend of mine  
I never understood a single word he said  
But I helped him drink his wine  
He always had some mighty fine wine sing it  
  
Joy to the world all the boys and girls now  
Joy to the fishiest in the deep blue sea  
And joy to you and me  
  
And if I were the king of the world  
I tell you what I would do  
Id throw away the cars and the bars in the world  
And Id make sweet love to you sing it now  
  
Joy to the world all the boys and girls now  
Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea  
Joy to you and me  
  
Yah know I love the ladies love to have my fun  
Im a hard knock flier and a rain bow rider  
A straight shootin son of a gun  
I said a straight shootin son of a gun  
  
Joy to the world all the boys and girls  
Joy to all the fishes in the deep blue sea  
Joy to you and me  
  
Joy to the world all the boys and girls  
Joy to the world  
Joy to you and me  
  
Joy to the world all the boys and girls  
Joy to all the fishes in the deep blue sea  
Joy to you and me  
  
Joy to the world all the boys and girls  
Joy to the world  
Joy to you and me  
  
Joy to the world all the boys and girls  
Joy to the world  
Joy to you and me
