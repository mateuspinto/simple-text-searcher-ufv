Give me your pain  
Give me your sorrow  
Give me your loneliness  
And broken dreams  
Your bad times  
And your worry  
Now forget  
Now forget  
  
Give me your past  
Give me your family  
Give me the walls you build  
And the ones you break  
Your shadows  
And your longing  
Now forget  
Now forget  
  
All that will be  
But isnt yet  
Now forget  
Now forget  
  
Ill put it all  
In a small wooden box  
With the rusty old lock  
And the sparrows in flight  
Ill guard it with my life  
Through the long long night  
  
You are my eyes  
You are my passion  
You are my journey to where Ive been  
You are my reason  
For living  
Now forget  
Now forget  
  
Ill put it all  
In a small wooden box  
With the rusty old lock  
And the sparrows in flight  
Ill guard it with my life  
Through the long long night  
  
Give me your truth  
Give me your questions  
Give me your longing for what will be  
Give me your daydreams  
And your demons  
Now forget  
Now forget  
  
All that will be  
But isnt yet  
Now forget  
Now forget  
  
Now forget  
Now forget
