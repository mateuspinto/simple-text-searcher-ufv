Empty out your pockets toss the lot upon the floor  
All those treasures my friend  
You dont need them anymore  
Your days are all through dying  
They gave all their ghosts away  
So kiss close all your wounds and call living life a day  
For the planets gravitate around you  
And the stars shower down around you  
And the angels in heaven adore you  
And the saints all stand and applaud you  
So faraway  
So faraway and yet so close  
  
Say farewell to the passing of the years  
Though all your sweet goodbyes will fall upon deaf ears  
Kiss so softly the mouths of the ones you love  
Beneath the September moon and the heavens above  
And the world will turn without you  
And history will soon forget about you  
But the heavens they will reward you  
And the saints will be there to escort you  
So faraway  
So faraway and yet so close  
  
Do not grieve at the passing of mortality  
For lifes but a thing of terrible gravity  
And the planets gravitate around you  
And the stars shall dance about you  
And the angels in heaven adore you  
And the saints all stand and applaud you  
So faraway  
So faraway and yet so close
