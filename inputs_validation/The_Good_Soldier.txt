Gunfire in the street  
Where we used to meet  
Echoes that are beat  
And the bass goes bomb  
Right over my head  
Step over the dead  
Remember what you said  
You know the part about life  
Is just a waking dream  
Well I know what you mean  
But that aint how it seems right here right now  
How can this be real  
I can barely feel  
Anymore  
  
I am trying to see  
I am trying to believe  
This is not where I should be  
I am trying to believe  
  
Blood hardens in the sand  
Cold metal in my hand  
Hope you understand the way that things are gonna be  
Theres nowhere left to hide  
Cause God is on our side  
I keep telling myself  
  
I am trying to see  
I am trying to believe  
This is not where I should be  
I am trying to believe
