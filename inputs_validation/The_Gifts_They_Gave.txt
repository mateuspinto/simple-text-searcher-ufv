Jesus our brother kind and good  
Was humbly born in a stable of wood  
And the friendly beasts around Him stood  
Jesus our brother kind and good  
  
I said the donkey shaggy and brown  
I carried His Mother up hill and down  
I carried His Mother to Bethlehem town  
I said the donkey shaggy and brown  
  
I said the sheep with curly horn  
I gave Him my wool for a blanket warm  
He wore my coat on Christmas morn  
I said the sheep with curly horn  
  
I said the dove from the rafters high  
I cooed Him to sleep that He should not cry  
We cooed Him to sleep my love and I  
I said the dove from the rafters high  
  
Thus every beast by some good spell  
In the stable dark was glad to tell  
Of the gift he gave Emanuel  
Of the gift he gave Emanuel
