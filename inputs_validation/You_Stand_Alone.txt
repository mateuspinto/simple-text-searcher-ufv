Liar liar your pants are on fire  
Youve got a nose as long as a telephone wire  
I swear to tell the truth  
Nothing but the truth  
So help me god  
I cross my heart and hope to die  
These are the words we use  
To get out of situations  
Then I wonder why  
We don t mean what we say  
Then I remembered the terrible truth  
About the truth  
  
Chorus  
If you stand for the truth  
You will always stand alone  
  
The holy book tells us  
The truth will set us free  
But in this world I know different  
Do you believe in the truth  
Do you believe in righteousness  
Do you believe in innocent  
Till proven guilty  
Cause those that tell the truth  
Are always on the runOh God  
Then I wonder why  
We don t mean what we say  
Then I remembered the terrible truth  
About the truth  
  
Chorus
