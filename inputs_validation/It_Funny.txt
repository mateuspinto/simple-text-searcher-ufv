It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me  
Its so ironic youre what I had pictured you to be  
But there are facts in our lives that we can never change  
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same  
This perfect romance that I created in my mind  
Id live a thousand lives each one with you right by my side  
And yet we find ourselves in a less than perfect circumstance  
And so it seems like well never have the chance  
  
Aint it funny how some feelings you just cant deny  
And you cant move on even though you try  
Aint it strange how youre feeling things you shouldnt feel  
Oh I wish this could be real  
Aint it funny how a moment could just change your life  
And you dont wanna face whats wrong or right  
Aint it strange how fate can play a part  
In the story of your heart  
  
Sometimes I think that a true love can never be  
I just believe that somehow it wasnt meant for me  
Life can be cruel in a way that I cant explain  
And I dont think that I could face it all again  
I barely know you but somehow I know what youre about  
A deeper love I found and you and I no longer doubt  
You touhced my heart and it altered every plan I made  
And now I feel that I dont have to be afraid  
  
Aint it funny how some feelings you just cant deny  
And you cant move on even though you try  
Aint it strange how youre feeling things you shouldnt feel  
Oh I wish this could be real  
Aint it funny how a moment could just change your life  
And you dont wanna face whats wrong or right  
Aint it strange how fate can play a part  
In the story of your heart  
  
I locked away my heart but you just set it free  
Emotions I felt held me back from what my life should be  
I pushed you far away and yet you stayed with me  
I guess this means that you and me were meant to be  
  
Aint it funny how some feelings you just cant deny  
And you cant move on even though you try  
Aint it strange how youre feeling things you shouldnt feel  
Oh I wish this could be real  
Aint it funny how a moment could just change your life  
And you dont wanna face whats wrong or right  
Aint it strange how fate can play a part  
In the story of your heart  
  
Aint it funny how some feelings you just cant deny  
And you cant move on even though you try  
Aint it strange how youre feeling things you shouldnt feel  
Oh I wish this could be real  
Aint it funny how a moment could just change your life  
And you dont wanna face whats wrong or right  
Aint it strange how fate can play a part  
In the story of your heart  
  
Aint it funny how some feelings you just cant deny  
And you cant move on even though you try  
Aint it strange how youre feeling things you shouldnt feel  
Oh I wish this could be real  
Aint it funny how a moment could just change your life  
And you dont wanna face whats wrong or right  
Aint it strange how fate can play a part  
In the story of your heart  
  
Aint it funny how some feelings you just cant deny  
And you cant move on even though you try  
Aint it strange how youre feeling things you shouldnt feel  
Oh I wish this could be real  
Aint it funny how a moment could just change your life  
And you dont wanna face whats wrong or right  
Aint it strange how fate can play a part  
In the story of your heart
