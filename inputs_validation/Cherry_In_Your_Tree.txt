Chorus  
Cherry cherry in your tree  
Jump down on the ground and make a pie with me  
Cherry cherry in your tree  
Jump down on the ground and make a pie with me  
  
I got toys like the other boys  
Come down from your tree now  
I can set you free now  
I got toys like the other boys  
For baking love with you  
For baking love with you  
  
Chorus  
  
Im the cook who wrote the book  
Pour a little soul now  
Right into the bowl now  
Im the cook who wrote the book  
  
On baking love with you  
On baking love with you  
Cherry in your tree now  
  
Do you love just me now  
Im the chef of the treble clef  
Roll into the flour now  
Knead it for an hour now
