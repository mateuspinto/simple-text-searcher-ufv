Somthings In The Air  
I feel something in the air  
Something that was never there  
I feel something started to live in me  
Something only God could give to me  
Could give to me  
  
Chorus  
I feel magic every where  
Even though Im supposed to care  
About all the things that my neighbors  
Will think of me and how I should act  
When they said what a nice girl  
I used to be I used to be  
  
My mom will say my god whatve you done  
I told you that boy was only a fun  
My daddy will raise like a storm on the sea  
Say now look what youve done to me  
Even though I care I feel magic in the air  
  
Whats a matter with you baby  
Did you fall too hard when you fall in love  
You fall in love  
Whats a matter with you baby  
Did you fall too hard  
  
Chorus
