Its too late but something tells me I was wrong  
For doing the one thing that I did  
Ah Id prove I can I had let you have your way  
And I gave everything that a girl in love should never give  
When we made love it brought the meanings to my life  
You taught me a brand new way to live  
Ah now its debtful if Ill ever be your wife  
And I gave everything that a girl in love should never give  
I gave you the part of me that no one else had touched  
Because I loved you and you said you wanted me so much  
Now youve changed and its because of what I did  
I gave everything that a girl in love should never give  
You dont know the hurt youve put deep in the heart of me  
Youve got what you wanted now you want no part of me  
Mhm now youve changed and its because of what I did  
I gave everything that a girl in love should never give
