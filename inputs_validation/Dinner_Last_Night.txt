Its ok  
If you lock yourself up at the end of the day  
And its alright  
If youre gonna let us fade  
To nothing  
You worked harder for nothing at all  
Are you alright  
She asked me deep after dinner last night  
  
Hold on man you gotta remember  
Hold on man you gotta be strong  
Hold on man you gotta remember  
You gotta come back you gotta be strong  
  
Are you ok  
Youve been staring far in the days  
Are you alright  
Have I given you enough  
Pick your pleasure  
But be sure that its what you want  
Are you alright  
She asked me deep after dinner last night  
  
Hold on man you gotta remember  
Hold on man you gotta be strong  
Hold on man you gotta remember  
You gotta come back you gotta be strong  
  
Hold on man you gotta remember  
Hold on man you gotta be strong  
Hold on man  
  
Hold on man you gotta remember  
Hold on man you gotta be strong  
Hold on man you gotta remember  
You gotta come back you gotta be strong  
  
Hold on man you gotta remember  
Hold on man you gotta be strong  
Hold on man
