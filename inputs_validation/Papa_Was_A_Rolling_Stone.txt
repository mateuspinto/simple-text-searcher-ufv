It was the third of September  
That day Ill always remember yes I will  
Cause that was the day that my daddy died  
I never got a chance to see him  
Never heard nothin but bad things about him  
Momma Im depending on you to tell me the truth  
Momma just hung her head and said son  
  
Chorus  
Papa was a rolling stone  
Where ever he laid his hat was his home  
And when he died all he left us was alone  
Papa was a rolling stone my son yeah  
Where ever he laid his hat was his home  
And when he died all he left us was alone  
  
Hey Momma  
Is it true what they say that Papa never worked a day in his life  
And Momma some bad talk goin round town sayin that  
Papa had three outside children  
And another wife and that aint right  
Heard some talk Papa doing some store front preachin  
Talking about saving souls and all the time leechin  
Dealing in dirt and stealing in the name of the Lord  
Momma just hung her head and said  
  
Papa was a rolling stone my son  
Where ever he laid his hat was his home  
And when he died all he left us was alone  
Hey Papa was a rolling stone dad gumma it  
Where ever he laid his hat was his home  
And when he died all he left us was alone  
  
Hey Momma  
I heard Papa called himself a jack of all trades  
Tell me is that what sent Papa to an early grave  
Folks say Papa would beg borrow steal  
To pay his bills  
Hey Momma  
Folks say Papa never was much on thinking  
Spent most of his time chasing women and drinking  
Momma Im depending on you to tell me the truth  
Momma looked up with a tear in her eye and said son  
  
Papa was a rolling stone well well well well  
Where ever he laid his hat was his home  
And when he died all he left us was alone lone lone lone alone  
Papa was a rolling stone  
Where ever he laid his hat was his home  
And when he died all he left us was alone  
  
I said Papa was a rolling stone yes he was my son  
Where ever he laid his hat was his home  
And when he died all he left us was alone  
My daddy was yes he was yeah he was  
Papa was a rolling stone  
Where ever he laid his hat was his home
