Evolution revolution are the parents of one another  
Moving ever moving crushing everything that gets in its way  
Smiles telling lies about the future  
I dont want to believe them  
Pity on their faces baby  
Dont you think they laugh in your face  
Wheels of justice they have fallen off  
Mans on crutches being kicked like dogs  
Its a juggernaut its a juggernaut its a juggernaut  
  
Politicians makin money all the time  
They murder our freedom  
Filling up their pockets while the people in the street lay and die  
Man youre working hard as hell  
You only end up payin more taxes  
Give em all your money baby  
Dont you think they give you a bomb  
Lambs were slaughtered for the sacrifice  
Mans now offered up by his own kind  
  
Cry for your soul young and old help your own  
They will need it heed it  
Dont be caught between the stones  
  
Economic pressure and recession in a nation of madness  
Living under fear of countries launching up a nuclear attack  
Men are killing men with paper bullets  
You may wonder how thats done  
Money is the bullet and the dirty greedy heart is the gun  
  
Its a juggernaut its a juggernaut its a juggernaut  
Rise or fall one and all sink or swim  
We can win now oh how we can do it if we try  
  
Superpowers playing chess along a board with people as pieces  
Taking human life just like theyre only sacrificing a pawn  
Dont you know the game is rigged  
The best that they will do is a stalemate  
Who will be the judge of what is right  
When we are lying in graves  
Well inherit from all of our nations  
Not peace only deadly radiation  
Its a juggernaut its a juggernaut its a juggernaut
