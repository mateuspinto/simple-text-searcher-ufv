Lord Byron had a lot of luggage  
He took it when he traveled far and wide  
He didnt get to bathe very often  
Be he liked to change his clothes all the time  
  
I had a little friend named Mister Johnson  
Who always tried to be like me  
He rose to the heights of this profession  
He was hard on his friends and family  
  
Still out here in the wind and rain  
Look a little older but I feel no pain  
And it stands to reason  
Im still looking for love  
  
I went to the Henley Regatta  
Intending to put out to sea  
They pronounced me persona non grata  
Goes to show that you cant come and go as you please  
  
Still out here in the wind and rain  
Look a little older but I feel no pain  
And it stands to reason  
Im still looking for love  
  
Looking for a needle in a haystack  
Its pretty hard to find  
Every dog has his day Jack  
Im still waiting for mine  
  
Still out here in the wind and rain  
A whole lot older but I feel no pain  
And it stands to reason  
Im still looking for love
