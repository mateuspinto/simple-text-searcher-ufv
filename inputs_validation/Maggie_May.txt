Wake up Maggie  
I think I got something to say to you  
Its late September and  
I really should be back at school  
I know I keep you amused  
But I feel Im being used  
Oh Maggie I couldnt have tried any more  
You led me away from home  
Just to save you from being alone  
You stole my heart and thats what really hurts  
  
The morning sun when its in your face  
Really shows your age  
But that dont worry me none  
In my eyes youre everything  
I laughed at all of your jokes  
My love you didnt need to coax  
Oh Maggie I couldnt have tried any more  
You led me away from home  
Just to save you from being alone  
You stole my soul and thats a pain I can do without  
  
All I needed was a friend  
To lend a guiding hand  
But you turned into a lover and mother what a lover  
You wore me out  
All you did was wreck my bed  
And in the morning kick me in the head  
Oh Maggie I couldnt have tried any more  
You led me away from home  
Cause you didnt want to be alone  
You stole my heart I couldnt leave you if I tried  
  
I suppose I could collect my books  
And get on back to school  
Or steal my daddys cue  
And make a living out of playing pool  
Or find myself a rock n roll band  
That needs a helping hand  
Oh Maggie I wish Id never seen your face  
You made a firstclass fool out of me  
But Im as blind as a fool can be  
You stole my heart but I love you anyway
