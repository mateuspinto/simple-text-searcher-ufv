Dolly Parton  
Dr Robert F Thomas  
May his name forever stand  
Dr Robert F Thomas  
Was a mighty mighty man  
And he enriched the lives  
Of everyone that ever knew him  
And in my song I hope to sing  
Some of the praise thats due him  
Dr Thomas was a man  
The Lord must have appointed  
To live among us mountain folks  
In eastern Tennessee  
And he delivered more than half  
The babies in those mountains  
Among those babies  
He delivered me  
There was no way to drive along  
The roads back in those mountains  
But Dr Thomas got there  
Just the same  
He often rode on horseback  
To get where he was needed  
But if he had to walk  
He always came  
Dr Robert F Thomas  
May his name forever stand  
Dr Robert F Thomas  
Was a mighty mighty man  
And he enriched the lives  
Of everyone that ever knew him  
And in my song I hope to sing  
Some of the praise thats due him  
Dr Thomas was a friend  
A neighbor and a doctor  
Though he seldom got a dime  
For all hed done  
And I remember lots of times  
We sent for Dr Thomas  
But I dont recall a time  
He didnt come  
They say a man is judged  
By the deeds he does while livin  
A judgement when he stands  
Before the Lord  
And I know heaven holds a place  
For men like Dr Thomas  
And I know that hell receive  
His just reward  
Dr Robert F Thomas  
May his name forever stand  
Dr Robert F Thomas  
Was a mighty mighty man  
And he enriched the lives  
Of everyone that ever knew him  
And in my song I hope to sing  
Some of the praise thats due him
