I had a dog his name was Jim  
Runaway runaway runaway  
Took all of my old clothes with him  
Runaway runaway runaway  
Oh runaway Jim  
Oh runaway Jim  
He was twelve years old when his trip began  
Runaway runaway runaway  
Hauling down the highway in my old sedan  
Runaway runaway runaway  
Oh runaway Jim  
Oh runaway Jim  
Now I wish someoned tell me where old Jim went  
Runaway runaway runaway  
Cause he took all the money that I saved for rent  
Runaway runaway runaway  
Oh runaway Jim  
Oh runaway Jim  
Time he came home he was seventeen  
Runaway runaway runaway  
Thats a hundred nineteen to you and me  
Runaway runaway runaway  
Oh runaway Jim  
Oh runaway Jim  
Now Im gonna go up to the mountain  
Runaway runaway runaway  
Singing for Dave whos swimming in the fountain  
Runaway runaway runaway  
Oh runaway Jim  
Oh runaway Jim  
Oh runaway dogs  
Oh runaway dog
