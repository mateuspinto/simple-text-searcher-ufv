Im the man of a thousand faces  
A little piece of me in every part I take  
I hold the tape for a thousand races  
A different point of view in every speech I make  
Cut me a piece of my divided soul  
Cry me a river call it rock and roll  
Give me an attitude and watch me make it lie  
Pass me a microphone  
I need to testify  
  
Well I speak to machines with the voice of humanity  
Speak to the wise with the voice of insanity  
Speak to the present in the past and future tense  
Speak to a slave with the voice of obedience  
  
Im the man of a thousand ages  
You see my face in the stones of the Parthenon  
You hear my song in the babble of Babylon  
Im the man of a thousand riches  
Be my guest at the feast of Satyricon  
You spend the money that my logos printed on  
  
Well Ill speak to machines with the voice of humanity  
Speak to the wise with the voice of insanity  
Speak to the present in the past and future tense  
Speak to a slave with the voice of obedience  
  
I stole a fire but it burned up much too soon  
I took a leap and I landed on the moon  
Look at my life and it looks like CNN  
You see something once  
You know its gonna come around again  
  
Well Ill speak to machines with the voice of humanity  
Speak to the wise with the voice of insanity  
Speak to a woman with the fatal charm of a snake  
Forgive like a giver and account for all I take  
Yes I speak to machines with the voice of humanity  
Speak to the wise with the voice of insanity  
Speak like a leader with the voice of power and command  
And when I talk to God I know hell understand  
  
Cause Im the man of a thousand faces  
Yes Im the man of a thousand faces  
  
I stole a fire but it burned up too much too soon  
I took a leap and I landed on the moon  
  
Voice of command  
Voice of a snake  
Voice of humanity  
Voice of insanity  
Voice of obedience  
Thousand faces  
Thousand races  
Cry me a river  
Steal a fire  
Face in the stars  
Stones in the Parthenon  
Babble of Babylon  
Landed on the moon
