I talked with a stranger so sad and forlorn  
His garments were sack cloth all tattered and town  
He told me a story of sorrow and woe  
His heart went to heaven at the first fall of snow  
  
He spoke of his angel a dear baby girl he loved every footstep he loved every
curl  
But she went to heaven just one year ago  
The angels came for her at the first fall of snow  
He still have the dolly that she used to love  
  
He held and caressed it and he gazed up above  
He whispered my darling youre waiting I know  
Ill bring you your dolly at the first fall of snow  
And there as I listened then my eyes filled with tears  
  
I knew she was part of his happier years  
His frail body trembled he spoke soft and low  
Ill be with my darling at the first fall of snow  
I just couldnt tell him how I felt inside  
  
I patted his shoulder my feelings too high  
He smiled as we partred cause he didnt know  
That wed lost our darling at the first fall of snow
