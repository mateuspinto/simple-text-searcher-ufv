Moon over Miami  
Shine on my love and me  
So we can stroll beside the roll  
Of the rolling sea  
  
Moon over miami  
Shine on as we begin  
A dream or two that may come true  
When the tide comes in  
  
Hark to the song of the smiling troubadours  
Hark to the throbbing guitars  
Hear how the waves offer thunderous applause  
After each song to the stars  
  
Moon over Miami  
You know were waiting for  
A little love  
A little kiss  
  
On Miami shore
