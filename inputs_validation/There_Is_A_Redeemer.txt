There is a redeemer  
Jesus Gods own Son  
Precious Lamb of God Messiah  
Holy One  
  
Jesus my redeemer  
Name above all names  
Precious Lamb of God Messiah  
Hope for sinners slain  
  
Thank you oh my father  
For giving us Your Son  
And sending Your Spirit  
Til the work on Earth is done  
  
When I stand in Glory  
I will see His face  
And there Ill serve my King forever  
In that Holy Place  
  
Thank you oh my Father  
For giving us Your Son  
And sending Your Spirit  
Til the work on Earth is done  
  
There is a Redeemer  
Jesus Gods own Son  
Precious Lamb of God Messiah  
Holy One  
  
Thank you oh my Father  
For giving us Your Son  
And sending Your Spirit  
Til the work on Earth is done  
  
And sending Your Spirit  
Till the work on Earth is done
