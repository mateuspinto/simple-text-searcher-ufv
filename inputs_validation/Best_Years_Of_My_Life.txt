Thank goodness for the curtains that I draped around the windows in my room  
They keep the sun from shining through so it wont find me here in all my
gloom  
My eyes are red and swollen from the tears that babys leaving me as left  
I havent got the heart to go out to face the world alone just yet  
God knows Im just as empty as the closet where he used to hang his clothes
And passing by that mirror I see ten years of my life just come and go  
The radio is playing some old song that baby used to sing to me  
And in between my heartbeats Lord I think about the way it used to be  
I tied the best years of my life around his love  
Passing my world to his and gave my heart the cause  
I believed him everything is sad I thought that how it was  
I tied the best years of my life around his love  
  
I crossed the bridge of memory  
Where the grass was green and his sweet dream was mine  
But all about is over now hes broken all those precious ties that bind  
I tied the best years of my life
