Long ago a young man sits  
And plays his waiting game  
But things are not the same it seems  
As in such tender dreams  
  
Slowly passing sailing ships  
On sunday afternoon  
Like the people on the moon Ive seen  
Are things not meant to be  
  
Where do those golden rainbows end  
where do the rainbows end  
Why is this song so sad  
why is this song so sad  
Dreaming the dreams I dream my friend  
dreaming the dreams I dream  
Loving the love I love  
  
To love is just a word Ive heard  
When things are being said  
Stories my poor head has told me  
Can not stand the cold  
  
And in between what might have been  
And what has come to pass  
Are misbegotten guests alas  
And bits of broken glass  
  
Where do your golden rainbows end  
where do the rainbows end  
Why is the song I sing so sad  
why is this song so sad  
Dreaming the dreams I dream my friend  
dreaming the dreams I dream  
Loving the love I love  
To love to love to love  
  
Where do your golden rainbows end  
where do the rainbows end  
Why is the song I sing so sad  
why is this song so sad  
Dreaming the dreams I dream my friend  
dreaming the dreams I dream  
Loving the love I love  
To love to love to love  
Whoa no no no no no
