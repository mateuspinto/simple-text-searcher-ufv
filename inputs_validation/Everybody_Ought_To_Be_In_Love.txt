Empty rooms behind me no more nights alone  
A table and some chairs for two  
Now the world will find me with someone of my own  
The loneliness at last is through  
If everyone had someone just like you  
Then everyone would feel the way I do  
  
  
Imagine having someone always by your side  
A bed for one can just be so cold  
Someone you can talk to when your hands are tied  
Someone there to have and hold  
Theres nothing more rewarding to produce when youre in love and you hear  
I love you  
  
  
Somebody to love  
Theres nothing more rewarding to produce when youre in love and you hear  
I love you  
  
  
Theres nothing more rewarding to produce when youre in love and you hear  
I love you
