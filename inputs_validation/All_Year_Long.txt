This Christmas season I wish you joy  
The wonder in every girl and boy  
I wish you gladness the one Incomprehensible  
Have good friends and family gathered near  
May childrens laughter in falling snow  
Rekindle those sweet scenes from long ago  
May every carol each candle bright  
Remind you why angels sang that night  
If trouble finds you this is my prayer  
May peace come into your hearts and make you strong  
And I wish you luck the kind to last all year long
