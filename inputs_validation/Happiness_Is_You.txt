Way down the mountain I chased a moonbeam  
On the beach I built sand castles too  
My moonbeams faded my castles tumbled  
All of this was meaningless cause happiness is you  
No more chasing moonbeams or catching falling stars  
I know now my pot of gold is anywhere you are  
My heart wont miss you my heart goes with you  
Loneliness is emptiness but happiness is you  
I tried to doubt you and live without you  
Tried to deny but I love you like a do  
But I realize now and Ill admit it  
Youll always be a part of me cause happiness is you  
No more chasing moonbeams
