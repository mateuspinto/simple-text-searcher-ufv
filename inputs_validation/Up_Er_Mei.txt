We were walking in paradise never did notice  
Blind in the Buddha land looking for solace  
We had been told of a place  
Far beyond this vale of tears  
We could never have guessed  
We were already blessed  
There we were where we are in the garden  
  
Didnt we climb on up Er Mei temple to temple  
Yes and all and all along the way  
The day was simple  
Didnt we reach the top didnt we gain our goal  
Did we finally stop surprised by the cold  
  
We were walking in paradise never did tumble  
Blind in the Buddha land looking for trouble  
We had been told of a place  
Far beyond this vale of tears  
We could never have guessed  
We were already blessed  
There we were where we are  
In the garden in the garden
