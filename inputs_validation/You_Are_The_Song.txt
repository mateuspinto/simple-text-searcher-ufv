Lyrics by Glen Anthony  
Music by Charlie Chaplin  
My love you are the song  
That sings inside of me  
The song is always the same  
It starts with love and ends with your name  
The more that I love you  
Theres more in you to love  
And yet I just dont know how  
I could love you more than I do right now  
They say that love grows old  
But our love turned to gold  
You kissed my sorrows away  
You touched my heart  
What more can I say  
Each day my life is new  
For God blessed me with you  
And when my life is all through  
Without a word you always knew  
That all my life my life was you
