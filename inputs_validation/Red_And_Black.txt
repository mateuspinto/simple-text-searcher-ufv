Combeferre  
At Notre Dame  
The sections are prepared  
  
Fueilly  
At rue de Bac  
Theyre straining at the leash  
  
Courfeyrac  
Students workers everyone  
Theres a river on the run  
Like the flowing of the tide  
Paris coming to our side  
  
Enjolras  
The time is near  
So near its stirring the blood in their veins  
And yet beware  
Dont let the wine go to your brains  
For the army we fight is a dangerous foe  
With the men and the arms that we never can match  
Oh its easy to sit here and swat em like flies  
But the national guard will be harder to catch  
We need a sign  
To rally the people  
To call them to arms  
To bring them in line  
Marius youre late  
  
Jean Provaire  
Whats wrong today  
You look as if youve seen a ghost  
  
Grantaire  
Some wine and say whats going on  
  
Marius  
A ghost you say a ghost maybe  
She was just like a ghost to me  
One minute there and she was gone  
  
Grantaire  
I am agog  
I am aghast  
Is Marius in love at last  
I have never heard him ooh and aah  
You talk of battles to be won  
But here he comes like Don Juan  
Its better than an opera  
  
Enjolras  
It is time for us all  
To decide who we are  
Do we fight for the right  
To a night at the opera now  
Have you asked of yourselves  
Whats the price you might pay  
Is it simply a game  
For rich young boys to play  
The colors of the world  
Are changing  
Day by day  
Red  the blood of angry men  
Black  the dark of ages past  
Red  a world about to dawn  
Black  the night that ends at last  
  
Marius  
Had you been there tonight  
You might know how it feels  
To be struck to the bone  
In a moment of breathless delight  
Had you been there tonight  
You might also have known  
How the world may be changed  
In just one burst of light  
And what was right  
Seems wrong  
And what was wrong  
Seems right  
  
Grantaire  
Red  
  
Marius  
I feel my soul on fire  
  
Grantaire  
Black  
  
Marius  
My world if shes not there  
  
Chorus  
Red  
  
Marius  
The color of desire  
  
Chorus  
Black  
  
Marius  
The color of despair  
  
Enjolras  
Marius youre no longer a child  
I do not doubt you mean it well  
But now there is a higher call  
Who cares about your lonely soul  
We strive toward a larger goal  
Our little lives dont count at all  
  
Enjolras and Chorus  
Red  the blood of angry men  
Black  the dark of ages past  
Red  a world about to dawn  
Black  the night that ends at last  
  
Enjolras  
Well Courfeyrac do we have all the guns  
Feuilly Combeferre our time is running short  
Grantaire put the bottle down  
Do we have the guns we need  
  
Grantaire drunk  
Give me brandy on my breath  
And Ill breath em all to death  
  
Courfeyrac  
In St Antoine theyre with us to a man  
  
Combeferre  
In Notre Dame theyre tearing up the stones  
  
Feuilly  
Twenty rifles good as new  
  
Gavroche rushes in shouting  
  
Gavroche  
Listen  
  
Jean Prouvaire  
Double that in Port St Cloud  
  
Gavroche  
Listen everybody  
General Lamarque  
Is dead  
  
Enjolras  
Lamarque is dead  
Lamarque His death is the hour of fate  
The peoples man  
His death is the sign we await  
On his funeral day they will honor his name  
With the light of rebellion a blaze in their eyes  
From the candles of grief we will kindle our flame  
On the tomb of Lamarque shall the barricade rise  
The time is here  
Let us welcome it gladly with courage and cheer  
Let us take to the streets with no doubt in our hearts  
But a jubilant shout  
They will come one and all  
They will come when we call
