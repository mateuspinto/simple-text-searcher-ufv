Knights in shining karma  
Tend your flame  
And with love for armor  
Theyll remain  
  
Ever by your bed  
Guarding still sleeping  
Shield your soul from this rain  
Knights in shining karma will remain  
  
Jealous winter sun  
Cold as vichyssoise  
Steals your smile for fuel  
Theyll ignite with braziers  
Of warming stars  
  
Knights in shining karma  
Wash your feet  
And with spotless dharma come complete  
  
Ever by your sink drying  
Up tea tears  
Shield your soul from this heat  
Knights in shining karma come complete  
  
Swollen summer moon  
Hot as boiling air  
Poach your dreams to ash  
Theyll bring sips from restful slumbers  
Cooling keg  
  
Jealous winter sun
