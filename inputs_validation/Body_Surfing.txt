Took a walk down by the ocean  
I was alone nothing on my mind  
As I stood there I saw the devotion  
That the surf had with the shore  
Suddenly  
I felt this emotion of the sea  
Pulling me  
  
Chorus  
Big Kahuna tide was high  
I began body surfing for my life  
  
Ecstasy sky and the sea  
Embracing me  
Golden sun on my face  
Giving life to me  
  
Unafraid I let go  
Trusting in the deep blue sea  
We became one with each other  
Watching the tide as it drifts away  
  
Chorus  
  
I spoke to me daddy  
Said to me son  
You got to go find a job  
And bring some money into the family  
For your mommy and me  
  
I say Daddy me want to go to the seashore  
And body surf all day long  
Me no want to work  
Me want to play  
Me want to body surf all day  
Me told him  
Me want to go body surfing  
Me tell him  
Me tell him  
No me want to go
