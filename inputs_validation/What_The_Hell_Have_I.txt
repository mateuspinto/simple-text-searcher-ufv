The face before me flies  
Laughs at me inside  
Masks are made to hide the glow  
Shining eyes  
Distance tween us grows  
Feeding lies  
  
Its hard to start things over  
You can feel the fire around us  
All the time  
Yeah  
  
Something I should say  
It takes you every day  
What you give is not alive  
Today  
Your soul served on a plate  
Throw it away  
  
Its hard to start things over  
You can feel the fire around us  
All the time  
Yeah  
  
Its hard to start things over  
Oh yeah  
You can feel the fire around us  
All the time  
Yeah  
  
Its hard to start things over  
Oh yeah  
You can feel the fire around us  
All the time  
Yeah  
  
All the time  
  
What the hell have I  
Little pride
