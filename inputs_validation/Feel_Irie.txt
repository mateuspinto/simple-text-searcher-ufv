How long shall you carry  
That burden on your shoulders  
How long shall those tears  
Keep rolling down  
Your beautiful face  
We all have troubles  
Now and again know what Im saying  
  
Chorus  
No matter how hard we try  
Trouble will find us one way or another  
People had trouble since the pope  
Was an alter boy  
People had worries from when the  
Dead sea was only critical  
Hear those drums rolling  
Listen to those guitars skanking  
Yeah Put a smile on your face  
Dont let the troubles get you down  
Let me tell you how we feel  
  
We feel irie  
Do you feel like we do  
  
No man can hide from his fears  
Since they are part of him  
Theyll always know where to find him  
Come on and walk tall and  
Keep your head high  
  
I tell you again and again  
Put a smile on your face  
Dont let the troubles  
Get you down  
  
Chorus until fade
