You were just an innocent soul  
When the darkness came and stole your light away  
How can you be anything but still  
When the warmths of tomorrows  
Buried in the chills of yesterday  
Dive into the deep find it in you to believe  
In a place your wounded heart has never known  
If you dare reach for me I wont let you fall alone  
  
Have a little faith  
Have a little hope  
Have a little trust  
In the great unknown  
  
Loves been a razor deep in your chest  
Made you feel like your runnin  
Out of breathe in slow quicksand  
Its no kind of life being locked down tight  
A heart like a flower needs a little light and a gentle hand  
Let suspicion come to rest cast away the loneliness  
That you have carried to long  
Wrap yours arms around this moment  
Now before its gone  
  
Have a little faith  
Have a little hope  
Have a little trust  
In the great unknown  
  
Let the memories go blind and release your mind  
From the ghost that rage inside of you  
How can I get you to see baby you could never be  
To lost for me to find you  
  
Just have a little faith  
Just a little faith  
  
You and I can be ones who believe  
In a love that lingers eternally  
You and I could stay ever this way  
In a love that lingers eternally  
In a love that lingers eternally
