Baby I dont understand  
How just the touch of your hand  
Can make me feel invincible  
Do you know just where you take me  
Do you know how high you make me  
I need your kiss like oxygen  
With your arms warm around me  
When your eyes look deep into me  
Its unstoppable baby anything is possible  
  
Everything I want to be  
Any dream I want to dream I can  
Because of your love  
Anywhere I ever go  
With all of my heart I know I am the man I am  
Because of your love  
  
Dont know how I lived before you  
Now I live to explore you  
Take me girl to your secret world  
Where I can swim in your deep blue passion  
Or I could feel your love come crashing  
Over me endlessly  
Whether youre right by my side  
Or whether you and I are a million miles apart  
I can always feel you in my heart  
  
Chorus Repeat 2X  
Oh baby  
Because of your love
