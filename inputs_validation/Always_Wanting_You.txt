Always wanting you but never having you  
Makes it hard to face tomorrow cause I know Ill wake up wanting you again  
Always loving you ah but never touching you  
Sometimes hurts me almost more than I can stand  
  
Id been better off if I turned away and never looked at you the second time  
Cause I really had my life all together till your eyes met mine  
And there I saw you yearning and the feeling frost the room that you felt for
me  
Wish Id had a way of knowin that the things we had in mind could never be  
Always wanting you  
  
Always loving you ah but never touching you  
Sometimes hurts me almost more than I can stand
