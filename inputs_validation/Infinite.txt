Oh yeah this is Eminem baby  
Back up in that motherfucking ass  
One time for your mother fucking mind  
We represent the 313  
You know what Im saying cause they dont know shit about this  
For the 96  
  
Ayo my pen and paper cause a chain reaction  
To get your brain relaxing a zany acting maniac in action  
A brainiac in fact son you mainly lack attraction  
You look insanely whack when just a fraction of my tracks run  
My rhyming skills got you climbing hills  
I travel through your mind into your spine like siren drills  
Im sliming grills of roaches with sprayed on disinfectants  
Twist the necks of rappers til their spinal column disconnects  
We disinfect then check the monologue turn your system up  
Twist them up and indulge in the marijuana smog  
This is the season for noise pollution contamination  
Examination of more cartoons than animation  
My lamination of narration  
Hits a snare and bass of track fucked up rapper interrogation  
When I declare invasion there aint no time to be stare and gazing  
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland  
Im infinite  
  
You heard of hell well I was sent from it  
I went to it serving a sentence for murderin instruments  
Now Im trying to repent from it  
But when I hear the beat Im tempted to make another attempt at it  
Im infinite  
  
Bust it I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense in your elite defense  
I got some meat to mince a crew to stomp and two feet to rinse  
I greet the gents and ladies I spoil loyal fans  
I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans  
My coil hands around this microphone are lethal  
One thought in my cerebral is deeper then a Jeep full of people  
MCs are feeble I came to cause some pandemonium  
Battle a band of phony MCs and stand the lonely one  
Imitator intimidator stimulator simulator of data eliminator  
Theres never been a greater since the burial of Jesus  
Fuck around and catch all of the venereal diseases  
My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces  
My accapella releases classic masterpieces through telekinesis  
And eases you mentally gently sentimentally instrumentally  
With entity dementedly meant to be infinite  
  
You heard of hell well I was sent from it  
I went to it serving a sentence for murderin instruments  
Now Im trying to repent from it  
But when I hear the beat Im tempted to make another attempt at it  
Im infinite  
  
Man I got evidence Im never dense and I been clever ever since  
My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the MO  
So Im assuming all responsibility  
Cause theres a monster will in me that always wants to kill MCs  
Mic messaler slamming like a wrestler  
Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler  
No one is specialer My skill is intergalactical  
I get cynical act a fool then I send a crew back to school  
I never packed a tool or acted cool it wasnt practical  
Id rather let a tactical tact full track tickle your fancy  
In fact I cant see or cant imagine  
A man who aint a lover of beats or a fan of scratching  
So this is for my family the kid who had a cameo on my last jam  
Plus the man who never had a plan B  
Be all you can be cause once you make an instant hit  
Im tensed a bit and tempted when I see the sins my friends commit  
Im infinite  
  
You heard of hell well I was sent from it  
I went to it serving a sentence for murderin instruments  
Now Im trying to repent from it  
But when I hear the beat Im tempted to make another attempt at it  
Im infinite  
You heard of hell well I was sent from it  
I went to it serving a sentence for murderin instruments  
Now Im trying to repent from it  
But when I hear the beat Im tempted to make another attempt at it  
Im infinite
