I bless you madly  
Sadly as I tie my shoes  
I love you badly  
Just in time at times I guess  
Because of you I need to rest  
Because its you  
That sets the test  
  
So much has gone  
And little is new  
And as the sparrow sings  
Dawn chorus for  
Someone else to hear  
The Thinker sits alone growing older  
And so bitter  
  
I gave Them life  
I gave Them all  
They drained my very soul  
Dry  
I crushed my heart  
To ease their pains  
No thought for me remains there  
Nothing can they spare  
What of me  
Who praised their efforts  
To be free  
Words of strength and care  
And sympathy  
I opened doors  
That would have blocked their way  
I braved their cause to guide  
For little pay  
  
I ravaged at my finance just for those  
Those whose claims were steeped in peace tranquility  
Those who said a new world new ways ever free  
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me  
  
I bless you madly  
Sadly as I tie my shoes  
I love you badly just in time  
At times I guess  
Because of you I need to rest oh yes  
Because its you  
That sets the test  
  
So much has gone  
And little is new  
And as the sunrise stream  
Flickers on me  
My friends talk  
Of glory untold dream where all is God and God is just a word  
  
We had a friend a talking man  
Who spoke of many powers that he had  
Not of the best of men but ours  
  
We used him  
We let him use his powers  
We let him fill our needs  
Now we are strong  
  
And the road is coming to its end  
Now the damned have no time to make amends  
No purse of token fortune stands in our way  
The silent guns of love  
Will blast the sky  
We broke the ruptured structure built of age  
Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage  
  
Where money stood  
We planted seeds of rebirth  
And stabbed the backs of fathers  
Sons of dirt  
  
Infiltrated business cesspools  
Hating through our sleeves  
Yea and we slit the Catholic throat  
Stoned the poor  
On slogans such as  
  
Wish You Could Hear  
Love Is All We Need  
Kick Out The Jams  
Kick Out Your Mother  
Cut Up Your Friend  
Screw Up Your Brother or Hell Get You In the End  
  
And we know the flag of love is from above  
And we can force you to be free  
And we can force you to believe  
  
And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain  
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain  
For they knew not the words of the Free States refrain  
It said  
I believe in the power of good  
I believe in the state of love  
I will fight for the right to be right  
I will kill for the good of the fight for the right to be right  
  
And I open my eyes to look around  
And I see a child laid slain  
On the ground  
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows  
Plowing down man woman listening to its command  
But not hearing anymore  
Not hearing anymore  
Just the shrieks from the old rich  
  
And I want to believe  
In the madness that calls Now  
And I want to believe  
That a lights shining through  
Somehow  
  
And I want to believe  
And you want to believe  
And we want to believe  
And we want to live  
Oh we want to live  
  
We want to live  
We want to live  
We want to live  
We want to live  
We want to live  
  
I want to live  
I want to live  
I want to live  
  
I want to live  
I want to live  
I want to live  
  
Live  
Live  
Live
