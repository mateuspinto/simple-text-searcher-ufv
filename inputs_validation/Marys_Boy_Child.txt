Long time ago in Bethlehem  
So the holy Bible say  
The Marys boy child Jesus Christ  
Was born on Christmas Day  
  
Hark now hear the angels sing  
A new King was born today  
And man will live forever more  
Because of Christmas Day  
  
And you know when I was in school  
We used to sing it something like this listen here  
  
While the good shepherds watching their flocks by night  
Them see a bright new shining star  
They hear the heavenly choir just singing a song  
That the music seemed to come from afar  
  
But now wait a minute Im talking about  
Now Joseph and his sweet wife Mary  
You know God come to Bethlehem that night  
Them find no place yes he did to born that she child  
Not a single room was in sight  
  
Alvin singing and listen  
  
By and by they find a little nook  
In a stable all forlorn   
And in a manger cold and dark   
Marys little boy was born  
  
You know I wish I had somebody to help me sing this  
Trumpets sound and angels sing listen to what they say  
Trumpets sound I love you and angels sing you see  
Oh Lord be careful listen what they say  
And you oughta love him for it  
Cause that that that that man will live  
He told me he would forever more  
Because of Christmas Day  
Oh Lord oh Lord I thank you Lord  
Christmas Day
