Lost his own taken down  
All his songs  
Till his all alone  
And all our love was harmed  
cept for you  
Im only young favorite son  
Say you tried take it back  
To where you belong  
And all the things you say  
  
Still untrue  
We saw the green fields  
Turn into homes  
Such lonely homes  
We saw the green fields  
Turn into homes  
Such lovely homes  
Do what you want to do  
I was digging up sorting out  
Only to built a song alone  
Till you came along  
But all my love was there  
Just all for you  
And in the darkest time  
We crossed the line  
Made a song  
Cause all the talk was wrong  
And all you ever won  
  
Can still be true  
We saw the green fields  
Turn into homes  
Such lonely homes  
We saw the green fields  
Turn into stone  
Such lonely homes  
We saw the green fields  
Turn into homes  
Such lovely homes  
We saw the green fields  
Turn into stone  
Such lonely stone  
Now all my love is out  
Its just for you  
Its not a love song  
Its the last song for you
