Ahhh ahhh  
Ill wait here youre crazy  
Those vicious streets are filled with strays  
You should have never gone to Hollywood  
  
They find you twotime you  
Say youre the best theyve ever seen  
You should have never trusted Hollywood  
  
I wrote you and told you  
You were the biggest fish out here  
You should have never gone to Hollywood  
  
They take you and make you  
They look at you in disgusting ways  
You should have never trusted Hollywood  
  
Ahhh ahhh  
  
I was standing on the wall feeling ten feet tall  
All you maggots smoking fags on Santa Monica Boulevard  
  
This is my front page This is my new rage  
All you bitches put your hands in the air and wave them like you just dont
care

All you maggots smoking fags out there on Sunset Boulevard  
All you bitches put your hands in the air and wave them like you just dont
care  
  
Ahhh ahhh  
  
Phony people come to pay  
Look at all of them beg to stay  
Phony people come to pray  
  
The lines in the letter said  
Look at all of them beg to stay  
We had gone to reckon send  
Phony people come to pray  
  
Ahhh ahhh  
All you maggots smoking fags on Santa Monica Boulevard  
  
Ahhh ahhh  
All you maggots smoking fags out there on Sunset Boulevard  
  
Ahhh ahhh  
All you maggots smoking fags out there on Hollywood Boulevard  
  
Ahhh ahhh

You should have never gone to Hollywood  
  
Ahhh ahhh

care
