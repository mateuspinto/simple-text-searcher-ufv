Days of old when knights were bold Britain ruled supreme  
Songs were sung and tales were told life was like a dream  
Top men like the great King Arthur never came here ever after  
Ever since those gallant heroes gone  
  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said falling down  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said falling down  
  
Noted for diplomacy once the mighty fall  
Touching pmp of pageantry history books all show  
Husky dogs and great explorers  
Mighty kings and sage warriors  
Trouble take me since theyre dead and gone  
  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said falling down  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said falling down  
  
Early evening entertainment  
People sleeping on the pavement  
In the eyes of god we must be wrong  
  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said falling down  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said falling down  
  
Time was when a British Empire was in full control  
France and Spain were just the same if the truth be known  
Now the walls are down in Europe  
Forming laws with certain Arabs  
Better get your petrol while you can  
  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said falling down  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said falling down  
  
Like the grip of an old King Kong  
From South Africa to Hong Kong  
Now the times are moving on and  
  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said falling down  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said falling down  
  
In the days gone by wed pay for the things wed got  
Now we pay to advertise while we sell the lot  
All the companies we started sold out on the open market  
Where are jobs now that theyre gone  
  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said falling down  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said falling down  
  
If were sure we want to stay  
On this our base for the us of A  
Then its time that we should say that  
  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said falling down  
London Bridge is falling down  
Falling down I said falling down  
  
London Bridge is falling down  
London Bridge is falling down  
London Bridge is falling down
