Deep in my dreams  
I saw you close by my side  
And the words you said to me  
Made me reel down deep inside  
My hand in your hand  
So warm and so lovingly  
Leaving all my dreams behind  
Wonder who my prince will be  
  
Chorus  
What is this wonder  
That love can make you feel  
Am I deep now in slumber  
Or is my prince real  
Now now my dream  
Is standing close by my side  
Saying words I wish to hear  
And Im reeling deep inside  
  
Chorus  
Morning has come  
My dreams are left far behind  
As I walk through Paris streets  
I know now what I shall find  
This smile on my face  
Will carry a love I have known  
Like a fairytale come true  
Oh what joy this love has shown
