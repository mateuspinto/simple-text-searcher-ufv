When we met I got wet  
Just waiting for the chance  
To dance at your feet  
And wipe your wooden seat  
  
Chorus  
Trevor youre bizarre  
I wish that you could tell  
Trevor youll go far  
I certainly wish you well  
  
He said I am dead  
My career has passed its peak  
And Im weak and youre strong  
Youll have to sing this song  
  
Chorus  
  
Your words your fears  
Who do they touch on this earth  
Who gave birth  
Surely they couldve done worse  
  
Chorus  
  
Shame he was nice a nice boy  
Just filled with guts and joy  
But he died and an audience of one cried  
Shame he was nice  
Filled with guts and joy filled with guts and joy  
He sang it from his heart  
And all who said they heard  
  
Said he sang it from his heart
