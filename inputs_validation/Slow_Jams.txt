Baby dim the lights  
So while I pour the wine  
Set the music up nice and slow  
Wanna move with you inside a groove  
Like no ones ever known  
Let your body unwind in the warmth of mine  
Tell me what you like  
Cause tonite I wanna turn you up to paradise  
  
Sweet thang hold me close  
Share my desire  
And we can make the magic flow  
Once the music is right  
  
Give me slow jams and hot romance  
Rock me with that tender dance  
Baby get closer so we can feel the power of love  
Share my sweet groove the whole night through  
Let me lay my beat on you  
Well keep the music playing movin in time  
  
Let me get a taste of some babyface  
And you know itll be alright  
Cause the road that ends at boyz ii men  
Is the road I wanna ride  
We can go to the moon on a stevie tune  
Fly ribbons in the sky  
Give me everything are Kelly sings  
Let us bump and grind  
  
Baby feel the beat  
Here in my heart  
Move with me in ecstacy  
Let the melody start  
  
Give me slow jams and hot romance  
Rock me in that tender dance  
I wanna feel the passion so give me all you got  
Share my sweet groove the whole night through  
Make tonight a dream come true  
Lets keep this groove thing going and never never  
Never let it stop  
  
Its something that feels so right  
Take this side of your rhythm  
  
Baby tonights your night  
When I feel your beat inside my soul  
Its a do me groove I know I cant control  
  
Sweet thang hold me close  
Share my desire  
We can make the magic flow  
Once the music is rockin  
  
Give me slow jams and hot romance  
Rock me with that tender dance  
I wanna feel the passion so give me all you got  
Share my sweet groove the whole night through  
Let me lay my beat on you  
Lets keep this good thing going  
Movin in time with something good
