Why should I bend down my head and cry  
Why should I bend down my head and cry  
The old world has ended  
The new world has just begun  
And all them people that live therein  
Shall live on and on  
One more thing  
Got to get what I need  
Got to get what I want  
Got to get what I need  
Got to get what I want  
Got to get satisfaction  
Got to get the action  
Got love and affection  
One more thing  
Once there was two roads before us  
To pick our choice  
But good has overcome bad  
The sheep has heard their masters voice  
So tell me why  
Why should I bend down my head and cry  
No reason why  
Why should I bend down my head and cry  
Got to move Got to groove  
Got to get what I want  
What did you say  
Got to get it  
Got to get what I need  
Got to get what I want  
Like I say got to get it  
Got to get what I need Satisfaction  
The old world has ended  
The new world has just begun  
And all them people that live therein  
Shall live on and on  
One more thing  
Why should I bend down my head and cry  
My father is a king  
Why should I bend down my head and cry  
All the riches in the earth  
So tell me why  
Why should I bend down my head and cry
