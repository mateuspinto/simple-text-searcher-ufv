Oh where oh where can my baby be  
The Lord took her away from me  
Shes gone to heaven so I got to be good  
So I can see my baby when I leave this world  
  
We were out on a date in my daddys car  
We hadnt driven very far  
There in the road up straight ahead  
A car was stalled the engine was dead  
I couldnt stop so I swerved to the right  
Ill never forget the sound that night  
The screaming tires the busting glass  
The painful scream that I heard last  
  
Oh where oh where can my baby be  
The Lord took her away from me  
Shes gone to heaven so I got to be good  
So I can see my baby when I leave this world  
  
When I woke up the rain was falling down  
There were people standing all around  
Something warm flowing through my eyes  
But somehow I found my baby that night  
I lifted her head she looked at me and said  
Hold me darling just a little while  
I held her close I kissed her our last kiss  
I found the love that I knew I had missed  
But now shes gone even though I hold her tight  
I lost my love my life that night  
  
Oh where oh where can my baby be  
The Lord took her away from me  
Shes gone to heaven so I got to be good  
So I can see my baby when I leave this world  
Oh oh
