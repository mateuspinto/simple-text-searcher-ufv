Last night sorta got so insane  
As I went riding on the all night train  
Took it down the street and around the block  
Took it downtown baby where the big boys rock  
Roll on roll on  
Take me where I can ease my pain  
Preacher say boy now where you been  
Getting lead in my pockets  
Putting money in sin  
When the morning comes not a nickel to my name  
Threw it all away on the all night train  
Ride let the passenger ride  
Ride let the passenger ride  
I woke up late yesterday afternoon  
My eyeballs feeling like two balloons  
The doctor say things aint never gonna change  
Till you stop riding that all night train  
Ride let the passenger ride  
Ride let the passenger ride  
Took a little trip to keep from going insane  
Spent the rest of my life on the all night train  
All night train  
All night train  
All night train
