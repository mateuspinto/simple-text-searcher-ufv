I am all alone this time around  
Sometimes on the side I hear a sound  
Places parallel I know its you  
Feel the little pieces bleeding through  
  
And on this goes on  
And on and on and on and on and on and on and on  
This goes on  
And on and on and on and on and on and on and on  
  
Now that Ive decided not to stay  
I can feel me start to fade away  
Everything is back where it belongs  
I will be beside you before long  
  
And on this goes on  
And on and on and on and on and on and on and on  
This goes on  
And on and on and on and on and on and on and on  
  
We will never die  
Beside you in time  
We will never die  
Beside you in time
