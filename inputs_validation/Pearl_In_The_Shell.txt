And the fear goes on shadows  
And the tear flows on for nothing  
And the fear goes on shadows  
And the tear flows on for nothing  
Under his nose was a dream come true  
Been there all the time and he almost knew  
And the fear goes on shadows  
And the tear flows on for nothing    
Under his nose was a dream come true   
Thoughts of people in misfortune stopped him doing things well  
  
His duty was to use it  left his pearl in the shell  
And the fear goes on shadows  
And the tear flows on for nothing    
And the fear goes on shadows  
And the tear flows on for nothing
