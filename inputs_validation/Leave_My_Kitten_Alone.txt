You better leave my kitten all alone  
You better leave my kitten all alone  
But I told you big fat bulldog  
You better leave her alone  
  
You better leave my kitten all alone  
You better leave my kitten all alone  
This dog is gonna get you  
If you dont leave her alone  
  
Well MrDog Im gonna hit you  
On the top of your head  
That child is gonna miss you  
You gonna wish that you were dead  
If you dont leave my kitten all alone  
Well I told you big fat bulldog  
You better leave her alone  
  
Well MrDog Im gonna hit you  
On the top of your head  
That girl is gonna miss you  
You gonna wish that you were dead  
If you dont leave my kitten all alone oh yeah  
Well I told you big fat bulldog  
You better leave her alone
