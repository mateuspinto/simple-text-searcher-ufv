In a sparkling moment  
I loved you you loved me  
Oh how sweet fate can he  
In that happy moment  
I forgot all my past  
Now I realize the way  
The spell was cast  
At last  
Refrain  
Once we walked alone  
Down by the river   
All the world our own  
Down by the river  
Maybe the river made our love song start  
Full was the river yet more full my heart  
So I love you two  
You and the river   
Ill he there for you  
I and the river  
You will remember when you hear my song  
Down when the river rolls along
