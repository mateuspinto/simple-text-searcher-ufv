There was a man came to see the USA from a foreign land  
To photograph the progress of dear old Uncle Sam  
He got off the boat in New York went down to the Bowery  
I know what the man went to photograph and to see  
  
There were hopeless hungry living dead  
Winos who sell their souls for a bottle of a cheapest red  
Thats the picture that he wanted  
And thats what he got they say America the ugly today  
  
He went to the Appalachians and he saw what we all have seen  
Where people live on bread and soup fat back and pinto beans  
He saw the hungry children and he photographed the ragged clothes  
I guess were gonna try to tell him that it aint so  
  
There were good men standin around with nothing to do  
Pregnant young women who didnt even have a pair of shoes  
The man got his pictures and what are we going to say America the ugly today  
  
Then he went to the medicare centers and he saw the old people there  
It seems that the young generation just didnt want em in their hair  
He saw the poor man workin it out while the mighty rich lives high  
And my friend that brings a gleam to the enemys eyes  
  
There were some folks had plenty and some had none at all  
The enemy knows when a heart gets hard the country is bound to fall  
If we get heads and hearts together we wont have to hear them say  
America the ugly today America the ugly today
