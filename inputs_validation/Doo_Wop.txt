Incomprehensible  
Fell real good wavin your hands in the air  
Admit two shots in the atmosphere  
Put em up put em up  
  
First Verse  
  
Its been three weeks since you were looking for your friend  
The one you let hit it and never called you again  
Remember when he told you he was about the Benjamins  
You act like you aint here him but gave him a little trim  
To begin how you think youre really going to pretend  
Like you wasnt down and you called him again  
Plus when you give it up so easy you aint even foolin him  
If you did it then then youd probably do it again  
Talking out your neck saying youre a Christian  
A Muslim sleeping with the GenGentile  
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in  
Whore you going to tell when the repercussions spin  
Showing off your ass cause your thinking its a trend  
Girlfriend let me break it down for you again  
You know I only say it cause Im truly genuine  
Dont be a hard rock when you really are a gem  
Baby girl respect is just the minimum  
Niggas creepin and you still defending him  
Now Lauryn is only human  
Dont think I havent been through the same predicament  
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly been  
Its silly when girls sell their souls because its in  
Look at what you be in hair weaves like Europeans  
Fake nails up out Koreans  
  
Hook  
Come again  
Yo when when come again  
When when come again  
My friend come again  
  
Chorus  
Guys you know youd better watch out  
Some girls some girls are only about  
That thing that thing that thing  
That thing that thing that thing  
  
Second Verse  
The second verse is dedicated to the men  
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs Timberlands than his women  
Him and his men come in the club like hooligans  
Dont care who they offend poppin yang like you got yen  
Lets stop pretend the wanna pack pistol by they waist men  
Cristal by the case men still living in his Mothers basement  
The pretty face men claiming that they be the big men  
Need to take care of their three and four kids  
But they face a court case when the child supports late  
Money taking and heart breaking now you wonder why women hate men  
The sneaky silent men the punk domestic violence men  
Quick to shoot the semen stop acting like boys and be men  
How you gonna win when you aint right within  
How you gonna win when you aint right within  
How you gonna win when you aint right within  
Hook  
Come again  
Yo yo come again  
Brostraight come again  
Sit straight come again

That thing that thing that thing  
That thing that thing that thing
