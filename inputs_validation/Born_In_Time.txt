In the lonely night  
In the blinking stardust of a pale blue light  
Youre comin through to me in black and white  
When we were made of dreams  
Youre blowing down the shaky street  
Youre hearing my heart beat  
In the record breaking heat  
Where we were born in time  
Not one more night not one more kiss  
Not this time baby no more of this  
Takes too much skill takes too much will  
Its revealing  
You came you saw just like the law  
You married young just like your ma  
You tried and tried you made me slide  
You left me reelin with this feelin  
On the rising curve  
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve  
You wont get anything you dont deserve  
Where we were born in time  
You pressed me once you pressed me twice  
You hang the flame youll pay the price  
Oh babe that fire  
Is still smokin  
You were snow you were rain  
You were striped you were plain  
Oh babe truer words  
Have not been spoken or broken  
In the hills of mystery  
In the foggy web of destiny  
You can have whats left of me  
Where we were born in time
