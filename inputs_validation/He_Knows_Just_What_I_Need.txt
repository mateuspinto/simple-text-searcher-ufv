My Jesus knows when I am Lonely  
He knows each pain He sees each care  
He understands each lonely heartache  
He understands because He cares  
My Jesus knows just what I need  
Oh yes He knows just what I need  
He satisfies and every need supplies  
Yes He knows just what I need  
My Jesus knows just what I need  
Oh yes He knows just what I need  
He satisfies and every need supplies  
Yes He knows just what I need
