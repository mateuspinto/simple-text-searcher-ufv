I had a dream  
I had a dream  
I saw the mission band playing on the green  
It was the saddest thing I have ever seen  
What did it mean what did it all mean  
  
And in my dream in my same dream  
I saw the soldiers marching on the green  
The band played a funeral march  
Many a tear was seen  
All in my dream all in my dream  
  
Lead  
  
I heard the lesson read I heard the choir  
I saw the falling leaves landing everywhere  
I saw the family gathered crying in despair  
I was not there I was not there
