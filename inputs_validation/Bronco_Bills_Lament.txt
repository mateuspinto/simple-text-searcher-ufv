I coulda been most anything I put my mind to be  
But a cowboys life was the only life for me  
Its a strong mans occupation ridin herd and livin free  
But strong men often fail  
Where shrewd men can prevail  
Im an old man now with nothin left to say  
But oh god how I worked my youth away  
  
Well you may not recognize my face I used to be a star  
A cowboy hero known both near and far  
I perched upon a silver mount and sang with my guitar  
But the studio of course  
owned my saddle and my horse  
But that sixgun on the wall belongs to me  
Oh god I cant live a memory  
  
You know Id like to put my finger on that trigger once again  
And point that gun at all the prideful men  
All the voyeurs and the lawyers who can pull a fountain pen  
And put you where they choose  
With the language that they use  
And enslave you till you work your youth away  
Oh god how I worked my youth away  
  
Whoopee ty yioh  
Whoopee ty yi ay  
One mans work is another mans play  
Oh God how I worked my youth away  
  
You see I always liked the notion of a cowboy fighting crime  
This photograph was taken in my prime  
I could beat those desperados but theres no sense fightin time  
But the singin was a ball  
Cause Im not musical at all  
I moved my lips to someone elses voice  
  
I coulda been most anything I put my mind to be  
But a cowboys life was the only life for me  
Its a strong mans occupation ridin herd and livin free  
But strong men often fail  
Where shrewd men can prevail  
Im an old man now with nothin left to say  
But oh god how I worked my youth away
