After a while we took in the clothes  
Nobody said very much  
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants  
Which nobody really wanted to touch  
Mama come in and picked up a book  
An Papa asked her what it was  
Someone else asked What do you care  
Papa said Well just because  
Then they started to take back their clothes  
Hang em on the line  
It was January the thirtieth  
And everybody was feelin fine  
  
The next day everybody got up  
Seein if the clothes were dry  
The dogs were barking a neighbor passed  
Mama of course she said Hi  
Have you heard the news he said with a grin  
The VicePresidents gone mad  
Where Downtown When Last night  
Hmm say thats too bad  
Well theres nothin we can do about it said the neighbor  
Its just somethin were gonna have to forget  
Yes I guess so said Ma  
Then she asked me if the clothes was still wet  
  
I reached up touched my shirt  
And the neighbor said Are those clothes yours  
I said Some of em not all of em  
He said Ya always help out around here with the chores  
I said Sometime not all the time  
Then my neighbor he blew his nose  
Just as papa yelled outside  
Mama wants you t come back in the house and bring them clothes  
Well I just do what Im told  
So I did it of course  
I went back in the house and Mama met me  
And then I shut all the doors
