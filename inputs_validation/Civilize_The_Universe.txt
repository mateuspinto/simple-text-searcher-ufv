Found exploding and tears are growing  
Chasing rockets and grasping my head  
They can call it justice a retribution  
But the reasons are never clear  
  
Freedom is just mans invention  
And a soldier is just a slave  
Self inflicted  
So addicted  
Our habits are hard to break  
  
Chorus  
Im alive  
Watching better turn to worse  
Watching better turn to worse  
One more time  
Try to civilize the universe  
Civilize the universe  
  
Without the righteous  
Without the faithful  
We would never accept the obscene  
  
A false confession and priests obsession  
Is the demon the light to be seen  
Burn the witch and hang his head as  
Theres only one choice to be made  
With thought restricted  
And heart afflicted  
The truth be so hard to take  
  
Chorus  
  
The righteous and the faithful  
Give the good man to the blind  
The world full of confusion  
From every disease confined  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Try to civilize the universe  
Civilize the universe
