Me debunk an American myth  
And take my life in my hands  
Where the great plains begin  
At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian  
Where the great plains begin  
  
Driving down a corduroy road  
Weeds standing shoulder high  
Ferris wheel is rusting off in the distance  
At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian  
Where the great plains begin  
  
Left alone to get gigantic  
Hard huge and haunted  
A generation so much dumber than its parents came  
Crashing through the window  
A raven strains along the line of the road  
Carrying a muddy old skull  
The wires whistle their approval  
Off down the distance  
At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian  
Where the great plains begin  
  
At the hundredth meridian At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian  
Where the great plains begin  
  
I remember I remember Buffalo  
And I remember Angelo  
It would seem to me I remember every  
Single fucking thing I know  
  
If I die of vanity promise me promise me  
They bury me some place I dont want to be  
Youll dig me up and transport me unceremoniously  
Away from the swollen citybreeze garbage bag trees  
Whispers of disease and the acts of enormity  
And lower me slowly sadly and properly  
Get Ry Cooder to sing my eulogy  
At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian  
Where the great plains begin  
  
At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian  
At the hundredth meridian  
Where the great plains begin
