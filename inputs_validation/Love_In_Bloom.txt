Blue night and you alone with me  
My heart has never known such ecstasy  
Am I on earth am I in heaven  
  
Can it be the trees that fill the breeze with rare and magic perfume  
Oh no it isnt the trees its love in bloom  
Can it be the spring that seems to bring the stars right into this room  
Oh no it isnt the spring its love in bloom  
  
My heart was a desert  
You planted a seed  
And this is the flower  
This hour of sweet fulfillment  
  
Is it all a dream the joy supreme that came to us in the gloom  
You know it isnt a dream its love in bloom  
  
My heart was a desert  
But you planted a seed  
And this is the flower  
This hour of sweet fulfillment  
  
Is it all a dream the joy supreme that came to us in the gloom  
You know it isnt a dream its love in bloom
