Tommy sends you flowers  
Lots of pretty things  
Johnny buys you ribbons for your hair  
They all send you presents  
And because I know  
You tell me that I dont really care  
But I care enough to give the very best  
  
Id like to buy you things like all the rest  
I know how much these little things can mean  
But all that I can give you are my dreams  
  
Billy takes you driving in his brand new car  
Frankie takes you to the movie show  
If you think I dont care  
That they love you more  
Look into my eyes and you will know  
That I care enough to give the very best  
  
Id like to buy you things like all the rest  
So darling please believe the things I say  
So let me love you in my special way  
Because I care enough to give the very best  
Because I care enough to give the very best
