Ooh hoohoo ooh hoohoo  
You said I could call on you  
If I was ever lonely  
You swore youd always be my friend  
And now my heart is tired  
And oh my soul is hungry  
I need to talk to you again  
  
Ooh hoohoo ooh hoohoo ooh  
I can hear love callin in the wind  
Ooh hoohoo oooh hoohoo  
Open up my heart and let it in  
Loves callin in the wind  
You said I may not see you  
Standing there beside me  
  
But you would be there just the same  
Your hand upon my shoulder  
Always there to guide me  
All I had to do was call your name  
Ooh hoohoo ooh hoohoo ooh  
I can hear love callin in the wind  
Ooh hoohoo ooh hoohoo  
  
Open up my heart and let it in  
Loves callin in the wind  
If I ever need to talk to you  
If I ever need to talk to you  
If I ever need to talk to you again  
If I need to get a message through  
All I ever really have to do  
All I ever have to do is call your name  
I can hear love callin in the wind  
  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Open up your heart and let it in  
Loves callin in the wind  
Ooh hoohoo ooh hoohoo
