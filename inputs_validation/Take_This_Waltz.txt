Now in Vienna there are ten pretty women  
Theres a shoulder where Death comes to cry  
Theres a lobby with nine hundred windows  
Theres a tree where the doves go to die  
Theres a piece that was torn from the morning  
And it hangs in the Gallery of Frost  
  
Take this waltz take this waltz  
Take this waltz with the clamp on its jaws  
I want you I want you I want you  
On a chair with a dead magazine  
In the cave at the tip of the lilly  
In some hallway where loves never been  
On a bed where the moon has been sweating  
In a cry filled with footsteps and sand  
  
Take this waltz take this waltz  
Take its broken waist in your hand  
  
This waltz this waltz this waltz this waltz  
With its very own breath of brandy and Death  
Dragging its tail in the sea  
  
Theres a concert hall in Vienna  
Where your mouth had a thousand reviews  
Theres a bar where the boys have stopped talking  
Theyve been sentenced to death by the blues  
Ah but who is it climbs to your picture  
With a garland of freshly cut tears  
  
Take this waltz take this waltz  
Take this waltz its been dying for years  
  
Theres an attic where children are playing  
Where Ive got to lie down with you soon  
In a dream of Hungarian lanterns  
In the mist of some sweet afternoon  
And Ill see what youve chained to your sorrow  
All your sheep and your lillies of snow  
  
Take this waltz take this waltz  
With its Ill never forget you you know  
  
This waltz this waltz this waltz this waltz  
With its very own breath of brandy and Death  
Dragging its tail in the sea  
  
And Ill dance with you in Vienna  
Ill be wearing a rivers disguise  
The hyacinth wild on my shoulder  
My mouth on the dew of your thighs  
And Ill bury my soul in a scrapbook  
With the photographs there and the moss  
And Ill yield to the flood of your beauty  
My cheap violin and my cross  
And youll carry me down on your dancing  
To the pools that you lift on your wrist  
O my love o my love  
Take this waltz take this waltz  
Its yours now Its all that there is
