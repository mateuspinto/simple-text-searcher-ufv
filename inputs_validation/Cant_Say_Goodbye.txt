Chorus  
Im a man I gotta take care of my family  
Fighting these precious in my life  
I know my mind should be on shining and getting grammys  
But these streets wont say a goodbye  
  
I cant say goodbye  
To the blocks  
Goodbye  
To the hood goodbye  
To the streets to my problems  
  
I cant say goodbye  
To the hood  
Goodbye  
To the blocks  
Goodbye  
To the streets  
I cant say goodbye goodbye  
To the blocks  
Goodbye  
To the streets  
Goodbye  
To the hood  
I cant say goodbye  
To the hood  
Goodbye  
To the blocks  
Goodbye  
To the homies  
  
Verse 1  
I guess its true you cant take the hood out a homeboy  
Plus my hood just lost another homeboy  
Another one got life and we dont know if he coming home boy  
They in the street tell me just leave it alone boy  
Let them do them take care of your own boy  
But I said back brake a bound before I was grown boy  
You had dreams of being a dope boy  
Yeah I was runnin from the po po  
Banging for the turf late night huntin  
Puttin me in work good day comin airbrush shirt  
Pay day get the spot got my hair cut first  
Made mom sick when I wouldnt go to church  
Yeah I live in the burbs but I think 21st  
I know since I left that its gotten much worse  
But Id still be there if I couldnt write a verse  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 2  
To the the blocks that raise me the enemies and the homies that made me  
Tough enough to hang on the corners that would mold me  
Critics wonder if Im tryna be the old me  
But if the thing the old me ever left then they dont really know me  
And dont know we dont change we just become OG you always addicted  
To the life you just dont OD I dont owe shit to the streets before they
owe me  
Took me in when my moma didnt want me to wild to be a child and pops  
Not around now all I got now is the homies to teach me how to be a man  
In what not how to brake ounces in the grams and what not  
The reason Im so nice with my hands and what not shit you think I forgot
man  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 3  
Thank good every day that the boy could spit  
And all around the world they enjoyin my shit  
I know I got plenty more wars to get  
I got a beautiful wife and some gorgeous kids  
But it wouldnt be right if I ignore the shit  
They made me how I am the music in the man  
Told me that I can for the world gave a damn  
If it wasnt for my shit they sayin stick to the plan  
Probably be a gun instead of a pen in my hand  
Probably be doin a dub and the pen with my man  
The say leaders streets but they dont really understand  
All I had was the block when I didnt have fans  
Wrapped on the corners when I couldnt get spins  
All I had was the homies when I didnt have kids  
If it all come down and my career was to end Im sure my name  
Would live In the streets  
  
Chorus  
  
I just cant say goodbye  
  
I cant say goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
I cant say goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
I cant say goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
I cant say goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
  
You can take the man out the streets  
But you cant take the streets out the man
