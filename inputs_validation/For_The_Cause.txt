You gave Your all for me  
Came as a ransom to set me free  
Love so amazing divine  
Your blood shed on Calvary for all mankind  
  
I stand in awe  
Of the wonder of Your Love  
I stand in awe of You  
  
For the cause of Christ I will lay down my life  
  
For the cause of Christ I will stand  
I will give my all to give him glory  
For the cause of Christ I live  
  
I will worship  
Jesus my King of all glory
