I remember it well that day last spring  
When the snow lay deep on the mountain trails  
It was winters last showin and our last fling  
Before returning to our lives in the valley  
  
We pretended we were lost in the wilderness  
And I pretended to be your guide  
Our love was a play and you were the actress  
We were two lonely people living out a dream  
  
Oh baby meet me on the mountain  
When the winter is dying  
And the snow lay deep on the mountain trails  
Maybe its the spring putting thoughts in our heads  
But baby meet me on the mountain  
When the winter lays her head to rest  
  
As the morning came the feelings faded  
They melted away with the dew  
And if it hurt I never felt it  
Cause I knew that youd be leavin me soon  
  
Come on baby meet me on the mountain  
When the winter is dying  
And the snow lay deep on the mountain trails  
Maybe its the spring putting thoughts in our heads  
But baby meet me on the mountain  
When the winter lays her head to rest
