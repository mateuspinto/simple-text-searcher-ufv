The sky is painted black  
The smoke pours out the stack  
One hand upon your heart  
One hand behind your back  
You train us how to act  
You keep the fear intact  
The imminent attack  
Everything is right on track  
  
And we are letting you get away  
We are letting you get away with it  
  
Upon our plates to feed  
The dying left to bleed  
How much we really need  
Your politics of greed  
The cancer takes a hold  
The wolf is in the fold  
Our destinys been sold  
We do just what were told  
  
And we are letting you get away  
We are letting you get away with it  
  
Your armies filled with hate  
Believing your charade  
Begin to suffocate  
For us its far too late  
  
And we are letting you get away  
We are letting you get away with it
