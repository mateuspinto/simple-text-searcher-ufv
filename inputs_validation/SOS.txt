Where are those happy days  
They seem so hard to find  
I tried to reach for you  
But you have closed your mind  
Whatever happened to our love  
I wish I understood  
It used to be so nice  
Used to be so good  
  
So when youre near me  
Darling cant you hear me  
SOS  
The love you gave me  
Nothing else can save me  
SOS  
  
When youre gone  
How can I even try to go on  
When youre gone  
Though I try how can I carry on  
You seem so far away  though you are standing near  
You made me feel alive but something died I fear  
I really tried to make it out  
I wish I understood  
What happened to our love  
It used to be so good
