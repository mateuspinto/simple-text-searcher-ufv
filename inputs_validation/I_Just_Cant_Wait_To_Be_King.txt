Lyrics by tim rice  
Available on the soundtrack the lion king  
  
Way behind the water hole  
A little down the line  
The jungle and the plains and peaks  
Are scheduled to be mine  
  
Im gonna be the ruler  
Of most everything around  
From the grandest of the mountains  
To the humble common ground  
My reign will be a super awesome thing  
Oh I just cant wait to be king  
  
Im gonna be a noble king  
Unscrupulously fair  
I only need a little time  
Perhaps a little hair  
  
Im gonna be the mane event  
Like no king was before  
Im brushing up on looking down  
Im working on my roar  
The fauna and the flora gonna swing  
Oh I just cant wait to be king  
  
No one saying do this  
No one saying be there  
No one saying stop that  
No one saying see here  
Free to run around all day  
Ill be free to do it my way  
  
The time has come as someone said  
To talk of many things  
This may be true  
But I would rather stick to talking kings  
  
Its easy to be royal if youre already leonine  
It isnt just my right even my left will be divine  
The monarchy is waiting to go zing  
Oh I just cant wait to be king
