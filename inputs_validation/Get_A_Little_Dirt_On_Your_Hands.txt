When I was a little boy  
Daddy used to say to me  
Son we got a lot of land  
We got a lot of work to be done  
  
Go get your marbles put em in the house  
Tear down your castles in the sand  
Come with your poppy to the cotton patch  
Get a little dirt on your hands get a little dirt on your hands  
  
Get a little dirt on your hands son  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
If youre gonna grow up to be a big big man  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
  
Well I reached twentyone  
And I thought I was a pretty big wheel  
I left the country for the city  
Met a slicker with a shady deal  
  
He said Hold up the bank boy and take all the money  
And run as fast as you can  
The only way youll ever get along in this world  
Is to get a little dirt on your hands get a little dirt on your hands  
  
Get a little dirt on your hands son  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
If you want to grow up to be a big big man  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
  
Well its four in the morning  
And the warden is calling my name  
He said hes teaching me a lesson  
Now hes making me go work in the rain  
  
Dig that ditch boy fill it up  
Im wanting you to understand  
The only way to straighten out a guy like you  
Is to get a little dirt on his hands get a little dirt on his hands  
  
Hey David got to get a little dirt on those hands boy  
Yeah if you want to grow up to be a big big man  
You better remember what old Whispering Bill  
Told you in this song get a little dirt on those hands  
  
Get a little dirt on your hands son  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
If you want to grow up to be a big big man  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
Get a little dirt on your hands  
Get a little dirt on your hands son  
I got a little dirt on my hands  
  
Get a little dirt on your hands
