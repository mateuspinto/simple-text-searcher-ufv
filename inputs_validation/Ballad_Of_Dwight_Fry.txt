Mommy wheres daddy  
Hes been gone for so long  
Do you think hell ever come home  
  
I was gone for fourteen days  
I coulda been gone for more  
Held up in the intensive care ward  
Lyin on the floor  
I was gone for all those days  
But I was not all alone  
I made friends with a lot of people  
In the danger zone  
  
See my lonely life unfold  
I see it every day  
See my lonely mind explode  
Since Ive gone away  
  
I think I lost some weight there  
And I Im sure I need some rest  
Sleepin dont come very easy  
In a straight white vest  
Should like to see that little children  
Shes only four years old old  
Id give her back all of her play things  
Even even the ones I stole  
  
See my lonely life unfold  
I see it everyday  
See my lonely mind explode  
When Ive gone insane  
  
I want to get out of here  
I want to get out of here  
I Ive gotta Ive gotta get out of here  
I I gotta get out of here  
I I gotta get out of here  
IgottagetoutahereIgottagetoutahereIgottagetoutahere  
Ya gotta let me out of here  
Let me outta her  
Etc  
  
See my lonely life unfold  
I see it everyday  
See my lonely mind explode  
Blown up in my face  
  
I grabbed my hat and I got my coat  
And I I ran into the street  
I saw a man that was choking there  
I guess he couldnt breathe  
Said to myself this is very strange  
Im glad it wasnt me  
But now I hear those sirens callin  
And so I am not free  
I didnt want to be  
I didnt want to be  
I didnt want to be  
  
See my lonely life unfold  
I didnt want to be  
I see it every day  
Leave me alone  
I didnt want to be  
Dont touch me  
See my lonely mind explode  
When Ive gone Insane
