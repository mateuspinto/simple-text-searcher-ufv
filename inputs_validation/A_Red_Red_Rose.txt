My love is like a red red rose  
Thats newly strung in June  
My love is like a melody  
Thats sweetly played in tune  
  
As far art thou my bonnie lass  
So deep in love am I  
And I will love thee still my dear  
Til all the seas gang dry  
Til all the seas gang dry  
  
Till all the seas gang dry my dear  
And the rocks melt with the sun  
I will love thee still my dear  
While the sands of life shall run  
  
And fare thee well my only love  
And fare thee well a while  
And I will come again my love  
Though it were ten thousand miles  
Though it were ten thousand miles
