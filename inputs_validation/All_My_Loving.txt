Close your eyes and Ill kiss you  
Tomorrow Ill miss you  
Remember Ill always be true  
And then while Im away  
Ill write home every day  
And Ill send all my loving to you  
  
Ill pretend that Im kissing  
The lips I am missing  
And hope that my dreams will come true  
And then while Im away  
Ill write home every day  
And Ill send all my loving to you  
  
All my loving I will send to you  
All my loving darling Ill be true  
  
Close your eyes and Ill kiss you  
Tomorrow Ill miss you  
Remember Ill always be true  
And then while Im away  
Ill write home every day  
And Ill send all my loving to you  
  
All my loving I will send to you  
All my loving darling Ill be true  
All my loving all my loving  
Woo all my loving I will send to you
