If it hadnt been for cottoneye Joe  
Id been married long time ago  
Where did you come from Where did you go  
Where did you come from cottoneye Joe  
  
If it hadnt been for cottoneye Joe  
Id been married long time ago  
Where did you come from Where did you go  
Where did you come from cottoneye Joe  
  
He came to town like a midwinter storm  
He rode through the fields so  
Handsome and strong  
His eyes was his tools and his smile was his gun  
But all he had come for was having some fun  
  
If it hadnt been for cottoneye Joe  
Id been married long time ago  
Where did you come from Where did you go  
Where did you come from cottoneye Joe  
  
He brought disaster wherever he went  
The hearts of the girls was to hell broken sent  
They all ran away so nobody would know  
And left only men cause of cottoneye Joe  
  
If it hadnt been for cottoneye Joe  
Id been married long time ago  
Where did you come from Where did you go  
Where did you come from cottoneye Joe
