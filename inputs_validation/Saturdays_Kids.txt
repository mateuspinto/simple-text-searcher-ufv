Saturdays boys live life with insults  
Drink lots of beer and wait for half time results  
Afternoon tea in the lightabite chat up the girls they  
Dig it  
Saturdays girls work in tescos and woolworths  
Wear cheap perfume cause its all they can afford  
Go to discos they drink baby cham talk to jan in bingo  
Accents  
Saturdays kids play one arm bandits  
They never win but thats not the point is it  
Dip in silver paper when their pints go flat  
How about that far out  
  
Their mums and dads smoke capstan non filters  
Wallpaper lives cause they all die of cancer  
What goes on what goes wrong  
  
Save up their money for a holiday  
To selsey bill or bracklesham bay  
Think about the future when theyll settle down  
Marry the girl next door with one on the way  
  
These are the real creatures that time has forgot  
Not given a thought its the system  
Hate the system whats the system  
  
Saturdays kids live in council houses  
Wear vnecked shirts and baggy trousers  
Drive cortinas fur trimmed dash boards  
Stains on the seats  in the back of course
