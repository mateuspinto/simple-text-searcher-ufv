To Thomas SEiselberg a very rich man who was wise  
Enough to spend all his fortunes in burying himself  
Many miles beneath the ground as the only surviving  
Member of the human race he inherited the whole world  
  
Stagnation  
  
Here today the red sky tells his tale  
But the only listening eyes are mine  
There is peace amongst the hills  
And the night will cover all my pride  
Blest are they who smile from bodies free  
Seems to me like any other crowd  
Who are waiting to be saved  
  
Wait there is still time for washing in the pool  
Wash away the past  
Moon my longlost friend is smiling from above  
Smiling at my tears  
Come well walk the path to take us to my home  
Keep outside the night  
The icecold knife has come to decorate the dead  
Somehow  
  
And each will find a home  
And there will still be time  
For loving my friend  
You are there  
And will I wait for ever beside the silent mirror  
And fish for bitter minnows amongst the weeds  
And slimy water  
  
I want to sit down  
I want to take a drink of water  
I want a drink  
I want a drink  
To take all the dust and the dirt from my throat  
I want a drink  
I want a drink  
To wash out the filth that is deep in my guts  
I want a drink  
  
Then let us drink  
Then let us smile  
Then let us go
