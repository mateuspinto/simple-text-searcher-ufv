I was lost  
For so long  
Feels like its taken  
Half my life  
To find  
Where I belong  
  
Chorus  
Seeing you here  
Youre my nation  
This is my application  
Give me hope  
Keep me sane  
Give me  
Indefinite leave to remain  
  
All the worlds  
That I saw  
I went so far away  
And still wanted you more  
  
It may sound superficial  
But can we make it official  
Give me hope  
Keep me sane  
Give me  
Indefinite leave to remain  
  
Tell me where I stand  
What do you envision  
One way or another  
Give me your decision now  
  
Is it time  
To proceed  
Will you give me a chance  
And the status I need  
  
Chorus
