We were going to see the world  
In this land  
We placed Baptismal fonts  
And an infinite number were baptized  
And they called us Carabi  
Which means Men of Great Wisdom  
  
Where are you going  
And are you going anywhere  
Where are you going  
Send me a letter if you go at all  
  
Ahh the salvation of souls  
But wisdom we had not  
For these people had neither King nor Lord  
And bowed to no one  
And they had lived in their own liberty  
  
Where are you going  
And are you going anywhere  
Going in circles  
Going in circles anywhere  
  
I saw the new  
The inconstant shifting of fortune  
And now I write to you  
Words that have not been written  
Words from the New World  
Tracing the circles  
Moving across my eyes  
Lying on a ship  
And gazing at the western skies  
Tracing lazy circles in the sky  
  
Hey  
  
Wake Up  
Wake Up  
  
Where are you going  
And are you going anywhere  
Where are you going  
Send me a letter if you go at all  
  
Its such a delight  
To watch them dance  
Be it sacrifice or romance  
Free of all the things that we hold dear  
Is that clear Your Excellency  
  
And I guess its time to go but  
I gotta send you just a few more lines  
From the New World  
  
Tracing the circles  
Moving across my eyes  
Lying on a ship  
And gazing at the western skies  
Tracing lazy circles in the sky  
  
Tracing lazy circles in the sky  
Tracing lazy circles  
  
And the sky opened  
And we laid down our armour  
And we danced  
Naked as they  
Baptized in the rain  
Of the New World
