I know you tried your best to love me  
You smiled when your heart told you to weep  
You tried to pretend that you were happy  
But last night I heard you crying in your sleep  
  
You gave the best years of your life dear  
And each precious vow you tried to keep  
I love you so much I want you happy  
But last night I heard you crying in your sleep  
  
Your heart is yearning for an old love  
With new love its useless to compete  
It hurts me to know you are unhappy  
But last night I heard you crying in your sleep  
  
You know that you are free to go dear  
And dont mind if I start to weep  
I know I can never make you happy  
Cause last night I heard you crying in your sleep
