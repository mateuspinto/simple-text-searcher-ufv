Old man dont tell me what you did in your day  
I got problems of my own on the way  
Look you now where the locusts abound  
Pray they dont feed on your sacred ground  
  
Vibrations are burning my hands  
Slowly walking stalking through these crazy lands  
Defending the need with a silent scream  
For another time for another dream  
  
Jack boots hijacks  
Ray guns and spray guns  
We got them all for free  
Look to the stars for consolation  
It could be there lookin at me  
Send me down a simple solution  
Send me down a simple solution now  
  
No cheapo cleano is gonna wash away my blues  
I need a good friend thats gonna give me some clues  
The one on the cross he almost had it boss  
He was really spreading the news  
Ah but the destruct mutt hes back in business  
He aint about to lose  
  
Jackboots hijacks  
Ray guns and spray guns  
We got them all for free  
Look to the stars for consolation  
It could be there lookin at me  
It could be there lookin at me  
Send me down a simple solution  
Send me down a simple solution now  
  
And the pricefor life  
Is one more run on that chicken wire  
As the hero returns  
With eyes of fire  
To another man to man so damn you man  
  
Old man dont tell me what you did in your day  
I got problems of my own on the way  
So look you now where the locusts abound  
Prat they dont feed on your sacred ground
