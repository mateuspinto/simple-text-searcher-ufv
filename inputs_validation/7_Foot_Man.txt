We just wrote this song on the bus the other day so just sit back and relax  
  
Im the 7 foot man  
Ive committed no crime  
Bumping my head into doorways  
It happens all the time  
Im 7 feet tall  
And I repeat  
They dont make a ski boot that can fit my feet  
Im 7 feet tall  
And I dont play basketball  
  
Im 7 feet tall  
But Im still just a man  
So of course it hurts me a lot  
When I walk into the ceiling fan  
Small people say I wish I was him  
But its been nine years since Ive had a trim  
The barber says  
I cant reach the top of his head  
  
7 foot man  
ha haI cannot hide  
7 foot man  
I know cause Ive tried  
7 foot man  
My last girlfriend died  
Because my penis  
Is 7 foot wide  
  
So the next time you see me  
Walking around  
And my head is right about to hit a tree branch  
Tell me to duck down  
And Ill pay you back   
Soon you will see  
By getting you frisbee down from that tree  
I do what i can  
Im the 7 foot man  
  
7 foot man  
7 foot man
