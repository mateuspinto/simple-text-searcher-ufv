I was a child in the 60s  
So unsure of my direction  
I would follow where my friends and family would lead  
I was strengthened  
When I first heard the music  
Sparked by inspiration  
I was scarred by the pain  
Of constant departures  
I was wounded severely  
At an early age  
But my hopes hung high  
On the thought of the future  
I was happy to watch  
  
The time go by  
Eye to eye  
Watching the time go by  
Watching the time go by  
Day for night  
Watching the time go by  
  
And then the world changed  
There was hope in the distance  
Til it raced up around us  
And proceeded to shine  
Like the moonlight  
Full of reckless abandon  
We would reach for the stars  
Cause there was room at the top  
And food on the table  
We were doing quite well  
At such an early stage  
There was no need to stop  
Nor were we able  
And no one could see  
  
The time go by  
Eye to eye  
Watching the time go by  
Watching the time go by  
Day for night  
Watching the time go by  
  
There are moments I regret more than the rest  
There are days I cant recall at all  
Looking back now theres not much that I would change  
I am happy to watch  
  
The time go by  
Eye to eye  
Watching the time go by  
Watching the time go by  
Eye to eye  
Watching the time go by  
  
Watching the time go by  
Day for night  
Watching the time go by  
Watching the time go by  
Why oh why  
Watching the time go by
