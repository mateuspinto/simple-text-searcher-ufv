Many men have loved the bells  
You fastened to the rein  
And everyone who wanted you  
They found what they will always want again  
Your beauty lost to you yourself  
Just as it was lost to them  
  
Oh take this longing from my tongue  
Whatever useless things these hands have done  
Let me see your beauty broken down  
Like you would do for one you love  
  
Your body like a searchlight  
My poverty revealed  
I would like to try your charity  
Until you cry Now you must try my greed  
And everything depends upon  
How near you sleep to me  
  
Just take this longing from my tongue  
All the lonely things my hands have done  
Let me see your beauty broken down  
Like you would do for one your love  
  
Hungry as an archway  
Through which the troops have passed  
I stand in ruins behind you  
With your winter clothes your broken sandal straps  
I love to see you naked over there  
Especially from the back  
  
Oh take this longing from my tongue  
All the useless things my hands have done  
Untie for me your hired blue gown  
Like you would do for one that you love  
  
Youre faithful to the better man  
Im afraid that he left  
So let me judge your love affair  
In this very room where I have sentenced  
Mine to death  
Ill even wear these old laurel leaves  
That hes shaken from his head  
  
Just take this longing from my tongue  
All the useless things my hands have done  
Let me see your beauty broken down  
Like you would do for one you love  
Like you would do for one you love
