Here we stand as the forces blow  
Across the land  
Open minds and now open sores  
But no open hand  
Hiding in our trench of steel  
To witness the blast  
Nothing to say and now nothing to feel  
Now its hopeless and past  
The wind that was meant to be  
Oppenheimer built radioactivity  
Buildings and houses crops and forethought  
Have now gone to ground  
All but the dust and the helpless debris  
Are all that are found  
Now his creation is purchased by gods  
Who must reconvene  
Deciding to cleanse the Earth of its life  
By priming their own warmachine  
Skil will grow soft blood will grow cold  
But not on your frame  
He mastered the deadliest weapon of all  
But was he insane  
He built it for life  
He built it for peace  
Oh thats what he thought  
But evilness knows no boundaries  
And satan will read from his court
