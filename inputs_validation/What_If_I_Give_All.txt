What If I Give All  
Words by Ray Boltz Music by Ray Boltz and Mark Pay  
He heard the preacher say  
A single dime can feed  
A hungry boy or girl  
With nothing to eat  
So he pulled a dollar  
From the pocket of his jeans  
And he asked his mama  
How many will this feed  
She just smiled  
And when she told him ten  
He reached back again  
chorus  
What if I give all I have  
What will that gift do  
My child a gift like that  
Could change the world  
It could feed a multitude  
He didnt close his eyes  
Or turn away  
I can see him standing tall  
He saw the need  
And I can hear him say  
What if I give all  
Three birthday dollars  
Could have bought a special toy  
But he reminds me  
Of another little boy  
Who gave to Jesus  
A gift of fish and bread  
I wonder if he said  
chorus repeat  
And long ago a Father and a Son  
Saw the children lost in sin  
Can you see the tears  
In the Fathers eyes  
As Jesus says to him  
What if I gave all I have  
What will that gift do  
My Son that gift  
Will change the world  
It will free the multitudes  
What if I give all I have  
What will that gift do  
My child a gift like that  
Could change the world  
It could feed a multitude  
We cannot close our eyes  
And turn away  
When we hear His Spirit call  
We see the need  
Now let Him hear us say  
What if I give all  
What if I give all
