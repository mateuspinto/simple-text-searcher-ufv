Dont wish it away  
Dont look at it like its forever  
Between you and me I could honestly say  
That things can only get better  
  
And while Im away  
Dust out the demons inside  
And it wont be long before you and me run  
To the place in our hearts where we hide  
  
And I guess thats why they call it the blues  
Time on my hands could be time spent with you  
Laughing like children living like lovers  
Rolling like thunder under the covers  
And I guess thats why they call it the blues  
  
Just stare into space  
Picture my face in your hands  
Live for each second without hesitation  
And never forget Im your man  
  
Wait on me girl  
Cry in the night if it helps  
But more than ever I simply love you  
More than I love life itself
