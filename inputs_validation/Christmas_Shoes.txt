It was almost Christmas time  
There I stood in another line  
Tryin to buy that last gift or two  
Not really in the Christmas mood  
  
Standin right in front of me  
Was a little boy waiting anxiously  
Pacing round like little boys do  
And in his hands he held a pair of shoes  
  
And his clothes were worn and old  
He was dirty from head to toe  
And when it came his time to pay  
I couldnt believe what I heard him say  
  
Sir I wanna buy these shoes  
For my mama please  
Its Christmas eve and these shoes are just her size  
Could you hurry sir  
Daddy says theres not much time  
You see shes been sick for quite a while  
And I know these shoes will make her smile  
And I want her to look beautiful  
If mama meets Jesus tonight  
  
He counted pennies for what seemed like years  
And the cashier said Son theres not enough here  
He searched his pockets franticly  
Then he turned and he looked at me  
He said Mama made Christmas good at our house  
Most years she just did without  
Tell me sir what am I gonna do  
Somehow Ive gotta buy her these Christmas shoes  
  
So I laid the money down  
I just had to help him out  
And Ill never forget the look on his face  
When he said Mamas gonna look so great  
  
Sir I wanna buy these shoes  
For my mama please  
Its Christmas eve and these shoes are just her size  
Could you hurry sir  
Daddy says theres not much time  
You see shes been sick for quite a while  
And I know these shoes will make her smile  
And I want her to look beautiful  
If mama meets Jesus tonight  
  
I knew I caught a glimpse of heaven love  
As he thanked me and ran out  
I knew that god had sent that little boy to remind me  
What Christmas is all about  
  
Sir I wanna buy these shoes  
For my mama please  
Its Christmas eve and these shoes are just her size  
Could you hurry sir  
Daddy says theres not much time  
You see shes been sick for quite a while  
And I know these shoes will make her smile  
And I want her to look beautiful  
If mama meets Jesus tonight  
  
I want her to look beautiful  
If mama meets Jesus tonight
