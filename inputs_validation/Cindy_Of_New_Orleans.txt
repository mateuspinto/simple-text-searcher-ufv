Down by the river where the big boats go by  
Each day you could see them as evening was nigh  
They planned to be married at the first sign of spring  
And Jim would take Cindy to see New Orleans  
The town folks would smile as they sat there alone  
Jim talked of the day hed make Cindy his own  
He saved his money to buy her a ring  
And take his sweet Cindy to see New Orleans  
  
One day a riverboat gambler chanced by  
And captured her heart with his sweet words and lies  
He told her come with me and youll be a queen  
So they left together to see New Orleans  
Each day you can see Jim though years have gone by  
Down by the river where the big boats go by  
She wrote shed return at the first sign of spring  
Hes waiting for Cindy to see New Orleans
