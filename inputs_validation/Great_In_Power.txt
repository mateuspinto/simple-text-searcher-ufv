Praise Him you heavens and all thats above  
Praise Him you angels and heavenly hosts  
Let the whole earth praise Him  
  
Praise Him the sun moon and bright shining stars  
Praise Him you heavens and waters and skies  
Let the whole earth praise Him  
  
Chorus  
Great in power great in glory  
Great in mercy King of heaven  
Great in battle great in wonder  
Great in Zion King over all the earth
