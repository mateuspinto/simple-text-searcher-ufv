In the morning when you rise  
Do you open up your eyes see what I see  
Do you see the same things evry day  
Do you think of a way to start the day  
Getting things in proportion  
Spread the news and help the world go round  
Have you heard of a time that will help us get it together again  
Have you heard of the word that will stop us going wrong  
Well the time is near and the word youll hear  
When you get things in perspective  
Spread the news and help the word go round  
  
Theres a time and the time is now and its right for me  
Its right for me and the time is now  
Theres a word and the word is love and its right for me  
Its right for me and the word is love  
  
Have you heard of a time that will help get it together again  
Have you heard of the word that will stop us going wrong  
Well the time is near and the word youll hear  
When you get things in perspective  
Spread the news and help the word go round  
  
Theres a time and the time is now and its right for me  
Its right for me and the time is now  
Theres a word and the word is love and its right for me  
Its right for me and the word is love  
Theres a time and the time is now and its right for me  
Its right for me and the time is now  
Theres a word and the word is love and its right for me  
Its right for me and the word is love
