On sticks and sand lost my money lost my hands  
Blood on my brain too much salt in my veins  
  
And I thought pain was clean  
And I thought hearts were strong  
But bones arent sticks anymore  
And a day is far too long  
  
So many days never needing any grace  
Live for kicks and danger thered be beauty anyway  
  
And I thought pain was clean  
And I thought hearts were strong  
But bones arent sticks anymore  
And a day is far too long x3
