After you go I can catch on my reading  
After you go I have lot more time sleeping  
And when you go it looks like things gonna be lot easier  
Life would be at ease you know  
I really should be glad  
Chorus  
But Im bluer than blue  
Sadder than sad  
Youre the only life this empty room has ever had  
Life without you is gonna be  
Bluer than blue  
After you go I have a lot more room in my closet  
After you go I can stay out long if I feel like  
And when you go I can run through half screaming  
And no one can ever hear me  
I really should be glad  
Repeat Chorus  
I dont have to miss no tv show  
I can start my whole life over  
Change the numbers on my telephone  
But the night will sure be colder  
Repeat Chorus  
Bluer than blue  
Bluer than blue  
Bluer than blue
