I saw you walking by his side heard you whisper all those lies  
And I couldnt keep from crying  
You sang him love songs tenderly that should have been for you and me  
And I couldnt keep from crying  
I saw his eyes drinking your charms while he held you in his arms  
Him with all his wedding ways rules your heart now in my place  
I stood and watched him steal a kiss from two lips I know Ill miss  
And I couldnt keep from crying  
  
I saw his eyes drinking your charms
