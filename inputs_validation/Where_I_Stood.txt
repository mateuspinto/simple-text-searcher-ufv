I dont know what Ive done  
Or if I like what Ive begun  
But something told me to run  
And honey you know me its all or none  
  
There were sounds in my head  
Little voices whispering  
That I should go and this should end  
Oh and I found myself listening  
  
Cause I dont know who I am who I am without you  
All I know is that I should  
And I dont know if I could stand another hand upon you  
All I know is that I should  
Cause she will love you more than I could  
She who dares to stand where I stood  
  
See I thought love was black and white  
That it was wrong or it was right  
But you aint leaving without a fight  
And I think I am just as torn inside  
  
Cause I dont know who I am who I am without you  
All I know is that I should  
And I dont know if I could stand another hand upon you  
All I know is that I should  
Cause she will love you more than I could  
She who dares to stand where I stood  
  
And I wont be far from where you are if ever you should call  
You meant more to me than anyone I ever loved at all  
But you taught me how to trust myself and so I say to you  
This is what I have to do  
  
Cause I dont know who I am who I am without you  
All I know is that I should  
And I dont know if I could stand another hand upon you  
All I know is that I should  
Cause she will love you more than I could  
She who dares to stand where I stood  
Oh she who dares to stand where I stood
