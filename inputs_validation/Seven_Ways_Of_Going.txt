Ive got seven ways of going seven wheres to be  
Seven sweet disguises seven ways of serving Thee  
Lord I do extol Thee for Thou has lifted me  
Woke me up and shook me out of mine iniquity  
Oh I was undulating in the lewd impostered night  
Steeped in a dream to rend the seams to redeem the rock of right  
  
Swept through the seas of Galilee and the Seven Hills of Rome  
Seven sins were wrung from the sight of me  
Lo I turned my neck toward home  
Ah I opened up my arms to You and we spun from life to life  
Til you loosened me and let me go toward the everlasting light  
  
In this big step I am taking seven seizures for the true  
I got seven ways of going seven ways of serving You  
  
As I move through seven levels  
As I move upon the slate  
As I declare to you  
The number of my moves  
As I speculate the eighth  
Seeking love without exception  
A light upon the swarm  
Seeking love without exception  
A saint in any form
