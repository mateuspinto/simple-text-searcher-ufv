To dream the impossible dream  
To fight the unbeatable foe  
To bear with unbearable sorrow  
To run where the brave dare not go  
  
To right the unrightable wrong  
To love pure and chaste from afar  
To try when your arms are too weary  
To reach the unreachable star  
  
This is my quest to follow that star  
No matter how hopeless no matter how far  
To fight for the right  
Without question or pause  
To be willing to march  
Into hell for a heavenly cause  
  
And I know if Ill only be true  
To this glorious quest  
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm  
When Im laid to my rest  
  
And the world will be better for this  
That one man scorned and covered with scars  
Still strove with his last ounce of courage  
To reach the unreachable star  
To fight the unbeatable foe  
To dream the impossible dream  
  
And the world will be better for this  
That one man scorned and covered with scars  
Still strove with his last ounce of courage  
To reach the unreachable star  
To fight the unbeatable foe  
To dream the impossible dream
