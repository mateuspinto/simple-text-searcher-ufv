Strum me hard strum me fast  
Fears sure built into every wall  
Looking hard through the glass  
Fears sure built in with every waltz  
  
Looking out at the rain  
Looking in through the storm  
Treading the waves  
Come in from harm  
How could you regret your other words  
Hoping for thrills oh free as a bird  
  
Strum me hard strum me fast  
Fears sure built into every wall  
Looking hard through the glass  
Fears sure built in with every waltz  
  
Theres a knock at the door  
I get up oh let you in  
Travelled and stained  
Soaked to the skin  
Welcome my darling you got here at last  
Come and sit by the fire oh forget whats past  
  
So sad so sad  
So sad so sad  
  
Strum me hard strum me fast  
Fears sure built into every wall  
Looking hard through the glass  
Fears sure built in with every waltz  
  
Looking out at the rain  
Looking in through the storm  
Looking back looking forward  
Flying up flying down oh  
What have you found  
  
So sad so sad  
What have you found  
So sad so sad  
What have you found  
So sad so sad  
What have you found  
So sad so sad
