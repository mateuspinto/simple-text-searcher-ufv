In my Blakean year I was so disposed  
Toward a mission yet unclear Advancing pole by pole  
  
Fortune breathed into my ear Mouthed a simple ode  
One road is paved in gold One road is just a road  
  
In my Blakean year Such a woeful schism  
The pain of our existence Was not as I envisioned  
  
Boots that trudged from track to track Worn down to the sole  
One road is paved in gold One road is just a road  
  
Boots that tramped from track to track Worn down to the sole  
One road was paved in gold One road was just a road  
  
In my Blakean year Temptation but a hiss  
Just a shallow spear Robed in cowardice  
  
Brace yourself for bitter flack For a life sublime  
A labyrinth of riches Never shall unwind  
The threads that bind the pilgrims sack Are stitched into the Blakean back  
  
So throw off your stupid cloak Embrace all that you fear  
For joy shall conquer all despair In my Blakean year  
  
So throw off your stupid cloak Embrace all that you fear  
For joy shall conquer all despair In my Blakean year
