And I know how it should be  
There is nothing more for you and I  
Some are young and some are free  
But I think Im goin blind  
Cause I think Im goin blind  
And I know how its to be yeah  
Little lady cant you see  
Youre so young and so much different than I  
Im ninety three youre sixteen  
Cant you see Im goin blind  
Cause I think Im goin blind  
And I know how its to be yeah  
Cause I think Im goin blind  
And I know how its to be yeah  
Youre much younger cant you see  
There is nothing more for you and I  
Im ninety three youre sixteen  
And I think Im goin blind  
Yes I think Im goin blind  
And I know how its to be yeah
