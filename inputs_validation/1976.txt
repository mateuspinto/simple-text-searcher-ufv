Hey   
  
Ohhhh   
  
Oh happy birthday america  
Lord knows you aint no sweet sixteen  
But we love you cause youre beautiful america  
We still believe in the american dream  
  
We better all keep remembering this land now  
This land full of people been gettin their kicks lord lord  
I think we all better pick up the sticks  
In 1976  
  
God put man on this planet  
But man forgot that he was heaven sent  
Man takes the planet for granted  
I thought american people would a had more sense  
  
We better keep all remembering this land now  
This land full of people bent on gettin their kicks lord lord  
I think we all better pick up the sticks  
In 1976
