Every chance every chance that I take  
I take it on the road  
Those kilometers and the red lights  
I was always looking left and right  
Oh but Im always crashing in the same car  
  
Jasmine I saw you peeping  
As I pushed my foot down to the floor  
I was going round and round the hotel garage  
Must have been touching close to 94  
Oh but Im always crashing in the same car  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
