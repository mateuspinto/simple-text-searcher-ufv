Healthfood fagot with a bartered bride  
Likes to comb his hair with a dipper ride  
Once had a friend with a cloven foot  
Once he called the tune in a checkered quit  
  
Great Deceiver  
  
In the door on the floor in a paper bag  
Theres a shoeshine boy with a ginshop slag  
She raised him up and she called him son  
And she canonized the ground that he walked upon

In the night hes a star in the Milky Way  
Hes a man of the world by the light of day  
A golden smile and a proposition  
And the breath of God smells of sweet sedition  
  
Great Deceiver  
  
Sing hymns make love get high fall dead  
Hell bring his perfume to your bed  
Hell charm your life til the cold winds blow  
Then hell sell your dreams to a picture show
