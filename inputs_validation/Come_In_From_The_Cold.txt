Back in 1957  
We had to dance a foot apart  
And they hawkeyed us from the sidelines  
Holding their rulers without a heart  
And so with just a touch of our fingers  
I could make our circuitry explode  
All we ever wanted  
Was just to come in from the cold  
  
Come in  
Come in from the cold  
we were so young  
Oh come in  
Come in from the cold  
  
We really thought we had a purpose  
We were so anxious to achieve  
We had hope  
The world held promise  
For a slave to liberty  
Freely I slaved away for something better  
And I was bought and sold  
And all I ever wanted  
Was just to come in from the cold  
  
Come in  
Come in from the cold  
we were so sure  
Oh come in  
Come in from the cold  
  
I feel your leg under the table  
Leaning into mine  
I feel renewed  
I feel disabled  
By these bonfires in my spine  
I dont know who the arsonist was  
Which incendiary soul  
But all I ever wanted  
Was just to come in from the cold  
  
Come in  
Come in from the cold  
you were so warm  
Oh come in  
Come in from the cold  
  
I am not some stone commission  
Like a statue in a park  
I am flesh and blood and vision  
I am howling in the dark  
Long blue shadows of the jackals  
Are falling on a pay phone by the road  
Oh all they ever wanted  
Was just to come in from the cold  
  
Come in  
Come in from the cold  
I was so low  
Oh come in  
Come in from the cold  
  
Is this just vulgar electricity  
Is this the edifying fire  
it was so pure  
Does your smiles covert complicity  
Debase as it admires  
just a flu with a temperature  
Are you just checking out your mojo  
oh oh  
Or am I just fighting off growing old  
just a high fever  
All I ever wanted  
Was just to come in from the cold  
  
Come in  
Come in from the cold  
it was so pure  
Oh come in  
Come in from the cold  
  
I know we never will be perfect  
Never entirely clear  
when the moon shines  
We get hurt and we just panic  
And we strike out  
Out of fear  
you were only being kind  
I fear the sentence of this solitude  
200 years on hold  
for my loving crime  
Oh and all we ever wanted  
Was just to come in from the cold  
  
Come in  
Come in from the cold  
when the moon shines  
Oh come in  
Come in from the cold  
  
When I thought life had some purpose  
Then I thought I had some choice  
I was running blind  
And I made some value judgments  
In a selfimportant voice  
I was outa line  
But then absurdity came over me  
And I longed to lose control  
into no mind  
Oh all I ever wanted  
Was just to come in from the cold  
  
Come in  
Come in from the cold  
you were so kind  
Please come in  
so kind  
Come in from the cold  
Come in come in  
Come in from the cold etc
