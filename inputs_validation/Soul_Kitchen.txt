Well the clock says its time to close now  
I guess Id better go now  
Id really like to stay here all night  
The cars crawl past all stuffed with eyes  
Street lights share their hollow glow  
Your brain seems bruised with numb surprise  
Still one place to go  
Still one place to go  
Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen  
Warm my mind near your gentle stove  
Turn me out and Ill wander baby  
Stumblin in the neon groves  
Well your fingers weave quick minarets  
Speak in secret alphabets I light another cigarette  
Learn to forget learn to forget  
Learn to forget learn to forget  
Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen  
Warm my mind near your gentle stove  
Turn me out and Ill wander baby  
Stumblin in the neon groves  
Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen  
Warm my mind near your gentle stove  
Turn me out and Ill wander baby  
Stumblin in the neon groves  
Well your fingers weave quick minarets  
Speak in secret alphabets I light another cigarette  
Learn to forget learn to forget  
Learn to forget learn to forget  
Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen  
Warm my mind near your gentle stove  
Turn me out and Ill wander baby  
Stumblin in the neon groves
