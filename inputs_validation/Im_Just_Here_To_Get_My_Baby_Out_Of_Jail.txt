Im not in your town to stay said a lady old and gray  
To the warden of the penitentiary  
Im not in your town to stay and Ill soon be on my way  
Im just here to get my baby out of jail  
Yes warden Im just here to get my baby out of jail  
  
Ive tried to raiser my baby right I have prayed both day and night  
That hed never follow the footsteps of his dad  
I have searched both far and wide I had feared that he had died  
And at last I find my baby here in jail  
Yes warden but its good to find my baby here in jail  
  
I will pawn you my watch I will pawn you my chain  
I will pawn you my gold diamond ring  
I will wash all your clothes I will scrub all your floors  
If that will get my baby out of jail  
Yes warden you know I want my baby out of jail  
  
Then I heard the warden say to the lady old and gray  
I will send your baby boy to your side  
Those wide gates swung wide apart she held her darling to her heart  
She kissed her darling boy and then she died  
But smiling in the arms of her boy there she died
