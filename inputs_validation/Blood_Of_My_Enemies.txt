Three sons have I and they  
Ride by my side The fierce  
The black and the wicked are  
Their names we ride down my  
Enemies on their halfhearted flight  
No voice of mercy no evangels of light  
  
Mighty messengers heathens rage  
Witness our coming gods of the dead  
I ride through the air  
I laugh as I die with powers of evil  
Dark knowledge is mine  
The ride of the wicked  
The 1st sin was trust  
Kill without warning for blood now  
I lust  
  
Strong winds magic mist  
To Asgard the Valkries fly  
High overhead they carry the dead  
Where the blood of my enemy lies  
  
Three sons have I and they  
Ride by my side The fierce  
The black and the wicked are  
Their names we ride down my  
Enemies on their halfhearted flight  
No voice of mercy no angels of light  
  
Strong winds magic mist  
To Asgard the Valkries fly  
High overhead they carry the dead  
Where the blood of my enemy lies
