Beating  
Heart still beating for the cause  
Feeding  
Soul still feeding on the loss  
Aching  
Limbs are aching from the rush  
Fading  
You are fading from my sight  
  
Break of morning coldness lingers on  
Shroud me into nightmares of the sun  
  
Moving  
I am moving closer to your side  
Luring  
You are luring me into the night  
Crying  
Who is crying for you here  
Dying  
I am dying fast inside your tears  
  
Plunging towards bereavement faster yet  
Clearing thoughts my mind is set  
  
Devious movements in your eyes  
Moved me from relief  
Breath comes out white clouds with your lies  
And filters through me  
  
Youre close to the final word  
Youre staring right past me in dismay  
A liquid seeps from your chest  
And drains me away  
  
Mist ripples round your thin white neck  
And draws me a line  
Cold fingers mark this dying wreck  
This moment is mine  
  
Help me cure you  
Atone for all youve done  
Help me leave you  
As all the days are done  
  
Night falls again  
Taking whats left of me  
  
Slight twist shivering corpse  
Ornated with water fills the cracks  
Clasped in my limbs by tradition  
This is all you need
