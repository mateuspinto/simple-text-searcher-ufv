She came to me one morning one lonely Sunday morning  
Her long hair flowing in the midwinter wind  
I know not how she found me for in darkness I was walking  
And destruction lay around me from a fight I could not win  
  
She asked me name my foe then I said the need within some men  
To fight and kill their brothers without thought of love or god  
And I begged her give me horses to trample down my enemies  
So eager was my passion to devour this waste of life  
  
But she would not think of battle that reduces men to animals  
So easy to begin and yet impossible to end  
For she the mother of all men had counseled me so wisely that  
I feared to walk alone again and asked if she would stay  
  
Oh lady lend your hand I cried Oh let me rest here at your side  
Have faith and trust in me she said and filled my heart with life  
There is no strength in numbers Ive no such misconceptions  
But when you need me be assured I wont be far away  
  
Thus having spoke she turned away and though I found no words to say  
I stood and watched until I saw her black cloak disappear  
My labor is no easier but now I know Im not alone  
I find new heart each time I think upon that windy day  
And if one day she comes to you drink deeply from her words so wise  
Take courage from her as your prize and say hello for me
