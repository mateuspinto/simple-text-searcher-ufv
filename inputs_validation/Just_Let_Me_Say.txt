Just let me say how much I love You  
Let me speak of Your mercy and grace  
Just let me live in a shadow of Your beauty  
Let me see You face to face  
  
And the earth will shake as Your Word goes forth  
And the heavens will tremble and fall  
But let me say how much I love You  
Oh my Savior my Lord and Friend  
  
Just let me hear Your finest whispers  
As You gently call my name  
And let me see Your power and Your glory  
Let me feel Your spirits flame  
  
Let me find You in the desert  
Till this sand is holy ground  
And I am found completely surrendered  
To You my Lord and Friend  
  
So let me say how much I love You  
With all my heart I long for You  
For I am caught in this passion of knowing  
This endless love Ive found in You  
  
And the depth of grace the forgiveness found  
To be called a child of God  
Just makes me say how much I love You  
Oh my Savior my Lord and Friend x2  
  
Just makes me say how much I love You  
Oh my Savior my Lord and Friend
