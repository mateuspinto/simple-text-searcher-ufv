Come sweetly  
Stop me through the shadow of an open door  
Breathe quietly now  
Take us through the helplessness of it all  
  
And I wonder as I watch you slip away somehow  
Wonder if the only thing thats left is now  
Wonder if I ever will I ever love again  
Will I ever love again  
  
Oh lie to me  
Lie to me tell me Im not wasting time  
Oh convince me you miss me  
Your heart still beats as fast as mine  
Tell me lies  
  
We loved it  
Loved it even more than we know  
We lost it  
And I dont even know what to do  
Tell me what to do  
  
Cause I wonder why it had to slip away somehow  
I wonder if you ever wanna see me now  
I wonder if Ill ever be the same  
Will I ever love again  
Will I ever love again  
  
Oh your eyes haunt me  
Taunt me pierce straight through my heart again  
Will it ever end  
Cause I wonder as I watch you slip away somehow  
I wonder if you ever wanna see me now  
Wonder if I ever will I ever love again  
Will I ever love again  
  
We loved it we loved it  
We lost it we lost it
