See the man in the picture with the falcon on his glove  
A famous gambler they say he never knew defeat  
Lucky at cards oh he was lucky in love  
He gave his heart to the lovely Marguerite  
  
See the woman beside him whispering in his ear  
She was a famous beauty with men falling at her feet  
Her father was the richest man in the town of Belvedere  
Where the Gambler met the lovely Marguerite  
  
The day when the handsome gambling man  
Came through that town  
They met by chance at the corner of the street  
The scene was set for the tragedy  
It was love at first sight  
For the Gambler and the lovely Marguerite  
  
Their passion was a fire that could not be contained  
And when they made love oh how their hearts did beat  
And from that moment the whole world would be forever changed  
For the Gambler and the lovely Marguerite  
  
When her father heard the news he was like a man possessed  
In a cold fit of fury hatred and despair  
No good for nothin gambler was goin to steal his daughters heart  
He hired three men to put an end to the affair  
  
The Gambler had a room upstairs in a cheap hotel  
The men lay in wait in an alley off the street  
As the lovers strolled by three shots rang out and the Gambler fell  
He died in the arms of the lovely Marguerite  
  
When they brought her home she just could not be consoled  
Her mother sent out for a doctor and a priest  
But it was too late to save her body or her soul  
Shed gone to meet the Gambler  
Who was waiting for his lovely Marguerite  
  
See the man in the picture with the falcon on his glove  
And the woman beside him Queen of Hearts at her feet  
They looked so happy they must have been so much in love  
The famous Gambler and the lovely Marguerite  
  
They still talk about them in the town of Belvedere  
The old people can remember hearing gunfire in the street  
And now when the moon is full two lovers sometimes appear  
They say its the ghost of The Gambler and the lovely Marguerite  
  
They say its the ghost of The Gambler and the lovely Marguerite
