I went to Morissons grave at Pere Lachaise cemetery  
The stony flowers and the matching graffiti were guiding me  
To the steps inside of me  
  
And what would you do if I got down on my knees to you  
What would you do if I lied to your face  
Could you still hold your dreams  
Could you live with your silent face  
  
So what would you do would you walk right through me  
Would you stand in the way like the others before  
Get in the way  
Would you drink to me next Beaujolais day  
  
Tell me the truth save a prayer for me  
I would love to leave you but you would cry all night long  
Eternal romantic victory failed on Beaujolais day  
  
I heard a wheelchair whisper across a stale silent gymnasium  
Trailing an ivy league jacket like a matador  
Through the jitterbug steps of the night before  
  
Through the chalk white chill and the tear fandango  
Heading away to the inner wrangle  
Do we cry for a cell  
Do we need for a cell  
  
What would you do would you cry for me  
Could you set off could we go gently  
Blame it away  
Do you really want to head for the open door  
  
Got to crack a bottle while you dream for me  
Just an absent friend and a misery  
Laying awake do we stay right there  
Til Beaujolais day on Beaujolais day  
  
So what would you do would you lie to me  
Would you sit right back in a victory  
Would you play for me  
Could you die for me  
  
So what would you do would you walk right through me  
Heading away saying its just another victory  
This is Beaujolais day
