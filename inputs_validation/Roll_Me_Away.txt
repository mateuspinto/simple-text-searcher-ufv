Took a look down a westbound road right away I made my choice  
Headed out to my big two wheeler I was tired of my own voice  
Took a bead on the northern plains and just rolled that power on  
  
Twelve hours out of Mackinaw City stopped in a bar to have a brew  
Met a girl and we had a few drinks and I told her what Id decided to do  
She looked out the window a long long moment then she looked into my eyes  
She didnt have to say a thing I knew what she was thinkin  
  
Roll roll me away wont you roll me away tonight  
I too am lost I feel double crossed  
And Im sick of whats wrong and whats right  
We never even said a word we just walked out and got on that bike  
And we rolled  
And we rolled clean out of sight  
  
We rolled across the high plains  
Deep into the mountains  
Felt so good to me  
Finally feelin free  
Somewhere along a high road  
The air began to turn cold  
She said she missed her home  
I headed on alone  
  
Stood alone on a mountain top starin out at the Great Divide  
I could go east I could go west it was all up to me to decide  
Just then I saw a young hawk flyin and my soul began to rise  
And pretty soon  
My heart was singin  
  
Roll roll away Im gonna roll me away tonight  
Gotta keep rollin gotta keep ridin keep searchin till I find whats right  
And as the sunset faded I spoke to the faintest first starlight  
And I said next time  
Next time  
Well get it right
