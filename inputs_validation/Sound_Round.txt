Im young in my camper van  
The world feels old and new  
I fear the future man  
As I take in the view  
Dont know where to head now  
Give up Go back  
My friends are all dead now  
Or stifled in the sack  
  
Sound round  
Feel the ground  
Feel the pulse  
We have found  
  
Breathe in  
Feel the spin  
Wheres the dream  
That we were in  
  
Sound round  
Feel the ground  
Feel the pulse  
We have found
