Shes from a world  
Of popcorn and candy  
Pony rides for a dime  
Little children laughing  
  
Im from a world  
Of disappointments and confusions  
But I want her to be mine  
I started talking  
She kept on walking  
She disappeared into the crowd  
  
I lost my heart  
On the carousel  
To a circus girl  
Who left my heart in pieces  
Lost my heart  
On The carousel  
To a circus girl  
Who ran away  
  
I was the clown  
And she was the dancer  
We both knew it wouldnt work  
But we took our chances  
What I cant recall  
Is if there was a girl at all  
Or was it my imagination  
I still remember  
All of those faces  
And now all I have is memories  
  
I lost my heart  
On the carousel  
To a circus girl  
Who left my heart in pieces  
Lost my heart  
On The carousel  
To a circus girl  
Who ran away  
  
Two different people  
In love for an instant  
To see that the circus came today  
Sometimes I can hear her crying here  
And I can hear her calling me  
  
Dont you know  
I lost my heart  
On the carousel  
To a circus girl  
Who left my heart in pieces  
Lost my heart  
On The carousel  
To a circus girl  
Who ran away
