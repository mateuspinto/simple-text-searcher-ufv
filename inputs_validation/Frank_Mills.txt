I met a boy called Frank Mills  
On September 12th right here  
In front of Waverley but unfortunately  
I lost his address  
He was last seen with his friend  
A drummer he resembles George Harrison of the Beatles  
But he wears his hair tied in a small bow at the back  
I love him but it embarrasses me  
To walk down the street with him  
He lives in Brooklyn somewhere  
And wears a white crash helmet  
He has gold chains on his leather jacket  
And on the back are written the names  
Mary and Mom and Hells Angels  
I would gratefully appreciate it  
If you see him tell him  
Im in the park with my girlfriend  
And please  
Tell him Angela and I dont want the 2 dollars back  
Just him
