How warm is the love in my heart for you  
As warm as the sun in the sky of blue  
How long will it shine if you say youre mine  
Today tomorrow and forever  
  
How strong was my love from the very start  
How long will it last in my happy heart  
How much would I cry if wed ever part  
Today tomorrow and forever  
  
Cause if you werent there to share my love  
Who cares if the sky should fall  
For anyone can see how much you mean to me  
Youre my life my love my very all  
  
And as long as the tides of the ocean flow  
As long as the trees and the flowers grow  
So long oh my love will I love you so  
Today tomorrow and forever  
  
Repeat last two verses  
  
Today  
Tomorrow  
And forever
