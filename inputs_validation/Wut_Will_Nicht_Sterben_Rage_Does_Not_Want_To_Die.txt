Tell me how far you want to go  
do you want to see him on the floor  Yes  
do you want him to kneel before you  
do you want him to beg for mercy  
  
Thoughts of vengeance whipped from humility  
you dont see or hear anything  
your sick feelings  
dont give him a chance  
your rage does not want to die  
and only that keeps you alive  
  
You can you want and will never forgive  
and you condemn his life  
you drift in the insanity from  
excessive anger destruction and vengeance  
you were born to hate  
  
My rage does not want to die  
My rage does not want to die  
my rage will never die  
  
You ram your hatred like a stone  
into him Ramming stone   
you have pursued hunted and cursed him  
and he has taken his heels crawling  
  
You can you want and will never forgive  
and you condemn his life  
you drift in the insanity from  
excessive anger destruction and vengeance  
you were born to hate  
  
My rage does not want to die  
My rage does not want to die  
my rage will never die  
  
You can you want and will never forgive  
and you condemn his life  
you drift in the insanity from  
excessive anger destruction and vengeance  
you were born to hate  
  
My rage does not want to die  
My rage does not want to die  
my rage will never die  
  
Tills parts are in
