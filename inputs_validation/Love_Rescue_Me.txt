Love rescue me  
Come forth and speak to me  
Raise me up and dont let me fall  
No man is my enemy  
My own hands imprison me  
Love rescue me  
  
Many strangers have I met  
On the road to my regret  
Many lost who seek to find themselves in me  
They ask me to reveal  
The very thoughts they would conceal  
Love rescue me  
  
And the sun in the sky  
Makes a shadow of you and I  
Stretching out as the sun sinks in the sea  
Im here without a name  
In the palace of my shame  
Said love rescue me  
  
In the cold mirror of a glass  
I see my reflection pass  
See the dark shades of what I used to be  
See the purple of her eyes  
The scarlet of my lies  
Love rescue me  
  
Yea though I walk  
In the valley of shadow  
Yea I will fear no evil  
I have cursed thy rod and staff  
They no longer comfort me  
Love rescue me  
Sha la lasha la la la  
Sha la la laha la la  
Sha la la lasha la la la  
Sha la la lasha la la  
Sha la la lasha la la la  
Sha la la  
I said love love rescue me  
  
I said love  
Climb up the mountains said love  
I said love oh my love  
On the hill of the son  
Im on the eve of a storm  
And my word you must believe in  
Oh I said love rescue me  
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah  
  
Yeah Im here without a name  
In the palace of my shame  
I said love rescue me  
  
Ive conquered my past  
The future is here at last  
I stand at the entrance  
To a new world I can see  
The ruins to the right of me  
Will soon have lost sight of me  
Love rescue me
