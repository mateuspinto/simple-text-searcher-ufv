And I made you blue  
Instead of hurting back  
You said I love you  
That very day you won my heart  
And my love for you shall never part  
  
You have such an understanding way  
And I appreciate you need what I say  
Cause a love like yours dont come knock knock knock knocking  
Knock knocking everyday  
  
Although I treated you bad from the start  
Without question you gave me your heart  
No a love like yours dont come knock knock knock knocking  
Knock knocking everyday
