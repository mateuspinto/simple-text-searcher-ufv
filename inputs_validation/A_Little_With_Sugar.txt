I remember Christmas morning  
Back in 1954  
When we moved up to Mount Savage  
As if it mattered anymore  
Mama always said  
How the air can clear her head  
  
We were colder and much higher  
Than we ever were before  
I recall her tailored jersey  
And the flowers that she wore  
Years ago I tried to tell her  
What was in my heart  
But she was part of the city  
  
Chorus  
She took a little with sugar  
She took the money from my old man  
She took a little with sugar  
She took the money from my old man  
  
All the years that she was with us  
You could count them on one hand  
I was taken with her showboat style  
But too young to understand  
She was all alone  
Ahead of her time  
She was first generation  
  
Chorus
