Cold sweat sweat it out in the land of the midnight sun  
Walk it off  sort it out figure out what youre running from  
Im all alone on the outside of town  
Its a wild night at the carnival of souls  
Theyre strong armed in neon and out of control  
Its late at night and no ones around  
Walking In The Underground  
  
Night calls and the sound marks the start of the masquerade  
Sirens flash stains the glass as you pass in the street parade  
Loose change losers are double parked  
Faces marked like cards at the bottom of the deck  
Readin the future no one expects  
They dont look up as they shuffle down  
  
Walking In The Underground  
Walking In The Underground  
Walking In The Underground  
  
Cold sweat sweat it out in the land of the midnight sun  
Walk it off  sort it out figure out what youre running from  
Nobodys children more lost than found  
Play in the shadows like beautiful dolls  
Backlit in moonlight steppin on stars  
A silent dance to an empty sound  
  
Walking In The Underground  
Walking In The Underground  
Ooh Walking In The Underground  
  
Yeah walkin Ooh Ooh Ooh  
Walk On  
Ooh Ooh  
Yeah Yeah
