Follow the footsteps  
Or travel down your own road  
Designing your fate  
Hear what your heart says  
Still you decide which way to go  
Your lifes an open gate  
Chorus  
Le bon et le mal  
These are the voices  
We nous somme liberti  
We make the choices  
  
Echoes of laughter  
Dancing in distant corridors  
With the tears of hearts undone  
Dreams we chase after  
Give us the key to any door  
We are what we become  
  
Chorus  
  
Holding and reaching  
We face the calm we face the fear  
As we learn to win and lose  
Voices are speaking  
Still we hear what we want to hear  
Our life is ours to choose  
  
Chorus
