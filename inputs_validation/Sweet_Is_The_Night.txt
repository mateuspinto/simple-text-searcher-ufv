When the day is done and theres nowhere to run  
And the people of the city have all lost and won  
In your city dress you stand and stare  
And you smoke another cigarette and comb your hair  
  
And the light that shines  
Paints a trace of sadness  
On the street I wait  
But I cant seem to get to you  
  
Well you start to sway check your Cartier  
Cause its getting late you cant afford to wait  
So you move along where its going on  
And the people of the night are playing til the dawn  
  
And the sun that shines  
Paints a trace of sadness  
In your eyes that cry  
Wishing and hoping  
Oh  
  
Chorus  
Sweet sweet is the night  
Now you are near  
Dark dark were the days  
They disappear  
Sweet sweet is the night  
Now you are near  
  
Well you did your thing and you lost your wings  
And you hurt so bad you lost everything  
And the tears that fall on the city wall  
Will fade away with the rays of morning light that shines  
Paints a smile across your pretty face  
I know  
  
Everything is alright  
Alright  
  
Chorus
