So I was an idiot  
I was a goddamn idiot  
Because I came here so violent  
Because I came around here so violent  
  
I said yes I was an idiot  
I was a goddamn idiot  
Because I made you think for it  
Because I came round here to think for it  
  
And sing it  
Its a wonderful life  
Never felt so alive  
Never felt so alive  
Its a wonderful life  
Never felt so alive  
Never felt so alive  
  
My love my love where have you been  
My love my love where did you go  
My love my love what have you seen  
My love youre such an idiot  
  
Like an idiot  
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off  
Like an idiot  
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off  
Like an idiot  
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off  
Like an idiot  
  
I was an idiot  
I fell down like a goddamn idiot  
Because I came here to bring them down  
Because I came round here to fight them down  
I said yes I felt like an idiot  
I was a goddamn idiot  
  
Sing it  
Its a wonderful life  
Never felt so alive  
Never felt so alive  
Its a wonderful life  
Never felt so alive  
Never felt so alive  
  
My love my love where have you been  
My love my love where did you go  
My love my love what have you seen  
My love youre such an idiot  
  
Like an idiot  
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off  
Like an idiot  
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off  
Like an idiot  
I run around like a chicken with its head cut off  
Like an idiot  
  
Listen now its a wonderful life  
Never felt so alive  
Its a wonderful life  
Never felt so alive  
Its a wonderful life  
  
Never felt so alive  
Never felt so alive  
Its a wonderful life  
Never felt so alive  
Never felt so alive
