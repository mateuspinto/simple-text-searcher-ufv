Dance dance only with me  
Only with me near your heart  
Dance dance cling close to me  
Never to part  
Love love love only me  
All of our days from now on  
Dance only with me  
till all our sweet music is gone  
  
Love love love only me  
All of our days from now on  
Dance only with me  
till all our sweet music is gone  
   till all our sweet music is gone  
 Dance with me only with me   
from the Broadway Production Say Darling  
Music by Julie Styne  
With lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green
