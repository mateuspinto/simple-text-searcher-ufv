Take it from me Ive had the experience  
Finding the right love aint easy to do  
Ive been looking and looking and searching around since  
Nature started teching me just what to do  
  
I can feel it bubbling up  
All this love needs somewhere to live  
Come and take a drink from my cup  
I have a heart with so much to give  
  
All the love is here so take it  
Darlin you know we can make it  
  
Chorus  
I knew the minute I saw you  
You were the one whod be  
Sharin the love  
I have the feeling inside me  
Youll be beside me  
Sharin the love  
  
I never believed in love at first sight  
Its a foolish dreamers fantasy  
But one look at you showed me the light  
And made a foolish dreamer of me  
  
I can feel it bubbling up  
All this love needs somewhere to live  
Come and take a drink from my cup  
I have a heart with so much to give  
  
All the love is here so take it  
It would be a sin to waste it  
  
Chorus
