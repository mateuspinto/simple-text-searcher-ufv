Pain from pearls hey little girl  
How much have you grown  
Pain from pearls hey little girl  
Flower for the ones youve known  
  
Are you on fire  
From the years  
What would you give for your  
Kid fears  
  
Secret staircase running high  
You had a hiding place  
Secret staircase running low  
But they all know now youre inside  
  
Are you on fire  
From the years  
What would you give for your  
Kid fears  
  
Skipping stones we know the price now  
Any sin will do  
How much further if you can spin  
How much further if you are smooth  
  
Are you on fire  
From the years  
What would you give for your  
Kid fears  
  
Replace the rent with the stars above  
Replace the need with love  
  
Replace the anger with the tide  
Replace the ones the ones the ones that you love  
  
Are you on fire  
From the years  
What would you give for your  
Kid fears
