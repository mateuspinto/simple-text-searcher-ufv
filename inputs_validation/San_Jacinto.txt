Thick cloud steam rising hissing stone on sweat lodge fire  
Around me buffalo robe sage in bundle rub on skin  
Outside cold air stand wait for rising sun  
Red paint eagle feathers coyote calling it has begun  
Something moving in I taste it in my mouth and in my heart  
It feels like dying slow letting go of life  
  
Medicine man lead me up though town Indian ground so far down  
Cut up land each house a pool kids wearing water wings drink in cool  
Follow dry river bed watch Scout and Guides make powwow signs  
Past Geronimos disco Sit n Bull steakhouse white men dream  
A rattle in the old mans sack look at mountain top keep climbing up  
Way above us the desert snow white wind blow  
  
I hold the line the line of strength that pulls me through the fear  
San Jacinto I hold the line  
San Jacinto the poison bite and darkness take my sight I hold the line  
And the tears roll down my swollen cheek think Im losing it getting weaker  
I hold the line I hold the line  
San Jacinto yellow eagle flies down from the sun from the sun  
  
We will walk on the land  
We will breathe of the air  
We will drink from the stream  
We will live hold the line  
Hold the line  
Hold the line
