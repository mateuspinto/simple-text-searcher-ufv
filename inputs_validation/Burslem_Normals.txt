Can you hear me  
  
In your face  
Theres nowt left  
They have defaced  
The marks you left  
Upon the wall  
  
The writing not on there at all  
Can you stand what you stood for  
Are you more normal then before  
  
Goodbye to the normals  
Goodbye to the normals  
  
In your place  
Theres just chaps  
The kids arent alright  
They know  
Theyre born today  
  
Reaching out to feel the sun  
At the time it seemed like fun  
I was there when you got done  
Lived two weeks by the surf  
We used to know what we were worth  
Before the normals fell to earth  
  
Goodbye to the normals  
Goodbye to the normals  
  
Whatever happened  
To the mean mortals crew  
The fine young casuals blew a fuse  
And all the Burslem lads  
Now that theyre all dads  
They meant so much to me  
It makes me sad  
  
In your wake  
Theres nowt left
