Im so tired of moaning  
Trying to groan away my blues  
Im so tired of moaning  
Trying to groan away my blues  
I keep weeping and crying  
Every time I think of you  
  
I would rather die of starvation  
Perish out in the desert sun  
I would rather die of starvation  
Perish out in the desert sun  
Than to think of some other man  
Holding you in his arms  
  
My heart gets so heavy  
Lord I shakes down in my bones  
My heart gets so heavy  
Lord I shakes down in my bones  
I cant hurt a murderer  
Oh Lord but Im forced to weep and moan
