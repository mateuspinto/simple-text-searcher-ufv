This is my island in the sun  
Where my people have toiled since time begun  
I may sail on many a sea  
Her shores will always be home to me  
  
Chorus  
Oh island in the sun  
Willed to me by my fathers hand  
All my days I will sing in praise  
Of your forest waters your shining sand  
  
As morning breaks the heaven on high  
I lift my heavy load to the sky  
Sun comes down with a burning glow  
Mingles my sweat with the earth below  
  
Chorus  
  
I see woman on bended knee  
Cutting cane for her family  
I see man at the waterside  
Casting nets at the surging tide  
  
Chorus  
  
I pray the day will never come  
When I cant awake to the sound of drum  
Never let me miss carnival  
With calypso songs philosophical  
  
Chorus
