I will give thanks to the lord  
With all my heart  
I will tell of all thy wonders  
I will be glad and exult in thee  
  
I will trust in you my god  
Who delivered me  
And lifted me from the gates of death  
I will be glad and exult in thee  
  
I will give thanks to the lord  
With all my heart  
I will tell of all thy wonders  
I will be glad and exult in thee  
  
I will tell of all thy wonders  
I will be glad and exult in thee
