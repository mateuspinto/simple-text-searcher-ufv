Know that something very strange  
Is happening to my brain  
Im either feeling very good  
Or else I am insane  
The seeds of doubt you planted  
Have started to grow wild  
But feel that I must yield before  
The wisdom of a child  
  
And its love you bring  
No that I cant deny  
With your wings  
I can learn to fly  
Sweet young thing  
  
People try to talk to me  
Their words are ugly sounds  
But I resist all their attempts  
To try and bring me down  
Turned on to the sunset  
Like Ive never done before  
And I listen for your footsteps  
And your know upon the door  
  
And its love you bring  
With dreams of bluer skies  
All these things  
When I seem them in your eyes  
Sweet young thing
