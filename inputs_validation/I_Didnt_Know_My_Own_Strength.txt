Lost touch with my soul  
I had no where to turn  
I had no where to go  
Lost sight of my dream  
  
Thought it would be the end of me  
I thought Id never make it through  
I had no hope to hold on to  
I thought I would break  
  
I didnt know my own strength  
And I crashed down and I tumbled  
But I did not crumble  
I got through all the pain  
  
I didnt know my own strength  
Survived my darkest hour  
My faith kept me alive  
I picked myself back up  
  
Hold my head up high  
I was not built to break  
I didnt know my own strength  
  
Found hope in my heart  
I found the light to life  
My way out the dark  
Found all that I need  
Here inside of me  
  
I thought Id never find my way  
I thought Id never lift that weight  
I thought I would break  
  
I didnt know my own strength  
And I crashed down and I tumbled  
But I did not crumble  
I got through all the pain  
  
I didnt know my own strength  
Survived my darkest hour  
My faith kept me alive  
I picked myself back up  
  
Hold my head up high  
I was not built to break  
I didnt know my own strength  
  
There were so many times I  
Wondered how Id get through the night I  
Thought took all I could take  
  
I didnt know my own strength  
And I crashed down and I tumbled  
But I did not crumble  
I got through all the pain  
  
I didnt know my own strength  
Survived my darkest hour  
My faith kept me alive  
I picked myself back up  
  
Hold my head up high  
I was not built to break  
I didnt know my own strength  
  
I was not built to break  
I got to know my own strength
