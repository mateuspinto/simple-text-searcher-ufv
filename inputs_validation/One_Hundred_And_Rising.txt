Out in the heat little child  
On the streets runnin wild  
Barely ten got a gun  
So now he thinks that hes a man  
Yes he does  
  
Teenage girl out to steal  
cause her baby is in need of a meal  
Tryin to cope as best she can  
In the high sunshine low on hope  
  
Well there it is summer in the city  
Tryin to make sense of a world gone crazy  
  
Chorus  
du do do do do du  
One hundred and risin  
du do do do do du  
So the tale is told  
du do do do do du  
One hundred and risin  
du do do do do du  
  
Old man sitting in the shade  
Wont take part in the charade  
He may be old but he aint a foo  
L he has seen how dreams are bought and sold  
  
On every corner a steady stream  
To buy a thrill a pipers dream  
While the heat takes its toll  
Its just another day on a city street  
  
You got to do the best you can to get by  
In the high sunshine  
  
Chorus x 3  
Summer madness will unfold  
Tryin to make sense of a world gone crazy  
Repeat fade
