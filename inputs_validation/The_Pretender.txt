Im going to rent myself a house  
In the shade of the freeway  
Gonna pack my lunch in the morning  
And go to work each day  
And when the evening rolls around  
Ill go on home and lay my body down  
And when the morning light comes streaming in  
Ill get up and do it again  
Amen  
Say it again  
Amen  
  
I want to know what became of the changes  
We waited for love to bring  
Were they only the fitful dreams  
Of some greater awakening  
Ive been aware of the time going by  
They say in the end its the wink of an eye  
When the morning light comes streaming in  
Youll get up and do it again  
Amen  
  
Caught between the longing for love  
And the struggle for the legal tender  
Where the sirens sing and the church bells ring  
And the junk man pounds his fender  
Where the veterans dream of the fight  
Fast asleep at the traffic light  
And the children solemnly wait  
For the ice cream vendor  
Out into the cool of the evening  
Strolls the Pretender  
He knows that all his hopes and dreams  
Begin and end there  
  
Ah the laughter of the lovers  
As they run through the night  
Leaving nothing for the others  
But to choose off and fight  
And tear at the world with all their might  
While the ships bearing their dreams  
Sail out of sight  
  
Im gonna find myself a girl  
Who can show me what laughter means  
And well fill in the missing colors  
In each others paintbynumber dreams  
And then well put our dark glasses on  
And well make love until our strength is gone  
And when the morning light comes streaming in  
Well get up and do it again  
Get it up again  
  
Im gonna be a happy idiot  
And struggle for the legal tender  
Where the ads take aim and lay their claim  
To the heart and the soul of the spender  
And believe in whatever may lie  
In those things that money can buy  
Though true love could have been a contender  
Are you there  
Say a prayer for the Pretender  
Who started out so young and strong  
Only to surrender  
  
Say a prayer for the pretender  
Are you there for the pretender  
Say a prayer for the pretender  
Are you there for the pretender  
Are you prepared for the pretender
