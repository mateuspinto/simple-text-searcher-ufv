Didnt know what I was missin  
All those nights of a huggin and a kissin  
Making love on a night in June  
Looking at the stars around the silvery moon  
  
Next day the sun was shinin  
The whole world had a silver linin  
The moonlight so alone and blue  
No more nights making love without you  
  
Last night we did our hearts command  
We went to see the preacher man  
Now I know what Ive been missin  
Too many nights without a huggin and a kissin  
  
All around town its been told  
Now you wear a band of gold  
If thats the way it was meant to be  
Before you and you for me aww  
  
Last night we did our hearts command  
We went to see the preacher man  
Now I know what Ive been missin  
Too many nights without a huggin and a kissin  
  
All around town its been told  
Now you wear a band of gold  
If thats the way it was meant to be  
Before you and you for me oh  
  
I need your huggin and kissin  
I gotta have your huggin and kissin  
  
Got to have your huggin and kissin  
Oh baby I need your huggin and kissin
