Now its come to this  
Its like were back in the Dark Ages  
From the Middle East to the Middle West  
Its a world of superstition  
  
Now its come to this  
Wideeyed armies of the faithful  
From the Middle East to the Middle West  
Pray and pass the ammunition  
  
So many people think that way  
You gotta watch what you say  
To them and them and others too  
Who dont seem to see to things the way you do  
  
We can only grow the way the wind blows  
On a bare and weathered shore  
We can only bow to the here and now  
In our elemental war  
  
We can only go the way the wind blows  
We can only bow to the here and now  
Or be broken down blow by blow  
  
Now its come to this  
Hollow speeches of mass deception  
From the Middle East to the Middle West  
Like crusaders in unholy alliance  
  
Now its come to this  
Like were back in the Dark Ages  
From the Middle East to the Middle West  
Its a plague that resists our science  
  
It seems to leave them partly blind  
And they leave no child behind  
While evil spirits haunt their sleep  
While shepherds bless and count their sheep  
  
We can only grow the way the wind blows  
On a bare and weathered shore  
We can only bow to the here and now  
In our elemental war  
  
We can only grow the way the wind blows  
We can only bow to the here and now  
  
We can only grow the way the wind blows  
We can only bow to the here and now  
Or be broken down blow by blow  
We can only grow the way the wind blows  
We can only bow to the here and now  
Or be broken down blow by blow  
  
Like the solitary pine  
On a bare wind blasted shore  
We can only grow the way the wind blows  
In our elemental war  
  
We can only grow the way the wind blows  
We can only bow to the here and now  
Or be broken down blow by blow
