Girls goin swimming  
Girl in bikinis  
A walkin and wigglin by yay yay yay  
Girls on the beaches  
  
Girls oh what a peaches  
So pretty lord I could cry  
Im just a red blooded boy  
And I cant stop thinkin about  
  
Girls sailin sailboats  
Girls water skiin  
Theyll drive me out of my mind yay yay yay  
Girls big and brassy  
Girls small and sassy  
Just give me one of each kind  
  
Im just a red blooded boy  
And I cant stop thinkin about  
Girls girls girls girls  
  
And when I pick up a sandwich too much  
A crunchy crunchety  
A crunchety crunch  
I never ever get to finish my lunch  
Because theres always bound to be a bunch of  
  
Girls in tight sweaters  
Girls in short dresses  
A walkin and wigglin by yay yay yay  
Girls out boatin  
Girls just a floatin  
So pretty lord I could cry  
  
Im just a red blooded boy  
And I cant stop thinkin about  
Girls girls girls girls girls girls
