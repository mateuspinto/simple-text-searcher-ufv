If I get old  
I will not give in  
And if I do  
Remind me of this  
  
Remind me that  
Once I was free  
Once I was cool  
Once I was me  
  
And if I sit down  
And cross my arms  
Hold me to  
This song  
  
Knock me out  
Smash out my brains  
If I take a chair  
Start to talk shit  
  
If I get old  
Remind me of this  
The way that we kissed  
And I really meant it  
  
Whatever happens  
If were still speaking  
Pick up the phone  
Play me this song
