Time after time you told me it was the truth  
Time after time you lied to me through your tooth  
How can you sing when everyone writes your song  
You think you pull the strings and I get strung along  
Baa baa baa baa baa baa baa  
Baa baa baa baa baa baa  
Baa baa baa baa baa baa baa  
Baa baa baa baa baa baa  
So cry wont you cry  
You should have saved that for youth  
And does it elevate the stakes  
When you try to find the truth  
In the real world they make real deals  
And it hurts your cause and it clips your heels  
And I would not hesitate to say that I will not be here again  
In the real world  
Baa raa baa baa baa  
Its not my way to slap you in the face  
When it seems your way to spell dis with a grace  
Where are your friends theyre all moving on  
Why do you get paid when everyone writes your song  
In the real world but you make the deals  
And it hurts some more till you just cant feel  
And I would not hesitate to say that I will not be here again  
Save the real world for the suits in the cells  
Who only think theyre free when freedom sells  
And I would not hesitate to say that I will not be here again  
In the real world in the real world  
Baa raa baa baa baa baa raa baa baa baa
