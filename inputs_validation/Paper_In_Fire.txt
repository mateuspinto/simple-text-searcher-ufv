She had a dream  
And boy it was a good one  
So she chased after her dream  
With much desire  
But when she got too close  
To her expectations  
Well the dream burned up  
Like paper in fire  
  
Paper in fire  
Stinkin up the ashtrays  
Paper in fire  
Smokin up the alleyways  
Whos to say the way  
A man should spend his days  
Do you let them smolder  
Like paper in fire  
  
He wanted love  
With no involvement  
So he chased the wind  
Thats all his silly life required  
And the days of vanity  
Went on forever  
And he saw his days burn up  
Like paper in fire  
  
Paper in fire  
Stinkin up the ashtrays  
Paper in fire  
Smokin up the alleyways  
Whos to say the way  
A man should spend his days  
Do you let them smolder  
Like paper in fire  
  
Theres a good life  
Right across this green field  
And each generation  
Stares at it from afar  
But we keep no check  
On our appetites  
So the green fields turn to brown  
Like paper in fire  
  
Paper in fire  
Stinkin up the ashtrays  
Paper in fire  
Blowin down the alleyways  
Whos to say the way  
A man should spend his days  
Do you let them smolder  
Like paper in fire  
  
Paper in fire  
Stinkin up the ashtrays  
Paper in fire  
Blowin down the alleyways  
Whos to say the way  
A man should spend his days  
Do you let them smolder  
Like paper in fire
