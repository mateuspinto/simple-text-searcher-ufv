Easter Sunday we were walking  
Easter Sunday we were talking  
Isabel my little one take my hand Time has come  
  
Isabella all is glowing  
Isabella all is knowing  
And my heart Isabella  
And my head Isabella  
  
Frederick and Vitalie savior dwells inside of thee  
Oh the path leads to the sun Brother sister time has come  
  
Isabella all is glowing  
Isabella all is knowing  
Isabella we are dying  
Isabella we are rising  
  
I am the spring the holy ground  
The endless seed of mystery  
The thorn the veil the face of grace  
The brazen image the thief of sleep  
The ambassador of dreams the prince of peace  
I am the sword the wound the stain  
Scorned transfigured child of Cain  
I rend I end I return  
Again I am the salt the bitter laugh  
I am the gas in a womb of light the evening star  
The ball of sight that leads that sheds the tears of Christ  
Dying and drying as I rise tonight  
  
Isabella we are rising  
Isabella we are rising
