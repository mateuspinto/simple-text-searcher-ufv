I want to be yours I want to be loved  
Giving loving rolling revving   
The rhythm divine  
Giving loving rolling revving   
The rhythm divine  
  
When I saw you the first time  
I knew it was a fine line  
And when I saw you the last time  
You made me  
Stop my game forget my name  
I want to be yours  
  
I want to be yours I want to be loved  
Stop my game forget my name  
  
Giving loving rolling revving   
The rhythm divine  
Stop my game forget my name  
  
I want to be yours I want to be loved
