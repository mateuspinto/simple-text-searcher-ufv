I have spent a lifetime  
Waiting for the chance  
To save you my confession  
Save the one last dance  
The same old superstition  
Haunt us now and then  
Im begging for ignition  
To start it all again  
  
Well burn away  
Burn away burn away my pride  
Well burn away  
Burn away burn away my pride  
Well burn away from all the other flames that burn tonight  
Well burn away  
Burn away burn away my pride  
  
Breathe for me from now on  
Breathe for me when Im gone  
Burn out beyond  
Out beyond the sun  
  
Will you still remember  
There behind the skies  
Walking on the embers  
Standing in their light  
The hardest part is knowing  
Everything must die  
The hardest part is waiting here  
Waiting to collide  
  
Well burn away  
Burn away burn away my pride  
Well burn away  
Burn away burn away my pride  
Well burn away from all the other flames that burn tonight  
Well burn away  
Burn away burn away my pride  
  
Breathe for me from now on  
Breathe for me when Im gone  
Burn out beyond  
Out beyond the sun  
  
Burn on burn on  
Calling to you  
Burn on burn on  
Calling to you  
Burn on burn on  
  
Ill never burn again  
Never burn again  
Never burn again  
Never burn again  
Well never burn again  
Never burn again  
Never burn again  
Never burn again
