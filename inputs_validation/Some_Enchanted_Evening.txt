Some enchanted evening  
You may see a stranger  
You may see a stranger  
Across a crowded room  
And somehow you know  
You know even then  
That somewhere youll see her  
Again and again  
  
Some enchanted evening  
Someone may be laughin  
You may hear her laughin  
Across a crowded room  
And night after night  
As strange as it seems  
The sound of her laughter  
Will sing in your dreams  
  
Who can explain it  
Who can tell you why  
Fools give you reasons  
Wise men never try  
  
Some enchanted evening  
When you find your true love  
When you feel her call you  
Across a crowded room  
Then fly to her side  
And make her your own  
For all through your life you  
May dream all alone  
  
Once you have found her  
Never let her go  
Once you have found her  
Never let her go
