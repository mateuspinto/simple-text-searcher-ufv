Billy Cobin lost it all  
We knew he would eventually  
Some wonders why he took the fall  
Others just ask who the hell is he  
And why should we care for him  
  
A baggy man with baggy clothes  
A face made of paper mache  
He lost his humor years ago  
Along with his molars  
His head planted beneath his shoulders  
  
Kill the pain integrity dont keep you warm and sane  
Dont throw me out with the bath water  
Dont want to be anyone who would want to know me  
  
Billy Cobin had a time Billy Cobin had a place  
Following his fifteen minute climb  
Billy took a seven second leap a cannonball  
Plunge off the deep
