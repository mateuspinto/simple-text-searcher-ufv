Feat Niles Mason  
  
In the big city chasing big dreams  
Seems like the spot lights out of reach  
When will they notice  
Why they dont hear  
Why wont you listen to my melody  
One day I will be a star  
Living life on a high  
My name on a mark big enough to see from Mars  
  
Chorus  
And I wanna be a celebrity  
Everybody knows me the celebrity  
Oh oh oh cause I wanna be a celebrity  
Oh oh oh oh cause I wanna be a celebrity  
  
Paparazzi all around me pictures in every magazine  
 rumors commercial consumers  
This is the reality of a star  
My name on mark big enough to see from Mars  
  
Chorus  
And I wanna be a celebrity  
Everybody knows me the celebrity  
Oh oh oh cause I wanna be a celebrity  
Oh oh oh oh cause I wanna be a celebrity  
Oh oh oh cause I wanna be a celebrity  
Oh oh oh oh cause I wanna be a celebrity  
Everybody know me  
And I wanna be a celebrity  
Everybody knows me the celebrity
