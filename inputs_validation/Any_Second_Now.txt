She remembered all the shadows and the doubts  
The same film  
  
Vivid pictures like a wall thats standing empty  
And the night so still  
  
Such a small affair a relapse  
Someone closing like the nightclub door  
  
Here again and when you speak  
I watch you move away  
And seem so sure  
  
She is hoping to forget  
And the moment almost slips away  
  
When the colours move apart  
And I wonder if you want to stay  
  
And I need to change you  
Like the words Im reading  
Dont you understand  
  
This the warning and the message  
I remember as you touch my hand
