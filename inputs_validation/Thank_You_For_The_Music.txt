Im nothing special  
In fact Im a bit of a bore  
If I tell a joke  
You probably heard it before  
  
But I have a talent  
A wonderful thing  
cause everyone listens  
When I start to sing  
Im so grateful and proud  
All I want is to sing it loud  
  
Chorus  
So I say thank you for the music  
The songs Im singing  
Thanks for all the joy theyre bringing  
Who can live without it I ask in all honesty  
What would life be without a song or dance  
What are we  
So I say thank you for the music  
For giving it to me  
  
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk  
Um she says I began to sing long before I could talk  
But I often wonder how did it all start  
To find that theres nothin can capture a heart  
Like a memory can  
Well whoever it was Im a fan  
  
Chorus  
  
Ive been so lucky I am the girl with golden hair  
I want to sing it out to everybody  
What a joy what a life what a chance  
  
Thank you for the music  
The songs Im singing  
Thanks for all the joy theyre bringing  
Who could live without it I ask in all honesty  
What would life be without a song or dance  
What are we  
So I say thank you for the music  
For giving it to me  
  
So I say thank you for the music  
For giving it to me
