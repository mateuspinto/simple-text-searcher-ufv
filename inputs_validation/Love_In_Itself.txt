All of these insurmountable tasks  
That lay before me  
All of the firsts and the definite lasts  
That lay in store for me  
There was a time  
When all on my mind was love  
Now I find that most of the time  
Loves not enough in itself  
Consequently Ive a tendency to be unhappy  
You see the thoughts in my head  
All the words that were said  
All the blues and the reds get to me  
There was a time  
When all on my mind was love  
Now I find that most of the time  
Loves not enough in itself  
All of these absurdities  
That lay before us  
All of the doubts and the certainties  
That lay in store for us  
There was a time  
When all on my mind was love love love love  
Now I find that most of the time  
Loves not enough in itself
