C Gray  
You walk all over anyone who dares to be a friend  
Screen and yell because you deem them unenlightened  
High upon your horse you preach and preach and preach  
Love thy fellow humans all your filthy little creeps  
Xing off the days  
Xing off the days  
I nearly broke my back as I was handing back for you  
Half the time was hell and half a waste of time  
High upon your horse you preach and preach and preach  
Love thy fellow humans all your filthy little creeps  
Xing off the days  
Xing off the days  
I do not know the answer to the universe I fear  
So drown me cold and go and find your perfect man my  
Dear  
High upon your horse you preach and preach and preach  
Love thy fellow humans all your filthy little creeps  
Xing off the days  
Xing off the days
