I never knew  
If I could believe in you  
I thought I was just a diversion  
And you were killing some time  
My friends they told me  
To leave you  
  
They said you would never  
Be mine  
But you gave me your love  
And you said Im the one  
You want for the rest of  
Your life  
  
Now that I know  
That you want me for me  
I can be what you want  
I can be what you need  
Now that I know  
That your love is for real  
I can finally see  
This is not make believe anymore  
  
I was afraid  
It was all a masquerade  
That I was only a plaything  
And you would leave me behind  
But now I feel so secure  
By your side  
I can conquer the world  
I gave you my love  
And I know youre the one  
I want for the rest  
Of my life  
  
Now that I know  
That you want me for me  
I can be what you want  
I can be what you need  
Now that I know  
That your love is for real  
I can finally see  
This is not make believe anymore  
  
Now that I know  
That you want me for me  
I can be what you want  
I can be what you need  
Now that I know  
That your love is for real  
I can finally see  
This is not make believe anymore  
  
I really feel it  
So much love  
I really feel it  
So much joy  
I feel it  
Sweet sweet ecstasy  
Cause you opened my eyes  
And I realize  
Your love is for real  
  
Now that I know  
That you want me for me  
I can be what you want  
I can be what you need  
Now that I know  
That your love is for real  
I can finally see  
This is not make believe anymore
