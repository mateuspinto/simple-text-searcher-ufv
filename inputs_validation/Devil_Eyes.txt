I got so tired of meaningful looks  
I got so tired of comin up tame  
I was so bothered by those balmy breezes  
I was side swiped by smoke fever  
They was a crawlin  
Oh down beneath my skin  
Til mama come a runnin  
A mama came a runnin  
Mama came a runnin  
Lord said she got a recipe  
Oh and she dont need no fancy sauce  
Yah those devil eyes  
Lord they stare right through me  
Those devil eyes  
Look right through me  
Aww melt my soul down  
Long for those devil eyes
