Get you a copper kettle get you a copper coil  
Fill it with new made corn mash and never more youll toil  
Youll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright  
Watch them just afilling in the pale moonlight  
  
Build you a fire with hickory hickory ash and oak  
Dont use no green or rotten wood theyll get you by the smoke  
Youll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright  
Watch them just afilling in the pale moonlight  
  
My daddy he made whiskey my granddaddy he did too  
We aint paid no whiskey tax since 1792  
Youll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright  
Watch them just afilling in the pale moonlight
