Go tell Aunt Rhody  
Go tell Aunt Rhody  
Go tell Aunt Rhody  
The old gray goose is dead  
The one shes been saving  
The one shes been saving  
The one shes been saving  
To make a feather bed  
The goslings are mourning  
The goslings are mourning  
The goslings are mourning  
Because their mothers dead  
The old ganders weeping  
The old ganders weeping  
The old ganders weeping  
Because his wife is dead  
She died in the mill pond  
She died in the mill pond  
She died in the mill pond  
From standing on her head  
Go tell Aunt Rhody  
Go tell Aunt Rhody  
Go tell Aunt Rhody  
The old gray goose is dead
