The first time I came over I was bitten by your dog  
You werent even there cause you were walking in the fog  
I call you up and plead and beg and talk to your machine  
My friends say not to bother when youre acting pretty mean  
  
But I dont need to bother you no I wont play that part  
I just want access to the inside of your heart  
Access to your thoughts on the way that I should be  
So I could start to change and maybe you could access me  
  
Access me access me  
  
You could tell me all about all the things you did at work  
The guy who sits beside you and how hes acting like a jerk  
And you dont have to open up the secrets of your soul  
But if thats the place you want me Id be glad to pay the toll  
  
But I dont need to bother you no I wont play that part  
I just want access to the inside of your heart  
Access to your thoughts on the way that I should be  
So I could start to change and maybe you could access me  
  
Access me
