I am all fucked up  
And I am ready to break  
I dont wanna be the guy  
Who is always on the outside  
I wanna find my own  
Good place  
  
All fucked up  
And I dont know how  
How I ever got to where I feel  
Like I am dying on the inside  
I want to be happy  
But I dont know how  
  
I am all fucked up  
And its always the same  
I always get so close  
Then I let it get away  
I got no one but  
Myself to blame  
  
Im all fucked up  
And I dont know why  
If the rest of my life  
Is going to be like this  
Think I would rather die  
I am all fucked up  
  
Yes I am all fucked up  
Youre happy  
When you are all fucked up  
Yes I am all fucked up  
  
I am all fucked up  
Yes I am ready to break  
I dont wanna be the guy  
Who is always on the outside  
I wanna find my own  
Good place  
  
All fucked up  
And I dont know how  
How I ever got to where I feel  
Like Im dying on the inside  
I want to be happy now  
  
I am all fucked up  
And it is always the same  
I always get so close  
Then I let it get away  
I got no one but  
Myself to blame  
  
I am all fucked up  
And I dont know why  
If the rest of my life  
Is going to be like this  
Than I think I would rather die  
I am all fucked up
