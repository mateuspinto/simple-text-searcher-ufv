TELL ME OF SPRING  
Come to me at Spring  
Every little thing  
Just makes me want you so  
I Im like the worn leaf  
Blowing to and from  
Until I find my home  
You appear Im alive  
Forget my fears forget all the reasons  
To hide my love inside  
REFRAIN 2 VOICES  
You you brought back my love  
What you do to me  
You brought back my life  
What you do to me  
You brought back my everything  
when you say to me how much I need   
You you brought back the light  
What you do to me  
You took back the night  
What you do to me  
And gave me everything  
when you say to me how much I need   
I fall to the ground  
Send my prayer to the clouds  
There are no choices  
Hear the silence of sound  
Lay your head down  
And drink from the voices  
You appear Im alive  
Forget my fears forget all the reasons  
To hide my love inside  
REFRAIN 2 VOICES  
You you brought back my love  
What you do to me  
You brought back my life  
What you do to me  
You brought back my everything  
when you say to me how much I need   
You you brought back the light  
What you do to me  
You took back the night  
What you do to me  
And gave me everything  
when you say to me how much I need   
SHORT MUSICAL INTERLUDE
