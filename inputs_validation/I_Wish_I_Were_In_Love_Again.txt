The sleepless nights  the daily fights  
The quick toboggan  when you reach the heights  
I miss the kisses  and I miss the bites  
I wish I were in love again  
  
The broken dates  the endless waits  
The lovely loving  and the hateful hates  
The conversation  with the flying plates  
I wish I were in love again  
  
No more pain  no more strain  
Now Im sane  but I would rather be punch  drunk  
  
The pulled out fur  of cat and cur  
The fine mismatching  of a him and her  
Ive learned my lesson  but I wish I were  
In love again  
  
The furtive sigh  the blackened eye  
The words I love you  til the day I die  
The self deception  that believes the lie  
I wish I were in love again  
  
When love congeals  it soon reveals  
The faint aroma  of performing seals  
The doublecrossing  of a pair of heels  
I wish I were in love again  
  
No no more care  no no despair  
Now Im all there now  but Id rather be punch drunk  
  
Believe me sir  I much prefer  
The classic battle  of a him and her  
I dont like quiet  and I wish I were  
In love again  in love again  in love again
