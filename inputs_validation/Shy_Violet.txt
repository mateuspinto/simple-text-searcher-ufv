Light up the sky shy violet angel eyes  
Light up the sky shy violet angel eyes  
  
She dried my eyes and drifted off  
While every tear was held aloft  
The heavy rain clouds felt terrible  
Cause she made my stormy sky beautiful  
  
Light up the sky shy violet angel eyes  
Light up the sky shy violet angel eyes Beautiful  
Light up the sky shy violet angel eyes Beautiful  
Light up the sky shy violet angel eyes  
  
Beautiful  
  
Cause she made my stormy sky beautiful
