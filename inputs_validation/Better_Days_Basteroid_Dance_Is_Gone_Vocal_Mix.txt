What are you hiding from  
You are part of the sum  
What has been going on  
Your confidence has gone  
You have seen better days  
You have lived better ways  
What are you waiting for  
Answers that question more  
Uninvited they will come  
Are you expecting some  
You have seen better days  
You have lived better ways  
Only time will tell  
What will come of you  
Only crime could sell  
What youre trying to  
Where are you heading to  
What plans will you pull through  
With trouble in the wings  
Will you risk anything  
You have seen better days  
You have lived better ways
