Indians scattered on dawns highway bleeding  
Ghosts crowd the young childs fragile eggshell mind  
  
Me and my ah mother and father  and a  
Grandmother and a grandfather  were driving through  
The desert at dawn and a truck load of Indian  
Workers had either hit another car or just  I dont  
Know what happened  but there were Indians scattered  
All over the highway bleeding to death  
  
So the car pulls up and stops That was the first time I tasted fear  
I musta been about four  like a child is like a flower  
His head is just floating in the breeze man  
The reaction I get now thinking about it looking back  
Is that the souls of the ghosts of those dead Indians  
Maybe one or two of em were just running around freaking out  
And just leaped into my soul  
And theyre still in there  
  
Indians scattered on dawns highway bleeding  
Ghosts crowd the young childs fragile eggshell mind  
  
Blood in the streets in the town of New Haven  
Blood stains the roofs and the palm trees of Venice  
Blood in my love in the terrible summer  
Bloody red sun of fantastic LA  
  
Blood screams her brain as they chop off her fingers  
Blood will be born in the birth if a nation  
Blood is the rose of mysterious union  
Blood on the rise its following me  
  
Indian Indian what did you die for  
Indian says nothing at all
