She came looking for me with her arms open wide  
Like some long lost friend of mine  
  
She said Excuse me but do you remember me   
I said No I dont believe I do  
So she looked me up and down  
And undressed me with her eyes  
Then she said Youve got everything I need youve got everything I want  
  
So I said OK  
  
You can wear my hat  
You can have my coat  
You can take my shirt  
Cause I dont need it  
You can wear my shoes  
You can take my socks  
Come on take my bag its yours  
  
If you love it  
You can have it if you love it  
Aint no problem if you love it  
Come on take it if you love it  
  
So her friend came up to me  
With a pen and paper in her hand  
Expressing some interest in the number of my room  
She said Excuse me but do you remember me   
I said No she said Can I appeal to you  
  
So I looked her up and down  
And realizing her insinuations I blushed  
She said Listen babe you dont know me  
No you dont know me but you owe me  
  
And I love you  
Yes I love you  
Put your arms around me cause I love you  
I got all your records and I love you  
  
So I suggested  
  
You can wear my hat  
You can have my coat  
You can take my shirt  
Cause I dont need it  
You can wear my shoes  
You can take my socks  
Come on take my bag its yours  
  
If you love it  
You can have it if you love it  
Aint no problem if you love it  
Come on take it if you love it  
  
Well later on that day this guy came to me  
With a scrap of paper in his hand  
He said Hey buddy can you sign your name for me  
I said Why do I owe you money He said No  
I said Listen pal do I know you Have we ever met  
Why do you want my name on this little piece of paper  
  
He said I love you  
I dont know you but I love you  
Like my brother I love you  
Put your arms around me cause I love you  
  
I said Hey lets not rush things  
  
You can wear my hat  
You can have my coat  
You can take my shirt  
Cause I dont need it  
You can wear my shoes  
You can take my socks  
Come on take my bag its yours  
  
If you love it  
You can have it if you love it  
Aint no problem if you love it  
Come on take it if you love it  
  
You can wear my hat  
You can wear my hat  
You can wear my hat
