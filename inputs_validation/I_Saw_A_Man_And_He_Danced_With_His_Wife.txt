I was by myself drinkin chilled loney wine  
Then he walked in with some woman  
Whos place was once mine  
And she wore his ring on her finger  
And the band began a song  
Id heard before  
  
I saw a man and he danced with his wife  
How I wished he was dancin with me  
Cause I remember before  
When we danced on this floor  
His eyes were only on me  
  
Where did I go wrong  
They were playin our song  
While I was cryin all night long  
I kept watchin as they danced so divine  
I kept hopin kept on lookin  
But I couldnt catch his eye  
  
Oh then he got up  
And he saw me  
But he just walked right on by  
And danced with her  
  
I saw a man and he danced with his wife  
How I wished he was dancin with me  
Cause I remember before  
When we danced on this floor  
His eyes were only on me  
  
Where did I go wrong  
They were playin our song  
While I was cryin all night long  
  
Two weeks later I heard a knock on my door  
He was back  
Just like all those good times before  
Ah then he kissed me  
And he told me I left her cause I love you  
So much more than I knew  
  
I saw a man and he danced with his wife  
But now hes dancin with me  
I remember before  
When we danced on this floor  
His eyes were only on me  
  
I saw a man and he danced with his wife
