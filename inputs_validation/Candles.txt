Take away  
these hands of darkness  
Reaching for my soul  
Now the cold wind  
blows out my candles  
Feeling  
only fear  
without any hope  
  
A thousand dark moons  
A thousand winters long  
A million fallen stars  
the candle burns in the womb  
  
We try not to forget  
they live through us  
Slowly they die away at every candles end  
  
A thousand dark moons  
A thousand winters long  
A million fallen stars  
the candle burns in the womb  
  
We try not to forget  
They live through us  
Slowly they die away at every candles end
