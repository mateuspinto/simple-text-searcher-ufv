Feelin young and full of fun  
Hangin out with my crew  
Hot to trot and about to pop  
Tryin to find some girl to get into  
  
There she was fine as can be  
Hair braided down to her knees  
She took me home she turned me out  
But before sunrise she said I must leave  
  
It was a cold chill on a summer night  
Never thought the girlie wouldnt treat me right  
It was a cold chill on a summer day  
Never thought the girl would dog me out that way  
It was a cold chill on a summer morn  
Never cried like a baby since the day I was born  
It was a cold chill on a summer eve  
Never had no chopper bring me to my knees  
  
I was feeling so trusting  
Gave it all right down to the bone  
But she did me wrong  
On a summer night  
  
Far from meek and feelin chic  
Refusing to concede defeat  
There I was same crew same time  
Same club we kicked it at the previous week  
  
I asked her how could she have the nerve  
To treat me with such disgrace  
She blinked her eyes smiled apologized  
Threw her drink right in my face  
  
It was a cold chill on a summer night  
Never thought the girlie wouldnt treat me right  
It was a cold chill on a summer day  
Never thought the girl would dog me out that way  
It was a cold chill on a summer morn  
Never cried like a baby since the day I was born  
It was a cold chill on a summer eve  
Never had no chopper bring me to my knees  
  
I was feeling so trusting  
Gave it all right down to the bone  
But she did me wrong  
On a summer night on a summer night  
On a summer night on a summer night  
A cold chill a cold chill a cold chill cold chill  
  
Weekends came and weekends passed  
But not the yearning in my heart  
And there she was to light the spark  
Like she did right from the very start  
  
I took no time drove to her house  
Got deep into a passion high  
I heard a knock the turn of a key  
And the voice of another guy  
  
It was a cold chill on a summer night  
Never thought the girlie wouldnt treat me right  
It was a cold chill on a summer day  
Never thought the girl would dog me out that way  
It was a cold chill on a summer morn  
Never cried like a baby since the day I was born  
It was a cold chill on a summer eve  
Never had no chopper bring me to my knees  
  
I was feeling so trusting  
Gave it all right down to the bone  
But she did me wrong  
On a summer night on a summer night  
On a summer night on a summer night  
  
It was a cold chill  
Like standing in the deep freeze  
A cold chill  
Like when snows above your knees  
Cold chill  
Like sitting at the north pole  
A cold chill  
Wearing not one stitch of clothes  
Cold chill  
Like a winter Chicago night  
A cold chill  
Twenty ice cubes down your back for spite  
Cold chill  
Stranded in subzero degrees  
A cold chill  
Laid out on the arctic sea  
Cold chill  
When your fingers get frost bite  
A cold chill  
Buried beneath ten feet of ice  
Cold chill  
Baby that aint so nice  
A cold chill
