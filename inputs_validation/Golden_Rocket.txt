From old Montana down to Alabam Ive been before and Ill travel again  
You triflin women cant keep a good man down  
You dealt the cards but you missed a play so hit the road and be on your way  
Goin board the Golden Rocket and leave this town  
  
I was a good engine a runnin on time but baby Im switchin to another line  
So honey never hang your signal out for me  
Im tired of runnin on the same old track  
Bought a one way ticket and I wont be back  
  
This Golden Rockets gonna roll my blues away  
Hear that lonesome whistle blow thats your cue and by now you know  
That I got another true lover waitin in Tennessee  
This midnight special is a burnin the rail so woman dont try to follow my
trail  
  
This Golden Rockets gonna blow my blues away  
Hear her thunder on through the night this Golden Rocket is a doin me right  
And that sunny old southland sure is a part of me  
Now from your call board erase my name your fire went out you done lost your
flame  
  
And this Golden Rocket is rollin my blues away  
That old conductor he seemed to know you done me wrong I was feelin low  
For he yelled aloud were over that Dixon Line  
The brakeman started singin a song said youre worried now but it wont be
long  
  
This Golden Rocket is leavin your blues behind  
Then the porter yelled with his southern drawl lets rise and shine good
mornin ya all  
And I sprang to my feet to greet the new born day  
When I kissed my baby in the station door the whistle blew like it never
before  
Of the Golden Rocket that rolled my blues away
