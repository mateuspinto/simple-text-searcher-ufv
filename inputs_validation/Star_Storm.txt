Lost myself in a distant starry storm  
Trying to find my way down  
Somebody shut child a door in my head  
Had to turn around  
But I gotta little time to set by  
Gotta let my feelings all shine  
You know that it will be all right  
I gotta get your love for just mine  
Found a starry storm it held me close  
Tryin to find my way home  
Took a distant walk in a starry mile  
Had to turn and smile  
But I gotta little time to let my  
Gotta let my feelings all fly  
You know that it will be all right  
Gotta get your love for just mine  
Hold on fast gonna catch a shooting star  
Gotta find me a way  
Get from this starry storm today  
Never leave this place  
But I gotta little time to let fly  
Gotta let my feelings oh shine  
You know that it will be all right  
Gotta get your loving just right  
Instrumental  
Found a starry storm held me close  
Take me back today  
All I want to do is fly away  
Really couldnt say  
But I gotta little time to set by  
Gotta let my feelings all shine  
You know that it will be all right  
Gotta get your loving just right  
Lost myself by heavens chance  
Trying to find a way down  
Took a distance walk in a starry mile  
Had to turn and smile  
But I gotta little time to let fly  
Gotta let my feelings oh shine  
You know that it will be oh right  
Gotta get your loving just fine
