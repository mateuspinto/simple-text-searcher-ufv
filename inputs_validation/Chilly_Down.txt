When the sun goes down when the sun goes down  
And the bats are back to bed and the bats are back  
The brothers come round the brothers come round  
I get out of my dirty bed my dirty bed  
I shake my pretty little head I shake my pretty little head  
Tap my pretty little feet tap my pretty little feet  
Feeling brighter than sunlight oh  
Louder than thunder oh  
Bouncing like a yoyo whoa oh  
  
Dont got no problems no problems  
Aint got no suitcase no suitcase  
Aint got no clothes to worry about no clothes to worry about  
Aint got no real estate or jewelry or gold mines to hang me up  
  
I just throw in my hand throw in my hand  
With the chilliest bunch in the land in the land  
They dont look much oh  
They sure chilly chilly oh  
They positively glow glow huh oh  
  
Chilly down with the fire gang  
Think small with the fire gang Its the only way  
Bad hep with the fire gang a smile a day keeps the doctor away  
When your thing gets wild  
Chilly down  
  
Chilly down with the fire gang Hey Im a wild child  
Act tall with the fire gang whoo walk tall  
Good times bad food yeah  
When your thing gets wild  
Chilly down chilly down  
  
Drive you crazy really lazy eye rollin funky strollin ball playin  
Hip swayin trouble makin booty shakin tripping passing jumping  
Bouncing drivin stylin creeping pouncing shoutin screamin  
Double dealin rockin rollin and a reelin  
With the mackin sex appealin  
Can you dig our groovy feelin  
  
So when things get too tough get too tough  
And your chin is dragging on the ground dragging on the ground  
And even down looks up down looks up  
Bad luck heh heh  
We can show you a good time show you a good time  
And we dont charge nothin nothin at all  
Just strut your nasty stuff  
Wiggle in the middle yeh  
Get the town talkin fire gang  
  
Chilly down with the fire gang think small  
Think small with the fire gang  
Bad hep with the fire gang hey listen up  
When your thing gets wild  
Chilly down  
  
Chilly down with the fire gang hey shake your pretty little head  
Think small with the fire gang tap your pretty little feet  
Good times bad food come on come on  
When your thing gets wild  
Chilly down

Think small with the fire gang  
Bad hep with the fire gang
