Somethings gotten hold of my heart  
Keeping my soul and my senses apart  
Somethings gotten into my life  
Cutting its way through my dreams like a knife  
Youre turning me up and turning me down  
Making me smile and making me frown  
  
In a world that was small I once lived in a time  
There was peace with no trouble at all  
But then you came my way  
And a feeling unknown shook my heart  
Made me want you to stay  
All of my nights and all of my days  
  
I gotta tell you now  
Somethings gotten hold of my hand  
Dragging my soul to a beautiful land  
Yeah something has invaded my nights  
Painting my sleep with a color so bright  
Changing the gray and changing the blue  
Scarlet for me and scarlet for you  
  
Ive got to know if this is the real thing  
Ive got to know whats making my heart sing  
You smile and I am lost for a lifetime  
Each minute spent with you is the right time  
Every hour every day  
You touch me and my mind goes astray  
Baby baby  
  
Somethings gotten hold of my hand  
Dragging my soul to a beautiful land  
Yeah something has invaded my nights  
Painting my sleep with a color so bright  
Changing the gray and changing the blue  
Scarlet for me and scarlet for you
