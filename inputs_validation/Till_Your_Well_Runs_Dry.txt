You said you loved me  
And then you left  
You broke every promise  
You win every bet  
  
Chorus  
You never miss your water  
Till your well runs dry  
So tell me tell me  
Whatcha gonna do  
When your well runs dry  
  
Listen to me darlin  
You cheat and you lie  
Now you come a runnin  
Runnin wanting second try  
  
Chorus  
  
Sat down and sighed  
And I heard you packin  
I watched you pass by me  
But you said nothin  
Not one single word but I know  
Youre gonna miss me  
And youre gonna be blue  
  
Chorus
