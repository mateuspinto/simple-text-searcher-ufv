As I reach for a peach  
Slide a rind down behind  
The sofa in San Tropez  
Breakin a stick  
With a brick on the sand  
Ridin a wave  
In the wake of an old sedan  
  
Sleepin alone in the  
Drone of the darkness  
Scratched by the sand that  
Fell from my love  
Deep in my dreams and I  
Still hear her callin  
If youre alone  
Ill come home  
  
Backward and homebound  
The pigeon the dove  
Gone with the wind  
And the rain on an airplane  
Owning a home  
With no silver spoon  
Im drinking champagne  
Like a good tycoon  
  
Sooner than wait for  
A break in the weather  
Ill gather my farflung  
Thoughts together  
Speeding away  
On the wind to a new day  
And if youre alone  
Ill come home  
  
And I pause for a while  
By a country style  
And listen to the things they say  
Diggin for gold  
With a hoe in my hand  
Open a book  
Take a look at the way things stand  
  
And youre leading me down  
To the place by the sea  
I hear your soft voice  
Calling to me  
Making a date for  
Later by phone  
And if youre alone  
Ill come home
