As I sit around watchin the rain come down  
It puts me in the mood  
It reminds me of the first time I met you girl  
And I hear the rain on the windowpane  
And it brings back memories  
Of the love we made  
And the things that we used to do  
Yes and I recall the thrill of it all  
When the heat had just begun  
Everything was fine nothing never did go wrong  
  
We had a strong love affair strong love affair baby  
From the very start  
We had a strong love affair strong love affair baby  
Then you broke my heart  
I didnt know what to do  
After lovin you  
And I couldnt get a real good start  
We had a strong love affair strong love affair baby  
And I m still missing you a lot  
So when I hear rain it just brings back pain  
You gave the best love I ever had  
Its a doggone shame cause it sure felt good to me  
Sometimes I wonder where did you disappear to  
How did you get away baby  
And I often think of you  
Do you ever think of me baby  
Sometimes love dont work the way you think it should  
When your love jones comes on down baby  
But baby I still care and I think that I always will  
  
We had a strong love affair strong love affair baby  
From the very start  
We had a strong love affair strong love affair baby  
Then you broke my heart  
I didnt know how to act  
After your bags were packed  
And I couldnt get a real good start  
We had a strong love affair strong love affair baby  
And Im still lovin you a lot oh well
