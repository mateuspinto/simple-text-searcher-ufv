The moon that rose now descended  
  
And the love once shared now had ended  
  
And soon the day would come  
  
  
And when the day had come  
  
The light that fell at dawn was cold  
  
The warmth of you had gone  
  
A taste of loneliness  
  
Cut through the earliness  
  
And oh the winds sang of you  
  
Softly they said  
  
All of my favorite dreams were dead  
  
Leaving a cloud of sadness in my head  
  
And though Im buried in  
  
A sad song of the morning wind  
  
I know the day would bring  
  
Another song for me to sing  
  
  
But when the day had come  
  
The light that fell at dawn was cold  
  
The warmth of you had gone  
  
Gooone
