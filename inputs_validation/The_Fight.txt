We are born  
Without a care  
As we grow old  
But unaware  
As we grow tall  
Begin to falter  
We want to know ourselves  
Spread love to all  
  
But we fall down cause we are human  
Yes sweet anger will feed the hunger  
Yes we push through  
Just me and you  
  
We made it through the darkness to the light  
Uh huh we fought  
But still we won the fight  
Oh yes we stand to gain love  
  
A fantasy for you and me  
A beauty light and reality  
No need to feel  
The proof that something  
For all of it is love and harmony  
  
But we falter and yes we are flawed  
As we play victim to such conviction  
And breathe heavily  
Both you and me  
  
We made it through the darkness to the light  
Uh huh we fought  
But still we won the fight  
Oh yes we stand to gain love  
  
For the day by day  
Worried we would fail  
How we flailed and we wailed and we screamed in pain  
Took it step by step  
We could not forget the wounds we felt  
And how we screamed for help  
From the dark dark nights when you held me tight  
And we prayed for light to rescue us  
Yeah we were distressed  
Now were nothing less  
We are strong  
We are blessed  
We are united  
  
We made it through the darkness to the light  
Uh huh we fought  
But still we won the fight  
Oh yes we stand to gain love  
  
We made it through the darkness to the light  
Uh huh we fought  
But still we won the fight  
Oh yes we stand to gain love
