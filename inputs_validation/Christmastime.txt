Chorus  
Ring Christmas bells  
Ring them loud with the message bringing  
Peace on the earth  
Tidings of good cheer  
Come carolers  
Come and join with the angels singing  
Joy to the world  
Christmastime is here again  
  
Children gather around and listen  
Youll hear the sound  
Of angels filling the sky  
Telling everyone  
Christmas time is here  
  
Chorus  
  
Loved ones close to our hearts  
and strangers in lands afar  
Together share in the joy  
Emmanuel  
He has come to dwell  
With one voice  
Let the world rejoice
