One is the ever blazing star  
Sword of the immortal world  
And highest light  
Yes this is our star  
  
Out star is ever rising  
Born of the eternal lamp  
And holy fire  
  
Mighty burning mountain  
The everlasting love of one is  
One is one is one is one is one is  
One is the ever kindling star  
King of the immortal spark  
In heavens eye  
  
Yes this is our star  
Yes this is our star  
Our star our star
