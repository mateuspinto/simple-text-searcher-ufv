A seasoned witch could call you from the depths of your disgrace  
And rearrange your liver to the solid mental grace  
And achieve it all with music that came quickly from afar  
Then taste the fruit of man recorded losing all against the hour  
And assessing points to nowhere leading evry single one  
A dewdrop can exalt us like the music of the sun  
And take away the plain in which we move  
And choose the course youre running  
  
Down at the edge round by the corner  
Not right away not right away  
Close to the edge down by a river  
Not right away not right away  
  
Crossed the line around the changes of the summer  
Reaching out to call the color of the sky  
Passed around a moment clothed in mornings faster than we see  
Getting over all the time I had to worry  
Leaving all the changes far from far behind  
We relieve the tension only to find out the masters name  
  
Down at the end round by the corner  
Close to the edge just by a river  
Seasons will pass you by  
I get up I get down  
Now that its all over and done  
Now that you find now that youre whole  
  
My eyes convinced eclipsed with the younger moon attained with love  
It changed as almost strained amidst clear manna from above  
I crucified my hate and held the word within my hand  
Theres you the time the logic or the reasons we dont understand  
  
Sad courage claimed the victims standing still for all to see  
As armoured movers took approached to overlook the sea  
There since the cord the license or the reasons we understood will be  
  
Down at the edge close by a river  
Close to the edge round by the corner  
Close to the end down by the corner  
Down at the edge round by the river  
  
Sudden problems shouldnt take away the startled memory  
All in all the journey takes you all the way  
As apart from any reality that youve ever seen and known  
Guessing problems only to deceive the mention  
Passing paths that climb halfway into the void  
As we cross from side to side we hear the total mass retain  
  
Down at the edge round by the corner  
Close to the end down by a river  
Seasons will pass you by  
I get up I get down  
  
In her white lace you could clearly see the lady sadly looking  
Saying that shed take the blame  
For the crucifixion of her own domain  
  
I get up  
I get down  
I get up  
I get down  
  
Two million people barely satisfy  
Two hundred women watch one woman cry too late  
The eyes of honesty can achieve  
How many millions do we deceive each day  
I get up I get down  
I get up I get down  
  
In charge of who is there in charge of me  
Do I look on blindly and say I see the way  
The truth is written all along the page  
How old will I be before I come of age for you  
I get up I get down  
I get up I get down  
I get up I get down  
  
The time between the notes relates the color to the scenes  
A constant vogue of triumphs dislocate man it seems  
And space between the focus shape ascend knowledge of love  
As song and chance develop time lost social temprance rules above  
Ah ah  
  
Then according to the man who showed his outstretched arm to space  
He turned around and pointed revealing all the human race  
I shook my head and smiled a whisper knowing all about the place  
On the hill we viewed the silence of the valley  
Called to witness cycles only of the past  
And we reach all this with movements in between the said remark  
  
Close to the edge down by the river  
Down at the end round by the corner  
Seasons will pass you by  
Now that its all over and done  
Called to the seed right to the sun  
Now that you find now that youre whole  
Seasons will pass you by  
I get up I get down  
I get up I get down  
I get up I get down  
I get up
