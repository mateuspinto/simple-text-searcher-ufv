My baby gimme high temperature  
My baby gimme high temperature  
101 when we kiss and dance  
102 with a midnight romance  
103 4 and 5 it get to hot to stay alive  
  
My baby gimme high temperature  
My baby gimme high temperature  
When I see her coming down the street  
I be the fever giver high to the beat  
103 4 and 5 it get to hot to stay alive  
  
My baby gimme high temperature  
My baby gimme high temperature  
97 98 is just a false alarm  
My temperature 105 when I hold her in my arms  
103 4 and 5 it get to hot to stay alive
