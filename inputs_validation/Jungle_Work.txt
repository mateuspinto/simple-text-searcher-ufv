Lear jet SWAT team  
On a midnight run  
With the M16  
And the Ingram gun  
We parachute in  
We parachute out  
Death from above  
Were screaming now  
  
Where the pay is good  
And the risk is high  
Its understood  
Well do or die  
Stun gun in hand  
Where the gun is law  
From Ovamboland  
To Nicaragua  
Strength and muscle and jungle work  
  
Three young men  
In a Russian truck  
With a little MAC10  
Sent em running to the huts  
These few young men  
The few who dare  
To battle in Hell  
Le Mercenaire  
Strength and muscle and jungle work
