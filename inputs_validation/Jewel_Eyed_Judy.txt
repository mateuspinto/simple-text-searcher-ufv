Moonshine time  
Thoughts of you  
Spinning round  
As thoughts do  
  
I just wondered if  
Your eyes still shine  
As they did  
When you were mine  
  
I can see  
In a dream  
Thoughts so clear  
And jewels that gleam  
  
Would your eyes  
Still sparkle then  
If we were once again  
  
Jewel eyed Judy please come home  
Jewel eyed Judy dont leave me alone  
Jewel eyed Judy please come home  
Jewel eyed Judy dont leave me alone  
  
Lovely Judy  
Can you see  
Where it is  
Youre meant to be  
  
Where you lay  
Your head tonight  
May the stars  
Find your light  
  
So am I  
Sitting here  
Moonlight glistens  
On my tears  
  
Is this all  
That we could find  
Chains of memories  
Left behind  
  
Jewel eyed Judy please come home  
Jewel eyed Judy dont leave me alone  
Jewel eyed Judy please come home  
Jewel eyed Judy dont leave me alone
