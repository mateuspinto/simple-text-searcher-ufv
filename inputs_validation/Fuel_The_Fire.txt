Lies  
Under the eyes of suspicion  
A time and place to cause destruction  
Losing respect from the nations  
  
Our own allies disapproval  
Fuel the fire  
Our own fathers shelter lies  
Fuel the fire  
  
Abusive power crushing lives  
Fuel the fire  
Our innocence betrayed  
Bow to the presses of ability  
  
Led times of anger to the grave  
Show times of prosper  
But who is saved  
Under the hand of damnation  
  
Many have lost faith  
Lost all respect from the nations  
Our own allies disapproval  
Fire has gone on too long  
  
Shadows are cast from our rule  
Fire has gone on too long  
Shadows are cast  
Now end the lies  
Forced on me the casualties  
  
Never will I believe  
Kneel along the protective wrong  
Never will I believe  
Never will I believe in your destructive wrong  
  
These eyes have wandered on  
From the disgusting harm that cause so many to bleed  
And leave us with questioning ears  
False informing our belief is serer  
  
Ill always walk on
