Im looking for a sign that I cant see  
The good the bad is somewhere in between  
These warning signs and the servant grinds me down  
The kids are building fires by their homes  
The smoke is sending signals out in code  
These safety suits these parachutes  
I dont know  
  
Gotta stop drop roll  
  
When all these walls come down  
Theyll shake us  
We fight not to be not to be weightless  
Oh when all these stars hit ground  
Theyll wake us  
We fight not to be not to be weightless  
  
Im choking on the words that I cant say  
My lungs are full but everythings misplaced  
And these junkyard dogs these cherry bombs go off  
The sun the sky the moon will fall apart  
Come tumbling down just like a house of cards  
These fire escapes and this lush landscape it fades  
  
When all these walls come down  
Theyll shake us  
We fight not to be not to be weightless  
Oh when all these stars hit ground  
Theyll wake us  
We fight not to be not to be weightless  
Weightless  
  
I can feel this heavyweight hanging around my neck  
I can feel your heartbeat bringing me back  
Back again  
  
When all these walls come down  
Theyll shake us  
We fight not to be not to be weightless  
Oh when all these stars hit ground  
Theyll wake us  
We fight not to be not to be weightless  
Be weightless  
Be weightless
