Memories sharp as daggers  
Pierce into the flesh of today  
The suicide of love took away all that matters  
And buried the remains in an unmarked grave in your heart  
  
With the venomous kiss you gave me Im killing loneliness  
With the warmth of your arms you saved me  
Oh Im killing loneliness with you  
The killing loneliness that turned my heart into a tomb  
Im killing loneliness  
  
Nailed to the cross together  
As solitude begs us to stay  
Disappear with a lie forever  
And denounce the power of death over our souls and secret brings us in to
start a war  
  
With the venomous kiss you gave me Im killing loneliness  
With the warmth of your arms you saved me  
Oh Im killing loneliness with you  
The killing loneliness that turned my heart into a tomb  
Im killing loneliness  
  
Killing loneliness  
Im killing loneliness  
With the venomous kiss you gave me Im killing loneliness  
With the warmth of your arms you saved me
