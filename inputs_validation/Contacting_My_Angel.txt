Contacting my angel contacting my angel  
Shes the one shes the one that satisfies  
Contacting my angel shes the one that satisfies  
Shes the one that I adore  
  
In a telepathic message for my baby  
In a little village through the fog  
Here comes my baby I can tell I can tell  
By the way she walks  
Said Ive been on a journey up the mountain side  
And I drank the water from the stream  
It was pure pure water and I got completely healed  
  
I met a presence on the mountain side  
And he looked so radiant and he was the  
Youth of eternal summers  
Like a sweet bird of youth in my soul  
In my soul in my soul in my soul in my soul  
In my soul in my soul in my soul
