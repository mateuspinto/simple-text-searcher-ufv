I heard about the Ester bunny  
Presents under a Christmas tree  
It was dreaming and fantasy  
There was no Mom or Daddy  
  
I wanted everything  
I wanted everything  
I wanted everything  
  
I had the world on my shoulder  
But I was getting older  
Knew I was ready for it  
Some kind of envelopment  
  
I wanted everything  
I wanted everything  
I wanted everything  
  
All day working on a truck  
Bringing the groceries up  
Not much of a salary  
No tip for the delivery  
  
I wanted everything  
I wanted everything  
I wanted everything  
  
Theres no success for me  
Involved in a robbery  
Theres money in the supermarket  
And Im goin after it  
  
I wanted everything  
I wanted everything  
I wanted everything  
  
I wanted everything  
I wanted everything
