My strength my strength fades  
My strength fades away  
Slowly with the setting sun  
The night brought its  
Darkness and its storms  
And the floods that came  
Reflected a dull moon  
Violent winds raged beneath the stars that didnt shine  
Emptied of myself I fell to the ground  
  
Slowly through the destruction  
Came a single quiet voice  
And the breath of His words consumed  
The night and brought strength I have never felt on my own  
And He held me up until I could walk again  
And promised to stay by my side forever
