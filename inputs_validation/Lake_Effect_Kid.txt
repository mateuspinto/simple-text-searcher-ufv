Sometimes  
When Im in heaven  
I get forgetful of the earth woah oh  
Until I hear you bickering like boys and birds  
The heat is on  
Fixed up and the sheet is down  
  
I got a pocket full of deadliness  
Opium den mother then forget my head  
With the deadrid coke unsteadiness  
Faux blondes have less fun  
  
Pour more in my head my  
Back to the city I grew up in  
Again and again and again  
Forever a lake effect kid  
  
I got the skyline in my veins  
Forget your night times  
Summer love on a gurney with a squeaky wheel  
And joke us joke us  
Till lake shore drive comes back into focus  
I just want to come back to love  
Spark until you hit it  
Keep you warm at night  
  
I got a pocket full of deadliness  
Opium den mother then forget my head  
With the deadrid coke unsteadiness  
Faux blondes have less fun fun  
  
Pour more in my head  
Back to the city I grew up in  
Again and again and again  
Forever a lake effect kid x4
