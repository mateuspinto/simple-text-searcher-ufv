We go sailing down the calming streams  
Drifting endlessly by the bridge  
To be over  
We will see  
To be over  
  
Do not suffer through the game of chance that plays  
Always doors to lock away your dreams  
Think it over  
Time will heal your fear  
Think it over  
Balance the thoughts that release within you  
  
Childlike soul dreamer one journey  
One to seek and see in every light do open  
True pathways away  
  
Carrying closer go gently  
Holding doors will open every way  
You wander true pathways away  
  
After all your soul will still surrender  
After all dont doubt your part  
Be ready to be loved
