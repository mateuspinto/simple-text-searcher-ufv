Here under heavens eyes  
down under paradise  
sometimes it seems like were so small  
Here on the shores that reach  
into infinity  
how could we matter much at all  
Would it be enough  
if each of us would give our love  
Like sand on a mountain  
rain on a fountain  
shade on a shadow  
a breeze in this tornado  
just do what you can  
Clap with one hand  
and shine all your light in the sun  
We live to learn to love  
Oh mercy from above  
Amazing grace like rain comes falling down  
We sing our hearts to you  
our song of gratitude  
The voice of evry soul  
how sweet the sound  
We can only trust  
all our prayers will all add up  
Like sand on a mountain  
rain on a fountain  
shade on a shadow  
a breeze in this tornado  
just do what you can  
Clap with one hand  
and shine all your light in the sun  
Would it be enough  
if each of us would give our love  
Like sand on a mountain  
rain on a fountain  
shade on a shadow  
a breeze in this tornado  
just do what you can  
Clap with one hand  
and shine all your light in the sun
