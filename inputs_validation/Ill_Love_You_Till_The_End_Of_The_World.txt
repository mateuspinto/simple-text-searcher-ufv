It was a miracle I even got outta longwood alive  
This town fulla men with big mouths and no guts  
I mean if you can just picture it  
The whole third floor of the hotel gutted by the blast  
And the street below showered in shards of broken glass  
And all the drunks pourin outta the dance halls  
Starin up at the smoke and the flames  
And the blind pencil seller wavin his stick  
Shoutin for his dog that lay dead on the side of the road  
And me if you can believe this at the wheel of the car  
Closin my eyes and actually prayin  
Not to god above but to you sayin  
  
Help me girl help me girl  
Ill love you till the end of the world  
With your eyes black as coal and your long dark curls  
  
Some things we plan we sit and we invent and we plot and cook up  
Others are works of inspiration of poetry  
And it was this genius hand that pushed me up the hotel stairs  
To say my last goodbye  
To her hair white as snow and her pale blue eyes  
Saying I gotta go I gotta go the bomb and the bread basket  
Are ready to blow  
In this town of men with big mouths and no guts  
The pencil sellers dog spooked by the explosion  
And leapin under my wheels as I careered outta longwood on my way to you  
Waiting in your dress in your dress of blue  
  
I said thank you girl thank you girl  
Ill love you till the end of the world  
With your eyes black as coal and your long dark curls  
  
And with the horses prancin through the fields  
With my knife in my jeans and the rain on the shield  
I sang a song for the glory of the beauty of you  
Waiting for me in your dress of blue  
  
Thank you girl thank you girl  
Ill love you till the end of the world  
With your eyes black as coal and your long dark curls
