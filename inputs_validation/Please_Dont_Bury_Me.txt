Woke up this morning  
Put on my slippers  
Walked in the kitchen  
And died  
  
And oh what a feeling  
When my soul  
Went through the ceiling  
And on up into heaven I did ride  
  
When I got there they did say  
John it happened this way  
You slipped upon the floor  
And hit your head  
  
And all the angels say  
Just before you passed away  
That these were the very last words  
That you said  
  
Please dont bury me  
Down in that cold cold ground  
No Id rather have em cut me up  
And pass me all around  
  
Throw my brain in a hurricane  
And the blind can have my eyes  
And the deaf can take both of my ears  
If they dont mind the size  
  
Give my stomach to Milwaukee  
If they run out of beer  
Put my socks in a cedar box  
Just to get em out of here  
  
Venus De Milo can have my arms  
Look out Ive got your nose  
Sell my heart to the junk man  
And give my love to Rose  
  
But please dont bury me  
Down in that cold cold ground  
Id rather have em cut me up  
And pass me all around  
  
Throw my brain in a hurricane  
The blind can have my eyes  
And the deaf can take both of my ears  
If they dont mind the size oh man  
  
Give my feet to the footloose  
Careless fancy free  
And give my knees to the needy  
Dont pull that stuff on me  
  
Hand me down my walking cane  
Its a sin to tell a lie  
Send my mouth way down south  
And kiss my ass goodbye  
  
But please dont bury me  
Down in that cold cold ground  
Id rather have em cut me up  
And pass me all around  
  
Throw my brain in a hurricane  
And the blind can have my eyes  
And the deaf can take both of my ears  
If they dont mind the size thats right
