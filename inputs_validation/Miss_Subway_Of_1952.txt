MISS SUBWAY OF 1952  
WRITER MARY F CAIN  
To my idol the divine  
Hope this never happens to us  
Chorus  
She may look a little worn out  
She may have a couple of gray hairs  
A little ragged a little haggard  
A few wrinkles here and there  
But you should of seen her 21 years ago  
She would of captivated you  
Why she was Miss Subway of 1952  
She had a stunting figure  
And her hips werent any bigger  
Than her bust line  
Shes gotten just a little saggy  
And her skins a trifle baggy  
But there was a time  
When everything was perfectly place  
She had a beautiful face  
She may look a little made up  
Especially around the eyes  
A little groupie a little droopy  
But once they were quit a prize  
Yes you should of seen her 21 years ago  
They were a devastating view  
Why she was Miss Subway of 1952  
She had a million men around her  
Giving gifts that would astound her  
Why she couldnt even walk down the street  
Yeah she had lovers by the dozen  
And she even had some cousins  
Who just couldnt stop  
Throwing themselves at her feet  
She was so dainty and sweet  
Chorus
