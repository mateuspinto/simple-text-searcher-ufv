Let the pendulum swing  
Let the old guard surrender  
It is a new day a new world  
A new language I wish to speak  
The language of love  
May I have the words I need to speak my truth  
To translate my heart and my vision  
To my beloved and his children  
To all who come to sit at our table  
Or walk with us through the market place  
Or pray with us by the water  
  
May I have the plain poetry to tell them how I feel  
Or why there is pain  
If the answers are mine to know  
And if they are I ask the Spirit to let me share them  
With a light heart with laughter  
Wth no expectation with humility  
But for the grace of Thee go I  
May I know my innocence  
Every moment of every day  
May I be a child forever  
Intoxicated by hot sand cool winds by love  
By my own communication to the Spirit  
May my aliveness always be as loud  
When I make love as when I cry  
May I see my own reflection in the mirror  
And smile  
  
My love  
You are my teacher  
And I surrender to your heart  
The purest heart Ive ever seen  
Today I give you everything that is mine to give  
My truth  
All my innocence  
and all my heart  
I am yours  
Let the dance begin
