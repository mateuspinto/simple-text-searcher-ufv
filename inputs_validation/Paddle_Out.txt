I never thought that when I grew up I would be in a band  
And travel to all the best spots in the land  
Im not here to brag or boast  
Im just here to tell you bout the spots that I love the most  
  
Natural bridges on a clean west swell  
Breaks over the reef like a bat out of hell  
Stockton Avenue gets hollow and mean  
And on a big day it works like a machine  
Outside Stockton gets hot like a glove  
Swift St Johns St into Michells Cove  
Big Steamer Lane makes you wish you were a trout  
When its mackin so hard only two dudes paddle out  
  
A huge Summertime South swell hit when Im in my hometown  
Im a surfside boy is where I can be found  
Or up and down the coast  
Checkin the spots that I love the most
