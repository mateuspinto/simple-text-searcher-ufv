Where do you go when your conscience takes over  
Do you crawl to your corner and cry  
Did you imagine that no one would notice  
Just a secret to take when you die  
  
All the world is watching you every tongue is  
Screaming sinner  
  
How are your dreams do they claw at your sleep  
Making darkness a place you despise  
Where is the god that once was your strength  
Are you sure he was there from the start  
  
All the world is watching you nowhere you can hide  
Every tongue is screaming sinner only satan hears your cries  
  
When you sin cardinal sin you make your bed and on it you must lie  
And your futures looking grim but did you ever give a damn  
About the child hes running wild  
When you sin cardinal sin dont you expect the world will treat you well  
We say oh go to hell  
  
We point the finger sin cardinal sin laugh in your face sin  
Cardinal sin  
We point the finger laugh in your face  
Cos youre no better than the rest of the human race  
  
Oh sin cardinal sin oh sin cardinal sin
