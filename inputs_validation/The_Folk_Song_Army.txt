We are the folk song army  
Every one of us cares  
We all hate poverty war and injustice  
Unlike the rest of you squares  
  
There are innocuous folk songs yeah  
But we regard em with scorn  
The folks who sing em have no social conscience  
Why they dont even care if Jimmy Crack Corn  
  
If you feel dissatisfaction  
Strum your frustrations away  
Some people may prefer action  
But give me a folk song any old day  
  
The tune dont have to be clever  
And it dont matter if you put a couple extra syllables into a line  
It sounds more ethnic if it aint good English  
And it dont even gotta rhyme excuse me rhyne  
  
Remember the war against Franco  
Thats the kind where each of us belongs  
Though he may have won all the battles  
We had all the good songs  
  
So join in the folk song army  
Guitars are the weapons we bring  
To the fight against poverty war and injustice  
Ready aim sing
