Do you believe in Heaven  
That mans soul is eternal  
Our prayers are always answered  
And miracles can happen  
  
Save me  
  
But dont you wonder  
The Holy Ghost and Jesus  
In paradise and angels  
That God is all forgiving  
  
Save me  
  
Reward the faithful  
He lies to you and deceives  
A dark salvation comes  
Innocence bleeding  
  
Too dark to see the pictures of Heaven  
Too dark to find the Garden of Eden  
Blinded by faith and stories of wonder  
Devine mercy Mercy lies bleeding  
  
Save me
