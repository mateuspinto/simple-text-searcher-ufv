Someone stood beside me for a moments in the rain  
A silhouette a cigarette and a gesture of disdain  
I felt a dark door open saw a sudden ghost come through  
A spark leap from my fingertip and I knew it must be you  
Aint you the man who dies every day  
Youre the man who dies every day  
Youre the man  
We never saw you walk in we never saw you leave  
You flick the ashes off a lap on everybodys sleeve  
You always play that funny pack of cards without an ace  
And every street you ever walked is mapped out on your face  
Cause youre the man who dies every day  
Youre the man who dies every day  
Youre the man  
You always kept a sunset behind your lonely shoulder  
You never showed on photographs and you never grew much older  
You flicker like a shaky shadow moving like a thief  
You never drop your facade and you never seek relief  
Cause youre the man who dies every day  
Youre the man who dies every day  
Youre the man who dies every day  
Youre the man who dies every day  
Youre the man
