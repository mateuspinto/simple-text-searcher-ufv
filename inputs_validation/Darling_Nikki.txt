I knew a girl named Nikki  
I guess you could say she was a sex fiend  
I met her in a hotel lobby  
Masturbating with a magazine  
  
She said howd you like to waste some time  
And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind  
  
She took me to her castle  
And I just couldnt believe my eyes  
She had so many devices  
Everything that money could buy  
She said sign your name on the dotted line  
The lights went out  
And Nikki started to grind  
  
Ahh  
Nikki  
Oh  
  
The castle started spinning  
Or maybe it was my brain  
I cant tell you what she did to me  
But my body will never be the same  
Her lovin will kick your behind  
Oh shell show you no mercy  
But shell sho nough sho nough show you how to grind  
  
Woke up the next morning  
Nikki wasnt there  
I looked all over and all I found  
Was a phone number on the stairs  
It said thank you for a funky time  
Call me up whenever you want to grind  
  
Ah  
Nikki  
Oh  
Ah  
Come back Nikki  
Come back
