Better than watching Gellar  
Bending silver spoons  
Better than witnessing  
Newborn nebulas in bloom  
She who sees from up  
  
High smiles and surely sings  
Perspective pries her once  
Weighty eyes and  
It gives you wings  
I havent felt the way  
I feel today  
  
In so long its hard  
For me to specify  
Im beginning to notice  
How much this feels like  
A waking limb  
Pins and needles  
Nice to know you  
Goodbye  
Nice to know you  
  
Deeper than the deepest  
Coustou would ever go  
Higher than the heights of what  
We often think we know  
Blessed she who clearly  
Sees the wood for the trees  
To obtain a birds eye is to  
Turn a blizzard to a breeze  
  
I havent felt the way  
I feel today  
In so long its hard  
For me to specify  
Im beginning to notice  
How much this feels like  
A waking limb  
Pins and needles  
Nice to know you  
Goodbye  
Nice to know you  
To know you  
  
Could it be that it had  
Been there all along  
  
I havent felt the way  
I feel today  
In so long its hard  
For me to specify  
Im beginning to notice  
How much this feels like  
A waking limb  
Pins and needles  
Nice to know you  
Goodbye  
Nice to know you  
To know  
You
