Well I never will forget that floating bridge  
Lord I never will forget that floating bridge  
Lord I never will forget that floating bridge  
They tell me five minutes time underwater I was hid  
  
I was going down and I throwed up my hands  
As I was going down I throwed up my hands  
As I was going down I throwed up my hands  
Saying Please Lord take me on dry land  
  
Well they carried me in the house and they laid me cross the bed  
Well they carried me in the house they laid me cross the bed  
Well they carried me in the house they laid me cross the bed  
I couldnt hear nothing but muddy water running round my head  
  
Oh my mother often told me Quit playing a bum  
My mother always told me Quit playing a bum  
Lord my mother always told me Son quit playing a bum  
Go out somewhere and make a crumb  
  
All the people on the bridge was screaming and crying  
Well all the people on the bridge was screaming and crying  
All the people on the bridge stood screaming and crying  
Saying Lord have mercy whers we gwine
