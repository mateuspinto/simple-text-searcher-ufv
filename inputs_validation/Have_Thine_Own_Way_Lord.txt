Have Thine own way Lord Have Thine own way  
Thou art the Potter I am the clay  
Mold me and make me after Thy will  
While I am waiting yielded and still  
  
Have Thine own way Lord Have Thine own way  
Search me and try me Master today  
Whiter than snow Lord wash me just now  
As in Thy presence humbly I bow  
  
Have Thine own way Lord Have Thine own way  
Wounded and weary help me I pray  
Power all power surely is Thine  
Touch me and heal me Savior divine  
  
Have Thine own way Lord Have Thine own way  
Hold oer my being absolute sway  
Fill with Thy Spirit till all shall see  
Christ only always living in me
