The warden who led a prisoner down the hallway to his doom  
I stood up to say goodbye like all the rest  
And I heard him tell the warden just before he reached my cell  
Let my guitar playing friend do my request  
  
Let him sing me back home with a song I used to hear  
Make my old memories come alive  
Oh please take me away and turn back the years  
Sing me back home before I die  
  
I remember Sunday morning a choir from off the streets  
They came in to sing a few old gospel songs  
And I heard him tell the singers theres a song my mama sang  
Wont you sing it once before I move along  
  
Oh wont you sing me back home Theres a songs I used to hear  
Make my old memories come alive  
Please take me away and turn back the years  
Sing me back home before I die  
  
Oh wont you sing me back home before I die
