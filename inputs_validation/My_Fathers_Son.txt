I come from a genius I am my fathers son  
Yeah too bad he was a psychopath and now Im the next in line  
Lonely nest dear mother yes surely shes a work of art  
I never got top dollar but she gave us all a star  
  
Can I get a reprieve  
This gene pool dont hurt me  
Can I beg a release  
From the volunteer amputee  
From the moment I fell  
I called on DNA  
Why such betrayal  
Got me tooth and nail  
  
Yeah hows about one conversation with nothing else left to be had  
Oh is this your long lost son and hes never had dear old dad  
I forget the insemination and for that Im supposed to be glad  
What a pity you left us so soon to climb your mountain of regret  
  
Can I get a reprieve  
This gene pool dark and deep  
Can I beg a release  
Can I volunteer amputee  
From the moment I fell  
I called on DNA  
Why such betrayal  
Oh I gotta set sail  
  
Oh real bright light shining as youre trying to breathe in thin air  
Cannot forget youre hiding collected wounds left unhealed  
When every thought youre thinking sinks you darker than the new moon sky  
The faraway lights rising in the whites of your eyes  
  
Now father youre dead and gone and Im finally free to be me  
Thanks for all your dark gifts for which Ive got no sympathy  
Im living in a walledup place in the bounds of fifth symphony  
Thanks for this and thanks for that I gotta let go learn to see legacy  
  
Can I get a reprieve  
This gene pool dont hurt me  
Can I beg a release  
Can I volunteer amputee  
From the moment I fell  
I called on DNA  
Why such betrayal  
Oh I gotta set sail
