I am a man who travelled everywhere  
Holding mirages made of hair  
Mansions of silver women of gold  
Well all I had was the tale I told  
Ive been a wanderer I can let go  
But you would do better to stay  
Dont burn the bridge  
That brought you over  
Or youll be travelling all your days  
I had no family I had no real friends  
I had a lover who more then just pretends  
She played a mind game  
I played it too  
When youre in love thosere the things you do  
Ive been a loser Ive won the game  
Ive had power fortune and fame  
Dont burn the bridge that brought you over  
For youre a poor man just the same  
Poor man  
Poor man  
Yes Ill admit Ive burned my bridges one and all  
That I have turned my back on some who tried to see me fall  
And then you came and built a bridge where once there was a wall in my life  
I can cross over live on the other side  
I was a rover until I met my bride  
She has the magic I have the dreams  
With her my life is really all it seems  
Theres no illusion this is for real  
And Im so satisfied deep within  
You are the bridge that brought me over  
And you are everywhere Ive ever been  
Your man  
Im your man  
Yes Ill admit Ive burned my bridges one and all  
That I have turned my back on some who tried to see me fall  
And then you came to build a bridge where once there was a wall  
Came and built a bridge where there was a wall  
Came and built a bridge where there was a wall  
In my life  
In my life
