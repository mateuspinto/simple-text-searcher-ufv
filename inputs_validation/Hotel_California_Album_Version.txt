Verse 1  
On a dark desert highway cool wind in my hair  
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air  
Up ahead in the distance I saw a shimmering light  
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim I had to stop for the night  
There she stood in the doorway  
I heard the mission bell  
And I was thinking to myself  
This could be Heaven or this could be Hell  
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way  
There were voices down the corridor I thought I heard them say  
  
Chorus  
Welcome to the Hotel California  
Such a lovely place such a lovely place  
Such a lovely face  
Plenty of room at the Hotel California  
Any time of year any time of year  
You can find it here  
  
Verse 2  
Her mind is Tiffany twisted shes got the Mercedes Benz  
Shes got a lot of pretty pretty boys that she calls friends  
How they dance in the courtyard sweet summer sweat  
Some dance to remember some dance to forget  
So I called up the Captain Please bring me my wine  
He said We havent had that spirit here since 1969  
And still those voices are calling from far away  
Wake you up in the middle of the night just to hear them say  
  
Chorus  
Welcome to the Hotel California  
Such a lovely place such a lovely place  
Such a lovely face  
Theyre livin it up at the Hotel California  
What a nice surprise what a nice surprise  
Bring your alibies  
  
Outro  
Mirrors on the ceiling and pink champagne on ice  
And she said We are all just prisoners here  
Of our own device  
And in the masters chambers they gathered for the feast  
They stab it with their steely knives but they just cant kill the beast  
Last thing I remember I was running for the door  
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before  
Relax said the nightman We are programed to receive  
You can check out any time you like but you can never leave
