After he had journeyed  
And his feet were sore  
And he was tired  
He came upon an orange grove  
And he rested  
  
And he lay in the cool  
And while he rested  
He took to himself an orange  
And tasted it  
And it was good  
  
And he felt the earth to his spine  
And he asked  
And he saw the tree above him  
And the stars  
And the veins in the leaf  
And the light  
And the balance  
  
And he saw magnificent perfection  
Whereon he thought of himself in balance  
And he knew he was  
  
Just open your eyes and realize  
The way its always been  
Just open your mind and you will find  
The way its always been  
Just open your heart and thats a start  
  
And he thought of those he angered  
For he was not a violent man  
And he thought of those he hurt  
For he was not a cruel man  
And he thought of those he frightened  
For he was not a evil man  
  
And he understood  
He understood himself  
Upon this  
He saw that when he was of anger  
Or knew hurt  
Or felt fear  
It was because he was not understanding  
And he learned compassion  
  
And with his eye of compassion  
He saw his enemies  
Like unto himself  
And he learned love  
Then he was answered  
  
Just open your eyes and realize  
The way its always been  
Just open your mind and you will find  
The way its always been  
Just open your heart and thats a start  
  
Just open your eyes and realize  
The way its always been  
Just open your mind and you will find  
The way its always been  
Just open your heart and thats a start
