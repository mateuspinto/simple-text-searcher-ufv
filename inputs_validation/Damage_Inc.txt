Dealing out the agony within  
Charging hard and no ones gonna give in  
Living on your knees conformity  
Or dying on your feet for honesty  
Inbred our bodies work as one  
Bloody but never cry submission  
Following our instinct not a trend  
Go against the grain until the end  
  
Chorus  
Blood will follow blood  
Dying time is here  
Damage Incorporated  
  
Slamming through dont fuck with razorback  
Stepping out Youll feel our hell on your back  
Blood follows blood and we make sure  
Life aint for you and were the cure  
Honesty is my only excuse  
Try to rob us of it but its no use  
Steamroller action crushing all  
Victim is your name and you shall fall  
  
Chorus  
  
We chew and spit you out  
We laugh you scream and shout  
All flee with fear you run  
Youll know just where we come from  
Damage Incorporated  
Damage jackals ripping right through you  
Sight and smell of this it gets me goin  
Know just how to get just what we want  
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt  
Fuck it all and fucking no regrets  
Never happy ending on these dark sets  
Alls fair for Damage Inc you see  
Step a little closer if you please  
  
Chorus
