Broken heart bloodshot stare  
Signs of a fool who cared too much  
Now shes gone and he cant remember how  
To live without her touch  
Hopin to die but surely livin to tell  
When it comes to matters of the heart  
There is nothing a fool wont get used to  
After all the whisky and the wisdom  
He could swallow he thought  
It was time to start lovin again  
So he found someone  
Afraid his heart would follow the heat  
He could hardly do more than pretend  
Though she knew in her heart  
That his love was alive  
When it comes to matters of the heart  
There is nothing a fool wont get used to  
Now of all the things love teaches  
All the ways that it opens our eyes  
None more profound than the lesson he learned  
The day she walked out of his life  
Well when the road gets too narrow  
Its then he remembers her smile  
And he sees these words forming on her lips  
Across a river of tears he once cried  
When it comes to matters of the heart  
There is nothing you wont get used to  
Ooh nothing a fool wont get used to  
Hey baby
