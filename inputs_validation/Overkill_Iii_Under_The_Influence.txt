Shall I wake or shall I sleep  
With dreams so warm so soft so deep  
A never ending tale enhanced  
A never ending thought  
Entranced  
Its entranced  
  
Take from me what you need  
Take my heart my soul my seed  
A lasting presence inside my mind  
At last a presence a contract signed  
  
Turned my back when I first saw you  
Turned to stone when I ignored you  
Then something greater then my will  
Turned me round to Overkill  
  
From the shadows called my name  
From the cold in to the flame  
The wings around me kept me warm  
Through hollow eyes I was reborn  
  
All around me once dispised  
Could see the world now  
Through his eyes  
A people lead by blind ambition  
Signed on for life into submission  
  
Hear me  
I hear your call  
Obey  
Id give it all  
If all my dreams come to life  
  
Hear me  
I hear your call  
Obey  
Id give it all  
If all my fears come to light  
  
Shall I wake or shall I dream  
Shall I become just what it seems  
A never ending tale fulfilled  
A never ending Overkill  
  
To see to taste to touch the world  
In jaded glory danced and whirled  
To see it happen as was told  
As new beginnings now unfold  
  
Light the sky the glow above  
See the bat eat the dove  
Another stage completed mission  
Signed on for life into submission
