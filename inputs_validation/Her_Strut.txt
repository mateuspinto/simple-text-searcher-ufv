Shes totally committed  
To major independence  
But shes a lady through and through  
She gives them quite a battle  
All that they can handle  
Shell bruise some  
Shell hurt some too  
But oh they love to watch her strut  
Oh they do respect her but  
They love to watch her strut  
  
Sometimes theyll want to leave her  
Just give up and leave her  
But they would never play that scene  
In spite of all her talking  
Once she starts in walking  
The lady will be all they ever dreamed  
Oh theyll love to watch her strut  
Oh theyll kill to make the cut  
They love to watch her strut  
  
Yeah love to watch her strut  
Watch her strut
