The spirit of American the spirit of the skies  
Its standing tall for all to share wherever freedom flies  
It stretches out across the hills and streams over every mountain high  
And turns the prairies into fields of dreams  
When you reach for lofty places when you soar through open spaces  
What your heart and soul embraces in the sky  
The spirit of American the spirit of the skies  
Its standing tall for all to share wherever freedom flies  
The spirit of American the spirit of the skies  
Its standing tall for all to share wherever freedom flies  
Its standing tall for all to share wherever freedom flies  
Something special in the air  
The spirit of American the spirit of the skies  
Thats where freedom flies
