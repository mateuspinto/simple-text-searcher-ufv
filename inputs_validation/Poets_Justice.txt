Cold winds and cloudy skies  
Turned to sweetness in her eyes  
Fantasies I realized  
Came to life to my surprise  
  
Rain came and took her away  
Just when I thought  
She was here to stay  
Sun gone I was left high and dry  
Love came by and touched me  
And kissed me so long  
  
Shine hard October moon  
Eagle take me to her soon  
Run swiftly silver stream  
Find my love or let me dream  
  
Half of me is all of her  
Id be much happier if I were whole  
All my words and wisdom fall  
The poets justice  
Leads me to my goal  
Leads me to my goal
