Goodbye no use leading with our chins  
This is where our story ends  
Never lovers ever friends  
Goodbye let our hearts call it a day  
But before you walk away  
I sincerely want to say  
I wish you bluebirds in the spring  
To give your heart a song to sing  
And then a kiss but more than this  
I wish you love  
And in July a lemonade  
To cool you in some leafy glade  
I wish you health  
But more than wealth  
I wish you love  
My breaking heart and I agree  
That you and I could never be  
So with my best  
My very best  
I set you free  
I wish you shelter from the storm  
A cozy fire to keep you warm  
But most of all when snowflakes fall  
I wish you love  
But most of all when snowflakes fall  
I wish you love  
I wish you love  
I wish you love love love love love  
I wish you love
