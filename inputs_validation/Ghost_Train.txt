I took the cannonball down to the ocean  
Across the desert from sea to shining sea  
I rode a ladder that climbs across the nation  
Fifty million feet of earth between the buried and me  
  
How do you do  
She said Hey how do you do  
  
She buys a ticket cause its cold where she comes from  
She climbs aboard because shes scared of getting older in the snow  
Love is a ghost train rumbling through the darkness  
Hold on to me darling Ive got nowhere else to go  
  
How do you do  
She said How do you do  
  
I took the cannonball down to the ocean  
Watched the diesel disappear beneath the tumbling waves  
Love is a ghost train howling on the radio  
Remember everything she said when only memory remains  
  
How do you do  
She said Hey how do you do
