Vain boys are gonna have to swallow their pride this time  
So let the punishment fit the crime  
Its under the table  
Under your skin  
Into the cable  
Is this the death of the glory youre in  
  
Chorus  
Black sails in the sunset  
White noise going yaketyyak  
All the money in the world will never bring your body back  
Is it some mysterious dance nobody can do  
Thought I knew all the steps quite clearly  
I dont have a clue  
Oooh  
  
Youre Cinderella with a ball and chain  
And the shoe seems to fit you  
You tell the truth sometimes but  
You wouldnt know it if it hit you  
Is this some new trick  
Wired up in your head  
Do you make me sick  
Or was I just force fed  
  
Chorus
