Now the day is gone  
And I sit alone and think of you girl  
What can I do without you in my life  
Wondring if you love me  
Or just making a fool of me  
Well I hope you understand  
I just had to go back to the island  
  
And watch the sun go down  
Hear the sea roll in  
Ill be thinking of you  
And how it might have been  
Hear the night bird cry  
Watch the sunset down  
Well I hope you understand  
I just had to go back to the island  
  
For all the sunny skies its rainin in my heart  
I know down in my soul Im really gonna miss you  
But it had to end this way  
With all the games we played  
Well I hope you understand  
I just had to go back to the island  
  
And watch the sun go down  
Hear the sea roll in  
Ill be thinking of you  
And how it might have been  
Hear the night bird cry  
Watch the sunset down  
Well I hope you understand  
I just had to go back to the island
