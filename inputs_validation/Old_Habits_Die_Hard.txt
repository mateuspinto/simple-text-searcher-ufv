Old habits die hard  
Old habits like loving you  
Like spending my days and nights  
In missing you  
Hours that were yours echo like empty rooms  
Strange faces and your place cant keep away the gloom  
Old habits die hard now that youre gone  
Old habits die hard  
Old habits like being true  
Like counting the hours  
Till I could be with you  
Things we used to share I now keep alone  
I waste my nights here by the telephone  
Old habits die hard now that youre gone  
Hours that were yours echo like empty rooms  
Strange faces and your place cant keep away the gloom  
Old habits die hard now that youre gone
