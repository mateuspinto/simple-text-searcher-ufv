Shadow  
  
One two  
  
Yes you can take that to heart  
It was meant to sit close to the bone anyway  
You can make it a big issue  
Make it a battle of your own and thats ok  
  
You can feign a distant familiarity  
Say you understand the similarity  
Think you see me with great clarity  
But youre actually not necessarily  
  
Only if you steal my shadow will you truly know  
  
Yes you can call that a start  
It was meant to begin kind of slow anyway  
Yes your deceit is an art  
I knew you would sink kind of low anyway  
  
You say you have the best intentions  
You fill me with fickle suggestions  
Logic is fired by inventions  
But your concern is much more than you mention  
  
Only if you steal my shadow will you truly know  
  
You say youre in my situation  
You say youve been confused by my complication  
You think my soul makes negotiation  
But you dont see my hesitation  
  
Only if you steal my shadow will you truly know
