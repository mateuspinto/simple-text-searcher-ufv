Shake Shake  
  
Dont go  
I believe in a celebration  
I believe you set me free  
I believe you can loose this chains  
I believe you can dance with me  
Dance with me  
  
Shake Shake  
Shake Shake  
  
I believe in the third world war  
I believe in the atomic bomb  
I believe in the powers that be  
But they wont overpower me  
  
And and you can go there too  
And and you can go go go go  
  
Shake Shake  
Shake Shake  
  
And we dance out of time  
And everything goes round and round  
And we dont have the time  
To watch the world go tumbling down  
  
Go Go  
  
I believe in the bells of Christchurch  
Ringing for this land  
I believe in the cells of Mount joy  
Theres an honest man  
  
And and you can go there too  
And and you can go go go go  
  
I believe in the walls of Jericho  
I believe theyre coming down  
I believe in this citys children  
I believe the trumpets sound  
  
And you can go there too  
And you can go go go go  
  
I believe in what Im doing  
What am I doing here
