Shakin time she needs  
Taking rides to somewhere  
Lets lose our minds no hurry  
Im the wakeful night with dreams or something  
  
Chasing blue sky  
Were chasing blue sky  
  
Taking time from all this worry  
Mesmerized by the waves of your smile  
I wish that I could say something  
But youre the rose colored glass I see through  
Ill see you through  
  
Chasing blue sky  
Were chasing blue sky  
Chasing blue sky  
Were chasing blue sky  
  
Chasing blue sky  
Were chasing blue sky  
Chasing blue sky  
Were chasing blue sky
