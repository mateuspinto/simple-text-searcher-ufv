Your life broke through my night  
Restored exceeding joy  
Your praise fell like the rain  
And made this desert live  
repeat x 1  
You have turned my morning into dancing  
You have turned my sorrow into joy  
You have turned my morning into dancing  
You have turned my sorrow into joy  
Your hand lifted me up  
I stand on higher ground  
Your praise rose through my heart  
And made this valley sing  
You have turned my morning into dancing  
You have turned my sorrow into joy  
You have turned my morning into dancing  
You have turned my sorrow into joy  
This is how we overcome  
This is how we overcome  
This is how we overcome  
This is how we overcome  
repeat 2  
You have turned my morning into dancing  
You have turned my sorrow into joy  
You have turned my morning into dancing  
You have turned my sorrow into joy
