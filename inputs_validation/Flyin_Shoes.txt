Days full of rain  
Skys comin down again  
I get so tired  
Of these same old blues  
Same old song  
Baby it wont be long  
fore I be tyin on  
My flyin shoes  
Flyin shoes  
Till I be tyin on  
My flyin shoes  
Spring only sighed  
Summer had to be satisfied  
Fall is a feelin that I just cant lose  
Id like to stay  
Maybe watch a winter day  
Turn the green water  
To white and blue  
Flyin shoes  
Flyin shoes  
Till I be tyin on  
My flyin shoes  
The mountain moon  
Forever sets too soon  
Bein alone is all the hills can do  
Alone and then  
Her silver sails again  
And they will follow  
In their flyin shoes  
Flyin shoes  
They will follow in their  
Flyin shoes  
Days full of rain  
Skys comin down again  
I get so tired  
Of the same old blues  
Same old song  
Baby it wont be long  
Till I be tyin on  
My flyin shoes  
Flyin shoes  
Till I be tyin on  
My flyin shoes
