FloRida  
Gucci  
Bird  
  
I done bought all this Ciroc  
Now lil mama on my jock  
Staring at me up and down like when my roleys six oclock  
Now you know you better stop  
You done heard about my squad  
I am G poe boy  
You either uhh or you not  
Hold up shawty  
Wait a minute shawty why you came  
Who you know and who the hell told you to come  
All up in the middle with the business unofficial  
When I cant stand a chick tryna score my fun  
Looking for a dude to rip you off some   
I dont need a chick tryna throw my ones  
Let me look rich I wanna have his son  
I sip Perignon but do I look dumb  
Get a job shawty turn my knob  
And if it dont open up make sure you slob  
My boys  behind the bar  
Sit back blow smoke from a Cuban cigar  
Whats your mission  
Looks suspicious  
I dont get it  
No permission  
Back no interest  
Whats the business  
Shawty listen  
  
Im just tryna figure figure  
Why you up in here x3  
Im just tryna figure figure figure  
Why you up in here x2  
All up in my grill  
Why you dancing on me  
Steady talking to me  
When you know that youre not gonna give it to me  
Im just tryna figure figure figure  
Why you up in here x2  
All up in my grill  
  
Now I aint got no time for silly games  
Got no time for silly notions  
But get smacked silly for playing with my emotions  
You figured you lead me on  
But bitch you led me out the door  
Now let me lead you with a song  
It goes like D yous a hoe  
Drunk up all my conjour  
Aint even leave me with a glass  
So cough up my whole bottle  
Or Ima take out your ass  
Cos you dont wanna see me angry  
You dont like me when Im angry  
Live like Jackson 5  
But get greezy like Jermaine  
Be dangerous like Michael  
So Tito pass the tissues  
Dont test me cos I keep a clipper number two pistols  
And you will be erased  
Outta sight and outta mind  
So get the fuck on or my girls will wipe the floor with your behind  
  
Im just tryna figure figure  
Why you up in here x3  
Im just tryna figure figure figure  
Why you up in here x2  
All up in my grill  
Why you dancing on me  
Steady talking to me  
When you know that youre not gonna give it to me  
Im just tryna figure figure figure  
Why you up in here x2  
All up in my grill  
  
Im not even gonna bother listening to Gucci  
  
Im just tryna figure figure  
Why you up in here x3  
Im just tryna figure figure figure  
Why you up in here x2  
All up in my grill  
Why you dancing on me  
Steady talking to me  
When you know that youre not gonna give it to me  
Im just tryna figure figure figure  
Why you up in here x2  
All up in my grill
