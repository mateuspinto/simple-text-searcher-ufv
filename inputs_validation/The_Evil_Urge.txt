And I see that slowly your tears are drying  
And I see an ocean made by your crying  
And the ocean thats within  
  
And I see misery to forget it I must  
And all of the memories are lost  
And the ocean is here within me  
Flows on like an ever tear  
  
In us all there are two separate sides  
That which is evil and that which is good  
Some people live by one side and others by the second  
Both of them have a little bit of the other  
But it must remain clear that the two depend on each other  
Remember evil is a part of the good and not the opposite  
There is no sadness without joy and there is no joy without pain  
There is no holy without impure and there can be no blasphemy without
holyness  
Thus the two sides must live in harmony  
Unbalanced forever the evil urge brought lots of pain  
It is so hard to defeat it  
The evil urge sometimes arrives with heavy boots  
And sometimes in gentle cats steps  
And even through blessed deeds it can drive you into deeds of wrong  
A here is the one which concurs his urge  
And so we must wonder what shall be the faith of the man who destroys one  
And embraces the other  
  
The storm still rages
