Whats hannin

But she aint right ya know  
What Im talkin bout  
Take one take one  
Ooh Gucci

What I mean for real  
Okay action goin in

We used to be good friends now she cant stand me  
Her man aint G her man  
Aint me her man cant be what her man cant be  
My jewelery game fridgy white watch blizzard  
Crocodile lizard pinky ring ignorant  
Im careful who I step too when I step too  
And if I choose first she choose me then she special  
Long walks all night dog I can help her bless her  
Show her how to be successful kiss her Gucci her up finesse her  
Sudden valley cook up second of the extra  
Stack up loud pack make her catch a contact  
Dumb sets long stacks I can make her come back  
  
Chorus  
I can do bad bad bad bad bad all by myself  
I can do bad bad bad bad bad all by myself  
I can do bad bad bad bad bad all by myself  
I can do bad bad bad bad bad all by myself  
  
Im a bad boy but still theres so much good in me  
You can take me out the hood the hood is still in me  
I needa girl to feel herself but can still feel me  
Just let me be ya only choice no need for plan B  
My love life is malnutritions you my vitamin C  
Stay down like Hillary and I can be ya billy  
Ill buy ya jada pinky pinkies Im the biggest willy  
Just when I give it throw it back just like we playin Frisby  
I can do it by myself but Id be very lonely  
Be the diva whos my lover and my closest homie  
So if you sick and tired of bein sick and tired call me  
Pick up the yellow pages and look up Gucci Gucci  
  
Chorus  
  
Aint no need in arguin about it  
If you wanna leave then just be bout it  
Theres no sense in blamin me and me blamin you  
Theres no reason to be untrue everything  
I got I work hard for everyday I work hard to  
Make more I can do bad all by myself  
I aint tryna play love games cause I can do bad baby  
  
Chorus
