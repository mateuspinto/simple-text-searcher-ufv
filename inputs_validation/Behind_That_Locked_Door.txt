Harrison  
Why are you still crying  
Your pain is now through  
Please forget those teardrops  
Let me take them from you  
The love you are blessed with  
This worlds waiting for  
So let out your heart please please  
From behind that locked door  
Its time we start smiling  
What else should we do  
With only this short time  
I know to be here with you  
And the tales you have taught me  
From the things that you saw  
Makes me want out your heart please please  
From behind that locked door  
And wherever my love goes  
If Im rich or Im poor  
Please let out my heart please please  
From behind that locked door  
From behind that locked door
