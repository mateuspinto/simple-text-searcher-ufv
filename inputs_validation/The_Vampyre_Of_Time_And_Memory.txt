I want God to come and take me home  
Cause Im all alone in this crowd  
Who are you to me Who am I supposed to be  
Not exactly sure anymore  
Wheres this going to Can I follow through  
Or just follow you for a while  
  
Does anyone ever get this right  
I feel no love  
  
Aint no confusion here it is as I feared  
The illusion that you feel is real  
To be vulnerable is needed most of all  
If you intend to truly fall apart  
  
You think the worst of all is far behind  
The vampire of time and memories has died  
I survived I speak I breathe  
Im incomplete  
Im alive  hooray  
Youre wrong again  
Cause I feel no love  
  
Does anyone ever get this right  
  
Does anyone ever get this right  
I feel no love I feel no love
