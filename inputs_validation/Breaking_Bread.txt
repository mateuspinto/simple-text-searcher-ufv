Breaking bread breaking bread  
We are gathered here together to break bread  
Breaking bread breaking bread  
We are gathered here together to break bread  
Its not the barley or the wheat  
Its not the oven or the heat  
That makes this bread so good to eat  
Its the needing and the sharing that makes the meal complete  
Breaking bread breaking bread  
We are gathered here together to break bread  
Breaking bread breaking bread  
We are gathered here together to break bread  
Upon the water prayed his cast  
The last is first the first is last  
For everyone who eats this bread  
There are thousands maybe more that will be fed  
Breaking bread breaking bread  
We are gathered here together to break bread  
Breaking bread breaking bread  
We are gathered here together to break bread  
Breaking bread breaking bread  
We are gathered here together to break bread
