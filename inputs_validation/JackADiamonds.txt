Jack a diamond jack a diamond take my money you can have my life of luxury  
You can have my precious silver studded saddle oh Lord  
But you cannot take my soul cannot take my soul today  
Sweet momma oh sweet momma wont you say you love me  
Let me hold you hold you in my arms  
Please tell me Im not really falling to pieces  
Keep me tender mama tender now keep me warm  
Jack a diamond jack a diamond I still got my ace yeah  
If you want me to do it I can throw it right in your face  
Go and take my precious silver studded saddle yeah  
But you cannot take my soul Lord you cannot take my soul today  
Jack a diamond jack a diamond gonna be alright
