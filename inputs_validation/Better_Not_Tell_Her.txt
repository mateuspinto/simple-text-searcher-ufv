Better not tell her that I was your lover  
Better not make her jealous of me  
Better convince her there was nothing between us  
Im not those initials in your diary  
But if you slip and my name comes up  
Dont deny that you knew me  
Just leave out the white nights  
The moon in your window  
The break in your whisper  
The promises after  
  
Better not tell her why you love Spanish dancing  
Dont bother to say that its hot in the summer in Madrid  
Let it all go now Like smoke from a candle  
Like the trace of a song that you hear in the wind  
But if you slip and my name comes up  
Dont deny that you knew me  
Just leave out the white nights  
The moon in your window  
The break in your whisper  
The promises after  
Leave out the tears and the laughter  
She wont need to know  
That I cried when you left  
That I think of you still  
  
But if you slip and my name comes up  
Dont deny that you knew me  
Just leave out the white nights  
The moon in your window  
The break in your whisper  
The promises after  
Leave out the tears and the laughter  
She wont need to know  
That Id die for your love  
That I still love you
