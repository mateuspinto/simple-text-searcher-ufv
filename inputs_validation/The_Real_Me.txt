I know a girl who welcomes the world  
I think though the world is spoiled  
And she holds on to me  
She holds my head up so that I can breathe  
And Ive found that when Im on the ground  
Shes the only one still sticking around  
Only she knows the real me  
And I know that she wont let me down  
And I get mine  
  
No way I could ever leave today  
Cause she listens to the dumb things that I say  
And I seem to get high  
With just one smile as she walks on by  
And I found that when Im on the ground  
She is the only one sticking around  
Only she knows the real me  
And I know that she wont let me down  
  
Chorus  
Theres only one girl in this world  
Who understands the real me  
Theres nothing superficial artificial  
You get just what you seeEnd  
  
I know a girl who takes up my world  
Takes all of me and every breath that I hold  
We meet and she makes me feel free  
With one look she knows just what I need  
And Ive found that shes got me bound  
Cause shes the only one that my mind surrounds  
Only she knows the real me  
And I know that she wont let me down  
  
Chorus x2  
  
I know a girl who wakes up my world  
Brings in the warmth when Im feeling cold  
And shes got places to be  
But she says that she would rather stay here with me  
And Ive found that when Im on the ground  
Shes the only one sticking around  
Only she knows the real me  
And I know that she wont let me down  
  
Chorus x2
