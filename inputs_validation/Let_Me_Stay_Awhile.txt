Can I stay with you awhile right awhile behind your smile  
You dont have to say the things you used to say  
Just let me sleep here for a time in the want of your loving mind  
And tomorrow Ill be on my way  
Just hold me in the want of your gentle smile  
Just tonight hon with you then Ill be going on my way  
Just hide me till I have I have the strength to go  
For now all I want to know is morning by your side  
Let me stay with you awhile right awhile behind your smile  
You dont have to say the things you used to say  
Just let me sleep here for a time in the want of your loving mind  
Awhile till I find the strength to go
