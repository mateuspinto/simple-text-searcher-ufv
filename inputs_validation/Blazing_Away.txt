So searching down and out looking for a place to stay  
A place of no commitment a place with no involvement  
I got one eye on insanity the other on the wheel  
Ones turning ones burning blazing away  
Ones turning ones burning blazing away  
  
Strangelooking exile with a passion for the dangerous  
An eye for the wicked a tongue for the nasty  
I got one eye on insanity the other on the wheel  
Ones turning ones burning blazing away  
Ones turning ones burning blazing away  
  
What is the reason that things change  
What is the reason they can never stay the same  
What can I do what can I do  
Feel it release it things change  
  
Feel it release it things change  
Feel it release it things change  
  
What is the reason that things change  
What is the reason they can never stay the same  
What can I do what can I do  
Feel it release it things change  
  
Feel it release it things change  
Feel it release it things change  
  
So searching down and out looking for a place to stay  
A place of no commitment a place with no involvement  
I got one eye on insanity the other on the wheel  
Ones turning ones burning blazing away  
Ones turning ones burning blazing away
