Lil Wayne talking

Chorus  
Young mony is the label  
Let us in the door comin in this bitch all red to the floor  
And Im blooded soowoo and Im blooded soowoo

Fuck with my bloods got blood on your cloths  
And Im blooded soooowooo 2  
  
Once again its on yea Im back in the booth  
Stand at the top like a tac in the roof  
Still on these hoes like a mack in a suit  
Still on my toes not a crack in my shoe  
Rappers talkin about me but I dont give a hoot  
These niggas still lyin Im the muthafukin truth  
Talk tough till I knock off your kuff  
And I own my team Im like a Maloof  
They hatin on me Im just tryin to be weezy  
Just like young jeezy in lambobingghini  
Smoked out my mind baby and now Im seein threebies  
Dope boy fresh from my fitted to my dc  
All red so these hoes know who we be

Pop pop flow yea yall niggas sweet peas  
Gettin high on a yacht call it see me  
  
Chorus  
  
Yea I advance my flow and they must like that  
They like it so much they say they wright that  
Barkin at the dog but I dont bite back  
I aint cpr I aint bringin they life back  
Bad cpr bad bitch on a bite back  
Skittles on my wrist yea nigga the bright pack  
Ima shine I live witha light hat  
Airforce fly call me a night jet  
Brand new coupe same color as the sky  
The dash same too lord know Im gon try  
Cop pull me over lord know Im gon lie  
They go up in my trunk lord know Im gon fry  
Them niggas throwin salt all over my fries  
So ima just walk all over them guys  
Niggas throwin darts never hit the bullseye  
Young money bitch new orleans east side  
  
Chorus  
  
Yea been around the world rep the same thang  
Been around the world its the same gang  
Bs up Bs up flame gang braa braa braaa braaa bang bang  
I tol my homie streets cant sleep on life  
So he popped the X pill and didnt sleep all night  
I aint worried bout you Im just tryin do me  
Last album did 2 Im just tryin do 3  
I am what every pair of eyes oughta see  
Bitches just wish they could call a art of me  
My momma used to tell me just get a 9 to 5  
Cash money made her say never mind Im fine  
Bs up  
  
Chorus
