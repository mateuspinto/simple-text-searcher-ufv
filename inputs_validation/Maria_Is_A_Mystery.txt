Maria has a music box she winds up most every day  
Once a week is all it takes to make the music play  
Melody is just some childhood lullaby her mother used to sing to her  
And the road down to the city goes right by Marias door  
I often walk right by her house on my way to the store  
Up there where those Italian mothers dress their shivering bambinos for the
rain  
She tells me about Jesus and all his gallant men I tell her about fantasy  
Maria shes this lady on my way down to the river Maria shes a mystery  
Maria shes a mystery  
  
Yeah passing by this morning I drew a picture in my hand  
Our bodies in some candlelight that glowed upon our skin  
Maybe if I touched her she would disappear like angels in a dream  
She tells me about Jesus  
La la la la la la
