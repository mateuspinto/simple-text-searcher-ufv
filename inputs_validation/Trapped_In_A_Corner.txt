I want to watch you drown in your lies  
The end of your masquerade a matter of time  
Interwining lies domination control  
Feed his twisted nature  
It is sickening to see dreams die  
A word of advice fates patience is growning short  
Fake down to your mind and appearance  
You will fall short of the dreams to destroy  
In time you will find yourself trapped in a corner  
These four words my friend I promise you will not forget  
  
I am one of many that see through your lies  
Hiding will do you no good many seek revenge  
Soon to become a victim of what you live to create and cannot have  
It is sickening to see dreams die  
A word of advice fates patience is growning short  
Fake down to your mind and appearance  
You will fall short of the dreams to destroy
