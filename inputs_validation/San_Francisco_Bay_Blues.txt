Got the blues from my baby  
Left me by the san francisco bay  
This big ocean liner took her so far away  
Didnt mean to treat her so bad  
She was the best girl I ever have had  
She said goodbye and she made me cry  
Im gonna lay right down and die  
Well I aint got a nickel and I aint got a lousy dime  
If she dont come back I think Im gonna lose my mind  
If she ever comes back to stay  
Well thatll be another brand new day  
Walking with my baby down by the san francisco bay  
Sittin in my back door  
Wondering which way to go  
That woman Im so crazy about  
She dont love me no more  
Lord I think Ill grab a freight train  
Because Im feeling blue  
Ride all the way to the end of the line  
Thinking only about you  
Well meanwhile in another city  
Just about to go insane  
Thought I heard my baby  
The way she used called my name  
If she ever comin back to stay  
Well thatll be another brand new day  
Walking with my baby down by the san francisco bay  
I really mean it  
Oh walking with my baby down by the san francisco bay whew
