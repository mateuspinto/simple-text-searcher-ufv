We are still all right  
We took it on the chin  
But in the thirteenth hour  
No one ever wins  
  
But were strong enough  
Like traffic all tied up  
And when the static clears  
The radios still buzz  
  
And I stop and I breathe  
Cause you wanted me  
And I wanted you so bad  
And I stop and I breathe  
Cause I still believe  
No one really knows what it is that we have  
  
Like blood in a vein  
We chased this one down  
And in the darkest long night  
We turned it all around  
  
And it was coaldusted snow  
That covered the fields  
But the corn it still grew  
And the injury healed  
  
And I stop and I breathe  
Cause you wanted me  
And I wanted you so bad  
And I stop and I breathe  
Cause I still believe  
No one really knows what it is that we have  
  
And I stop and I breathe  
Cause you wanted me  
And I wanted you so bad  
And I stop and I breathe  
Cause I still believe  
No one really knows what it is that we have
