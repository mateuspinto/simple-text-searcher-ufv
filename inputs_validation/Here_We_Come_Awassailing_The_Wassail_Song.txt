Here we come awassailing  
Among the leaves so green  
Here we come awandring  
So fair to be seen  
Love and joy come to you  
And to you your wassail too  
And God bless you and send you  
A Happy New Year  
And God send you a Happy New Year  
  
We are not daily beggers  
That beg from door to door  
But we are neighbors children  
Whom you have seen before  
Love and joy come to you  
And to you your wassail too  
And God bless you and send you  
A Happy New Year  
And God send you a Happy New Year  
  
Good master and good mistress  
As you sit beside the fire  
Pray think of us poor children  
Who wander in the mire  
Love and joy come to you  
And to you your wassail too  
And God bless you and send you  
A Happy New Year  
And God send you a Happy New Year  
  
We have a little purse  
Made of ratching leather skin
