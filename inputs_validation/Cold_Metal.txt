I played tag in the auto graveyard  
I looked up at the radio tower  
Rag tent by the railroad tracks  
Concrete poured over steel bridge  
Pondered my fate  
While they built the interstate  
  
Im a product of America  
From the morgue to the prisons  
Cold metal when I start my band  
Cold metal in my garbage can  
Cold metal gets in my blood  
And my attitude  
  
Yeah a huh  
  
Threw my hide in an automobile  
Heard a song called Drive the wheel  
Truckers trailers tractors caught me workin  
  
This is the song of my heritage  
From the bad to the Buddha  
Cold metal thats what it be  
Cold metal from sea to sea  
Cold metal its how we win  
And also how we sin  
How we sin how we sin how we sin how we sin  
  
Cold metal in the afternoon  
Sounds lovely like a Hendrix tune  
Cold metal its the father of beat  
The mother of the street  
Cold metal it rolls on by  
Cold metal gonna raise it high  
Cold metal itll even fly  
Rust buckets in the sky  
Cold metal got to be  
Skeleton of the free  
Cold metal its gotta be  
Better save a tree  
Save a tree save a tree save a tree save a tree  
Yeah
