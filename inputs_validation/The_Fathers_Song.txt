I have heard so many songs  
Listened to a thousand tongues  
But there is one  
That sounds above them all  
The Fathers song  
The Fathers love  
You sung it over me and for eternity  
Its written on my heart  
Chorus  
Heavens perfect melody  
The Creators symphony  
You are singing over me  
The Fathers song  
Heavens perfect mystery  
The king of love has sent for me  
And now youre singing over me  
The Fathers song  
I have heard so many songs  
Listened to a thousand tongues  
But there is one  
That sounds above them all  
Sounds above them all  
The Fathers song  
The Fathers love  
You sung it over me and for eternity  
Its written on my heart  
Chorus  
Its Heavens perfect mystery  
The king of love has sent for me  
And now youre singing over me  
The Fathers song  
The Fathers song  
The Fathers love  
You sung it over me and for eternity  
Its written on my heart  
Its written on my heart  
The Fathers song  
The Fathers love  
You sung it over me and for eternity  
Its written on my heart  
Its written on my heart  
You sing it over me  
Father
