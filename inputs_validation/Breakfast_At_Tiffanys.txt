Youll say weve got nothing in common  
No common ground to start from  
And were falling apart  
Youll say the world has come between us  
Our lives have come between us  
Still I know you just dont care  
  
And I said What about Breakfast at Tiffanys  
She said I think I remember the film  
And as I recall I think we both kind of liked it   
And I said Well thats the one thing weve got  
  
I see you the only one who knew me  
And now your eyes see through me  
I guess I was wrong  
So what now Its plain to see were over  
And I hate when things are over  
When so much is left undone  
  
And I said What about Breakfast at Tiffanys  
She said I think I remember that film  
And as I recall I think we both kind of liked it   
And I said Well thats the one thing we got
