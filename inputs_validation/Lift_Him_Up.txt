Oh Lord Oh Lord we lift you ooh we lift you up yeah yeah yeah  
  
Raise my voice in testimony  
Cause hes more than a friend to me  
Gave my heart cause I believe hes the almighty  
I can look at my life and see all the things that  
Hes done to set me free protecting me from harm  
Raise my hands to show how I feel

Till hes guiding me Ill be still  
Cause Id be lost without him  
My heart and soul I dedicate and to show I appreciate his love  
Ill give him praise
