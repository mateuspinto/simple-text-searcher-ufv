Holy Holy  
I will bow before  
My Lord and King  
Hallelujah  
You have come to us  
You make all things new  
  
Emmanuel  
Jesus Christ  
Youll never let me go  
My Shepherd King  
Youll never let me go  
My Sheperd King  
Youre watching over me  
Emmanuel  
  
So amazing  
You have named the stars  
Of the deepest night  
Still You love me  
You have called my name  
I will follow You  
  
Holy Holy  
God Almighty  
There is none like You  
Holy Holy  
God Almighty  
There is none like You
