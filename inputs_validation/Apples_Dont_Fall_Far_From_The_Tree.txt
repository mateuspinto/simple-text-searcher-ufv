Apples donT fall far from the tree  
Writer Bob Stone  
  
When I was five  
I put on Mamas high heel shoes  
And paint my face  
And dance across the living room  
In Rubys place  
Well the music was always playing  
Girls laugh while the men were sayin  
  
Chorus  
  
Apples dont fall far from the tree  
Hey honey come sit on my knee  
Apples dont fall far from the tree  
And I remember Mamas tears  
When they said in a few years  
Id be something to see  
  
At seventeen I had me a diamond  
And a string of pearls  
The men said they preffered me  
To the other girls  
They took me to the best places  
But I could read it on their faces  
  
Chorus  
  
Then when Mama died I made up my mind  
To get on a Greyhound get out of this town  
And leave it all behind  
  
But life goes on  
A child of three smiles up at me  
While she plays  
The man I love has never heard of Rubys Place  
When he holds her with affection  
And he uses that old expression  
  
Chorus
