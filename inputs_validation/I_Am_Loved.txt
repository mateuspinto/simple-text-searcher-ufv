I am loved I am loved by the one I love in every way  
I am loved absolutely loved  
What a wonderful thing to be able to say  
  
Im adored Im adored by the one  
who first led my heart astray  
Im adored absolutely adored  
What a wonderful thing to be able to say  
  
So ring out the bells and let the trumpets blow  
And beat on the drums for now I know I know  
I am loved I am loved  
What a wonderful thing what a glorious thing  
What a beautiful thing to be able to say  
  
So ring out the bells and let the trumpets blow  
And beat on the drums for now I know I know  
I am loved I am loved  
What a wonderful thing what a glorious thing  
What a beautiful thing what a marvelous thing  
What if happy to sing what a crazy thing  
What a lovely thing what a precious thing  
To be able to say
