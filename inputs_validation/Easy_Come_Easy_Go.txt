Easy come easy go  
Here there everywhere crazy love is in the air  
Nightfall mmm day and nightfall  
So many girls in every port  
You gotta be a juggernaut  
Full speed ahead or youll be caught  
Oh yeah Oh yeah  
  
Easy come easy go  
Up down all around kiss and kiss  
And pound for pound delicious  
Mmm so nutritious  
Sailor beware take it slow  
Easy come easy go  
  
All right  
When you want love to keep you warm  
Theres nothing like a uniform  
You got a port in any storm  
There she blows  
  
Easy come easy go  
Up down all around kiss and kiss  
And pound for pound delicious  
Mmm so nutritious  
Sailor beware take it slow  
Easy come easy go  
Sailor beware take it slow  
Easy come easy go  
Easy come easy go
