You struck me like lightning  
Turned my world upside down  
When I first laid my eyes on you  
  
This feelings really frightening  
cause it seems to me Ive found  
The perfect man of all for me to choose  
Used to a dream of such a man like you  
Never thought it would come true  
Boy you are the answer to my prayers  
  
I never felt like this before and  
You have opened up the door  
Into a space that I would never dare  
  
cause you give my a meaning  
And this love we hare together  
Is lifting my heart to a higher ground  
I was searching seeking finding  
Love came out from its hiding  
And baby I so pleased at what I found  
  
The way you seem to be the only one for me  
This love is truly special were 2 of a kind  
Ive got you on my mind were 2 of a kind  
  
This heart is beating inside my chest  
And baby its you that I adore  
The nights we spend together are by far the best  
That any woman could be wishing for  
Were lucky baby its like that  
This aint no opposites attract  
You make up for all the bad in me  
  
So when days of trouble come around  
You know I never let you down  
Right by your side is where I want to be  
  
cause you give my life a meaning  
And this love we have together  
Is lifting my heart to higher ground  
I was searching seeking finding  
Love came out from its hiding  
  
The way you seem to be the only one for me  
This love is truly special were 2 of a kind  
Ive got you on my mind were 2 of a kind
