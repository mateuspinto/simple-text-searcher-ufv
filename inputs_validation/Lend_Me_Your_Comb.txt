Lend me your comb  
Its time to go home  
I got to go past  
My hair is a mess  
  
Your mammie will scold  
Your pappie will shout  
Unless we come in  
The way we went out  
  
Kissing you was fun honey  
But thanks for the date  
But I must come to run honey  
But you know baby its getting late  
  
Just wait till I say  
My darling  
Lend me your comb  
We got to go home  
Kissing you was fun honey  
  
But thanks for the date  
But I must come to run honey  
But sugar its getting late  
  
Just wait till I  
Say my darling  
Lend me your comb  
We got to go home
