When every song is sung  
When every bells been rung  
When every pictures hung up  
Ill still love you  
  
When every wind has blown  
When every seed is sown  
When everything is known  
Then Ill still love you  
  
You know Ill love you yes I will  
You know that Ill love you  
Love you love you yes I will  
  
You know I love you yes I do  
When times get too hard  
You know Ill be there loving you  
  
When every soul is free  
When every eye can see  
When people all agree  
Then Ill still love you
