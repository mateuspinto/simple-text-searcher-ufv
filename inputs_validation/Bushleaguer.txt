lies lies lies lies lies  
lies lies lies lies lies  
How does he do it How do they do it uncanny and immutable  
This is such a happening tailpipe of a party  
Like sugar the guests are so refined  
A confidence man but why so beleaguered  
Hes not a leader hes a Texas leaguer  
Swinging for the fence got lucky with a strike  
Drilling for fear makes the job simple  
Born on third thinks he got a triple  
Blackout weaves its way through the city  
Blackout weaves its way through the city  
Blackout weaves its way  
I remember when you sang that song about today  
Now its tomorrow and everything has changed  
A think tank of aloof multiplication  
A nicotine wish and a Columbus decanter  
Retrenchment and hoggishness  
The aristocrat choir sings whats the ruckus  
The haves have not a clue  
The immenseness of suffering  
And the odd negotiation a rarity  
With onionskin plausibility of life  
And a keyboard reaffirmation  
Blackout weaves its way through the city  
Blackout weaves its way through the city  
Blackout weaves its way  
I remember when you sang that song about today  
Now its tomorrow and everything has changed  
I remember when you sang that song about today  
Now its tomorrow and everything has changed  
Changed changed chains etc
