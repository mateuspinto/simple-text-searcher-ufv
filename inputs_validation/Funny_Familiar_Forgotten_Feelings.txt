Last night quietly she walked through my mind  
As I lay searching for sleep  
Her soft hand reached out she whispered my name  
As she brushed a tear from my cheek  
  
And then those funny familiar forgotten feelings  
Started walkin all over my mind  
Its sad so sad to watch love go bad  
But a true love would not have gone wrong  
  
Im just thankful for the good times weve had  
For without them I could not go on  
With all these funny familiar forgotten feelings  
Walkin all over my mind  
  
I must go on be strong  
Tho a million teardrops may fall  
Before these funny familiar forgotten feelings  
Stop walk all over my mind
