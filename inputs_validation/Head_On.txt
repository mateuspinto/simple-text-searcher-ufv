Whats the sense of running blind  
If you never know where you go  
Whats the sense of a suicide  
If the crash is all you know  
Im a right down lower than the low  
Collecting other peoples sins  
Whats the sense if you got to go  
If you dont know where you been  
A classic indication march out of time  
A standard application youre not the kind  
Im coming  
Blessed retribution head on never stall  
Running head on to the wall  
Unholy damn solution head on never fall  
Running head on to the wall  
All the promises that you made  
Made you right with what you did  
All the freedoms that you trade  
On the block for the highest bid  
Im an up here higher than high sight  
On a selfinflicted grin  
With a back door larger than life light  
So you can see where you been  
A classic indication march out of time  
A standard application youre not the kind  
Im coming  
Blessed retribution head on never stall  
Running head on to the wall  
Unholy damn solution head on never fall  
Running head on to the wall  
cmon now baby shine a light on me  
Can you see me just a little bit  
Cleanse you of the sorrow and your misery  
Wash away the pain with a hit  
Tell me what youre waiting for  
cmon little lazy take a walk with me  
Will you reach out will you take my hand  
Cmon little lazy will you let it be  
Or will you walk to the promised land  
Tell me what youre waiting for  
cmon now baby shine the light on me  
Can you use me just a little bit  
Cmon little lazy will you walk with me  
Well wash away the pain and the shit  
Blessed retribution head on never stall  
Running head on to the wall  
Unholy damn solution head on never fall  
Running head on to the wall
