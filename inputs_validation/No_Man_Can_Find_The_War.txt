Photographs of guns and flame  
Scarlet skull and distant game  
Bayonet and jungle grin  
Nightmares dreamed by bleeding men  
Lookouts tremble on the shore  
But no man can find the war  
  
Tape recorders echo scream  
Orders fly like bullet stream  
Drums and cannons laugh aloud  
Whistles come from ashen shroud  
Leaders damn the world and roar  
But no man can find the war  
  
Is the war across the sea  
Is the war behind the sky  
Have you each and all gone blind  
Is the war inside your mind  
  
Humans weep at human death  
All the talkers lose their breath  
Movies paint a chaos tale  
Singers see and poets wail  
All the world kows the score  
But no man can find the war
