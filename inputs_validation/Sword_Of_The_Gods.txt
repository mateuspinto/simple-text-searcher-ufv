ENDYAMON  
THE SWORD to I take to the Air Fear breaks the will of denial  
You look for me there hunting the  
Skies I am soundless I fly to the Rainbow I Conquer the Sky  
The Hammer of Death  
  
THE SWORD OF THE GODS  
Grant every Wish of Blood that calls to Blood I rise on the Air  
I rise on the Sea  
Smashing the chains of denial for me  
THE SWORD OF THE GODS   
You look for a Sign nothing will reveal the Hour  
The Burning of Rome was only a glimpse of my Power  
My Armor is Flame Gold I sever the Sky  
The Hammer of Death  
  
THE SWORD OF THE GODS  
Grant every Wish of Blood that calls to Blood I rise on the Air  
I rise on the Sea  
Smashing with Flame your denial for me  
THE SWORD OF THE GODS   
Watching your children die  
Your fist to the Gods you cry   
Why must it be why am I damned Forsaken  
I have always served your Shrines and Alters  
Now Ill see you burn   
  
ENDYAMON  
Why must this come to pass Gods of the Heavens vast  
await the Night you die Now     
THE SWORD OF THE GODS     
Rise     
Cold yet Burning calm yet so murderous  
We rise like Mist from the Earth As Above so it shall be Below  
We invoke Death with one Final Prayer  
Pain is the Sign  
Where I will find the only shred of Magick that wont be left behind  
I take to the Air  
Fear rips the Temples of Power  
My Law is despair a Vision of Flame I am blinding  
My Sword is the Rainbow I sever the Sky  
  
THE SWORD  
The Hammer of Death  
THE SWORD OF THE GODS  
I am the Wish of Blood that calls to Blood I rise on the Air  
I rise on the Sea  
Smashing the Flames of denial for me  
THE SWORD OF THE GODS   
  
ENDYAMON  
The Blood of Man is the Blood of Vengeance         
THE SWORD OF THE GODS     
Die     
Down    
Die
