This nights gone were moving on  
Highways calling aloud  
I bring them in with eyes of sin  
Its a down drinkin freaky crowd  
Chew you up and spit you out  
Never want to know your name  
Dont want to know you but I sure want to show you  
Never will forget I came  
On the worlds all mine  
White lightning and wine came on so fast  
When did I last feel this fine  
White lightning and wine  
Sweet little one let me love you some  
Take me or leave me alone  
The gooder they come the harder they fall  
Turn around you are a nasty joke  
Yeah we all laugh oh hah what a gas  
Watching you chew on the bones  
In the morning light you didnt look so nice  
Guess youd better hitch hike home
