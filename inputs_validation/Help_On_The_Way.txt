Paradise waits  
On the crest of a wave  
Her angels in flame  
She has no pain  
Like a child she is pure  
She is not to blame  
  
Poised for flight  
Wings spread bright  
Spring from night  
Into the sun  
Dont stop to run  
She can fly like a lie  
She cannot be outdone  
  
Tell me the cost  
I can pay  
Let me go  
Tell me love is not lost  
Sell everything  
Without love day to day  
Insanity is king  
  
I will pay  
Day by day  
Anyway  
Lock bolt and key  
Crippled but free  
I was blind  
All the time  
I was learning to see  
  
Help on the way  
I know only this  
Ive got you today  
Dont fly away  
Cause I love what I love  
And I want it that way  
  
I will stay  
One more day  
Like I say  
Honey its you  
Without love in the dream  
It will never come true
