I know I know the sun is hot  
Mosquitos come suck your blood  
Leave you there all alone  
Just skin and bone  
  
When you walk among the trees  
Listening to the leaves  
The further I go the less I know  
The less I know  
  
Where will you run  
Where will you hide  
Lullabies  
To paralyze  
  
Fat and soft pink and weak  
Foot and thigh tongue and cheek  
You know Im told they swallow you whole  
Skin and bone  
  
Cutting boards and hanging hooks  
Bloody knives cooking books  
Promising you wont feel a thing  
At all  
  
Swallow and chew  
Eat you alive  
All of us food that hasnt died  
And the light says  
  
Somehow they pick and pluck  
Tenderize bone to dust  
The sweetest grease finest meat youll ever taste  
Taste taste  
So you scream whine and yell  
Supple sounds of dinner bells  
We all will feed the worms and trees So dont be shy  
  
Swallow and chew  
Eat you alive  
All of us food that hasnt died
