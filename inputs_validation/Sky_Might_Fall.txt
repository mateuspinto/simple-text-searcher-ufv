What a world that Im livin in  
Will the rainstorms ever end  
Still I feel my path narrow I run again  
See happiness is gone again  
  
And then you see em gray clouds up above man  
Metaphor to my life man  
Still I feel my heart stronger then its ever been  
Strong will to my journey ends  
  
Til then I roll more then Ive ever rolled  
Not pills but the marioll  
Still I feel my eyes heavy when the days go  
Nothing helping with my head dose  
  
But I aint sleepin awake in another state  
Livin in a new space  
Still I feel my mind runnin at a steady pace  
God help me so Ill win the race  
  
Til then I call  
The sky might fall the sky might fall  
But Im not worried at all  
Come on come on  
The sky might fall the sky might fall  
But Im not worried at all  
  
Hey hey I let em know some  
I let em know some I let em know some  
You can listen up listen up listen up listen up  
Hey I let em know some  
I let em know some I let em know some  
You can listen up listen up listen up listen up  
  
Grey clouds took together fam  
Lining piercing to another land  
Over the desert wit the lost play  
Soul searching each in every way  
  
An then you see the  
Awesome sounds so profound within itll grip you  
You can see it if you hear you can feel it too  
Somethin special I am runnin to  
  
Til then I go away very far away  
To another universe where all people say  
Its a new new place for the special to embrace  
Like a Martian you seein it wandered out the place  
  
Take what you need from the valley of the hopeful  
Even if you dry youll be floatin high above it  
You can say bye bye bye  
Sky might be fallin but remember you can fly high  
  
The sky might fall the sky might fall  
But Im not worried at all  
Come on come on  
The sky might fall the sky might fall  
But Im not worried at all  
  
Hey hey I let em know some  
I let em know some I let em know some  
You can listen up listen up listen up listen up  
Hey I let em know some  
I let em know some I let em know some  
You can listen up listen up listen up listen up
