Last night when we were young  
Love was a star a song unsung  
Life was so new so real  
So bright ages ago last night  
  
Today the world is old  
You flew away and time grew cold  
Where is that star  
That seems so bright  
Ages ago last night  
  
To think that spring had depended  
On merely this a look a kiss  
To think that something so splendid  
Could slip away in one little daybreak  
So now lets reminisce and recollect  
The size of the kisses  
The arms that clung  
When we were young last night  
  
So now lets reminisce and recollect  
The size of the kisses  
The arms that clung  
When we were young last night  
Last night oooooh last night ooooooh last night
