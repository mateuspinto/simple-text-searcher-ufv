It was a Friday in April 1986  
The day that nightmare begun  
When the dust it fell down on our buildings and streets  
And entered our buildings at noon  
Touched the grass and trees bicycyles cars  
Beds books and picture frames too  
We stood around helpless confused  
Nobody knew what to do  
At two oclock on Sunday the buses arrived  
A fleet of a thousand or more  
We were ordered to be on our way  
Not knowing what lay in store  
Some of our citizens fled in dismay  
And looked for a good place to hide  
When four oclock came and the last bus pulled out  
Twas the day that our lively town died  
Chorus  
And the shirts sheets and hankerchiefs cracks in the wind  
On the window ledge the withering plants  
And the Ladas and Volgas are parked by the door  
And the bikes in its usual stance  
Our evergreen tree lies withered and drooped  
Theyve poisoned our fertile land  
The streets speak a deafening silence  
Nothing stirs but the sand  
A visit back home is so eerie today  
A modern Pompei in view  
To see all the old shops ond the Forest Hotel  
And the Promyet cinema too  
The momentos we gathered all left behind  
Our photos and letters and cards  
The toys of our children untouchable now  
Toy Soldiers left standing on guard  
So fare thee well Pripchat my home and my soul  
Your sorrow can know no relief  
A terrifying glimpse of the future you show  
Your children all scattered like geese  
The clothes lines still sways but the owners long gone  
As the nomadic era returns  
The questions in black and white blurred into grey  
The answer is too easy to learn  
Chorus  
Chorus
