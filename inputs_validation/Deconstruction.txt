One after the other  
The banished ones fled as they watched from  
The distance the destruction of the digital garden  
  
With no more fruit to bear from its trees  
The haze was finally broken  
  
With the rains came the awareness that never again  
Would anyone ever lay claim to the treasures of the Rainbow Children  
  
As though awakened from a dream  
The muse opened her eyes This time as queen
