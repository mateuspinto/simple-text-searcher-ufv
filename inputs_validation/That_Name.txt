There is a name that is so precious  
a name so wonderful to me  
This name is worthy of all praises  
Because of him I am made free  
That name is Jesus oh how I love him  
The one who gave his life for me  
Because of love so unconditional  
I will have life eternally  
  
This name speaks peace unto my storm clouds  
This name speaks calm unto me fears  
And when I feel that no one loves me  
His loving presence is so near  
That name is Jesus oh how I love him  
The one who gave his life for me  
Because of love so unconditional  
I will have life eternally  
  
Praise that name  
Praise that name  
Praise that name  
Praise that name  
  
Someday Ill leave this earthly dwelling  
To find a place my soul will soar  
And finally see the face of Jesus  
And praise his name forevermore  
That name is Jesus oh how I love him  
The one who gave his life for me  
Because of love so unconditional  
I will have life eternally  
Excellent is that name  
Glorious is that name  
Wonderful is that name  
Oh praise that name
