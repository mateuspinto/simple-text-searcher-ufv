Let the rains descend  
Times of sweet refreshing seasons  
Fill my heart fill my heart fill my heart fill my heart fill my heart

B I need Thee oh I need Thee  
Every hour I need Thee  
Bless me now my Saviour

I praise You I praise You  
  
Praise the name of Jesus  
Praise the name of Jesus  
Hes my rock Hes my fortress  
Hes my deliverer  
In Him will I trust  
Praise the name of Jesus  
  
I worship You 4xs  
I give You praise  
For You are my righteousness  
I worship You almighty God  
There is none like You  
There is none like You  
There is none like You  
There is none like You
