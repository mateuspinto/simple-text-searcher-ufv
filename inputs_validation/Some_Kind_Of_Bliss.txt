Shut my eyes  
Feel the color of you  
So get to this elation  
So high so fast  
  
Shut my eyes  
Feel the color of you  
Succumb to this illusion  
So strong so deep  
  
cause everyday is all there is  
In my some kind of bliss  
cause everyday is all there is  
In my some kind of bliss  
  
Study my reflection  
And let the colors fall  
Slip into stillness  
And be above it all  
  
Good to be here  
Time to be alone  
Ive found a space where I belong  
Not succumb to fear  
  
cause everyday is all there is  
In my some kind of bliss  
cause everyday is all there is  
In my some kind of bliss
