To you my love my joy my song  
I lift my voice my heart and soul  
In worship  
  
As eagles soar across the sky  
So my spirit reaches high  
Toward you  
  
As the deer pants for the water so  
My soul cries for you  
As a child has rest in arms of love  
So I rest in you  
  
You are the great and mighty  
Risen lord my king of glory  
Oh my soul bless the lord  
  
You reign in strength and power  
Awesome god my strong tower  
Oh my soul bless the lord
