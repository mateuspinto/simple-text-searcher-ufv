At last the crimson chord cascade  
To shower dry cordials within  
Too late to leap the chocolate gate  
Pale fountains fizzing forth pink gin  
While destiny begins to fly  
The farmyard chorus sings its wake  
Upstanding anthem to the sky  
Too soon to realise their fate  
You were the raven of October  
I knew the sign you flew around  
Up in the air so high above me  
Never needed to look down  
I never thought Id be a rover  
I didnt even look around  
But now I know youve found another  
So will someone please find me  
Give now the host his claret cup  
And watch Madeiras farewell drink  
Note his reaction acid sharp  
Should make the cognoscenti think
