Like a portrait born of hate  
like a lock without a key  
I am trapped here in this prison  
deliver me from me  
like a world within my head  
like a thorn in my side  
I am choking on your virtue  
what a way to die  
  
And the wind keeps on moaning  
shattered lightning from the skies  
all your promises are broken  
I think you just want to bury me  
I wake up screaming every night  
I wake up screaming  
  
Like a guardian of lies  
bringing laughter in disguise  
I am drowning in your bullshit  
what a way to die  
like a crystal virgin mind  
when you blindly lead the blind  
I am waiting for my requiem  
or the end of time  
  
And the wind keeps on moaning  
spitting right into your eyes  
every bridge is burned and broken  
do you think you want to fuck with me  
I wake up screaming every night  
I wake up screaming  
  
Ooh what to do now when I see your armour twist and crack  
Ooh what to do now when I rip the smile right from your face rip  
  
Like a portrait born of Hate  
Like a lock without a key  
I am trapped here in this prison  
Deliver me from me  
  
And the wind keeps on moaning  
Spitting right into your eyes  
All your promises are broken  
Do you think youll stand the test of time  
  
I Wake up Screaming every night  
I Wake up Screaming
