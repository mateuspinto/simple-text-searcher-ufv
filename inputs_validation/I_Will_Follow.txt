I will follow  
  
I was on the outside when you said  
You said you needed me  
I was looking at myself  
I was blind I could not see  
  
A boy tries hard to be a man  
His mother takes him by his hand  
If he stops to think he starts to cry  
Oh why  
  
If you walk away walk away  
I walk away walk away I will follow  
  
If you walk away walk away  
I walk away walk away I will follow  
  
I was on the inside  
When they pulled the four walls down  
I was looking through the window  
I was lost I am found  
  
walk away walk away  
I walk away walk away I will follow  
If you walk away walk away  
I walk away walk away I will follow  
I will follow  
  
Your eyes make a circle  
I see you when I go in there  
Your eyes your eyes  
  
If you walk away walk away  
I walk away walk away I will follow  
  
If you walk away walk away  
I walk away walk away I will follow  
  
I will follow  
I will follow
