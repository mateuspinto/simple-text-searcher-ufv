And when your heart stops beating  
And the stars stop shining  
When all your tears go dry  
  
Honey one by one  
I will still be there  
I will sing your song  
And come to you  
Oh oh all night long  
  
And is this all that it seems  
Cause this is all that we need  
When all the thorns are cut away  
  
Baby one by one  
Will you still be there  
Will you sing my song  
And come with me  
Oh oh all night long  
  
And all your kisses linger  
Like they always do  
Let all that spirit in you  
Take it to the end  
I will still be there  
I will sing your song  
And come to you all night long
