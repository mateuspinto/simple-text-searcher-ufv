When I was just sixteen  I stood waiting for a dream   
At barker street bus station every night  
When I tried to get it on  she just looked at me with scorn  my courage  
Turned to dust and I took flight  
  
For those looks they seemed to say  
You aint nuthin  go away  
Youre just a face in the crowd so I went home and I vowed  
Im gonna be somebody  someday  
  
Her name was irene wilde  oh such beauty for a child  
When she started dating boys  I nearly died  
For I could not barely stand to see someone hold her hand  
I felt I had to crawl away and hide  
In my mothers living room I composed so many tunes  
All the same  just a frame  for her name and just to say  
Gonna be somebody  someday  
  
Wild as your name I soon left that country town  
I been around seen some fame seen some ups and seen some downs  
Smile through your shock when you hear your name aloud  
Its that face in the crowd  didnt dig it  much too proud  
  
When I was just sixteen I stood waiting for a dream  
A barker street bus station non affair  
At the time it seemed so sad but it did not turn out bad  
If you hadnt messed me up Id still be there  
And I think most folks agree a little putdown makes them see  
They aint no chain  just a link and thats why you made me think  
Gonna be somebody  be somebody  be somebody  someday
