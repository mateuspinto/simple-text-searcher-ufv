Round Ole Baugh Road its a great place kids to grow  
Some grow up and move away  
Most of us decide to stay  
Round the Ole Baugh Road  
  
Hard working mom and dad  
Gve us things that they never had  
I our corner of the world  
Romance is slow for the boys and girls  
Round the Ole Baugh Road  
  
The neighborhood still looks the same  
Just new kids with the same old names  
My Baugh Roads in a southern state  
Yours may be anywhere you S A  
Look round Ole Baugh Road  
  
I see the kids on Ole Baugh Road  
I see the glory of the future glow  
Look to the Heavens and give a shout  
Like my daddy did when he started out  
  
Round round round the Ole Baugh Road  
Round round round  
Round round round  
Round round round  
  
The Ole Baugh Road  
Round round round  
Round round round
