Seven lonely days make one lonely week seven lonely nights make one lonely me  
Ever since the time you told me we were through  
Seven lonely days Ive cried and cried for you  
Oh my darling Im crying hoo hoo hoo hoo theres no use in denying Ive cried
for you  
It was your favorite past time making me blue  
Last night was the last time Ill cry for you  
Seven hankies blue I filled with my tears seven letters too I filled with my
fears  
Guess it never paced to make your lover blue  
Seven lonely days Ive cried and cried for you  
Oh my darling Im crying  
Last night was the last time Ill cry for you
