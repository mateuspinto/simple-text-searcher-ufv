Its snowing outside the rumbling sound  
Of engines roar in the night  
The mission is near the confident men  
Are waiting to drop from the sky  
  
The Blizzard goes on but still they must fly  
No one should go where eagles dare  
  
Bavarian alps that lay all around  
They seem to stare from below  
The enemy lines a long time passed  
Are lying deep in the snow  
  
Into the night they fall through the sky  
No one should fly where eagles dare  
  
Theyre closing in the fortress is near  
Its standing high in the sky  
The cable cars the only way in  
Its really impossible to climb  
  
They make their way but maybe too late  
Theyve got to try to save the day  
  
The panicking cries the roaring of guns  
Are echoing all around the valley  
The mission complete they make to escape  
Away from the Eagles Nest  
  
They dared to go where no one would try  
They chose to fly where eagles dare
