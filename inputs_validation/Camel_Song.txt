From the End Of Days Soundtrack  
You can see I fly  
Disguised evil attracting everybody  
You can watch me play  
Taste your juices from me all day  
  
You can see I tried this all for you  
You can see I dispise all of you  
You can see Im trying something new  
You can see me fly  
  
Chorus  
Sometime somewhere  
Deceit leads you no where  
You try so hard  
To be the super star  
  
So come in with me  
Take your under sun light set you free  
Somewhere cant you see  
Going on this way  
Free youll never be  
  
So you see I tried this all for you  
So you see I dispise all of you  
So you see Im trying something new  
So you see me fly  
  
Chorus  
  
Just take me away  
Take me away Take me  
Take me  
  
Chorus  
  
Take me away  
Take me away
