And noone saw the Carny go  
And the weeks flew by  
Until they moved on the show  
Leaving his caravan behind  
It was parked out on the south east ridge  
And as the company crossed the bridge  
With the first rain filling the bonedry river bed  
It shone just so upon the edge  
Away away were sad to say  
  
Dogboy Atlas Mandrake the geeks the hired hands  
There was not one among them that did not cast an eye behind  
In the hope that the Carny would return to his own kind  
  
The Carny left behind a horse so skin and bone that hed named Sorrow  
And it was a shallow unmarked grave  
That that old nag was laid  
In the then parched meadow  
  
And it was the dwarves that were given the task of digging the ditch  
And laying the nags carcass in the ground  
While boss Bellini waved his smoking pistol round  
Saying The nag was dead meat  
We cant afford to carry dead weight  
The whole company standing about  
Not making a sound  
And turning to the dwarves on the enclosured gate  
The boss says bury this lump of crow bait  
  
And the rain came hammering down  
Everybody running for their wagons  
Tying all the canvas flaps down  
The mangy cats growling in their cages  
The birdgirl flapping and squawkening around  
The whole valley reeking of wet beast  
Wet beast and rotten sodden hay  
Freak and brute creation all packed up and on their way  
  
The three dwarves peering through their wagons hind  
Moses says to Noah We shoulda dugga deepa one  
Their grissom faces like dying moons  
Still dirty from the digging done  
  
And Charlie the Atlas to the three said  
I guess the Carny aint gonna show  
And they were silent for a spell  
Wishing theyd done a better job at burrying Sorrow  
  
And the companyd passed from the valley into higher ground  
The rain beat on the ridge and on the meadow and on the mound  
Until nothing was left nothing left at all  
Except the body of Sorrow that rose in time  
To float upon the surface of the eaten soil  
  
And a murder of crows did circle round  
First one then the others flapping blackly down  
  
And the Carnys van still sat upon the edge  
Tilting slowly as the firm ground turned to sludge  
  
And the rain it hammered down  
And the rain it hammered down  
And the rain it hammered down  
And the rain it hammered down  
  
And noone saw the Carny go  
And noone saw the Carny go  
And noone saw the Carny go  
I say its funny how things go
