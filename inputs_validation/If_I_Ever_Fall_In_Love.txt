The very first time  
That I saw your brown eyes  
Your lips said hello and I said hi  
I knew right then you were the one  
But I was caught up  
In physical attraction  
But to my satisfaction  
Baby you were more than just a face  
  
And if I ever ever fall in love again again  
I will be sure that the lady is a friend  
And if I ever ever fall in love so true true  
I will be sure that the ladys just like you  
  
Oh yeah the very next time shell be my friend  
  
If I say that I will be your one and only  
promise promise promise that youll never leave me lonely  
I just wanna be the one you need  
Oh baby  
I just wanna be the one who serves you  
Sometime I feel as if I dont deserve you  
I cherish every moment that we share  
  
And if I ever ever fall in love again again  
I will be sure that the lady is a friend  
And if I ever ever fall in love so true true  
I will be sure that the ladys just like you  
  
repeat  
Very next time she will be my friend  
Someone who I can believe in  
  
my friend  
I need someone wholl be my friend  
my friend  
To be with me through thick and thin  
my friend  
Please share my love with me my friend  
I need someone like you  
  
And if I ever ever fall in love again again  
I will be sure that the lady is a friend  
And if I ever ever fall in love so true true  
I will be sure that the ladys just like you
