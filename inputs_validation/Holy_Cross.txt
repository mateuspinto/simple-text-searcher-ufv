You work for 37 years  
Drivin trucks not shiftin gears  
He never got it in his head  
To settle down hed never wed  
  
He liked the river how it flowed  
Unlike the breaker never to explode  
It had no wires runnin in  
It just went on and on and on until the ocean got to it  
  
Holy Cross  
Electric Association  
Oh well its more than a job  
Its more like a damnation  
Well it was my life now its my loss  
Holy Cross  
  
It was a honey of a night  
He met his maker he saw the light  
The car was passin on a curve  
He never slowed down he never swerved  
  
And in the hot glare of the lamps  
He had regrets hed never learned to dance  
There was no angel at his side  
There was a Thermos that became homeless when he died  
  
Holy Cross  
Electric Association  
Oh well its more than a job  
Its more like a damnation  
Well it was my life now its my loss  
Holy Cross  
Electric Association  
Oh well its more than a job  
Its more like a damnation  
Well it was my life now its my loss  
Holy Cross  
Well it was my life now its my loss  
Well it was my life now its my loss  
Holy Cross
