She  
Ties her hair up tight  
Puts her armor on  
When she steps outside  
She  
Is in black and white  
And the colors gone  
But its in her eyes  
Time and time again were going back to the start  
And Im trying try again to bring some light to the dark  
You know every days a battle and it tears her apart  
And I dont know why  
And Im picking up the pieces when we fall to the feet  
We confide in other demons though shell never be free  
We could hide it in the shadows though its hard to believe  
And I dont know why  
  
Chorus  
Love dont ever change the way you are  
You light the sky just like a star  
I dont care what you say  
Youre beautiful to me  
Ohh  
  
She  
She never gets it right  
And it feels like rain on a perfect night  
And I  
Id be a hand to hold  
You can push me hard but I wont let go  
Time and time again were going back to the start  
And Im trying try again to bring some light to the dark  
You know every days a battle and it tears her apart  
But dont you cry  
  
Chorus  
My love dont ever change the way you are  
You light the sky just like a star  
I dont care what you say  
Youre beautiful to me  
  
Love Ill be your ordinary goal  
Youre so amazing dont you know  
I dont care what you say  
Youre beautiful to me  
Ohh  
  
The light breaks through your hair and  
Theyre all stopping and staring  
Id go anywhere  
Oh why cant you just see that  
Im crazy about you  
I cant live without you  
You dont see it  
But youre beautiful to me  
  
Chorus  
Love dont ever change the way you are  
You light the sky just like a star  
I dont care what you say  
Youre beautiful  
Ohh  
  
Chorus  
Love dont ever change the way you are  
You light the sky just like a star  
I dont care what you say  
Youre beautiful to me  
Comeon  
  
Love Ill be your ordinary goal  
Youre so amazing dont you know  
I dont care what you say  
Youre beautiful to me  
Youre beautiful to me
