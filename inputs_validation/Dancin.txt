Ho the band stopped playin  
An the couples stopped swayin  
But we kept on    dancin  
  
The lights went on  
An the crowd was gone  
But we kept on    dancin  
  
The janitor said Please let me sweep the floor  
So I hummed a tune an we danced right     
through the door  
  
It started rainin  
But we both were insane  
An we kept right    on dancin  
  
We looked a sight  
By the traffic light  
But we    kept on dancin  
  
The signal was red so we just tapped our feet  
When the light turned green  
Well we danced across the street  
  
 Couples parked in cars were romancin   
They were romancin  
But we kept right in dancin  
  
 Ba bum ba bum bum   
Our clothes were drippin  
An we couldnt help slippin  
But we kept right in dancin  
  
Our feet were sore  
When we reached your door  
But we kept right in dancin  
  
When I kissed ya goodnight  
My heart started dancin too  
Thats when I knew     
That I would dance my whole life through  
With only you     
  
With only you     
With only you     
My whole life through  
With only you
