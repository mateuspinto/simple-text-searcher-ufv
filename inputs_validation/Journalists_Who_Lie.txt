Journalists who lie  
Stealing the money  
Prospering with spite  
Hateinahurry  
Oh see how   
  
Theyre only trying to make their name  
By spreading Biz mythlies  
About the ones whove made their name  
Stick in the knife  
Stick in the knife  
  
Journalists who lie  
The truth is it happens  
Praise then crucify  
Just follow this pattern  
And see how  
  
Theyre only trying to make their name  
By spreading sickening lies  
About the ones whove made their name  
Mate give us the knife  
Give us the knife  
  
Journalists who lie  
So happy in malice  
Rock star  out of line  
So happy in malice  
Oh  
  
Journalists who lie  
So sick and belabored  
They only want to be favored  
They only want to be favored  
See how  
  
Theyre only trying to make their name  
With unprovable lies  
About the ones  
Whove made their name  
  
In the black hole  
Of your soul  
Still bargaining away the truth  
So easily  
Truth  
  
Journalists who lie  
Stealing the money  
Prospering with spite  
And hateinahurry  
  
Journalists who lie  
The truth is it happens  
Praise then crucify  
Just follow this pattern  
  
Journalists who lie  
So sick and belabored  
They want to be favored  
They only want to be favored
