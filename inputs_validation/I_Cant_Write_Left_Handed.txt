I cant write lefthanded  
Would you please write a letterwrite a letter to my mother  
Tell her to telltell her to tell the family lawyer  
Trying to get a deferment for my younger brother  
Tell the Rev Harris to pray for me Lord lord lord  
I aint gonna liveI dont believe Im going to live to get much older  
Strange little man over here in Vietnam I aint never seen bless  
his heart aint never done nothing to he done shot me in my shoulder  
  
Boot camp we had classes  
You know we talked about fightingfighting everyday  
And looking through rosy colored glasses I must admit it seemed exciting
anyway  
Oh but someone that day overlooked to tell me bullets look better  
I must say  brother  when theyre coming at you than going out the other way  
And please call up the Rev Harris Tell him to ask the Lord to do some good
things for me  
Tell him I aint gonna liveI aint gonna live to get much older  
  
Whoa Lord Strange little man over here in Vietnam I aint never seen  bless
his heart  
I aint never done nothing to he done shot me in my shoulder
