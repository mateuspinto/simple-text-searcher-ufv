Verse 1  
I am the promise that you cannot keep  
Reap what you sow  
Find what you seek  
I am the sorceress down in the deep  
I am the earth under your feet  
I am the moon with no light of my own  
You are the sun guarding the throne  
I heard the angels whisper to me  
Look for the signs he is the one  
  
Chorus  
I light a candle here in the dark  
Making my way to your heart  
Ill cast a spell that you cant undo  
Till you wake and you find that you love me too  
Till you wake up and you find that you love me too  
  
Verse 2  
Ill be the bride that is married to life  
You are the day I am the night  
We knew a blanket of silver and gold  
Ill keep you warm do as Im told  
I need your strength it will keep me from harm  
Ill be your Queen safe in your arms  
Dont want to get to the end of my days  
Saying I wasnt amazed  
  
Chorus  
I light a candle here in the dark  
Making my way to your heart  
Ill cast a spell that you cant undo  
Till you wake and you find that you love me too  
Till you wake up and you find that you love me too  
  
Chorus  
I light a candle here in the dark  
Making my way to your heart  
Ill cast a spell that you cant undo  
Till you wake and you find that you love me too  
Till you wake up and you find that you love me too  
  
Till you wake up and you find that you love me too  
Till you wake up and you find that you love me too  
Till you wake up and you find that you love me too
