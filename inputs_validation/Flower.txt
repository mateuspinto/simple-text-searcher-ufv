All of seventeen  
Eyes a purple green  
Treated like a Queen she was  
On borrowed self esteem  
  
She would do a dance  
A painful masquerade  
Spinning you into her web  
Along her vain parade  
  
In her uniform  
Studded brass and steel  
Kissing lipstick napkin stains  
And smearing sincerity  
  
Along her vain parade  
Along her veins  
  
Time crept up on her  
Shes early gray  
Her reflection looks concerned  
As flowers hit her grave
