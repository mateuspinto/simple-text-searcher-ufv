Touched by the hand of ofra haza 8 08  
  
With the fire from the fireworks up above me  
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain at hand  
You run for cover in the temple of love  
You run for another but still the same  
For the wind will blow my name across this land  
In the temple of love you hide together  
Believing pain and fear outside  
But someone near you rides the weather  
And the tears he cried will rain on walls  
As wide as lovers eyes  
In the temple of love Shine like thunder  
In the temple of love Cry like rain  
In the temple of love Hear my calling  
In the temple of love Hear my name  
And the devil in black dress watches over  
My guardian angel walks away  
Life is short and love is always over in the morning  
Black wind come carry me far away  
With the sunlight died and night above me  
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain inside  
You run for cover in the temple of love  
You run for another its all the same  
For the wind will blow and throw your walls aside  
With the fire from the fireworks up above  
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain  
You run for cover in the temple of love  
I shine like thunder cry like rain  
And the temple grows old and strong  
But the wind blows stronger cold and long  
And the temple of love will fall before  
This black wind calls my name to you no more  
In the black sky thunder sweeping under ground and over water  
Sounds of weeping will not save  
Your faith for bricks and dreams for mortar  
All your prayers must seem as nothing  
Ninetysix below the wave  
When stone is dust and only air remains  
In the temple of love Shine like thunder  
In the temple of love Cry like rain  
In the temple of love Hear the calling  
And the temple of love is falling down  
In the temple of love Shine like thunder  
In the temple of love Cry like rain  
In the temple of love Hear my calling  
In the temple of love Hear my name  
In the black sky thunder sweeping under ground and over water  
Sounds of weeping will not save  
Your faith for bricks and dreams for mortar  
All your prayers must seem as nothing  
Ninetysix below the wave  
When stone is dust and only air remains  
The only haven you can trust  
And the devil in black dress watches over  
My guardian angel walks away  
Life is short and love is always over in the morning  
Black wind come carry me far away  
With the fire from the fireworks up above  
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain  
You run for cover in the temple of love  
I shine like thunder cry like rain  
And the temple grows old and strong  
But the wind blows stronger cold and long  
And the temple of love will fall before  
This black wind calls my name to you no more  
In the temple of love you hide together  
Believing pain and fear outside  
But someone near you rides the weather  
And the tears he cried will rain on walls  
As wide as lovers eyes  
In the temple of love Shine like thunder  
In the temple of love Cry like rain  
In the temple of love Hear the calling  
And the temple of love is falling down
