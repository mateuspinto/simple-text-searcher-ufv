I felt the need  
To tell you  
Something special and true  
But you never listened  
I gave my heart to you  
And now Im wondering  
What did I ever do to you and  
  
Chorus  
You turned around  
You turned away  
You turned me down  
Now What can I say  
Do you want to live alone  
Do you want to live depressed  
Why would you break my heart  
All I wanna know is  
What did I ever do to you  
  
How come you did  
That to me  
You broke my heart  
And it was  
Embarrassing  
How it happened  
In front of my friends  
  
Chorus  
  
What did I do to you  
Did I ever break your heart  
No no no oh  
  
Chorus  
  
And  
What did I ever do to you
