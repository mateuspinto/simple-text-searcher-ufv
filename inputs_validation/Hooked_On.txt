My mama told me go on and let you go  
Said you would be more problems than Id ever know  
Said if hes gonna go then let him go away  
But then I get the urge  
It hurts so bad damn  
When I feel the thirst  
It makes me mad  
I look up in my bed  
I look up and there is your face  
  
You love it you love it  
Im so hooked on it hooked on it  
You want it you want it  
Youre so good  
On a good day  
Sugarfall  
Your sugarfall  
You make my sugarfall sugarfall  
You know you want it bad babe  
  
I heard it in the streets  
You got another girl  
Yes it did sting  
But didnt shatter my world Im ok  
You should catch me now  
When Im in the fall of a state  
  
Youre probably thinking to yourself  
This just aint me  
On the contrary  
I was your freak I was your freak  
Hit me one more time  
And trust me Ill be ok  
Hey  
  
You love it you love it  
Im so hooked on it hooked on it  
You want it you want it  
Youre so good  
On a good day  
Sugarfall  
Your sugarfall  
You make my sugarfall sugarfall  
You know you want it bad babe  
  
Now I will be a bad chick  
If I rounded up my clothes  
And headed over straight to the door  
You wouldnt have a clue  
Of what you should do  
If I left you laying longing for more  
  
Youd be like baby dont go dont go  
Baby  
Want some more  
You want some more  
Baby dont go just dont go  
Said baby please listen  
Dont you just go  
  
Do you lick your lips  
When you stand alone  
Well you got no xray vision  
Staring through my clothes  
Are you sure that youre prepared  
For what comes serves on its plate  
Wait a minute  
Oooh Im having second thoughts  
See my hearts on fault  
Could you pass my shorts  
Dont you got a girl  
Till then  
Im sorry you must wait  
Especially since I know  
  
You love it you love it  
Im so hooked on it hooked on it  
You want it you want it  
Youre so good  
On a good day  
Sugarfall  
Your sugarfall  
You make my sugarfall sugarfall  
You know you want it bad babe  
Hey girl  
Im so hooked on it hooked on it  
You want it you want it  
Youre so good  
On a good day

You know you want it bad babe
