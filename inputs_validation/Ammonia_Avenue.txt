Is there no sign of light as we stand here in the darkness  
Watching the sun arise  
Is there no sign of life as we gaze at the waters  
Into the strangers eyes  
  
And who are we to criticize or scorn the things that they do  
For we shall seek and we shall find Ammonia Avenue  
  
If we call for the proof and we question the answers  
Only the doubt will grow  
Are we blind to the truth or a sign to believe in  
Only the wise will know  
  
And word by word they handed down the light that shines today  
And those who came at first to scoff remained behind to pray  
And those who came at first to scoff remained behind to pray  
  
When you cant hear the rhyme and you cant see the reason  
Why should the hope remain  
For a man will be tired and his soul will grow weary  
Living his life in vain  
  
And who are we to justify the right in all we do  
Until we seek until we find Ammonia Avenue  
  
Through all the doubt somehow they knew  
And stone by stone they built it high  
Until the sun broke through  
A ray of hope a shining light Ammonia Avenue
