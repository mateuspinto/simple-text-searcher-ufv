I dusted off my Bible today  
Read the words and read yeah every word He said  
He talked about forgiveness and a better way  
I raised my hands above my head and I said  
  
Touchdown Jesus  
Touchdown Jesus  
  
There was a little girl just down the street  
They were prayin for a miracle but runnin outta hope  
Some stranger was an angel and he gave her what she needed  
You oughta see her today that was ten years ago  
  
Touchdown Jesus  
Touchdown Jesus

All He needs is just a little bit of your faith  
And its touchdown Jesus  
Touchdown Jesus  
  
Old man was losin his bottle with the liquor  
Ruined his name and brought his family shame and pain  
Then he stumbled into church one day and he found something bigger  
Beat the devil at his own game and he poured him down the drain yeah  
  
Touchdown Jesus  
Touchdown Jesus  
  
Thats just another story wrote away  
All He needs is just a little bit of your faith  
And its touchdown Jesus
