I have so much anticipation  
For the future generations  
I think kids today are growing up smart  
With open minds ands open hearts  
We can do it   
Well put our heads to it  
And then well be  
ONe family  
A world filled with racial stress  
But it seems every year less and less  
Those old fashioned standards are going away  
Tomorrow will be a brighter day   
We can do it  
Well put our heads to it  
And then well be  
One family   
So if you agree and want to help  
Fisrt you must look inside yourself  
Because unity begins with just us two  
Then well watch it spread to all of you  
We can do it  
Well put our heads to it  
And then well be  
One family
