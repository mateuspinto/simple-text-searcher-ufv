In a space allocated to me by the human race  
Inhabiting this area until I die this space is occupied  
Im in a space leased by kind permission of the human race  
Close up I am big but far away Im small and hardly here at all  
Cause in a space out in space  
We disappear without a trace  
  
Now Im out in inner space  
And lookin at the people standing face to face  
And filling up the space  
Men and women boys and girls  
There are so many people in the world  
Thinkin about the world  
And all the people in it  
And Im staring at the stars  
And into the infinite  
In a world without a world  
On a planet thats  
Driftin in a space  
  
Seconds into minutes and minutes  
Into hour and hours into days  
And days into months and months into years  
Thousands into millions millions into billions  
Billions into zillions and forever and forever  
  
In a space allocated by the human race  
Somewhere in outer space its far away and I like it that way  
No Im out in inner space  
And lookin at the people standing face to face  
And filling up the space  
Men and women boys and girls  
There are so many people in the world  
Thinkin about the world  
And all the people in it  
And Im staring at the stars  
And into the infinite  
In a world without a world  
On a planet thats  
Driftin in a space  
  
In a space in a space in a space  
Now Im out in inner space  
And lookin at the people standing face to face  
And filling up the space  
On planet thats  
Driftin in a space
