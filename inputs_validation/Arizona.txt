Arizona really was a gas  
I was screwed up in a total mess  
Mind blowing all the way you know  
Just out of sight  
Some girl stopped me in the street at night  
Ooh what a knockout and she felt so right  
Ooh yeah she took my breath away  
Just out of sight  
  
Loved her in her car  
Took me to the stars  
Babe we went nuts all the way  
Loved her on the moon  
Morning came too soon  
She got me high and loose loose loose  
  
Arizona really feels alright  
Girls swing here and they treat you right  
Have so many special ways you know  
And thats alright  
Was so hard to leave and say goodbye  
Id like to stay and have another try  
Mind blowing all the way you know  
Just out of sight  
  
Loved her in her car  
Took me to the stars  
Babe we went nuts all the way  
Loved her on the moon  
Morning came too soon  
She got me high and loose loose loose  
  
Ooh what a night  
Such a good time  
Out of sight  
Yeah what a night
