When we were in the darkest night  
And wondered if our eyes would ever see the light  
You were there Lord  
When we were in the stormy gale  
And wondered if wed ever live in peace again  
You were there Lord  
You were there in the struggle  
You were there in the fight  
You were there all the time  
  
We praise You  the God of our yesterdays  
We praise You  the God who is here today  
We praise You  our God as tomorrow comes  
  
So whatever lies ahead  
Whatever roads our grateful hearts will come to tread  
Youll be there Lord  
We will fix our eyes on You  
And know that there is grace enough to see us through  
Youll be there Lord  
Youll be there in the struggle  
Youll be there in the fight  
Youll be there all the time  
  
We praise You  the God of our yesterdays  
We praise You  the God who is here today  
We praise You  our God as tomorrow comes  
We thank you  for grace in our yesterdays  
We thank you  for peace in our hearts today  
We thank you  our joy as tomorrow comes  
We will trust you God  
  
Youre always closer than we know  
Always more involved and in control  
We will trust our lives to You   
The One who wasand is and is to come  
  
Spoken  
So we say we trust You Lord  
We trust You with our lifes  
You are so trustworthy  
Your word says those who know Your name trust in You  
And we know Your name  
We know that You are good  
You are gracious  
You are kind  
You are wise  
You are in control  
You never let go  
  
Yesterday today forever  
You are the same  
You never change  
You never fail  
You never faint  
  
We can trust You  
We can trust You
