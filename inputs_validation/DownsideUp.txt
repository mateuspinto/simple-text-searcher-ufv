I looked up at the tallest building  
Felt it falling down  
  
I could feel my balance shifting  
Everything was moving around  
  
These streets so fixed and solid  
Ah shimmering haze  
  
And everything I relied on disappeared  
  
Downside up upside down  
Take my weight from the ground  
Falling deep in the sky  
Slipping in the unknown  
  
All the strangers look like family  
All the family look so strange  
  
The only constant I am sure of  
Is this accelerating rate of change  
  
Downside up upside down  
Take my weight off the ground  
Falling deep in the sky  
Slipping in the unknown  
  
I stand here watch you spinning  
Until I am drawn in  
A centripetal force  
You pull me in  
  
Pull me in  
  
OVO  
  
Downside up upside down  
Take my weight off the ground  
Falling deep in the sky  
Slipping in the unknown
