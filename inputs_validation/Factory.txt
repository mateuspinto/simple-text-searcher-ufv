Early in the morning factory whistle blows  
Man rises from bed and puts on his clothes  
Man takes his lunch walks out in the morning light  
Its the working the working just the working life  
  
Through the mansions of fear through the mansions of pain  
I see my daddy walking through them factory gates in the rain  
Factory takes his hearing factory gives him life  
The working the working just the working life  
  
End of the day factory whistle cries  
Men walk through these gates with death in their eyes  
And you just better believe boy  
Somebodys gonna get hurt tonight  
Its the working the working just the working life
