Im the living result  
Im a man whos been hurt a little too much  
And Ive tasted the bitterness of my own tears  
Sadness is all my lonely heart can feel  
I cant stand up for falling down  
I cant stand up for falling down  
Simple though love is  
Still it confused me  
Why Im not loved the way I should be  
Now Ive lived with heartaches  
And Ive roomed with fear  
Ive dealt with despair  
And Ive wrestled with tears  
I cant stand up for falling down  
I cant stand up for falling down  
The vow that we made  
You broke it in two  
But that dont stop me from loving you  
I cant stand up for falling down  
I cant stand up for falling down
