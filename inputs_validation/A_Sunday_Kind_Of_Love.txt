I want a Sunday kind of love  
A love to last past Saturday night  
And Id like to know its more than love at first sight  
And I want a Sunday kind of love  
Oh yea yea  
  
I want a a love thats on the square  
Cant seem to find somebody  
Someone to care  
And Im on a lonely road that leads to no where  
I need a Sunday kind of love  
  
I do my Sunday dreaming Oh yea  
And all my Sunday scheming  
Every minute every hour every day  
  
Oh Im hoping to discover  
A certain kind of lover  
Who will show me the way  
  
And my arms need someone  
Someone to enfold  
To keep me warm when Mondays and Tuesdays grow cold  
Love for all my life to have and to hold  
Oh and I want a Sunday kind of love  
Oh yea yea yea  
  
I dont want a Monday Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday Friday or Saturday  
Oh nothing but Sunday oh yea  
I want a Sunday Sunday  
I want a Sunday kind of love  
Oh yea  
Sunday Sunday Sunday kind of love
