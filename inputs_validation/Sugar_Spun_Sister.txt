Her hair  
Soft drifted snow  
Death white  
Id like to know  
Why she hates  
All that she does  
But she gives  
It all that shes got  
Until the sky turns green  
The grass is several shades of blue  
Every member of parliament trips on glue  
Until the sky turns green  
And the grass is several shades of blue  
Every member of parliament trips on glue  
T takes all these things and all that time  
Till my sugar spun sisters happy  
With this love of mine  
Itll take all these things and oh much more  
Ive paid  
For fifteen or more  
But my guts  
Cant take many more  
My hands are stuck  
To my jeans  
And she knows she knows  
What this must mean  
She wakes up with the sun  
She asked me what is all the fuss  
As she gave me more than she thought she should  
She wakes up with the sun  
I think what have I done  
As I gave her more than I thought I would ohhh  
At takes all these things and all that time  
Till my sugar spun sisters happy  
With this love of mine  
Yeah yeah yeah  
The candy floss girl  
The sticky fingered boy  
Oh that sister of mine  
Yeah
