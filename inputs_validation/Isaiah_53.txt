Isaiah 53  
Words and music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
All we like sheep have gone astray  
Weve turned everyone to his own way  
And God laid all our iniquity on Him  
Like a lamb they led Him out  
Yet He opened not His mouth  
And His precious blood poured out  
An offering for sin  
Chorus  
He was wounded for our transgressions  
He was bruised for our iniquities  
Our punishment was upon Him  
And by His stripes we are healed  
He had no beauty or majesty  
Clothed in lowly humanity  
And though we saw Him  
We could not see  
The glory of His grace  
But every law was satisfied  
The moment He laid down His life  
The power of death was destroyed  
The price was paid  
Chorus repeat
