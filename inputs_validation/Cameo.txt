Ooh  
A little closer in the pool  
And I have something that you crave  
But you know all about it  
Climb  
Give me a minute of your time  
And I could figure out a way  
To make you worth your wild  
  
Cause I am drawn to you  
And everybody stares when you walk into the room  
But you keep disappearing  
  
Have I told you  
Youre my cameo  
Want you love it  
Here we go  
Cameo  
  
Leave  
Or youll find yourself in me  
Or something more than you can taste  
And itll drive you wild  
I was a slave to every signal that you gave  
You had me ready for the chase  
And theres no denial  
  
Cause I am drawn to you  
And everybody stares when you walk into the room  
But you keep disappearing  
  
Have I told you  
Youre my cameo  
Want you love it  
Here we go  
Cameo  
  
I want you in it  
Give me a minute  
I want you in it  
  
Have I told you  
Youre my cameo  
Want you love it  
Here we go  
Cameooo
