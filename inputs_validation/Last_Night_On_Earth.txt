I text a postcard sent to you  
Did it go through  
Sending all my love to you  
You are the moonlight of my life every night  
Giving all my love to you  
My beating heart belongs to you  
I walked for miles til I found you  
Im here to honor you  
If I lose everything in the fire  
Im sending all my love to you  
  
With every breath that I am worth  
Here on Earth  
Im sending all my love to you  
So if you dare to second guess  
You can rest assure  
That all my loves for you  
  
My beating heart belongs to you  
I walked for miles til l found you  
Im here to honor you  
If I lose everything in the fire  
Im sending all my love to you  
  
My beating heart belongs to you  
I walked for miles til I found you  
Im here to honor you  
If I lose everything in the fire  
Did I ever make it through
