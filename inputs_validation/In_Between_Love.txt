In between love and trying to scheme love  
Who can tell what we may find  
Never thought love not get caught love  
Between the magic in your eyes  
And loves like women its cool and breezy  
Never thought that love could be so easy  
  
In between love and trying to scheme love  
And in between love again  
  
In between love and trying to scheme love  
Who can tell what we may find  
All this time love I sublime love  
To the feelings in my mind  
Loves like women its cool and breezy  
Never thought that love could be so easy  
  
In between love and trying to scheme love  
And in between love again
