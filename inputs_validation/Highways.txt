Highways take me everywhere I want to go with one exception standing  
That road leads into the quiet places in the shadows of your mind  
The beaten path of common words can only lead us to misunderstanding  
I believe that I can see the love for you that is a greater kind  
  
Highways take me over the mountains into the valleys and out through the
plains  
Wanting to be in your hearts understanding I travel each highway in vain  
Highways only take me into places where the average of the crowd goes  
Where they affix the standard on the language and emotions of the love  
  
Highways never reach above the ground and cannot know the things a cloud knows  
In a million volumes they have never written to express my love  
Highways take me over the mountains  
Highways take me over the mountains
