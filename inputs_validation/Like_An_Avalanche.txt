Beautiful God  
Laying Your majesty aside  
You reached out in love to show me life  
Lifted from darkness into light  
Oh  
  
King for a slave  
Trading Your righteousness for shame  
Despite all my pride and foolish ways  
Caught in Your infinite embrace  
Oh  
  
And I find myself here on my knees again  
Caught up in grace like an avalanche  
Nothing compares to this love love love  
Burning in my heart  
  
Saviour and Friend  
Breathing Your life into my heart  
Your word is the lamp unto my path  
Forever Im humbled by Your love  
Oh  
  
Take my life  
Take all that I am  
With all that I am I will love You  
Take my heart  
Take all that I have  
Jesus how I adore You  
  
And I find myself here on my knees again  
Caught up in grace like an avalanche  
Nothing compare to this love love love
