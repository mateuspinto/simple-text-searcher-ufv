When the fat old sun in the sky is falling  
Summer evenin birds are calling  
Summers thunder time of year  
The sound of music in my ears  
Distant bells new mown grass  
Smells so sweet  
By the river holding hands  
Roll me up and lay me down  
And if you sit dont make a sound  
Pick your feet up off the ground  
And if you hear as the warm night falls  
The silver sound from a time so strange  
Sing to me sing to me  
When that fat old sun in the sky is falling  
Summer evenin birds are calling  
Childrens laughter in my ears  
The last sunlight disappears  
And if you sit dont make a sound  
Pick your feet up off the ground  
And if you hear as the warm night falls  
The silver sound from a time so strange  
Sing to me sing to me  
When that fat old sun in the sky is falling
