Ouija board  
Would you work for me  
I have got to say hello  
To an old friend  
  
Ouija board Ouija board Ouija board  
Would you work for me  
I have got to get through  
To a good friend  
Well she has now gone  
From this unhappy planet  
With all the carnivores  
And the destructors of it  
  
Ouija board Ouija board Ouija board  
Would you help me  
Because I still do feel  
So horribly lonely  
  
Would you Ouija board  
Would you Ouija board  
Would you help me  
And I just cant find  
My place in this world  
  
She has now gone  
From this unhappy planet  
With all the carnivores  
And the destructors of it  
  
Oh hear my voice hear my voice  
Oh hear my voice hear my voice  
Hear my voice hear my voice  
Hear my voice hear my voice  
The table is rumbling  
The table is rumbling  
The glass is moving  
No I was not pushing that time  
It spells  STEVEN  
  
The table is rumbling  
The glass is moving  
No I was not pushing that time   
PUSHO double F  
  
Well she has now gone  
From this unhappy planet  
With all the carnivores  
And the destructors of it
