You came when I was happy in your sunshine  
I grew to love you more each passing day  
Before too long I built my world around you  
And I prayed youd love enough of me to stay  
If you love me let me know if you dont then let me go  
I cant take another minute of the day without you in it  
If you love me let it be if you dont then set me free  
Take the chains away that keep me loving you  
 steel   
The arms that open wide to hold me closer  
The hands that run their fingers through my hair  
The smile that says hello its good to see you  
Anytime I turn around to find you there  
Its this and so much more that makes me love you  
What else can I do to make you see  
You know you have whatevers mine to give you  
But a love affair for one can never be  
If you love me let me know  
 steel   
Take the chains away that keep me loving you
