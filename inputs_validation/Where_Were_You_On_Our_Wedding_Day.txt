Where were you on our wedding day  
I got bad news that you went away  
Where were you on our wedding day  
You did me wrong now you must pay  
Whoa oh whoa oh give me back my ring my ring whoa oh whoa oh  
Whoa oh whoa oh I aint gonna let you keep a thing a thing whoa oh  
  
Where were you when I said I do  
Everybody laughed and my inlaws too  
Where were you when I turned around  
Someplace you knew you never could be found  
Whoa oh whoa oh give me back my ring my ring whoa oh whoa oh  
Whoa oh whoa oh I aint gonna let you keep a thing a thing whoa oh  
  
Where were you when I searched the town  
And turned the whole neighborhood upside down  
Where were you little girl I say  
Where were you on our wedding day  
Whoa oh whoa oh give me back my ring my ring whoa oh whoa oh  
Whoa oh whoa oh I aint gonna let you keep a thing a thing whoa oh
