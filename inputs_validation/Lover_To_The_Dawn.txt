And as the sparrow sings  
Dawn chorus for  
Someone else to hear  
The thinker sits alone growing older  
And so bitter  
She gave them life  
She gave them all  
They drained her very soul drydry  
Hey hey hey bitter girl  
Were out to sitting here digging you  
We flew done here just to figure you  
Its easy  
Dont be so bitter  
Oh oh oh crazy girl  
You gave too much and you got nothing  
Too many problems and not one thing  
In return  
Left high and dry  
Door  
And as the sun rise stream  
Flickers on  
She finds lavender  
To fight the beckoning
