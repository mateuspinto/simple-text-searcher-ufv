This morning as I walked I gazed out across my land  
Lying there all still lying there upon the sand  
A big silver bird had planted itself into the ground  
And being the kind of person who isnt very easily alarmed  
Decided to take a walk to see just what I could find  
Walked around the walls tapping to find me a door  
Looking for a windows to see if I could find out more  
Big silver bird let me inside your plane  
Want to fly so high fly me high away  
All of a sudden the door slid back and someone was there  
A strange kind of being spoke to me in my tongue  
step inside well take you away in our plane  
Well fly you so high youll never have the chance to complain  
To leave this earth never even       
Stepping inside I fixed myself into a seat  
Holding on lord I heard them engines start to beat  
Big silver bird let me inside your plane  
Want to fly so high fly me high away
