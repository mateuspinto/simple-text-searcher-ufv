Only last night when your arms held me tight  
you told me you thought our love could last forever forever  
I was the one that gave you all the love when I thought  
that our love could last forever forever  
  
I lay down and die  
The whole world joins in  
And everyone cries as teardrops begin  
I lay down and die  
And when darkness falls  
cant seem right there at all  
I lay down and die  
The whole world joins in  
  
I lay down and die  
The teardrops begin  
I lay down and die  
And die  
And die  
I lay down and die  
  
The whole world joins in  
I lay down and die and the teardrops begin  
I lay down and die and I lay down and die
