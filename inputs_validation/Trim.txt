Heheheat in your skin  
Pull up a chair and unwind  
Dog we dont share  
The taxi left us behind  
Silhouette of a psychic reader in the market  
And the straw wrapped around a bottle to take home  
Barbecue chicken oil in a drum double strong wrong  
Here comes the horn you call for  
Woman in a box with her head in her box  
Speaks french when spoken like a tourist french  
Hey classic cocacola in a can when you want to cool down  
Heat she move up the street in waves  
Sugar sugar clear your mind leave it all behind  
Get in the boat and float  
Join in on a high spot and ride ride  
Put on some smile  
Stay for a while
