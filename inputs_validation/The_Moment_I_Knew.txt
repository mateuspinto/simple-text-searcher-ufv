You shouldve been there  
Shouldve burst through the door  
With that baby Im right here smile  
And it wouldve felt like  
A million little shining stars had just aligned  
And I wouldve been so happy  
  
Christmas lights glisten  
Ive got my eye on the door  
Just waiting for you to walk in  
But the time is ticking  
People ask me how Ive been  
As I comb back through my memory  
How you said youd be here  
You said youd be here  
  
And it was like slow motion  
Standing there in my party dress  
In red lipstick  
With no one to impress  
And theyre all laughing  
As Im looking around the room  
But there was one thing missing  
And that was the moment I knew  
  
And the hours pass by  
Now I just wanna be alone  
But your close friends always seem to know  
When theres something really wrong  
So they follow me down the hall  
And there in the bathroom  
I try not to fall apart  
And the sinking feeling starts  
As I say hopelessly  
He said hed be here  
  
And it was like slow motion  
Standing there in my party dress  
In red lipstick  
With no one to impress  
And theyre all laughing  
And asking me about you  
But there was one thing missing  
And that was the moment I knew  
  
What do you say  
When tears are streaming down your face  
In front of everyone you know  
And what do you do when the one  
Who means the most to you  
Is the one who didnt show  
  
You shouldve been here  
And I wouldve been so happy  
  
And it was like slow motion  
Standing there in my party dress  
In red lipstick  
With no one to impress  
And theyre all standing around me singing  
Happy birthday to you  
But there was one thing missing  
And that was the moment I knew  
  
Ooh I knew  
Ooh  
  
You called me later  
And said Im sorry I didnt make it  
And I said Im sorry too  
And that was the moment I knew
