Theyre sending back pictures from Saturn and Mars  
Maybe this will be our new home  
Well we seem to have messed up  
And we must look to the stars  
Our paradise we seem to have outgrown

Get ready for a ride on the exodus plane  
  
Well weve been much too greedy  
Wanting too much to fast  
But we have to say we are what we are  
Well the trees and the plants and the animals have gone  
Long ago  
Used to be real air to breath they say so

Anyway its too late for what might have been  
Kiss the earth goodbye and get out of here  
If theres anybody out there  
Hope they havent made the same mistakes  
Turning gold into garbage and a banquet into dustcakes
