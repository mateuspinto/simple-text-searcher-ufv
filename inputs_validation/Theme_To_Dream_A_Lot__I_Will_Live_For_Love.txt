Theme to Dream a Lot I will live for love By Donna Summers  
  
Theres got to be a way that I can dream  
Simply close my eyes and see  
The worlds Ive never known  
What places that my soul has been  
  
Sometimes I need to run away and hide  
I sail along so high  
Till nothings in my sky  
Except the stars that fill my eyes  
  
Chorus  
Im searching for the one who holds the key  
To all this crazy life I lead  
Through galaxies in time  
A solitary star that joins  
  
Sometimes I need to close my eyes and breathe  
Inhale what life has given me  
A bastion to ignite  
A flaming heart in flight  
I close my eyes  
I breathe  
Im free  
  
Chorus  
  
Ive always must have known  
A lover of his own  
Cause that is when he wrote  
Everything I felt for love  
  
And I will fight for love in life and in love  
And I will hold the things above  
Im strong enough to slay the dragon thats there  
I will live for love  
  
Ive thought about this life  
This dream will never die  
So only know that I  
I will live for love  
  
Always must have known a lover of his own  
That is when he wrote everything I felt for love  
I will ever fight  
I will live for life  
I will live for love
