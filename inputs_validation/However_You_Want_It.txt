However you want it you dont want it cuz when you get it it hurts  
Your body carried out the church  
Mom she be cryin holdin on to her purse sayin oh my baby  
They shoulda took me first  
However you want it you dont want it cuz when you get it it hurts  
Your body carried out the church  
Mom she be cryin holdin on to her purse sayin oh  
  
Aiyyo  
What yall thought I was too busy writin songs with Whitney Houston  
Cuz My Loves Your Love will be my slugs wit blood  
For any thug that wanna bang and play orangutang  
Find yourself in the river with the rest of them  
Wake up wake up Im in a nightmare dream  
Where I found myself loadin magazines after magazines  
Ski mask on my face gun on my waist  
Fine pens shakin in my hand as I write this next line  
You look strange shootin victims at close range  
And saw his vein burst from his neck as I snatched his chain  
Is this a Bible I used to read the Gospel  
Until I got betrayed by one of my twelve disciples  
Which one look through the crowd son  
You could spot the traitor wit a tatto on his arm  
The symbol is a microphone an intellectual  
A wannabe Rakim but too extraterrestrial  
I heard hes lethal and Im too rusty to battle him  
Me being rusty is like Biggie not being Born Again  
It never happen watch who you call fam  
On MTV he painted himself as the tin man  
Predicted platinum way before it happened  
So thats why when you ship gold you only sold aluminum  
  
And now you wanna tell everybody I messed up your record  
Cmon  
  
However you want it you dont want it cuz when you get it it hurts  
Your body carried out the church  
Mom she be cryin holdin on to her purse sayin oh my baby  
They shoulda took me first  
However you want it you dont want it cuz when you get it it hurts  
Your body carried out the church  
Mom she be cryin holdin on to her purse sayin oh  
  
You a thug You aint a murderer just an undercover caligula  
Cuz when you saw the luger became silent like Caesar  
Enough of this rap stuff Sedeck take his watch  
If I wasnt rappin Id take that stash in your left socks  
Dont make me raise my voice cuz Im masterin a coo  
So and besides when they find you youll be bones  
Mom say watch my peers hangin like chandeliers  
Orderin Don P you couldnt pay for one beer  
Perpetratin a fraud oh god you aint hard  
Take thirty of yall to murder one kid on the boulevard  
You want Wyclef Jean bring your same thug guys  
Heres my advice leave the ring with your bride  
Cuz you aint comin back no more  
We gon send you to a vacation for two with crabs on the seashore  
You freeze up hold up I really thought you was psychotic  
Is that tears in your eyes You cryin for your life  
Kid you tellin me what you did you didnt wanna do  
Watch what you say on record cuz it might come true  
  
However you want it you dont want it cuz when you get it it hurts  
Your body carried out the church  
Mom she be cryin holdin on to her purse sayin oh my baby  
They shoulda took me first  
However you want it you dont want it cuz when you get it it hurts  
Your body carried out the church  
Mom she be cryin holdin on to her purse sayin oh  
  
Should I take them Should I wait  
Should I take them Should I wait  
Should I take them Should I wait  
I say No Woman No Cry like I should own a piece of the estate  
But at the tribute they didnt invite me  
So I put in a call to Halis Alassi  
He said be easy aint no need to bust a shot BLOW BLOW BLOW BLOW  
Like Supercat said yo the ghettos red hot  
Before bling bling bling it was BLING BLING BLING
