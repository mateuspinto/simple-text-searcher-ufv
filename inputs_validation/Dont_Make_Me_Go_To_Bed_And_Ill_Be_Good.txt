A laughing baby boy one evening in his play  
Disturbed the household with his noisy glee  
I warned him to be quiet but he soon would disobey  
For he would soon forget a word from me  
  
I called him to my side and said now son you go to bed  
Your conduct has been very very rude  
With quivering lips and tear filled eyes he pleaded then with me  
Dont make me go to bed papa and Ill be good  
  
Dont papa and Ill be good  
Dont papa and Ill be good  
Thats what I heard him say and it haunts me night and day  
Dont make me go to bed papa and Ill be good  
  
Our lives have just been gladdened by his bright ascending beam  
Our boy now in our hearts was very dear  
We hastened to his bed one night he was talking in his sleep  
He didnt seem to know that we were near  
  
I took him in my arms and found his body raked with pain  
To ease the pain we did the best we could  
It broke my heart to hear him cryin loudly in his sleep  
Dont make me go to bed papa and Ill be good  
  
All night and day we watched and prayed we never left his side  
To give him up it seemed we never could  
It broke my heart to hear him crying just before he died  
Dont make me go to bed papa and Ill be good
