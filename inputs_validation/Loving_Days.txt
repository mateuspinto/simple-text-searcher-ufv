Ill dive deep I have fallen all the way  
Happily theres no escape  
Surrender to your heart  
  
Giving in to all of this  
Fascinated by your kiss  
Im floating in your arms  
  
Take your time just unwind  
Ooh I want to breathe you in  
A little while to ease your mind  
Youre the world Im living in  
  
Precious time with you  
Diving in the blue  
We are riding on the waves  
These are loving days  
Loving days with you  
  
Fantasy feel it rushing over me  
Nowhere else I want to be  
My love is by my side  
  
For a moment you and me  
Holding on to ecstasy  
Give us all day and night  
  
Take your time just unwind  
Ooh I want to breathe you in  
A little while to ease your mind  
Youre the world Im living in  
  
Precious time with you  
Diving in the blue  
We are riding on the waves  
These are loving days  
Loving days with you  
  
Precious time with you  
Diving in the blue  
We are riding on the waves  
These are loving days  
Loving days with you  
  
These are loving days with you  
  
Precious time with you  
Diving in the blue  
We are riding on the waves  
These are loving days  
Loving days with you  
  
Precious time with you  
Diving in the blue  
We are riding on the waves  
These are loving days  
Loving days with you
