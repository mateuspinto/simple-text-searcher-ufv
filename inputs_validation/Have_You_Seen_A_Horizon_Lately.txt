Have you seen a horizon lately  
If you have watch it for a while  
For you never know  
It may not last so long  
  
Have you seen an evening light lately  
If you have watch it for a while  
For you never know  
It may not be the same  
  
Have you seen a snowflake lately  
If you have hold it in your hand  
For you never know  
It may melt away  
  
Have you been in love lately  
If you have hold it in your heart  
For you never know  
It may be the last
