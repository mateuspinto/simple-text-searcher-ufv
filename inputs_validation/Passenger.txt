I saw your face stuck in a crowd  
Silently screaming out loud  
I felt the beat echo your heart  
Throw me a line cause its too far  
  
All that you want all that you see  
All that you thought that you believe  
  
Is it enough Do you think its too much  
You say you only trust what you can touch  
  
All you got to do is reach out for it  
  
All that you want  
Is standing right in front of you  
All that you need  
Is love  
All that you want  
Is standing right in front of you  
All that you need  
Is love  
  
Up to the ledge put out my hands  
Scared to the bones of where Id land  
Trade in my fears trade in my thoughts  
They disappear behind your walls  
  
All that I want all that I need  
All that I thought I believed  
Was it enough Sure not too much  
Now youre the only thing that I can trust  
  
All I got to do is reach out for it  
  
All that you want  
Is standing right in front of you  
All that you need  
Is love  
All that you want  
Is standing right in front of you  
All that you need  
Is love  
  
Its all for you  
Its all for you
