Monday morning another workin week ahead  
Friday seems so far away  
The clock keeps ringin I gotta get up out of bed  
Maybe this could be the day  
Motivation well it keeps you holdin on  
Every step of the way  
Headin in the right direction when you think youre turnin wrong  
Lookin out for when you stray  
So hear what I say  
Theres no other way you gotta  
  
Chorus  
Hold onto your dreams  
Cause someday baby  
Your ship is gonna come in so  
Hold onto your dreams  
Cause everything ya see  
Comes true if you believe in holdin  
On to your dreams  
  
Well I know sometimes its hard to see the light  
Shinin at the tunnels end  
And though the road just goes on and on for miles  
Faith lives just around the bend  
So now and then remember  
  
Hold onto your dreams  
Cause someday baby  
Your ship is gonna come in so  
Hold onto your dreams  
And everything ya see  
Comes true if you believe in holdin  
On to your dreams  
  
Just like your eyes are the window to the soul  
Dreams are the highway that lead to your goal  
Hold on hold on  
Youve got to hold on  
Hold on  
  
Oh you just got to hold on  
  
Hold onto your dreams  
Cause someday baby  
Your ship is gonna come in so  
Hold onto your dreams  
Cause someday baby  
Your ship is gonna come in so  
Hold onto your dreams  
Cause someday baby  
Your ship is gonna come in so  
Hold onto your dreams  
Cause everything ya see  
Comes true if you believe  
In holding on to your dreams
