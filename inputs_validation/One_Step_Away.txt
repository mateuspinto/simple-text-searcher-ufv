One life one chance one time  
One life to see it all  
One shot at tomorrow  
You will never see this time again  
  
A belief that time is cruelty  
Happiness is just one step away  
This life will never falter  
Determinated that time will never fall  
  
This way will never fail me  
I will testify  
I swear that I can see the light  
Its born  
  
It will be forever  
A personal basking thrown  
Life can give us  
Walk the line break the walls  
  
See the things youve never known  
Break these walls with life  
One step away
