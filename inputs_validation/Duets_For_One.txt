Look at you could I have been so foolish and so green  
A face that smiled at every passing scene  
Look at you youre lost behind the web of woven time  
When each emotion pinball in your mind  
  
Look at me Im happy now I see your face and smile  
I was the judge and jury at your trial  
Look at me you know the road ahead will twist and turn  
Now I have the time to stand and learn  
  
But you and I have come so far  
With a shaken faith  
From the pain of a broken heart  
Toward feeling great  
Feel like life has just begun  
No more singing duets for one  
  
I hold your picture here beside the bed  
You had a party raging in your head  
Look at me I look at you with vacancy and hurt  
And here today all I can do is learn  
  
Look at me Im happy now I see your face and smile  
I was the judge and jury at your trial  
Look at me you know the road ahead will twist and turn  
Now I have the time to stand and learn  
  
I have this picture of me looking at you  
Looking at me  
And I would like to say  
Goodbye sweet memory
