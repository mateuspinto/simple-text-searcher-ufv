Highly inflammable  
Waiting to explode  
Neurotic tensions  
Risen overflowed  
  
You thought I was a woman  
I thought you were a man  
But I was Tinkerbell  
And you were peter pan  
  
Influenced by the fashion pages  
Influenced by others phases  
It aint hip if you are retro  
Youre a pseudo quasi intellectual  
  
Supreme equality  
We used to compete  
The right to decide  
Is denied to the sheep  
  
You thought I was a woman  
I thought you were a man  
But I was tinker bell  
And you were peter pan
