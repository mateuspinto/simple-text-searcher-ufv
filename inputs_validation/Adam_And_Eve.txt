The lord named Adam and Eve  
To live a happy life  
In the garden of Eden  
But they disobeyed  
  
I wanna know  
Why they sin  
In the garden of Eden  
  
Its a devilmans affair  
In the shake of a surfband  
  
And they broke the fruit of life  
And everyone of us is living in sin  
  
Any anywhere you go  
Woman is the root of all evil  
  
He was the first one to break a fruit  
And everyone of us is living in sin
