They say the beat of a butterflies wings  
Can set off a storm in the world away  
What if that ride in the smallest of things  
Can power the strongest hurricane  
What if it all begins inside  
We hold the key that turns the tide  
  
Chorus  
Just a pebble in the water ohh  
Can set the sea in motion ohh  
A simple act of kindness ohh  
Can stir the widest ocean  
If we show a little love  
Heaven knows what we could change oh yeah  
So throw a pebble in the water oh yeah  
And make a wave make a wave  
Make a wave make a wave  
  
The single joys that you take and send  
And you can thrust your hand with someone in need help somebody  
Dont fool yourself and say you cant  
You never know what can grow from just one seed yeah  
  
So come with me and seize the day  
This world may never be the same  
  
Chorus  
Just a pebble in the water  
Just a pebble in the water  
Can set the sea in motion  
Can set the sea in motion  
A simple act of kindness ohh  
Can stir the widest ocean  
If we show a little love  
If we show a little love  
Heaven knows what we can change  
Heaven knows what we can change  
So throw a pebble in the water  
So throw a pebble in the water  
Make a wave make a wave  
  
Just show a little love  
You never know what we can change  
Just throw a pebble in the water ohh  
Make a wave make a wave
