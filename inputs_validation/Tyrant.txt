Behold tis I the commander  
Whose grip controls you all  
Resist me not surrender  
Ill no compassion call  
  
Tyrant Capture of humanity  
Tyrant Conqueror of all  
Tyrant Hideous destructor  
Tyrant Every man shall fall  
  
Your very lives are held within my fingers  
I snap them and you cower down in fear  
You spineless things who belly down to slither  
To the end of the world you follow to be near  
  
Tyrant Capture of humanity  
Tyrant Conqueror of all  
Tyrant Hideous destructor  
Tyrant Every man shall fall  
  
Mourn for us oppressed in fear  
Chained and shackled we are bound  
Freedom choked in dread we live  
Since Tyrant was enthroned  
  
I listen not to sympathy  
Whilst ruler of this land  
Withdraw your feeble aches and moans  
Or suffer smite from this my hand  
  
Tyrant Capture of humanity  
Tyrant Conqueror of all  
Tyrant Hideous destructor  
Tyrant Every man shall fall  
  
Mourn for us oppressed in fear  
Chained and shackled we are bound  
Freedom choked in dread we live  
Since Tyrant was enthroned  
  
My legions faithful unto death  
Ill summon to my court  
And as you perish each of you  
Shall scream as you are sought  
  
Tyrant Capture of humanity  
Tyrant Conqueror of all  
Tyrant Hideous destructor  
Tyrant Every man shall fall
