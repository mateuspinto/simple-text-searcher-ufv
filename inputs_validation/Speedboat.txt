Julie said we drink far too much coffee  
Wine and cigarettes and we never get no sleep  
I first met them at a riverboat party  
Both of them were speeding I would say  
  
I lived on the edge of all this indulgence  
Taking notes and trusting in prudence  
Julie said to jim why dont we jump in  
While the water is cool and we are still friends  
  
Some say that they odd on leonard cohen  
Well I can see that river whenever I think about them  
The river is cruel and the water is deep and blue  
I was working then on my great unfinished novel  
  
please let introduce myself my name is ronald  
I was okay there until I lost my cool  
Now let me introduce you to the rest of the crew  
It wasnt my style to find surf in my eye  
  
It was much more my style to find sand in my eyes  
Though there is absolutely no truth to be discovered  
Albeit truth then is nothing to be found  
We academics are not easily discouraged  
  
Lloyd you know wits they come three to the pound  
Julie said to jim look at the state were in  
It was never her intention to conclude anything  
It wasnt my style to find surf in my eye  
  
It was much more my style to find sand in my eyes  
It was just not my style to find surf in my eye  
It was much more my style to get sand kicked in my eyes  
Sand in my eyes
