Every day I walk out in this torn up world  
And I fight to survive  
Im laughing when I make it to the Saturday  
And Im alive  
Carrying your smile with me  
Carrying your smile with me  
  
Everywhere I look I see this world slippin down  
That low road day by day  
And I just go on working for the things I need  
And making my own way  
Carrying your smile with me oh yea  
Carrying your smile with me  
  
Take a walk on the troubled side of this old town  
Take a walk on the broken streets and the buildings falling down  
Look at all these kids with nothing but trouble in their eyes  
Trouble in their future trouble in their lives  
  
Some bridges are falling down  
Some bridges are still around  
  
Take a walk on the shaded uptown avenue  
Some people are doing well no matter how they do  
And I know theres more to life than what you own  
But I see so many good things things Ive never known  
  
Some bridges are falling down  
Some bridges are still around  
  
Every night I listen to the sound of the street  
Lying in my bed  
I love to see the dreams that are dancing there  
In the light above your head  
And sometimes I get so weary  
And when hope is caving in  
You fill me with your love and your laughter baby  
Until I get back up again  
  
Carrying your smile with me  
Take a walk on the streets of this divided town  
Carrying your smile with me  
Take a walk on the smoking edge of the battleground  
Carrying your smile with me  
Take a look at the situation the poverty and the desperation  
Take the time for the realization  
Everyday Im carrying your smile with me  
Take a walk in the daylight  
Carrying your smile with me  
Some bridges are falling down  
Carrying your smile with me  
Some bridges are still around
