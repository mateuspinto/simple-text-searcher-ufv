Los Angelenos  
All come from somewhere  
To live in sunshine  
Their funky exile  
Midwestern ladies  
Highheeled and faded  
Drivin sleek new sports cars  
With their New York cowboys  
  
Hiding up in the mountains  
Laying low in the canyons  
Goin nowhere on the streets  
With their Spanish names  
Makin love with the natives  
In their Hollywood places  
Making up for all the time gone by  
  
Los Angelenos  
All come from somewhere  
Cause its all so easy  
To become acquainted  
Electric babies  
Bluejeaned and jaded  
Such hot sweet schoolgirls  
So educated  
  
Tanning out in the beaches  
With their Mexican reefers  
No one ever has to feel  
Like a refugee  
Going into garages  
For exotic massages  
Making up for all the time gone by  
  
Hiding up in the mountains  
Laying low in the canyons  
Goin nowhere on the streets  
With the Spanish names  
Makin love with the natives  
In their Hollywood places  
Making up for all the time gone by  
Los Angelenos  
All come from somewhere  
Its so familiar  
Their foreign faces
