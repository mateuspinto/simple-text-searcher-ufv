One year two years time goes by  
People laugh and people cry  
Every morning the clock strikes eight  
I go to work  
I close the gate  
And on my way I sing a song  
About my wife where I belong  
  
If the clouds get together and talk about the weather  
If its rain they anticipate  
Baby make no mistake  
Yes the storm will break but never me you see  
Two years on two years on  
But only you can see me  
Only you can see me  
  
For what Ive got  
Sir Lancelot was just a dream and I am not  
For I am he with something more  
Its you and I reality  
  
If the cloud get together and talk about the weather  
If its rain they anticipate  
Baby make no mistake  
Yes the storm will break but never me you see  
Two years on two years on  
But only you can see me  
Only you can see me  
  
Two years on two years on
