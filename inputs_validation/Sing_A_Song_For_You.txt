In my heart is where I long for you  
In my smile I search for you  
Each time you turn and run away I cry inside  
My silly way just too young to know any more  
  
In my world the devil dances and dares  
To leave my soul just anywhere  
Until I find peace in this world  
Ill sing a song everywhere I can  
Just too young to know any more  
  
The wind covers me cold  
The starry skies all around my eyes  
Far behind the city moans  
Well worthy of the people there  
Oh the psalms they love to hear  
  
So let me sing a song for you  
Just to help your day along  
Let me sing a song for you  
One Ive known so very long  
Oh please could you find the time
