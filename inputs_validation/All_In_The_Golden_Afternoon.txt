All in the golden afternoon full leisurely we glide  
For both our oars with little skill by little arms are plied  
While little hands make vain pretence our wanderings to guide  
Ah cruel three in such an hour beneath such dreamy wheather  
To beg a tale of breath too weak to stir the tiniest feather  
And what can one poor voice avail against three tongues together  
Anon to sudden silence won in fancy they pursue  
The dream child moving through a land of wonders wild and new  
  
In friendly chat with bird or beast and half believe it true  
And ever as the story drained the wells of fancy dry and faintly strove that
weary one to put the subject by  
The next time it is next time the happy voices cry  
Thus grew the tale of wonderland thus slowly one by one  
Its quaint events were hammered out  
And now the tale is done and home we steer  
A merry crew  
Beneath the setting sun
