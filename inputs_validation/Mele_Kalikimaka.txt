Mele Kalikimaka is the thing to say  
On a bright Hawaiian Christmas Day  
Thats the island greeting that we send to you  
From the land where palm trees sway  
Here we know that Christmas will be green and bright  
The sun to shine by day and all the stars at night  
Mele Kalikimaka is Hawaiis way  
To say Merry Christmas to you
