I take a bottle of wine and I go drink it among the flowers  
We are allways three  counting my shadow and my friend the shimmering moon  
Happily the moon knows nothing of drinking and my shadow is never thirsty  
When I sing the moon listens to me in silence When I dance my shadow dances
too  
After all festivities the guests must depart This sadness I do not know  
When I go home the moon goes with me and my shadow follows me
