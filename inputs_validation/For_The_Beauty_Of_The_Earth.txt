For the beauty of the earth  
For the beauty of the skies  
For the love which from our birth  
Over and around us lies  
Lord of all to thee we raise  
This our grateful hymn of praise  
  
For the beauty of each hour  
Of the day and of the night  
Hill and vale and tree and flower  
Sun and moon and stars of light  
Lord of all to thee we raise  
This our grateful hymn of praise  
  
For the joy of human love  
Brother sister parent child  
Friends on earth and friends above  
Pleasures pure and undefiled  
Lord of all to thee we raise  
This our grateful hymn of praise  
  
For each perfect gift of thine  
To our race so freely given  
Graces human and divine  
Flowers of earth and buds of heaven  
Lord of all to thee we raise  
This our grateful hymn of praise  
  
For thy Church which evermore  
Lifteth holy hands above  
Offering up on every shore  
Her pure sacrifice of love  
Lord of all to thee we raise  
This our grateful hymn of praise
