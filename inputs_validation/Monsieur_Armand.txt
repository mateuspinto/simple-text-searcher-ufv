The bell on my door rang this morning  
From the kitchen I called whos that there  
Through the letter box came a grappling hook  
Which grappled me right out of my chair  
Stretched out on the floor I lay helpless  
Of my limbs I had lost all command  
When into my ear in stilling fear  
Said a voice I am Monsieur R Monde  
Monsieur are Monde you are not  
Thats an incredible thing to say  
Why I personally attended his funeral  
Which was twelve months to this very day  
A rat flew down from the ceiling  
Alighted upon my right ear  
Said if Monsieur are Monde is safe under the sod  
Then why are you shaking with fear  
My name is not Scrooge I said faintly  
And from ghosts I have nothing to fear  
But if you are are Monde returned from the dead  
Then what are you wanting here  
From nowhere I heard a mad cackle  
From nowhere a voice to me cried  
Stop calling me Monsieur are Monde you fool  
My names Jeckyll and youre Mr Hyde
