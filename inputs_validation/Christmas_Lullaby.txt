This is a Christmas Lullaby  
To steal softly into dreaming  
A simple Christmas lullaby  
I sing to you each passing year  
The world is wrapped in joy and wonder in silent mystery  
And in this spell that we are under  
Blessing surround our hearts completely  
This is a Christmas Lullaby  
For someone lovely as snow falling  
I sing your Christmas Lullaby  
To cradle you with all our love  
Let peace on earth be yours tonight  
Under the star that shines so bright  
The world is wrapped in joy and wonder  
In Silent mystery  
And in this spell that we are under  
Blessing surround our hearts completely  
Now close your eyes and as you sigh  
Make up a Christmas wish to dream on  
And like the moon that shines on high  
Send out your wish to that star in the sky  
Blessed by this Christmas lullaby
