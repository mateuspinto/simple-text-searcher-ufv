I want to be a better man  
Lord knows that Im trying  
I want to keep the masters plan  
But sometimes things get wild  
Demons sleep with me in bed  
I can feel their fire  
When darkness gets around my head  
Sometimes I go blind  
  
But you were in my heart  
While the evil eye was searching out was staring at me  
But you were in my heart  
While the maids of doom were reaching out and tempting me  
  
The world can give you everything  
Anything you want  
Money fame  
And all it brings  
Whatever turns you on  
But your bloods running through my veins  
And I am standing tall  
But even though you took my place  
You are somehow bound to fall  
  
But you were in my heart  
While the evil eye was searching out was staring at me  
But you were in my heart  
While the maids of doom were reaching out and tempting me
