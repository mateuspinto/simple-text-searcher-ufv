Autumn winds are blowing free  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Leaves fall down from evry tree  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Red and yellow gold and brown  
Softly leaves come tumbling down  
Autumn winds are blowing free  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
  
Autumn winds are whistling round  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Leaves go spinning to the ground  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Big or little all will fall  
As they heed the windy call  
Autumn winds are whistling round  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
