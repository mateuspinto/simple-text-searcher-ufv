When our hearts were young  
We put our hands into the flames  
Felt the heat from our emotions  
We had fire in our veins  
All those night wed spend  
Alone in your room  
Though my silent thoughts  
I still remember  
We would use the power of love  
Free our souls in endless love  
We would sacrifice  
Our hopes and dreams  
Because without love  
Our world would surely die  
When our hearts were young  
We never thought that  
Life would change  
Now the seasons go on  
Oh why do we shelter from the rain  
And all those nights wed spend  
Alone in your room  
Through my silent thoughts  
I still remember  
When our hearts were young  
We had fire in our veins  
And each time we touched  
Wed melt in the flames  
When our hearts were young  
We knew pleasure we knew plain  
But each time we kissed  
Wed burn in the flames  
Feel the fire in our veins  
When our hearts were young
