Words and music by rick nielsen  
  
Dont call me baby  
Dont call me your inspiration  
Dont call me jealous  
I dont need you  
Dont try to use me  
You can use your own imagination  
Just a little bit of information before I leave you  
  
You gotta go for the throat you can use your own imagination  
You gotta do it alone just a little bit of information  
I am what I am you can use your own imagination  
When I go for the throat  
  
Dont try to please me  
You just give me idle conversation  
Doesnt give me any indication or reason  
Dont try to use me  
You can use your own imagination  
Must be some sort of explanation or reason  
  
And I go for the throat you just give me idle conversation  
And I do it alone you can use your own imagination  
And I am what I am must be some sort of explanation  
When I go for the throat  
  
If I say it again would you listen to me  
If I shout it this time  
If I say it again would you listen to me  
If I shout it this time  
  
Get a grip on yourself try to do it in time  
Gotta say to yourself  
If I say it again would you listen to me  
If I shout it this time  
  
I cant stand it no more you can use your own imagination  
I go for the throat just a little bit of information  
I do it alone you just give me idle conversation  
I am what I am you can use your own imagination  
cause I go for the throat must be some sort of explanation  
I cant stand it no more you can use your own imagination  
I am what I am just a little bit of information  
I do it alone you just give me idle conversation  
cause I go for the throat must be some sort of explanation  
I am what I am just a little bit of information  
I do it alone you just give me idle conversation
