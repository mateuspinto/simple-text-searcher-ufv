Can you tell me is there anyone out there  
Can you hear me calling you  
If you hear will you listen  
Is that too much to ask you to do  
Ive been searching for someone to care  
Ooh Lord is there anyone out there  
Will you help me I need someone to talk to  
A brother who I can rely on  
Whose not hard to relate to  
No I dont need a shoulder to cry on  
All I need is someone with sometime to spare  
Yeah I just ask is there anyone out there  
  
Chorus  
Wow if I sing will you sing will you sing out with me  
Cause Im down  
I dont think theres no way to be  
So if you there will you answer answer all my call  
Tell me is there anyone out there at all  
  
Com on and help me  
Is there anyone out there  
Can you give me a moment or two  
Take the time out to meet me  
All I want to do please is lay some good friendship on you  
I got so much I want to share I want to share  
Is there anyone out there  
  
Chorus  
  
Please help me Lord I need someone to talk to  
Like a brother who I can rely on  
Yeahwhose not hard to relate to  
I dont need a shoulder to cry on  
All I need is someone with just a little time to spare  
Lord have mercy  
Is there anyone out there
