Some days I feel sad and lonely  
Some days I feel fine  
Some days the clock just ticks too slowly  
And I wish away my time  
  
But when you come to me  
I realize how wonderful this life can be  
With you you and me  
  
Some days I get so psychotic  
And some days I am blue  
Some days I sip my gin and tonic  
And I wonder what the world will do  
  
chorus  
Some days I think I just fell from the sky  
Some days I see a child and start to cry  
But everyday I try  
  
Some days I am virtuous  
More days I am bad  
Some days I just cant get enough  
Of the sweetest thing Ive ever had  
  
Chorus
