Nobody cares  
about ocean affairs  
Hes by himself cause nobody loves him  
Cleaning his sand  
Filled boots with his hand  
Looking for something but nothing sees him  
  
Happy was he  
in spite of his knee  
That wasnt there because of his day job  
There was a man  
who took to the band  
paying attention tried to adhere him  
  
And he ran  
And he shot  
But his rivals were sharp  
And the kids  
in the sand  
struggled finding a plan  
  
Seemingly fine  
he slipped on his wine  
Terra was healthy but not on a mission  
  
There was a sea  
A mythical tease  
Our cannons were shot  
til we couldnt afford them  
  
Others would have died alone  
Angels all worked free  
Timeless fairs and singalongs  
Speaking naturally  
  
And he ran  
And he shot  
But his rivals were sharp  
And the kids  
in the sand  
struggled deep hand in hand  
All the way  
from the bay  
I could hear them say  
All the time  
we were dead  
And Im Cap Splendid  
  
And he ran  
And he shot  
But his rivals were sharp  
And the kids  
in the sand  
struggled deep hand in hand  
All the way  
from the bay  
I could hear them say  
I dont care  
if were dead  
And Im Cap Splendid
