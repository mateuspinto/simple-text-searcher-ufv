Hey girl  
Take off your makeup  
I know you wanna  
Look beautiful for him  
But  
If he really loved you  
He would love you the same  
  
Chorus  
Girl  
You could have  
A closet full of clothes  
You could have  
A million dollars  
You could have 10 000 roses  
But in the end  
Hell still love you  
For you  
If hes true  
  
Girl  
You dont have to wear  
Fancy clothes and  
Diamond rings  
You should be yourself  
Not someone youre not  
He will love you in the end  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah  
A closet full of clothes  
A million dollars  
10 000 roses  
Fancy clothes  
Diamond rings  
He will love you without it  
  
Chorus  
  
La la la  
La la la  
La la la  
Ah ah  
Oh yeah  
La la la  
La la la  
La la la  
Hey ay  
  
Fades
