Friday night I crashed your party  
Saturday I said Im sorry  
Sunday came and trashed me out again  
I was only having fun  
Wasnt hurting any one  
And we all enjoyed the weekend for a change  
  
I was stranded in the combat zone  
I walked through Bedford Stuy alone  
Even rode my motorcycle in the rain  
And you told me not to drive  
But I made it home alive  
So you said that only proves that Im insane  
  
You may be right  
I may be crazy  
But it just may be a lunatic youre looking for  
Turn out the light  
Dont try to save me  
You may be wrong for all I know  
But you may be right  
  
Remember how I found you there  
Alone in your electric chair  
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled  
You were lonely for a man  
I said take me as I am  
Cause you might enjoy some madness for a while  
  
Now think of all the years you tried to  
Find someone to satisfy you  
I might be as crazy as you say  
If Im crazy then its true  
That its all because of you  
And you wouldnt want me any other way  
  
You may be right  
I may be crazy  
But it just may be a lunatic youre looking for  
Its too late to fight  
Its too late to change me  
You may be wrong for all I know  
But you may be right  
  
You may be right  
I may be crazy  
But it just may be a lunatic youre looking for  
Turn out the light  
Dont try to save me  
You may be wrong for all I know  
But you may be right  
You may be wrong but you may be right  
You may be wrong but you may be right
