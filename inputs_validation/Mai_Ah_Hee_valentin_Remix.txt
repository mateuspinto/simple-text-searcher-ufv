Hello Salute its me your duke  
And I made something thats real to show you how I feel  
Hello hello its me picasso  
I will paint my words of love with your name on every wall  
  
When you leave my colors fade to gray  
I need a love to stay or  
All my colors fade away  
Every word of love I used to say  
Now I paint it every day

My soul My strings my songs and dreams  
And I bought some pants to match the colors of my love  
Hello hello its me picasso  
I will spray my words of love  
With your name on every wall  
  
When you leave my colors fade to gray  
I beg you to stay  
Or all my colors fade away  
Every word of love I used to say  
Now I paint them every day
