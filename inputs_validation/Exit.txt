You know he got the cure  
You know he went astray  
He used to stay awake  
To drive the dreams he had away  
He wanted to believe  
In the hands of love  
  
His head it felt heavy  
As he cut across the land  
A dog started crying  
Like a broken hearted man  
At the howling wind  
At the howling wind  
  
He went deeper into black  
Deeper into white  
Could see the stars shining  
Like nails in the night  
He felt the healing  
Healing healing  
Healing hands of love  
Like the stars shiny shiny  
From above  
  
Hand in the pocket  
Finger on the steel  
The pistol weighed heavy  
His heart he could feel  
Was beating beating  
Beating beating oh my love  
Oh my love oh my love  
Oh my love  
  
My love  
  
Saw the hands that build  
Can also pull down  
  
The hands of love
