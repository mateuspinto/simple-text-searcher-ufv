Strip club and dollar bills

Patron shots can I get a refill  
I still got my money  
Strippers goin up and down that pole  
And I still got my money  
Four oclock and we aint going home  
Cause I still got my money  
Money make the world go around  
I still got my money  
Bands make your girl go down  
And I still got my money

The look in your eyes I know you want some  
I still got my money

All I see is signs  
All I see is dollar signs

Money on my mind

Throw it up throw it up  
Watch it all fall out

Valet cost a hundred bills

Gold all up in my grill

Who cares how you haters feel  
And I still got my money  
Call Jay up and close the deal  
Cause I still got my money  
My fragrance on and they love my smell  
I still got my money  
So who cares about what I spend  
I still got my money  
My pockets deep and they never end  
I still got my money  
Im going dumb with all my friends  
I still got my money  
  
Ohh
