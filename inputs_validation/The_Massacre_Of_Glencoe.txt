Chorus  
O cruel is the snow  
That sweeps glencoe  
And covers the grave o donald  
And cruel was the foe  
That raped glencoe  
And murderd the house of  
Macdonald  
  
They came in a blizzard  
We offered them heat  
A roof oer their heads  
Dry shoes for their feet  
We wined them and dined them  
They ate of our meat  
And they slept in the house of  
Macdonald  
  
Chorus  
  
They came from fort william  
Wi murder in mind  
The campbells had orders  
King william had signed  
Put all to the sword  
These words were underlined  
And leave none alive called  
Macdonald  
  
Chorus  
  
They came in the night  
When the men were asleep  
This band o argyles  
Through snow soft and deep  
Like murdering foxes  
Among helpless sheep  
They slaughtered the house of  
Macdonald  
  
Chorus  
  
Some died in their beds  
At the hand of the foe  
Some fled in the night  
And were lost in the snow  
Some lived to accuse him  
That struck the first blow  
But gone was the house of  
Macdonald
