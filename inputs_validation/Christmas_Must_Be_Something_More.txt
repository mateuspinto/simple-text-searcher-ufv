What if ribbons and bows didnt mean a thing  
Would the song still survive without five golden rings  
Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe  
What would happen if God never let it snow  
What would happen if Christmas carols told a lie  
Tell me what would you find  
  
Youd see that today holds something special  
Something holy not superficial  
So heres to the birthday boy who saved our lives  
Its something we all try to ignore  
And put a wreath up on your door  
So heres something you should know that is for sure  
Christmas must be something more  
  
What if angels did not pay attention to  
All the things that we wished they would always do  
What if happiness came in a cardboard box  
Then I think there is something we all forgot  
What would happen if presents all went away  
Tell me what would you find  
  
Youd see that today holds something special  
Something holy not superficial  
So heres to the birthday boy who saved our lives  
Its something we all try to ignore  
And put a wreath up on your door  
So heres something you should know that is for sure  
Christmas must be something more  
  
We get so caught up in all of it  
Business and relationships  
Hundred mile an hour lives  
And its this time of year  
And everybodys here  
It seems the last thing on your mind  
  
Is that the day holds something special  
Something holy not superficial  
So heres to Jesus Christ who saved our lives  
Its something we all try to ignore  
And put a wreath up on your door  
But heres something you should know that is for sure  
Christmas must be something  
Christmas must be something  
Christmas must be something more  
  
Theres gotta be more  
Theres gotta be more
