The memories of a man in his old age  
Are the deeds of a man in his prime  
You shuffle in gloom of the sickroom  
And talk to yourself as you die  
  
Life is a short warm moment  
And death is a long cold rest  
You get your chance to try in the twinkling of an eye  
Eighty years with luck or even less  
  
So all aboard for the American tour  
And maybe youll make it to the top  
And mind how you go and I can tell you cause I know  
You may find it hard to get off  
  
You are the angel of death  
And I am the dead mans son  
And he was buried like a mole in a fox hole  
And everyone is still in the run  
  
And who is the master of fox hounds  
And who says the hunt has begun  
And who calls the tune in the courtroom  
And who beats the funeral drum  
  
The memories of a man in his old age  
Are the deeds of a man in his prime  
You shuffle in gloom in the sickroom  
And talk to yourself till you die
