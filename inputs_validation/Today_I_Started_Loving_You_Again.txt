Today I started loving you again Im right back where Ive really always been  
I got over you just long enough to let my heartaches mend  
And then today I started loving you again  
What a fool I was to think I could get by with only these few million tears
Ive cried  
I should have known the worst was yet to come  
And that crying time for me had just begun  
Today I started loving you again  
Yes today I started loving you again
