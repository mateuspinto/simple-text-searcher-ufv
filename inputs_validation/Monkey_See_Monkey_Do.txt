intro  
laughing  
Ay yo 50  
What I tell you  
We aint even have to say shit  
They did it  
laughing  
  
chorus  
Monkey see monkey do  
Dont ever make the first move  
Just let em come to you  
Cause they always gunna see and do what the other one do  
So let em come to you  
The rest of us follow suit  
Monkey see monkey do  
Tweedledetweedledumb  
If they really want it bad enough well then they gunna come  
Now here they come as we expected now we just set em up  
Checkmate motherfucker  
Games over  
We won  
Tweedledetweedledumb  
  
It doesnt take much  
For me to raise such a stink up  
When motherfuckers hate your guts  
You aint even gotta say much  
For me to put a pen to a blank sheet of papers  
Like smearing blood stains with a paint brush  
I cant explain what it is my brain does  
But however it works its insane  
Its plain nutz  
And it aint just my brain thas dangerous  
Its a whole combination of things  
It takes nutz  
And Im not affriad to raise the stakes up  
I got a million bucks in the banks and 8 trucks  
For anybody who gets on the track and spanks us  
Im patiently waiting for the day  
Im anxious  
To see the look on ya fake mugs  
When you thugs go bankrupt  
Ya drunk  
Ya aint tough  
Whatever you drank musta just turned ya into some gangstas  
This is me talking motherfucker  
This aint drugs  
You wanna pop shit wakeup then makeup  
FUCK THAT  
Its too late chump now face up  
I pray for the day that someone who spits with the calliber that nas and jay
does  
Opens up his jaw to say something or rattle my name off  
Or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off  
So I can blow the fuckin dust off of this chainsaw  
And give him the surgery that he came for  
Till I pull the paint off  
I never been shot  
But I think me and 50 musta been cut from the same cloth  
Cause Ive always came off  
Like jas chain  
When they try to rush him and lost  
And came back and gave him a watch in exchange for it  
I dont stop  
The only thing I wait for  
Is day that I dont gotta report to probate court  
Cause ima give ya all the reason to hate more  
Cause Ive been holding my tongue till I got a sprained jaw  
A lot of rappers on my list that just aint ja  
And ima read that motherfucker off from April  
You pussies think I went soft since 8 mile  
When I come back ill be shootin more than just paint balls  
Trust me  
  
chorus  
Monkey see monkey do  
Dont ever make the first move  
Just let em come to you  
Cause they always gunna see and do what the other one do  
So let em come to you  
The rest of us follow suit  
Monkey see monkey do  
Tweedledetweedledumb  
If they really want it bad enough well then they gunna come  
Now here they come as we expected now we just set em up
