Dont interrupt the sorrow  
Darn right  
In flames our prophet witches  
Be polite  
A room full of glasses  
He says Your notches liberation doll  
And he chains me with that serpent  
To that Ethiopian wall  
  
Anima rising  
Queen of Queens  
Wash my guilt of Eden  
Wash and balance me  
Anima rising  
Uprising in me tonight  
Shes a vengeful little goddess  
With an ancient crown to fight  
  
Truth goes up in vapors  
The steeples lean  
Winds of change patriarchs  
Snug in your bible belt dreams  
God goes up the chimney  
Like childhood Santa Claus  
The good slaves love the good book  
A rebel loves a cause  
  
Im leaving on the 115  
Youre darn right  
Since I was seventeen  
Ive had no one over me  
He says Anima rising  
So what  
Petrified wood process  
Tall timber down to rock  
  
Dont interrupt the sorrow  
Darn right  
He says We walked on the moon  
You be polite  
Dont let up the sorrow  
Death and birth and death and birth  
He says Bring that bottle kindly  
And Ill pad your purse  
Ive got a head full of quandary  
And a mighty mighty thirst  
  
Seventeen glasses  
Rhine wine  
Milk of the Madonna  
Clandestine  
He dont let up the sorrow  
He lies and he cheats  
It takes a heart like Marys these days  
When your man gets weak
