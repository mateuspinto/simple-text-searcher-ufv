In the valley of the unknown  
I will lift my voice  
In the shifting in the shadow  
I know You are with me  
  
Lord over all  
You will be my rescue  
You will never fail  
Lord through it all  
I will choose to trust You  
You will never fail  
  
In the searching and the waiting  
You quiet my soul  
In the stillness of Your presence  
I know You are with me  
  
Out of this darkness  
Into Your promise  
You will deliver me  
Eternal Savior  
You stand forever  
You are my victory
