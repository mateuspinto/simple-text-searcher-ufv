Wise men say  
Wise men say  
Wise men say  
Never figure out real love  
Youll never figure out real love  
Youll never figure out real love  
  
Its so crazy  
I got everything figured out  
But for some reason I can never find what real love is about  
No doubt  
Everything in the world figured out but I can never seem to find what love is
about  
  
Do you think I sacrificed real life  
For all the fame of flashing lights  
Do you think I sacrifice a real life  
For all the fame of flashing lights  
  
There is no Gucci I can buy  
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on  
There is no YSL that they could sell  
To get my heart out of this hell  
And my mind out of this jail  
There is no clothes that I could buy  
That could turn back the time  
There is no vacation spot I could fly  
That could bring back a piece of real life  
Real life what does it feel like  
I ask you tonight I ask you tonight  
What does it feel like I ask you tonight  
To live a real life  
I just want to be a real boy  
They always say Kanye he keeps it real boy  
Pinocchio story is I just want to be a real boy  
Pinocchio story is to be a real boy  
  
Its funny Pinocchio lied and thats what kept him from it  
I tell the truth and I keep runnin  
Its like Im looking for something out there trying to find something  
I turn on the TV and see me and see nothing  
  
What does it feel like to live real life to be real  
Not some facade on TV that no can really feel  
Do you really have the stamina  
For everybody that sees you to say wheres my camera  
For everybody that sees you to say sign my autograph  
For everybody that sees you cry and say you oughtta laugh  
You oughtta laugh  
I just want to be a real boy  
Pinocchio story goes I just want to be a real boy  
Pinocchio story goes  
  
And there is no Gepetto to guide me no one right beside me  
The only one was behind me I cant find her no more  
I cant find her no more I cant  
The only one that come out on the tour and stay stay stay  
Back when I was living at home and this was all a big dream  
  
And the fame will be got caught  
And the day I moved to LA  
Maybe that was all my fault  
All my fault to be a real boy  
Chasing the American dream  
Chasing everything we seen  
Up on the TV screen  
And when I the Benz was left  
And the clothes was left  
And the hoes was left  
You talk the hoes to death thinkin the money that the  
You spent the doughs to death  
And tell me what tf for a real boy  
  
They say Kanye you keep it to real boy  
Perspective and Wise man say one day youll find your way  
The wise man say youll find your way  
The wise man say youll find your way  
The wise man say
