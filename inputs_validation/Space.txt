You push hard you stop my circulation  
I know you really need a physical relation  
We may not be a perfect combination  
You need your love I need my mental stimulation  
  
If Im not there defend my reputation  
Well that dont mean that theres a real negotiation  
Take a longer look this could be privacy invasion  
What makes you think youve got that fascination  
I need space oh oh  
Come back some other time and place  
I need some more space  
I need some  
  
I know youre burnin with anticipation  
Hold on here comes your education  
Make sure its love not just infatuation  
Tell me why you always lead me to that destination  
  
I need space oh oh  
Come back some other time and place  
I need some more space  
I need some  
I need some  
Ooohhhh I need some  
Ooohhhh I need some  
  
You push hard you stop my circulation  
I know you really need a physical relation  
We may not be a perfect combination  
You need your love I need my mental stimulation  
  
I need space oh oh  
Come back some other time and place  
I need some more space  
I need some  
  
I need space oh oh  
Come back some other time and place  
I need some more space  
I need some  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
  
I need some space  
I need some space  
I need some space
