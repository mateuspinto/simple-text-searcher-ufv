Lindy strolls around  
  
Down main streets  
Down side streets  
Makin his way through town he picks up pennies  
Saves em for a rainy day  
With callous feet he makes his way to see the sun sink in the bay  
  
Lindy strolls around and around and around  
Around and around and around  
He plays piano at the church when nobodys watchin  
Takes cigarettes from strangers and sometimes you see Him talkin  
To himself laughin to himself  
Lindy strolls around and around and around  
  
Lindys seen it all  
Storms and hurricanes  
Some say hes insane  
No one knows his last name  
But I believe  
Hes the salt of the Earth  
Just look past his dirty shirt and you will see just what hes worth  
  
Lindy strolls around and around and around  
Around and around and around  
He plays piano at the church when nobodys watchin  
Takes cigarettes from strangers and sometimes you see  
Him talkin to himself laughin to himself  
Lindy strolls around and around and around  
Around and around and around  
  
Ooh  
  
He plays piano at the church when nobodys watchin  
Takes cigarettes from strangers and sometimes you see  
Him talkin to himself laughin to himself  
Lindy strolls around and around and around  
Around and around and around  
  
Lindy strolls around and around and around  
  
Ooh
