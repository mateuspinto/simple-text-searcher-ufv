Ill walk halfway around the world  
Just to sit down by your side  
And I would do most anything girl  
To be the apple of your eye  
Well troubles they may come and go  
But good times theyre the gold  
And if the road gets rocky girl  
Just steady as we go  
  
Any place you wanna go  
Know Ill be next to you  
If its treasure baby youre looking for  
Ill search the whole world through  
I know troubles they may come and go  
But good times theyre the gold  
So if the road gets rocky girl  
Just steady as we go  
  
When the storm comes down you shelter me  
When I dont say a word and you know exactly what I mean  
In the darkest times oh you shine on me  
You set me free and keep me steady as we go  
  
So if your heart wrings dry my love  
I will fill your cup  
And if your load gets heavy girl  
I will lift you up  
Well troubles they may come and go  
But good times be the gold  
So if the road gets rocky girl  
Just steady as we go  
  
Shine shine shine  
Shine on me
