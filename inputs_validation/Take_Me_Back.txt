Take me back  
Take me back where I belong  
Thats with you baby  
Ah take me back  
Take me back where I belong  
Thats with you baby  
  
I thought the grass was green on the other side  
Thought the sun shone brighter without saying goodbye  
Theres a card in my hand  
Tears fall like rain  
I want to come home again  
I want you to  
  
Take me back  
Take me back where I belong  
Thats with you baby  
Take me back  
Take me back where I belong  
Thats with you baby  
Aint no love in this world  
Aint no love in this world without you  
  
In my search to find myself  
I saw your face and nothing else  
Every place I go everything I do  
I still feel the need for you  
Come on and  
  
Take me back  
Take me back where I belong  
Thats with you baby  
Ah take me back  
Take me back where I belong  
Thats with you baby  
  
Im on my way back to you  
And I want to make it up to you  
And all the problems that I caused you  
If ti takes my life Ill make it up to you  
I just want you to take me take me  
Take me take me take me take me  
  
Take me back forgive me  
Take me back where I belong  
If you can if you can find it  
In your heart to forgive me
