Inspired by Dinah Washingtons 1955 recording of a song introduced by Rudy
Vallee in 1928  
I could show the world how to smile  
I could be glad all of the while  
I could change the gray skies to blue  
If I had you  
I could leave the old days behind  
Leave all my pals Id never mind  
I could start my life anew  
If I had you  
I could climb a snowcapped mountain  
Sail the mighty ocean wide  
I could cross the burning desert  
If I had you by my side  
I could be a king dear uncrowned  
Humble or poor rich or renowned  
There is nothin I couldnt do  
If I had you  
Instrumental  first two verses  
I could climb a snowcapped mountain  
Sail the mighty ocean wide  
I could cross the burnin desert  
If I had you by my side  
I could be a king uncrowned  
Humble or poor rich or renowned  
There is nothin I couldnt do  
If I had you  
Baby if I had you
