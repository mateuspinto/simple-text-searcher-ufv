If I had my way  
I would move to another lifetime  
Id quit my job  
Ride the train through the misty nighttime  
Ill be ready when my feet touch ground  
Wherever I come down  
And if the folks will have me  
Then theyll have me  
  
Chorus  
Any world that Im welcome to  
Is better than the one I come from  
  
I can hear your words  
When you speak of what you are and have seen  
I can see your hand  
Reaching out through a shining daydream  
Where the days and nights are not the same  
Captured happy in a picture frame  
Honey I will be there  
Yes Ill be there  
  
Chorus  
  
I got this thing inside me  
Thats got to find a place to hide me  
I only know I must obey  
This feeling I cant explain away  
  
I think Ill go to the park  
Watch the children playing  
Perhaps Ill find in my head  
What my heart is saying  
A vision of a child returning  
A kingdom where the sky is burning  
Honey I will be there  
Yes Ill be there  
  
Chorus
