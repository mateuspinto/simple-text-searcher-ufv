When my memory starts to wander  
I sit back and I ponder  
How the whole worlds gone asunder  
I feel the rain and I hear the thunder  
  
I was bare and I was lost  
But you were there and now Im born  
You are the force and strength  
In my life today  
  
And oh how I thank you father  
For giving us all over and under  
Youre a mystery Youre a wonder  
I always knew since I was younger  
  
I think about the way that you make it right  
So full of love and sacrifice  
I say yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
But you were right and I was wrong yeah  
Cause I was weak but you were strong  
Ohoh hey hey yeah  
You are the force and strength  
In my life today  
  
And now that the darkness has faded  
Im no longer blinded I can see yeah  
And I dont have to wait no longer  
Cause its all about being free  
  
Every day every way  
Im gonna get myself together  
Every day any way ohoh  
  
You are the force and strength  
In my life today yeah  
You are the force and strength  
In my life today yeah  
  
You are the force yeah  
And you are the reign  
You are the force and strength  
In my life today yeah  
  
You are the force and strength  
In my life today  
  
You are the force  
And You are the reign  
You make me try to do right  
And throw away my evil ways  
  
Yeah yeah yeaaah oh yeah  
Come on one more time  
Take me now oh oh oh oh
