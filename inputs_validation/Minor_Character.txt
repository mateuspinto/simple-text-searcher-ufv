Saint christopher sunday otherwise unaware  
That is what she called it  
She arrived was observed with her clothes in his suitcase  
Looking suitably world weary  
As he drove away she came to  
She sat and she waited he did not telephone  
Her heart was unbroken  
She could not let this be known  
She said shed throw herself off a bridge  
He stood and laughed and shewalked out again  
Which was when she wrote me in  
To her scheme of things  
She said shed throw herself off a bridge  
She said she never did and I asked her why  
She just shrugged and she sighed  
And turned her head away  
She did not say  
Saint christopher sunday otherwise uneventful  
Everything never happened  
To her scheme of things  
She said shed throw herself off a bridge  
He stood and laughed and she never did  
She telephoned to say that shed cut her wrists instead  
She beat the walls with her fists  
Running red running back again
