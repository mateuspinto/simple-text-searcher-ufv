If I should write a book for you  
That brought me fame and fortune too  
That book would be like my heart and me  
Dedicated to you  
  
And if I should paint a picture too  
That showed the loveliness of you  
My art would be like my heart and me  
Dedicated to you  
  
To you because your love is  
The beacon that lights up my way  
To you because with you I know  
One lifetime could be just one heavenly place  
  
If I should find a twinkling star  
One half so wondrous as you are  
That star would be like my heart and me  
Dedicated to you  
  
To you because your love is  
A beacon that lights up my way  
To you because with you I know  
One lifetime could be just one heavenly place  
  
If I should find a twinkling star  
One half so wondrous as you are  
That star would be like my heart and me  
Dedicated to you
