Home for the holidays  
I believe Ive missed each and every face  
Come on and play my music  
Lets turn on the love light in the place  
  
Its time I found myself  
Totally surrounded in your circles  
Whoa my friends  
  
Please celebrate me home  
Give me a number  
Please celebrate me home  
Play me one more song  
That Ill always remember  
And I can recall  
Whenever I find myself too all alone  
I can sing me home  
  
Uneasy highway  
Traveling where the Westerly winds can fly  
Somebody tried to tell me  
But the men forgot to tell me why  
  
I gotta count on being gone  
Come on woman come on daddy  
Be what you want from me  
Im this strong Ill be weak  
  
Please celebrate me home  
Give me a number  
Please celebrate me home  
Play me one more song  
That Ill always remember  
I can recall  
Whenever I find myself too all alone  
I can make believe Ive never gone  
I never know where I belong  
Sing me home  
  
Please celebrate me home  
Give me a number  
Please celebrate me home  
Play me one more song  
  
Celebrate celebrate  
Celebrate celebrate  
Celebrate celebrate  
Celebrate me home  
  
Please celebrate me home  
Please celebrate me home  
Well Im finally here  
But Im bound to roam  
Come on celebrate me home  
Well Im finally here  
But Im bound to roam  
Come on celebrate me home  
Well Im finally here  
But Im bound to roam  
Come on celebrate me home  
Please celebrate me home  
Please celebrate me home  
Please celebrate me home  
Please celebrate me home  
Please celebrate me home  
Please celebrate me home
