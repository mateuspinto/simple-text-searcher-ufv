Its like an intuition or a feeling in the air  
An intangible impression thats always everywhere  
You bit into the apple laid down your sword an shield  
Untie A little bit dies a little each time the medicine smile  
Then spun round like a gyre in the unified field  
Inside your elegant guide an arrow in flight a million miles  
  
I remember feeling the opposite of falling  
Into that spot where we untie every knot  
Spinning past the ceiling absolution calling  
Are you there or not  
  
Its an open invitation come see the sights of sages  
Weve been a pride of lions so afraid to leave our cages  
Dont fret over the pieces that smolder in the sun  
Untie A little bit dies a little each time the medicine smile  
Cause nothing can be broken when everything is one  
Inside your elegant guide an arrow in flight a million miles  
  
I remember feeling the opposite of falling  
Into that spot where we untie every knot  
Spinning past the ceiling absolution calling  
Are you there or not  
  
You bit into the apple laid down your sword an shield  
Untie A little bit dies a little each time the medicine smile  
Then spun round like a gyre in the unified field  
Inside your elegant guide an arrow in flight a million miles  
  
I remember feeling the opposite of falling  
Into that spot where we untie every knot  
Spinning past the ceiling absolution calling  
Are you there or not
