Though your vessel be empty  
He will supply  
For His yoke is easy  
He will supply  
He will supply  
He will supply  
Oh Jesus said that he will supply  
  
Though your dreams feel like memories  
He will supply  
And some relationships are now empty  
He will supply  
He will supply  
He will supply  
Oh Jesus said that he will supply  
  
So my friend dont you worry  
He will supply  
This is just temporary  
He will supply  
He will supply  
He will supply  
  
Oh Jesus  
Oh Jesus  
My Jesus  
Sweet Jesus
