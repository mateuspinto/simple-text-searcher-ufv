Love is holy dont forget it  
It will heal you if you let it  
Love will strip you leave you naked  
Love is sexy love is sacred  
  
I put my faith in me and you  
Somehow I know that well put through  
Oh I feel my life passing by  
Sometimes it makes me want to cry  
Thank God Ive got you by my side  
  
Every night I hope and pray  
Nothing takes your love away  
I lie awake just to watch you breathe  
Love is holy when you lay with me  
Love is holy baby stay with me  
  
I dont understand the world today  
Is everything made just to throw away  
But you and I you and I  
Get closer as time goes by till I die  
I feel my love intensify  
Baby youre a spiritual high  
  
Every night I hope and pray  
Nothing takes your love away  
I lie awake just to watch you breathe  
Love is holy when you lay with me  
Love is holy baby stay with me  
  
Love is holy dont forget it  
It will heal you if you let it  
Love will strip you leave you naked  
Love is sexy love is sacred  
  
Every night I hope and pray  
Nothing takes your love away  
I lie awake just to watch you breathe  
Love is holy when you lay with me  
Love is holy baby stay with me  
Every night I hope and pray  
Nothing takes your love away  
I lie awake just to watch you breathe  
Love is holy when you lay with me  
Love is holy baby stay with me
