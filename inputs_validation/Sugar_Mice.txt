I was flicking through the channels on the TV  
On a Sunday in Milwaukee in the rain  
Trying to piece together conversations  
Trying to find out where to lay the blame  
But when it comes right down to it theres no use trying to pretend  
For when it gets right down to it theres no one here thats left to blame  
Blame it on me you can blame it on me  
Were just sugar mice in the rain  
  
I heard Sinatra calling me down through the floorboards  
Where you pay a quarter for a partnership in rhyme  
To the jukebox crying in the corner  
While the waitress is counting out the time  
  
For when it gets right down to it theres no use trying to pretend  
For when it gets right down to it theres no one really left to blame  
Blame it on me you can blame it on me  
Were just sugar mice in the rain  
  
Cause I know what I feel know what I want I know what I am  
Daddy took a raincheck  
Cause I know what I want know what I feel I know what I need  
Daddy took a raincheck your daddy took a raincheck  
Aint no one in here thats left to blame but me  
Blame it on me blame it on me  
  
Well the toughest thing that I ever did was talk to the kids on the phone  
When I heard them asking questions I knew that you were all alone  
Cant you understand that the government left me out of work  
I just couldnt stand the looks on their faces saying What a jerk  
  
So if you want my address its number one at the end of the bar  
Where I sit with the broken angels clutching at straws and nursing our scars  
Blame it on me blame it on me  
Sugar mice in the rain your daddy took a raincheck
