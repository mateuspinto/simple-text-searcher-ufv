Summer rains keep coming down  
Its about to swallow up this town  
You get the feeling that theres trouble ahead  
Folks say theyve never seen  
The river acting quite this mean  
No one can stop it when it needs to be fed  
  
Look at the river  
The powerful river  
Greater Than We Understand  
Awesome in anger  
Crazy with hunger  
Dragging us under  
  
Chorus  
But you have the power  
The power to heal us  
Greater than we understand  
Righteous in anger  
Awesome with wonder  
If we reach out for your hand  
Yeah  
  
To many years since the lava flow  
This old mountains about to blow  
Covering anything that gets in its way  
Not a lot that you can say or do  
When the mountain wants to roll over you  
But gather up the ones you love and start to pray  
  
Look at the mountain  
The powerful mountain  
Greater than we understand  
Awesome in anger  
Crazy with hunger  
Dragging us under  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah x3  
  
But you have the power  
The power to heal us  
Greater than we understand  
Righteous in anger  
Awesome with wonder  
Greater than we understand  
Yeah  
  
As far as you or I can see  
Hard times there will always be  
Thank God for answers to the trouble ahead
