Verse  
Pound me the witch drums the witch drums  
Pound me the witch drums  
Pound me the witch drums the witch drums  
Betta pray for hell not hallelujah  
Im a Coat Of Fists dead and hearted spiders  
Like two mangled crowns on the wires of the meanings  
Cold snakes folks thatll lie look like death  
Live in a hotel of my eyes  
Lies wide open like a whore paid  
Spit from the hells beat pedophile  
  
Chorus  
Keep your halos tight  
Im your god or your guardian  
Keep your halos tight  
One hand on the trigger and the other hand in mine  
Because now Cupid carries a gun  
Now now Cupid Cupid carries a gun  
  
Verse 2  
Pound me the witch drums the witch drums  
Pound me the witch drums  
Pound me the witch drums the witch drums  
Betta pray for hell not hallelujah  
She had those crow black eyes  
Starless but she fucks like a comet  
Laid and still as a bible  
And felt like Revelations when I looked inside  
  
Chorus  
Keep your halos tight  
Im your god or your gaurdian  
Keep your halos tight  
One hand on the trigger and the other hand in mine  
Because now Cupid carries a gun  
Now now Cupid Cupid carries a gun
