Baby now I realize  
All of those times I told you I loved you  
I just didnt show it  
Im sorry  
  
Dont put me out Repeat x10  
  
I remember when you said to me  
Dont talk about it be about it  
I should have felt you when you said  
To me that you were all alone  
I act like I was doin a favor  
For you cause you were wit me  
Something let me thinking that whatever happens  
This would be my home  
But I was wrong I was wrong  
How could I have been so low  
How could i have been so low  
I wrote a song all about it  
Took a pen and wrote a song  
want to hear it here it go from now on  
  
Chorus  
I wont talk about lovin you  
Cause Im gonna be about lovin you  
I wont talk about comin home  
Cause Im gonna be about comin home  
I wont talk about both of us  
Cause Im gonna be about both of us  
I wont talk about makin sweet love  
Cause Im gonna be about makin sweet love  
  
Now I remember when we used the crib in Studio 12A  
Clothes and pallets on the floor makin sweet love night till day  
Used to say I want to have a baby boy and call him Man  
But now its all gone up in smoke and baby I dont understand  
All I know that is I was wrong  
Dead wrong yeah  
How could I have stooped so low  
How could I have stooped so low  
I wrote a song about it  
Wrote a song  
Wrote about it here it go from now on  
  
Chorus  
  
Now all the money in the world couldnt add up to what you did  
cause when I was down and out you took the burden off of me  
I never thoguht that when I took her out somehow itd cause me pain  
I was rooming at the Drake how the hell you found my name  
Damn I was wrong I was wrong  
How could I have stooped so low  
How could I have stooped so low  
I wrote a song yeah  
All about it here it go from now on  
  
Chorus  
  
I wont talk about lovin you  
Cause Im gonna be about lovin you  
  
Girl open up the door and let me in this house please baby  
Im tired of banging on this door the neighbors say Im loud  
Honey I beg of you  
  
Dont put me out Repeat x10
