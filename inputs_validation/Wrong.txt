I was born with the wrong sign  
In the wrong house  
With the wrong ascendancy  
I took the wrong road  
That led to the wrong tendencies  
I was in the wrong place at the wrong time  
For the wrong reason and the wrong rhyme  
On the wrong day of the wrong week  
I used the wrong method with the wrong technique  
  
Wrong  
  
Wrong  
  
Theres something wrong with me chemically  
Something wrong with me inherently  
The wrong mix in the wrong genes  
I reached the wrong ends by the wrong means  
It was the wrong plan  
In the wrong hands  
With the wrong theory for the wrong man  
The wrong lies on the wrong vibes  
The wrong questions with the wrong replies  
  
Wrong  
  
Wrong  
  
I was marching to the wrong drum  
With the wrong scum  
Pissing out the wrong energy  
Using all the wrong lines  
And the wrong signs  
With the wrong intensity  
I was on the wrong page of the wrong book  
With the wrong rendition of the wrong hook  
Made the wrong move every wrong night  
With the wrong tune played till it sounded right yeah  
  
Wrong  
  
Wrong  
  
Too long  
  
Wrong  
  
I was born with the wrong sign  
In the wrong house  
With the wrong ascendancy  
I took the wrong road  
That led to the wrong tendencies  
I was in the wrong place at the wrong time  
For the wrong reason and the wrong rhyme  
On the wrong day of the wrong week  
I used the wrong method with the wrong technique  
  
Wrong
