Cold light descending through curtains of dust  
Torn like the memory of what we wert and what became of us  
Gone with the Evening when morning stares  
Gone and forgotten Iike a photograph  
or the fragments of a dream  
  
Chorus  
Let me know where to find you  
Cive me the chance to find you  
Im Lost on my own in this House of Dust  
Heaven will not receive me  
Nobody will believe me  
Im Lost on my own in this House of Dust  
  
Who tends the garden when Im not there  
Who lights the candle  
through the darkest hours when the world is filled with fear  
I will remember when you were there  
sleeping beside me through the darkest hours  
when the world is bathed in fear  
  
Chorus  
  
Let me know where to find you  
Why should I care to find you  
You left me alone in this House of Dust  
Your heaven will not receive you  
Nobody will believe you  
Im setting the Flame to this House of Dust
