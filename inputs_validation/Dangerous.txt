The way she came into the place  
I knew right then and there  
There was something different  
About this girl  
  
The way she moved  
Her hair her face her lines  
Divinity in motion  
  
As she stalked the room  
I could feel the aura  
Of her presence  
Every head turned  
Feeling passion and lust  
  
The girl was persuasive  
The girl I could not trust  
The girl was bad  
The girl was dangerous  
  
I never knew but I was  
Walking the line  
Come go with me  
I said I have no time  
And dont you pretend we didnt  
Talk on the phone  
My baby cried  
She left me standing alone  
  
Shes so dangerous  
The girl is so dangerous  
Take away my money  
Throw away my time  
You can call me honey  
But youre no damn good for me  
  
She came at me in sections  
With the eyes of desire  
I fell trapped into her  
Web of sin  
A touch a kiss  
A whisper of love  
I was at the point  
Of no return  
  
Deep in the darkness of  
Passions insanity  
I felt taken by lusts  
Strange inhumanity  
This girl was persuasive  
This girl I could not trust  
The girl was bad  
The girl was dangerous  
  
I never knew  
But I was living in vain  
She called my house  
She said you know my name  
And dont you pretend  
You never did me before  
With tears in her eyes  
My baby walked out the door  
  
Shes so dangerous  
The girl is so dangerous  
Take away my money  
Throw away my time  
You can call me honey  
But youre no damn good for me  
  
Dangerous  
The girl is so dangerous  
I have to pray to god  
Cause I know how  
Lust can blind  
Its a passion in my soul  
But youre no damn lover  
Friend of mine  
  
I can not sleep alone tonight  
My baby left me here tonight  
I cannot cope til its all right  
You and your manipulation  
You hurt my baby  
  
And then it happened  
She touched me  
For the lips of  
A strange woman  
Drop as a honeycomb  
And her mouth was  
Smoother than oil  
But her inner spirit and words  
Were as sharp as  
A twoedged sword  
But I loved it  
Cause its dangerous  
  
Dangerous  
The girl is so dangerous  
Take away my money  
Throw away my time  
You can call me honey  
But youre no damn good for me  
  
Dangerous  
The girl is so dangerous  
Take away my money  
Throw away my time  
You can call me honey  
But youre no damn good for me  
  
Dangerous  
The girl is so dangerous  
Take away my money  
Throw away my time  
You can call me honey  
But youre no damn good for me  
  
Dangerous  
The girl is so dangerous  
I have to pray to god  
cause I know how  
Lust can blind  
Its a passion in my soul  
But youre no damn lover  
Friend of mine
