Walk me over this situation  
Let the suns light warm my face  
Once again the times are changing  
Once again Ive lost my way  
  
While the words of acient poets  
Fall like dust upon my shoes  
Greed has grabbed me of my vision  
Turned my heart from higher truths  
  
So take my hand and lift me higher  
Be my love and my desire  
Hold me safe in honor bound  
Take my heart to higher ground  
  
I have walked too long in darkness  
I have walked too long alone  
Blindy clutching fist of diamonds  
That I found were only stones  
  
I would trade the wealth of ages  
For a warmer hand to hold  
Though the path of life is narrow  
But it leads the streets of gold  
  
So take my hand and lift me higher  
Be my love and my desire  
Hold me safe in honor bound  
Take my heart to higher ground  
  
In this world we move through shadows  
Never sure of what we see  
While the truth abides between us  
Come and share the truth with me  
  
So take my hand and lift me higher  
Be my love and my desire  
Hold me safe in honor bound  
Take my heart to higher ground  
  
Oh oh
