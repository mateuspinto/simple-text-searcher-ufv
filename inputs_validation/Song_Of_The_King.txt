KING  
  
A woman is a female who is human  
Designed for pleasing man the human male  
A human male is pleased by many women  
And all the rest you hear is fairy tale  
  
ANNA  
  
Then tell me how this fairy tale bagan sir  
You cannot call it just a poets trick  
Explain to me why many men are faithful  
And true to one wife only  
  
KING  
  
Spoken They are sick  
Singing A girl must be like a blossom  
With honey for just one man  
A man must be like honey bee  
And gather all he can  
To fly from blossom to blossom  
A honey bee must be free  
But blossom must not ever fly  
From bee to bee to bee
