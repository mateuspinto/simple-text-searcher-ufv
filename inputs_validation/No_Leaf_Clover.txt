And it feels right this time  
On this crash course were in the big time  
Pay no mind to the distant thunder  
Beauty fills his head with wonder boy  
Says it feels right this time  
Turn around found new high lights  
  
Good day to be alive sir  
Good day to be alive he said  
  
Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel  
Is just a freight train coming your way  
Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel  
Is just the freight train coming your way

All the pieces fall to his wish  
Suck up for that quick reward boy  
Suck up for that quick reward they said  
  
Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel  
Is just a freight train coming your way  
Then it comes to be that the soothing light at the end of your tunnel  
Is just the freight train coming your way
