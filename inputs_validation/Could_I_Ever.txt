When I woke up today  
And thought of all the things Youd done  
I find myself here  
Feeling oh so overcome  
  
You gave Your life away for me  
Truly my heart belongs to You  
So let me say  
  
Could I ever thank You for  
What You did at Calvary  
When You bled and died for me  
How could I ever turn away  
Knowing that You paid the price  
That I could never pay  
  
When I think of the way  
That You died upon that Cross  
Bearing my sin  
Even though my heart was lost  
  
You gave Your life away for me  
Truly my heart belongs to You  
So let me say  
  
Could I ever thank You for  
What You did at Calvary  
When You bled and died for me  
How could I ever turn away  
Knowing that You paid the price  
That I could never pay
