Cheri  
  
Sing me a song again Daddy  
Sing me a happy verse  
Teach me those clever lines you sang  
As you carried me on your shoulders  
Sing me that hymn that you so loudly  
Sang in church with mom  
Sing it again to me and fill me  
With all your words of wisdom  
  
Comforting words of love when I  
Would get home from school in tears  
Somehow your songs have stayed within me  
Down through all the years  
Once when my younger heart was broken  
Your shoulder was there to cry on  
Sing me those songs I know will linger  
Long after you have gone  
  
I am standing at the threshold  
Of a chapter in my life  
I am asking for your blessing  
As Im about to be the wife  
Of a man I know who loves me  
And Im proud to be his bride  
Dad the time has come for me to leave your side  
  
So sing me a song again Daddy  
Sing me a lullaby  
Wrap me inside your arms Daddy  
Though this is not goodbye  
Your songs will live forever  
In my heart When times get rough  
The ones Ill most remember  
Are your songs of love  
  
Jose  
  
Your songs will live forever  
In my heart When times get rough  
  
Cheri  
  
The ones Ill most remember  
Are your songs of love
