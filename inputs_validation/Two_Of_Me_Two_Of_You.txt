There are two of me  
And two of you  
Two who have betrayed love  
And two who have been true  
And together we went crashing through  
Every bond and vow and faith we knew  
Me and the fool Ive been  
And the two of you  
  
Of the two of me  
One always knew  
That I would always love you  
Whatever you might do  
And the more unfree and troubled you grew  
I could feel the whole world splitting in two  
Trying to make the room  
For the two of you  
  
So like a fragile little child  
More than a little lost and wild  
How the light would leave the sky when you cried  
And returned again when you smiled  
And how the light would invade and divide  
The darkness I have inside  
  
There were two of me  
And two of you  
Searching for a passageway  
Hidden from our view  
And together we went crashing through  
Every bond and vow and faith we knew  
Me and the fool Ive been  
And the two of you
