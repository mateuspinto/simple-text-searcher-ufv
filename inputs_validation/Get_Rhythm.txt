Hey get rhythm when you get the blues  
Cmon get rhythm when you get the blues  
Get a rock n roll feeling in your bones  
Put taps on your toes and get goin  
Get rhythm when you get the blues  
  
Little shoeshine boy never get slowed down  
But hes got the dirtiest job in town  
Bendin low at the peoples feet  
On the windy corner of a dirty street  
Well I asked him while he shined my shoes  
Howd he keep from gettin the blues  
He grinned as he raised his little head  
Popped a shoeshine rag and then he said  
  
Hey get rhythm when you get the blues  
Cmon get rhythm when you get the blues  
A jumpy rhythm makes you feel so fine  
Itll shake all the troubles from your worried mind  
Get rhythm when you get the blues  
  
Get rhythm when you get the blues  
Cmon get rhythm when you get the blues  
Get a rock n roll feeling in your bones  
Put taps on your toes and get goin  
Get rhythm when you get the blues  
  
Well I sat down to listen to the shoeshine boy  
And I thought I was gonna jump with joy  
Slapped on the shoe polish left and right  
He took a shoeshine rag and he held it tight  
He stopped once to wipe the sweat away  
I said youre a mighty little boy to bea workin that way  
He said I like it with a big wide grin  
Kept on a poppin and he said again  
  
Get rhythm when you get the blues  
Cmon get rhythm when you get the blues  
It only cost a dime just a nickel a shoe  
It does a million dollars worth of good for you  
Get rhythm when you get the blues
