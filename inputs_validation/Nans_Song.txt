You said when you died that youd walk with me everyday  
And I started to cry and said please dont talk that way  
With a blink of an eye and the Lord came and asked you to leave  
You went to a better place but they stole you away from me  
  
And now she lives in heaven  
But I know they let her out  
To take care of me  
Theres a strange kind of light  
Caressing me tonight  
Pray silence my fear  
She is near  
Bringing heaven down here  
  
I miss your love I miss your touch  
But Im feeling you every day  
And I can almost hear you say  
Youve come a long way baby  
  
And now you live in heaven  
But I know they let you out  
To take care of me  
Theres a strange kind of light  
In my bedroom tonight  
Pray silence my fear  
She is near  
Bringing heaven down here  
  
You taught me kings and queens  
While stroking in my head  
In my darkest hour  
I know you are there  
Leaning down beside me  
Whispering my prayers  
Theres a strange kind of light  
Caressing me tonight  
Pray silence my fear
