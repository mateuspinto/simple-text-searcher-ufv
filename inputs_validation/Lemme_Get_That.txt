chorus  
I got a house but I need new furniture  
Why spend mine when I could spend yours  
The truth is I will love you the same  
But why complain when you buying gucci babe  
  
You might see me in the spot  
Ya boy think Im hot  
So I came up in here to get what you got  
Im hot like the block  
Uh huh you like that  
Know you wanna bite that  
Uh huh yeah right there  
They love the young girl  
They wanna give it to me  
Wish I was in a flick  
And I aint talking movies  
If ya young if ya hot girl  
Shake what ya got girl  
I keep em singing  
  
Bridge  
Lemme get that huh  
What you got up in them jeans Put it on me or get lonely  
Lemme get that huh  
You know fivecar garages name on your bank account all day massages  
Lemme hit that huh  
I wanna put it on blast  
Lemme get that huh  
Better slow down for I make you crash boy  
Got what you want baby got what you need  
But we cant proceed  
Unless you got that for me  
  
Chorus  
  
Im a put you on the spot  
Keep the sheet in knots  
I bought me a Benz  
You buy me the yacht  
A girl need a lot  
The girl need some stocks  
Bonds is what I got bonds is what I got Ya get it  
They love the young girl  
They wanna give it to me  
Wish I was in a flick  
And I aint talking movies  
If ya young if ya hot girl  
Shake what ya got girl  
I keep em singing  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus

Boy I know you want my love  
Oh oh oh  
Nothing is free in this world  
Oh oh oh  
Unless my love is your love

Bridge
