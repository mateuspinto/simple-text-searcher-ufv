Whats it to you  
If I feel now  
Just a face in the wall  
Crawling out of the ground  
Now look at me  
You cry  
Like a leaf in the fall  
I fly in the sky dont you  
  
Whats it to you  
This noise noise  
Like a plaque on the wall  
One of these days  
Ill just leave  
whats it to you   
As boys drown  
You feel like young gods  
You know  
All young gods must fade  
whats it to you   
  
Whats it to you  
Going down boys  
Like a screw in the wall  
My lovers never leave in love  
Play war like marines  
Just noise noise  
Just roar roar  
One of these days  
  
whats it to you
