I took a drive along the west bank of the shore  
I thought of what you said then I thought some more  
You say your life is all but chiseled out in stone  
And all you want is just a taste of the unknown  
  
Think it was yesterday I called you on the phone  
You say you need a change I recognize the tone  
Buy me a ticket please to anywhere Ill go  
Im not saying what is right or what is wrong  
Im just thinking youve been hanging here too long  
  
Chorus  
So why dont we just up and leave it all behind  
Maybe a change would ease your mind  
For a time leave it all behind  
  
What I really want to do is see you smile  
Hear you talk and let me listen for a while  
Theres too much going on to keep it all inside  
You try to whisper but you start to scream and shout  
What you need is just a place to let it out  
  
Chorus  
  
You try to whisper but you start to scream and shout  
What you need is just a place to let it out  
  
Chorus
