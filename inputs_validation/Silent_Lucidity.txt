Hush now dont you cry  
Wipe away the teardrop from your eye  
Youre lying safe in bed  
It was all a bad dream  
Spinning in your head  
Your mind tricked you to feel the pain  
Of someone close to you leaving the game of life  
So here it is another chance  
Wide awake you face the day  
Your dream is over or has it just begun  
  
Theres a place I like to hide  
A doorway that I run through in the night  
Relax child you were there  
But only didnt realize and you were scared  
Its a place where you will learn  
To face your fears retrace the tears  
And ride the whims of your mind  
Commanding in another world  
Suddenly you hear and see  
This magic new dimension  
  
I will be watching over you  
I am gonna help you see it through  
I will protect you in the night  
I am smiling next to you in silent lucidity  
  
Visualize your dream  
Record it in the present tense  
Put it into a permanent form  
If you persist in your efforts  
You can achieve dream control  
Dream control  
Hows that then better  
Hug me  
  
If you open your mind for me  
You wont rely on open eyes to see  
The walls you built within  
Come tumbling down and a new world will begin  
Living twice at once you learn  
Youre safe from pain in the dream domain  
A soul set free to fly  
A round trip journey in your head  
Master of illusion can you realize  
Your dreams alive you can be the guide but  
  
I will be watching over you  
I am gonna help you see it through  
I will protect you in the night  
I am smiling next to you
