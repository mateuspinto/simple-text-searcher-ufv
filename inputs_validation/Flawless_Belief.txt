As ashes slowly fall I turn to heed my inner call  
To feel the gap within my soul  
I must find the one inside the whole  
Flawless belief is what my eyes see  
A shining figure here before me  
A divine idol we all plead to  
Im down on my knees I worship you with owe  
Im down on my knees my belief forever strong  
And I call out to you my lord of light  
Watch my faith how it glows  
God await that I know  
My praise for him I shall bestow  
And sing it praise you lord he is the lord  
In all pas centuries Ive lived  
False believers lived in eternal lie  
  
We live our life  amen  
Giving love to the end  
Shadows rise and fall  
At Gods divine call  
The answer to my pleas  
Let all madness cease  
This will be done
