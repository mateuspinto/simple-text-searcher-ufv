Chorus  
Kimu nkimaanyi  
Buli muntu alina ensiigo  
Omutima gwo gukulung aamye  
Buli muntu alina ensiigo  
  
Some people quietly reveal  
In the manner of the meek  
Some people shout the way they feel  
To a radical degree  
Some people sing it to express  
While others hear another call  
Some people speak with subtleness  
Some dont rely on words at all  
But let me tell you bout  
  
Chorus  
  
One thing I know  
Everybodys got a seed to sow  
let your heart of hearts  
Take you down the road  
Everybodys got a seed to sow  
  
We all are pieces of the whole  
With different feelings to evoke  
Giving distinction to the role  
Different playersdifferent strokes  
But let me tell you bout  
  
Chorus  
  
Some people walk  
Some people race  
Some people vary in their pace  
But God can use what you can give  
Within the mystery of His ways  
Dont underestimate  
  
Chorus
