I tied myself with wire  
To let the horses run free  
Playing with the fire  
Until the fire played with me  
  
The stone was semi precious  
We were barely conscious  
Two souls too smart to be  
In the realm of certainty  
Even on our wedding day  
  
We set ourselves on fire  
A girl could not deny her  
Its not if I believe in love  
If love believes in me  
Oh believe in me  
  
Chorus  
At the moment of surrender  
Im falling to my knees  
I did not notice the passers by  
And they did not notice me  
  
Ive been in every black hole  
At the alter of a Dark star  
My body s now begging  
Though its begging to get back  
Begging to get back  
To my heart  
To the rhythm of my soul  
To the rhythm of my consciousness  
To the rhythm of yes  
To be released from control  
  
I was punching in the numbers at the ATM machine  
I could see in the reflection  
A face staring back at me  
  
Chorus  
  
I was speeding off the subway  
Through the stations of the cross  
Every eye looking every other way  
Counting down till the pain will stop  
  
Chorus
