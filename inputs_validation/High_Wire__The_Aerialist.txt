I Up on the wire  
I like to climb and play with the sky  
The people far below  
The air is clear  
And I can perceive  
The whole world is shining  
Life is sublime  
And when you dare to go up in the air and leave the earth far behind you  
As I step and dip and leap into a space beyond  
Up high  
Just for a moment  
Alive  
And so afraid but alive  
As I push against the sky and my heart has broken free  
  
II Fear turns to joy  
When you can race the edge of the sky  
And lifes intense and strong  
Its not so long  
Before you will run  
Beyond your horizons  
Up on the wire  
The line is thin and you must bow and surf against the sky so precisely  
But the sky seems to go on as far as you can see  
Up high  
Just for this moment  
Alive  
And so afraid but alive  
As the wire disappears  
And youve finally broken free  
  
Solo  
  
III As I step and dip and leap into a place beyond  
Up high  
Just for this moment  
  
Up on the wire  
I like to climb and play with the sky  
The people far below  
The air is clear  
And I can perceive  
The whole world is shining  
Life is sublime  
And when you dare to go up in the air and leave the earth so precisely  
As I step and dip and leap into a place beyond  
Up high  
Just for this moment  
Alive  
And so afraid but alive  
As I dip against the sky and my heart has broken free  
Broken free  
Broken free  
Up high
