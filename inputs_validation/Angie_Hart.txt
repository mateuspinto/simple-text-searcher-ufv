Night falls  
I fall  
And where were you  
And where were you  
Warm skin wolf grin  
And where were you  
  
I fell into the moon  
And it covered you in blue  
I fell into the moon  
Can I make it right  
Can I spend the night  
  
High tide inside  
The air is dew  
And where were you  
Wild eyed I died  
And where were you  
  
I crawled out of the world  
When you said I shouldnt start  
I crawled out of the world  
Can I make it right  
Can I spend the night  
Alone
