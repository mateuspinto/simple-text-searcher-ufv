She was the first girl on the moon  
She didnt compromise  
When she took off that cold afternoon  
Heading for the northern skies  
  
I told her I could come  
That I could come along  
  
She was the first girl on the moon  
I think I was her only friend  
She brought her raygun an old harpoon  
Just in case of accidents  
  
I told her I could come  
That I could come along  
But she didnt let me come along  
Wave goodbye  
Wave goodbye  
  
She was the first girl on the moon  
Standing tall flag in hand  
She looked around humming a tune  
The strangest song known to man  
  
I told her I could come  
That I could come along  
But she never let me come along  
Wave goodbye Wave goodbye
