Seems like just yesterday  
You were a part of me  
I used to stand so tall  
I used to be so strong  
Your arms around me tight  
Everything it felt so right  
Unbreakable like nothing could go wrong  
  
Now I cant breathe  
No I cant sleep  
Im barely hanging on  
  
Chorus  
Here I am  
Once again  
Im torn into pieces  
Cant deny it  
Cant pretend  
Just thought you were the one  
Broken up deep inside  
But you wont get to see the tears I cry  
Behind these hazel eyes  
  
I told you everything  
Opened up and let you in  
You made me feel alright for once in my life  
Now all thats left of me  
Is what I pretend to be  
So together but so broken up inside  
  
Cause I cant breathe  
No I cant sleep  
Im barely hanging on  
  
Chorus  
  
Swallow me then spit me out  
For hating you I blame myself  
Just seeing you it kills me now  
Now I dont cry  
On the outside anymore  
  
Chorus x2
