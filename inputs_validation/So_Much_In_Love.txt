As we stroll along together  
Holding hands and walking all alone  
So in love are we two  
That we dont know what to do  
  
So in love  
So in love  
  
As we walk along together  
neath the stars twinkling high above  
  
So in love are we two  
That we dont know what to do  
  
So in love  
So in love  
  
I tell I tell you my darling  
I need you I need you oh so much  
I love I love you my darling  
Cant you tell it from my touch  
  
As we walk down the isle together  
As we vow to stay together till we die  
  
So in love are we two  
Just cant wait to say I do  
  
So in love  
So in love  
Oh you and I  
So in love
