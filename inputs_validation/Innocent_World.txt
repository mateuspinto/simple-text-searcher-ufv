I used to live in an innocent world  
I had a car and a pretty blond girlfriend  
We was too young to know what we were doing  
And anyway I was just fooling around  
  
Innocent innocent innocent world  
Innocent innocent innocent world  
Innocent innocent innocent world  
With a cute little monkey on my back  
And a total disregard for the facts  
Id run away and never get back  
From my innocent world  
  
There aint no reason to tell no lie  
When youre young and youve got a lot of pie  
Now I slink around like a killer  
The things they say are just a lot of filler  
In my mind in my mind  
  
Innocent innocent innocent world  
Innocent innocent innocent world  
Innocent innocent innocent world  
Running laughing in the sun  
And always having lots of fun  
Smoking dope and just being young  
In my innocent world  
  
Innocent innocent innocent world  
Innocent innocent innocent world  
Innocent innocent innocent world  
With a cute little monkey on my back  
And a total disregard for the facts  
Id run away and never get back  
From my innocent world  
  
Innocent innocent innocent world Repeat x4
