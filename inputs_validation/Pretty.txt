So so loud  
Wait but I dont realize  
How why legs  
Broke the pain between her thighs  
I see your pretty face  
Smashed against the bathroom floor  
What a disgrace  
Who do I feel sorry for  
Skin so cold  
  
How could someone steal a life  
Save the blame  
Wait I got some shit to say  
I see your pretty face  
Smashed against the bathroom floor  
What a disgrace  
Who do I feel sorry for  
Smashed and raped  
Not again this is a real crime  
What a pretty face  
Who do I feel sorry for  
  
Rape something  
Now rips my  
Heart and takes  
My soul I  
Wait too late  
Now I feel  
Raped inside  
Death my soul away  
Away  
  
I see your pretty face  
Smashed against the bathroom floor  
What a disgrace  
Who do I feel sorry for  
Smashed and raped  
Not again this is a real crime  
What a pretty face  
Who do I feel sorry for
