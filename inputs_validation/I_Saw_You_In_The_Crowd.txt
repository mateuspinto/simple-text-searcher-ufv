I saw you in the crowd  
I saw you singing out loud  
The people were swaying  
The band was playing  
  
Something real loud  
I couldnt hear one word  
Screams were all that I heard  
But I saw her face  
  
I saw her eyes  
I saw His grace  
In the darkening skies  
I saw you raise your hand  
  
Stretching out to the band  
You reach exceeding your grasp  
On the beach from the whale  
Comes one last gasp  
  
Meet me in my hotel room  
Meet me just for fun  
And I will not be boring  
Some things I been storing  
  
Inside to show someone like you  
A few friends just stopped by  
I think they wanted to get high  
But it wasnt you  
  
Who they led me to  
So I bid them all goodbye  
I probably would forget  
This episode of regret  
  
So I wrote this song  
So when you sing along  
I hope my message you will get  
Meet me in my hotel room  
  
Oh meet me just for fun  
And you will not be boring  
Something you been storing  
Inside to show someone like me
