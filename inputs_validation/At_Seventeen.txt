I learned the truth at seventeen  
That love was meant for beauty queens  
And high school girls with clearskinned smiles  
Who married young and then retired  
  
The valentines I never knew  
The Friday night charades of youth  
Were spent on one more beautiful  
At seventeen I learned the truth  
  
And those of us with ravaged faces  
Lacking in the social graces  
Desperately remained at home  
Inventing lovers on the phone  
Who called to say Come dance with me  
And murmured vague obscenities  
It isnt all it seems at seventeen  
  
A brown eyed girl in handmedowns  
Whose name I never could pronounce  
Said Pity please the ones who serve  
They only get what they deserve  
The rich relationed hometown queen  
Marries into what she needs  
With a guarantee of company  
And haven for the elderly  
  
So remember those who win the game  
Lose the love they sought to gain  
In debentures of quality  
And dubious integrity  
The small town eyes will gape at you  
In dull surprise when payment due  
Exceeds accounts received at seventeen  
  
To those of us who knew the pain  
Of valentines that never came  
And those whose names were never called  
When choosing sides for basketball  
It was long ago and far away  
The world was younger than today  
When dreams were all they gave for free  
To ugly ducking girls like me  
  
We all play the game and when we dare  
We cheat ourselves at solitaire  
Inventing lovers on the phone  
Repenting other lives unknown  
That call and say Come dance with me  
And murmur vague obscenities  
At ugly girls like me at seventeen
