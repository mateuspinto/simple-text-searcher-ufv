Is it an earthquake or simply a shock  
Is it the good turtle soup or merely the mock  
Is it a cocktail this feeling of joy  
Or is what I feel the real McCoy  
  
Is it for all time or simply a lark  
Is it Granada I see or only Asbury Park  
Is it a fancy not worth thinking of  
Or is it at long last love
