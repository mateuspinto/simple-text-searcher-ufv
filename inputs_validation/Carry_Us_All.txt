I heard a whisper on my radio  
But I paid no mind  
I just sat back and let it go  
To catch the rain from a lonely waterfall  
But I might beware  
Cause they could drown me like a doll  
  
They got me running in and out of time  
I feel like a Bona Fide  
Keeper of the right and wrong  
And Ive known all along but let me just make it clear  
  
Everybodys gone for a quick sure fire solution  
But faith in any god is gonna bury us all  
Noones gonna fight in a tenbob revolution  
Have faith in what you got and it will carry us all  
Carry us all  
  
I slip my skin as the prophets reappear  
But I paid no mind  
Im just trying to persevere  
With the sins I have to shake from me within  
Though I might beware  
Cause theyre just trying to wear me thin  
  
They got me running in and out of time  
I feel like a Bona Fide  
Keeper of the right and wrong  
And Ive known all along but let me just make it clear  
  
Everybodys gone for a quick sure fire solution  
But faith in any god is gonna bury us all  
Noones gonna fight in a tenbob revolution  
Have faith in what you got and it will carry us all  
Carry us all  
  
Everybodys gone for a quick sure fire solution  
But faith in any god is gonna bury us all  
Noones gonna fight in a tenbob revolution  
Have faith in what you got and it will carry us all  
Carry us all  
Carry us all
