A tongue can accuse and carry bad news the seeds of distrust it will sow  
But unless youve made no mistakes in your life be careful of stones that you
throw  
  
A neighbor was passing my garden one time she stopped and I knew right away  
That it was gossip not flowers she had on her mind  
And this is what I heard my neighbor say  
That bad girl down the street should be run from our midst  
She drinks and she talks quite a lot  
She knows not to speak to me or my child my neighbor then smiled and I thought  
A tongue can accuse  
  
A car speeded by and the screaming of brakes a sound that made my blood chill  
For my neighbors one child had been pulled from the path  
And saved by a girl lying still  
The child was unhurt and my neighbor cried out oh who was that brave girl so
sweet  
I covered the crushed broken body and sad the bad girl who lived down the
street  
A tongue can accuse
