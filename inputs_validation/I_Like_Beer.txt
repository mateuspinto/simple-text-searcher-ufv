In some of my songs I have casually mentioned  
The fact that I like to drink beer  
This little song is more to the point  
Roll out the barrel and lend me your ears  
  
Chorus  
I like beer it makes me a jolly good fellow  
I like beer it helps me unwind and sometimes it makes me feel mellow Makes
him feel mellow  
Whiskeys too rough Champagne costs too much vodka puts my mouth in gear  
This little refrain should help me explain as a matter of fact I like beer  
He likes beer  
  
My wife often frowns when were out on the town  
And Im wearing a suit and a tie  
Shes sipping vermouth and she thinks Im uncouth  
When I yell as the waiter goes by  
  
Chorus  
  
Last night I dreamed that I passed from the scene  
And I went to a place so sublime  
Aw the water was clear and tasted like beer  
Then they turned it all into wine Awww  
  
Chorus
