A young man fell in love with truth  
In searching th wide world for her  
He found her in the small house  
In the clearing  
In the forest  
She was old and she was stooped  
He pledged himself to her  
To chop the wood and carry the water  
  
Years went by until one day  
The young man woke up longing for a child  
He went to the old women  
And he asked to be released from his oath to her  
That he might return to the world  
Certainly she said  
On one condition  
You must tell them that I am young beautiful  
You must tell them that I am young beautiful
