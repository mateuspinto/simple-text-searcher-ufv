Oh little Jack Frost get lost get lost  
Little Jack Frost get lost  
You know you dont do a thing  
But put a bite on the toes  
  
Theres lots of cold feet all the lovers complain  
You turn up the heat down on lovers lane  
The bench in the park is alone in the dark  
So little Jack Frost get lost get lost  
Little Jack Frost get lost  
  
So little Jack Frost get lost get lost  
Little Jack Frost get lost get lost  
You dont do a thing but put the bite on my toes  
Freeze up the ground and take the bloom from the rose  
So little Jack Frost go away go away  
And dont you come back another day get gone go way  
  
Theres lots of cold feet all the lovers complain  
You turn off the heat down in lovers lane  
The fence in the park is all alone in the dark  
So little Jack Frost get lost get lost  
Little Jack Frost get lost  
Get lost get lost get lost get lost  
L J Frost get lost  
Lost
