A cry for help a hint of anesthesia  
The sound from broken homes  
We used to always meet here  
As he lays asleep she takes him in her arms  
Some things I have to do but I dont mean you harm  
  
A worried parents glance a kiss a last goodbye  
Hands him the bag she packed the tears she tries to hide  
A cruel wind that blows down to our lunacy  
And leaves him standing cold here in this colony  
  
I cant see why all these confrontations  
I cant see why all these dislocations  
No family life this makes me feel uneasy  
Stood alone here in this colony  
In this colony in this colony in this colony in this colony  
  
Dear God in his wisdom took you by the hand  
God in his wisdom made you understand  
God in his wisdom took you by the hand  
God in his wisdom made you understand  
  
God in his wisdom took you by the hand  
God in his wisdom made you understand  
God in his wisdom took you by the hand  
God in his wisdom made you understand  
In this colony in this colony in this colony in this colony
