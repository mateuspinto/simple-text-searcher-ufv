I watch you sleeping  
My weary heart rises up on wings  
I hear your laughter  
Something deep down inside me sings  
  
Way down here in the land of cotton  
You were born on a rainy day  
Since then sweet things long forgotten  
They just keep flooding back my way  
  
Oh child I cannot tell you how the time just flies  
But I have had my days of glory under sunny skies  
These days your bright dreams are all I want to see  
Sleep tight Annabel  
You can always count on me  
  
In this cold world folks will judge you  
Though they dont know you at all  
And I may not be there to catch you  
Anytime that you might fall  
  
But you got my hard head  
And your mothers grace  
All the likeness of the loved ones right there in your face  
And I know in the end youll be who you will be  
  
So sleep tight Annabel  
You can always count on me
