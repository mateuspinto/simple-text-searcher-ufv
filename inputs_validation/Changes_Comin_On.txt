Long hair was not in style the first time I heard Haggard on the radio but I
could feel the changes comin on  
The Beatles crossed the ocean an overnight explosion on the TV  
My brother had to go to Vietnam  
  
Ford unveiled the Mustang  
Things were good in Detroit for the people there  
And I could feel changes comin on  
From Atlanta Doctor King told the world he had a dream  
People followed him  
And Daddy said my hair was getting long  
  
I could feel changes comin on  
People started singin different songs searchin for the place where they
belong  
I could feel changes comin on  
  
Well Im still hooked on Haggard  
But the Beatles cant come back like we hoped they would  
In Memphis Tennessee The King is gone  
As I put my kids to bed I wonder what lies ahead for them to see cause I
can feel the changes comin on  
  
I could feel changes comin on  
People stilll are singin different songs  
Theyre searchin for the place where they belong  
I can feel changes comin on  
  
I can feel changes comin on I can feel changes comin on
