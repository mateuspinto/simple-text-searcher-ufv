You think that youre the second coming  
Sorry to say it doesnt do it for me  
Must be a drag when youre so stunning  
In all that you are  
And all that you hope to be  
  
You can have it all take it all  
Break it all forsake it all  
Want it all choose it all  
Use it with no stake at all  
Keep it all trash it all  
Lead it just like sheep it all  
Hate it all love it all and still  
Youll have nothing  
Yeah yeah  
  
You think that you can walk on water  
Better be careful it gets mighty deep  
Id be afraid of what my thoughts were  
You never know whod be willing  
To take that leap  
  
You can have it all take it all  
Break it all forsake it all  
Want it all choose it all  
Use it with no stake at all  
Keep it all trash it all  
Lead it just like sheep it all  
Hate it all love it all and still  
Youll have nothing  
Yeah yeah  
  
When you look in the mirror  
Do you see any clearer  
Or are you blinded  
By your own vision  
Or have you ever thought  
That maybe you were wrong  
Or do you just reside  
In your illusion  
You can have it all take it all  
Break it all forsake it all  
Want it all choose it all  
Use it with no stake at all  
Keep it all trash it all  
Lead it just like sheep it all  
Hate it all love it all and still  
Youll have nothing  
Yeah yeah  
  
You can have it all take it all  
Break it all forsake it all  
Want it all choose it all  
Use it with no stake at all  
Keep it all trash it all  
Lead it just like sheep it all  
Hate it all love it all and still  
Youll have nothing  
Yeah yeah
