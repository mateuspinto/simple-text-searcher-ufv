Thought I was asleep  
Lost to dreams  
I was dying in a big machine  
Didnt think the voice that called me  
Could be real  
  
Thought I woke up  
Lost my faith  
I was staring at the face of rage  
Didnt think Id see the demon in His heart  
  
Thought I saw blood  
Turn to wine  
A vision from the angel wars  
Didnt think Id find the savior in the dark  
  
Thought I saw a light  
Tear the storm  
Showing me the way to God  
Didnt know that Heaven died and went to Hell  
  
Blessed is dead Heaven  
Blessed are shadows and pain  
Blessed is dead Heaven  
Blessed is death in His name  
  
Thought I saw rain  
Black and cold  
Falling on a childs grave  
Thought I saw an angel laugh and piss on it  
  
Thought I saw a dance  
Strange and cruel  
Swaying to the screams of men  
Thought I saw the Lords disciples laugh at that  
  
Thought I saw love  
Sacrificed  
Mary under three wise men  
Thought I saw the Virgin look at me and cry  
  
Thought I saw a cross  
And Jesus dead  
Burning in the midnight sky  
Thought I saw God dancing in the flames  
  
Glory is dead Heaven  
Glory is shadows and pain  
Glory is dead Heaven  
Glory is death in His name  
  
Do you confess  
Cleanse your sin  
Do you believe in the word of God  
  
Welcome to dead Heaven  
Welcome to shadows and pain  
Welcome to dead Heaven  
Welcome to death in His name
