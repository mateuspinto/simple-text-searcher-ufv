I was wasted in the afternoon  
Waiting on a train  
I woke up in pieces and elisabeth had disappeared again  
Well I wish you were inside of me  
I hope that youre ok  
I hope your resting quietly  
I just wanted to say  
  
Good goodnight elizabeth  
Goodnight elizabeth  
Goodnight elizabeth  
Goodnight  
  
We couldnt all be cowboys  
Some of us are clowns  
And some of us are dancers on the midway  
We roam from town to town  
I hope that everybody can find a little flame  
Me I say my prayers  
Then I just light myself on fire  
And I walk out on the wire once again  
And I say  
  
Good goodnight elizabeth  
Goodnight elizabeth  
Goodnight elizabeth  
Goodnight  
  
I will wait for you in Baton Rouge  
Ill miss you down in New Orleans  
Ill wait for you while she slips in something comfortable  
And ill miss you when Im slipping in between  
If you wrap yourself in daffodills  
I will wrap myself in pain  
And if youre the queen of California  
Baby I am the king of the rain  
And I say  
  
Good goodnight elisabeth  
Goodnight elizabeth  
Goodnight elizabeth  
Goodnight  
The moons a satellite yeah  
Now wont you fall down  
On me now  
Wont you fall down on me  
Come fall down  
On me now  
Wont you fall down on me  
till Im all alone  
You aint coming home  
You just settle down down down into bones  
I said Im all alone  
You aint coming home  
You just settle down down down into bones
