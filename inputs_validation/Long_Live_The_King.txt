I wait in the cold  
It should have been summer  
It will start to rain  
Its just not fair  
But we are insane  
We wait for the thunder  
We wait for the pain  
With open hair  
Now the stage is on fire  
Now explodes the air  
  
Ohohohohohohoh  
Ohohohohohohoh  
  
Long live the king  
Long live the king  
  
We shout every line  
We bang to the metal  
Some call out his name  
He makes the sign  
Now the stage is on fire  
Now explodes the air  
  
Ohohohohohohoh  
Ohohohohohohoh  
  
Long live the king  
Long live the king  
  
You got to feel the spirit  
Got to hear the Les Paul  
You got to feel the action  
Got to ride the death wall  
  
Giving in it  
Giving in it  
Giving in it all  
Giving in it  
Giving in it  
Giving in it all  
  
The curtain is down  
We scream like one choir  
Emotions go wild  
I shake my hair  
Now the stage is on fire  
Now explodes the air  
  
Ohohohohohohoh  
Ohohohohohohoh  
  
Long live the king  
Long live the king
