Words and music by James Rider  
  
Just me and a friend roamin around  
Him a magician and I was a clown  
Playin the streets for a dollar a day  
Waitin for the right time and a sign to lead the way  
  
Crossed over the border to a mystical land  
Sort of unexpected didnt quite understand  
On a razors edge on a grain of sand  
Onward we wandered to the gates of oblivion  
  
On a roll of the dice we headed out west  
Where the sage and and the spice attracted us  
Shadows fell down like a dark groping hand  
Saw the teeth of the wolves and the blood of the lambs  
  
On a turn of the cards I lightened my load  
Throwing off fear for the weakness it holds  
On target and calm the vision was clear  
Beyond the mirage I took for granted was here  
  
On a flip of the coins we rode the coast  
Tryin to make the most of every situation  
That we witnessed near at hand  
On a drifters crusade all over the land  
  
Could it be in the stars in the passing of cars  
At a table in the bar in a turn of the cards  
In a change of your mind in the passing of time  
In a ribbon of rhyme just down the line  
  
Just me and a friend roamin around  
Him a magician I was a clown  
Playin the streets for a dollar a day  
Waitin for the right time and a sign to lead the way
