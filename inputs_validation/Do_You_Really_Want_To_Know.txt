When I ask those questions baby  
Its just to get them out of my head  
Cause they turn around inside it  
Then they spill off to our bed  
Do I really want to know  
Do I really want to know your life  
Would I have to let you go  
Could I listen to my heart if my head stops to think twice  
  
When Ive been a good boy  
When Ive been a bad boy  
I have too much fun  
But baby so did everyone  
Ive never been an angel  
But things are gonna change change change  
So do you really want to know  
Do you really want to know my life  
Would you have to let me go  
Could you listen to your heart if your head stopped to think twice  
  
If you knew every woman  
And I knew every man  
We never would have made it past holding hands  
I guess the saying is no longer true  
That what you dont know can hurt you  
I guess there is just no question baby  
You know what youre doing in bed  
If I want your touch  
Should I know too much  
Some things are better left unsaid  
So do I really want to know  
Do I really want to know your life  
Would I have to let you go  
Could I listen to my heart if my head starts to think twice  
  
Tell me baby Cause one thing to guess is one thing to know  
And dont you think that maybe baby Ive got secrets of my own  
  
If I knew every woman  
And you knew every man  
We never would have made it past holding hands  
I used to say it but its no longer true  
Cause what you dont know can really hurt you Can kill you baby  
  
And even as we speak  
The world is full of lovers  
Night after night week after week  
Trusting to luck and a pocket full of rubbers
