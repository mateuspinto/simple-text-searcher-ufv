Just because I ask a friend about her  
Just because I spoke her name somewhere  
Just because I rang her number by mistake today  
She thinks I still care  
  
Just because I hang out at the same ol places  
Where the memory of her lingers everywhere  
Just because Im not the happy guy I used to be  
She thinks I still care  
  
But if shes happy thinking I still need her  
Then let that silly notion bring her cheer  
But how could she ever be so foolish  
Oh where would she get such an idea  
  
Just because I ask a friend about her  
Just because I spoke her name somewhere  
Just because I saw her then went all to pieces  
She thinks I still care  
She thinks I still care
