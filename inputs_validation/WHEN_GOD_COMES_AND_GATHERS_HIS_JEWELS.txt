The ceremony was over  
A lad stood alone in tears  
For he had just said goodbye  
To the one he had loved through the years  
  
He stood all alone with his head bowed down  
As though his heart would break  
Then the Parson came over and took his hand  
And to him these words he did say  
  
Chorus  
When God comes and gathers his jewels  
All his treasures of diamonds and gold  
Youll meet her up there in heaven so fair  
When God comes and gathers his jewels  
Substitute Ill meet her on last chorus  
  
Each night when the pale moon is shining  
You can see this lad all alone  
With his eyes lifted toward heaven  
Hes repeating these words he was told  
  
Chorus
