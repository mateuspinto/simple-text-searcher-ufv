Many years after the overthrow of Wilson a rebel soldier crouching high on a
hilltop above the war torn forests of Gamehendge spots a group of loyalists
approaching from their lakeside encampment below His trusty llama stands
beside him loaded down with a canvas pack that holds two large bazooka type
guns to the animals sides Near the man sits a cache of blastoplast each
capable of destroying the entire hillside in an instant  
  
Sunrise over the turquoise mountains messenger birds in sight  
They came up through the valley both sides at a time  
Through the cold steady rain Raid I bend down  
Poke a double decker on a llama Llama Taboot Taboot  
Trigger a blastoplast ramshackle laker recedes I start to run  
It was the loudest thing Id ever heard And I knew my time had come  
To enter the delta  
  
Leave it on press depress depress  
Llama Taboot Taboot
