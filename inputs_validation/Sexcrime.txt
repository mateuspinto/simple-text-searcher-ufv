Sex crime crime  
Can I take this for granted  
With your eyes over me  
In this place this wintery home  
I know theres always someone in  
Sex crime sex crime  
Nineteen eighty four  
Nineteen eighty four  
And so I face the wall  
Turn my back against it all  
How I wish Id been unborn  
Wish I was unliving here  
Sex crime sex crime  
Sex crime sex crime  
Nineteen eighty four  
Nineteen eighty four  
Ill pull the bricks down  
One by one  
Leave a big hole in the wall  
Just where you are looking in  
Sex crime sex crime  
Nineteen eighty four  
Nineteen eighty four  
Nineteen eighty four
