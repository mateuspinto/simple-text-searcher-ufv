Was gonna give you these flowers tonight  
Was gonna ask you to stay  
Practiced so that I would say it just right  
But now there are no words to say  
  
As I watch you kiss him softly  
The same way you kissed me  
  
I scream what am I gonna do with forever now  
Tell me what am I gonna do with forever now Ohh  
All the plans we made dont work if youre not around  
So tell me what am I gonna do with forever now  
What do I do now  
What do I do now  
  
In slow motion I let these flowers hit the ground  
And right before I turn to leave  
  
I watch you kiss him softly  
Then look up and see me  
  
And I scream What am I gonna do with forever now Wow  
Tell me what am I gonna do with forever now  
All the plans we made dont work if youre not around  
So tell me what am I gonna do with forever now  
What do I do now  
  
Everything you said we would be  
All the things you said wed do  
I made all my life around the thought of me and you  
  
And I scream What am I gonna do with forever now What do I do What do I
do nowWow  
Tell me what am I gonna do with forever now What do I do What do I do
now Ohh  
All the plans we made dont work if youre not around  
So tell me what am I gonna do with forever now Ey  
What do I do now  
What do I do now  
What do I do now  
  
What do I do What do I do now  
What do I do now  
What do I do What do I do now  
What do I do now
