When will he call me  
When will it ring  
Sometimes I think my sanity is hangin by a shoestring  
  
When will he call me  
How long is soon  
Should I check my watch my calendar or phases of the moon  
  
And he doesnt have to call me  
He can email me or text me  
My love is hanging by the phone is really vex me  
i check my messages you know how it affects me  
cause finding nothing in my inbox  
really hurts me  
  
When will he call me  
Oh woah  
When will he call me  
When will he call me  
Should I check my watch my calendar or phases of the moon
