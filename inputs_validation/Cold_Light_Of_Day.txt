I arch my back to touch the stars  
as they fall from my hand  
for tommorrow the sun will rise again  
a pearl a grain of sand  
I let the clothes slip from my bones  
I step into the stream  
for tommorrow the sun will rise again  
Im washing my hands clean  
my darling child was lost at sea today  
and in the cold light she fades  
show me how to break the waves  
collision of the soul  
for tommorrow the sun will rise again  
shes taking me back home
