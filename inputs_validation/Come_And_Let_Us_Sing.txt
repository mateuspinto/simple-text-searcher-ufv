Come and let us sing  
Come and let us sing  
Come and let us sing  
To the King of kings  
  
Enter his gates with thanksgiving  
Enter his courts with praise  
  
Hes worthy to be praised  
Exalt his holy name  
Glory and honor  
Majesty and power  
  
Come and let us shout  
Come and let us shout  
Come and let us shout  
To the Lord our God  
  
Come and let us dance  
Come and let us dance  
Come and let us dance  
Lift up holy hands  
  
Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah
