Praise the Lord My heart with His love is beaming  
I am a child of God  
Heavens golden light over me is streaming  
I am a child of God  
  
Refrain  
I am a child of God  
I am a child of God  
I have washed my robes in the cleansing fountain  
I am a child of God  
  
Let the saints rejoice with my raptured spirit  
I am a child of God  
I will testify that the world may hear it  
I am a child of God  
  
Let a holy life tell the gospel story  
I am a child of God  
How He fills the soul with His grace and glory  
I am a child of God  
  
Saved from sin today every band is riven  
I am a child of God  
Through the tests of life I have peace from heaven  
I am a child of God
