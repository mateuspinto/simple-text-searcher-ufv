Eva  
It wont be easy youll think it strange  
When I try to explain how I feel  
That I still need your love after all that Ive done  
  
You wont believe me  
All you will see is a girl you once knew  
Although shes dressed up to the nines  
At sixes and sevens with you  
  
I had to let it happen I had to change  
Couldnt stay all my life down at heel  
Looking out of the window staying out of the sun  
  
So I chose freedom  
Running around trying everything new  
But nothing impressed me at all  
I never expected it to  
  
Chorus  
Dont cry for me Argentina  
The truth is I never left you  
All through my wild days  
My mad existence  
I kept my promise  
Dont keep your distance  
  
And as for fortune and as for fame  
I never invited them in  
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired  
  
They are illusions  
They are not the solutions they promised to be  
The answer was here all the time  
I love you and hope you love me  
  
Dont cry for me Argentina  
  
Chorus  
  
Have I said too much  
Theres nothing more I can think of to say to you  
But all you have to do is look at me to know  
That every word is true
