Oh come all ye faithful  
Joyful and triumphant  
Oh come ye oh come ye to Bethlehem  
Come and behold Him  
Born the King of Angels  
  
Oh come let us adore Him  
Oh come let us adore Him  
Oh come let us adore Him  
Christ the Lord  
  
Oh sing choirs of angels sing in exultation  
Sing all that hear in Heaven Gods holy word  
Give to our Father glory in the highest  
  
Oh come let us adore Him  
Oh come let us adore Him  
Oh come let us adore Him  
Christ the Lord  
  
Word of the Father now in flesh appearing  
Oh come let us adore Him  
Oh come let us adore Him  
Oh come let us adore Him  
Christ the Lord
