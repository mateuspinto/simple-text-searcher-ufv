Once upon a time there was a funny girl  
Who fell for a funny boy  
They built a funny house and made some funny kids  
And christened it the house of holy joy  
  
If forever meant forever that was the place  
Or so she told her friends  
But the city took her lovers to another world  
Left her waiting for the flowers to bloom again  
  
And she laughed  
And she cried  
She damn near died  
On the day it rained forever  
  
She walked around the garden with an empty mind  
Feeling tired and worn  
Not exactly sure what she was meant to find  
Heaven knows maybe a rose without a thorn  
  
She laughed  
She cried  
She damn near died  
On the day it rained forever
