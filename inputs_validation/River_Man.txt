Betty came by on her way  
Said she had a word to say  
About things today  
And fallen leaves  
  
Said she hadnt heard the news  
Hadnt had the time to choose  
A way to lose  
But she believes  
  
Going to see the river man  
Going to tell him all I can  
About the plan  
For lilac time  
  
If he tells me all he knows  
About the way his river flows  
And all night shows  
In summertime  
  
Betty said she prayed today  
For the sky to blow away  
Or maybe stay  
She wasnt sure  
  
For when she thought of summer rain  
Calling for her mind again  
She lost the pain  
And stayed for more  
  
Going to see the river man  
Going to tell him all I can  
About the ban  
On feeling free  
  
If he tells me all he knows  
About the way his river flows  
I dont suppose  
Its meant for me  
  
Oh how they come and go  
Oh how they come and go
