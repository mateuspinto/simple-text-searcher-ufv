Lets talk about me for a minute  
Well how do you think  
I feel about whats been going on  
Lets talk about me for a minute  
Well how do you think  
I feel about whats gone wrong  
  
Lets talk about dreams  
I never learned to read the signs  
Lets think about what it all means  
I never seem to have the time  
  
Lets talk about you and your problems  
All that I seem to do is spend the night  
Just talking bout you and your problems  
No matter what I say I cant get it right  
  
Dont think about dreams  
Is it all a waste of time  
Dont think about what it all means  
If you are a friend of mine  
  
Talk about me for a minute  
Im the one whos losing  
Talk about me for a minute  
Im the one whos always losing out  
  
And how do you think

We never seem to have the time  
Lets talk about what it all means
