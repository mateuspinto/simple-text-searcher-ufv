Ooh wahh

I love how your eyes close  
Whenever you kiss me  
Or when Im away form you I love how you miss me  
I love the way you always treat me tenderly  
But darling most of all I love how you love me  
  
I love how your heart beats  
Whenever I hold you  
I love how you think of me w  
Without being told to  
I love the way your touch is always heavenly  
But daring most of all I love how you love  
  
I love how your eyes close  
Whenever you kiss me  
Or when Im away form you I love how you miss me  
I love the way you always treat me tenderly  
But darling most of all I love how you love me  
  
I love how you love me  
I love how you squeeze me tease me please me  
Love how you love me  
I love how you love me  
I love how you want me
