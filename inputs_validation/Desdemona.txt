Rain falls on a sleepy southern town  
The midnight moon burning brightly  
Memories rush in like a river forlorn  
As you lay sleeping without me  
Highway song keeps me rollin on  
Still I long for you  
Desdemona I will be your only one  
Oh yeah  
And I make my living pouring out my pain  
Trying to make it through another day  
Arms reach for me on the wind I can feel them  
Theyre a thousand miles away  
Your eyes remind me of everything beautiful and blue  
And I wont feel myself till Im with you  
Desdemona I will be your only one  
Oh yeah  
So hold a candle till the darkness fades  
Night time sleeps but not for long  
My heart is pounding like the ocean  
My souls empty as the sky  
But I know someday Ill be coming home  
Time goes by the twinkling of an eye  
Still I pine for you  
Desdemona I will be your only one  
I just wanna be oh your only one  
I just wanna be your only one  
Your only one
