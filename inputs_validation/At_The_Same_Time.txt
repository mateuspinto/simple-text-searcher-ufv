Think of all the hearts  
Beating in the world  
At the same time  
Think of all the faces  
  
And the stories they could tell  
At the same time  
Think of all the eyes  
Looking out into this world  
  
Trying to make some sense of what we see  
Think of all the ways we have of seeing  
Think of all the ways there are of being  
Think of all the children  
  
Being born into this world  
At the same time  
Feel your love surround them  
Through the years theyll need to grow  
  
At the same time  
Just think of all the hands  
That will be reaching for a dream  
Think of all the dreams that could come true  
  
Yes if the hands were reaching with  
Could come together  
Joining me and you  
When it comes to thinking of tomorrow  
  
We must protect our fragile destiny  
In this prescious life theres no time to borrow  
The time has come to be a family  
Ohhh  
  
Think of all the love  
Pouring from our hearts  
At the same time  
Yes think of all the light our looks  
  
Can shine and grow this world  
At the same time  
At the same time  
Yes think what weve been givin  
  
And yet think what we could lose  
All of life is in our trembling hands  
Its time to overcome our fears  
And join to build a world that loves and understands  
  
It helps to think of all the hearts  
Beating in the world  
And hope for all the hearts  
Healing in the world  
  
Theres a healing music in our hearts  
Beating in this world  
At the same time  
At the same time
