Well I wonder whats exactly the matter  
Child you know the time  
Seemed like an hour  
Everything had changed  
  
But I hold up my head  
Girl Im just trying to make you understand  
Well now everybody tell me  
Somebody hoodood the hoodoo man  
  
Well now I buzzed your bell this morning  
You had your elevator run slow  
I buzzed your bell in woman  
Take me on the third floor  
  
Well I hold up my head  
Girl Im just trying to make you understand  
Well now everybody tell me  
Somebody hoodood the hoodoo man
