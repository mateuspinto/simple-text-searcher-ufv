Here comes the rain again  
Falling on my head like a memory  
Falling on my head like a new emotion  
I want to walk in the open wind  
I want to talk like lovers do  
I want to dive into your ocean  
Is it raining with you  
  
So baby talk to me  
Like lovers do  
Walk with me  
Like lovers do  
Talk to me  
Like lovers do  
  
Here comes the rain again  
Raining in my head like a tragedy  
Tearing me apart like a new emotion  
Oh  
I want to breathe in the open wind  
I want to kiss like lovers do  
I want to dive into your ocean  
Is it raining with you  
  
So baby talk to me  
Like lovers do  
  
Here comes the rain again  
Falling on my head like a memory  
Falling on my head like a new emotion  
Here is comes again here it comes again  
I want to walk in the open wind  
I want to talk like lovers do  
I want dive into your ocean  
Is it raining with you
