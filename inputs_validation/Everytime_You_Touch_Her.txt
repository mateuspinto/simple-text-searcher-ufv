Do you hold her all night long  
Do you sing her our love song  
Do you kiss her lips until love makes her weak  
Oh darlin  
Do you promise her the moon  
Does she think loves coming soon  
Does she know each move is made from memory  
Oh darlin  
  
Everytime you touch her Every time  
Everytime you touch her think of me  
  
When she reaches out for you   
the same way my arms do  
does she know the truth your love belongs to me Oh baby  
Do you wonder in the dark if she sees into your heart  
Do you close your eyes so she will never see  
  
Oh baby  
Everytime you touch her   
Every time  
Everytime you touch her  
think of me  
  
Nights were never made to spend alone  
I can wish you love  
but I cant wish you gone  
  
Do you hold her all night long  
Do you sing her our love song  
Do you kiss her lips until love makes her weak  
oh darlin  
Everytime you touch her  
Every time  
Everytime you touch her  
think of me
