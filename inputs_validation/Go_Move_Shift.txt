Born in the middle of the afternoon  
In a horsedrawn carriage on the old A5  
The big twelve wheeler shook my bed  
You cant stay here the policeman said  
  
Chorus  
  
Youd better get born in some place else  
So move along get along Move along get along  
Go Move Shift  
  
Born in the common by a building site  
Where the ground was rutted by the trail of wheels  
The local Christian said to me  
Youll lower the price of property  
  
Chorus  
  
Born at potato picking time  
In a noble tent in a tatie field  
The farmer said The works all done  
Its time that you was moving on   
  
Chorus  
  
Born at the back of a hawthorn hedge  
Where the black hole frost lay on the ground  
No eastern kings came bearing gifts  
Instead the order came to shift  
  
Chorus  
  
The eastern sky was full of stars  
And one shone brighter than the rest  
The wise men came so stern and strict  
And brought the orders to evict  
  
Chorus  
  
Wagon tent or trailer born  
Last month last year or in far off days  
Born here or a thousand miles away  
Theres always men nearby wholl say  
  
Chorus  
  
The sleeve notes from Live at the Point  
Has two extra verses added by Christy  
  
Six in the morning out in Inchicore  
The guards came through the wagon door  
John Maughan was arrested in the cold  
A travelling boy just ten years old  
  
Chorus  
  
Mary Joyce was living at the side of the road  
No halting place and no fixed abode  
The vigilantes came to the Darndale site  
And they shot her son in the middle of the night  
  
Chorus
