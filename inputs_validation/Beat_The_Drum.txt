I still hear the snares in the square  
Colors ablaze in the evening  
The air was still down the stormy hills  
Its good to be young and daring  
  
She was the pride of the summer that year  
She was my sweetheart my lady  
We walked to Black Rock and stopped by the Loch  
Its good to be young and daring  
  
Chorus  
Beat the drum Beat the drum  
Like a heartbeat Lonely and Strong  
Beat the Drum  
  
Across the bay I can still hear the strains  
The two step loud and blaring  
We walked hand and hand to the beat of the band  
Its good to be young and daring  
  
I still hear the snares in the square  
Colors ablaze in the evening  
She was the pride of the summer that year  
Its good to be young and daring
