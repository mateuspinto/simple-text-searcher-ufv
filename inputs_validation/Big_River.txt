Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry  
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky  
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River  
Then Im gonna sit right here until I die  
  
I met her accidentally in St Paul Minnesota  
And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl Southern drawl  
Then I heard my dream was back Downstream cavortin in Davenport  
And I followed you Big River when you called  
  
Then you took me to St Louis later on down the river  
A freighter said shes been here but shes gone boy shes gone  
I found her trail in Memphis but she just walked up the block  
She raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone  
  
Now wont you batter down by Baton Rouge River Queen roll it on  
Take that woman on down to New Orleans New Orleans  
Go on Ive had enough dump my blues down in the gulf  
She loves you Big River more than me  
  
Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry cry cry  
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky  
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River  
Then Im gonna sit right here until I die
