I might have been a helpless soul with nothing much in store  
I might have been without a goal just dreams and nothing more  
I might have known life alone but thats where you came in  
Your lovin arms have saved me from the things I might have been  
I might have been a kind who roam a stranger everywhere  
Or one of those wholl stay at home with no ones dreams to share  
But your sweet kiss has changed all this and made my life begin  
Keep lovin me dont let me be the things I might have been  
 guitar   
Your sweet kiss has changed all this
