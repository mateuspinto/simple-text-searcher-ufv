Here I come to save the day  
  
A little boy inside a dream just the other day  
His mind fell out of his face and the wind blew it away  
A hand came out and happened to pin that bag on his chest  
It said get out there man and a do your best  
  
And hes called the astro man  
And hes flyin higher than  
That old faggot superman  
Ever could  
  
Oh they call him cosmic nut  
And hes twice as dense as Donald Duck  
And hell try his best to screw you up  
The rest of your mind  
Oh look out my guitars  
  
Astro man flyin across the sky  
Two times higher than  
That old faggot superman  
Ever ever could  
Ever could  
  
There he goes there he goes  
Where he stops no one knows  
There he goes there he goes uh  
Hes tryin to tryin to blow out the rest of your mind  
Hes gonna blow out the rest of your mind  
Talkin about lookin for peace of mind  
Astro man will leave it in pieces  
Have you put our trouble behind him  
Make you fly around in pieces  
Yeah blow out the rest of your mind  
Astro man will blow out the rest of your mind  
Hes gonna blow out the rest of your mind  
Ooohoo  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Blow out the rest of of your mind
