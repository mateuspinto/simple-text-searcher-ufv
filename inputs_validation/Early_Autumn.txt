When an early autumn walks the land and chills the breeze  
And touches with her hand the summer trees  
Perhaps youll understand what memories I own  
Theres a dance pavilion in the rain all shuttered down  
  
A winding country lane all russet brown  
A frosty window pane shows me a town grown lonely  
That spring of ours that started so Aprilhearted  
Seemed made for just a boy and girl  
  
I never dreamed did you any fall would come in view  
So early early  
Darling if you care please let me know  
Ill meet you anywhere I miss you so  
Lets never have to share another early autumn
