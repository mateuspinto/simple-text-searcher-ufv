Jazz  
Fire eating dragqueens dressed as society whores  
Crazy two timing bitches running round  
Ghetto blasting blasters blasting magnificently  
Blossoms falling from the cherry trees  
Thats what jazz is to me  
  
High buildings with crippled backs circle around my dreams  
I clutch at the greasy tails of my dreams  
White blossom falling from the cherry trees  
Thats what jazz is to me  
  
Ten bottles standing in a row military style  
With hats pulled low over their brows  
A thousand wasted hours  
Skeletons entwined fucking and braying Fields  
Blossoms falling from the cherry tree  
Thats what jazz is to me  
  
History repeating itself like a  
All the great cars of the world in one massive collision  
All the doctors swallowed up by one incompetence  
All the great theorists and teachers eaten alive  
Religious extacy and a blossom falling from a cherry tree  
Thats what jazz is to me  
  
Blind fish being used as musical scales  
Sharks puffed for fish and whales  
I long to be by the sea where a blossom falls from a cherry tree  
Thats what jazz is to me  
  
Three forms four forms five forms six forms  
Seven forms eight forms nine forms  
A blossom falling from the cherry tree  
Thats what jazz is to me  
  
As Einstein said about his theory  
I love I love I love I love jazz  
Its in your heart its in your soul its in your mind  
The colour of death sweet vanilla essence  
Richard Harris and Donald Pleasance  
And a cherry blossom falling from a cherry tree  
Thats what jazz is to me
