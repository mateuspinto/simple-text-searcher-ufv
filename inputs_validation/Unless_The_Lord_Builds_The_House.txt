Unless the lord builds the house  
They labor in vain to try at all  
Building anything not according to his call  
Unless the lord wants it done  
You better not work another day  
Building anything that will stand in his way  
You love the lord and it seems like hes been leading  
Youve asked him to bless all your plans  
But are you so sure youre just doing what you want to  
Building your house on the sand the sand  
  
Unless the lord builds the house  
They labor in vain to try at all  
Building anything not according to his call  
Unless the lord wants it done  
You better not work another day  
Building anything that will stand in his way  
Working so hard at the things that you believe in  
No one can tear you away  
But dont you lose sight of the very one who calls you  
You may be sorry some day some day  
For wood hay and stubble will all burn up in the fire  
But to love the lord with all your heart should be your one desire  
Love the lord  
  
Unless the lord wants it done  
You better not work another day  
Building anything that will stand  
Anything that will stand anything that will stand
