Frogs with dirty little lips  
Dirty little warts on their fingertips  
Dirty n green  
Tiny n mean  
Floppin around  
By the edge of the stream  
Frogs with dirty little eyes  
Dirty little tongues all covered with flies  
Dirty brown  
Floppin around  
Puffed up n bloated  
When the sun goes down  
Frogs with dirty little nose  
Dirty little spots all over their clothes  
Dirty legs  
Dirty feet  
Dirty little frogs is what you eat
