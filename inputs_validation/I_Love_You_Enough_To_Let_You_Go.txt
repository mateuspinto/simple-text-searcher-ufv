Ive rehearsed this day a thousand times  
Ive played this scene out in my mind  
You spread your wings you need to fly  
It breaks my heart to say goodbye  
These arms of mine want to pull you close  
But I love you enough to let you go  
  
My mind goes back to memories  
Of pony rides upon my knee  
First day of school your brand new bike  
And football games on Friday nights  
And through the years Ive watched you grow  
And I love you enough to let you go  
  
Dont look back when you drive away  
I dont want to change your mind  
I know in all your eighteen years  
Youve never seen your daddy cry  
  
So many things I want to say  
Youll meet new friends youll be okay  
Ill pray for you out on your own  
But dont forget your way back home  
And though I may not let it show  
I love you enough to let you go  
  
Dont look back when you drive away  
I dont want to change your mind  
I know in all your eighteen years  
Youve never seen your daddy cry  
  
These arms of mine want to pull you close  
But I love you enough to let you go
