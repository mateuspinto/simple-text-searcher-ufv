Verse 1  
We both know that its not fashionable to love me  
But you dont go cause truly theres nobody for you but me  
We could cruise to the blues  Wilshire Boulevard if we choose  
Or whatever you want to do we make the rules

Our honeymoon  
Say you want me too  
Say you want me too  
Dark blue  
Dark blue  
  
Verse 2  
We both know the history of violence that surrounds you  
But Im not scared theres nothing to lose now that Ive found you  
We could cruise to the news  Pico Poulevard in your used little bullet car if
we choose  
Mr Born to Lose  
  
Chorus  
Our honeymoon  
Our honeymoon  
Our honeymoon  
Say you want me too

Dark blue  
  
Bridge  
There are violets in your eyes  
There are guns that blaze around you  
There are roses in between my thighs  
And a fire that surrounds you  
Its no wonder every man in town  
Had neither fought nor found you  
Everything you do is elusive  
To even your honey dew  
  
Chorus  Variation  
Our honeymoon  
Our honeymoon  
Our honeymoon
