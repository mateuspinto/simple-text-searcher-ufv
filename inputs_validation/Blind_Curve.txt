I Vocal Under A Bloodlight  
Last night you said I was cold untouchable  
A lonely piece of action from another town  
I just want to be free Im happy to be lonely  
Cant you stay away  
Just leave me alone with my thoughts  
Just a runaway just a runaway  
Im saving myself  
  
II Passing Strangers  
  
Strung out below a necklace of carnival lights  
Cold moan held on the crest of the night  
Im too tired to fight  
  
So now were passing strangers at single tables  
Still trying to get over  
Still trying to write love songs for passing strangers  
All those passing strangers  
And the twinkling lies all those twinkling lies  
Sparkle with the wet ink on the paper  
  
III Mylo  
  
Oh I remember Toronto when Mylo went down  
And we sat and cried on the phone  
I never felt so alone  
He was the first of our own  
Some of us go down in a blaze of obscurity  
Some of us go down in a haze of publicity  
The price of infamy the edge of insanity  
  
Another Holiday Inn another temporary home  
And an interviewer threatened me with a microphone  
Talk to me wont you tell me your stories  
  
So I talked about conscience and I talked about pain  
And he looked out the window and it started to rain  
I thought maybe Ive already gone crazy  
So I reached for a bottle and he reached for the door  
And I picked up the sleeping pills crushed on the floor  
Inviting me to a casual obscenity  
  
IV Perimeter Walk  
  
It would be incredible if we could  
Retrace all the times that we lived here  
All the collisions  
Wasted Ive never been so wasted  
Ive never been this far out before  
  
Perimeter walk  
Theres a presence here  
I feel could have been ancient  
I could have been mystical  
  
Theres a presence  
A child my child  
My childhood a misplaced childhood  
Give it back to me give it back to me  
A childhood that childhood  
Oh please give it back to me  
  
V Threshold  
  
I saw a war widow in a launderette  
Washing the memories from her husbands clothes  
She had medals pinned to a threadbare greatcoat  
A lump in her throat with cemetery eyes  
  
I see convoys curbcrawling West German Autobahns  
Trying to pick up a war  
Theyre going to even the score  
Oh I cant take any more  
I see black flags on factories  
Soup ladies poised on the lips of the poor  
I see children with vacant stares destined for rape in the alleyways  
Does anybody care I cant take any more  
Should we say goodbye  
  
I see priests politicians  
Heroes in black plastic bodybags under nations flags  
I see children pleading with outstretched hands  
Drenched in napalm this is no Vietnam  
  
I cant take any more should we say goodbye  
How can we justify  
They call us civilised
