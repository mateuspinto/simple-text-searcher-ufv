Youre having a hard time and lately you dont feel so good  
Youre getting a bad reputation in your neighborhood  
Its alright  
Its alright  
Sometimes thats what it takes  
Youre only human  
Youre allowed to make your share of mistakes  
You better believe there will be times in your life  
When youll be feeling like a stumbling fool  
So take it from me youll learn more from your accidents  
Than anything that you could ever learn at school  
Dont forget your second wind  
Sooner of later youll get your second wind  
Its not always easy to be living in this world of pain  
Youre gonna be crashing into stone walls again and again  
Its alright  
Its alright  
Though you feel your heart break  
Youre only human  
Youre gonna have to deal with heartache  
Just like a boxer in a title fight  
You got to walk in that ring all alone  
Youre not the only one whos made mistakes  
But theyre the only thing that you can truly call your own  
Dont forget your second wind  
Wait in that corner until that breeze blows in  
Youve been keeping to yourself these days  
Cause youre thinking everythings gone wrong  
Sometimes you just want to lay down and die  
That emotion can be so strong  
But hold on  
Till that old second wind comes along  
You probably dont want to hear advice from someone else  
But I wouldnt be telling you if I hadnt been there myself  
Its alright  
Its alright  
Sometimes thats all it takes  
Were only human  
Were supposed to make mistakes  
But I survived all those long lonely days  
When it seemed I did not have a friend  
Cause all I needed was a little faith  
So I could catch my breath and face the world again  
Dont forget your second wind  
Sooner or later youll feel that momentum kick in  
Dont forget your second wind  
Sooner or later youll feel that momentum kick in
