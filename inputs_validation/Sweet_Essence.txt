Verse 1  
Somebody asked me how I knew  
Oh you were the one for me baby  
And I was the one for you  
I never had to ask myself that question why  
  
Chorus  
Your love is something that I know is mine  
Your love is something that I cant deny  
Your love is something that I feel inside  
  
Verse 2  
Oh everyday I thank the lord above  
For the sweet essence of your love  
Oh I know this love was meant to be  
You are the biggest part of me  
Deeper than the deepest ocean  
Oh I take the pride in knowing  
That I got you by my side  
Ever waiting ever standing by  
  
Chorus  
Your love is something that I know is mine  
Your love is something that I cant deny  
Your love is something that I feel inside  
  
Verse 3  
Not an hour out of the million days  
Could you ever take your sweet love away  
Not a one day out of the million years  
Could I ever live without you here  
Inside everyday I thank the lord above  
For the sweetness of your love  
Kindness of your love  
Patience of you love  
One and only lover  
Never be another  
  
Chorus  
Your love is something that I know is mine  
Your love is something that I cant deny  
Your love is something that I feel inside
