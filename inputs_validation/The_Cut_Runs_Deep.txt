Got your finger on the trigger  
Your cold eyes taking aim  
You took a shot at my heart  
Let the bullets fly  
Tell me has one of them got my name  
  
What about the heartache  
What about the emptiness inside  
It doesnt just fade away  
Turning the knife  
How much can I bleed  
The cut runs deep  
  
I cant find no salvation  
Cant find no healing touch  
Reaching out for mercy  
A stranger in your eyes  
I want you too much  
  
What about the heartache  
What about the emptiness inside  
It doesnt just fade away  
Turning the knife  
How much can I bleed  
The cut runs deep
