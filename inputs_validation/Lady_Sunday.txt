La da da da da la da  
Oh yeah yeah  
  
Where theres no sun there is that girl  
She is the one that spins my world  
When I am down she makes it better  
When there are clouds she change the weather  
Not wishing well oh my peace and my glory  
As a fairytale then she is my story  
When I feel drained her love is like a fountain  
And when Im weak she can move mountains  
  
I never felt a love no this way  
I never felt a kiss no this way  
I never felt joy this way  
Till my lady Sunday came  
  
Oh I am her crown and he is my sky  
If life is a road then she is my ride  
When Im in pain shes my good feeling  
When I am sick she brings me healing  
Whenever I call she is right there  
And when I fall she says a prayer  
When it comes to making love to me she knows how to do it

I never felt a kiss no this way

Till my lady Sunday came
