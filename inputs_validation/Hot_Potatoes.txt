My baby woke me up this mornin  
She said get down that labor exchange  
And if you dont come home with a job son  
Youll get no dinner today  
You gotta secure me a weekly workin wage  
Youll get no more fancy cookin  
Youll get no more apple pie  
Youll just get those plain hot potatoes  
To satisfy your appetite  
  
La la la la la la Potatoes  
Boiled French fried any old way that you wanna decide  
Hot potatoes yeh  
I want your lovin every single day  
  
I said I dont need your fancy cooking  
I like the simple things in life  
Just give me those plain hot potatoes  
And Ill be well satisfied  
Theyll satisfy my appetite  
  
La la la la la la Potatoes  
Boiled French fried any old way that you wanna decide  
Hot potatoes yeh  
I want your lovin sixty minutes an hour  
I want your lovin twenty four hours a day  
I want your lovin seven days a week  
Yeh yeh oh yeh  
I want your love I need your love  
But all I get is hot potatoes  
When I come home late at night  
To satisfy my appetite  
  
Dont give me no more potatoes  
Boiled French fried any old way you wanna decide  
Hot potatoes  
I want your lovin every single day  
I want your lovin  
  
La la la la la la Potatoes  
Boiled French fried any old way that you wanna decide  
Hot potatoes Hot potatoes yeh
