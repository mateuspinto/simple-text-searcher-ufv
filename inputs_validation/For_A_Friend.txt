When I saw him last  
He had that look in his eyes  
I said Do you need to talk  
He said No  
So I called him up asked him again and I waited a while   
He began to speak then he started to cry  
  
You know some things are best left unspoken  
And some things just never work out  
And sometimes seems you try and you try and whatever you do  
Theres a fix that youre in and you just cant get out  
He said I need your help I need it now  
Give me the strength to go on  
  
Though I didnt know what  
I knew that something was wrong  
But he still had his pride  
Hed tell me in time  
Well this feeling inside  
Kept eating at me  
I was losing a friend and I had to know why  
  
When I heard the voice on the phone I knew it was bad news  
So I rushed to be by his side  
And we said goodbye for the last time  
I gently hugged him and kissed him goodbye  
He whispered I need your help I need it now  
Give me the strength to go on   
  
We were always laughing  
I just remember laughing mama  
We were always laughing  
  
Oh I need your help I need it now  
Give me the strength to go on  
  
Though as time goes by and it all becomes clear  
We can see the deceit we see the lies  
So I asked myself over and over and over again  
What did they know What did they hide  
Fools leading the innocent blindly  
Fools turning away  
  
And I know that  
When I think of my friend with that look in his eyes  
And if they told the truth he might be here today  
I need your help I need it now  
Just give me the strength to go on on  
  
I remember the laughing  
We were always laughing  
  
Oh no  its just strength we need now  
Just the strength to go on
