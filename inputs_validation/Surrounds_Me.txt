Put your coal to my trembling lips  
Voice fills void with your breath  
Crescent tears from the relief you bring  
Undone in you I love you  
Broken teeth of my frustration  
Your glory it surrounds me  
Sing praises to God sing praises  
  
Blanket my mind  
with your wisdom and insight  
Hand molds the mud of my heart  
Joy of your strength  
Overwhelms my praise  
Quickened in you  
I praise you  
Vibrant peace envelopes my lack  
Your glory it surrounds me  
  
Sing praises to God  
  
Sing praises  
  
Put your coal to my trembling lips  
Voice fills void with your breath  
Crescent tears from the relief you bring  
Undone in you I love you  
Broken teeth of my frustration  
Your glory it surrounds me  
Your glory it surrounds me  
  
Put your coal to my trembling lips  
Voice fills void with your breath  
Crescent tears from the relief you bring  
Undone in you I love you
