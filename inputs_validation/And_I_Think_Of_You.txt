Where did you go  why did you run  
What did you need from me you felt we were missing  
Now you never write  and you never call  
  
What did you want  I couldnt give  
You shouldve told me baby I would have listened  
Why did you leave  when we had it all  
  
And I think of you  
Yes I think of you  
  
Chorus  
Everywhere I go  anytime of the day  
Every move I make  every word that I say  
If I let myself I get carried away  
When I think of you  
I still think of you  
  
Time on my hands doesnt seem right  
Ill never get used to this single life  
And now I wonder what youre doing tonight  
  
We got away from it all  
In a house upon the hill  
I loved you then and I always will  
Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh
