It was a cold  
And dark December night  
But a star  
Still lit the sky  
Away in a manger  
You heard a baby cry  
It was the cry  
Of the Son of God  
A little baby boy  
Born in that manger  
To bring the world joy  
  
So hush up little baby  
You know not what youll do  
Youll bring the world  
Peace and love  
And teach them while you do  
You have nothing  
To fear because you know  
God is with you all the way  
That little important baby  
Born on Christmas day  
  
Many people soon gathered  
Round that tiny run down barn  
They knew not of what they saw  
Then came three all dressed  
In fancy robes  
Silks and furs  
This was the first indication  
Of the importance of his birth  
  
So hush up little baby  
You know not what youll do  
Youll bring the world  
Peace and love  
And teach them while you do  
You have nothing  
To fear because you know  
That God will lead the way  
That little important baby  
Born on Christmas day  
  
We expected a soldier  
Tto save us from our plight  
All dressed in shiny armor  
Ready for a fight  
But instead he sent  
A little baby boy  
All filled  
With love happiness  
To bring the world joy  
  
So hush up little baby  
You know not what youll do  
Youll bring the world  
Peace and love  
And teach them while you do  
You have nothing to fear  
Because you know  
That God will lead the way  
That little important baby  
Born on Christmas day  
That little important baby  
Born on Christmas day
