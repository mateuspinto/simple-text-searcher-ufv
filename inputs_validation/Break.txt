I cannot take this anymore  
Im saying everything Ive said before  
All these words they make no sense  
I find bliss in ignorance  
Less I hear the less youll say  
Youll find that out anyway  
  
Just like before  
  
Everything you say to me  
Takes me one step closer to the edge  
And Im about to break  
I need a little room to breathe  
Cause Im one step closer to the edge  
And Im about to break  
  
I find the answers arent so clear  
Wish I could find a way to disappear  
All these thoughts they make no sense  
I find bliss in ignorance  
Nothing seems to go away  
Over and over again  
  
Just like before  
  
Every thing you say to me  
Takes me one step closer to the edge  
And Im about to break  
I need a little room to breathe  
Cause Im one step closer to the edge  
And Im about to break  
Every thing you say to me  
Takes me one step closer to the edge  
And Im about to break  
I need a little room to breathe  
Cause Im one step closer to the edge  
And Im about to break  
  
Shut up when Im talking to you  
Shut up Shut up Shut up  
Shut up when Im talking to you  
Shut up Shut up Shut up Shut up  
Im about to break  
  
Every thing you say to me  
Takes me one step closer to the edge  
And Im about to break  
I need a little room to breathe  
Cause Im one step closer to the edge  
And Im about to break
