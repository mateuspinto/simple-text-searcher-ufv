Mop mop A thousand years ago  
Mop mop A guy named Jungle Joe  
Was a drummer man in a Zulu band  
That made swing history  
  
Mop mop One day the king said Gate  
Why Gate you old reprobate  
I commission you find a riff thats new  
Or your wig belongs to me  
  
Joes knees started knockin  
So scared he was stiff  
Til he noticed the tribe was rockin  
As his knees beat out this mellow riff  
  
Mop mop From the tropics heat  
Mop mop Came this jungle beat  
Though old Joe is gone his jive lives on  
And it still is making history

Though old Joe is gone his jive lives on  
And it still is making history
