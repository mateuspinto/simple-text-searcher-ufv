UK Bonus Track  
  
When I was a little boy  
I looked under the stairs  
The King and the Pawns  
Were caught unawares  
Standing in the shadows  
A whisperer to be  
Just fishing in the darkness  
Of possibilities  
  
Just look at you now  
Yeah  
Look at you now  
Yeah  
Oh  
Look at you now  
  
Among such style and grace  
Our highest hopes  
None standing  
Still the running joke  
Where goes the warm embrace  
It fades without return  
It lives to slip through fingertips and burn  
  
Just look at you now  
Oh  
Look at you now  
Ohh  
look at you now  
Ohh  
Look at you now
