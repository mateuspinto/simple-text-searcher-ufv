In the bush bush bush bushes in the park  
in the bush bush bush bush bush  
in the bush bushes in the park  
  
if shampoos on your bread then  ooh  youve got the head of a fool drop
dead in   
  
if subway cars are full of hearts  
then someones probably in   
  
if the bushes in the park grown in the dark then someones probably makin   
  
if a man with a knife is after his wife  
then that may have to do with   
  
love is such an innocent word  
the largest understatement ive heard  
almost anything we do  be it bad or good  we do to get love  
such an innocent world  
  
if youre singing in the rain  
then my youve got the brain of a guy drop dead in   
  
if his sneaker toes smell like a rose  
then girl you really must be in   
  
if you say you love the soup when you actually want to puke now isnt that a
sign of   
  
if a man wants the power to build the highest tower  
then thats his substitute for   
  
no matter what we do im telling you all we really want is   
  
love is such an innocent word  
the largest understatement ive heard  
almost anything we do  be it bad or good  we do to get love  
such an innocent world
