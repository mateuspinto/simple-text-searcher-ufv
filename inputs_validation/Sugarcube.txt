Whatever you want from me whatever you want Ill do  
Try to squeeze a drop of blood from a sugarcube  
  
Try to be more assured try to be more right there  
Try to be less uptight try to be more aware  
Whatever you want from me is what I want to do for you  
Sweeter than a drop of blood from a sugarcube  
  
And though I like to act the part of being tough  
I crumble like a sugarcube for you  
  
Whatever you want from me whatever you want Ill do  
I will try
