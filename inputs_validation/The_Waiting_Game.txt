I heard the stomping of feet dancing  
On the wooden floor upstairs  
I wasnt in the mood for laughing  
So I sat silent in my chair  
There was someone missing I knew  
Outside there fell the rain  
Where had she gone what could I do  
I played the waiting game  
The cigarette smoke was annoying  
My mood was fit for a bath  
A drink couldnt oil my expression  
Nothing couldve made me laugh  
I was worried out of my head  
I was in such a state  
Whats keeping her where has she gone  
I played the waiting game  
When you love someone  
You worry when theyre late  
When you trust someone  
You know the time it takes  
To play the waiting game  
The music got louder and louder  
From the wooden floor upstairs  
I played with a handful of peanuts  
Then I saw her standing there  
My mood leapt right out of the bath  
She had got stuck in the rain  
Her coat dripped on a hanger  
Playing the waiting  
I couldnt understand her  
Playing the waiting  
Seemed like Id wait forever  
Playing the waiting game
