A man lay dying in the streets  
A thousand people fell down on their knees  
Any other day he would have been  
Preaching  
Reaching all the people there  
Oh Lord Lord  
  
But Lord knows I cant change what I saw  
I Say God Rest His Soul  
  
The Memphis battleground was red  
Cause blood came pouring from his head  
Women and children fallin down  
Crying  
For the man they loved so well  
Oh Lord Lord  
But Lord knows I cant change what I saw  
I say God rest his soul  
  
I break here  
  
But Lord knows I cant change what I saw  
I say God rest his soul  
  
The morning sun will rise again  
With all the passions growing thin  
What we gonna do when war is come and were  
Dying  
Dying for the cause I know  
  
Yeah but  
But Lord knows I cant change what I saw  
Say God rest his soul
