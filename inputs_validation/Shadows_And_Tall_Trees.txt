Back to the cold restless streets at night  
I talk to myself about tomorrow night  
Walls of white protest  
A gravestone in name  
Who is it now  
Its always the same  
  
Who is it now  
Who calls me inside  
Are the leaves on the trees  
Just living disguise  
I walk sweet rain tragicomedy  
Ill walk home again  
To the street melody  
  
But I know oh no  
But I know oh no  
But I know  
  
Shadows and tall trees  
Shadows and tall trees  
Shadows and tall trees  
Shadows and tall trees  
  
Life through a window  
Discolored pain  
Mrs Browns washing is always the same  
I walk street rain tragicomedy  
Ill walk home again  
To the street melody  
  
But I know oh no  
But I know oh no  
But I know  
  
Out there  
  
Do you feel in me  
Anything redeeming  
Any worthwhile feeling  
Is love like a tightrope  
Hanging from the ceiling  
  
But I know oh no  
But I know oh no  
But I know  
  
Shadows and tall trees
