I once loved a girl her skin it was bronze  
With the innocence of a lamb she was gentle like a fawn  
I courted her proudly but now she is gone  
Gone as the season shes taken  
  
Through young summers breeze I stole her away  
From her mother and sister though close did they stay  
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day  
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us  
  
Of the two sisters I loved the young  
With sensitive instincts she was the creative one  
The constant scapegoat she was easily undone  
By the jealousy of others around her  
  
For her parasite sister I had no respect  
Bound by her boredom her pride to protect  
Countless visions of the other shed reflect  
As a crutch for her scenes and her society  
  
Myself for what I did I cannot be excused  
The changes I was going through cant even be used  
For the lies that I told her in hopes not to lose  
The couldbe dreamlover of my lifetime  
  
With unknown consciousness I possessed in my grip  
A magnificent mantelpiece though its heart being chipped  
Noticing not that Id already slipped  
To a sin of loves false security  
  
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace  
Answers of emptiness voice vacancies  
Till the tombstones of damage read me no questions but Please  
Whats wrong and whats exactly the matter  
  
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen  
The timeless explosion of fantasys dream  
At the peak of the night the king and the queen  
Tumbled all down into pieces  
  
The tragic figure her sister did shout  
Leave her alone God damn you get out  
And I in my armor turning about  
And nailing her to the ruins of her pettiness  
  
Beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound  
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground  
And she in between the victim of sound  
Soon shattered as a child neath her shadows  
  
All is gone all is gone admit it take flight  
I gagged twice doubled tears blinding my sight  
My mind it was mangled I ran into the night  
Leaving all of loves ashes behind me  
  
The wind knocks my window the room it is wet  
The words to say Im sorry I havent found yet  
I think of her often and hope whoever shes met  
Will be fully aware of how precious she is  
  
Ah my friends from the prison they ask unto me  
How good how good does it feel to be free  
And I answer them most mysteriously  
Are birds free from the chains of the skyway
