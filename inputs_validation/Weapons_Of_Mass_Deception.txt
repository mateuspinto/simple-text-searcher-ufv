We are the bastard children of a nation  
Whose dreams have died  
Everything we believe in it all  
Turned out to be a lie and change  
Seems oh so difficult acceptance is the  
Common voice Powerless against  
Their power we act like we dont have a  
Choice Go  
  
Weapons of mass deception  
Fear is the greatest weapon  
Used to maintain their control  
Cause the scared do what theyre told  
  
Dangers lurking in every corner minds  
Clouded with mistrust New  
Witches for them to burn smoke covers  
The bloodlust  
False fears installed in masses so real issues go ignored  
Like a phoenix rising from the ashes  
Total powers their reward Go  
  
Control through fear  
A reign of terror is here  
Control through fear  
The terrors powers made clear  
  
The end is near
