I wish I had a million friends and the playground as big as the world  
I wish I had a million friends some kittens some boys and some girls  
I wish I had a million friends some people some puppies and cats  
Some chickens some mouse and the bird  
  
And maybe Id like to have a big friendly rat yeah  
I wish I had a million friends and the sandbox as big as the school  
I wish I had a million friends and the frog that goes ribbit in the pool  
I wish I had a million friends Id like to have all different sorts  
  
One for the morning and the noon and the night  
A monkey and a zebra and a big white horse oh boy  
  
I wish I had a million friends who would listen and talk to me too  
I wish I had a million friends the whole wide world and the whole big Zoo  
I wish I had a million friends who were thoughtful kind and true  
I wish I had a million friends and I wish they were all like you
