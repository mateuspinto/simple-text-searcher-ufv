Well I can see what you mean  
It just takes me longer  
And I can feel what you feel  
It just makes you stronger  
  
I know I know I know  
Oh the feeling grows  
I see I see I see  
Its got to be  
You can take me for a little while  
You can take me you can make me smile  
In the end  
  
Well I can do what you do  
You just do it better  
And I can cry like you cry  
It just makes me sadder  
  
Well I can shine like you shine  
It doesnt make me brighter  
But if I think like you think  
It dont make my load much lighter
