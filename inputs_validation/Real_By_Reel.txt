In this secret time invading on our privacy  
Unknowing we mime we play for the ministry  
The can film you in bed  
Or when you take a bath  
They can tape every cry  
They can tape every laugh  
They can turn you around so you wont know whats  
  
Real by reel  
Busy little bees recording everything you feel  
On real by reel  
Documented down like rats  
Theyre catching up on every squeal  
On real by reel  
Real by reel by real by  
  
In this hidden time ignorance may help you to cope  
Rehearsing for crimes and sex just in government cinemascope  
The can film you at work  
Or when they let you play  
They can tape what you think  
They can tape what you say  
They cant blur your ID so you wont know whats  
  
Now I lay me down to sleep  
Knowing that your lenses peep  
Now I eat my daily bread  
And into the tape spool Ill be fed
