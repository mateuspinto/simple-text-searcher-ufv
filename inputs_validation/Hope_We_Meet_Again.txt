We could be anywhere tonight  
Could be right here underneath the lights  
I see the colours in your eyes  
Beautiful rainbows all around us  
We got the whole world in our hands  
This is the night we wont forget  
Whatever happens in the end  
I just hope I hope we meet again  
  
La la la la la  
La la la la la  
La la la la la  
  
I just hope I hope we meet again  
  
One things for certain two things for sure  
I heart radio I close show  
My lifes like Broadway  
No cameras welcome to the show  
One champ for them boys on dictment  
Broadway negro Im poster than post  
My boy I told ya baby coming back one day  
Throw this song to the world and watch her catch it like a bouquet  
Australia to UK jump the puddle straight to the States  
Its okay let em hate cause theyll be coming back one day dale  
  
We could be anywhere tonight  
Could be right here underneath the lights  
I see the colours in your eyes  
Beautiful rainbows all around us  
We got the whole world in our hands  
This is the night we wont forget  
Whatever happens in the end  
I just hope I hope we meet again  
  
La la la la la  
La la la la la  
La la la la la  
  
I just I hope we meet again  
  
Now the world is my backyard  
And I would like to thank yall  
Cause I was at a point point blank  
That I would point blank yall  
I found myself in turn I lost my mind  
Sometimes I feel like an old school Manny better lost in time  
They say to be wise is to know what you dont know  
And I dont know shit does that make me wise papo I dont know  
But this much I cant say to my best friend Eddie  
My father guarilla abuelo Rudy to my brother drama  
Ill be back for you one day  
  
We could be anywhere tonight  
Could be right here underneath the lights  
I see the colours in your eyes  
Beautiful rainbows all around us  
We got the whole world in our hands  
This is the night we wont forget  
Whatever happens in the end  
I just hope I hope we meet again  
  
La la la la la  
La la la la la  
La la la la la  
  
I hope we meet again  
I hope we meet again  
I hope we meet again
