Fragile seams  
I opened my too quick and all my dreams  
Were walking out Id slowly  
Lost my fire  
With every single man a river cried  
  
I had no sensation  
Completely numb left with no satisfaction  
I thought noone could ever get me high again  
I swear I was not looked  
  
Oh waited so long  
I thought the real thing was a fake  
I thought it was a tool to break me down  
You proved me wrong again  
  
If love were liquid it would drown me  
In a place less place would find me  
In a heart shape come around me and then  
Melt me slowly down  
If love were a human it would know me  
In a lost space come and show me  
Hold me and control me and then  
Melt me slowly down  
Like chocolate  
  
Tastes so good  
My hearts been mended whod have thought it would  
An empty bet and still I won the cash  
A man who I love and who  
Loves me back  
  
Oh waited so long  
For love to heal me so Id feel it  
Thought it wasnt breathing then you came  
You proved me wrong again  
  
If love were liquid it would drown me  
In a place less place would find me  
In a heart shape come around me and then  
Melt me slowly down  
If love were a human it would know me  
In a lost space come and show me  
Hold me and control me and then  
Melt me slowly down  
Like chocolate  
  
If love were liquid it would drown me  
In a place less place would find me  
In a heart shape come around me and then  
Melt me slowly down  
If love were a human it would know me  
In a lost space come and show me  
Hold me and control me and then  
Melt me slowly down  
  
Like chocolate come here

Theres no doubt its from you  
And Im addicted to it now  
  
Just one look boy to melt me down  
Just one heart here to save me now

Hold me tight baby dont let go
