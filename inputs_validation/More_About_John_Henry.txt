The Storytellers and I were doing a show down in Meridian Mississippi  
And these friends of mine came up and brought me this real old book  
About John Henry and they told me if they let me read this old book Id  
Probably write a song about it  
And they did and I did and I called it more About John Henry  
  
First of all John Henry was a black man  
He was born where the sun dont ever shine  
He was six feet tall he didnt know his own strength  
But he did not swing the hammer all the time  
Of course he didnt John Henry had some women on his mind  
  
There was a woman cross the street named Poor Selma  
Loved John Henry like a natural man  
John Henry quit Poor Selma just like he was quitting work  
He loved that stinger of Julie Anne  
And what is it a stinger is something else you understand  
  
There was a man named Stacker Lee in Argenta a little man with a big 44  
You know he shot his woman down and took a shot at Poor Selma  
But ol Stacker wont be shooting anymore  
He had to quit it John Henry laid him dead on the floor  
  
John Henry threw Stacker Lee in the river  
Then he said Ive got a say so to say  
He broke out in a song that was wrote by Blind Leonard  
He said Julie Anne Im singing my say  
He said I love you but I do not like your lowdown ways  
  
Well John Henry went to a conjuring woman  
Said this misery aint no way to live  
Somebodys back door creeping on my pretty Julie Anne  
Conjure woman had a say so to give  
She said John Henry she said Thats just the way things is  
  
Well John Henry went to a hell busting man  
Said Im tormented deep in my soul  
Well that hell buster prayed John Henrys sins away  
And they tell me that the thunder did roll  
Sweet Jesus what a frightening sight to behold  
  
From that day on John Henry was a changed man  
All he did was just work all the time  
Well he worked till the muscles in his body gave out  
Then he kept right on a working in his mind  
Dont do it cause a man aint supposed to work all the time  
  
Julie Anne said John Henry I love you  
Poor Selma said John Henry youre my man  
Ruby said Im gonna cook ye up some greens and some lean meat  
With corn bread in a four foot pan  
With lots of cracklings but John Henry was a different kinda man  
  
Well they allow that hard work killed John Henry  
Im gonna leave that allowing up to you  
Well was he killed by hard work or was he killed by bad women  
Be sure that this aint happening to you  
  
Quit working when your days work work is through  
Cause a man aint supposed to work all the time  
And aint that just the way the things is  
A stinger is something else you understand  
Quit working when your your days work is through God bless you
