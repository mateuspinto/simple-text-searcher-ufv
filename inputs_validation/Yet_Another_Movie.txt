One sound one single sound  
One kiss one single kiss  
A face outside the window pane  
However did it come to this  
  
A man who ran a child who cried  
A girl who heard a voice that lied  
The sun that burned a fiery red  
The vision of an empty bed  
  
The use of force he was so tough  
Shell soon submit shes had enough  
The march of fate the broken will  
Someone is lying very still  
  
He has laughed and he has cried  
He has fought and he has died  
Hes just the same as all the rest  
Hes not the worst hes not the best  
  
And still this ceaseless murmuring  
The babbling that I brook  
The seas of faces eyes upraised  
The empty screen the vacant look  
  
A man in black on a snow white horse  
A pointless life has run its course  
The red rimmed eyes the tears still run  
As he fades into the setting sun  
  
Youre going on that plane to take you where you belong  
But no I have  
You have got to listen to me  
Do you have any idea what you have to look forward to if you stay here  
Nine chances out of ten we both end up in a concentration camp and that  
Youre only saying these things to make me go  
Im saying it cause its true Inside us we both know we belong in different  
Maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but soon and for the rest of your life  
But what about us  
But what about us  
But what about us
