Coltrane repeat  
Round and round well chase  
Like a silver train  
Focused in a storm  
Comin through the rain  
Avalanche of notes  
Ships of crystal clear  
On this earth they fall  
But nobody seems to hear  
Coltrane repeat  
Round and round well chase  
Like a silver train  
Focused in a storm  
Comin through the rain  
Avalanche of notes  
Ships of crystal clear  
On this earth they fall  
But nobody seems to hear  
When I dream I fly  
Through this stormy world  
Ships of sound I ride  
Far from pain and fear  
To Coltranes sound so clear  
Coltrane
