I dont mind the sparrows stealin my seed  
The crow gettin fat on my corn  
But that beady eyed buzzard hangin round my gal  
Is gonna wish he never was born  never was born   
Let the hungry old hawk take a chicken or two  
And only the rooster will cry  
But the beady eyed buzzard hangin round my gal  
Is gonna wish he knew how to fly  
Better start flyin  
You better high tail it outta town  
Youre headin straight for trouble  
If you keep on a circling round  
You can fill up your pockets with ma seed an ma corn  
Take my horse load the wagon up too  
But you beady eyed buzzard stay away from my gal  
Or else its gonna be    the end of you  
 Better start flyin      
You better high tail it outta town  
Youre headin straight for trouble  
If you keep on a circling round  
You can fill up your pockets with ma seed an ma corn  
Take my horse load the wagon up too  
But you beady eyed buzzard stay away from my gal  
Or else its gonna be    the end of you  
   the end of you
