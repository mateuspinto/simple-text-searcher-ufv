If I could only shake the hand of time  
Cause time has been good to us  
Bringin us closer together  
I know our love is of a special kind  
A real everlasting love that keeps getting better and better  
  
Chorus  
Night after night night after night day after day  
The closer we get  with every minute  just tickin away  
Our love has come to see maturity  
And from the very day we said hello  
I washed out our love for all  
One million kisses later  
Our love is so much greater  
One million kisses after  
  
We share more love than laughter  
Weve been through a lot together  you and I  
But time has been good to us  
Givin us so much to treasure  
  
So many tomorrows we have left behind  
The future becomes harsh  
But this kind of love will last forever  
  
Chorus
