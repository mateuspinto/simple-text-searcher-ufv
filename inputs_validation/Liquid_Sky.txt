I aint no Romeo Im just the man for you  
Holding out as secrets travel they kind of get to you  
Everybody says that it couldve been something  
Never was a smart kid never knew a good thing  
  
Always hearing voices swim in your liquid sky  
Liquid Sky  
Always hearing voices like no more choices in disguise  
I aint no sacred idol or a saint pretending  
Ill build you up  
Ill tear you down  
Turn you wrong side in  
  
What am I afraid of Everyones listening  
Standing on my soapbox lost the beginning  
  
Always hearing voices swim in your liquid sky  
Liquid sky Im always hearing voices like no more choices like a lie  
Its just its just liquid sky  
  
Im always hearing voices like electric shock waves in disguise  
I dont know what this means  
Ill leave it for your interpretation  
Its just me at the edge  
Everybody says that it could have been something  
Never was a smart kid never knew a good thing  
  
Always hearing voices  
Swim in your liquid sky  
Liquid Sky Im always hearing voices like no more choices like a lie  
Its just its just liquid sky  
Im always hearing voices like electric shock waves in disguise  
Always hearing voices swim
