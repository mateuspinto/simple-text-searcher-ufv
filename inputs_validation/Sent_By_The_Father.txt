One more time youve heard the story  
Of our Saviors birth  
Heard how few beheld His glory  
When He came to earth  
Oh but soon every eye shall see Him  
Angels at His side  
See Him now on a great white stallion  
In the eastern sky  
CHORUS  
Sent by the Father  
Jesus go and call my children  
A trumpet sounds and the angels sing  
Like never before  
With shepherds and wise men  
We humbly bow  
And every tongue confess that He is Lord  
When He comes in all His glory  
Comes to claim His own  
We wont need a star to guide us  
Well be going home  
Once a baby in a manger  
No room at the inn  
Now a king who reigns forever  
Over death and sin  
CHORUS repeat 2X
