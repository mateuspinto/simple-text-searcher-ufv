When I was a child staring at the tube  
I saw sex violence and death on the news  
One day I saw the Duke kill someone  
Daddy said dont worry boy theyre just acting son  
  
All I want is attention from somebody  
Somebody pay attention to me  
Like them actors I got no shame  
I want my fifteen minutes of fame  
  
Doin as I see on my TV  
Doin as I see on my TV  
  
Can I get on the news if I kill my wife  
Would you respect me more if I took my life  
I tried to act and my career just flopped  
So I beat up my neighbors and I got on Cops  
  
All I wants a millions bucks from somebody  
Somebody pay a million bucks to me  
  
I could shoot and rape and kill  
And buy me a house in Beverly Hills please  
  
Doin as I see on my TV  
Doin as I see on my TV  
  
Id even do a porno flick like all them Hollywood chicks  
Im doin it as I see on my TV  
  
Took my girl to rent a porno movie  
I thought that itd be kinda groovy  
I thought thatd this impress my lover  
And there she was right on the cover  
  
All I want is attention from somebody  
Somebody pay attention to me  
Im a man I got no shame  
I want my fifteen minutes of fame  
  
Doin as I see on my TV  
Doin as I see on my TV  
  
Hell Id even do a porno flick like my hero Rocky did  
  
Doin as I see on my TV  
  
Whistling gargling  
  
I am not aware
