My turn this time he says  
Never get better than this  
We never get better than bad   
My turn this time he said  
Now I can do what I want  
Now I can walk away mad   
Cause last time we tried he said  
We never get anywhere  
We never solve anything   
Its my turn this time he said  
And sticks out his chin like a man  
Sticks out his chin like a man  
My turn this time they cried  
And everyone walks in a line  
Around in a circle until they die  
My turn this time they scream  
And diamonds and babies and cars  
Dont add up to anything  
My turn this time she says  
I wish we could talk a bit more  
Just give me a little more time   
My turn this time she says  
My children are growing up mad  
They never get anywhere   
This time she starts to cry  
And everyone stares at the ground  
Nobody says a word  
You get one chance each life she sighs  
And mine is just passing me by  
He walks out the door and she stares up at the ceiling  
My turn this time they cry  
And everyone walks in a line  
Around in a circle until they die  
My turn this time they scream  
And diamonds and babies and cars  
Dont add up to anything at all  
My turn this time he says  
And he turns the radio on  
And he turns the radio off  
My turn this time she says  
And she laughs at her self  
And she laughs at her self  
And the sun goes down  
And the sun comes up
