Brother havent you noticed  
Theres a war on the soul of man  
Hey there sister  
The world is reaching  
It could use a helping hand  
So come on  
No dues are needed  
Just a kind heart will be enough  
Theres a hunger  
But you can feed it  
Sign the card and join the club  
  
We are drawing from an ancient solution  
Were embarking on a new regime  
We are calling for a new revolution  
Be part of the parade  
Get on the Love Crusade  
  
Chorus  
Na na na na  
Na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na  
Na na na na  
Na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na  
  
Jesus said love your neighbor  
Like you would love yourself  
Get together  
Do Him a favor  
Give your love to someone else  
  
Just a little sets the wheels in motion  
A little more and we could change the world  
You can shine a light if you have the notion  
So get out of the shade  
Get on the Love Crusade  
  
Chorus  
  
Come on everyone  
Theres a lot that can be done  
A little love can go a long long way  
So rise to the occasion  
Of a radical invasion  
Hey Dont let the world go down in flames  
Fight the fire with a fire  
Push it to the limit  
And be a renegade  
Light a fusemake a spark  
Try to penetrate a heart  
Theres a burning need to fill the world with love  
Love is kind love is sound  
It makes the world go round  
So it keep it turning  
There could never be enough  
Hatredll spoil the feast  
Thats the nature of the beast  
So dont ever let your heart be swayed  
Draw the sword slay the dragon  
Get on the bandwagon  
And be a fighter on the Love Crusade  
  
We are drawing from an ancient solution  
Were embarking on a new regime  
We are calling for a new revolution  
Be part of the parade  
Get on the Love Crusade  
  
Chorus
