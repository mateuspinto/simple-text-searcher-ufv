Sun comes up moon goes down  
Heaven shine all around  
It feels my heart and moves my soul  
Because loving Him is better than gold  
  
In His arms  
Dreams comes true  
And in His eyes  
The world is new  
  
Diamonds beam  
And yes silver glows  
It glows  
But loving Him is better than gold  
  
He came when hope was  
My way gone  
I never I could love  
Knew so strong  
  
Ive walked some lonely roads before  
But now I search  
No more  
  
Cause this feels right I know its real  
The deeps truth has been revealed  
All the joy that a heart can hold  
Oh yeah yeah than gold  
Loving Him is better  
  
Than gold  
Than gold  
Than gold  
Than gold  
Than gold  
Better than gold  
  
Ive walked some lonely roads before  
But now I search no more  
This feels right its real  
I know  
  
The deeps truth has been revealed  
Hes all I need and all I know  
All I know is than gold  
Loving Him is better  
Loving Him is better  
Than gold  
  
Oh oh oh oh
