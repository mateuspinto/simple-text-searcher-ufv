She looks in the mirror and stares at the wrinkles  
That werent there yesterday  
And thinks of the young man that she almost married  
What would he think if he saw her this way  
  
She picks up her apron in little girlfashion  
As something comes into her mind  
Slowly starts dancing remembering her girlhood  
And all of the boys she had waiting in line  
  
Oh such are the dreams of the everyday housewife  
You see everywhere any time of the day  
An everyday housewife who gave up the good life for me  
  
The photograph album she takes from the closet  
And slowly turns the page  
And carefully picks up the crumbling flower  
The first one he gave her now withered today  
  
She closes her eyes and  
Touches the house dress that suddenly disappears  
And just for the moment shes wearing the gown  
That broke all their minds back so many years  
  
Oh such are the dreams of the everyday housewife  
You see everywhere any time of the day  
An everyday housewife who gave up the good life for me  
  
Oh such are the dreams of the everyday housewife  
You see everywhere any time of the day  
An everyday housewife who gave up the good life for me  
  
Oh such are the dreams of the everyday housewife  
You see everywhere any time of the day  
An everyday housewife  
Who gave up the good life for me
