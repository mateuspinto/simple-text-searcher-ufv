I feel like Im pounding on a big door  
No one can hear me knocking  
I feel like Im falling flat to the floor  
No one can catch me from falling  
The hourglass has no more grains of sand  
My watch has stopped no more turning hands  
The crew have abandoned ship  
The lights are on but now one is in

I feel like Im calling on a telephone  
No one can hear the ringing  
I feel like Im running up a steep hill  
No one can stop me from running  
The hourglass has no more grains of sand  
My watch has stopped no more turning hands  
The little hand shakes its fist  
The face is hanging out on a spring

The hourglass has no more grains of sand  
Little red grains of sand  
My watch has stopped now more turning hands  
Little green neon hands
