The spell has been broken the curse has been lifted  
Black is the wind on the heels of the gifted  
Four sworn to vengeance see the hate in our eyes  
Called by the gods and given a sign  
  
Onward pounding into glory ride  
Sign of the hammer be my guide  
Final warning all stand aside  
Sign of the hammer its my time  
  
Pounding pounding we are back from the dead  
Those who denied us are delivered instead  
Into the hands of four sworn to ride  
Now the people will triumph and live by the sign  
  
Onward pounding into glory ride  
Sign of the hammer be my guide  
Final warning all stand aside  
Sign of the hammer its my time  
  
The spell has been broken the curse has been lifted  
Black is the wind on the heels of the gifted  
Four sworn to vengeance see the hate in our eyes  
Called by the gods and given a sign  
  
Onward pounding into glory ride  
Sign of the hammer be my guide  
Final warning all stand aside  
Old man and young boys its my time  
Sign of the hammer its my time
