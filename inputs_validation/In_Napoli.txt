In Napoli beside the sea  
It happened on a night like this  
In Napoli our hearts were free  
And we surrendered to a kiss  
There neath the stars I saw heaven in her eyes  
There neath the stars I knew this was paradise  
All through the night in sweet delight  
We shared the tenderness of love  
But with the dawn my love was gone  
Just like the fading stars above  
My lonely heart cries out please come back to me  
Beside the sea in dear old Napoli  
There neath the stars I saw heaven in her eyes  
There neath the stars I knew this was paradise  
All through the night in sweet delight  
We shared the tenderness of love  
But with the dawn my love was gone  
Just like the fading stars above  
My lonely heart cries out please come back to me  
Beside the sea in dear old Napoli
