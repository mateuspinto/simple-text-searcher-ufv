Just down the street from your hotel baby  
I stay at home with my disease  
And aint this position familiar darling  
Well all monkeys do what they see  
Help me stay awake Im falling  
  
Down on Virginia and La Loma  
Where I got friends wholl care for me  
You got an attitude of everything I ever wanted  
I got an attitude of need  
Help me stay awake Im falling  
  
Asleep in perfect blue buildings  
Beside the green apple sea  
Gonna get me a little oblivion  
Try to keep myself away from me  
  
Its 430 AM on a Tuesday  
It doesnt get much worse than this  
In beds in little rooms in buildings in the middle  
of these lives which are completely meaningless  
Help me stay awake Im falling  
  
Asleep in perfect blue buildings  
Beside the green apple sea  
Gonna get me a little oblivion  
Try to keep myself away from myself and me  
  
I got bones beneath my skin and mister  
Theres a skeleton in every mans house  
Beneath the dust and love and sweat that hangs on everybody  
Theres a dead man trying to get out  
Please help me stay awake Im falling  
  
Asleep in perfect blue buildings  
Beside the green apple sea  
Gonna get me a little oblivion baby  
Try to keep myself away from me
