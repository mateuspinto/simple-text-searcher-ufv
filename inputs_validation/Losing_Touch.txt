Console me in my darkest hour  
Could this be that the truth is always gray  
Caress me in your velvet chair  
Conceal me from the ghost you cast away  
  
Im in no hurry you go run  
And tell your friends Im losing touch  
Fill their heads with rumors of impending doom  
It must be true  
  
Console me in my darkest hour  
And tell me that youll always hear my cries  
I wonder what you got conspired  
Im sure it was the consolation prize  
  
Im in no hurry you go run  
And tell your friends Im losing touch  
Fill the night with stories the legend grows  
Of how you got lost  
  
But you made your way back home  
You sold your soul like a Roman vagabond yeah  
  
I heard you found a wishing well  
In the city  
Console me in my darkest hour in my darkest hour  
And you throw me down  
  
Im in no hurry you go run  
And tell your friends Im losing touch  
Fill your crown with rumors  
Impending doom it must be true  
  
But you made your way back home  
You sold your soul like a Roman vagabond  
  
And all that now you got lost but you made your way back home  
You went and sold your soul an allegiance dead and gone  
Im losing touch
