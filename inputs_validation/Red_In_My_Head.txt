Red In My Head  
Smiling faces on the wall  
I took a walk down the hall  
I banged my fist against the door  
I tossed a quarter to the whore  
The Camera flashes in my eyes  
I spread the news she spreads her thighs  
Red red in my head  
Red red in my head  
  
I grabbed her knuckles and I yanked them all  
I bent her in half like a barbie doll  
Love hate viscerate  
Take this flesh and meditate  
  
I sat there with her  
We sat there 2  
She said to me  
What should we do  
Well I know some tricks  
And Ill show them to you  
Your mother wont mind at all if I do  
To you  
  
The poor little girl  
The poor little girl  
The poor little girl didnt know what to say  
For her mother was out of the house today  
Today  
Today  
Red red in my head  
Red red in my head  
  
  
The poor little girl  
The poor little girl  
The poor little girl didnt know what to say  
For her mother was out of the house today  
Today  
Today  
Red red in my head  
Red red in my head  
  
  
Red red they call me red  
Red in bed  
The girl
