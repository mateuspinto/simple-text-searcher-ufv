A glowin fire and fallin snow they spark a memory  
Stockings hangin mistletoe presents beneath a tree  
A happy boy wakin up to toys lookin so surprised  
And wondering how Santa knew just when I closed my eyes  
Chorus  
Its a Homecoming Christmas goin back to where it all began  
Homecoming Christmas I wanna be there once again  
Memories do sweet and strong and Ive been done too long  
Its Christmas time and Im comin home  
I can see the Christmas tree and feel the warm fireplace  
Handmade decorations homemade pies and cakes  
Family all together with so much love to share  
A special time and I cant wait cant wait to be there  
Chorus
