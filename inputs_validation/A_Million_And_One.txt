How many teardrops  
Have I cried over you  
A million and one tears  
A million and two  
How many lonely nights  
Have my arms ached for you  
A million and one nights  
A million and two  
Loving you darlin  
While I thought you loved me only me  
But you were just fooling  
And the fool you were fooling was me  
How many sweet dreams  
Will never come true  
A million and one dreams  
A million and two  
Loving you darlin  
While I thought you loved me only me  
But you were just fooling  
And the fool you were fooling was me  
How many sweet dreams  
Will never come true  
A million and one dreams  
A million and two  
A million and one dreams  
A million and two
