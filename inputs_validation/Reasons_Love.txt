New feel of you running through my vein  
Little bit of everything  
You know thats what you said  
  
Chorus  
Try hard try hard to reason reasons love  
Try hard try hard to reason reasons love  
Cause always you indulge  
And parents try to get you out of these jams  
You got that envy cause they wont understand  
  
The social life you lead leaves nothin to desire  
Dont wanna see you bleed  
But you came on like a liar  
  
Chorus  
  
Wrecked myself to love you  
All you want is more  
One thing youre after  
You just try and score  
  
Chorus
