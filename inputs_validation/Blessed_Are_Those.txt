How blessed are those  
Blessed are those who walk with You  
How blessed are those  
Those whose hearts are always true  
  
Those who live in Your law  
Whose hearts seek after Thee  
How free their lives of sin  
How blessed their purity  
  
O how blessed are those  
Blessed are those who walk with You  
How blessed are those  
Those whose hearts are always true  
  
Oh that I had more strength  
In obeying Your decrees  
But I am trying Lord  
O God do not forsake me  
  
But bless me Lord  
Bless me as my heart seeks You  
And bless me Lord  
As I turn my life to You  
  
Turn to You
