Soldier is turning  
see him through white light  
running from strangers  
see you in the valley  
war upon war  
heat upon heat  
To cut a long story short  
I lost my mind  
Sitting on a park bench  
years away from fighting  
to cut a long story short  
I lost my mind  
Standing in the dark  
oh I was waiting for man to come  
I am beautiful and clean  
and so very very young  
to be standing in the street  
to be taken by someone  
Questions questions  
give me no answers  
thats all they ever give me  
questions questions  
oh look at the strange boy  
he finds it hard existing  
to cut a long story short  
I lost my mind
