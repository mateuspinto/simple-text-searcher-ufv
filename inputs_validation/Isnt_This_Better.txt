Fanny  
I loved the man  
Truly i did  
When he would touch me i act like a lovehungry kid  
Isnt this better  
Somebody nice somebody new  
Someone who lets me react as i normally do  
Isnt this better  
Better  
Passion is fine but passion burns fast  
Passions design seems never to last  
Better a match better a blend  
Who needs a lover i need a friend  
Now i am calm save and serene  
Heartache and hurt are no longer a part of the scene  
Isnt this better  
The way it should be  
Better for him  
And also much better for me  
Isnt this better  
Better  
Passion is fine but passion burns fast  
Passions design seems never to last  
Better a match better a blend  
Who needs a lover i need a friend  
Now i am clam save and serene  
Heartache and hurt are no longer a part of the scene  
Isnt this better  
The way it should be  
Better for him  
Much better for him  
And also much better for me
