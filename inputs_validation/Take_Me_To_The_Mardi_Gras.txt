Cmon take me to the Mardi Gras  
Where the people sing and play  
Where the dancing is elite  
And theres music in the street  
Both night and day  
  
Hurry take me to the Mardi Gras  
In the city of my dreams  
You can legalize your lows  
You can wear your summer clothes  
In the New Orleans  
  
And I will lay my burden down  
Rest my head upon that shore  
And when I wear that starry crown  
I wont be wanting anymore  
  
Take your burdens to the Mardi Gras  
Let the music wash your soul  
You can mingle in the street  
You can jingle to the beat  
Of Jelly Roll
