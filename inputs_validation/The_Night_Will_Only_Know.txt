That night will live forever  
Their first time to lie together  
They were finally where desire dared them to go  
Both belonging to another  
But longing to be lovers  
Promising each other that the night will only know  
Parked on some old backstreet  
They laid down in the back seat  
And fell into the fire down below  
But they would pay for their deceiving  
For a deadly web was weaving  
Why they picked that spot that evening  
Lord the night will only know  
Well within the innuendos  
Just outside the steamy windows  
The night was shattered by a womans scream  
Motionless and frightened  
The grip of fate had tightened  
And with trembling hands they wiped away the steam  
They saw a woman pleading  
Stumbling begging and retreating  
Til she became the victim of her foe  
And they watched her fall in silence  
To save their own alliance  
But the reason for the violence  
Just the night will only know  
And every paper ran the story  
She was stripped of all her glory  
And the told exactly how the woman died  
Abandoned and forsaken  
Too many pills were taken  
And they ruled the womans death a suicide  
Bound by their behavior  
They could have been her savior  
Now guilt becomes the endless debt they owe  
But another crime was committed  
And its never been admitted  
Have the guilty been acquitted  
Lord the night will only know
