Once I lived a life of wine and roses  
And I drank a lot back then for one concern  
Success for me lay just around the corner  
I thought my social friends would help me make the turn  
But now Im paying for the days of wine and roses  
A victim of the drunken life I chose  
Now all my social friends look down their noses  
Cause I kept the wine and I threw away the rose  
 steel   
I stood by and watched the bottle take control of me  
The turn I made was not the one Id planned  
And I watched my social standings slip away from me  
While I watched the bottle slowly take command  
And now Im paying for  
Cause I kept the wine and I threw away the rose
