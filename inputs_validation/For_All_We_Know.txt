For all we know  
We may never meet again  
Before you go  
Make this moment sweet again  
  
We wont say goodnight  
Until the last minute  
Ill hold out my hand  
And my heart will be in it  
  
For all we know  
This may only be a dream  
We come and go  
Like a ripple on a stream  
  
So love me tonight  
Tomorrow was made for some  
Tomorrow may never come  
For all we know  
Tomorrow may never come  
For all we know
