Great Britain You Are Tremendous  
And Nobody Knows Like Me  
But Really What Are You Doin  
In The Land Across The Sea  
  
Tell Me How Would You Like It  
If On Your Way To Work  
You Were Stopped By Irish soldiers  
Would You Lie Down Do Nothing  
Would you give in or go berserk

Great Britain And All The People  
Say That All People Must Be Free  
Meanwhile Back In Ireland  
Theres A Man Who Looks Like Me  
  
And He Dreams Of God And Country  
And Hes Feeling Really Bad  
And Hes Sitting In A Prison  
Should He Lie Down Do Nothing  
Should Give In Or Go Mad
