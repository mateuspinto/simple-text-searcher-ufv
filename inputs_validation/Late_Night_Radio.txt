Oh Mary Jane she step on the train  
Head for the city light  
Yearning inside to swim with the tide  
And taste it all night  
Bag on her shoulder breathing the cold  
There by the metal tracks  
She saw it all shine and swore in her mind  
Shed never go back  
  
She dont mind the late night Late night radio  
She dont mind the late night radio  
She dont mind the late night Late night radio  
  
Couldnt have dreamed the things that shed seen  
There on the avenue  
She stared right into a million eyes  
That looked her right through  
Telling red Joe the places shed go  
And wiping the table clean  
She got no idea the demon of fear  
Or what a broken heart means  
  
She dont mind the late night Late night radio  
She dont mind the late night radio  
She dont mind the late night Late night radio  
Na Na Na Na Na Not at all  
  
New York was dark  
Dirty and stark  
Burning with yellow wings  
Everyday come with fever and hum  
Who knows what it brings  
Walking a wall without thought  
To fall and hit the ground  
Oh sweet Mary Jane with eyes like rain  
Alive to the sound  
  
She dont mind the late night Late night radio  
She dont mind the late night radio  
She dont mind the late night Late night radio  
She dont mind the late night  
Late night radio  
She dont mind the late night radio  
She dont mind the late night  
Late night radio  
Not at all
