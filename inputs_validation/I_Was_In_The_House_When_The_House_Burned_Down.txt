Warren Zevon  
I had the shit till it all got smoked  
I kept the promise till the vow got broke  
I had to drink from the lovin cup  
I stood on the banks till the river rose up  
I saw the bride in her wedding gown  
I was in the house when the house burned down  
I may be old and I may be bent  
But I had the money till it all got spent  
I had the money till they made me pay  
Then I had the sense to be on my way  
I had to stay in the underground  
I was in the house when the house burned down  
I was in the house when the house burned down  
I met the man with the thorny crown  
I helped Him carry his cross through town  
I was in the house when the house burned down  
I was in the house when the house burned down  
I met the man with the thorny crown  
I helped Him carry his cross through town  
I was in the house when the house burned down  
I had the shit till it all got smoked  
I kept the promise till the vow got broke  
I had to drink from the lovin cup  
I stood on the banks till the river rose up  
I saw the bride in her wedding gown  
I was in the house when the house burned down
