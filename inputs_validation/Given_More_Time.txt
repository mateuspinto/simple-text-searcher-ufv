Its been a long day Tell me how youve been  
Sorry its so late But here we go again  
Were sitting here together  
Your hand in mine I could stay here forever  
Given more time  
  
Given more time to laugh and dance  
Give more time to have the chance  
To show you this where I want to be  
But that old clock up on the wall  
It dont even care at all  
Lord I wish I was given more time  
For you and me  
  
Honey how was your day  
Did you spend it on the run  
I know the kids are okay  
Thanks for getting things done  
In a few more hours The suns gonna shine  
I wish I had the power To be given more time
