Weve taken too much for granted  
And all the time it had grown  
From techno seeds we first planted  
Evolved a mind of its own  
  
Marching in the streets  
Dragging iron feet  
Laser beaming hearts  
Ripping men apart  
  
From off Ive seen my perfection  
Where we could do as we please  
In secrecy this infection  
Was spreading like a disease  
  
Hiding underground  
Knowing wed be found  
Fearing for our lives  
Reaped by robots scythes  
  
Metal gods  
Metal gods  
  
Solo glenn  
  
Metal gods  
Metal gods  
  
Machines are taking all over  
With mankind in their command  
In time theyd like to discover  
How they can make their demand  
  
Better be the slaves  
To their wicked ways  
But meeting with our death  
Engulfed in molten breath
