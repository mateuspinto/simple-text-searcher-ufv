O come little children O come one and all  
To Bethlehem haste to the manger so small  
Gods son for a gift has been sent you this night  
To be your redeemer your joy and delight  
  
Hes born in a stable for you and for me  
Draw near by the bright gleaming starlight to see  
In swaddling clothes lying so meek and so mild  
And purer than angels the heavenly Child  
  
See Mary and Joseph with love beaming eyes  
Are gazing upon the rude bed where He lies  
The shepherds are kneeling with hearts full of love  
While angels sing loud hallelujahs above  
  
Kneel down and adore Him with shepherds today  
Lift up little hands now and praise Him as they  
Rejoice that a Saviour from sin you can boast  
And join in the song of the heavenly host
