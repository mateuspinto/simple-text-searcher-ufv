Once she came into my room feathered hat an all  
Wearing a warm wool shawl wrapped around her shoulders  
Two eyes like lights milky marble whites looking up at me  
Looking for a way Moons in an endless day  
  
All I knew was with her then no couldnt see the time  
As we drank down the wine to the last Sweet Scarlet  
How was I to wonder why or even question this  
Underneath her her kiss I was so unguarded  
Every bottles empty now and all those dreams are gone  
Ah but the song carries on so holy  
  
She was so much younger then wild like the wind  
A gypsy with a grin from and old far away country  
but deep beneath her curls  
Beneath this misty pearl there was more to see  
  
She could move mountains in the dark as silent as a knife  
She cut loose a life that she never no never really wanted  
All those days are frozen now and all those scars are gone  
Ah but the song carries on so holy  
  
Come let us drink again before the second show  
I want you so to know theres no bridge between us  
All those gates have opened now and through the light has shone  
Ah but the song carries on so holy
