The cards are stacking up against us  
These days our luck is running low  
Its hard to explain but a little bit of rain  
Seems to follow us wherever we go  
  
Black cat sittin on a ladder  
Broken mirror on the wall  
Were not a bit superstitious  
No need to worry at all  
  
Chorus  
Cause when we cant roll a seven  
And our last lucky penny is gone  
This world can be tough  
But I know when our love is this strong  
We can make a little luck of our own luck of our own  
  
The storm is only temporary  
But you and I are here to stay  
Baby cant you see true love is all we need  
So just throw that rabbits foot away  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh we can make it baby  
  
Chorus  
  
We can make a little luck of our own  
Yeah yeah  
Oh we can make it baby  
Make a little luck of our own
