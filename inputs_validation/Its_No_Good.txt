Im going to take my time  
I have all the time in the world  
To make you mine  
It is written in the stars above  
The gods decree  
Youll be right here by my side  
Right next to me  
You can run but you cannot hide  
Dont say you want me  
Dont say you need me  
Dont say you love me  
Its understood  
Dont say youre happy  
Out there without me  
I know you cant be  
Cause its no good  
Ill be fine  
Ill be waiting patiently  
Till you see the signs  
And come running to my open arms  
When will you realize  
Do we have to wait till our worlds collide  
Open up your eyes  
You cant turn back the tide  
Dont say you want me  
Dont say you need me  
Dont say you love me  
Its understood  
Dont say youre happy  
Out there without me  
I know you cant be  
Cause its no good  
Im going to take my time  
I have all the time in the world  
To make you mine  
It is written in the stars above  
Dont say you want me  
Dont say you need me  
Dont say you love me  
Its understood  
Dont say youre happy  
Out there without me  
I know you cant be  
Cause its no good
