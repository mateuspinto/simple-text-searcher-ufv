Out of Sight  
Out of Mind  
Out of Time  
To Decide  
Do we run Should we hide  
For the rest of my life of my life X2  
  
Dear anne my number one fan  
I write with the life of the lamp on my night stand  
With a pen in my right hand and thats also my mic hand  
Codeine in the sprite can ink on my white pad  
Im thinking of life and wrong and right and  
Sometimes Im right and sometimes I might  
I cannot find the light still my rhymes are bright  
So I continue my plan and Im shore like white sand  
That there will be price paid before my flight landed  
But still I want to see more than my sight can
