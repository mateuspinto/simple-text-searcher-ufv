If I ever was then now im less than sure  
What I was waiting for  
If I could find the strenght to walk  
Me im drinking the sea  
She will send me to sleep  
Surely there must be an easy way  
And ill say it again will the nevers end  
Do I have to forgive to forget  
I wrote a letter only yesterday  
I can not recall what I wanted to say  
I saw a chance I let it pass me by  
This is the shallow age my friend  
I say never again will the nevers end  
This is not what I had meant to say  
So im drinking the sea trying to pick up the pieces  
And say it never again  
If I ever was then now im less than sure  
And this is the shallow age my friend
