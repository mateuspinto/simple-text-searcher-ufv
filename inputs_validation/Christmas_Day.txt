Mary and Joseph drove into town  
Searching for a place to stay  
The moon was up and his foot was down  
A miracle was on its way  
  
They tried the hotels the motels the bedandbreakfast  
Locals but no one seemed to have any room  
  
Better find a double room soon  
  
Chorus  
So where would Christmas be without  
Mary and Joseph  
Walk of the Wise  
Laurel and holly  
Cracker Surprise  
Lights on the pine tree  
And more aftershave  
Im not forgetting Jesus who was born on Christmas Day  
  
They found a place with the neon lights  
TV Pool and Vacancies  
The man at the desk didnt hear them right  
When the two of them booked for three  
  
They watched the TV  
And deeply she thought about the needing  
Of the heavens to deliver this way  
And it happened on Christmas Day  
Christmas Day  
Christmas Day  
  
Chorus  
  
Mary and Joseph were so surprised  
With admirers around the crib  
There was something in their sons eyes  
They identically took one in  
  
Like a Messiah and a Fire  
Like the tread around a tire  
That grip all roads  
Its to bond you there  
  
And it happened on Christmas Day  
Christmas day  
Christmas day  
  
Chorus  
  
Not forgetting Jesus
