Prop open the door I can actually see my breath tonight  
But that doesnt mean Im breathing  
Crack a smile just for the sake of it  
This could take a while  
A long while  
  
Silence is golden especially in this case  
  
Im not too sure that I want it to be this way  
Open mouth closed eyes  
No words are escaping  
  
Its all a blur  
Its too dark to see  
Aint it pretty the way it all streaks together at night  
  
I think its time to turn around  
I really want to go home tonight  
  
I feel like this is going nowhere  
Try to think of something quick  
And trust the direction of the driver  
  
No lights  
No signs  
Im at a loss for words  
  
Now conversation sparks  
What an easy way to break the ice
