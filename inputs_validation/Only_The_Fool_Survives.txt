What went wrong  
I was so sure that love had led me to your door  
Was it a dream nothing more  
  
Inside my head  
I keep hearing all the tender words we said  
Who were they for  
  
We are strong  
We can hold on to each other if we try  
And make it right for you and I  
Theres no goodbyes  
  
Only the fool survives  
Only the heart provides  
Sweet love and tenderness  
Save us tonight  
  
Life is change  
But I never want to leave this love behind  
Weve come too far to lose this time  
  
Where theres love  
There is nothing strong enough to come between  
What we believe  
And break us up where there is love  
  
Only the fool survives  
Only the heart provides  
Sweet love and tenderness  
Save us tonight  
  
Only the fool survives  
Even the hardest times  
Let all the love we share  
Keep us alive  
  
See your eyes in a million faces  
See your smiles in a thousand places  
And I never escape your memories  
  
Youd be there everywhere that I go  
Youre the only real thing I know  
And I never wanted to be free  
Stay here with me  
  
Only the fool survives  
Only the heart provides  
Sweet love and tenderness  
Save us tonight  
  
Only the fool survives  
Even the hardest times  
Let al the love we share  
Keep us alive
