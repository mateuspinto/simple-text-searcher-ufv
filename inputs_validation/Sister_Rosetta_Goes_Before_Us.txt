Strange things are happening everyday  
I hear the music up above my head  
Though the side of my heart has left me again  
I hear music up above  
  
Secrets are written in the sky  
Looks like Ive lost the love Ive never found  
Though the sound of hope has left me again  
I hear music up above  
  
Standing in my broken heart all night long  
Darkness held me like a friend when love was lost  
Looking for the land thats hidden in the cross  
The finders love  
I know I loved you too much  
Ill go alone to get through  
  
I hear Rosetta singing in the night  
Echos of lighting shine like stars after there gone  
And tonight shes my guide as a girl on the moon  
With the music up above
