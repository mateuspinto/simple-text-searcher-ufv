It seems to me Ive heard that song before  
Far off in some distant land  
Or it may have been upon some foreign shore  
Burning in my heart again  
  
Ive seen the sounds and I have felt the air  
Drumming in my dreams again  
Deja vu I dont know now or then  
Enemy or maybe friend  
  
Oh but for the love of freedom  
Oh but for the love of you  
I would never ever have seen this day  
So please forgive me if I weep no more  
For friends and lovers far away  
  
Theres been too many times to hear the names  
Of friends who have stayed away  
Maybe now and then you still recall the pain  
As though it was yesterday  
  
Oh but for the love of freedom  
Oh but for the love of you  
I would never ever have seen this day  
So please forgive me if I weep no more  
For friends and lovers far away  
For friends and lovers far away
