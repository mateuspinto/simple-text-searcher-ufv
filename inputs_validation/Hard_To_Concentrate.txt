Hustle bustle and so much muscle awww  
Cells about to separate  
And I find it hard to concentrate and  
  
Temporary this cash and carry  
Im stepping up to indicate  
The time has come to deviate and  
  
All I want is for you to be happy and  
Take this moment to make you my family and  
Finally you have found something perfect and  
Finally you have found  
  
Death defying this mess Im buying  
Its raining down with love and hate  
And I find it hard to motivate and  
  
Estuary is blessed but scary your  
Hearts about to palpitate  
And Im not about to hesitate and  
  
One to treasure the rest of your days here and  
Give you pleasure in so many ways dear and  
Finally you have found something perfect and  
Finally you have found Here we go  
  
Do you want me to show up for duty and  
Serve this woman and honor her beauty and  
Finally you have found something perfect and  
Finally you have found Yourself  
  
With me will you agree to take  
This man into your world  
And now we are as one  
  
My lone ranger the heat exchanger  
Is living in this figure eight  
And Ill do my best to recreate and  
  
Sweet precision and soft collision awww  
Hearts about to palpitate  
And I find it hard to separate and  
  
All I want is for you to be happy and  
Take this woman and make you my family and  
Finally you have found someone perfect and  
Finally you have found
