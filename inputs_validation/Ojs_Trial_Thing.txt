O J O J  
O J I think you did it  
But I wanna know for sure  
You expect people to believe that there are people actually playing golf at
ten o clock at night  
Ya wanna know what I think  
I think youre gonna get passed around like Madonna in an nba locker room  
O J You slime  
O J You gave the devil the ball you whore  
O J You love it  
O J O J  
Well weve all had enough O J Coverage in our lives  
Me you nobody cares any more  
And O J Youre just sitting there looking bored  
Spending two hundred thousand dollars an hour on legal fees  
Im not impressed  
I just want you off my T V  
Get off my T V  
O J Nobody uses a cellular phone 20 feet away from their house Come on  
O J How much did you pay Rosa  
And now youre going to hell and some loser named Kato has a career  
You make Ike Turner look like a pussy  
O J Get the hell off my T V  
Maybe youll get an endorsement from Slice  
O J You bastard  
Get off my T V
