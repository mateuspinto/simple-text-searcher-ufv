In the hulking halls of hatred where the Master makes his throne  
Within the assteroid belt where his body floats alone  
His mind begins to wander  
The worm begins to turn  
All life he must now squander  
The universe must burn  
He plans eternal war as the eternal way  
But there is a force  which he must now obey  
Time and the events within chronicles of hate and sin  
Everything it has a start but the end is always the best part  
Our quest  to find the broken bits  
Put them back and make them fit  
And once that we have read the end  
The tablet will blow up again x4  
And well kill everything x3  
Including ourselves  
Summoning the Master  
Call his form most vile  
Champing mass of questing flesh  
Protoplasmic pile  
Ancient hunger never filled  
Until the universe is killed  
The endless host of merging soul  
Sucked into the feeding hole  
Guts and giblets cascade down  
Rectal midgets flattened ground  
Please pay attention to the plot  
As I kick out this monsters snot  
Splitting skulls and raking ribs  
Trephinated drainage sieve  
Protruding mass of reeking bile  
Which forms infected booger pile  
Assemble now the tablet  
Hope that its not Braille  
Bring forth now the Master  
So we can end this tale  
And well kill everything x3  
Especially ourselves  
Transmogrify your plasmic swarm  
Evaporate before times storm  
And dedicate your life to porn  
And dedicate your life to porn  
You think that life has a reason  
You think your god has a soul  
I bare my bum to the heavens  
I think a head is a hole  
And well kill everything x3  
Including ourselves
