Soon the warm night breezes roll on in  
A steamy blanket for the shore  
This is streetlight time  
You said you were mine  
So the fool believes  
What the night conceives  
The light of love is in your eyes  
Is in your smile again  
Is in your life again  
Was a time when love grew cold for you  
Turned your back on memories  
I was there for you  
I will see you through  
Darkest hours fade  
The promises we made  
Were not the kind to fade away  
Well face another day  
Well face another day  
When that was yesterday  
Will the ocean rollers bring you home  
Or will they take you out to sea  
This is realtime  
And you are still mine  
The fool that loves his dreams  
Breaks the cruelest schemes  
The light of love is in your eyes  
Is in your smile again  
Is in your life again  
Back in your smile again  
Back in your life again
