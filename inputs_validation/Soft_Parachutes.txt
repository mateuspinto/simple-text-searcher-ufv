Soft parachutes  
Fourth of July  
Villages burning  
Returning  
The bodies all laid in a line  
Like soft parachutes  
  
Last year as a senior  
In Emerson High school  
I had me a girlfriend  
We used to get high  
Now I am flyin  
Down some Vietnam highway  
Dont ask me the reason  
God only knows why  
  
Soft parachutes  
Fourth of July  
Villages burning  
Returning  
The bodies all laid in a line  
Like soft parachutes
