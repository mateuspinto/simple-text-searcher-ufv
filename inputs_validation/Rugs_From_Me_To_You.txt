To pay or not to pay that is the question  
It refused to stay as it all turned grey  
Or William Shakespeares receding hair  
  
Please excuse the pun its hair today gone tomorrow  
So be thankful for what precious locks you have  
  
Toupee or not toupee that is the question  
And by the way I just gotta say  
Thank the Lord Im not going bald  
  
And if I may quip my curls and I  
Are just like heaven  
And rest assured therell be no parting there  
  
But should my head get bare like Frier Tuck  
Hard taste to swallow  
It makes me smile cause I know just what Id do  
  
Yeah if I had more wigs than I knew what to do with  
Id open a second hand store  
And if you ever went bald youd recall it  
Cause Id cleverly call it Rugs from me to you
