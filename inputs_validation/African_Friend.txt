Disembarking at Duvalier Airport  
Seeking transportation to town  
As the purple ink dried on his passport  
He could still feel the eyes look around  
  
Messieur ou est le casino  
He spoke to the cabbie and smiled  
The driver replied Vieux ou noveaux  
As he motioned the dark man inside  
  
Business in Aruba concluded  
He now had a little money to spend  
Thats how I came to meet my African friend  
  
We were rollin the bones several hours  
Conversing as most gamblers do  
We were calling on all of our powers  
Hoping to see the night through  
  
But not approving at all of our winning  
The pit boss he tugged at his sleeve  
Through the whole thing my new friend was grinning  
When he motioned its time we should leave  
  
With our night at the tables behind us  
We were ready just to do it again  
Thats when I came to know my African Friend  
  
But I woke up on the steps of a whorehouse  
Soldier told me I better leave  
As I stumbled to find me a taxi  
I saw a note pinned to my sleeve  
  
It was a pleasure and a hell of an evening  
Truly was our night to win  
But the authorities insist on my leaving  
Take care my American friend  
  
With my weekend at Haiti concluded  
I now had a little money to spend  
Thats when I came to meet my African friend  
Thats how I came to know another good friend
