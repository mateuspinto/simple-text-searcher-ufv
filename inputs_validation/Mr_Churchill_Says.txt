Well Mr Churchill says Mr Churchill says  
We gotta fight the bloody battle to the very end  
Mr Beaverbrook says we gotta save our tin  
And all the garden gates  
And empty cans are gonna make us win  
We shall defend our island  
On the land and on the sea  
We shall fight them on the beaches  
On the hills and in the fields  
We shall fight them in the streets  
Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed to so few  
Cause they have made our British Empire  
A better place for me and you  
And this was their finest hour  
Well Mr Montgomery says  
And Mr Mountbatten says  
We gotta fight the bloody battle to the very end  
As Vera Lynn would say  
Well meet again someday  
But all the sacrifices we must make before the end  
Did you hear that plane flying overhead  
Theres a house an fire and theres someone lying dead  
We gotta clean up the streets  
And get me back on my feet  
Because we want to be free  
Do your worst and well do our best  
Were gonna win the way that Mr Churchill says  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh Well Mr Churchill says  
We gotta hold up our chins  
We gotta show some courage and some discipline  
We gotta black up the windows and nail up the doors  
And keep right on till the end of the war
