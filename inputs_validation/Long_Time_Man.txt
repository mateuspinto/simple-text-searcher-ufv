Yeah they came to take me away  
Said Id be sitting here for the rest of my life  
But I dont really care  I shot my wife  
And brother I cant even remember the reason why  
  
  
Oh it makes a long time man feel bad  
Yeah it makes a long time man feel bad  
Well I aint had no love since I dont know when  
It sure makes a long time man feel bad  
  
  
We was down in Jacksonville  
A cold winter night  
My baby and I we began to fight  
I heated up and I grabbed my gun  
I get so cold on those nights down south  
  
  
She was laying in a pool right there on the kitchen floor  
She looked up at me and began to smile  
Her gasping words Baby I love you  
Then she closed those baby blue eyes  
  
  
chorus and variations  
  
  
Sometimes I hear you call my name in the dead of the night  
  
  
I aint had those arms around me  
I aint had those lips those lips around me  
  
  
It sure makes a long time man feel bad  
So bad
