He Is Great  
Words by Ray Boltz Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
I gave my heart to Jesus  
When I was just a child  
And though it seems like yesterday  
Its been quite a while  
I called upon the Savior  
I bowed my head and prayed  
Thats the best decision  
That I ever made  
Every Sunday morning  
In a church outside of town  
Family friends and neighbors  
All would gather round  
When you neared the corner  
You could hear the church bell ring  
And when you reached the front door  
You could hear the people sing  
Chorus  
He is great and greatly to be praised  
In a world thats changing  
He remains the same  
He is faithful  
He still saves  
Give your heart to Jesus  
And Hell wash your sins away  
I went home last summer  
And I tried to find my past  
But all I found were withered boards  
And panes of broken glass  
I thought about that chapel  
As I neared the edge of town  
I couldnt help but wonder  
If it was still around  
And do they sing  
Chorus  
I turned the corner  
And I looked on down the road  
Deep inside I thought it would be gone  
But there were people everywhere  
The parking lot was full  
You know the little church  
Was still going strong  
They had a revival going on
