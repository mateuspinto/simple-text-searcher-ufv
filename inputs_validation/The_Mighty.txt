Walking this high road are warriors from an olden time  
Curse on this land and the days far behind us  
Dragons weve slain rescued many maidens fair  
And no man ever dared break our stride  
Or the brotherhood that binds us  
  
Brothers are we marching on the roads of time  
From this broken land and the days that defined us  
All men are free justice is a sword we hold  
Trusting in the knights noble vow  
In the brotherhood that binds us  
  
When the broken are strong  
Freak the mighty Freak the mighty  
When the beaten are proud  
Freak the mighty Freak the mighty  
When the twisted can stand  
Freak the mighty Freak the mighty  
When the silenced can laugh  
Freak the mighty Freak the mighty  
When the hunted have turned  
Freak the mighty Freak the mighty  
When the tortured are sane  
Freak the mighty Freak the mighty  
When the blinded still stare  
Freak the mighty Freak the mighty  
When the poisoned remain  
Freak the mighty Freak the mighty  
When the voiceless can sing  
Freak the mighty Freak the mighty  
And the shackled can run  
Freak the mighty Freak the mighty  
And this downtrodden man holds his face to the sun  
Freak the mighty Freak the mighty  
Well be walking high above the world  
Freak the mighty Freak the mighty  
Our legend will say  
  
Freak the mighty  
Freak the mighty  
Freak the mighty  
Freak the mighty
