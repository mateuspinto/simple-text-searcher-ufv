No one ever lived a thousand years  
Not like things we do or say  
Some of those who really changed this world  
We would welcome back today  
They could really light the way  
  
So call up Otis  
Call up Marvin  
Call for Buddy Bring them on  
Call for Ludwig  
And for Johann  
We need Lennon We mean john  
  
Words live longer than a thousand years  
Listen hard to what they say  
Single voices that would change this world  
We would welcome back today  
They would really light the way  
  
So call up Jimi

If we live another thousand years  
Who could help along the way  
Some of those who came and changed this world  
We would welcome back today  
They would really light the way
