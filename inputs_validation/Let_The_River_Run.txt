Were coming to the edge  
running on the water  
coming through the fog  
your sons and daughters  
  
Let the river run  
let all the dreamers  
wake the nation  
Come the New Jerusalem  
  
Silver cities rise  
the morning lights  
the streets that meet them  
and sirens call them on  
with a song  
  
Its asking for the taking  
Trembling shaking  
Oh my heart is aching  
  
Were coming to the edge  
running on the water  
coming through the fog  
your sons and daughters  
  
We the great and small  
stand on a star  
and blaze a trail of desire  
through the darkning dawn  
  
Its asking for the taking  
Come run with me now  
the sky is the color of blue  
youve never even seen  
in the eyes of your lover  
  
Oh my heart is aching  
Were coming to the edge  
running on the water  
coming through the fog  
your sons and daughters  
  
guitar  
  
Its asking for the taking  
Trembling shaking  
Oh my heart is aching  
Were coming to the edge  
running on the water  
coming through the fog  
your sons and daughters  
  
Let the river run  
let all the dreamers  
wake the nation  
Come the New Jerusalem
