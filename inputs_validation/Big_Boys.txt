I am starting to function  
In the usual way  
Everything is so provocative  
Very very temporary  
  
I shall walk I shall walk  
Out of this place out of this place  
I shall walk  
Out on you  
Cause you go silly  
If shes willing  
Trying so hard to be like the big boys  
  
So you take her to the pictures  
Trying to become a fixture  
Inch by inch trying to reach her  
All the way through the second feature  
Worrying about your physical fitness  
Tell me how you got this sickness oh ohhhh  
  
I was caught in the suction  
By a face like a truncheon  
I was down upon one knee  
Stroking her vanity  
  
I was stuck on a hammerhead  
I came alive and left for dead  
As my face returned to red  
Choking on my pride and pity  
  
We can talk we can talk  
Until your face is blue til your face is blue  
We can talk but shell get to you  
After youve been loved and hated  
By the ones youve watched and waited  
Found that they were overrated  
  
Shell be the one  when the partys over  
Shell be the one  when the girls have gone home  
Shell be the one  that youll wish youd held onto  
Shell be the one  but its too late for you to  
Shell be the one  who knows all your history  
Shell be the one   
  
So you can cross her off your list  
And you try so hard  
And you try so hard  
And you try so hard  
To be like the big boys oh
