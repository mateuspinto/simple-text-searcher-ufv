Uh star struck hoes beg me to connect with em  
Cause I look correct with em and knows how to sex them  
Houses on two acre lakes in the Peach State  
Eat steak and lobster steady tryin to prosper  
  
Build up my roster like the ol Motown  
Too much to hold down and the whole world know now  
I demonstrate stackin paint platinum tapes  
And bustin that ass with groups like XSCAPE  
What the deal Uhh  
  
I want to see if you can get down  
Get down like you say you do  
In the midnight when I want to feel right  
All I think about is you  
  
Put me in a fly position  
Make me want to scream your name  
And just when you think Ive had enough  
Im like baby do you think we can do it again  
  
Chorus x2  
Cause everytime you show me that  
And every which way that you throw my back  
I just cant get enough  
I find myself sayin lets do it again lets do it again  
  
Tingle tingle my body  
You make me oohh baby  
I aint been the same since then  
That night when you put me in a fly position  
  
You made me scream your name  
You can say Im sprung out I dont give a damn  
I want to do it again and again and again  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge  
When we made love for the first time  
It felt so good inside  
I laid across my bed and watched tears run from my eyes  
Too good to let it go  
So dont disturb this flow  
All I know is I cant wait  
Cant wait to do it again  
  
Chorus  
  
In the morning cause everytime you show me that  
Sweet love in the summertime and every which way that you throw my back  
Just your sweet face I just cant get enough  
  
all laid up next to mine I find myself sayin Lets do it again lets do it
again  
Cause everytime you show me that Lets do it again  
And every which way that you throw my back again again  
I just cant get enough  
  
I find myself sayin lets do it again lets do it again  
Lets do it do it do it do it do it again
