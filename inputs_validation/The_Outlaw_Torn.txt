And now I wait my whole lifetime for you  
And now I wait my whole lifetime for you  
I ride the dirt I ride the tide for you  
I search the outside search inside for you  
To take back what you left me  
I know Ill always burn to be  
The one who seeks so I may find  
And now I wait my whole lifetime  
Outlaw of torn and Im torn  
So on I wait my whole lifetime for you  
So on I wait my whole lifetime for you  
The more I search the more my need for you  
The more I bless the more I bleed for you  
You make me smash the clock and feel  
Id rather die behind the wheel  
Time was never on my side  
So on I wait my whole lifetime  
Outlaw of torn and Im torn  
  
Hear me  
And if close my mind in fear  
Please pry it open  
See me  
And if my face becomes sincere  
Beware  
Hold me  
If when I start to come undone  
Stitch me together  
Save me  
And when you see me strut  
Remind me of what left this outlaw torn
