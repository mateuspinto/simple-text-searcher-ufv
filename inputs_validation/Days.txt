Sad eyes sad eyes across the room  
Sad eyes crying in your gloom  
Sad eyes love has been untrue  
  
Just look at me oh just look at me  
Just look at me Im lonely too  
Im like you so like you sad eyes  
  
Oh sad eyes  
Dont you know that tears can be erased  
Oh sad eyes Tears wont help  
But maybe I can replace that other face  
  
Sad eyes sad eyes this aint just a line  
Sad eyes maybe we can find  
Sad eyes somewhere down the line  
  
Happiness oh happiness Happiness together you and I  
Someday some way sad eyes
