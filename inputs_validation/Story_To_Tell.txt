Drifting into the lives  
Seep into the soul where emotions hide  
Dark skies were beating me down  
With shadows of deceit slashing at  
Trust till it forever bleeds  
With doubt with pain with trust  
Is pain  
  
When you think of me in your  
Multidimesional mind try and wash the  
Evil from your mind and open it  
  
When you taste the truth you will  
See like others before me to you  
I am past a story to tell  
Tell it  
  
You may think you own the end  
Take another close look at the script  
  
Of sadness etched in the book
