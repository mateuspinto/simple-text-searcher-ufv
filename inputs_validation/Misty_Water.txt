By the town of Straight and Narrow  
Theres a dark and misty place  
Everything is hazy  
So the people are afraid  
All except Marias daughters  
Who believe in misty ways  
Everything is lovely  
In a misty morning glaze  
I like misty water  
I like fog and haze  
Anne Maria and her daughters  
They like misty water  
I like misty water  
I like fog and haze  
Anne Maria and her daughters  
Take a sip of misty water  
Though Maria is not lovely  
Shes the lady of my dreams  
Cause I see my lady  
Through a misty silky screen  
And in seeing is believing  
But I cant believe my eyes  
Everything is lovely  
In a misty paradise  
I like misty water  
I like fog and haze  
Anne Maria and her daughters  
They like misty water  
They like misty water  
I like fog and haze  
Anne Maria and her daughters  
Take a sip of misty water  
I like misty water  
I like fog and haze  
Anne Maria and her daughters  
They like misty water  
They like misty water  
I like fog and haze  
Anne Maria and her daughters  
They like misty water  
I like misty water  
I like fog and haze  
Anne Maria and her daughters
