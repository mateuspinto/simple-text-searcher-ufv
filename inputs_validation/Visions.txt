Accepting new ideas is hard  
Holding on to the past  
Its too easy cant you see  
Weve got to move on  
  
Our world is constantly speeding  
The stars are still intriguing  
The tears in our eyes  
Feed happiness for the next miles

Give us hope  
The end is always the start of a  
New episode

Evoke artificial lightning  
Watch out cause it can strike you  
The remedy is inside you  
  
These visions make us desperate  
Give us hope  
The end is always the start of a  
New episode feel free to interact with the plot  
The choice can really mean a lot  
Just try to translate this secret code
