The grey of evening  
Fills the room  
No need to look outside  
To see or feel the rain  
I reach across to touch her  
But I know that shes not there  
Rain keeps running down the window pane  
Time keeps running out for me  
  
Cant you see what you are doing to me  
Cant you see what you have done  
As I try to pass another long and sleepless night  
As a hundred crazy voices call my name  
As I try to pass them by  
I almost can believe that she is here  
Here in the glow of the night  
  
Do you know what you have done  
Do you know what youve begun  
Do you see we shall never be together again  
All of my life  
  
All the lonely people empty rooms  
And all the pointless violence silent tombs  
Could it be that we shall be together again  
  
Sheets of double glazing  
Help to keep outside the night  
Only foreign city sirens can cut through  
Nylon sheets and blankets  
Help to minimize the cold  
But they cant keep out the chilling sounds  
Will the nightmare soon give way to dreaming  
That she is here with me  
Here in the glow of the night  
  
Do you know what you have done  
Do you know what youve begun  
Do you see we shall never be together again  
All of my life  
  
All the lonely people empty rooms  
And all the pointless violence silent tombs  
Could it be that we shall be together again
