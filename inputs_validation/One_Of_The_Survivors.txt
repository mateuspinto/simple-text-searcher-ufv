See Johnny Thunder sitting on his motorbike  
Riding along the highway  
Rock and roll songs from the nineteenfifties  
Buzzing around in his brain  
Johnny Thunder hes one of the original bebop generation  
And hes got no time for complicated music  
Or too much sophistication  
  
Hes one of the survivors  
The motorbike riders  
You ought to see Johnny Thunder  
Riding down the highway  
One of the rock and roll survivors  
Twelve bars flowing through his brain  
He digs Jerry Lee Lewis Dion and The Belmonts  
And Johnny and The Hurricanes  
  
He plays Hound Dog Oh Boy  
And Great Balls of Fire  
And Boppin At The High School Hop  
And hes got no time for phonies or posers  
Cause they dont know how to reel and rock  
And he plays Little Egypt and Ooh Poo Pah Doo  
And he plays Poison Ivy and Blue Suede Shoes  
The Hollywood Argyles Danny and The Juniors  
Dion and The Belmonts Johnny and The Hurricanes  
  
Hes one of the survivors  
The boppers and the jivers  
Yeah and he rocks all day  
Johnny and The Hurricanes Johnny and The Hurricanes  
  
Got my freedom riding along the freeway  
I ride a hundred miles an hour  
But I dont mess up my DA  
Rock rock rock rock rock n roll  
You cant stop rock n rollin music play  
Rock rock rock rock rock n roll  
You cant stop rock n rollin music play  
  
Feel those vibrations flow in my brain  
Got my freedom riding down the highway  
Keeps me sane feel alive  
Im one of the survivors  
  
Feel all right  
First gear second gear  
Third gear fourth gear all right  
Old Johnny Thunder looks a little overweight  
And his sideburns are turning grey  
But he still likes to bebop boogie and jive  
To his worn out seventyeights  
Johnny Thunder  
Hes alright  
Hes one of the survivors  
Twelve bars flowing through his brain  
Jerry Lee Lewis Dion and The Belmonts  
Johnny and The Hurricanes  
Johnny and The Hurricanes
