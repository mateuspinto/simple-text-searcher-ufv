I want to know how it feels to be  
Alone as it appears to me  
As the start of the day is the end of the night  
So the end of the night is the start of the day  
  
I know that its true because everybody knew  
Before me so where can I go now  
  
If the start of the day is the end of the night  
The end of the night is the start of the day  
And once it has gone it will never come back again  
  
Well we know where we are  
And we know that weve come so far  
And well never come back again  
  
Now I know that its true cause everybody knew  
Before me so where can I go now  
  
You take me back to the start  
Back to the start  
Where I was falling apart  
Falling apart  
Now all the things you want to be  
You never want to be with me  
  
If the start of the day is the end of the night  
The end of the night is the start of the day  
And once it has gone it will never come back again  
  
Well we know where we are  
And we know that weve come so far  
And well never come back again  
  
You said you knew everything  
You said you knew everything  
About love and peace and hate and lies  
About love and peace and hate and lies  
  
Well if the start of the day is the end of the night  
The end of the night is the start of the day  
And once it has gone it will never come back again  
  
Well we know where we are  
And we know that weve come so far  
And well never come back again  
Well never come back again  
  
If the start of the day is the end of the night  
The end of the night is the start of the day  
Well never come back again  
And once it has gone it will never come back again  
  
Well never come back again  
If the start of the day is the end of the night  
The end of the night is the start of the day  
Once it has gone it will never come back again  
Once it has gone it will never come back again  
Once it has gone it will never come back again
