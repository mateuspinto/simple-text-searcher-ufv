Sometimes I am pitted and bare  
Like a small bookstore after a fire  
I know Ill find no harbor there  
The stormy waves keep getting higher  
  
Sometimes I am washed of color  
Like a drawing on the sidewalk after rain  
And I know the time is right now  
To give birth to words again  
  
Big Mushroom over the city  
Police are running tests  
Little Mushroom  
She was found  
Squeezed in with all the rest  
  
Sometimes there is no road  
Like the Day of Atonement in a car  
And everything looks different with  
A broken heart  
  
Big Mushroom over the city  
Police are running tests  
Little Mushroom  
She was found  
Squeezed in with all the rest  
  
Sometimes I am numb of anger  
Like the Square where memory will wane  
And I try to find comfort in written words  
For this burning pain  
  
Big Mushroom over the city  
Police are running tests  
Little Mushroom  
She was found  
Squeezed in with all the rest  
  
Big Mushroom over the city  
Whos to tell the futures course  
Little Mushroom  
She was found  
Far away from the forest
