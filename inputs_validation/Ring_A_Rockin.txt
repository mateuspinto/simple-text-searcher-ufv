Come on and meet me bout a half past four  
At the corner candy store  
School is over and homework done  
Nows the time to have some fun  
Gonna fly right off the ground  
To that ringin rockin sound  
Jukebox music spinnin around  
Ring a ring a rockin music  
Sing a ring a rockin song  
Bring a ring a ring your sweetheart  
String a ring a ring along  
Ring a ring a rockin music  
Bring a ring a ring your smile  
Swing a ring a ring your baby  
And ting a ling a ling go wild  
Were gonna rock it til were out of breath  
Watch us swing a rock it beat the floor to death  
Spread the dust around the room  
Keep yourself a shakin like a nervous broom  
Come on cat lets strut our stuff  
Boy that music is really tough  
I just cannot get enough  
Ring a ring a rockin music  
Sing a ring a rockin song  
Bring a ring a ring your sweetheart  
String a ring a ring along  
Ring a ring a rockin music  
Bring a ring a ring your smile  
Swing a ring a ring your baby  
And ting a ling a ling go wild  
Throw a little silver in the coin machine  
That ringo rockin music is really keen  
You light the fuse and you start to fly  
Like a firecracker on the 4th of July  
Like a rollercoaster ride  
First you slip and then you slide  
Watch me go a rock a bye  
Ring a ring a rockin music  
Sing a ring a rockin song  
Bring a ring a ring your sweetheart  
String a ring a ring along  
Ring a ring a rockin music  
Bring a ring a ring your smile  
Swing a ring a ring your baby  
And ling a ling a ling go wild  
Swing a ring a ring your baby  
And ring a ring a rock a while
