Hold me in your arms  
Like a new born child  
Im desperate lord  
For more of you  
  
Touch me with your love  
Deep within my heart  
Im waiting lord  
For more of you  
  
May your words of love  
Wash over me  
May your songs of grace  
Cover me  
  
More than the air I breathe today  
I need you  
More than the desert needs the rain  
I need you  
More than the air breathe today  
I need you  
More than to live another day  
I need you
