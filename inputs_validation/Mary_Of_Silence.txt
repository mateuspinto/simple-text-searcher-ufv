Oh Mary of Silence  
You pick my heart with a smile  
Oh sweet Mary  
Come inside for a while  
Help me get a hold on you  
Or I look in the night  
I thought of myself beside you  
Take me into your skin  
  
Oh Sweet Mary of Silence  
Oh Sleeping Mary of Silence  
  
We have a steady confusion  
Youre looking at fear  
It doesnt seem like the first time  
You walked out in a hurry  
  
Oh Sweet Mary of Silence  
Oh Sleeping Mary of Silence  
  
I look in  In your window  
To check my head in your pane  
My last thoughts  they come to me  
I cant take the pain  
  
Oh Sweet Mary of Silence  
Oh Sleeping Mary of Silence  
  
Help me walk with you To the sky that we see  
Shuddering in myself inmyself  
Oh where  
Oh when  
Oh well  
Sweet Mary of Silence  
Sweet Mary of Silence  
Sweet Mary of Silence  
Sweet Mary of Silence
