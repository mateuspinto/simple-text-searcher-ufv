Who knows where the road may lead us only a fool would say  
Who knows if well meet along the way  
Follow the brightest star as far as the brave may dare  
What will we find when we get there  
  
La Sagrada Familia we pray the storm will soon be over  
La Sagrada Familia for the lion and the lamb  
  
Who knows where the winds will blow us only a fool would say  
Who knows if well ever reach the shore  
Follow a rising sun with eyes that may only stare  
What kind of fire will burn us there What kind of fire  
Only a fool would say  
  
La Sagrada Falilia the wind has changed the storm is over  
La Sagrada Familia for the lion and the lamb  
La Sagrada Familia we thank the lord the dangers over  
La Sagrada Familia theres peace throughout the land  
  
Under clear blue skies our voices rise in songs of glory  
And for all those years our eyes and ears were filled with tears  
  
Who knows where the world may turn us only a fool would say  
Who knows what the fates may have in store  
Follow the light of truth as far as our eyes can see  
How should we know where that may be How should we know  
  
Then the angry skies the battle cries the sounds of glory  
And for all those years our eyes and ears were filled with tears  
  
Who knows where the road may lead us only a fool would say  
Who knows whats been lost along the way  
Look for the promised land in all of the dreams we share  
How will we know when we are there How will we know  
Only a fool would say  
  
La Sagrada Falilia the war is won the battles over  
La Sagrada Familia for the lion and the lamb  
La Sagrada Familia we thank the lord the dangers over  
La Sagrada Familia behold the mighty hand  
La Sagrada Familia the night is gone the waitings over  
La Sagrada Familia theres peace throughout the land  
  
Until the next time  
Until the next time  
  
La Sagrada Familia
