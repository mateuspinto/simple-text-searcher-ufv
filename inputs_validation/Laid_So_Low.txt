Chewed the bone down too low  
Got fed on tea and sympathy  
Blew the sail like the wind  
I wish you were my enemy  
I was humble for you  
What a fool Ive been to have  
Laid so low for so long  
  
Into that void of silence  
Where we cry without sound  
Where tears roll down  
Where tears roll down  
And where your mothers violence  
Sent your soul underground  
Where tears roll down  
Where tears roll down  
  
Drew the blade way too slow  
Was shackled by your honesty  
Made a mess I guess I have should have known  
That life was lust and liberty  
Not a chance mutation or the last temptation  
Laid so low for so long so low  
  
Into that void of silence  
Where we cry without sound  
Where tears roll down  
Where tears roll down  
And where your mothers violence  
Sent your soul underground  
Where tears roll down  
Where tears roll down
