Help I have done it again  
I have been here many times before  
Hurt myself again today  
And the worst part is theres no one else to blame  
  
Chorus  
Be my friend hold me  
Wrap me up unfold me  
I am small and needy  
Warm me up and breathe me  
  
Ouch I have lost myself again  
Lost myself and I am nowhere to be found  
Yeah I think that I might break  
Lost myself again and I feel unsafe  
  
Chorus x2
