Rebel grip your bottle tight  
Just float away  
Rebel is it hard to leave  
What makes you stay  
  
Go take your poison ink  
Sign life away  
Then take your dirty spoon  
And dig your grave  
Dig your grave  
  
Rebel grips the bottle tight  
Just floats away  
Rebel finds it hard to leave  
What makes you stay  
  
He takes the poison ink  
Signing life away  
Then takes the dirty spoon  
And digs his grave  
  
Let this dark shine  
Let this dark shine  
Let it shine bright  
Dont let it burn out tonight  
  
Kill me one more time  
Stigmata  
Kill me one more time  
Neo martyr  
  
Gonna die young  
Gonna live forever  
Kill me one more time  
Rise up  
Rebel of babylon  
  
Renegade fights the fight  
That no one wins  
He claims a crown of thorns  
To pierce the skin  
  
He climbs his crucifix  
And waits for dawn  
Thinks theyll remember him  
After hes gone  
  
Let this dark shine  
Let this dark shine  
Let it shine bright  
Dont let it burn out tonight  
  
Kill me one more time  
Stigmata  
Kill me one more time  
Neo martyr  
  
Gonna die young  
Gonna live forever  
Kill me one more time  
Rise up  
Rebel of babylon  
  
Rise up  
Rise up  
Resurrection  
  
The rebel fights the fight  
That no one wins  
To claim a crown of thorns  
To pierce his skin  
  
Climbs his crucifix  
And waits for dawn  
He looses consciousness  
The myth lives on  
  
Let this dark shine  
Let this dark shine  
Let it shine bright  
Dont let it burn out tonight  
Tonight  
  
Kill me one more time  
Stigmata  
Kill me one more time  
Neo martyr  
  
Gonna die young  
Gonna live forever  
Kill me one more time  
Rise up  
Rebel of babylon  
  
Rise up  
Rise up  
Resurrection
