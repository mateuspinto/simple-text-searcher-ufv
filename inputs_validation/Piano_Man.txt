Its nine oclock on a Saturday  
The regular crowd shuffles in  
Theres an old man sitting next to me  
Makin love to his tonic and gin  
  
He says Son can you play me a memory  
Im not really sure how it goes  
But its sad and its sweet and I knew it complete  
When I wore a younger mans clothes  
  
La la la di da da  
La la di da da da dum  
  
Sing us a song youre the piano man  
Sing us a song tonight  
Well were all in the mood for a melody  
And youve got us feelin alright  
  
Now John at the bar is a friend of mine  
He gets me my drinks for free  
And hes quick with a joke or to light up your smoke  
But theres someplace that hed rather be  
He says Bill I believe this is killing me  
As the smile ran away from his face  
Well Im sure that I could be a movie star  
If I could get out of this place  
  
Oh la la la di da da  
La la di da da da dum  
  
Now Paul is a real estate novelist  
Who never had time for a wife  
And hes talkin with Davy whos still in the Navy  
And probably will be for life  
  
And the waitress is practicing politics  
As the businessmen slowly get stoned  
Yes theyre sharing a drink they call loneliness  
But its better than drinkin alone  
  
Sing us a song youre the piano man  
Sing us a song tonight  
Well were all in the mood for a melody  
And you got us feeling alright  
  
Its a pretty good crowd for a Saturday  
And the manager gives me a smile  
Cause he knows that its me theyve been comin to see  
To forget about life for a while  
And the piano it sounds like a carnival  
And the microphone smells like a beer  
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar  
And say Man what are you doin here  
  
Oh la la la di da da  
La la di da da da dum  
  
Sing us a song youre the piano man  
Sing us a song tonight  
Well were all in the mood for a melody  
And you got us feeling alright
