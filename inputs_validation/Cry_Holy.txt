Wondrous mystery in the pages of history  
Of a man who bled and died for me  
Its more than a story He s the one who hung up on a tree  
His crimson flow poured out for me  
Gave His life to set my free  
  
Chorus  
I fall down I fall down  
And I fall down on my knees  
And cry holy is the Lord  
Worship him worship him and adore  
  
Wondrous mystery in the pages of history  
Of a man who bled and died for me  
Its more than a story he s the one who hung up on a tree  
His crimson flow poured out for me  
Gave his life to set me free  
  
Repeat chorus  
I cry holy I cry holy is the Lord X5
