As a boy I had a gig with a travelin show  
Way back in 63  
We did a little pickin for the soldier boys  
Of General Bobby Lee  
  
But when we got to Pennsylvania  
I knew thered be a change  
We caught up with some boys from Georgia  
And I heard one of them say  
  
Dont tell the band  
The devils on his way  
Dont tell the band  
Just let the music play  
  
Later on I had a job pouring gin and rum  
On the grand queen of the sea  
We set out on our first transatlantic voyage  
Headed for New York City  
  
But when I felt that lady shudder  
I knew thered be a change  
I saw the captain grab the first mate  
And I thought I heard him say  
  
Dont tell the band  
The devils on his way  
Dont tell the band  
Just let the music play  
Just let the music play  
  
In the Restaurant at the End of the Universe  
In the year 3010  
I was listenin to the Good Old Interstellar Boys  
Playin Let It Be again  
  
But when I heard the trumpet sounding  
I knew thered be a change  
A prophet wearin robes appeared before us  
And he looked at me and said  
  
Dont tell the band  
The devils on his way  
Dont tell the band  
Just let the music play  
  
Dont tell the band  
The devils on his way  
Dont tell the band  
Just let the music play  
Just let the music play  
Just let the music play
