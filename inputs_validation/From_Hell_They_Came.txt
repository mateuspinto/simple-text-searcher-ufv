In the night  
I hear voices calling  
They seem to speak my name  
  
Glowing bright  
I see the eyes of demons  
Reaching up beyond the grave  
  
And I think from Hell they came  
Oh I think from Hell they came  
I think from Hell they came  
Oh I think from Hell they came  
  
Dark the night  
Their cries so lonely  
Feel their need inside  
  
I cant fight  
This eternal longing  
Feast on flesh these ghouls tonight  
  
And I think from Hell they came  
Oh I think from Hell they came  
I think from Hell they came  
Oh I think from Hell they came  
  
Oh  
Whoaoh  
Whoaoh  
Oh  
  
In the night  
I hear voices calling  
They seem to speak my name  
  
Glowing bright  
I see the eyes of demons  
Reaching up beyond the grave  
  
And I think from Hell they came  
Oh I think from Hell they came  
I think from Hell they came  
Oh I think from Hell they came
