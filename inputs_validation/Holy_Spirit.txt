Theres nothing worth more that will ever come close  
No thing can compare Youre our living hope  
Your presence Lord  
  
Ive tasted and seen of the sweetest of loves  
Where my heart becomes free and my shame is undone  
Your presence Lord  
  
Holy Spirit You are welcome here  
Come flood this place and fill the atmosphere  
Your glory God is what our hearts long for  
To be overcome by Your presence Lord  
  
Ive tasted and seen of the sweetest of loves  
Where my heart becomes free and my shame is undone  
By Your presence Lord  
  
Let us become more aware of Your presence  
Let us experience the glory of Your goodness
