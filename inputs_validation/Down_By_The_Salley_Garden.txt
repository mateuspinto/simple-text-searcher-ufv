Down by the Salley Gardens  
My love and I did meet  
She passed the Salley Gardens  
With little snow white feet  
  
She bid me take life easy  
As the leaves grow on the trees  
But I being young and foolish  
With her did not agree  
  
In a field by the river  
My love and I did stand  
And on my healing shoulder  
She laid her snow white hand  
  
She bid me take love easy  
As the grass grows on the weeds  
But I was young and foolish  
And now Im full of tears  
  
Down by the Salley Gardens  
My love and I did meet  
She passed the Salley Gardens  
With little snow white feet  
  
She bid me take love easy  
As the leaves grow on the trees  
But I was young and foolish  
And with her did not agree
