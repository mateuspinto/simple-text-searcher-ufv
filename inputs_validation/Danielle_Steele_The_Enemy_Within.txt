My Guy and Patches  
Can only hope to match  
The evil propaganda that her pen can dispatch  
And she better love him good  
Or shell take it on the chin  
A woman is a woman  
To the enemy within  
She can put up a fight  
The man will always win  
And Danielle Steele  
The enemy within  
  
And even photo love  
With its pages filled with sin  
Couldnt lick the boots of the enemy within  
It can only be a chapter  
till her heart will give in  
The enemy within  
Nothing is as phallic  
As a moaning violin  
To Danielle Steele  
The enemy within  
  
Itll all be worth it  
When the cushion takes the pin  
The enemy within  
Itll all be worth it  
When the cushion takes the pin  
When the cushion takes the pin  
When the cushion takes the pin
