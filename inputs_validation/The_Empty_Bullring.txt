Disappears through a window  
Out of my mind  
Trying to keep him at home  
Out into Rome  
In the early hours  
Leaving me here  
Like Tamlaine in her Tower  
You are going  
To the empty bullring  
Taking your red cloak  
To regain something  
  
Chorus  
Oh you rolling matador  
Kill in your eyes  
For the toro  
That shut the door  
To glory and gore  
The throw of the rose  
Its all you lived for  
But youve lost it all  
  
Your red streak  
On the plot where many feet  
Left it incomplete  
But you kept the meaning  
You feel him charge again  
And you feel him cut you down  
Right on the spot  
Where you thought  
You were ground for good  
These flights of fantasy  
Make your wounds more sore  
But youve every right  
To even grab at the last straw  
Oh Lord  
  
Chorus
