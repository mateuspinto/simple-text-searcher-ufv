Cube  
HaHaHa  
Thats right nigga  
Southwest connection straight up  
Servin more than peanuts bitch  
Niggas tryin to stay rich  
  
Mike  
How many wayscan a killa get paid  
  
Mike  
How many niggas want a gansta boogie  
I see the junkie in your eyes  
What do you see me when you see me  
A G in disguise  
Been hypmotized since 85 with gansta shit  
All you niggas get live and represent my click  
Got bits and pieces on my mind commin together like lettuce  
Dear God protect us cause were mobbin like Good Fellas  
Alias Carlion maybe the war is on  
Prone to let my daughter live rich before shes grown  
If I murdered Capone would you consider me a villain  
Chillin with millionares exkillers and settrippers  
My murderous complex begin to hit cha  
Slip ya worse than New Jersey Drive niggas  
Cause Im in a  
Rush to bust straps like mack10s  
When Im strapped in  
A 95 Impala  
Breakin like Vegas for my dolla  
While Im commin like a hundred miles and gunnin who gonna test  
The southwests connect when it aint shit you possess  
Yes we got the endo  
Splurgin in Benzo  
Turnin virgins to nymphos  
Look what cha in fo  
A G thats gonna let his khakis sag  
Mr Mike and Ice Cube franch braids and rags  
Byatch  
  
ChorusX2  
How many wicked wayz can a gansta get his pays  
When hes trapped in a maze  
Cube  
I represent the phrase that says crime pays  
Bitches can we fuck niggas can we blaze  
  
Cube  
I treat bitches like puppies  
I got a plate full of guppies  
Appropriate dish for the big fish  
Niggas rich  
They have my straps  
Women with gaps  
Now they want to sit in my laps and listen to raps  
But no  
Heard a nigga tight named Mr Mike  
Had to catch a flight its only right  
Stepped of the plane Mean Green and Tony Draper  
Killa was the caper  
Lets make some paper  
  
Mike  
See we cant get enough of this gansta shit  
Sick as leukemia for weed in my gansta click  
Lets take riches  
Witness two niggas dome in the killa zone  
Bring your killa chrome  
Cause we headed to the terror dome  
Some niggas never make it home  
As long as you got your front  
I got your back its on like that  
And like this  
Let the weed blow cause all you Gs know  
Who got the wickedess flow  
The criminiminals  
  
ChorusX2  
Cube  
Say What  
Niggas want to short my cuts  
Say what  
Niggas want to check my nuts  
How you sound  
Ganstas make the world go round  
Guppies bow down  
Im with some killas from Htown  
Chase his ass down to Atlanta GA  
Find out where he stay  
Locate my gate  
Catch him in the hall  
Make his ass call  
And then I want yall to kill cousins and all HaHaHa  
They wont believe all the heat I bring  
From Palm Springs  
Niggas in line to catch the ring  
Of the dyin  
Keepin it calm so talk slow  
Cause youll never know  
When Im ready to blow  
Im a pro of the lifestyle of the Bloods and Crips  
Make a lot of cookies filled with chocolate chips  
The Westsides always been down with the South  
With Suave mother fuckin House
