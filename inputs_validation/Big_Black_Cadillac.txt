My baby came back in a big black  
My baby came back in a big black  
My baby came back in a big black Cadillac  
  
She looked better than gold like she was dear  
You know she changed her name got one small kid  
My baby came back in a Big Black Black Cadillac  
  
Black Cadillac It seems he lost the knack to blow my mind attack when I came
back  
Black Cadillac Im sure he miss my touch I never really missed him much  
  
Shes digging for gold its what she doing  
I got to be older than a ruin  
My baby came back in a big black Cadillac Cadillac  
  
Black Cadillac it seems he lost the knack to blow my mind attack when I came
back  
Black Cadillac Im sure he miss my touch I never really missed him much  
Black Cadillac oh oh yeah he lost the knack to blow my mind attack when I
came back  
Black Cadillac I know he miss my touch I never really really missed him  
  
Someday I sit and share my brand new song with you everywhere everywhere  
Theres this something hanging in the air a sticky love affair bubble gum in
my hair  
  
My baby came back in a big black  
My baby came back in a big black  
My baby came back in a big black Cadillac  
  
Black Cadillac it seems he lost the knack to blow my mind attack when I came
back  
Black Cadillac Im sure he miss my touch I never really really missed him much  
Black Cadillac the things that went too far arriving in the car Oh hell be
sold  
Black Cadillac Im sure he miss my touch I never really really missed him much  
  
Black Cadillac oh baby oh  
Black Cadillac I never missed him much  
Black black Cadillac
