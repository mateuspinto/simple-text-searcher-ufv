I waited for you  
You waited for me  
That it seemed like seemed like a mighty long time  
  
Baby I had to have you  
Oh I had to have you  
Come rain rain or shine  
  
It was a cold wind in August  
Shivers up and down my spine  
I was standin in your garden  
In the California pine  
  
I was standing shivering  
Ive got the fever in the rain  
But I cant come on back to see you  
Again and again and again  
  
I said I I had to have you  
Baby I had to have you  
Come rain come rain or shine  
  
It was a cold wind in August  
Shivers up and down my spine  
And I was standing in your garden  
  
In the California pine  
California pine  
  
It was a cold wind in August  
Shivers up and down my spine  
I was standin in your garden  
In the California pine  
In the California pine It was a cold wind in August  
I was pushed on through September  
Oh pushin through September  
In the rain  
Pushin through pushin through September  
In the rain  
  
Ooh  
It was a cold wind in August  
Shivers up and down my spine  
I was standin standin in your garden  
In the California pine
