The walls of my mind are closin in  
Cant get away  
Your memry wont end  
  
Chorus  
Cant forget about you Cant forget about you  
Cant forget about you Cant forget about you  
Breakin my mind in three quarter time makin me blue  
Cant forget about you Cant forget about you  
I never stop hearin the music after the song is through  
I still see your eyes your warm gentle smile  
It was all worthwhile each moment we knew  
Chorus
