Use the need lose control  
Hidden voice inviting  
Imposing will unconscious skill  
Embraced immoral passion  
Born is still thirst for thrill  
Indulgence of illusion  
Neurotic psychotic  
Dead silent screams come alive  
  
Killing seed first degree  
I shut the world outside  
Denied and laid to waste  
The body and soul divide  
  
A final thrill a timely kill  
Unbound unguarded  
Fantasized realized  
Enforced upon the dying  
Free reign of the asylum  
Archaic energy thrives  
Dead cold I control  
Eternal screams that slowly die  
  
Killing spree first degree  
I shut the world outside  
Denied and laid to waste  
The body and soul divide  
  
Dimentia born of sin  
A symptom that begins  
Vengeance so divine  
  
Lost my grip of whats real  
Unrestrained selfinduced vertigo  
Manic power chills my spine  
I cant erase this instinct I embrace  
  
Two faced moral abandon  
Races my blood boils my skin  
Unhinging the doorway to this asylum  
Releasing unshackled poison dreams  
Beginning the end of temptation  
A vengeance so divine  
The end of temptation  
A vengeance so divine  
  
Killing spree first degree  
I shut the world outside  
Denied and laid to waste  
The body and soul divide
