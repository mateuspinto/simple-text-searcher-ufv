Yo one two one two  
Wu Tang Wu Tang  
Its the Wu creepin in the shadows  
Wu Tang Wu Tang  
Wu Tang Wu Tang Wu Tang Wu Tang  
Oh baby for heavens sake  
Sir I Excalibur  
Oh baby for heavens sake  
Wu Tang Wu Tang Wu Tang Wu Tang  
Wu Tang Wu Tang Wu Tang Wu Tang  
Oh baby for heavens sake  
Yo hey yo my rap style swing like Willie Mays  
My eyes Purple Haze my solar razor burn through shades  
My grenades raid the airwaves catch this rap page  
I glide like hovercrafts on the Everglades  
Boom master with the faster blade track slasher  
Manufacture poems to microphones bones fracture  
Limited edition composition spark friction  
Nonfiction the calm bomb keep your arm distant  
Zero tolerance dominant intelligence  
Wu original true colors step from the melanin  
The most high most try to get close by  
And overthrow I but choke with they hopes up high  
I circulate the tristate and vibrate beyond the Richter  
Flies sense to flock when they spot this live nigga  
The crowd seducer black your third eye before I lose ya  
Verbal high I leave stars in the eyes of Medusa  
Top ten parley like Cochran its often  
Narrow margin of your odds to dodge the marksman  
Murder rap kill you soft like Roberta Flack  
Words attack like a British bulldog observe the stacks  
  
Wu Tang Wu Tang Wu Tang Wu Tang  
Oh baby for heavens sake  
Wu Tang Wu Tang Wu Tang Wu Tang  
Oh baby for heavens sake  
Wu Tang Wu Tang Wu Tang Wu Tang  
Oh baby for heavens sake  
Wu Tang Wu Tang Wu Tang Wu Tang  
Oh baby for heavens sake  
  
Now all pay tribute to this entity  
A spark that surges through the undergrowth  
Overwhelmin the populace from the entry  
The WuTang Dynasty has emerged  
From this elite fleet  
I was appointed to strike the vital nerve  
Mouths tend to utter and speak empty words  
Observe the magnetic attraction as we breathe  
Seeds of MCs at these fake ass industry niggas  
Feed off the chrome mic tend to squeeze off  
And spray an array of shots  
That travel downwind just respect pyrhiffic pen  
As I send the minds of the weak  
To rise and take power I blew towering over the land  
As we stand expanding our cream  
A dollar to every grain of sand  
Let the mind use the physical as planned  
  
Oh baby for heavens sake  
Wu Tang Wu Tang Wu Tang Wu Tang  
Oh baby for heavens sake  
  
Yo yo this is Beirut  
Try to comprehend check out my new suit  
Gods blend aim take fire pure destruction  
Dissappear from here my year drop the stupid LPs everywhere  
Fallin out the sky tall sniper  
Raps by Cappadonna hit the countryside  
Poetry whirlpool Rza and True collide  
We produce article exception to the rule  
We the black men that struck oil the hard boiled  
Cats that made that Watergate thing go spoiled  
The heavyhanded locked down stranged with Cyrus  
Wu Pirates sneak inside the club low eyes  
Low down dirty twelve thirty night time crawlers  
Offthewallers basketball gun brawlers  
Smoked out throw both fists for nineseven  
Slang reverend put the best work in  
  
Wu Tang Wu Tang Wu Tang Wu Tang  
Oh baby for heavens sake  
Wu Tang Wu Tang Wu Tang Wu Tang  
Oh baby for heavens sake  
Wu Tang Wu Tang Wu Tang Wu Tang  
Oh baby for heavens sake  
Wu Tang Wu Tang Wu Tang Wu Tang  
Oh baby for heavens sake
