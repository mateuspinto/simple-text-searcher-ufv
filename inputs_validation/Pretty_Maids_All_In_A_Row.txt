Hi there how are ya  
Its been a long time  
Seems like weve come a long way  
My but we learn so slow  
And heroes they come and they go  
And leave us behind as if  
Were supposed to know why  
  
Why do we give up our hearts to the past  
And why must we grow up so fast  
  
And all you wishing well fools with your fortunes  
Someone should send you a rose  
With love from a friend  
Its nice to hear from you again  
And the storybook comes to a close  
Gone are the ribbons and bows  
Things to remember places to go  
Pretty maids all in a row  
  
Ooo ooo ooo  
Ooo ooo ooo  
Ooo ooo ooo  
Ooo ooo ooo  
  
Ooo ooo ooo  
Ooo ooo ooo  
Ooo ooo ooo  
Ooo ooo ooo
