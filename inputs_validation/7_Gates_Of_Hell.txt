In a dream or a nightmare  
When love gives way to hate  
The quest begins  
For the keys to the seven gates  
Ride the wings of a locust  
See the wizard cast his spell  
Search for the keys to  
The seven gates of Hell  
In Heavens Hell  
Where all evil dwells  
And man and beast are one  
Conceiled to all  
Reveiled to none  
Lie those infernal gates  
Thoses damned infernal gates  
The seven gates of Hell  
Hear the cry of the zombie  
Raid the body of its soul  
The quest for the sacred keys  
Has become its goal  
Steal the wings of a hydra  
Take the sword from the sacred shrine  
The strength of the beast  
Take the sinners mind  
Unveiled in death to the sinner  
Written in the ancient book of lies  
Hear the demons call  
From the crimson waterfall  
As the blood rains from the skies  
When realities a dream  
And every lie is true  
In the day when you are me  
And the night when I am you  
When the flame of life grows cold  
We chime the silent bell  
And the unborn child is old  
The seven gates of Hell  
Going through the gates of Hell  
Oh in Heavens Hell  
So many died in vein  
They never lived their tales to tell  
None shall find the keys  
To set their spirits free  
From the seven gates of Hell  
The seven gates  
The seven gates  
The seven gates  
The seven gates of Hell  
I hear the creatures crawling  
Oh let me out of here  
Dont keep me locked away like this  
ohh nooo
