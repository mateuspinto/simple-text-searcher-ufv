See the girl with the changing faces  
See the boy with the aching smile  
Empty loves burned out traces  
See them walking down midnight mile  
Juliet look what love has done to you  
Juliet love has made a fool of you  
Watch them dancing on a frozen ocean  
See them skate where the ice is thin  
Empty love thats a cold emotion  
See the tears falling in the rain  
Juliet look what love has done to you  
Juliet love has made a fool of you  
Juliet look what love has done to you  
Juliet love has made a fool of you  
See the mist on the magic mountain  
Watch the moon in a blood red sky  
Empty love thats a dried up fountain  
Never change and never ask him why  
Juliet look what love has done to you  
Juliet love has made a fool of you
