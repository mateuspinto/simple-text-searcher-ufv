If you were the woman and I was the man  
Would I send you yellow roses  
Would I dare to kiss your hand  
In the morning would I caress you  
As the wind caresses the sand  
If you were the woman and I was the man  
  
If I was the heart and you were the head  
Would you think me very foolish  
If one day I decided to shed  
These walls that surround me  
Just to see where these feelings led  
If I was the heart and you were the head  
  
If I was the woman and you were the man  
Would I laugh if you came to me  
With your heart in your hand  
And said I offer you this freely  
And will give you all that I can  
Because you are the woman  
And I am the man
