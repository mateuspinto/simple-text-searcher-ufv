Not a dry eye in the house  
After loves curtain comes down  
Listen and youll hear the sound  
Hear the sound of a heart breaking  
I can still see you standing there  
Midnight wind blowin through your hair  
Kisses sweet in the salty air  
When love was forever  
Turn the page and we fade to blue  
The scene has changed now Im without you  
Walked away when the act was through  
And the dream was over  
It was almost like a movie  
The way you said goodbye  
You must have a lot of time rehearsing each and every line  
Now theres not a dry eye in the house  
After loves curtain comes down  
Listen and youll hear the sound  
Hear the sound of a heart breaking  
Not a smile left on my face  
The endings just too sad to take  
And theres not a dry eye  
Not a dry eye in the house  
The greatest story was you and me  
Had it all we had everything but now the  
Storys done its just history  
The last act is over  
You every line had the sweetest sound  
Your every touch turned my world around  
But the light came up and my world crashed down  
End of show  
Its over  
It was almost like a movie  
Those nights we touched the stars  
Time stood still for you and I  
Now its sad enough to make you cry  
Now theres not a dry eye in the house  
After loves curtain comes down  
Listen and youll hear the sound  
Hear the sound of a heart breaking  
Not a smile left on my face  
The endings just too sad to take  
And theres not a dry eye  
Not a dry eye in the house  
Act one  
The storys just begun  
Act two  
I fell in love with you  
Act three  
Knew it was meant to be  
Act four  
You dont love me no more  
And theres not a dry eye in the house  
After loves curtain comes down  
Listen and youll hear the sound  
Hear the sound of a heart breaking  
Not a smile left on my face  
The endings just too sad to take  
And theres not a dry eye  
Not a dry eye  
Not a dry eye in the house  
After loves curtain comes down  
Listen and youll hear the sound  
Hear the sound of a heart breaking  
Not a dry eye in the house  
Not a dry eye in the house  
Not a dry eye in the house
