Blessing and honor  
glory and power  
be unto the Ancient of Days  
From every nation  
all of creation  
bow before the Ancient of Days  
  
CHORUS  
Every tongue in heaven and earth  
shall declare Your glory  
every knee shall bow at Your throne  
in worship  
You will be exalted O God  
and Your Kingdom shall not pass away  
Oh Ancient of Days  
  
BRIDGE  
Your Kingdom shall reign over all the earth  
sing unto the Ancient of Days  
For none can compare to Your matchless worth  
sing unto the Ancient of Days
