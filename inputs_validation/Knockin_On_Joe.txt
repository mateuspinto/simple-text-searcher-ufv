These chains of sorrow they are heavy it is true  
And these locks cannot be broken  
No not with one thousand keys  
O Jailer you wear a ballnchain you cannot see  
You can lay your burden on me  
You can lay your burden down on me  
You can lay your burden down upon me  
But you cannot lay down those memories  
Woooo wooo wooo  
Woooo wooo wooo  
Here I go  
Knockin on Joe  
This square foot of sky will be mine til I die  
Knocking on Joe  
Woooo wooo wooo  
All down the row  
Knockin on Joe  
O Warden I surrender you  
Your fists caint hurt me anymore  
You know these hands will never wash  
These dirty Death Row floors  
O Preacher come closer you dont scare me anymore  
Just tell Nancy not to come here  
Just tell her not to come here anymore  
Tell Nancy not to come  
And let me die in the memory of her arms  
O woo woo woo  
Woo woo woo  
All down the row  
Knockin on Joe  
O you kings of halls and ends of halls  
You will die within these walls  
And Ill go all down the row  
Knockin on Joe  
O Nancys body is a coffin  
She wears my tombstone at her head  
O Nancys body is a coffin  
She wears my tombstone at her head  
She wears her body like a coffin  
She wears a dress of gold and red  
She wears a dress of gold and red  
She wears a dress of red and gold  
Gravelooters at my coffin  
Before my bodies even cold  
Its a door for when I go  
Knockin on Joe  
These hands will never mop  
Your dirty Death Row floors  
No You can hide You can run  
O but your trial is yet to come  
O you can run You can hide  
But you have yet to be tried  
You can lay your burden down here  
You can lay your burden down here  
Knockin on Joe  
You can lay your burden upon me  
You can lay your burden down upon me  
Knockin on Joe  
You caint hurt me anymore  
Knockin on Joe  
ad lib
