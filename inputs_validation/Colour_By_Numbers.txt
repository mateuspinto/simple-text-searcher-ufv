When I looked in your eyes  
Felt the spirit of man  
Demanding more than just a smile  
Took a chance for a while  
Speaking in tongues  
That float us down rivers  
The past will remind us  
All colours we chose  
When I told you those lies  
Felt the spirit of love  
Demanding more than compromise  
Took a chance for a while  
Speaking in tongues  
That float us down rivers  
The past will remind us  
All colours we chose  
Some people say that the way that we live  
Is out of this place  
And some people say that the way that we live  
Is blinded by fate  
All colours we chose
