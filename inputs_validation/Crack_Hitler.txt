Sink the eight ball  
Buy the lady a drink  
And nobody knows my name  
Bodies float up  
From the bottom of the river  
Like bubbles in fine champagne  
Hes the one no doubt  
Walkin on a tightrope  
Hes the one no doubt  
Got a gash on my head  
And a grin on my face  
And a shadow called danger  
Hidin in the sheets  
And on the streets  
In the heart of every stranger  
Here he comes look out  
Teach the world a lesson  
Here he comes look out  
Sweat on the brow  
And a tap on the phone  
And lives are on the line  
Pick up the briefcase  
On a high speed chase  
Breathin by the roll of the dice  
Reachin up to the top  
Were dependin on you  
Reachin up to the top  
In regards to  
My usage of the drug  
It modified my personality  
To the extent that I was  
Highly irritable  
I was like a crack Hitler  
Keep up the fight  
And in the wink of an eye  
Never give up  
Ooh ahh  
Look out
