They call me Mr Dynamite  
I blow things up in black and white  
An end to your charade  
A button I have made must be pushed  
  
There is no reason for the sky  
When Im on fire with your lies  
So if I can win this fight  
Then call me Mr Dynamite  
  
So here we stand  
Both you and I  
Were face to face  
But eye to eye  
Tomorrow you may change  
And I would be betrayed my friend  
  
Oh mommy mommy mommy  
Do you remember Mr Dynamite  
You know that guy from down the block  
He blew things up in black and white  
  
Yesterday he changed  
Today he is betrayed  
In the street  
On the ground  
The neighbors gather round  
  
Poor Mr Dynamite
