We sail through endless skies  
Stars shine like eyes  
The black night sighs  
The moon in silver trees  
Falls down in tears  
Light of the night  
The earth a purple blaze  
Of sapphire haze  
In orbit always  
  
While down below the trees  
Bathed in cool breeze  
Silver starlight  
Breaks down the night  
And so we pass on by  
The crimson eye  
Of great god mars  
As we travel the universe
