I could show you in a word  
If I wanted to  
A window on a world  
With a lovely view  
From close up inside a single room  
With an open book aside  
Like you read in school  
Its so easy believe me  
When you need fun  
  
I do anything to turn you on  
Anything to turn you on  
Is it raining in New York  
On Fifth Avenue  
  
And off Broadway after dark  
Love the lights dont you  
I could walk you through the park  
If youre feeling blue  
Or whatever  
  
Spring Summer whenever  
Winter through Fall  
Id do anything to turn you on  
Anything to turn you on  
I could leave you as you were  
If I wanted to  
  
Then I wonder is it fair  
Now youre on your own  
Who cares about you  
Except me God help me  
When things go wrong  
I do anything to turn you  
Must phone me you know me  
When things go wrong  
I do anything to turn you on
