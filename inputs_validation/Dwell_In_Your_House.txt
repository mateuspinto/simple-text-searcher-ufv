You set me apart  
Gave me a new heart  
Filled with compassion  
To share Your great love  
  
Show me Your ways  
I want to know You  
Guide me in truth  
My hope is in You  
  
That I may dwell in Your house forever  
Lifting up Your name  
Dwell in Your house forever more  
  
That I may dwell in Your house forever  
Lifting up Your name  
Dwell in Your house forever more  
  
Ill hold on to You  
My strength and my refuge  
Whom shall I fear  
I know You are near  
  
All of my days  
I live for You Lord  
Establish my path  
Theres one thing I ask  
That I may dwell in Your house forever  
Lifting up Your name  
Dwell in Your house forever more  
  
That I may dwell in Your house forever  
Lifting up Your name  
Dwell in Your house forever more  
  
Holy Spirit have Your way  
Sweet anointing teach our hearts  
Our lives we pray  
  
That I may dwell in Your house forever  
Lifting up Your name  
Dwell in Your house forever more  
  
That I may dwell in Your house forever
