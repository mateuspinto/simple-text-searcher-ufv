Ill be your mirror  
Reflect what you are in case you dont know  
Ill be the wind the rain and the sunset  
The light on your door to show that youre home  
  
When you think the night has seen your mind  
That inside youre twisted and unkind  
Let me stand to show that you are blind  
Please put down your hands  
Cause I see you  
  
I find it hard to believe you dont know  
The beauty that you are  
But if you dont let me be your eyes  
A hand in your darkness so you wont be afraid  
  
When you think the night has seen your mind  
That inside youre twisted and unkind  
Let me stand to show that you are blind  
Please put down your hands  
Cause I see you  
  
Ill be your mirror
