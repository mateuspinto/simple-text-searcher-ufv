Verse 1 Nicki Minaj  
Remember that time I showed up with just panties under my coat  
High heels they was knee high and my legs was grippin that throat  
You told me this and I quote cause we popped pills and you smoked  
You said your stuff got me strung out its like doin lines of some coke  
You always say its the best that you ever had in your life  
And you always play with it good when we be speedin off in that Wraith  
Just keep coppin them things that you be coppin me on the eighth  
You the president and Im Biden just slide in cause you safe nigga third
base  
  
Chorus The Weeknd  
I only call you when its half past five  
The only time that Ill be by your side  
I only love it when you touch me not feel me  
When Im fucked up thats the real me  
When Im fucked up thats the real me yeah  
I only call you when its half past five  
The only time Id ever call you mine  
I only love it when you touch me not feel me  
When Im fucked up thats the real me  
When Im fucked up thats the real me babe  
  
Verse 2 The Weeknd  
Ima let you know and keep it simple  
Tryna keep it up dont seem so simple  
I just fucked two bitches fore I saw you  
And you gon have to do it at my tempo  
Always tryna send me off to rehab  
Drugs started feelin like its decaf  
Im just tryna live life for the moment  
And all these motherfuckers want a relapse  
  
Chorus The Weeknd  
I only call you when its half past five  
The only time that Ill be by your side  
I only love it when you touch me not feel me  
When Im fucked up thats the real me  
When Im fucked up thats the real me yeah  
I only call you when its half past five  
The only time Id ever call you mine  
I only love it when you touch me not feel me  
When Im fucked up thats the real me  
When Im fucked up thats the real me babe  
  
Bridge The Weeknd  
Hills have eyes the hills have eyes  
Who are you to judge who are you to judge  
Hide your lies girl hide your lies  
Only you to trust only you  
  
Chorus The Weeknd  
I only call you when its half past five  
The only time that Ill be by your side  
I only love it when you touch me not feel me  
When Im fucked up thats the real me  
When Im fucked up thats the real me yeah
