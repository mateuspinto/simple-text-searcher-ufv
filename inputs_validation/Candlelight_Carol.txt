How do you capture  
The wind on the water  
How do you count all the stars in the sky  
How can you measure  
The love of a mother  
Or how can you write down  
A babys first cry  
  
Candlelight angel light  
Firelight and star glow  
Shine on his cradle till breaking of dawn  
Gloria Gloria in excelsis Deo  
Angels are singing  
The Christ child is born  
  
Shepherds and wise men  
Will kneel and adore him  
Seraphim round him their vigil will keep  
Nations proclaim him  
Their Lord and their Saviour  
But Mary will hold him  
And sing him to sleep  
  
Candlelight angel light  
Firelight and star glow  
Shine on his cradle till breaking of dawn  
Gloria Gloria in excelsis Deo  
Angels are singing  
The Christ child is born  
  
Find him at Bethlehem laid in a manger  
Christ our Redeemer asleep in the hay  
Godhead incarnate and hope of salvation  
A child with his mother  
That first Christmas Day  
  
Candlelight angel light  
Firelight and star glow  
Shine on his cradle till breaking of dawn  
Gloria Gloria in excelsis Deo  
Angels are singing  
The Christ child is born  
Angels are singing  
The Christ child is born
