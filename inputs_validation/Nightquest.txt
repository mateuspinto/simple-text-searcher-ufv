Born to the false world the wanderer  
Storyteller The Pied Piper  
On a quest for immortality  
Gathering a troop to find the fantasy  
  
Led by a maid  Queen of the night  
Voice of angels such a divine sight  
An Amazon to fight and cure  
This reality with her feline lure  
  
Patriotic to the promised land of Neverwaking Dream  
  
Nightquest  quest not for the past  
But for tomorrow to make it last  
Simply the best  way to walk this life  
Hand in hand with the dreamersminds  
  
Enter the realm dont stay awake  
The dreams remain they only brake  
Forget the task enjoy the ride  
And follow us into the night  
  
A merry minstrel with his fingers fast  
Playing his lute charming every lass  
Joins the troop with a glitter in his eye  
 Shall I find fame or shall I die  
  
A warrior of power along the path  
A hammerheart his gallantry to last  
Rhythm of sirens enemies take heed  
For in this war laws are a silent sleep  
  
Patriotic to the promised land of Neverwaking Dream  
  
Come to the elfland the eldest said  
In my guidance you shall not be afraid  
I am the mastermind the wizard to show the way  
  
First ones to guard this path of night  
Lady in black Lady in white  
Followed by legions of nighttime wanderers  
  
Guardians of the halls of heart  
When we from our homeland depart  
To challenge the gods of emptiness  
May the quest begin
