Im sitting in my bedroom  
Overlooking Findhorn Bay  
Cluny Hill inn the distance  
Summer on the way  
Blue skies and sailing boats  
Like a picture in a book  
I cant believe I got here  
Or how long it took  
Living one step at a time  
Putting one foot in front of the other  
It sure feels right  
Healing on my mind  
Been a long way  
Been a long way to the light  
Id made it to Manhattan  
Built myself a nest  
I meant to get right back to doing  
Exactly what I do best  
Pluggin in an electric guitar  
Leading a band  
Well if you want to give God a laugh  
Tell him your plans  
Summer in the city  
Wilting in the heat  
Buzzing up and down to Bearsville  
And back to Hudson Street  
I learned meditation  
And how to visualize  
Just breathing being still  
Never felt more alive  
Living one step at a time  
I spent the fall in transit  
Circling the moon  
Like a cat on a hot tin roof  
Like a fiddle without a tune  
I found what I was searching for  
In Mrs Caddys book  
I had to go there straightaway  
Have myself a look  
I flew back to Scotland  
Anticipation in my bones  
The old country welcoming me  
Like a prodigal coming home  
I knelt and kissed the tarmac  
In the wild Atlantic rain  
Felt the fiery Gaelic blood  
Rising in my veins  
Living one step at a time  
I spent the night in Glasgow  
Flew to Inverness  
I found the place and at the first  
I was not impressed  
Nobody said hello  
The faces left me cold  
Back then how was I to know  
All that would unfold  
I entered the Sanctuary  
Heard the voice of a girl  
Sending out a circle of light  
Clear across the world  
I shuddered in the Power  
Like a seedling in a storm  
Ive been traveling to this place  
Since the moment I was born  
Flew back to New York City  
Singing the big city blues  
The sand of Findhorn Bay  
Still clingin to my shoes  
I tried to restart my life  
But the life I knew was gone  
I had to let go everything  
But thats another song  
Living one step at a time  
So Im sitting in my bedroom  
Overlooking Findhorn Bay  
Cluny Hill in the distance  
Summer on the way  
Im watching sailing boats  
Bobbing to and fro  
Time to hit the road  
The only way I know  
Living one step at a time
