Love jus hear me out for a second  
Mind if I ask you a question  
Have you ever had a man that would make you cry  
  
Baby jus look into my eyes

To express how I love you  
  
Your my sweetheart from every sign above  
With passionate kinds of love  
I wanna give to you

Baby girl I wanna give my all to you  
Theres nothing in this world I wouldnt do  
And to give you my heart

And to give you my heart  
From the sky to the doves and the sea  
Baby from my heart  
Thats how much you mean to me
