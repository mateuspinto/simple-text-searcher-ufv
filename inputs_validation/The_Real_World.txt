I saw the autumn leaves peel up off the street  
Take wing on the balmy breeze and sweep you off your feet  
And you blushed as they scooped you up on sugar maple wings  
To gaze down on the city below ablaze with wondrous things  
Downy feathers kiss your face and flutter everywhere  
Reality is a lovely place but I wouldnt want to live there  
I wouldnt wanna live there  
  
Weighed down by heavy lids and lunar lullabies  
I knew you were wide awake because you smile with your eyes  
Downy feathers kiss your face and flutter everywhere  
Reality is a lovely place but I wouldnt want to live there  
From the green belt balcony the wildfires look so pretty  
Ponderosa canopy Id never leave if it were up to me  
To the ruby redwood tree and to the velvet climbing ivy  
Painted all mahogany Id never leave if it were up to me  
  
With a starry brush paint the dusk Venetian blue  
Because in the evening hush youll never believe the view  
And when the leaves return and their whisperings fill the night  
Theyll freeze and burn where fire and ice collide  
Where fire and ice collide  
  
Can you feel a silk embrace in the satin air  
If we dissolve without a trace will the real world even care  
Downy feathers kiss your face and flutter everywhere  
Reality is a lovely place but I wouldnt want to live there  
I wouldnt want to live there  
  
I saw the autumn leaves peel up off the street  
Take wing on the balmy breeze and sweep you off your feet
