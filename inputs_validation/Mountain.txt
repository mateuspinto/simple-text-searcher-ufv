Cat Stevens Milton Nascimento  
  
Midnight come colors are melting  
White moon shivering on the sea  
Like a ghost up to the mountain  
Wax Queen will carry me  
I can see the forest for miles  
All the creatures small and large  
If you crumble I wont be living  
For my love would have no house  
  
Mountain oh mighty mountain  
Show me secrets you have  
So I may become brother to Moses  
And live live and be glad  
I can feel all of your powers  
Growing lighter in the dark  
If you crumble I wont be living  
For my love would have no heart  
  
White moon white as my skeleton  
Who has seen martyrs among my brothers  
Yet strength remained in me to write the song  
Say no more The children already know  
And their dreams grow strong like the trees  
In their minds where thoughts are plotted  
Is also where crystal suns are forged  
  
And they will be older than a thousand years  
So that they may open the deserts of the heart  
And in these dreams of the mountain  
Friendship will surface
