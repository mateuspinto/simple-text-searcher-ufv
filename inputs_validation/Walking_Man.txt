Moving in silent desperation  
Keeping an eye on the Holy Land  
A hypothetical destination say  
Who is this walking man  
Well the leaves have come to turning  
And the goose has gone to fly  
And bridges are for burning  
So dont you let that yearning pass you by  
Walking man walking man walks  
  
Any other man stops and talks  
But the walking man walks  
Well the frost is on the pumpkin  
And the hay is in the barn  
Pappys come to rambling on  
Stumbling around drunk down on the farm  
And the walking man walks  
Doesnt know nothing at all  
Any other man stops and talks  
But the walking man walks on by walk on by  
  
Most everybodys got seed to sow  
It aint always easy for a weed to grow oh no  
So he dont hoe the row for no one  
For sure hes always missing  
And something aint never quite right  
Ah but who would want to listen  
To you kissing his existence good night  
Walking man walk  
Walk on by my door  
Well any other man stops and talks  
But not the walking man  
Hes the walking man born to walk  
Walk on walking man  
  
Well now would he have wings to fly  
Would he be free  
Golden wings against the sky  
Walking man walk on by  
So long walking man
