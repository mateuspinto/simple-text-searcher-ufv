I wrote me a letter to Syracuse it was a letter full of  
Lies  
I told them that we were doing fine very much to their  
Surprise  
For how were they to know that here the ground was soaked  
In red  
Or that we could fill the valley with our dead  
I started out and told them that by Christmas wed begin  
To pack our bags and head on home to bring the new year  
In  
While all around me boys who help me sow last seasons  
Crop  
By charging at the cannons till they drop  
  
I told my mother not to write cause were always moving  
  
On  
I told my brother not to join cause hed only fight me  
Gun  
But if we keep on much further retreating all the way  
Oh wed all be going home just any day
