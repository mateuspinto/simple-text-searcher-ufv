The morning slowly came my life about to end  
Then the wind would change all but one had left  
The angelic wolf had stayed without a word she said  
Follow me follow the wolf  
  
And so I followed the wolf up the wooded mountain side  
Close to the top she suddenly stopped  
Sun to the East man and beast  
Just two silhouettes in a landscape never to forget  
  
Like dark decaying teeth I saw the village beneath  
A few and distant roads all leading away from here  
Nobody in the streets decay  
I must follow the wolf again I must follow her till the end  
  
The end  
The Wolf had turned around facing higher ground  
And there it was The House of God  
In awe I looked as time had stopped  
  
Follow me  
I had never seen a church like this before  
This Place is terrible inscribed above the door  
Like dark decaying teeth I saw the church within  
  
A few distant thoughts inviting me in to sin  
Nobody in the church decay  
Shrouded in a gloomy light as if my final night  
I wonder if God was ever here  
Or did he turn away in fear did he turn away in fear
