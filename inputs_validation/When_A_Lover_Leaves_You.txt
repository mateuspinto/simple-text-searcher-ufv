What a situation  
Senses gone and left me  
Lies are like confetti on the floor  
  
Words are leading nowhere  
Delicate and tender  
Tender hooks that drive me to despair  
  
Storms are blowing  
Winds are calling to me  
  
Be my escape  
My reward  
It is you I adore  
See me through  
Where there are demons  
I see angels passing by  
The morning after nights before  
I have tried  
  
When a lover leaves you  
Cuts you without knowing  
The world just falls apart beneath your feet  
  
Talk is cheap and useless  
Nothing but excuses  
Lies are like confetti in my hands  
  
Storms are blowing  
Winds are calling to me  
  
Be my escape  
My reward  
It is you I adore  
See me through  
Where there are demons  
I see angels passing by  
The morning after nights before  
I have tried  
  
Be my escape  
My reward  
It is you I adore  
See me through  
Where there are demons  
I see angels passing by  
The morning after nights before  
I have tried  
  
Where there are demons  
I see angels passing by  
The morning after nights before  
I have tried  
Where there are demons  
I see angels passing by  
The morning after nights before  
I have tried
