Holy One  
Father of the Earth  
Create in me a pure heart  
So I can come in Spirit and in Truth  
To worship You  
Thats what I long to do  
I love to Praise  
I love to lift Your Holy Name  
From the rising of the sun  
And going down of the same  
Your name is great  
I will bless You all my days  
Cause I love to Praise  
Righteous One  
Lover of my soul  
Age to age forever still the same  
Your name is like the sweetest melody  
Here with You is where I long to be  
I love to Praise  
I love to lift Your Holy Name  
From the rising of the sun  
And going down of the same  
Your name is great  
I will bless You all my days  
Cause I love to Praise  
You are Holy  
My lips shall always speak Your praise  
You are Worthy  
Forever I will always sing Your praise  
I love to Praise  
I love to lift Your Holy Name  
From the rising of the sun  
And going down of the same  
Your name is great  
I will bless You all my days  
Cause I love to Praise
