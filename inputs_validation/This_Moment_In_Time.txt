Chorus  
More than a ripple less than a splash  
The heir to a long line of glory  
Give me the moment and Ill give you a song  
Its so good bein part of the story  
This moment in time  
This right time of day  
Oh I love bein with you and watchin my life at play  
  
My love in your eyes  
Is lightin my dreams  
And the feelins you choose  
Have touches of blues and greens  
  
This trip into time  
This timeless embrace  
Im like a kid in a store Ill always want more to taste  
  
And no matter what comes I know the sun is gonna shine  
Because of you and me therell be this moment in time  
  
And no matter what comes I know the sun is gonna shine  
Because of you and me therell be this moment in time  
  
Chorus  
  
And no matter what comes I know the sun is gonna shine  
Because of you and me therell be this moment in time  
  
La la la la la
