When you were standing in the wake of devastation  
When you were waiting on the edge of the unknown  
And with the cataclysm raining down insides crying save me now  
You were there impossibly alone  
  
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation  
You build up hope but failures all youve known  
Remember all the sadness and frustration  
And let it go let it go  
  
And in the burst of light that blinded every angel  
As if the sky had blown the heavens into stars  
You felt the gravity of temper grace falling into empty space  
No one there to catch you in their arms  
  
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation  
You build up hope but failures all youve known  
Remember all the sadness and frustration  
And let it go let it go  
  
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation  
You build up hope but failures all youve known  
Remember all the sadness and frustration  
And let it go  
  
Let it go  
Let it go  
Let it go  
Let it go  
  
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation  
You build up hope but failures all youve known  
Remember all the sadness and frustration  
And let it go let it go
