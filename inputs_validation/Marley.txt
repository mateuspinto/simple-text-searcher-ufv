Ive seen so many places and so many faces  
Left behind so many traces of my soul  
I carry all these voices with the ringing in my ears  
Some girls tears and the rhythm of the road  
Sometimes my life takes more than I can give  
Thats when I gotta go  
  
Where no ones around  
But the silence and the sound  
Of Three Little Birds for company  
I got a sip of something strong  
A secondhand Old Man and the Sea  
Out here with me  
Me and Marley  
Me and Marley  
  
God knows I love my life and I thank Him every night  
But sometimes I feel the knife of responsibility  
And the struggle and the strife whats wrong and whats right  
Has got me searching for the light and my place of peace  
  
Where no ones around  
But the silence and the sound  
Of Three Little Birds for company  
I got a sip of something strong  
A secondhand Old Man and the Sea  
Out here with me  
Me and Marley  
  
We all live in chaos noise and negativity  
But I still believe in one love bigger than you and me  
You and me  
You and me and Marley  
You and me and Marley  
  
I hear redemptions song  
A whisper on the sea  
Out here with me  
Out here with me  
Me and Marley  
Me and Marley  
Me and Marley  
Me and Marley  
  
I hear redemptions song  
Me and Marley  
Me and Marley  
Me and Marley
