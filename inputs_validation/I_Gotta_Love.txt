It only lasts  
Until it goes  
It only gives  
Until it leaves  
  
Oh my god  
Its only is love  
  
CHOURUS  
Oh i gotta love  
I gotta love  
I gotta love you  
  
We need some help  
With are love  
But it dosnt all last  
Until you lose it  
  
CHOURUS  
  
If you wont love  
I will love you  
Please baby  
Lets live and love together  
  
CHOURUS  
  
CHOURUS  
  
CHOURUS  
  
repeat again again whille fading till no sound heard
