Let my walk speak loud  
And my words be true  
Let my life be whole  
With my eyes on you  
Lord Im stepping out  
From the comfort zone  
Letting go of me  
Holding onto You  
  
Freedom comes  
When I call You Lord  
You are Lord my God  
  
You are the centre of it all  
The universe declares in awe  
Your majesty  
I surrender all  
I make you  
The centre of my life  
Lord I respond with all I am  
You placed in me the song  
Of heavens melody  
Your Majesty  
I live to sing Your song  
  
I have found Your peace  
It replaces any fear  
You have done it all  
I can trust in you  
So Im stepping out  
From the comfort zone  
Letting go of me  
Holding onto you  
  
This is your song not mine  
It is your song that bring healing to this land  
This is your song not mine  
It is your song that brings feedom  
Freedom comes when I call you Lord  
Freedom comes when I call you Lord  
You are Lord my God  
You are the song  
You are the majesty  
I live to sing your song  
Your majesty  
I live to sing Your song
