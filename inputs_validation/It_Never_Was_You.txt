Ive been searching through rains  
And the wind that follows after  
For one certain face  
And an unforgotten laughter  
Ive been following signs  
Ive been searching through the lands  
For a certain pair of arms  
And a certain pair of hands  
Yes I tried a kiss here  
And I tried a kiss there  
For when youre out in company  
The boys and girls will pair  
But it never was you  
It never was anywhere you  
An occasional sunset reminded me  
Or a flower hanging high on a julep tree  
Or one red star hung low in the west  
Or a heartbreak call from a Meadow Larks nest  
Made me think for a moment  
Maybe its true  
I found him in the star  
In the call  
In the blue  
But it never was you  
It never was anywhere you  
Anywhere anywhere you
