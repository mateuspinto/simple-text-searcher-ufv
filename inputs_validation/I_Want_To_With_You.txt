Love is a lot like a garden  
You throw your whole heart into  
Once I was easily started  
The hard thing to do  
Was following through  
  
But I want to with you  
Make a love that will last forever  
I want to with you  
make a life we can live together  
Baby I promise you  
Every time I laugh  
Every tear I cry  
Every long night I live through  
I want to with you  
  
Life is a lot like a battle  
When love is under attack  
Once I was easily rattled  
Id run just like that  
I wouldnt fight back  
  
But I want to with you  
Make a love that will last forever  
I want to with you  
make a life we can live together  
Baby I promise you  
Every time I laugh  
Every tear I cry  
Every long night I live through  
I want to with you  
  
Once upon a lonely time  
I didnt want to share my life  
But now I find in everything that I do  
I want to with you  
  
Baby I promise you  
Every time I laugh  
Every tear I cry  
Every long night I live through  
I want to I want to oh with you  
Oh I want to with you baby oh yeah  
I want to with you  
I want to with you  
I want to with you
