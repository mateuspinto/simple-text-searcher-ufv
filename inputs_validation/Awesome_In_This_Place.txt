Here in this house of the great King  
We come together now to worship Him  
This house is built on Christ our rock  
Cannot be shaken cannot be shaken  
God is awesome in this place  
We sense His presence as we sing His praise  
There is power here for a miracle  
Set the captives free make the broken whole  
God is awesome Hes so awesome  
God is awesome in this place
