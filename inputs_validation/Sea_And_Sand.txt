Here by the sea and sand  
Nothing ever goes as planned  
I just couldnt face going home  
It was just a drag on my own  
They finally threw me out  
My mother got drunk on stout  
My dad couldnt stand on two feet  
As he lectured about morality  
Now I guess the families complete  
With me hanging round on the street  
Or here on the beach  
  
The girl I love  
Is a perfect dresser  
Wears every fashion  
Gets it to the tee  
Heavens above  
I got to match her  
She knows just how  
She wants her man to be  
Leave it to me  
  
My jackets gonna be cut slim and checked  
Maybe a touch of seersucker with an open neck  
I ride a GS scooter with my hair cut neat  
I wear my wartime coat in the wind and sleet  
  
I see her dancing  
Across the ballroom  
UV light making starshine  
Of her smile  
I am the face  
She has to know me  
Im dressed up better than anyone  
Within a mile  
  
So how come the other tickets look much better  
Without a penny to spend they dress to the letter  
How come the girls come on oh so cool  
Yet when you meet em every ones a fool  
  
Come sleep on the beach  
Keep within my reach  
I just want to die with you near  
Im feeling so high with you here  
Im wet and Im cold  
But thank God I aint old  
I should have split home at fifteen  
Why didnt I ever say what I mean  
Theres a story that the grass is so green  
What did I see  
Where have I been  
  
Nothing is planned by the sea and the sand
