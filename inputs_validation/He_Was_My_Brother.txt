He was my brother  
Five years older than I  
He was my brother  
Twentythree Years old the day he died  
  
Freedom writer  
They cursed my brother to his face  
Go home outsider  
This towns gonna be your buryin place  
  
He was singin on his knees  
An angry mob trailed along  
They shot my brother dead  
Because he hated what was wrong  
  
He was my brother  
Tears cant bring him back to me  
He was my brother  
And he died so his brothers could be free  
He died so his brothers could be free
