Dear Mr President  
Come take a walk with me  
Lets pretend were just two people and  
Youre not better than me  
Id like to ask you some questions if we can speak honestly  
  
What do you feel when you see all the homeless on the street  
Who do you pray for at night before you go to sleep  
What do you feel when you look in the mirror  
Are you proud  
  
How do you sleep while the rest of us cry  
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye  
How do you walk with your head held high  
Can you even look me in the eye  
And tell me why  
  
Dear Mr President  
Were you a lonely boy  
Are you a lonely boy  
Are you a lonely boy  
How can you say  
No child is left behind  
Were not dumb and were not blind  
Theyre all sitting in your cells  
While you pave the road to hell  
  
What kind of father would take his own daughters rights away  
And what kind of father might hate his own daughter if she were gay  
I can only imagine what the first lady has to say  
Youve come a long way from whiskey and cocaine  
  
How do you sleep while the rest of us cry  
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye  
How do you walk with your head held high  
Can you even look me in the eye  
  
Let me tell you bout hard work  
Minimum wage with a baby on the way  
Let me tell you bout hard work  
Rebuilding your house after the bombs took them away  
Let me tell you bout hard work  
Building a bed out of a cardboard box  
Let me tell you bout hard work  
Hard work  
Hard work  
You dont know nothing bout hard work  
Hard work  
Hard work  
Oh  
  
How do you sleep at night  
How do you walk with your head held high  
Dear Mr President  
Youd never take a walk with me  
Would you
