I was at the break wall I was lookin at the sea  
In back of the eight ball in some misery  
There on the horizon stood a mighty ship of fools  
They were headin into the harbor with all their broken rules  
Whenever Im feelin lonely I can just pick up the phone  
Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone  
Theyre better off to be someplace thats a good long way from home  
Any way I can lose myself  
Dawn is breakin Im hesitatin  
Im fading away fading away  
They sailed right up to me I said Whats it all about  
Please try to excuse me we can work things out  
If youve ever wondered if that mighty ship is real  
Let me tell ya bout it brother it was somethin you could feel  
Whenever Im feelin lonely I let twilight set the tone  
Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone  
Theyre better off to be someplace thats a good long way to roam  
Aint livin high on the hog right now  
Dawn is breakin Im hesitatin  
Im fading away fading away  
One more day on the calendar in my mind  
I am down at the break wall puttin in some time  
The whole ship of fools has gotten safely under way  
And I was proud to be a part of what it was they had to say  
Whenever Im feelin lonely I can just pick up the phone  
Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone  
Theyre better off to be someplace thats a good long piece from home  
Any way I can lose myself  
Dawn is breakin Im hesitatin  
Im fading away fading away  
Fading away fading away
