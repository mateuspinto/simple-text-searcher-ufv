Pay phones all were ringing as the crowd went roarin by  
Lovely dancers swaying to an island lullaby  
Beside the southern ocean taking stock of whats to be  
Writing you this letter that youll probably never see  
  
But I cant help but be  
Ruled by inconsistency  
Not unique just distantly in love  
  
Tried to phone from Paris thinking  
Things could be arranged  
Me and you could rendezvous  
But I found your number changed  
So I drove to San Remo where  
The crazy painter dwells  
And toasted our old photographs  
Still up there on his shelf  
  
But I cant help but be  
Ruled by my antiquity  
Not unique just distantly in love  
I cant be the one to fill  
Your times and all your places  
I cant be the one to fill  
Your blanks and empty spaces  
  
I heard it from a friend of ours  
I saw in Timber Bay  
That you had a new lover who had  
Stolen you away  
That could be be the reason that  
I never got in touch  
And may present slight problems  
If he loves you half as much  
  
But I cant help but be  
Ruled by inconsistency  
Not unique just distantly in love  
  
As I who cant help but be  
Ruled by my antiquity  
Not unique just distantly in love  
You know I cant help but be  
Part of my own philosophy  
Not unique just distantly in love
