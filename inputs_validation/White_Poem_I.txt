Tell me why  
Tell me why  
Tell me why the wind is so cold  
Take my heart inside your love  
Tell me why  
Tell me why  
Tell me why I feel so blue  
Tell me why  
Tell me why I love you  
My love for you would break my heart  
No No No  
No way to change my heart  
I still wanna be in the endless blue verse  
I feel so blue in this white poem  
Love will find the way  
This is the line you used to love  
Do you still believe that  
While Im away read this line again
