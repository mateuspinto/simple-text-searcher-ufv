All this energy callin me  
Back where it comes from  
Its such a crude attitude  
Its back where it belongs  
  
All the little kids goin up on the skits go  
Cleveland rocks Cleveland rocks  
Jumpin Jane Jean and moonin James Dean go  
Cleveland rocks Cleveland rocks  
Cleveland rocks Cleveland rocks  
Cleveland rocks Cleveland rocks  
Cleveland rocks Cleveland rocks  
  
Momma knows but she dont careshes got her worries too  
Seven kids and a phony affair and the rent is due  
  
All the little chicks with the crimson lips go  
Cleveland rocks Cleveland rocks  
Livin in sin with a safety pin goin  
Cleveland rocks Cleveland rocks  
Cleveland rocks Cleveland rocks  
Cleveland rocks Cleveland rocks  
Cleveland rocks Cleveland rocks  
  
I got some records from World War II  
I play em just like me grand dad do  
  
He was a rocker and I am too  
Now Cleveland rocks Now Cleveland rocks  
Cleveland rocks Cleveland rocks  
Cleveland rocks Cleveland rocks  
Cleveland rocks Cleveland rocks  
Cleveland rocks Cleveland rocks  
Cleveland rocks Cleveland rocks  
Cleveland rocks Cleveland rocks  
Cleveland rocks Cleveland rocks  
Cleveland rocks Cleveland rocks  
Cleveland rocks Cleveland rocks  
Cleveland rocks
