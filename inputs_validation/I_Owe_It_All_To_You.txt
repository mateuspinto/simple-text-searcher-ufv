Last night you helped me through  
Took me to the lovers zone  
I saw there images  
Projected on a wall of stone  
I stood inside Egyptian temples  
I looked into eternal gardens  
Lay on the shores of distant islands  
Listening to the sea birds song of joy  
  
Oh I owe it all to you  
You make me happy  
Oh I owe it all to you  
  
Late last night we were right  
Into some exotic scene  
Everywhere images  
Appearing on a giant screen  
I stood inside a glass cathedral  
I looked into the golden canyon  
Lay by the lakes of holy water  
Glistening like a diamond in the light  
  
Oh I owe it all to you  
You make me happy  
Oh I owe it all to you
