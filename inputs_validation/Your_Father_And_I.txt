It was the middle of winter  
And I drove us in my car  
The snow started falling  
So we stopped off at a bar  
  
The beer started flowing  
And your mother and I took the floor  
But by the last dance we were tired  
So I booked a room next door  
  
So if anyone asks you  
If you come from Heaven above  
Youre from a one star hotel  
With a five star passionate love  
  
It was a hot summers day  
And we drove there in our car  
And your father was thirsty  
So we had to find a bar  
  
Well he couldnt stop drinking  
And he couldnt stand on his feet  
We had to walk to a hotel  
And book ourselves into a suite  
  
So if the teacher asks you  
Are you from Heaven or are you from Hell  
Youre from a one star drunken screw  
In a one star motel  
Yes if the teacher asks you  
Are you from Heaven or are you from Hell  
Youre from a pitch black toilet  
In a highway Taco Bell  
  
Ill remember the birth  
For the rest of my time on this land  
Youre mother sweating buckets  
And me holding onto her hand  
  
Well your father was absent  
He claimed he couldnt find the ward  
Just tugging on mescal  
Trying to eat the umbilical cord  
  
So if anyone asks you  
Do you know where youre from say yes  
Youre from your mothers womb  
And your fathers stinking breath  
And if they ask you how you got here  
Tell them just what it took  
Your fathers stinking breath  
And your mothers stinking luck  
  
Your father and I wont tell the whole truth  
Your father and I wont tell the truth
