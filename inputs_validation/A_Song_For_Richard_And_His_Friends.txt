If you will think now then you will see  
How you can change things  
People are waiting turning away  
Tired of killing  
  
Hey now  
Will you go away  
Were so tired  
Of things that you say  
  
Even though you never said word that would help anyone but yourself  
Tomorrow is such a bad dream  
Oh bad dream  
If you stay now  
  
It will only get worse  
Let us pray now  
Cause the truth really hurts  
Have to be a man so today with your brothers and sisters lay dying  
  
Tomorrow is such a bad dream  
Yeah such a bad dream  
Listen  
Please be gone  
  
Go away and leave us alone  
Bring police  
Go away and leave us in peace  
Yeah  
  
Please be gone  
Go away and leave us alone  
Bring police  
Go away and leave us in peace  
  
Will you go now  
Will you take all your friends  
Woah now If youd stood like a man  
Even though I know that you cannot be blamed all alone for all the sadness
youve caused  
  
Tomorrow is such a bad dream  
Yeah such a bad dream  
Oh yeah such a bad dream  
Dig it  
  
If you will think now you will then you will see  
How we can change things  
People are waiting turning away  
Tired of killing
