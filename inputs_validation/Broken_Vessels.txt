All these pieces  
Broken and scattered  
In mercy gathered  
Mended and whole  
Empty handed  
But not forsaken  
Ive been set free  
Ive been set free  
  
Amazing grace  
How sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost  
But now Im found  
Was blind but now I see  
  
Oh I can see it now  
Oh I can see the love in Your eyes  
Laying yourself down  
Raising up the broken to life  
  
You take our failure  
You take our weakness  
You set Your treasure  
In jars of clay  
So take this heart Lord  
Ill be Your vessel  
The world to see  
Your love in me  
  
Amazing grace  
How sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost  
But now Im found  
Was blind but now I see  
  
Oh I can see it now  
Oh I can see the love in Your eyes  
Laying yourself down  
Raising up the broken to life  
  
Amazing grace  
How sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost  
But now Im found  
Was blind but now I see  
  
Amazing grace  
How sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost  
But now Im found  
Was blind but now I see  
  
Oh I can see it now  
Oh I can see the love in Your eyes  
Laying yourself down  
Raising up the broken to life  
  
Amazing grace  
How sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost  
But now Im found  
Was blind but now I see  
  
Amazing grace  
How sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost  
But now Im found  
Was blind but now I see  
  
Oh I can see it now  
Oh I can see the love in Your eyes  
Laying yourself down  
Raising up the broken to life  
  
Oh I can see it now  
Oh I can see the love in Your eyes  
Laying yourself down  
Raising up the broken to life  
  
Oh I can see it now  
Oh I can see the love in Your eyes  
Laying yourself down  
Raising up the broken to life
