Early morning without warning  
Woke me with a scare  
I had that dream again  
That the sun was dead  
Make me warm or take me home  
Its so cold in here  
Cant we meet somewhere  
Is it winter there  
Is it winter there  
This winter  
  
Chorus  
Meet me in the summer time  
We can move the air  
Sweet Virginia countryside  
I will meet you there  
Bloody lips and cherry wine  
Moonshine in your hair  
Just keep staring at the sun  
Pray for summers end  
  
Come on over brave my storm  
Oceans overhead  
Come inside my friend  
Getting bad out there  
Every moment we have stolen  
All we had to share  
No one wanted this  
But you know I did  
You know I did  
This moment  
  
Chorus x2
