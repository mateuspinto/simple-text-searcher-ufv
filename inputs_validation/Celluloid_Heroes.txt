Everybodys a dreamer and everybodys a star  
And everybodys in movies it doesnt matter who you are  
There are stars in every city  
In every house and on every street  
And if you walk down Hollywood Boulevard  
Their names are written in concrete  
  
Dont step on Greta Garbo as you walk down the Boulevard  
She looks so weak and fragile thats why she tried to be so hard  
But they turned her into a princess  
And they sat her on a throne  
But she turned her back on stardom  
Because she wanted to be alone  
  
You can see all the stars as you walk down Hollywood Boulevard  
Some that you recognize some that youve hardly even heard of  
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame  
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain  
  
Rudolph Valentino looks very much alive  
And he looks up ladies dresses as they sadly pass him by  
Avoid stepping on Bela Lugosi  
Cause hes liable to turn and bite  
But stand close by Bette Davis  
Because hers was such a lonely life  
  
If you covered him with garbage  
George Sanders would still have style  
And if you stamped on Mickey Rooney  
He would still turn round and smile  
But please dont tread on dearest Marilyn  
Cause shes not very tough  
She should have been made of iron or steel  
But she was only made of flesh and blood  
  
You can see all the stars as you walk down Hollywood Boulevard  
Some that you recognize some that youve hardly even heard of  
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame  
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain  
  
Everybodys a dreamer and everybodys a star  
And everybodys in show biz it doesnt matter who you are  
And those who are successful  
Be always on your guard  
Success walks hand in hand with failure  
Along Hollywood Boulevard  
  
I wish my life was nonstop Hollywood movie show  
A fantasy world of celluloid villains and heroes  
Because celluloid heroes never feel any pain  
And celluloid heroes never really die  
  
You can see all the stars as you walk along  
You can see all the stars as you walk down Hollywood Boulevard  
Some that you recognize some that youve hardly even heard of  
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame  
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain  
  
La la la la  
  
Oh celluloid heroes never feel any pain  
Oh celluloid heroes never really die  
I wish my life was nonstop Hollywood movie show  
A fantasy world of celluloid villains and heroes  
Because celluloid heroes never feel any pain  
And celluloid heroes never really die
