Drop it  
Hey  
Ugh  
  
Try to crack  
And some will react  
Vocal snap or trap   
Im trying to rap  
  
Those who try to subdue  
The truth  
Lose their condition  
And the flames unactive  
  
Being an ignited one  
In the twentieth century  
 in a bottle of kerosiene  
  
Flame ignites into the black  
Sending fright  
Thought you could read minds  
And words and insight  
  
Backin the explosion on stage  
Comes fear  
Frances Fanon  
Ya you know his anger is so clear   
  
Using my brain  
Until the power is obtained  
Using my stength to gain  
A struggle for rage  
  
But I  
Choose to do doom to   
Yeah you know my anger is a gift  
  
I give to respect to test me on a face  
Hah  
Outlaw phase  
  
Release the reason  
Allow the pain  
The actors change  
But the plays the same  
  
Cmon  
In the narrows  
  
In the narrows  
  
In the narrows  
  
Some are the victims  of power  
But the style will   
Trying to rap  about the structure itself  
Pay only people to  Sorry Its hard to understand Zack right here  
  
State to state  
I set it straight  
I investigate  
To pay the   
  
I make an impression  
Yo  
My section after section  
  
No need for repression  
Just take a mic  
And a rap another session  
  
No need for guessing either that or gashing  
Yeah  
And that shit your spreading  
  
Release the reason  
Allow the pain  
The actors change  
But the plays the same  
  
Release the reason  
Allow the pain  
The actors change  
But the plays the same  
  
Cmon  
  
In the narrows  
  
In the narrows  
  
In the narrows  
  
Ugh  
  
Ugh  
  
Im on the mic  
Stepping up to suckas  
While were drumming out the style  
And I do it with a smile  
  
When I put punks on trial  
Taking em back again  
Yeah the name of the comprehender   
  
The style I drop is going on and on  
To the punks to recognize the style  
And to realize  
That Im not no Punk Kid  
  
Just stepping up for the mic hit  
  
Ugh  
  
In the narrows 4x  
  
Ugh
