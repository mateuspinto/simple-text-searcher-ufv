World spinning out of control  
The odds diminish every die we roll  
But we are still in the game  
If we should lose theres only us to blame  
  
Or have we gone too far  
Am I just wishing on a dying star  
Oh tell me have we gone too far  
  
Look round you what do you see  
Six billion people where theres room for three  
And so many mouths go unfed  
Oh Father give us all our daily bread  
  
Or have we gone too far  
Are we just wishing on a dying star  
Oh tell me have we gone too far  
  
Each year we find newer ways  
To turn this planet into empty space  
So close now to zero ground  
Weve got to find a way to turn it round  
  
Or have we gone too far  
Are we just living on a dying star  
Oh tell me have we gone too far  
  
Or have we gone too far  
Are we just wishing on a dying star  
Oh tell me have we gone too far
