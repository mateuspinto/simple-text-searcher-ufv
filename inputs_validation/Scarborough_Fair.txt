Are you going to Scarborough Fair  
Parsley sage rosemary and thyme  
Remember me to the one who lives there  
She once was a true love of mine  
  
Tell her to make me a cambric shirt  
Parsley sage rosemary and thyme  
Without a seem or needlework  
She once was a true love of mine  
  
Tell her to weave it in a sycamore wood lane  
Parsley sage rosemary and thyme  
And gather it all with a basket of flowers  
Then shell be a true love of mine  
  
Ask her to buy me an acre of land  
Parsley sage rosemary and thyme  
Between some water and the stand  
Then shell be a true love of mine  
  
Are you going to Scarborough Fair  
Parsley sage rosemary and thyme  
Remember me to the one who lives there  
Then shell be a true love of mine
