Where were you when you stole my pride  
Did you ever get the feeling thatsomeone died  
Hide away in your ivory tower  
And cover me in your golden shower  
Did I make you laugh when I played the clown  
And was I the dog that bit you when you put it down  
Break it nicely break it slow  
Break it so I got no place to go  
  
Ego a go go now youve gone solo  
Living on a memory  
Whereve you been lately  
And do you still hate me  
Could you offer an apology  
  
Aaah turn away  
Aaah fade to grey  
  
Where were you when the party ended  
Were you stitching up the wounds  
That you thought I need mending  
Wonderland has crashed to the ground  
The circus has gone all thats left is the clowns  
Did I break your heart when I stole your thunder  
Was there woodworm in the table your feet are under  
Break it nicely break it slow  
Break it so I got no place to go  
  
Ego a go go now youve gone solo  
Living on a memory  
Now youve gone stately  
And yes you do hate me  
Could you offer an apology  
  
Aaah turn away  
Aaah fade to grey  
Aaah I hope youve strayed  
Aaah and got laid  
  
Ego a go go
