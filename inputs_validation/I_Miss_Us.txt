Look at us and the life that we made  
Oh darlin I wouldnt trade a single thing  
Still in love  
But I cant help dream about yesterday oh yesterday  
  
I miss Sunday mornings free and easy  
Lazy days and endless evenings  
I really thought somehow  
That Id be over it by now  
  
And I miss lying in your arms till morning  
With nothing on our minds but making love  
Baby most of all  
I miss us  
  
Like a child I know it is selfish to say  
But sometimes I want you all to myself  
For a while  
Couldnt we go back and play in yesterday oh yesterday  
  
Walking on the beach alone together  
Sunsets that would last forever  
No where else to be  
Side by side just you and me  
  
And I miss lying in your arms til morning  
With nothing on our minds but making love  
Baby most of all  
I miss us  
  
All that we have lost  
Has all come back as love  
I know thats what family is about  
Still I miss  
  
Sunday mornings free and easy  
Lazy days and endless evenings  
I know well survive  
But it is eating me alive  
  
And I miss lying in your arms till morning  
With nothing on our minds but making love  
I cant hold it back another minute  
Im embarrassed to admit it  
  
But I still want to be your everything  
I know all that life has given us  
Is way more than enough  
  
But darlin I cant help myself  
I just love you too much  
Baby most of all  
I miss us
