I walked down the street like a good girl should  
He followed me down the street like I knew he would  
Because a guy is a guy wherever he may be  
So listen and Ill tell you what this fella did to me  
I walked to my house like a good girl should  
He followed me to my house like I knew he would  
Because a guy is a guy wherever he may be  
So listen while I tell you what this fella did to me  
I never saw the boy before  
So nothin could be sillier  
At closer range his face was strange  
But his manner was familiar  
So I walked up the stairs like a good girl should  
He followed me up the stairs like I knew he would  
Because a guy is a guy wherever he may be  
So listen and Ill tell you what this fella did to me  
I stepped to my door like a good girl should  
He stopped at my door like I knew he would  
Because a guy is a guy wherever he may be  
So listen while I tell you what this fella did to me  
He asked me for a goodnight kiss  
I said Its still good day  
I would have told him more except  
His lips got in the way  
So I talked to my ma like a good girl should  
And Ma talked to Pa like I knew she would  
And they all agreed on a married life for me  
The guy is my guy wherever he may be  
So I walked down the aisle like a good girl should  
He followed me down the aisle like I knew he would  
Because a guy is a guy wherever he may be  
And now youve heard the story of what someone did to me  
And thats what he did to me
