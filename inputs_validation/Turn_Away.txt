I open my arms to hold you you turn away you turn away  
I feel it just like I told you how can you turn away  
The things that we said last Saturday night you turn away you turn away  
Now you want to throw that away how can you turn away  
It was true love it was you and me and the sliver moon and the shining sea  
It was new but it felt to me just like love was supposed to be finally  
  
And now your eyes wont meet mine you turn away you turn away  
I never want to taste that sweet wine again how can you turn away  
It was true love it was you and me and the sliver moon and the shining sea  
It was new but it felt to me just like love was supposed to be finally  
  
And after this love Im keeping for you you turn away you turn away  
I never want to taste that sweet wine again how can you turn away  
It was true love it was you and me and the sliver moon and the shining sea  
It was new but it felt to me just like love was supposed to be finally  
  
And after this love Im keeping for you you turn away you turn away  
Ill dry these tears that Im weeping for you and take my turn to turn away
yeah
