You gave me life  
Gave me your heart  
Your shoulder when I needed to cry  
You gave me hope when all my hope is gone  
Wings so my dreams can fly  
And I havent told you enough  
Havent been good enough making you see  
  
Chorus  
  
My love for you will live in my heart  
Until eternitys through  
I see your smile in the eyes of my child  
I am who I am Mama Thanks to you  
  
You gave me your word  
Gave me your voice  
Gave me your everything  
Each breath of your life  
You believe when I can never have  
You teach my faith to survive  
And I never can do enough  
Never thank you enough for all that you are  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
I know the treasure Im filled with grace  
Whenever I see your face  
  
 Music  
  
And I see your smile in the eyes of my child  
I am who I am Mama Thanks to You  
To you
