Born from some mothers womb  
Just like any other room  
Made a promise for a new life  
Made a victim out of your life  
  
When your times on the door  
And it drips to the floor  
And you feel you can touch  
All the noise is too much  
And the seeds that are sown  
Are no longer your own  
  
Just a minor operation  
To force a final ultimatum  
Thousand words are spoken loud  
Reach the dumb to fool the crowd  
  
When you walk down the street  
And the sounds not so sweet  
And you wish you could hide  
Maybe go for a ride  
To some peep show arcade  
Where the futures not made  
  
A nightmare situation  
Infiltrate imagination  
Smacks of past Holy wars  
By the wall with broken laws  
  
The leaders of men  
Born out of your frustration  
The leaders of men  
Just a strange infatuation  
The leaders of men  
Made a promise for a new life  
No savior for our sakes  
To twist the internees of hate  
Self induced manipulation  
To crush all thoughts of mass salvation
