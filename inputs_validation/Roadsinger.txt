Roadsinger came to town long cape and hat  
People stood and stared then closed their doors as he passed  
He strolled the empty street kids banged on tin cans  
Then the panting dogs began to bark as the roadsinger sang  
  
Where do you go where do you go  
When hearts are closed  
When a friend becomes a stranger  
Nobody wants to know  
  
Where do you go where do you go  
When the world turns dark  
And the light of truth is blown out  
And the roads are blocked  
  
He stopped by a stall between the barrels and sacks  
A childs face peeped out and gave a smile and ran back  
Behind a misty glass on a windowpane  
A little finger drew a perfect heart and a name  
  
Where do you go where do you go  
In a world filled with fright  
Only a song to warm you through the night  
Where do you go where do you go  
After lies are told  
And the light of truth is blown out  
And the night is cold  
  
Roadsinger rode on to another land  
Though the people spoke a different tongue it understand  
They showed him how to share and took him by the hand  
Showed him the path to Heaven through the desert sand  
  
Where do you go where do you go  
To find happiness  
In a world filled with hatred Cheers  
Where do you go where do you go  
If no one cares  
And everybodys lost looking for theirs
