The man he stepped up to the microphone and he gave it a kiss  
It was a big wet slippery kiss  
And he had sweat dripping off of his nose onto the windscreen  
As he looked out over the audience he said  
God bless you God bless you one and all  
Then he took a can of Ronson lighter fluid  
And he squirted it over the top of his head  
And proceeded to light himself on fire  
As he stood there glowing and said  
Remember this day
