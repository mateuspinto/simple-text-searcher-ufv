In another time and space  
You meet your maker face to face  
You know who cast the spell  
And turned his eye on you  
Cant lose sight of it  
Never fading out  
Fading out of view  
Number the brave  
In your heart  
Number the brave  
For they died for you  
Out of the free zone  
Into the night   
There has to be a sacrifice  
Its such a scary feeling  
You must feel it too   
From a fallen angel fading in and fading out of view  
So when we reach the other side  
You know their fight is justified  
Now you see the meaning  
Of the dream they share with you   
Its a burning light  
Never fading out  
Fading out of view  
Number the brave  
In your heart  
Number the brave  
For they died for you
