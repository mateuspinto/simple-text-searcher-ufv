Alien jargon  
  
Get up yall yeah  
  
Stand Up 5x  
  
I woke up to the angels  
They singing in my head  
You look so good naked next to me  
The angel in my bed  
  
Stand Up 4x  
  
Oh you feel like a drug  
Thats cooking in my veins  
Till Im so out of my mind  
And shoots you up again  
  
Stand Up 4x  
  
Instrumental  
  
Save my soul Stand Up  
  
Smell like smoky fire  
Is burning in us all  
You drop me in the water  
Lift me up save my soul  
  
Stand Up 8x  
  
Sax Solo  
  
Save my soul Stand Up  
  
Stand Up 12x fade out
