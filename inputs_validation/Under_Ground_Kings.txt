Bridge over troubled water ice in my muddy water  
Rich off a mixtape got rich off a mixtape  
Probably shouldnt be driving it just got so much harder  
Cant even steer straight I cant even steer straight  
Oh fuck with me I buy the shots  
Live a little cause niggas die a lot and lie a lot  
But Im the truth thats right I fucking said it  
The living proof that you aint gotta die to get to heaven  
You girl you right there you look like you like this shit  
Howd I know howd I know Thats me on some psychic shit  
I can tell a lie if you ask me about my whereabouts  
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about  
Reppin bitches reppin bitches bitches  
And reppin reppin them bitches until all of us switches  
I swear its been two years since somebody ask me who I was  
Im the greatest man I said that before I knew I was  
Thats whats important and what really happened before this  
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans  
Singing walking like a man finger on the trigger  
I got money in my pocket Im a uptown nigga ah  
With fame on my mind my girl on my nerves  
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve  
That was back in the days Acura days  
I was a cold dude Im getting back to my ways  
  
Chorus  
People always ask how I got my nice things  
Take my crown to the grave Im an underground king  
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told  
Cause Im down to spend whatever lately Ive been on a roll  
And I do it for the city cause you know the city love a nigga  
Do it for the city cause you know the city love it a nigga  
Do it for the city cause you know the city love it a nigga  
Do it for the city UGK fuck these other niggas  
  
Sometimes I need that romance sometimes I need that pole dance  
Sometimes I need that stripper thats gon tell me that she dont dance  
Tell me lies make it sound good make it sound good  
Do me like the women from my town would  
Leather with that woodgrain Persian rugs on wood floors  
Talking all them good things thats all Im really good for  
Memphis Tennessee no see I start to go deep back  
And rich crust with my seat back with Yo Gotti and EMack  
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth  
And they rockin furs like its snowing in the south  
And every pretty girl tell me thats the shit that she like  
So why am I a classic this is who Im trying to be like  
So I drop out lessons I was taught are quick to fade  
As soon I realize that termend papers they wont get me paid  
If I dont nothing Ima ball  
Im countin all day like a clock on the wall  
Yeah need that making major changes to the life Im living  
I had no choice I had to prove I made the right decisions  
That was back in the days Acura days  
I was a cold dude Im getting back to my ways  
  
Chorus
