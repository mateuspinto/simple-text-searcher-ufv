I was born on a thousand acres of Oklahoma land  
Nothing grew on the thousand acres for it was gravel and sand  
One day father started digging in a field  
Hoping to find some soil  
  
He dug and he dug and what do you think  
Oil oil oil  
The money rolled in and I rolled out with a fortune piled so high  
Washington was my destination  
And now who am I  
  
Im the chosen party giver  
For the White House clientele  
And they know that I deliver  
What it takes to make em jell  
  
And in Washington Im known by one and all  
As the hostess with the mostes on the ball  
They could go to Elsa Maxwell  
When they had an axe to grind  
  
They could always grind their axe well  
At the parties she designed  
Now the hatchet grinders all prefer to call  
On the hostess with the mostes on the ball  
  
Ive a great big bar and good caviar  
Yes the best that can be found  
And a large amount in my bank account  
When election time comes round  
  
If youre feeling presidential  
You can make it yes indeed  
There are just three things essential  
Let me tell you all you need  
  
Is an ounce of wisdom and a pound of gall  
And the hostess with the mostes on the ball  
  
Entertaining vodka drinkers  
Is a job they give to me  
Making nice guys out of stinkers  
Seems to be my cup of tea  
  
What they really need behind the iron wall  
Is the hostess with the mostes on the ball  
Theres a book of regulations  
As to who sits next to who  
  
But there might be complications  
When the blue bloods not so blue  
So the priestess with the leastes protocol  
Is the hostess with the mostes on the ball  
  
An Ambassador has just reached the shore  
Hes a man of many loves  
An important gent from the Orient  
To be handled with kid gloves  
  
He can come and let his hair down  
Have the best time of his life  
Even bring his new affair down  
Introduce her as his wife  
  
But she mustnt leave her panties in the hall  
For the hostess whos the hostess with the mostes on the ball  
  
Ive been highly complimented  
And I thank you what is more  
Youll be damned well represented  
By your new ambassador  
  
For my one ambition is to make them fall  
For the hostess with the mostes on the ball  
In the handbag that Ill carry  
Theres a precious little note  
  
To their highnesses from Harry  
Introducing me he wrote  
Ill appreciate a favor large or small  
For the hostess with the mostes on the ball  
  
Therell be no mistakes Ive got what it takes  
To make friends across the sea  
Ill make being smart an important part  
Of my foreign policy  
  
Ill cement our good relations  
When I give my first affair  
Therell be special invitations  
To the Duke and Duchess there  
  
Whos already written asking them to call  
Not the priestess with the leastes  
But the hostess whos the hostess with the mostes on the ball
