I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath  
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess  
So I sat quietly agree politely  
I guess that I forgot I had a choice  
I let you push me past the breaking point  
I stood for nothing so I fell for everything  
  
You held me down but I got up  
Already brushing off the dust  
You hear my voice your hear that sound  
Like thunder gonna shake your ground  
You held me down but I got up  
Get ready cause I had enough  
I see it all I see it now  
  
I got the eye of the tiger a fighter  
Dancing through the fire  
Cause I am a champion and youre gonna hear me roar  
Louder louder than a lion  
Cause I am a champion and youre gonna hear me roar  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Youre gonna hear me roar  
  
Now Im floating like a butterfly  
Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes  
I went from zero to my own hero  
  
You held me down but I got up hey   
Already brushing off the dust  
You hear my voice your hear that sound  
Like thunder gonna shake the ground  
You held me down but I got up  
Get ready cause Ive had enough  
I see it all I see it now  
  
I got the eye of the tiger a fighter  
Dancing through the fire  
Cause I am a champion and youre gonna hear me roar  
Louder louder than a lion  
Cause I am a champion and youre gonna hear me roar  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Youre gonna hear me roar  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Youre gonna hear me roar  
  
Roar roar roar roar roar  
  
I got the eye of the tiger a fighter  
Dancing through the fire  
Cause I am a champion and youre gonna hear me roar  
Louder louder than a lion  
Cause I am a champion and youre gonna hear me roar  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Youre gonna hear me roar  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Youre gonna hear me roar
