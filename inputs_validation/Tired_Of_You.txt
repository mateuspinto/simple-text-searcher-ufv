I can be your liar  
I can be your bearer of bad news  
Sick and uninspired by  
The diamonds in your fire  
Burning like a flame inside of you  
But is this just desire or the truth  
  
So shame on me for the ruse  
Shame on me for the blues  
Another one returned that Ill never use  
  
I wont go getting tired of you  
I wont go getting tired of you  
Im not getting tired  
I wont go getting tired of you  
I wont go getting tired of you  
Im not getting tired  
  
Hanging on this wire  
Waiting for the day I have to choose  
Cursed by love so dire  
One more boy for hire  
One more boy to lend a hand to you  
But it is this just desire or the truth  
  
So shame on me for the ruse  
Shame on me for the blues  
Another one returned that Ill never use  
  
I wont go getting tired of you  
I wont go getting tired of you  
Im not getting tired  
I wont go getting tired of you  
I wont go getting tired of you  
Im not getting tired  
Of you  
Of you  
  
I can be your liar  
I can be your bearer of bad news  
Sick and uninspired by  
The diamonds in your fire  
Burning like a flame inside of you  
Is this just desire or the truth  
  
So shame on me for the ruse  
Shame on me for the blues  
Another one returned that Ill never use  
  
I wont go getting tired of you  
I wont go getting tired of you  
Im not getting tired  
I wont go getting tired of you  
I wont go getting tired of you  
Im not getting tired  
Of you
