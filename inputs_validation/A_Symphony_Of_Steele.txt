Magick speaks with tongues of Fire Fortune take my hand  
Iron pounding dongs of Glory Soaring on command  
Screaming I rejoin the fray  
  
Take me where the thunder walks A SYMPHONY OF STEELE  
Take my where the falcon flies A SYMPHONY OF STEELE  
  
Sound the trumpet crack the mountain let the arrow fly  
Through the land of Lamentation let the tidings fly  
Mercury the God and I  
  
Take me where the thunder walks A SYMPHONY OF STEELE  
Take me where the falcon flies A SYMPHONY OF STEELE  
  
Spark the ashes free the temple stem the crimson tide  
Toll the bells of Freedom souting  
Praise for those whove died  
Wield the Sword of Destiny  
  
Take me where the thunder walks A SYMPHONY OF STEELE  
Take me where the falcon flies A SYMPHONY OF STEELE  
A SYMPHONY OF STEELE  
  
If passion denies you dont die on your knees  
Fight with a vengeance what weakness decrees  
The Wrath of the Tempest the cries of the slain  
Tragic in splendor in death you are free  
I follow the Sign bring on the sound of thunder  
bring on the rain  
Spirit of Dark Enchantment remember my name  
  
Take me where the thunder walks A SYMPHONY OF STEELE  
Take me where the falcon flies A SYMPHONY OF STEELE  
A SYMPHONY OF STEELE  
  
Take me where the thunder walks A SYMPHONY OF STEELE  
Take me where the falcon flies A SYMPHONY OF STEELE  
Take me where the thunder walks A SYMPHONY OF STEELE  
Take me where the falcon flies A SYMPHONY OF STEELE  
A SYMPHONY OF STEELE  
  
A SYMPHONY OF STEELE
