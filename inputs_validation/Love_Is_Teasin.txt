I wish I wish I wish in vain  
I wish I were a maid again  
But a maid again I can never be  
Until apples grow on an ivy tree  
For love it is pleasin and love is teasin  
And love is a treasure when first its new  
But as love grows older then love grows colder  
And it fades away like the morning dew  
There is a little house into town  
And there my love he sits him down  
He takes a strange girl on his knee  
And he tells her things that he wants to be  
For love and water make younger older  
And love and whiskey make her old and grey  
And what cannot be cured love must be endured love  
And now I am bound for America  
La la la la la la   
La la la la la la   
As life grows older sure love grows older  
And it fades away like the morning dew
