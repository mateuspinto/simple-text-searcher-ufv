Tell me  
Remind me  
Chase the water racing from the sky  
Always  
Beside me  
Taste the memories running from my eyes  
  
Nervous flashlights scan my dreams  
Liquid shadows silence their screams  
I smile at the moon  
Chasing water from the sky  
I argue with the clouds  
Stealing beauty from my eyes  
  
Outside the soundness of your mind  
Bathing your soul in silver tears  
Beneath a blackened summer sky  
Praying for time to disappear  
  
Beneath a summer sky  
Under glass moonlight  
Night awaits the lambs arrival  
Liquid shadows crawl  
Silver teardrops fall  
The bride subsides to her survival  
  
By your hand  
Ive awakened  
Bear this honor in my name  
  
Outside the soundness of your mind  
Bathing your soul in silver tears  
Beneath a blackened summer sky  
Praying for time to disappear  
  
Outside the soundness of your mind  
Bathing your soul in silver tears  
Beneath a blackened summer sky  
Praying for time to disappear
