In every corner of my memory  
Theres no place you wouldnt be  
If anything I wish I had  
Another dream with you  
Life was forever yesterday  
Nothing in the world could take  
Your love away will I ever know  
That time will ease the pain  
For me someday  
  
She said I wont leave you ever  
Just love me forever  
She said you can leave but never  
Walk away  
  
Lights reflecting in the evening sun  
Back to the place where we were one  
Soul mates forever about to chase  
Rainbows in the dark  
Another day to destiny  
Come on and set me free  
When I close my eyes I see your smile  
As I walk in the pouring rain  
I call your name  
  
She said I wont leave you ever  
Just love me forever  
She said we will be together someday  
She said I wont leave you ever  
Just love me forever  
She said you can leave but never  
Walk away  
  
I can see a million faces  
When I take a walk outside  
But I just never knew  
That I could go a million places  
And Id see always only you  
  
The loneliness crawls up on me  
Without you theres no me  
At any time or any place  
But time will ease the pain  
For me someday  
  
She said I wont leave you ever  
Just love me forever  
She said we will be together someday  
She said I will wait forever  
I wont leave you ever  
She said you can leave but never  
Ever walk away  
  
Dont walk away  
Oh no dont walk away  
Ill be waiting always  
Until youll wake up from this dream  
Someday
