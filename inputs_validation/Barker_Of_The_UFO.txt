Barker sing me a song  
Instead of counting trees  
Collecting aeroplane numbers now Mr Barker  
Live it up shine my shoes  
  
Fly me to the moon   
Never before have I seen the light Mr Barker  
Then the moment of depression fell around  Mr Barker  
And the changes of expression to a frown My friend Barker  
  
There must be something there  
Shiner of the light we demand we are here Mr Barker  
Then the moment of depression fell around  Mr Barker  
And the changes of expression to a frown my friend Barker  
  
There must be something there  
Shiner of the light  we demand we are here  Mr Barker  
Barker sing me a song  
Instead of counting trees  
  
Collecting aeroplane numbers now Mr Barker  
Live it up shine my shoes  
Fly me to the moon   
Never before have I seen the light  
  
Barker sing me a song  
Instead of counting trees  
Collecting aeroplane numbers now  Mr Barker  
Live it up  shine my shoes  
Fly me to the moon  
Never before have I seen the light fade out
