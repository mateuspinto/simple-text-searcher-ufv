Mustang Sally think you better slow your mustang down  
Mustang Sally think you better slow your mustang down  
You been running all over the town now  
Oh I guess Ill have to put your flat feet on the ground  
  
All you want to do is ride around Sally ride Sally ride  
All you want to do is ride around Sally ride Sally ride  
All you want to do is ride around Sally ride Sally ride  
  
One of these early mornings oh you gonna be wiping your weeping eyes  
I bought you a brand new mustang bout nineteen sixty five  
Now you come around signifying a woman you dont want to let me ride  
Mustang Sally think you better slow your mustang down  
You been running all over the town now  
Oh I guess Ill have to put your flat feet on the ground  
  
All you want to do is ride around Sally ride Sally ride  
All you want to do is ride around Sally ride Sally ride  
All you want to do is ride around Sally ride Sally ride
