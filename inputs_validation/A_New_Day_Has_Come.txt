I was waiting for so long  
For a miracle to come  
Everyone told me to be strong  
Hold on and dont shed a tear  
  
So through darkness and good times  
I knew Id make it through  
And the world thought I had it all  
But I was waiting for you  
  
Hush now  
I see a light in the sky  
Oh its almost blinding me  
I cant believe Ive been touched by an angel  
With love  
  
Let the rain come down  
And wash away my tears  
Let it fill my soul  
And drown my fears  
Let it shatter the walls  
For a new sun  
A new day has come  
A new day has come  
  
Where it was dark now theres is light  
Where there was pain now theres joy  
Where there was weakness i found my strength  
All in the eyes of a boy  
  
Hush now  
I see a light in the sky  
Oh its almost blinding me  
I cant believe Ive been touched by an angel  
With love  
  
Let the rain come down  
And wash away my tears  
Let it fill my soul  
And drown my fears  
Let it shatter the walls  
For a new sun  
A new day has come  
A new day has come
