King Henry 8th my father hoped I have some Tudor brothers mum had no sons  
So rather I got plenty of step mothers when at last prince Ed was born the  
Crown I bid adieu they said as king he must be sworn boys go first in the  
Queue but theres no worry if at first you dont succeed when Ed died I  
Swept aside the rest and was decreed  
  
Mary the first thats me Tudor lady and queen of England not to be confused  
With Mary queen of Scots not the same see though weirdly shes a cousin to  
Me  
  
Some tried to say Lady Jane Grey should be queen after Ed but England  
Wanted me hooray so poor Jane lost her head the Protestants were saying  
That my ruling made them sick cause when it comes to praying my tastes  
Were catholic they revolted challenged me fuelled my great desire to tie  
300 to a steak light touch paper then retire  
  
Mary the first thats me called the bloody queen of England not what I  
Intended tried to be good you see but history only remembers I was a  
Catastrophe  
  
Married Phillip king of Spain who then left me England he thought was a  
Pain especially cause he told me to attack France with troops and when the  
French advanced we lost Calais oops through out my reign it rained and  
Rained it poured upon the poor the harvest failed no food remained and flu  
Killed many more burned Protestants and wed a fool led armies to defeat  
Burned more Prots I say more rule was short but not that sweet I had no  
Kids called half sis Liz as a big queen Bess to be so long as she would  
Rule the land as a catholic queen like me  
  
Lizee didnt listen she made the country Protestant meaning my legacy was  
Ruined see everything I tried to achieve went down the swanny  
  
Bit embarrassing really
