Six sets smoked on Saturdays  
At Barnabys on State  
Countless California calls  
We could not stand the wait  
We played the pier on Venice beach  
The crowd called out for more  
Zappa and the Mothers next  
We finished with a roar  
Jimi was so kind to us  
Had us on the tour  
We got some education  
Like we never got before  
Around the world in twenty days  
We played most every night  
Jetlag girls strange languages  
Everyone began to fight  
Lowdown at the Caribou  
All rumours aside  
Was we could never get together  
Not unless we tried  
Summer with the Beach Boys  
We got sand all in our shoes  
Made some special music  
Everybody sang the blues
