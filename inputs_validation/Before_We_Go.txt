Before we go  
I want you to know  
How much I love  
Sharing with you  
All that I have  
And all that I am  
Belongs to you  
All of the time  
  
You been so kind  
And wonderful  
By being here  
So close to me  
Deep in my heart  
I clearly see  
That you and I  
Will soon be free  
  
Ill be standing here  
Waiting on you  
I can hardly wait  
To make you mine mine mine  
Its time to go  
And nothing can stop  
Or even delay  
Our journeys goal  
Remember to be one with you heart  
One with the sky one with the sea
