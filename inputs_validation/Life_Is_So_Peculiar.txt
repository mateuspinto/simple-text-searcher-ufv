Life is so peculiar  
You get so wet in the rain you know I do  
You get so warm in the sunshine get my sun tan  
It doesnt pay to complain I never complain  
  
When I get up each morning  
Theres nothing to breathe but air yeah  
And when I look in the mirror  
Theres nothing to comb but hair  
  
And when I sit down to breakfast  
Theres nothing to eat but food  
Life is so peculiar  
But you cant stay home and brood  
  
Oh life tell em about it pops is so peculiar  
The deserts only got sand and thats grand  
The oceans only got water and you cant drink it all up  
And you never know where you stand  
  
When I get out to dinner  
Theres nothing to wear but clothes yeah  
And whenever I get sleepy  
Theres nothing to do but doze yeah  
  
And whenever I get thirsty  
Theres nothing to do but drink  
Life is no peculiar  
That it makes you stop and think  
  
Yes life is so peculiar sure it is  
A fork belongs with the knife it sure does  
Corn beef is lost without cabbage I love cabbage  
Husband should have a wife  
  
Yes life is so peculiar  
But as everybody says  
Thats life  
  
Life yes life its so peculiar  
A bird can usually sing no words I do too  
A pearl is made by an oyster New Orleans Rampart Street  
You cant be sure of a thing  
  
When I get tired of restin  
Theres nothing to do but walk walk it off pop  
And when I dont care to listen  
Theres nothing to do but talk keep you big mouth shut  
  
When Im up in the airplane  
Theres nothing to do but fly  
Life is so peculiar  
But I often wonder why  
  
Oh life is so peculiar sure it is  
A fork belongs with a knife you know  
Corn beef is lost without cabbage leftover cabbage Yeah  
A husband should have a wife  
  
Yes life is so peculiar  
But as everybody says  
Thats life  
  
One more for me Jim thats life  
Let me hear it one time thats life  
All together thats life yeah
