A single grain can tip the scale  
Amidst the burden the scale will prevail  
Showing whats worth being here  
Storyteller by a hearth of stone  
A white little creature purring me  
My childhood kingdom gone in time  
The islands filling my mind with blue  
The one in special heavens court  
All the joy unforgiven by this task  
An errant soul homeless and foul  
All gone but the will to live to tell the tale  
The days are filled with anxiety  
Frustration one right note a day  
Where to find a perfect tune  
Just do the work and take a step back  
All the joy unforgiven by this task  
An errant soul homeless and foul  
All gone but the will to live to tell the tale  
Dark chambers of my mind  
Locked around the neck of my love  
None of you understand and it doesnt matter  
To a broken marionette like me  
Me  
An errant soul homeless and foul  
An errant soul homeless and foul  
All gone but the will to live to tell the to tell the tale
