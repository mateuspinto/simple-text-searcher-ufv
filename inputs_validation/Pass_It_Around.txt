Pass It Around  
  
I wish I had a place to stay in LA for a week or so  
I feel like bein jive hangin out maybe go to Mexico  
Cause dreamin baby thats the way I want to be  
Just want to sit in a tree sail out to sea live like some fantasy ahh
baby  
  
Cause Im tired of thinkin and too much drinkin all my troubles away  
Tired of goin to get laid at the lost and found  
Tired of dealin with love hurt feelings and all I got to say  
In view of all thats been goin down  
I think Ill go on out and pass it around  
  
I wonder why Im doin what Ive been doin for a while  
Cant say its the money no so maybe its the style  
Cause dreamin baby thats the way that I like it  
Just want to get on a plane go some place insane throw myself one real good
fit  
  
Cause Im tired of thinkin and too much drinkin all my troubles away  
Tired of goin to get laid at the lost and found  
Tired of dealin with love hurt feelings and all I got to say  
In view of all thats been goin down  
I think Ill go on out and pass it around  
  
I think Ill go on out and pass it around  
Listen to me baby  
Pass it around  
I think Ill go on out and pass it around  
I want to pass it around  
I want to get on out and pass it around  
I want to pass it around  
  
Cause Im tired of thinkin and too much drinkin all my troubles away  
I want to pass it around  
Tired of goin to get laid at the lost and found  
I think Ill go on out and pass it around  
Tired of dealin with love hurt feelings and all I got to say  
I want to pass it around  
In view of all thats been goin down  
I think Ill go on out and pass it around
