With a simple wave  
Her hand creates my universe  
She spins and dances around the fire  
Eyes search the open road  
Caught up in the sound of  
Transmissions burning down the wire  
We reach out for the sky  
And were never coming down  
We reach out for the sky  
And were never coming down  
Live life in extreme  
Better then any magazine could ever hope to describe  
Ripped we sweat this desert dance baby do your best  
Were on our way to higher consciousness  
We reach out for the sky  
And were never coming down  
Keep reaching keep reaching  
Were never coming down  
High on a million breaths of her  
I surrender to the magic all around me  
We reach out for the sky  
And were never coming down
