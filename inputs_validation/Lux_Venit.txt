Lux venit lux venit  
Lux venit sursum corda  
Lux venit lux venit arise  
Shine for your light has come  
By sword by flame  
In death solemn ages passed  
And voices young  
Grow old weary  
Holding fast  
Hope for the dawning  
  
Lux venit lux venit  
Lux venit sursum corda  
Lux venit lux venit arise  
Shine for your light has come  
  
In grace in might  
The babe lay in stable stark  
Redemptionss light  
Pierces through the shadows dark  
Alleluia  
  
Lux venit lux venit  
Sursum corda  
Lux venit lux venit arise  
Shine for your light has come  
  
Lux venit lux venit  
Lux venit sursum corda  
Lux venit lux venit arise  
Shine for your light has come  
  
Alleluia
