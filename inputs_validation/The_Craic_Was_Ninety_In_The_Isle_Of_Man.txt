Well werent we the rare oul stock  
Spent the evenin gettin locked  
Up in the ace o hearts  
Where the high stools were engaging  
Over the butt bridge down by the dock  
The boat she sailed at five oclock  
hurry boys now said whack  
or before were there were all be back  
Carry him if you can  
The craic was ninety in the isle of man  
  
Before we reached the alexander base  
The ding dong we did surely raise  
In the bar of the ship we had great sport  
As the boat she sailed out of the port  
Landed up in the douglas head  
Enquired for a vacant bed  
The dining room we soon got shown  
By a decent woman up the road  
lads eat it if ye can  
The craic was ninety in the isle of man  
  
Next morning we went for a ramble round  
Viewed the sights of douglas town  
Then we went for a mighty seisiun  
In a pub they call dick darbys  
We must have been drunk by half past three  
To sober up we went swimmin in the sea  
Back to the digs for the spruce up  
And while waitin for the fry  
We all drew up our plan  
The craic was ninety in the isle of man  
  
That night we went to the texas bar  
Came back down by horse and car  
Met big jim and all went in  
To drink some wine in yales  
The liverpool judies it was said  
Were all to be found in the douglas head  
Mcshane was there in his suit and shirt  
Them foreign girls he was tryin to flirt  
Sayin here girls im your man  
The craic was ninety in the isle of man  
  
Whacker fancied his good looks  
On an isle of man woman he was struck  
And he throwin the jar into her  
Whacker thought hed take a chance  
He asked the quare one out to dance  
Around the floor they stepped it out  
And to whack it was no bother  
Everythin was goin to plan  
The craic was ninety in the isle of man  
  
The isle of man woman fancied whack  
Yer man stood there till his mates came back  
Whack They all whacked into whack  
Whack was landed on his back  
The police force arrived as well  
Banjoed a couple of them as well  
Landed up in the douglas jail  
Until the dublin boat did sail  
Deported every man  
The craic was ninety in the isle of man
