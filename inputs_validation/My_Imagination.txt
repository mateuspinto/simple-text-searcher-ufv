Verse 1  
Ive made them love Ive made them cry  
But now the rain clouds are lonely inside  
They dont know how it feels to know how I feel  
I try to escape from everything that is real  
  
Chorus 1  
Hide in my imagination safe inside my contemplation  
Never out of time somewhere in my mind  
Theres a place where Ill be landing far away from where Im standing  
Day by day creating in my imagination  
  
Verse 2  
The well has run dry of all my ideas  
Silence so loud have to cover my ears  
Im closing the door its hurting too much  
Im runnIng away from everything I can touch  
  
Chorus 2  
To hide in my imagination there is always magic waiting  
Never counting time always on my mind  
Theres a place that only I see far away from all that I see  
Inch by inch creating in my imagination  
  
Verse 3  
I can stop it all from hurting  
With this mind I can stop the world from turning  
Dont know how it feels to know how I feel  
I try to escape from everything that is real  
  
Chorus 1
