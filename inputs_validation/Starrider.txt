I stole a ride on a passing star  
Not knowing where I was going  
How near or how far  
Through years of light lands of future and past  
Until the heavenly gates  
Were sighted at last  
  
Starrider rider rider  
Take me to the stars  
Starrider rider rider  
Show me where you are  
  
Northern lights flashed by  
And then they were gone  
And as old stars would die  
So the new ones were born  
  
And ever on I sailed  
Celestial ways  
And in the light of my years  
Shone the rest of my days  
  
Speed increasing  
All control is in the hands of those who know  
Will they help us grow  
To one day be starriders  
  
Starrider rider rider  
Show me where you are  
Starrider rider rider  
Take me to the stars  
  
Speed increasing  
All control is in the hands of those who know  
Will they help us grow  
To one day be starriders
