Southern man better keep your head  
Dont forget what your good lord said  
Summer chains going to come at last  
Now your crosses are burning fast  
Southern man  
  
See that watermelon  
Smiling through the fence  
I wish that watermelon it was mine  
Sometimes I think that old folks  
Aint got a little sense  
When they leave that watermelon on the vine  
Well apples are sweet and peaches are good  
Rabbits so very very fine  
But give me oh give me  
Oh how I wish you would  
Some of that watermelon smiling on the vine
