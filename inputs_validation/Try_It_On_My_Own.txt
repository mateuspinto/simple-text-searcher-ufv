Im wiser now  
Im not the foolish girl you used to know  
So long ago  
Im stronger now  
Ive learned from my mistakes which way to go  
And I should know  
I put myself aside to do it your way  
But now I need to do it all alone  
  
And I am not afraid to try it on my own  
I dont care if Im right or wrong  
Ill live my life the way I feel  
No matter what Ill keep it real you know  
Time for me to do it on my own  
Yeah yeah mmm yeah yeah  
  
Its over now  
I cant go back to living through your eyes  
Too many lies  
And if you dont know by now  
I cant go back to being someone else  
Not anymore  
I never had a chance to do things my way  
So now its time for me to take control  
  
And I am not afraid to try it on my own  
I dont care if Im right or wrong  
Ill live my life the way I feel  
No matter what Im gonna keep it real you know  
Time for me to do it  
  
Oh I start again go back to one  
Im running things my way  
Cant stop me now Ive just begun  
Dont even think about it  
There aint no way about it  
Im taking names the ones of mine  
Yes Im gonna take my turn  
Its time for me to finally stand alone stand alone  
  
I am not afraid to try it on my own  
And I dont care if Im right or wrong  
Ill live my life the way I feel  
No matter what Im gonna keep it real you know  
Its time for me to do it  
See Im not afraid
