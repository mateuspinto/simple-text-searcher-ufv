Went to my doctor yesterday  
She said I seem to be OK  
She said  
Paul you better look around  
How long you think that you can  
Run that body down  
How many nights you think you can  
Do what you been doin  
Who you foolin  
  
I came back home and I went to bed  
I was resting my head  
My wife came in and she said  
Whats wrong sweet boy whats wrong  
Ah I told her whats wrong  
I said Peg you better look around  
How long you think you can  
Run that body down  
How many nights you think you can  
Do what you been doin  
Now who you foolin  
  
Kid you better look around  
How long you think that you can  
Run that body down  
How many nights you think you can  
Do what you been doin  
Who you foolin
