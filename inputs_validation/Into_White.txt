I built my house from barley rice  
Green pepper walls and water ice  
Tables of paper wood windows of light  
And everything emptying into white  
  
A simple garden with acres of sky  
A Brownhaired dogmouse  
If one dropped by  
Yellow Delanie would sleep well at night  
With everything emptying into white  
  
A sad blue eyed drummer rehearses outside  
A Black spider dancing on top of his eye  
Red legged chicken stands ready to strike  
And everything emptying into white  
  
I built my house from barley rice  
Green pepper walls and water ice  
And everything emptying into white
