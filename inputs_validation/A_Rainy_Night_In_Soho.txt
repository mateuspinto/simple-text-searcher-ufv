Ive been loving you a long time  
Down all the years down all the days  
And Ive cried for all your troubles  
Smiled at your funny little ways  
  
We watched our friends grow up together  
And we saw them as they fell  
Some of them fell into Heaven  
Some of them fell into Hell  
  
I took shelter from a shower  
And I stepped into your arms  
On a rainy night in Soho  
The wind was whistling all its charms  
  
I sang you all my sorrows  
You told me all your joys  
Whatever happened to that old song  
To all those little girls and boys  
  
Sometimes I wake up in the morning  
The ginger lady by my bed  
Covered in a cloak of silence  
I hear you talking in my head  
  
Im not singing for the future  
Im not dreaming of the past  
Im not talking of the first time  
I never think about the last  
  
Now the song is nearly over  
We may never find out what it means  
Still theres a light I hold before me  
Youre the measure of my dreams  
The measure of my dreams
