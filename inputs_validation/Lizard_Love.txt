I was walkin down the street  
When someone called my name  
She had spiked heels on her feet  
And she was feelin no pain  
  
Ohhh must be Lizard Love  
So I hid behind the newspaper  
Turned to page six  
She was in her birthday suit  
Behind a crucifix  
  
Ohhh must be Lizard Love  
She was hangin big booty  
She was puss n boots way up to here  
Shes a little bit of heaven a 247  
A 10 every day of the year  
  
Now there must be some mistake  
Im feelin so high strung  
She said I make love like a snake  
I even got a forked tongue  
  
At first I thought I was dreamin  
That Id wake up and shed disappear  
But when I opened up my eyes  
She was laughing and a screamin swinging from the chandlier  
  
You know I never seem to give  
Or ever get enough  
And I just cant seem to live without  
That sweet bodacious stuff  
  
Ohhh must be Lizard Love
