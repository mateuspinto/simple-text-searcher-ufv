You never know what youve done for me

Youll never know the gift youve given me  
Ill carry it with me yeah yeah  
Through the days ahead Ill think of days before  
And you make me hope for something better and made me reach for something more  
  
You taught me to run you taught me to fly  
Helped me to free the me inside  
Helped me hear the music of my heart  
Helped me hear the music of my heart  
  
You opened my eyes  
You opened the door  
To something Ive never known before  
And your love is the music of my heart  
  
You were the one always on my side always on my side  
Always standin by always standin by  
Seein me through  
You were the song that always made me sing  
Im singin this for you  
Everywhere I go I think of where Ive been  
And of the one who knew me better that anyone ever will again  
  
You taught me to run you taught me to fly  
Helped me to free the me inside

Helped me hear the music of my heart  
  
You opened my eyes

To something Ive never known before  
And your love is the music of my heart  
  
What you taught me only your love could ever teach me  
You got through when could reach me before  
Cause you always saw in me all the best that I could be  
It was you who set me freeeeeee
