Now that you are here with me  
Baby lets do it right  
Lady you know just what I mean  
I want to hold you oh so tight  
  
Baby just touch me anywhere  
Cutie you turn me on oh baby  
I like to run my fingers through your hair  
So come on and stay with me all night  
  
I want to rock witcha baby  
All night long  
I want to roll witcha lady  
The feeling so strong  
  
I want to rock witcha lady  
All night long  
Rock n roll n roll n rock  
Makin sweet lovin dont you ever stop
