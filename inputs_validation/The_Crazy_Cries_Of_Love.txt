It was a dark and a stormy night  
Everyone was at the wingding  
They werent the wingding type  
So they went up on the train bridge  
Where the weather was howling  
And oh oh my my  
When that train comes rolling by  
No paper thin walls no folks above  
No one else can hear  
The crazy cries of love  
  
They were laughing they were dancing in the rain  
They knew their love was a strong one  
When they heard the far off whistle of a train  
They were hoping it was going to be a long one  
cause oh oh my my  
When that train comes rolling by  
No paper thin walls no folks above  
No one else can hear  
The crazy cries of love  
  
In the back booth of an all night cafe  
Two dripping raincoats are hanging  
Outside in the weather  
The shade on the streetlight is clanging  
And they smile ear to ear and eye to eye  
Ice cream is melting on a piece of pie  
Oh my my  
No one else can hear  
The cries of love  
  
Every kiss was sweet and strong  
Every touch was totally tandem  
As the train come arumbling along  
They sang a lovers song of wild abandon  
And oh oh my my  
When that train comes rolling by  
No paper thin walls no folks above  
No one else can hear  
The crazy cries of love  
No paper thin walls no folks above  
No one else can hear  
The crazy cries of love
