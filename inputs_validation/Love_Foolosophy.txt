Baby baby I feel this sweet sensation  
Honey Honey looks like a superstar  
Shes got a promise of lovestruck fascination  
  
What am I to do  
How am I to know  
Who are you She shimmers  
Like a california sunset  
Honey honey glitters but  
Theres no gold she carries  
Sweetly infectious magic  
Formulas so delerious  
Is she that serious Is she bringing me on  
Ive been waiting so long  
  
And this love fool osophy  
Is killing previous illusions that I had in my mind  
About you seems so true  
All the lies your telling tragically compelling  
And my love means nothing to you so  
Maybe Im still a love fool  
I dont want to be a love fool  
I dont want the world  
I want you
