Theres no power capable of  
Coming between usdividing our love  
To be faithful I have sworn  
Together we can weather the storm  
  
Our tomorrows are ticking away  
Our hands are tiedwere victims of fate  
In my darkness I will pray  
For destiny to send me your way  
  
Love make me strong  
Give me the strength to carry on  
Love make me strong  
A tower of strength to lean upon  
  
Love make me strong  
The seven seas wont keep us apart  
Not with an ocean of love in my heart  
My devotion will see me through  
  
Cause nothings gonna keep me from you  
Love make me strong  
Give me the strength to carry on  
Love make me strong  
  
A tower of strength to lean upon  
Love make me strong  
Oh its a sad sad story  
True lovers forced to part  
  
Shot down in all its glory  
Youll hear the sound of broken hearts  
My devotion will see me through  
Cause nothings gonna keep me from you  
  
Love make me strong  
Give me the strength to carry on  
Love make me strong  
A tower of strength to lean upon  
  
Love make me strong  
Oh oh love make me strong  
Love make me strong make me strong  
Love make me strong
