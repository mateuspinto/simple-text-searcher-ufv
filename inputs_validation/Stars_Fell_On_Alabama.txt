We lived our little drama we kissed in a field of white  
And stars fell on Alabama that night  
I cant forget the glamour your eyes held a tender light  
And stars fell on Alabama last night  
  
I never planned in my imagination  
A situation so heavenly  
A fairy land that no one else could enter  
And in the center just you and me dear  
  
My heart beat like a hammer my arms wound around you tight  
And stars fell on Alabama last night  
  
I never planned in my imagination  
A situation so heavenly  
A fairy land that no one else could enter  
And in the center just you and me dear  
  
My heart beat like a hammer my arms wound around you tight  
Ah stars fell on Alabama last night
