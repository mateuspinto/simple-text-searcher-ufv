The first time I looked in your eyes I knew  
That I would do anything for you  
The first time you touched my face I felt  
What Id never felt with anyone else  
  
I want to give back what youve given to me  
And I want to witness all of your dreams  
Now that youve shown me who I really am  
I want to be more than just your man  
  
I want to be the wind that fills your sails  
And be the hand that lifts your veil  
And be the moon that moves your tide  
The sun coming up in your eyes  
Be the wheel that never rusts  
And be the spark that lights you up  
All that youve been dreaming of and more so much more  
I want to be your everything  
  
When you wake up Ill be the first thing you see  
And when it gets dark you can reach out to me  
Ill cherish your words and Ill finish your thoughts  
Ill be your compass baby when you get lost  
  
I want to be the wind that fills your sails  
Be the hand that lifts your veil  
Be the moon that moves your tide  
The sun coming up in your eyes  
Be the wheel that never rusts  
And be the spark that lights you up  
All that youve been dreaming of and more so much more  
I want to be your everything  
  
Ill be the wheel that never rusts  
And be the spark that lights you up  
All that youve been dreaming of and more so much more  
I want to be your everything  
I want to be your everything  
I want to be your everything I want to be your everything
