Lying in the gloom  
Of my lonely room  
Thinking of how to reach you  
Dreaming of having you  
I believe in dreams  
And I believe in miracles  
I believe the toy balloons  
Can reach the moon  
I dont have the courage and the will  
To say the words  
But I cant feel of whats inside me is for real  
Oh and I know someday  
Ill have the chance to prove and say  
Three simple words would come your way  
I know I have the chance someday  
Coz I believe in dreams  
And I believe in miracles  
I believe the toy balloons  
Can reach the moon  
I dont have the courage and the will  
To say the words  
But I cant feel of whats inside me is for real  
Oh and I know someday  
Ill have the chance to prove and say  
Three simple words would come your way  
I know I have the chance someday  
The chance for me to say  
That I love you  
Oh I love you  
Yes I love you  
Oh I love you  
I believe in dreams  
I believe my dreams would all come true  
I believe it will all come true  
Ooh I believe  
I believe it will all come true  
Ohh I believe  
I believe it will all come true  
Ooh I have faith to believe in dreams  
I believe it will all come true
