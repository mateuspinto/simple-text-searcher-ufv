The lives were taken  
For feasts at the table  
A life of misery  
Ending with a shock  
  
Brutal murder brutal murder  
All hands to the slaughter  
Mass torture  
All hands to the knife  
  
And I can hear the screams  
With the knife the jolt the wring  
They must follow in our dreams  
Carrying a twisted sting  
  
Childrens stories with their farmyard favourites  
At the table in a different disguise  
  
Dont talk to me of health  
Or something someone else will do  
Were talking about the act  
Of taking life for me and you  
And I hear their screams
