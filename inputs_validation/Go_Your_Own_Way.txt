Recorded by Fleetwood Mac  
Loving you  
Isnt the right thing to do  
How can I ever change things  
That I feel  
If I could  
Maybe Id give you my world  
How can I  
When you wont take it from me  
You can go your own way  
Go your own way  
You can call it  
Another lonely day  
You can go your own way  
Go your own way  
Tell me why  
Everything turned around  
Packing up  
Shacking up is all you wanna do  
If I could  
Baby Id give you my world  
Open up  
Everythings waiting for you  
You can go your own way  
Go your own way  
You can call it  
Another lonely day  
You can go your own way  
go your own way  
Instrumental solo  
You can go your own way  
Go your own way  
You can call it another lonely day  
Another lonely day  
You can go your own way  
Go your own way  
You can call it another lonely day  
Instrumental solo  
You can go your own way  
You can call it another lonely day  
You can go your own way  
You can call it fade out
