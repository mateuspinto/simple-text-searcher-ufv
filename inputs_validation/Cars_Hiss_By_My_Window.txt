The cars hiss by my window  
Like the waves down on the beach  
The cars hiss by my window  
Like the waves down on the beach  
I got this girl beside me  
But shes out of reach  
  
Headlight through my window  
Shinin on the wall  
Headlight through my window  
Shinin on the wall  
Cant hear my baby  
Though I called and called  
  
Yeah right  
Woo  
  
Windows started tremblin  
With a sonic boom  
Windows started tremblin  
With a sonic boom boom  
A call girl will kill you  
In a darkened room  
  
Yeah woo  
Ride  
Ride on  
Weooooo  
Wawa eooo  
Oooo owa owaaa  
Wa waaaaea  
Ooo wa wa wa wa waa
