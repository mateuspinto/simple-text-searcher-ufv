Berry  
  
Im gonna search this town  
From door to door  
The love I crave  
I cant find no more  
  
I got to find my baby  
I declare there aint no lie  
I aint had no real good loving  
Since that woman said goodbye  
  
You know I hate to see the sun  
Sinking to the west  
cause I know my whole lifes  
Gonna be one solid mess  
  
I got to find my baby  
I declare there aint no lie  
I aint had no real good loving  
Since that woman said goodbye  
  
Well ever since the day  
That she said we were through  
Ive been nervous  
And shook up too  
  
I got to find my baby  
I declare there aint no lie  
I aint had no real good loving  
Since that woman said goodbye  
  
Well I dont care if the last thing  
I ever done in my life  
Is to find that little woman  
Make her my wife  
  
I got to find my baby  
I declare there aint no lie  
I aint had no real good loving  
Since that woman said goodbye
