Stand at the window  
Pull back the lace  
I feel the night wind on my face  
All that I long for  all that I crave  
Am I master Am I slave  
The nights so still  
I feel the lovers out in the hills  
The breathing of young girls lying in bed  
Visions of love in their heads  
Desire walks on  
Desire walks on  
A beautiful boy gazed in a pool  
His eyes looking back like jewels  
The call of the mirror  too strong to resist  
The call of the water  the call of a kiss  
Desire walks on  
Desire walks on  
It wants to be held  possessed  
It wants consummation  
It moves on obsessed  
Bloodstream through pipes  
Singing in the wires  
Heat  motion  control  
Desire walks on  
Stand at the window  
The world is so still  
Calling you back by force of will  
Where did you go  
I dont know why  
Too much longing inside  
You wrapped me in nighttime sexual disguise  
I was the love in your eyes  
You took me over  
My innocence cracked  
You own my passion  
I want you back  
Desire walks on  
Desire walks on
