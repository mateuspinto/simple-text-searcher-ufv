This is the place where she lay her head  
When she went to bed at night  
And this is the place our children were conceived  
Candles lit the room at night  
  
And this is the place where she cut her wrists  
That odd and fateful night  
And I said oh oh oh oh oh oh what a feeling  
And I said oh oh oh oh oh oh what a feeling  
  
This is the place where we used to live  
I paid for it with love and blood  
And these are the boxes that she kept on the shelf  
Filled with her poetry and stuff  
  
And this is the room where she took the razor  
And cut her wrists that strange and fateful night  
And I said oh oh oh oh oh oh what a feeling  
And I said oh oh oh oh oh oh what a feeling  
  
I never would have started if Id known  
That itd end this way  
But funny thing Im not at all sad  
That it stopped this way  
Stopped this way
