Na na na na na  
Na na na na na  
Im with you always youre ever on my mind  
In a light to last a whole life through  
Each way I turn the sense of you  
Surrounds in every step I take in all I do  
Your thoughts your schemes  
Captivate my dreams  
Everlasting ever new  
Sea returns to sea  
And sky to sky  
In a life of dream am I  
When Im with you  
Deep in my heart how the presence of you shines  
In a light to last a whole life through  
I recall the wonder of it all  
Each dream of life Ill share with you  
Sea returns to sea  
And sky to sky  
In a life of dream am I  
When Im with you  
Im with you always youre ever on my mind  
In a light to last a whole life through  
The hand above turns those leaves of love  
All and all a timeless view  
Each dream of life  
Flung from paradise  
Everlasting ever new  
Dream of life  
Dream of life  
Na na na na na
