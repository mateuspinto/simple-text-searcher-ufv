From the top of the hill  
You can see all the lights of the Diamond Field  
The treasure buried in plain sight  
Where one mans loss is another mans gain  
And no one cares about anything worth caring about  
  
Shall we go to the Diamond Field tonight  
Tightrope walkin in the web of light  
Shall we go the Diamond Field and try  
To seek the fortune in their eyes  
  
One by one the lights go out  
And the Diamond Field begins to fade  
  
It turns back into cement and stone  
Brick and asphalt flesh and bone  
  
Shall we go to the Diamond Field tonight  
Tightrope walkin in the web of light  
Shall we go the Diamond Field and try  
To seek the fortune in their eyes  
  
Shall we go to the Diamond Field tonight  
Tightrope walkin in the web of light  
Electric angles move against the night  
Shining in the Diamond Field
