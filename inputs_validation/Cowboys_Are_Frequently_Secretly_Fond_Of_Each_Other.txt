Cowboys Are Frequently Secretly Fond of Each Other  
Well theres many a strange impulse out on the plains of West Texas  
Theres many a young boy who feels things he cant comprehend  
And a small town dont like it when somebody falls between sexes  
No a small town dont like it when a cowboy has feelings for men  
And I believe to my soul that inside every man theres the feminine  
And inside every lady theres a deep manly voice loud and clear  
Well a cowboy may brag about things that hes done with his women  
But the ones who brag loudest are the ones that are most likely queer  
Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other  
Say what do you think all them saddles and boots was about  
And theres many a cowboy who dont understand the way that he feels for his
brother  
And inside every cowboy theres a lady thatd love to slip out  
And theres always somebody who says what the others just whisper  
And mostly that someones the first one to get shot down dead  
So when you talk to a cowboy dont treat him like he was a sister  
You cant fuck with a lady thats sleepin in each cowboys head  
Cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other  
What did you think all them saddles and boots was about  
And theres many a cowboy who dont understand the way that he feels for his
brother  
And inside every lady theres a cowboy who wants to come out  
And inside every cowboy theres a lady thatd love to slip out
