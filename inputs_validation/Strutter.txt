I know a thing or two about her  
I know shell only make you cry  
Shell let you walk the street beside her  
But when she wants shell pass you by  
  
Everybody says shes lookin good  
And the lady knows its understood  
Strutter  
  
She wears her satins like a lady  
She gets her way just like a child  
You take her home and she saysm Maybe baby  
She takes you down and drives you wild  
  
Everybody says shes lookin good  
And the lady knows its understood  
Strutter
