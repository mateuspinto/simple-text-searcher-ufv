Well everytime I try to love another  
I never know exactly what to do  
Id like to tell her just how much I want her  
And I could find the way if she were you  
Her eyes may shine for me and not another  
Her lonely arms reach out to hold me too  
She wants to take your place and be my lover  
And I could make her mine if she were you  
I never knew how much I cared about you  
Till your memory made me a lovesick fool  
When she speaks to me I hear you sweet voice calling  
When I close my eyes your face comes into view  
I remember how it hurt when I was falling  
And I could fall again if she were you  
I never knew how much I cared about you  
Till your memory made me a lovesick fool  
She wants to take your place and be my lover  
And I could make her mine if she were you  
Yes I could make her mine if she was you
