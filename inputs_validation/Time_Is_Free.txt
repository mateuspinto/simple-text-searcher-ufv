You recall the day when everybody stopped to see  
The blazing sun  
Did you really see the way they all looked up and asked that question  
Why  
  
Boom boom bang bang look out here it comes again  
Cant stop the way it flows  
It never knows  
Why it goes  
Time is free  
Time is free  
  
You been known to take the time to look and want  
You been known to take the time to stop the want  
Thats the place where we all go  
I dont know why we do it  
Never any reason to be not free  
Play a little music  
  
You recall the day when everybody stoped to see  
The blazing sun  
Did you really see the way they all looked up and asked that question  
Why  
  
Boom boom bang bang look out here it comes again  
Cant stop the way it flows  
It never knows  
Why it goes  
Time is free  
Time is free  
Time is  
Time is free
