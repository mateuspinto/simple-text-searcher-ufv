Robert was a sailor  
For the best years of his life  
His captain was his mother  
And the ocean was his wife  
Only fresh out of the cradle  
Lifes one and only spring  
He was sworn to do his duty  
And got blood on his high school ring  
Chorus  
And its hello California  
Hello Dad and Mom  
Ship ahoy  
Your baby boy  
Is home from Vietnam  
Dont you ask me any questions  
Bout the medals on my chest  
Take the star out of the window  
And let my conscience take a rest  
Now he sailed across the ocean  
To the old far eastern war  
And it was foreign to his body  
It was foreign to his shore  
So he traded in the present  
For the better times hed seen  
And made an oriental waitress  
His own home comin queen  
Chorus
