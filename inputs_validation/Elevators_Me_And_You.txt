One for the money yes sir two for the show  
A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe  
Was the start of something good  
Where me and my nigga rode the Marta through the hood  
Just tryna find that hook up now everyday we looked up at the ceiling  
Watching ceiling fans go round tryna catch that feeling  
Off instrumentals had my pencil and plus my paper  
We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur  
Writing rhymes tryna find our spot off in that light  
Light off in that spot knowing that we could rock  
Doing the hole in the wall clubs this shit here must stop like Freeze  
We making the crowd move but we not making no Gs and thats a nono  
  
Check it a onetwo a onetwo dope niggas in the Cadillac  
They call us went from Players Ball to ballers  
Putting the South up on the map was like Little Rock to banging  
Niggas say mothafuck that playing they paying we staying laying vocals  
Locales done made it with them big boys up in this industry  
OutKast yeah them niggas they making big noise  
Over a million sold to this day niggas they take it lightly  
96 gon be that year that all yall playa haters can bite me Im out this
bitch  
  
Me and you  
Your momma and your cousin too  
Rolling down the strip on Vogues  
Coming up slamming Cadillac doors  
Me and you  
Your momma and your cousin too  
Rolling down the strip on Vogues  
Coming up slamming Cadillac doors  
  
Back in the day when I was younger hunger  
Looking to fill me belly with that Rallys bullshit  
Pull shit off like it was supposed to be pulled  
Full as a tick I was stoned like them white boys  
Smoking them white girls before them blunts got crunk chunky asses  
Passes getting thrown like Hail Marys and they looking like Halle Berrys  
So so fine intertwined but we aint sipping wine  
Wes just chilling Im the rabid villain and Im so high  
Smoking freely me Lil B Reek Mone and Shug  
And my little brother James thangs changed in the hood  
Where I live at them rats know Momma I want to sing  
But momma I want to trick and momma Im sucking dick now  
We moving on up in the world like elevators  
Me and the crew we pimps like 82 me and you like Tony Toni Tone  
Like this East Point and we gone  
  
Me and you  
Your momma and your cousin too  
Rolling down the strip on Vogues  
Coming up slamming Cadillac doors  
Me and you  
Your momma and your cousin too  
Rolling down the strip on Vogues  
Coming up slamming Cadillac doors  
  
Got stopped at the mall the other day heard a call from the other way  
That I just came from some nigga was saying something talking bout  
Smoke something Hey man you remember me from school  
No not really But he kept smiling like a clown facial expression looking
silly  
And he kept asking me What kinda car you drive I know you paid  
I know yall got beaucoup of hoes from all them songs that yall done made  
And I replied that I had been going through the same things that he had  
True Ive got more fans than the average man but not enough loot to last me  
To the end of the week I live by the beat like you live checktocheck  
If you dont move your feet then I dont eat so we like necktoneck  
Yes we done come a long way like them slimass cigarettes  
From Virginia this aint gon stop so we just gon continue  
  
Me and you  
Your momma and your cousin too  
Rolling down the strip on Vogues  
Coming up slamming Cadillac doors  
Me and you  
Your momma and your cousin too  
Rolling down the strip on Vogues  
Coming up slamming Cadillac doors
