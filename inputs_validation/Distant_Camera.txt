The flash from a distant camera  
Reconnecting thoughts and actions  
Fragments of our missing dream  
Pieces from here and there  
Fall in place along the line  
Disappearing between you and me  
  
Life is changing everywhere I go  
New things and old both disappear  
If life is a photograph fading in the mirror  
All I want is a song of love  
Song of love to sing for you  
All I need is this song of love  
To sing for you  
  
On the floor where daylight dances  
With the ones that missed their chances  
When they couldnt let it show  
Lies the land of sweet surrender  
Like a dream it might have ended there  
But we didnt even know  
  
Now forever we will live as one  
Floating in loves atmosphere  
If love is a piece of dust shining in the sun  
All I want is a song of love  
Song of love to sing to you  
All I need is this song for love  
To sing for you  
  
Song of love  
Song of love
