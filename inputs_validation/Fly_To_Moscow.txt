Fly to Moscow and land on the Red Square  
  
Fly to Moscow and land there if you dare  
  
Modern rebel Mr Rust he showed the world Moscow or bust  
  
Flying in red barons shoes zigzag course  
That leaves no clues  
The Kremlin says this cant be true  
  
Heads will roll cause this wont do  
  
Reuther  
Tass and cbs said this story is the best  
  
Fly to Moscow and land on the Red Square  
  
Fly to Moscow and land there if you dare  
  
Noone saw him on the screen  
  
cause he kept his nose down  
Kept it clean  
  
Flying solo in his Cessna Mr Rust beat Russion radar  
Uncle Sam and Pentagon they couldnt do what he has done  
  
Gorbachev he had no laughs when Mr Rust signed autographs  
  
Fly to Moscow and land on the Red Square  
  
Fly to Moscow and land there if you dare  
  
The people rolled their eyes  
And said the flag was black and gold and red  
  
The kgb took the plane away but some photos went astray  
And the news went out around the world  
  
The story soon become unfurled  
  
The new born hero from the west came down  
To earth and pass the test  
  
Fly to Moscow and land on the Red Square  
  
Fly to Moscow and land there if you dare  
Fly to Moscow and land on the Red Square  
  
Fly to Moscow and land there if you dare Fly to Moscow
