They pay me not to come home  
Keeping me stoned  
I wont run away  
They say its easy to get  
Stuck in this town  
Just like Joan  
  
You know I gave it all up for the stage  
They fill my cup up in the cage  
Its nobodys business but mine when Im low  
To hold yourself up is not a crime here you know  
At the end of the world  
  
I kick my foot at the lights  
I breathe it in all night  
Theres a light on a canvas tree  
Money from home supporting me  
  
They pay me not to come home  
I wont eat crow  
Ill stay away  
And though all roads will not lead you home my girl  
All roads lead to the end of the world  
  
And I sewed a little luck up in the hem of my gown  
The only way down from the gallows is to swing  
And Ill wear boots instead of high heels  
And the next stage that I am on it will have wheels
