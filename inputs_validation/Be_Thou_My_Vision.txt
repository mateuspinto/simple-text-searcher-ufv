Be Thou my vision oh Lord of my heart  
Naught be all else to me save that Thou art  
Thou my best thought by day or by night  
Waking or sleeping Thy presence my light  
  
Be Thou my wisdom and Thou my true word  
I ever with Thee and Thou with me Lord  
Thou my great Father I Thy true son  
Thou in me dwelling and I with Thee one  
  
High King of Heaven my victory won  
May I reach heavens joys oh bright heavens sun  
Heart of my own heart whatever befall  
Still be my vision oh Ruler of all  
  
Thou and Thou only first in my heart  
High King of Heaven my treasure Thou art
