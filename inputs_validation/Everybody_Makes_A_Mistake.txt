Out in the street  
Playin all night long  
While the one that loved me  
Man she was sitting at home  
Oh I didnt worry I was a fool  
Playing the field  
And running around having fun man  
I know everybody make a mistake sometime  
But when I got home  
My baby she was gone  
And I found her letter lying  
Right there on the kitchen floor  
It read I tried to wait  
For you to come honey  
But like a fool  
You were running around doing me wrong  
Im sorry I know baby  
Everybody make a mistake sometime  
I know I made one  
And oh so if you are running around  
With somebody else  
Tryin to satisfy  
Man you cant satisfy you selfish self  
So man you gotta take heed  
Listen to every word Im saying  
Cause that same thing man  
Might happen to you one day  
And you know that everybody  
Man I know that everybody  
Make a mistake sometime  
I know because I made mine  
I made a great big one  
Man I made mine  
I made a great big one  
And I cant do it no more  
No Im never gonna do it  
I want you to come back to me baby
