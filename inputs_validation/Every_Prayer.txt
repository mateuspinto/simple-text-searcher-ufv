I heard em say He brought me from a mighty long way  
And now today I can testify that I believe it  
And on my way I realized Hes the one who kept me  
When the storms of life arise sleepless nights and desperate cries  
He has captured every tear assuring me He hears  
  
Every prayer waiting on the answer only to discover He is near  
And He hears every prayer for He has done great things  
And I believe Hes a God that always answers prayer  
  
I heard em say the prayers of the righteous availeth much  
And now today I can testify that I believe it  
Now on my way I wanna let you know that He will keep you  
When the storms of life arise sleepless nights and desperate cries  
Hes captured every tear assuring me that He hears  
  
Every prayer waiting on the answer only to discover He is near  
And He hears every prayer for He has done great things  
I believe Hes a God that always answers prayer  
  
Dont despise the tears youve cried  
Or the prayers that you have prayed  
Heaven heard your every word  
And the answer the answers on the way  
  
I heard em say there is an answer on the way  
My God has done so many great things great things  
Hold on and you will see there is an answer on the way  
My God has done so many great things great things
