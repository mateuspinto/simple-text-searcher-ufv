Asylums with doors open wide  
Where people had paid to see inside  
For entertainment they watch his body twist  
Behind his eyes he says I still exist  
  
This is the way step inside  
This is the way step inside  
This is the way step inside  
This is the way step inside  
  
In arenas he kills for a prize  
Wins a minute to add to his life  
But the sickness is drowned by cries for more  
Pray to God make it quick watch him fall  
  
This is the way step inside  
This is the way step inside  
This is the way step inside  
This is the way step inside  
  
This is the way  
This is the way  
This is the way  
This is the way  
This is the way step inside  
This is the way step inside  
This is the way step inside  
This is the way step inside  
  
Youll see the horrors of a faraway place  
Meet the architects of law face to face  
See mass murder on a scale youve never seen  
And all the ones who try hard to succeed  
  
This is the way step inside  
This is the way step inside  
This is the way step inside  
This is the way step inside  
  
And I picked on the whims of a thousand or more  
Still pursuing the path thats been buried for years  
All the dead wood from jungles and cities on fire  
Cant replace or relate cant release or repair  
Take my hand and Ill show you what was and will be
