She use to be my rosa amarilla  
My little Mexicali tomatilla  
But then one night I drank too much sangria  
Woke up and found a note that said Ill see ya  
  
Chorus  
Oh my baby no esta aqui no more  
My baby no esta aqui no more  
She left me here with nada  
Broke my heart like a pinata  
My baby no esta aqui no more  
  
Whoa whoa whoa if you see her  
Please please tell her that I need her  
  
I used to be her number one vaquero  
Her numero uno caballero  
But Ive had to hock my spurs and my sombrero  
Cause when she left she took all my dinero  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Whoa whoa whoa if you see her  
Please please tell her that I need her  
  
Oh my baby no esta aqui no more  
My baby no esta aqui no more  
she left me here with nada  
Broke my heart like a pinata  
My baby no esta aqui  
My baby no esta aqui  
My baby no esta aqui no more
