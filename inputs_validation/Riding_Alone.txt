Well she saved him from whiskey  
Was his constant companion  
Youd see them out riding at dawn  
  
She gave him his reasons  
To shoulder the seasons  
But now when you see him  
Hes riding alone  
  
She lay down beside him  
To touch him and guide him  
Turn round his head  
On the darkest of days  
  
He still sits beside her  
Remembers her smiling  
And whisper to him  
That old song he would play  
  
Please lay down beside me  
I love you  
  
Never wanted to bid this adieu  
No red river ever ran deeper  
Than an old cowboy love  
Than an old cowboy love that runs true
