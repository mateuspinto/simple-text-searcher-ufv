Brooklyn  
Child of freedom still new to this world  
Brooklyn  
Summer magic my sweet baby sweet girl  
  
All the waiting all the praying  
Brought the answer to all of the love weve been saving  
All the hoping all the needing  
Turned the dream of a vision into a real thing  
Mamas happy  
  
Brooklyn  
Child of rhythm riding on a moonlit star  
Brooklyn  
Pretty daughter born with a smile  
  
Daddy felt you fore he saw you  
Mommy carried you so long  
Mimi saw you fore she felt you  
Four is a family so strong  
My baby  
  
Brooklyn  
Child of children LA is your home  
Brooklyn  
Sweetest princess well grow as you go  
  
All the waiting all the praying  
Brought the answer to all of the love weve been saving  
All the hoping all the needing  
Turned the dream of a vision into the real thing  
  
Brooklyn  
Child of music your song is of love  
Brooklyn  
Came together and I thank God above  
  
Brooklyn  
Child of freedom  
Baby your daddys so proud of you
