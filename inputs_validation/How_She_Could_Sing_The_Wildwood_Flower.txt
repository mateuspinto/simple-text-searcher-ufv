Chorus   
How she could sing the Wildwood Flower  
The orphan girl he would love so long  
In the end he knew shed been his finest hour  
And all he has left of her is a song  
  
He first saw her  
Standing by a cabin door  
Her song was ringing  
Out in a voice so strong and sure  
To the lonesome valley  
He bring her there to be his bride  
Where they would live and work together  
Side by side  
  
She was his sunshine  
She was his moon and morning star  
His words would ring to  
The chords of her guitar  
  
He was driven  
And lost to her for days and days  
Til the lonesome valley  
Finally drove her far away  
  
Chorus   
  
We all cling to  
As the years keep rolling on  
One single promise  
Of a love thats past and gone  
And that lonesome valley  
We all walk it by ourselves  
With the wildwood flower  
Is a story we will tell  
  
Chorus   
  
How she could sing the Wildwood Flower  
And all we have left of her is a song
