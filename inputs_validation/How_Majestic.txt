Without a word  
The mountains speak  
The song that all creation sings  
The painted skies  
The sun and stars  
The Heavens tell how great You are  
The Heavens tell how great You are  
  
How majestic is Your name  
How majestic is Your name  
Jesus wonderful powerful  
Youre the Lord of all  
How majestic is Your name  
  
A rugged cross  
A humble King  
How beautiful the mystery  
That love would bleed from majesty  
  
All rise all rise in highest praise  
Your name will reign through all eternity  
Our hope our strength our victory  
We bow down down at Your feet
