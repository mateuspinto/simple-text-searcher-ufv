Off the rails I was and  
Off the rails  
I was happy to stay  
Get out of my way  
On the rack I was  
Easy meat and a reasonably good buy  
A reasonably good buy  
  
The Piccadilly Palare  
Was just silly slang  
Between me and the boys in my gang  
So bona to vada oh you  
Your lovely eek and  
Your lovely riah  
  
We plied an ancient trade  
Where we threw all lifes  
Instructions away  
Exchanging lies and digs my way  
Cause in a belted coat  
Oh I secretly knew  
That I hadnt a clue  
  
No no No no no You cant get there that way Follow me  
  
The Piccadilly Palare  
Was just silly slang  
Between me and the boys in my gang  
Exchanging Palare  
You wouldnt understand  
Good sons like you  
Never do  
  
So why do you smile  
When you think about earls court   
But you cry when you think of all  
The battles youve fought and lost   
It may all end tomorrow  
Or it could go on forever  
In which case Im doomed  
It could go on forever  
In which case Im doomed  
  
Bona drag
