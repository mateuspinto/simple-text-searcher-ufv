When I am lost  
You shine a light for me and set me free  
When I am low  
You wash away my tears  
And take me through  
  
The loneliness  
And emptiness  
Through the darkest night  
Somehow I survive  
Through it all  
  
When you tell me Im the only one you need  
Sweet and tenderly  
And your love  
Breaks away the clouds surrounding me  
All I have I want to give to thee  
  
If I should fall  
Your love is strong enough to life me up  
If Im afraid  
You chase away my fears  
And take me to  
  
A brighter place  
Beyond the rain  
And I feel alright  
Because youre by my side  
Through it all  
  
When you tell me Im the only one you need  
Sweet and tenderly  
And your love  
Breaks away the clouds surrounding me  
All I have I want to give to thee  
  
You take me through  
The loneliness and emptiness  
And I feel alright  
Cause youre by my side  
  
Through it all  
You tell me Im the only one you need  
Sweet and tenderly  
And your love  
Just breaks away the clouds surrounding me  
And baby all I have I want to give to thee  
  
Want to give you all of my love  
Now and forever my love  
All I have I want to give to thee
