Momma loves her baby  
And daddy loves you too  
And the sea may look warm to you babe  
And the sky may look blue  
Ooooh baby  
Ooooh baby blue  
Oooooh babe  
  
If you should go skating  
On the thin ice of modern life  
Dragging behind you the silent reproach  
Of a million tearstained eyes  
Dont be surprised when a crack in the ice  
Appears under your feet  
You slip out of your depth and out of your mind  
With your fear flowing out behind you  
As you claw the thin ice
