Welcome this is a farmhouse  
We have cluster flies alas  
And this time of year is bad  
  
We are so very sorry  
There is little we can do  
But swat them  
  
She didnt beg oh not enough  
She didnt stay when things got rough  
I told a lie and she got mad  
She wasnt there when things got bad  
  
I never ever saw the Northern Lights  
This is a farmhouse  
I never really heard of cluster flies  
Cluster flies alas  
I never ever saw the stars so bright  
This is a farmhouse  
In the Farmhouse it will be alright  
Cluster flies alas  
  
Brought this one to the stinging lash  
Every man rise from the ash  
Each betrayal begins with trust  
Every man returns to dust  
  
I never ever saw the Northern Lights  
This is a farmhouse  
I never ever heard a cluster fly  
Cluster flies alas  
I never ever saw the stars so bright  
This is a farmhouse  
In the promise that youll be all right  
Cluster flies alas
