If not now then when  
If now today then  
Why make your promises  
A love declared for days to come  
Is as good as none  
  
You can wait til morning comes  
You can wait for the new day  
You can wait and lose this heart  
You can wait and soon be sorry  
  
Now loves the only thing thats free  
We must take it where its found  
Pretty soon it may be costly  
  
If now now what then  
We all must live our lives  
Always feeling  
Always thinking  
The moment has arrived
