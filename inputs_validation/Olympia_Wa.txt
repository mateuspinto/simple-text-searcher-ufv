Hangin out with Lars down on 6th street he knew that I was in trouble  
I was feeling much like the devil  
There was something burnin deep inside of me  
Ran into three Puerto Ricans these girls took us to the fun house  
Where we played a lonely pinball machine  
Hangin on the corner of 52nd and Broadway  
Cars passin by but none of them seem to go my way  
And New York City well I wish I was on a highway  
Back to Olympia  
Im having a hard time understanding it gets all too demanding  
Shes all gone and Im stranded  
Something burning deep inside of me  
All I know its 4oclock and she aint never showed up  
And I watched a thousand people go home from work yeah  
Hangin on the corner of 52nd and Broadway  
Cars passin by but none of them seem to go my way  
And New York City well I wish I was on a highway  
Back to Olympia  
How many times will it take me before I go crazy  
Before I lose everything  
Something burning deep inside of me  
Ran into three Puerto Ricans those girls took us to the fun house  
I dont wanna be alone again  
Hangin on the corner of 52nd and Broadway  
Cars passin by but none of them seem to go my way  
And New York City well I wish I was on a highway  
Back to Olympia
