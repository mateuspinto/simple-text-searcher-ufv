Verse  
She dont really drink much so she say  
But by the way she was putting in the Malibu Reds away  
She was either bout that life  
Tryna front but tryna get right  
Or maybe she work hard everyday at her job  
And she feel like she deserve to turn up tonight  
Either way miss lady bad as a Toblerone sugar rush  
I drew her near whispered in her ear  
I think that Im developing a little crush  
She said Nice try but every short skirt that done walked by has successfully
caught your eye  
No thanks but Im sure that youre a nice guy  
Damn I had no reply cause she was right  
Newly single so Ive been a little thirsty  
She was more than just a booty in a skirt she  
Walked a way I caught up to her in a hurry  
I said Can I at least know your name before your dead me  
She turned around and said My names integrity  
Integrity can you answer this for me

Matter of fact Ill meet you there  
Woah I fell in love

And me babe
