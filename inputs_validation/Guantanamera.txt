The words mean I am a truthful man  
From the land of the palm trees  
And before dying I want to share the poems of my soul  
My poems are soft green  
My poems are also flaming crimson  
My poems are like a wounded fawn  
Seeking refuge in the forest  
The last verse says con los pobres de la tierra  
With the poor people of this earth  
I want to share my fate  
The streams of the mountain  
Pleases me more than the sea
