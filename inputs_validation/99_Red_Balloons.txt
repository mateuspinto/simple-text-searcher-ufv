You and I in a little toy shop  
Buy a bag of balloons with the money weve got  
Set them free at the break of dawn  
Till one by one they were gone  
Back at base bugs in the software  
Flash the message somethings out there  
Floating in the summer sky  
99 red balloons go by  
  
99 red balloons  
Floating in the summer sky  
Panic bells its red alert  
Theres something here from somewhere else  
The war machine springs to life  
Opens up one eager eye  
Focusing it on the sky as 99 red balloons go by  
  
99 Decision street  
99 ministers meet  
To worry worry super scurry  
Call the troops out in a hurry  
This is what weve waited for  
This is it boys this is war  
The president is on the line  
As 99 red balloons go by  
  
99 knights of the air  
Ride super high tech jet fighters  
Everyones a super hero Everyones a Captain Kirk  
With orders to identify  
To clarify and classify  
Scramble in the summer sky  
99 red balloons go by  
  
99 dreams I have had In every one a red balloon  
Its all over and Im standing pretty  
In this dust that was a city  
If I could find a souvenir  
Just to prove the world was here  
And here is a red balloon  
I think of you and let it go
