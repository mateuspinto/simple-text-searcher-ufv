All that glitters  
Is not gold  
So dont believe  
What youve been told  
And take a chance of being strong  
Because theyll destroy you  
If youre wrong  
  
Only lovers act this way  
You see  
Only lovers are so cruel  
  
All your friends are here tonight  
Never ones to miss a fight  
Their applause for what youve done  
Rings in the darkness when theyve gone  
  
Only lovers act this way  
You see  
Only lovers are so cruel  
  
I would die here next to you  
I will make your dreams come true  
Theres so much I had to say  
I got lost along the way  
  
All that glitters is not gold  
So dont believe what youve been told  
  
Only lovers act this way  
You see  
Only lovers are so cruel  
  
Only lovers act this way  
You see  
Only lovers are so cruel
