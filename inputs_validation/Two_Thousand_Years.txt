In the beginning  
There was the cold and the night  
Prophets and angels gave us the fire and the light  
Man was triumphant  
Armed with the faith and the will  
Even the darkest ages couldnt kill  
  
Too many kingdoms  
Too many flags on the field  
So many battles so many wounds to be healed  
Time is relentless  
Only true love perseveres  
Its been a long time and now Im with you  
After two thousand years  
  
This is our moment  
Here at the crossroads of time  
We hope our children carry our dreams down the line  
They are the vintage  
What kind of life will they live  
Is this a curse or a blessing that we give  
  
Sometimes I wonder  
Why are we so blind to fate  
Without compassion there can be no end to hate  
No end to sorrow  
Caused by the same endless fears  
Why cant we learn from all weve been through  
After two thousand years  
  
There will be miracles  
After the last war is won  
Science and poetry rule in the new world to come  
Prophets and angels  
Gave us the power to see  
What an amazing future there will be  
  
And in the evening  
After the fire and the light  
One thing is certain Nothing can hold back the night  
Time is relentless  
And as the past disappears  
Were on the verge of all things new  
We are two thousand years
