Once there was an Inca Queen  
She gazed at her sundial  
All around her workers raised  
Golden idols to her smile  
The waiting years werent hard to see  
Behind the tears of Mercury  
  
She spoke of silver from the sky  
And many floating safety boats  
To pick them up when they would fly  
Far above their dreams and hopes  
And they a mountain city raised  
Where their queen above the clouds  
Could watch out  
  
Inca Queen has  
Inca Queen has  
Inca Queen has come  
Inca Queen has  
Inca Queen has  
Inca Queen has come  
  
Out in the jungle  
The drums were heard  
Inca Queen has come  
From the biggest elephant  
To the smallest bird  
Inca Queen has come  
She spoke of silver from the sky  
Inca Queen has come  
To pick them up when they would fly  
Inca Queen has come  
  
Once there was an Inca Queen  
She gazed at her sundial  
All around her workers raised  
Golden idols to her smile  
And though the air was thin and cold  
Soon the day would come  
The queen had told  
  
Inca Queen has  
Inca Queen has  
Inca Queen has come
