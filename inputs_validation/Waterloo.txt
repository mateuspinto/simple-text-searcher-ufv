My my  
At Waterloo Napoleon did surrender  
Oh yeah  
And I have met my destiny in quite a similiar way  
The history book on the shelf  
Is always repeating itself  
Waterloo  I was defeated you won the war  
Waterloo  Promise to love you for ever more  
Waterloo  Couldnt escape if I wanted to  
Waterloo  Knowing my fate is to be with you  
Waterloo  Finally facing my Waterloo  
  
My my  
I tried to hold you back but you were stronger  
Oh yeah  
And now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight  
And how could I ever refuse  
I feel like I win when I lose  
Waterloo  I was defeated you won the war  
Waterloo  Promise to love you for ever more  
Waterloo  Couldnt escape if I wanted to  
Waterloo  Knowing my fate is to be with you  
Waterloo  Finally facing my Waterloo  
  
So how could I ever refuse  
I feel like I win when I lose  
Waterloo  I was defeated you won the war  
Waterloo  Promise to love you for ever more  
Waterloo  Couldnt escape if I wanted to  
Waterloo  Knowing my fate is to be with you  
Waterloo  Finally facing my Waterloo
