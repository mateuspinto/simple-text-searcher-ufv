Load up on guns and bring your friends  
Its fun to lose and to pretend  
Shes over bored and self assured  
Oh no I know a dirty word  
Hello hello hello how low  
Hello hello hello  
With the lights out its less dangerous  
Here we are now entertain us  
I feel stupid and contagious  
Here we are now entertain us  
A mulatto  
An albino  
A mosquito  
My libido  
Yay  
Im worse at what I do best  
And for this gift I feel blessed  
Our little group has always been  
And always will until the end  
Hello hello hello how low  
Hello hello hello  
With the lights out its less dangerous  
Here we are now entertain us  
I feel stupid and contagious  
Here we are now entertain us  
A mulatto  
An albino  
A mosquito  
My libido  
Yay  
And I forget just why I taste  
Oh yeah I guess it makes me smile  
I found it hard it was hard to find  
Oh well whatever never mind  
Hello hello hello how low  
Hello hello hello  
With the lights out its less dangerous  
Here we are now entertain us  
I feel stupid and contagious  
Here we are now entertain us  
A mulatto  
An albino  
A mosquito  
My libido  
A denial
