There was life here once  
The tension the harshness of life  
Lost in the flow of time  
Now comes crumbling down  
The land will be covered in darkness  
Premonitions of sorrow and anger even so  
  
Things rush on fleeing changing  
Never facing it straight on  
To all things under creation  
Never facing it straight on  
  
Well I know  
Whoa Day the Earth caught on fire  
  
People wander aimlessly  
The great spring of life runs dry  
Come face to face with a world of darkness  
Now comes crumbling down  
The land will be covered in darkness  
Premonitions of sorrow and anger even so  
  
Things rush on fleeing changing  
Never facing it straight on  
To all things under creation  
Never facing it straight on  
  
Well I know  
Whoa Day the Earth caught on fire
