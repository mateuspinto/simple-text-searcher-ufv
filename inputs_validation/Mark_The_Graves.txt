Theres a fragile game you play  
If the ghosts of yesterday  
If we cant let go whenever say goodbye  
No trace of what remains  
No stones to mark the graves  
Only memories we thought we could deny  
  
Theres so much more to lose  
Than the pain I put you through  
And my carelessness that left you in the dark  
And the blood may wash away  
But the skies will never fade  
At least I know somehow I made a mark  
  
In the dark  
In the light  
Nothing left  
Nothing right  
In the dark  
In the light  
Nothing left  
Nothing right  
  
In the dark  
In the light  
Nothing left  
Nothing right  
In the dark  
In the light  
Nothing left  
Nothing right
