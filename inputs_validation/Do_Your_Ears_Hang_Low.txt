Do your ears hang low Do they wobble to and fro  
Can you tie them in a knot Can you tie them in a bow  
Can you throw them oer your shoulder like a Continental Soldier  
Do your ears hang low  
  
Does your tongue hang down Does it flop all around  
Can you tie it in a knot Can you tie it in a bow  
Can you throw it oer your shoulder like a Continental Soldier  
Does your tongue hang down  
  
Does your nose hang low Does it wiggle to and fro  
Can you tie it in a knot Can you tie it in a bow  
Can you throw it oer your shoulder like a Continental Soldier  
Does your nose hang low  
  
Do your eyes pop out Do they bounce all about  
Can you tie them in a knot Can you tie them in a bow  
Can you throw them oer your shoulder like a Continental Soldier  
Do your eyes pop out
