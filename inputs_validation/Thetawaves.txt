The unsettled mind is at times an ally  
Leaving the senses to fend for them selves  
The senses collect undeniable data  
About beta carotene and theta waves  
The unsettled mind is at times an ally  
Leaving the senses to fend for them selves  
Then the senses wanted the sky  
  
All rise I fall  
Time feels like a midnight ride  
Finality waits outside  
Weeping in perplexitys arms  
Caressing our smiles inside  
  
The National debt is at times an ally  
Leaving the senses to fend for them selves  
The senses collect undeniable data  
About high pulse weapons and microwaves  
The National debt is at times an ally  
Leaving the senses to fend for them selves  
Then the people found out the lie  
  
All rise I fall  
Now I rise and then fall  
Time feels like a midnight ride  
Finality waits outside  
Weeping in perplexitys arms  
Caressing our smiles inside  
  
Wanting to get you high  
Wanting to touch the sky  
  
All rise I fall  
Now I rise and then fall  
Time feels like a midnight ride  
Finality waits outside  
Weeping in perplexitys arms  
Caressing our smiles inside
