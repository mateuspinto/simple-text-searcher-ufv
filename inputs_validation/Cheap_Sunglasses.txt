When you get up in the morning and the light is hurt your head  
The first thing you do when you get up out of bed  
Is hit that streets arunnin and try to beat the masses  
And go get yourself some cheap sunglasses  
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah  
  
Spied a little thing and I followed her all night  
In a funky fine levis and her sweaters kind of tight  
She had a west coast strut that was as sweet as molases  
But what really knocked me out was her cheap sunglasses  
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah  
  
solo  
  
Now go out and get yourself some big black frames  
With the glass so dark thay wont even know your name  
And the choice is up to you cause they come in two classes  
Rhinestone shades or cheap sunglasses  
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
