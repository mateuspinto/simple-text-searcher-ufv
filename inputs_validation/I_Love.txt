I love little baby ducks old pickup trucks  
Slowmovin trains and rain  
I love little country streams sleep without dreams  
Sunday school in May and hay  
And I love you too  
  
I love leaves in the wind pictures of my friends  
Birds of the world and squirrels  
I love coffee in a cup little fuzzy pups  
Bourbon in a glass and grass  
And I love you too  
  
I love honest open smiles kisses from a child  
Tomatoes on the vine and onions  
I love winners when they cry losers when they try  
Music when its good and life  
And I love you too
