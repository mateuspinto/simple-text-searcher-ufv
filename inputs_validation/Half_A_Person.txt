Call me morbid call me pale  
Ive spent six years on your trail  
Six long years  
On your trail  
  
Call me morbid call me pale  
Ive spent six years on your trail  
Six full years of my life on your trail  
  
And if you have five seconds to spare  
Then Ill tell you the story of my life  
Sixteen clumsy and shy  
I went to London and I  
I booked myself in at the Y WCA  
I said I like it here  can I stay  
I like it here  can I stay  
Do you have a vacancy  
For a backscrubber  
  
She was left behind and sour  
And she wrote to me equally dour  
She said In the days when you were  
Hopelessly poor  
I just liked you more  
  
And if you have five seconds to spare  
Then Ill tell you the story of my life  
Sixteen clumsy and shy  
I went to London and I  
I booked myself in at the Y WCA  
I said I like it here  can I stay  
I like it here  can I stay  
And do you have a vacancy  
For a backscrubber  
  
Call me morbid call me pale  
Ive spent too long on your trail  
Far too long  
Chasing your tail  
Oh  
  
And if you have five seconds to spare  
Then Ill tell you the story of my life  
Sixteen clumsy and shy  
Thats the story of my life  
Sixteen clumsy and shy  
The story of my life  
Thats the story of my life  
Thats the story of my life  
Thats the story of my life  
The story of my life  
Thats the story of my life  
Thats the story of my life  
Thats the story of my life  
Thats the story of my life  
Thats the story of my life  
Thats the story
