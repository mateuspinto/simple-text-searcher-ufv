Pray for the days of glory  
Long gone the master plan  
Gone is the pride of independence  
Sacrificed like a lamb  
  
Here is the same old story  
Here where the honor ran  
There was a price for the consolation  
Walking in hand in hand  
  
Thy kingdom come he came to fear it  
Hes on the Judas list  
Thy will be done and fondled spirit  
Sees devils in the mist  
  
Give a new resolution  
Give what all I can  
Give me some more of what I can take  
Feed me from your garbage can  
  
Let me have the absolution  
Let me stand like a man  
Let me walk tall with the godforsaken  
Walking out hand in hand  
  
Thy kingdom come he came to fear it  
Hes on the Judas list  
Thy will be done and fondled spirit  
Sees devils in the mist  
  
One more godforsaken  
Tend to make him pay  
A kiss from Judas and temptation  
Sends him on his way  
  
Passes on redemption  
Tend to make him right  
Another kiss of Judas lands  
Before he sees daylight into his night  
  
Hot  
  
One more godforsaken  
Tend to make him pray  
A kiss from Judas and temptation  
As I heard him pray  
  
Thy kingdom come he came to fear it  
Hes on the Jesus list  
Thy will be done and ruined spirit  
Sees devils in the mist  
  
Thy will be done  
Thy will be done  
Thy will be done  
Thy will be done
