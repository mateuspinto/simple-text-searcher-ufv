All is fair in love  
Loves a crazy game  
Two people vow to stay  
In love as one they say  
But all is changed with time  
The future no one can see  
The road you leave behind  
Ahead lies mystery  
But all is fair in love  
I had to go away  
A writer takes his pen  
To write the words again  
That all in love is fair  
All of fates a chance  
Its either good or bad  
I tossed my coin to say  
In love with me youd stay  
But all in war is so cold  
You either win or lose  
When all is put away  
The loosing side Ill play  
But all is fair in love  
I should never have left your side  
A writer takes his pen  
To write the words again  
That all in love is fair  
A writer takes his pen  
To write the words again  
That all in love is fair
