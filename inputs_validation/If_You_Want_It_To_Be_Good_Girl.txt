If you want it to be good girl  
Get yourself a Bad boy

Gotta know just who to dial baby  
And thats me  
If you really like it hot  
Get someone who hits the spot Honey

And if you wanna get it done Then you gotta get the one  
The one whos got it goin on

If you wanna make it last Gotta know just who to ask  
Babys gotta be the best  
And thats me  
  
Chorus  
If you want it to be good girl Get yourself a Bad boy  
If you really want it good girl Get yourself a Bad boy  
Get it like it could be

Get yourself a Bad boy
