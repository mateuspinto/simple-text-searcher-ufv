Though this is all youll ever get  
It would be a strange delight  
No eyes no nose no mind  
The grey light of Porto stay with you  
Oh how can you love a tiny bug impressed  
By the night when you cut yourself  
Save me save me  
Your body rotten as the last melon on the vine  
Pull your shirt down save me save me  
Press my thumb onto your tongue  
Hand a knife up to me  
No mouth no neck no rest  
The white poem of self hate stays with you  
Even though you know a chance to cut  
Is still a chance to cure  
Pull your legs apart  
Save me save me  
Your body doomed as the last apple on the tree  
So let me hurt you
