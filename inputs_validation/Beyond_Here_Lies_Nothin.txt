Oh well I love you pretty baby  
Youre the only love Ive ever known  
Just as long as you stay with me  
The whole world is my throne  
Beyond here lies nothin  
Nothing we can call our own  
  
Well Im moving after midnight  
Down boulevards of broken cars  
Dont know what I do without it  
Without this love that we call ours  
Beyond here lies nothin  
Nothing but the moon and stars  
  
Down every street theres a window  
And every window made of glass  
Well keep on loving pretty baby  
For as long as love will last  
Beyond here lies nothin  
But the mountains of the past  
  
Well my ship is in the harbor  
And the sails are spread  
Listen to me pretty baby  
Lay your hand upon my head  
Beyond here lies nothin  
Nothing done and nothing said
