What happened  
Wake up in the morning  
Clock says half past one  
I have no sunglasses  
As I step into the sun  
  
Theres no recollection  
Of the evil things Ive done  
My head feels like I musta had some fun  
  
What happened  
  
Last thing I remember  
I was chillin at a party  
Pinching girlies asses  
I was drinking recklessly  
  
I know I did something  
Lord what could it be  
Woke up in the morning  
And all my friends hate me  
  
What happened  
  
What Im I doing here  
Who is this girl in my bed  
What is this shit on my face  
My God what is that awful smell  
  
Chorus  
She may be an angel  
She may be a queen  
She might be black white American Indian or Japanese  
Through a bottle at a bouncer  
Didnt think that he was cool  
Pissed in someones drink  
And through a bike into a pool  
  
Driven down the side walk  
Like a crazy possessed fool  
I broke every single traffic rule  
  
What happened  
What happened  
  
Lets go  
  
Chorus
