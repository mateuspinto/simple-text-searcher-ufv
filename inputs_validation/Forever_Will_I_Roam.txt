Colder now cold as the grave this town  
darkness falls the death of another soul  
empty lives the sins of the desperate  
shattered dreams a moments betrayal forever will I roam  
forever will I roam  
  
Chorus  
Forever will I roam a touch for a moment a scar for life  
Silent drifter on a highway side  
The heart of an angel a killers eyes  
  
Sacrifice slaughter the love we made  
Blood and sand a victim of innocence  
Crime of pride killing emotion  
Shroud of Tears inherit the wind Forever will I roam  
Forever will I roam  
  
Chorus  
  
Speak to me who are you anyway   
Vision of long drawn pain  
Calling and pleading  
Baring the guilty one again  
  
Colder now cold as the grave this town  
Darkness falls the eyes of a nameless stranger close  
  
Chorus
