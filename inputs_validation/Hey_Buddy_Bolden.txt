Buddy Bolden tune up  
Blowing horn was his game  
Born with a silver trumpet in his mouth  
He played the horn before he talked  
Born on the after beat  
He patted his foot before walked  
  
When Buddy Bolden tuned up you could hear him clean  
Clean across the river clean across the river  
He woke up the working people and kept the easy living  
Call on Buddy Bolden call him Buddy Bolden  
  
Watch it hes calling his flock now  
Hes calling his flock now here they come  
Call him Buddy Bolden hes calling his flock now  
Here they come here they come  
Come on Buddy Bolden here they come
