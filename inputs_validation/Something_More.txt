I just opened up my eyes  
And let the world come climbing in  
Its all better now things are gonna work somehow  
If I just sleep another hour  
Tried to reach you at your moms  
Hey baby why you trying to keep away for so long  
I stopped feeling good somehow I just knew I would  
I guess Ill sleep another hour  
Feels like Im wasting my time  
Hanging on this same old line  
Got to get you off of my mind  
Theres nothing left for me to find  
  
And all the more I want  
All the more I need  
All the while you want something more  
All the more I want  
All the more I need  
All the while you want something more  
  
Thought I found the words to say  
Just to get you feeling fine over heels my way  
But it dont matter how  
I lost the word and nerve and now  
Theres nothing more for me to say  
Feels like Im wasting my time  
Hanging on this same old line  
Theres nothing left for me to find  
  
And all the more I want  
All the more I need  
All the while you want something more  
All the more I want  
All the more I need  
All the while you want something  
  
Theres nothing left for me to say  
Wanting what I need this way  
And when Im feeling low I know  
I need to stop  
  
And someday you will see  
All the more you want  
All the more youll need me  
All the while Ill be on to something more  
And all the more you want  
All the more youll need me  
All the while I want something more  
I want something more  
I want something more than this
