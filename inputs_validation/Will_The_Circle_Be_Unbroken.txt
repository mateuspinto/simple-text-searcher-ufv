I was standing by my window  
On one cold and cloudy day  
When I saw that hearse come rolling  
For to carry my mother away  
  
Will the circle be unbroken  
By and by Lord by and by  
Theres a better home awaiting  
In the sky Lord in the sky  
  
I said to that undertaker  
Undertaker please drive slow  
For this lady you are carrying  
Lord I hate to see her go  
  
Will the circle be unbroken  
By and by Lord by and by  
Theres a better home awaiting  
In the sky Lord in the sky  
  
Oh I followed close behind her  
Tried to hold up and be brave  
But I could not hide my sorrow  
When they laid her in the grave  
  
Will the circle be unbroken  
By and by Lord by and by  
Theres a better home awaiting  
In the sky Lord in the sky  
  
I went back home my home was lonesome  
Missed my mother she was gone  
All of my brothers sisters crying  
What a home so sad and lone  
  
Will the circle be unbroken  
By and by Lord by and by  
Theres a better home awaiting  
In the sky Lord in the sky  
  
We sang the songs of childhood  
Hymns of faith that made us strong  
Ones that mother Maybelle taught us  
Hear the angels sing along  
  
Will the circle be unbroken  
By and by Lord by and by  
Theres a better home awaiting  
In the sky Lord in the sky  
  
Will the circle be unbroken  
By and by Lord by and by  
Theres a better home awaiting  
In the sky Lord in the sky
