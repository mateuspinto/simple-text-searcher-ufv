Lying awake at night I wipe the sweat  
From my brow  
But its not the fear cause  
Id rather go now  
  
Trying to visualize the horrors that  
Will lay ahead  
The desert sand mound a burial ground  
  
When it comes to the time  
Are we partners in crime  
When it comes to the time  
Well be ready to die  
  
God let us go now and finish whats  
To be done  
Thy Kingdom Come  
Thy shall be done on earth  
  
Trying to justify to ourselves the  
Reasons to go  
Should we live and let live  
Forget or forgive  
  
But how can we let them go on this way  
The reign of terror corruption must end  
And we know deep down theres  
No other way  
No trust no reasoning no more to say  
  
Afraid to shoot strangers  
Afraid to shoot strangers
