Showboat coming up the river  
See her lanterns flicker in the gentle breeze  
I can hear the crickets singing in the evening  
Old Dixie Lily moving past the cypress trees  
  
My little boat  she rocks easy  
Ive been catching catfish in the creek all day  
Oh and Ive never seen ladies like those on the big boats  
Must be fancy breeding lets you live that way  
  
Dixie Lily chugging like a grand old lady  
Paddles hitting home in the noonday sun  
Plowing through the water with your whistles blowing  
Down from Louisiana on the Vicksburg run  
  
Papa says that Im a dreamer  
Says them squitas bit me one too many times  
Oh but I never get lonesome living on the river  
Watching old Lily leave the world behind
