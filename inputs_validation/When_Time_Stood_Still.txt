Far beyond the things you see  
Time rolls on eternally  
Got a thing about it  
Just cant live without it  
  
Sitting there inside your mind  
Just waiting for the clock to chime  
On a lonely line  
Stood a lonely man  
  
No pictures on an empty wall  
No body there no one at all  
Just echoes in the ivory halls  
When time stood still  
  
Days line up outside the door  
Thought time had stopped there was no more  
Been a lonely world  
Such a lonely world  
  
No pictures on an empty wall  
No Toulouse Vincent or Pablo  
Just echoes in the ivory halls  
When time stood still  
  
No big machine or April showers  
No submarines no plastic flowers  
Just echoes in the ivory towers  
When time stood still  
  
When time stood still  
  
When time stood still  
  
When time stood still
