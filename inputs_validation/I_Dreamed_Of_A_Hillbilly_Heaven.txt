I dreamed I was there in hillbilly heaven oh what a beautiful sight  
And I met all the stars in hillbilly heaven oh what a star spangled night  
Last night I dreamed I went to hillbilly heaven  
And just as I arrived the old curtain lifted  
And there on stage stood who else but Roy Acuff and Tex Ritter  
They said well how you doing come on in here  
I know theres some folks you want to see  
Over theres our newest member your old friend Conway Twitty say Hello Darlin  
And theres gentlemen Jim Reeves singin with heavens choir  
Roger Miller he just got here hes making everybody laugh  
Course you know Roy Orbison can sing just as high as anybody here  
And Ernest Tubb can sing as low  
And Patsy Cline well bet shes the best singin angel here  
And Dottie West is probably the prettiest  
Theres the old peapicker Ernie Ford  
Jimmy Rodgers George Morgan Hank Williams  
And the wandering boy Web Pierce  
The old honky tonker himself Lefty Frizzell  
My goodness what a group  
Would you just listen to Mother Mabel  
Over there pickin the Wildwood Flower with the angel band  
You know I personally think shes just about Gods favorite  
And Marty Robbins well hes still gettin more encores than anybody else up
here  
Just like he used to down on earth  
Yeah well theres Elvis they still call him the King  
But we know theyre not talking about the real king up here  
I dreamed I went to hillbilly heaven oh what a star studded night  
Then I ask Roy and Tex I said well who do you think will be showin up  
Say within the next 40 50 60 years  
They handed me a big tallybook and in it I saw names like Johnny Cash  
George Jones Merle Haggard Don Gibson Mel Tillis Farren Young Kitty Wells  
Some of the newer ones like Vince Gill and Garth Brooks  
Course they talked about Minnie Pearl the Judds Tanya Tucker Reba McEntire
Hank Jr  
Oh of course Buck Owens Roy Rodgers Gene Autry Randy Travis and Willie Nelson  
Theres old Chet  
I said well wheres Porter Wagoners name oh there it is  
And then there was Loretta Lynn and Tammy Wynette and Dolly Parton  
Oooh thats when I woke up  
I dreamed I was there in hillbilly heaven oh what a beautiful sight  
And I met all the stars in hillbilly heaven oh what a star spangled night
