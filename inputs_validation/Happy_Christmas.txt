And so this is Christmas and what have you done  
Another year over a new one just begun  
And so this is Christmas I hope you have fun  
The near and the dear ones the old and the young  
  
A Merry Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year  
Lets hope its a good one without any fear  
  
So this is Christmas for weak and for strong  
The rich and the poor one the road is so long  
So Happy Christmas for black and for white  
The yellow and red one and stop all the fight  
  
A Merry Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year  
Lets hope its a good one without any fear  
  
So this is Christmas and what have we done  
Another year over a new one just begun  
So Happy Christmas I hope you have fun  
The near and the dear ones the old and the young  
  
A Merry Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year  
Lets hope its a good one without any fear  
  
So this is Christmas and what have you done  
Another year over a new one just begun  
And so Happy Christmas we hope you have fun  
The near and the dear ones the old and the young  
  
A Merry Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year  
Lets hope its a good one without any fear
