I am a young mariner headed to war  
Im thinkin bout my family and what it was for  
Theres water on the wood and the sails feel good  
And when I get to shore I hope that I can kill good  
  
My father was a sailor named Captain Kennedy  
He lost his wooden schooner to the Germans on the sea  
Exploded on the water for everyone to see  
And humiliate that American Captain Kennedy  
  
I saw him in Nassau in 1971  
His strength was failin but he still ran a run  
He worked til his fingers wore to the bone  
To buy that wooden schooner and sail on his own  
  
He was known in the islands as hundred foot iron  
That steel hull freighter was passin its time  
And time flew by faster with life on the sea  
And the days grew shorter for Captain Kennedy  
  
I am a young mariner headed to war  
Im thinkin bout my family and what it was for  
Theres water on the wood and the sails feel good  
And when I get to shore I hope that I can kill good
