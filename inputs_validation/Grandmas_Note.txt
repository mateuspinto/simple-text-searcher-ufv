I read a note my grandma wrote  
Back in 1923  
Grandpa kept it in his coat  
And he showed once to me  
  
He said now son you might not understand  
But a long long time ago  
Gandmas daddy didnt like me none  
But I loved your grandma so  
  
We had this crazy plan to meet  
And run away together  
Get married in the first town we came too and live forever  
But nailed to the tree where we were supposed to meet instead  
I found this letter and this is what it said  
  
If you get there before I do  
Dont give up on me  
Ill meet you when my chores are through  
I dont know how long Ill be  
But Im not gonna let you down  
Darling wait and see  
Cause between now and then till I see you again  
Ill be loving you love me  
  
I read these words just hours before  
My grandma passed away  
In the doorway of the church where me and grandpa stop to pray  
I know Ive never seen him cry  
In all my 15 years  
But as he read these words to her  
His eyes filled up with tears  
  
If you get there before I do  
Dont give up on me  
Ill meet you when my chores are through  
I dont know how long Ill be  
But Im not gonna let you down  
Darling wait and see  
Cause between now and then till I see you again  
Ill be loving you love me  
  
If you get there before I do  
Dont give up on me  
Ill meet you when my chores are through  
I dont know how long Ill be  
But Im not gonna let you down  
Darling wait and see  
Cause between now and then till I see you again  
Ill be loving you love me
