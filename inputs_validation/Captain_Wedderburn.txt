A noblemens fair daughter  
Came down a narrow lane  
And met with Captain Wedderburn  
The keeper of the game  
Now my pretty fair miss  
If it wasnt for the law  
You and I in the bed might lie  
Roll me over next to the wall  
Roll me over next to the wall  
  
Now my dear good man she said  
Do not be perplexed  
Before that you might bed with me  
You must answer questions six  
Six questions you must answer me  
And I will ask them all  
And you and I in the bed might lie  
Roll me over next to the wall  
Roll me over next to the wall  
  
What is rounder than a ring  
And higher than the trees  
And what is worse than a womans curse  
And what is deeper than the sea  
What bird sings first which ones best  
Where does the dew first fall  
And you and I in a bed might lie  
Roll me over next to the wall  
Roll me over next to the wall  
  
The earth is rounder than a ring  
And heaven is higher than the trees  
The devil curse is worse than a womans curse  
And hell in deeper than the sea  
The lark sings first the thrush sings best  
Earth is where the dew falls  
And you and I in a bed might lie  
Roll me over next to the wall  
You and I in the bed might lie  
Roll me over next to the wall  
Roll me over next to the wall  
  
He takes her by her lilywhite hand  
And leads her down the hall  
And he takes her by her slender waist  
For fear that she might fall  
And he lays her on a bed of down  
Without a doubt at all  
And he and she lie in one bed  
Roll me over next to the wall  
And she and he lie in one bed  
Roll me over next to the wall  
Roll me over next to the wall  
Roll me over next to the wall
