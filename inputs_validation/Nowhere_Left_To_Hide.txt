Youre young and hungry and youre not satisfied  
You take your chances and walk that tentative line  
You push a little harder and leave old friends behind  
But baby sooner or later you could wake up and find  
That you have run out of time and you know youve got  
  
Nowhere left to hide  
Nothing to protect your heart this time  
Youve got nowhere left to hide  
  
You know the feeling of walking out in that ring  
You weigh your hunger against the fear that it brings  
And in that moment at night when you finally decide  
You better be sure youve got shelter  
When the whole thing unwinds  
And somethings breaking inside  
Cause you know youve got  
  
Nowhere left to hide  
Nothing to protect your heart this time  
Youve got nowhere left to hide  
  
No regrets alibis you know your chances this time
