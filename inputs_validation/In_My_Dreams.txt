There was a time some time ago  
When every sunrise meant a sunny day oh a sunny day  
But now when the morning light shines in  
It only disturbs the dreamland where I lay oh where I lay  
I used to thank the lord when Id wake  
For life and love and the golden sky above me  
But now I pray the stars will go on shinin  
You see in my dreams you love me  
  
Daybreak is a joyful time  
Just listen to the songbird harmonies oh the harmonies  
But I wish the dawn would never come  
I wish there was silence in the trees oh the trees  
If only I could stay asleep  
At least I could pretend youre thinkin of me  
Cause nighttime is the one time I am happy  
You see in my dreams  
  
We climb and climb and at the top we fly  
Let the world go on below us  
We are lost in time  
And I dont know really what it means  
All I know is that you love me  
In my dreams  
  
I keep hopin one day Ill awaken  
And somehow shell be lying by my side  
And as I wonder if the dawn is really breakin  
She touches me and suddenly Im alive  
  
And we climb and climb and at the top we fly  
Let the world go on below us  
We are lost in time  
And I dont know really what it means  
All I know is that you love me  
In my dreams  
  
And we climb and climb and at the top we fly  
Let the world go on below us  
We are lost in time  
And I dont know really what it means  
All I know is that you love me  
In my dreams oh oh oh oh  
In my dreams
