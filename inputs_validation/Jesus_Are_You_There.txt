Give me something I can touch with my hands  
Something I can look at and understand  
If youre up there no dont look down on me  
Do something quick I cant pay the rent  
  
Do you believe in Jesus  
Is he there  
Is there a God above  
And does he really care  
  
Oh yeah  
Jesus are you there  
And do you really care  
I dont believe in nothing no more  
  
Cant find the truth  
I just need to score  
Dont give me Hare Krishna  
Keep it to yourself man  
  
Stand back  
Get back  
Do you believe in Jesus  
Is he there  
  
Is there a God above  
And does he really care  
Oh yeah  
Jesus are you there  
  
And do you really care  
Take me on a cruise around the world  
Give me a break  
Bring me a girl  
  
Getting crazy about World War Three  
Its suicide of the sanctuary  
Should I believe in Jesus  
Is he there  
  
Is there a God above  
And does he really care  
Oh yeah  
Jesus are you there  
  
And do you really care  
Oh yeah  
No no no no  
Jesus are you there  
  
Oh yeah  
No no no no no no  
Do you really care  
Jesus are you there  
  
Anybody in  
Jesus Jesus Jesus are you there
