Went downtown on the two fortynine  
Playin for recognition of the New York town  
See me and the boys got a rock n roll band  
They were so damn good gonna lift up the man  
  
Well we got ups we got downs  
We got just so high til the sun goes down  
Got the ego can be abused  
I got my twotoned shoes  
And I can sing the blues  
  
Chorus  
Look out kids its the F B I  
We got a problem you keep me high  
Put on your clothes take the smile off your face  
And put your money where your mouth is or get out this place  
  
New York town is a meanass town  
We got a thousand bands singin underground  
Way down in New Orleans its the same old thing  
Emotional music a merry old thing  
  
Old King Soul he finally gave us a jolt  
He played the vibes til nine and read from ten to four  
He played upside down he played inside out  
Then a uniform band he was thrown into jail  
  
Chorus  
  
Gettin hungry I know little woman  
Cant get a smell cause my nose is blocked  
Im so high I cant believe it  
Hotel dogs are knockin on my door  
  
Two night of singin nearly out on the end  
Left the two parts red oh what a square  
As soon as the man theres no sweeter song  
Listen McCartney were the band on the run  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh yeah
