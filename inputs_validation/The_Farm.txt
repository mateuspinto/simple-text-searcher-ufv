Were feedin the world but we cant feed ourselves  
They tell us dont plant now but theres nothing on the shelves  
If someone is watchin down from above  
What in the world is he thinkin of  
Daisy I think we must sell the farm  
And you know I dont wanna cause alarm  
The times are a changin the money is gone  
Where do we go from here where do we go from here  
If someone is watchin down from above  
What in the world is he thinkin of  
Daisy I think we must sell the farm  
And you know I dont wanna cause you harm  
The times are a changin the money is gone  
Where do we go from here where do we go from here  
Where do we go from here
