If youve got a problem I dont care what it is  
If you need a hand I can assure you of this  
I can help Ive got two loving arms I can help  
It would sure do me good to do you good I can help  
Its a fact that people get lonely aint nothing new  
But a man like you baby should never have the blues  
I can help Ive got two for me I can help  
It would sure do me good to do you good let me help  
Oh when I go to sleep at night youre always a part of my dreams  
Holdin me tight and tellin me everything I wanna hear  
Oh dont forget me baby all you gotta do is call  
You know that I love you you if I can do anything at all  
Let me help if your child needs a mama I can help  
Oh it would sure do me good to do you good let me help

Oh when I go to sleep at night  
Oh it would sure do me good to do you good let me help
