Lord Im singing You this message up to Heaven  
Asking you to send me down another angel  
Ive been looking for a long time for someone to get her off my mind  
But you know Lord angels are hard to find  
  
I want an angel with arms and not with wings  
Someone that I can call my darling  
If You can think of someone to fit that description  
Lord could You help me one more time  
But I know Lord angels are hard to find  
  
Its my fault I lost the first one You sent to me  
I didnt know til she was gone how much she meant to me  
She loved me but I was blind I bet I do a whole lot better next time  
But I know Lord angels are hard to find  
  
I want an angel with arms and not with wings  
Someone that I can call darling  
If You can think of someone to fit my description  
Lord could You help ole Hank one more time  
But I know Lord yeah angels are hard to find  
One like that right there Lord angels are hard to find
