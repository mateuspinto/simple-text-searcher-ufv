Whiskey woman dont you know that you are drivin me insane  
The liquor you give stems your will to live and gets right to my brain  
Dont you know youre driving me insane  
Youre tryin to find your way through life  
Youre tryin to get some new direction  
Another woman got her man  
She wont find no new connection  
  
Takes another drink or two  
Things look better when shes through  
  
Takes another look around youre not goin anywhere  
Youve realized youre gettin old and no one seems to care  
Youre tryin to find your way again  
Youre tryin to find some new  
Another womans got her man  
But she wont find a new  
  
Takes another drink or two  
Things look better when shes through  
  
You bin foolin with some hot guy  
I want to know why is it why  
Get up get out you know you really blew it  
Ive had enough Ive had enough good God pluck me  
  
Once she was wonderful  
Once she was fine  
Once she was beautiful  
Once she was mine  
She was mine  
  
Now change has come over her body  
She doesnt see me anymore  
Now change has come over her body  
She doesnt see me anymore  
  
Changes changes changes changes  
Victim of changes
