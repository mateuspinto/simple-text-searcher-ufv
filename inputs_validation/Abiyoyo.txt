Once upon a time there was a little boy who  
Played the ukelele Hed go around town

Not only that the boys father was a gettin  
In trouble He was a magician He had a  
Magic wand He could go Zoop Zoop make  
Things disappear But the father played too  
Many tricks on people Somebody doing a  
Hard job of work zzt zzt zzt up comes the  
Father with his magic wand Zoop no saw  
Come to someone about to drink a nice cold  
Glass of something Zoop the glass  
Disappears Hed come to someone about  
To sit down after a hard days work Zoopl  
No chair  
  
People said to the father You get out  
Of here too Take your magic wand and  
Your son The boy and his father were  
Ostracized That means they made them  
Live on the edge of town  
  
Now in this town they used to tell stories  
The old people used to tell stories about  
The giants that lived in the old days They  
Used to tell a story about a giant called  
Abiyoyo They said he was as tall as a  
House and could eat people up  
Of course nobody believed it but they  
Told the story anyway  
  
One day one day the sun rose blood red  
Over the hill And the first people got up  
And looked out of their window they saw a  
Great big shadow in front of the sun And  
They could feel the whole ground shake  
Stomp stomp Women screamed Ahh  
Strong men fainted Ohh  Run for  
Your lives Abiyoyos coming  
  
He came to the sheep pasture grabs a  
Whole sheep Yeowp Comes to the cow  
Pasture grabs a whole cow Yeowp  
Daniel Grab your most precious  
Possessions and run Run Just then the  
Boy and his father woke up Hey Paw  
Whats coming over the field  Oh Son  
Thats Abiyoyo Oh if I could only get him  
To lie down I could make him disappear  
  
The boy said Come with me Father He  
Grabs his father by one hand The father  
Gets the magic wand the boy gets the  
Ukelele They run across the field People  
Yelled Dont go near him Hell eat you  
Alive There was Abiyoyo He had long  
Fingernails cause he never cut em  
Slobbery teeth cause he didnt brush  
Them Stinking feet cause he didnt wash  
em He raised up with his claws the boy  
Whips out his ukelele and starts to sing  
  
Well you know the giant had never heard a song  
About himself before and a foolish grin spread  
Over the giants face And the giant started to  
Dance Abiyoyo Abiyoyo Abiyoyo the boy  
Went faster Abiyoyo yoyoyo yoyoyo Abiyoyo  
Abiyoyo Abiyoyo Abiyoyo Abiyoyo The giant  
Got out of breath He staggered He fell down flat  
On the ground Zoop Zoop people looked out  
The window Abiyoyo disappeared  
  
They ran across the fields They lifted the boy  
And his father up on their shoulders They said  
Come back to town Bring your damn ukelele  
We don t care anymore And they all sang
