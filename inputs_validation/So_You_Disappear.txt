I breathe the scent of your hair  
Your emerald eyes are closed  
Theres still some music in the air  
Feels like time no more flows  
We sit youre in my arms  
Watching the first daylight gleam  
You say I like your warmth  
A voice just in a dream  
I was dreaming of the wind  
I was dreaming like a child  
A prince and princess fairy tale  
And so you disappear  
I was dreaming of the fire  
Of the time when it was wild  
I was dreaming far too sweet  
And so you disappear  
In chaos waters I do swim  
And youre the stone ones thrown into  
A frail creature now gets dim  
As the gold turns into blue  
Made me think you were so damn near  
Like a bright shining star  
But reaching out you disappeared  
For real you are so very far  
I was dreaming of the wind  
I was dreaming like a child  
A prince and princess fairy tale  
And so you disappear  
I was dreaming of the fire  
Of the time when it was wild  
I was dreaming far too sweet  
And so you disappear  
I was dreaming of the wind  
I was dreaming like a child  
A prince and princess fairy tale  
And so you disappear  
I was dreaming of the wind  
I was dreaming like a child  
A prince and princess fairy tale  
And so you disappear  
I was dreaming of the fire  
Of the time when it was wild  
I was dreaming far too sweet  
And so  
I dreampt of the wind  
Id run so sweet  
I dreampt like the child  
Id burn so sweet  
I dreampt of the fire  
Of the time it was wild  
Id run so sweet  
I dreampt of the wind  
I dreampt like the child  
Id burn  
I dreampt of the fire  
And so you disappeared
