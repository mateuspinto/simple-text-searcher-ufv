You have one letter left to send  
With no beginning and no end  
You saw them in the park  
The laughter in the dark oh no  
How can you face him and pretend  
  
So now you thank him carefully oh no  
Cause thats the way hes going to be oh no  
I hope you find some reason to be free  
  
There is no sunshine in your eyes  
You make no sound and yet you cry  
Its not the double cross  
You feel the love you lost oh no  
This letter has to say goodbye  
  
So now you thank him carefully oh no  
Cause thats the way hes going to be oh no  
I hope you find some reason to be free  
  
You saw them in the park  
The laughter in the dark oh no  
How can you face him and pretend  
  
So now you thank him carefully oh no  
Cause thats the way hes going to be oh no  
I hope you find some reason to be free
