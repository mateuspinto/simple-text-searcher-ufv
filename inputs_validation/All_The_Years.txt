You ask me what I think  
I tell you you ignore it  
The reasons for it make me crazy  
You ask me what is right  
Huh you never hear it  
Youre never nowhere near it baby  
I spent my life believing  
It would not end this way  
  
Chorus  
All the Years we wasted  
All the Years we tried  
All the restless hours  
All the times we cried  
  
You ask me what I want  
I got no answer  
I know Im only dancing faster  
So now were stuck with us  
With you and all your stories  
Whos the fool and whod the liar  
I spent my life believing  
It would not end this way  
  
Chorus  
  
All the years we gambled  
All the years you lied  
All the hopeless dreamers  
All the dreams that died  
  
Chorus Repeats till fade
