Nobodys inside the church but the bell is ringing  
For no reason the flowers are dying  
Oh Deadly Omens  
Oh Deadly Omens  
Inside the mansion the air is unbearable a rotten smell  
In the dinning room the table is set for 3  
Oh Deadly Omens  
Oh Deadly Omens  
SOLO Mike SOLO Andy  
Miriam come here and see what Ive found its moving  
An empty cradle swaying in the air  
I did not bring it in here now did You  
No no no  
Oh Deadly Omens  
Oh Deadly Omens
