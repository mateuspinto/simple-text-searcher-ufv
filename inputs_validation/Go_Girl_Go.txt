Well the mustang pulled in a no parkin zone  
Out stepped a chic with legs to the bone  
Alabama figure and a Tennessee smile  
Louisiana walk thatll drive a man wild  
  
Now go girl go go girl go  
Its quite a show go girl go  
  
When she goes to the party and she starts to dance  
All the other girls they aint gotta chance  
  
Now go girl go go girl go  
Its quite a show go girl go  
  
Well the way she wiggles when she starts to walk  
All the men want to do is talk  
  
Now go girl go go girl go  
Its a hell of a show go girl go  
  
When she eased into my Cadillac  
I gave her the look and she gave it right back  
  
And now go girl go go girl go  
Its quite a show go girl go  
  
Alabama figure and a Tennessee smile  
Louisiana walk thatll drive a man wild  
  
Now go girl go go girl go  
Its quite a show go girl go
