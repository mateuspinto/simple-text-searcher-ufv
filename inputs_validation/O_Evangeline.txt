O Evangeline you been gone so long  
And for a time it seemed  
Every road you took turned wrong  
But a second chance would come  
With each new bridge you burned  
I know you squandered some  
But then from some you learned  
And the point of rescue well  
You passed that long ago  
O but to hear you teil it was  
Just another part of the show  
O Evangeline your faith shone blind and true  
We raise our glass and sing  
Of you Evangeline  
  
O Evangeline you with no kith or kin  
The nights so hard and mean  
You shed them like a skin  
For you were always strong  
When the bad slid down to worse  
You still had that song  
It was your blessing and your curse  
But in your tongue  
There is no word for home  
Therell be no one  
To roll away the stone  
O Evangeline you have been a prisoner here  
Bread and roses we shall bring  
To you Evangeline  
  
O Evangeline what are you fighting for  
You stayed out in that ring  
When nobodys even keepin score  
But round by round you earned  
Your stumble into grace  
Still with every turn the world  
Becomes a sadder place  
It swallows up the ones  
You have loved the most  
So you sleep with none  
You wake with ghosts  
O Evangeline  
You have salted with your tears  
Every lonely mile youve seen  
through the years Evangeline  
  
Its a fatal shore  
You now wash upon  
So weary of the war  
And no longer young  
O Evangeline your voice  
Risin sweet and clear  
We close our eyes and dream  
Of you Evangeline
