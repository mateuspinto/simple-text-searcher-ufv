The Rangers had a homecoming  
In Harlem late last night  
And the Magic Rat drove his sleek machine  
Over the Jersey state line  
Barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a Dodge  
Drinking warm beer in the soft summer rain  
The Rat pulls into town rolls up his pants  
Together they take a stab at romance  
And disappear down Flamingo Lane  
  
Well the Maximum Lawmen run down Flamingo  
Chasing the Rat and the barefoot girl  
And the kids round there live just like shadows  
Always quiet holding hands  
From the churches to the jails  
Tonight all is silence in the world  
As we take our stand  
Down in Jungleland  
  
The midnight gangs assembled  
And picked a rendezvous for the night  
Theyll meet neath that giant Exxon sign  
That brings this fair city light  
Man theres an opera out on the Turnpike  
Theres a ballet being fought out in the alley  
Until the local cops CherryTops rips this holy night  
The streets alive as secret debts are paid  
Contacts made they flash unseen  
Kids flash guitars just like switchblades  
Hustling for the record machine  
The hungry and the hunted  
Explode into rock n roll bands  
That face off against each other out in the street  
Down in Jungleland  
  
In the parking lot the visionaries dress in the latest rage  
Inside the backstreet girls are dancing to the records that the DJ plays  
Lonelyhearted lovers struggle in dark corners  
Desperate as the night moves on  
Just one look and a whisper and theyre gone  
  
Beneath the city two hearts beat  
Soul engines running through a night so tender  
In a bedroom locked in whispers  
Of soft refusal and then surrender  
In the tunnels uptown the Rats own dream guns him down  
As shots echo down them hallways in the night  
No one watches when the ambulance pulls away  
Or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light  
  
Outside the streets on fire in a real death waltz  
Between whats flesh and whats fantasy  
And the poets down here dont write nothing at all  
They just stand back and let it all be  
And in the quick of a knife they reach for their moment  
And try to make an honest stand  
But they wind up wounded not even dead  
Tonight in Jungleland
