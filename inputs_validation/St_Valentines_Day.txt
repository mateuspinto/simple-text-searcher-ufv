I fell down on it Valentines day  
Dropped my flowers in the rain  
And got carried away  
The tide was coming in  
I could have been sad  
I could have been amused  
But I was just in pieces  
It was then that I knew  
The tide was coming in  
Aaahh this pattern on the back of my hand  
It makes a joke of me and the veins are like  
Rivers in sand running out to sea  
Nobody slept on the night of the crash  
We were all covered in devil grey ash  
The tide was coming in  
I could have been dead  
I could have been underground  
But somebody decided I should stick around  
The tide was coming in  
Aaahh I know Im just killing time  
But time is killing me  
My eyes are witness to this crime and looking out to sea
