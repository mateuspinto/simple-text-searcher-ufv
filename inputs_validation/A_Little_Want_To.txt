There aint no excuse thats what my mama said  
You gotta get up and get outta bed  
Roll up your sleeves put your back into it  
If your gonna get it done then you better get to it  
  
No matter what it is you want to do  
You got to have a little want to  
Inside of you  
That goes a long long way  
  
A little nothing I cant do  
Attitude  
No matter what folks say  
Well big dreams do come true  
  
All you gotta go  
Is have a little want to  
I remember sittin on the livin room floor  
My brother tried to show me how to make a G chord  
  
My hands were small my fingers hurt  
Thats when he said itll take a lot of work  
But if I can do it girl so can you  
You got to have a little want to  
  
Inside of you  
That goes a long long way  
A little nothing I cant do  
Attitude  
  
No matter what folks say  
Well big dreams do come true  
All you gotta go  
  
Is have a little want to  
Oh now I make my living out here singing on this stage  
When people ask me how I got here I just look at them and say  
You got to have a little want to  
  
Inside of you  
That goes a long long way  
A little nothing I cant do  
Attitude  
  
No matter what folks say  
You got to have a little want to  
A little nothing I cant do  
Attitude  
  
No matter what folks say  
Cause big dreams do come true  
All you gotta do  
Is have a little want to  
  
Thats all you gotta do  
Is have a little want to  
Keep that attitude  
And have a little want to want to want to
