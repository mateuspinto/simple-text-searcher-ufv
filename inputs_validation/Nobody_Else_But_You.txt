Who loves me even though Im crazy  
And nothing that I say is true  
Who won my heart and soul forever  
Its nobody else but  
Nobody else but  
  
Each time I feel Im out to pasture  
Who always makes me feel brand new  
Im pledging my allegiance baby  
To nobody else but  
Nobody else but  
  
Look at me laughing out lou  
Trying to remember all the jokes that you taught me  
When you see the light in my eyes  
Its only a reflection of the joy that you brought me  
  
How did I get to be so happy  
Ive wondered that my whole life through yeah  
I thank my lucky stars for sending me  
Nobody else but nobody else but  
Nobody else but you  
  
La la la la you yeah  
La la la la  
La la la la la  
La la la la  
La la la la la  
  
Look at me laughing out loud  
Trying to remember all the jokes that you taught me  
When you see the love in my eyes  
Its only a reflection of the joy that you brought me  
  
I always knew I had an angel  
A voice that told me what to do yeah  
But now that angels on my shoulder  
Its nobody else but nobody else but  
Nobody else but you  
  
La la la la you yeah  
La la la la  
La la la la la  
La la la la  
La la la la la woah  
La la la la
