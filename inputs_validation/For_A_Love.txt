Gilberto Parra  
  
For a love  
I cant sleep and I live full of passion  
I have a love  
That left forever in my life a bitter pain  
  
Poor me  
This life would be better if it would end  
Its not for me  
  
Poor me Ay my heart  
Poor me dont suffer any more  
How much my suffering in my breast  
That throbs so alone for you  
  
For a love  
I have cried little drops of blood from my heart  
You have left me with a wounded soul  
Without compassion
