Sing a song of love to me  
Sing out sing out  
Shes the one who made me free  
Sing out sing out  
cause she made me smile  
And she made me love  
Oh she made me laugh  
And she made me dance  
Bombo  
Little pearl inside the shell  
Come out come out  
From deep down in my wishing well  
Sing out sing out  
cause you made me smile  
And you made me love  
And you made me laugh  
And you made me dance  
Bombo
