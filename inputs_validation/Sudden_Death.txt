His evil Highness born from disaster  
To dominate and to kill  
A glistening murder machine  
False majesty standing perfectly still  
A blitzkrieg raining down evil  
On a mountain of black ice  
Like a good old fashioned beating within  
Inches of your life  
  
While alone and left abandoned  
With the sentence youve been handed  
All your angels will ignore you  
As your life flashes before you  
Even still you keep on fighting  
Through the thunder and the lightning  
And now Heaven sends its love  
Your sudden death from above  
  
Once frozen like a prisoner depraved  
Perched high atop the lithosphere  
Set free from beneath the depths of hell  
Bequeathing anything but despair  
The beast is genetically programmed  
Time to destroy time to go berserk  
To see the end of all wars  
To see the end of the Earth  
  
Stopping at nothing punch drunk  
From the blood that hes tasted  
Tearing your soul apart  
Not one bit of your pain will be wasted  
Now death descends upon you  
Like a bloody white dove  
Bringing your retribution  
Your sudden death from above  
  
While alone and left abandoned  
With the sentence youve been handed  
All your angels will ignore you  
As your life flashes before you  
Even still you keep on fighting  
Through the thunder and the lightning  
And now Heaven sends its love  
Your sudden death from above
