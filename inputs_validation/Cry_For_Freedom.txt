Freedom this cry of all slaves will be heard  
And the tyrants will feel the steel of the sword  
The chains will be broken by all slaves on the earth  
Forever to be free from their load  
  
Time has run our for all you tyrants on earth  
Your slaves are heedin the call  
Makin an end to all this terror and pain  
An end to your lies and your law  
  
Takin away all your gold and your money  
Cause dead men wont need it anymore  
Much too long we felt the slash of your whips  
So now you will feel our swords  
  
Freedom the eternal cry will echo high in the sky  
The day will come when all power has been broken  
  
Your blood will flow down to the gates of hell  
Satan will wait for your souls  
Pray to your god he wont help you hes dead  
He wont fool our minds and our soulsanymore  
  
Chorus  
  
Freedom the cry of all slaves will be heard  
The tyrants will now feel the steel of the sword  
The chains will be broken by all slaves on earth  
Forever to be free from their load  
  
Chorus  
  
forever to be free from their load
