Getting hung up all day on smiles  
Walking down Portobello road for miles  
Greeting strangers in Indian boots  
Yellow ties and old brown suits  
Growing old is my only danger  
  
Cuckoo clocks and plastic socks  
Lampshades of old antique leather  
Nothing looks weird not even a beard  
Or the boots made out of feathers  
  
Ill keep walking miles till I feel  
A broom beneath my feet  
Or the hawking eyes of an old stuffed bull across the street  
  
Nothings the same if you see it again  
Itll be broken down to litter  
Oh and the clothes  
Everyone know that that dress will never fit her  
  
Getting hung up all day on smiles  
Walking down Portobello road for miles  
Greeting strangers in Indian boots  
Yellow ties and old brown suits  
Growing old is my only danger  
  
Cuckoo clocks and plastic socks  
Lampshades of old antique leather  
Nothing looks weird not even a beard

Or the hawking eyes of an old stuffed bull across the street  
  
Nothings the same if you see it again  
Itll be broken down to litter  
Oh and the clothes  
Everyone know that that dress will never fit her  
  
Getting hung up all day on smiles  
Walking down Portobello road for miles  
Greeting strangers in Indian boots

Growing old is my only danger
