So alive when youre near  
Sometimes this pounding in my heart is all that I can hear  
Everyday every night  
I feel my weakness gettin stronger  
With each moment passin by  
  
I keep tryin to tell my heart  
Just a matter of time till the feeling subsides  
But time doesnt change a thing  
And I want you to know  
That I need you more than ever  
  
Chorus  
Never get enough of your love  
It would only take me  
Till the end of forever  
Never get enough of your love  
Heaven knows Ive tried  
But I cant get enough of your love  
  
Cant deny what I feel  
The more I fall into this dream the more I know its real  
I just run to your touch  
Cause nothin else can satisfy this hunger for your love  
  
They say that a time will come when the thrill is gone  
Still it keeps goin strong  
And time doesnt mean a thing  
Cause as good as it gets  
Oh it just keeps gettin better  
  
Chorus  
  
The more I feel the more I feel about you  
The trouble is I never get enough  
The more I live the more I just cant live without you  
I cant get enough  
No never enough of your love  
  
Chorus
