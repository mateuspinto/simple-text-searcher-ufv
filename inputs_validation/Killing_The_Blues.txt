Leaves were falling just like embers  
In colors red and gold they set us on fire  
Burning just like a moonbeam in our eyes  
Chorus  
Somebody said they saw me  
Swinging the world by the tail  
Bouncing over a white cloud  
Killing the blues  
I am guilty of something  
I hope you never do because there is nothing  
Sadder than losing  yourself in love  
Repeat chorus  
Repeat chorus  
Now you ask me just to leave you  
To go out on my own and get what I need to  
You want me to find what Ive already had  
Repeat chorus  
Repeat chorus  
Repeat chorus  
Repeat chorus
