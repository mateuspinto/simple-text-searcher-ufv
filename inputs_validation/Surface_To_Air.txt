Surface surface surface  
Its beginning to show  
To air to air to air  
To where you can go  
Abrasion can wear you away  
All you wanted was to go out and play  
Time to fix this crack in the eagle  
Before she flies away  
Smokin smokin smokin  
Makin cloudier skies  
Today today see the stars  
Two terrestrial minds stay shy  
Monkey monkey wanna play around  
But get confused when flames burn your hand  
Got to fix this ache in the eagle  
So she can understand  
Surface surface surface  
Its beginning to rise  
To air to air to air  
To where you can realize  
Can scare you away  
Who knows how much is too much to say  
Try to fix this ache in the eagle  
Before she flies away flies away
