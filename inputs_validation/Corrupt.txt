I could corrupt you  
In a heart beat  
You think your so special  
Think your so sweet  
What are you trying dont even tempt me  
Soon youll be crying unwishing you dreamt of be  
Youll be calling out my name  
When you need someone to blame  
  
I can corrupt you  
It would be easy  
Watching you suffer  
God it would please me  
  
I wanna touch you with my little finger  
I know it will crush you my memory would linger  
Youd be crying out in pain  
Begging me to play my games  
  
I can corrupt you  
It will be ugly  
They could sedate you  
But what good would drugs be  
I wanna touch you with my hands on your hips  
It would be too much to  
Place my lips on your lips  
Youll be calling out my name  
Begging me to play my games
