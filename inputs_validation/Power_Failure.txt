Climbing out of open windows  
Crashing down from broken stairs  
Keeping watch on smoking cinders  
Falling over burning chairs  
  
Tossed and crossed and screwed in transit  
Broken  splintered bruised and thrown  
Badly shattered gale force frighty  
Rushed across and shown alone  
  
Speech reduced by poor relations  
Strung from weeks of self abuse  
Chopped up churned out weeks of greazy  
Spark plugs burned up powers fused
