Way across the deep blue ocean  
Way above the mountain so high  
People sing and loiterings freely  
Songs of joy reach up to the sky  
In this time of worry and confusion  
In this world of trouble and pain  
Were so many and the road is so weary  
How many people can tell you my name   
Bells of freedom ring  
Bells of freedom ring  
Come friends and people from every corner  
People come from everywhere  
Let the bells of freedom ring loudly  
Ring for those who know and care  
Bells of freedom ring  
Bells of freedom ring  
Way across the deep blue ocean  
Way above the mountain so high  
People sing and loiterings freely  
Songs of joy reach up to the sky  
Bells of freedom ring  
Bells of freedom ring for us
