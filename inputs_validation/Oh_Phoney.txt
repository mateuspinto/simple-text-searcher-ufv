May this lovely letter  
Reach its destination  
If only  
Question one is why do you  
Pretend that you like me  
Oh Phoney  
See how the outside  
Contradicts whats inside  
Oh ooh  
  
Who can make Hitler  
Seem like a bus conductor  
You do oh Phoney you do  
  
You sing a lovely song to a scale  
And the words spell out my name  
Oh Phoney  
But then you kick me down below  
Cause you know it wont show  
How could you  
  
See how the outside  
Contradicts whats inside  
Oh ooh  
  
Who can make Hitler  
Seem like a bus conductor  
  
You do oh Phoney oh Phoney you do  
You do oh Phoney oh Phoney you do  
You do oh Phoney oh Phoney you do
