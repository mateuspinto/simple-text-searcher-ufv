Wishing I could come out of the fog  
  
Superhero pals  
  
Burst out of the sand  
  
And I bought you flowers  
  
You just say the word  
  
I could wish she comes  
  
Long  
  
Wish we could connect  
  
Step into the foot  
  
The diving board  
  
Bend into the light  
  
Down the cable lines  
Roll onto the earth  
Reforming on the wind  
Two places at once  
Taste the air with you  
Undo all the ties  
Wishing I could fling one of those lies  
  
See that stretchy smile go  
  
Right across your face  
  
I want
