No longer no longer  
What you ask  
Strange steps  
Heels turned black  
The cinders the cinders  
They light the path  
Of these strange steps  
Take us back take us back  
  
Flow sweetly hang heavy  
You suddenly complete me  
You suddenly complete me  
Flow sweetly hang heavy  
You suddenly complete me  
You suddenly complete me  
  
Oh oh hey  
Oh oh hey  
Hysteric  
Oh oh hey  
Oh oh hey  
Hysterical  
  
No wonder no wonder  
Other half strange steps  
Heels turned black  
The cinders they splinter  
And light the path  
These strange steps  
Trace us back trace us back  
  
Flow sweetly hang heavy  
You suddenly complete me  
You suddenly complete me  
Flow sweetly hang heavy  
You suddenly complete me  
You suddenly complete me  
  
Hysteric Repeats  
Hysterical
