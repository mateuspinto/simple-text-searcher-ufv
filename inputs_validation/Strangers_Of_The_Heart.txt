Through the mist on the harbor  
Dancing lights on the water  
Shadows move I see you smiling again  
When I reach out to touch you  
Like a ghost looking through me  
Sending chills deep into me  
Shattered dreams falling like  
Teardrops again  
As you make me remember  
  
Strangers of the heart  
Always safe with words unspoken  
Strangers of the heart  
Dont take chances theyll get broken  
No matter where you are  
Hear me tonight I dont want to be  
Strangers at heart  
  
Broken glass of my mirror  
Makes my eyes see much clearer  
You and I only a whisper away  
Never telling each other  
  
Strangers of the heart  
Always safe with words unspoken  
Strangers of the heart  
Dont take chances theyll get broken  
No matter where you are  
Hear me tonight I dont want to be  
Strangers at heart  
  
Strangers of the heart  
Always safe with words unspoken  
Strangers of the heart  
Dont take chances theyll get broken  
No matter where you are  
Hear me tonight I dont want to be  
Strangers at heart
