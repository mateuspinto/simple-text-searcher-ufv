Acapulco sun leaving work undone  
Dream about the nighttime till she comes  
Shell take my hand and walk with me  
Down along the sea  
Hear the pretty song she sings for free  
She sings songs of love so sweet oh so sweet  
And the words shes saying are so simple and complete  
I love you truly do  
  
Acapulco sun tells me shes the one  
Dream about the sunset till she comes  
Shell take my hand and walk with me  
Down along the sea  
Hear the pretty song she sings for free  
She sings songs of love so sweet oh so sweet  
And the words shes saying are so simple and complete  
I love you truly do  
  
Acapulco sun leaving work undone  
Dream about the night time till she comes
