Boy you make it hard you make it hard to leave  
Boy you make it hard youre no good for me  
  
Everyday every night you were out with your boys  
Getting high  
While I worked hard to pay the rent  
And my girls said I should lose you but I stuck with you  
Cause you promised to change  
  
What I gave you took nothing came in return  
But I I kept on giving baby  
Cause the sex was so good and your talk was so smooth  
That I I guess I bought it baby  
  
Now I finally see you were using me  
And Im taking my money my money my money back  
Get down on your knees begging me not to leave  
But Im taking my money my money my money back  
  
Im singing ooh ooh ooh and ah ah ah  
You know I really loved you boy  
Ooh ooh ooh and ah ah ah  
What a waste of a man so fine  
  
What about out about all your fooling around  
While I I had to cry about it  
Then you said youre sorry and you loved me only  
I should have left you right then  
  
Now I finally see you were using me  
And Im taking my money my money my money back  
Get down on your knees begging me not to leave  
But Im taking my money my money my money back  
  
Im singing ooh ooh ooh and ah ah ah  
You know I really loved you boy  
Ooh ooh ooh and ah ah ah  
What a waste of a man so fine  
  
Ooh ooh ooh and ah ah ah  
Give me back my heart give me back my time  
Ooh ooh ooh and ah ah ah  
What a waste of a woman so fine  
  
Now I finally see you were using me  
And Im taking my money my money my money back  
Get down on your knees begging me not to leave  
But Im taking my money my money my money back  
  
Ooh ooh ooh and ah ah ah  
Give me back my heart give me back my time  
Ooh ooh ooh and ah ah ah  
What a waste of a woman so fine  
  
Ooh ooh ooh and ah ah ah  
Give me back my heart give me back my time  
Ooh ooh ooh and ah ah ah  
What a waste of a woman so fine
