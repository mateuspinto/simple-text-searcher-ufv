The wind was driving in my face  
The smell of prickly pear  
My rival  show me my rival  
The milk truck eased into my space  
Somebody screamed somewhere  
I struck a match against the door  
Of Anthonys Bar and Grill  
I was the whining stranger  
A fool in love  
With time to kill  
  
Ive got detectives on his case  
They filmed the whole charade  
My rival  show me my rival  
Hes got a scar across his face  
He wears a hearing aid  
  
Sure hes a jolly roger  
Until he answers for his crime  
Yes Ill match him whim for whim now  
  
I still recall when I first held  
Your tiny hand in mine  
My rival show me my rival  
I loved you more than I can tell  
But now its stomping time  
  
Sure hes a jolly roger  
Until he answers for his crime  
Yes Ill match him whim for whim now
