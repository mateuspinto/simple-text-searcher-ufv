Now every cheap hood strikes a bargain with the world  
And ends up making payments on a sofa or a girl  
Love n hate tattooed across the knuckles of his hands  
Hands that slap his kids around cause they dont understand how  
  
Death or glory becomes just another story  
Death or glory becomes just another story  
  
N every gimmick hungry yob digging gold from rock n roll  
Grabs the mike to tell us hell die before hes sold  
But I believe in thisand its been tested by research  
He who fucks nuns will later join the church  
  
Death or glory becomes just another story  
Death or glory becomes just another story  
  
Fear in the down sex  
They say lie low  
You say okay  
Dont wanna play a show  
No other thinking  
Was it death or glory now  
Playing the blues of kings  
Sure looks better now  
  
Death or glory just another story  
Death or glory just another story  
  
From every dingy basement on every dingy street  
Every dragging handclap over every dragging beat  
Thats just the beat of timethe beat that must go on  
If youve been trying for years we already heard your song  
  
Death or glory becomes just another story  
Death or glory just another story  
  
Gotta launch long way  
Fight a long time  
Get to travel over mountains  
Got to travel over seas  
We gonna fight your brother  
We gonna fight til you loose  
We gonna raise trouble  
We gonna raise hell  
We gonna fight your brother  
We gonna raise hell  
  
Death or glory becomes just another story  
Death or glory becomes just another story  
  
Death or glory just another story  
Death or glory becomes just another story
