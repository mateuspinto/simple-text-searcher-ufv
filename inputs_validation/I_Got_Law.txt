Feeling daft beyond gone bland  
Made it to the goal on lense  
President he just got hair down below  
Tomorrow never more  
Made it to the BCP  
Everybody knows its me  
I got up another sand  
The guilty cell  
Tomorrow never more  
  
I Got The Law x23  
  
Feeling Dove beyond conpen Convict Penitentiary  
Nobody can take it there  
Feel it now and do yourself until youre gone  
Tomorrow never more  
Tomorrow never more
