Who set my heart  
Ever  drifting  
You from the start never lifting  
I fight it but it downs me  
Despite the joy around me  
I cant free myself from sorrow  
All through the day its a wonder  
Fall will the night still I wonder  
If Im the only  
Or are you as lonely  
Come home to me tomorrow  
Why should the past so change  
How you feel  
Oh but I ask you  
Forgive if you will  
These lonely hours are  
So hard to bear  
I dont deny that I was unfair  
You paid enough to be gay  
Who made me love you this way  
So give me the chance  
To renew our romance  
For this time I know it will stay  
Oh yes this time I know it will stay
