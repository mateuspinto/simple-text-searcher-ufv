I aint lookin for a reason  
I aint searchin for my soul  
Im findin all the answers  
Its the questions I dont know  
Seen it from the outside  
Outside lookin in  
Whats it like to be inside  
Will I ever stop payin for my sins  
Will I see the light of day  
When will all these dues be paid  
Send on down a sign to me  
Or am I too blind too see  
Ignorance and innocence go hand in hand  
Ignorance and innocence am I guilty man  
Yes I am  
Takin rides on a one way street to nowhere  
Im lookin for a sign I understand  
Passin time to save my mind  
Following that road that winds  
In and out of my own towns of hell  
Standin up or layin down  
My head goes spinnin round and round again  
My head is spinning head is spinning  
Ignorance
