The boy he thinks Im damaged goods  
I know he does and I guess he should  
I dress like him and I take him down  
He gets embarrassed when his friends come around  
  
I can get the girl  
But the boys just laugh  
I can get the girls  
But the boys just laugh  
  
So this is a measure of me  
Even though it shouldnt be  
The lion lays down with the lamb  
But I cant do it so I aint worth a damn  
  
I can get the girls  
But the boys just laugh  
I can get the girls  
But the boys just laugh at me  
  
Come on now graceful  
I want you to be  
Come on now social  
I said I want you to be  
Come on now special  
I I want you to be  
I want you to be  
  
I the virgin in the woods  
Tell me now if they are good  
  
Is it the boys who needed me  
I am you and you set it free  
  
I get the girls  
But the boys just laugh  
I get the girl  
But the boys he laughs at me  
  
I said this is the measure of me  
And even though it shouldnt be  
The lion lays down with the lamb  
Yeah but I cant do it and I aint worth a damn
