by Steve Millikan Adapted from the hymn That Beautiful Name  
chorus  
Jesus Jesus  
Oh what a beautiful name  
Jesus Jesus  
Forever will be the same  
I know of a name a beautiful name  
That angels brought down to earth  
To a maiden of lowly birth

I know of a name a beautiful name  
That unto a baby was given  
The stars glittered bright  
Throughout that glad night  
And angels praised God in heaven
