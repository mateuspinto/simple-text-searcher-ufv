Now that my life is normal  
Now that I got someone in home how dreams with me coming  
Now I can say that I am ok  
Now that I am good  
  
Now with the time I could get over  
That love that almost kill me  
Now there is no pain  
Now at last It is my again  
  
But I remember you  
And again I loose my peace  
But I remember you  
And my hart destroys  
  
But I remember you  
And my smiles erases  
But I remember you  
And my world destroys  
  
Now that my future begins to shine  
Now that got my security back  
Now there is no more pain  
Now at last its me again  
  
But I remember you  
And again I loose my peace  
But I remember you  
And my hart destroys  
  
But I remember you  
And my smiles erases  
But I remember you  
And my world destroys  
  
But I remember you  
And again I loose my peace  
But I remember you  
And my hart destroys  
  
But I remember you  
And my smiles erases  
But I remember you  
And my world destroys
