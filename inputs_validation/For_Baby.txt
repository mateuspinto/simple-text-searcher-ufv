Ill walk in the rain by your side  
Ill cling to the warmth of your hand  
Ill do anything to keep you satisfied  
Ill love you more than anybody can  
  
And the wind will whisper your name to me  
Little birds will sing along in time  
Leaves will bow down when you walk by  
And morning bells will chime  
  
Ill be there when youre feelin down  
To kiss away the fears if you cry  
Ill share with you all the happiness Ive found  
A reflection of the love in your eyes  
  
And Ill sing you the songs of the rainbow  
A whisper of the joy that is mine  
And leaves will bow down when you walk by  
And morning bells will chime  
  
Ill walk in the rain by your side  
Ill cling to the warmth of your tiny hand  
Ill do anything to help you understand  
And Ill love you more than anybody can  
  
And the wind will whisper your name to me  
Little birds will sing along in time  
Leaves will bow down when you walk by  
And morning bells will chime
