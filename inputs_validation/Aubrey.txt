And Aubrey was her name  
And not so very ordinary girl or name  
But whos to blame  
For a love that wouldnt bloom  
For the hearts that never played in tune   
  
Like a lovely melody  
That everyone can sing  
Take away the words that rhyme  
It doesnt mean a thing  
  
And Aubrey was her name  
We tripped the light  
And danced together to the moon  
But where was June  
No it never came around  
If it did it never made a sound  
Maybe I was absent  
Or was listening too fast  
Catching all the words  
But then the meaning going past  
  
Oh how I miss the girl  
And Id go a thousand times around the world  
Just to be  
Closer to her than to me  
  
And Aubrey was her name  
I never knew her  
But I loved her just the same  
I loved her name  
  
Wish that I had found a way  
And the reasons that would make her stay  
I have learned to lead a life  
Apart from all the rest  
If I cant have the one I want  
Ill go without the best  
  
Oh how I miss the girl  
And Id go a million times around the world  
Just to say  
She had been mine for a day
