May the good Lord be with you  
Down every road you roam  
And may sunshine and happiness  
Surround you when youre far from home  
And may you grow to be pround  
Dignified and true  
And do unto others  
As youd have done to you  
Be courageous and be brave  
And in my heart youll always stay  
Forever young forever young  
Forever young forever young  
May good fortune be with you  
May your guiding light be strong  
Build a stairway to heaven  
With a prince or a vagabond  
And may you never love in vain  
And in my heart you will remain  
Forever Young forever young  
Forever Young forever Young  
Forever Young  
Forever Young  
And when you finally fly away  
Ill be hoping that I served you well  
For all the wisdom of a lifetime  
No one can ever tell  
But whatever road you choose  
Im right behind you win or lose  
Forever Young Forever Young  
Forever Young Forever Young  
Forever Young Forever Young  
For forever young forever Young
