Chorus  
Fresh fire let it fall  
O God hear our call  
Send Your Spirit like a rushing wind  
We need fresh fire  
  
We are hungry we are thirsty  
Crying our for more of You  
Lord we are desperate for Your mercy  
Let us burn to know Your Truth  
Light a flame in us now  
Send Your holy fire down  
  
We have left our hearts unguarded  
We confess weve walked away  
Lord take us back to where we started  
Where we first found love and grace  
Light a flame in us now  
Send Your holy fire down  
  
More of Your love  
More of Your power  
Send a revival  
We need it now  
Stir up a fire  
Let it burn brighter  
Let the flame burn higher higher higher  
  
Revive us again
