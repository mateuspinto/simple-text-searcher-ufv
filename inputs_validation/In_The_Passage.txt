Theres a ring around the moon tonight and a chill in the air  
And a fire in the stars that hang so near so near  
Theres a sound in the wind that blows through the wild mountain holds  
Like the sighs of a thousand crying souls crying souls  
Theres a time when the traveler is fated to find  
That insight has turned his gaze behind behind  
And the steps taken yesterday will beckon again  
And lead to his weary journeys end his journeys end  
And in the passage from the cradle to the grave we are born madly dancing  
Rushing headlong through the crashing of the days  
We run on and on without a backwards glance  
We run on and on without a backwards glance  
I cast my fate with the wife of Lot I turned my gaze around  
Knowing neither what I sought nor what was to be found  
Heeding weakness feeding strength oh life at length is frail  
I seek again the rivers source through times dark shadowed veil  
In the fast fading century as we spin through the years  
I pray that our failing vision clears our vision clears  
And in the passage from the cradle to the grave we are born madly dancing  
Rushing headlong through the crashing of the days  
We run on and on without a backwards glance  
We run on and on without a backwards glance  
The places dash and the faces dart like fishes in a dream  
Hiding neath the murky banks of long forgotten streams  
The lines of life are never long when seen from end to end  
The futures never coming and the past has never been  
Theres a ring around the moon tonight and a chill in the air  
And a fire in the stars that hang so near so near
