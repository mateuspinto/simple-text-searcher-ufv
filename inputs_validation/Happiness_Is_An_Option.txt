It is not easy  
It is not easy  
  
Looking from a window  
At the back of a house  
At the edge of a town  
Its gray  
Like the day  
When I lost it  
Clouds overhead  
I talked to a flower  
That was almost dead  
My body a prison  
Why did I do it  
Someone told me not to  
But still went through it  
  
Chorus  
It is not easy  
But dont give up now  
It is not easy  
Happiness is an option  
  
Needed somewhere to clear  
My head  
Find some strength  
A warmer bed  
Maximum love in a  
Minimal world  
Id never achieved it  
But then I believed it  
So when I lost it how  
Im not sure now  
It was a strange feeling  
Like a paw repealing itself  
  
Chorus x2  
  
I can wake up in the morning  
And not believe what I see  
Look in the mirror  
And think if thats really me  
I dont think I suit my face  
Its not a catastrophe  
Its more a philosophy  
Like the Russians  
Wondering why  
Were born under a blue sky  
But die in a dark forest  
  
Chorus x2  
  
This is neither old nor new  
Its always forever  
Somewhere between sense  
And ambition  
Pleasure and decision  
We have to make a choice  
What do we want  
Everyone singing  
War what is it good for  
While planning the next one  
  
I dont need to win  
You dont have to lose  
We can choose  
Happiness is an option  
  
It is not easy  
But dont give up now  
It is not easy  
Happiness is an option  
  
It is not easy  
The war within us  
But it gets easier  
The more we learn  
I dont need to win  
You dont need to lose  
We can choose  
Happiness is an option  
  
It is not easy  
But dont give up now  
It is not easy  
Happiness is an option  
I dont need to win  
You dont need to lose  
We can choose  
Happiness is an option
