Hey people are you ready to get in the streets  
To be your own police  
Are you ready to start tonight  
To stand up and fight for your rights  
  
Chorus  
Woah  oh I gotta know  
I gotta know  
I gotta know  
I gotta know  
  
Young people would you do the patriotic thing  
Are you ready to stand up and sing  
That youre tired of the war and all that shit  
Oh tell me are you ready to do your bit  
  
Chorus  
  
You gotta take a stand  
Give your brother a helping hand  
We got to start today  
So tomorrow our kids can play  
We better do whats right  
So we dont have to fight  
No more  
  
bout the only way I see that we can change the plan  
Is to vote and get our man  
The man whose not afraid  
And one whose not overpaid  
  
Chorus  
  
You gotta take a stand  
Give your brother a helping hand  
We got to start today  
So tomorrow our kids can play  
We better do whats right  
So we dont have to fight  
No more
