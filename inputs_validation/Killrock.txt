Time to see God in the future now  
Because everything dies babe  
Get a skull in the back of my car  
KILLROCK  
  
Ha ha ha ha  
You stay away from me  
Oooohhh  
Oooohh  
  
KILLROCK  
  
Get back to the pain in the back of my car  
Killrocks a problem but you have died  
Say yourself youre sleeping here  
  
KILLROCK  
  
Pay me for ours  
Killrock  
Killrock  
Yeah ha ha
