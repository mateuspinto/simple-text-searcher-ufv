Healing is difficult  
Often results in psychosomatic  
I admit to enjoying drugs  
They get rid of tension boredom and static  
Hate those adverse side effects  
Forcing the people who love me to scatter  
Excuse me for being such a hypocrite  
The way I see it really doesnt matter  
  
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me  
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity

To tell you the truth  
I cant believe I love you so much  
So much in fact that I dont know whether to weep or wind my watch  
I have a sick sense of humor  
It amazes me how points it scores  
Im addicted to vice  
My best friends are pushers my boyfriends are whores  
  
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me  
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity  
  
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me

Simple to see why I breathe  
No one bothers me completely

Waking up next to you  
Your morning breath reminds me of Lucy  
The flies in the front room  
Buzz round my head and try to seduce me  
If I contract illness  
The last thing I want is to pass it to others  
Fucking leaves guilt pangs  
When I start forgetting the names of my lovers  
  
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me  
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity  
  
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me
