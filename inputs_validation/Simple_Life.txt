Days feel so long  
My life seems short as years go by  
The chance that I took  
Feeling so strong I had to try  
All of the pain I left behind  
  
Been down the road  
My heart has been sold  
The price was steep  
The world that we have  
The wish that we made is ours to keep  
  
All of our emotions are so deep  
Cuz I cant stop falling in love with you  
  
All I want is a simple life  
All I really want is you  
All I want all I need  
Is a simple life
