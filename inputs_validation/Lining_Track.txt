Mo boys is you right

Angels working on the chariot wheel

Mary and the babe was a sittin in the shade  
Thinking on the money that I aint made

Moses stood on the Red Sea shore  
Gotta batten down the waves with a two by four

Now if I could I surely would  
Stand on the rock where Moses stood

All them disciples dead and gone

Mo boys is you right

All I hate about lining track  
These ol boys about to break my back  
  
Chorus
