The only thing that ll move me now is a fast song  
Song long and barely known  
And I dont wanna hear no crying all gone wrong song  
Kick it off and lets all pick a fast song  
Now dont go bringing singing strumming me no slow tune  
Stay away from all that moon and june sprune groome tune  
Throw me one thats flying and Ill hang on  
Ill come in on my part on a fast song  
Dideldiedie  
  
Well it dont have to have a banjo or mandelin  
But let it in if it wants in  
Keep the rosin handed and the horse there tough and tight  
Pick it up and Im lyable to pick all night  
Now dont go bringing singing strumming me no slow tune  
Stay away from all that moon and june sprune groome tune  
Throw me one thats flying and Ill hang on  
Ill come in on my part on a fast song  
Repeat last verse but a little faster
