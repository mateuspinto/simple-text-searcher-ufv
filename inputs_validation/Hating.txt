My life is such a waste  
Begging on something to work this time  
But why cant I relate  
Feeling all I do is get whats mine  
Holding on to faith  
Never gave me nothing but despair  
So why do I create just to be swallowed  
I cant take  
We have a star  
I cant take  
We got a fantasy  
Come what may  
We are the stars  
I cant wait  
Ill take whats mine  
  
Been hating all this time before a crowd inside  
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find  
Been hating all this time too far to cross the line  
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find  
  
I cannot leave this place  
Burning up inside this space of mine  
But why cant I replace feelings I find hard to really find  
I try but I cant taste  
Memories they always fuck with me  
So why do I create just to be swallowed  
  
I cant take  
We have a star  
I cant take  
We got a fantasy  
Come what may  
We are the stars  
I cant wait  
Ill take whats mine  
  
Been hating all this time before a crowd inside  
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find  
Been hating all this time too far to cross the line  
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find  
  
All my feelings have been eating all of me  
Feed inside  
Is there something wrong with me  
  
I cant take  
We have a star  
I cant take  
We got a fantasy  
Come what may  
We are the stars  
I cant wait  
Ill take whats mine  
  
Been hating all this time before a crowd inside  
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find  
Been hating all this time too far to cross the line  
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find
