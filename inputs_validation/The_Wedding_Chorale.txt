Marius and Cosette lead a wedding procession  
  
Chorus  
Ring out the bells upon this day of days  
May all the angels of the Lord above  
In jubilation sing their songs of praise  
And crown this blessed time with peace and love  
  
The procession becomes a dancing celebration A waltz is played  
  
Major Domo  
The Baron and Baroness de Thenard wish to pay their  
Respects to the groom  
  
Thenardier  
I forget where we met  
Was it not at the Chateau Lafarge  
Where the duke did that puke  
Down the Duchesss decolletage  
  
Marius  
No Baron de Thenard  
The circles I move in are humbler by far  
Go away Thenardier  
Do you think I dont know who you are  
  
Mme Thenardier  
Hes not fooled told you so  
Show Msieur what youve come here to show  
Tell the boy what you know  
  
Applause from the dancers as the waltz finishes  
  
Marius  
When I look at you I remember Eponine  
She was more than you deserved who gave her birth  
But now she is with God and happier I hope  
Than here on earth  
  
The waltz starts up again  
  
Thenardier  
So it goes heaven knows  
Life has dealt me some terrible blows  
  
Mme Thenardier  
Youve got cash and a heart  
You could give us a bit of a start  
We can prove plain as ink  
Your brides father is not what you think  
  
Thenardier  
Theres a tale I could tell  
  
Mme Thenardier  
Information were willing to sell  
  
Thenardier  
Theres a man that he slew  
I saw the corpse clear as Im seeing you  
What I tell you is true  
  
Mme Thenardier  
Pity to disturb you at a feast like this  
But five hundred francs surely wouldnt come amiss  
  
Marius  
In Gods name say what you have to say  
  
Thenardier  
But first you pay  
  
What I saw clear as light  
Jean Valjean in the sewers that night  
Had this corpse on his back  
Hanging there like a great bloody sack  
I was there never fear  
Even found me this fine souvenir  
  
Thenardier shows Marius a ring  
  
Marius  
I know this This was mine  
Surely this is some heavenly sign  
  
Thenardier  
One more thing mark this well  
It was the night the barricades fell  
  
Marius  
Then its true then Im right  
Jean Valjean was my savior that night  
  
Marius hits Thenardier and then throws money at him  
  
As for you take this too  
God forgive the things that we do  
  
Come my love come Cosette  
This days blessings are not over yet  
  
Marius and Cosette leave
