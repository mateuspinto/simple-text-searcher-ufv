LEARNING TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU  
I first felt it when I hit my teens  
Some things were changing  
It was deep inside of me  
I saw the Beatles and my body began to shake  
I started talking to the girl next door  
And she looked different than she ever did before  
And she was saying things that  
I could never tell  
So I was searching for the way in crowd  
With winklepickers and the music playing loud  
But all the kissing came from listening to If I Fell I was   
CHORUS  
Learning to make love to you  
Ill do what you want me to  
Learning to make love to you  
Ill do what you want me to  
While we were grooving out Rubber Soul  
I was learning how to lose control  
I needed someone that was certain to hold me tight  
We were dancing until quarter to  
I missed the bus and so I turned to you  
I had the feeling that everything would be alright I was   
CHORUS  
Everyone meets a new generation  
When the time is right  
All the kids want is an explanation  
When they say goodnight  
I can see you and me are just one to one and  
CHORUS
