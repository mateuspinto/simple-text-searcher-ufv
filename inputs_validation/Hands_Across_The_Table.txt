Hands across the table while the lights are low  
Though you hush your lips your finger tips  
Tell me what I want to know  
Hands across the table meet so tenderly  
And they say in their little way  
That you belong to me  
Hands across the table while the lights are low  
Though you hush your lips your finger tips  
Tell me all I want to know  
Hands across the table meet so tenderly  
And they say in their little way  
That you belong to me
