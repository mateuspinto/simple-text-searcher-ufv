Ohh theres a lull in my life  
Its just a void an empty space  
When you are not in my embrace  
  
Ohh theres a lull in my life  
The moment that you go away  
There is no night there is no day  
  
The clock stops ticking  
The world stops turning everything stops  
But the flame in my heart  
That keeps burning burning  
  
Ohh theres a lull in my life  
No matter how I may pretend  
I know that you alone can end  
  
The ache in my heart  
The call of my arms  
The lull in my life  
  
Oh the clock it stops ticking  
And the world just stops turning everything stops  
But the flame in my heart  
That keeps burning burning  
  
Oh theres a lull in my life  
No matter how I may pretend  
I know that you alone can end  
  
This ache in my heart  
The call of my arms  
The lull in my life  
Theres a lull in my life
