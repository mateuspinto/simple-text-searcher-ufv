Poor Jud is daid  
Poor Jud Fry is daid  
All gather round his coffin now and cry  
He had a heart of gold  
And he wasnt very old  
Oh why did such a fella have to die  
  
Poor Jud is daid  
Poor Jud Fry is daid  
Hes looking oh so peaceful and serene  
  
And serene  
  
Hes all laid down to rest  
With his hands across his chest  
His fingernails have never looked so clean  
  
And then the preacherd get up and hed say Folks we are gathered  
Here to mourn and growl our brother Jud Fry who hung himself up  
By a rope in a smokehouse and then we have been weepin and  
Wailin within some of the women  And then hed say Jud was the  
Most misunderstood man in the territory People used to think he was  
A mean ugly fella and they called him a dirty skunk and a northern  
Pig stealer  
  
But the folks that really knowed Im  
Knowed that neath those dirty shirts he always wore  
There beated a heart as big as all outdoors  
  
As big as all outdoors  
  
Jud Fry loved his fellow man  
  
He loved his fellow man  
  
He loved the birds of the forest  
And the bees of the field  
He loved the mice and the vermin in the barn  
And he treated the rats like equals which he knew was right  
And he loved the little children  
He loved everybody and everything in the world  
Only he never let on so nobody ever noticed  
  
Poor Jud is Daid  
Poor Jud Fry is daid  
His friends all weep and wail from miles around  
  
Miles around  
  
The daisies in the dell will give out a different smell  
Because poor Jud is underneath the ground  
  
Poor Jud is daid the candle lights his head  
Hes layin in a coffin made of wood  
  
Wood  
  
And folks are feelin sad cause they used to treat him bad  
Now they know their friend has gone for good  
  
Good  
  
Poor Jud is daid a candle lights his head  
Hes lookin oh so pretty and so nice  
He looks like hes asleep  
Its a shame that he wont keep  
But its summer and were runinng out of ice  
  
Poor Jud Poor Jud
