Great rain great rain  
I thought I heard you call my name  
Great rain great rain  
I thought I heard you call my name  
I was standing in the station  
Waving down an unmarked train  
Theres a fire at the junction  
Why do you do the things you do  
Theres a fire at the junction  
Why do you do the things you do  
I was praying for mercy  
And all he ever sent me was you  
Jimmy bought the liquor  
I bought the cups and ice  
Jimmy bought the liquor  
I bought the cups and ice  
I tell you funny stories  
Why cant you treat me nice  
Great rain great rain  
I thought I heard you call my name  
Great rain great rain  
I thought I heard you calling my name  
I was standing by the river  
Talking to a young mark twain
