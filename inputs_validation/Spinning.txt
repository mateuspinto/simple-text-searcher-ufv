Was it loneliness that brought you here  
Broken and weak  
Was it tiredness that made you sleep  
Have you lost your will to speak  
Was the earth spinning round  
Were you falling through the ground  
As the world came tumbling down  
You prayed to God what have we done  
  
Free me from these chains I need to change my way  
Heal these broken wings I need to fly far away far away far away  
  
Was it emptiness that made you weep  
No more secrets to keep  
Was it bitterness that gave you time  
To forgive your sins  
Was the earth spinning round  
Were you falling through the ground  
As the world came tumbling down  
You prayed to God what have we done  
  
Free me from these chains I need to change my way  
Heal these broken wings I need to fly far away  
Free me from these thoughts long forgotten down below  
Take these angels words give them life to carry on carry on carry on  
Free me from these chains
