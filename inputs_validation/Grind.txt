In the darkest hole youd be well advised  
Not to plan my funeral fore the body dies yeah  
Come the morning light its a see through show  
What you may have heard and what you think you know yeah  
  
Let the sun never blind your eyes  
Let me sleep so my teeth wont grind  
Hear a sound from a voice inside  
  
Sure to play a part so you love the game  
And in truth your lies become one and same yeah  
I could set you free rather hear the sound  
Of your body breaking as I take you down yeah  
  
Let the sun never blind your eyes  
Let me sleep so my teeth wont grind  
Hear a sound from a voice inside  
  
In the darkest hole youd be well advised  
Not to plan my funeral fore the body dies yeah  
  
Let the sun never blind your eyes  
Let me sleep so my teeth wont grind  
Hear a sound from a voice inside  
  
Let the sun never blind your eyes  
Let me sleep so my teeth wont grind  
Hear a sound from a voice inside
