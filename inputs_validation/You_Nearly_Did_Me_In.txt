See lonely shadows  silver needles  
Abandoned in the evening war  
Lost children of the night  come catch the candle bright  
I hear a hollow sound  falling to the ground  shes lost before shes found  
  
Sad broken angels takin rainbows  
Out on the street for all to see  
If we are the chosen few  what ever happened to  
All those things we knew if this is being free   
Id rather search for me  
  
You nearly did you nearly did you nearly did  
You nearly did me in you nearly did me in  
And I need some place to hide  my weary anger down  
  
Out on some misty distant highway  
Feel like I though a million miles  
Is my search nearly done  I think I see someone  
I get the urge to run on blindly through the rain  
and I fool myself again  
  
You nearly did you nearly did you nearly did  
You nearly did me in you nearly did me in  
And I need some place to hide  my weary anger down  
  
What ever happened to dignity  
What ever happened to integrity  
What ever happened to honesty  
Well Ill tell you something baby  I feel the pain just like the sea  
  
You nearly did you nearly did you nearly did  
You nearly did me in you nearly did me in  
And I need some place to hide  my weary anger down
