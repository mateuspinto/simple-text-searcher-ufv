Oh me and my cousin one Arthur McBride  
As we went awalkin down by the seaside  
Mark now what followed and what did betide  
For it bein on Christmas mornin  
Now for recreation we went on a tramp  
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp  
And a little wee drummer intending to camp  
For the day bein pleasant and charmin  
  
Good morning good morning the Sergeant he cried  
And the same to you gentlemen we did reply  
Intending no harm but meant to pass by  
For it bein on Christmas mornin  
But says he My fine fellows if you will enlist  
Ten guineas in gold Ill stick to your fist  
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust  
And drink the kings health in the morning  
  
For a soldier he leads a very fine life  
And he always is blessed with a charming young wife  
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife  
And he always lives pleasant and charmin  
And a soldier he always is decent and clean  
In the finest of clothing hes constantly seen  
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean  
And sup on thin gruel in the morning  
  
But says Arthur I wouldnt be proud of your clothes  
For youve only the lend of them as I suppose  
But you dare not change them one night for you know  
If you do youll be flogged in the morning  
And although that were single and free  
We take great delight in our own company  
We have no desire strange places to see  
Although that your offers are charming  
  
And we have no desire to take your advance  
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance  
For youd have no scruples for to send us to France  
Where we would get shot without warning  
Oh no says the Sergeant Ill have no such chat  
And neither will I take it from snappy young brats  
For if you insult me with one other word  
Ill cut off your heads in the morning  
  
And Arthur and I we soon drew our hogs  
And we scarce gave them time to draw their own blades  
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head  
And bid them take that as fair warning  
And their old rusty rapiers that hung by their sides  
We flung them as far as we could in the tide  
Now take them up devils cried Arthur McBride  
And temper their edge in the mornin  
  
And the little wee drummer we flattened his bow  
And we made a football of his rowdydowdow  
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll  
And bade it a tedious returning  
And we havin no money paid them off in cracks  
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs  
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks  
And left them for dead in the morning  
  
And so to conclude and to finish disputes  
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits  
For we were the lads who would give them hard clouts  
And bid them look sharp in the mornin  
  
Oh me and my cousin one Arthur McBride  
As we went awalkin down by the seaside  
Mark now what followed and what did betide  
For it bein on Christmas mornin
