Got a call from my friend  
She saw my picture again  
In a magazine  
We laughed out loud  
Cuz she said remeber when  
This was all a silly dream  
Now I wake up every day  
In a different city  
A smile on my face  
Somebody pinch me  
She said all the worlds a satge  
But girl you know  
Those cameras and lights  
Wont ever change me  
  
I dont drink champagne  
When Im back home with my friends  
We sip on tea on the porch  
Cuz Im still the girl next door  
No fancy things when I come off tour  
I slip back into my jeans  
Cuz Im still the girl next door  
  
Its amazin to hear people singin along  
Hear the radio playin my song  
I still get butterflies  
Still get nervous inside  
In the spotlight  
  
Now every now n then  
On a friday night  
Cruisin down to the dive bar  
We waste the night away  
Spend saturday sleepin in late  
Those were the good days  
  
I dont drink champagne  
When Im back home with my friends  
We sip on tea on the porch  
Cuz Im still the girl next door  
No fancy things when I come off tour  
I slip back into my jeans  
Cuz Im still the girl next door  
  
And even when Im miles away  
Ill always have the roots from where I came  
Cuz when it all fades away  
My home will still be the same  
  
Yeah eh  
Yeah  
  
I dont drink champagne  
When Im back home with my friends  
We sip on tea on the porch  
Cuz Im still the girl next door  
No fancy things when I come off tour  
I slip back into my jeans  
Cuz Im still the girl next door
