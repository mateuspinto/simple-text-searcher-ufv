O ladybird  
I have heard you wish to walk me through your garden  
I crave your pardon if I woke you with my thinking  
Ladybird  
  
O ladybird  
I have heard you wish to walk me through your meadow  
Youll spread no wings to fly in fright if Im beside you  
Ladybird  
  
All through the winter time  
When wood was warm and splintered  
Time seemed longer than a goods train  
Now that spring is back again Ill ask your name  
Your name  
  
O ladybird  
I have heard you wish to walk across my pillow  
No weeping willow was ever as beautiful sad as you are  
Ladybird  
  
And as youre walking past  
Im laying on the grass and making chains of thought  
To snare you with my wit  
But bit by bit you fade to gone  
Gone  
  
All through the iron season  
Love was hanged and treason became  
Something of a parlour game  
Now sun is back in power Ill ask your name  
Your name  
  
O ladybird  
I have heard you have to run to tend your children  
No flood can drown nor fire blacken purest longing  
For ladybird  
Ladybird
