And the lamb lies down on Broadway  
  
Early morning Manhattan  
Ocean winds blow on the land  
The MoviePalace is now undone  
The allnight watchmen have had their fun  
Sleeping cheaply on the midnight show  
Its the same old endingtime to go  
Get out  
It seems they cannot leave their dream  
Theres something moving in the sidewalk steam  
And the lamb lies down on Broadway  
  
Nightimes flyers feel their pains  
Drugstore takes down the chains  
Metal motion comes in bursts  
But the gas station can quench that thirst  
Suspension cracked on unmade road  
The truckers eyes read Overload  
And out on the subway  
Rael Imperial Aerosol Kid  
Exits into daylight spraygun hid  
And the lamb lies down on Broadway  
  
The lamb seems right out of place  
Yet the Broadway street scene finds a focus in its face  
Somehow its lying there  
Brings a stillness to the air  
Though manmade light at night is very bright  
Theres no whitewash victim  
As the neons dim to the coat of white  
Rael Imperial Aerosol Kid  
Wipes his gunhes forgotten what he did  
And the lamb lies down on Broadway  
  
Suzanne tired her work all done  
Thinks moneyhoneybe onneon  
Cabmans velvet glove sounds the horn  
And the sawdust king spits out his scorn  
Wonder women draw your blind  
Dont look at me Im not your kind  
Im Rael  
Something inside me has just begun  
Lord knows what I have done  
And the lamb lies down on Broadway  
On Broadway  
They say the lights are always bright on Broadway  
They say theres always magic in the air
