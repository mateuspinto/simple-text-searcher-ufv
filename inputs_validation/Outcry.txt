Somewhere overhead  
Distant thunder roars  
The revolution has begun  
The war to end all wars  
  
As I welcome death  
I hear the battle cry  
Bullets fall like fire  
Raining from the sky  
  
The rebel in us all  
Someday gets tired of being pushed around  
But freedom has a price  
The cost is buried in the ground  
  
We suffered far too long  
We gather now growing stronger  
We will not be ignored  
Anymore any longer  
Our anthem will guide us  
  
Rise up be counted  
Stand strong and unite  
Wait for the outcry  
Resistance is calling tonight  
  
Far too many years  
Of chaos and unrest  
Far too many voices  
Brutally suppressed  
  
We fight for what is just  
For all that we believe  
We fight till death or glory  
Fight to be set free  
  
The streets are bathed in blood  
Time to step down and time to walk away  
Youll never rule me now  
Though you may stand upon my grave  
  
You can look the other way  
Or you can face the light  
Although it seems so far away  
Freedoms worth the fight  
  
Rise up be counted  
Stand strong and unite  
Wait for the outcry  
Resistance is calling  
  
Rise up be counted  
Stand strong and unite  
Wait for the outcry  
Resistance is calling tonight  
  
The world watches on  
While we risk our lives  
Locked in a kingdom of fear  
As our children die
