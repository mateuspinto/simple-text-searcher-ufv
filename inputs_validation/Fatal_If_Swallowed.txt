Lust is the fire which warms you in the night  
Scorching the edge of your soul  
I am desire your eyes are filled with light  
Pleasing the master your goal  
Like a fly to a spider against my web you fight  
My poison dousing your flame  
Call on the liar to fill the hole with light  
Your feelings went as I came  
  
Fatal if swallowed my loves too much to hold  
A deadly poison a hot and heavy load  
Fatal if swallowed a love you cant resist  
Another believer sealed with a kiss  
  
Animal attraction the numbing of your flesh  
No reason to let this action wait  
Your physical convulsions the quiver of your lips  
Open up ahh take the bait  
You taste it revolting wishing you were dead  
The effect youll never grow old  
Oozing slime foaming at the mouth  
So dizzy the poison takes its toll  
  
No protection forced injection  
Feel the bite feel the sting  
No detection slow infection  
Now you know what good lovin brings  
  
Are you a believer or are you just a corpse  
A worm eaten mass of disgust  
Yeah Im a deceiver the reaper a letch  
The reason your driven by lust  
But your not the first you wont be the last  
I lead others will follow  
No mercy forgiveness no begging for reprieve  
My venom fatal if swallowed  
  
Oh with a kiss  
Fatal Kiss this  
  
Open up wide Im comin inside
