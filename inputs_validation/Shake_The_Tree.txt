Id love to take this lying down  
But the world we know has lost its crown  
All night talk an jazz cigarettes  
Is never gonna change this killer town  
I see her walking  
In perfect time  
She gives me reason  
To carry on  
  
Round the corner comes salvation  
Made to order is what you found  
Why oh why do we fool ourselves  
Is it just the need to carry on  
  
I see her walking  
In perfect time  
She gives me reason  
To carry on  
  
Shake the tree you find  
Shake dont cut it down  
  
Glamour takes its toll on you  
Throw away whats out of view  
Pearls of wisdom hang around your neck  
They warm to the touch of your perfect skin  
  
High high high  
High high high  
  
I see her walking  
In perfect time  
She gives me reason  
To carry on  
  
Shake the tree you find  
Shake dont cut it down  
  
Shake the tree you find I see her walking in perfect time  
Shake dont cut it down she gives me reason  
  
To carry on  
  
I see her walking  
In perfect time  
She gives me reason  
To never say die  
  
I see her walking  
In perfect time shake  
She gives me reason the tree you find  
To never say die
