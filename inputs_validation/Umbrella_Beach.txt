Stands and gears oh how the daisies bloom  
When chandeliers light up the engine room  
Can you feel the drops as it starts to rain  
Theres an underwater Ferris wheel where  
I found the missing link to this island chain  
  
Home will always be here unseen out of sight  
Where I disappear and hide  
I think dreamy things as Im waving goodbye  
So Ill spread out my wings and fly  
  
Home is a boxcar and its so far out of reach  
Hidden under umbrella beach  
  
Home will always be here unseen out of sight  
Where I disappear and hide  
I think dreamy things as Im waving goodbye  
So Ill spread out my wings and fly  
  
Ill spread my wings and fly  
  
Home is a boxcar and its so far out of reach  
Hidden under umbrella beach
