Get your son  young n dumb  
Give him a gun  make him run  
Hot stuff  on a Saturday night  
Wait a minute  this aint right  
  
Its that same old story  
Talkin bout the death n glory boys  
When your head is on the scaffold  
N your ass is on the line  
You gotta give it that old religion  
One mo time  
Get the death n glory boys  
  
Midnight  no light  
Cool sand  like mud in my hands  
Got this feelin  in my hair  
Whats that movin  I aint a scared  
  
Its that same old story  
Freak out with the death n glory boys  
When its down to stealing apples  
N you been doin time  
They can buy the hero in you  
For a dime  
Youre a death n glory boy  
  
Youd better pack up your troubles  
In your old kit bag  
Say goodbye to your mother  
Shes the only friend you have  
  
Long live the leaders  
Long may they reign  
May they live long enough  
To feel every single pain  
  
They dont care about the widows  
They dont give no reasons why  
They just keep on making medals  
You can buy  
  
From the death n glory boys
