In a long and involved conversation with myself  
I saw a precious thing come into view  
When I poured through the files taken off my mental shelf  
I dusted off some memories of you  
  
Then I thought about the times  
When all the world was green  
How the Pheonix of our love first flapped its silver wings  
All the urgency and passion of each new day as it happened  
And how it all mellowed as it grew  
  
I remember the times that our laughter would explode  
And how you would turn to hide your smile  
Then the hours of silence while the perfumed candle glowed  
And both of us meandered on for miles  
  
I remember the time I said I really had to go  
I remember the tears that filled your eyes  
Then I touched your hand and told you that it really was a lie  
And though you never knew I did I cried  
  
Its amazing how time can so softly change your ways  
And make you look at things that cant be seen  
How the years that roll by can start you listening  
Not just to what they say but what they mean  
  
So forgive me my dear if I seem preoccupied  
If the razor edge of youth filled love is gone  
But were both a little older our relationship has grown  
Not just in how its shaped but how its shown  
  
So forgive me my dear if I seem preoccupied  
If the razor edge of youth filled love is gone  
But were both a little older and our relationship has grown  
Not just in how its shaped but how its shown
