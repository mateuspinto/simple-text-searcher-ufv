I wish Id never loved you  
I wish Id never wanted you so much  
And never thrilled to your touch  
And I would not be lonely and crying  
And hurting deep inside  
Alone with a need that cant be satisfied  
  
I wish Id never loved you  
I wish Id never given you my heart  
And watch you tear it all apart  
And I would not be tortured tormented and cheated  
And surely my heart would not be broken in two  
  
I saw you with another  
I watched you hold her tenderly  
And I could see as you kissed her  
Youd never come back to me oh  
  
I wish Id never loved you mmm  
I wish youd never burned me with your kiss  
Oh how can I go on like this  
And I would not be tortured tormented and cheated  
How I wish Id never loved you  
  
And I could see as you kissed her  
Youd never come back to me  
  
Oh I wish Id never loved you  
I wish youd never burned me with your kiss  
Oh how can I go on like this  
And I would not be tortured tormented and cheated  
How I wish Id never loved you  
Oh I wish Id never loved you  
How I wish Id never no no never  
Id never loved you
