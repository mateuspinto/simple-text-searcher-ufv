Alone in their destination  
Wandering thru this violent life  
A part of all misconception from their past  
And now thrown out to the street to rot  
Painful screams never heard  
Hung on the wings of death  
Germs are what they seem  
For the rich they have no need  
Left in the cold in crucial places  
Feeling the horrors of real life  
Places to places no where to go  
Agonizing pain and no one seems to care  
Trying to revive em for a higher place  
But no one seems to give any support  
They hear their torment call  
Disarmed from an endless war  
Aimed by all kinds of poverty  
Vagabonds you will find in types of societies  
Resting in the underground of this materialistic  
Inferno  
Chorus  
Mortify  
In hostility of human injustice  
Some say that theyre not concerned  
But never willing to take their burdens  
Lets hope its not your skin  
Which is rotting of sins  
Chorus  
Mortify  
In hostility of human injustice  
They are living in a world of darkness  
In which the light seems far away  
No justice  
Blamed for someone elses deed  
Humiliation  
Because they are poor  
Treated harshly  
Is this what they call the advancement of mankind  
Why men want to rule the space  
While they cant even solve the problems of the earth  
Where is our humane sense now  
So much said but so little done  
Blinded and devoured by our greed  
Facing all the worries of our minds  
We cant feel what is happening in the world around us  
Turbulence is the conflict which we all must face  
Crossing the line of stupidity and discrimination  
Is one of the reasons which makes us ignore  
The actual state of the moribund  
Breaking down their hope to piece  
Destitution increases in front of their own miserable lives  
Chorus  
Mortify  
In hostility of human injustice  
Days passed  
Injured ones dying fast  
Harsh temperatures  
The whips of cold winds  
Are frosting their bodies on the attack  
Feeling the rigor mortis stage alive  
Reaching to the ultimate muscular paralysis
