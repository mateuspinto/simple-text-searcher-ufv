Ohh ooh ooh oh yeah  
  
Used to be calm  
Used to be cool  
But something about you  
Changed all the rules  
I kept to myself  
I guarded my heart  
But that all fell apart  
  
Now just like a fool  
Ive fallen in love with you oh  
I got these crazy feelings  
All over you oh  
  
I come undone  
I come undone  
Every time Im close to you  
I come undone  
I come undone  
Cant help myself from falling in love  
  
Kiss me again  
Ooh there I go  
You got my heart racing  
Out of control  
Got butterflies  
And I cant disguise  
That Im feeling so much  
  
You intoxicate  
You fascinate  
You know you make me crazy  
What can I say oh yeah  
  
I come undone alright  
I come undone  
Every time Im close to you ooh  
I come undone  
I come undone  
Cant help myself from falling in love oh  
  
I come undone  
I come undone  
Anytime you walk in the room ohh  
I come undone  
I come undone  
I cant help I cant stop  
I cant shake this crazy love  
  
Do ya do ya do ya know  
What you to do me  
Do ya do ya  
What you do to me  
  
Something behind your smile  
Something inside your eyes  
Makes me feel makes me feel  
Love Ohh  
  
I come undone  
I come undone  
Ooh every time Im close to you oh  
I come undone oh no ohh  
I come undone  
Cant help myself from falling in love oh oh  
  
I come undone when you walk in the room  
I come undone I come undone  
Any time you walk in the room oh baby baby now
