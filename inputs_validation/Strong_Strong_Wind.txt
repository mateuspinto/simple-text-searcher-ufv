We walked away before there were too many storms  
We could not get through but I still kept loving you  
Now fate brought you back to me this time I wont let you leave  
Im holding on to you forever Im never letting go  
The time I spent away from you was time that made me see  
I need to live my life with you I need you here with me  
And it would take a strong strong wind to take me from your arms again  
To take me from your side  
It would take a strong strong wind to pull away this heart of mine  
To make us break apart this time it would take a strong strong wind  
Hearts sometimes lose their way but they find their way back someday  
To the arms they need and I need you like the air I breathe  
The time I spent away from you was time lost in the rain  
Im meant to live my life with you thats something nothing can change  
It would take a strong strong wind to take me from your arms again  
To take me from your side  
It would take a strong strong wind to tear away this heart of mine  
Make us break apart this time yeah it would take a strong strong wind  
This time Im holding on with everything  
This time I wont let go for anything  
And it would take a strong strong wind to take me from your arms again  
To take me from your side  
It would take a strong strong wind to pull away this heart of mine  
To make us break apart this time it would take a strong strong wind  
Yeah baby it would take a strong strong wind
