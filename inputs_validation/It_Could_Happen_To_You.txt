Hide your heart from sight  
Lock your dreams at night  
It could happen to you  
Dont count stars or you might stumble  
Someone drops a sigh and down you tumble  
  
Keep an eye on spring  
Run when church bells ring  
It could happen to you  
All I did was wonder how your arms would be  
And it happened to me  
  
It could happen to you  
All I did was wonder how your arms would be  
And it happened to me
