I get so tired of missing you  
I get so tired of wanting to  
Compare the things that are easy to do  
Like the reasons you lie to me  
The reasons I lie to you  
  
And I wish it was some kinda explosive device  
That only you could diffuse  
Reasons you lie to me  
Reasons I lie to you  
  
Wanna live in a beautiful house  
Somewhere up in the hills  
With some people making fun of us  
You refer to us as your two kids  
Then it wouldnt be somebody else  
That youd grow accustomed to  
Reasons to lie to me  
Is a reason to lie to you  
  
I get so tired of missing you  
I get so tired of wanting to  
Compare the things that are easy to do  
Like the reasons you lie to me  
Reasons I lie to you
