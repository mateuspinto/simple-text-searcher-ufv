Two people living on the edge of life  
Are people running out of dreams and time  
I can hear it when you tell me so  
I can feel it but I cant let go  
  
Two people gotta stick together  
And love one another save it for a rainy day  
Some people gotta stay whatever  
And give one another shelter on a rainy day  
  
Two people living in the way we do  
Are people trying to keep a love anew  
What to say to make some sense of it  
What to do to make the feeling fit  
  
Two people gotta stick together  
And love one another save it for a rainy day  
Some people gotta stay whatever  
And give one another shelter on a rainy day  
  
Ill come running to your rescue  
You gotta stand by me  
Theres a lot of love between us  
We should never let go
