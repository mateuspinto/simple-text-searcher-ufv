I hired a coach to take me from confusion to the plane  
And though we shared a common space I know Ill never meet again  
The driver with his eyebrows furrowed in the rearview mirror  
I read his name and it was plainly written Nathan La Franeer  
I asked him would he hurry  
But we crawled the canyons slowly  
Through the buyers and the sellers  
Through the burglar bells and the wishing wells  
With gangs and girly shows  
The ghostly garden grows  
  
The cars and buses bustled through the bedlam of the day  
I looked through windowglass at streets and Nathan grumbled at the grey  
I saw an aging cripple selling Superman balloons  
The city grated through chromeplate  
The clock struck slowly halfpastnoon  
Through the tunnel tiled and turning  
Into daylight once again I am escaping  
Once again goodbye  
To symphonies and dirty trees  
With parks and plastic clothes  
The ghostly garden grows  
  
He asked me for a dollar more  
He cursed me to my face  
He hated everyone who paid to ride  
And share his common space  
I picked my bags up from the curb  
And stumbled to the door  
Another man reached out his hand  
Another hand reached out for more  
And I filled it full of silver  
And I left the fingers counting  
And the sky goes on forever  
Without meter maids and peace parades  
  
You feed it all your woes  
The ghostly garden grows
