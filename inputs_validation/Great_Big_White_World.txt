In space the stars are no nearer  
They just glitter like a morgue  
And I dreamed I was a spaceman  
Burned like a moth in a flame  
And our world was so fucking gone  
  
But Im not attached to your world  
Nothing heals and nothing grows  
  
Because its a great big white world  
And we are drained of our colors  
We used to love ourselves  
We used to love one another  
All my stitches itch  
My prescriptions low I wish you  
Were queen  
Just for today  
In a world so white what else could I say  
  
And hell was so cold  
All the vases are so broken  
And the roses tear our hands all open  
Mother Mary miscarry  
But we pray just like insects  
The world is so ugly now  
  
Because its a great big white world  
And we are drained of our colors  
We used to love ourselves  
We used to love one another  
All my stitches itch  
My prescriptions low I wish you  
Were queen  
Just for today  
In a world so white what else could I say
