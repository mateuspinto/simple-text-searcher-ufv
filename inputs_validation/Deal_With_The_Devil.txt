Forged in the Black Country  
Under blood red skies  
We all had our dream to realize  
Driving in that transit  
Down to Holy Joes  
Used to lose our head while metal flowed  
Nothing held us back or dared to try  
Something in our blood wont let us die  
We built our world of metal watched it grow  
Fueled the fury solid to the bone  
  
Gotta deal with the devil  
Cause you know thats its real  
Done a deal with the devil  
From a heart made of steel  
  
Rollin down the MWay  
Took it to the smoke  
Banging heads there til we all went broke  
When we don the leather  
And the whips and chains  
Nothing matters more we cant be tamed  
Fighting through the din and accolades  
Turn the phase around with razor blades  
Watched the movement grow into one voice  
Took on the whole world it had no choice  
  
Late at night  
Youre in our sight  
Where we can feel what weve been waiting for  
Let me hear you roar  
On this stage let it rage  
For a time we leave the world behind  
To be with our own kind
