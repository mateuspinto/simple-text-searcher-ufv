Well I pledge my head to heaven for the gospel  
And I ask no man on earth to fill my needs  
Like the sparrow up above I am enveloped in his love  
And I trust him like those little ones he feeds  
  
Well I pledge my wife to heaven for the gospel  
Though our love each passing day just seems to grow  
As I told her when we wed Id surely rather be found dead  
Than to love her more than the one who saved my soul  
Im your child and I want to be in your family forever  
Im your child and Im going to follow you  
No matter whatever the cost Im gonna count all things lost  
  
Well I pledge my son to heaven for the gospel  
Though hes kicked and beaten ridiculed and scorn  
I will teach him to rejoice and life a thankful praising voice  
And to be like him who bore the nails and crown of thorns  
Im your child and I want to be in your family forever  
Im your child and Im going to follow you  
No matter whatever the cost Im gonna count all things lost  
Oh no matter whatever the cost Im gonna count all things lost  
  
Well Ive had the chance to gain the world and to live just like a king  
But without your love it doesnt mean a thing  
Oh no matter whatever the cost Im gonna count all things lost  
Oh no matter whatever the cost Im gonna count all things lost  
  
Well I pledge my son I pledge my wife I pledge my head to heaven  
I pledge my son I pledge my wife I pledge my head to heaven for the gospel
