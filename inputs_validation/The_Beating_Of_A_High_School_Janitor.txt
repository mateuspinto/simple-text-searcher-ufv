And now the sever beating of a high school janitor  
  
Mopping sounds  
Mop mop mop  
All day long  
Mop mop mop  
While I sing this song  
  
Sound of someone walking towards him  
Gonna wax the floor  
Gonna make it shine  
Gonna take of the spray paint  
With turpentine  
  
Hey Dont walk there I just mopped  
Person walking quickly towards him  
Beating sounds  
Hey  
Beating sounds  
Get offa me  
Beating sounds  
Thats my bucket  
Beating sounds  
Let go of my side burns  
Beating sounds  
Sound of falling down into glass
