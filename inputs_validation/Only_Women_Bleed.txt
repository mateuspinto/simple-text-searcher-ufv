Mans got his woman  
To take his seed  
Hes got the power mmmhmm  
She got the need  
Spends her life through  
Pleasing up her man  
She feeds him dinner  
Yeah anything she can  
she cries alone at night too often  
He smokes and drinks and dont come home at all  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
Only women  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
man make your hair gray  
He your lifes mistake  
All youre really lookin for  
Is an even break cause  
he lies right at you  
You know you hate his game  
Slaps you once in a while  
And you live and love in pain  
she cries alone at night too often  
He smokes and drinks and dont come home at all  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
Only women mmmm  
Only women bleed you know  
Eehh sweetsweet mmmmmm  
he lies right at you  
You know you hate this game  
Slaps you once in a while  
And you live and love in pain  
she cries alone at night too often  
She smokes and drinks and dont come home at all  
Only women bleed  
Only women bleed  
Only womennmmmmm  
Only women bleed  
Only womennmmmmmmmmm
