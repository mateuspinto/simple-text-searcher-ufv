I bare my windowed self untamed and untrained  
Dreams that hardly touch our complexions truest faults  
If room enough for both my drowsy spirit shall fall  
Bold waves tumble to the season of my heart  
Where you have offered my faith and my trust  
Until all is lost into the beauty of the day  
  
But there is something in the way you laugh  
That makes me feel like a child  
Aspects of life they confuse me  
You and your thesis amuse me  
  
After an afternoon with you  
And your rich brown eyes  
Your lips and your dark hair  
Elbows and exposed knees tossing toward the ceiling  
After an afternoon  
  
Face to palm  
Tear to tear  
Mouth to tongue  
Heart to ground  
I am in love
