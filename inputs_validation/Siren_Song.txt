Ever faithful I endure  
To listen for the sound of the siren song  
Ragged whispers of imprisoned sisters  
Cutting through real life drawing me nearer  
  
The colour of the pure in soul  
Like water shall fill the cloudless sky  
  
Try to feel the splendor of it all  
Embrace the honesty of nightfall  
Try to feel the anguish of it all  
Wrap yourself up  
In every facet of emotion  
  
Hearts that cry diamond tears  
Spirits that walk for a thousand years  
Hear them calling on that darkest morning  
Pulling me under my thoughts disappear  
  
Can you feel love  
Can you feel joy  
Can you feel pain
