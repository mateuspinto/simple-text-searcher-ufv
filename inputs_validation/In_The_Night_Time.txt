hampstead incident  
Standing by the everyman digging the rigging on my sail  
Rain to the sound of harpsichords to the spell of fairy tale  
The heath was hung in magic mist enchanted dripping glades  
Ill taste a taste until my mind drifts from this scene and fades  
In the night time  
Crystals sparkles in the grass I polish them with thought  
On my lash there in my eye a star of light is caught  
Fortunes told in grains of sand here I am is all I know  
Candy stuck in childrens hair everywhere I go  
In the night time  
Crystals sparkles in the grass I polish them with thought  
On my lash there in my eye a star of light is caught  
Fortunes told in grains of sand here I am is all I know  
Candy stuck in childrens hair everywhere I go  
In the night time  
In the night time  
In the night time  
In the night time
