Varnished weeds in window jars  
Tarnished beads on tapestries  
Kept in satin boxes are  
Reflections of loves memories  
  
Letters from across the seas  
Roses dipped in sealing wax  
Valentines and maple leaves  
Tucked into a paperback  
  
Guess Ill throw them all away  
I found someone to love today  
  
Dark with darker moods is he  
Not a golden Prince whos come  
Through columbines and wizardry  
To talk of castles in the sun  
  
Still Ill take a chance and see  
I found someone to love today  
  
Theres a sorrow in his eyes  
Like the angel made of tin  
What will happen if I try  
To place another heart in him  
  
In a Bleeker Street cafe  
I found someone to love today  
I found someone to love today
