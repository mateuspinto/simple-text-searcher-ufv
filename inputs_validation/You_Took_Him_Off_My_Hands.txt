1  
You took him off my hands  
When you stepped in  
You changed everything  
Were not even friends  
  
2  
Dont leave the job half done  
Leave nothing behind  
You took him off my hands  
Now please take him off my mind  
  
3  
Please take his photograph  
Engraved on my heart so blue  
And take all his memories  
He now belongs to you  
  
Repeat 2 3 2  
  
You took him off my hands  
Now please take him off my mind
