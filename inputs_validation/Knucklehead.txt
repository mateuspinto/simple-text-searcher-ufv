Fancy Apple lap top cost 5 grand  
Fresh girl in a Tshirt silll looks best  
Travel to a sunny quiet land  
Layin on the beach I miss my pests  
Lifes turning up the pressure  
  
Its makin me aggressive  
The music sounds like dead ham  
The dj is a con man  
Hes sayin  
  
I I I want something from you  
I I I want something from you  
I I I want something from you  
Knucklehead what can you do  
What can you do  
  
One day I went out to buy a truck  
I found one that looked so huge and big  
Once I got that sucker on the road  
I was looking down at everything  
And I really liked that  
Everyone obeyed me  
I thought this is power  
Like that religious hour  
When the preacher says  
  
I I I want something from you  
I I I want something from you  
I I I want something from you  
Knucklehead what can you do  
  
Something from you Something from you  
Something from you Something from you  
  
Once the telephone starts ringing I stop thinking  
Sittin at the TV Im just blinking  
Go to the compuler and Im punching  
Whats this information that Im munching  
The leader and the followers  
The rock star and the model  
The general and the perverts  
Theyre poking me where it hurts ouch  
  
I I I want something from you  
I I I want something from you  
I I I want something from you  
Knucklehead what can you do
