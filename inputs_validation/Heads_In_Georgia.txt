feat J J Cale  
  
Well my heads in Georgia but my feet are California bound  
Well my heads in Georgia but my feet is California bound  
Cause that good looking woman I got wants to leave these Georgia towns  
  
Well we ride them old freight trains rent them automobiles  
For we ride them old freight trains and rent them automobiles  
Cause that good looking woman is tired of these old Georgia hills  
  
And that lonesome old highway seems to be our way no doubt  
And that lonesome old highway seems to be the way no doubt  
Cause that good looking woman and me we just hanging out  
  
Trains and airplanes is all we do Im running half the time just like she
wants me to  
Makes me no difference to me when all is said and done headed west toward the
setting sun  
  
Well my heads in Georgia but my feet is California bound  
Cause that good looking woman I got wants to leave these Georgia towns  
  
Well my heads in Georgia but my feet is California bound  
Well my heads in Georgia but my feet is California bound  
Cause that good looking I got wants to leave these Georgia towns  
  
Cause that good looking woman I got wants to leave these Georgia towns  
Good looking woman I got wants to leave these Georgia towns
