Storms from the gods  
Make us perish with hungry  
Starvation and drought  
Are unleashed on this earth  
Reap what you sow from our bleed and our treasures  
Far more than we need now  
Far more than were worth  
  
Chorus   
La tentazione The Temptation  
Cercando la Gloria To search the Glory  
Il prezzo da pagare The thing to pay  
E la caduta delluomo Is the fall of man  
  
How can we live in despair and in sorrow  
Our children are lost with all that we love  
Winds spreading for to lay waste to our culture  
Civilizations ignite from above  
  
Chorus   
  
This world revolves  
And I fore tell  
The end of men  
Resides in hell  
For you can see  
That in my heart  
We will be  
  
Chorus
