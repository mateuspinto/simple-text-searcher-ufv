Looking like a born again  
Living like a heretic  
Listening to arthur lee records  
Making all your friends feel so guilty  
About their cynicism  
And the rest of their generation  
Not even the government are gonna stop you now  
But are you ready to be heartbroken  
Are you ready to be heartbroken  
  
Pumped up full of vitamins  
On account of all the seriousness  
You say youre so happy now  
You can hardly stand  
Lean over on the bookcase  
If you really want to get straight  
Read norman mailer  
Or get a new tailor  
Are you ready to be heartbroken  
Are you ready to be heartbroken  
Are you ready to bleed  
  
What would it take  
What would it take to wipe that smile off of your face  
Are you ready to be are you ready to bleed  
  
Are you ready to be heartbroken  
Are you ready to bleed heartbroken  
Well you better get ready now baby  
Are you ready to bleed  ready to bleed
