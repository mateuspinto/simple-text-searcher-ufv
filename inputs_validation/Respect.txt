For reasons I dont know I treated you so cold  
I wish I had those times again  
Cause something that you said keeps ringing in my head  
Someday youre gonna wanna come back and youre gonna wanna treat me fine  
  
Everybody needs a little respect  
Everybody needs a little time  
Everybody needs a little respect  
Everybody needs a little  
  
I watched me push you down in dreams I had of you  
And all I remember about those days is I would run around thinking that youd  
Be alright  
But you lost your light along the way  
And oh you were right about the things Id say  
Cause if I had it back again I know Id treat you kind  
  
Everybody needs a little respect  
Everybody needs a little time  
Everybody needs a little respect  
Everybody needs a little time  
Everybody got to have somebody  
Everybody got to have someone  
  
And all I ever wanted from this play  
Was someone to talk to when I get down  
It seems you get the things you give along the way  
Now all I need is one more chance to make you feel like hanging round  
  
Everybody needs a little  
Everybody needs a little  
Everybody needs a little respect  
Everybody needs a little time  
Everybody needs a little respect  
Everybody needs a little time  
Everybody  
Everybody got to have someone
