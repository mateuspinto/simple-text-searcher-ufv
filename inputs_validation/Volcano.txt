I like it here in this quiet room  
We can turn off all the trouble when we do what we do  
I like it here in the middle of the day  
We can hide inside each other when we need to get away  
From rest of world  
We need to get away from the world outside  
Way from the world  
Need to find the place where we can hide  
Somewhere they cant find us  
Yeah somewhere under a volcano  
We can hide inside a volcano  
We can find the good life on the inside  
  
I like the crazy way you look at me  
Without the drugs we can be what were afraid to be  
I remember what its like to be clean and insane  
I remember what is that makes me need to get away  
Away from of world  
We need to get away from the world outside  
Away from the world  
We need to find a place where we can hide yeah  
Somewhere they cant find us  
Where my chain can pass from black to white  
They may let us out this time oh  
I made some mistakes I paid the price  
I walked away clean you know I did my time  
Youve been waiting for years waiting for me  
Waiting to leave so we can find a dream  
We can live under volcano with the fire all around  
We can lose yourself inside a dream  
In the middle of the northern sound  
Get away from the world  
We need to get away from the world  
Gotta get away from the world  
We got to get away oh oh  
Get away from the world  
We got to get away oh oh  
Away from the world  
You know we gotta find the place where we can hide  
Oh somewhere we can hide  
We can find the good life on the inside
