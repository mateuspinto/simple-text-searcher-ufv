Im so glad you made time to see me  
Hows life tell me hows your family  
I havent seen them in a while  
Youve been good busier then ever  
We small talk work and the weather  
Your guard is up and I know why  
  
Because the last time you saw me  
Is still burned in the back of your mind  
You gave me roses and I left them there to die  
  
So this is me swallowing my pride  
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night  
And I go back to December all the time  
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you  
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine  
Id go back to December turn around and make it all right  
I go back to December all the time  
  
These days I havent been sleeping  
Staying up playing back myself leaving  
When your birthday passed and I didnt call  
And I think about summer all the beautiful times  
I watched you laughing from the passenger side  
And realized Id loved you in the fall  
And then the cold came the dark days when fear crept into my mind  
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye  
  
So this is me swallowing my pride  
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night  
And I go back to December all the time  
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you  
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine  
Id go back to December turn around and change my own mind  
I go back to December all the time  
  
I miss your tan skin your sweet smile so good to me so right  
And how you held me in your arms that September night  
The first time you ever saw me cry  
Maybe this is wishful thinking  
Probably mindless dreaming  
But if we loved again I swear Id love you right  
  
Id go back in time and change it but I cant  
So if the chain is on your door I understand  
  
But this is me swallowing my pride  
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night  
And I go back to December  
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you  
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine  
Id go back to December turn around and make it all right  
Id go back to December turn around and change my own mind  
I go back to December all the time all the time
