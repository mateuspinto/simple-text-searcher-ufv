Born in a stable He came here for me  
Born of a virgin He came here for me  
Gods only son come to set the world free  
Born of Gods love and He came here for me  
Savior of the world I praise thee  
Jesus Lamb of God I pray to thee hear me  
As I praise thy birth bend down thy ear and hear my prayer  
Over a stable a star shone so bright  
Guiding 3 wise men who rode through the night  
He was called baby Jesus He came here for me  
Born to this world then He died here for me
