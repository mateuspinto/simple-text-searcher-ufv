Too much in the truth they say  
Keep it till another day  
Let them have their little game  
Illusion helps to keep them sane  
  
Let them have their little toys  
Fast sports cars and motor noise  
Exciting in their plastic place  
Frozen food in a concrete maze  
  
Youre gonna go insane  
Im trying to save your brain  
  
I dont know whats happening  
My heads all torn inside  
People say Im heavy  
They dont know what I hide  
  
Take a life its going cheap  
Kill someone no one will weep  
Freedoms yours just pay your dues  
We just want your soul to use  
  
Youre gonna go insane  
Im trying to save your brain
