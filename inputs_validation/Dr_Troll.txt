La La holds inside of her  
The horrible dream of being somebody  
Thinking about her dream makes her feel  
Like its stupid  
A dream whose coming true  
Is a must a must  
It would be so much easier  
If she was a real girl  
The preschool students ask her  
What she is  
She thinks I dont know  
She say What do you think  
Listen to On Fire and pretend someone could love you  
Listen to Lady Day and pretend they knew the half of it  
Listen to Birthday and pretend someone could love you  
Listen to Nick Drake and pretend they knew the half of it
