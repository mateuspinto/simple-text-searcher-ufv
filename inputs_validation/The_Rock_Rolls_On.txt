Theres never a day thats passing my way  
That I never need it  
My hands on the wheel my foots on the steel  
Cause I gotta feel it  
  
REFRAIN  
The rock rolls forever on  ooh forever on  
Like thunder  coming down ooh yeah  
The rock rolls forever on  ooh forever on  
Like thunder  coming down ooh yeah  
  
It blows through my veins like thunder and rain  
And I cant live without it  
I scream for the crowds and turn it up loud  
Cause I gotta feel it  
  
REFRAIN  
  
Six string and lightning strikes  
Come make me blind  
Ooh burn it up  
Bring down the pedal to the metal  
  
REFRAIN  
  
Forever never stop
