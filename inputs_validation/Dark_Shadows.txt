It seems like only yesterday  
I embraced the eternal flame  
I wanna know if I am I am only ashes  
If the sun should shine on me  
  
I wanna taste  
What your life has to offer  
The longing the lonely  
At Collinwood at Collinwood  
  
Feel the wind grow stronger  
See the full moon rise  
Casting its dark shadows  
The beast will feed tonight  
  
Feel the wind grow stronger  
As the pale moon rose  
Casting its dark shadows  
For whom the bell will toll
