Coffin car shes riding a coffin car  
People watching her with tender eyes  
Friends whispering in kindly words  
Children running waving hands  
Telling each other how pretty she is  
  
Coffin car she likes to ride a coffin car  
Friends making ways for the first time  
People throwing kisses for the first time  
Showering flowers ringing bells  
Telling each other how nice she is  
  
Coffin car shes riding a coffin car  
Wives showing tears for the first time  
Husband taking their hats off for the first time  
Crushing their handkerchiefs rubbing their nose  
Telling each other how good she is  
  
Half the world is dead anyway  
The other half is asleep and life is killing her  
Telling her to join the dead  
  
So evry day she likes to ride a coffin car  
A flower covered coffin car  
Pretending she was dead
