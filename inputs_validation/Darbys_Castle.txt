See the ruin on the hill where the smoke is hanging still  
Like an echo of an age long forgotten  
Theres a story of a home crushed beneath those blackened stones  
And the roof that fell before the beams were rotten  
  
Cecil Darby loved his wife and he laboured all his life  
To provide her with material possessions  
And he built for her a home of the finest wood and stone  
And the building soon became his sole obsession  
  
Oh it took threehundred days for the timbers to be raised  
And the silhouette was seen for miles around  
And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky  
But it only took one night to bring it down  
When Darbys castle tumbled to the ground  
  
Though they shared a common bed there was precious little said  
In the moments that were set aside for sleepin  
For his busy dreams were filled with the rooms hed yet to build  
And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping  
  
Then one night he heard a sound as he laid his pencil down  
And he traced it to her door and turned the handle  
And the pale light of the moon through the window of the room  
Split the shadows where two bodies lay entangled  
  
Oh it took threehundred days for the timbers to be raised  
And the silhouette was seen for miles around  
And the gables reached as high as the eagles in the sky  
But it only took one night to bring it down  
When Darbys castle tumbled to the ground
