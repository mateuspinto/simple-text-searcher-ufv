Go aheah and build a better messiah we can dig another grave  
This is your calling  
If you are hearing this there is nothing I can do  
Something has grown in my chest  
And I have seen it  
It is hard and cold  
Its been dormant for many years  
I have tried to save you but I cannot come to save you  
But this is what you deserve  
This is whta we deserve  
This is something that we have brought upon ourselves  
We are not a victim you are not a victim  
We are not a victim you are not a victim  
God will grovel before me  
God will crawl at my feet  
These are the dying years  
These are the dying years  
When you are suffering know that I have betrayed you
