These are the days we throw away  
The words we never say  
That Im so fragile and so wrong  
And were still knockin on the door  
Of a world thats gone before  
Until the real thing comes along  
Kiss the day on its way  
And the sun will never shine  
In your eyes like the skies  
And the darkness will arise  
Kiss the day and await  
It holds you in its arms  
And the light will never fade  
Kiss the day  
And now Ive seen enough to know  
Though the truth can leave you cold  
It can always lead you home  
Back to the place where we belong  
To the time when we were strong  
When we could blow away the storm  
Kiss the day on its way  
And the sun will never shine  
In your eyes like the skies  
And the darkness will arise  
Kiss the day and await  
It holds you in its arms  
And the light will never fade  
Kiss the day kiss the day  
These are the days we throw away  
The words we never say  
Till the real thing comes along  
Kiss the day on its way  
And the sun will never shine  
In your eyes like the skies  
And the darkness will arise  
Kiss the day and await  
It holds you in its arms  
And the light will never fade  
Kiss the day
