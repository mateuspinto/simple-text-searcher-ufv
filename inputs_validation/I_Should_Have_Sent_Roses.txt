Are you standing outside  
Looking up at the sky  
Cursing a wandering star  
Well if I were you  
Id throw rocks at the moon  
And Id say Damn you wherever you are  
  
I dont know where to start  
This cage round my heart  
Locked up what I meant to say  
What I felt all along the way  
Just wondering how come  
I couldnt take your breath away  
  
Chorus  
Cause I never sent roses  
I never did enough  
I didnt know how to love you  
Though I loved you so much  
And I should have sent roses  
When you crossed my mind  
For no other reason  
Than the fact you were mine  
I should have sent roses  
  
Looking back on my life  
If fate should decide  
I could do it all over again  
Id build no more walls  
Id stay true and recall  
The fragrance of you on the wind  
  
Youll get better than me  
Someone who can see  
Right from the start give it all that you need  
And Ill slip away  
Knowing Im half the man I should be  
  
Chorus  
  
Should have sent roses
