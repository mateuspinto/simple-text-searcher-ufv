Glac is luaimneach luath I ngleo  
Ag teascadh an tslua s ag tuairgan tria  
Seinntear stair are chlairsigh cheoil  
Is liontair tainte cart are bord  
Le hinntinn ard gan chaim gan cheo  
Chun saol is slainte dfhail don leon  
Ghile mear sa seal faoi chumha

Suan na sian nm bhfuaireas fiin  
O luaidh I gciin mo ghile mear  
Seal da rabhas Immhaighdean shiimh

Mo chiile ag treabhadh ne dtonn go trian  
De bharr na gcnoc is in imigiin

Chorus  
He is my hero my dashing darling  
He is my caesar dashing darling  
Ive had no rest from forebodings  
Since he went far away my darling  
Every day I am constantly sad  
Weeping bitterly and shedding tears  
Because our lively lad has left us  
And no news from him is heard alas  
The cuckoo sings not pleasantly at noon  
And the sound of hounds is not heard in nutfilled woods  
Nor summer morning in misty glen  
Since he went away from me my lively boy  
Noble proud young horseman  
Warrior unsaddened of most pleasant countenace  
A swiftmoving hand quick in a fight  
Slaying the enemy and smiting the strong  
Let a strain be played on musical harps  
And let many quarts be filled  
With high spirit without fault or mist  
For life and health to toast my lion  
Dashing darling for a while under sorrow  
And all ireland under black cloaks  
Rest or pleasure I did not get  
Since he went far away my dashing darling  
For a while I was a gentle maiden  
And now a spent wornout widow  
My spouse ploughing the waves strongly  
Over the hills and far away
