I see them dancing somewhere in the moonlight  
Somewhere in Alaska somewhere in the sun  
I hear them singing a song for all lovers  
A song for the two hearts beating only as one  
  
Imagine the morning no longer alone  
The arms of another a place to belong  
No longer the struggle no longer the night  
And ever becoming in the quickening light  
  
To see the darkness to listen within  
To answer in kindness to ever begin  
To ever be gentle to always be strong  
To walk in the wonder to live in the song  
  
In a place of enchantment where the wild things are known  
Will the future remember when the lovers are gone  
  
And I see them dancing somewhere in the moonlight  
Somewhere in Alaska somewhere in the sun  
I hear them singing a song for all lovers  
A song for the two hearts beating only as one  
A song for the two hearts beating only as one
