Timothy tries but he cant explain  
All of the things that shatter his brain  
Comes from the garden shouting and grinning  
Hey Timothy where do you come from  
Only befriended with Jerry the mouse  
Seems to know what Timmys talking about  
Comes from the garden shouting and grinning  
Hey Timothy where do you come from  
  
Does he come from the sky Does he come from the land  
Does he come from the earth Does he come from the sea Timothy  
Hey Timothy where do you come from where do you come from Timothy
