4 Fizzle  
Be clear you already know what it is  
Meanin the booth is alive and well  
4 Fizzle my man Fabolous right now  
Paul Cain hes in the building  
Street Fam  
Its about to go down  
Fab please please bless it  
  
Fabolous  
Yes sir  
Got my homie Paul Cain in the house  
You know what I mean  
Reppin that Street Fam  
You know how we do  
Check it out Yo  
  
Verse 1 Fabolous  
Straight out of Brooklyn a baby mama snatcher named Ghetto  
Invisible set glow  
Full clip to let go  
Back in the metro  
Fresh off the jet though  
Fifty grand richer from a thirty minute set show  
Gangsta but im the flyest you ever met ho  
Button up etro  
The Air Jordan Retro  
Million dollar neck row  
Got homie upset so  
Now I get the bank and make them petty dudes bet mo  
Told you from the get go  
Yall cant deny it  
I just supply it  
For those who buy it  
Now I ride by it  
It might start a riot  
Chicks wont quiet  
Long enough to try it  
Dirt they throwin mud slides on my name  
They never seen this kind of stud size in a chain  
I analyze that like im Billy Crystal  
Im forced to move around with this nine milly pistol  
  
4 Fizzle  
What more do we need to say man
