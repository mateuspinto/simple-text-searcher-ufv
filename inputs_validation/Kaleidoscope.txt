Give me highs give me lows  
Give me thorns with my rose  
I want everything  
When you laugh when you cry  
If youre sober or high  
I want everything  
  
Give me love or hate  
You can bend me til I break  
Give me fire give me rain  
I want joy with my pain  
I want your fears your hopes  
The whole kaleidoscope  
  
With you with you  
Our colors come alive when I collide  
With you with you  
Our colors come alive when I collide  
With you oh oh ooh yeah  
  
Give me nothing give me faith  
I want give with my take  
I want everything  
Give me life give me death  
Or your biggest regrets  
I want everything  
  
Show me your fears show me your scars  
Ill take whatevers left of your heart  
Give me heaven give me hell  
All the dreams you try to sell  
I want your fears your hopes  
The while kaleidoscope  
  
With you with you  
Our colors come alive when I collide  
With you with you  
Our colors come alive when I collide  
With you oh oh ooh yeah  
  
Without you its shadows the nights black pitch  
When theres a hundred thousand light bulbs but there aint no switch  
Living in darkness fearin the night  
Oh what a feeling when I see that light  
  
With you with you  
Our colors come alive when I collide  
With you with you  
Our colors come alive when I collide  
With you oh oh ooh yeah
