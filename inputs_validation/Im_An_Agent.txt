Send in eyes  
Thoughts of crashing all those pictures  
Send in thoughts of john the god  
  
Send in dreams  
Lovers on corners clean my sheets  
Your only chance is break the state  
  
We are clean  
Dont ask Im an agent  
  
Send in change  
Secretaries nothing more  
You can be replaced you know  
  
Send in chance  
Bad conditions talk of leaving  
Talk of walking out on me  
  
Send in you  
Send in pain send in lies  
Send in words that I believe  
  
Send in you  
Just watch the face your sure to see  
Something give this game away  
  
Send in you  
Get her out get her out  
Call me just dont say the name
