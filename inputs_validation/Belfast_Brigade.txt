The black and tans from London  
Came to shoot the people down  
They thought the ira was dead  
In dear old Belfast town  
Those cruel English soldiers  
They were seriously dismayed  
no Surrender was the war cry of the Belfast brigade  
  
Glory glory to old Ireland  
Glory glory to this island  
Glory to the memory of the men  
Who found their grave  
no Surrender is the war cry of  
The Belfast Brigade  
  
The soldiers came from Holywood  
Equipped with English guns  
There were men by the thousand  
Ammunition by the ton  
But when they got to Belfast  
They were seriously delayed  
  
By the fighting First Battalion  
Of the Belfast Brigade  
  
We have no ammunition  
Or no armoured tanks to show  
But were ready to defend ourselves  
No matter where we go  
Were out for our Republic  
And to hell with your Free State  
no Surrender is the war cry  
Of the Belfast Brigade  
  
Come all you gallant Irishmen  
And join the ira  
Well strike a blow for freedom  
When it comes a certain day  
You know your countrys history  
And the sacrifice it made  
Come join the First Battalion  
Of the Belfast Brigade
