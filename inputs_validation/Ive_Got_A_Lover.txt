Ive got a lover back in japan  
Hes got tatooes  
Hes my superman  
I try to call him up from time to time  
We can talk about the weather  
Is the weather fine  
  
And I say break break  
Break away those ties  
Break break  
  
Ive got a lover  
Up in outer space  
Hes been tumbling around  
All over the place  
I like to call him from time to time  
We can talk about heaven  
  
Break break  
Break away those ties  
Break break  
  
When the whole world descends on me  
Ill be waiting for you  
  
Got another lover in timbuktu  
Got a name for him  
Hes my little guru  
When I dont call him he starts to cry  
I have to tell him stories just to pacify  
  
Break break  
  
When the whole world descends on me  
Ill be waiting for you  
  
I was bitter when I met you  
I was eloquent with rage  
Like honey from a poisoned cup  
I flowed from stage to stage  
ooh Sugar baby Sing me a lullaby  
Japanese baby
