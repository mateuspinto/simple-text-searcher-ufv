All the love that we share could never just disappear  
And all that weve been through I believe in you  
  
I will never deny you  
  
Friends said to me one day I should forget you  
But my experience say what we have is true  
  
I will never deny you  
  
Hey Judas they will betray you  
Thomass they will doubt you  
Peters they will deny you  
But I will never deny you  
  
I  
  
All the love that we share could never just disappear  
And all that weve been through I believe in you  
  
I will never deny you  
Will never deny you will never deny you oh I
