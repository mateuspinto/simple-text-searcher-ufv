Standing up on the outside  
Falling down within  
Looking righteous as a pharisee  
Filled with guilt and sin  
Trying to walk with Jesus  
The strait and narrow road  
Holding on to this world  
I just could not let go  
Thats such a heavy road  
Chorus  
Come and break the yoke Lord  
Come and set this child free  
Come tear down the walls of pride  
And all I hide beneath  
Freedom always came to those  
Who receive the words you spoke  
I receive your word break the yoke  
I receive your word break the yoke  
Praying with my brother  
Is such a precious time  
When I confessed my weaknesses  
He joined his hands with mine  
I know something happened  
When he prayed with me  
The weight of sin fell off  
Jesus set me free  
Come and break the yoke Lord  
Come and set your children free  
Come tear down the walls of pride  
And false humility  
The nail scars in your hands and feet  
Prove your love for us is not a joke  
Do what you must break the yoke  
Do what you must break the yoke  
Now Im back on my feet again  
A new lifes begun  
Every day Im walking with Jesus  
But you know there are days we even run  
Set free to serve and worship Him  
All the chains He broke  
Ill praise His name forever  
He broke the yoke  
Ill praise your name Lord  
You broke the yoke you broke the yoke  
  
Behold  
Behold the cross that Jesus bore  
Behold the crown of thorns that he wore  
Behold the price that Jesus paid  
The glorious sacrifice that he made  
Chorus  
Behold oh behold Jesus Christ the Lord  
Behold He is the one that we adore  
Behold the tomb where Jesus lay  
Behold the stone its been rolled away  
Behold His resurrection power  
He lives again He lives this hour  
Chorus  
Behold the world in slumber lies  
And then thunder fills the skies  
An angel shouts a trumpet sounds  
The saints of God are glory bound  
Chorus  
And we adore you Lord  
And we adore your name  
And we lift up our hearts in praise
