Out in the city strees  
Alone and weak from the cold and hunger  
Trembling hands unfold a photograph  
Mom and Dan and Ann Marie  
Smiles from a distant sunrise  
The only smile youve seen in days  
  
Chorus  
Come back to me  
Come back my darlin  
Come back to me  
Or I will fade away  
Come back to me  
Come back my darlin  
I still believe in you  
My runaway  
  
Jesse and Willy Lee  
Play in the street while their mother wonders  
Why wont they listen to a word I say  
I sing a lullaby  
To the baby in my arms  
And the laughter fades away  
  
Chorus  
  
Come back to me  
Come back my darlin  
Im sending hope  
For the runaway  
Somewhere a flash of light  
Cuts through the night  
Like a lighthouse callin  
All of the lost and forgotten  
I made a vow I will continue  
Til I find you  
  
Ill never stop Ill never stop believin  
I will wait for you forever  
Sending you hope for the runaway
