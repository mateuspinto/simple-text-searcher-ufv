I have been to Hell and back  kissed satanic Queen  
Traveling at the speed of light  saw thing never seen  
Arm in arm with Lucifer  Belial on my back  
I have swam the lake of flames  walked forbidden tracks  
To Hell  and back  
To Hell  and back  
Ive made love to Lilleth fair  danced the zombies dance  
I have shook the reapers hand  broke his deathly trance  
Present at ungodly births  mutants writhe in pain  
Im possessed by Hell itself  Im the man insane  
To Hell  and back  
To Hell  and back  
Ride with me  
To Hell  and back  
You can take a trip with me  Hells my final home  
If you wish to live at night  watch the demons room  
Holding high the Southern Cross  watch the mortals bleed  
Drink the blood and feel my wrath  watch the mutants breed  
To Hell  and back  
To Hell  and back
