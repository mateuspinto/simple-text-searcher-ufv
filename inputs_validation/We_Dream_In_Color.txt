Wake up wake up wake up time to dream  
We dream we dream we dream in color  
Wake me up in the middle of the night tell me what youve seen  
Ivory clouds in a sea of blue fields of endless green  
But we lie here and we search for stars  
Or big letters all the way from Mars  
The sky is black and the moon is pale and we cry for this world of ours  
In the dark we still believe oh you know that we still believe  
In the dark we see  
Chorus  
We dream in color but we live in black and white  
We dream in color like a rainbow in the night  
We dream of peace we dream of love but still the dream is not enough  
We dream in color  
Oh yes we dream  
I wake up in the middle of the day locked within this cell  
The sun is weak on the gun gray street a cold and concrete hell  
So I close my eyes and remember the days  
Of a blood red sky and a purple haze  
The flag was yours and the flag was mine but we let it fade away  
In the dark we still believe oh you know that we still believe  
In the dark we see  
chorus  
This is where it all comes down this is where the truth is found  
Someones gotta keep this dream alive  
We dream in color but we live in black and white  
We dream in color like a rainbow in the night  
We dream of peace we dream of love we dream of life  
We dream in color  
We dream in color we dream yes we dream  
We dream in color but we live in black and white  
We dream in color and hold on to each other  
We dream in color lover to lover sister to brother we hold on  
We dream in color repeats out
