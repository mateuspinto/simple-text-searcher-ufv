In the ink of an eye I saw you bleed  
Through the thunder I could hear you scream  
Solid to the air I breathe  
Openeyed and fast asleep  
Falling softly as the rain  
No footsteps ringing in your ears  
Ragged down worn to the skin  
Warrior raging have no fear  
  
Secure yourself to heaven  
Hold on tight the night has come  
Fasten up your earthly burdens  
You have just begun  
  
Kneeling down with broken prayers  
Hearts and bones from days of youth  
Restless with an angels wing  
I dig a grave to bury you  
No feet to fall  
You need no ground  
Allowed to glide right through the sun  
Released from circles guarded tight  
Now we all are chosen ones  
  
Secure yourself to heaven  
Hold on tight the night has come  
Fasten up your earthly burdens  
You have just begun
