When I wake up early in the morning  
Lift my head Im still yawning  
When Im in the middle of a dream  
Stay in bed float up stream Float up stream  
  
Please dont wake me no dont shake me  
Leave me where I am Im only sleeping  
  
Everybody seems to think Im lazy  
I dont mind I think theyre crazy  
Running everywhere at such a speed  
Till they find theres no need Theres no need  
  
Please dont spoil my day Im miles away  
And after all Im only sleeping  
  
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window  
Taking my time  
  
Lying there and staring at the ceiling  
Waiting for a sleepy feeling  
  
Please dont spoil my day Im miles away  
And after all Im only sleeping  
  
Ooh yeah  
  
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window  
Taking my time  
  
When I wake up early in the morning  
Lift my head Im still yawning  
When Im in the middle of a dream  
Stay in bed float up stream Float up stream  
  
Please dont wake me no dont shake me  
Leave me where I am Im only sleeping
