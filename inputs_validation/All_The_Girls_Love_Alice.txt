Raised to be a lady by the golden rule  
Alice was the spawn of a public school  
With a double barrel name in the back of her brain  
And a simple case of Mummydoesntloveme blues  
  
Reality it seems was just a dream  
She couldnt get it on with the boys on the scene  
But what do you expect from a chick whos just sixteen  
And hey hey hey you know what I mean  
  
All the young girls love Alice  
Tender young Alice they say  
Come over and see me  
Come over and please me  
Alice its my turn today  
  
All the young girls love Alice  
Tender young Alice they say  
If I give you my number  
Will you promise to call me  
Wait till my husbands away  
  
Poor little darling with a chip out of her heart  
Its like acting in a movie when you got the wrong part  
Getting your kicks in another girls bed  
And it was only last Tuesday they found you in the subway dead  
  
And who could you call your friends down in Soho  
One or two middleaged dykes in a GoGo  
And what do you expect from a sixteen year old yoyo  
And hey hey hey oh dont you know  
  
All the young girls love Alice  
Tender young Alice they say  
Come over and see me  
Come over and please me  
Alice its my turn today  
  
All the young girls love Alice  
Tender young Alice they say  
If I give you my number  
Will you promise to call me  
Wait till my husbands away
