live in fear  
live in fear  
live in fear  
  
dead end generation you should live in fear  
mass destruction corruption and no one cares  
white is the color of thos ein power  
red is the color of the millions slaughtered  
blue is the color of the flesh that rots  
urderers go free while some are never caught  
its been said before its time to listen  
tune into the news you dont know what youre missing  
  
lies decite injustice  
this is how our culture lives  
  
six year olds with fucking guns  
run away youth on the fucking run  
parents who abuse their kids  
yet were told be proud where we fucking live  
proud for crime proud for death  
proud for the fucking poor who tried their best  
told to vote cast your ballot  
but the vote only counts if youre the few in power  
  
lies decite injustice  
this is how our culture lives  
  
this is how our culture lives
