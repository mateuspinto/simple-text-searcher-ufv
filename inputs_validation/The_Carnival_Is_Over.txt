Say goodbye my one true lover  
And well steal a lovers song  
How it breaks my heart to leave you  
Now the carnival has gone  
  
  
Oh my love the dawn is breaking  
And my tears are falling rain  
For the carnival is over  
We may never meet again  
  
  
Like a drum my heart was beating  
And your kiss was sweet as wine  
But the joys of love are fleeting  
For Pierrot and Columbine  
  
  
Now the cloak of night is falling  
This will be our last goodbye  
Though the carnival is over  
I will love you till I die
