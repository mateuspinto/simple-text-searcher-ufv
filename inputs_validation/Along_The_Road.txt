Joy at the start  
Fear in the journey  
Joy in the coming home  
A part of the heart  
Gets lost in the learning  
Somewhere along the road  
  
Along the road  
Your path may wander  
A pilgrims faith may fail  
Absence makes the heart grow stronger  
Darkness obscures the trail  
  
Cursing the quest  
Courting disaster  
Measureless nights forebode  
Moments of rest  
Glimpses of laughter  
Are treasured along the road  
  
Along the road  
Your steps may tumble  
Your thoughts may start to stray  
But through it all a heart held humble  
Levels and lights your way  
  
Joy at the start  
Fear in the journey  
Joy in the coming home  
A part of the heart  
Gets lost in the learning  
Somewhere along the road  
Somewhere along the road  
Somewhere along the road
