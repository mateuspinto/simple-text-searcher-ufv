No I would not give you false hope  
On this strange and mournful day  
But the mother and child reunion  
Is only a motion away oh little darling of mine  
  
I cant for the life of me  
Remember a sadder day  
I know they say let it be  
But it just dont work out that way  
And the course of a lifetime runs  
Over and over again  
  
No I would not give you false hope  
On this strange and mournful day  
But the mother and child reunion  
Is only a motion away oh little darling of mine  
  
I just can t believe its so  
Though it seems strange to say  
I never been laid so low  
In such a mysterious way  
And the course of a lifetime runs  
Over and over again  
  
But I would not give you false hope  
On this strange and mournful day  
When the mother and child reunion  
Is only a motion away  
  
Oh the mother and child reunion  
Is only a motion away  
Oh the mother and child reunion  
Is only a moment away
