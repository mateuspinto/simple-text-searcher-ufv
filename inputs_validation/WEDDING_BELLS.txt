I have the invitation that you sent me  
You wanted me to see you change your name  
I couldnt stand to see you wed another  
But dear I hope youre happy just the same  
  
Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel  
That should be ringing out for you and me  
Down the aisle with someone else youre walking  
Those wedding bells will never ring for me  
  
I planned a little cottage in the valley  
I even bought a little band of gold  
I thought some day Id place it on your finger  
But now the future looks so dark and cold  
  
Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel  
I hear the children laughing out with glee  
At home alone I hang my head in sorrow  
Those wedding bells will never ring for me  
  
I fancy that I see a bunch of roses  
A blossom from an orange tree in your hair  
And while the organ plays I love you truly  
Please let me pretend that I am there  
  
Wedding bells are ringing in the chapel  
Ever since the day you set me free  
I knew someday that you would wed another  
But wedding bells will never ring for me
