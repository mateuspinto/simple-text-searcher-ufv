Well you can talk about your Perestroika  
And thats all right for you  
But Comrade Shevardnadze tell me

Well weve been fightin with the Mujahedeen  
Down in Afghanistan  
Comrade Gorbachev can I  
Go back to Vladivostok man  
  
Turmoil back in Moscow brought this turbulence down on me  
Turmoil back in Moscow brought this turbulence down on me  
  
Lost city on the red desert  
I hear voices of enemies from everywhere  
I miss my mother very much  
Village is lost in the red desert  
On all sides silence of an enemy  
And we want to see our mothers
