And we finally awake  
And walk into the sunny day  
I can see it in your face  
That everything will be okay  
  
Cause you never hurt  
Someone who wants to learn  
To be your slave  
  
And the night is oh so clear  
The clouds will never reappear  
But the moon is out of place  
And all the trees are looking strange  
  
And feeling the warmth of your breath  
Against my skin  
Now I hope this isnt only just a dream  
  
So we run into a church  
The people all look the same  
And the sun is in my eyes  
Im trying hard to scream your name  
  
My stomach starts to churn  
And the curtains in the wind begin to burn  
And now I know its all a dream  
  
Enemy sleeps with me night or day  
Enemy teases every minute in my mind  
Hes in my mind  
  
Enemy throws all my money away  
Enemy knows how to make me always pay  
I always pay  
  
Enemy lies dont cross my mind  
Enemy talks talking so nice and kind  
So nice and kind  
  
And how long does it take  
To fight off this weakness  
And tell him  
To guard me  
Cause God knows Im sorry
