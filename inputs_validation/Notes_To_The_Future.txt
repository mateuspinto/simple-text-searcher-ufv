Listen my children and you shall hear  
The sound of your own steps  
The sound of your hereafter  
Memory awaits and turns to greet you  
Draping its banner across your wrists  
Wake up arms  
Delicate feet  
For as one to march the streets  
  
Each alone each part of another  
Your steps shall ring  
Shall raise the cloud  
And they that will hear will hear  
Will hear voice of the one  
And the one and the one  
As it has never been uttered before  
  
For something greater yet to come  
Then the hour of the prophets  
And their great cities  
  
For the people of Ninevah  
Fell to their knees  
Heeding the cry of Jonah  
United  
Covering themselves in sackcloth and ashes  
And called to their god  
  
And all their hearts were as one heart  
And all their voices were as one voice  
  
God heard them and his mind was moved  
  
Yet something greater will come to pass  
And who will call  
And what will they call  
Will they call to God  
The air  
The fowl  
  
It will not matter if the call is true  
They shall call and this is known  
One voice and each another  
Shall enter the dead the living flower  
Enter forms that we know not  
To be felt by sea  
By air  
By earth  
And shall be an elemental pledge  
  
This is our birthright  
This is our charge  
And we have given over to others  
And they have  
Not  
Done  
Well  
  
And the forests mourn  
The leaves fall  
  
Swaddling babes watch and wonder  
As the fathers of our spirit nations  
Dance in the street in celebration  
As the mountains turn pale from  
Their nuclear hand  
And they have  
Not  
Done  
Well  
  
Now my children  
You must overturn the tables  
Deliver the future from material rule  
For only one rule should be considered  
  
The eleventh commandment  
To love one another  
And this is our covenant across your wrist  
  
This offering is yours  
To adorn adore  
To bury  
To burn  
Upon a mound  
  
To hail  
To set away  
  
It is merely a cloth  
Merely our colors  
Invested with the blood of the people  
All their hopes and dreams  
  
Our flag  
It has its excellence  
Yet it is nothing  
It shall not be a tyranny above us  
  
Nor should god  
Nor love  
Nor nature  
  
Yet we hold as our pleasure this tender honor  
That we acknowledge the individual  
And the common ground formed  
  
And if our cloth be raised and lowered  
Half mast  
What does it tell us  
  
That an individual has passed  
Is saluted  
And mourned by his countrymen  
  
This ritual extends to us all  
For we are all the individual  
  
No unknown  
No insignificant one  
Nor insignificant labor  
Nor insignificant act of charity  
  
Each has a story to be told and retold  
Which shall be a glowing thread  
In the fabric of Man  
  
And the children shall march  
And bring the colors forward  
Investing within them  
  
The redeeming blood  
Of their revolutionary hearts
