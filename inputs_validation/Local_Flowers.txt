I have traveled this world over I have rambled all my days  
When my journeys have all ended place some flowers on my grave  
Local flowers just some daisies wild wood flowers from the hills  
Where I will spend my eternal hours lay me down with local flowers  
  
Guitar  
  
Please dont buy those red carnations I dont need the lilies fair  
Just go walking on the mountain gather what is blooming there  
Rosemary means that youll remember clovers sweet as the love we shared  
Myrtle says that you will miss me rambling roses say you cared  
Local flowers just some daisies  
  
Guitar  
  
Let the bird sing from the tree tops let the grass grow where it may  
No arrangements no bright ribbons just a simple wild bouquet  
Local flowers just some daisies
