Been all around this whole round world  
Lord I just got back to day  
Worked all the way honey and I gave it all to you  
Honeybabe what more can I do  
Oh babe it aint no lie  
Oh babe it aint no lie  
Oh babe it aint no lie  
You know this life Im living is mighty high  
One more woman Lord in this town  
Keep her telling her lies on me  
Wish to my soul that old woman would die  
Keep her telling her lies on me
