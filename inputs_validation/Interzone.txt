I walked through the city limits  
Someone talked me in to do it  
Attracted by some force within it  
Had to close my eyes to get close to it  
Around a corner where a prophet lay  
Saw the place where shed had a room to stay  
A wire fence where the children played  
Saw the bed where the body lay  
And I was looking for some friends of mine  
And I had no time to waste  
Yeah looking for some friends of mine  
  
The cars screeched hear the sound on dust  
Heard a noise just a car outside  
Metallic blue turned red with rust  
Pulled in close by the buildings side  
In a group all forgotten youth  
Had to think collect my senses now  
Are turned on to a knife edged view  
Find some places where my friends dont know  
And I was looking for a friend of mine  
And had no time to waste  
Yeah looking for some friends of mine  
  
Down the dark streets the houses looked the same  
Getting darker now faces look the same  
And I walked round and round  
No stomach torn apart  
Nail me to a train  
Had to think again  
trying to find a clue trying to find a way to get out  
Trying to move away had to move away and keep out
