She said she wants a man  
To always understand  
But thats alright for her  
Still it aint enough for me  
She said she wants a guy  
To keep her satisfied  
But thats alright for her  
But it aint enough for me  
Still I dont care if hes young or old  
Just make him beautiful  
I just want someone I can hold on to  
I want muscles  
All all over his body  
Make him strong enough from his head down to his toes  
I want muscles  
All all over his body  
Make him strong enough from his head down to his toes  
They say they have to see  
His real personality  
But thats alright for them  
Still it aint enough for me  
I need what the eyes can see ah  
His anatomy  
If thats alright for them  
Still it aint enough for me  
I dont care if hes young or old  
Just make him beautiful  
I just want some strong man to hold on to  
I want muscles  
All all over his body  
Make him strong enough from his head down to his toes  
I want muscles  
All over his body  
Make him strong enough from his head down to his toes  
Muscle man I want to love you  
In person I want your body  
Come with me hiding the cascades  
Let this be weve got this thing made  
Lost at sea hide the desert  
Stay with me you wont regret it  
Take this love so deep to swim in  
Come to me and let the love in  
She said she wants a man
