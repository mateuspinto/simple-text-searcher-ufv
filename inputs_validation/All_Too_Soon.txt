All too soon  
We had to part  
The moment you had touched my heart  
And with you went my dream  
  
All too soon  
All too sweet  
Was our affair  
And you put all the sweetness there  
  
What a shame that its gone  
All too soon  
I knew the strange delights  
That only you in love could bring  
  
And as I reached the heights  
The bottom fell from everything  
You should know as well as I  
Our love deserves another try  
  
For we whispered goodbye  
All too soon  
Too soon
