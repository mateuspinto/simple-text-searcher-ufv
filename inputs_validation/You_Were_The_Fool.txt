Slow fourone two three four  
  
Bless the father bless the son  
Cross your heart cause youre the one  
Collectin moonbeams in the mornin  
Curvy sticks and wooden poles  
Assistin you in pluggin holes  
Plug them holes till you see straight through to the minds eye  
  
Think about it turn around  
And go back to the quiet sound  
Of Jim and Dan prancin round the pool  
You were the fool and I feel sorry for you  
You were the fool but theres something you can do  
  
You can wash your arm in a pool of mud  
You can chop a tree prevent a flood  
You can speak with a turtle just by flippin him around  
You can build a boat sail the sea  
You can buy a moat forge a key  
Initiate the sequence create catastrophe  
  
Think about it turn around  
And go back to the quiet sound  
Of Jim and Dan prancin round the pool  
You were the fool and I feel sorry for you  
You were the fool but theres something you can do  
  
Bless the father bless the son  
Cross your heart cause youre the one  
Collectin moonbeams in the mornin  
Curvy sticks and wooden poles  
Assistin you in pluggin holes  
Plug them holes till you see straight through to the minds eye  
  
Think about it turn around  
And go back to the quiet sound  
Of Jim and Dan prancin round the pool  
You were the fool and I feel sorry for you  
You were the fool but theres something you can do  
You were the fool
