Only reminds me of you  
  
I see you beside me  
Its only a dream  
A vision of what used to be  
The laughter the sorrow  
Pictures in time  
Fading to memory  
How could I ever let you go  
Isnt too late to let it show  
  
That I come to run from your side  
But this place I hide  
It only reminds me of you  
When I turn out of the light  
Even the night  
It only reminds me of you  
  
I needed my freedom  
This what Ive thought  
But I was a fool to believe  
My heart breaks while you cry  
Rivers of tears  
But I was too blind to see  
How could I ever let you go  
Isnt too late to let you show  
  
That I come to run from your side  
But this place I hide  
It only reminds me of you  
When I turn out of the light  
Even the night  
It only reminds me of you  
  
Only you  
  
Please come back to me  
Im down on my knees  
God give me strength  
  
That I come to run from your side  
But this place I hide  
It only reminds me of you  
When I turn out of the light  
Even the night  
It only reminds me of you
