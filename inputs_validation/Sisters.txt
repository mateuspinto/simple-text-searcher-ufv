Both Sisters sisters  
There were never such devoted sisters  
Never had to have a chaperone no sir  
Linda Im here to keep my eye on her  
  
Both Caring sharing  
Every little thing that we are wearing  
When a certain gentleman arrived from Rome  
Bette she wore the dress and I stayed home  
  
Both All kinds of weather we stick together  
The same in the rain or sun  
Two different faces but in tight places  
We think and we act as one Uhhuh  
  
Those whove seen us  
Know that not a thing can come between us  
Many men have tried to split us up but no one can  
Lord help the mister who comes between me and my sister  
And Lord help the sister that comes between me and my man
