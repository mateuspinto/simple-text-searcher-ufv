Aint got enough so I go out and get some more  
It got so bad it nearly left me lying on the floor  
I started thinking that its wearing on my soul  
But I got to get it getting tonight  
  
Raindrops keep fallin on my window pain  
They make my company  
I can hear them knocking on my door  
Now should I let them in  
  
When I look at the faces baby  
You see how the other side dies  
Ive got to got to got to  
Let them come on in  
  
Your lip service getting  
Right out of order  
Better keep looking  
Or Ill blow my cover  
  
Shell get caught by big sister midnight  
Ive been only telling stories  
You will only tell me lies  
  
I get the picture cause you never got my soul  
I get it handed back it turns into a tray of gold  
Thats just a victim of the promises you told  
I sit and count the cost of living tonight  
  
Bottle the past and number the label  
Drink to the future girl be ready and able  
Get a grip with a new fixation  
And take them all and let them all in  
  
When I look at their faces baby  
I see how the other side dies  
I got to got to got to  
Let them all come in  
  
Should I let them all come in  
Lies
