Beyond the sunset O blissful morning  
When with our Saviour heavens begun  
Earths toiling ended O glorious dawning  
Beyond the sunset when day is done  
  
Beyond the sunset no clouds will gather  
No storms will threaten no fears annoy  
O day of gladness O day unending  
Beyond the sunset eternal joy  
  
Beyond the sunset a hand will guide me  
To God the Father whom I adore  
His glorious presence His words of welcome  
Will be my portion on that fair shore  
  
Beyond the sunset O glad reunion  
With our dear loved ones whove gone before  
In that fair homeland well know no parting  
Beyond the sunset forever more
