People all over the world  
They get up they get down  
They get in they get out  
They get pushed they go back  
Start all over again  
Till they get to the end  
  
Im from a small town  
Had a poor family  
Mama was sick papa worked the factory  
I led a rich life  
Never had to work hard  
House in the country  
Horses in my backyard  
  
Next position please  
Do I have to get down on my knees  
Next position please  
Im in a hurry so hurry please  
  
Read between the lines  
Learn a new message  
Read the latest book  
Its a new twist  
Be the first one to have a new ideal  
Youll never get bored with mirrors on the ceiling  
  
Next position please  
Do I have to get down on my knees  
Next position please  
Im in a hurry so hurry please

I want to move up within the company  
I can do better with an opportunity  
Why dont they use me instead of abuse me  
Im ten out of ten not some whore in some movie  
I want to be the biggest gun in the world  
I want to see the tits on every girl  
  
Next position please  
You have to get down on your knees  
Next position please  
Im in a hurry so hurry please
