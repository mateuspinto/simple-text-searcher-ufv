The strange young man who comes to me  
A soldier on a three day spree  
He needs one nights cheap ecstasy  
And a womans arms to hide him  
He greets me with a courtly bow  
And hides his pain by acting proud  
He drinks too much and he laughs too loud  
How can I deny him  
  
Let us dance beneath the moon  
Ill sing to you Claire de Lune  
The morning always comes too soon  
But tonight the war is over  
He speaks to me in schoolboy French  
Of a soldiers life inside a trench  
Of the look of death and the ghastly stench  
I do my best to please him  
  
He puts two roses in a vase  
Two roses sadly out of place  
Like the gallant smile on his haggard face  
Playfully I tease him  
Hold me neath the Paris skies  
Lets not talk of how or why  
Tomorrows soon enough to die  
But tonight the war is over  
We make love too hard too fast  
He falls asleep his face a mask  
He wakes with the shakes and he drinks from his flask  
I put my arms around him  
  
They die in the trenches and they die in the air  
In Belgium and France the dead are everywhere  
They die so so fast theres no time to prepare  
A decent grave to surround them  
Old world glory old world fame  
The old worlds gone gone up in flames  
Nothing will ever be the same  
And nothing lasts forever  
Oh Id pray for him but Ive forgotten how  
And theres nothing nothing that can save him now  
Theres always another with the same funny bow  
And who am I to deny them  
  
Lux aeterna Luceat eis  
Domine cum sancris tuis in aeternum  
Quia pius es  
Requiem aeternaum dona eis Domine  
Quia pius es  
Requiem aeternaum dona eis Domine  
Quia pius es  
Et lux perpetua luceat eis cum sancris tuis ina cap
