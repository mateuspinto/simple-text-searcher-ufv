Oh thou who givest sustenance to the universe  
From whom all things proceed  
To whom all things return  
Unveil to us the face of the true spiritual sun  
Hidden by a disk of golden light  
That we may know the truth  
And do our whole duty  
As we journey to thy sacred feet  
  
Well I said  
Lily Oh Lily I dont feel safe  
I feel that life has blown a great big hole through me  
And she said  
Child you must protect yourself  
Ill show you how with fire  
  
Gabriel before me  
Raphael behind me  
Michael to my right  
Uriel on my left side  
In the circle of fire  
  
I said  
Lily Oh Lily Im so afraid  
I fear I am walking in the Veil of Darkness  
And she said  
Child take what I say  
With a pinch of salt  
And protect yourself with fire  
  
Gabriel before me  
Raphael behind me  
Michael to my right  
Uriel on my left side  
In the circle of fire
