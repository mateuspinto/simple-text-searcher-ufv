So you speak to me of sadness  
And the coming of the winter  
Fear that is within you now  
It seems to never end  
  
And the dreams that have escaped you  
And the hope that youve forgotten  
You tell me that you need me now  
You want to be my friend  
  
And you wonder where were going  
Wheres the rhyme and wheres the reason  
And its you cannot accept  
It is here we must begin  
To seek the wisdom of the children  
And the graceful way of flowers in the wind  
  
Chorus  
For the children and the flowers  
Are my sisters and my brothers  
Their laughter and their loveliness  
Could clear a cloudy day  
  
Like the music of the mountains  
And the colours of the rainbow  
Theyre a promise of the future  
And a blessing for today  
Though the cities start to crumble  
And the towers fall around us  
The sun is slowly fading  
And its colder than the sea  
  
It is written from the desert  
To the mountains they shall lead us  
By the hand and by the heart  
They will comfort you and me  
In their innocence and trusting  
They will teach us to be free  
  
Chorus  
  
And the song that I am singing  
Is a prayer to non believers  
Come and stand beside us  
We can find a better way
