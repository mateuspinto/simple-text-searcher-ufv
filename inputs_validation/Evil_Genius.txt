They were so ecstatic when the letter arrived  
A certified genius at the age of five  
They planned his future so carefully  
He was everything they hoped hed be  
He was a model child a devoted son  
Loved and admired by everyone  
He played out every role a TV hero  
He lived his life in a video fantasy  
  
He was good at school never failed a grade  
They gave him hopes and dreams and taught him not to hate  
He had rules he learned to break for fun  
Now hes hidin cause his fingerprints on the gun  
  
Whyd ya have to do it Evil Genius  
Was it justified in your mind  
Whyd ya put us through it Evil Genius  
Was it justified in your mind anytime you held a grudge  
  
Was it something said that pushed you over the line  
Your best interests were in our minds  
You kept it so well hidden we never knew  
No one ever expected anything like this from you  
  
Whyd ya have to do it Evil Genius  
Was it justified in your mind  
Whyd ya put us through it Evil Genius  
Was it justified in your mind anytime you held a grudge  
  
Whyd ya have to do it Evil Genius  
Was it justified in your mind  
Whyd ya put us through it Evil Genius  
Was it justified in your mind anytime you held a grudge
