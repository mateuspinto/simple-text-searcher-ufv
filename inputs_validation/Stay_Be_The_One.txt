I saw you last night  
Down at the mere  
I saw your hands were playing gently with her hair  
I see you and I in my mirror  
I close my eyes and wish that you could be here  
Its my fantasy to have you holding me baby  
Going privately crazy  
Do you know what you do with me  
  
Chrous  
Stay make my blue moon bright for a change  
Make my dreams end right  
Dont stay afraid  
Be the one  
  
yea eyeyey  
  
Get out of my head get into my heart  
Be for real are you fictional or real  
I made up this lie I made up this life  
When Im alone its like youre right here by my side  
Its my fantasy to have you here with me baby  
Going privately crazy  
If you came I know just what Id say  
  
Stay make my blue moon bright for a change  
Make my world turn right  
Dont stay afraid  
Be the one  
  
heye yeyeyeye  
  
Its my fantasy to have you all to me baby  
Im going privately crazy  
Do you know what you do with me  
  
Stay make my blue moon bright for a change  
Make my dreams end right  
Dont stay afraid  
Be the one
