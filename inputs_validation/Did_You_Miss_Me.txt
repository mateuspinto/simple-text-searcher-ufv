Tell me did you miss me while I was gone  
did you wanna kiss me when you were alone  
Did you sit and stare at the telephone  
did you miss me while I was gone  
Our love is came so suddenly and still is so new  
I just want to know if you feel like I do  
Did you think about me while I was away and  
did every hour seem like a day  
Was it something inside that you just couldnt say  
did you miss me while I was away  
Our love came so suddenly and still is so new  
I just want to know if you feel like I do  
Tell me did you miss me while I was gone did you wanna kiss me when you were
alone  
Did you sit and stare at the telephone did you miss me while I was gone
