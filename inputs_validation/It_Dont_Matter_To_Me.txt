It dont matter to me  
If you really feel that  
You need sometime to be free  
Time to go out searching for yourself  
Hoping to find time to go to find  
  
And it dont matter to me  
If you take up with someone  
Whos better than me  
Cause your happiness is all I want  
For you to find your piece of mind  
  
Lotta people have an ego hang up  
Cause they want to be the only one  
How many came before it really doesnt matter  
Just as long as youre the last  
Everybodys moving on and try to find out  
Whats been missing in the past  
  
And it dont matter to me  
If your searching brings you back together with me  
Cause therell always be  
An empty room waiting for you  
An open heart waiting for you  
Time is on my side  
Cause it dont matter to me  
  
It dont matter to me  
It dont matter to me  
It dont matter to me  
It dont matter to me  
It dont matter to me  
  
Cause therell always be  
An empty room waiting for you  
An open heart waiting for you  
Time is on my side  
Cause it dont matter to me
