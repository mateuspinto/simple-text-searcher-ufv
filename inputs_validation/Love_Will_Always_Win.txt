Hold Me  
Like Theres No Tomorrow  
There Can Be No Sorrow  
Right Here Where We Stand  
  
Living  
Only For A Moment  
All I Ever Wanted  
Is Right Here In My Hands  
  
Some Will Say  
That Were Sure To Fall  
Try To Build Their Walls  
Between Us Yeah  
  
No Way Over It  
No Way Around It Boy  
If We Want It  
We Have To Go Through It  
Fight For Love  
And The World Tries To Break Us Down  
But The World Will Bend  
And The Fight Will End  
Love Will Always Win  
  
Hold On  
til We See Tomorrow  
There Is Time To Borrow  
til We Own Our Own  
  
Walk On  
And Our Hearts Will Lead Us  
But Our Hearts Will Need Us  
To Be Steady And Strong  
  
So We Can Stand  
And Face The Fire  
Burning Higher  
Surrounding Us Yeah  
  
No Way Over It  
No Way Around It Boy  
If We Want It  
We Have To Go Through It  
Fight For Love  
And The World Tries To Break Us Down  
Oh But The World Will Bend  
And The Fight Will End  
Love Will Always Win  
  
No Way Over It  
No Way Around It Boy  
If We Want It  
We Have To Go Through It  
Fight For Love  
And The World  
Tries To Break Us Down  
But The World Will Bend  
Ooh  
And The Fight Will End  
The World Will Bend  
And The Fight Will End  
Love Will Always Win
