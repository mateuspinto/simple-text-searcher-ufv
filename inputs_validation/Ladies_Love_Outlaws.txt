Bessie was a lovely child from west Tennessee  
Leroy was an outlaw wild as a mink  
One day she saw him starin and it chilled her to the bone  
And she knew she had to see that look on a child of her own  
  
Cause ladies love outlaws like babies love stray dogs  
Ladies touch babies like a banker touches gold  
And outlaws touch the ladies  
Somewhere deep down in their soul  
  
Linda was a lady blonde and built to last  
Benny was a no good guitar picker runnin from his past  
She heard all of his songs tellin nothin but bad news  
But she made her mind up to try to get him win or lose  
  
Ladies love outlaws like babies love stray dogs  
Ladies touch babies like a banker touches gold  
And outlaws touch the ladies  
Somewhere deep down in their soul  
  
Jessi like the Cadillacs and diamonds on her hands  
Waymore had a reputation as a ladies man  
Late one night a light of love finally gave a sign  
Jessi parked her Cadillac and took her place in line  
  
Cause ladies love outlaws like babies love stray dogs  
Ladies touch babies like a banker touches gold  
And outlaws touch the ladies  
Somewhere deep down in their soul  
  
Ladies love outlaws like babies love stray dogs  
Ladies touch babies like a banker touches gold  
And outlaws touch the ladies  
Somewhere deep down in their soul
