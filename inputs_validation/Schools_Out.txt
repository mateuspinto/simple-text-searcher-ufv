Well we got no choice  
All the girls and boys  
Makin all that noise  
Cause they found new toys  
Well we cant salute ya  
Cant find a flag  
If that dont suit ya  
Thats a drag  
  
Schools out for summer  
Schools out forever  
Schools been blown to pieces  
  
No more pencils  
No more books  
No more teachers dirty looks  
  
Well we got no class  
And we got no principles  
And we got no innocence  
We cant even think of a word that rhymes  
  
Schools out for summer  
Schools out forever  
Schools been blown to pieces  
  
No more pencils  
No more books  
No more teachers dirty looks  
Out for summer  
Until fall  
We might not go back at all  
  
Schools out for forever  
Schools out summer  
Schools out with fever  
Schools out completely
