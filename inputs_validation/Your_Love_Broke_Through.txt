Like a foolish dreamer trying to build a highway to the sky  
All my hopes would come tumbling down and I never knew just why  
Until today when you pulled away the clouds that hung like curtains on my
eyes  
Well Ive been blind all these wasted years and I thought I was so wise  
But then you took me by surprise  
  
Like waking up from the longest dream how real it seemed  
Until your love broke through  
Ive been lost in a fantasy that blinded me  
Until your love broke through  
  
All my life Ive been searching for that crazy missing part  
And with one touch you just rolled away the stone that held my heart  
And now I see that the answer was as easy as just asking you in  
And I am so sure I could never doubt your gentle touch again  
Its like the power of the wind  
  
Like waking up from the longest dream how real it seemed  
Until your love broke through  
Ive been lost in a fantasy that blinded me  
Until your love until your love broke through
