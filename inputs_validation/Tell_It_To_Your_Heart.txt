I was staring through a telescope at night  
At a large light in the sky  
Its spinning lights reminded me of you  
A star spinning in orbit  
Lighting up the sky  
Or maybe it was not a star at all  
  
I was standing by the hudson rivers edge at night  
Looking out across the Jersey shore  
At a neon light spelling out some colas name  
And I thought your name should be dancing  
Beamed from satellites  
Larger than any billboard in Times Square  
  
Tell it to your heart please dont be afraid  
Im the one who loves you in each and every way  
Tell it to your heart please dont be afraid  
NYC lovers  
Tell it to your heart  
Tell it to your heart please dont be afraid  
Tell it to your heart  
Tell it to your heart please dont be afraid  
Tell it to your heart  
  
Im on the roof its 5 am  
I guess I couldnt sleep  
And I see this spinning light that I saw last week  
Maybe I should wake you up  
But by then it might be gone  
You never know what you see when if you look up in the sky  
  
I ran outside down a darkened street  
Listening to my boot heels click  
My leather jacket squeaked I needed a cigarette  
When I turned the corner  
My spinning light was in the street  
They were filming a commercial on TV  
  
Tell it to your heart please dont be afraid  
Were no teenage movie that ends in tragedy  
Tell it to your heart please dont be afraid  
NYC lovers  
Tell it to your heart Repeat x 3  
  
Tell it to your heart please dont be afraid  
Tell it to your heart  
Repeat x 2
