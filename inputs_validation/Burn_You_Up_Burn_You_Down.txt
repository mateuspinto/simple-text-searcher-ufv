Straight as an arrow  
Carry your intentions to the wind  
Dogs all around you  
But you cannot get the message to your friend  
  
At every rendezvous you keep on walking around  
Nighttime in the city and the rain keeps falling down  
  
Let me tell you how it all works out  
Never thought we had so much time to lose  
Just learning how to twist and shout  
Doesnt matter much which damn beat you use  
Let me tell you how it all works out  
Never thought we had so much time to lose  
Just learning how to twist and shout  
Doesnt matter much which damn beat you use  
  
Ill wind blows the road to go  
How many times weve told you so  
Burn you up and Ill burn you down  
Burn you up and Ill burn you down  
No rhyme or reason  
No way to make it easy til its done  
Burn you up and Ill burn you down  
Burn you up and Ill burn you down  
So you cross onto the other side of the street  
Burn you up and Ill burn you down  
Burn you up and Ill burn you down  
Should know better but you keep turning up the heat  
  
Let me tell you how it all works out  
Never thought we had so much time to lose  
Just learning how to twist and shout  
Doesnt matter much which damn beat you use  
Let me tell you how it all works out  
Never thought we had so much time to lose  
Just learning how to twist and shout  
Doesnt matter much which damn beat you use  
  
Ohohaiai  
hey hey hey hey  
Let me feel this  
hey hey hey hey  
Heyey Hey Hey  
hey hey hey hey  
Make me feel it  
hey hey hey hey  
  
When they lose you it can bruise you  
Burn you up and Ill burn you down  
Burn you up and Ill burn you down  
Break me open I need someone to see me  
Burn you up and Ill burn you down  
Burn you up and Ill burn you down  
Make me feel it make me feel  
  
In the city and the rain is falling down  
Burn you up and Ill burn you down  
Burn you up and Ill burn you down  
You can make it happen with your eyes with your eyes alone  
  
Let me tell you how it all works out  
Never thought we had so much time to lose  
Just learning how to twist and shout  
Doesnt matter much which damn beat you use  
Let me tell you how it all works out  
Never thought we had so much time to lose  
Just learning how to twist and shout  
Doesnt matter much which damn beat you use  
  
Break me open  
Let me tell you how it all works out  
Never thought we had so much time to lose  
Make me feel it  
Just learning how to twist and shout  
Doesnt matter much which damn beat you use  
Break me open  
Let me tell you how it all works out  
Never thought we had so much time to lose  
Make me feel it  
You make me feel it  
Just learning how to twist and shout  
Doesnt matter much which damn beat you use  
  
You can make me feel it  
You can make me you can make me you can make me feel it  
You can make me feel it  
You can make me feel it  
You can make me feel it
