Bad time for love  you caught me on your birthday  
I could feel your heart break into a hundred pieces  
We were too torn apart now it seems so senseless  
And if were clever well put it together it may be forever  
  
Chorus  
  
We made it made it made it before I know that we can make it again  
We made it made it made it before I know that we can make it again  
  
Down on my luck you arrived just in time my angel  
Thought youd given me up like a rhyme that needs no reason  
I want you enough to keep my life untangled  
If were clever well put it together cause it may be forever  
  
I want you enough to keep my life untangled  
If were clever well put it together cause it may be forever  
  
If ever well make it were gonna make it girl  
And I know we can take it we got to take it girl  
  
If ever we can make it we gotta make it  
And I know we can take it
