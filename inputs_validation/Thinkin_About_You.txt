Well I been thinkin about you wonderin about you  
Wonderin if you miss me too  
Well I been thinkin about you wonderin about you  
Hopin that you love me too  
I went to see a movie I was feelin blue  
When I looked at my ticket I bought seats for two  
Well I been thinkin about you wonderin about you  
Wonderin if you miss me too  
Well I been thinkin about you wonderin about you  
Hopin that you love me too  
I was gettin hungry some popcorn would do  
When the girl asked me how many I quickly answered two  
Well I been thinkin about you wonderin about you  
Wonderin if you miss me too  
Well I been thinkin about you wonderin about you  
Hopin that you love me too  
  
I left the movies early still feelin blue  
But when I went to bed I still had on my shoes  
Cause I been thinkin about you wonderin about you  
Wonderin if you miss me too  
Well I been thinkin about you wonderin about you  
Hopin that you love me too
