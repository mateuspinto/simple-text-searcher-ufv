He was rolling in the rumor that he was the loser king for a day  
She was kinda crosseyed  
She was damaged in a beautiful way  
He was addicted to her body  
When she opened up her legs and her heart  
She was good at all the simple things  
She was addicted to the subtle way hed rip her apart  
It was a shameless use of charm  
She was delighted with the promise of a life of being bored and annoyed  
He was happy with the pictures that he painted with distortion and noise  
He was a sexaddicted user with a certain kind of flair  
He did really not care that she was dumb and unaware  
She was strong when they were naked and alone in the dark  
It was a shameless use of charm  
Everybody says theyre looking for the fairy tale  
No they are just looking for a way to fall  
Everybody says they are looking for the true love lost  
True love lost  
He was big bigger than the life she knew  
Back when she was good with being slow and confused  
She was clean  
The best thing he had ever seen  
She looked just like those girls he saw in Playboy magazine  
They were lost  
They were looking for the easy dream  
Living high on borrowed time and running low on selfesteem  
They were lost  
They were helpless to the rush  
It felt just like a white drug  
Everybody says theyre looking for the fairy tale  
No they are just looking for a way to fall  
Everybody says theyre looking for the happy ending  
No they are just looking for a way to fall soft  
Just like anyone they are just like everyone  
They were looking for the easy way to have it all  
Everybody says that they are looking for the true love lost  
True love lost  
True love lost  
True love lost
