No one on earth could feel like this  
Im thrown and overflown with bliss  
There must be an angel  
Playing with my heart  
  
I walk into an empty room  
And suddenly my heart goes boom  
Its an orchestra of angels  
And theyre playing with my heart  
Must be talking to an angel  
  
No one on earth could feel like this  
Im thrown and overflown with bliss  
There must be an angel  
Playing with my heart  
  
And when I think that Im alone  
It seems theres more of us at home  
Its a multitude of angels  
And theyre playing with my heart  
  
I must be hallucinating  
Watching angels celebrating  
Could this be reactivating  
All my senses dislocating  
This must be a strange deception  
By celestial intervention  
Leavin me the recollection  
Of your heavenly connection
