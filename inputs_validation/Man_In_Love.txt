Youre always in my hair you keep me feeling fine  
I celebrate every time I realize youre really mine  
  
Chorus  
Cause Im a man in love  
Yes Im a man in love  
I tell it everywhere I go  
I want the whole world to know  
That Im a man in love  
  
I used to be so sad like a dog without a bone  
And then you gave me something baby I had never known  
  
Chorus  
  
I love to see you walk up and down the street  
You look so pretty baby from your head down to your feet  
  
Chorus  
  
Well the minutes seem like hours and the hours seem like days  
And the days they seem like years every time you go away  
  
Chorus
