Judas kiss  
Kiss of betrayal  
I will not let it break me  
Elation  
You come my way come my way  
Oh baby oh baby  
I will not let it break me  
Here you come  
My heart breaking  
Im in love  
For you and more  
This young man  
Got a long way to go  
Got some thorns  
Stuck in his side  
Here you come  
My heart breaking  
Im in love  
For you and more  
Judas kiss  
Kiss of betrayal  
I will not let it break me  
Here you come  
My heart breaking  
Im in love  
For you and more  
You come my way  
Elation  
Here you come  
My heart breaking  
Im in love  
For you and more
