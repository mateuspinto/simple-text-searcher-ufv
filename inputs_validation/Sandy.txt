Sandy the aurora is risin behind us  
Those pier lights our carnival life forever  
Oh love me tonight for I may never see you again  
Hey sandy girl my baby  
  
Sandy the fireworks are hailin over little eden tonight  
Forcin a light into all those stony faces left stranded on this warm july  
And the boys from the casino dance with their shirts open like latin lovers on
the shore  
Chasin all those silly new york virgins by the score  
  
Sandy the aurora is risin behind us  
Those pier lights our carnival life forever  
Oh love me tonight and I promise Ill love you forever  
Oh I mean it sandy girl oh my baby  
Hey sandy girl my baby  
  
Sandy the waitress I was seein lost her desire for me  
I spoke with her last night she said she wont set herself on fire for me
anymore  
Did you hear the cops finally busted madame marie for tellin fortunes better
than they do  
For me this boardwalk life is through you ought to quit this scene too  
  
Chorus  
  
Hey sandy girl oh my baby  
Hey sandy girl my baby
