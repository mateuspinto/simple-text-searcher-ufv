So close no matter how far  
Couldnt be much more from the heart  
Forever trusting who we are  
And nothing else matters  
  
Never opened myself this way  
Life is ours we live it our way  
All these words I dont just say  
And nothing else matters  
  
Trust I seek and I find in you  
Every day for us something new  
Open mind for a different view  
And nothing else matters  
  
Never cared for what they do  
Never cared for what they know  
But I know  
  
So close no matter how far  
Couldnt be much more from the heart  
Forever trusting who we are  
And nothing else matters  
  
Never cared for what they do  
Never cared for what they know  
But I know  
  
I never opened myself this way  
Life is ours we live it our way  
All these words I dont just say  
Nothing else matters  
  
Trust I seek and I find in you  
Every day for us something new  
Open mind for a different view  
And nothing else matters  
  
Never cared for what they say  
Never cared for games they play  
Never cared for what they do  
Never cared for what they know  
And I know yeah  
  
So close no matter how far  
Couldnt be much more from the heart  
Forever trusting who we are  
No nothing else matters
