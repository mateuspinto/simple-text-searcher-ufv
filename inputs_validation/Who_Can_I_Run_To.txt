Verse One  
LaTocha  
As I stand here contemplating  
On the right thing to decide  
Will I take the wrong direction  
All my life where will I go  
What lies ahead of me  
Tamika  
I have strong determination  
And Im not afraid of change  
I have yet to find that someone  
Who would care to satisfy me  
To stay right by me  
  
Chorus  
Who can I run to  
To share this empty space  
Who can I run to  
When I need love  
Who can I run to  
To fill this empty space with laughter  
Who can I run to  
When I need love  
  
Verse Two  
Tiny  
And my mind is so confusing  
Who would be that special one  
Everyday Im trying to find you  
All along Ive got to know  
Is there a place for me  
LaTocha  
I know love has many names  
And a message very clear  
All it takes is time and patience  
To bring you near  
But look at me tell me  
  
Repeat Chorus
