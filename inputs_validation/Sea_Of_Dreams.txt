Little girl in the sea of dreams  
Theres a smile on her little face  
She looked around she could see no peace  
Her heart was sad and her body weak  
  
Dum dum doobydum dum dum  
Dum dum doobydum dum dum  
  
But in her dream she was big and strong  
She fell in love with a sailor  
He travelled far off to distant lands  
He never travelled to see her  
  
Dum dum doobydum dum dum  
Dum dum doobydum dum dum  
  
Then one night a strange man did come  
He whispered words unto her mother  
Little girl in the sea of dreams  
She closed her eyes and met her maker
