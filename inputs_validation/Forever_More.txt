Baby Ive just been sitting here thinking how blessed I am to have someone  
Like you in my life and Im so excited so so excited about being with you for  
The rest of my life Listen  
  
Looking at all theses hand damn I use to be a lonely man could never  
Understand why I had no one to take my hand but then the weather changed  
Mothernature brought the sun my way now girl your who I am and I have you
for  
The rest of my days  
  
Chorus  
How the sun comes up in the early morning time girl I vowel to be forever  
Loving you rain or shine How the moon takes us on this romantic globe Ill be  
Loving you forever more oh oh yeah  
  
Now I used to think that I would never have a serious relationship always  
Praying for that one to come along and give me what I miss but now those  
Thoughts are no more every since you came into my life its like heaven  
Opened up its doors showered down on me the perfect wife oh oh  
  
How the sun comes up in the early morning time girl I vowel to be forever  
Loving you rain or shine How the moon takes us on this romantic globe Ill be  
Loving you forever more oh oh yeah oh yeah  
  
Baby now our house our house is a home the car we own whats mine is  
Yours the keys to the doors my family my family my friend my friends the  
Church we belong together Heaven drum say our house is a home the car we  
Own whats mine is yours the keys to the doors my family my family my  
Friend my friends the church we belong together and its on  
  
Chorus x5
