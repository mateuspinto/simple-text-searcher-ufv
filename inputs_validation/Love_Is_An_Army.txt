Fear is an army  
Fighting against me  
Fighting a lost cause  
If I could only change their uniform  
Theyd be soldiers of love  
Marching on and on  
  
Love is an army  
Waiting for me  
Waiting for this girl  
If I could only stretch my arms around you  
Id suddenly see  
There aint nothin wrong with me  
Hear  
  
Chorus  
Words fly out  
The roof of my mouth  
They found a flaw  
In my armor  
Heart so still  
Your beating will  
Heal the wars I remembr  
remember  
  
Blue is the ocean  
Calling me in  
Calling me near  
If I could learn  
To breathe down here  
I know I would be  
At home under the sea  
Yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Ill bend my sword  
Against the world  
Ill push on through  
In spite of you  
  
Love is an army  
Waiting for me  
Waiting for this girl
