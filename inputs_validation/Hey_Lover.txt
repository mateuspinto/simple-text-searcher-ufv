Ive been watching you from a far  
For as long as I can remember  
Youre all a real man could need  
And could ever ask for  
This is more than a crush  
Yeah  
  
It was Harlem at the ruckus  
I saw you with your man a smiling huh  
A coach bag in your hand  
I was laying in the coupe with my hat turned back  
We caught eyes for a moment and that was that  
  
So I skated off as you strolled off  
Looking at your legs god damn they look so soft so fine  
I gotta take ya from your man thats my mission  
If his love is real hes got to handle competition  
You only knew him five months thats right  
Besides he drinks too much and smokes too many blunts  
  
And Ill be working out everyday thinkin about you  
Looking at my own eyes in the rear view  
Catching flashbacks of our eye contact  
Wish I could lay you on your stomach and caress your back  
I would hold you in my arms and ease your fears  
I cant believe it I aint had a crush in years  
  
Chorus  
Hey lover hey lover  
This is more than a crush  
Hey lover hey lover  
This is more than a crush lover  
Hey lover this is more than a crush  
Hey lover hey lover  
This is more than a crush  
  
I see you at the bus stop waiting every day  
Your man must think its safe for you to travel that way  
And I dont want to violate your relationship  
So Ill lay back in the cut with a crush thats a trip  
  
Still he cant stop me from having daydreams  
Tonguen you down with uh vanilla ice cream  
Kissing on your thighs in the moonlight  
Searching you body with my tongue girl all night  
  
I wonder one day could it be how I wonder  
Simple dreams could turn into reality  
Our love would come down so naturally  
We would walk down the aisle of destiny  
  
Would your man get his hustle on got your type scared  
Break your off a little chump change to do your hair  
It seems to be enough to satisfy your needs  
But theres a deeper level if you follow our lead hey lover  
  
Chorus  
  
Last week I saw ya at the mall  
Standing at the pay phone about to make a call  
I had a vision it was me on the other end  
Telling you come by and then you walked in  
  
I touched you gently with my hands  
We talked about traveling the distant lands  
Escaping all the madness out here in the world  
Becoming my wife no longer my girl  
  
Then you let your dress fall down to the floor oh yeah  
I kissed you softly and you yearned for more  
We experienced pleasure unparalleled  
Into an ocean of love we both fell  
  
Swimming in the timeless currents of pure bliss  
Fantasies interchanging with each kiss  
Undying passion unites our souls  
Together we swim until the point of no control  
  
But its a fantasy you wont come true  
We never even spoke and your man swears he love you  
So Im gonna keep all these feelings aside thats right  
Keep my dreams alive until the right time  
  
Chorus  
  
Aint nothing like a fantasy kid  
Words up  
Hey lover hey lover hey lover this is more than a crush  
Hey lover hey lover hey lover this is more than a crush  
Hey lover hey lover hey lover this is more than a crush  
Hey lover hey lover hey lover this is more than a crush  
Hey lover
