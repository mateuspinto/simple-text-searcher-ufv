And the road and the road  
And the car and the car  
And your wrist touching my hair  
We know we are traveling far far  
But havent decided on where  
And the sound of my name in your mouth  
Is spicy and sweet or as soft as a prayer  
I say lets turn to the south  
There is nothing and everything there  
  
Theres a bottle of water a bag of dates  
An orange that I can peel  
I can tell you a story or sing if you want  
If youre falling asleep at the wheel  
We can talk about when we were kids  
And we thought there was nothing we couldnt achieve  
Then years passed by and blinded our eyes  
Now we need something else you believe  
  
Oooh something else to believe  
  
You are silent for hours I hum and I hum  
I feel on the verge of a song  
I wait for the words to come when they come  
Lucky the road is long  
And the music I hear in my head  
Is the dance of the wind  
Sweeping over the plain  
The shade of your eyes  
The shifting skies  
And the rest only love can explain  
  
Oooh only love can explain  
  
At the top of the mountain the view is stunning  
But soon it gives way to the night  
You say you can tell its the end of the tunnel  
You ask if Ive seen the light  
The slope is steep  
But the road keeps taking us down  
To the river below  
The sound of the wheels the endless fields  
And Ill go wherever you go  
  
Oooh go wherever you go
