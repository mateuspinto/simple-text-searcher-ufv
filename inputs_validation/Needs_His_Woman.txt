You left him standing in the pouring rain  
Theres every chance hell go insane  
And someone comes along and takes his hand  
He must have love cant you understand that  
  
Chorus  
He needs his woman  
He needs his woman  
And he needs his woman  
He needs his woman to love  
  
His hands are shaking and his head hangs down  
No peace of mind for him is found  
Break his heart and then youll set him free  
Someone must save him just you wait and see but  
  
Chorus  
  
What will it take till you believe his love is real  
Nobody said he had to love you now he always will  
  
Hell walk that lonely road again today  
The love he gave you you threw away  
When all he wanted was a hand to hold  
His lonely world has grown so cold and  
  
Chorus x2
