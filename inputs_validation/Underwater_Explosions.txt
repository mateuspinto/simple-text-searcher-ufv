Once she was down and she opened crate of secrets darker than she  
Underwater explosions curtains rippling obviously  
  
She can breathe  
Since Ive been tired she can breathe  
And the shocks are bound to please  
And she points to me  
  
To insist on facing the salt and it stings  
And certainly that changes things  
And she points to me  
Something passes through me  
  
Cups painted orange and sunburst  
Lined up side by side  she keeps them so clean  
Brightly they shine in the starlight  
But darker places Ive never seen  
  
She can breathe  
Since Ive been tired she can breathe  
And the shocks are bound to please  
And she points to me  
  
To insist on facing the salt and it stings  
And certainly that changes things  
And she points to me  
Something passes through me  
  
And the sound will carry you on
