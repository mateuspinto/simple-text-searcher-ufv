Deep down in my heart  
There is a lot of words  
Tears fall down my face  
But I hear the many voices that cry in pain  
  
I want to tell you  
Dont give it up  
I want to tell you  
Dont give it up  
Dont give it up  
  
Hear the voices wraps around you  
All the people never doubt it  
Hear the voices take a look at whats around you  
All the people we can change things never doubt it  
  
We wont take new start  
Is it just too much to ask  
Ooh what does it take  
Cause I hear a million people singing the same  
  
I want to tell you  
Dont give it up  
I want to tell you  
Dont give it up  
Dont give it up  
  
Hear the voices wraps around you  
All the people never doubt it  
Hear the voices take a look at whats around you  
All the people we can change it  
We can change it  
  
Hear the voices all the people  
Hear the voices all the people  
  
Hear the voices all the people  
All the people  
Hear the voices all the people  
  
Hear the voices all the people Repeat x5
