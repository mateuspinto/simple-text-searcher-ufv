Eternal life is now on my trail  
Got my red glitter coffin man just need one last nail  
While all these ugly gentlemen play out their foolish games  
Theres a flaming red horizon that screams our names  
And as your fantasies are broken in two  
Did you really think this bloody road would  
Pave the way for you  
You better turn around  
And blow your kiss hello to life eternal angel  
Racist everyman what have you done  
Man youve made a killer of your unborn son  
Crown my fear your king at the point of a gun  
All i want to do is love everyone  
And as your fantasies are broken in two  
Did you really think this bloody road would  
Pave the way for you  
You better turn around  
And blow your kiss hello to life eternal  
Theres no time for hatred only questions  
What is love where is happiness what is life where is peace  
When will I find the strength to bring me release  
And tell me where is the love in what your prophet has said  
Man it sounds to me just like a prison for the walking dead  
And ive get a message for you and your twisted hell  
You better turn around  
And blow your kiss goodbye to life eternal angel
