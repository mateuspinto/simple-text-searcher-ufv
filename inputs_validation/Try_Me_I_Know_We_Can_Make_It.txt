We can make it if we try  
We can make it get on high  
  
I want to come up there with you right now  
And reach the stormy top  
I want to hold on tight with all my might  
And pray youll never stop  
  
We can make it if we try  
We can make it touch the sky  
We can make it if we try  
We can make it get on high  
  
Try me I know we can make it  
I know if we try  
Try me I know we can make it  
I know if we try
