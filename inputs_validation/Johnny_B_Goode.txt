Way down in Louisiana close to New Orleans  
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens  
There stood a log cabin mad of earth and wood  
Where lived a country boy name of Johnny B Goode  
He never ever learned to read or write so well  
But he could play a guitar just like aringing a bell  
  
Chorus  
Go go go Johnny go  
Go go Johnny go  
Go go Johnny go  
Go go Johnny go  
Go Johnny B Goode  
  
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack  
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track  
The engineers would see him sitting in the shade  
Strumming to the rhythm that the drivers made  
People passing by would they would stop and say  
Oh my but that little country boy can play  
  
Chorus  
  
Well his mama told him some day you will be a man  
You will be the leader of a big old band  
Many people coming from miles around  
Just to hear you play your music till the sun go down  
Maybe some day your name will be in lights  
Saying Johnny B Goode tonight  
  
Chorus
