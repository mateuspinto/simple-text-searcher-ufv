There is too much confusion  
Much too much impact of obscene terror  
I wonder why Im still surfing on this wave of obsession  
Is there a reason to stay any longer  
Waiting for some cool messiah  
Give me a reason to stay here forever  
Waiting for something to come  
Is it my soul  
Is it that glimpse of light I never forget to expect  
Or is it you some kind of angel  
That keeps me in waiting forever  
Theres too much war on the outside  
Much too much impact of symbols and meanings  
I wonder why Im still fighting in this ocean of questions  
Is there a reason to stay any longer  
Waiting for something to come  
Give me a reason to stay on this island  
Waiting for something to come
