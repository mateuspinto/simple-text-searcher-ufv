Pharaoh he was a powerful man  
With the ancient world in the palm of his hands  
To all intents and purposes he  
Was Egypt with a capital E  
Whatever he did he was showered with praise  
If he cracked a joke than you chortled for days  
No one had rights or a vote but the king  
Infact you might say he was fairly right wing  
When pharohs around than you got down on the ground  
If you ever find yourself near ramases get down on your knees  
  
A pharoh story a pharoh story  
A pharoh story a pharoh story  
  
Down at the other end of the scale  
Joseph is still spending time in jail  
For even though hes in with the guards  
A lifetime in prison seems quite in the cards  
If my analysis of the position is right  
At the end of the tunnel is a glimmer of light  
Because of all sudden theres been visions and things  
Disturbing the peace of both peasants and kings  
Strange as it seems theres been a run of crazy dreams  
And a man who can interpret could go far  
Could become a star  
  
Could be famous could be a big success  
Could be famous could be a big success  
  
Strange as it seems theres been a run of crazy dreams  
And a man who can interpret could go far  
Could become a star  
  
Could be famous could be a big success  
Could be famous could be a big success  
  
During the Could be famousA Star  
  
Strange as it seems theres been a run of crazy dreams  
And a man who can interpret could go far  
Could become a star  
  
Could be famous could be a big success  
Could be famous could be a big success  
  
Could be a star
