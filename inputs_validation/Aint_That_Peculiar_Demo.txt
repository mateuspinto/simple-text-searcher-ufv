You do me wrong but still Im crazy about you  
Stay away too long and I cant live without you  
Every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more  
But each hurt makes my love stronger than before  
I know flowers go through rain how can love go through pain  
  
Aint that peculiar  
Peculiar as can be  
Aint that peculiar  
Thats what it is to me hey  
  
You tell me lies that should be obvious to me  
But there is so much lovin to see  
But the things you do and say are designed to make me blue  
Its a doggone shame my love for you makes all your lies seem true  
But if truth makes love last longer why do lies make my love stronger  
  
Aint that peculiar  
Peculiar as can be  
Aint that peculiar  
Thats what it is to me  
  
Hey hey  
Hey hey  
Hey hey  
Hey hey  
Hey hey  
  
Hey hey  
Hey hey  
Hey hey  
Hey hey  
Hey hey hey  
  
If hurt can last for years how can love last through tears  
  
Aint that peculiar  
Peculiar as can be  
Aint that peculiar  
Thats what it is to me  
  
Aint that peculiar  
Oh yeah thats what it is  
Aint that peculiar  
Oh cmon yeah yeah
