Too many billion people running around the planet  
What is the chance in heaven that youd find your way to me  
Tell me what is this sweet sensation  
Its a miracle that happened  
Though I search for an explanation  
Only one thing it could be  
  
That I was born for you  
It was written in the stars  
Yes I was born for you  
And the choice was never ours  
Its as if the powers of the universe  
Conspired to make you mine until the day I die  
I bless the day that I was born for you  
  
Too many foolish people try to come between us  
None of them seem to matter when I look into your eyes  
Now I know why I belong here  
In your arms I found the answer  
Somehow nothing would seem so wrong here  
If theyd only realize that  
I was born for you and that you were born for me  
And in this random world this was clearly meant to be  
What we have the world could never understand  
Or ever take away until the day I die  
  
I bless the day that I was born for you  
What we have the world could never understand or ever take away  
And as the years go by until the day I die  
I bless the day that I was born for you
