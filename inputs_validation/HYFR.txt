All my exes live in texas like Im george strait  
Or they go to georgia state where  
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in atlanta  
That she only see when she feels obligated  
Admitted it to me the first time we dated  
But she was no angel and we never waited  
I took her for sushi she wanted to fuck  
So we took it to go told them dont even plate it  
And we never talk too much after I blew up  
Just only hello or happy belated  
And I think I text her and told her I made it  
And thats when she text me and told me she prayed it  
And thats when I text her and told her I love it  
And right after texting told her Im faded  
She asked  
What have I learned since getting richer  
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures  
I learned hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture  
Even though its fucked up girl Im still fucking wit ya  
Damn is it the fall  
Time for me to revisit the past  
Its women to call  
Theres albums to drop theres liquor involved  
Theres stories to tell we been through it all  
Interviews are like confessions  
Get the fuck up out my dressing room confusing me with questions  
Like  
  
Bridge lil wayne  
Do you love this shit  
Are you high right now  
Do you ever get nervous  
Are you single  
I heard you fucked your girl is it true  
You getting money You think them niggas you with is wit you  
And I say  
  
And I say hell yeah  
Hell yeah hell yeah  
Fuckin right  
Fuckin right all right  
And we say hell yeah  
Hell yeah hell yeah  
Fuckin right  
Fuckin right all right  
  
Lil wayne  
So much for being optimistic  
They say love is in the air so I  
Hold my breath until my face turn purple  
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle  
My nuts hang like aint no curfew  
Bitch if you wave then I will surf you  
I flew jet she flew commercial  
But we still met later that night  
After my session she came over  
I was aggressive and she was sober  
I gave her pills  
She started confessing and started undressing  
And ask me to hold her  
And so I did but that was last month  
And now shes texting me asking for closure  
Damn  
She say this shit gon catch up to me  
I keep tissue paper  
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table  
She say she hate that she love me  
And she wish I was average  
Shit sometimes I wish the same  
And I wish she wasnt married  
Promises I hope I never break em  
Met a female dragon had a fire conversation but  
Interviews are like confessions  
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like  
  
Bridge  
Do you love this shit  
Are you high right now  
Do you ever get nervous  
Are you single  
I heard you fucked your girl is it true  
You getting money You think them niggas you with is wit you
