Big Boi  
In the zone like Keyser Soze always the Usual Suspect  
No check all I got in this game is my respect  
And Southern pride I be checking my fucking head  
Scared looking up in your face boi I see dead  
If you test like SAT then I guess that we may be enemies  
In the Ps freestyles be freebies  
I be that wrong nigga to fuck with wouldnt I  
Wouldnt I be the wrong one to try never eating chicken thighs  
Only the twenty piece mojo flow zone like Flo Jo  
I wanted to figure out just how low could yo hoe go  
The beat hit like Beat Street Krush Groove and Breaking  
Never baking rebuking Satan we had you waiting  
For the Second Coming funny how time flies when youre rhyming  
LaFaCe records I think they got that perfect timing  
To be doper than Sadaam believe the Nation of Islam  
Fuck the police and the dogs sniffing that dope up out your car  
I think they overstep they boundaries  
OJ not guilty thats how they found he  
  
Andre  
I felt the pressure like sun shining while raining at the same time  
I kept on rhyming not complaining  
Storm bringing cats and dogs my catalog be the size of golf balls  
Throw up your Daisy Dukes Im Hazzardous to all you Boss Hoggs  
And Roscoe P Col people who could boost my locomotive  
But enough of that everyone can rap unless they aint supposed ta  
I use my gift of gab to boast and brag in every rhyme I  
Compose wont yall get sick of that cause I know I do when I hear those  
Flows that aint hiphop you find that shit in the gift shop  
But to each his own my speech is goin keep that shit up outta my zone  
Long as you happy then Im happy  
Even if you just hate my fucking guts go head and dap me  
Cause Im goin dap you anyway and then go home and pray for yo ass later  
Cause we might need you in this war Im wailing on you traitors  
Like that
