When I was wandering in the desert  
And was searching for the truth  
I heard a choir of angels calling out my name  
I had the feeling that my life would never be the same again  
I turned my face towards the barren sun  
  
And I know of the pain that you feel the same as me  
And I dream of the rain as it falls upon the leaves  
And the cracks in our lives like the cracks upon the ground  
They are sealed and are now washed away  
  
Chorus  
You tell me we can start the rain  
You tell me that we all can change  
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears away  
You tell me we can start the rain  
You tell me that we all can change  
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears  
  
And I know of the pain that you feel the same as me  
And I dream of the rain as it falls upon the leaves  
And the cracks in the ground like the cracks are in our lives  
They are sealed and now far away  
  
Chorus  
  
And I know of the pain that you feel the same as me  
And I dream of the rain as it falls upon the leaves  
And the cracks in the ground like the cracks are in our lives  
They are sealed and now far away
