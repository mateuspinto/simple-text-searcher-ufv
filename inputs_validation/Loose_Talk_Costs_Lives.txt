Loose talk costs lives  
People like to play  
Were basically the same  
We never lie  
Loose talk costs lives  
  
Dont look at me as if you dont remember me at all  
There was laughter there was pain  
But I wont make the same mistakes I made  
You are too beautiful to me  
I hide my tears inside the rain  
  
Am I the soul you cast your spell upon  
I had control and now its gone  
Or are you someone who controls my heart and mind  
And I will never say a word  
And I will never say goodbye

I can see that someone hung a sign around your heart  
And it reads do not return  
And there is so much trouble I could cause  
Someone as beautiful as you  
You can feel my candle burn  
  
And I still recall some starry night  
We had it all we held on tight  
I promised I would come to you and catch you if you fall  
And they will never know about us  
For just one moment you were mine
