My God is more than enough  
He can supply all my needs  
He is my El Shaddai  
He always looks out for me  
  
Chorus  
Jehovah Jirah he is my God Repeat x2  
  
All of the earth is his  
And the fullness there of  
Hes everything that I need  
You can be sure of  
  
Chorus  
  
So why should I worry bout the highs and the lows  
The ups and the downs  
And by my faith I know  
My God is more than enough  
He can supply all my needs  
He is my El Shaddai  
He always looks out for me  
  
Chorus
