I love it loud lets push it higher  
Until the gain shows just red light  
I love it true and played with fire  
I enjoy a battle without fight  
  
What I hear I adhere  
Have no fear say sincere  
  
Are you metal  
Are you metal  
Are you  
Are you  
Are you metal  
Heavy metal  
Are you metal  
  
Call me insane call me hard wired  
But its the only noise I like  
Believe in loud and fast and higher  
I can tell the sound of wrong or right  
  
What I hear I adhere  
Have no fear say sincere  
  
Are you metal  
Are you metal  
Are you  
Are you  
Are you metal  
Heavy metal  
Are you metal
