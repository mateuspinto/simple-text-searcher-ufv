Ive searched the world over all of my life  
Just looking for something  
To make my love shine  
Like a candle that burns in the night  
But I came up with nothing  
Till I looked in your eyes  
Deeper and deeper inside  
  
And all of the treasures  
I found in your soul  
Was like finding a diamond  
When youre mining for coal  
  
Ive been a fool for glitter and gold  
And women that sparkle shiny and cold  
Like a statue carved out of ice  
They shimmer like tinsel  
On a blue Christmas night  
But they never were quite so bright  
  
As all of the treasures  
That loving you holds  
Its like finding a diamond  
When youre mining for coal  
  
I was a miner  
And you were a rock in the dust  
But you became flawless  
When you were you polished by love  
  
And when I found you  
I lost all control  
I found me a diamond  
Just mining for coal
