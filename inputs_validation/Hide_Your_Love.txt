Sometimes Im up sometimes Im down  
Sometimes Im fallin on the ground  
How do you hide how do you hide your love  
  
Now look here baby it sure looks sweet  
In the sleep time out in the street  
Why do you hide why do you hide your love  
Why do you hide baby why do you hide your love  
  
Oh been a sick man I want to cry  
Lord Im a drunk man but now Im dry  
Why do you hide why do you hide your love  
  
Now look here baby you sure look cheap  
I make money seven days a week  
Why do you hide why do you hide your love  
Why do you hide baby hide from the man that you love  
  
Come on come on come on  
Come on come on come on  
  
Oh babe Im reachin reachin high  
Oh yeah Im fallin out of the sky  
Why do you hide hide from the man that you love  
Why do you hide baby why do you hide your love  
  
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah  
Why do you hide why do you hide your love  
Why do you hide it baby hide from the man that you love  
That you love Well well well well
