I remember when we were sweethearts  
I was safe with you you were my protector  
Those days are over now I need someone  
Someone to keep me safe from you  
  
Love was all we had we were young and sure  
Whod expect their love would turn to war  
I dont know who to pity more  
How much pain can love endure  
  
I should leave you but I cant seem to  
You say Im sorry dear and I believe you  
Though the next time may be the worst yet  
How easily I forgive how quickly you forget  
  
The poison words the ugliness  
When low on hope and deep in debt  
The promises that bring regret  
For loving you is this all I get  
  
The poison words the ugliness  
The cold remains of married bliss  
To all our dreams a fatal kiss  
Oh what kind of love is this
