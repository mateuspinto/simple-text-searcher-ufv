I dont like to go down to flats  
Cause I cant park on a hill  
Instead getting a rolling start  
I have to pay the bill  
  
I guess I need that city life  
It sure has lots of style  
But pretty soon it wears me out  
And I have to think to smile  
  
Im thankful for my country home  
It gives me peace of mind  
Somewhere I can walk alone  
And leave myself behind  
  
Its only someone elses potatoes  
You pickin someone elses patch  
And if you go down there anyway  
It very seldom lasts  
  
I found that out once long ago  
And it sure got me confused  
I still dont know which way to go  
To lose those old spud blues  
  
Im thankful for my country home  
It gives me peace of mind  
Somewhere I can walk alone  
And leave myself behind
