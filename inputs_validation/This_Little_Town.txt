I was out there in the middle of the day  
Trying to make love to a shopping arcade  
In northern England  
Outside it was raining and I was feeling insecure  
Sooner or later you got to face the fact  
This world is shattered and its too full of cracks to fill in  
So we just give in on a Thursday afternoon  
In this little town where the traffic moves slow in the pouring rain  
I want to take you there where the four winds blow  
To be born again  
I was out there with the Beatles and the Cranks  
Trying to make some money and not to fall into the ranks of suburbia  
With Richard Toomey a visionary ghost  
Sooner or later we make the same mistakes  
Our pockets are all empty and our spirit starts to break  
Just uke a baby left in the car park on a foggy new years eve  
In this little town where winter begins  
In the summertime summertime  
I want to take you there  
Wash away our sins  
And be born again  
I was talking to some friends of mine trying to make some sense  
After drinking a case of wine from Yugoslavia but just before  
Breakfast we all started to agree wich was very unusual for us  
In this little town  
In this little town  
In this little town  
In the pouring rain  
I want to take you there  
To be born again  
In this little town  
In the summertime  
I want to take you there  
And be born again  
Born again
