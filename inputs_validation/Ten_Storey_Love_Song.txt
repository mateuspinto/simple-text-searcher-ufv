When your heart is black and broken  
And you need a helping hand  
When youre so much in love  
You dont know just how much you can stand  
  
When your questions go unanswered  
And the silence is killing you  
Take my hand baby Im your man  
I got love maybe enough for two  
  
Ten story love song  
I built this thing for you  
Who can take you higher  
Than twin deep mountain blue  
Oh well Ive built this thing for you  
And I love you true  
  
Theres no surefire set solutions  
No shortcut through the trees  
No breach in no wall that  
They put there to keep you from me  
  
As youre lying awake in this darkness  
This everlasting night  
Some day soon dont know where or when  
Youre gonna wake up and see the light  
  
Ten story love song  
I built this thing for you  
Who can take you higher  
Than twin deep mountain blue  
Oh well Ive built this thing for you  
And I love you true  
  
Ten story love song  
I built this thing for you  
Who can take you higher  
Than twin deep mountain blue  
Oh well Ive built this thing for you  
And I love you true
