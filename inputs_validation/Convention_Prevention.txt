Id like to reach out to you  
And learn just how do you do  
So we can still relate  
Id like to open my mind  
  
So you can come in and find  
How we communicate  
Theres a chemical reaction  
And its causing an attraction  
  
From you to me  
I am not one for convention  
But I have a good intention  
For you from me  
  
Rain is falling and a thunderbolt is crashing through my head  
And theres people and pain all around me  
Someone is calling and electric sparks are everywhere I tread  
My life it seems is a sequence of dreams  
And theres people and pain all around me  
  
Im going down in a black elevator  
Cause the big masturbators got his eye on me  
Im going down cause my brain is on fire  
And my soul is a liar cause I tried to be free  
Tried to be free tried to be free  
  
Freedom in your mind you can have when you dead  
Freedom in your life just depends on your head  
Freedom in your heart can alas never be  
Cause no one on this earth has been born to be free  
Born to be free born to me free  
  
All of my life I have tried to be free  
All of my life I have learned all I see  
All of my life I have searched for a clue  
All of my life I have tried to be true  
Tried to be true tried to be true
