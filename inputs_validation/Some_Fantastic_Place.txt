She gave to me her tenderness  
Her friendship and her love  
I see her face from time to time  
There in the sky above  
We grew up learning as we went  
What a voyage our life could be  
It took us through a wilderness  
Into the calmest sea  
Her smile could lift me from the pain  
I often found within  
She said some things I wont forget  
She made a few bells ring  
So simple her humility  
Her beauty found in grace  
Today she lives another life  
In some fantastic place  
She showed me how to raise a smile  
Out of a bed of gloom  
And in her garden sanctuary  
A life began to bloom  
She visualized a world ahead  
And planned how it would be  
She left behind the strongest love  
That lives eternally  
I have the hope that when its time  
For me to come her way  
That shell be there to show me around  
Whenever comes that day  
Her love was life and happiness  
And in her steps I trace  
The way to live a better life  
In some fantastic place some fantastic place
