Some people stay far away from the door  
If theres a chance of it opening up  
They hear a voice in the hall outside  
And hope that it just passes by  
  
Some people live with the fear of a touch  
And the anger of having been a fool  
They will not listen to anyone  
So nobody tells them a lie  
  
I know youre only protecting yourself  
I know youre thinking of somebody else  
Someone who hurt you  
But Im not above  
Making up for the love  
Youve been denying you could ever feel  
Im not above doing anything  
To restore your faith if I can  
Some people see through the eyes of the old  
Before they ever get a look at the young  
Im only willing to hear you cry  
Because I am an innocent man  
I am an innocent man  
Oh yes I am  
  
Some people say they will never believe  
Another promise they hear in the dark  
Because they only remember too well  
They heard somebody tell them before  
  
Some people sleep all alone every night  
Instead of taking a lover to bed  
Some people find that its easier to hate  
Than to wait anymore  
  
I know you dont want to hear what I say  
I know youre gonna keep turning away  
But Ive been there and if I can survive  
I can keep you alive  
Im not above going through it again  
  
And although this is a  
Fight I  
Can lose  
The accused is an  
Innocent  
Man  
I am an innocent man  
Oh yes I am  
I am an innocent man  
Oh yes I am  
An innocent man  
Oh
