You shall cross the barren desert  
But you shall not die of thirst  
You shall wander far in safety  
Though you do not know the way  
  
You shall speak your words in foreign lands  
And all will understand  
You shall see the face of God and live  
  
Be not afraid  
I go before you always  
Come follow Me  
And I shall give you rest  
  
If you pass through raging waters  
In the sea you shall not drown  
If you walk amidst the burning flames  
You shall not be harmed  
  
If you stand before the poware of hell  
And death is at your side  
Know that I am with you through it all  
  
Be not afraid  
I go before you always  
Come follow Me  
And I shall give you rest  
  
Blessed are your poor  
For the Kingdom shall be theirs  
Blest are you that weep and mourn  
For one day you shall laugh  
  
And if wicked men insult and hate you  
All because of Me  
Blessed blessed are you  
  
Be not afraid  
I go before you always  
Come follow Me  
And I shall give you rest
