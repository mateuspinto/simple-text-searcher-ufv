Watch the world go go  
Itll spin til it stops  
People gonna fly off  
When they turn it off  
  
Its the way we walk down the road  
Without care for the good news  
As the rain plays games with our feet  
Well I do hope its not too free  
  
Everythings closed and I need a smoke  
A serious habit treat it like a joke  
Listen now let me get this straight  
To be a man you need a fate  
  
You look strange when youre laughing  
Uneasy with your morons smile  
Slow motion seesaw ride  
My minds not on it but you gotta try
