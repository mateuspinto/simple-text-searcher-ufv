They cant take it from me if they try  
I lived through those early days  
So many times I had to change the pain to laughter  
Just to keep from getting crazed  
  
Dressed in black from head to toe  
Two guitars across our backs  
We would walk the city roads  
Seeking someone who would listen to the music  
That we were writing down at home  
  
But they cant take it from me if they try  
I lived through those early days  
So many times I had to change the pain to laughter  
Just to keep from getting crazy  
  
Hair slicked back with Vaseline  
Like the pictures on the wall  
Of the local record shop  
Hearing noises we were destined to remember  
We willed the thrill to never stop  
  
May sweet memories of friends from the past  
Always come to you when you look for them  
And your inspiration long may it last  
May it comes to you time and time again  
  
Now everybody seems to have their own opinion  
Who did this and who did that  
But as for me I dont see how they can remember  
When they werent where it was at  
  
And they cant take it from me if they try  
I lived through those early days  
So many times I had to change the pain to laughter  
Just to keep from getting crazy  
  
I lived through those early days  
I lived through those early days
