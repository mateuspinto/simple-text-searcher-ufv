There came a girl from France  
Who didnt know how to dance  
The only thing that she could do  
Was knees up Mother Brown  
  
Chorus  
Oh Knees up Mother Brown  
Knees up Mother Brown  
Knees up knees up never let the breeze  
Up  
Knees up Mother Brown  
  
Oh hopping on one foot  
Hopping on one foot  
Hopping hopping never stopping  
Hopping on one foot  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh prancing up and down  
Prancing up and down  
Prancing prancing never dancing  
Prancing up and down  
  
And whirling round and round  
Whirling round and round  
Whirling whirling never twirling  
Whirling round and round  
  
Repeat chorus
