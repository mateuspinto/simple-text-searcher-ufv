I heard it from my friends  
About the things you said  
I heard it from my friends  
About the things you said  
But they know me better than that  
They know me better than that  
They know my weaknesses  
I never tried to hide them  
They know my weaknesses  
I never denied them  
I heard it from my friends  
About the things you said  
I heard it from my friends  
About the things you said  
How can a view become so twisted  
How can a view become so twisted  
They know my weaknesses  
I never tried to hide them  
They know my weaknesses  
You tried them  
I get so carried away  
You brought me down to earth  
I thought we had something precious  
Now I know what its worth  
I heard it from my friends  
About the things you said  
I heard it from my friends  
About the things you said  
Ive never felt so disappointed  
Never felt so disappointed  
They know my weaknesses  
I never tried to hide them  
They know my weaknesses  
Thought that you liked them  
They know me better than that
