I set all my regrets on fire  
Cause I know Ill never take the time  
To unpack my missteps and call all of our friends  
I figure they would take your side  
  
I make the bed just not that well  
Your name comes up a lot  
When I talk to my mom  
Oh I think she can tell  
  
I was out on the town  
So I came to your window last night  
I tried not to throw stones  
But I wanted to come inside  
Now Im causing a scene but you need a reason to smile  
Oh no what have I done  
Theres no one to keep me warm  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
  
So maybe I should put up a fight  
Ill call them back and borrow a box knife  
So I can learn to live with all the stupid shit Ive been doing since ninety
nine  
  
And I know I could be more clever  
And I know I could be more strong  
But Im waiting for the day you come back and say  
Hey maybe I should change my mind  
  
I drink a lot  
Im not sure if thats new  
But these days when I wake up from a night I forgot  
I just wish that it never came true  
  
I was out on the town  
So I came to your window last night  
I tried not to throw stones  
But I wanted to come inside  
Now Im causing a scene but you need a reason to smile  
Oh no what have I done  
Theres no one to keep me warm  
  
And I know I could be more clever  
And I know I could be more strong  
And I know I could be more clever  
And I know I could be more clever  
  
I knew there would come a day when all was said and done And I know I could
be more clever  
Everything I was is everything but gone And I know I could be more strong  
All my big mistakes are bouncing off your wall And I know I could be more
clever  
The bottles never break the sorrow never comes And I know I could be more
clever  
So come on let me in I will be the sun And I know I could be more clever  
I will wake you up I am who And I know I could be more strong  
Just open up your heart open up your heart open up your heart And I know I
could be more clever  
  
I was out on the town  
So I came to your window last night  
I tried not to throw stones  
But I wanted to come inside  
Now Im causing a scene but you need a reason to smile  
Oh no what have I done  
Theres no one to keep me warm  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh
