Big Boi  
Peep what I say  
Everyday the sun sets just like clockwork  
Put the glock to work  
And putting the body to standstills  
Man it kills me  
Taking that life is like taking a shit  
Hit or miss niggas are playing God  
Trying to rob and steal  
Thats why ya gotta guard ya grill  
Like a barbecue cause them harming you  
Are just like honeybees swarming you  
Vocally arming you was my responsibility  
Its killing me thinking that all these niggas  
See they fly shit thinking they Steven Segal an  
Balling falling to the wayside when ya try to call  
Ive fallen when we was little nappy headed niggas in the projects  
But now they carjacks wait on income tax and unsafe sex  
They get the tecs to flex like solo for the lolo  
Smoke same thing no no not this time  
Niggas around my way can rhyme  
So fuck that country shit we done a bunch of shit  
And yes ya heard of this out of this world like ET  
Coming across ya TV  
Extraterrestrial straight from ATL  
  
Know what Im saying  
Like that  
Yeah  
  
Chorus x3  
Out of this world  
Are you alien  
  
Out of this world  
  
Andre  
Right now Im smiling  
Taking advantage of this moment  
Cause there might not be another soon  
Holding on to memories like roller coaster handle bars  
Tightly cause Im slightly off my rockerBut to you  
I may appear to be your average joe  
But little do you know  
That even joe got problems that he gots to joust with  
Floating in this game of life  
Despite how out of place you may feel  
In this race oh you just cant quit  
Aint that a bitch that being heat  
Im on the beat like cops  
Only cultivate the stable dirt when I skeet my drops  
No concentrating knocking other niggas out the box  
Why Cause in a sense  
See we all be kind of fly  
Just cant be scared to spread your wings  
Head to better things  
Maybe the mockingbird and nightingale  
They want to singkeeping this thing alive  
To the tables what we bring  
We like hailstorms and blizzards in the middle of the spring  
Extraterrestrial  
  
Out of this world  
Things like that  
Yo  
  
Chorus
