Gonna go out and play some golf ya ya  
Gonna go out and play some golf  
My golf bags full of the latest stuff  
Im gonna go out and play some golf  
My putter alone was a thousand bucks  
Im gonna go out and suck at golf  
Think I better take a muligan ya ya  
Think I better take a mulligan  
I put my ball in the pond again  
I think I better take a mulligan  
I tee it up and take a swing and then splash  
Can I get another mulligan  
Get up get up get up get up get up  
A get down get down  
Hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry  
Slow down Slow down  
Dont hit the tree dont hit the tree  
Please hit the tree  
There must be something wrong with my clubs  
All my friends hit it farther than me  
Ya all my friends hit it farther than me  
I just hope I clear the ladies tee  
Everyobody hits it farther than me  
Just 8 more strokes then I reach a par 3  
That kid just hit it farther than me  
Get up get up get up get up get up  
A get down get down  
Hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry  
Slow down ball slow down down down  
Dont hit the tree dont hit the tree  
Please hit the tree  
I took a day off for this  
Never be as good as Tiger Woods no no  
Never be as good as Tiger Woods  
My balls always goin off into the woods  
Never be as good as Tiger Woods  
Im hookin my arms and Im pullin my woods What  
Never be as good as Tiger Woods  
Get up get up get up get up get up  
A get down get down  
Hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry  
Slow down Slow down  
Dont hit the tree dont hit the tree  
Hit the tree hit the tree  
I really hate this stupid game
