Beneath the cross of Jesus  
I fain would take my stand  
The shadow of a mighty rock  
Within a weary land  
A home within the wilderness  
A rest upon the way  
From the burning of the noontide heat  
And the burden of the day  
  
Upon that cross of Jesus  
Mine eye at times can see  
The very dying form of One  
Who suffered there for me  
And from my stricken  
Heart with tears  
Two wonders I confess  
The wonders of redeeming love  
And my unworthiness  
  
I take O cross thy shadow  
For my abiding place  
I ask no other sunshine than  
The sunshine of His face  
Content to let the world go by  
To know no gain nor loss  
My sinful self my only shame  
My glory all the cross
