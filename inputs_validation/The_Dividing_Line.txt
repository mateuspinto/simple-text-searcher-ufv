There has always been a dividing line  
But you choose you choose yes you choose not to see it  
And then you wonder why you fall  
It cuts through the heart of every city  
If you climb to the top of the highest building  
You can see where it falls cause the streetlights stop  
The colors start to change  
You hear a voice inside you  
Not the words that you wanted to hear  
Not the things that you wanted to see hey hey hey hey  
  
In the comfort and safety of your own home  
Remember those outside in the cold  
And the wind and the rain  
And take in your hands a little ray of light  
And turn it into a beam that pierces the darkness of the night  
  
There has always been a dividing line  
But you choose you choose yes you choose not to see it  
Sometimes we believe if we close our eyes  
The rain might wash it away  
Thats why we stumble and we fall  
Not the words that you wanted to hear  
Not the things that you wanted to see hey hey hey hey  
  
When everything that you hold dear to you  
Has finally faded away from your life  
The last cold ray of sunshine slowly disappears  
Round the corner of the building  
And leaves you alone  
When darkness covers the city and the streets are silent too  
What will you turn to
