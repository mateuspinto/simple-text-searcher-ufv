The breakers war on an unseen shore  
In the teeth of a hurricane  
Oh we struggle in vain  
A hellish night a ghostly light  
Appears through the driving rain  
Salvation in the human chain  
  
All I know that sometimes you have to be wary of a miracle too good to be
true  
All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary of everything in life you
thought you knew  
All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary because sometimes the target
is you  
  
Driven to the ground  
With that awful sound  
Drowned by the cheer from the shore  
Oh we wonder what for  
  
The people swarm  
through the darkening storm  
Gather everything they can score  
Turn their backs when theres no more  
  
All I know that sometimes you have to be wary of a miracle too good to be
true  
All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary of everything in life you
thought you knew  
All I know that sometimes you have to be wary of a miracle too good to be
true  
All I know that sometimes the truth is contrary because sometimes the target
is you  
  
The brink of war on an unseen shore  
In the teeth of an icy grave  
In the teeth of an icy grave  
  
Whoah the human chain leaves a bloody stain  
Washed away in the pounding waves  
Washed away in the pounding waves  
  
All I know is sometimes you have to be wary of a miracle too good to be true  
All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary of all the things in life
you thought you knew  
All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary because sometimes the target
is you  
  
All I know is that memory can be too much to carry  
striking out like a bull from a balloon  
All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary of everything in life you
thought you knew
