Breathing is a sin they say  
Loneliness is the price to pay  
Sad for you I go once more  
Ill dry my eyes on a distant shore  
  
No way of freezing your rising tide  
No way of keeping you by my side  
Like a bird Ill fly high  
Guarding over this love of mine  
  
A room of trust  
A room of fears  
A room of laughter with a few sweet tears  
There we lay that sunny dawn  
Calm and helpless as it lingers on  
  
No way of keeping you by my side  
No way of keeping our love alive  
Like a bird Ill fly high  
Guarding over this love of mine  
  
Many times we hurry by  
Lose our problems in a knowing smile  
Many days were swept along  
Left unnoticed as our love grew strong  
  
Believing each of us would always know  
Believing one of us would never go  
Like a bird Ill fly high  
Watching over this love of mine
