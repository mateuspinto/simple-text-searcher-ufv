Whoa whoa  
Cant swim so I took a boat to an island so remote  
Only Johnny Depp has ever been to it before  
Stayed there till the air was clear  
I was bored and out of tears then I saw you washed up on the shore  
I offered you my coat thank godess love can float  
Crazy how that shipwreck met my ship was comin in  
We talked till the sun went down  
Love on the Pugit Sound  
My treasure map was on your skin  
  
Beauty in the water angel on the beach  
Oceans daughter I thought love was out of reach  
Till I got her had I known it could come true  
I would have wished in ninety two for a mermaid just like you  
Whoa just like you whoa  
  
Shocks screams with envy they wonder what you see in me  
Funny thoughts sometimes cant help but wonder that as well  
Now life is a holiday making up for the years I paid  
The way to this heavenly bay it went through hell  
  
Beauty in the water angel on the beach  
Oceans daughter I thought love was out of reach  
Till I got her had I known it could come true  
I would have wished in ninety two for a mermaid just like you  
Whoa just like you whoa  
  
Rescued you by the Banu tree all the girl fish in the sea  
Puttin a candle to you they dont have a handle on you they dont have a
scandal on you  
Holler back will save you  
Saving me was BIG all the boy fish in the sea  
They all wish that they could be me  
  
Cant swim so I took a boat to an island so remote  
Only Johnny Depp has ever been to it before  
  
Beauty in the water angel on the beach  
Oceans daughter I thought love was out of reach  
Till I got her had I known it could come true  
I would have wished in ninety two for a mermaid just like you  
Whoa just like you whoa  
  
Whoa just like you whoaRescued you by the Banu tree all the girl fish in
the sea  
Just like you whoa
