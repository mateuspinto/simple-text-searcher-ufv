Your love still brings me to my knees  
From day to day you feel my needs  
This flame that burns  
Within my heart will never die  
Oh I bless the day you come along  
You turned my life into a song  
There is no greater love  
And there will never be  
Cause youre the only one  
Your love still brings me to my knees  
Brings me to my knees  
Your love has given me  
Your love still brings me to my knees  
Your love has given me  
I find each day I love you more  
Always the one Im waiting for  
No matter where I go  
No matter what I do  
Cause youre the only one  
Your love still brings me to my knees  
Still brings me to my knees  
Your love has given me  
You bring me to my knees  
Your love has given me  
Now I never knew  
What life was all about yeah  
Then you came along  
And gave me a reason to understand what its about oh darling  
  
Your love still brings me to my knees  
From day to day you feel my needs  
There is no greater love  
And there will never be  
Cause youre the only one  
Your love still brings me to my knees  
It brings me to my knees  
Your love has given me  
Still brings me to my knees  
Your love still brings me to my knees  
Youve given me everything  
Given me everything darling
