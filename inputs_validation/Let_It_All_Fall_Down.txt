Sing a song for  
The wrong and the wicked  
And the strong and the sick  
As thick as thieves  
For the faceless fear  
That was never so near  
Too clear to misbelieve  
Well the sea is jumping salty  
And the porpoise has the blues  
My recollections faulty  
And I cannot find my shoes  
And my wiring is misfiring  
Due to cigarettes and booze  
Im behind in my dues  
I just now got the news  
He seems to tell us lies  
And still we will believe him  
Then together he will lead us  
Into darkness my friends  
  
Let it fall down let it fall down let it all fall down  
Let it fall down let it fall down let it all fall down  
  
The man says stand to one side son  
We got to keep this big ball rolling  
Its just a question of controlling  
For whom the bell is tolling  
  
Let it fall down let it fall down let it all fall down  
Let it fall down let it fall down let it all fall down  
  
Therell be suffering and starvation  
In the streets young man  
Just where have you been old man  
Just look out of your window man  
  
Let it fall down let it fall down let it all fall down  
Let it fall down let it fall down let it all fall down  
  
Well it aint nobodys fault  
But our own  
Still at least we might could  
Show the good sense  
To know when weve been wrong  
And its already taken too long  
So we bring it to a stop  
Then we take it from the top  
We let it settle on down softly  
Like your gently falling snow  
Or let it tumble down and topple  
Like the temple long ago  
  
Let it fall down let it fall down let it all fall down  
Let it fall down let it fall down let it all fall down
