I cant imagine how to tell my story and ah  
Not fuss or fight butI really wanna talk to you  
You see Im not in agreement with the law this morning  
So dont be my judge and jury do I get through to you  
But every time I try to build up my case  
You tear it down with your pretty face  
You stand your ground  
And show the lightning in your eyes  
And then I feel it  
Cool magic wins me over  
Oh so silent always strong and I tell ya  
Cool magic wins me over  
So I surrender to your charm  
Im too defensive to give up without a fight  
But you know my motions what am I gonna do  
Although it seems its neverending  
And Im desperate  
To live right here  
Under your spell tonight  
And every time I try to build up my case  
You tear it down with your pretty face  
You stand your ground and  
Show the lightning in your eyes  
And then I feel it  
Cool magic wins me over  
Oh so silent always strong and I tell ya  
Cool magic wins me over  
So I surrender to your charm  
Just when I feel Im bout to lose my mind  
Then here it comes again one more time  
I really need it  
Cool magic wins me over  
Oh so silent always strong and I tell ya  
Cool magic wins me over  
So I surrender to your charm  
Cool magic  
Cool magic  
Cool magic  
Cool magic  
Cool magic
