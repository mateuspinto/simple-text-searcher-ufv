Jack and Diane painted a picture of my life and my dreams  
Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me  
Well I heard it today and I couldnt help but sing along  
Cause every time I hear that song  
  
I go back to a twotoned short bed Chevy  
Drivin my first love out to the levy  
Livin life with no sense of time  
And I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line  
A blanket a girl some raspberry wine  
Wishin time would stop right in its tracks  
Every time I hear that song I go back I go back  
  
I used to rock all night long to Keep On Rockin Me Baby  
At frat parties college bars just tryin to impress the ladies  
I heard it today and I couldnt help but sing along  
Cause every time I hear that song  
  
I go back to the smell of an old gym floor  
And the taste of salt on the Carolina shore  
After graduation and drinkin goodbye to friends  
And I go back to watchin summer fade to fall  
Growin up too fast and I do recall  
Wishin time would stop right in its tracks  
Every time I hear that song I go back I go back  
  
We all have a song that somehow stamped our lives  
Takes us to another place and time  
  
So I go back to a pew preacher and a choir  
Singin bout God brimstone and fire  
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church  
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend  
And the sixteen summers I shared with him  
Now Only The Good Die Young stops me in my tracks  
Every time I hear that song I go back I go back  
  
To the feel of a fifty yard line  
A blanket a girl some raspberry wine  
I go back I go back  
To watchin summer fade to fall  
Growin up too fast and I do recall  
I go back I go back  
To the loss of a real good friend  
And the sixteen summers I shared with him  
I go back I go back I go back
