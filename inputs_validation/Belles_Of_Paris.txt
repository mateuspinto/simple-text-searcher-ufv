Bells are ringing soul of France  
Bells are singing of romance  
seeest tres jolie en Paris in the spring  
Watching all the lovers walk along the Seine  
Pitch a penny in her like a wishing well  
Feed the pigeons in the park near TourEifelle  
Bells are ringing soul of France  
Bells are singing of romance  
Theres a chapel Sacre Coure in quaint Montmarte  
In the open air the painters show their art  
In the restaurant sip a beaujolies  
What a perfect way to spend a lovely day  
Bells are ringing soul of France  
Bells are singing of romance  
Sunday morning hear the bells of Notre Dame  
Watching belles jeunes filles and the handsome gendarmes  
Near the Arc De Triomphe on the ChampsElysees  
Coffee and croissants in a sidewalk cafe  
Some people go to see the races at Deauville  
Or weekend by the racing tides of Mont San Michelle  
Some take the tour of Chartres on an autobus  
While the writers and the artists never leave Mont Parnasse
