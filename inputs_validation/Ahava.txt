Day after day night after night  
Nothing in love is black or white  
Deep down inside trying to touch  
Wanting to say I love you so much  
  
Wish for a star sparkling light  
Dont run away just hold me tight  
Deep down inside trying to touch  
Wanting to say I love you so much  
  
Ahava tomorrow we will find  
Ahava a way into the light  
Ahava you and I  
Ahava  
  
Yo vo cha yom le cha ve li  
Ya vo cha yom koo lo she li  
Bli mil ha ma bli ema  
Rak ahava le ne sha ma  
  
Ahava tomorrow we will find  
Ahava destiny is calling  
Ahava you and I  
Ahava  
  
Dont run and hide dont hold me tight  
Im going there to see the light  
I wish to know the magic star  
I wish to know the   
  
Ahava tomorrow we will find  
Ahava a way into the light  
Ahava you and I  
Ahava
