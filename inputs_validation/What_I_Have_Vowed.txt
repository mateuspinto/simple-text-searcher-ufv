Lord I am not my own no longer my own  
Living now for You and everything I think  
All I say and do is for You my Lord  
  
Now taking up the cross walking on Your paths  
Holding out Your truth running in this race  
Bowing every day all for You my Lord  
  
And what I have vowed I will make good  
Every promise made will be fulfilled  
Till the day I die every day I live  
Is for You is for You is for You  
Is for You is for You is for You  
  
Earth has nothing I desire that lives outside of You  
Im consumed with You Treasures have no hold  
Nothing else will do only You my Lord
