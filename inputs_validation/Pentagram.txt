Your pentagram is down below our floor  
Your naked body shimmers in the night  
Dancing and chanting in a sacrificial rite  
Your feet are dry with the ashes from dead babies  
Who have passed the test just like all the rest  
But never really understood the reasons why  
They took it in the first place  
Ah in the first place  
Your feisty eyes wont make me fall apart  
Your turquoise and silver wont weaken this old heart  
Yeah dancing and chanting in a sacrificial rite  
I fell to the ground on a windy windy night  
Well I have passed the test just like all the rest  
But never really understood the reasons why  
I took it in the first place  
Ah in the first place  
Well I have passed the test just like all the rest  
But never really understood the reasons why  
I took it in the first place  
Ah in the first place
