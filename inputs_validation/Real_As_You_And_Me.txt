There could be a freak accident  
There could be a fatal disease  
I know we hate to think about it  
But this as real as you and me  
This as real as you and me  
  
We could all fall down  
Before our Saviour could return  
I know we hate to think about it  
But its as real as you and me  
  
If I should go  
Hold my hand  
If I should leave  
Darling cover me please  
  
The earth could quake to ruin  
We could drift off in our sleep  
I know we hate to think about it  
But this as real as you and me  
This as real as you and me  
  
The ocean crushed the shore  
And take us down forevermore  
I know we hate to think about it  
But this as real as you and me  
  
If I should go  
Hold my hand  
If I should leave  
Darling cover me please  
  
I know we hate to think about it  
But its as real as you and me  
Its as real as you and me
