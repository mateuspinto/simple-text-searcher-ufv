Oh you can kiss her on a Monday  
A Monday a Monday very very good  
Or you can kiss her on a Tuesday  
A Tuesday a Tuesday she rather hopes you would  
  
Or you can kiss her on a Wednesday a Thursday  
A Friday a Saturday is best  
But never never on a Sunday a Sunday a Sunday  
Cause thats her day of rest  
  
Come any day and you be her guest  
Any day you say but her day of rest  
Just name the day that you like the best  
Only stay away on her day of rest  
  
Oh you can kiss her on a cool day a hot day a wet day  
Which ever one you choose  
Or try to kiss her on a gray day a May day a pay day  
Shell never will refuse  
  
And if you make it on a bleak day a freak day a week day  
While you can be her guest  
But never never on a Sunday a Sunday  
A one day she needs a little rest  
  
Just name the day that you like the best  
Only stay away on her day of rest  
  
Oh you can kiss her on a cool day a hot day a wet day  
Which ever one you choose  
Or try to kiss her on a gray day a May day a pay day  
Shell never will refuse  
  
And if you make it on a bleak day a freak day a week day  
While you can be her guest  
But never never on a Sunday a Sunday  
The one day shes got to get her rest
