No division in the ranks  
The lines are long and proud  
No question on their lips  
But there will always be doubt  
  
Like a Chinese painting  
All red with its message  
A flag high in the sky  
Twists and turns its language  
  
Chorus   
Underneath the colors red blue white  
Catch a glimpse of others  
From the corner of your eye  
  
With the rise and fall  
Of the conductors blind hand  
The Russian Roulette  
I am an angry young man  
  
Chorus   
  
Repeat 1st verse  
  
Chorus 4X
