Its not difficult  
For me to say I love you  
It wouldnt be difficult  
If you would say the same  
And believe me when I tell you  
That I know you very well  
I know you like I know my name  
I think that I have met you  
Somewhere in my dreams  
I may never have met you at all  
And I know you must be thinking  
What a silly girl  
I know your every thought and scheme  
I wake up to the feeling each morning  
I go to bed to it at night  
I know you I live you  
CHORUS  
Like I feel a song in the morning  
Like I see the moon at night  
I know you as if Ive known you all my life  
I know you I live you  
One day youll realize  
That were not strangers  
If you open up your eyes  
Youll know me too  
And see that we were  
Meant to be together my dear  
And all the rest is up to you  
BRIDGE  
Like I feel a song in the morning  
Like I see the moon at night  
I know you as if Ive known you all my life  
I know you I know you  
Like I feel a song in the morning  
Like I see the moon at night  
I think I know you more than you know yourself  
I know you I live you  
Know you live you  
Know you live you  
Know you  
And without me youd stumble  
And without you Id fall  
Without each other we would not be at all
