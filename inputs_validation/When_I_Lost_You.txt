musical intro  
I lost the sunshine and roses I lost the heavens of blue  
I lost the beautiful rainbow I lost the morning dew  
I lost the angel who gave me summer the whole winter too  
I lost the gladness that turned into sadness  
When I lost you  
musical interlude  
And I lost the angel who gave me summer the whole winter too  
I lost the gladness that turned into sadness  
When I lost you
