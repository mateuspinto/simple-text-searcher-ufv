Winters coming  
Itll soon will be here  
If we knew what it meant  
We would take care  
  
Snow is falling  
Where the snow falls  
If we knew what it meant  
We would take care  
  
We would dance  
Light up the sky  
With your message fly  
With your message  
Bells will ring out for our love  
  
We can do it  
Gonna do it tonight  
Sing till we fly together  
Dance till were high together  
Dance till were high together  
  
Write a letter to a new love  
Drop a line to a true love  
Winters coming  
Itll soon be here  
If we knew what it meant  
We would take care  
  
Shake our heads  
We would be there  
  
We would dance  
Light up the sky  
With your message fly  
With your message  
Bells will ring out for our love  
  
We can do it  
Gonna do it tonight  
Sing till we fly together  
Dance till were high together  
Gonna do it right now  
  
Light up the sky  
With your message fly  
With your message  
Bells will ring out for our love  
  
We can do it  
Gonna do it tonight  
Sing till we fly together  
Dance till were high together  
Dance till were high together  
  
Light up the sky  
Sing till we fly together  
Dance till were high together  
Gonna do it right now
