It seems no matter how far I may roam  
Like some ol tumbleweed my thoughts go tumblin back home  
In memory I recall those simpler times  
And a way of life I never left behind  
  
Down at the old corral  
Just sittin  
Watchin the sun go down  
Oh How Im wishin that I  
Could be there now  
Down at the old corral  
  
I remember everything I ever heard  
Like how to judge a mans true worth by how he keeps his word  
That saddle wisdom never seemed to end  
Everything I need to know I learned back then  
  
Down at the old corral  
Just sittin  
Watchin the sun go down  
Oh How Im wishin that  
I could be there now  
Down at the old corral  
  
Down at the old corral  
Just sittin  
Watchin the sun go down  
Oh how Im wishin that  
I could be there now  
Down at the old corral  
Down at the old corral  
Down at the old corral
