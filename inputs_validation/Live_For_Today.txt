We had this bright idea one late summer night  
Candycoated popcorn strung like a beaded curtain hung over your door  
I guess the heat got to it dripped and melted all over the floor  
Chocolatecovered cherries in tin foil boats float around the floorboard  
I had to laugh not to cry  
Now all your possessions all of your things all of your hopes schemes
desires and most of all your dreams  
All gone away Gone away  
All gone away Gone away  
All gone away  
live for today you said live for today  
I had to laugh not to cry  
I had to laugh not to cry not to cry
