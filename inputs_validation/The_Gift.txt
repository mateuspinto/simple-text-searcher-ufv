He was born in Bethlehem they say  
There was a star to light the path to where He lay  
Rich or poor they came from far and near  
Cause theyd all heard the reason He was here  
  
He was the Son God sent to one and all  
Put on this earth to hang there on that cross  
Born to die so we could live  
He had the birthday we got the gift  
  
They wrapped him up with gentle hands  
God hoped the world would understand  
Eternal life we shall receive  
And all that He asks in return is that we just believe  
  
He was the Son God sent to one and all  
Put on this earth to hang there on that cross  
Born to die so we could live  
He had the birthday we got the gift  
Theres no way in this world we could repay  
The miracle He gave us on that day  
  
He was the Son God sent to one and all  
put on this earth to hang there on that cross  
born to die so we could live  
He had the birthday we got the gift  
  
On our Saviors birthday we got the gift
