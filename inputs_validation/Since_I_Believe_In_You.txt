You were there for me  
Through the deepest valleys I was in  
You have rescued me  
Time and time again  
  
You carried me  
You are my god  
Following your way is all I trust  
My pure delight  
You alone I give all my heart  
  
Reff  
Ive found all that Ive been missing  
In my god who died to cover my sins  
Now I found my path for living  
Since I believe in you  
  
Bridge  
Consume me and breathe your love in me  
Surround me youre all that I need  
Now I found my path for living
