Once we did run  
How we chased a million stars  
and touched as only one can  
Once we did play  
How the past delivered you  
Amidst our youth wed dream away away  
As if I knew the words Im sure youll hear  
Of how we met as you recall so well  
Once we did love  
Long ago how did I forget  
Holding you so closely  
Look how I move  
Chance would have me glance at you  
To know how you move me me  
All barriers fall around us as we hear  
Of memories known and matters long ago so clear  
interlude  
Once we did run  
How we chased a million stars  
And touched as only one can
