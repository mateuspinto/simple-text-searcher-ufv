Like the stars that shine above  
In a warn and wind tossed love  
Just like tears that fall forever  
Like the raven and the dove  
Looking for a perfect love  
After rainy stormy weather  
I am yours and you are mine  
Till the stars fall from my eyes  
There will always be a you  
A ship sailing without end  
A lost tired worm down friend  
And old broken run down shoe  
I keep running back for more  
At least you thought I would be sure  
But I gave up I broke its true  
Still there will always be a you  
Dont ask me how  
I tried so long  
And in my heart I know  
I will never go away  
If you wanted me to stay  
Well in a million years  
I wouldnt go  
Cause I love you so  
Yes I do  
I love you so  
I could never leave you  
I love you  
Dont go away  
Dont go away  
There will always be a you  
A ship sailing without end  
A lost tired worm down friend  
And old broken run down shore  
I keep running back for more  
At least you thought I would be sure  
But I give up I broke its true  
Still there will always be a you  
I am yours and you are mine  
Till the stars fall from my eyes  
There will always be a you  
I will never go away  
If you wanted me to stay  
Well in a million years  
I wouldnt go  
Cause I love you so  
Yes I do  
I love you so  
I could never leave you  
I love you  
I love you  
Dont go away  
Cant go away  
There will always be a you  
At night I cry  
Cant find a reason  
Im left alone  
Cant seem to understand  
At night I cry  
Cant find a reason  
Im left alone  
Cant seem to understand  
There will always be a you  
There will always be a you  
Fade
