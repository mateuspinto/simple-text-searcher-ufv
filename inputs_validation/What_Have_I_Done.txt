What have I done  
Sweet Jesus what have I done  
Become a thief in the night  
Become a dog on the run  
Have I fallen so far  
And is the hour so late  
That nothing remains but the cry of my hate  
The cries in the dark that nobody hears  
Here where I stand at the turning of the years  
If there is another way to go  
I missed it twenty long years ago  
My life was a war that could never be won  
They gave me a number and murdered Valjean  
When they chained me and let me for dead  
Just for stealing a mouth full of bread  
Yet why did I allow that man  
To touch my sould and teach me love  
He treated me like any other  
He gave me his trust  
He called me Brother  
My life he claims for God above  
Can such things be  
For I had come to hate the world  
This world that always hated me  
Take an eye for an eye  
Turn your heart into stone  
This is all I have lived for  
This is all I have known  
One word from him and Id be back  
Beneath the lash upon the rack  
Instead he offers me my freedom  
I feel my shame inside me like a knife  
He told me that I had a soul  
How does he know  
What spirit comes to move my life  
Is there another way to go  
I am reaching but I fall  
And the night is closing in  
And I stare into the void  
To the whirpool of my sin  
Ill escape now from the world  
From the world of Jean Valjean  
Jean Valjean is nothing now  
Another story must begin
