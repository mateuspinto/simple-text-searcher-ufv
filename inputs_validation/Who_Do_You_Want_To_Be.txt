Who do you want to be today  
Who do you want to be  
Who do you want to be today  
Do you want to be just like someone on TV  
Oh boredom is so terrible its like a dread disease  
Nothing could be worse than when theres nothing on TV  
Id rather be a cowboy than to stare blank at the walls  
Ive been reborn so many times I cant remember them all  
Who do you want to be today  
Who do you want to be  
Who do you want to be today  
Do you want to be just like someone on TV  
Just like someone on TV  
I think Ill be a teddy boy I think Ill be a hunk  
I think Ill be a tough guy and I think Ill be a punk  
I might just be a fashion star all dressed in frilly rags  
Or perhaps Ill cross the other side and walk around in drag  
Who do you want to be today  
Who do you want to be  
Who do you want to be today  
Do you want to be just like someone on TV  
Just like somebody on TV  
Do you like to be just like a rock  
In the middle of the sea  
Do you want to suffer by yourself  
In a pool of blissful misery  
Do you want to feel like a saint in artists clothes  
With a rosary in your hand  
Do you wanna be crazy like Van Gogh  
Like a stranger in a strange strange land  
Would you rather push the buttons  
And be feared by all humanity  
Or perhaps youd like to be a bum  
Do you wanna be stupid just like me  
Who do you want to be today  
Who do you want to be  
Who do you want to be today  
Do you want to be just like someone on TV  
Just like somebody on TV  
Who do you want to be today  
Who do you want to be today  
Who do you want to be today  
Who do you want to be today  
Who do you want to be today  
Who do you want to be  
Who do you want to be today  
Who do you want to be
