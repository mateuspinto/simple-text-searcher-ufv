It may seem like our fire  
Has been a little burnt out were tired  
We only need to stay close  
In time sparks will fly  
And we fly too and we and we  
And we fly too  
  
It may seem like our fire  
Has been a little burnt out were tired  
We only need to stay close  
In time sparks will fly  
And we fly too and we and we  
And we fly too  
  
Baby you deserve the whole enchilada  
Gucci and Prada  
Toast to the days when I didnt have a dollar  
You stuck around even when the world frowned on me  
Kicked me when I was down and so they clowned on me  
Down for me my homie  
You better believe I know your home girl said you should leave  
Know you was tired like the Michelin man  
What if Gina would have listened to Pam  
Now they hate to see us last this long  
When they get my album probably pass this on  
Thought they knew me well  
Money cant buy you happiness thats true as hell  
The happiness cant buy yo ass this new SL  
I love you like the fat kid loves cakes and shit  
I love you like the bad kid love breakin shit  
Ride or die chick fighting insecurities  
Want ring and my last name for securities  
  
It may seem like our fire  
Has been a little burnt out were tired  
We only need to stay close  
In time sparks will fly  
And we fly too and we and we  
And we fly too  
  
It may seem like our fire  
Has been a little burnt out were tired  
We only need to stay close  
In time sparks will fly  
And we fly too and we and we  
And we fly too  
  
I know my style aint perfect  
I know my smile aint perfect  
Nigga aint perfect its true  
Funny though Im perfect for you  
All the drama seem worth it for you  
She put up with the shit like she work at the zoo true  
Now what you crying for  
She says you aint gon settle down what you lyin for  
She want that old thing back  
Things aint the same think we both seen that  
Love is war end up on the floor  
But baby you only lose when you dont swing back  
I say those word hoping that  
You fight for a nigga like I fight for you  
Like I fight temptations every night for you  
And though I slip only girl in my life is you  
  
It may seem like our fire  
Has been a little burnt out were tired  
We only need to stay close  
In time sparks will fly  
And we fly too and we and we  
And we fly too  
  
It may seem like our fire  
Has been a little burnt out were tired  
We only need to stay close  
In time sparks will fly  
And we fly too and we and we  
And we fly too  
  
Feels as though our worlds crashing down  
We cant forget to breathe through this now  
We live through the ups and the downs  
Itll get better  
  
It may seem like our fire  
Has been a little burnt out were tired  
We only need to stay close  
In time sparks will fly
