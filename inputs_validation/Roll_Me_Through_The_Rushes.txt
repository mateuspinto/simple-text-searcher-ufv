Chorus  
Roll me through the rushes like Moses  
Roll me through the rushes just like Moses  
  
Roll me through the rushes like Moses  
Guide me to the new woman who waits  
Current leave me on the banks  
By the cottage  
Where we will dine with silver cups  
And golden plates  
  
Chorus  
  
Ive prepared for my last journey  
You know Ive worked all my life  
To make this basket strong  
But a woman alone on a river  
She cant stay in the water too long  
  
Ive been chilled Ive lost my will  
And Ive stayed away from rivers  
Much too long  
I really must stay in this dirty dirty city  
Till I found out that my strength was gone  
  
Chorus  
  
Just like Moses  
  
Make my journey make it short in space  
Let me lose this hardness that I got now Lord  
Water wash away all traces of hate  
I will do what you say  
If you just show me how river  
  
Chorus  
  
Roll me through the rushes like Moses  
Roll me through the rushes  
Just like Moses on the Nile  
  
River river sail Repeat x4
