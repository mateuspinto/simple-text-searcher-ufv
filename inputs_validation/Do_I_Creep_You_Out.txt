I know that you  
Dont know me very well  
Weve barely met  
But I can surely tell  
No one will ever  
Love you like I do  
I like to feel  
The warm spot on your chair  
Sometimes I drool  
And usually I stare  
My precious one  
I saved that gum  
That you threw in the garbage  
Youre the one I dream about  
But the only question with me now  
Is Do I creep you out  
Everytime I shake your hand now  
Wanna stick your fingers in my mouth  
Do I creep you out  
Call you every night and hang up  
Gonna carve your name in my leg  
In my leg ohoh  
Somethin I should ask about  
Can I sniff the pitstains on your blouse  
And do I creep you  
Do I creep you out  
Your restraining orders out  
Still the only question with me now  
Oh the only question  
Is Do I creep you out  
Is Do I creep you out  
Know exactly where you live now  
Follow you from work right to your house  
Well do I creep you out  
Do I creep you out  
cheering crowd
