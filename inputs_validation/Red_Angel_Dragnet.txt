I come from a long way away  
And I know a fine thing when I see it  
See it  
For the same reason no one ever  
Pointed a telescope at the sun  
Talking about the Red Angels of New York City  
  
Chorus  
Who shot the shot  
Who got shot tonight  
  
Not even five enforcement agencies can save their own  
Never mind the people  
Tonight its raining on the Angels of the City  
Did anyone prophesize these people  
  
Only Travis  
Come in Travis  
One of these days Im gonna get myself organized  
  
All the animals come out at night  
Queens fairies dopers junkies sick venal  
Some day a real rain will come and wash all the scum off the streets  
  
Thank god for the rain to wash the trash off the sidewalk Listen you
screwheads  
Here is a man who would not take it anymore  
A man who stood up against the scum the filth  
Now I see clearly  
  
Personally I know the alley  
Where Jack feeds on the birds of night  
Not even bubbies on bicycles 2x2  
Can stop the blood and feathers flying  
  
Waring overalls and for once and for all  
What is the dream  
Ill tell it  
To live like they do in the movies  
San Juan you listening  
  
Yeah I bet you are  
Hands up for Hollywood  
Hooray  
I hear you  
Snappy on the air  
Hang in their  
Wall to wall  
You saved the world  
What else You saved the girl  
Champagne on ice  
No stranger to Alcatraz  
To boot  
Or strip it down  
Chop it a little  
Being reasonable  
Just freedom to move  
To live  
For women to take a walk in the park at midnight  
Hey but this is serious  
She cant even get back home  
  
I come from a long way off  
And I know a life giver over a life taker  
For the same reason noone ever pointed  
A gun at a policeman  
Talking about the Red Angels of New York City  
Yeah
