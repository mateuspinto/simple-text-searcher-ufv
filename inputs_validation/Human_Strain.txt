Illness infected born mutilated strain  
Issue transfusion no one left to blame  
Natures way of thinning out the human fucking herd  
  
Disease to war to fear his own kind  
The human strain returning plague  
Drink the tainted blood  
From the only child  
  
Cities increase speed population rise  
Dying the future process in the genes  
Death stalking man as he embraces the absurd  
Through peace through life the hatred of himself  
  
The human strain returning plague  
Drink the tainted blood  
From the only child  
Death stalking man though peace through life though hatred of himself  
  
Death stalking man as he embraces his crucifixion  
Skinless resurrection from the bodies of the dead  
Sickness is increasing as the oceans turn red  
  
Apparatus for self destruction day of judgement is now at hand  
Decayed memories haunt vaccinated minds  
Risk contamination mechanism of death  
Anyone left alive scorch turn to ash  
  
Disease war black death touching man  
The human strain returning plague  
Drink the tainted blood  
From the only child
