Now were on a journey  
Into darker times  
See the man made mountains  
Built for those divine  
Walk into the twilight  
In the land of the dead  
Gods walked the earth  
City of a thousand gates  
They were kings from birth  
That was their given fate  
In the valley of kings  
Where the echoes still ring  
On the hot desert winds  
In the valley of kings  
Their souls are immortal  
Within the after life  
Theyre soaring through the portal  
To be eternal light  
Ruling without mercy  
Reigning life on earth  
Gods walked the earth  
City of a thousand gates  
They were kings from birth  
That was their given fate  
In the valley of kings  
Where the echoes still ring  
On the hot desert winds  
In the valley of kings  
Gods walked the earth  
City of a thousand gates  
They were kings from birth  
That was their given fate  
In the valley of kings  
Where the echoes still ring  
On the hot desert winds  
In the valley of kings
