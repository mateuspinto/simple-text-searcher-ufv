Got some action on the other side  
Loose teeth in my head  
New programs are coming in  
So rise and take your oath  
I wish we could get away  
Drink wine and screw  
I knew someone else before  
Looked a lot like you  
  
Chorus  
And theyre gone  
Im gone  
In space  
  
I been programed as I said before  
Technology  
Just rollin wheezin and breathin  
Eyeballs and teeth  
Words are weightless here on earth because theyre free  
You knew someone else before  
Looked a lot like me  
  
Chorus x2
