She sits and stares out the window at the water  
Every night down at Incomprehensible Cafe  
All alone she sips her pina colada  
Talkin to herself dreamin time away  
The story is that a dark haired stranger  
Stole her heart many years ago  
He promised her hed come back and take her  
Around the world bring her hills of gold  
Down on Longboat Key  
Where the island sand meets the Gulf Stream Bridge  
Down on Longboat Key  
She spends her life in a dream on Longboat Key  
Down on Longboat Key  
Down on Longboat Key  
Each afternoon as the snug boats come in  
She runs to meet them down at the pier  
She sees the fishermen the nets and the sunset  
But she dont see him her eyes fill with tears  
She stands there lookin at the crystal blue water  
And in the coral she imagines pearls  
She makes believe he brought them all the way from China  
Then the water swirls the bluegreen water swirls  
Down on Longboat Key  
Where the island sand meets the Gulf Stream Bridge  
Down on Longboat Key  
She spends her life in a dream on Longboat Key  
Down on Longboat Key  
Down on Longboat Key  
Young sailors make a play to take her home  
She says No Im already taken  
Oh they just laugh when she mentions his name  
She just keeps on waiting waiting waiting waiting  
Down on Longboat Key  
Where the island sand meets the Gulf Stream Bridge  
Down on Longboat Key  
She spends her life in a dream  
Down on Longboat Key  
Down on Longboat Key yeah yeah  
Down on Longboat Key  
Where the island sand meets the Gulf Stream Bridge  
Down on Longboat Key  
Down on Longboat Key yeah yeah  
Down on Longboat Key
