Bodies deformed way beyond belief  
Cast out from their concerned society  
Flesh contorting day after day  
Freak of the dark world is what the people say  
  
Their lives decay before their eyes  
There is no hope of cure  
Among their own kind they live  
A life thats so obscure  
First an arm and then a leg  
Deterioration grows  
Rotting while they breathe  Death comes slow  
  
Leprosy will take control and bring you to your death  
No chance of a normal life to live just like the rest  
Leprosy will spread with time your body soon to change  
Appearance becomes hideous a sight too much to take  
  
Tuberculoid the most severe  
Decay of the nerves comes fast  
Sense of feeling soon to be gone  
Life will never last  
  
No hope of recovery after the nerves are eaten away  
Damage is done you feel no more pain  
Bones decay deterioration grows  
Origin of this horrid disease nobody knows  
  
Their lives decay before their eyes  
There is no hope of cure  
Among their own kind they live  
A life thats so obscure  
First an arm and then a leg  
Deterioration grows  
Rotting while they breathe  Death comes slow  
  
Leprosy will take control and bring you to your death  
No chance of a normal life to live just like the rest  
Leprosy will spread with time your body soon to changel  
Appearance becomes hideous a sight too much to take
