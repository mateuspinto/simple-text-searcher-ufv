I remember years ago  
A little girl with her laughter  
From high up on on your shoulders you would tell  
Me stories  
And sing to me softly  
  
Once I had a little girl  
With two braids swinging on her back  
When she undid her thick black braids  
My heart would also come undone  
  
In the meadow I unraveled them  
Friendly old moon smiled down on us  
But in the fall shed shed them all  
To the autumn of our souls  
  
In the meadow I unraveled them  
Friendly old moon smiled down on us  
  
Once I had a little girl  
With two braids swinging on her back  
She has gone this little girl  
And taken spring away with her  
  
Now that same girl stands before you  
Long black hair caped over her shoulders  
Stage lights shine  
And in my mind  
I send a song out to you  
  
Once I had a little girl  
With two braids swinging on her back  
But autumns past  
And she will laugh  
Fall is all but gone away  
A lovely spring  
Begins  
Today
