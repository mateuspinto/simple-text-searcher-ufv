Evil walks tonight  
Unholy terror kills the light  
Phantom furies whirl  
Like a plague above the world  
Seductive demons breathe  
Writhing lust they take your seed  
Theyre the daughters of despair  
A succubus is here  
  
Black night in lust descending  
Black night they bring the devils rain  
  
Feasting on your flesh  
They come in different forms  
From a lovely nymphet girl  
To a beast with scaly horns  
Desire turns to greed  
Your loins ache for release  
Like pollen and the bees  
You perpetuate the creed  
  
Black night in lust descending  
Black night they bring the devils rain  
  
The succubus lives on your blood and your seed  
A vision of hell she delights when you bleed  
Desire is torture like thirst without water  
So just beware of the girl in your bed  
Believe
