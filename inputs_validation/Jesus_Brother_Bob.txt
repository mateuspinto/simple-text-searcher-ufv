If you havent heard of me  
I wouldnt be surprised  
I bet you know my relatives  
Their names will never die  
My mother is a saint  
And my brother is a god  
But all I am is Jesus brother Bob  
  
Jesus brother Bob Jesus brother Bob  
A nobody relative of the son of God  
If only Id been born just a little sooner  
Id be more than the brother of God Junior  
  
I have to pay the ferry  
To cross the Galilee  
But not my brother  
No not him  
He walks across for free  
I finally get to work  
Bout a quarter after nine  
Already hes turning water into wine  
  
Jesus brother Bob Jesus brother Bob  
A nobody relative of the son of God  
If only Id been born just a little sooner  
Id be more than the brother of God Junior  
  
One day when I was home  
I heard a mighty r oar  
There were a thousand people  
Right outside the door  
Help us Jesus help us  
Came the cheering from the mob  
But then they got a look at me  
Oh nuts its only Bob  
  
Jesus brother Bob Jesus brother Bob  
A nobody relative of the son of God  
If only Id been born just a little sooner  
Id be more than the brother of God Junior  
  
He died upon the cross  
I thought that I was free  
Finally people would get to know  
Me for me  
Hi Bob Hi Judas  
This was my big chance  
To finally get ahead  
The next thing you know  
Hes rising from the dead  
  
Jesus brother Bob Jesus brother Bob  
A nobody relative of the son of God  
If only Id been born just a little sooner  
Id be more than the brother of God Junior  
  
Everybody  
  
Jesus brother Bob Jesus brother Bob  
A nobody relative of the son of God  
If only Id been born just a little sooner  
Id be more than the brother of God Junior
