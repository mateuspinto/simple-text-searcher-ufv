Down around the corner half a mile from here  
See them long trains run and you watch them disappear  
Without love where would you be now  
Without loooove  
  
You know I saw miss Lucy down along the tracks  
She lost her home and her family and she wont be coming back  
Without love where would you be right now  
Without loooove  
  
Well the Illinois Central  
And the Southern Central Freight  
Got to keep on pushin mama  
You know theyre running late  
Without love where would you be now  
Without looove  
  
Well the pistons keep on turning  
And the wheels go round and round  
The steel rails are cold and hard  
For the miles that they go down  
  
Without love where would you be right now  
Without looove ooh  
Where would you be now  
  
Baby baby baby babe oh wont you move it down  
I gotta keep on moving gotta keep on moving
