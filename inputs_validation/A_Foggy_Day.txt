I was a stranger in the city  
Out of town were the people i knew  
I had that feeling of selfpity  
What to do what to do what to do  
The outlook was decidedly blue  
  
But as i walked through the foggy streets alone  
It turned out to be the luckiest day ive known  
  
A foggy day in London town  
Had me low had me down  
I viewed the morning with much alarm  
British museum had lost its charm  
  
How long i wondered  
Could this thing last  
But the age of miracles hadnt past  
For suddenly i saw you there  
And through foggy London town  
The sun was shining everywhere  
  
For suddenly i saw you there  
And through foggy London town  
The sun was shining everywhere  
  
Everywhere  
Everywhere  
Everywhere
