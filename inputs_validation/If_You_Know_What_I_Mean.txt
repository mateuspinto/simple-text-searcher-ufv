When the night returns just like a friend  
When the evening comes to set me free  
When the quiet house that wait beyond the day  
Make peaceful sounds in me  
Took a drag from my last cigarette  
Took a drink from a glass of old wine  
I closed my eyes and I could make it real  
And feel it one more time  
  
Can you hear it babe  
Can you hear it babe  
From another time  
From another place  
Do you remember it babe  
  
And the radio played like a carnival tune  
As we lay in our bed in the other room  
When we gave it away for the sake of a dream  
In a penny arcade if you know what I mean  
  
Heres to the songs we used to sing  
And heres to the times we used to know  
Its hard to hold them in our arms again  
But hard to let them go  
  
Do you hear it babe  
Do you hear it babe  
It was another time  
It was another place  
Do you remember it babe  
  
And the radio played like a carnival tune  
As we lay in our bed in the other room  
When we gave it away for the sake of a dream  
In a penny arcade if you know what I mean
