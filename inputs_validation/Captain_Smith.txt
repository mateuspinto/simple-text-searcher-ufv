My heart is sinking fast just like the titanic  
My heart is pumping blood thats turning blue  
Well I just want this cruise and I just cant imagine  
Im drowning and its all because of you  
Just as cold as ice ripped into my bough  
Drifted off in moonlight while my ship was goin down  
This cruise alone might be my last  
And I cant even fathom  
Why you left me alone to drown  
  
My heart is sinking fast just like the titanic  
Captain would you please go warn the crew  
Well everything is built to last but it dont last forever  
Im sorry but the end is coming soon  
  
Just as cold as ice ripped into my bough  
Drifted off in moonlight while my ship was goin down  
This cruise alone might be my last  
And I cant even fathom  
Why you left me alone to drown  
  
Just as cold as ice ripped into my bough  
Drifted off in moonlight while my ship was goin down  
This cruise alone might be my last  
And I cant even fathom  
Why you left me all alone to drown  
  
Why you left me all alone to drown
