Christopher robin and I walked along  
As the branches lit up by the moon  
Posing our questions to owl and eyore  
As our days disappeared all too soon  
But I wandered much farther today than I should  
And I cant seem to find my way back to the woods  
  
So help me if you can Ive got to get  
Back to the house at pooh corner by one  
Youd be surprised theres so much to be done  
Count all the bees in the hive  
Chase all the clouds from the sky  
Back to the days of christopher robin and pooh  
  
Winnie the pooh doesnt know what to do  
Got a honey jar stuck on his nose  
Now he came to me asking help and advice  
And from here no one knows where he goes  
So I sent him to ask of the owl if hes there  
How to loosen a jar from the nose of a bear  
  
So help me if you can Ive got to get  
Back to the house at pooh corner by one  
Youd be surprised theres so much to be done  
Count all the bees in the hive  
Chase all the clouds from the sky  
Back to the days of christopher robin and pooh  
  
So help me if you can Ive got to get  
Back to the house at pooh corner by one  
Youd be surprised theres so much to be done  
Count all the bees in the hive  
Chase all the clouds from the sky  
Back to the days of christopher robin  
Back to the ways of christopher robin  
Back to the ways of pooh
