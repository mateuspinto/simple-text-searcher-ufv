Hold me close and hold me fast  
This magic spell you cast  
This is la vie en rose  
  
When you kiss me heaven sighs  
And though I close my eyes  
I see la vie en rose  
  
When you press me to your heart  
Im in a world apart  
A world where roses bloom  
  
And when you speak angels sing from above  
Everyday words seem to turn into love songs  
  
Give your heart and soul to me  
And life will always be la vie en rose
