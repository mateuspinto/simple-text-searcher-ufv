I cant cover up my feelings  
In the name of love  
Or play it safe  
For a while that was easy  
And if living for myself  
Is what Im guilty of  
Go on and sentence me  
Ill still be free  
  
Its my turn  
To see what I can see  
I hope youll understand  
This times just for me  
  
Because its my turn  
With no apologies  
Ive given up the truth  
To those Ive tried to please  
  
But now its my turn  
If I dont have all the answers  
At least I know Ill take my share of chances  
Aint no use of holding of  
When nothing stays the same  
  
So Ill let it rain  
Cause the rain aint gonna hurt me  
And Ill let you go  
Though I know it wont be easy  
  
Its my turn  
With no more room for lies  
For years Id seen my life  
Through someone elses eyes  
  
And now its my turn  
To try and find my way  
And if I should get lost  
At least Ill own today  
  
Its my turn  
Yes its my turn  
And there aint no use in holding of  
When nothing stays the same  
  
So Ill let it rain  
Cause the rain aint gonna hurt me  
And Ill let you go  
Though I know it wont be easy  
  
Its my turn  
To see what I can see  
I hope youll understand  
This times just for me  
  
Because its my turn  
To turn and say goodbye  
I sure would like to know  
That youre still on my side  
  
Because its my turn  
Its my turn  
  
Its my turn  
To start from number one  
Trying to undo  
Some damage thats been done  
  
But now its my turn  
To reach and touch the sky  
No ones gonna say  
At least I didnt try  
  
Its my turn  
Yes its my turn  
Its my turn  
Its my turn  
Its my turn
