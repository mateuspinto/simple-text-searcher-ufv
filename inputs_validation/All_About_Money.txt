Young Buck  
You a thug like me  
Verse 1  
You can catch me green stick it up

Cut a nigga shit over 50 bucks  
Need work on the low nigga hit me up  
Never quick enough after pickin up  
Feds on a nigga block ridiculous

I done bit the dustcountinus  
Now I ride double  to the ind you bust  
Oh no wrong move if my ind you touch  
17 but its real when you playin with much  
One in the chamber on the table when you chillin for lunch  
And head up with your door open feelin your blunt  
Where Im from 20 gone by the end of the month  
I get drunk smoke the weed to the end of the blunt  
Make sure 10 shells done been in the pump  
If its onfirst draw thats a nigga wit luck  
All niggas playin games start endin em up  
cause your block young buck will start bendin em up  
As soon as your adrenaline pump  
Make way dear lord cause Im sendin em up  
Chorus x2  
Its all about money  
Gettin major paid  
Stack your cheese in all different ways  
Tote your strap and keep your khakis creased  
Yeah nigga you a thug like me

You know I spray the heat  
The AK gun niggas down fatefully  
You think expectfully just wait and see

Chorus x2  
Verse 3  Young Buck  
Its all bout thuggin  
Gettin paid and shit  
You either slang the dope or hit major licks  
Thats why all my niggas be sevin bricks  
Yall gunna see what we workin with  
Not me baby doll  
I aint hurtin for shit  
GS 400 with a leather kit  
Oh you dont wanna holla  
Well whatever bitch  
Dont say shit when the bezzle flip  
See a nigga tote straps for the hell of it  
I aint givin a fuck about jealous shit  
And I dont smoke weed for the smell of it  
Just before I kill I inhale the shit  
You cant trail me bitch I be in 50 states  
Paranoid with about 50 cakes  
Once a nigga find out its all heart no shake  
Thats when I infest the place  
Im thugged out  
Up in the drug house  
Got it allfrom the beer to a quarter ounce  
We da real ass niggas all work no slouch  
Can I get that there all that count  
All they amount  
But when it go down and a nigga make all ya say all that out  
What you gunna do nigga what you about  
Either ride or die when Im raised in the south  
Love the block when a nigga wake up  
I wash my face and then hug my glock  
Brush my teeth and scream south side  
Smoke a blunt and put on my socks  
But it still dont stop from dusk to dawn  
A nigga been out here on his ownlivin day to day  
See Im only 17 but a nigga out here just gains farm
