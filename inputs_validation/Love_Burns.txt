See what you do  
You make me act so crazy  
Im overcome I know  
Stealin my own show  
  
For your love  
And who am I now Clown or Casanova  
Im never sure with you  
And what more can I do  
  
For your love burns  
Warmer than you know  
When love burns  
Never let it go away  
  
And where do we go  
Find a road to lead us  
Im searching in your eyes  
A world beyond the skies  
  
For your love burns  
Brighter than you know  
When love burns  
Never let it go away  
  
Love burns  
Brighter than you know  
Oh love burns  
Never let it go away  
  
Love burns when the spirit is wounded  
Cut deep by the sound of rejection  
Love burns in the soul of the seeker  
Blue shadows in every direction  
  
Love burns when the heart is uncovered  
In the rage of the coldly storm  
Love burns  
Through the night and the morning  
  
Till the frozen heart is warm  
Love burns  
Love burns  
Love burns  
Love burns
