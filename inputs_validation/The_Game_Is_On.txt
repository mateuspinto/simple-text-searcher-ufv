Have you seen this little toy  
When youre down it gives you joy  
You escape reality  
Delve into its TV screen  
For the rich and for the poor  
For the even more secure  
Doesnt matter where you are  
Where you go or when you been  
Well theres still no guarantee  
For your virgin mind you see  
Just go on and play the game  
You will surely go insane  
  
The game is on  
And you have gone  
Gone to a world on its display  
And the game is fun  
But when it has won  
All you ever hear is what it says  
  
Theres a great amount of fumes  
Coming out from somebodys room  
The firemen got there  
Walking their way up the stairs  
Find a man in a chair  
But it doesnt seem hes there  
With a grey box in his hands  
He has gone to another land  
  
The game is on  
And you have gone  
Gone to a world on its display  
And the game is fun  
But when it has won  
All you ever hear is what it says  
  
SOLO  
  
You have played it much too long  
Now your senses get things strong  
All your walls come crashing down  
Now its time for you to frown  
How dyou like this heavy load  
Guess your brain will soon explode  
You never had this ugly feel  
Its time to dial an emergency
