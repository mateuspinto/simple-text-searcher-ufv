G I dreamed that the great judgement C morning  
Had G dawned and the trumpet had D7 blown  
I G dreamed that all nations had C gathered  
To G judgement be D7 fore the white G throne  
From the throne came A bright shining C angel  
And he G stood on the land and the D7 sea  
And G swore with his hand raised to C heaven  
That G time was no D7 longer to G be  
Chorus  
And oh what weeping and C wailing  
As the G lost were told of their D7 fate  
They G cried for the rocks and the C mountains  
They G prayed but their D7 prayers were too G late  
The rich man was there but his money  
Had melted and vanished away  
A pauper stood there in the judgement  
His debts were too many to pay  
The great man was there but his greatness  
When death came was left far behind  
The angel that opened the records  
No trace of his greatness could find  
Repeat chorus  
The widow was there and the orphan  
God heard and remembered their cries  
No sorrow in heaven forever  
God wiped all the tears from their eyes  
The gambler was there and the drunkard  
And they who had sold them the drink  
With people who gave them the license  
Together in hell they did sink  
Repeat chorus  
The moral man to the judgement  
But self rightousness would not do  
For the men who had crucified jesus  
Had passed off as moral men too  
And the souls that had put off salvation  
Not tonight Ill get saved by and by  
No time now to think of salvation  
At last they had found time to die  
Repeat chorus
