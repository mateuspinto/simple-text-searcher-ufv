a black swan rode me into my place of destiny  
to love to feel so madly  
stubborn to disagree  
with people who think that life is just a memory  
to be denied  
ill take this picture for ages  
of just you and i  
  
as the world goes round  
its got me thinking  
that the things i want  
just keep me sinking down  
  
a white horse picks my dreams up  
to take my hopes to god  
my prayers have nestled brightly  
to dim my sense of awe  
i want you to be someone i cant deny  
a house of fire  
i want you to be something i realize  
  
as the world goes round  
its got me thinking  
that the things i want  
just keep me sinking down  
as the world goes round  
its got me thinking  
that the things i want  
will keep me sinking down  
  
remove my spirit from darkness  
love become my heaven  
as the world goes round with our love  
  
i want you to be my message  
i want you to be my friend  
i want you to be that answer  
an answer i must defend  
i want us to solve our distrust of everyone  
and trust in god  
i want us to solve our distrust of who we are  
  
as the world goes round  
its got me thinking  
that the things i want  
just keep me sinking down  
as the world goes round  
its got me thinking  
that the things i want  
just keep me sinking down  
  
as the world goes round with our love  
as the world goes round with our love  
  
remove my spirit from darkness  
love become my heaven  
remove my spirit from darkness  
love become my heaven  
remove my spirit from darkness  
love become my heaven  
as the world goes round with our love  
as the world goes round with our love
