There must be something I missed  
I wake up in the morning just makin a fist  
I dont call it living I just exist  
There must be something I missed  
  
Yeah there must be something I need  
Something in a cage that wants to be freed  
I should be happy but yes indeed  
There must be something I need  
  
Yeah we live and learn crash and burn  
Til its our turn again  
Its the way its always been  
Oh whoa oh  
Why cant I just let go  
I told me so I oughta know by now  
It all comes down to this  
  
Yeah there must be something I missed  
Yeah there must be something I missed  
I wake up in the morning just makin a fist  
I dont call it living I just exist  
There must be something I missed  
  
Yeah there must be something I crave  
I try to be good but I misbehave well  
Maybe Im too far gone to save  
There must be something I crave  
  
Yeah we live and learn crash and burn  
Til its our turn again  
Its the way its always been  
Oh whoa oh  
Why cant I just let go  
I told me so I oughta know by now  
It all comes down to this  
  
Yeah there must be something I missed  
Yeah there must be something I missed  
Yeah there must be something I missed
