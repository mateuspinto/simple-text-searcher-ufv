She was a waitress in a west Texas dance hall  
I was a cowboy with a throat full of sand  
I called her Honey when she brought my whiskey  
And later I left there holding her hand  
Then we walked down the street to a tumble down hotel  
Where she had a room on a cold second floor  
And that room looked like hell just a bed and a table  
A shade on the window and a lock on the door  
I said to myself shes cheap and shes easy  
But she dont look half bad Ill stay for the night  
But Ill leave when its early cause Ive got this feeling  
She wont look so good in the bright morning light  
 harmonica   
Ive known some devils and Ive known some angels  
I once had a woman on the Mexico line  
But Ive never been touched like that woman touched me  
She lay there beside me and crawled in my mind  
And we talked and we smoked and made love till mornin  
The sun come a streamin through a hole in the shade  
And it fell like a spotlight on her face and her body  
And it hung like a halo round the bed where we lay  
I said to myself shes cheap and shes easy  
But she dont look half bad I guess Ill stay for the night  
But Ill tell you boys that was five years ago and Lord God what a woman  
She still looks as good in the bright morning light
