We took the long way home you held my hand  
The days so full of all the things we had planned  
We walked beyond the green beyond the day  
We shared a dream that I let slip away  
  
I had to find myself  
I had to find myself  
No use looking for no one else  
Cause Ill be lonely till I find myself  
  
You were the man who knew too much to say  
So many things that I learned came your way  
These things I know that I cant forget  
Deep in my heart theyre a part of me yet  
  
They helped me find myself  
They helped me find myself  
No use looking for no one else  
Cause Ill be lonely till I find myself  
  
Too many years rolled by without a word  
I tried to hide behind things that Id heard  
And now the truth is clear for all to see  
That through it all it was you believed in me  
  
You helped me find myself  
I had to find myself  
No use looking for no one else  
Cause Ill be lonely till I find myself  
  
I got to find myself  
I got to find myself  
No use looking for no one else  
Cause Ill be lonely till I find myself
