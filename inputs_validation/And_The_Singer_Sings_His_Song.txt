Young it was  
True it was  
Days without wondring  
Fall with a special thing  
Laugh I could laugh  
And I did  
And the singer sings his song  
And the children dance along  
And the singer sings his song  
And we dance along  
Good it was  
When it was  
We chased the flowers  
Warm summer showers  
Once it was once  
Long ago  
And the singer sings his song  
And the children dance along  
And the singer sings his song  
And we dance along  
Once it was once  
Long ago  
And the singer sings his song  
And the children dance along  
And the singer sings his song  
And we dance along  
And the singer sings his song  
And we dance along
