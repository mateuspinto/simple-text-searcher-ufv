Hold a halo round the world  
Golden is the day  
Princes of the Universe  
Your burden is the way  
So there is no better time  
Who will be born today  
A gypsy child at the day break  
A King for a day  
  
Chorus  
Out of the Shadow and into the sun  
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done  
Oh there is beauty and surely there is pain  
But we must endure it to live again  
  
Dusty dreams in fading daylight  
Flicker on the walls  
Nothing new your lifes adrift  
What purpose to it all  
Eyes are closed and death is calling  
Reaching out its hand  
Call upon the starlight to surround you  
  
Out of the Shadow and into the sun  
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done  
Oh there is beauty and surely there is pain  
But we must endure it to live again  
  
Chorus x3  
  
A man who casts no shadow has no soul
