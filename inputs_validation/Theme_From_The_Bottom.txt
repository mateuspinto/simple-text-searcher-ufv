I feed from the bottom you feed from the top  
I live upon morsels you happen to drop  
And coffee that somehow leaks out of your cup  
If nothing comes down then Im forced to swim up  
On the way upwards the colors come back  
But all along the bottom is blue grey and black  
The darkness is cold and perception goes wrong  
And the night seems to go on incredibly long  
  
So I ask you why if Im swimming by  
Dont you see anything youd like to try  
  
Pantomime mixtures of heaven and earth  
Jumbled events that have less than no worth  
Time in the forest to dig under rocks  
Or float in the ocean asleep in a box  
  
Or sink just below all the churning and froth  
And swim to the light source or fly like a moth  
So toss away stuff you dont need in the end  
But keep whats important and know whos your friend  
  
So I ask you why if Im swimming by  
Dont you see anything that youd like to try  
  
If Im swimming by  
  
From the bottom from the top  
From the bottom from the top  
From the bottom from the top  
From the bottom from the top  
  
From the bottom from the top  
From the bottom from the top  
From the bottom from the top  
From the bottom from the top
