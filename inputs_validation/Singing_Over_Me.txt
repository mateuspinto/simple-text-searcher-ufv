When I waited so long when my tears were my song  
With my hope nearly gone You held me God  
To believe in the face of the dry weary place  
When You felt far away You held me God  
Oh there is freedom in surrender oh I know it  
Your songs have never stopped  
Youve been singing always singing over me  
Your words are still enough  
And Youre singing always singing over me  
The chaos in the cause teaching me to see Lord  
The beauty in the storm so I believe  
When I see through Your eyes through the testing of time  
Every cloud silver lined cause Youre with me  
Oh there is freedom in surrender oh I know it  
Your songs have never stopped  
Youve been singing always singing over me  
Your words are still enough  
And Youre singing  
Give me faith  
Give me strength enough to wait  
To stand in faith  
And listen for listen for Your melody  
Your songs have never stopped  
Your songs have never stopped  
Your songs have never stopped  
Youve been singing always singing over me  
Your words are still enough  
And Youre singing always singing over me  
Your songs have never stopped  
Youve been singing always singing over me  
Your words are still enough  
And Youre singing always singing over me  
Always singing over me always singing over me  
Always singing over me
