Still  
Spinning round in my head  
How I regret everything that I said  
Why did I tell you to go  
Saving my pride but losing my soul  
  
Im here all alone  
Still wait by the phone  
The hours go by  
What else could I do but to cry  
  
I call and I call  
Just to make things right  
Have I lost the fight  
Where were you last night  
  
I beg and I cry  
I keep asking why  
Where were you last night  
Where were you last night  
  
Lost  
In the dark and my fears  
If only you saw the tracks of my tears  
I think Im losing my mind  
Where did you go and what did you find  
  
Im here all alone  
Still wait by the phone  
The hours go by  
What else could I do but to cry  
  
I call and I call  
Just to make things right  
Have I lost the fight  
Where were you last night  
  
I beg and I cry  
I keep asking why  
Where were you last night  
Where were you last night  
  
I call and I call  
Just to make things right  
Have I lost the fight  
Where were you last night  
  
I beg and I cry  
I keep asking why  
Where were you last night  
Where were you last night  
  
Im here all alone  
Still wait by the phone  
The hours go by  
What else could I do but to cry  
  
I call and I call  
Just to make things right  
Have I lost the fight  
Where were you last night  
  
I call and I call  
Just to make things right  
  
I call and I call  
Just to make things right  
Have I lost the fight  
Where were you last night  
  
I beg and I cry  
I keep asking why  
Where were you last night  
Where were you last night  
  
Where were you last night  
Where were you last night  
  
I call and I call  
Just to make things right  
Have I lost the fight  
Where were you last night  
  
I beg and I cry  
I keep asking why  
Where were you last night  
Where were you last night  
  
I call and I call  
Just to make things right  
Have I lost the fight  
Where were you last night
