And the little boy started  
Into the eyes of the night  
Button collects price of his time  
Little girl glared  
Sheets of the denial  
The bullet connects to the price of her crime  
  
What have we said  
Wasnt it their bed  
What of our presence  
Havent we paid penance  
  
Now the little boy sees  
Through the eyes of delight  
Levers erect note of his rhyme  
Little girl bled  
Sheets of the night  
The lovers connect to the price of his dime  
  
What have we said  
Wasnt it their bed  
What of our presence  
Havent we paid penance  
  
To the old gods and moved on  
To the old gods and moved on  
To the old gods and moved on  
To the new guns to the new guns  
  
What have we said  
Wasnt it their bed  
What of our presence  
Havent we paid penance  
  
What have we said  
Wasnt it their bed  
What of our presence  
Havent we paid penance  
  
To the old gods and moved on  
To the old gods and moved on  
To the old gods and moved on  
To the new guns to the new guns
