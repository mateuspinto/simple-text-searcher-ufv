Xzibit  
Last but not least we off the leash  
The Art of War reach for your masterpiece  
Feel the release from the phantom bangs you  
Snatched off put you in a frame and hang you  
Comin at you niggas from a different angle  
Arch Angel choke hold and strangled  
Kay Slay the game turn the tables  
Get cables Im Kane you Abel  
Start bullshit conflicts labels  
Man handled murder mangled  
Life support cut short we hold court  
In the street make a nigga sleep six feet deep  
Fuck piece bare back doggystyle  
Cement ya feet and hold ya down  
Throw you off the bridge and watch you drown  
Last one to laugh its over now  
  
Hook  
Well trade ya six and pancake ya loan  
Break ya bitch and take ya doe  
Shake ya Crys and take it whoa  
Layin down the whole dance floor  
Break yourself right now  
Open bar free drinks this way  
Walkin the West possin the South  
Coke can put these in ya mouth  
Hands up jack the whole crowd  
Break yourself right now  
  
Xzibit  
Break crash from ya ass so dont rush to bust  
Bitches die cry and lust for us  
Damn it feel good to be platinum plus  
Dont fuck wit us cuzz we dangerous  
Hold fans like fiends on Angel Dust  
Clean get aways I get out the cuffs  
Coast like a sailor you fuckin fucks  
I done hand it hard to keep in touch  
Dont pop the Crys I pop the clutch  
Pop one to ya mouth cuzz you talk too much  
Way in over ya head you get played  
Left holdin the bag like John Forte  
Built for this all work no play here to stay  
The rest get blown away  
Built for this all work no play here to stay  
The rest get blown away

To the back stage in there she blow
