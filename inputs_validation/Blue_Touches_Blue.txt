Blue touches blue  
Touches grey touches brown  
I look down at my feet theyve been with me for years  
I take one step for you and then two for myself  
Oh I need to be stronger  
I need to be stronger  
  
Blue touches blue  
Touches black then expands  
All the tears and the years in the palm of my hand  
Do you think you can tell me whats wrong and whats wronger  
I need to be stronger  
I need to be stronger  
  
I want to twist in your arms  
Like a snake thats been charmed  
Like a baby newborn with his arms groping out  
I would shout but theres always a song and  
I need to be stronger  
I need to be stronger  
  
Blue touches blue  
  
I look down at my feet  
  
I take one step for you  
  
I need to be stronger  
  
Blue touches blue  
Touches gray frothy white  
Where my face is all blurred and reflecting the night  
If I tell you I feel like a bird in the cold  
And I need you to hold me  
I need you to hold me  
  
Blue touches blue
