Your price name the time  
The suspect or the crime  
The shadow of my gun  
Get down or you can run  
  
Feed the demon kiss the flame feel your desire  
Empty room turn the key  
Youre never alone  
When youre with me  
  
Temptation break the vow  
Cut flesh from the sacred cow  
Unchain the tiger kiss the flame feel your desire  
Feed the demon kiss the flame feel your desire  
  
Soaked in fear the curtain falls  
Religion within these walls  
Mystify my soul beliefs  
Confession is my release  
  
Feed the demon kiss the flame feel your desire  
Unchain the tiger crucify feed your desire  
Pearl of euphoria  
Pearl of euphoria
