Take your children down to the water wash their heads and sing holy holy  
Last night I dreamed you were standing there strong and tall beside me  
All my life behind me  
  
You gently took me by my hand and led me to where I couldnt seebut where
Ive always been an island  
In my dreams Ive been an island  
Where Im all alone and Ive built these walls stone by stone  
I want to leave but I dont know where to go  
  
Ive tried the best I can but its hard to be a man and feel the way you
feel  
Im different on the inside Ive tried to give to you what you need to get
you through  
  
Ill always be beside you  
The day you were born I held you small and helpless crying your life and mine
entwining  
As I looked into your eyes I saw myself in an overview reaching out to you
from this island in the sea  
I dont want to be an island  
  
Ive tried the best I can but its hard to be a man and feel the way you
feel  
Im different on the inside  
  
Ive tried to give to you what you need to get you through  
Ill always be beside you
