Long road black road touch the road  
Its a hard road  
Spontaneous combustion  
Final decision its the only way  
Straight up off from the aggressive rock  
Intelligensia  
But I feel no pain  
From the vacuum that sucks me in  
Chorus I saw you drifting away  
With your car today  
With the world rushing by  
In the wink of an eye  
Move away from the whip  
On the reality ship  
And the world is a toy  
For sensational gravity boy  
Words in the important points  
Is the assassin  
Models just them figurines  
Yeah just the ones we chose to keep  
Look them over vaguely spacy  
He spots them  
And he will not change  
He is a trooper when it comes to that  
Chorus
