I told my man Im having a barbecue  
So grab some folks and wont you slide right through  
He brought this shorty that I used to know  
It brought me back to when I was in school  
  
She said usher where have you been  
We used to kick it every now and then  
Remember when I used to call your phone  
Tell you come on cause my mothers gone  
  
How about them times I had to throw  
A rock at your window  
To let you know to come downstairs  
And open the door  
  
And after that baby it was on for sure  
  
Honey got my head spinnin around for real  
Cause Im thinking bout how good you used to feel  
And I got a girl now and I dont get down like this huh  
But I must admit Im tempted and startin to reminisce cause

Now shes asking me to take her  
On a tour of my house so we can catch up  
For all the time lost since I blew up  
And became the man that drops his pants  
And every girl around the world is dying to love  
  
Break the beat down  
Let me tell you what Im talking about  
If youre not careful itll turn you out  
Its that way she used to go  
  
When you want it nice and slow  
Even though you cant  
The memory will make you want some mo  
She used to understand me  
  
Touch me hold me taught me how to be a man  
She used to kiss me all them things she used to show me  
Damn I wish that I could do it again  
  
Honey got my head spinnin around for real  
Cause Im thinking bout how good you used to feel  
But I got a girl now and yo shes right upstairs  
But I must admit Im tempted and startin to not care cause  
  
Ay yo ay yo ay yo

Never had somebody thats as bad  
Somebody with a whole lot of body  
Thatll choose make you want to leave the one you with  
Cause you know how good it is  
  
Not a prissy lil missy baby talk that slang  
I used to love how she kissed me when she popped that thang  
She was a friend of the fam  
Hot without the glam not  
  
When I be trippin  
She didnt really give a damn stop  
Its what I need to do  
Cause I know whats this is leading to  
If I keep on thinkin bout that back  
Im a be right back in it cause yo  
  
Ay yo ay yo ay yo  
Aint nothing like some good ol ghetto  
Ay yo ay yo ay yo  
Aint nothing like some good ol ghetto
