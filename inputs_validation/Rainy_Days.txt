We were walking above  
Pretending to be in love  
In phases I watched you float away  
I was under the gun  
Trying to have some fun  
In phases I watched you slip away  
Remember all these rainy says  
We saved them up but tomorrow never came  
And now these rainy days are clouding up  
Even even the clearest of days  
We were sticking it out  
Getting used to the doubt  
In phases you watched me drift away  
Now Im taking a train  
Shooting through the rain  
Amazed that Im alone here  
Once again  
Remember all these rainy days  
We saved them up but tomorrow never came  
And now these rainy days are clouding up  
Even even the clearest of days yeah  
I watched you float away  
Remember all these rainy days  
We saved them up but tomorrow never came  
And now these rainy days are clouding up  
Even the clearest of days  
These rainy days  
We saved them up but tomorrow never came  
And now these rainy days are clouding up  
Even even the clearest of days  
And now these rainy days are clouding up  
Even even the clearest of days
