You left the water running when you left me here behind  
You left the water running running from these eyes of mine  
  
You turned out the light of love  
You left with another guy  
You turned off all your love for me  
But you forgot to turn off the cry  
You forgot to turn off the cry  
  
You pulled the shades away down low  
And disconnected the telephone  
But these tears a running from my eyes  
I cant turn them off and on  
No I cant turn them off and on  
  
You left the water running when you left me here behind  
You left the water running running from these eyes of mine  
  
You locked the door and left me outside  
And then you threw the key away  
But baby youll regret baby youll be upset  
When you get your water bill to pay  
When you get your water bill to pay  
  
You left the water running when you left me here behind  
You left the water running running from these eyes of mine
