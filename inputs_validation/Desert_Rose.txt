I dream of rain  
I dream of gardens in the desert sand  
I wake in pain  
I dream of love as time runs through my hand  
I dream of fire  
These dreams are tied to a horse that will never tire  
And in the flames  
Her shadows play in the shape of a mans desire  
This desert rose  
Each of her veils a secret promise  
This desert flower  
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this  
And as she turns  
This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams  
This fire burns  
I realise that nothings as it seems  
I dream of rain  
I dream of gardens in the desert sand  
I wake in pain  
I dream of love as time runs through my hand  
I dream of rain  
I lift my gaze to empty skies above  
I close my eyes this rare perfume  
Is the sweet intoxication of her love  
I dream of rain  
I dream of gardens in the desert sand  
I wake in pain  
I dream of love as time runs through my hand  
Sweet desert rose  
Each of her veils a secret promise  
This desert flower  
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this  
Sweet desert rose  
This memory of Eden haunts us all  
This desert flower this rare perfume  
Is the sweet intoxication of the fall
