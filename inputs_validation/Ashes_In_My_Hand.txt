It took a long time coming  
That big over the shoulder statement  
But when it came it flowed easy as poison  
Taken in extreme despair Repeat x3  
  
Remember to write often  
In case you have something to tell me  
But please dont mention the unexpected guest  
Staring into empty eyes Repeat x3  
  
A long lost confidence and pride  
Come ringing back come ringing back  
To have the shadow back again  
And happiness that feels like pain  
  
Then you left us  
To see if you could find it  
And when you came back it flowed easy as poison  
It flowed easy as poison  
Taken in extreme despair Repeat x3  
  
A long lost confidence and pride  
Come ringing back come ringing back  
To have the shadow back again  
And happiness that feels like pain Repeat x2  
  
Happiness that feels like pain Repeats
