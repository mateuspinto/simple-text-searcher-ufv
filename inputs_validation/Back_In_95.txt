Payed a quarter million dollars just to beat a murder case

Payed a quarter million dollars just to beat a murder case  
They used to run up on me be like Gucci what you know  
I told em get this glass and get da fuck away from me hoe  
And every where I go it became an instant cut  
Cause they knew I had them 20s and dem big fat monkey nuts  
  
Cant be scared of a dog when you come from Monten Park  
Shootin dice and playing cards selling blow all at the park  
Had it fresh on yo sister but I used to serv ya momma  
Breaking 50s down to dimes was my job for da summer  
And my job for the winter cookin bricks all in da kitchen  
Junkies dead at the carwash cause I heard dat dey was snitchin  
Dope jumpin out da gym man it helped me buy my tims  
Dope fiend willy used to finger fuck my rims  
Smokers didnt know my name so they used to call me black  
If ya beat me for a twenty betcha ima call you back  
She on da dope mans dick cause Im a nigga with a sack  
Im the hustler of the year and I know that for a fact

Prices so low that they call me thrift store  
Standing at the store while Im selling yayo  
Bought a brick yesterday gotta four way to go  
On the five way everything gotta go  
Fifty on the table hundred on da floor  
Middle of da summer but Ima make it snow  
Like a chia pet my money gone grow  
Still servin niggas through my burglar bar door  
Jordans jeans and a little afro  
8 ball jacket and a pair of stash slips  
I dont give credit thats how a nigga get killed  
And if you got a tilt ya car get peelt  
17 going to da 559  
Like a blind man I dont see know lines  
Thirteen when a nigga did his first crime  
Eighteen when a nigga bought his first nine  
Lyin Im frying and I sure aint flying  
Cookin up dope cause the Jays keep buyin  
Robbing crew lurking I know they trying  
Try Gucci man they ass be dying  
Let me take you back in time  
Let Gucci man refresh your mind  
Ima dope boy stay on my grind  
A good plug is so hard to finddd
