I spent too much money I looked far too glad  
Now I have so little of what I once had  
I had too many parties I had too much time  
I got so lazy and fell well behind  
Now the summer is over I can count the cost  
Footprints on the beaches are now  
Footprints in the frost  
The summer is over I can count the cost  
Footprints on the beaches are now footprints in the frost  
  
We did so much damage deep in our insides  
The partys over its going home time  
The cathedral is empty no ones at home  
Winters approaching paradise postponed  
  
Now the summer is over I can count the cost  
Footprints on the beaches are now footprints in the frost  
The rain wont stop falling and the people look lost  
Footprints on the beaches are now footprints in the frost  
  
I rang lots of numbers and walked many miles  
I watched the flinstones and I turned my dial  
To a brand new station where the beat comes in  
Now its all over the winter begins  
  
The summer is over I can count the cost  
Footprints on the beaches are now footprints in the frost  
People with umbrellas disappear in the fog  
Footprints on the beaches are now footprints in the frost
