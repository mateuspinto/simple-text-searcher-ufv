In the morning sun I couldnt tell you  
I couldnt tell you so many things  
About how much I really love you  
About how much you really mean  
So far away but its so easy to see you  
When Im away I want to put my arms around you  
And I want to know do you feel the same way  
Cause if you do I want to stay forever  
And I want to know do you feel the same way  
Cause if you do I want to stay forever  
With you  
  
So many colors that surround you  
Some so bright I can hardly see  
A light reflects on all the things that make you real  
Things that make you truly free  
  
So far away but its so easy to see you  
When Im away I want to put my arms around you  
And I want to know do you feel the same way  
Cause if you do I want to stay forever  
And I want to know do you feel the same way  
Cause if you do I want to stay forever  
With you
