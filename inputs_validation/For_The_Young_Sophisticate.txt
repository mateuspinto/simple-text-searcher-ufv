Baby baby why you cryin  
Feeling sorry what she said  
Put down the rag I told her then  
Dont wanna hear you cry again  
Dear heart dear heart  
Tell me tell me whats the reason  
Dear heart dear heart  
Tell me tell me whats the reason  
You know she went to see the doctor  
And then she read a magazine  
Forget that book I told her then  
Dont wanna hear about the book again  
Dear heart dear heart  
Work out vinnie  
Tell me tell me whats the reason  
Dear heart dear heart  
I thought you were in love vinnie  
Tell me tell me whats the reason  
There was a picture on the story  
That showed a young sophisticator  
Who falls in love three pages later  
With some aggressive agitator  
And by and by he comes to hate her  
cause she dont shave her underarms  
And he cant go for that  
cause hes a young sophisticator  
Baby baby why you cryin  
It made me wonder what she said  
Forget that book I told her then  
Dont wanna hear bout the book again  
Dear heart dear heart  
Tell me tell me whats the reason  
Dear heart dear heart  
How you doin vinnie  
Tell me tell me whats the reason  
Would you still love me if my hair grew  
All down the side of my kimono  
Well of course I would it might be hip  
If it did not cause you to trip  
Dear heart dear heart  
Or radiate a bad aroma  
Dear heart dear heart  
Or radiate a cheap aroma  
Dear heart dear heart  
Or radiaiate or radiaiaiaiate a butzis aroma  
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
