When Im alone I often think of an old house on the hill  
Of a big yard hedged in roses where we ran and played at will  
And when the night time brought us home hushing our merry din  
Mother would look around and ask are all the children in  
Well its been many a year now and the old house on the hill  
No longer has my mothers care and the yard is still so still  
But if I listen I can hear it all no matter how long its been  
I seem to hear my mother ask are all the children in  
And I wonder when the curtain falls on that last earthly day  
When we say goodbye to all of this to our pain and work and play  
When we step across the river where mother so long has been  
Will we hear ask her a final time are all the children in I come
