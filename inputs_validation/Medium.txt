Waking up I smell the scent of coffee on the brew  
And I think about the amount of the sweet  
Id like to have in my cup today  
One for the two lump three lump four  
No half of one no less no more  
  
Just give me a chance let me make it mine  
Id like a medium blend of that piece of pie  
Not too bitter not too sweet  
Medium  
Just enough to   
Medium  
Not too bitter not too sweet

Dinner time just rolls around  
And I think I crave a steak but  
Im not too partial to the meat  
When its cooked too long and Im made to wait  
  
Not too much of the parsony  
And just enough of the spice  
I think Id enjoy a mediumrare dish with a side of fries  
Not too tender not too tough  
Medium  
Not too little just enough  
Medium  
Not too tender not too tough  
Medium  
Not too little just enough

Medium Medium Medium Medium Just a medium Medium  
  
 and I smell the pits but   
I couldve sworn a  last week and scrubbed like   
I like to stink just a little bit  
Just to keep you on your toes yes  
The more I stink the more I think  
That you smell like a rose  
  
Not too pleasant not too bad  
Medium  
Just enough to hold my   
Medium  
Not too pleasant not too bad  
Medium  
Just enough to hold my
