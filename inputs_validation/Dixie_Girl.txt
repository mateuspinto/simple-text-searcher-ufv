When I was a little girl in Dixie  
I used to chase the fireflies  
Then I grew up and started chasing the guys  
Teenage romance what just the thing  
Till I got in a family way  
Now mama only working in a cheap cafe  
  
Chorus  
  
Waiting on tables and passing myself around  
Dixie girl youre the small talk  
In a small talking town  
I fall in love every day with someone  
Who ends up just driving away  
While I dreaming I with him  
Going down that west bound highway  
  
One night a man walks in and smiles  
And orders coffee black  
Took me for a ride in his brand new cadillac  
Told me he loved me with all his heart  
I told him I loved him too  
He said goodbye Dixie Ill be back for you  
  
Chorus  
  
Now all I do is read those  
Hollywood photograph magazines  
Work my shifts for tips  
And live alone in my dreams  
Im a Dixie girl who prays  
Some day shell be a Delta queen  
Find a good man  
Wholl raise me and my baby  
  
Chorus x 2
