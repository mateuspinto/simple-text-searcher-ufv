My my the clock in the sky is pounding away  
And theres so much to say  
A face a voice an overdub has no choice  
An image cannot rejoice  
  
Wanting to be  
To hear and to see  
Crying to the sky  
But the porpoise is laughing goodbye goodbye  
Goodbye goodbye goodbye  
  
Clicks clacks riding the backs of giraffes for laughs  
Salright for a while  
The ego sings of castles and kings and things that go  
With a life of style  
  
Wanting to feel  
To know what is real  
Living is a is a lie  
The porpoise is waiting goodbye goodbye  
Goodbye goodbye goodbye  
Goodbye goodbye goodbye  
Goodbye goodbye goodbye
