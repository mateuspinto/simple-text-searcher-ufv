In the next world war  
In a jack knifed juggernaut  
I am born again  
  
In the neon sign  
Scrolling up and down  
I am born again  
  
In an interstellar burst  
I am back to save the universe  
  
In a deep deep sleep  
Of the innocent  
I am born again  
  
In a fast German car  
Im amazed that I survived  
An airbag saved my life  
  
In an interstellar burst  
I am back to save the universe  
  
In an interstellar burst  
I am back to save the universe  
  
In an interstellar burst  
I am back to save the universe
