Now unto the King who reigns over all  
And never changes or turns  
Unfailing justice unfading grace  
Whose promises remain  
Yes Your promises remain  
  
The heavens ring  
The saints all sing  
Great is Your faithfulness  
From age to age  
We will proclaim  
Great is Your faithfulness  
How great is Your faithfulness  
  
Everything changes but You stay the same  
Your word and kingdom endure  
We lean on the promise of all that You are  
And trust forevermore  
We will trust forevermore  
  
From generation to generation  
You never fail us O God  
Yesterday and today and tomorrow  
Until the day You return
