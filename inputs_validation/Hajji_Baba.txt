Hajji Baba Hajji Baba Hajji Baba  
He was always in love in love in love

Bring me your lips warm as the sun  
Hear my lament oh my beloved  
Come to my arms oh wonderful one  
  
Enter my heart and stay there forever  
Lost in the spell of stars up above  
And well be like the man Hajji Baba  
Always in love always in love

Deep in each soul carefully hidden  
Theres a desire to be indiscreet  
Hajji has said when love is forbidden  
Love is so sweet love is so sweet
