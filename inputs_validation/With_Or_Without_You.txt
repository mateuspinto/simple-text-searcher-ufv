Cover of U2 song played in 2002 in New Haven ct and Stockholm Sweden  
See the stone set in your eyes  
See the thorn twist in your side  
I wait for you  
  
Sleight of hand and twist of fate  
On a bed of nails she makes me wait  
And I wait without you  
  
With or without you  
With or without you  
  
Through the storm we reach the shore  
You give it all but I want more  
And Im waiting for you  
  
With or without you  
With or without you  
I cant live  
With or without you  
  
And you give yourself away  
And you give yourself away  
And you give  
And you give  
And you give yourself away  
  
My hands are tied  
My body bruised shes got me with  
Nothing to win and  
Nothing left to lose  
  
And you give yourself away  
And you give yourself away  
And you give  
And you give  
And you give yourself away  
  
With or without you  
With or without you  
I cant live  
With or without you  
  
With or without you  
With or without you  
I cant live  
With or without you  
With or without you
