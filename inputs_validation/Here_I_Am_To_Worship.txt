Light of the world you stepped down into darkness  
Open my eyes and let me see  
Beauty that made this heart adore you  
Hope for a life spent with you  
  
Here I am to worship  
Here I am to bow down  
Here I am to say that youre my God  
Youre altogether lovely  
Altogether worthy  
Altogether wonderful to me  
  
King of all days  
Oh so highly exalted  
Glorious in heaven above  
Humbly you came to the earth you created  
All for loves sake became poor  
  
Here I am to worship  
Here I am to bow down  
Here I am to say that youre my God  
Youre altogether lovely  
Altogether worthy  
Altogether wonderful to me  
  
Ill never know how much it cost  
To see my sin upon that cross  
Ill never know how much it cost  
To see my sin upon that cross
