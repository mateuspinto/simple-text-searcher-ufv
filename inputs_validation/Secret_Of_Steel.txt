Atop the mountain where the river of steel flows  
Black is the forest white was the snow  
There as children how could children know  
One without name or number soon would show  
  
There stood he on his chariot made of gold  
He did reveal the trinity of secrets old  
  
A sceptre of iron could mercy bring  
A shield of gold the Creator and king  
And the great sword of steel  
  
Sons of destiny shall wield  
Hear Wisdoms voice  
Rise know the strength that you feel  
Hold in your heart but never reveal  
You were called by the Gods their powers to wield  
Guard well the secret of steel  
  
A sceptre of iron could mercy bring  
A shield of gold the Creator and King  
and the great sword of steel  
  
Sons of destiny shall wield  
Hear Wisdoms voice  
Rise know the strength that you feel  
Hold in your heart but never reveal  
You were called by the Gods their powers to wield  
Guard well the secret of steel
