Chorus  
And you think youve seen trouble  
Well youre lookin at the man  
Oh the worlds own original hard luck story  
And a hard time losin man  
  
Oh sometimes skies are cloudy  
And sometimes skies are blue  
And sometimes they say that you eat the bear  
But sometimes the bear eats you  
And sometimes I feel like I should go  
Far far away and hide  
Cause I keep a waitin for my ship to come in  
And all that ever comes is the tide  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh I saved up all my money  
I gonna buy me a flashy car  
So I go downtown to see the man  
And he smokin on a big cigar  
Well he must a thought I were Rockefeller  
Or an uptown man of wealth  
He said Boy I got the car thats made for you  
And its cleaner than the Board of Health  
Then I got on the highway oh I feelin fine I hit a bump  
Then I found I bought a car held together  
By wire and a couple a hunks of twine  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh Friday night feelin right  
I head out on the street  
Standin in the doorway  
Was a dealer known as Pete  
Well he sold me a dime of some superfine  
Dynamite from Mexico  
I spent all night  
Just tryin to get right  
On an ounce of Oregano  
  
Chorus
