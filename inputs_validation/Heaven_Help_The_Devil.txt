In this land of chance do we know right from wrong  
Even at a glance we know the road is long  
We dont owe a single thing to anyone  
  
Most of us do not believe in come what may  
Everything we fought for was in vain they say  
Even when called upon to throw our lives away  
  
We have been captured by the thieves of the night  
Held for ransom if you please  
Heaven help the devil may he have a few unpleasnt memories  
  
In these times of trial and uncertainty  
I have thought what does this freedom mean to me  
Is it just some long forgotten fantasy  
  
Our love for each other may not be explained  
We live in a world where tears must fall like rain  
Most of us dont wish to cause each other pain  
  
We have been captured by the thieves of the night  
Held for ransom if you please  
Heaven help the devil may he have a few unpleasnt memories  
  
To every unsung hero in the universe  
To those who roam the skies and those who roam the earth  
To all good men of reason may they never thirst  
  
We have wings to guide us through the timeless sea  
And faith that will remain through all eternity  
We try to be helpful to the ones in need  
  
We have been captured by the thieves of the night  
Held for ransom if you please  
Heaven help the devil may he have a few unpleasant memories
