When the sun goes down  
And the clouds all frown  
Night has begun for the sunset  
See it with your eyes  
Earth reenergized  
By the suns rays every day  
Take a look out there  
Planets everywhere  
When the sun goes down  
And the clouds all frown  
Night has begun for the sunset  
Shadows on the ground  
Never make a sound  
Fading away in the sunset  
Night has now become  
Day for everyone  
  
I can see it all  
From this great height  
I can feel the sun  
Slipping out of sight  
And the world still goes on  
Through the night
