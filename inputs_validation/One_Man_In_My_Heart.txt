Among oblivion

In your sleep tonight

And when we meet  
Oh oh oh la la la  
Your kiss so sweet

The things we choose  
The life we use  
The life we use  
The things you say  
All the things you say  
The need to stay  
And the need to stay  
One man in my heart  
One man in my head  
Oh la la la oh la la la  
One man in my heart  
One man in my house  
One man in my bed  
Oh la la la oh la la la  
Ive got one man one man  
One man in my
