In Baya California  
Down in Tijuana  
La senorita come to me  
She say Mi nombre es La Jaunda  
I asked her would she care to dance  
She looked at me and said Como esta  
I say Hablo solo en Ingles  
Y no comprendo Espanol  
I speak only the language of English  
I dont understand Espanol  
  
For a moment I took a notion  
Then I went into a dancing motion  
She nodded her head  
Yo mucho gusto she said  
And she danced with more devotion  
When her cheek came close to mine  
I could hear her softly whisper  
She said Habla solo la langua de Ingles  
Y no comprenda Espanol  
I speak only the language of English  
I dont understand Espanol  
  
She placed her hand before my heart  
And she whispered Yo te amora  
With half  closed eyes  
She raised her lips  
And she said Besame ahora  
She hold me close and she squeeze me tight  
And she whispered  Yo quiero ahora  
I say Hablo solo la langua de Ingles  
No comprendo Espanol  
I speak only the language of English  
I dont understand Espanol
