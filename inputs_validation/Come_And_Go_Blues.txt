People say that youre no good  
But I wouldnt cut you loose baby if I could  
Well I seem to stay down on the ground  
Baby Im too far gone to turn around  
Oh if only you would make up your mind  
Take me where you go youre leaving me behind  
Lord you got those come and go blues  
Lord you got those some and go blues  
Yes you do oh and you got me feelin like a fool  
  
Round n round round we go  
Dont ask me why I stay here I dont know  
Well maybe Im a fool to care  
Without your sweet love baby I would be nowhere  
Here Ill stay locked in your web  
Till that day I might find somebody else  
I dont know just when that would be  
I dont know I cant say as I cant see  
Lord you got me feeling like a fool  
  
Sail on darlin sail on  
Woman you go your way and Ill go mine  
Seems to me that I once heard  
That everything is finally cured by time  
So sail on darlin sail on  
Lord I wish you good luck  
And Ill see you when you come next time  
  
Woman you got those come and go blues  
Yeah you got those come and go blues  
Yes you do oh and you got me feelin like a fool
