Take a message to your head  
Just stay beside her in the bed  
You were so stupid  
To believe in things you couldnt see  
Then make them all you want  
  
If you havent got the reasons  
Just make up any reasons  
Then pick them til theyre torn  
  
Take it all away  
You took your coat today  
But they all go back in the morning  
  
Make a time to find your way  
I got a little further today  
Wash your eyes clear of anything  
Make them empty circles  
Dress yourself in black or Grey  
Im hungry like a wild waif or only child  
This lithium is heroin to me  
  
It makes it all withdraw  
All the anger and loss  
But it all keeps coming back in the morning  
  
You keep yourself too clean  
You dig yourself a dream  
That we wont be coming home alone  
  
Not this time  
Not this time  
Not this time  
Not this time
