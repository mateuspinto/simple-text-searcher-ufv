I heard what you said and I can tell you its true  
I heard youve said that I am crazy about you  
Turn in my sleep the bad dream is over  
Think of you and shall I ever recover  
  
Now I want to wake up  
How I want to wake up  
  
I stood at the kitchensink my radio played  
Songs like Tainted Love and Love Is Strange  
As I listened and the words hit my ears  
I cried sudden tears  
  
Now I want to wake up  
How I want to wake up  
Wake up  
Wake up wake up wake up wake up  
Wake up wake up wake up wake up  
  
Its mad its mad its mad  
Its mad to be in love with someone else  
When youre in love with he shes in love with me  
But you know as well as I do  
I can never think of anyone but you  
  
All my life  
All my life  
I want to wake up  
  
Play with fire play with guns  
Its easy to impress someone  
Turning in my sleep you called me fool  
To fall in love is it so uncool  
  
Now I want to wake up  
How I want to wake up  
Now I want to wake up  
Wake up  
  
Wake up wake up  
Wake up wake up  Ooh ooh ooh oh oh  
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh  
  
I I want to wake up  
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh Ooh ooh ooh oh oh Ooh ooh ooh I I want to wake up with  
you  
Ooh ooh ooh oh oh Ooh ooh ooh oh oh Ooh ooh ooh oh oh Ooh ooh ooh oh oh   
Oooh
