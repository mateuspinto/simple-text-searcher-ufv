Anger shakes the house of cards  
Loving cup upon the bars  
We bend the truth to help us through the night  
Tempers thrown against the wall  
Shattered like an empty glass  
Nothin can save us from our own selves tonight  
Anger is a might sword  
Vengeance is our own reward  
Love goes bling one eye at a time  
Gonna cut away from the ties that bind  
Hey Hey  
  
Theres an edge within my voice  
Helps me win when I should lose  
We pick and choose our weapons carefully  
Words are twisted like a fist  
Behind our backs no slight of hand  
No battle ever ended in a kiss  
  
Anger is a might sword  
Vengeance is our own reward  
Love goes bling one eye at a time  
Gonna cut away from the ties that bind  
Hey Hey  
  
Anger shakes the house of cards  
Loving cup upon the bars  
We bend the truth to help us through the night  
  
Anger is a might sword  
Vengeance is our own reward  
Love goes bling one eye at a time  
Gonna cut away from the ties that bind
