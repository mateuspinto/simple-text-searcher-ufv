He would swear by his mouth almighty  
  
I was living in a world of make believe  
When my best friend wrote and told me  
That there may be a job in the city  
I was living in a world of make believe  
When my best friend wrote and told me  
That there may be a job in the city  
And you never told me  
  
He would dream about another scheme  
About another sordid hall of dreams  
About a man whos king of industry  
He would swear by his mouth almighty  
He would buy the best  
But never something new  
And he never told me  
  
I like kicking in the gutter and  
Wishing I was lucky  
Wishing I was lucky wishing I was lucky  
Oh I like kicking in the gutter  
Wishing I was lucky wishing I was lucky  
  
Its the only life I know  
  
Lie lie  lie is all you ever do  
To make me want to push on through  
Cry cry cry is all I ever do  
Say you want to make me push on through  
  
I like kicking in the gutter and  
Wishing I was lucky  
Wishing I was lucky wishing I was lucky  
Oh I like kicking in the gutter  
Wishing I was lucky I was wishing I was lucky  
Kicking in the gutter  
Wishing I was lucky wishing I was lucky  
  
Its the only life I know  
  
My best friend wrote and told me so  
He said that there may be a job in the city yeah yeah yeah oh baby  
I like kicking in the gutter and wishing I was lucky  
Wishing I was lucky wishing I was lucky  
I like kicking in the gutter wishing I was lucky

Kicking in the gutter  
Wishing I was lucky wishing I was lucky
