I was heading for the mountains  
I had saved so much for you  
And in the town I left behind me  
There was nothing left to do  
  
I knew that you were waiting  
For me to share your life  
Cause I told you when I left that  
When I come back youll be my wife  
  
But someone was waiting  
In the shadows of the night  
Someone was waiting  
It just didnt feel right  
  
Danger on the track  
Something told me there were  
Strangers on my back  
And I was so right  
  
Maybe I should surrender  
Maybe I should give it up  
But the strength I had inside  
Told me you can never stop  
  
The men wanted to break me  
Steal and bring me down  
But I fought for you and later  
They were lying on the ground
