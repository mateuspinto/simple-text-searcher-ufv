Ive just seen a face  
I cant forget the time or place  
Where we just meet  
Shes just the girl for me  
And want all the world to see  
Weve met mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm  
  
Had it been another day  
I might have looked the other way  
And Id have never been aware  
But as it is Ill dream of her  
Tonight didididindi  
  
Falling yes I am falling  
And she keeps calling  
Me back again  
  
I have never known  
The like of this Ive been alone  
And I have missed things  
And kept out of sight  
But other girls were never quite  
Like this dadandadanda  
  
Falling yes I am falling  
And she keeps calling  
Me back again  
  
Falling yes I am falling  
And she keeps calling  
Me back again
