When the power chords come crashing down  
Go tearing through my senses  
Its for the strong not for the weak  
In light and dark dimension  
  
It stimulates regenerates  
Its therapeutic healing  
It lifts our feet up off the ground  
And blasts us through the ceiling  
  
Between the eyes  
I hear it screaming  
And it electrifies  
Your inner feelings  
  
Hot shock waves charge the air  
All heads are banging  
Fists pumping everywhere  
Guitars are cranking  
  
Heavy metal heavy metal  
What do you want  
Heavy metal heavy metal  
What do you want  
  
Ten thousands lights come blazing down  
With razor sharp precision  
The speakers pour out molten steel  
The beat gives double vision  
  
An armor plated raging beast  
Thats born of steel and leather  
It will survive against all odds  
Stampeding on forever  
  
Between the eyes  
I hear it screaming  
And it electrifies  
Your inner feelings  
  
Hot shock waves charge the air  
All heads are banging  
Fists pumping everywhere  
Guitars are cranking  
  
Heavy metal heavy metal  
What do you want  
Heavy metal heavy metal  
What do you want
