In a bar in Acuna called Ma Crosbys  
I found myself not feeling any pain  
I told a Frisco girl Id come for freedom  
She said shed only come to catch a train  
  
We struck up some idle conversation  
Traded all the troubles on our minds  
One thing led to another in the evening  
And I fell in love again for my last time  
  
Blame it on Mexico if you need a reason  
Say too much guitar music tequila salt and lime  
Blame it on Mexico but shes the reason  
That I fell in love again for my last time  
  
Daylight dawned and found me in Del Rio  
In a rundown motel room as dark as hell  
I felt all the pains of a morning after  
And all alone as far as I could tell  
  
Why she left I have no way of knowing  
I guess she caught her train and thats a crime  
She took everything I ever wanted  
And I fell in love again for my last time  
Blame it on Mexico if you need a reason  
Say too much guitar music tequila salt and lime  
Blame it on Mexico but shes the reason
