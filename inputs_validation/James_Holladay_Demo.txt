James Holladay was a working man  
He made his living on the land  
But living alone was too much to stand  
So Jim found a woman to understand  
  
Two years passed living in joy  
When out of the blue came a baby boy  
Just to keep up the family name  
Mister Holladay said well call him little James  
  
So you better run run run run Jim you gotta get away  
Jim you gotta get away  
You better better run run run run Jim you gotta get away  
Jim you gotta get away  
You better better run run run run Jim you gotta get away  
Jim you gotta get away Jim you gotta get away  
  
Little James became a working man  
He followed his pa right across the land  
At the end of the day when his work was done  
Hed sit and watch the setting southern sun  
  
Nineteen years had come and gone  
Little Jimmy had grown up big and strong  
He didnt know that his time had come  
When they handed him a shiny black gun  
  
So his pa said run run run run run run Jim you gotta get away  
Jim you gotta getaway  
So you better run run run run run run run Jim you gotta get away  
Jim you gotta get away  
So you better run run run run run Jim you gotta get away  
Jim you gotta get away Jim you gotta get away  
  
Run run run run run run Jim you gotta get away  
Jim you gotta getaway  
You better better run run run run run run Jim you gotta get away  
Jim you gotta get away  
You better better run run run run run run Jim you gotta get away  
Jim you gotta get away
