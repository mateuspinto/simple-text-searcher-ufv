In my dreams an old friend came to see you  
Right from the start he was the stealing kind  
Youll never know how much it hurt me darling  
The night you left his loving on your mind  
I keep dreaming of you all the time  
Then and only then youre really mine  
Theres sadness when you go away and I face another day  
Yet I keep dreaming of you all the time  
 fiddle   
Last night again I dreamed we were together  
I held you close the way I used to do  
I kissed your lips and said I found my heaven  
You whispered low how much you love me too  
I keep dreaming of you
