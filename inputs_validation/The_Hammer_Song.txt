I set out on monday  
The night was cold and vast  
And my brother slept  
  
And though I left quite quietly  
My father raged and raged  
And my mother wept  
  
Now my life was like a river  
All sucked into the ground  
And then the hammer came down  
Lord the hammer came down  
  
Many miles did I roam  
Through the ice and through the snow  
My horse died on the seventh day  
  
I stumbled into a city  
Where the people tried to kill me  
And I ran in shame  
  
Then I came upon a river  
And I laid my saddle down  
And then the hammer came down  
Lord the hammer came down  
It knocked me to the ground  
And I said Please please  
Take me back to my home town  
Lord the hammer came down  
  
Now Ive been made weak by visions  
Many visions did I see  
All through the night  
  
On the seventh hour an angel came  
With many snakes in all his hands  
And I fled in fright  
  
I pushed off into the river  
And the water came around  
And then the hammer came down  
Lord the hammer came down  
And it did not make a sound  
And I said Please please  
Take me back to my home ground  
Lord the hammer came down
