Three days of snow in a burnin hell  
Bet youre wonderin where I am  
Rang that number all night long  
Got no comfort on the telephone  
Went out and caught me a midnight flight  
Thought a little love would make it all alright  
But the landlord said you moved away and left me all of your bills to pay  
Look out baby I think you might have made your move too soon  
He left me with a Keno card livin in Vegas aint too hard  
I ran it up to about 50 grand counted it out and held it in my hand  
That kinda word will get around and make a lost love come up found  
I hear ya knockin baby at my door but you dont live here no more  
Oh no I think he made his move too soon  
Instrumental  
Ive been from Spain to Tokyo from Africa to Ohio  
I never try to make the news Im just a man who sings those low down blues  
Ill take my lovin everywhere I come back to know they still care  
One lover here one love behind one in my arms one on my mind  
One thing baby never make a move too soon  
Yeah baby never make your move too soon  
Well you can count on this baby we never make a move too soon  
Too soon
