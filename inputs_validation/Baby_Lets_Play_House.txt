You may go to college  
You may go to school  
You might drive a pink Cadillac  
But dont you be nobodys fool  
  
Come back baby Come back  
Come back baby Come back  
Come back baby I want to play house with you  
  
Listen to me baby  
What Im talking about  
Come on back me Little girl  
So we can play some house  
  
Come back baby Come back  
Come back baby gone  
Come back baby I want to play house with you  
  
Well theres just one thing baby  
That I want you to know  
Come on back we can play a little house  
And we act like we did before  
  
Come back baby Come back  
Come back baby Come back  
Come back baby I want to play house with you  
  
Listen to me baby  
Try to understand  
I rather see you dead little girl  
Than see you with another man  
  
Come back baby Come back  
Come back baby Come back  
Come back baby I want to play house with you
