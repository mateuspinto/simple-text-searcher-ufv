We live in a free world  
I whistle down the wind  
Carry on smiling  
And the world will smile with you  
Life is a flower  
So precious in your hand  
Carry on smiling  
And the world will smile with you  
  
When every race is run  
And the day is closing in  
I dont care about the world  
Im living for the light  
Dont cry for me today ah ah ah  
  
We live in a free world  
I whistle down the wind  
  
I can not be your judge  
Mr Jailer is your host  
Hes keeping you inside  
And hides you from the world  
No catcher in the rye  
Can help you from yourself  
  
We live in a free world  
I whistle down the wind  
  
Please Mr Agony  
Release them for a while  
earn them the consequences of  
Living without life  
  
We live in a free world
