My lips are shakin my nails are bit off Been a month since I heard myself
talk  
All the advantage this lifes got on me Picture a cup in the middle of the
sea  
And I fight back in my mind  
Never lets be right  
I got memories I got shit  
So much it dont show  
  
  
I walked in light when you held me in that night  
I walked the line when you held my hand that night  
  
  
An empty shell seems so easy to crack  
Got all these questions dont know who I could even ask  
So Ill just lie alone and wait for the dream where Im not ugly and youre
lookin at me  
And I stay in bed all blue Ive seen hell  
If just once I could feel love stare back at me  
But I walked in light when you held me in that night  
I walked the line when you held my hand that night  
I walked in light when you held me close that night  
I paid the price never held you in real life  
my lips are shakin
