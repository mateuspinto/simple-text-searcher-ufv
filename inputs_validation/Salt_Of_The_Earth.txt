Lets drink to the hard working people  
Lets drink to the lowly of birth  
Raise your glass to the good and the evil  
Lets drink to the salt of the earth  
  
Say a prayer for the common foot soldier  
Spare a thought for his back breaking work  
Say a prayer for his wife and his children  
Who burn the fires and who still till the earth  
  
And when I search a faceless crowd  
A swirling mass of gray and black and white  
They dont look real to me  
In fact they look so strange  
  
Raise your glass to the hard working people  
Lets drink to the uncounted heads  
Lets think of the wandering millions  
Who need leaders but get gamblers instead  
  
Spare a thought for the stay at home voter  
His empty eyes gaze at strange beauty shows  
And a parade of the gray suited grafters  
A choice of cancer or polio  
  
And when I search a faceless crowd  
A swirling mass of gray and black and white  
They dont look real to me  
In fact they look so strange  
  
Lets drink to the hard working people  
Lets think of the lowly of birth  
Spare a thought for the rag taggy people  
Sets drink to the salt of the earth  
  
Lets drink to the hard working people  
Lets drink to the salt of the earth  
Lets think of the two thousand million  
Lets think of the humble of birth
