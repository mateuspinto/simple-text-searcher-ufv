Heartbeat way down on Cove Street  
Playing to lady luck awaiting that tender touch  
Fantasy is the trick of the dance you see  
Hiding that need for love and wanting you close to me  
  
Oh that one sweet and tender touch  
Thats what Im missing and need so much  
One sweet and tender touch  
  
Bright light  
Pretty colors that shine on all through the night  
I dont need them not half as much  
As Im wanting your tender touch  
And loneliness makes the strongest heart a wilderness  
Thats wilder than you see is wanting you close to me  
  
For that one sweet and tender touch  
Thats what Im missing and need so much  
One sweet and tender touch
