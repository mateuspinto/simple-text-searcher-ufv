All my rowdy friends have settled down and it seems to be more in the laid
back songs  
Nobody wants to get drunk and get loud Everybody just wants to go back home  
I myself have seen my wilder days and I have seen my name at the top of the
page  
But I need to find a friend just to run around But no one wants to get high
on the town  
And all my rowdy friends have settled down  
  
And I think I know what my father meant when he sang about a lost highway and
old George Jones Im glad to see hes finally getting straight  
And Waylon staying home and loving Jesse more these days  
And nobody wants to get drunk and get loud and all my rowdy friends have
settled down  
  
And the hang overs hurt more then they used to and corn bread and ice tea took
the place of pills and ninetyproof  
And it seems like none of us do things quite like we used to do  
And nobody wants to get high on the town and all my rowdy friends have settled
down  
  
Yeah I think I know what my father meant when he sang about his lost highway
and Johnny Cash dont act like he did back in 68  
And Kriss he is a movie star and hes moved off to L A  
And nobody wants to get drunk and get loud and all my rowdy friends have
settled down  
  
Yeah me and my rowdy friends have rowdied on down
