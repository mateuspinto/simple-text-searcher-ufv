You say youre not gonna fight  
Cause no one will fight for you  
And you think theres not enough love  
And no one to give it to  
And youre sure youve hurt for so long  
Youve got nothing left to lose  
So you say youre not gonna fight  
Cause no one will fight for you  
  
You say the weight of the world  
Has kept you from letting go  
And you think compassions a flaw  
And youll never let it show  
And youre sure youve hurt in a way  
That no one will ever know  
  
But someday the weight of the world  
Will give you the strength to go  
  
Hold on the weight of the world  
Will give you the strength to go  
So hold on the weight of the world  
Will give you the strength to go  
So hold on the weight of the world  
Will give you the strength to go  
Just hold on the weight of the world  
Will give you the strength to go
