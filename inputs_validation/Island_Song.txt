Can anybody here pass me a beer  
And Ima keep playing this music that you hear  
And if you know the song  
Then come and sing along with me  
  
Walking with the beach to my left  
Sea to my right  
And Ima get faded at the Tiki bar tonight  
Then Ima roll one up  
Like my name is Bob  
Yeah Im gonna party like Im a Jamaican  
  
If you really wanna know where you can find me  
Ill be unwinding  
Down in the islands down in the islands  
You should lose track of your timing  
Grab a drink beside me  
Down in the islands down in the islands  
  
Can anybody here pass me the rum  
And we can find somebody who can play the steel drums  
And if you like this beat then everybody dance with me  
We got the ladies to the left  
Fellas to the right  
And everybodys faded at the Tiki bar tonight  
And we are gonna dance to the rhythm of the waves  
While we drink Bacardi by the bonfire flames  
  
If you really wanna know where you can find me  
Ill be unwinding  
Down in the islands down in the islands  
You should lose track of your timing  
Grab a drink beside me  
Down in the islands down in the islands  
  
You dont need no invitation no whoa  
If youre looking for relaxation  
Get away get away with me  
Make your destination my location  
  
If you really wanna know where you can find me  
Ill be unwinding  
Down in the islands down in the islands  
You should lose track of your timing  
Grab a drink beside me  
Down in the islands down in the islands  
  
If you really wanna know where you can find me  
Ill be unwinding down down down down  
Down in the islands down in the islands  
You should lose track of your timing  
Grab a drink beside me  
Down in the islands down in the islands
