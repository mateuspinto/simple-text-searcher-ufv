It is a dance we do in silence  
Far below this morning sun  
You in your life me in mine  
We have begun  
Here we stand and without speaking  
Draw the water from the well  
And stare beyond the plains  
To where the mountains lie so still  
  
But its a long way that I have come  
Across the sand to find this peace  
Among your people in the sun  
Where the families work the land  
As they have always done  
Oh its so far the other way  
My countrys gone  
  
Across my home has grown the shadow  
Of a cruel and senseless hand  
Though in some strong hearts  
The love and truth remain  
And it has taken me this distance  
And a womans smile to learn  
That my heart remains among them  
And to them I must return  
  
But its a long way that I have come  
Across the sand to find you here  
Among these people in the sun  
Where your children will be born  
Youll watch them as they run  
Oh its so far the other way  
My life has gone  
  
If you look for me Maria  
You will find me in the shade  
Wide awake or in a dream  
Its hard to tell  
If you come to me Maria  
I will show you what Ive made  
Its a picture for our lady of the well
