So staring at the wall  
Feeling ten feet small  
Its like the world is on your shoulders  
Now nothings making sense  
You just wanna quit  
You runaway but you just dont know  
How to feel what is real  
Youre not alone  
  
Chorus  
Everybody falls everybody cries  
Everybody feels like a nobody sometimes  
You get up again give it one more try  
Everybodys got what it takes on the inside  
Story of your life story of your life  
Its the story of my life  
  
Then sometimes you got to crawl  
Before you start to walk  
Ill be there  
Ive had my rainy days  
You try to keep up a smile  
You go the extra mile  
You run the race no matter where your place  
You know which way to go so turn the page  
  
Chorus  
Everybody falls everybody cries  
Everybody feels like a nobody sometimes  
You get up again give it one more try  
Everybodys got what it takes on the inside  
Story of your life story of your life  
Its the story of my life  
  
Its hard to be strong  
No right seems wrong  
And nobody hears what you say  
So dont be afraid  
Hold on to your faith  
I swear to you there will be better days  
  
So staring at the wall  
Feeling ten feet small  
Its like the world is on your shoulders  
  
Chorus  
Everybody falls everybody cries  
Everybody feels like a nobody sometimes  
You get up again give it one more try  
Everybodys got what it takes on the inside  
  
Everybody falls Everybody falls everybody cries everybody cries  
Everybody feels like a nobody sometimes  
You get up again give it one more try  
Everybodys got what it takes on the inside  
Story of your life story of your life  
Its the story of my life
