Once again to strive to beat it out  
Over and over again  
So worn worked over  
With the intention to kill  
To watch him die and smile  
At his dismay  
His pain  
My deliverance  
My cleanliness a gift of freedom  
My walk purified  
My peace given by God  
  
What else is there  
After slipping away  
When every thing is silent  
And nothing else is around  
Alone  
Looking deep inside  
Hearing the echo of my soul  
No one can know  
  
In these times of silence  
These times of separation  
I find there is a void that rises up  
A peace that brings my tears  
A comfort that no one else can offer  
  
So why do people run away  
Why do they look elsewhere  
And base their self on opinions  
When the truth is so evident that this God of  
Love is so constant  
Destruction and storms  
My Jesus stands to help
