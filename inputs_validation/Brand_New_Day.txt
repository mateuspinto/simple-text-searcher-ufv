When all the dark clouds roll away  
And the sun begins to shine  
I see my freedom from across the way  
And it comes right in on time  
Well it shines so bright and it gives so much light  
And it comes from the sky above  
Makes me feel so free makes me feel like me  
And lights my life with love  
  
Chorus  
And it seems like and it feels like  
And it seems like yes it feels like  
A brand new day yeah  
A brand new day oh  
  
I was lost and double crossed  
With my hands behind my back  
I was longtime hurt and thrown in the dirt  
Shoved out on the railroad track  
Ive been used abused and so confused  
And I had nowhere to run  
But I stood and looked  
And my eyes got hooked  
On that beautiful morning sun  
  
Chorus  
  
And the sun shines down all on the ground  
Yeah and the grass is oh so green  
And my heart is still and Ive got the will  
And I dont really feel so mean  
Here it comes here it comes  
0 here it comes right now  
And it comes right in on time  
Well it eases me and it pleases me  
And it satisfies my mind  
  
Chorus
