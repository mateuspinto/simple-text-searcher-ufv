Its in the order of their hedgerows  
Its in the way their curtains open and close  
Its in the look they give you down their nose  
All part of decencys jigsaw I suppose  
  
Heard the neighbor slam his car door  
Dont he realize this is respectable street  
What dyou think he bought that car for  
Cause he realize this is respectable street  
  
Now they talk about abortion  
In cosmopolitan proportions to their daughters  
As they speak of contraception  
And immaculate receptions on their portable  
Sony entertainment centers  
  
Now she speaks about diseases  
And which sex position pleases best her old man  
Avon lady fills the creases  
When she manages to squeeze in past the caravans  
That never move from their front gardens  
  
Its in the order of their hedgerows  
Its in the way their curtains open and close  
Its in the look they give you down their nose  
All part of decencys jigsaw I suppose  
Sunday church and they look fetching  
Saturday night saw him retching over our fence  
Bang the wall for me to turn down  
I can see them with their stern frown  
As they dispense the kind of look that says  
Theyre perfect
