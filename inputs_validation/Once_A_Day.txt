When you found somebody new I thought I never would  
Forget you for I thought then I never could  
But time has taken all the pains away  
Until now Im down to hurtin once a day  
Once a day all day long and once a night from dusk till dawn  
The only time I wish you werent gone is once a day every day all day long  
 piano   
Im so glad that Im not like a girl I knew one time  
She lost the one she loved then slowly lost her mind  
She sat around and cried her life away  
Oh lucky me Im only cryin once a day  
Once a day all day long  
Once a day every day all day long
