Drums of the islands youre beating in my heart  
Youre with me no matter where I roam  
If ever I wander if ever were apart  
I know that you will lead me home  
If I should journey across the deep blue sea  
Ill never forget these coral shores  
Drums of the islands I hear you calling me  
And Ill return forever yours  
I love each valley each grain of sand each hill  
The flowers the music of the isles  
These are the things I love and always will  
Though I may roam ten thousand miles
