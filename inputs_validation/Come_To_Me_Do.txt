Come to me lonely  
Come to me blue  
Come to me weary  
Come to me do  
Yeah yeah  
  
I will refresh you  
Come to me do  
Come to me often  
Ill come to you  
Ill come to you  
  
Always in my heart  
Always a song  
This is the good part  
Youll always know where you belong  
  
Come to me darling  
Ooh baby  
Come to me darling  
  
Come to me happy  
Come to me bad  
Come to me looking  
What you aint had  
  
I will sustain you  
Come to me do  
Come to me often  
I come to you  
I come to you  
  
You are the kind one  
Ive waited so long  
How does one find one  
You always know where you belong  
  
Come to me darling  
Ooh ooh baby  
Come to me darling  
  
Come to me darling  
Come to me darling  
Come to me darling
