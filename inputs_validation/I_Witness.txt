Across the desert of the burning dark a  
Darkness which illuminates you  
Theres a place youve always wanted to be  
Whose pleasures always did escape you  
Its always been so out of reach nothing so near  
Ever felt so far  
And now its here within your grasp a never  
Ending burning says it all  
  
Chorus  
As you drive into the darkness in front the future  
Behind you history  
Caught alone in the dark night do you think  
Thats the way its supposed to be  
You dont believe your eyes cos all they see is  
Lies oh yeah  
  
You better run from the holy man the eyes that  
Will are set uppon you  
Listen not to verse and prayer song that thrill  
And voices tempt you  
The inner flame has fear of death never has  
Light ever seemed so dark  
Pilgrims of sabbocracy hear the hounds of  
Heaven as they bark  
  
Chorus  
  
I witness a time and a place that never dies still  
Frozen in time  
This darkness the only place that I can hide i  
Witness a dream  
  
Chorus  
  
I witness a time and a place that never dies still  
Frozen in time  
This darkness the only place that I can hide i  
Witness a dream  
Oh just a dream
