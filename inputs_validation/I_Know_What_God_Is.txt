I have heard the wild birds sing  
So I know what freedom is  
I have looked into the eyes of a child  
So I know what faith is  
I have seen a rainbow  
So I know what beauty is  
I have planted a tree  
So I know what hope is  
I have held a helping hand  
So I know what kindness is  
I have seen a blossom burst into bloom  
So I know what glory is  
I have lost a friend  
So I know what sorrow is  
I have knelt down in prayer  
So I know what peace is  
I have seen a mother at her crib  
So Im sure of the meaning of love  
I have seen and I have felt these things  
And now I know what God is
