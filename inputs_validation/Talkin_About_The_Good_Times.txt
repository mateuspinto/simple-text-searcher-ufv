Talkin about the good times  
Talkin about the good times  
  
She had sun in her face  
Her lips kiss the sun  
Arrest the sun  
Fields of light we found the place  
  
She had sun in her eyes  
The clouds crossed the sun  
Without the sun  
This evening shadows in her eyes  
  
Talkin about the good times  
Talkin about the good  
Talkin about the good times  
Talkin about the good times  
  
She had breaded her hair  
The grass jumped through the rain  
Reach to the rain  
Tears of mystic rain in the air  
  
She had tears in her eyes  
The skies turned to gray  
Melt away  
Shining streaks in rain that day  
  
Talkin about the good times  
Talkin about the good  
Talkin about the good times  
Talkin about the good times  
  
Good times  
Good times  
Good times  
Good times  
Good times
