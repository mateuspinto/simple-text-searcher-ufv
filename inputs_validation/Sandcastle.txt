I have always dreamed of this day  
The whole world at my feet  
And fame within my reach  
Friends I have a plenty  
But when the lights down low  
And nowhere to go  
Theres no one there but me  
  
Time flies and all things  
Must come to an end  
Like the sandcastles  
Slowly being swept away  
By the incoming tide  
All that is left are traces of what  
I used to be  
  
Today I have to let go  
And all will be forgotten  
But after everythings  
Been said and done  
And knowing that I once had  
You in my life  
And memories of what I used to be  
Are traces that will remind you of me
