Dull dull grey  
The colour of our times  
Cool cool space  
That I still hope to find  
Far beyond the veil  
The sound of whispers and moans  
  
Slow time bomb  
The clamour of the street  
I hear this town  
It never goes to sleep  
And I will catch the taxi driver  
Weeping like a wounded beast  
  
Then I wake up in your room  
To share one piece of your life  
When tomorrow comes we may not be here at all  
Without your whispers and moans  
Cause here you come to carry me home  
Here you come to carry me home  
  
Love that sound  
Time erase  
Tension wheels  
Cool heels  
Wont ya come on open the bid fore too long  
  
Then I wake up in your room  
To share one piece of your life  
Id give anything to be a fly upon the wall  
And hear your whispers and moans  
Id like to hear your whispers and moans  
Here you come to carry me  
  
We are the mirrors  
Are the mirrors of each other in a lifetime of suspicion  
Cleansed in a moment of recognition  
You gave your life for it  
Worth its weight in gold  
And growing empires and art collectors  
And Alans sound investments  
Will one day be forgotten  
One day be forgotten yeah
