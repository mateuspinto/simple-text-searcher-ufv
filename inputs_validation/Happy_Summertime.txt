Happy summertime Niggas ahh yeah  
We rolling Repeat x4  
Drop up in the summer time  
And we rolling through the block with the sun shining and I  
Just wanna ride I just wanna ride  
Go to the mall and I hit the gym  
And have a pool party gets some chicks all swim I  
I just wanna ride I just wanna ride  
  
Sun shining like California  
Come here girl let me push up on ya  
Can we do how we do in a china hard day  
Full of  club thus is Friday  
Lets drink and hit the dance floor  
DJ put the summer jam on  
Big chips at the bar spending  
GT with the wheels spinning  
Lets get somewhere and get high  
For the rest of the night  
Sex and then gone get a bite  
Oh take with a thug baby and if you want it if you want it  
You can get it pumping  
  
And we rolling through the block  
With on the block with the beat making it hot for you

When youre head turns
