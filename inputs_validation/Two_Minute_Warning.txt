Were lying by the orange sky  
Two million miles across the land  
Scattered to the highest high  
Expect theyll either laugh or cry  
No sex no consequence no sympathy  
Youre good enough to heat  
  
Two minute warning  
Two minutes later  
When time has come  
My days are numbered  
  
The dawning of another year  
Marks time for those who understand  
One in four still here  
While you and I go hand in hand  
No radio no sound no sin no sanctuary  
So welcome to your last  
  
The sun the solitude the cemetery  
So welcome to your last
