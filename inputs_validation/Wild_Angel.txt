Written by John Mellencamp  
  
Pretty girls in beat up cars  
Throwing kisses to the soldiers  
Pale blue eyes and whisky bars  
The lines on her face say shes getting older  
Girl you better reach out to me  
  
Runnin with your  
Weakness in the dark  
You hope it disappears by tomorrow  
On your knees and in the dark  
Dont wanna beg  
Lord knows youre too old to borrow  
You better reach out to me  
Girl you better reach out to me  
  
Chorus  
Cause youre a oh oh oh oh wild angel  
Oh oh oh oh a wild angel  
  
Cabin fever nearly drove us insane  
When the snow fell on us last December  
Look at me girl I dont feel the same  
Now those days theyve all gone together  
You better reach out to me  
Girl you better reach out to me  
  
Chorus
