 in these crazy times  
How very sweet to know  
Our love is like the love of long ago     
In these crazy times  
When life is wild and strange  
Our feelings for each other never change      
Old things make way for new things  
Yet we still cling to the true things  
We will always be ruled by the heart  
In these crazy times  
When rockets fly in space  
When quick success is all theyre dreaming of  
How blessed we are with our love  
 old things make way for new things  
Yet we still cling to the true things      
We will always be ruled by the heart  
In these crazy times  
When rockets fly in space  
When quick success is all theyre dreaming of  
How blessed we are with our love  
 in these crazy crazy times
