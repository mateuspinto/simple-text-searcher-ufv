All last night we lay in bed making love  
I never felt so much before with anyone  
Never had to say a word  
It was all right there  
The warmth inside us flamed and circled everywhere  
  
And if I never have another love  
Well at least I had last night  
Now I know how the feeling grows  
Cause you made me come alive  
  
Chorus  
Ill never get enough never get enough  
Never get enough of you  
Ill never get enough never get enough  
Never get enough of you  
I only want to give you more  
  
Now youre gone Im all alone just lying here  
Waiting for the moment when Ill feel you near  
Never asked if youd come back  
I was too damn proud  
I just smile and touched your hair  
As you went out  
  
Chorus
