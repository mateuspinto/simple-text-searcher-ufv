Zingara why do they speak your name  
Whisper like a class  
Why do you walk in empty shoes  
Through long and lonely dusk  
Why do you sleep with strangeness  
Dream of bitter rage  
Sing your song in the mirror  
Like a bird outside a cage  
Yea yea  
  
The land lies large unwinding  
Freezing from the miles  
But colder still are the home fires  
The ashes of the wild  
Down the road down you fly  
Never a heart to stay  
A lost guitar in fields afar  
Ever hell to pay  
  
Strangers are eyes oh oh  
  
Down down down down Corduroy Road  
Down down down down  
Down down down down Corduroy Road  
Down down down down  
  
Zingara why do they speak your name  
Whisper like a cuss  
Why do you walk in empty shoes  
In long and lonely dusk  
  
Strangers are eyes oh oh  
  
Down down down down Corduroy Road  
Down down down down  
Down down down down Corduroy Road  
Down down down down  
  
Down down down down Corduroy Road
