I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land  
I yelled down to Captain Arab Ill have ya understand  
Who came running to the deck and said Boys Forget the whale   
Were goin over yonder Cut the engines Change the sails  
Haul on that bowline we sang that melody  
Like all tough sailors do when theyre far away at sea  
  
I think Ill call it America I said as we hit land  
I took a deep breath I fell down I could not stand  
Captain Arab he starting writing out some deeds  
And said Lets build us a fort and start buying the place with beads  
Just then a cop come down the street crazy as a loon  
And throws us all in jail for carryin harpoons  
  
Aw me I busted out  dont even ask me how  
I went lookin for some help I walked past a Guernsey cow  
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums  
Where people carried signs around sayin BAN THE BUMS  
I jumped right in line sayin I hope that Im not late  
When I realized I hadnt eaten for five days straight  
  
I went into a restaurant lookin for the cook   
I told him I was the editor of a famous etiquette book  
The waiter he was handsome and he wore a powder blue cape  
I ordered up some Suzette I said Could you please make that crepe  
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat   
Food was flyin everywhere  I left without my hat  
  
I didnt mean to be nosy so I went into a bank  
To try to get some bail for the boys back in the tank  
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants  
They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France  
Who invited me to her place I went but she had a friend  
Who knocked me out an robbed my boots an was I on the street again  
  
I went up to a big house with a US flag upon display  
I said Can you please help me out I got some friends down the way  
The man said Get out of here or Ill tear you limb from limb  
I said You know they refused Jesus too He said Youre not him  
Get out of here before I break your bones Im not your pop  
I decided to have him arrested and went looking for a cop  
  
I ran back outside and got into a cab  
I ran out the other door  this English man said Fab  
As he saw me leap a hot dog stand and a chariot that stood  
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood  
I ran right through the door like a hobo sailor does  
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was  
I repeated that all my friends were in jail with a sigh  
He gave me his card and said Call me if they die  
I shook his hand and said goodbye and went back out on the street  
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet  
A pay phone was ringin  and it just about blew my mind   
When I picked it up an said hello this foot came through the line  
  
Well about this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab  
At gettin any help for my friends and Captain Arab  
I needed a coin to flip like either heads or tails  
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail  
So I hocked my sailors suit an I got a coin to flip  
It came up tails it rhymed with sails so I made it back to the ship  
  
Well I got back and took the parking ticket off the mast  
I was ripping it to shreds when this Coast Guard boat went past  
They asked me my name and I said Captain Kidd  
They believed me but they wanted to know exactly what I did  
I said For the Pope of Eyruke I was employed  
They let me go right away they were very paranoid  
  
Well the last I heard of Arab he was stuck on the side of a whale  
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail  
But the funniest thing was  as I was leavin the bay   
I saw three ships sailing and they were all headed my way  
So I asked the Captain what his name was an how come he didnt drive a
truck  
He said his name was Columbus an I just said Good luck
