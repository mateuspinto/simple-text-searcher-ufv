May each day in the week be a good day  
May the Lord always watch over you  
And may all of your hopes turn to wishes  
And may all of your wishes come true  
  
May each day in the month be a good day  
May you make friends with each one you meet  
And may all of your daydreams be memries  
And may all of your memries be sweet  
  
The weeks turn to months and the months into years  
Therell be sadness and joy therell be laughter and tears  
But one thing I pray to heaven above  
May each of your days be a day full of love  
  
May each day in the year be a good day  
May each dawn find you happy and gay  
And may all of your days be as lovely  
As the one you shared with me today  
  
May each day of your life be a good day  
And good night
