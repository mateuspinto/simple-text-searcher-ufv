Bound up in this energy ball again  
Laughing and bouncin off the magic  
Rollin under like a surfboard in a wave  
Washin me up I want to do it again  
  
Entwined in her arms  
Spinning around and submarine beneath the deep of her  
Climbing the forks of the lightning  
Building a rod for my back its all right its all right  
  
Dreamin a dream that only the sleepless know  
Chilling the afternoon in Viva Vida  
Watchin the sun slide down the avenue  
So real  
  
I feel  
Dizzy to fever with this love  
The blues and the greys are waved away inside a day with her  
Riding the forks of the lightning  
Feeling the sparks along my back its all right its all right  
  
I thought I was born to take and to damage  
But Im giving and healing and feeling  
Ultramarine and ultraserene  
Climbing the forks of the lightning  
She told me today itll be okay its all right its all right  
  
Im a submarine in this ocean
