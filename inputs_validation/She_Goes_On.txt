Pretty soon youll be able to remember her  
Lying in the garden singing  
Right where shell always be  
The door is always open  
  
This is the place that I loved her  
And these are the friends that she had  
Long may the mountain ring  
To the sound of her laughter  
And she goes on and on  
  
In her soft wind I will whisper  
In her warm sun I will glisten  
Till we see her once again  
In a world without end  
  
We owe it all to Frank Sinatra  
The song was playing as she walked into the room  
After the long weekend  
They were a lifetime together  
  
Appearing in the eyes of children  
In the clear blue mountain view  
Were coloring in the sky  
And painting ladders to heaven  
And she goes on and on  
  
In her soft wind I will whisper  
In her warm sun I will glisten  
Till we see her once again  
In a world without end  
  
In her soft wind I will whisper  
In her warm sun I will glisten  
And I always will remember  
In a world without end  
  
She goes on  
She goes on  
  
She goes on
