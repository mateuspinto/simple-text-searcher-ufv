Electric eel  
Swimming through the seas of the unreal  
Trying to land a deal for you to reinvent the wheel  
Electric eel  
  
Electric eye  
Pull the plug watch him die  
I did not even cry I guess you know the reasons why  
Electric eye  
  
Was I supposed to go down with the ship  
I was not the captain it was not my trip  
Sailing to the moon with Aliice the goon  
Oh yeah  
  
Im Popeye the sailor man  
I live in a garbage can  
Oh maybe you got it take it away
