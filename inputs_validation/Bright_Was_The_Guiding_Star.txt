Bright was the guiding star that led  
With mild benignant ray  
The Gentiles to the lowly shed  
Where the Redeemer lay  
  
But lo a brighter clearer light  
Now points to His abode  
It shines through sin and sorrows night  
To guide us to our God  
  
Oh haste to follow where it leads  
The gracious call obey  
Be rugged wilds or flowery meads  
The Christians destined way  
  
Oh gladly tread the narrow path  
While light and grace are given  
Who meekly follow Christ on earth  
Shall reign with Him in Heaven
