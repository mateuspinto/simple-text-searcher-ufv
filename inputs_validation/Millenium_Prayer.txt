Our Father who art in heaven  
Hallowed be thy name  
Thy Kingdom come Thy will be done  
On earth as in heaven  
Give us today our daily bread  
And forgive our sins  
As we forgive each one of those  
Who sins against us  
And lead us not to the time of trial  
But deliver us from evil  
For Thine is the kingdom  
The power and the glory
