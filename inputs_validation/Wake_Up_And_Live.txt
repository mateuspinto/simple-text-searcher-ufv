Wake up and live  
Wake up and live your life see what there is to see  
I wont sit around all day cause life means more to me  
Wake up and live  
So many kids content to sleep their lives away  
But Im gona try to make the most out of this day  
Wake up and live  
It takes some motivation It takes some love for life  
Why just sit complacent and let life pass you by  
Boredom is a choice I choose not to make  
Unlock that door strive for more  
Theres a better path to take  
WAKE UP AND LIVE breath every breath  
WAKE UP AND LIVE until my death  
WAKE UP AND LIVE so much to do  
WAKE UP AND LIVE all of you  
Cmon open your eyes
