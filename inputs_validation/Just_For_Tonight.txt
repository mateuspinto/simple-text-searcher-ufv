Its hard to realize we said our last goodbyes  
Where could the dream have gone to  
Now I know theres no way that I can make you stay  
No matter how I want to  
  
We made some memories that my heart will always treasure  
Before you close the door lets make one more  
  
Baby just for tonight let me give myself to you  
And all I ask is just for tonight love me like you used to do  
And I promise that I wont cry I wont ask you why  
I wont even try to change your feelings  
If you just hold me tight just once more just for tonight  
  
I thought the love wed found  
Was built on solid ground  
And it would just grow stronger  
Crazy as it may seem  
I need to dream that dream  
For just just a little longer  
  
So for the sake of all that magic we made together  
Open your heart to mine just one more time  
  
Baby just for tonight let me give myself to you  
And all I ask is just for tonight love me like you used to do  
And I promise that I wont cry I wont ask you why  
I wont even try to change your feelings  
If you just hold me tight just once more just for tonight  
  
All I want is one more night  
So why dont you come to me let me dream  
This night means everything to me  
All I ask is for tonight  
Baby just hold me tight  
Come to me let me dream  
This night means everything to me
