Holy words long preserved  
For our walk in this world  
They resound with Gods own heart  
Oh let the Ancient words impart  
  
Words of Life words of Hope  
Give us strength help me cope  
In this world where eer we roam  
Ancient words will guide us Home  
  
Chorus  
Ancient words ever true  
Changing me and changing you  
We have come with open hearts  
Oh let the ancient words impart  
  
Holy words of our Faith  
Handed down to this age  
Came to us through sacrifice  
Oh heed the faithful words of Christ  
  
Holy words long preserved  
For our walk in this world  
They resound with Gods own heart  
Oh let the ancient words impart  
  
ChorusRepeat x4  
  
We have come with open hearts  
Oh let the ancient words impart
