Feel the calling of a miracle  
In the presence of the word  
Now we hold the right to rearrange  
How the stories can be heard  
  
In the beginning is the future  
And the future is at hand  
Ill be calling voices of Africa  
Be the rhythm to the plan  
  
From the Congo to Lenasia  
Be the writing on the wall  
Ill be calling the colors of India  
See the Asian life explode  
  
Chorus  
Head into the headlight  
Dont turn from the rain  
Theres a fire raging somewhere near  
like a longtime friend whos  
Seen it darker than ebony  
Take off on the turnpike  
Asking for the first call  
Give me more of the same  
Asking for a song  
Theres a fire burning in my heart again  
  
Ill be calling the dragons of China  
See the dancers of the Nile  
See the wings of change are on display  
This revelation mine  
  
Feel the calling of the miracle  
In the presence of the word  
  
Chorus  
  
Feel the calling of a miracle  
The revelation mine
