In the space of the beginning  
Was the living Word of Light  
When this Word was clearly spoken  
All that came to be was right  
All creation had a language  
Words to say what must be said  
All day long the heavens whispered  
Signing words in scarlet red  
  
Some failed to understand it  
So God spoke His final Word  
On a silent night in Judahs  
Hills a babys cry was heard  
  
Glory sang the angel chorus  
Glory echoed back the night  
Love has come to walk among us  
Christ the Lord is born this night  
  
All creation sing His praises  
Earth and heaven praise His name  
All who live come join the chorus  
Find the words His love proclaim  
  
Find the words His love proclaim
