Overflowing senses  
Heightened awareness  
I hear my blood flow  
I feel its caress  
Whispering cosmos  
Talking right to me  
Unlimited endless  
God breathing through me  
  
See the microcosm  
In macro vision  
Our bodies moving  
With pure precision  
One universal celebration  
One evolution  
One creation  
  
Thundering rhythm  
Pounding within me  
Driving me onwards  
Forcing me to see  
Clear and enlightening  
Right there before me  
Brilliantly shining  
Intricate beauty  
  
See the microcosm  
In macro vision  
Our bodies moving  
With pure precision  
One universal celebration  
One evolution  
One creation
