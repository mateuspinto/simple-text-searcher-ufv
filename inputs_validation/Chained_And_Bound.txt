Darling now you made me change my mind  
Can go no further because you got me chained and bound oh  
Taller than the tallest sky  
Sweeter than a grape on a vine now  
Can go no further because you got me chained and bound right now now  
  
So glad Im so glad Im so glad  
Oh I dont have to worry no more  
Oh my my my  
Baby somebody somebody  
  
What kind of life is this kind Im trying living  
Oh Lord what kind of love is she trying to give me  
I feel like Im standing up and telling the word  
Im chained to your love  
  
Darling oh  
Dont break this little heart of mine  
Theres no greater love than this love of yours and mine oh  
You walk with your head in the sky  
Darling dont ever pass me by  
I aint going no further because you got me chained and bound oh now  
  
So glad Im so glad Im so glad
