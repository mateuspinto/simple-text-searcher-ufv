Wished I was a giant said  
Man get off the street  
Spoken like a traffic cop  
Cronies at his feet  
Turned on his radio and picked up the noise  
Age rules with reason  
and whos to disagree  
Not Mr Spit with his abrupt delivery  
And Mr Intelligent is just a wannabe like me  
And who makes the breakfast  
And who gasses the truck  
The same little bee that stung the bull  
And caused the bull to buck  
Only a matter of time before we have to pay  
If you were 10 years younger  
And I was a sunbeam  
Wished I Was A Giant said  
Man its just a dream  
Only a matter of time before we have to pay
