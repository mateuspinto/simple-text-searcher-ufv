Lead vocal marti webb  
  
This golden day will be mine  
For every moment in time  
If time should lose her way  
  
A symphony in the night  
Of stars that dance in the light  
And music far away  
  
They say that love is but a dance  
Dont let the music fade away  
Dont let the moment pass  
  
Without reason or rhyme  
The sweet bouquet of the wine  
Will vanish in the air  
  
The innocence of the rose  
She leaves where she goes  
For all the world to share  
  
Some days when clouds are drifting by  
I open my eyes and watch them go  
And wonder where they fly  
  
Some nights orion runs too fast  
I look to the stars as if to say  
Dont let the moment pass  
  
But soon a golden age is past  
Just when it seemed that miracles  
Where not too much to ask  
  
And though the world may turn too fast  
If it should seem like paradise  
Dont let the moment pass
