How long have I been watching from my window Running through my life  
Watching it all go by Seems like Ive always got a destination  
Running down the time Pushing to the front of the line  
I want to be where the snow is falling Voices of friends like angels calling  
  
Out in the pines  oh beautiful tree  
I want to be there where Christmas waits for me  
Christmas waits Gather round the fire let the weather rage outside  
Christmas waits I always will be welcome for the rest of my life Christmas
waits
