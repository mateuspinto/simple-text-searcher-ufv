Light tracers follow me farther  
Into the depths of unknown  
The blackness surrounding the border of hope  
Were alone  
  
We plead for the signs of a second chance  
In hopes it will stifle the fear  
The dying remains of a world gone insane  
We are near the end  
  
A course that will lead us through darkness  
Prepared by our leaders insist  
We mustnt all pray to the shadow of  
The iron fist  
We enter the void with our eyes straight ahead  
The force all around us we feel  
The twisted contusions of hatred will finally reveal  
  
Enforcer  
Master of nations revealed  
Enforcer  
The beams from his soul you will feel  
  
Slicing and tearing our way to the gate  
A towering fortress of blackened steel  
Desolate plains holding dying remains  
Heed the call of the master well soar to  
The edges of time  
  
Light tracers follow me farther  
Into the depths of unknown  
The blackness surrounding the borders of hope  
Were alone  
We plead for the signs give us a second chance  
In hopes it will stifle the fear  
The battered remains of world gone insane  
We are near  
  
Once long ago we had to hide  
In the shadows of the land  
To keep us away from the crawl  
Enforcers taking hold of us
