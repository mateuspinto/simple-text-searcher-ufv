Verse 1  
Youve tried all you can  
And you dont understand why things wont turn out right  
Youve tried all you know  
And still it seems so hard to comprehend  
That impossibility becomes reality  
When His voice speaks through your doubt and brings healing  
  
Chorus  
Be still and know I am God  
Be still and now Ive got it all in control  
I will do a work like only I can do  
Even in your trial I will see you through  
Be still and know I am God
