Craving your body all through the night  
Feels like Im going through withdrawals  
I want to hold you  
I want you inside of these arms  
  
Im dying to taste you I cant deny  
Cant get it out of my mind  
Please let me hold you  
Cause I need your lovin tonight  
  
Chorus  
Whenever Im near you  
My love just comes down  
Whenever I see you  
I just want you around  
Cause I want to feel you  
All through the day and the night  
Whenever Im near you  
It feels like bedtime  
  
Constantly thinking of things to do  
Places where we can make love  
I want to freak you  
Ill freak you wherever you want  
  
Placing my kisses all over you  
Caressing you so nice and slow  
Oh how I want you  
Girl theres something I want you to know  
  
Chorus  
  
Do you get lonely  
I get so lonely  
Thinking about me  
thinking about you  
  
Am I the only  
girl I think of or dream of at all  
Are you into out your mind for me Say you cant go a day without me  
girl I need you and I want you girl I need you I need you I need you  
  
Chorus  
  
It feels like bedtime
