I think Im gonna be sad  
I think its today yeah  
The girl thats driving me mad  
Is going away  
Shes got a ticket to ride  
Shes got a ticket to ride  
Shes got a ticket to ride  
But she dont care  
She said that living with me  
Is bringing her down yeah  
For she would never be free  
When I was around  
Shes got a ticket to ride  
Shes got a ticket to ride  
Shes got a ticket to ride  
But she dont care  
I dont know why shes ridin so high  
She ought to think twice  
She ought to do right by me  
Before she gets to saying goodbye  
She ought to think twice  
She ought to do right by me  
I think Im gonna be sad  
I think its today yeah  
The girl thats driving me mad  
Is going away yeah  
Shes got a ticket to ride  
Shes got a ticket to ride  
Shes got a ticket to ride  
But she dont care  
I dont know why shes ridin so high  
She ought to think twice  
She ought to do right by me  
Before she gets to saying goodbye  
She ought to think twice  
She ought to do right by me  
She said that living with me  
Is bringing her down yeah  
For she would never be free  
When I was around  
Ah shes got a ticket to ride
