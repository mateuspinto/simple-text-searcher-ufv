Zoom just one look  
And then my heart went boom  
Suddenly and we were on the moon  
Flying high in the neon sky oh  
  
Bang just one touch  
And all the church bells rang  
Heaven called and all the angels sang  
Sunrise shine in the midnight sky oh  
  
Zoom you chase the day away  
High noon the moon and stars came out to play  
Then my whole wide world went zoom  
  
I passed a rainbow as we went flying by  
Faster and faster we were higher than high  
For once in my lifetime I was finally free  
And you came back to me  
  
Oh zoom you chase the day away  
High noon the moon and stars came out to play  
Then my whole wide world went zoom  
  
Moonbeams dancing in the afternoon  
Shadows blowing as the roses bloom  
Looking down on a wonderland oh  
  
Smack just one kiss  
And I was outta whack  
All at once there was no turning back  
Oh so far above the brightest star oh  
  
Oh zoom you chase the day away  
High noon the moon  
And stars came out to play
