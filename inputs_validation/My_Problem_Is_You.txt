To love and get away before the walls have arisen  
Youve got to be free  
But to go on attempting to break into the prison  
Youd have to be me  
  
I wait for the sun to rise over the mountain  
I wait for your touch  
I wait for your angels to carry me home  
But I wait too much  
  
Waiting for you  
I have no problem telling right from wrong  
Fiction from whats true  
No problem telling the dream from the dawn  
  
My problem is you  
Waiting here for you  
  
I wanted to live in the realm of the senses  
Youve got to know how  
And for some kinds of pleasure there are no defenses  
I know that now  
  
Our love is a crackling ladder of lightning  
Our love is a fire  
Our love is a wave moving deep in an ocean  
Of need and desire  
  
Waiting for you  
I have no problem with this crooked world  
I play the cards I drew  
No problem with the changes life has hurled  
  
My problem is you  
Waiting here for you  
  
I need your wonder and I need your light  
I need your tender touch to heal the night  
I need you laughing and I need you free  
And I need to lock you away deep inside of me  
Waiting for you  
  
I have no problem telling right from wrong  
The way some people do  
I know exactly where these arms belong  
My problem is you  
Waiting here for you
