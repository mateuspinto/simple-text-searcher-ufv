Chorus  
Ohoh Im with Stupid  
Ohoh Im with Stupid  
  
See you on the TV  
Call you every day  
Fly across the ocean  
Just to let you get your way  
No one understands me  
Where Im coming from  
Why would I be with someone  
whos obviously so dumb  
Love comes  
Love grows  
every time you rise to meet me  
take my hand to greet me  
Love comes  
Love grows  
and power can give a man  
much more than anybody knows  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Before we ever met  
I thought like everybody did  
you were just a moron  
a billiondollar kid  
You flew up all the way  
like a hawk chasing a dove  
I never thought that I would be  
a sacrifice in love  
It comes  
It grows  
and now were tied together  
everybody knows  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Is stupid really stupid  
or a different kind of smart  
Do we really have a relationship  
so special in your heart  
  
Chorus  
I have to ask myself  
like any lover might  
Have you made a fool of me  
Are you not Mr Right  
You grin  
I pose  
Its not about sincerity  
Everybody knows  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Is stupid really stupid  
or a different kind of smart  
Thats how you stole my heart  
Im with Stupid
