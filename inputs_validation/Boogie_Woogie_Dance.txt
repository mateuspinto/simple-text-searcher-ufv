In France theyve got a dance  
A feel real crazy dance  
A touch of class and a dash of romance  
Feel that crazy dance  
  
Boogie woogie dance  
Boogie woogie dance  
  
In Spain they give it a name  
A real chic cheeky name  
One you know it youre not the same  
But you really take a chance  
  
Boogie woogie dance  
Boogie woogie dance  
  
In Brazil they got a pill  
A real hard power packed pill  
Take one too many youll feel quite ill  
But you really take a change  
  
Do the boogie woogie dance  
Boogie woogie dance  
  
Oh dance get out and dance
