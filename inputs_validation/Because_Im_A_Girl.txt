I just cant understand the ways  
Of all the men and their mistakes  
You give them all your heart  
And then they rip it all away  
  
You told me how much you loved me  
And how our love was meant to be  
And I believed in you  
I thought that you would set me free  
  
Refrain  
You shouldve just told me the truth  
That I wasnt the girl for you  
Still I didnt have a clue  
So my heart depended on you whoa  
  
Chorus  
Although Ill say I hate you now  
Though Ill shout and curse you out  
Ill always have love for you  
Because I am a girl  
  
Been told a man will leave you cold  
Get sick of you and bored  
I know that its no lie  
I gave my all still I just cry  
  
Never again will I be fooled  
To give my all when nothings true  
I wont be played again  
But I will fall in love again  
  
Refrain  
  
Chorus  
  
Been told a man will leave you cold  
Get sick of you and bored  
I know that its no lie  
I gave my all still I just cry  
  
Never again will I be fooled  
To give my all when nothings true  
I wont be played again  
But I will fall in love again  
  
You took advantage of my willingness  
To do anything for love  
Now Im the only one in pain  
Will you please take it all away  
  
Never thought being born a girl  
How I can love you and be burned  
And now I will build a wall  
To never get torn again  
  
Chorus 2x
