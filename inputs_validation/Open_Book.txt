Shes writing shes writing shes writing a novel  
Shes writing shes weaving conceiving a plot  
It quickens it thickens you cant put it down now  
It takes you it shakes you it makes you lose your thought  
But youre caught in your own glory  
You are believing your own stories  
Writing your own headlines  
Ignoring your own deadlines  
But now youve gotta write them all again  
  
Chorus  
You think shes an open book  
But you dont know which page to turn to  
Do you  
You think shes an open book  
But you dont know which page to turn to  
Do you Repeat x2  
You want her confront her just open your window  
Unbolt it unlock it unfasten your latch  
You want it confront it just open your window  
All you really have to do is ask  
But youre caught in your own glory  
You are believing your own stories  
Timing your contractions  
Inventing small contraptions  
That will roll across your parlors hardwood floors  
  
Chorus  
You think shes an open book  
But you dont know which page to turn to  
Do you  
You think shes an open book  
But you dont know which page to turn to  
Do you Repeat x2  
You think shes an open book  
But you dont know which page to turn to  
Do you Repeat x3
