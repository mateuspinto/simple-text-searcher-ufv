Loose Lucy is my delight  
She comes running and we ball all night  
Round and round and round and round  
Dont take much to get me on the ground  
Shes my yoyo Im her string  
Listen to the birds on the hot wire sing  
  
Chorus  
Singing yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Singing thank you for a real good time  
  
I got jumped coming home last night  
Shadow in the alley turned out all my lights  
Round and round and round and round  
Dont take much to get me on the ground  
Loose Lucy she was sore  
Says I know you cant want my love no more  
  
Chorus  
  
Bebop baby how can this be  
I know youve been out a cheating on me  
Round and round and round and round  
Dont take much to get the word around  
Cross my heart and hope to die  
I was just hanging out with the other guys  
  
Chorus  
  
Went back home with two black eyes  
You know Ill love her till the day I die  
Round and round and round and round  
Dont take much to get the word around  
I like your smile but I aint your type  
Dont shake the tree when the fruit aint ripe  
  
Chorus
