No one can enslave anybody  
Whos got freedom freedom of mind  
But what they sure as hell can do  
Is to put you in the grave  
Cause they know youve got freedom of mind  
  
We need to be awaken to the new reality  
Keep the fires burning in our souls  
There are stages in our lives  
That we need to leave behind  
To keep the freedom of mind  
  
Gonna bring you down  
People bring you down  
Gonna bring you down  
Down down down  
Gonna bring you down  
If you dont stand your ground  
Gonna bring you down  
Down down down  
  
Damn its a shame to work your fingers to the bone  
To barely barely make a living  
And you wake up early mornings  
Dont come home till late  
Its a struggle  
In a jungle jungle jungle  
  
We all need to be awaken to the new reality  
Keep the fires burning in our souls  
There are stages in our lives  
We need to leave behind  
To keep the freedom of the mind
