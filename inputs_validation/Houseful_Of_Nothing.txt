Talking to your lover  
On a non existent phone  
Houseful of nothing  
The joyous conversation  
Of a creature quite alone  
Houseful of nothing  
The whir of passing traffic  
The sighing of the breeze  
Houseful of nothing  
The awareness of a culture  
That is fading by degrees  
Houseful of nothing  
  
A hint of a shadow  
Or a picture by the door  
Houseful of nothing  
The creak of a staircase  
Or the flexing of the floor  
Houseful of nothing  
The light spreading even  
Neither glaring nor too dark  
Houseful of nothing  
All finished had blended  
Leaving surface with no mark  
Houseful of nothing  
  
One time in a lifetime  
Understand just what you own  
Noone  
Owns the sunshine  
And possession is a stone  
One time in a lifetime  
Try to glimpse just who you are  
All that learning  
All those ages  
Have you really come so far  
  
The traces of a perfume  
Halfremembered from the past  
Houseful of nothing  
The ringing of a catchphrase  
From a cherished telecast  
Houseful of nothing  
Nothing in the corner  
Nothing on the wall  
Houseful of nothing  
It makes you laugh to think  
That there were ever things at all  
Houseful of nothing  
  
One time in a lifetime  
Will you use the things you know  
Will you passing  
Make a difference  
Oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo  
Will you foster will you sow  
One time in a lifetime  
Make a list of all you own  
And when you are gone  
What will it do for you baby  
Hey hey hey hey hey hey  
  
You took my family  
Give it back give it back  
You took the heart of me  
Give it back give it back  
You took my dignity  
Give it back  
Remember society  
Bring it back bring it back  
Bring it back  
Sense of community  
Bring it back bring it back  
Bring it back  
Lost opportunity  
Bring it back bring it back  
Bring it back  
Mercy and charity  
Bring it back  
Bring it bring it bring it bring it back  
  
One time in a lifetime  
Understand just what you own  
Noone owns the sunshine  
And possession is a stone  
  
One time  
Remember society  
In a lifetime  
Bring it back  
Try to glimpse just who you are  
All that learning  
Sense of community  
All those ages  
Bring it back  
Have you really come so far  
  
Lost opportunity  
Bring it back  
Mercy and charity  
Bring it back  
  
One time in a lifetime  
Try to glimpse just who you are  
All that learning  
All those ages  
Have you really come so far  
  
Bring it bring it bring it bring it back  
Bring it back  
  
One time in a lifetime  
  
Mercy and charity  
Bring it back
