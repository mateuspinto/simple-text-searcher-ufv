I have a dream a song to sing  
To help me cope with anything  
If you see the wonder wonder of a fairy tale  
You can take the future even if you fail  
I believe in angels  
Something good in everything I see  
I believe in angels  
When I know the time is right for me  
Ill cross the stream I have a dream
