Fool you didnt have to hurt her  
Fool you didnt have to lose her  
Fool you only had to love her  
But now her love is gone  
  
Fool you could have made her want you  
Fool you could have made her love you  
Fool you only had to love her  
But now her love is gone  
  
Gone now the love and laughter  
See yourself the morning after  
Cant you see her eyes are misty  
As she said good bye  
  
Fool you didnt have to hurt her  
Fool you didnt have to lose her  
Fool you only had to love her  
But now your love is gone  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Fool you only had to love her  
But now her love is gone  
  
Fool you could have made her want you  
Fool you could have made her love you  
Fool you only had to love her  
But now her love is gone  
  
Fool you didnt have to hurt her  
Fool you didnt have to lose her  
Fool you only had to love her
