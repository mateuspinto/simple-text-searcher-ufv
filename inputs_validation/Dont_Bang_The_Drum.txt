Well here we are in a special place  
What are you gonna do here  
Now we stand in a special place  
What will you do here  
What show of soul are we gonna get from you  
It could be deliverance or history  
Under these skies so blue  
Could be something true  
But if I know you youll bang the drum  
Like monkeys do  
Here we are in a fabulous place  
What are you gonna dream here  
We are standing in this fabulous place  
What are you gonna play here  
I know you love the high life you love to leap around  
You love to beat your chest and make your sound  
But not here man  this is sacred ground  
With a Power flowing through  
And if know you youll bang the drum  
Like monkeys do  
Here we stand on a rocky shore  
Your father stood here before you  
I can see his ghost explore you  
I can feel the sea implore you  
Not to pass on by  
Not to walk on by  
And not to try  
Just to let it come  
Dont bang the drum  
Just let it come  
Dont bang the drum  
Just let it come  
Dont bang the drum  
Do you know how to let it come now  
Dont bang the drum  
Just let it come now  
Dont bang the drum  
Dont bang the drum  
Dont bang the drum  
Dont bang the drum  
Dont bang the drum  
Dont bang the drum  
Dont bang the drum  
Dont bang the drum  
Dont bang the drum  
Dont bang the drum
