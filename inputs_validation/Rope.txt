This indecision got me climbing up the wall  
Been cheating gravity and waiting on the fall  
How did this come over me I thought I was above it all  
Our hopes gone up in smoke swallow your crown  
  
Choke on a kiss I thought Id save my breath for you  
Choke on a kiss I thought Id save my breath for you  
  
Give me some rope Im coming loose Im hanging on you  
Give me some rope Im coming loose Im pulling for you now  
Give me some rope Im coming out of my head into the clear when you go  
I go no  
  
These premonitions got me crying up a storm  
Leave your condition this position does no harm  
  
Choke on a kiss I thought Id save my breath for you  
Choke on a kiss I thought Id save my breath for you  
  
Give me some rope Im coming loose Im hanging on you  
Give me some rope Im coming loose Im pulling for you now  
Give me some rope Im coming out of my head into the clear when you go  
I go noose  
  
Give me some rope Im coming loose Im hanging on you  
Give me some rope Im coming loose Im pulling for you now  
Give me some rope Im coming through Im coming out yeah  
Give me some rope Im coming out of my head into the clear when you go  
I go go
