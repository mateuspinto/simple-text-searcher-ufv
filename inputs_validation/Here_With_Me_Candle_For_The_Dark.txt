We rode the train  
From Paris to the cold Atlantic shore  
The winter rain  
Kept us in each others arms until the dawn  
Do you remember  
  
Faster than the sun  
Flying higher than everyone  
Like a dream too good to last  
I wont regret the past  
  
Chorus  
Here with me  
Deep down in my soul now and forever  
A candle for the dark I keep you  
Here with me  
A story with an unexpected end  
  
The morning plane  
Through empty doors a mountain in the sky  
The golden chain  
The autumn treetops cast a northern light  
Do you remember  
  
We have no common ground  
Treasure lost will now be found  
We can blame our wild at heart  
From now and from the start  
  
Chorus  
  
Remember feelings I have shown  
Chasing dreams Ive never done  
Illusion lead us both away  
Hold me in your arms before you go  
  
Chorus  
  
Deep down in my soul you will be  
Here with me  
A story with an unexpected end  
Everywhere I go youre here with me
