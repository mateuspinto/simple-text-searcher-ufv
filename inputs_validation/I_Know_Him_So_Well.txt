Nothing is so good it lasts eternally  
Perfect situations must go wrong  
But this has never yet prevented me  
From wanting far too much for far too long  
Looking back I could have done it differently  
Won a few more moments who can tell  
But it took time to understand the man  
Now at least I know I know him well  
  
Wasnt it good Wasnt it fine  
Isnt it madness he cant be mine  
But in the end he needs a little more than before  
Security he needs his fantasy and freedom  
I know him so well  
  
No one in your life is with you constantly  
No one is completely on your side  
And though I move my world to be with him  
Still the gap between us is too wide  
Looking back I could have played it differently  
Learned about the man before I fell  
But I was ever so much younger then  
  
Wasnt it good oh so good Wasnt it fine so fine  
Isnt it madness he cant be mine  
  
Didnt I know how it would go  
If I knew from the start  
Why am I falling apart  
  
Wasnt it fine  
Isnt it madness he cant be mine  
But in the end he needs a little more than before  
Security he needs his fantasy and freedom  
I know him so well  
It took some to understand him  
Hoo ooh I know him so well
