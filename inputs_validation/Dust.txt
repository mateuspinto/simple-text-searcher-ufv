When the white flame in us is gone  
And we that lost the worlds delight  
Stiffen in darkness  
Left alone  
To crumble in our separate night  
When your swift hair is quiet in death  
And through the lips corruption  
Thrust to still the labor of my breath  
  
When we are dust when we are dust  
When we are dust when we are dust  
  
When your swift hair is quiet in death  
And through the lips corruption  
Thrust to still the labor of my breath  
  
When we are dust when we are dust  
When we are dust when we are dust  
  
When the white flame in us is gone  
And we that lost the worlds delight  
Stiffen in darkness  
Left alone  
To crumble in our separate night  
When your swift hair is quiet in death  
And through the lips corruption  
Thrust to still the labor of my breath  
  
When we are dust when we are dust  
When we are dust when we are dust
