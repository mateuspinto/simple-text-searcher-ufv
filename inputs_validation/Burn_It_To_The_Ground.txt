Well its midnight damn right were wound up too tight  
Ive got a fist full of whiskey the bottle just bit me  
Ooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh  
That shit makes me bat shit crazy  
Weve got no fear no doubt all in balls out  
  
Were going out tonight  
To kick out every light  
Take anything that we want  
Drink everything in sight  
Were going till the world stops turning  
While we burn it to the ground tonight  
Ooooohhhhhhh  
  
Were screaming like demons swinging from the ceiling  
I got a fist full of fifties the tequila just hit me  
Ooooohhhhh  
We got no class no taste no shirt and shit faced  
We got it lined up shot down firing back straight crown  
  
Were going out tonight  
To kick out every light  
To get anything that we want  
Drink everything in sight  
Were going till the world stops turning  
While we burn it to the ground tonight  
Ooooohhhhhhh  
  
Ticking like a time bomb drinking till the nights gone  
Well get you hands out of this glass last call my ass  
Well no chain no lock and this train wont stop  
We got no fear no doubt all in balls out  
  
Were going out tonight  
To kick out every light  
To get anything that we want  
To drink everything in sight  
Were going till the world stops turning  
While we burn it to the ground tonight  
Ooooohhhhhhh  
Were going out tonight  
To kick out every light  
To get anything that we want  
To drink everything in sight  
Were going till the world stops turning  
While we burn it to the ground tonight
