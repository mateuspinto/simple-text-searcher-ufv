I rise to see you in the morning  
I feel your warmth so true  
The light inside of me  
Is there for all to see  
But all I think about is you  
  
I see your face in every doorway  
That I have wandered through  
The light inside of me  
Is there for all to see  
But all I think about is you  
  
Baby even in the hardest times  
Lately even in the darkest nights  
I know  
  
Baby even in the hardest times  
Lately even in the darkest nights  
I know  
  
I rise to see you in the morning  
I feel your warmth so true  
The light inside of me  
Is there for all to see  
But all I think about is you  
But all I think about is you
