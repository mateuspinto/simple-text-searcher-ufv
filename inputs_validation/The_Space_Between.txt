You cannot quit me so quickly  
Is no hope in you for me  
No corner you could squeeze me  
But Ive got all the time for you love  
  
The space between  
The tears we cry is the laughter keeps us coming back for more  
The space between  
The wicked lies we tell to keep us safe from the pain  
Will I hold you again  
  
These fickle fuddled words confuse me  
Like will it rain today  
We waste the hours with talking talking  
These twisted games were playing  
Were strange allies  
With warring hearts  
What a wildeyed beast you be  
The space between  
  
The wicked lies we tell that hope to keep us safe from the pain  
Look at us spinning out in the madness of a roller coaster  
You know you went off like the devil in the church  
In the middle of a crowded room  
All we can do my love  
  
Is hope we dont take this ship down  
The space between  
Where you smile and hide  
Is where youll find me if I get to go  
The space between  
The bullets in our firefight  
Is where Ill be hiding waiting for you  
  
The rain that falls  
Splashed in your heart  
Ran like sadness down the window into your room  
The space between  
Our wicked lies is  
The hope to keep us safe from pain  
  
Take my hand  
cause were walking out of here  
Right out of here  
Is all we need dear  
The space between  
Whats wrong and right  
  
Is where youll find me hiding waiting for you  
The space between your heart and mind  
Is the space well fill with time  
The space between  
The tears we cry is the laughter keeps us coming back for more  
  
The space between our wicked lies  
Where we hope to keep safe from pain  
The space between  
The space between
