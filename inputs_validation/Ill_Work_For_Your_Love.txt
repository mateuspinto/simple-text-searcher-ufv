Pour me a drink Theresa in one of those glasses you dust off  
And Ill watch the bones in your back like the stations of the cross  
Round your hair the sun lifts a halo at your lips a crown of thorns  
Whatever the deals going down to this one Im sworn  
  
Chorus  
Ill work for your love dear  
Ill work for your love  
What others may want for free  
Ill work for your love  
  
The dust of civilizations and loves sweet remains  
Slip off of your fingers and come drifting down like rain  
The pages of Revelation lie open in your empty eyes of blue  
I watch you slip that comb through your hair and this I promise you  
  
Chorus  
  
Well tears they fill the rosary at your feet my temple of bones  
Here in this perdition we go on and on  
Now I see your pieces crumbled and our book of faiths been tossed  
And Im just down here searching for my own piece of the cross  
In the late afternoon sun fills the room with a mist in the garden before the
fall  
I watch your hands smooth the front of your blouse and seven drops of blood
fall  
  
Chorus x 2
