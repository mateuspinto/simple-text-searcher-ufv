People rushing round with no time to spare  
Im so dizzy  
Im neither here nor there  
In this traffic jam  
I just want to shout  
Let me off o this English roundabout  
  
English roundabout  
  
And all the the horns go beep beep  
All the people follow like sheep  
Im full of light and sound  
Making my head go round round  
  
Everyone is cursing under their breath  
Im a passenger  
I feel close to death  
Hopeless situation  
I have no doubt  
Stop the madness English roundabout  
  
English roundabout  
  
And all the cars go brum brum  
And in my ears I feel a hum  
The neons blind my eyes  
All those tempers rise rise  
  
Cars and buses go  
Puffing out their smoke  
Roll my window down  
I begin to choke  
I have had enough  
I just want to get out  
Let me off o this English roundabout  
  
English roundabout
