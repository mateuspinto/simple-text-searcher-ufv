Ive seen a look of evil in your eyes  
Youve been filling me all full of lies  
Sorrow will not change your shameful deeds  
Do well best someone else has better seen  
  
Evil woman dont you play your games with me  
Evil woman dont you play your games with me  
  
Now I know just what youre looking for  
You want me to claim that child you bore  
Well you know that it must he not be  
And you know the way it got to be  
  
Evil woman dont you play your games with me  
Evil woman dont you play your games with  
  
Evil woman dont you play your games with me  
Evil woman dont you play your games with me  
  
Wickedness lies in your moisten lips  
Your body moves just like the crack of a whip  
Blackness sleeps on top of your stray bed  
Do you wish that you could see me dead  
  
Evil woman dont you play your games with me  
Evil woman dont you play your games with me  
Evil woman dont you play your games with me  
Evil woman dont you play your games with me
