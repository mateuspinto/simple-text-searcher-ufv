Verse 1  
If only for a second  
Let me have you  
Tell me all your secrets  
Let me know you  
  
Paint me all your pictures  
Hang them on my wall  
Show me all your colors  
Show me all of those  
  
Chorus  
Open up your eyes open up your mind  
Follow in line with what youre meant to be  
Open up your eyes open up your mind  
Follow in line with what youre meant to be  
  
Verse 2  
A fire burns into you  
Purifying all  
And what I saw was opulence  
And thats not for me  
And thats not for me  
And thats not for me  
  
Bridge  
Only in the summertime  
Only in the summertime  
Things will change with time  
Only in the summertime  
  
Chorus  
Open up your eyes open up your mind  
Follow in line with what youre meant to be  
Open up your eyes open up your mind  
Follow in line with what youre meant to be  
  
Bridge  
Only in the summertime  
Only in the summertime  
Things will change with time  
Only in the summertime
