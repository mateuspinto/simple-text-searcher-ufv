Words and Music by Ray Gilbert and Dorival Caymmi  
  
Every day I sent another present  
Just to let her know how very much I care  
I wrote a little love note with each present  
But it didnt seem to get me anywhere  
  
My poor worried heart was almost certain  
That this love affair would never be  
Then I sent a dozen yellow roses and  
From that moment she belonged to me  
  
Roses roses roses I thank all the roses that bloom in the spring  
Love is a wonderful thing the rest of my life I will bring her  
Roses and roses and roses of love  
  
Roses roses roses I thank you for saying what I couldnt say  
Oh what a wonderful way to tell her I love you each day  
With roses and roses and roses of love  
  
Roses roses roses I thank all the roses that bloom in the spring  
Love is a wonderful thing the rest of my life I will bring her  
Roses and roses and roses of love  
Roses and roses and roses and roses of love  
  
Fade  
Roses and roses and roses and roses of love
