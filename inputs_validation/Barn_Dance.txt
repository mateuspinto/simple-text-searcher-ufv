One night as I was sleeping something awakened me  
There was a light on in my barn so I went down to see  
I peeked through a big ole crack in the door and what do you think I saw  
The animals were havin a barn dance right in the horses stall  
And there was a chicken doing the chicken reel and the muskart rambled on  
The ole cow did a cowcow boogie and the rooster crowed a song  
A mouse came out of his hidin place and he danced on one leg  
The ole hen got so tickled that she almost laid an egg  
 banjo  guitar   
They were all dressed up for the barn dance it made me want to laugh  
The rabbit wore a big bowtie and the pig was a lookin in a lookin glass  
And the goose danced with the gander til an old dog butted in  
The horse was horsing around a lot till the mare got mad at him  
And there was a chicken doing  
And there was a chicken doing
