Every town has its town bum  
I guess ours had one  
Heres a song about him I remember him fondly  
Well his name was Abner Brown  
I knew an old drunk named Abner Brown  
And nobody knew when he came to town  
But he spread good will to his fellow men  
And they let him sleep in the cotton gin  
He could drink more brew than an army could  
But he had more friends and he did more good  
Than a lot of fine fancy people in our town  
So they tolerated Abner Brown  
And all us kids were on his side  
Cause he told us tales till our eyes grew wide  
And he made us feel bout ten feet tall  
Cause he had no kids but he claimed us all  
And after school and on weekends  
You could find me down at the cotton gin  
The truest friend that I ever found was  
A good old drunk named Abner Brown  
Abner Brown I wish that I could see you once again  
I believe that youd stack up with all the mighty men  
Ive met and known in all the low  
And higher places that Ive been  
Thinking of you picks me up when Im feeling down  
I thank the Lord for making Abner Brown  
Lord take me back to the cotton land  
To Arkansas take me home again  
Let me be the boy that I once have been  
Let me walk that road to the cotton gin  
Hes probably dead many years ago  
And gone the way that old drunks go  
But Id still like to sit me down  
Talk to my old friend Abner Brown  
Abner Brown I wish  
I thank the Lord for making Abner Brown
