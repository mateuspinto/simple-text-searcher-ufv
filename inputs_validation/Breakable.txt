Have you ever thought about what protects our hearts  
Just a cage of rib bones and other various parts  
So its fairly simple to cut right through the mess  
And to stop the muscle that makes us confess  
  
We are so fragile  
And our cracking bones make noise  
And we are just  
Breakable breakable breakable girls and boys  
  
You fasten my seatbelt because it is the law  
In your two ton death trap I finally saw  
A piece of love in your face that bathed me in regret  
Then you drove me to places Ill never forget  
  
And we are so fragile  
And our cracking bones make noise  
And we are just  
Breakable breakable breakable girls and boys  
  
And we are so fragile  
And our our cracking bones make noise  
And we are just  
Breakable breakable breakable girls  
Breakable breakable breakable girls  
Breakable breakable breakable girls and boys
