I was driving home early Sunday morning through Bakersfield  
Listening to gospel music on the colored radio station  
And the preacher said You know you always have the Lord by your side  
And I was so pleased to be informed of this that I ran  
Twenty red lights in his honor  
Thank you Jesus thank you Lord  
  
I had an arrangement to meet a girl and I was kind of late  
And I thought by the time I got there shed be off  
Shed be off with the nearest truck driver she could find  
Much to my surprise there she was sittin in the corner  
A little bleary worse for wear and tear  
Was a girl with far away eyes  
  
So if youre down on your luck  
And you cant harmonize  
Find a girl with far away eyes  
And if youre downright disgusted  
And life aint worth a dime  
Get a girl with far away eyes  
  
Well the preacher kept right on saying that all I had to do was send  
Ten dollars to the church of the Sacred Bleeding Heart Of Jesus  
Located somewhere in Los Angeles California  
And next week theyd say my prayer on the radio  
And all my dreams would come true  
So I did the next week I got a prayer with a girl  
Well you know what kind of eyes she got well Ill tell ya  
  
So if youre down on your luck  
I know you all sympathize  
Find a girl with far away eyes  
And if youre downright disgusted  
And life aint worth a dime  
Get a girl with far away eyes  
  
So if youre down on your luck  
I know you all sympathize  
Find a girl with far away eyes
