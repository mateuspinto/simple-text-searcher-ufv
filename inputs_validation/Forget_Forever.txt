I told I told I told myself again  
Im never running back on what I said  
Trying not to run but youre so far away  
So far away  
Wont listen to the conscience in my head  
Im conscious but Im lonely halfway dead  
Tired of the thing you never you never said  
You never said  
  
Our love was made to rule the world  
You came and broke the perfect girl  
Our love was made to rule the world  
Our love was made to rule the world  
You left me wanting what we were  
Our love was made to rule the world  
  
Forget forever  
Forget forever  
Forget you ever knew my name my name my name my name  
  
I know I know I know we cant pretend  
That we never lovers in the end  
I tried to tell myself that this pain would go away  
Just go away  
  
Our love was made to rule the world  
You came and broke the perfect girl  
Our love was made to rule the world  
Our love was made to rule the world  
You left me wanting what we were  
Our love was made to rule the world  
  
Forget forever  
Forget forever  
Forget you ever knew my name my name my name my name  
  
Our love was made to rule the world  
You came and broke the perfect girl  
Our love was made to rule the world  
  
Forget forever  
Forget forever  
Forget you ever knew my name my name my name my name  
Forget forever  
Forget forever
