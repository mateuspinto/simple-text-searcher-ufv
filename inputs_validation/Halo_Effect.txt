What did I see  
Fool that I was  
A goddess with wings on her heels  
All my illusions  
Projected on her  
The ideal that I wanted to see  
  
What did I know  
Fool that I was  
Little by little I learned  
My friends were dismayed  
To see my betrayed  
But they knew they could never tell me  
  
What did I care  
Fool that I was  
Little by little I burned  
Maybe sometimes  
There might be a flaw  
But how pretty the picture was back then  
  
What did I do  
Fool that I was  
To profit from youthful mistakes  
Its shameful to tell  
How often I fell  
In love with illusions again  
  
What did I do  
Fool that I was  
To profit from youthful mistakes  
So shameful to tell  
Just how often I fell  
In love with illusions again  
  
A goddess with wings on her heels
