All I say is thank you to my mother  
To my father my brothers and sisters  
  
To be in my dream to be not full of sorrow  
And we call you to be in this way  
  
All I say is  
  
Some people say to be fat is not nice  
But I tell them to me its perfect  
My father only told me to be in the eye of all them  
And not to be sad about what people say but Im not no no  
  
All I say is  
  
Im happy to be to be on this way  
When you not let me play  
  
All I say is
