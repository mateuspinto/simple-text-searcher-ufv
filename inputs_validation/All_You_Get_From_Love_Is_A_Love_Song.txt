Like sailin on a sailin ship to nowhere  
Love took over my heart like an ocean breeze  
As seagulls fly I knew that I was losin  
Love was washed away with the driftin tide  
  
Oh its a dirty old shame  
When all you get from love is a love song  
Thats got you layin up nights just waitin  
For the music to start  
Its such a dirty old shame when you got to  
Take the blame for a love song  
Because the best love songs are written  
With a broken heart  
  
And now the tears in my eyes are ever blinding  
The future that lies before me I cannot see  
look at look at the future I cannot see  
Although tomorrow I know the sun is rising  
Lighting up the world for everyone but not for me  
  
Oh its a dirty old shame  
When all you get from love is a love song  
Thats got you layin up nights just waitin  
For the music to start  
Its such a dirty old shame when you got to  
Take the blame for a love song  
Because the best love songs are written  
With a broken heart  
  
look at look at the future I cannot see  
  
Oh its a dirty old shame  
When all you get from love is a love song  
All you get from love is an old love song  
Thats got you layin up nights just waitin  
For the music to start  
Its such a dirty old shame when you got to  
Take the blame for a love song  
Got to take the blame for an old love song  
Because the best love songs are written  
With a broken heart  
  
Repeat x2  
Oh its a dirty old shame  
When all you get from love is a love song  
All you get from love is an old love song  
Thats got you layin up nights just waitin  
For the music to start
