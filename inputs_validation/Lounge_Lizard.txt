Well I picked her up on a Saturday night  
Pool hall poison but she felt alright  
Oh dear what a sight when I saw her in the light of day  
She was a speakeasy sleazer of the highest degree  
Oh you should hear the stories she was laying on me  
We really got it on as she held my point of view  
  
Chorus  
Oh Shes a lounge lizard  
Coming on strong  
Who you fooling  
Its me youre with  
Lounge lizard  
Come on come on  
You got to be joking  
Give give give yeah  
  
Well I dont care if your sisters a john  
I dont mind where your momma come for  
Just give it to me  
Just pull it through me  
Alright  
  
Golly is a dolly got makeup on  
I dont mind just keep your raincoat on  
No hesitation no reputations to scale us  
  
Chorus  
  
Hey hey hey hey hey hey  
  
Chorus x 2  
  
I said give give give  
Give give give Repeat x 4
