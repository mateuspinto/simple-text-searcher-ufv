They had a warrant out for me all over the country  
And I was trying to beat the raps in Idaho  
I was breaking into a schoolhouse Sunday morning without warning  
When I saw the sheriff coming for me slow from down below  
  
His steel gray eyes were blazing when he saw me  
His hand was on his gun when he rode up  
He said you killed that woman I know you shot her whyd you do it  
Im taking you to Austin then Im gonna lock you up  
  
Well he tied me with a plow line the next morning  
And he had me deep in Texas the next day  
A crazy screaming lynch mob waited in the streets of Austin  
But he put me in the jailhouse and he threw the key away  
  
A jury found me guilty three months later twelve evil men with murder in their
eyes  
They even took me out and said now show us where you killed her  
And that wicked judge said now I here by sentence you to die  
But here I am far away from Austin prison my friend the jailer handed me a
file  
Now all I want between me and there are a lot of friendly people  
And miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
