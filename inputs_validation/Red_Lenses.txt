I see red  
And it hurts my head  
Guess it must be something  
That I read  
  
Its the color of your heartbeat  
A rising summer sun  
The battle lost or won  
The flash to fashion  
And the pulse to passion  
Feels red  
Inside my head  
And truth is often bitter  
Left unsaid  
Said red red  
Thinking about the overhead  
The underfed  
  
Couldnt we talk about something else instead  
  
Weve got mars on the horizon  
Says the national midnight star  
its true  
What you believe is what you are  
A pair of dancing shoes  
The soviets are the blues  
The reds  
Under your bed  
Lying in the darkness  
Dead ahead  
  
And the mercury is rising  
Barometer starts to fall  
You know it gets to us all  
The pain that is learning  
And the rain that is burning  
Feel red  
Stillgo ahead  
You see black and white  
And I see red  
Red  
not blue
