Christmas time is in the air again  
Christmas chimes reminding me of  
When we fell like the snow  
So deep in love  
High above us the evergreens  
Sparkle with lights and feel the breeze  
As we made future Christmas memories  
  
Christmas shoppers glance at us and smile  
Cause the mistletoe is occupied  
And the dream is to share  
This Christmas cheer with you all year  
And not wait till the morning  
When Christmas time is in the air again  
  
Mr Grinch simply cant resist  
Warming up when he looks our way  
Even Old Scrooge makes a Christmas wish  
For a honey to hold Christmas day  
  
And to feel love like ours always  
La da da da da dum  
  
And the dream is to share  
This Christmas cheer  
With you all throughout the year  
And not wait till the morning  
When Christmas time is in the air  
Christmas time is everywhere  
Christmas time is in the air again  
  
Again  
And again
