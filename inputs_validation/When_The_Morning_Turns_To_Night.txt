Little girl with heroin so blue  
Youve got to find the future in you  
Your scepters and needles will put you away  
Forever and a day  
  
Your future will haunt you before you get there  
Imagine the planet with no air  
All mute no light no sun only light  
As far away as neverland  
  
As the sky comes tumbling down to the head  
And the valleys are all filed up with dirt  
As many people as there are sands in the sea  
Will die the morning after  
  
So little girl with your heroin so blue  
I guess our future is all up to you  
Through the battle sequence you must fight  
Til the morning turns to night  
  
So imagine our world with no air  
Just follow the son hell take you where  
The night and the seas are all full of light  
Til the morning turns to night  
  
Til the morning turns to night
