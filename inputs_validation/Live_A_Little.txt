Stressed out running late racing down the interstate  
Spilled hot coffee down the front of my jeans  
Its work work pay the rent money and my times spent  
Not a minute left for me to be me  
  
Been going like nothing can wait  
I gotta get my priorities straight  
  
I need to live a little have some fun  
Take some time waste it on number one  
Find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop  
Live a little love a lot  
  
Friday night here we go do a little dosido  
Kick back have a laugh catch my breath  
Tell the band slow it down there she is think I found  
Maybe Miss Wonderful I havent met yet  
  
It just hit me like a wrecking ball  
Shes giving me a wake up call  
  
I need to live a little have some fun  
Take some time waste it on number one  
Find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop  
Live a little love a lot  
  
Step back smell the rose  
Feel the sand between your toes  
Unplug unwind  
Step out in the sunshine  
  
I need to live a little have some fun  
Take some time waste it on number one  
Find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop  
Live a little  
  
I need to live a little have some fun  
Take some time waste it on number one  
Take the girl get a map and pick any ol dot  
Live a little we need to live a little love a lot
