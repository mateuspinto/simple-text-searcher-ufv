Beside the garden walls  
We walk in haunts of ancient peace  
At night we rest and go to sleep  
In haunts of ancient peace  
The love and light we seek  
The words we do not need to speak  
Here in this wondrous way we keep  
These haunts of ancient peace  
Let us go there again  
When we need some relief  
Oh when I cant find my feet  
When I need rest and sleep  
The Sunday bells they chime  
Around the countryside and towns  
A song of harmony and rhyme  
In haunts of ancient peace  
The holy grail we seek  
On down by haunts of ancient peace  
We see the new Jerusalem  
In haunts of ancient peace  
Oh when I cant find my feet  
Oh when I need some relief  
One more time again  
You know I want to go there one more time again  
Be still in haunts of ancient peace  
Be still
