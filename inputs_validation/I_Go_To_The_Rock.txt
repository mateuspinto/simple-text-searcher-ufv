I GO TO THE ROCK  
Writer Dottie RMBO  
I go to the rock  
Where do I go  
When theres nobody else to turn to  
Who do I talk to  
When nobody wants to listen  
Who do I lean on  
When theres no foundation stable  
I go to the rock  
I know hes able  
I go to the rock  
Chorus  
I go to the rock of my salvation  
I go to the stone that the builders rejected  
I run to the mountain and the mountain stands by me  
When the earth all around me is sinking sand  
On Christ the solid rock I stand  
When I need a shelter  
When I need a friend I go to the rock  
Where do I go x2  
When the storms of life are threating  
Who do I turn to  
When the winds of sorrow blow  
And is there a refuge in the time of Tribulation  
I go to the rock  
I know hes able  
I go to the rock  
CHORUS x2  
I go to the rock x4  
You can go to the rock x4  
I go to the rock x6  
When the earth all around me is sinking sand  
On Christ the solid rock I stand  
When I need a shelter  
When I need a friend  
I go to the rock
