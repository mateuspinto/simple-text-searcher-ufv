You pull me in then ya push me away  
Ask me leave then ya beg me to stay  
Bend me baby bend me till I break  
Do you really want to know how much  
This heart of mine can take  
When I find myself in a daze sometimes  
Lovin you has got me losin my mind  
  
Chorus  
Is it pleasure or pain  
Keeps me runnin keeps me runnin to you  
Pleasure or pain  
I just cant decide  
Are they one and the same  
Its confusing me blind  
Am I in love or insane  
Am I in it for the pleasure or pain  
  
Ya make me smile  
Make me thankful that I breathe  
Let me taste some heaven  
Before ya drop me to my knees  
Ya chain me baby till its time to set me free  
Give me everything I want  
Give me nothin that I need  
  
Well I ask myself why I keep holdin on  
Lovin you is just a weakness too strong  
  
Chorus  
  
I still dont understand why I cant resist  
What keeps me comin back comin back for more of this  
Pleasure or pain  
Keeps me runnin keeps me runnin to you  
Pleasure or pain  
I just cant decide  
Are they one and the same  
Its confusing me blind  
Am I in love or insane  
Am I in it for the pleasure or pain  
  
Keeps me runnin keeps me running to you  
I just cant decide  
Are they one and the same  
Its confusing me blind  
Am I in love or insane  
Am I in it for the pleasure or pain
