Watch the circle dehumanize  
Fuck the world stay outside  
You tread on me and you will find  
That you flirt with death before your time  
  
Face the music and the time has come  
Into the circle  
Electroviolence  
  
Violence Electroviolence  
  
Keep your distance subdivide  
Do not enter conservative type  
Sweaty bodies bodily harm  
Abuse thy neighbour thats the charm  
  
Blood shed on everyone  
Dont mistake violence for fun  
Blood guilty fashion fiend  
What you here for you dont fit in  
  
Take the shot take the pain  
Rebound back again  
Uncivilized reaction appeals to me  
No restraints face reality  
  
Never victim always vice  
Taking charge desensitized  
Do unto others stay unbowed  
You social misfit youre one of us now  
  
Violence Hey violence  
Electroviolence
