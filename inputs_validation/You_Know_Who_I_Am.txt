I cannot follow you my love  
You cannot follow me  
I am the distance you put between  
All of the moments that we will be  
  
You know who I am  
Youve stared at the sun  
Well I am the one who loves  
Changing from nothing to one  
  
Sometimes I need you naked  
Sometimes I need you wild  
I need you to carry my children in  
And I need you to kill a child  
You know who I am  
  
If you should ever track me down  
I will surrender there  
And I will leave with you one broken man  
Whom I will teach you to repair  
You know who I am  
  
I cannot follow you my love  
You cannot follow me  
I am the distance you put between  
All of the moments that we will be  
You know who I am
