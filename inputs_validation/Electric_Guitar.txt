Electric guitar is run over by a car on the highway  
  
This is a crime against the state  
This is the meaning of life  
  
Tune this electric guitar  
Tune this electric guitar  
Tutune this electric guitar  
Tune this electric guitar  
  
Electric guitar is pluggedin  
Recording Fa from Psycho Killer  
  
Judge and the jury  
Twelve members of the jury  
All listening to records  
Is this is a crime against the state  
Ah this is the verdict they reach  
  
Never listen to electric guitar  
Never listen to electric guitar  
Never listen to electric guitar  
Never listen to electric guitar  
  
Electric guitar is copied  
Copy sounds better  
Call this law of justice  
Call this freedom and liberty  
I thought I perjure myself  
Right in front of the jury  
  
Is this a crime against the state  
No this is the verdict they reach  
  
Someone controls electric guitar  
Someone controls electric guitar  
Someone controls electric guitar  
Someone controls electric guitar
