In the wee wee hours  
Thats when I think of you  
In the wee wee hours  
Thats when I think of you  
You say but yet I wonder  
If your love was ever true  
In a wee little room  
I sit alone and think of you  
In a wee little room  
I sit alone and think of you  
I wonder if you still remember  
All the things we used to do  
One little song  
For a fading memory  
One little song  
For a fading memory  
Of the one I really love  
The only one for me
