Mourner wherever you are  
Wherever you are at the cross there is room  
Tell your burdened hearts  
Your burdened heart at the cross there is room  
  
Tell it in the Saviors ear  
Cast away your every fear  
Only speak and He will hear  
  
Hallelujah everyone  
Everyone can come to the cross  
It doesnt matter what youve done  
Everyone can come to the cross  
  
Sinner come today  
Come today at the cross there is room  
Blessed thoughts for everyone  
For everyone can come to the cross  
  
Now a living fountain see  
Open there for you and me  
For rich and poor for bond and free oh yeah  
  
Hallelujah everyone  
Everyone can come to the cross  
I say it doesnt matter what youve done  
Everyone can come to the cross oh yeah  
  
Tell it in the Saviors ear  
Cast away your every fear  
Only speak and He will hear  
  
Hallelujah everyone  
And everyone can come to the cross  
I say it doesnt matter what youve done  
Everyone can come to the cross oh yeah  
  
Woah woah  
Everyone can come to the cross oh yeah  
Woah woah  
I say everyone can come to the cross oh yeah
