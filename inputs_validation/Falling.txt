Falling  
Help me Im falling  
Helplessly falling  
Falling for you  
And mountains  
There may be mountains  
The highest mountain  
Wont keep me from you oh yeah  
  
For you Id swim across an ocean wide  
Just to be with you Id even dare to fly  
Its the miracle that happens every time  
I fall for you oh yeah  
And forever and forever without end  
I just keep  
  
Falling  
Needing and wanting  
The only one thing  
That I want is you oh yeah  
  
For you Id swim across an ocean wide  
Just to be with you Id even dare to fly  
Its the miracle that happens every time  
I fall for you oh yeah  
And forever and forever without end  
I fall for you  
  
For you Id swim across an ocean wide  
Just to be with you Id even dare to fly  
Its the miracle that happens every time  
I fall for you oh yeah  
And forever and forever without end  
I fall for you oh yeah  
And forever forever without end  
I fall for you  
  
I fall for you
