ToscaHow the stars seemed to shimmer  
  
E lucevan le stelle  
E olezzava la terra  
Stridea luscio dellorto  
E un passo sfiorava la rena  
Entrava ella fragrante  
Mi cadea fra le braccia  
Oh Dolci baci o languide carezze  
Mentrio fremente le belle forme discogliea dai veli  
Svani per sempre il sogno mio damore  
Lora e fuggita e muoio disperato  
E non ho amato mai tanto la vita  
  
Synopses  
The painter Cavaradossi has been sentenced to death for helping to hide an
escaped political prisoner As he awaits his fate he sings of the sweet
memories of his beloved Tosca and his dashed dreams  
  
English translation  
How the stars seemed to shimmer  
The sweet scents of the garden  
How the creaking gate whispered  
And a footstep skimmed over the sand  
How she then entered so fragrant  
And then fell into my two arms  
Ah sweetest of kiss languorous caresses  
While I stood trembling searching her features  
Concealed by her mantle My dreams of pure love  
Forgotten forever All of its gone now  
I die hopeless despairing and never before  
Have I loved life like this
