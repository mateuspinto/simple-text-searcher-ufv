Ive Got The Power To Fly Into The Wind  
The Power To Be Free To Die And Live Again  
This Powers Like Fire Fire Loves To Burn  
Make The World A Grave Of Ashes In A Urn  
The Power In The Darkness To See Without My Sight  
Walk Among The Living Free From Wrong And Right  
The Power Of The Magic The Power Of The Spell  
Not To Serve In Heaven But One Day Rule In Hell  
  
Power The Power The Power  
  
This Powers Greater Than Love And Of Hate  
This Is The Power Of Will And Of Fate  
The Power Of Blood The Triumph Of Steel  
Greater Than The Power Of A Priest Or A Sinner  
The Power To Defy To Fight And Be The Winner  
The Power Of The Demons Spirits I Command  
Always By My Side To Serve The Masters Plan  
  
Power The Power The Power  
  
None Can Fight The Power None Can Fight The Wind  
Secrets Of All Life And Death Are Carried There Within  
Call Out To The Power Of The Darkness And Light  
Have Dominion Of The Earth Be Lord Of All The Night  
Kill All Those Who Stand Against You Look Into Their Eyes  
Drink Their Blood And Laugh As They Pay For All Their Lies  
Piss Upon Their Grave Then Cast A Final Spell  
Fly Into The Night One Day Meet In Hell  
  
Power The Power The Power
