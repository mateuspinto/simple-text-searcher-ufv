I touched with one  
Who made me run  
Away from my own soul  
In this world with its  
Many illusions  
We are moving like mice through a  
Maze  
  
And now I find  
Whats left behind  
Has served to make me whole  
Full of doubt deception and delusion  
Seeking purpose to all earthly days  
  
I search within  
Beneath a skin  
That bears both pleasure and pain  
In a world full of constant confusion  
I will not be a par to the craze  
  
In the Afterlife  
Will dark be bright  
Will cold be warm  
Will the day have no night  
In the Afterlife  
Will the blind have sight  
In the Afterlife  
  
Behind closed eyes  
Some comfort lies  
In knowing the truth never spoken  
Through this world with us  
Hidden conclusion  
Well keep moving like mice through  
A maze  
  
In the Afterlife  
Will dark be bright  
Will cold be warm  
Will the day have no night  
In the Afterlife  
Will the blind have sight  
In the Afterlife  
  
In the Afterlife  
Will dark be bright  
Will cold be warm  
Will the day have no night  
In the Afterlife  
Will the blind have sight  
In the Afterlife
