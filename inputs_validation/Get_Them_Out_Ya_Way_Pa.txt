Aint no shook in em Pyrex pots is hot fiends is cooking em  
Little niggaz hugging the block cops is booking em  
Women hugging they purse when they spot the crook in em  
Back when little J got shot pops was whooping em  
Little noses dripping with snot ock now look at em  
The ghetto got a hook in em now drugs stay pushing em  
Used to throwing dirt in these blunts now its kush in em  
Used to tell these chicks to shut up now hes shooshing em

UGod  
Im seduced by the chrome its a ruthless poem  
It took a little time to get his juices going  
Producers know him as the kid with the Iron Palm  
Righteous hammer examine the firearm  
Approach or get fired on permanent chest scar  
Empire Strikes Back check out the Death Star  
Bless yall wet yall do the impossible  
Where Im from we use dumdums in the arsenal  
Highly sparkable get stretched off the knuckle check  
Known to scuffle I take it to the upper deck  
Universal conquest kung fu buckle vets  
  
In a dufflebag max yo a couple techs  
Give em ear hustle Wu brand we programmed  
Next time we dance it wont be a slow jam  
I fear no man son you get lynched up  
Nigga bitch get Frankenstein stitched up  
  
Chorus  
  
Masta Killa  
Yeah voice skipping off percussion  
Give it to em how they love it slow flow deadly beloved  
All praise the daunting calm yet  
So alarming without a word being spoken  
A thought with no voice just a nod and a look  
The contract was took straight cash off the books  
A major pawn took a Don look hes armed  
With a few black rooks from the heart of the Crook  
Shook ones look while they hung him on Hercules hooks  
They found his body near a shallow brook escaped on foot  
Switched the look up out of state he got the hook up  
The flipped cake thought lighter than the feather  
Yet heavier than weight when my mind state starts to break take cover  
Over RZA instrumental Im damn near invincible its simple  
  
Chorus 2X  
  
Outro kung fu sample  
Tell me what are they like  
They got holes in the top five round holes  
While I was watching this stranger hit them  
But his fingers went right through the bone  
So then theyve mastered it  
Its some style of kung fu you know it  
The Skeleton Claw
