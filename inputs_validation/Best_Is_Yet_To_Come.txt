Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum  
You came along and everythings startin to hum  
Still its a real good bet the best is yet to come  
Best is yet to come and babe wont that be fine  
You think youve seen the sun but you aint seen it shine  
Wait till the warmups underway  
Wait till our lips have met  
And wait till you see that sunshine day  
You aint seen nothin yet  
The best is yet to come and babe wont it be fine  
Best is yet to come come the day youre mine  
Come the day youre mine  
Im gonna teach you to fly  
Weve only tasted the wine  
Were gonna drain the cup dry  
Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround  
You think youve flown before but baby you aint left the ground  
Wait till youre locked in my embrace  
Wait till I draw you near  
Wait till you see that sunshine place  
Aint nothin like it here  
The best is yet to come and babe wont it be fine  
The best is yet to come come the day youre mine  
Come the day youre mine  
And youre gonna be mine
