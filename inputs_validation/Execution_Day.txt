I stare in the mirror my eyes refuse to blink  
Sympathy for me hell I cant even think  
Send for the iceman my temperature is startin to rise  
Ive heard it before n I know the truth from the lies  
  
Chorus  
Is it any wonder heavens racked with thunder  
And all of my dreams go under like the fallin rain  
Execution day execution day execution day execution day execution day  
Execution day  
  
Voices like locusts keep smothering me  
Twisting and turning my senses like a cyclone at sea  
Dont touch me now wont let you crucify me  
You aint no damn jury you cant pass no sentence on me  
  
Chorus  
  
Whose blood on whose hands wheres the promises they preached for this land  
Standin there with bibles clutched in their hand  
Whose blood on whose hands whose blood on whose hands  
Whose blood whose hands  
  
Execution day execution day  
  
Father my hands are shakin I see the light its breakin  
Show me the way to set my soul free I hope it rains on me  
Let it rain on me  
  
Execution day execution day
