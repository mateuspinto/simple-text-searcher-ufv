My ship set sail to Bluebird Island  
And slowly drifted out to sea  
Her silver sails to cross the ocean  
My lovers lonely heart set free  
Then out across the waves the bluebirds came one day  
Out over the silver sea your message brought to me  
To sail my ship of love along the moonlit bay  
And anchor in the harbor of your heart  
The Trade Winds there on Bluebird Island  
Soon dried her lonely tears away  
The treasure eye found broken hearted  
Was locked within my heart to stay  
The Trade Winds there on Bluebird Island  
Soon dried her lonely tears away  
The treasure eye found broken hearted  
Was locked within my heart to stay
