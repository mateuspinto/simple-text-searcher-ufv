Once upon a time not so long ago  
When things were much much simple  
And time would travel slow  
  
There came a righteous stranger  
With a bible in his hand  
To educate the sinner  
And liberate the land  
  
Chorus  
  
The sins of the fathers  
Have visited from old  
In a never ending circle  
Of people bought and sold  
So the wretched of the earth  
Would huddle from the cold  
As a ship of fools go sailing  
On an Ocean black as gold  
  
So come and sit beside me  
And let my tale unfold  
In a land on milk and honey  
Where the truth must not be told  
As men of right and reason  
Let the devil take their soul  
For greed and fame and fortune  
And a river black as gold  
  
Chorus  
  
And all the non believers  
Where hiding from the light  
As a thousand burning crosses  
Were scattered in the night  
The thieves and the vagabonds  
Were sinking in the sand  
As a righteous lord and master  
Stretches out a helping hand  
  
Chorus  
  
And those who had to suffer  
The sick the young the old  
Where sacrifice to fortune  
And left out in the cold  
So with this new arrangement  
The leaders sold their souls  
For bangles beads and baubles  
And a river black as gold  
  
Chorus x2
