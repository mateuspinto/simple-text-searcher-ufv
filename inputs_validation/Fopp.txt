Fopped last night and the night before  
I had to fopp outside and then I went indoors  
Fopped so hard I made the people warm  
They stood back and gave me all the floor  
  
I did the fopp the fopp  
they wouldnt let me stop  
Yeah I was foppin and rockin  
Had the house hoppin  
  
Foppin the way it makes you go everybody was  
Foppin everywhere you go do all your  
Shoppin wiggle to the floor everybody was Foppin  
  
Fopp with me and Ill fopp with you  
Foppin is the brand new thing to do  
Fopped so hard that I lost my shoe  
I fopped so tough they had to make some room  
  
Break your leg dont you fopp your back  
Do your thing dont you give no slack  
Shake your hips and then you turn around  
Well first you fopp it up  
And then you fopp it down  
  
Fopp me right dont you fopp me wrong  
Well be here foppin all night long  
Im too short baby and youre too tall  
But when were foppin that dont mean a thing at all  
  
Foppin the way it makes you go everybody was  
Foppin everywhere you go do all your  
Shoppin wiggle to the floor everybody was Foppin
