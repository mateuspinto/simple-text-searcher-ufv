The night was cold  
And the wind was howling  
I was awaken by the sound  
Of hoof beats pounding  
  
Outside the window  
On the ground  
Our hound dog was growling  
Grey Riders flew across my lawn  
I looked again  
And they all were gone  
  
That voice was calling  
And it cut through the night  
Come on boys let her go  
  
Up on a hill  
They rode in one long column  
They were freezing with the chills  
Of the new day dawning  
  
Their hair long and grey  
They heard just one voice calling  
Grey Riders on the morning sky  
The sun made diamonds  
Of their roadweary eyes  
  
That voice is calling  
And it cut through the night  
Come on boys let her go  
  
The night was cold  
And the wind was howling  
I was awaken by the sound  
Of hoof beats pounding  
  
Outside the window on the ground  
Our hound dog was growling  
Grey Riders flew across my lawn  
I looked again  
And they all were gone  
  
That voice was calling  
And it cut through the night  
Come on boys let her go
