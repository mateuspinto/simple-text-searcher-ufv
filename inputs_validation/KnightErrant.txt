O whither has my lady wandered  
Ill search until I know Ive found her  
One green day she left her wings  
And cut away her childhood strings  
But dropping smiles along the trail  
She left a trace I will not fail  
O whither has my lady wandered  
Ill search until I know Ive found her  
When I catch my sudden maid  
Ill deck her out in lace and jade  
I will take her to her room  
I will take her to her room  
I love her upstairs I love her downstairs  
But I love my ladys chamber  
O whither has my lady wandered  
Ill search until I know Ive found her
