These arms of mine they are lonely  
Lonely and feeling blue these arms of mine  
They are yearning yearning from wanting you  
And if you would let them hold you  
Oh how grateful I will be  
These arms of mine they are burning  
Burning from wanting you these arms of mine  
They are wanting wanting to hold you  
And if you would let them hold you  
Oh how grateful I will be  
Come on now baby  
Come on come on baby now  
Just be my little woman just be my lover  
Oh I need your warmth  
I need your loving arms to hold me tight
