Things get bad times get tough  
Everybody knows  
You gotta be a little stronger  
Just to have the things you need  
Everybody knows  
If you try a little harder  
Youre gonna live a whole lot longer  
  
Had enough of burnin up the midnight hour  
Going out and stayin far too long  
  
Chorus  
You got to believe in something  
When you believe in something  
These are the best of times  
You got to have faith in someone  
When you have faith in someone  
These are the best of times  
  
Dont give up cant give in  
Never lose a minute  
Its a long hard road back from nowhere  
Love is not what you take out  
Its what you put back in it  
Take you chance theres no doubt  
Everything will all work out  
  
See my way I know where Im goin  
I know Id never think that Id ever give up  
I want it all as soon as I can  
Right where I am  
  
Chorus
