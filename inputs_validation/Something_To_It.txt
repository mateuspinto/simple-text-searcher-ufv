Im sorry if I ruined your day  
I really hope that you understand  
Im a million miles away  
Looking for a place to land  
  
My father phoned me yesterday  
Your time has come well done my son  
Tried to think of what to say  
When words can heed already gone  
  
Chorus  
I dont know how I got here  
There must be something to it  
I think I need some time alone  
To work my way through it  
  
The moon is in the sky tonight  
Not very warm but it sheds some light  
Ask me now and I just might  
Let the morning come and tell me if its right  
  
Chorus  
  
Soon initial bliss will pass  
This precious time might be your last  
Like dew upon the morning grass  
Good intentions can vanish with the sun  
  
Im sorry if I ruined your day  
I really hope that you understand  
Im a million miles away  
Looking for a place to land  
Im a million miles away  
Looking for a place to land
