Im just breezin along with the breeze  
Trailing the rails Im a roamin the seas  
Like the birdies that sing in the trees  
Pleasin to live livin to please  
  
The sky is the only roof I have over my head  
And when Im weary mother nature makes me a bed  
Im just goin along as I please  
Breezin along with the breeze  
  
The sky is the only roof I have over my head  
And when Im weary mother nature makes me a bed  
Im just goin along as I please  
Breezin along with the breeze
