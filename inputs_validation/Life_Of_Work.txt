Riding in the saddle  
Henchmen at your side  
Holy macaroni  
Hose you on your back  
  
And the bystanders just stand there  
Like  on a shelf  
In the world of work your rivals  
That you have yet to meet  
And quite a bunch they are  
  
In the morning sun  
With blinking eyes  
The worthless stands  
In readiness  
For transport to  
The battleground  
Theres dirty work  
Ahead of them  
  
And quite a bunch they are  
What do you do with a life of work  
What do you do with a life of work  
What do you do with a life of work  
  
Face it in the morning  
Face it in the morning  
And the parting of the ways  
And the interrupted mirth  
And the shock that has to come  
  
Because of what you want  
Compared to what youve got  
Meet it squarely  
And it only hurts  
When it hurts  
Life of work  
Early in the morning
