Make me a channel of your peace  
Where there is hatred let me bring Your love  
Where there is injury Your pardon Lord  
And where theres doubt true faith in You  
  
Oh Master grant that I may never seek  
So much to be consoled as to console  
To be understood as to understand  
To be loved as to love with all my soul  
  
Make me a channel of your peace  
Where theres despair in life let me bring hope  
Where there is darkness let me bring light  
And where theres sadness bring Your joy  
  
Oh Master grant that I may never seek  
So much to be consoled as to console  
To be understood as to understand  
  
To be loved as to love with all my soul  
  
Make me a channel of your peace  
Where theres despair in life let me bring hope  
Where there is darkness let me bring Your light  
And where theres sadness bring Your joy  
  
Oh Master grant that I may never seek  
So much to be consoled as to console  
To be understood as to understand  
To be loved as to love with all my soul  
  
Make me a channel of your peace  
For when we give we will ourselves receive  
It is in pardoning that we are pardoned  
And in dying that we gain eternal life  
And in dying that we gain eternal life
