When you come across  
The guy who thinks hes boss  
Yet never knows the reason why  
He wont let you pass  
Wont answer things you ask  
Hes got his orders do or die  
  
Chorus  
Someone said to me  
If you tip the doorman heavily  
His doors will open wide for you  
Goes to show what money can do  
Win again lose again  
Dont feel sad when things go bad  
You just do the best you can  
Do the best you can  
  
Please be kind to those  
Who fail to comprehend  
And in time who knows  
Youll maybe make a friend  
  
If you leave your car  
And youre not going far  
Remember what time to be back  
If it slips your mind  
Im sure in time youll find  
A Rita waiting in a mac  
  
Chorus  
  
Win again lose again  
Dont feel sad when things go bad  
You just do the best you can  
Do the best you can  
Do the best you can
