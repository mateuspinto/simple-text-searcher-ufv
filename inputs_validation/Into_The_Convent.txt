Madeleine is running away from herself  
Afraid of shame shes crying out for help  
To be clean again  
  
No one cared and no one ever will  
Her feelings were not shared she wants to break the spell  
and shes going  
  
Into the convent a smile on her face  
Into the darkness to hide all her sins  
Wondering what could go wrong in this place  
  
Welcome Sister Im Your chaplain  
Down on Your knees and pray if You please  
in This convent Im Your master  
Kiss My cross now dearest Sister  
In the Name of  
  
Madeleine is running away from herself  
As father David said  
At communion You must be undressed  
Why did she go  
  
Into the convent a smile on her face  
Into the darkness to hide all her sins  
Wondering what could go wrong in this place  
  
Come along Sister Madeleine  
Unfold Your wildest dreams its time to join and sing  
Let the feast begin  
  
That night she awoke to find The Eye  
On the stone cold floor Why She never ever would knoe why  
But she put it on  
  
Next day father David passed away  
At communion time  
Why he never ever would know why  
But he looked at The Eye  
  
The eye of the necklace is lacking its toll  
Inside the convent a soul will rejoice
