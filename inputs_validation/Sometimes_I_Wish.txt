Dreaming of a love I lost the day the final bridge was crossed  
Sometimes I wish that I could just forget  
But the memory lingers yet and it hangs around  
Leaving me low and leaving me down  
Everywhere I roam there is nobody home  
Even I should know when it aint my day there is no other way  
I begin to wake up how wrong it was to cling to you  
Sometimes I wish to hold you in my heart  
Cause I cant keep us apart forgiving you  
Was the easiest thing that I ever could do  
Everywhere I go there is no one I know  
Even I can see its too late now to believe in a vow  
As I wander I return to days gone by theres much to be learned  
Sometimes I wish that miracles could be  
But at best I fail to see any happening  
Some gotta lose and some gotta win  
Everywhere I roam there is nobody home  
Even I should know when it aint my day there is no other way  
Everywhere I go there is no one I know  
Even I can see its too late now to believe in a vow  
Youre leaving right now
