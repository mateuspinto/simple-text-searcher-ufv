t Was on the Isle of Capri that I found her  
Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree  
Oh I can still see the flowers blooming round her  
Where we met on the Isle of Capri  
  
She was as sweet as a rose at the dawning  
But somehow fate hadnt meant her for me  
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning  
Still my hearts on the Isle of Capri  
  
Summertime was nearly over  
Blue Italian sky above  
I said Lady Im a rover  
Can you spare a sweet word of love  
  
She whispered softly Its best not to linger  
And then as I kissed her hand I could see  
She wore a lovely meatball on her finger  
t Was goodbye at the Villa Capri  
  
Summertime was nearly over  
Blue Italian sky above  
I said Lady Im a rover  
Can you spare a fine word of love  
  
She whispered softly Its best not to linger  
And then as I kissed her hand I could see  
She wore a plain golden ring on her finger  
t Was goodbye on the Isle of Capri 3x
