Francis  
Francis be careful  
  
Trying so hard to keep up with the Joness  
Running a rat racing won by our noses  
Always put one foot in front of the other  
And dance to the beat of the decadent drummer  
  
Just buy a brand new pair of Fred Astaire shoes  
Climbing to the top never gonna stop  
Its the same old song and one two three and decadance  
  
Dance dance  
Dance dance  
Dancing to the decadence dance dance  
Everybody decadancing  
Dancing to the decadence  
Dancing to the decadence dance  
  
Its hard to stop once the music gets started  
til the soles of your feet harden up like your heart did  
Stepping in line with the sign of the timer  
Seduced by the tune of the decadent dancer  
  
Just buy a brand new pair of Fred Astaire shoes  
Climbing to the top never gonna stop  
Its the same old song and one two three and decadance  
  
Dance dance  
Dance dance  
Dancing to the decadence dance dance  
Everybody decadancing  
Dancing to the decadence  
Dancing to the decadence dance
