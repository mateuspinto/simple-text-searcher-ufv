As she walks near me my blood feels the chance  
All spinning and swirling it yearns for the dance  
To become part of me poor one to take part of her  
  
Dont say that tomorrow will bring me her love  
Dont let me wait for words undestined from above  
Let me laugh through her fingers and smile through her hair  
Let me love the one I see for I know that shes there  
For tomorrow and today arent here anymore  
  
Lalalalala  
Sing songs for pennies tip my hat couldnt get many  
All around the city are the troubadours  
  
Lalalalala  
Sing songs for pennies tip my hat couldnt get many  
All around the city see the troubadours  
  
Singing songs sadly sing songs so lonely  
All around the city see the troubadours  
  
As she steps near me my blood feels the chance  
All spinning and whirling it yearns for the dance  
To take part of her fair one  
To know part of her
