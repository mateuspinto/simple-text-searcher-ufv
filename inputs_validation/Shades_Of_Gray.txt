When the world and I were young  
Just yesterday  
Life was such a simple game  
A child could play  
It was easy then to tell right from wrong  
Easy then to tell weak from strong  
When a man should stand and fight  
Or just go along  
  
But today there is no day or night  
Today there is no dark or light  
Today there is no black or white  
Only shades of gray  
  
I remember when the answers seemed so clear  
We had never lived with doubt or tasted fear  
It was easy then to tell truth from lies  
Selling out from compromise  
Who to love and who to hate  
The foolish from the wise  
  
But today there is no day or night  
Today there is no dark or light  
Today there is no black or white  
Only shades of gray  
  
It was easy then to know what was fair  
When to keep and when to share  
How much to protect your heart  
And how much to care  
  
But today there is no day or night  
Today there is no dark or light  
Today there is no black or white  
Only shades of gray  
Only shades of gray
