And I take you down to the burning ground  
And you change me up and you turned it around  
In the wind and rain Im gonna see you again  
In the morning sun and when the day is done  
And you take my hand and you walk with me  
Sometimes it feels like eternity  
And I turn the tide I get back my pride  
And I make you proud wont you say it out loud  
When I take you down to the burning ground  
To the burning ground to the burning ground  
To the burning ground to the burning ground  
  
And I take you down by the factory  
And I show you like it has to be  
And you understand how the work is done  
And I pick up the sack in the midday sun  
And I pull you through by the skin of your teeth  
And I lift the veil I see whats underneath  
And you return to me and you sit on your throne  
And you make me feel that Im not alone  
  
And I take you down to the burning ground  
To the burning ground to the burning ground  
To the burning ground  
  
Hey man whats that youre carrying  
  
Feels like lead  
  
It weighs a ton lets see if we can dump it by the side of the hill  
  
Hey wait up why dont you dump it on the burning ground  
  
Dump it down there  
  
Yeh man dump the Jute  
  
Hey man dump the Jute on the burning ground  
  
Dump the Jute  
  
Yeh you know dump the Jute  
  
Dump the Jute  
  
On the burning ground  
On the burning ground  
And you make me think what its all about  
Sometimes I know gonna work it out  
And I watch you run in the crimson sun  
Tear my shirt apart open up my heart  
And I watch you run  
Down on your bended knees  
By the burnt out well  
Can you tell me please  
Between heaven and hell  
Wont you take me down  
  
To the burning ground to the burning ground  
To the burning ground to the burning ground  
  
And you fall and pray when you hear that sound  
As were walking back to the burial mound  
And you shake your head and you turn it around  
And you see the flames from the burning ground  
And you get down on your knees and pray  
And I catch my breath as were running away  
And I take the Jute and I throw him down  
  
On the burning ground on the burning ground  
On the burning ground its on the burning ground
