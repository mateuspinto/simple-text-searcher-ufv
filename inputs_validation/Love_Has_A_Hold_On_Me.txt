I have found a perfect mystery  
Love has a hold on me  
Long before my life had come to be  
Love had a hold on me  
Love has a hold on me  
  
Where do I come from  
Where does life mean  
Is it not to know the one who made me  
  
As Im looking down the road ahead  
Love has a hold on me  
Someday when I breathe my dying breath  
Love has a hold on me  
Love has a hold on me  
  
Where will I go  
When this life is through  
Back into the light that made me and you  
  
Love has a hold on me  
Something opened up my eyes to see  
Love has a hold on me  
Love has a hold on me  
  
I dont have answers to all the questions  
Running inside of my mind  
But I cant help believe that  
Understanding comes in time  
  
Love has a hold on me  
Something opened up my eyes to see  
Love has a hold on me  
Love has a hold on me  
  
If I run if I hide I know inside  
Your love has a hold on me  
Tell me yes tell me no my heart will follow  
Your love has a hold on me  
  
If I run if I hide  
Your love has a hold on me  
Your love has a hold on me  
Your love has a hold on me  
Hold on me
