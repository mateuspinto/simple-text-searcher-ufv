We met in a place I used to go  
Now I just walk by it for show  
Cant bear to go in without you now  
Wish I could  
Wish I could  
  
But Annie is standing in the door  
With a look on her face I cant just ignore  
She tells me that her heart is sore  
And pulls me in  
She pulls me in  
  
She says love in the time of war is not fair  
He was my man but they didnt care  
Sent him far away from here  
No goodbye  
No goodbye  
  
I dont tell her that I once loved you too  
Or about all the things we used to do  
I kiss her hair and think of you  
Walking down  
The road you found  
  
We met in a place I used to go  
Now I only walk by it slow  
Cant bear to go in without you now  
Wish I could Repeat x4
