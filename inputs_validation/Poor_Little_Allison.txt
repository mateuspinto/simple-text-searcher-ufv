Poor little Allison standing in the night wind  
Laughing out loud turning her face to the summer rain  
Poor little Allison never had much going  
Hard to forget always in step with the world shes in  
Never knowing never feeling showing so much pride  
Never saying what shes thinking or feeling deep inside  
Poor little Allison dreaming of the right one  
Laughing out loud lost in a crowd of fair weather friends  
Never knowing never feeling showing so much pride  
Never saying what shes thinking or feeling deep inside  
Poor little Allison standing in the night wind  
Wishing out loud turning her face to the summer rain  
Hard to forget always in step with the world shes in
