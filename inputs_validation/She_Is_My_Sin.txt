Take heed dear heart  
Once apart she can touch nor me nor you  
Dressed as one  
A wolf will betray a lamb  
  
Lead astray the gazers  
The razors on your seducing skin  
In the meadow of sinful thoughts  
Every flowers perfect  
  
To paradise with pleasure haunted by fear  
  
A sin for him  
Desire within  
A burning veil  
For the bride too dear for him  
A sin for him  
Desire within  
Fall in love with your deep dark sin  
  
I am the Fallen  
You are what my sins enclose  
Lust is not as creative  
As its discovery  
  
To paradise with pleasure haunted by fear  
  
A sin for him  
  
Bless me undress me  
Pick your prey in a wicked way  
God I must confess  
I do envy the sinners
