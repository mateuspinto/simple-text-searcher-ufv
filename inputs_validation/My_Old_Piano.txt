Love is called  
My old piano  
I have a ball  
With my old piano  
  
My baby entertains  
The real life of my parties  
But still retains  
In all the dignity  
His international style  
Exudes an air of royalties  
His eighty eight key smile  
Is so pleasant to see  
  
Love is called  
My old piano  
I have a ball  
With my old piano  
  
Chorus  
My old keyboard  
Wont stand for a corner  
He demands the middle of the room  
Your heart dissolves  
While he tips you so gracefully  
Till youre involved  
In a baby grand affair  
  
Love is called  
My old piano  
I have a ball  
With my old piano  
  
He entertains  
The real life of my parties  
But still retains  
In all the dignity  
His international style  
Exudes an air of royalties  
His eighty eight key smile  
Is so pleasant to see  
  
Chorus  
  
Love is called  
My old piano  
I have a ball  
With my old piano
