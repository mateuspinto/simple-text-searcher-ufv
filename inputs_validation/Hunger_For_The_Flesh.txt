Spare a thought for the souls  
Who cannot leave this earth  
The attachments bind so tightly not a chance  
Not a chance of a new birth  
The river gently beckons  
But the answer is no  
Gripping their illusions  
They cannot let them go  
Hunger for the flesh  
Leads them to a weaker heart  
Mortals who imprisoned themselves  
Let them have a new start  
Wishing to hold onto life and all its games  
Singing their lament song  
Holding back the change  
They came here for to dance  
To learn and not to cling  
Holding onto life  
As if it were the important thing  
Hunger for the flesh  
Hunger for security  
Caught up in the mesh  
Caught up for eternity  
Hunger for the flesh  
Hunger for security  
Caught up in the mesh  
Caught up for eternity  
The river gently beckons  
But the answer is no  
Gripping their illusions  
They cannot let them go  
Hunger for the flesh  
Leads them to a weaker heart  
Mortals who imprison themselves  
Let them have a new start  
Let them have a new start  
Hunger for the flesh  
Hunger for security  
Caught up in the mesh  
Caught up for eternity  
Hunger for the flesh  
Hunger for security  
Caught up in the mesh  
Holding back the change
