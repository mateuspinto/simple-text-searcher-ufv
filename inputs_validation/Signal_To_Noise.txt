You know the way that things go  
When what you fight for starts to fall  
And in that fuzzy picture  
The writing stands out on the wall  
So clearly on the wall  
  
Send out the signals deep and loud  
  
And in this place can you reassure me  
With a touch a smile  while the cradles burning  
All the while the world is turning to noise  
Oh the more that its surrounding us  
The more that it destroys  
Turn up the signal  
Wipe out the noise  
  
Send out the signal deep and loud  
  
Man Im losing sound and sight  
Of all those who can tell me wrong from right  
When all things beautiful and bright  
Sink in the night  
Yet theres still something in my heart  
That can find a way  
To make a start  
To turn up the signal  
Wipe out the noise  
  
Wipe out the noise  
Wipe out the noise  
You know thats it  
You know thats it  
You know thats it  
Receive and transmit  
Receive and transmit  
Receive and transmit  
You know thats it  
You know thats it  
Receive and transmit  
You know thats it  
You know thats it  
Receive and transmit
