Walter Afanasieff John Bettis  
  
Here they come  
Every night the same  
Silent stars  
Light from a distant flame  
Just like the memories of you  
That I hold inside  
I see you touch  
But all the warmth has died  
  
Empty rooms  
Crowded by the past  
Time is my enemy  
Days keep moving faster  
But the nights alone can be  
An eternity  
That never heals the scars  
Of foolish pride  
  
If only you could see me now  
Goodbye is not so easy now  
The freedom that I walked away to gain  
Is nothing but these chains  
That you alone can break  
And you would free me now  
Your heart would come undone  
Just looking at me once  
And my love would bring you back  
If only you could see me now  
  
Here I am  
Stranger to a smile  
Trying to fight the tears  
Missing by a mile  
Im not the one who laughed at you  
On that yesterday  
When you warned me not to throw your love away  
  
If you could only see me now  
Goodbye is not so easy now  
The freedom that I walked away to gain  
Is nothing but these chains  
I know your heart would break  
If you could hear me now  
Your heart would come undone  
If you could hear me once  
Hoping love will bring you back  
If only you could see me now  
  
Bridge  
  
Like the lonely moon  
You see above  
That sails the dark alone  
Forever  
I have no light of my own  
Other the love weve known  
So long ago  
Together  
  
If you could feel me now  
Your heart would come undone  
If you could touch me once  
I know love will bring you back  
If only you could see me now
