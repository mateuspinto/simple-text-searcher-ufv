Why do you run answer me  
Who do you follow talk to me  
What is the hidden that I cannot see  
What is the prize you try to hide from me  
  
I see you dying and I listen listen  
And I listen listen  
Listen to the flies  
Listen to the flies  
  
Who is the idol you obey  
Give me a reason youre afraid of me  
Youd never been punished or never had pride  
I see you circle round and round the shite  
  
I see you dying  
I see you dying  
  
And I listen to the flies  
And I listen to the flies  
And I listen to the flies  
And I listen to the flies  
  
Why do you run answer me  
Who do you follow talk to me  
What is the hidden that I cannot see  
What is the prize you try to hide from me  
  
I see you dying  
I see you dying  
And I listen to the flies  
And I listen to the flies  
  
And I listen to the flies  
And I listen to the flies  
And I listen to the flies  
And I listen to the flies
