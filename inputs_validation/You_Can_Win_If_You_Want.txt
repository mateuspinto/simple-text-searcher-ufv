You packed your things in a carpetbag  
Left and never looking back  
Rings on your fingers paint on your toes  
Music wherever you go  
You dont fit in a smalltown world  
But I feel youre the girl for me  
Rings on your fingers paint on your toes  
Youre leaving town where nobody knows  
  
You can win if you want  
If you want it you will win  
On your way you will see that life is more than fantasy  
Take my hand follow me  
Oh youve got a brand new friend for your life  
  
You can win if you want  
If you want it you will win  
Oh come on take a chance for a brand new wild romance  
Take my hand for the night  
And your feelings will be right hold me tight  
  
Oh darkness finds you on your own  
Endless highways keep on rolling on  
Youre miles and miles from your home  
But you never want to phone your home  
A steady job and a nice young man  
Your parents had your future planned  
Rings on your finger paint on your toes  
Thats the way your story goes
