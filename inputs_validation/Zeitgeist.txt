Astral engines in reverse  
Im falling through the universe again  
Down among a dead mans vision  
Faded dreams and nuclear fissions span  
  
The strings of fear they are holding up the race  
The puppets falling to the ground  
The love I feel as I fly endlessly through space  
Lost in time I wonder will my ship be found  
  
On this sinking ship I travel  
Faster than the speed of life  
Not so super nova burns  
The black holes turn and fade from sight  
  
The strings of fear they hide within the human race  
The answers buried underground  
The love I feel as I fly endlessly through space  
Lost in time I wonder will my ship be found  
  
And very soon  
The boundless moon  
Will show us light  
And as we crash  
Well pray and kiss  
And say goodnight  
Goodnight
