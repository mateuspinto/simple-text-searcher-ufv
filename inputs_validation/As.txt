As around the sun the earth knows shes revolving  
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may  
Just as hate knows loves the cure  
You can rest your mind assure  
That Ill be loving you always  
  
As now cant reveal the mystery of tomorrow  
But in passing will grow older every day  
Just as all thats born is new  
You know what I say is true  
That Ill be loving you always  
  
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky  
Always  
Until the ocean covers every mountain high  
Always  
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea  
Always  
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream  
  
Did you know that true love asks for nothing  
No no her acceptance is the way we pay  
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee  
To last through forever and another day  
  
Just as time knew to move on since the beginning  
And the seasons know exactly when to change  
Just as kindness knows no shame  
Know through all your joy and pain  
That Ill be loving you always  
  
As today I know Im living  
But tomorrow could make me the past  
But that I mustnt fear  
For Ill know deep in my mind  
The love of me Ive left behind  
Cause Ill be loving you always  
  
Until the day is night and night becomes the day  
Always  
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away  
Always  
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four  
Always  
Until the day that is the day that are no more  
Did you know youre loved by somebody  
Until the day the earth starts turnin right to left  
Always  
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself  
Ill be lovin you forever  
Until dear mother nature says her work is through  
Always  
Until the day that you are me and I am you  
Always  
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky  
Until the ocean severs every mountain high  
Always mm mm  
  
We all know sometimes life hates and troubles  
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space  
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice its double  
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed  
So make sure when you say youre in it but not of it  
Youre not helpin to make this earth  
A place sometimes called hell  
Change your words into truths  
And then change that truth into love  
And maybe our childrens grandchildren  
And their great grandchildren will tell  
Ill be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
