In the middle of Hollywood Boulevard  
Screaming at each other screaming at each other  
Like oh oh oh cant take it anymore  
Like a tragedy like a dark comedy  
Laughing at each other laughing at each other  
Like oh oh oh it isnt funny anymore  
  
I was the man who never lied  
I never lied until today  
But I just couldnt break your heart  
Like you did mine yesterday  
I was the man who never lied oh  
I was the man who never lied oh yeah  
  
Sometimes honesty is the worst policy  
Happy ever after happy ever after  
Let it go you never need to know  
I dont wanna be picking up all of these  
Tiny little pieces tiny little pieces  
Of your heart wont do it anymore  
  
I was the man who never lied  
I never lied until today  
But I just couldnt break your heart  
Like you did mine yesterday  
I was the man who never lied oh  
I was the man who never lied oh  
  
I was the  
Yeah yeah oh oh  
  
In the middle of Hollywood Boulevard  
What am I doing in Hollywood Boulevard  
In the middle of Hollywood Boulevard  
Screaming at each other screaming  
  
I was the man who never lied  
I never lied until today  
But I just couldnt break your heart  
Like you did mine yesterday  
  
I was the man who never lied  
Never lied until today  
But I just couldnt break your heart  
Like you did mine yesterday  
I was the man who never lied oh oh I was the man  
I was the man who never lied oh yeah I was the man oh yeah
