Trees that grow without ground  
Young leaves that fall in spring  
Ground hogs tell me play games  
My games would reel the world  
Ring around the pine tree  
Smile a game around the sunsweep  
Cry a game across the moonbeam  
Across the earthbound gypsy  
Flowers build a green wall  
Blue flowers bloom in sand  
People tell me play games  
My games would reel the world  
Ring around the seaweed  
Ring your name around the sunsweep  
Cry your name across the moonbeam  
Tell the earthbound gypsy  
Play your gypsy game in my world  
Give your magic word to the people  
Who live in the underground world without sun  
In the world without moonbeams  
The village down deep without  
Purple leaves that seem red  
Grape vines that smile in fall  
Zebras tell me play games  
My games would spill the world  
Ring around the bean tree  
Jump a game around the sunsweep moonbeam  
Magic earthbound gypsy  
Jump the fence  
Play your gypsy game in my world  
Give your magic word to the people  
Who live in the underground world without sun  
In the world without moonbeams  
The village down deep without  
Purple leaves that seem red  
Grape vines that smile in fall  
Zebras tell me play games  
My games would spill the world  
Ring around the bean tree  
Jump a game around the sunsweep moonbeam  
Magic earthbound gypsy  
Jump the fence  
Hah
