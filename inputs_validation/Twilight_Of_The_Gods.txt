Weve thrown away our former gods  
Controlling our day  
We have created better ones  
So we control the way  
  
We are the ones with the power  
To hold down the enemy  
Our gods are perfection  
And they are protecting our lives  
We still need some more of them  
To be safe from the other side  
As long as were stronger  
Nothing will happen to us  
  
Fireflash in the night  
Just an evil dream  
Holy war in the sky never  
  
Error in store 103  
We watch the sun at night  
The pretty gods weve built ourselves  
Now terminate our lives  
  
Silicon brain powered voices  
Are crying attack tonight  
In anger burning our world  
Doomsday has come  
And there is no place to hide away  
The future is over  
And there is no turning back  
  
Fireflash in the night  
Now reality  
Holy war in the sky  
  
Chorus  
Twilight of the gods  
Insanias dead and gone  
Another world was born  
But the twilight soon will come  
  
Fireflash in the night  
Now reality  
Holy war in the sky  
  
Chorus
