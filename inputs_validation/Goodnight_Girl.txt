You can hear me so clearly  
And see how I try  
You feel me so heal me  
And tear me apart  
  
I wont tell a soul  
I wont tell at all  
Do they have to know  
About my goodnight girl  
  
Caught up in your wishin well  
You hopes inside it  
Take your love and promises  
And make them last  
  
You keep me so near you  
And see me so far  
And hold me and send me  
And deep in your heart  
  
It doesnt matter how sad  
I made you  
Doesnt matter how hard  
I try  
  
Just remember the same  
Old reason  
Reflected in your eyes  
You said you wanted me  
  
Caught up in your wishin well  
Your hopes inside it  
Take your love and promises  
And make them last
