Chorus  
Oh the ways of the world and the wants of a woman  
If I figured them all out twould take many years  
  
I once had a sweetheart the fairest of maidens  
She out shined all others that Id known by far  
I had a friend a big fella named big Harlan Taylor  
Harlan had a rubbertired new shiny car  
  
Chorus  
  
By the wants of a woman she fell for big Harlan  
I tried but in vain for to take my own life  
Suddenly I had lost all my will to keep livin  
She lost her desire to become my young wife  
  
Chorus  
  
I wanted revenge and waylaid for big Harlan  
Then I started wonderin what good would it do  
If a rubbertired new shiny cars her ambition  
Then she can just have it and big Harlan too  
  
Chorus  
  
If I figured them all out
