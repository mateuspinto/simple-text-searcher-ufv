Im not how I used to be  
When we hung around  
Back when it was you and me  
Tearin up this town  
We used to live our lives running from change  
Now we dont see eye to eye  
I am not the same  
  
Chorus  
And you wonder where Ive gone  
Well Ive found where I belong  
Im on the other side  
True I used to walk your shore  
But Im not there anymore  
Im on the other side  
  
Years fade like the setting sun  
Turning us loose  
They give us many ways to run  
And many roads to choose  
Well I ran into saving grace  
Headed for nowhere  
Love showed me another place  
And brought me there  
  
Chorus  
  
Why is it hard for you to see  
All the changes made in me  
Here on the other side  
Oh I could help you understand  
And you could join me where I am  
I am on the other side
