My lifes on time but again my sense is late  
Feel a might unsteady but I still have to play  
Six to ones the odds and we have the highest stakes  
And once again I gamble with my very life today  
Highly polished metal the oil makes it gleam  
Fill the terror chamber your mind begins to scream  
Your life is like a trigger never troubled till youre squeezed  
Now you crack a smile as you give the gun a tease  
Place the pistol down now give the gun a spin  
Soon as the spinning stops oh no the game starts in  
A hateful way of vengeance a bit of playful sin  
Load another bullets now the second round begins  
A couple grains of power a couple grams of lead  
A touch against the trigger a touch inside the head  
Take another drink and raise the last bets  
Think about my last words they might be what I just said  
A click comes from the hammer that couldnt drive a nail  
Sense the numbing cold blue or the red of Hades grill  
A fraction of a second do you lose or maybe still  
Pass it to the left and collect your mighty kill  
Add another bullet the third round begins  
Soon as the spinning stops oh no the game starts in  
Please no IOUs no markers for death  
Does anybody play Anybody Somebody Anybody play  
You you Next victim You next to die  
You you Next victim You next to die  
You come on Next victim Your turn to die  
You come on Next victim Your turn to die
