These are the eyes that cant see me  
These are the hands that drop your trust  
These are the boots that kick you around  
This is the tongue that speaks on the inside  
These are the ears that ring with hate  
This is the face thatll never change  
This is the fist that grinds you down  
This is the voice of silence no more  
  
These are the legs in circles run  
This is the beating youll never know  
These are the lips that taste no freedom  
This is the feel thats not so safe  
This is the face youll never change  
This is the God that aint so pure  
This is the God that is not pure  
This is the voice of silence no more  
  
We the people  
Are we the people x2  
  
Some kind of monster  
Some kind of monster  
Some kind of monster  
This monster lives  
  
This is the face that stones you cold  
This is the moment that needs to breathe  
These are the claws that scratch these wounds  
This is the pain that never leaves  
This is the tongue that whips you down  
This is the burden of every man  
These are the screams that pierce your skin  
This is the voice of silence no more  
  
This is the test of flesh and soul  
This is the trap that smells so good  
This is the flood that drains these eyes  
These are the looks that chill to the bone  
These are the fears that swing over head  
These are the weights that hold you down  
This is the end that will never end  
This is the voice of silence no more  
  
We the people  
Are we the people x2  
  
Some kind of monster  
Some kind of monster  
Some kind of monster  
This monster lives  
  
This is the cloud that swallows trust  
This is the black that uncolors us  
This is the face that you hide from  
This is the mask that comes undone  
  
Ominous  
Im in us x4  
  
This is the cloud that swallows trust  
This is the black that uncolors us  
This is the face that you hide from  
This is the mask that comes undone  
  
Ominous  
Im in us x4  
  
Are we the people  
  
Some kind of monster  
Some kind of monster  
Some kind of monster   
The monster lives
