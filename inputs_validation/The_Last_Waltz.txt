I wondered should I go or should I stay  
The band had only one more song to play  
And then I saw you out the corner of my eye  
A little girl alone and so shy  
  
I had the last waltz with you  
Two lonely people together  
I fell in love with you  
The last waltz should last forever  
  
But the love we had was going strong  
Through the good and bad we get along  
And then the flame of love died in your eye  
My heart was broke in two when you said goodbye  
  
I had the last waltz with you  
Two lonely people together  
I fell in love with you  
The last waltz should last forever  
  
Its all over now nothing left to say  
Just my tears and the orchestra playing  
  
La la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la la  
  
I had the last waltz with you  
Two lonely people together  
I fell in love with you  
The last waltz should last forever  
  
La la la la la la la la la
