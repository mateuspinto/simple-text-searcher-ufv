Chorus  
Better is one day in Your courts  
Better is one day in Your house  
Better is one day in Your courts  
Than thousands elsewhere  
  
Verse  
Surrounded by Your glory what will my heart feel  
Will I dance for You Jesus or in awe of You be still  
Will I stand in your presence or to my knees will I fall  
Will I sing Hallelujah will I be able to speak at all  
I can only imagine  
  
Tag  
The enemy has been defeated  
Death couldnt hold You down  
Were gonna lift our voice in victory  
Were gonna make your praises loud  
  
Shout unto God with a voice of triumph  
Shout unto God with a voice of praise  
Shout unto God with a voice of triumph  
We lift your name up  
We lift you name up  
  
Ending  
Better is one day  
Better is one day  
Better is one day  
Than thousands elsewhere
