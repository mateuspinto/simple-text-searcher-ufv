When she walked in the room  
You could faint from the strong perfume  
And she said her name was Libertine  
In my ear a voice said dont be a fool stay clear  
Better stay away from Libertine  
Stay away from Libertine  
Stay away from Libertine  
Stay away from Libertine  
So I stayed out of view  
But my eyes couldnt come unglued  
I was hypnotized by Libertine  
So in time I broke down and I lost my mind  
Then I made a move on Libertine  
Stay away from Libertine  
Made a move on Libertine  
Stay away from Libertine  
I made my move on Libertine  
And I waited all night  
Til the timing was right  
For another man was reaching for her hand  
But he went to the phone  
And when I got her alone  
It just wasnt the same  
Tell me whats in a name  
She made me drunk with her charms  
Then she left on her husbands arm  
And I got the shaft from Libertine  
I was weak and I know just from whence I speak  
Better stay away from Libertine  
Stay away from Libertine
