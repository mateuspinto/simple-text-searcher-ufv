I been walking  
Wherefore am I walking  
I been walking  
  
If you see me walking  
Awalking awalking  
If you see me walking  
  
Dont avert your eyes  
Dont turn away  
Dont turn away  
Im coming to you  
Ohoh oh oh  
Ohoh oh to you  
  
Living in steps  
Till I can rest  
Living in steps  
Till Im blessed by you  
  
I and I alone  
Can but do for you  
To twist in my hand  
The thorn of thy youth  
To draw thy seed  
To turn in birth  
Thy sighs  
Living in steps  
Thy moans  
Till we can rest  
Living in steps  
Till Im by you  
  
All I ever wanted  
  
I and I alone  
I will wash your feet  
And dry them with my hair  
I will give to you  
Every other tear  
Thy breath thy spear  
Thy season of mirth  
Seven steps  
Until I can rest  
Seven steps  
Til I am blessed by you  
All I ever wanted  
I wanted I wanted  
All I ever wanted  
I wanted for you  
  
Ohwowo  
Ohwowo  
All I ever wanted  
I wanted for you  
  
Five steps  
Till I can rest  
Five steps  
Till Im blessed by you  
  
Four steps  
Till I can rest  
Four steps  
Till Im blessed by you  
  
All I ever wanted  
I wanted I wanted  
All I ever wanted  
I wanted for you  
  
I and I alone  
Ghost of thy ghost  
Walk I will walk  
A burning stem  
To illume thy night  
Three steps  
Blood of my blood  
Bone of my bone  
Three steps  
Can but do for you  
I and I alone  
  
Two steps  
Till I can rest  
Two steps  
Till Im blessed by you  
  
Oh oh oh  
Can but do for you  
I and I alone  
Oh oh oh
