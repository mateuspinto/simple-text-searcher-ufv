Sail across the universe  
All the magic here on earth  
Slipping and sliding  
Rolling and riding to you my love  
Summer breeze reminded me love was wild and love was free  
Love was wilde and love was free  
Memories were hiding  
Baby come riding to me  
  
Wild wild water  
Brings me back to you over and over  
Wild wild water  
Babe still missing you over and over  
  
Wild wild water  
Freeze the wind in summersky  
Wild wild water  
Expect that love that just wont die  
  
Silverwater evening tide  
Brings that girl back to my side  
Slipping and sliding  
Rolling and writing to you my love  
You will be coming back some day  
True we gonna come what may  
Memories were hiding  
Baby come home riding to me
