Yeah  
  
You get under my skin  
When Im next to you  
You get over  
Every little thing you do I  
  
I was thinking that you never tried to hurt me  
Never wanted something from me tried to warn me  
But you didnt really want me but I want you  
Cause you haunt me and I felt it from the start  
  
Youre going to break my heart  
So I tried to play the part  
And I knew I had to choose  
Ive got nothing left to lose  
Might as well just tell the truth  
  
Chorus  
  
You get under my skin  
When Im next to you  
You get over  
Every little thing you do  
I cant get with it  
Cant put the blame on you  
Cause you get under my skin  
I cant get over you  
  
I was hoping I was dreaming that Id wake up  
Think about it and I found that I had made up  
But my heartbeat tells me its not true I want you  
Gotta have you tell me why cant we just start  
  
Bridge  
  
You want to break my heart  
Now youre underneath my skin  
And I feel like its a sin  
To let love walk away so fast  
Im not your first wont be your last  
  
Chorus  
  
Intermediate  
  
Get up get over get under  
Oh baby you hit me like thunder  
Get over get under get into  
To love you is almost a sin to  
repeat  
  
Start  
Bridge  
Chorus  
intermediate  
Chorus  
  
Get get over  
Get get over  
Get over  
  
Get get over  
Get get over
