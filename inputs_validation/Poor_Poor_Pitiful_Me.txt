Well I lay my head on the railroad tracks  
Waitin for the double E  
But railroad dont run no more  
Poor poor pitiful me  
  
Poor poor pitiful me  
Poor poor pitiful me  
These young girls wont let me be  
Lord have mercy on me  
Woe is me  
  
Well I met a girl in west holywood  
I aint namin names  
She really worked me over good  
She was just like Jesse James  
She really worked me over good  
She was a credit to her gender  
She put me through some changes lord  
Sort of like a Waring blender  
  
Poor poor pitiful me  
Poor poor pitful me  
These young girls wont let me be  
Lord have mercy on me  
Woe is me  
  
Whoo  
  
Poor poor pitiful me  
Poor poor pitiful me  
These young girls wont let me be  
Lord have mercy on me  
Woe is me  
  
Well O met a girl at the rainbow bar  
She asked me if Id beat her  
And she took me back to the Hyatt house  
I dont want to talk about it  
  
Poor poor pitiful me  
Whoo  
Poor poor pitiful me  
Hot little mammafaint  
Poor poor pitiful me  
Whoo hoo  
Poor pitiful me
