I heard church bells ringing  
I heard a choir singing  
I saw my love walk down the aisle  
On her finger he placed a ring oh oh  
  
I saw them holding hands  
She was standing there with my man  
I heard them promise til death do us part  
Each word was a pain in my heart  
  
Oh All I could do all I could do was cry  
All I could do was cry  
I was losing the man that I loved  
and all I could do was cry  
  
And now the wedding is over  
rice has been thrown over their heads  
For them life has just begun but mine is at an end  
  
Oh All I could do all I could do was cry  
All I could do was cry  
I was losing the man that I loved  
And all I could do was cry
