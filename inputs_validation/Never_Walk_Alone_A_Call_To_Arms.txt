Hiding in any doorway  
In any shadow  
Any place where danger  
Waits to kill my time  
There is one who lies in wait  
To seal your fate  
As sure as you live and die  
Live and die  
Live and die  
  
Chorus  
When you feel that somethings wrong  
Ill shelter you and keep you warm  
Ill never let you walk alone  
I loved you when you still hated me  
Im comin and it wont be long  
Time to reap what I have sewn  
Never ever let you walk alone  
I know your enemy  it once was me  
  
Let me wrap my arms all around you  
Suffer the trespasses that you made  
I will drink your pain away  
Forever and a day  
If you just call out my name  
If you just call  
Call my name  
If you just call  
Even whisper it  
  
Chorus x 3
