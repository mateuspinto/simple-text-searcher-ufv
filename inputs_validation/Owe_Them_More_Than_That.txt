Old Hank was a drifter passing through  
He stayed long enough to cry the blues  
Acquainted with the bottle  
He knew the good Lord too  
Hank was drifter passing through  
  
Lefty was an oil riggers son  
He felt every word he ever sung  
And when it came to singin Lord  
He showed them how its done  
Old Lefty was an oil riggers son  
  
They broke the ground  
On the road that we go down today  
Like a train whistle passing  
Their voices are starting to fade  
There are some who sing their praises  
Others tip their hats  
But it seems like we owe em more than that  
  
Marty painted pictures with a song  
El Paso made the whole world sing along  
With the story of Felina and the cowboy in her arms  
Marty painted pictures with a song  
  
Waylon was the outlaw of our time  
Not afraid to lay it on the line  
He went against the grain  
And he always spoke his mind  
Waylon was the outlaw of our time  
  
They broke the ground  
On the road that we go down today  
Like a train whistle passing  
Their voices are starting to fade  
There are some who sing their praises  
Others tip their hats  
But it seems like we owe em more than that  
  
There are some who sing their praises  
Others tip their hats  
But it seems like we owe em more than that  
But it seems like we owe em more than that  
We all know we owe em more than that  
  
Yeah we do
