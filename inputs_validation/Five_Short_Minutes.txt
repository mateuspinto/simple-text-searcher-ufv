Well she was standing by my dressing room after the show  
Asking for my autograph and asked if she could go  
Back to my motel room But the rest is just a tragic tale  
Because five short minutes of lovin  
Done brought me twenty long years in jail  
  
Well like a fool in a hurry I took her to my room  
She casted me in plaster while I sang her a tune  
Then I said Ooh ooee Sure was a tragic tale  
Because five short minutes of lovin  
Done brought me twenty long years in jail  
  
Well then a judge and a jury sat me in a room  
They say that robbin the cradle is worse than robbin the tomb  
Then I said Ooh ooee Sure was a tragic tale  
Wasnt worth it wasnt worth it  
Because five short minutes of lovin  
Done brought me twenty long years in jail  
  
And when I get out of this prison gonna be fortyfive  
Ill know I used to like to do it but I wont remember why  
Wasnt worth it wasnt worth it  
Ill say Ooh ooee Sure was a tragic tale  
Because five short minutes of lovin  
Done brought me twenty long years in jail  
  
Because five short minutes of lovin  
Done brought me twenty long years in jail
