The spirit of Christmas is the spirit of love  
Still there when the innocence has gone  
But we have each other we laugh and we cry  
The cares of the world still carry on  
Yes I believe in a better world  
And like the rest of us I pray  
For peace on this earth and a better life  
With every beautiful day  
I once met a holy man who showed me the way  
The road to tranquility at last  
The more he was listening the more he would say  
With the tales of the days of future passed  
He said Yes I believe in a better world  
And like the rest of us I try  
To hold on to hope for a better life  
With every day that goes by  
And if we dare to dream of paradise unseen  
It might come true and if you stand by me  
I swear with all my heart Ill stand by you  
Yes I believe in a better world  
A world where my sisters can be free  
And I have a place in my brothers heart  
For everybody to see  
I dream of my destiny my days in the sun  
To live in the garden of our love  
I search for some happiness I search for my soul  
I pray for some strength from God above  
Yes I believe in a better world  
And like the rest of us I pray  
For peace on this earth and a better life  
With every beautiful day with every beautiful day
