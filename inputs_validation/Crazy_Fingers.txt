Your rain falls like crazy fingers  
Peals of fragile thunder keeping time  
Recall the days that still are to come some sing blue  
Hang your heart on laughing willow stray  
Down to the water deep sea of love  
Beneath the sweet calm face of the sea swift undertow  
  
Life may be sweeter for this I dont know  
See how it feels in the end  
May lady lullaby sing plainly for you soft strong sweet and true  
Cloud hands reaching from a rainbow tapping at the window touch your hair  
So swift and bright strange figures of light float in air  
  
Who can stop what must arrive now something new is waiting to be born  
Dark as the night youre still by my side shine inside   
Gone are the days we stopped to decide where we should go we just ride  
Gone are the broken eyes we saw through in dreams gone both dream and lie  
  
Life may be sweeter for this I dont know  
Feels like it might be all right  
While lady lullaby sings plainly through you love still rings true  
Never could reach it just slips away but I try
