Imagine the love  
Of a child for his toys  
The love of a bird  
For its mate  
Imagine the love  
Of a miser for gold  
Then imagine a love  
Twice as great  
If you multiply each love  
A million times more  
It wont be half the love  
That a mother has for  
Baby shoes baby shoes  
Mother will never forget them  
You have forgotten  
When your feet were bare  
Mother remembers  
She still has a pair  
Of baby shoes baby shoes  
To keep them  
The world shed refuse  
If she had to choose  
Her life she would lose  
Before shed part with her  
Babys shoes  
Baby shoes baby shoes  
Mother will never forget them  
You have forgotten  
When your feet were bare  
Mother remembers  
She still has a pair  
Of baby shoes baby shoes  
To keep them  
The world shed refuse  
If she had to choose  
Her life she would lose  
Before shed part with her  
Babys shoes  
  
Alone in the attic  
She fondles those shoes  
And wonders  
Where her boy has gone  
And over his shoes  
She is saying a prayr  
That the good Lord  
Will keep him from harm  
In her heart  
There is gladness  
Tho her eyes are wet  
Because Mother remembers  
Tho you may forget  
Baby shoes baby shoes  
Mother will never forget them  
You have forgotten  
When your feet were bare  
Mother remembers  
She still has a pair  
Of baby shoes baby shoes  
To keep them  
The world shed refuse  
If she had to choose  
Her life she would lose  
Before shed part with her  
Babys shoes  
Baby shoes baby shoes  
Mother will never forget them  
You have forgotten  
When your feet were bare  
Mother remembers  
She still has a pair  
Of baby shoes baby shoes  
To keep them  
The world shed refuse  
If she had to choose  
Her life she would lose  
Before shed part with her  
Babys shoes
