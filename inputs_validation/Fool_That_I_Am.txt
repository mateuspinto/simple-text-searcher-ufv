Fool that I am  
For falling in love with you  
And a fool that I am  
For thinking you loved me too  
  
You took my heart  
Then played the part of little coquette  
And all my dreams just disappeared  
Like the smoke from a cigarette  
  
Fool that I am  
For hoping youd understand  
And thinking you  
Would listen too  
And oh the things I had planned  
  
But we couldnt see eye to eye  
So darling darling darling  
This is goodbye  
But I still care but I still care  
And oh fool that I am  
Oh but I still care  
Fool that I am
