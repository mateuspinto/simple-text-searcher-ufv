Come and take me down  
The dark beyond  
And take me there  
Where I come from  
  
Take me down  
To the place where Ill kneel  
And let me lay my shadow down  
In though the eyes  
Of a childs inner me  
No pain to heal my bloodied brow  
  
There is no rain  
To save this silent town  
There is no rain to save at all  
There is no place  
To save this silent ground  
There is no place to save at all  
  
Oh father take me  
Unto where Ill lay me down  
Oh Hallowed Ground  
  
Oh the sky is falling  
And I dont know where my home is now  
My Hallowed Ground  
  
Oh and can you take me  
For I have tasted Hallowed Ground  
Oh all around  
  
Father  oh do you hear me  
This pain I will not cry aloud  
  
Father  I know you hear me  
My head is bludgeoned but unbowed
