Dear penthouse  
I never did believe anything I ever read in your magazine until just the other
night  
  
When something happen to me that was so strange that I felt compelled to share
it with your readers  
  
Im a student at stateyou  
  
Maybe Im getting ahead of myself It was one year ago tonight that my room
mate stupendous dork and I were sittin around the dorm poppin a few
frostys and burning some rope and boning up for the speech therapy midterm
exam the next day by reading back issues of your magazine out loud to each
other  
  
I looked at stu and he looked at me and we both knew neither of us was going
to get a real good grade on that exam anyway We hopped out of the dorm and
went across the street to herbies tumble inn  
  
Right across from the dorm there we came through the swinging doors and I
couldnt believe my eyes there they were sitting at the bar these two
luscious babes and they were siamese twins  
  
I looked at stu and he looked at me and we looked at them and they looked at
us and then one of the twins said wont you join us  and I just laughed and
we went and sat down at the bar  
  
Turns out one if the ladies was a speech therapy major and her sister said
she had some rope in her purse there and a big light bulb went off in my head
and I said what the heck why dont we all go back to the dorm   
  
Came out of the swingin doors at herbies and couldnt get across the street  
  
There was these 30 bikers with jackets that said harley aristocrats on the
back There was an aerobic dance class and there was the commanding officer of
the campus rotc pushing a nautilus machine right down the double yellow line
I said what the heck why dont we all go back to the dorm   
  
The last thing I remember is one of the twins screaming hey general put your
big heat seeking missile in my love silo  
  
I got my degree in spite of failing speech therapy that quarter Last night
for the first time in a year my room mate stupendous dork went back to
herbies to toast our commencement Came thru the swingin doors and there
they were at the bar the same two siamese twins and I said oh no and I went
and sat down a table  
  
The twins came over to the table and the one that was a speech therapy major
looked my right in the eye and said excuse me you probably dont remember
us
