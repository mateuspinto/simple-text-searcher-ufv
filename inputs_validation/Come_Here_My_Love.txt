Come here my love  
This feeling has me spellbound  
Yet the storyline in paragraphs  
Laid down the same  
In fathoms of my inner mind  
Im mystified oh by this mood  
This melancholy feeling  
That just dont do no good  
  
Come here my love  
And I will lift my spirits high for you  
Id like to fly away and spend a day or two  
Just contemplating the fields and leaves  
And talking about nothing  
Just layin down in shades of effervescent effervescent odors  
And shades of time and tide  
And flowing through  
Become enraptured by the sights and sounds  
In intrigue of natures beauty  
Come along with me  
And take it all in  
Come here my love
