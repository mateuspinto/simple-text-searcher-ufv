Chorus  
This is my song for real no doubt  
See the DJ is making me feel thugged out  
As I walk you to dance floor  
We begin to dance slow  
You put your arms around me  
Im feeling on yo booty  
  
Hey pretty mama how you doing  
Said Im just in town for the weekend  
Looking for a lil trouble to get into  
Baby tell me what ya drinking and I got you  
  
Players want to play  
Ballers want to ball  
Rollers want to roll  
But Im taking all after I dance  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Now yo body got me feeling like spending  
With a backroom I could come to live in  
And yo hair weaves looking kinda pretty pretty  
The way you back up on me baby Lord have mercy  
  
Players want to play  
Ballers want to ball Ballers want to ball  
Rollers want to roll  
But Im taking all after I dance yeah whoa  
  
Chorus x2  
  
If its yo birthday then put yo hands up  
You want to get drunk then put yo hands up  
And if you got some cash put yo hands up  
And your own job put yo hands up Players want to play  
  
Players want to play  
Ballers want to ball Ballers want to ball  
Rollers want to roll Feel so good say it again  
  
Players want to play  
Ballers want to ball oh  
Rollers want to roll  
But Im taking all after I dance oh yeah
