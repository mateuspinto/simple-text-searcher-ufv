I put my money down on love again  
At a hundred to one  
I dont mind losin Ill just try til I win  
Or see how close I can come  
  
Chorus  
Oh it should be illegal  
It gets me so high  
I can fly like an eagle  
Night after night  
  
I know people who have thrown in the towel  
Just cause theyve lost once or twice  
But it takes a believer to put all this faith  
In the toss of the dice  
  
Chorus Repeat 2X  
  
Night after night after night
