Chorus  
The finest woman that Ive ever known  
The finest woman that Ive ever known  
Shine a light on this love of mine  
The finest woman that Ive ever known  
  
My days were lonely and my nights were long  
My life was empty and my dreams were long gone  
I was hanging with the brothers in crime  
My only lover was the red red wine  
I was just about to call a cab to take me home  
Standing right there talking on the phone about  
  
Chorus x2  
  
She does not drink she does not smoke  
I rock her world even though Im stoned  
Alright  
She got the beauty she got the brains  
She bring me crackers on a long silver tray  
Six foot one with a golden heart  
Calculated ready with them thighs  
  
Chorus x3
