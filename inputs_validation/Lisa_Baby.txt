When my baby is a mess  
My baby is a dancing queen  
When my baby wears a dress  
Its like shes not even a human being  
  
Nobody else  
Nobody else  
Nobody else  
Has you down but me  
  
I behold the beauty  
But the beauty got a hold on me  
With all the other boys in the running  
Never thought this could happen at 20  
  
Nobody else  
Nobody else  
Nobody else  
Has you down but me  
  
When my baby is a mess  
My baby is a dancing queen  
When my baby wears a dress

Nobody else  
Nobody else  
Nobody else  
Has you down  
Has you down  
Has you downbut me  
  
Singing a oh  
Ive been singing a oh  
Ive been singing a oh
