A little quiet conversation in the night  
I need my time with you  
It always seems to make  
The day turn out alright  
  
Its easy when Im here with you  
And when life is hard to understand  
You reach out for the hand  
Of someone who believes in you  
  
And when Im sure  
Im not worth anything at all  
I need my time with you  
When were together  
  
All those troubles look so small  
When nothing seems real  
Then I need my time with you  
Hard times  
  
City lights shine all over the sky  
Dont you know in a dog eat dog world  
We need each other to survive  
I got to know if they storm the walls  
  
Ill have you by my side  
I turn the page  
And see another restless day  
Ill need my time with you  
  
Ill keep believing  
Till tomorrow fades away  
Takes only that moment with you  
Its never easy  
  
When you got to keep it going  
And your backs against the wall  
As every dreamer knows  
It doesnt really matter  
  
If you rise or if you fall  
You can hand it all  
To someone who believes in you  
And cares for you  
  
And shares that time with you  
I need and I want  
And I love my time with you  
I need my time with you
