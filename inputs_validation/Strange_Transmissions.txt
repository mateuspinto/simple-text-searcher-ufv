I believe you say  
Dont think well stay  
Drawn through the ebb  
Lost in the flow  
Beneath my breath I confess  
My world loved less  
The devil held the proof  
For me to know  
I could only fight  
For the longest while  
But with the truth out baby  
I belong to you  
I stoop to find  
My place entwined  
I took it to the bottom  
One more time  
I could only fight  
For the longest while  
But with the truth out baby  
I belong to you  
I could trip and I want you to know  
That every time I think  
That I think I should go  
I receive strange transmissions  
I could trip and I want you to know  
That every time I think  
That I think I should go  
I receive strange transmissions  
I could only fight  
For the longest while  
But with the truth out baby  
I belong to you  
I could trip and I want you to know  
That every time I think  
That I think I should go  
I receive strange transmissions  
I could trip and I want you to know  
Every time I think  
That I think I should go  
I receive strange transmissions
