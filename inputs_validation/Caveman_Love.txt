Im just a lonely cavegirl  
Searching for a date  
Looking for cave romance  
Or at least a caveman date  
  
My momma says I must wait here  
Until the moon is bright  
With cakes milk and honey as gifts for the Gods  
Or as snack food for Mr Right  
  
Now crawl around three times  
On your hands and knees  
And if the face of a handsome man comes into view  
Then hes your caveman love  
  
I think I must look really silly  
What caveman in his right mind would go for a crawling circling cavegirl  
Like   
Oh are you the man for me  
  
My handsome caveman husband  
Is all Id hoped he would be  
He likes to go out hunting  
Then I cook it for his tea  
  
I promise to love him forever  
Until hes old and grey  
Hell live to the grand age of thirty  
At which point hell probably pass away  
  
But that doesnt mean you stop loving him  
Cause now you have to prepare  
A burial to show how much you care  
For your caveman love  
  
First I set fire to my husband  
Then carefully cut off his skin  
Boil in a pot some oysters and snakes  
Let the funeral begin  
Drop in some limpets and winkles  
And sprinkles of mouse toad and shrew  
Then put out the fire with the cauldron  
And say au revoir to my caveman love  
My caveman love  
Caveman love
