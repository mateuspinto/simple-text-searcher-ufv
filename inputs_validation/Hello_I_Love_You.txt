Hello I love you  
Wont you tell me your name  
Hello I love you  
Let me jump in your game  
  
Hello I love you  
Wont you tell me your name  
Hello I love you  
Let me jump in your game  
  
Shes walkin down the street  
Blind to every eye she meets  
Do you think youll be the guy  
To make the queen of angels sigh  
  
Hello I love you  
Wont you tell me your name  
Hello I love you  
Let me jump in your game  
  
Hello I love you  
Wont you tell me your name  
Hello I love you  
Let me jump in your game  
  
She holds her head so high  
Like a statue in the sky  
Her arms are wicked her legs are long  
When she moves my brain screams out this song  
  
Sidewalk crouches at her feet  
Like a dog that begs for something sweet  
Do you hope to make her see you fool  
Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel  
  
Hello I love you  
Hello I love you  
Hello I love you  
Hello I love you  
  
I love you  
I love you  
I love you  
I love you
