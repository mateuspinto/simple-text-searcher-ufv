Talking Obie Trice  
New shit Obie Trice Eminem  
Get familiar wit it  
  
Verse 1 Obie Trice  
Obie the person that came up and deverted  
Cause of nervousness  
That was solely the homies verdict  
It was worth it  
Cause he changed became so I observed it  
Certain such of a purpose  
Its like a different version  
So much hurtin and pain  
Gave him game for certain  
Thats why its curtains at his murder if you get him worked up  
Im so assertive on these motherfuckers actin tougher  
Had enough of  
Isolating myself in a room  
Writing poems for songs doin the same in school  
Now look what he became a fool  
Cause he learned how to sustain his two  
And obtain fame from you  
Living hard but still Julliard  
A god walks and aint spent a day in a pew  
Regardless of this I draw visual pictures when a nigga vents  
So welcome to the art department  
  
Verse 2 Eminem  
I stimulate the brain mimick  
Emulate the sane  
Sick of people thinkin its a fuckin mimick when it aint  
Clinically insane  
Brain is on Venus  
Suck your anus Uranus  
Label me a genius if you ever seen as you would say  
He may seem as though hes plain normal  
If you ever meet him greet him with a shake see he aint as mean as what they
say  
See the thing is maybe he cant always think of things to say so hes vague  
So they mistake him for just bein crazed  
You dont think hes strange  
You turn around and tell him please and thanks  
And catch him flippin you off with his pants down  
Hands around  
His Scrotum tuckin his fuckin penis between his legs
