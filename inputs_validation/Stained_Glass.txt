We are like windows  
Stained with colors of the rainbow  
Set in a darkened room  
Till the bridegroom comes to shining through  
  
Then the colors fall around our feet  
Over those we meet  
Covering all the gray that we see  
Rainbow colors of assorted hues  
Come exchange your blues  
For His love that you see shining through me  
  
We are His daughters and sons  
We are the colorful ones  
We are the kids of the King  
Rejoice in everything  
  
My colors grow so dim  
When I start to fall away from Him  
But up comes the strongest wind  
That he sends to blow me back into his arms again  
  
And then the colors fall around my feet  
Over those I meet  
Changing all the gray that I see  
Rainbow colors of the Risen Son  
Reflect the One  
The One who came to set us all free  
  
We are His daughters and sons  
We are the colorful ones  
We are the kids of the King  
Rejoice in everything  
  
We are like windows  
Stained with colors of the rainbow  
No longer set in a darkened room  
Cause the bridegroom wants to shine from you  
  
No longer set in a darkened room  
Cause the bridegroom wants to shine from you
