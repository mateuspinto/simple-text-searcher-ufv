Gonna get out on the road tonight  
Cause I got a hollow in my head  
Checking it up  
Baby one more time for you  
Checking it up  
Until the pot hits the sky  
Its like I think  
Im sick of cocaine  
Got a feeling like  
Its running in my veins  
Checking it up  
Baby one more time for you  
Checking it up  
Until the pot hits the sky  
Even the best years  
Leave a lot to be desired  
When they pass you by  
All these seasons  
All this time  
Spinning round  
Until they leave you  
Far behind  
Lay me down in the circle  
Where the spotlight shines  
All this pleasure gets me high  
Some people will cut you  
Until youre bleeding  
But not me  
I just want to do it to myself  
Checking it up  
Baby one more time for you  
Checking it up  
Until the pot hits the sky  
Even the best years  
Are a waste of time  
But Baby Im a big star now  
All these seasons  
All this time  
Spinning round  
Until they leave you  
Far behind  
Lay me down in the circle  
Where the spotlight shines  
All this pleasure gets me high  
All these seasons  
All this time  
Spinning round  
Until they leave you  
Far behind  
Lay me down in the circle  
Where the spotlight shines  
Turn your back back on the people  
Who draw the line  
Put your faith in the answers  
That you can find  
Hit the Ground hard running down  
That highway line  
Say a prayer for the ones  
You have left behind  
All this pleasure gets them high  
I dont want to give it back
