Oh Mexico  
All the time  
Dreamin all about Acapulco  
And a sweet thing on my mind  
  
Mogadishu sunrise  
Low above the sea  
All of those lawyers in California  
Wont bring her back to me  
  
Back to me  
Back to me  
  
Oh Mercenary Girl  
Of all the lowdown places in the world  
To be stuck inside of a phone booth  
Hangin on the end of a line  
While this civil war keeps ragin in my mind  
  
Oh Mary Mary  
I think youre fine  
Cause you can mix a margarita  
From a bottle of turpentine  
  
Just between noon and midnight  
Thats when the battle rages on  
Mama I just gotta make one more call  
And Ill be here with you all night long  
  
All night long  
All night long  
  
Oh Mercenary Girl  
Of all the lowdown places in the world  
To be livin in another city  
Comin from another time  
  
I know its a cold cruel world  
But youre eyes look soft and kind  
And this civil war keeps ragin in my mind  
  
Oh Mercenary Girl  
Oh Mercenary Girl  
Oh Mercenary Girl  
Oh Mercenary Girl
