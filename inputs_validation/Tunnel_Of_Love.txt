Getting crazy on the waltzers but its the life that I choose  
Sing about the sixblade sing about the switchback and a torture tattoo  
And I been riding on a ghost train where the cars they scream and slam  
And I dont know where Ill be tonight but Id always tell you where I am  
  
In a screaming ring of faces I seen her standing in the light  
She had a ticket for the races just like me she was a victim of the night  
I put a hand upon the lever said let it rock and let it roll  
I had the one arm bandit fever there was an arrow through my heart and my soul  
  
And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above  
And Im just high on the world  
Come on and take a low ride with me girl  
On the tunnel of love  
  
Its just the danger when youre riding at your own risk  
She said you are the perfect stranger she said baby lets keep it like this  
Its just a cake walk twisting baby step right up and say  
Hey mister give me two give me two cos any two can play  
  
And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above  
And Im just high on the world  
Come on and take a low ride with me girl  
On the tunnel of love  
  
Well its been money for muscle another whirligig  
Money for muscle and another girl I dig  
Another hustle just to make it big  
And rockaway rockaway  
  
And girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did  
Like the spanish city to me when we were kids  
Oh girl it looks so pretty to me just like it always did  
Like the spanish city to me when we were kids  
  
She took off a silver locket she said remember me by this  
She put her hand in my pocket I got a keepsake and a kiss  
And in the roar of the dust and diesel I stood and watched her walk away  
I could have caught up with her easy enough but something must have made me  
Stay  
  
And the big wheel keep on turning neon burning up above  
And Im just high on the world  
Come on and take a low ride with me girl  
On the tunnel of love  
  
And now Im searching through these carousels and the carnival arcades  
Searching everywhere from steeplechase to palisades  
In any shooting gallery where promises are made  
To rockaway rockaway from cullercoats and whitley bay out to rockaway  
  
And girl it looks so pretty to me like it always did  
Like the spanish city to me when we were kids  
Girl it looks so pretty to me like it always did  
Like the spanish city to me when we were kids
