When I was a traveler  
I used to love to watch the rain  
Id stand under the downspout  
Let the water cool my brain  
I never thought to worry  
If the river rose too high  
That all the seeds we planted  
Would get washed out with the tide  
But now I am a man  
And I need a place to hide  
But theres nowhere to run  
And theres no place to hide  
Where the water runs free  
And the mud starts to slide  
When I was a young man  
I could work through wind and rain  
I never thought to worry  
Had no reason to complain  
I thought that I was standin  
On a rock so firm and strong  
But it was easy then to see  
Just what was right and what was wrong  
But now I am a man  
I wont be hangin round too long  
When I was a child  
I used to love to watch the rain  
Id stand under the downspout  
Let the water cool my brain  
I never thought to worry  
If the river rose too high  
And all the dreams we planted  
Would get washed out with the tide  
But theres nowhere to run  
And theres no place to hide  
Where the water runs free  
And the mud starts to slide  
Where the water runs free  
And the mud starts to slide
