Burning up each others love burning up our lives  
Tried all kinds of working out miracle goodnight  
Future full and empty knocking on my door  
Ragged limbed and hungry mama  
Miracle no more  
Skin tell me turn it around  
Head tell me make it alright  
Nobody dancing  
Morning star youre beautiful yellow dime on high  
Spin you round my little room miracle goodnight  
Evening flower all alone puzzling capeche  
Havent got a death wish just want a little more  
  
CHORUS  
Skin tell me turn it around  
Head tell me make it alright  
Nobody dancing miracle goodnight  
Breath tell me turn it around  
Heart tell me make it alright  
  
Nobody dancing it was only make believe  
I wish I was a sailor a thousand miles from here  
I wished I had a future anywhere  
I love you in the morning sun I love you in my dreams  
I love the sound of making love the feeling of your skin  
The corner of your eyes I long forevermore  
I never want to say goodnight miracle goodnight  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont want to know the past I want to know the real deal  
I really dont want to know that  
The less we know the better we feel  
Morning star youre beautiful yellow diamond high  
Spinning around my little room miracle  
  
Chorus  
  
Skin tell me turn it around  
Moon tell me make it alright  
Nobody dancing it was only make believe  
Eyes tell me turn it around  
News tell me make it alright  
Nobody dancing  
  
Chorus
