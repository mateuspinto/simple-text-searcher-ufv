I was feeling sad  
Cant help looking back  
Highways flew by  
Run run run away  
No sense of time  
Want you to stay  
Want keep you inside  
  
Chorus x2  
Run run run away  
Lost lost lost my mind  
Want you to stay  
Want you to be my prize  
  
I was feeling sad  
Cant help looking back  
Highways flew by  
Run run run away  
No sense of time  
Want you to stay  
Want keep you inside  
  
All along not so strong without these open arms  
Hold on tight  
All along not that strong without these open arms  
Lie beside  
All along not so strong without these open arms  
Ride beside  
  
Chorus x2
