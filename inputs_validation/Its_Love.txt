Its love  
To my mind  
  
Well I drop myself on the cold cement  
Hang my head cause my womans bent  
No lights on but I know that shes home  
So I ring the bell another forty time  
The neighbor dog made me lose my mind  
Now I see her car slide down the road  
  
Its love  
To my mind  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
I know how to get back to me  
I know how to get back to me  
  
Now I act as if I just got there  
From doing important shit somewhere  
But she dont seem impressed with me at all  
So I decided as I stood  
Im done with this one now for good  
But I know as soon as I get home  
And see that Im all by myself  
Im gonna pick up the phone  
And tell her I would do anything to have her back again  
  
Cause thats love  
To my mind  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
I know how to get back to me  
I know how to get back to me  
I know how to get back to me  
I know how to get back to me  
I know how to get back to me  
got to get back to me  
  
I know how to get back to me  
got to get back to me  
I know how to get back  
I know how to get back  
got to get back to me
