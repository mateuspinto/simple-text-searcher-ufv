He always runs while others walk  
He acts while other men just talk  
He looks at this world and wants it all  
So he strikes like thunderball  
He knows the meaning of success  
His needs are more so he gives less  
They call him the winner who takes all  
And he strikes like thunderball  
  
Any woman he wants hell get  
He will break any heart without regret  
His days of asking are all gone  
His fight goes on and on and on  
But he thinks that the fight is worth it all  
So he strikes like thunderball
