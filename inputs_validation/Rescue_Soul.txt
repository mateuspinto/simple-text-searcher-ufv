I need you  
oh yeah  
I need you  
oh yeah  
I need you  
oh yeah  
How can I just let you walk away  
Just let you leave without a trace  
When I stand here taking Every breath with you  
Standin all alone on the bedroom floor  
Thinkin about it more n more  
  
Chorus where are you staying  
Are you in the world  
ill do anything  
for you to be my girl  
  
Yeah where has is taken me  
Drivin me mad  
how are you copin without your man  
  
Chorus x3
