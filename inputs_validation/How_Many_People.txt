How many people stand in a line  
How many people never get a chance to shine  
If you can tell me Ill gladly listen  
How many people have died  
  
One too many right now for me  
I want to be happy I want to be free  
One too many tight now for me  
I want to see ordinary people living peacefully  
  
How many people go for a ride  
How many people never make it through to the other side  
If you can tell me Ill gladly listen  
How many people have cried  
  
One too many right now for me  
I want to be happy  
I want to be free  
One too many tight now for me  
I want to see ordinary people living peacefully  
  
How many people will I take how many people  
For goodness sake  
How many people  
How many people  
One too many
