United States of America nigga  
Land of the free

You know what Id do for mine  
Everything but go to war nigga  
Yeah Im into it with niggas right around the corner from me  
I aint gotta go out the motherfucking country to shoot them choppers nigga  
  
Chorus  
Colombians Mexicans  
Even got some work from the Dominicans  
American land of the free

Stop the beat lets get something understood  I stay gd up  
Maybach with my feet up AK when I creep up  
My young niggas rep Blood Gang my OGs rep Hoover  
All I got is shooters all we do is shoot up  
Little bad bitch got no aim she must work at Hooters  
Remember being in New York when the towers blew up  
Now I got a 911 Porsche with the blue guts  
Rimsll make you throw up something to make you blow up  
Niggas getting little money when you gon grow up  
Louis from the toe up street nigga so what  
Louis XIII and I just tell them bitches poor up

Chorus  
  
Voila haha 18 wheeler fulla  
Pounds of  green and thirty bricks inside a Honda  
He dont speak any English all he know is numbers  
Thats my mans he plug me he gon get me through the summer  
He dont know my name him there just a runner  
He pick it up and drop it off then he gets him yonder  
Land of the free run up if you wanna  
Suicide mission we got choppers in this Hummer  
Red white and blue Im no politician  
But I live in a white house so I feel presidential  
I pledge allegiance to the flag United Streets of America  
In God we trust in one we stand Ill always be a hustler  
Work  
  
Chorus  
  
The block Frank Sinatra thirty thousand feet up in the air eating lobster  
Doing what I gotsta  
Catch me at the tables hundred thousand a marker  
  
Fucking with the wrong set aint even perform yet  
Short one to AC Vegas we took the long jet  
Blue chip in the field red one on the horn bet  
Money straight work good the neck aint did me wrong yet  
They come in powder form til we rock em up  
Land of the free but they tryna lock me up  
Ha Im in the trap til the sky change  
Drug dealer nightmares millionaire migraines  
Work  
  
Chorus
