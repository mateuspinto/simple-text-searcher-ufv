Poor skeleton steps out  
Dressed up in bad blood  
Bad brains bad thoughts and others deeds  
  
Poor skeleton no doubt  
One of these days  
You can cast aside your human be free  
  
When the cities run with blood  
And you drink our health in mud  
All flesh be gone  
Save your dry and joyous shout  
For the day poor skeleton steps out  
  
Poor skeleton steps out  
Sprung from his life sentence  
Deep inside some muscle mask  
  
Poor skeleton devout  
Propping up truck drivers  
Filmstars thieves or queens your brave task  
  
When technology is rust  
And you write your book in dust  
All flesh be gone  
  
Cant buy tickets from a tout  
For the day poor skeleton steps out  
  
Poor skeleton steps out  
Liberated from sex organs  
And brown black white skin  
  
Poor skeleton you lout  
Dont you think that we might  
Like to have been asked to join in  
  
For good skeletons are we  
And were dying to be free  
All flesh be gone  
  
I will scream or sulk and pout  
Until my poor skeleton steps out  
  
Better watch out here comes bony boy
