Somewhere between heaven and earth  
That is where you will find real freedom  
Weve been waiting for so long for this freedom  
When other freedom fighters  
Puppet master marching soldier  
Fought of the rights of the people  
You fought for the right to  
Abuse people that is why I call you  
Puppet master  
Marching soldier  
I was a little boy when it happened  
But I can still hear those killing machines  
Roaring like thunder  
Roaring like hungry lions  
And they dont only hurt us physically  
And they dont only hurt us politically  
But they hurt us mentally  
Puppet master  
Marching soldier  
Puppet master  
Marching soldier  
Puppet master  
Marching soldier
