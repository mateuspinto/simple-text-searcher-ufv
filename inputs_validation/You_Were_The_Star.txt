Were the star  
When there was no one  
You were in the sky  
And I was nowhere to be seen  
  
You have fallen oh my star  
And you have lost your faith  
And tomorrow means the same to me  
To all  
  
Nevermind  
For tomorrow  
Will be  
Half a genius shining  
  
You were the star  
When there was no one  
You were in the sky  
And I was nowhere to be seen  
  
Now you have fallen oh my star  
And you have lost your faith  
And tomorrow means the same to me  
To you  
To all  
  
Nevermind  
For tomorrow  
Will be  
Half a genius shining  
Half a genius shining
