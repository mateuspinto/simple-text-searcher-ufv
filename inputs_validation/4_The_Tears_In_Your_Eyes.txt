Long ago there was a man  
Change stone to bread with the touch of his hand  
Made the blind see and the dumb understand  
  
He died for the tears in your eyes  
Your eyes  
  
Many people came from all around  
Hear this man preach glorious sound  
Spoke of man in harmony and love abound  
  
He died for the tears in your eyes  
Your eyes  
  
Your eyes  
Your eyes  
  
Died for the tears in your eyes  
For the tears in your eyes  
And the tears of sorrow  
For cents may be all that theyre worth  
For the rising sun each day assures us  
The meek shall inherit the earth  
The earth  
  
Faith is a word we all should try  
Describing the man who willingly died  
Believe that your hunger sorrow and fears  
  
Is less than the tears in your eyes  
Your eyes  
  
Less than the tears in your eyes  
For the tears in your eyes  
And the tears of sorrow  
For cents may be all that theyre worth All theyre worth  
For the rising sun each day assures us  
The meek shall inherit the earth  
  
Say it again  
For the tears in your eyes  
And the tears of sorrow  
For cents may be all that theyre worth All theyre worth  
For the rising sun each day assures us  
The meek shall inherit the earth  
The earth  
  
Thank you
