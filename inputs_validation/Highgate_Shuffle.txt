Oh yeah  
Let the band play one time now  
It was early one morning  
I was on my way to school  
Early one morning  
I was on my way to school  
Got lost on Monday morning  
I broke my teachers rule  
I was in love with you baby  
Before I learned to call your name  
I was in love with you baby  
Before I learned to call your name  
Now youre in love with someone else  
Youre bound to drive poor me insane  
Oh yeah    
I said bye bye bye baby bye bye  
I said bye bye bye baby bye bye   
Ha ha  
I said bye bye bye baby bye bye   
Bring it down here  
I said bye bye bye baby bye bye   
Bye bye bye baby bye bye   
I said bye bye bye baby bye bye   
Yeah  
Bye bye bye baby bye bye   
Bye bye bye baby bye bye   
I said bye bye bye baby bye bye
