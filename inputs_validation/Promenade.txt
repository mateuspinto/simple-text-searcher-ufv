There was smoke in the air  
When he came around and saw  
He was really alone  
  
Memories look like blood in the water  
Sweet and ugly pain  
Just like confetti in the rain  
  
He was known for his bedside manner  
He wanted to believe  
That people only hear what they see  
  
He had a good time being the bad guy  
He didnt want to understand why  
That old song makes him cry  
  
I remember when it felt like we were walking with God  
A little heaven when the sun goes down  
Walking hand and hand down on the Promenade  
  
He was alone in a dark room overlooking the mall  
With a gun in his hand  
And no one to call  
  
He was waiting for a reason to fade and run  
Just like photos in the window  
That turn blue in the sun  
  
People used to call it a breakdown  
Now he medicates to make it go away  
Yeah yeah people used to call it a mid life crisis  
He just sits and looks at pictures of himself  
From way back in the day  
  
Remember when it felt like we were walking with God  
Getting stupid in a stolen car  
Making love in the garage behind the Promenade  
  
Think I need to slow down  
Think I need to slow my roll  
  
I need to put the gun down  
I feel so lost  
I feel so out of control  
  
I broke myself in pieces to make my name  
I broke those people dumb enough  
To get in my way  
  
Now I look in the mirror  
And I cant see me  
How can you swallow the world  
And still be hungry  
  
Remember when it felt like we were walking with God  
Holding hands with my dad and my mom  
Walking in the lights to see Santa  
On the Promenade  
  
Remember when it felt like we were walking with God  
Remember when it felt like we were walking with God  
  
Remember  
Remember  
  
Remember when it felt like we were walking with God  
Remember when it felt like we were walking with God
