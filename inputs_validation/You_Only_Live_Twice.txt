You only live twice  
Oh so it seems  
One life for yourself  
And one for your dreams  
  
You drift through the years  
And life seems stray  
Till one dream appears  
And love is its way  
  
Id love you to strangers  
Ooh beckon you on  
Dont think of the danger  
For a stranger is gone  
  
This dream is for you  
So pay the price  
Make one dream come true  
You only live twice  
  
This dream is for you  
So pay the price  
Make one dream come true  
You only live twice  
You only live twice
