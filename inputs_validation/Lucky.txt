Im on a roll  
Im on a roll to success  
I feel my luck could change  
  
Kill me Sarah  
Kill me again with love  
Its gonna be a glorious day  
  
Pull me out of the aircrash  
Pull me out of the lake  
Cause Im your superhero  
We are standing on the edge  
  
The head of state has called for me by name  
But I dont have time for him  
Its gonna be a glorious day  
I feel my luck could change  
  
Pull me out of the aircrash  
Pull me out of the lake  
Cause Im your superhero  
We are standing on the edge  
  
We are standing on the edge
