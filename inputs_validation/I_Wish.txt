Come on up hey little darling  
  
That was the way when I first met you baby  
You werent right for me  
I didnt really care  
Act quite naturally  
  
She said  
Went on a boat going down by the river  
Plenty more supplies  
Seen a lot of planes going up in the air  
  
Do you ever get the feeling  
That you want to fly like a bird in the sky  
  
Hey Lucille youll be the talk of the town  
Lucille hey youll be the talk of the town  
She met a young man called Johnnie  
He played a little mean guitar  
  
No matter how hard I try  
I want to fly like a bird in the sky  
I want to fly like a bird in the sky  
  
I wish I could take time  
I wish oh I wish so hard  
I wish I could take time  
I wish oh I wish so hard  
  
Living the night doing it wrong  
  
Its a little lonely without you  
The feeling was strong  
The world was holding on  
I want to be on my own  
  
I wish I could take time  
I wish oh I wish so hard  
I wish I could take time  
I wish oh I wish so hard  
  
Wont you stay with me  
  
Take from me what I take form you  
You can take from me what I find in you  
  
Come on tell me tell me tell me  
  
I wish I could take time  
I wish oh I wish so hard  
Hey I wish I could take time  
I wish oh I wish so hard  
  
Say I cant get by without your love  
Say I cant get by without your love  
  
Say I cant get by without your love  
Say I cant get by without your love  
  
I wish I could take time  
I wish oh I wish so hard  
I wish I could take time  
I wish oh I wish so hard  
  
I wish I could take time  
I wish oh I wish so hard
