Tell me How long will we grovel at the feet of wealth and power  
Tell me How long will we bow down to that golden calf  
How long will be too long  
Tell me How long will we curtsy to the whims of new religion  
How long will we water down the truth  
Til truth is no more  
How long will be too long  
  
Chorus  
The power of faith and love  
Can change the stuff were made of  
But still we wait  
Tell me How long will be too long  
  
Tell me How long will we drink from the chalice of indifference  
Neither be hot or be cold  
Can a sober soul know  
How long will be too long  
  
Chorus  
  
Is there not more to us  
Than cursed dust to dust  
I feel my hope fading  
How long will be too long  
  
How long will be too long  
  
Tell me How long will we travel from the ways that God intended  
Wont it all tumble down if His holy wrath comes  
How long will be too long  
  
Chorus  
  
The power of faith and love  
Can change the stuff were made of  
When will it be too late  
How long will be too long  
How long will be too long  
How long will be too long
