If we burn our wings  
Flying too close to the sun  
If the moment of glory  
Is over before its begun  
If the dream is won  
Though everything is lost  
We will pay the price  
But we will not count the cost  
  
When the dust has cleared  
And victory denied  
A summit too lofty  
River a little too wide  
If we keep our pride  
Though paradise is lost  
We will pay the price  
But we will not count the cost  
  
And if the music stops  
Theres only the sound of the rain  
All the hope and glory  
All the sacrifice in vain  
And if love remains  
Though everything is lost  
We will pay the price  
But we will not count the cost
