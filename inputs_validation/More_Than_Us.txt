More than us  
And we are them  
But they dont know  
Whats in their hands  
Its more than you  
And its more than  
I but its more  
And everybody calls it love  
But Im not really sure if its love  
At all  
  
Not anymore  
More than he  
More than she  
They all sleep  
But we just dream  
More or less  
Means more for us  
But its more  
And everybody wants a hand  
But Im too busy holding up the world  
To carry on  
  
No not anymore  
I wish that I  
Could fly fly fly away  
And if I should fall  
And you hear me call  
Would you stay  
More than us  
And we are them  
  
But they dont know  
Whats in our heads  
Its more than you  
And its more than  
I but its more  
And everybody calls it love  
But Im not really sure if this is love  
At all  
  
Not anymore  
Anymore  
Anymore
