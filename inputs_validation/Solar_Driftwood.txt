The Big Ban  
  
The ultimate hero of low frequency  
The divine intergalactic bass drum connecting  
The tribes of our solar systems  
  
If we could communicate  
From our tiny piece of solar driftwood  
Into another galaxy what would we say  
  
We can send out pictures symbols  
Chemical formulas or language  
  
The magic of music is a sign of consciousness  
That could be understood  
On farflung worlds millions of light years from our horizon  
  
Music is an interstellar language  
From a highly insignificant planet  
One of nine in our system which sails  
Through time and space till the next one  
The next inevitable Big Bang
