Would you like to sit and talk to me  
About the way things change so  
Suddenly  
When your senses come and the feeling  
Goes  
Can you remember feeling much  
Too close  
  
Stop your hands from shaking  
Look at me  
Are your senses racing endlessly  
Tracing  
Past impressions So were mine  
Have you ever been used  
Or will this be the first time  
  
Its come so clear to me  
Light fuse and get away  
No gain no pain  
Its a fatal game  
And the true lose everything  
  
I can see  
What trust and loyalty have done  
For me  
Falling miles from the mark  
With a thirst for revenge  
And a dangerous heart  
  
Ive tried to wash from memory  
Feelings of betrayal and the incidents  
That plague me since I lost my sense  
Of innocence  
  
A history of changes now Im loving  
Now Im losing keeps me constantly  
In fear of hearing I cant see where  
This is going  
  
You lie alone with the memory  
Feeling the ceiling and walls closing  
In on  
Your Conscience  my ally  
The guilt  your affliction  
From preying on praise as you fed  
An attention addiction  
  
Someone told me  
Light fuse and get away  
No gain no pain  
And when its lust to dust you can  
Crawl from the wreckage  
  
I can see  
What trust and loyalty have done  
For me  
Lying bleeding in the dark  
With a thirst for revenge  
And a dangerous heart  
  
Its come so clear to me  
Light fuse and get away  
No gain no pain  
Its a fatal game  
And the true lose everything  
  
I can see  
What trust and loyalty have done  
For me  
Falling miles from the mark  
With a thirst for revenge  
And a dangerous heart
