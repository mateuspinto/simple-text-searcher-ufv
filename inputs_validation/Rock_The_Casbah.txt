Now the king told the boogie men  
You have to let that raga drop  
The oil down the desert way  
Has been shakin to the top  
The Sheik he drove his Cadillac  
He went a cruisin down the ville  
The muezzin was a standing  
On the radiator grille  
  
Chorus  
The Shareef dont like it  
Rock the Casbah  
Rock the Casbah  
The Shareef dont like it  
Rock the Casbah  
Rock the Casbah  
  
By order of the prophet  
We ban that boogie sound  
Degenerate the faithful  
With that craazy Casbah sound  
But the Bedouin they brought out  
The electric camel drum  
The local guitar picker  
Got his guitar picking thumb  
As soon as the Shareef  
Had cleared the square  
They began to wail  
  
Chorus  
  
Now over at the temple  
Oh They really pack em in  
The in crowd say its cool  
To dig this chanting thing  
But as the wind changed direction  
The temple band took five  
The crowd caught a wiff  
Of that crazy Casbah jive  
  
Chorus  
  
The king called up his jet fighters  
He said you better earn your pay  
Drop your bombs between the minarets  
Down the Casbah way  
  
As soon as the Shareef was  
Chauffeured outta there  
The jet pilots tuned to  
The cockpit radio blare  
  
As soon as the Shareef was  
Outta their hair  
The jet pilots wailed  
  
Chorus  
  
He thinks its not kosher  
Fundamentally he cant take it  
You know he really hates it  
Really really hates it
