Was broken down by the side of the road yeah  
Was crawling in the darkness like a king snake in the woods  
We were hiding in the tall grass  
Hiding in the tall grass  
Just looking for a place to shed our skins  
  
Were gonna summon the Holy Ghost from the battlefield  
And in the morning this old world wont be the same  
Wont be the same Lord  
  
Snapshot lightning silhouette expressions  
Monumental faces in the flesh of Cypress trees and killing vines  
Naked in the mud girl  
Lets sling a little mud girl  
Just looking for a place to shed our skins  
  
Were gonna summon the Holy Ghost from the battlefield  
And in the morning this old world wont be the same  
Were gonna summon the Holy Ghost from the battlefield  
And in the morning this old world wont be the same  
Wont be the same Lord  
  
Feeling weak in the Itta Bina hot sun  
Crawling to the station we were foamin at the mouth  
Sippin on a tall boy sippin on a tall boy  
Just looking for a place to shed our skins  
  
Were gonna summon the Holy Ghost from the battlefield  
And in the morning this old world wont be the same  
Were gonna summon the Holy Ghost from the battlefield  
And in the morning this old world wont be the same  
Were gonna summon the Holy Ghost from the battlefield  
And in the morning this old world wont be the same  
Show me the way Lord
