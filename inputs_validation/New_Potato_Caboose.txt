Last leaf fallen bare earth where green was born  
Black Madonna two eagles hang against a cloud  
Sun comes up blood red wind yells among the stone  
All graceful instruments are known  
  
When the windows all are broken and your loves become a toothless crone  
When the voices of the storm sound like a crowd  
Winter morning breaks youre all alone  
  
The eyes are blind blue visions all a seer can own  
And touching makes the flesh to cry out loud  
This ground on which the seed of love is sown  
All graceful instruments are known
