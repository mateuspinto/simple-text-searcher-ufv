Do you like American music  
I like American music  
Dont you like American music baby  
I want you to hold me  
I want your arms around me  
I want you to hold me baby  
Did you do too many drugs  
I did too many drugs  
Did you do too many drugs too baby  
You were born too late  
I was born too soon  
But every time I look at that ugly moon  
It reminds me of you  
It reminds me of you ooh ooh ooh  
I need a date to the prom  
Would you like to come along  
But nobody would go to the prom with me baby  
They didnt like American music  
They never heard American music  
They didnt know the music was in my soul baby  
You were born too soon  
I was born too late  
But every time I look at that ugly lake  
It reminds me of me  
It reminds me of me  
Do you like American music  
We like American music  
I like American music baby  
Do you like American music  
We like all kinds of music  
But I like American music best  
Baby you were born too late  
And I was born too late  
But every time I look at that ugly lake  
It reminds me of me  
It reminds me of me  
Do you like American music  
It reminds me of me  
Do you like American music
