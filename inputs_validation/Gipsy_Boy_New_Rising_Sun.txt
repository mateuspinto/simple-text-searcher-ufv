Hey gipsy boy  
Where do you come from  
From the land of the new rising sun  
Hey gipsy boy  
Where do you plan to go to  
  
Im gonna spread a lot of love  
And of peace of mind too  
May I come along  
  
May I come along  
May I come along  
May I come along  
  
May I come along  
May I come along  
May I come along  
  
Hey gipsy boy  
Where do you go to  
Im gonna spread a lot of love  
And of peace of mind too  
May I come along  
  
May I come along  
May I come along  
May I come along
