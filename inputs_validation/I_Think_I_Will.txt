What would you say if I said somethin strange  
That made a difference in how you feel  
What would you do if I did somethin outta the blue  
That made the world a better place  
Oh I think I will  
  
Chorus  
Gonna change before I break  
Gonna take your heartache and make it mine  
This time  
Oh I think I will  
Im gonna run til I find  
Another way to make you mine  
In time  
Oh I think I will  
  
What would you give if I gave you everything  
And asked for nothin how would you feel  
What would you think if I thought about  
Doinsomethingood just to make you smile  
Oh I think I will  
  
Chorus  
  
Im takin it slow but the further I go  
The more I know I think I will  
The longer I live the stronger I get  
Im positive I think I will  
  
Im takin it slow but the further I go  
The more I think I will  
The longer I live the stronger I get  
Im positive I think I will  
  
Chorus
