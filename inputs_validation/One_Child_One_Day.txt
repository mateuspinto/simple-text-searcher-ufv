Three wise men a shining star  
A mother and a father who had come so far  
How could they know about their son  
And the miracle hed become  
That he held the soul of man  
In his tiny little hands  
  
Chorus  
One child one day  
And the universe will never be the same  
From Bethlehem  
Cause the angels voices rejoicing in his name  
Oh and I believe with all my heart  
That he will show the way  
And you and I will meet  
One child one day  
  
A small white church a mountainside  
Cathedrals filled with music and golden light  
Oh we gather everywhere  
For the peace thats always there  
For the story that is told  
Of a birth so long ago  
  
Chorus
