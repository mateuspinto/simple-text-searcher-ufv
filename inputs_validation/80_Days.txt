Staring down from this high window  
At the faces in the line  
Cold from hours of waiting  
How many people can you love  
When youre black and blue with bruises  
From collisions on the road  
The friction grind of traveling  
This is the never ending show  
All over the world in eighty days  
Head in a blur of information  
What kind of a man could live this way  
I do what I can  
I do OK  
But right now  
All I want to do is  
Get real  
If thats alright with you  
Woke up last night under the mountains  
Driving from Zurich to Milan  
I lay there listening to the echoes  
Thinking of Iceland and Japan  
So many smiles So many faces  
And my home so far away  
I lose some of me in all these places  
And I cant help the way Im changed  
All over the world in eighty days  
Memories turn like magazine pages  
What kind of a man could live this way  
I do what I can  
But I cant escape it  
Right now  
All I want to do  
Is get real  
If thats alright with you  
Right now  
All I want to do  
Somehow  
Be myself with you  
All over the world in eighty days  
Alcohol haze of information  
What kind of a man could live this way  
As long as I have  
And stay the same  
Right now  
All I want to do is  
Get real  
If thats alright with you  
Right now  
All I want to do  
Get real  
If thats alright with you  
For just one night with you  
Get real somehow
