Chorus  
Have a good time yeah  
Have a good time yeah  
Have a good time yeah  
Have a good time yeah  
  
Who said this partys over  
When I feel like my fun has just begun  
Together we will raise this roof and party  
And have a good time yeah  
Have a good time oh yeah  
All we need is some funky music  
So we can play the part and get way down  
Into some rhythm we can groove to  
Have a good time yeah  
Have a good time yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Who said this partys over  
I feel like my fun has just begun  
Together we will raise this roof and party  
And have a good time  
Have a good time yeah  
All we need is some funky music yeah  
So we can play the part and get way down  
Into some rhythm we can groove to  
Everybody have a good time  
  
repeat to fade
