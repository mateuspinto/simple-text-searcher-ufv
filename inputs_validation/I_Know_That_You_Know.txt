I know that you know  
That Ill go where you go  
I choose you wont lose you  
I wish you knew how much I long  
To hold you in my arms  
  
This time is my time  
Will soon be goodbye time  
Then in the star light hold me tight  
With one more little kiss  
Say nighty night  
  
I know that you know  
That Ill go where you go  
I choose you wont lose you  
I wish you knew how much I long  
To hold you in my arms  
  
This time is my time  
Will soon be goodbye time  
Then in the star light hold me tight  
With one more little kiss  
Say nighty night
