Here we are  
Trying to find a meaning for it all  
As time keeps slipping away  
We take our place in the roles like dominoes  
Hoping we wont be the ones to fall  
  
Is it so hard to see that none of us are free  
Until we all understand   
That this fate can belong to us all  
  
Have we learn  
That the answer is not the war  
With the children dying by the score oh  
Educate and share the wealth with every nation  
We owe it to ourselves  
  
But is it so hard to see that none of us are free  
Until we all understand that we all have a piece of the  
truth oh  
  
Is it so hard to see so hard to see  
That none of us are free  
Until we all understand  
That is more than a word  
This thing called love
