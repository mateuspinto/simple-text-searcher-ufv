Ive seen so many kids over the years  
A few years come and go and they disappear  
Punk rock is not a trend its a fucking life style  
Yet so many fade out after a while  
When you grew up and deserted the scene  
Found the american nightmare is the american dream  
Your ideas changes as you matured and grew  
The system you despised now controls you  
  
Where have you gone  
You faded away  
  
You faded away now youre gone  
  
So many scream the kids are united  
Then they grow up and become divided  
Dont look down on us cause we wont change like you  
Who gave you the right to write the rules  
Work five days a week and you slave nine to five  
Well half your life you lived a lie  
I thought I knew you man I was fooled  
You have gone and let the system trap you
