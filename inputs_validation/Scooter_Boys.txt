Scooter boys and Argentinians  
Europe shed the blood of the Indians  
Here I sit in the land of plenty  
Crying about my own virginity  
  
Hey blue blood youre nothing new  
See I come from privilege too  
A chapter in the book on the Americas  
And your just another colonial terrorist  
  
Scooter boys and Argentinians  
Europe shed the blood of the Indians  
Here I sit in the land of plenty  
Crying about my own virginity  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
Way down south where the Maya reign  
Zapata reading poetry in his grave  
They say were stealing from the best  
To feed the poor  
Well they need more  
  
Scooter boys and Argentinians  
Europe shed the blood of the Indians  
Here I sit in the land of plenty  
Crying about my own virginity  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
Oh  
  
Yeah  
Yeah
