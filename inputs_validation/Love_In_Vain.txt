Its only human for anyone to want to be in love  
But who wants to be in love in vain  
At night you hang around the house and weep your heart out  
And cry your eyes out and rack your brain  
  
You say it and wonder how anyone is wonderful as he  
Could cause you such misery and pain  
I thought that I would be in Heaven but Im only up a tree  
Cause its just my luck to be in love in vain
