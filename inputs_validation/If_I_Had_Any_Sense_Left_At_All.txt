I can feel the darkness reaching in  
As I touch the place you may as well have never been  
Love can hurt much more than one can bare  
When a heart beats for someone whose not there  
  
How many times must I tell myself that youre gone  
When will the rest of me wake up and see what went wrong  
So wrong  
And turn on the light and pick up the phone and just call  
And lay pride aside  
If I had any sense left at all  
  
Voices call that only I can hear  
Who would have thought love was somethin I would fear  
Almost hold almost smell almost taste  
On my mind in my heart on my face  
  
How many times must I tell myself that youre gone  
And when will the rest of me wake up and see what went wrong  
So wrong  
And turn on the light and pick up the phone and just call  
And lay pride aside  
If I had any sense left at all  
  
Oh just lay pride aside  
If I had any sense left at all
