This is a song about a very big strong black sexy southern baptist minister  
Who thinks hes got his program all together until he meets a lady who lets
him know  
That he aint got it all together his name is reverend dr lee  
Reverend lee he went to the water and he prayed to the lord  
About old satans daughter it seems in a dream child while he lay sleeping  
She climbed in his bed starts rubbing and weeping ah she was twisting and
turning hmm  
She was begging and pleading loving and burning panting breathing ooh ah
ah  
Reverend lee she said lord knows that I love you child but I would not
even no no  
Place God above you well reverend lee he lifted his arms high  
Said heavenly father take me home to the sky he said lord please dont test
me  
Not down where she touched me my mind is so hazy  
And you know my body is hungry oh yeah and then God rolled the thunder  
And he hurled the lightening uh oh he seemed to be angry  
Well it really was frightening yes he was oh the thunder grew louder  
Darkened conditions and just then a voice said God cannot be petitioned  
Just then the devil oh he emerged from the water and he said in that dry
voice  
Your God will not barter reverend lee he went screaming from the water  
And he was hotly pursued by old satans daughter  
And she said she said reverend ooh reverend reverend lee  
She said reverend lee do it to me she said she said uh reverend lee  
reverend reverend reverend reverend lee I dont want nobody else to do
it  
Do it but you do it do it yeah you do it do it to me
