Woe to you oh earth and sea  
For the Devil sends the beast with wrath  
Because he knows the time is short  
Let him who hath understanding  
Reckon the number of the beast  
For it is a human number  
Its number is six hundred and sixty six  
  
I left alone my mind was blank I needed time to think  
To get the memories from my mind  
What did I see Can I believe that what I saw  
That night was real and not just fantasy  
  
Just what I saw in my old dreams  
Were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me  
Cause in my dreams its always there  
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair  
  
Night was black was no use holding back  
Cause I just had to see was someone watching me  
In the mist dark figures move and twist  
Was all this for real or just some kind of Hell  
  
6 6 6 the number of the beast  
Hell and fire was spawned to be released  
  
Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised  
As they start to cry hands held to the sky  
In the night the fires are burning bright  
The ritual has begun Satans work is done  
  
6 6 6 the number of the beast  
Sacrifice is going on tonight  
  
This cant go on I must inform the law  
Can this still be real or just some crazy dream  
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes  
Seem to mesmerize cant avoid their eyes  
  
6 6 6 the number of the beast  
6 6 6 the one for you and me  
  
Im coming back I will return  
And Ill possess your body and Ill make you burn  
I have the fire I have the force  
I have the power to make my evil take its course
