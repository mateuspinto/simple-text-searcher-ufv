Your own personal Jesus  
Someone to hear your prayers  
Someone who cares  
Your own personal Jesus  
Someone to hear your prayers  
Someone whos there  
  
Feeling unknown  
And youre all alone  
Flesh and bone  
By the telephone  
Lift up the receiver  
Ill make you a believer  
  
Take second best  
Put me to the test  
Things on your chest  
You need to confess  
I will deliver  
You know Im a forgiver  
  
Reach out and touch faith  
Reach out and touch faith  
Your own personal Jesus  
  
Feeling unknown  
And youre all alone  
Flesh and bone  
By the telephone  
Lift up the receiver  
Ill make you a believer  
I will deliver  
You know Im a forgiver  
  
Reach out and touch faith  
Your own personal Jesus  
Reach out and touch faith
