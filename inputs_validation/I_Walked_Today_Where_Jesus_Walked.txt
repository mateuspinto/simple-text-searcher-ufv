I walked today where Jesus walked  
In days of long ago  
I wandered down each path He knew  
With reverent step and slow  
  
Those little lanes they have not changed  
A sweet peace fills the air  
I walked today where Jesus walked  
And felt His presence there  
  
My pathway led through Bethlehem  
Ah memorys ever sweet  
The little hills of Galilee  
That knew His childish feet  
  
The Mount of Olives hallowed scenes  
That Jesus knew before  
I saw the mighty Jordan roll  
As in the days of yore  
  
I knelt today where Jesus knelt  
Where all alone he prayed  
The Garden of Gethsemane  
My heart felt unafraid  
  
I picked my heavy burden up  
And with Him at my side  
I climbed the Hill of Calvary  
I climbed the Hill of Calvary  
I climbed the Hill of Calvary  
Where on the Cross He died  
  
I walked today where Jesus walked  
And felt Him close to me
