Waking in the dead of night  
Hold onto this life  
Running to whats wrong or right  
Seems to be a thin line  
Fighting for a wasted love  
Fighting to survive  
Oh wont you please forget  
Wont you please forget  
  
These are the dog days  
These are the dog days  
Theyll never go away  
These are the dog days  
These are the dog days  
Theyll never go away  
  
1 2 3 4  
What are you waiting for  
1 2 3 4  
What are you waiting for  
These are the dog days  
These are the dog days  
  
Waking in the dead of night  
Hold onto this life  
Running to whats wrong or right  
Seems to be a thin line  
Fighting for a wasted love  
Fighting to survive  
Oh wont you please forget  
Wont you please forget  
  
These are the dog days  
These are the dog days  
Theyll never go away  
These are the dog days  
These are the dog days  
Theyll never go away  
  
1 2 3 4  
What are you waiting for  
1 2 3 4  
What are you waiting for  
These are the dog days  
These are the dog days  
  
Embracing the heart  
To find the loss  
Running down a path that  
I think i need to know  
When youve think youve won  
Youre still losing after all  
These are the dog days  
These are the dog days  
  
These are the dog days  
These are the dog days  
Theyll never go away  
These are the dog days  
These are the dog days  
Theyll never go away  
  
1 2 3 4  
What are you waiting for  
1 2 3 4  
What are you waiting for  
These are the dog days  
These are the dog days
