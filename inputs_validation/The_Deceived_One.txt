Bowing down to an angle cast out by God  
Worshipping a deceitful enemy  
Whos laughing at their pride in following him  
Considering everyone to be merely human pigs  
Under his cunning and evil eyes  
CHORUS  
A multitude is in total chaos  
Knowing not the deceived ones that they are  
Asking for power richness and desire  
The price that they must pay  
Is their souls thrown into a cauldron of fire  
By being weak and blind  
The fools disrespect the Christian houses of God  
They are the opposite of all that is Holy  
Locked in cages of sins  
How can they reject the creator of all living things  
The almighty God hears the prayers from Holy priests  
And Christians alike forgiveness for them in at hand  
But curses shall fall upon those that refuse to repent  
Gods only begotten son was scoured mocked and put  
To death and resurrected on the third day  
Proved his powers to demonstrative  
How goodness always prevails  
Followers of damnation march on in their darkest ways  
Failing to see and admit the truth that Christ left for  
Us today  
CHORUS  
A multitude is in total chaos  
Knowing not the deceived ones that they are
