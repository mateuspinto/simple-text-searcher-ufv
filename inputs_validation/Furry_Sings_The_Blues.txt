Old Beale Street is coming down  
Sweeties Snack Bar boarded up now  
And Eagles The Tailor and the Shine Boys gone  
Faded out with ragtime blues  
Handys cast in bronze  
And hes standing in a little park  
With a trumpet in his hand  
Like hes listening back to the good old bands  
And the click of high heeled shoes  
Old Furry sings the blues  
Propped up in his bed  
With his dentures and his leg removed  
And Ginnys there  
For her kindness and Furrys beer  
Shes the old mans angel overseer  
  
Pawn shops glitter like gold tooth caps  
In the gray decay  
They chew the last few dollars off  
Old Beale Streets carcass  
Carrion and mercy  
Blue and silver sparkling drums  
Cheap guitars eye shades and guns  
Aimed at the hot blood of being no one  
Down and out in Memphis Tennessee  
Old Furry sings the blues  
You bring him smoke and drink and hell play for you  
Its mostly muttering now and sideshow spiel  
But there was one song he played  
I could really feel  
  
Theres a double bill murder at the New Daisy  
The old girls silent across the street  
Shes silent waiting for the wreckers beat  
Silent staring are her stolen name  
Diamond boys and satin dolls  
Bourbon laughter ghosts history falls  
To parking lots and shopping malls  
As they tear down old Beale Street  
Old Furry sings the blues  
He points a bony finger at you and  
I dont like you  
Everybody laughs as if its the old mans standard joke  
But its true  
Were only welcome for our drink and smoke  
  
WC Handy Im rich and Im fay  
And Im not familiar with what you played  
But I get such strong impressions of your hey day  
Looking up and down old Beale Street  
Ghosts of the darktown society  
Come right out of the bricks at me  
Like its a Saturday night  
Theyre in their finery  
Dancing it up and making deals  
Furry sings the blues  
Why should I expect that old guy to give it to me true  
Fallen to hard luck  
And time and other thieves  
While our limo is shining on his shanty street  
Old Furry sings the blues
