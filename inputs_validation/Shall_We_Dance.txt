Anna sings  
Weve just been introduced  
I do not know you well  
But when the music started something drew me to your side  
So many men and girls are in each others arms  
It made me think we might be similarly occupied  
  
Shall we dance on a bright cloud of music  
Shall we fly  
Shall we dance  
Shall we then say goodnight and mean goodbye  
Or per chance when the last little star has left the sky  
Shall we still be together with our arms about each other  
And shall you be my new romance  
On the clear understanding that this kind of thing can happen  
Shall we dance shall we dance shall we dance  
  
Interlude  
  
Shall we dance on a bright cloud of music  
Shall we fly  
Shall we dance  
Shall we then say goodnight and mean goodbye  
  
The King Sings  
Or per chance when the last little star has leave the sky  
  
Anna Sings  
Shall we still be together with our arms about each other  
And shall you be my new  
  
Both Sing  
Romance  
On the clear understanding that this kind of thing can happen  
Shall we dance shall we dance shall we dance
