She knows she knows  
Oh I oh III  
Well alright  
Oh I oh III  
Well alright  
  
Damned if I do  
Damned if I dont  
You know I got a girl back home  
You got a man what you want what you want  
What these bitches want from a nigga  
On some DMX shit  
I know them other niggas love tricking  
On some BMX shit  
But not me  
Now Im sure you done heard about me  
A black star Mos Def Kweli  
Good southern bad hoes try me they try me  
This is Martin Luther King in the club  
Getting dubs with a bad bitch  
In his ear sayin she down for whatever  
In the back of his mind is Coretta  
  
She knows she knows  
And I know she knows and I know she knows  
And deep down she knows she knows  
And I know she knows and I know she knows  
Well alright  
Oh I oh III  
I cant be what you want from me  
Well alright  
Oh I oh III

Well alright  
  
Damned if I do  
Damned if I dont  
Im passing up on bad hoes  
Trying to be the man that she want what she want  
What she want from a nigga  
To put a ring on it  
Got a bitch on my dick right now  
And she just want to sing on it  
Got me up so high  
Trying to get a piece of that apple pie  
I be up so high  
Trying to get a piece of that apple pie  
Dancehall vibes with my pants on fire  
Cause I told her I was sleeping  
Cause I creep with this pretty young thing that I chose  
That she could be doing the same thing I suppose  
  
She knows she knows  
And I know she knows and I know she knows  
And deep down she knows she knows  
And I know she knows and I know she knows  
Well alright  
Oh I oh III  
I cant be what you want from me  
Well alright  
Oh I oh III  
I cant be what you want from me  
Well alright  
  
My niggas say turn up hoes say turn up  
Only bad thing about a star is they burn up  
Niggas say turn up hoes say turn up  
Only bad thing about a star is they burn up  
Rest in peace to Aaliyah  
Rest in peace to Left Eye  
Michael Jackson Ill see ya  
Just as soon as I die  
  
Got me up so high trying to get a piece of that apple pie  
I be up so high trying to get a piece of that apple pie  
Got me up so high trying to get a piece of that apple pie  
I be up so high trying to get a piece of that apple pie  
  
Well alright  
Oh I oh III  
I cant be what you want from me  
Well alright  
Oh I oh III  
I cant be what you want from me  
Well alright
