Never never will I marry  
Never never will I wed  
Born to wander solitary  
Wide my world narrow my bed never  
Never never will I marry  
Born to wander til Im dead  
No conscious no care no burdens to bear  
No memories to mourn no turning  
For I was born to wander solitary  
Wide my world narrow my bed  
Never never never never will I marry  
Born to wander til Im dead  
For I was born to wander solitary  
Wide my world narrow my bed  
Never never will I marry  
Born to wander til Im dead  
Never never
