My life is changing in so many ways  
I dont know who to trust anymore  
Theres a shadow running through my days  
Like a beggar going from door to door  
  
I was thinking that maybe Id get a maid  
Find a place nearby for her to stay  
Just someone to keep my house clean  
Fix my meals and go away  
  
A maid A man needs a maid  
A maid  
  
Its hard to make that change  
When life and love turns strange  
And old  
  
To give a love you gotta live a love  
To live a love you gotta be part of  
When will I see you again  
  
A while ago somewhere I dont know when  
I was watching a movie with a friend  
I fell in love with the actress  
She was playing a part that I could understand  
  
A maid A man needs a maid  
A maid  
  
When will I see you again
