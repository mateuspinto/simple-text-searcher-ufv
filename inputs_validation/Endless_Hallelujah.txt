When I stand before Your throne  
Dressed in glory not my own  
What a joy Ill sing of on that day  
No more tears or broken dreams  
Forgotten is the minor key  
Everything as it was meant to be  
  
Chorus  
And we will worship worship  
Forever in Your presence we will sing  
We will worship worship You  
An endless hallelujah to the King  
  
I will see You as You are  
Love You with unsinning heart  
And see how much You paid to bring me home  
Not till then Lord shall I know  
Not till then how much I owe  
Everything I am before Your throne  
  
Chorus  
  
No more tears no more shame  
No more sin or sorrow ever known again  
No more fears no more pain  
We will see You face to face  
See You face to face  
  
Chorus x2  
An endless hallelujah to the King  
Well sing an endless hallelujah to the King  
To the King  
Sing an endless hallelujah  
To You to you  
Forever and ever  
And Ever and ever  
Saints and angels  
Living creatures  
All the hosts of heaven  
Hallelujah hallelujah  
To You  
An endless hallelujah  
  
Chorus
