This is A fake song  
Jennifer never released it  
  
Feat Nelly  
  
Chorus Jennifer Lopez 2x  
Ive had enough  
Im tired of you treating me so rough  
Not coming home and then tryna play tough  
  
Jennifer Lopez  
What was I to do  
Though I had enough I still loved you  
Even when you played tough you still was my boo  
When I told you we needed to break up you refused  
Sometimes I felt used  
Cause I fell into ya trap when you begged at my shoes  
I remember you going to jail cause I was being abused  
Either stay or get bailed wonder which one did you choose  
  
Chorus 2x  
  
Nelly  
From you saying damn me To me hardballin like Sammy  
  
And winning all these Grammys All I wanna do is start a family  
Theres no need to worry  
So stop saying youll do all thats neccessary  
To get me locked up in the penitentiary  
Its Nelly and JLos time to bill  
Im like Samuel L In a time to kill  
Buy that Vokal fosho and cop that Nellyville  
  
Chorus once  
  
Jennifer Lopez  
From you coming home late to you saying our love can wait  
And making all these tour dates  
Our relationship would only lead to fate  
My friends keep telling me to find another date cause  
  
Chorus 2x
