I cant remember what I planned tomorrow  
I cant remember when its time to go  
When I look in the mirror  
Tracing lines with a pencil  
I remember what came before  
  
I wanted to think there was endless love  
Until I saw the light dim in your eyes  
In the dead of the night I found out  
Sometimes theres love that wont survive  
  
New York City  
Such a beautiful disease  
New York City  
Such a beautiful  
Such a beautiful disease  
  
Laura kept all her disappointments  
Locked up in a box behind her closet door  
She pulled the blinds and listened to the thunder  
With no way out from the family store  
  
We all told her things could get better  
When you just say goodbye  
Ill lay awake one more night  
Caught in a vision I want to deny  
  
And did I mention the note that I found  
Taped to my locked front door  
It talked about no regrets  
As it slipped from my hand to the scuffed tile floor  
  
I rode the train for hours on end  
And watched the people pass me by  
It could be that it has no end  
Just an action junkies lullaby  
  
New York City  
We were full of the stuff that every dream rested  
As if floating on a lumpy pillow sky  
Caught up in the whole illusion  
That dreams never pass us by  
Came to a tattooed conclusion  
That the big one was knocking on the door  
What started as a mass delusion  
Would take me far from the place I adore  
  
New York City
