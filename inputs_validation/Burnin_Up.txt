You Made Me So Much Fronting  
Doing My Drove For The See You Kind Of  
You See By The Moon Cant See Nothing New  
Drove My Way Over Closer I Feel The Hit  
Baby I Came Inside If I Feel Alright  
But I Know Tonight I Wanted That Fire In Your Eyes  
Burning Up  
But I Know Tonight I Want That Fire In Your Eyes  
  
Feeling So Touching Like There Is Nothing  
Body Made I Dont Care Let Me Tell You Baby  
 Without The I Said I Cant  
But I Know Tonight I Wanted That Fire In Your Eyes  
Baby I If I Live Or Die  
But I Know Tonight I Wanted That Fire In Your Eyes  
You Know What To Do With Me  
Dont Know What To Do With Me And You  
Burning Up  
Burning Up  
Burning Up  
Burning Up  
Burning Up  
Baby I If I Live Or Die  
But I Know Tonight I Wanted That Fire In Your Eyes  
Baby I If I Live Or Die  
But I Know Tonight I Wanted That Fire In Your Eyes  
Baby I If I Live Or Die  
But I Know Tonight I Wanted That Fire In Your Eyes  
Baby I If I Live Or Die  
But I Know Tonight I Wanted That Fire In Your Eyes  
Baby I If I Live Or Die  
But I Know Tonight I Wanted That Fire In Your Eyes
