In a booth back in a corner where the lights are way down low  
In the arms of a man I hardly know  
  
I let the devil take over this heart of mine  
When I lost your love well I almost lost my mind  
I never thought Id ever fall this low but here I am with a man I hardly know  
In a booth back in a corner  
 steel   
I do the things a proper lady wouldnt do  
And it all started that first night when I lost you  
To see me now you wouldnt know me Im changed so  
Cause here I am with a man I hardly know  
In a booth back in a corner
