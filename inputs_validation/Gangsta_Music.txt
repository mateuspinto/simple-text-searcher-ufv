Im here now you old news  
Got a couple old porches couple old schools  
Ill line ya ass up push ya tape backwards  
Cause Im a real nigger I dont like rappers  
  
And that aint this and this aint that  
And bitch Im strapped  
Fuck wit real nigger thatll cut ya throat  
And they dont drink Pepsi they just sell Coke  
  
All I do is talk dro its like my brain on drugs  
See me out nigger I do my thing in clubs  
Listen up Jeezy gotta a little riddle  
Stack of 20dollar bill two bands in the middle  
  
Chorus  
All the gangstas they gon ride to this  
They goin grind to this  
They goin shine to this  
This is gangsta music this is gangsta music this is gangsta music and  
this is gangsta music  
All the hustlers they goin ride to this  
They goin grind to this  
They goin shine to this  
This is hustler music this is hustler music this is hustler music and  
this is hustler music  
  
We dont talk on the phone cause it might stick  
Gotta play for the 7 call it Mike Vick  
Dirty birds nigger we play wit them falcons  
Know some niggers in the Decatur that pay for them falcons  
  
Talking young hungry niggers eat ya whole plate  
Jeezy place the order niggers eat ya whole face  
You got me Mr Scrooge all fucked up  
Jump out hit the switch light ya ass up  
  
Carbon 15 wit the one pound drum  
Got plenty for any nigga think he wants some  
We dont leave em at the house we bring em out  
My chain for yo life we can swap it out  
  
Chorus  
  
The hoes love my voice  
Make they pussy moist  
Certified g shit and Im the gangsters choice  
Niggers popping off hope they bullet proof  
  
Leave holes inside ya like a sunroof  
Mack 11 in the club and a sub nose  
Swear to God knock you niggers out ya clothes  
Lay ya ass flat like a doormat  
  
Niggers ask for but they dont want that  
In the rap game takin niggers clientele  
White ones like the powder that I used to sell  
Give a fuck about a player hater  
Hit em wit the tool bust his whole radiator
