Sweet song singin take me back I wanna go  
Sweet song singin take me back I wanna go  
Sweet song singin take me back I wanna go  
Sweet song singin take me back I wanna go  
  
Heres to to a long forgotten dream  
Enshrouded by by a history so clean  
In a place still the same so rich with time  
I remain in my heart my soul my mind  
  
So clear is the mystery to me  
So majestic yet electric dose of age I see  
There remains a sparkle in the sand  
Cant restrain these feelings of my ancient land  
  
Here is a melody for you  
Sky of white and nylon blue  
Let me hurry home to you  
To sing to dance to laugh  
  
Embrace  
So vague is this picture I am seeing  
Yet so clear and so dear my soul is singin  
To belong is this feelin I am missin  
  
To embrace this memory I been kissin  
So clear is this mystery to me  
So majestic yet electric guest of age I see  
There remains a sparkle in the sand  
  
Cant restrain these feelings of my ancient land  
Here is a melody for you  
Sky of white and nylon blue  
Let me hurry home to you  
  
To sing to dance to laugh  
Embrace  
I wanna go  
Sweet song singin take me back  
  
I wanna go  
Sweet song singin take me back
