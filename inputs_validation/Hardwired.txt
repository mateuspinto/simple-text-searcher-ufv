In the name of desperation  
In the name of wretched pain  
In the name of all creation  
Gone insane  
  
Were so fucked  
Shit out of luck  
Hardwired to self destruct  
Go  
  
On the way to paranoia  
On the crooked borderline  
On the way to great destroyer  
Do you decide  
  
Were so fucked  
Shit out of luck  
Hardwired to self destruct  
  
Once upon a planet burning  
Once upon a flame  
Once upon a fear returning  
All in vain  
  
Do you feel my hope receding  
Do you comprehend  
Do you feel it terminating in the end  
  
Were so fucked  
Shit out of luck  
Hardwired to self destruct  
Hardwired to self destruct  
Selfdestruct  
Selfdestruct  
Selfdestruct
