I used to know this wretched girl  
I made her open for me  
I took her heart  
And I kissed it clean  
But she still kicks against me  
Are the songs my disease  
Are the songs my disease  
Maybe shes creating me  
Mistaken accidentally  
For a girl I used to know  
In darkness permanently  
If I find her the perfect line  
My sickness might desert me  
Are the songs my disease  
Are the songs my disease
