I did a thing last night  
You know those future games  
I turned off all the lights  
Oh the future came  
You were by my side  
Will you explainoh yeah  
Real rhyme or reason for those future games  
  
Now you were there last night  
And oh were you afraid  
Of things wed come upon  
While playing future games  
But baby its alright and so have faith  
Oh yeah you invent the future that you want to face  
  
How many people sit home at night  
Wondering if this day will be here tonight  
Wondering if children they bring to the light  
Inherit the world or inherit the night  
Wondering if neighbors are thinking the same  
All of the wild things tomorrow will tame  
Talking of journeys that happen in vain  
  
Well I know Im not the only one  
To ever spend my life sitting playing future games  
  
You better take your time  
You know theres no escape  
The future sends a sign  
Of things we will create  
Baby its alright  
And so have faith  
Oh yeah you invent the future that you want to face  
  
How many people sit home at night  
Wondering if this day will be here tonight  
Wondering if children they bring to the light  
Inherit the world or inherit the night  
Wondering if neighbors are thinking the same  
All of the wild things tomorrow will tame  
Talking of journeys that happen in vain  
  
And I know Im not the only one  
To ever spend my life sitting playing future games  
  
Future games  
Future games  
Future games  
Future games  
  
I know Im not the only one  
I know Im not the only one  
I know Im not the only one  
I know Im not the only one  
I know Im not the only one  
I know Im not the only one  
I know Im not the only one  
I know Im not the only one
