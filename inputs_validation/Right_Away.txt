I have seen you  
walk in my dreams  
casted high against the sky  
  
let me meet you  
let me greet you inside  
take your place right next to mine  
  
yes I say  
  
right away right away  
right away right away  
right away right away  
right away right away  
  
leaves have fallen  
since I saw you last  
slowly die from green to brown  
in which way we choose  
to live our lives again  
  
Im gonna lay some seeds  
Im gonna leave them laying right on the ground  
  
right away right away  
right away right away  
right away right away  
right away right away  
  
right away right away  
right away right away  
right away right away  
right away right away  
  
right away right away  
right away right away  
right away right away  
right away right away
