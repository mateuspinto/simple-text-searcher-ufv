It was 1 in the morning and I was up yawning  
Moms asked where Im going to the hood if you aint knowing  
Pops locked up so mama couldnt stop me  
I was out the house ASAP Rocky  
And it wasnt cause she couldnt control us  
We wasnt babies she just wanted to hold us  
And we aint get disciplined her friend started whisperin  
About how she was a bad mama mama said fuck em then  
I was in the streets styling nobody could tell me nothing  
Grandpa or grandma not my auntie or my favorite cousin  
I was buzzin  
Fucking all these hoes wearing no condoms no nothing  
I used to ditch school when the homie had the Chevy  
I used to sneak and smoke stress weed  
  
But now Im rolling on dubs  
How you feel whooptie woop nigga what  
Now Im rolling on dubs  
How you feel whooptie woop nigga what  
All these hoes showing love  
How you feel whooptie woop nigga what  
All these hoes showing love  
How you feel whooptie woop nigga what  
  
SKKKRRRT I was on a mission  
On a mission to the money sun down til it sunny  
Know my family love me  
Riding in the car with 2 niggas and a pistol  
This aint funny I do it all for the money hold up  
Slowly as I pull up to the donut stand  
I already know the plan hop out and get on your mans  
And take what he got  
Go through pockets wallets and socks dig all the knots  
This a stickup  
Phone ring its my mama in the middle of some drama  
So I dont pick up thinking I gotta get my shit up  
I gotta pick my bitch up  
Lets hurry up and leave I feel the police near us  
So we left with a thousand dollars cash  
It was me and my nigga so you know I went half  
Shit get real when niggas get greedy  
Pop pop pop pow thats where he leave me
