Lyrics for Animal Songs  
6 Little Ducks  
Traditional  
From the album More Singable Songs  
Six little ducks that I once knew  
Fast ones skinny ones fair ones too  
But the one little duck with the feather on his back  
He led the others with his quack quack quack  
Quack quack quackquack quack quack  
He led the others with his quack quack quack  
Down to the river they would go  
Wibble wobble wibble wobble to and fro  
But the one little duck with the feather on his back  
He led the others with a quack quack quack  
Quack quack quackquack quack quack  
He led the others with his quack quack quack  
Home from the river they would come  
Wibble wobble wibble wobble hohumhum  
But the one little duck with the feather on his back  
He led the others with a quack quack quack  
Quack quack quackquack quack quack  
He led the others with his quack quack quack  
Six little ducks that I once knew  
Fat ones skinny ones fair ones too  
But the one little duck with the feather on his back  
He led the others with his quack quack quack  
Quack quack quackquack quack quack  
He led the others with his quack quack quack
