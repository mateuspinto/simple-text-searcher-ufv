Just keep a movin wherever you were movin  
They told me you were movin on  
Just keep a goin wherever you were goin  
The day you left me here all alone  
You were in such a hurry such a tizzy such a flurry  
To leave me for the new love you found  
  
So just keep scratchin gravel hit the road and start to travel  
I dont want to do time Im not hangin round  
Oh just keep a goin wherever you were goin  
The day ya broke my heart and said so long  
Just keep a movin wherever you were movin  
The day you told me you were movin on  
  
Just keep a movin wherever you were movin  
The day you moved right out of my door  
Just keep a love for you and keep him under cover  
Your secret loves no secret anymore  
  
When you gave me the go sign I didnt even know why  
You were actin mighty high and mighty then  
Now your new loves grown colder than a well diggers shoulder  
And you wanted me to take you back again  
  
Oh just keep a goin wherever you were goin  
The day ya broke my heart and said so long  
Just keep a movin wherever you were movin  
The day you told me you were movin on
