Wanderin through the back roads  
And the rain comes rushin down  
To resolve your love  
For this man in his twenties  
  
Am I right Am I wrong Or am I just dreaming  
  
Climbing up the backstairs  
Theres a chill wind in the air  
I wrap up from the cold  
Pull the blind in the window  
  
Who was here Was it you Or am I just dreaming  
  
Look at all the lonely people  
Walking miles around the town  
I can see the old cathedral  
But I have to play it down  
  
Boats along the river  
Setting up their sails  
And life carries on as normal  
Although youre not around  
  
Waiting as the bus stop  
Laughing off the rain  
Shaking their umbrellas  
Till it starts again  
  
Flowers in the water  
Floating off downstream  
Paper in the gutter  
Blowing in the breeze  
  
Am I right Am I wrong Or am I just dreaming
