Dont speak of safe Messiahs  
A failure of the modern man  
To the center of all lifes desires  
As a whole not an also ran  
Love in a hollow field  
Break the image of your fathers son  
Drawn to an inner feel  
He was thought of as the only one  
He was thought of as the only one  
  
He no longer denies  
All the failures of the modern man  
No no no he cant pick sides  
Sees the failures of the modern man  
Wise words and sympathy  
Tell the story of our history  
New strength gives a real touch  
Sense and reason make it all too much  
With a strange fatality  
Broke the spirits of a lesser man  
Some other race can see  
In his way he was the only one  
In his way he was the only one  
  
He no longer denies  
All the failures of the modern man  
No no no he cant pick sides  
Sees the failures of the modern man  
Now that its time to decide  
In his time he was a total man  
Taken from Caesars side  
Kept in silence just to prove whos wrong  
He no longer denies  
All the failures of the modern man  
No no no he cant pick sides  
Sees the failures of the modern man  
All the failures of the modern man
