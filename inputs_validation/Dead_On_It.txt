Riding in my Thunderbird on the freeway  
I turned on my radio to hear some music play  
I got a silly rapper talking silly shit instead  
And the only good rapper is one thats dead on it  
  
Uh Dead on it  
  
Shall we go back Yeah  
Lets go  
  
Negros from Brooklyn play the bass pretty good  
But the ones from Minneapolis play it like it oughta should  
A magnum fro is better when you got a poof on it  
And the to and fro is funky when the grease is dead on it  
  
Funky dead on it  
Uh dead on it on it  
  
Shall we go back Lets go  
  
They dead on it wow  
  
See the rappers problem usually stem from being tone deaf  
Pack the house then try to sing  
There wont be no one left ha ha on it  
Parking lots on fire brothers peelin out of the town  
They say in disgust they singin their guts  
Rappin done let us down down down  
You got to be dead on it  
  
Dead on it

All the sisters like it when you lick em on the knees

Nothing but whos paying the bills  
If you dont want to lick my knees Im sho your mama will  
  
Uh cause we cause we cause we dead on it  
  
Dead on it on it  
  
My beds a coffin Dracula aint got shit on me  
My nicknames HellsaPoppin Im badder than the Wicked Witch  
I got a gold tooth costs more than your house  
I got a diamond ring on four fingers each one the size of a mouse
