I fell asleep last night  
And I dreamed the night  
and almost half the day away  
I just got up so that  
I can hear her say  
Shes still in love  
and no one can take her love away  
Ooo love wakes me up everyday  
And I thought no one  
would ever make me feel this way  
It feels me up every time  
I hear her say  
Shes still in love  
and no one will take her love away  
I wanna be love  
  
And I mean all these words I said  
And you dont have to guess  
whats going on inside me head  
Just try to know  
All the things that our heart says  
Listen to love and always  
get love to lead the way  
Whenever you love  
  
You know for love  
Id go anywhere  
I would go there  
For love to the end of nowhere  
And for your love  
And for your love  
I would  
I would  
I would love  
To just spend all my time  
With a girl who makes me  
feel her love is mine  
Someone you see  
Who would only dream of me  
And she be in love  
just because she wanna be  
She wanna be loved  
  
Theres nothing better than love  
What in the world  
could you ever be thinking of  
Its better by far  
So let yourself reach for that star  
And go no matter how far  
To the one you love  
To love
