As so with that I thought Id take a final walk  
The tide of public opinion had started to abate  
The neighbours bless them had  
Turned out to be all talk  
I could see their frightened faces  
Peering at me trough the gate  
  
I was looking for an end to this for some kind of closure  
Time moved so rapidly I had no hope  
Of keeping track of it  
I thought of my friends who had died of exposure  
And I remembered other ones who  
Had died from the lack of it  
  
And in my best shoes I started falling  
Forward down the street  
I stopped at a church and jostled trough the crowd  
And love followed just behind me  
Panting at my feet  
At the steeple tore the stomach from a lonely little cloud  
  
Inside I sat seeking the presence of a God  
I searched trough the pictures in a  
Leatherbound book  
I found a woolly lamb dozing in an issue of blood  
And a gilled Jesus shivering on a  
Fishermans hook  
  
Babe  
It seems so long  
Since youve been gone away  
And I  
Just got to say  
That it grows darker with the day  
  
Back on the street I saw a great big smiling sun  
It was a Good day and an Evil day and  
All was bright and new  
And it seemed to me that most  
Destruction was beeing done  
By those who could not choose  
Between the two  
  
Amateurs dilettantes hacks cowboya clones  
The streets groan with little Caesars  
Napoleons and cunts  
With their building blocks and their tiny  
Plastic phones  
Counting on their fingers with crumbs  
Down their fronts  
  
I passed by your garden saw you with your flowers  
The Mangolias Camellias and Azaleas so sweet  
And I stood there invisible in the panicking crowds  
You looked so beautiful in the rising heat  
  
I smell smoke see little fires bursting on the lawns  
People carry on regardless listening to their hands  
Great cracks appear in the pavement  
The earth yawns  
Bored and disgusted to do us down  
  
Babe  
It seems so long  
Since youve been gone  
And I  
Just got to say  
That it grows darker with the day  
  
These streets are frozen now  
I come and go  
Full of a longing for something I do  
Not know  
My father sits slumped in the  
Deepening snow  
As I search in and out above  
About below  
  
Babe  
It seems so long  
Since you went away  
And I  
Just got to say  
That it grows darker with the day
