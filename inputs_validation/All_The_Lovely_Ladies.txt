All the lovely ladies in their finery tonight  
I wish that I could know them one by one  
All the handsome gentlemen with loving on their minds  
Strolling in to take the ladies home  
  
Bless you all and keep you on the road to tenderness  
Heaven can be yours just for now  
  
All the gentle strangers who by nature do not smile  
To everyone who cannot hold a pen  
To all you heavy rounders with a headache for your pains  
Who dread the thought of going round the bend  
  
Bless you all and keep you on the road to better things  
Heaven can be yours just for now  
  
To all the lovely ladies in their finery tonight  
I wish that I could kiss you while you knit  
To all the ones who learn to live with bein secondguessed  
Whose job it is to give more then to get  
  
Bless you all and keep you with the strength to understand  
Heaven can be yours just for now  
  
To all the little dreamers with a dream that cannot last  
To all the sleeping giants who must wake  
To every man who answers to the letter of the law  
And all the rest imprisoned by mistake  
  
Bless you all and keep you with the faith to let it pass  
Heaven can be yours just for now  
  
To all the lonely sailors who have trouble beeing seen  
To all of you with heartache that remains  
Maybe sometime later you might swim back into shore  
If someone could relieve you of your chains  
  
Bless you all and keep you all on the land or on the sea  
Heaven can be yours just for now
