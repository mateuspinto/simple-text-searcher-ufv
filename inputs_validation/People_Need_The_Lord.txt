Everyday they pass me by  
I can see it in their eyes  
Empty people filled with care  
Headed who knows where  
On they go through private pair  
Living fear to fear  
Laughter hides their silent cries  
Only Jesus hears  
Chorus  
People need the Lord  
People need the Lord  
At the end of broken dreams  
Hes the open door  
People need the Lord  
People need the Lord  
When will they realize  
People need the Lord  
We are called to take His light  
To a world where wrong seems right  
What could be too great a cost for  
Sharing life with one whos lost  
Through His love our hearts can feel  
All the grief they bear  
They must hear the words of life  
Only we can share  
People need the Lord  
People need the Lord  
At the end of broken dreams  
Hes the open door  
People need the Lord  
When will they realize  
That we must give our lives  
For people need the Lord  
People need the Lord  
People need the Lord
