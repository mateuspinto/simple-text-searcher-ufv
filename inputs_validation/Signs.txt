Youre weighed down with regret  
You cant see the road ahead  
Or the burden on your back  
It seems the trek will never end  
The winding paths that still descend  
And up above a sky washed black  
You just cant bear to look at that  
  
Chorus  
Follow the signs  
Open your eyes  
Read between the lines of what you see  
Look into the soul of reality  
Open your mind  
Look at the signs  
Never look back at yesterday  
Keep your gaze steady on the narrow way  
  
Now youve found the sacred tree  
You kneel upon the broken wheat  
You watch your burden fall away  
And all the things that you once sought  
Now are counted less than lost  
For now you see the light of day  
The signs were pointing all the way  
  
Chorus  
  
Follow the signs  
Open your eyes  
Look at the signs  
Open your mind  
Follow the signs  
  
Chorus
