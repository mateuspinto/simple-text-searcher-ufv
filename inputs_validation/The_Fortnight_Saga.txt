Business as usual at the harmony home  
Up for the weekend to see my father  
So Im the one beneath the unturned stone  
I begin the ritual fortnight saga  
Get in the cab bags packed with clothes  
Cassette player the jungle of hose  
A pair of shoes for walking in  
Out of the cab the doorbell rings  
  
Hungover greetings from the man in my life  
A hug a kiss and a mug by the fire  
He says I should need a woman I might like  
I drop my bags and walk right by her  
  
Get in the bath bubbles up high  
Cassette player plays in the night  
Shes at the door wants to come in  
Im in the bath I loudly sing  
  
Business as usual at the harmony home  
I cant believe it how time flies  
Im waving
