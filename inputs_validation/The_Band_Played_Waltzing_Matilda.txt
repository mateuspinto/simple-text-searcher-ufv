When I was a young man I carried my pack  
And I lived the free life of a rover  
From the murrays green basin to the dusty outback  
I waltzed my matilda all over  
Then in nineteen fifteen my country said son  
Its time to stop rambling cause theres work to be  
Done  
So they gave me a tin hat and they gave me a gun  
And they sent me away to the war  
And the band played Waltzing Matilda  
As we sailed away from the quay  
And amidst all the tears and the shouts and the  
Cheers  
We sailed off to Gallipoli  
  
How well I remember that terrible day  
When the blood stained the sand and the water  
And how in that hell that they called suvla bay  
We were butchered like lambs at the slaughter  
Johnny Turk he was ready he primed himself well  
He showered us with bullets he rained us with  
Shells  
And in five minutes flat hed blown us all to hell  
Nearly blew us right back to Australia  
But the band played waltzing Matilda  
As we stopped to bury our slain  
And we buried ours and the Turks buried theirs  
Then it started all over again  
  
Now those who were living did their best to survive  
In that mad world of blood death and fire  
And for seven long weeks I kept myself alive  
While the corpses around me piled higher  
Then a big Turkish shell knocked me arse over tit  
And when I woke up in my hospital bed  
And saw what it had done Christ I wished I was  
Dead  
Never knew there were worse things than dying  
And no more Ill go waltzing Matilda  
To the green bushes so far and near  
For to hump tent and pegs a man needs two legs  
No more waltzing Matilda for me  
  
So they collected the cripples the wounded and  
Maimed  
And they shipped us back home to Australia  
The legless the armless the blind and insane  
Those proud wounded heroes of suvla  
And as our ship pulled into circular quay  
I looked at the place where me legs used to be  
And thank Christ there was nobody waiting for me  
To grieve and to mourn and to pity  
And the band played Waltzing Matilda  
As they carried us down the gangway  
But nobody cheered they just stood and stared  
And they turned all their faces away  
  
And now every April I sit on my porch  
And I watch the parade pass before me  
I see my old comrades how proudly they march  
Reliving the or their dreams of past glory  
i see the old men all twisted and torn  
The forgotten heroes of a forgotten war  
And the young people ask me what are they  
Marching for  
And I ask myself the same question  
And the band plays Waltzing Matilda  
And the old men still answer to the call  
But year after year their numbers get fewer  
Some day no one will march there at all  
  
Waltzing Matilda Waltzing Matilda  
Wholl go aWaltzing Matilda with me
