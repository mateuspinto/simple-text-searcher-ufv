Do do do do do do do do do  
Cashmere hills filled with evergreens  
Flowin from the clouds down to meet the sea  
With the granite cliff  
Big Sur mount  
  
As a referee  
Crimson sunsets and golden dawns  
A mother deer with their newborn fawns  
All under Big Sur skies  
Big Sur mount  
Thats where I belong  
  
Big Sur Ive got plans for you  
Me and mine are going to  
Add ourselves to your lengthy list of lovers  
Big Sur mount  
  
And live in canyons covered in springtime green  
Wild birds and flowers to be heard and seen  
And with my old guitar  
Ill make up songs to sing  
Where bubbling springs from the mountainside  
Join the Big Sur river to the oceanside  
Where the kids can look for sea shells at low tide  
Big Sur my astrology it says that I am made to be  
Where the rugged mountain meets the water  
  
And so while stars shine brightly from up above  
The fog rolls in through a redwood grove  
And to my dying fire I think Ill add a log  
  
From time to time I must go away  
The thoughts of Big Sur wont let me stay  
Away from Big Sur  
Oh Big Sur
