Without going out of my door  
I can know all things on earth  
without looking out of my window  
I can know the ways of heaven  
The farther one travels  
the less one knows  
the less one really knows  
Without going out of your door  
You can know all things on earth  
without looking out of your window  
you can know the ways of heaven  
The farther one travels  
the less one knows  
the less one really knows  
Arrive without travelling  
See all without looking  
Do all without doing
