Back seat of her daddys car  
I was tryin not to go too far  
Kept thinkin bout the words the preacher man said  
Lightning flashed across the sky  
I saw love in a young girls eyes  
And thats a look you never forget  
  
Seventeen  
Only comes once in a lifetime  
Dont it just fly by wild and free  
Goin anyway the wind blew baby  
Seventeen  
Livin on crazy dreams  
Rock and roll and faded blue jeans  
And standin on the edge of everything  
Seventeen  
  
Legs hangin off the bayou bridge  
Feedin fish potato chips  
And talkin bout the mysteries of the universe  
Yeah the world was somewhere else  
We had the summer all to ourselves  
And the stars went off like fireworks  
  
Seventeen  
Only comes once in a lifetime  
Dont it just fly by wild and free  
Goin anyway the wind blew baby  
Seventeen  
Livin on crazy dreams  
Rock and roll and faded blue jeans  
And standin on the edge of everything  
Seventeen  
  
Seventeen  
Only comes once in a lifetime  
Well dont it just fly by wild and free  
Goin anyway the wind blew baby  
Seventeen  
Livin on crazy dreams  
Rock and roll and faded blue jeans  
And standin on the edge of everything  
Seventeen  
Yeah seventeen  
Sweet seventeen
