Hurray I awake from yesterday  
Alive but the war is here to stay  
So my love catherina and me  
Decide to take our last walk thru the noise to the sea  
Not to die but to be reborn  
Away from the lands so battred and torn  
Forever forever  
Oh say can you see its really such A mess  
Every inch of earth is A fighting nest  
Giant pencil and lipstickTube shaped things  
Continue to rain and cause screamin pain  
And the arctic stains from silver blue to bloody red  
As our feet find the sand  
And the sea is straight ahead  
Straight up ahead  
Well its too bad that our friends cant be with us today  
Well its too bad  
The machine that we built  
Would never save us thats what they say  
Thats why they aint comin with us today  
And they also said its impossible  
For A man to live and breathe undrerwater  
Forever was A main complaint  
Yeah and they also threw this in my face they said  
Anyway you know good and well  
It would be beyond the will of god  
And the grace of the king  
Grace of the king  
Yeah  
Ooo  
So my darling and I make love in the sand  
To salute the last moment ever on dry land  
Our machine it has done its work played its part well  
Without A scratch on our body when we bid it farewell  
Starfish and giant foams greet us with A smile  
Before our heads go under we take our last look at the killing noise  
Of the out of style  
The out of style out of style oh yeah  
Oooo  
So down and down and down and down we go  
Hurry my darlin we mustnt be late  
For the show  
Neptune champion games to an aqua world is so my dear  
Right this way smiles A mermaid  
I can hear atlantis full of cheer  
Atlantis full of cheer  
I can hear atlantis full of cheer  
Oh yeah
