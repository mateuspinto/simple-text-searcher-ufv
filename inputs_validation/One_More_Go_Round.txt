Workin on a thing workin on a thing  
Funny little thing I know  
Sure got to like it  
Only thing I got to show you  
Running around the room  
In my Fruit O The Loom  
A cup of coffee from King Tuts tomb  
Save me Lumalammalu  
Sure enough I must have been mokus  
And so out of focus  
To miss the first half of the show  
Oh It gets to the end  
We get to run it again  
Just like before  
One more go round  
  
Drank myself some wine back in 69  
I was fooling around with my friends  
In my spare time  
Life along the river  
Knobby little knees in the Summer breeze  
Hammock and a couple of trees  
Swing low if you please  
Oh I must have been mokus  
And so out of focus  
I missed the whole half of the show  
Come to the end  
And they run it again  
Same as before  
One more go round  
  
After all this time of fooling around  
It and never having nothing to show  
Yeah Im happy to say  
That I finally found it  
Right underneath my own nose  
Oh I must have been mokus  
And so out of focus  
I missed the first half of the show  
Please dont let it end  
I want it again  
Just like before  
One more go round
