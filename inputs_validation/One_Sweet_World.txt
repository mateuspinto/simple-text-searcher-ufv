Nine planets round the sun  
Only one does the sun embrace  
Upon this watered one  
So much to we take for granted  
  
So let us sleep outside tonight  
Lay down in the mothers arms  
For here we can rest safely  
  
If green should slip to grey  
Would our hearts still bloody beat  
If the mountains crumble away  
And the river dry  
Would it stop the stepping feet  
  
Take all that we can get  
When its done  
Nobody left to bury  
Nobody left to dig the holes  
And here we will rest safely  
  
One sweet world  
Around this star is spinning  
One sweet world  
In her breath Im swimming  
And here we will rest in peace
