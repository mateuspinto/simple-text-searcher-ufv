If you see my baby  
With another man  
Keep it a secret if you can  
  
If you see my baby  
With another man  
Dont tell me even if you can  
  
You know I could not stand the pain  
So if you think you are my friend  
  
I hope you never see her  
With another man  
But if you do dont you understand  
  
You know I could not stand the pain  
So if you think you are my friend  
  
Shes everything I longed for  
She took so long to find  
But Id be lost if she changed her mind  
  
If you see my baby  
If you see my baby  
If you see my baby  
If you see my baby
