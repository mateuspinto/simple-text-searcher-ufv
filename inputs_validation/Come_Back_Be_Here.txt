You said it in a simple way  
4 AM the second day  
How strange that I dont know you at all  
Stumbled through the long goodbye  
One last kiss then catch your flight  
Right when I was just about to fall  
  
I told myself dont get attached  
But in my mind I play it back  
Spinning faster than the plane that took you  
  
And this is when the feeling sinks in  
I dont wanna miss you like this  
Come back be here come back be here  
I guess youre in New York today  
I dont wanna need you this way  
Come back be here come back be here  
  
The delicate beginning rush  
The feeling you can know so much  
Without knowing anything at all  
And now that I can put this down  
If I had known what I know now  
I never would have played so nonchalant  
  
Taxi cabs and busy streets  
That never bring you back to me  
I cant help but wish you took me with you  
  
And this is when the feeling sinks in  
I dont wanna miss you like this  
Come back be here come back be here  
I guess youre in London today  
And I dont wanna need you this way  
Come back be here come back be here  
  
This is falling in love in the cruelest way  
This is falling for you and you are worlds away  
  
New York be here  
But youre in London and I break down  
Cause its not fair that youre not around  
  
This is when the feeling sinks in  
I dont wanna miss you like this  
Come back be here come back be here  
I guess youre in New York today  
And I dont wanna need you this way  
Come back be here come back be here  
  
I dont wanna miss you like this  
Come back be here  
Come back be here
