Jesus Jesus whats it all about  
Trying to clout these little ingrates into shape  
When I was their age all the lights went out  
There was no time to whine or mope about  
And even now part of me flies over  
Dresden at angels one five  
Though theyll never fathom it begind my  
Sarcasm desperate memories lie  
  
Sweetheart sweetheart are you fast asleep Good  
Cause thats the only time that I can really speak to you  
And there is something that Ive locked away  
A memory that is too painful  
To withstand the light of day  
  
When we came back from the war the banners and  
Flags hung on everyones door  
We danced and we sang in the street and  
The church bells rang  
But burning in my heart  
My memory smolders on  
Of the gunners dying words on the intercom
