Kanye West  
Mr West is in the buildin  
Swagga on a hundred thousand trillion  
Ay yo I know I got it first  
Im Christopher Columbus and yall just the pilgrims  
Thanksgiving do we even got a question  
 I pass the dressing  
My attitude is tattooed that mean its permanent  
So I guess we should address it huh  
My swagga is Mcjagga  
Every time I breathe on the track I asthma attack it  
Why he so mad for Why he gotta have it  
Cuz I slave my whole life now Im the master  
Naaaaanaaaaanaaaaaaa  
How it feel to wake up and be the shit and the urine  
Naaaaanaaaaanaaaaaaa  
Tryna get that koby number one over jordon  
  
JayZ  
Gotta bop like this  
Cant wear skinny jeans  
Cuz my knots dont fit  
No one on the corner  
Gotta pocket like this  
So I rock Roc jeans  
Cuz my knots so thick  
You can learn how to dress  
Just by  
Jocking my fresh  
Jocking jocking my fresh  
Jocking jocking my fresh  
Follow my steps  
Its the road to success  
Where the niggas think you thorough  
And the girls say yes  
But I cant teach you my swag  
You can pay for school  
But you cant buy class  
School of hard knocks  
Im a grad  
All blue Yankee  
Is my graduation cap  
Hoooooooovvvvaaa  
Dipping different rovas   
Wipping with the soda   
Hoooooooovvvvaaa  
Could you even have any doubt  
After doutbt it was ova  
  
Lil Wayne  
No one on the corner has swagger like moi Chuch  
But Im too clean for these boys  
I require what I desire  
I got stripes Adidas  
Mami scream papi no mas  
Run up in yo shit just me no moss  
Runnin this shit like I got four thighs  
No one has swagger like these 4 guys  
When it comes to styles I got several  
Sharper than a swagger dagger all metal  
And my Juelz blue and yellow  
Type of shit that make em call you Carmelo  
Rules as follows stay true to the ghetto  
Write yo name on the bullet make you feel special  
Ha What the fuck you boys talking about  
I know its us cuz we the only thing you talk about  
And Im gone Bye  
  
T I  
You go see weezy for the wordplay  
Jeezy for the bird play  
Kanyeezy for diversity and me for controversy  
All my verses picture perfect  
And they meant to serve a purpose  
You aint living what you kicking and you worthless  
Looking from the surface it may seem that I got reason to be nervous  
Then observe my work and see that my adversity was worth it  
Verses autobiographical absolutely classical last thing Im worried bout is
what another rapper do  
Aint nobody hot as me even if they rap they ass off blast off and have
outstanding qualities  
Sell alotta records I respect and salute that  
But spitting real life on hot beats Im the truth at  
You kick it like me no exaggeration necessary  
Living revolutionary nothing less than legendary  
Gangsta shit hereditary got it from my dad  
Flow colder than February with extraordinary swag
