Everybody tells me we love your songs  
Your soul is precious but it just aint good enough  
You need a single to help you through  
Program directors they all make the rules  
I said youre kidding youre putting me on  
What about the Constitution freedom of expression  
Listen to the music just feel the sound  
Love is the motion thats what makes the world go around  
  
Chorus  
Sing Songs of Freedom  
Bring joy to the world  
Sing Songs of Freedom  
Bring joy to the world  
  
Everybody listen stop and take some time  
To understand the world situation  
There is no meaning in fighting the way we do  
Lets come together and forgive each other  
  
Chorus
