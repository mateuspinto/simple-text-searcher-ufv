Well I sold the farm to take my woman  
Where she used to be  
We left our kin and all our friends  
Back there in Tennessee  
And I bought those one way tickets  
She had often begged me for  
And they took us to the streets of Baltimore  
  
Well her heart was filled with gladness  
When she saw those city lights  
She said the prettiest place on earth was  
Baltimore at night  
Well a man feels proud to give his woman  
What shes longing for  
And I kinda liked the streets of Baltimore  
  
Then I got myself a factory job  
I ran an old machine  
And I bought a little cottage  
In a neighborhood serene  
And every night when Id come home  
With every muscle sore  
Shed drag me through the streets of Baltimore  
  
Well I did my best to bring her back  
To what she used to be  
Then I soon learned she loved those bright lights  
More than she loved me  
Now Im a going back on that same train  
That brought me here before  
While my baby walks the streets of Baltimore  
While my baby walks the streets of Baltimore
