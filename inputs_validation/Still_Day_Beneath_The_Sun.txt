There is a light that hits the gloom around  
Shows the footprints round this grave  
Dried up roses scattered on the mound  
Honoring the one engraved  
  
Will ever the morning  
Carry away  
The souls of those for whom we cry  
  
Leaving grieving  
Seeking meeting  
Binding unwinding  
Sighing You  
  
Still day beneath the sun  
Asking you who is the one  
And when the day is late  
We know who must forever wait  
  
Black procession through the narrow aisles  
Anothers gone for all to see  
Near the site for one who lost his trials  
Sleeping neath the ground is me  
  
Will ever the morning  
Carry away  
The souls of those for whom we cry  
  
Leaving grieving  
Seeking meeting  
Binding unwinding  
Sighing You  
  
Still day beneath the sun  
Asking you who is the one  
And when the day is late  
We know who must forever wait
