Now I will tell you buster that I aint a fan of Custer  
And the General he dont ride well anymore  
To some he was a hero but to me his score was zero  
And the General he dont ride well anymore  
Now Custer done his fightin without too much excitin  
And the General he dont ride well anymore  
General Custer come in pumpin when the men were out a huntin  
But the General he dont ride well anymore  
With victories he was swimmin he killed children dogs and women  
But the General he dont ride well anymore  
Crazy Horse sent out the call to Sitting Bull and Gall  
And the General he dont ride well anymore  
Now Custer split his men well he wont do that again  
Cause the General he dont ride well anymore  
Twelve thousand warriors waited they were unanticipated  
And the General he dont ride well anymore  
Its not called an Indian victory but a bloody massacre  
And the General he dont ride well anymore  
There might have been more enthusin if us Indians had been losin  
But the General he dont ride well anymore  
General George ACuster oh his yellow hair had lustre  
But the General he dont ride well anymore  
For now the Generals silent he got barbered violent  
And the General he dont ride well anymore  
Oh the General he dont ride well anymore
