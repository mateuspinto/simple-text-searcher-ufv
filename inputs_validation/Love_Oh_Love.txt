Show the world and all its people  
All the wonders love can bring  
Give us strength and understanding  
Give us all one song to sing  
Let the music play  
Play it loud and make it clear  
Its time to stand up  
To a new world that is now so near  
From the bottom to the top  
To the leaders of the land  
We all have one heart  
Everyone of us must lend a hand  
And let there be joy in the world  
And let there be no sorrow  
Let there be  
And let there be peace on earth  
And let there be peace on earth  
For all the world  
Weve got to see  
  
That love oh love  
What a blessed thing oh yeah  
Say it loud  
Make it clear today  
All the walls are falling down  
No more children off to war  
If we search in our hearts  
All the suffering will be no more  
And let there be joy in the world  
And let there be no sorrow  
For all gods children  
Let them see  
That love oh love  
What a blessed thing oh yeah  
Say it loud  
Make it clear today  
And freedom no more lies  
We can save this world if we try  
One world I know we can make it  
Yes its only in your heart  
Yes its only in your dreams  
You can climb the highest mountains  
You can make the whole world sing  
Love oh love  
What a blessed thing oh yeah  
Say it loud  
Make it clear today
