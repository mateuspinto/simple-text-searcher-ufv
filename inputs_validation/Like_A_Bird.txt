You look so pretty lying there with dreamlands smile upon your face  
Your golden curls in disarray upon your starched white pillow case  
The soft blue satin covers pulled up tight around your lovely throat  
It almost makes me want to go destroy the message on the note  
  
The note I left upon your perfumed stationary by the phone  
I hate to think about you waking up at dawn to find me gone  
It hurts me so to get up in the middle of the night and go  
But thinking back I do remember faintly that I told you so  
  
I told you I was like a bird a free and wild and restless thing  
And even though I take a mate and build a nest in early spring  
When summer winds have had their day and winter clouds are flying high  
Instinctively I spread my wings and fly  
  
I only know that I must go and nothing here must hold me back  
I like the love you gave me and the tender way you scratched my back  
I like your warm sweet kisses and the way you cook your ham and eggs  
I like the way the suntan lotion softened up your lovely legs  
  
I like the static noise I heard when you would sit and brush your hair  
The way you gave yourself to me and never asked to go nowhere  
But most of all I like the way you always smiled and never frowned  
The way you took this chance for love and took me just for what I am  
  
I told you I was like a bird a free and wild and restless thing  
And even though I take a mate and build a nest in early spring  
When summer winds have had their day and winter clouds are flying high  
Instinctively I spread my wings and fly  
  
And now my darling as I leave I fight the yearning in my blood  
To wake you up and love you just once more before I go for good  
But somehow I am fighting back my passion for I cannot stay  
And someday youll look back and know the best it ended up this way  
  
I told you I was like a bird a free and wild and restless thing  
And even though I take a mate and build a nest in early spring  
When summer winds have had their day and winter clouds are flying high  
Instinctively I spread my wings and fly  
  
I fly I fly I fly
