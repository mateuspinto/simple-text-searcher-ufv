From night to dawn  
You soldiered on did ya  
Each day is a gift  
But you led us strong  
And kept us on did ya  
Like each day is a gift  
  
I never thought that Id be here with you  
Saying all these words that I have to  
But after all is said and all is done  
I never meant to ever hurt no one  
  
And nothing has to change  
You and I are strange  
Passing in the night  
Between the darkness and the rain  
  
At the crack of dawn  
You grab my arm did ya  
Each day was a gift  
You told me slow  
Before I move on  
You must remember each day is a gift  
I never understood what was for you  
Could never be for me thisll have to do  
But after all you said and all youve done  
I know you never meant to hurt no one  
  
Nothing has to change  
You and I can be strange  
Passing in the days  
Between the morning and the rain Repeat x 2  
  
I can see you now  
Its like you were never gone  
  
From dusk to dawn  
You soldiered on  
Like each day was a gift  
Oh you led us strong  
But you couldnt hold on  
And thats fine  
Cause each day was a gift  
  
I dont know when  
Ill be home  
So save a place for me til I get there  
I dont know when  
Ill be home  
So save a place for me  
  
For me Repeat x 4
