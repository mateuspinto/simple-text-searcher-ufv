If all our love is through  
If you found someone new  
Then I want to hear it from you  
  
If there is no mistake  
And if my heart must break  
I want to hear it from you  
  
Just the thought of losing you  
Is more than I can stand  
But this hurt would be much worse  
If I heard it secondhand  
If theres no hope at all  
If my world must fall  
I want to hear it from you  
  
So tell me now  
If things are not the way they used to be  
I want to hear it from your lips  
You owe that much to me  
  
If all our love is through  
If you found someone new  
Then I want to hear it from you
