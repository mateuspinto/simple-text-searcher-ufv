Here is your crown  
And your seal and rings  
And here is your love  
For all things  
  
Here is your cart  
And your cardboard and piss  
And here is your love  
For all of this  
  
May everyone live  
And may everyone die  
Hello my love  
And my love Goodbye  
  
Here is your wine  
And your drunken fall  
And here is your love  
Your love for it all  
  
Here is your sickness  
Your bed and your pan  
And here is your love  
For the woman the man  
  
May everyone live  
And may everyone die  
Hello my love  
And my love Goodbye  
  
And here is the night  
The night has begun  
And here is your death  
In the heart of your son  
  
And here is the dawn  
Until death do us part  
And here is your death  
In your daughters heart  
  
May everyone live  
And may everyone die  
Hello my love  
And my love Goodbye  
  
And here you are hurried  
And here you are gone  
And here is the love  
That its all built upon  
  
Here is your cross  
Your nails and your hill  
And here is your love  
That lists where it will  
  
May everyone live  
And may everyone die  
Hello my love  
And my love Goodbye
