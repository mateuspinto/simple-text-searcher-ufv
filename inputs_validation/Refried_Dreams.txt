Last Monday mornin you left with no warnin  
I started goin insane  
Well I headed South out of Del Rio Texas  
With a hell of a load on my brain  
I kept on goin without even knowin  
How much your love really means  
Now Im messed up in Mexico  
Livin on refried dreams  
  
Im down here in Mexico  
Sick as a dog  
My head is poundin in this border town fog  
Down to my last dime and comin apart at the seams  
Im messed up in Mexico  
Livin on refried dreams  
  
This picture aint pretty  
Im ragged and dirty  
And wonderin what Im doin here  
Shootin tequila  
Wantin to kill ya  
And wishin to God you were near  
  
So full of your memory  
But feelin so empty  
Ive run out of my selfesteem  
Now Im messed up in Mexico  
Livin on refried dreams  
  
Im down here in Mexico  
Sick as a dog  
My head is poundin in this border town fog  
Down to my last dime and comin apart at the seams  
Im messed up in Mexico  
Livin on refried dreams  
  
Im down here in Mexico  
Sick as a dog  
My head is poundin in this border town fog  
Down to my last dime and comin apart at the seams  
Im messed up in Mexico  
Livin on refried dreams  
  
Oh Im messed up in Mexico  
Livin on refried dreams
