I cross the green mountain  
I sit by the stream  
Heaven blazing in my head  
I I dreamt a monstrous dream  
  
Something came up  
Out of the sea  
Swept through the land of  
The rich and the free  
  
I look into the eyes  
Of my merciful friend  
And then I ask myself  
Is this the end  
  
Memories linger  
Sad yet sweet  
And I think of the souls  
In heaven who will be  
  
Alters are burning  
The flames far and wide  
The fool has crossed over  
From the other side  
  
They tip their caps  
From the top of the hill  
You can feel them come  
All brave blood do spill  
  
Along the dim  
Atlantic line  
The rappers land  
Lasts for miles behind  
  
The lights coming forward  
And the streets are broad  
All must yield  
To the avenging God  
  
The world is old  
The world is great  
Lessons of life  
Cant be learned in a day  
  
I watch and I wait  
And I listen while I stand  
To the music that comes  
From a far better land  
  
Close the eyes of our captain  
Peace may he know  
His long night is done  
The great leader is laid low  
  
He was ready to fall  
He was quick to defend  
Killed outright he was  
By his own men  
  
Its the last days last hour  
Of the last happy year  
I feel that the unknown  
The world is so dear  
  
Pride will vanish  
And glory will rot  
But virtue lives  
And cannot be forgot  
  
The bells  
Of evening have rung  
Theres blasphemy  
On the end of the tongue  
  
Let them say that I walked  
In fair natures light  
And that I was loyal  
To truth and to right  
  
Serve God and meet your full  
Look upward beyond  
Beyond the darkness that masks  
The surprises of dawn  
  
In the deep green grasses  
And the blood stained woods  
They never dreamed of surrendering  
They fell where they stood  
  
Stars fell over Alabama  
I saw each star  
Youre walking in dreams  
Whoever you are  
  
Chilled are the skies  
Keen is the frost  
The grounds froze hard  
And the morning is lost  
  
A letter to mother  
Came today  
Gunshot wound to the breast  
Is what it did say  
  
But hell be better soon  
Hes in a hospital bed  
But hell never be better  
Hes already dead  
  
Im ten miles outside the city  
And Im lifted away  
In an ancient light  
That is not of day  
  
They were calm they were gloomed  
We knew them all too well  
We loved each other more than  
We ever dared to tell
