You know  
You know listen to me  
  
Mama help I fell in love with a young girl  
  
Thats true so true  
Youre the only girl I love to  
  
My heart was soakin and I will be in a young world  
  
So true so true listen  
  
I wasnt tryin to lead her on  
See I didnt wanna be alone  
But when she smiles she braught me home  
So I brought her home  
Its not that the fealin of love is gone  
Cant expect a car little girl to be grown  
I cant give a fuck what so and so says  
Crushes hurt both ways  
  
Chorus  
What on earth what Im suppose to do  
What on earth what Im suppose to do  
What on earth what Im suppose to do  
Somebody tell me what Im suppose to do  
  
Mama help I fell in love with a young girl  
  
Chorus  
What on earth what Im suppose to do  
Young girl so in love with you  
What on earth what Im suppose to do  
What on earth what Im suppose to do  
What on earth what Im suppose to do  
Somebody tell me what Im suppose to do  
  
My heart was soakin and I will be in a young world  
  
What on earth what Im suppose to do  
Young  
Young girl so in love with you  
  
The single girls are out tonight  
But you have one word my heart one life  
And Im not lookin around  
So why you lookin down  
What you lookin down for  
  
I fucked up a long time ago  
See I should have never let you know  
See I couldnt give a fuck what tabloids say  
As the people magazine  
And crushes hurt both ways  
  
Chorus  
What on earth what Im suppose to do  
What on earth what Im suppose to do  
What on earth what Im suppose to do  
Somebody tell me what Im suppose to do  
  
Mama help I fell in love with a young girl  
  
Chorus  
What on earth what Im suppose to do  
Young girl so in love with you  
What on earth what Im suppose to do  
What on earth what Im suppose to do  
What on earth what Im suppose to do  
Somebody tell me what Im suppose to do  
  
My heart was soakin and I will be in a young world  
  
What on earth what Im suppose to do  
Young girl so in love with you  
  
JayZ  
Hove got a young girl  
Hove got a young girl  
Still not quite 21  
So high string  
Such a vibrant thing  
I introduce myself hi miss thing  
Youre 19  
No youre lighting in a bottle I give you a ring tomorrow  
The scene that follows  
Screams of horror  
Classic Steven King novel  
Momma dont think you should take someone so advanced in romance  
You should just wait  
Poppa dont preach  
Hov dont bight  
Hopin threw it I might mo your life  
Cause ima show you right  
Proper etecit how to hold your knife  
Keep it competitive with Opras ice  
Be like Janet take control of your life  
  
Chorus  
What on earth what Im suppose to do  
young girl  
What on earth what Im suppose to do young girl  
What on earth what Im suppose to do  
young girl  
Somebody tell me what Im suppose to do  
young girl  
  
Mama help I fell in love with a young girl  
  
Chorus  
What on earth what Im suppose to do  
To young Im never to young  
Young girl so in love with you  
Cause Im never to young  
What on earth what Im suppose to do  
To young Im never to young  
What on earth what Im suppose to do  
Cause Im never to young  
What on earth what Im suppose to do  
To young Im never to young  
Somebody tell me what Im suppose to do  
Cause Im never to young  
  
My heart was soakin and I will be in a young world  
  
What on earth what Im suppose to do  
Young girl so in love with you  
  
This is where the story begins baby
