I see it all through my window it seems  
Never failing like millions of eels  
All that is wrong  
No time to be won  
Only to do  
What can be done  
Peak hour  
Peak hour  
Peak hour  
Minds are subject to what should be done  
Problem solved time cannot be won  
One hour a day  
One hour a night  
Sees crowds of people  
Homeaimed for flight  
Peak hour  
Peak hour  
Peak hour  
It makes me want to run out and tell them  
Theyve got time  
Take a step back out and warn them  
Ive found out Ive got time  
Minds are subject to what should be done  
Problem solved time cannot be won  
One hour a day  
One hour a night  
Sees crowds of people  
Homeaimed for flight  
Peak hour  
Peak hour  
Peak hour
