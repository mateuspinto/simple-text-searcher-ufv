Got me the strangest woman  
Believe me this tricks no cinch  
But I really get her going  
When I whip out my big ten inch  
  
Record of a band that plays the blues  
Well a band that plays its blues  
She just love my big ten inch  
Record of her favorite blues  
  
Last night I tried to tease her  
I gave my love a little pinch  
She said now stop that jivin  
Now whip out your big ten inch  
  
Record of a band that plays those blues  
Well a band that plays the blues  
She just loves my big 10 inch  
Record of her favorite blues  
  
I I I cover her with kisses  
And when were in a lovers clinch  
She gets all excited  
When she begs for my big ten inch  
  
Record of a band that plays those blues  
Well a band that plays the blues  
She just love my big ten inch  
Record of her favorite blues  
  
My girl dont go for smokin  
And liquor just make her flinch  
Seems she dont go for nothin  
Cept for my big ten inch  
  
Record of a band that plays the blues  
Band that play the blues  
She just love my big ten inch  
Record of her favorite blues
