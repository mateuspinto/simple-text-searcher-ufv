Let me take you on a trip  
Around the world and back  
And you wont have to move  
You just sit still  
Now let your mind do the walking  
And let my body do the talking  
Let me show you the world in my eyes  
Ill take you to the highest mountain  
To the depths of the deepest sea  
We wont need a map believe me  
Now let my body do the moving  
And let my hands do the soothing  
Let me show you the world in my eyes  
Thats all there is  
Nothing more than you can feel now  
Thats all there is  
Let me put you on a ship  
On a long long trip  
Your lips close to my lips  
All the islands in the ocean  
All the heavens in the motion  
Let me show you the world in my eyes  
Thats all there is  
Nothing more than you can touch now  
Thats all there is  
Let me show you the world in my eyes
