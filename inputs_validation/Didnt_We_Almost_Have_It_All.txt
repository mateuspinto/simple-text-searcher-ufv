Remember when we held on in the rain  
The night we almost lost it  
Once again we can take the night into tomorrow  
Living on feelings  
Touching you I feel it all again  
  
Chorus  
Didnt we almost have it all  
When love was all we had worth giving  
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend  
Loving you makes life worth living  
Didnt we almost have it all  
The night we held on till the morning  
You know youll never love that way again  
Didnt we almost have it all  
  
The way you used to touch me felt so fine  
We kept our hearts together down the line  
A moment in the soul can last forever  
Comfort and keep us  
Help me bring the feeling back again  
  
Chorus  
  
Didnt we have the best of times  
When love was young and new  
Couldnt we reach inside and find  
The world of me and you  
Well never lose it again  
Cause once you know what love is  
You never let it end  
  
Didnt we almost have it all  
When love was all we had worth giving  
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend  
Loving you makes life worth living  
  
Didnt we almost have it all  
The night we held on till the morning  
You know youll never love that way again  
Didnt we almost have it all
