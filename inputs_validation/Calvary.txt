The savior alone carried the cross  
For all of my debt He paid the cost  
Salvation complete  
Now forever Im free  
Calvary covers it all  
  
Calvary covers it all  
My sin and shame dont count anymore  
All praise to the One who has ransomed my soul  
Calvary covers it all  
  
No power on earth not even the grave  
Can separate us from mercy and grace  
He is faithful to save  
Oh His blood never fails  
Calvary covers it all  
  
Calvary covers it all  
My sin and shame dont count anymore  
All praise to the One who has ransomed my soul  
Calvary covers it all  
  
No one but Jesus  
Can make us pure as snow  
We stand in Your freedom  
Calvary covers it all  
  
Calvary covers it all  
My sin and shame dont count anymore  
All praise to the One who has ransomed my soul  
Calvary covers it all  
x2  
  
All praise to the One who has ransomed my soul  
Calvary covers it all  
x2
