I had a king in a tenement castle  
Lately hes taken to painting the pastel walls brown  
Hes taken the curtains down  
Hes swept with the broom of contempt  
And the rooms have an empty ring  
Hes cleaned with the tears  
Of an actor who fears for the laughters sting  
  
Chorus  
I cant go back there anymore  
You know my keys wont fit the door  
You know my thoughts dont fit the man  
They never can they never can  
  
I had a king dressed in dripdry and paisley  
Lately hes taken to saying Im crazy and blind  
He lives in another time  
Ladies in gingham still blush  
While he sings them of wars and wine  
But I in my leather and lace  
I can never become that kind  
  
Chorus  
  
I had a king in a saltrusted carriage  
Who carried me off to his country for marriage too soon  
Beware of the power of moons  
Theres no one to blame  
No theres no one to name as a traitor here  
The kings on the road  
And the queens in the grove till the end of the year  
  
Chorus
