There is a name I love to hear  
I love to sing its worth  
It sounds like music in my ear  
The sweetest name on Earth  
  
Oh how I love Jesus  
Oh how I love Jesus  
Oh how I love Jesus  
Because He first loved me  
  
It tells me of a Saviors love  
Who died to set me free  
It tells me of His precious blood  
The sinners perfect plea  
  
It tells of one whose loving heart  
Can fell my deepest woe  
Who in each sorrow hears a part  
That none can bear below
