I know what you think in the morning  
When the sun shines on the ground  
And shows what you have done  
It shows where your mind has gone  
And you swearing to your parents  
That it will never happen again  
I know I know oh oh what that means I know oh oh oh oh  
  
That you all have guns  
And you never put the safety on  
And you all have plans  
To take it to take it dont take it take it take it  
  
Im trying Im trying to sleep  
Im trying Im trying to sleep  
But I cant but I cant when you all have  
Guns for hands yeah  
  
Im trying Im trying to sleep  
Im trying Im trying to sleep  
But I cant but I cant when you all have  
Guns for hands yeah  
  
Lets take this a second at a time  
Lets take this one song this one rhyme  
Together lets breathe  
Together to the beat  
But theres hope out the window  
So thats where well go  
Lets go outside and all join hands  
But until then youll never understand  
  
That you all have guns  
And you never put the safety on  
And you all have plans  
To take it to take it dont take it take it take it  
  
Im trying Im trying to sleep  
Im trying Im trying to sleep  
But I cant but I cant when you all have  
Guns for hands yeah  
  
Weve turned our hands to guns trade in our thumbs for ammunition  
I must forewarn you of my disorder or my condition  
Cause when the sun sets it upsets whats left of my invested interest  
Interested in putting my fingers to my head  
The solution is I see a whole room of these mutant kids  
Fused at the wrist I simply tell them they should shoot at this  
Simply suggest my chest and this confused music its  
Obviously best for them to turn their guns to a fist  
  
Im trying Im trying to sleep  
Im trying Im trying to sleep  
But I cant but I cant when you all have  
Guns for hands  
  
Im trying Im trying to sleep  
Im trying Im trying to sleep  
But I cant but I cant when you all have  
Guns for hands
