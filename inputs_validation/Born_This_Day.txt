Christmas is the day  
The angels came to say  
They said be not afraid  
For born on this day  
Born to save is Christ The Lord  
Sheperds watched by night  
When that angel appeared from on high  
And said be not afraid for born on this day  
Born to save is Christ The Lord  
Christ the Lord  
Wise men from afar  
Said they followed the eastern star  
Followed it to this place  
For born on this day  
Born to save is Christ The Lord  
Born this day  
Christmas day  
Born to save the world is Christ the Lord  
2X  
they said be not afraid  
For born on this day  
Born to save is Christ The Lord  
Christ The Lord  
Hes GOd the Father God the Son and Holy Spirit  
Christmas is the day  
When the angels appeared to say  
They said be not afraid  
For born on this day  
Born to save is Christ The Lord  
Born this day  
Christmas day  
Born to save the world is Christ the Lord  
4X  
They said be not afraid  
For born on this day  
Born to save our lives  
His name is Jesus Christ  
He is Emmanuel  
He is Christ  
And he is born to save  
Hes Christ the Lord
