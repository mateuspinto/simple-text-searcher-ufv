Love walk out the door  
Its a cryin shame  
It dont happen no more  
Love walk out the door  
Its a cryin shame  
It dont happen no more  
  
Im Readin your letter  
I dont know weather  
To call you up and talk again  
When i saw the name you signed  
Goin through my mind it was a memory  
Of way back when  
  
Now All That I can tell you is good luck baby  
Im sorry that it couldnt be me  
Cause it felt to right and if we held on tight  
Id be with you tonight  
  
We never should have let our  
Love walk out the door  
Its a cryin shame  
It dont happen no more  
  
Love walk out the door  
Its a cryin shame  
It dont happen no more  
  
I wont forget the summer  
My heart was like a drummer  
Just beating every night away  
Walkin in the sun with you  
Baby we were one i knew  
Love was really ours to stay  
  
Now all that i have left is a faded picture  
You belong to her today  
And the memory of you and me  
Is just a used to be  
  
We never should have let our  
Love walk out the door  
Its a cryin shame  
It dont happen no more  
  
Love walk out the door  
Its a cryin shame  
It dont happen no more  
Shame it dont happen  
  
Love slipped through my hands  
Its a cryin shame  
I cant play in your band  
Love fell at my feet its a cryin shame  
The bitter is in the sweet  
  
Oh nooh no  
  
Love walk out the door  
Its a cryin shame  
It dont happen no more  
  
Love walk out the door  
Its a cryin shame  
It dont happen no more
