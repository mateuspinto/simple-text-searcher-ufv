Within these walls of without you  
I feel naked and without a friend  
Love was once there all around you  
Now I feel our relationship end  
I cant put my finger on a reason  
I have no answer to give at all  
Within these walls of without you  
I sit crying but the tears will not fall  
  
Within these walls a heart broken  
And memories of a holiday  
The sea leaves my heart so unspoken  
With the lights folding up on the waves  
  
I dont think Ill ever have the answer  
I have no answer to give at all  
Within these walls of without you  
I sit crying but the tears will not fall  
  
No unhappy memories are there of you  
When I close my eyes I see  
An image of your love forever true  
But not forever for me  
  
I dont think Ill ever have the answer  
I have no answer to give at all  
Within these walls of without you  
I sit crying but the tears will not fall
