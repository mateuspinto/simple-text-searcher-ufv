I just had to show em I didnt need em and so I headed out west to see some
old friends of mine  
I thought if Id climb up ole Ajax mountain maybe that would help me get it
all off my mind  
I made it up to the top picked out a clear spot I thought a whole lot about
the rest of my life  
I had no idea then soon it would nearly end up on this mountainside I would
nearly die  
and there all in Alabama and there all in dixieland  
God Im dying here in Montana please Lord just want to go back to hold her
hand just let me get back to my old homeland  
They said Id never sing again I learned a lot about my friends cause when
your shot down and out you dont get many calls  
but I saw some tears in some eyes and soon my poor old mother would die I
nearly lost it all when I lost my Grandpa  
But you could find us all in Alabama yeah were all down in Dixieland  
I didnt die out in Montana No Lord you let me get back to my own homeland and
Im gonna hold on to her hand  
I done a whole searching a whole lot of hurtin before I finally found my road
in life  
you got to say things you want to say go on and do things your own way you can
climb any old mountain once you make up your mind  
and I made mine in Alabama and I found mine down in Dixieland  
I didnt die out in Montana no Lord you let me get back to my ole homeland and
Im gonna hold on to her hand
