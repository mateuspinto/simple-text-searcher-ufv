Stay with me  
My love I hope youll always be  
Right here by my side if ever I needed you  
Oh my love  
  
In your arms  
I feel so safe and so secure  
Everyday is such a perfect day to spend  
Alone with you  
  
I will follow you will you follow me  
All the days and nights that we know will be  
I will stay with you will you stay with me  
Just one single tear in each passing year  
  
With the dark  
I see so very clearly now  
All my fears are drifting by me so slowly now  
Fading away  
  
I can say  
The night is long but you are there  
Close at hand Im better for the smile you give  
And while I live  
  
I will follow you will you follow me  
All the days and nights that we know will be  
I will stay with you will you stay with me  
Just one single tear in each passing year there will be  
  
I will follow you I will follow you
