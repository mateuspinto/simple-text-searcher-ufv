Walked out goodbye  
I swore I never would cry  
Tore a page of my heart  
She wants me to be her friend  
Im lonely again  
Tore a page of my heart  
  
Chorus  
Oh tell me who wrote the book of love  
Was it somebody from above ha ha ha ha ha  
Surely he must know all the rules ha ha ha ha ha  
Knowledge not meant for mortal fools  
Must have been someone from above  
Tell me who wrote the book of love oh oh oh ohwhoa  
In silence the lonely make  
All their mistakes  
Tore a page of my heart  
Someone in heaven above  
Shop me how to love  
Tore a page of my heart  
  
Chorus Repeat 2X
