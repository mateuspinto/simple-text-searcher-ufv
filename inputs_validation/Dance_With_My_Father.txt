Back when I was a child  
Before life removed all the innocence  
My father would lift me high  
And dance with my mother and me  
And then  
Spin me around till I fell asleep  
Then up the stairs he would carry me  
And I knew for sure  
I was loved  
  
If I could get another chance  
Another walk  
Another dance with him  
Id play a song that would never ever end  
How Id love love love  
To dance with my father again  
  
When I and my mother  
Would disagree  
To get my way I would run  
From her to him  
Hed make me laugh just to comfort me  
yeah yeah  
Then finally make me do  
Just what my mama said  
Later that night when I was asleep  
He left a dollar under my sheet  
Never dreamed that he  
Would be gone from me  
  
If I could steal one final glance  
One final step  
One final dance with him  
Id play a song that would never ever end  
Cause Id love love love to  
Dance with my father again  
  
Sometimes Id listen outside her door  
And Id hear how mama would cry for him  
Id pray for her even more than me  
Id pray for her even more than me  
  
I know Im praying for much to much  
But could you send her  
The only man she loved  
I know you dont do it usually  
But Dear Lord  
Shes dying to dance with my father again  
  
Every night I fall asleep  
And this is all I ever dream
