With your love you gave me life  
Not knowing right from wrong  
You always know that Ill be strong  
You set me free and you paid the price  
You inspired me in my art  
With the rebel in your heart  
You gave nothing for nothing  
But the spirit of you word happiness could bring  
I learned to always do the best I can  
You taught me to be true and I never ran  
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child  
Left all alone in the cold  
Nowhere to go so I run like the wild  
Stumbling falling  
Crying calling you  
As they gave nothing in return  
You became their slave although you were brave  
You still teach me what is left to learn  
Though they brought you to the grave  
You will remain to ease my pain
