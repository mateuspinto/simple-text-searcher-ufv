Its a long long way from here  
Dont you worry yourself my dear  
Its a long long way from here  
  
Drought and famine in TV land  
Read the Sunday papers credit card ina your hand  
Sing your song of freedom just to ease your troubled mind  
And save your guilty pennies for the ones you leave behind  
  
The burden that you carry from the cradle to the grave  
Is like a badge of honor that you wear upon your sleeve  
You make your contribution and you shed a little tear  
And stage your celebration just to show how much you care  
  
You obscure your stolen power with hypocrisy and lies  
Your talk of understanding is a wafer thin disguise  
You glorify my image but deny me flesh and blood  
You radiate with goodness when you here me beg for food  
  
Those rivers of blood will flow again  
Someone changed the lyrics but the song remains the same  
You can build a wall of protocol to keep the wolves at bay  
But history dictates that someone has to pay  
  
Its a long long way from here  
Dont you worry yourself my dear  
Its a long long way from here
