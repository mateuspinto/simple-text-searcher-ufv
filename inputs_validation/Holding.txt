Im standing here and hoping for you  
Holding my door open for you now  
Ask just what you will of me  
Ill bend just like a willow tree  
And now Im holdin  
Holdin my door open to the wind  
  
Well seven times she came to me  
And each time seemed the same to me  
She knows just what to ask me now  
And I cant help but wonder how  
And now Im holdin  
Holdin my door open before the wind  
  
I wrote my name upon the sands  
With questioningly weary hands  
The tide arose and answered me  
And washed my name into the sea  
And now Im holdin  
Holdin my door open before the wind
