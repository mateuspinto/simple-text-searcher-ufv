There comes a time  
In every mans life  
Where hes got to face  
The truth no matter what  
We are coming to you Father  
With our sins and everything  
To thank you  
Those that smoke marijuana  
Wanna thank you Father  
For making it grow internationally  
They wanna thank you Lord  
Even though police cut it down  
Sometimes they burn it down  
But it grows again  
Thank you Father  
We wanna thank you father  
For everything youve given us  
Nations that oppress other nations  
Wanna thank you Father  
Even though its painful to be oppressed  
But they thank you for making them strong  
Politicians thank you Father  
For making them to be able  
To lie with a straight face  
While the nation cries  
They wanna thank you Lord  
We wanna thank you Father  
For everything youve given us  
We wanna thank you Father  
For everything youve given us  
We wanna thank you Father  
For everything youve given us
