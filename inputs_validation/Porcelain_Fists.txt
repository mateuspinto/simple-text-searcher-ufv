Follow your heart he said  
Your heart will take you there  
Swallow your pride he said  
For pride is anything but rare  
So I walked into your eyes  
Without a raincoat on  
And in the salty sea  
I find youre all but gone  
Take my hand youre treading water  
And I feel sand slipping away  
From underneath our toes  
Nobody knows where is it she goes  
Looked in the bathroom stall  
Your back against the wall  
Cold tiles beneath your knees  
Your body broke your fall  
Spitting into your own  
Reflection gazing back  
Inside your porcelain fists  
Your palms begin to crack  
So take my hand youre treading water  
And I feel sand slipping  
From underneath our toes  
Nobody knows where is it she goes  
When those sad eyes start to close  
Nobody knows where is it she goes  
When those sad eyes close
