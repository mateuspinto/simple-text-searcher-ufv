To the world around he was the perfect person  
Planning for an alibi he then starts rehearsing  
A human bomb just waiting to explode  
This secret rage cant be controlled  
  
Slaughtered the dreams of others  
On left to recover  
Selfinflicted wounds  
Life he has comsumed  
  
Planning a killing spree  
Victim of a conspiracy  
  
Getting bored with his current life  
Rearranging with a knife  
  
Greed before despair suspicion starts to grow  
His life was spared for this he does not know  
Screams filled the air there was no way to help  
The ones he mourns he killed himself  
  
Slaughtered the dreams of others  
On left to recover  
Selfinflicted wounds  
Life he has comsumed  
  
Planning a killing spree  
Victim of a conspiracy
