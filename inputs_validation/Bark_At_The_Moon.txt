Screams break the silence  
Waking from the dead of night  
Vengeance is boiling  
Hes returned to kill the light  
Then when hes found who hes looking for  
Listen in awe and youll hear him  
  
Bark at the moon  
  
Years spent in torment  
Buried in a nameless grave  
Now he has risen  
Miracles would have to save  
Those that the beast is looking for  
Listen in awe and youll hear him  
  
Bark at the moon  
  
They cursed and buried him  
Along with shame  
And thought his timeless soul had gone  
In empty burning Hellunholy one  
But now hes returned to prove them wrong  
  
Howling in shadows  
Living in a lunar spell  
He finds his heaven  
Spewing from the mouth of hell  
  
And when he finds who hes looking for  
Listen in awe and youll hear him  
Bark at the moon
