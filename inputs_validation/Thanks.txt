We used to dwell in loves own palace  
A palace of dreams come true  
Now that were through I bear no malice  
Though weve called it a day  
All I can say is  
Thanks for all the lovely delights  
I found in your embrace  
Im thankful though I know  
Its ending all too soon  
And thanks for unforgettable nights  
I never can replace  
And memories that linger like a haunting tune  
It is better to have loved you dear and lost  
Than never to have loved at all  
Yes its better for no matter what the cost  
I held the world in sway an emperor for a day  
And thanks again for taking me on the road to paradise  
We lost our road but still I must convey our thanks  
  
It is better to have loved you dear and lost  
Than never to have loved at all  
Yes its better for no matter what the cost  
I held the world in sway an emperor for a day  
And thanks again for taking me on the road to paradise  
We lost our way but still I must convey my thanks
