Ice Machine  
Running through my head secretly  
The shout of the boys in the factory  
Ill ring you on the telephone silently  
Like blood like wine in the darkroom scene  
Darkroom scene  
  
A letter once composed  
Seven years long  
And as tall as a tree  
Written on the wall efficient  
Efficiency  
  
Resurrect as a feeling on my window  
Of a past reunion  
Resurrect as a feeling on my window  
Of a past reunion  
Mission of a picture like the city and the air we breathe  
The air we breathe  
Air we breathe  
  
She stood beside me once again  
I knew her face  
We met before in the street  
Recalling all the children dancing at our feet  
Their dancing feet  
Dancing feet
