So rotten ah oh

Thought that I could leave it for one more week  
Then I Im takin birthday cake oh and chile and greasy old bacon  
Throw in all on top of the mess Ive been makin

Shes naggin I need you to get that stuff of the kitchen floor oh

Look at all this garbage that I keep generatin come on  
I sit around all day and watch it biodegrating  
Bet theres a hundred house codes that Im violatin

You wont believe it take a whiff of that aroma  
Sure to put you in a coma  
Its so messy cant find my toenail clippers  
Its so bad the roaches wearin slippers  
Worn sweatly clothes pile up in this joint  
Stand up by themselves at this point  
Its so filthy now baby I cant lie

I wonder what crawled in here and died  
Ya know walkin around barefoot actin terrified  
But it gives me stuff to talk about with my friends like
