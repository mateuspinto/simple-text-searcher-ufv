Come wet a widows eye  
Cover the night with your love  
Dry the rain from my beaten face  
Drink the wine the red sweet taste of mine  
  
Come cover me with you  
For the thrill  
Till you will take me in  
Come comfort me in you  
Young love must  
Live twice only for us  
  
For me  
For you  
Time devours passions beauty  
With me  
With you  
In war for the love of you  
  
For me  
For you  
Time devours passions beauty  
With me  
With you  
Tonight any dream will do  
  
Not a world but your fine grace  
Seduction in sleepwalkers land  
November dressed in May on your face  
Holding us now the lovecroppers hand  
  
Come cover me with you  
Come cover  
Come cover me now  
  
Come cover me with you  
For the thrill  
Till you will take me in  
Come comfort me in you  
Young love must  
Live twice only for us  
  
Come cover me with you  
Come cover  
Come cover me now
