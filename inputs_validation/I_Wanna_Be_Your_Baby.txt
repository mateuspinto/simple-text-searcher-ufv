Open yourself let me inside  
Open your arms  
I have nowhere to go  
So let me into you  
I need to be where nothing can hurt me  
Open your legs  
To let me crawl  
Inside of you  
I need to be inside your womb  
So take me home  
Inside of you  
Envelope me Im home  
  
Bringing me down  
Bringing me down  
I want to be your baby  
Bringing me down  
Bringing me down  
Bringing me down  
I want to be your baby  
Bringing me down  
  
Open your legs  
And take me in  
I need to be inside within  
Let me become a part of you  
Let me inside of you  
Swallow me whole  
I want to know the things you hide  
I want to feel the things you feel  
I want to breath the air you breath  
I want to live inside of you  
  
Take me  
Bringing me down  
Bringing me down  
I want to be your baby  
Bringing me down  
Bringing me down  
Bringing me down  
I want to be your baby  
Bringing me down  
Let me live inside  
Let me live inside  
Let me live inside  
Let me live inside
