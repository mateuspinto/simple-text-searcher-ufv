Every day along about evening  
When the sunlights beginning to pale  
I ride through the slumbering shadows  
Along the Navajo trail  
  
When its night and crickets are callin  
And coyotes are makin a wail  
I dream by a smoldering fire  
Along the Navajo trail  
  
I love to lie and listen to the music  
When the wind is strummin a sagebrush guitar  
When over yonder hill the moon is climbin  
It always finds me wishin on a star  
  
Well whatta ya know its mornin already  
Theres the dawnin so silver and pale  
Its time to climb into my saddle  
And ride the Navajo trail  
  
I love to lie and listen to the music  
When the wind is strummin a sagebrush guitar  
When over yonder hill the moon is climbin  
It always finds me wishin on a star  
  
Well whatta ya know its mornin already  
Theres the dawnin so silver and pale  
Like a silvery veil  
Its time to climb into my saddle  
And ride the Navajo trail  
  
Ride the Navajo trail  
Ride the Navajo trail
