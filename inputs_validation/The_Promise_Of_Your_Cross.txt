Forever in my heart  
And written on my soul  
The promise of Your cross  
I have no other claim  
I have no other plea  
The promise of Your cross  
The hope for every heart  
  
Where mercy ever flows  
And shames no longer known  
Ill praise You for the cross  
The promise of Your cross to me  
It never fails to bring  
The cleansing that I need  
Ill praise You for the cross  
The promise of Your cross to me  
  
Embedded in my heart  
And rooted in my soul  
The promise of Your cross  
It seals me as Your own  
And tells me I am Yours  
The promise of your cross  
The hope for every heart  
  
Tell it in all the earth  
Sing it throughout the world  
The promise of the cross  
There is a higher way  
There is a higher hope  
The promise of Your cross  
The hope for every heart
