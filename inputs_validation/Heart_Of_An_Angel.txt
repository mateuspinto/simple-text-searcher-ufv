Shes crying a river she helps everyone  
There is so much sorrow she has to be strong  
She needs all her power for helping the poor  
Showing heaven to you  
Theres something to live for oh what makes you glad  
Oh she cant see it if people are sad  
A new star in heaven she helps everyday  
Hope she lives forever and a day  
  
She has a heart heart of an angel  
She has a heart heart of gold  
It is more and more than a lonely heart can hold  
She has a heart heart of an angel  
She lives thousand lives in one  
She is the queen of hearts for her I sing this song  
  
Heart of an angel  
She gives everything she helps everyone  
Sometimes its easier oh said than done  
She wears love like heaven and she knows no fear  
She lives between a laugh and a tear  
  
She has a heart heart of an angel  
She has a heart heart of gold  
It is more and more than a lonely heart can hold  
She has a heart heart of an angel  
She lives thousand lives in one  
She is the queen of heart for her I sing this song for her I sing this song  
  
She has a heart heart of an angel heart of an angel  
She has a heart heart of gold  
It is more and more than a lonely heart can hold oh  
She has a heart heart of an angel heart of an angel  
She lives thousand lives in one one  
She is the queen of heart for her I sing this song for her I sing this song  
  
One heart of gold  
Heart of angel  
Heart of angel
