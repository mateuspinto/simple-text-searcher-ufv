Im roamin Wyomin  
Dreamin of your chestnut hair  
And eyes of sparklin blue  
So I keep roamin Wyomin  
And hopin that my roamin  
Leads me home to you  
  
I left Aberdeen  
On a cattle drive last spring  
I was just another hand  
Ridin through the old bad lands  
There was dust and there was mud  
There was sweat and there was blood  
But after all this time  
You still prey upon my mind  
  
Im roamin Wyomin  
Dreamin of your chestnut hair  
And eyes of sparklin blue  
So I keep roamin Wyomin  
And hopin that my roamin  
Leads me home to you  
  
Sleepin on an old bed roll  
Eatin beans and sourdough  
The days are lonely and theyre long  
Im wonderin why I hired on  
We round em up and move em out  
As I point my saddle south  
This big Wyomin sky  
Sure is blue and so am I  
  
I keep roamin Wyomin  
Dreamin of your chestnut hair  
And eyes of sparklin blue  
So I keep roamin Wyomin  
And hopin that my roamin  
Leads me home to you  
  
I keep roamin Wyomin  
And hopin that my roamin  
Leads me home to you
