You know that  
I love you  
You know that  
I want to know you so much more  
More than I have before  
  
These words are  
From my heart  
These words are  
Not made up  
I will live for you  
I am devoted to you  
  
King of Majesty  
I have one desire  
Just to be with you my Lord  
Just to be with you my Lord  
  
Jesus you are the Saviour of my soul  
And forever and ever Ill give my praises to you  
Jesus you are the Saviour of my soul  
And forever and ever Ill give my praises to you  
  
Jesus you are the Saviour of my soul  
And forever and ever Ill give my praises to you
