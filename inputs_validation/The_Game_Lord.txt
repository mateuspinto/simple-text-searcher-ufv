Ice Cube  
I love chrome and paint lookin for some motherfuckin corners to bank  
West coast what the fuck you thank  
Everybody here off weed and drank everybody  
Before you check my rims  
When you leave the parking lot check ya limbs  
You better check ya friends  
And see if ya baby momma left with them  
Blacks and Mexicans stop all that bullshit in the pen  
Understand that is us verse them  
They can give a fuck if we sink or swim  
They give us guns and drugs  
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs  
I got to show my ass  
To thank these motherfuckers for my past  
In South Central Los Angeles Grandmama smoke cannabis  
Granddaughter wanna dance and shit her own momma cant stand the bitch  
  
Chorus x2  
If you fuckin up pray to the game lord  
Wanna bust a nut Pray to the game lord  
Nigga get ya cup pray to the game lord  
You can throw it up pray to the game lord  
  
Ice Cube  
I love where I from hungry ass niggas better get you some  
Smart ass niggas play dumb  
Yall cant fuck with the city I run  
If I snap my fingers better curl up just like a fetus  
I hope you know Jesus  
Because if you dont boy you will see us  
Where Up in your house two double barrels up in your mouth  
You got some explainin to do  
And dont get the line cause we aiming at you  
Ewww Its a doggy dog world baby you a nut and Ima squirrel baby  
Can I get ya in my world baby  
Can ya grease my Jerry curl baby  
Did you flip yo wig  
To let Michael Jackson baby sit yo kids  
That nigga old as hell  
They need to throw the motherfuckin momma in jail  
Let em know  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Repeat x2  
Fuck wit this if you want to the game lord will punish you  
Punish us if we aint true to the game like we pose to  
  
Ice Cube  
Im the game lord yall come now  
Casanova niggas got the sun down  
Run down every hoe that wanna go shoppin  
Get they kids take em to the mall buy em somethin  
Are you a gentleman  
Big bear wit a nigga named Gentle Ben  
Ladies hell be yo friend  
Wait for the cable guy even let him in  
Not me I wont flex or bend  
Just cause a hoe promise me some trim  
You better get wit the rest of them  
Cause cant none of yall even fuck wit Kim  
Some niggas was born wit hoe in em  
I was put on this Earth to spit ism  
And I shall return like its written  
And slay all the suckers who be sippin
