chorus  
The leaves were down  
Long before the autumn winds arrived  
The leaves were down  
Long before the autumn winds arrived  
  
Why didnt you hear me  
All the times I told you that love was gone  
No you never heard me  
Cause I know there was too much on your mind  
  
refrain  
Runnin around in a circle tryin to catch up to myself  
Runnin out of time  
Losin myself in the darkness every time I played my hand  
I was losin every time  
I knew Id given all that I could give  
Thats why it had to end this way this way  
  
repeat chorus  
  
I know that I hurt you  
At a time you needed me there  
Yes you did yes I know yes I know  
But my heart had been broken  
And my mind was no longer there  
I had to go yes I did  
  
repeat refrain  
  
The leaves were down  
Long before the autumn winds arrived  
Long before the autumn winds arrived  
The leaves were down  
Before the summer sun had gone  
Long before the autumn winds arrived  
Im sorry that it had to be this way  
  
Love was gone  
  
repeat chorus
