Kisses dont  
No they dont  
Never dont lie  
You can run if you want but you cant hide  
Tellin you its the truth dont you ask why  
Kisses dont  
No they dont  
Kisses dont lie  
  
Emotions come and go  
Almost how the wind will blow  
There so little in this world to trust in  
Seduce themselves with lies  
Some dont realize  
They call it love but its really only lustin  
  
So you see you and me  
Were gettin close to the danger zone  
Show me how tell me now  
Should I stay or should I go  
Cause Im caught between yes and no  
  
Cause when you kiss me  
I feel everything that I been missing  
I try to slow down but my heart wont listen  
And its tearin me all up inside  
And when you touch me  
I feel a rush but Im afraid that it might crush me  
Should I put my trust in somethin I dont trust in  
I try to run but theres no place to hide  
Cause baby kisses dont lie  
  
Kisses dont  
No they dont  
Never dont lie  
You can run if you want but you cant hide  
Tellin you its the truth dont you ask why  
Kisses dont  
No they dont  
Kisses dont lie  
  
You whisper in my ear  
But are your words sincere  
Cause pretty words can cut just like a knife  
You see Im nobodys fool  
I play by my own rules  
So please think twice before you step into my life  
  
So you see you and me  
Were gettin close to the danger zone  
Show me how tell me now  
Should I stay or should I go  
Cause Im caught between yes and no  
  
Cause when you kiss me  
I feel everything that I been missing  
I try to slow down but my heart wont listen  
And its tearin me all up inside  
And when you touch me  
I feel a rush but Im afraid that it might crush me  
Should I put my trust in somethin I dont trust in  
I try to run but theres no place to hide  
Cause baby kisses dont lie
