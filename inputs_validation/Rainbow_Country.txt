Hey Mr Music sure sound good to me  
I cant refuse it wadda be gadda be  
Feel like dancin dance cause we are free  
  
I got my own in the promise land  
But I feel at home do you understand  
Na na na naa na  
  
Though the road is rocky  
It sure feels good to me  
And if your lucky  
Together well always be  
  
Ill be ridin  
Sun is a risin  
Jah is a risin  
  
Rainbow Country rainbow country
