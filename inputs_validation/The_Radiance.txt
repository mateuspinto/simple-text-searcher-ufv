We knew the world would not be the same  
A few people laughed a few people cried most people were silent  
I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture the BhagavadGita  
Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty  
And to impress him takes on his multiarmed form and says  
Now I am become Death the destroyer of worlds  
I suppose we all thought that one way or another
