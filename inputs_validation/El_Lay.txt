LA Sunset Boulevard Pacific Highway  
Out to the walk of stars now you in Cali  
Dont go less you go hard  
Go less you go hard  
  
Hollywood downtime and back  
Life is always good

You knew that it never would  
Knew that it never would  
  
Lakers Dodgers Ducks Kings Angels Clippers  
Real set trippers clarify ride we bonafide dippers  
ESPN you know Sports Centre  
Spooned and groomed dipped and wet  
Home of the NBA championship  
Purple and gold homie let the story be told  
Its the city where you shoot your favorite television episode  
And you can hit the strip Sunset Boulevard  
But you gotta have a lowrider car  
With the skirts dragging with the plaque in the back flaggin  
Or put it in the back of the Chevy Wagon

Rollin down Fairfax  
Just left the Nico bust a left turn on Pico  
Gotta see the Bishop he got me some gator shoes  
Im rollin to Hollywood Im doing the house of blues  
About 9 oclock stop by the record shop  
And get that new Snoop Dogg now we bouncing ball  
Life is a mystery my life is like history  
Stop by my dispensary give me some kush and pusha  
Put it in the trunk smelling like a skunk  
But its all legal in LA everybody taking a hit  
From the politicians athletes and even the teachers
