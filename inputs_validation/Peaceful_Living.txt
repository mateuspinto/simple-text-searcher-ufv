Have you been to the very top of the highest hill  
Where the air is fresh and sweet and the sky is so clear  
Looking out on the country side and the view of the villages so far away  
There is nothing to feel nothing to feel  
Come with me wont you take my hand  
Lets explore this heaven right here on earth peaceful living is here  
Me and you on this mountaintop with our love we will never stop  
cause we both know peaceful living is right here  
And here we are in utopia where the sun never seems to go away  
And the moon is our friend hmm  
Looking out on a starry night and the sky is like a sleigh for riding on  
But you dont need a pin you dont need a pin  
Precious one youre a joy to me  
And I know that theres no place else Id rather be  
Peaceful living is here yeah yeah  
Me and you on this mountain top with our love well never stop  
And we both know peaceful living is right right hoo  
And the moon is our friend me and you yeah yeah yeah  
Precious one youre a joy to me  
And I know that theres no place else Id rather be  
Peaceful is living here oh me and you on this mountaintop  
With our love well never stop cause we both know peaceful living is here  
We both know peaceful living is here  
We both know peaceful living is right here  
La la peaceful living la la peaceful living living living
