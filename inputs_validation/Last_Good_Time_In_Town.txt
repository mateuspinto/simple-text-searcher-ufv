I like to go out every now and then  
I cant wait to do it again  
But I havent had the time  
Lately  
  
I like to step out every once in a while  
I kind of like to do it in style  
I havent had the time  
Lately  
  
Lately Ive been stayin at home  
Stayin at home stayin at home  
Workin the crosswords turn off the phone  
Turn off the phone turn off the phone  
  
And I dream Im on vacation  
Cause I like the way that sounds  
Its a perfect occupation  
For me  
I dont mind being by myself  
If theres no one else around  
Its the last good time in town  
  
Well I could stand up straight get a real job  
Stay up late with the same old mob  
But it hasnt crossed my mind  
Lately  
  
Put on a suit work downtown  
Then come up when the sun goes down  
No I havent had the time  
Lately  
  
Lately Ive been stayin at home  
Stayin at home stayin at home  
Closin the curtains play jazz on trombone  
Jazz on trombone jazz on trombone  
  
And I dream Im on vacation  
No you wont see me around  
Its a perfect situation  
For me  
I dont mind being by myself  
Cause I know youll come on down  
Its the last good time in town  
  
Lately Ive been stayin at home  
Stayin at home stayin at home  
Workin the crosswords turn off the phone  
Turn off the phone turn off the phone  
  
And I dream Im on vacation  
Cause I like the way that sounds  
Its a perfect occupation  
For me yes it is  
I dont mind being by myself  
If you dont see me around  
Its the last good time last good time in town
