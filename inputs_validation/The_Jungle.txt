Well just follow your heart  
Man oh man  
Try and see if you can  
Ha Ha  
  
Jungle sounds great  
Lots of scary noise  
Dont deter us from our journey onward  
  
Hey man let your spirit go  
To the full extent of the meaning  
  
He said And follow me to the deepest part of the jungle  
Where it is always dark and wet and warm  
To the sacred part  
  
Well just follow your heart  
Man oh man  
Try and see if you can  
Ha Ha  
  
Jungle sounds great  
Lots of scary noises  
Dont deter us from our journey onward  
  
We pushed and followed  
Only our deepest hidden senses senses  
And exposed to the elements  
That lie within
