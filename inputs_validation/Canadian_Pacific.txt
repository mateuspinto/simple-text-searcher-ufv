I rode your ocean liner to Newfoundland  
Where I made a living in an iron mine  
When I got my fill I went to Nova Scotia  
And I fished the salty waters for a time  
  
Passing through Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick  
I could see the rocks and cliffs of solid stone  
Listening to the seagulls calling to each other  
Made me miss my darling and my distant home  
  
Canadian Pacific carry me three thousand miles  
Through the valleys and the forests  
To the sunshine of her smile  
Cross the plains and the rugged mountains  
Keep this wandering boy from harm  
Canadian Pacific take me to my babys arms  
  
The Atlantic disappeared on the horizon  
And Quebec lay waiting for me down the track  
For a while I drove a truck to keep from starving  
In Ontario I was a lumberjack  
  
Manitoba and Saskatchewan then followed  
Where the wheat fields and the old Red River flowed  
In the quiet hours your whistling on the prairie  
Touched my heart and set my memories aglow  
  
I could feel the nearness of her warm sweet kisses  
When you rolled into Alberta westward bound  
I worked on an oil rig to make some money  
For a ticket to the sweetest girl around  
  
Pushing on past Lake Louise in all its splendor  
Where the trees and Rockies touch the sky above  
I got to British Columbia and heaven  
On your track I made it back to my true love  
  
Canadian Pacific carry me three thousand miles  
Through the valleys and the forests  
To the sunshine of her smile  
Cross the plains and the rugged mountains  
Keep this wandering boy from harm  
Canadian Pacific take me to my babys arms
