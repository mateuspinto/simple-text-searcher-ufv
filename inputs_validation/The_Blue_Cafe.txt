My world is miles of endless roads  
That leaves a trail of broken dreams  
Where have you been  
I hear you say  
  
I will meet you at the Blue Cafe  
Because this is where the one who knows  
Meets the one who does not care  
The cards of fate  
  
The older shows  
To the younger one who dares to take  
The chance of no return  
  
Where have you been  
Where are you going to  
I want to know what is new  
I want to go with you  
  
What have you seen  
What do you know that is new  
Where are you going to  
Because I want to go with you  
  
So meet me down at the Blue Cafe  
  
The cost is great the price is high  
Take all you know and say goodbye  
Your innocence inexperience  
Mean nothing now  
  
Because this is where the one who knows  
Meets the one that does not care  
Where have you been  
I hear you say  
Ill meet you at the Blue Cafe  
  
So meet me at the Blue Cafe
