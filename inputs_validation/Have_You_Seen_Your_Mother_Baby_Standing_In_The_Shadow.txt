Have you seen your mother baby standing in the shadow  
Have you had another baby standing in the shadow  
Im glad I opened your eyes  
The havenots would have tried to freeze you in ice  
  
Have you seen your brother baby standing in the shadow  
Have you had another baby standing in the shadow  
Well I was just passing the time  
Im all alone wont you give all your sympathy to mine  
  
Tell me a story about how you adore me  
Live through the shadow see through the shadow  
Live through the shadow tear at the shadow  
Hate in the shadow love in the shadow life  
  
Have you seen your lover baby standing in the shadow  
Have they had another baby standing in the shadow  
Where have you been all your life  
Talking about all the people who would try anything twice  
  
Have you seen your mother baby standing in the shadow  
Has she had another baby standing in the shadow  
You take your choice at this time  
The brave old world or the slide to the depths of decline
