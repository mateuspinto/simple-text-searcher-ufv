When He Calls  
Words and music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
In a land far away  
A little boy lay  
Asleep in his bed  
Then he heard a voice call  
There was no doubt at all  
He knew just what it said  
He had heard it before  
And he could not ignore  
What he thought  
Was too good to be true  
For the words of a wise man  
Had opened his eyes  
And he knew what he needed to do  
chorus  
When He calls  
When He calls  
Just say Lord I am listening  
When He calls  
When He calls  
Just be ready to obey  
For theres no greater joy  
Than hearing Him call your name  
Well the little boys gone  
But life still goes on  
Day after day  
And if God spoke back then  
He can do it again  
In a nuclear age  
Have you heard it before  
And just chose to ignore  
What your mind thought  
Was only a dream  
If Hes speaking to you  
This is what you should do  
And its not quite  
As strange as it seems  
chorus repeat
