I thought about calling you when I got off the plane  
Every time I see this city through the clouds I get that way  
Call me crazy for missing you like this but I do  
By now I figured you had all your numbers changed  
  
Its been at least a year since I called you up to say  
We need to talk I got this job and I think Im going to take it  
Cause I been waiting all my life  
For a break like this  
  
Its my chance of a lifetime I just know it is  
I gotta go find these dreams  
Was the last thing that I said  
And then I did  
  
I can see clear to the mountains as I head up our old street  
I remember how wed call in sick on days like these  
And turn the music up roll the windows down and just drive  
You talked me outta givin up on myself so many times  
Convinced me to get in while I could regrets hang heavy on the mind  
But you never doubted me you kept pushing me  
  
Saying youve been waiting all your life for a break like this  
Its your chance of a lifetime you just know it is  
You gotta go find those dreams  
Was the last thing that you said  
And then I did  
  
But you were wrong  
Love was what I wanted all along  
And now youre gone  
  
I thought about calling you when I got off the plane  
Every time I see this city through the clouds I get that way  
  
But you were wrong  
Love was what I wanted all along
