Lord my heart cries out glory to the King  
My greatest love in life I hand You everything  
Glory glory I hear the angels sing  
  
Open my ears let me hear Your voice  
To know that sweet sound  
Oh my soul rejoice  
Glory glory I hear the angels sing  
  
Chorus  
Youre a Father to the fatherless  
The answer to my dreams  
I see you crowned in righteousness  
We cry glory to the King  
Comforter to the lonely  
The lifter of my head  
I see You veiled in majesty  
We cry glory glory  
We cry glory to the King  
We cry glory glory  
We cry glory to the King
