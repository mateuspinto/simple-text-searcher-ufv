Dont mind the rain drops  
Wait till the rain stops  
Smile through your tears laughing at life  
No road is lonely if you will only  
Lose all your blues laughing at life  
Live for tomorrow be happy today  
Laugh all your sorrows away  
Start now and cheer up  
The skies will clear up  
Lose all your blues laughing at life  
  
Dont mind the rain drops  
Wait till the rain stops  
Youll find the sun laughing at life  
No road is lonely if you will only  
Smile through your tears laugh at life  
Live for tomorrow be happy today  
Laugh all your sorrows away  
Start now and cheer up  
The skies will clear up  
Lose all your blues laughing at life
