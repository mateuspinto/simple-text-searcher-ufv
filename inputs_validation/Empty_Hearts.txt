Are you leaving are you going  
Did you think you could lose that feeling  
Without me knowing  
Are you wishing youd never met me  
Does it take some train whistle blowing  
To forget me  
  
All the losing  
And the knowing that you love her still  
Could be nothing to what empty hearts must feel  
Tell me what an empty heart must feel  
  
Are you leaving are you going  
Did you think you could lose that feeling  
Without me knowing  
All the losing  
And the knowing that you love her still  
Could be nothing to what empty hearts must feel  
Tell me what an empty heart must feel
