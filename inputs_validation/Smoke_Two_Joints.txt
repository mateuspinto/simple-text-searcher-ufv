I smoke two joints in the morning  
I smoke two joint at night  
I smoke two joint in the afternoon  
It makes me feel all right  
  
I smoke two joints in time of peace  
And two in time of war  
I smoke two joints before I smoke two joints  
And then I smoke two more  
  
Daddy he once told me  
Son you be hard workin man  
And momma she once told me  
Son you do the best you can  
Then one day I met a man  
He came to me and said  
Hard work good and hard work fine  
But first take care of head  
  
Whoa rock me to the night  
Jah say
