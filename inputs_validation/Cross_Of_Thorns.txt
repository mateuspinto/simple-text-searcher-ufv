Dont come closer cos it aint safe here  
Just turn around now and walk away  
Ive gotta tell you there are no rules here  
Sometimes I wonder what goes on there  
Behind those eyes  
  
When a promise is broken and no one trusts you  
Young ones crying with there heads in their hands  
When you talk about saving the souls of the faithful  
You cant help thinking youve got blood on your  
Hands  
From a cross of thorns  
  
Tongues of fire always talking wasted words that  
Ring in my ears  
Were still waiting losing patience Will all the lies  
Of 400 years  
Ive got to tell you there are no rules here  
Sometimes I wonder  
What goes on there behind those eyes  
  
When a promise is broken and no one trusts you  
Young ones crying with there heads in their hands  
When you talk about saving the souls of the faithful  
You cant help thinking youve got blood on your  
Hands  
From a cross of thorns  
  
We gave you yesterdays and now you want today  
Oh from the hands of death we take our daily bread  
Now all we do is choke and the words that you once  
Spoke fade away  
Look at what youve done oh its a cross of thorns  
  
Take away this cross of thorns look at what youve  
Done  
Its a cross of thorns cross of thorns  
When a promise is broken and no one trusts you  
Youve got blood on your hands from a cross of  
Thorns
