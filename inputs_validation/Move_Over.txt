Ill tell you something man  
I never expected that out of Toronto man  
Youre looking real good real good  
In fact youre all invited to my house for a drink  
I live in San Francisco and if you can get there man  
Ill give you the drink  
I promise  
I aint too hard to find ha ha ha ha ha  
Im all over the streets man  
Ha Ha Im not  
  
A while back it was about a year ago  
I think it was I had this apartment in San Francisco  
I lived on the third floor in this little tiny apartment building  
Had a little two rooms and a dog right  
  
I lived on the third floor and I used to walk around town and I had  
You know a couple of pairs of Levis and a couple Tshirts  
And I thought I had my shit pretty good together man  
  
You know I was out on the streets talking and talking  
Doing all that shit and every time I found a nice piece of talent  
He went right straight downstairs to the chick on the second floor  
There was another chick on the second floor right  
  
And I couldnt understand I couldnt understand  
I kept thinking Janis why are you doing wrong suddenly   
Well I so decided to get up one morning ha ha ha  
And check out the chicks action right  
Figure out what she had going that I didnt have going  
  
I got up at 930 in the morning  
Which I want you to know is an effort on my part  
And I got up at 930 in the morning  
I hid in the stairwell right next  
To the chicks across from her apartment right  
And I watched her and watched to see what she had man  
That I didnt have  
  
And Ill tell you what she had man  
That chick hit the streets at noon  
I mean I didnt use to get up till three  
That chick was already in the street hustling man  
So I figured out what you gotta do man  
Every time youre looking for a little piece of action  
And you aint getting none man  
You know what you better do baby  
You better try harder man
