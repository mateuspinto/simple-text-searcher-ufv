When the rain came I thought youd leave  
Cause I knew how much you loved the sun  
But you chose to stay stay and keep me warm  
through the darkest nights Ive ever known  
If the mandolin wind couldnt change a thing  
then I know I love ya  
  
Oh the snow fell without a break  
Buffalo died in the frozen fields you know  
Through the coldest winter in almost fourteen years  
I couldnt believe you kept a smile  
Now I can rest assured knowing that weve seen the worst  
And I know I love ya  
  
Oh I never was good with romantic words  
So the next few lines come really hard  
Dont have much but what Ive got is yours  
Except of course my steel guitar  
Ha cause I know you dont play  
But Ill teach you one day  
Because I love ya  
  
I recall the night we knelt and prayed  
Noticing your face was thin and pale  
I found it hard to hide my tears  
I felt ashamed I felt Id let you down  
No mandolin wind couldnt change a thing  
Couldnt change a thing no no  
  
The coldest winter in almost fourteen years  
Could never never change your mind  
  
And I love ya  
Yes indeed and I love ya  
And I love ya  
Lord I love ya
