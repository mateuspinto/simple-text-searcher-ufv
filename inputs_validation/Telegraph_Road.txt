A long time ago came a man on a track  
Walking thirty miles with a sack on his back  
And he put down his load where he thought it was the best  
He made a home in the wilderness  
He built a cabin and a winter store  
And he plowed up the ground by the cold lake shore  
And the other travelers came walking down the track  
And they never went further and they never went back  
Then came the churches then came the schools  
Then came the lawyers and then came the rules  
Then came the trains and the trucks with their loads  
And the dirty old track was the telegraph road  
  
Then came the mines then came the ore  
Then there was the hard times then there was a war  
Telegraph sang a song about the world outside  
Telegraph road got so deep and so wide  
Like a rolling river  
  
And my radio says tonight its gonna freeze  
People driving home from the factories  
Theres six lanes of traffic  
Three lanes moving slow  
  
I used to like to go to work but they shut it down  
Ive got a right to go to work but theres no work here to be found  
Yes and they say were gonna have to pay whats owed  
Were gonna have to reap from some seed thats been sowed  
And the birds up on the wires and the telegraph poles  
They can always fly away from this rain and this cold  
You can hear them singing out their telegraph code  
All the way down the telegraph road  
  
You know Id sooner forget but I remember those nights  
When life was just a bet on a race between the lights  
You had your head on my shoulder you had your hand in my hair  
Now you act a little colder like you dont seem to care  
But believe in me baby and Ill take you away  
From out of this darkness and into the day  
From these rivers of headlights these rivers of rain  
From the anger that lives on the streets with these names  
Cause Ive run every red light on memory lane  
Ive seen desperation explode into flames  
And I dont want to see it again  
  
From all of these signs saying sorry but were closed  
All the way  
Down the telegraph road
