Love comes to you and you follow  
Lose one on to the heart of the sunrise  
Sharp distance  
How can the wind with its arms  
All around me  
  
Lost on a wave and then after  
Dream on on to the heart of the sunrise  
Sharp distance  
How can the wind with so many around me  
Lost in the city  
  
Lost in their eyes as you hurry by  
Counting the broken ties they decide  
Love comes to you and then after  
Dream on on to the heart of the sunrise  
Lost on a wave that youre dreaming  
Dram on on to the heart of the sunrise  
Sharp distance  
How can the wind with its arms all around  
Me  
Sharp distance  
How can the wind with so many around me  
I feel lost in the city  
  
Lost in their eyes as you hurry by  
Counting the broken ties they decided  
  
Straight light moving and removing  
Sharpness of the colour sun shine  
Straight light searching all the meanings  
Of the song  
Long last treatment of the telling that  
Relates to all the words sung  
Dreamer easy in the chair that really fits  
You  
  
Love comes to you and then after  
Dream on on to the heart of the sunrise  
Sharp distance  
How can the sun with its arms all around  
Me  
Sharp distance  
How can the wind with so many around me  
I feel lost in the city
