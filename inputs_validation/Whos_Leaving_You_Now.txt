You thought youd never hear  
A voice that cracked so clear  
Thought youd never see  
A head that slept for three  
Every dream that thrills you up  
Smells like poison in your cup  
And every dream that thrills you up  
Now smells like poison in your cup  
A drink never meant so much  
You can put it all down to luck  
Sleeps the only friend  
You can grab on til the end  
The now the voice and touch that used to thrill you up  
Tears your lip just like a chip in a cup  
And the feel that made you forget the rest  
Just makes you feel like second best again
