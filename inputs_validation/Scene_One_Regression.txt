Close your eyes and begin to relax Take a deep breath and let it out  
slowly Concentrate on your breathing With each breath you become more  
relaxed Imagine a brilliant white light above you focusing on this light as  
it flows through your body Allow yourself to drift off as you fall deeper and  
deeper into a more relaxed state of mind Now as I count backward from ten to  
one you will fill more peaceful and calm Ten Nine Eight Seven Six You  
will enter a safe place where nothing can harm you Five Four Three Two If  
at any time you need to came back all you must do is open your eyes One

Safe in the light that surrounds me  
Free of the fear and the pain  
My subconscious mind  
Starts spinning through time  
To rejoin the past once again  
  
Nothing seems real  
Im starting to feel  
Lost in the haze of a dream  
  
And as I draw near  
The scene becomes clear  
Like watching my life on a screen  
  
Hello Victoria so glad to see you  
My friend
