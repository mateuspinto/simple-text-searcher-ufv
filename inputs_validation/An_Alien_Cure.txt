So I wandered like Jesus  
Like an alien cure  
Searching for my disciples  
Dispossessed and alone  
So I looked deeper  
Into evil  
And I came closer  
To your corruption  
I took a virgin like Mary  
And said I give you The One  
I confessed to desire  
And watched the world come undone  
So I looked deeper  
Into evil  
And I came closer  
To your obsession  
So I looked deeper  
Into evil  
And I came closer  
To Heaven  
Your Heaven  
So I moved like a rumour  
Like a glorious lie  
And I walked into Heaven  
Into dead paradise
