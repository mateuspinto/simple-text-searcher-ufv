Can you see her little eyes  
Can you see her little hands  
Dont you think she looks just like me  
Can you hear her little scream  
Can you hear her little cry  
Dont you think she sounds just like me  
  
Chorus  
You have friends and we have reasons  
I cant meet you facetoface  
There are no corners to hide in my room  
No doors no windows no fireplace  
  
My love is only for me  
My love needs nobody else  
Did you know that my love is a liquid  
I could talk to me for years  
I cant speak to you at all  
Did you know that friends come in boxes  
  
Chorus  
  
Save your money buy a tube  
Let your body flow inside  
Watch it grow before your eyes  
Watch it grow before your eyes  
  
Chorus
