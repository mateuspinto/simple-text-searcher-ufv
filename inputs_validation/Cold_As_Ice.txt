Youre as cold as ice  
Youre willing to sacrifice our love  
You never take advice  
Someday youll pay the price I know  
  
Ive seen it before  
It happens all the time  
Closing the door  
You leave the world behind  
  
Youre digging for gold  
Yet throwing away  
A fortune in feelings  
But someday youll pay  
  
Youre as cold as ice  
Youre willing to sacrifice our love  
You want paradise  
But someday youll pay the price I know  
  
Ive seen it before  
It happens all the time  
Closing the door  
You leave the world behind  
  
Youre digging for gold  
Yet throwing away  
A fortune in feelings  
But someday youll pay  
  
Cold as ice  
You know that you are  
Cold cold as as ice  
As cold as ice to me  
Cold cold cold as as as ice  
  
Ooh ooh ooh youre as cold as ice  
Youre as cold as icccce  
Youre as cold as ice  
Cold as icccce  
Cold as ice I know  
Youre as cold as icccce  
Youre as cold as ice  
Cold as icccce  
Cold as ice I know  
Youre as cold as icccce  
Oh yes I know  
Cold as icccce  
Youre as cold as icccce  
Youre as cold as ice  
Cold as icccce  
Cold as ice I know  
Youre as cold as icccce  
Oh yes I know  
Cold as icccce
