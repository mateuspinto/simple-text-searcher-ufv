Oh the games people play now  
Every night and every day now  
Never meaning what they say now  
Never saying what they mean  
So they while away the hours  
In their ivory towers  
Till there covered up with flowers  
In the back of a black limousine  
  
Chorus  
Talking bout you and me  
And the games people play  
  
Oh we make one another cry  
Break our heart  
Then we say goodbye  
Cause our heart say  
We hope to die  
Let the other one to blame  
Neither one will ever give in  
So were gazing at an 8 by 10  
Thinking bout the way  
It might have been  
Its a dirty rotten shame  
  
Chorus  
  
People walking up to ya  
Saying glory hallelujah  
And they try to sock it to ya  
In the name of the Lord  
They gonna teach you  
How to meditate  
Read your horoscope  
And cheat your faith  
And furthermore to hell with hate  
Come on and get on board  
  
Chorus  
  
Look around tell me  
What you see  
Whats happening to you and me  
God grant me the serenity  
To remember who I am  
Cause your giving up your sanity  
For your pride and your vanity  
Turn your back on humanity  
And you dont give a damn  
  
Chorus Repeats
