Dont you feel a change a coming  
From another side of time  
Breaking down the walls of silence  
Lifting shadows from your mind  
Placing back the missing mirrors  
That before you couldnt find  
Filling mysteries of emptiness  
That yesterday left behind  
  
And we all know its better  
Yesterday has past  
Now lets all start the living  
For the one thats going to last  
Yes we all know its better  
Yesterday has past  
Now lets all start living  
For the one thats going to last  
  
Dont you feel the day is coming  
That will stay and remain  
When your children see the answers  
That you saw the same  
When the clouds have all gone  
There will be no more rain  
And the beauty of all things  
Is uncovered again  
  
And we all know its better  
Yesterday has past  
Now lets all start the living  
For the one thats going to last  
Yes we all know its better  
Yesterday has past  
Now lets all start living  
For the one thats going to last  
  
Dont you feel the day is coming  
And it wont be too soon  
When the people of the world  
Can all live in one room  
When we shake off the ancient  
Shake off the ancient chains of our tomb  
We will all be born again  
Of the eternal womb  
  
And we all know its better  
Yesterday has past  
Now lets all start the living  
For the one thats going to last  
Yes we all know its better  
Yesterday has past  
Now lets all start living  
For the one thats going to last  
  
Lets all start living  
Lets all start living living living living  
For the one thats going last  
The one thats going to last  
The one thats going to last
