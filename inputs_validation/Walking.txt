I was walking one way  
Was walking the other day  
I was walking I was walking  
I was walking the wrong way  
I was talking one way bla bla bla  
Talking all day  
I was talking I was talking  
I was talking the wrong way  
Chorus  
Try to watch out what you do in life  
Try not to hurt anybody  
Try to watch out what you do in life  
For things they can get pretty muddy  
For things they can get pretty muddy  
I was thinking one way  
Just the other day  
I was thinking I was thinking  
But I was thinking the wrong way  
I was singing one way  
Was singing all day  
I was singing I was singing  
But I was singing the wrong way  
Chorus
