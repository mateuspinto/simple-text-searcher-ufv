Went down last night to take a look around  
Met little Sadie and I blew her down went right home went to bed  
Fortyfour colt smokes under my head  
And I began to think what a deed Id done  
Grabbed my hat and away I run made a good run but a little too slow  
They overtook me in Jericho  
Im standin on the corner ringin the bell  
Along came the sheriff from Thomasville  
Says Young man your names Brown  
Remember the night you blew Sadie down  
Oh yes sir my name is Lee  
I murdered little Sadie in the first degree  
First degree and the second degree  
Got any papers wont you read em to me  
They took me downtown all dressed in black  
Put me on the train and sent me back  
Sent me back to the county jail I had nobody to go for my bail  
The judge and the jury they took the stand  
The judge hold the paper in his right hand  
Fortyone days fortyone nights  
Fortyone years to wear the ball and stripes
