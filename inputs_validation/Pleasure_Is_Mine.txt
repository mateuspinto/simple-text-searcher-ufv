Baby relax weve been waiting for this  
And we deserve the heavenly bliss  
That waits underneath the stars above  
Cant you hear them begging us lets make love  
From the bottom of my heart I give you my soul  
Right here is this room the truth unfolds  
  
Its saying Saying  
Stop playing Playing  
Delaying the divine  
The pleasure is mine let me give some to you  
We can take our time take our time  
Nothing Id rather do oh no  
Make ya feel fine fine  
Make ya life shine shine  
Give you moments you can treasure  
Forever forever remember remember  
The pleasure is mine mine mine all mine  
  
Everyday I been dreaming about  
How its gonna be to find you out  
To be sharing your kiss  
To be just like this  
What I wouldnt do for a taste of your lips  
So lets not waste one second more  
Lets cut the lights and lets lock the door
