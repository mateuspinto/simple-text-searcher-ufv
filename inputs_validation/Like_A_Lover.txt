Like a lover the morning sun slowly rises and kisses you awake  
Your smile is soft and drowsy as you let it play upon your face  
Oh how I dream I might be like the morning sun to you  
  
Like a lover the river wind  
Sighs and ripples its fingers through your hair  
Upon your cheek it lingers never have I known a sweeter place  
Oh how I dream I might be like the river wind to you  
  
Oh how I envy a cup that knows your lips  
Let it be me my love  
And a table that feels your fingertips  
Let it be me let me be your love  
Bring an end to the endless days and nights without you  
  
Like a lover the velvet moon shares your pillow and watches while you sleep  
Its light arrives on tiptoe gently taking you in its embrace  
Oh how I dream I might be like the velvet moon to you  
  
Como um radio de sol Like the sunshine  
A brincar com seui rosto Playing upon your face  
  
Oh how I envy a cup that knows your lips let it be me  
My love and a table that feels your fingertips  
Let it be me let me be your love  
Bring an end to the endless days and nights without you  
  
Like a lover the velvet moon shares you pillow and watches while you sleep  
Its light arrives on tiptoe gently taking you in its embrace  
Oh how I dream I might be like the velvet moon to you  
  
I might be like the velvet moon to you  
  
Como um radio de sol Like the sunshine  
  
I might be like the velvet moon to you  
  
A brincar com seui rosto Playing upon your face  
  
I might be like the velvet moon to you  
  
Como um radio de sol Like the sunshine  
  
I might be like the velvet moon wanna be like the velvet moon  
  
I might be like the velvet moon to you
