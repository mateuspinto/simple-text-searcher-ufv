Saviour of the night came slowly on the silent river  
And the lord of life came following his sins to be forgiven  
While the world sat back and laughed away the hours  
Till the dawning of the daybreak  
  
I heard them laugh I heard them cry  
I saw them praying to the sky  
I heard the wind howl in the trees  
Down there on bended knee  
And I see the light  
But I know I must be dreaming  
  
Feel the soul quiet emotion  
Sail on by helpless devotion  
If thats how it feels it better be real  
  
Take care of your woman  
Or youll never ever see the light  
Take heed of the warnin  
Or you know its gonna be too late  
  
Here there everywhere  
They keep on movin without fear  
They look me up they look me down  
They press my body to the ground  
But I see the light see the light its comin shinin  
  
And on a summers day  
When thoughts are drifting far away  
And life is good and real to see  
My world is saved and I am free  
But in the night  
Still I know I must be dreaming
