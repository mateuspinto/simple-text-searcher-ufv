One you come to my room for a little game  
Two you Ill do very erotic things  
  
I wanna make love babe very slowly  
Three times in a row all night Ill go  
  
I love when you come over  
And when you come  
It gives me fever  
  
Body next to mine  
Love dance syncopated time  
Sugar rush keeps me high  
Sweet kiss on my thigh  
I wanna make love baby very badly  
Feels good in the air every time youre here  
  
I love when you come over  
And when you come  
It gives me fever  
  
Dont keep me waiting anticipating  
Love I am saving for you  
Hear what Im saying  
You I am craving  
Love is here waiting for you  
All day youre staying  
Please no delaying  
Patiently waiting for you  
Dont keep me waiting  
No time for playing  
Sitting here waiting for you  
  
I love when you come over  
And when you come  
It gives me fever  
  
Come one over  
  
I love when you come over  
And when you come  
It gives me feva
