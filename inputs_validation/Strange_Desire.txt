My strange desire  
Is waiting here  
To be my light  
My shadow my storm  
This is all and  
This is you  
Turning into  
Another dream  
Please dont be  
Another dream  
  
Do you really think youre cared for  
Do we really know were loved  
Look at all my resolutions  
Promises to break your heart  
Why do we make it hot to handle  
Why do we lose our self control  
Strange desire take me over  
Offer me to the all above  
  
This is all and this is you  
  
Do you really think youre cared for  
Do we really know were loved  
Look at all my resolutions  
Promises to break your heart  
Why do we make it hot to handle  
Why do we lose our self control  
Strange desire take me over  
Offer me to the all above  
  
Meet again touch again  
Must have wanted  
Some paradise  
Long ago  
Thats unwise so unwise  
Look again I said  
Touch again  
Believe your fate  
Thats alright thats alright  
  
Do you really think youre cared for  
Do we really know were loved  
Look at all my resolutions  
Promises to break your heart  
Why do we make it hot to handle  
Why do we lose our self control  
Strange desire take me over  
Offer me to the all above  
  
Do you really think youre cared for  
Do we really know were loved  
Look at all my resolutions  
Promises to break your heart  
Why do we make it hot to handle  
Why do we lose our self control  
Strange desire take me over  
Offer me to the all above  
  
Do you really think youre cared for  
Do we really know were loved  
Look at all my resolutions  
Promises to break your heart  
Why do we make it hot to handle  
Why do we lose our self control  
Strange desire take me over  
Offer me to the all above
