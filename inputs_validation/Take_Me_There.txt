Theres a place in your heart nobodys been  
Take me there  
Things nobody knows not even your friends  
Take me there  
  
Tell me bout your mama your daddy your hometown show me around  
I wanna see it all dont leave anything out  
  
Chorus  
I wanna know everything about you then  
And I wanna go down every road youve been  
Where your hopes and dreams and wishes live  
Where you keep the rest of your life hid  
I wanna know the girl behind that pretty stare  
Take me there  
  
Your first real kiss your first true love  
You were scared show me where  
You learned about life spent your summer nights  
Without a care  
  
I wanna roll down Main Street the back roads  
Like you did when you were a kid  
What made you who you are  
Tell me what your story is  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah I wanna know everything about you  
Yeah everything about you baby  
I wanna go down every road youve been  
Where your hopes and dreams and wishes live  
Where you keep the rest of your life hid  
I wanna know the girl behind that pretty stare  
Take me take me take me there  
  
I wanna roll down Main Street  
I wanna know your hopes and your dreams  
Take me take me there
