Time is never ever standing still  
Except on Never Ending Hill  
  
From here you can see Devil Lake  
The velvet sunset is never too late  
  
Never Ending Hill is where I live  
The Old Oak Tree is standing still  
  
Can you hear the birds singing in the tree  
Can you hear the wind shaking all the leaves  
  
Whoa Take a look at the sky  
Golden clouds are moving right by my eyes  
Black Cat Magic is down by the lake  
Chasing butterflies that cant get away  
  
Now the sun is slowly going down  
I can hear Devil Lake is quiet now  
Magic Magic come home  
Say goodbye to your butterfly cause nighttime is coming our way  
  
Time is never ever standing still  
Except on Never Ending Hill  
  
From here you can see Devil Lake  
The velvet sunset is never too late  
  
Whoa Take a look at the sky  
Golden clouds are moving right by my eyes  
Black Cat Magic is down by the lake  
Chasing butterflies that cant get away  
  
Darkness coming  
Sun is drowning  
Drowning in Devil Lake  
Magic come in  
Light is fading  
Oh yeah its getting late  
  
Take a look at the sky  
Golden clouds are moving right by my eyes  
Black Cat Magic is down by the lake  
Chasing butterflies that cant get away
