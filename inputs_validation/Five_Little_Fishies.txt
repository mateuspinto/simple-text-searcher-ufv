Five little fishies swimming in a pool  
Wiggle five fingers  
  
The first one said The pool is cool  
Show one finger  
Then wrap arms around body  
  
The second one said The pool is deep  
Show two fingers  
Then hands measure deep  
  
The third one said I want to sleep  
Show three fingers  
Then rest head on hands  
  
The fourth one said Lets take a dip  
Show four fingers  
Then hands dive into water  
  
The fifth one said I spy a ship  
Show five fingers  
Then form scope with hands to peer through  
  
Fisher boat comes  
Form V with fingers  
Then move hands away from body  
  
Line goes kersplash  
Pretend to throw fishing line  
  
Away the five little fishies dash  
Wiggle five fingers away
