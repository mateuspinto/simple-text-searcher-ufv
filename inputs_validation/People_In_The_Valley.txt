Some came down to hang out by the river  
Others were waiting to find the night  
We stood long just waiting for the picture  
Looking at people to see what was right  
Soon came the people  
From over in the valley  
Hundreds of them walking  
Towards us in the rain  
Then we turned around  
And hid out in the alley  
Met along the stones  
Down Tomorrow Day Lane  
Take away the road and no one will remember  
How many journeys we hedged in the stone  
Friends around will take away the wonder  
Sharing a moment of being alone  
Soon came the people  
From over in the valley  
Hundreds of them walking  
Towards us in the rain  
And we turned around  
And hid out in the alley  
Met along the stones  
Down Tomorrow Day Lane  
Ba ba ba ba ba ba   
Ba da da da da da ba ba da da da da da ba ba ba
