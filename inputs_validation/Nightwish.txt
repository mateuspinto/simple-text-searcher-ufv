Oh setting Sun  
Thy red rays maketh me cry  
They remind me of the one  
Whose love awaits me in the sky  
  
A bridal bed awaits us both  
After the landscape of death I cross  
Before my sorrows I must die  
Nightwish I send through the starlit sky  
  
The voice of nightly winds has awakened me  
Amidst all the grief they embrace me with relief  
Beneath my dreams and wishes  
I long for thy caresses  
  
A bridal bed awaits us both  
After the landscape of death I cross  
Before my sorrows I must die  
Nightwish I send through the starlit sky  
  
Passed away in silence  
The flute from the realm unseen  
Empties its heart  
Making love to me  
With its enchanting melody  
Light of Orion  
Shadow of Andromeda  
Call of the dancing Universe  
Their love I must enter  
Before thou can blame my soul  
That is peace
