Did you ever wish  
Wish  
You could get  
Back something  
Uh huh  
That you did in your past  
Yeah  
  
If it wasnt for me  
I know what we had  
Would definitely gonna last  
  
I admit  
Admit  
That we say some things  
Uh huh

When were mad  
Yeah  
  
But I realize  
Yeah  
That Ive been foolish  
I never should have  
Yeah  
Turned my back  
  
Cause its  
A cold world  
When you  
Are out there  
Uh huh  
All alone  
All alone  
  
So many times  
That I wanted to just  
Pick up the phone  
Up the phone  
  
And tell you

And so  
I aint holding  
Back no more

Is coming home

Chorus  
And I want you  
To love me  
Like I never left  
And I want you  
To hold me  
Like I never left  
And I want you  
To touch me  
Like I never left  
Come give me  
What Im missing  
Like I never left  
Yeah yeah  
  
Do you think  
Think  
We could pick up  
Uh huh  
Where we left off  
Before the day  
The day yeah  
  
That I told you  
It was over  
Packed my things  
And moved away  
Moved away  
  
Cause I see  
See  
That without you  
Uh huh  
My world is just  
An empty place  
Place  
  
Taking one step away  
Yeah  
From you feels  
Like a million miles away  
Yeah  
  
Cause its  
A cold world  
When you  
Are out there  
Uh huh  
All alone  
All alone  
  
So many times  
I wanted to just  
Pick up the phone  
Up the phone  
  
And tell you  
Ooh baby  
Baby  
I miss your love  
And so  
  
But I aint holding  
Back no more  
No  
  
Cause your man  
Is coming home  
No  
  
Chorus
