I was taught to believe and never to doubt  
the man up above knows what hes talkin about  
So when I heard that voice so loud and clear  
speak to my heart I knew that she must be near  
  
The Maker said take her and love her forever  
take care of her for life and treat her right  
  
I never was the one to listen very well  
I walked my own way and felt what I felt  
further out of touch with the master plan  
but she was like a flight to the Promised Land  
  
The Maker said take her and love her forever  
take care of her for life  
Never forsake her dont be a heart breaker  
The Maker said take her and treat her right just treat her right  
  
He placed an angel in the palm of my hands  
And for once in my life I obeyed His commands  
Ill take her and love her forever take care of her for life  
Ooh never forsake her dont be a heart breaker  
The Maker said take her and treat her right just treat her right  
Ooh just treat her right  
  
The Maker said take her and love her forever  
take care of her for life  
Never forsake her dont be a heart breaker  
The Maker said take her and treat her right treat her right  
For life
