Power pop  
Read about the things that happen throughout the world  
Dont be believe in everything you see or hear  
The neighbors talk day in day out about the goings on  
They tell us what they want they dont give an inch  
  
Look at the pictures taken by the cameras they cannot lie  
The truth is in what you see not what you read  
Little men tapping things out points of view  
Remember their views are not the gospel truth  
  
Dont believe it all  
Find out for yourself  
Check before you spread  
News of the world  
  
Never doubt  
Never ask  
Never moan  
Never search  
Never find  
Never know  
  
Each morning our key to the world comes through the door  
More than often its just a comic not much more  
Dont take it too serious not many do  
Read between the lines and youll find the truth  
  
Read all about it read all about it news of the world
