Forgiving you was easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time  
I just keep thinking and your memory is forever on my mind  
You know Ill always love you and I cant forget the days when you were mine  
Forgiving you is easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time  
The bitter fruit of anger growing from the seeds of jealousy  
Oh what a heartache but I forgive the things you said to me  
Cause I believe forgiving is the only way that Ill find peace of mind  
And forgiving you is easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time  
  
The years have passed so quickly as once again fate steals a young mans
dreams  
Of all the golden years and growing old together you and me  
You asked me to forgive you you said there was another on your mind  
Forgiving you is easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time  
Forgiving you is easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time
