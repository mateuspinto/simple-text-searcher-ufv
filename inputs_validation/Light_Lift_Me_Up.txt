Oh searching tired of love grown up now it all falls out  
Oh lovely dreamer  magic prince  swoop you up swoop you up  
But no no i just one guess  man at all  
While I grow up came your way  
Nobodys so special in this way nobody to sweep you away  
  
Oh light oh light come and lift me up  
Oh light please come lift me up  
Oh sweet light come lift me up  
  
When you go down remember your steps  
As a baby rememberin how he walked  
Rememberin all the sweetest dreaming you did  
While you ticktock along but now all gone  
Theres nothing here for your dream but hope in a song  
Just like the bent back of an old woman that you know  
Its all gone and severed and alone so I rhyme  
  
So now all you see is sad  
All look the same as the wall inside  
She feels swallowed up she feels tired as she could  
Creepin along this wall  
And this wall its so long  
Its a wall and lips theyre alone  
Sweet lips theyve lost their way a while  
Like the bent back of an old woman  
  
Whats true that way  
Whats true hey way  
  
I came crying to you came on me knees  
Begging father lift me up please  
But no as I came down no flowered sound  
Just emptiness in side me  
  
Oh light lift me up please lift me up  
Come down and pick me up already  
Forgive me all my selfish ways sweet light  
Pick me up from my misery  
  
Im gonna get away  Im back to you  
The way that I do  
The way that I picture you  
The way that I picture you  
  
Lift me up from the bottom to the top  
Lift me up sweet light  
Lift me up from the bottom to the top  
Lift me up sweet light  
Lift me up bottom to the top  
Lift me up sweet light  
Lift me up from the bottom to the top  
Lift me up sweet light
