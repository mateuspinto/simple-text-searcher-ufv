We took the night as it came to us  
And it came like the tide from the sea  
Long legged dusty eyed satisfied woman  
Come spend the morning with me  
  
We took the night as it came to us  
Both of us hungry and free  
Long legged open eyed satisfied woman  
Come spend the morning with me  
  
Come spend the morning with me  
Come spend the morning with me  
  
Wake up my lady the darkness is gone  
Whatever will be let it be  
Long legged dusty eyed satisfied woman  
Come on spend the morning with me
