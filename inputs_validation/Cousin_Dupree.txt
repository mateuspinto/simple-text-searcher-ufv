Well Ive kicked around a lot since high school  
Ive worked a lot of nowhere gigs  
From keyboard man in a rockn ska band  
To haulin boss crude in the big rigs  
  
Now Ive come back home to plan my next move  
From the comfort of my Aunt Fayes couch  
When I see my little cousin Janine walk in  
All I could say was ow ow ouch  
  
Chorus  
Honey how youve grown  
Like a rose  
Well we used to play  
When we were three  
How about a kiss for your cousin Dupree  
  
She turned my life into a living hell  
In those little tops and tight capris  
I pretended to be readin the National Probe  
As I was watchin her wax her skis  
  
On Saturday night she walked in with her date  
And backs him up against the wall  
I tumbled off the couch and heard myself sing  
In a voice I never knew I had before  
  
Chorus  
  
Ill teach you everything I know  
If you teach me how to do that dance  
Life is short and quid pro quo  
And whats so strange about a downhome family romance  
  
One night were playin gin by a cracklin fire  
And I figured Id make my play  
I said babe with my boyish charm and good looks  
How can you stand it for one more day  
  
She said maybe its the skeevy look in your eyes  
Or that your mind has turned to applesauce  
The dreary architecture of your soul  
I said but what is it exactly turns you off  
  
Chorus
