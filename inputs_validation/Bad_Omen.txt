Down fell the stars and they splashed in the sea  
Mi nomine baphomet come dance with me  
Sacrifice the virgins spiritual rites  
Their master has come the moon is full tonight  
Drinking dancing they worship and toast  
The Devil whos watching with demons remote  
Fire rising racing in your blood  
Possessed naive his service is done  
Bloody blasphemy  
Sinisters the word as the demons take their fill  
An orgys taking place human blood will spill  
And act of worship as they conceive the ghouls  
Satan has their souls they sing pagan tunes  
The ceremony is sure to be cursed  
They wait for his blessing but down comes the worst  
Their bodies soulless a corpse from the grave  
Their minds are helpless and no one can save them  
No one can save them
