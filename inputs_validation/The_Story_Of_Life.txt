The story of jesus  
So easy to explain  
After they crucified him  
A woman she claimed his name  
The story of jesus  
The whole Bible knows  
Went all across the desert  
And in the middle he found a rose  
  
There should be no questions  
There should be no lies  
He was married ever happily after  
All the tears we cry  
No use in arguing  
All the use to the man that moans  
When each man falls in battle  
His soul it has to roam  
Angles of heaven  
Flying saucers to some  
Made easter sunday  
The name of the rising sun  
  
The story is written  
By so many people who dared  
To lay down the truth  
To so very many who cared  
To carry the cross  
Of jesus and beyond  
We will guide the light  
This time with a woman in our arms  
We as men  
Cant explain the reason why  
The womans always mentioned  
At the moment that we die  
All we know  
Is God is by our side  
And he says the word  
So easy yet so hard  
  
I wish not to be alone  
So I must respect my other heart  
Oh the story  
Of jesus is the story  
Of you and me  
No use in feeling lonely  
I am searching to be free  
  
The story  
Of life is quicker  
Than the wink of an eye  
The story of love  
Is hello and goodbye  
Until we meet again
