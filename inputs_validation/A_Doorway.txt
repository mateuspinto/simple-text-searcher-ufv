When you gave your love to me I never gave you chains  
If you need to prove youre free  
My love for you remains you know my love stays  
Love is not a prison cell  
True love can never die  
Theres nothing that you shouldnt tell  
You never have to lie to me you shouldnt  
  
But if you have to keep something inside you  
You know Ill never want to steal it away  
  
I respect your territory  
Hope theres room in world for me  
Is there room in your mind to see  
a doorway  if you say  
  
Blood is pumping through my heart  
And flowing through my veins  
All it keeps me living for  
The love that is sustains You now I never  
Time stopped when I saw your face  
And if it start Ill cry  
The universe is in your smile  
Is heaven in your eye   
  
But if you have to keep something inside you  
You know Ill never want to steal it away  
  
I respect your territory  
Hope theres room in your world for me  
Is there room in your mind to see  
a doorway  if you say  
I respect your territory you need your territory  
Hope theres room in your world for me find a place in your world for me
