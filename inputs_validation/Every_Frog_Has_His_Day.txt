King  
Oh mellifluous dwarf  
Prince of all the jesters  
Funny little thing you are  
Make me laugh  
As Gods voluminous star  
Hop Frog  
Gracious majesty  
Today is not made for laughter day  
This moment sacred is more for royal sunsets  
Then comic ruin or suicidal jests  
King  
Ill be the judge of that thank you  
Make me laugh le petite cur  
Drink some wine  
Lest you foul sweet time  
Hop Frog  
Drink upsets me  
Please your liege  
This would mark the death me  
King  
I said drink you scabrous whore  
Are you deaf as well as short  
Tripitena  
Kingdoms Sire  
Big as you are  
Save such  
Bile for larger foes  
King  
Make me laugh  
Fore I stretch your neck like a giraffe
