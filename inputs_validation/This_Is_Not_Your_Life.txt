I dont understand you  
The way you disappear  
You dont understand me  
The way I keep us here  
  
This is not your life  
I know how to do it on my own  
This is not your life  
  
We were only children  
But you knew the game  
And you were busy feeling  
That someone had to take the blame  
  
But I know how youre really  
When no ones around  
We were only children  
Looking to be found  
  
This is not your life  
I know how to do it on my own  
This is not your life  
I know how to do it on my own  
This is not your life  
  
Even after the fall  
No one ever seemed to care  
And now you come back to call  
And you want me to be here  
  
I know how to do it on my own  
This is not your life  
I know how to do it on my own  
This is not your life  
And I know how to do it on my own  
And this is not your life  
I know how to do it on my own  
And this is not your life
