When I close my eyes  
I can see for miles  
Theres comfort in my dark seat  
And chaos in the aisles  
  
These eyes are not your eyes  
And these eyes are not the color that  
Your arid eyes might be  
No I was not around  
When those eyes of yours decided so  
I refuse to kneel before the  
Sights you choose to see  
  
When I close my eyes  
I remember why I smile  
Under my umbrella  
Im an accomplished exile  
  
These eyes are not your eyes  
And these eyes are not the color that  
Your arid eyes might be  
No I was not around  
When those eyes of yours decided so  
I refuse to kneel before the sights you choose to see  
  
If this is right Id rather be wrong  
If this is sight Id rather be blind  
  
These eyes are not your eyes  
And these eyes are not the color that  
Your arid eyes might be  
No I was not around  
When those eyes of yours decided so  
I refuse to kneel before the sights you choose to see  
  
If this is right Id rather be wrong  
If this is sight Id rather be blind
