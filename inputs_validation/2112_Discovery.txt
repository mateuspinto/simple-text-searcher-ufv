What can this strange device be  
When I touch it it gives forth a sound  
Its got wires that vibrate and give music  
What can this thing be that I found  
See how it sings like a sad heart  
And joyously screams out its pain  
Incomprehensible that build high like a mountain  
Or notes that fall gently like rain  
I cant wait to share this new wonder  
The people will all see its light  
Let them all make their own music  
The priests praise my name on this night
