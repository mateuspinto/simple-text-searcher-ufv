Theres been some hard feelings here  
About some words that were said  
Theres been some hard feelings here  
And what is more  
Theres been a bloody purple nose  
And some bloody purple clothes  
That were messing up the lobby floor  
Its just apartment house rules  
So all you partment fools  
Remember one mans ceiling  
Is another mans floor  
Remember one mans ceiling  
Is another mans floor  
  
Theres been some strange goins on  
And some folks have come and gone  
And the elevator man dont work no more  
I heard a racket in the hall  
And I thought I heard a fall  
But I never opened up my door  
Its just apartment house sense  
Its like apartment rents  
Remember one mans ceiling  
Is another mans floor  
Remember one mans ceiling  
Is another mans floor  
  
And theres an alley  
In the back of my building  
Where some people congregate in shame  
I was walking with my dog  
And the night was black with smog  
When I thought I heard somebody  
Call my name
