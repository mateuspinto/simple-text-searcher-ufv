I opened up my eyes to see  
A land of sunny rocks and funny trees  
I guess Yes Im on the moon again  
A heavy earth exchange a lighter breeze  
Got no coat and got no money  
A pair of tennis shoes to last through May  
A crater for an outdoor pool  
A few good cats to help me pass the day  
  
Havin a good time here today  
Watching the sun shine matinee  
Never the wrong time time we stay  
Living the moontime time we play  
  
From here I watch the world go by  
Working in the moontime bar and grill  
The word from Earth my time is up  
But here upon the moon time stands still  
Got no telecommunications  
Cables havent gotten out this way  
The man in the moon is a musician  
Thats the way we pass the lunar day  
  
Havin a good time here today  
Watching the sun shine matinee  
Never the wrong time time we stay  
Living the moontime time we play  
Living the moontime time to live it up
