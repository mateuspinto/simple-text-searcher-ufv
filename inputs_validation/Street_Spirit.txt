Rows of houses all bearing down on me  
I can feel their blue hands touching me  
All these things into position  
All these things well one day swallow whole  
And fade out again  
And fade out  
This machine will will not communicate  
These thoughts and the strain I am under  
Be a world child form a circle  
Before we all go under  
And fade out again  
And fade out again  
Cracked eggs dead birds  
Scream as they fight for life  
I can feel death can see its beady eyes  
All these things into position  
All these things well one day swallow whole  
And fade out again  
And fade out again  
Immerse your soul in love  
Immerse your soul in love
