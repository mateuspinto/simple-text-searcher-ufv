Lullay Thou little tiny Child  
By by lully lullay  
O sisters too how may we do  
For to preserve this day  
This poor youngling for whom we sing  
By by lully lullay  
Herod the king in his raging  
Charged he hath this day  
His men of might in his own sight  
All young children to slay  
That woe is me poor Child for Thee  
And ever morn and day  
For thy parting neither say nor sing
