Id rather be a sparrow than a snail  
Yes I would  
If I could I surely would  
Id rather be a hammer than a nail  
Yes I would  
If I only could I surely would  
  
Away Id rather sail away  
Like a swan thats here and gone  
A man gets tied up to the ground  
He gives the world  
Its saddest sound its saddest sound  
  
Id rather be a forest than a street  
Yes I would  
If I could I surely would  
Id rather feel the earth beneath my feet  
Yes I would  
If I only could I surely would
