Put on the dress in which you were married  
Pull down the veil till your eyes are hid  
  
Can you remember where we both came from  
Let us do as we did  
  
Look at tomorrow today  
Making tomorrow today  
Make tomorrow make tomorrow make tomorrow today  
  
Put back the photo under the window  
Put down the phone that you hold in your hand  
  
Put away these things that stand in between us  
Let us be what we can  
  
When it seems hopeless  
When it seems hopeless  
  
Make tomorrow make tomorrow make tomorrow today  
  
What better measure of what you were doing here  
Than what you can leave behind  
  
All the children of your childrens children  
Do you ever think what theyre going to find  
  
Make tomorrow make tomorrow  
Where the sacred met the scared  
  
Make tomorrow make tomorrow  
Where the dreamers dream is dared  
  
In each one of us a dream can burn like the sun  
Lets try it all one more time to get this lesson learned  
  
Sitting up in a spaceship  
Looking down at the earth  
You wonder what theyre struggling for  
Whats it all really worth  
  
Making tomorrow today  
Making tomorrow today  
Make tomorrow Make tomorrow
