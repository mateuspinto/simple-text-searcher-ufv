Still scowling black  
Good Captain Clack  
Must eat his humble pie  
His bed is made  
The colors fade  
His eyes once wet are dry  
  
The naked muse  
Who sits and chews  
Tobacco off a tree  
Removes his shoes  
Gives way to booze  
And searches endlessly  
  
See the naked lumberlack  
Sip his aphrodisiac  
Cottonpicking farmers three  
Though I lost my weather vane  
And of sense I have one grain  
Im content sipping lemon tea
