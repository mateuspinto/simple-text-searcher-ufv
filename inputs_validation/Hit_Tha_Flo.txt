Chorus  
Yeah its goin down yeah its goin down  
Watch it hit tha flo watch it hit tha flo  
Watch it hit tha flo watch it hit tha flo  
Watch it hit tha flo watch it hit tha flo  
Watch it hit tha flo watch it hit tha flo  
  
The way little shorty go Im trying to think where i should take her  
Watch her hit tha flo Im out here spending all this paper  
Bought some cigarillos yeah I blow it by the acre  
If you lookin this good well shit I wanna meet your maker  
Take her to my home Say hello to my neighbors  
She my biggest fan I see her man just trying to save her  
Put it in her mouth and yeah my taste shes trying to savor  
Shorty saying Khalifa Man should have his own flavor  
Haters wanna be me but cant walk in my Chuck Taylors  
All black elevens Mac11 with the laser  
Mami keep on shaking it like she a salt shaker  
Hand on the ground everybody around  
  
Chorus  
  
A lot of niggas hate but all the bitches wanna do me  
Wizzle L Jackson Yeah my life is like a movie  
Heavy Hustle Gang Swisher Sweets with the jacuzzi  
Probably fucked your girl If you dont like it nigga sue me  
Shawty from the hood but in the club she actin booshie  
Body like a centerfold Boy look at that booty  
My ink got her gone Wanting to know who tattoos me  
Head game right Just said shed like to ride Yeah  
DJ play my song When it come on she gets excited  
Before I leave the club Ill put her number in my sidekick  
Swagger on some different shit She tell me that she like it  
Watch her break it down I aint playin around  
  
Chorus
