What the fuck is this world  
Running to you didnt  
Leave a message at least I  
Could of learned your voice one last time  
Daily mine field this could  
Be my time bout you  
Would you hit me  
Would you hit me  
Oh oh oh oh whoa whoa oh  
  
All the bills go by and  
Initiatives are taken up  
By the middle there aint gonna be any middle any more  
And the cross Im bearing home  
Aint indicative of my place left the porch  
Left the porch oh oh oh  
  
Hear my name take a good look  
This could be the day  
Hold my hand walk beside me  
I just need to say  
  
Hear my name take a good look  
This could be the day  
Hold my hand walk beside me  
I just need to say  
I could not take ajust one day  
I know when I would not ever touch you  
Hold you feel you in my arms ever again  
  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah
