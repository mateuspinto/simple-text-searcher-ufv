Have you ever felt the future is the past but you dont know how  
A reflected dream of a captured time is it really now is it really
happening  
  
Dont know why I feel this way have I dreamt this time this place  
Something vivid comes again into my mind  
And I think Ive seen your face seen this room been in this place  
Something vivid comes again into my mind  
  
All my hopes and expectations looking for an explanation  
Have I found my destination I just cant take no more  
  
The dream is true the dream is true  
The dream is true the dream is true  
  
Think Ive heard your voice before think Ive said these words before  
Something makes me feel I just might lose my mind  
Am I still inside my dream Is this a new reality  
Something makes me feel that I have lost my mind  
  
All my hopes and expectations looking for an explanation  
Coming to the realization that I cant see for sure  
  
I only dream in black and white I only dream cause Im alive  
I only dream in black and white to save me from myself  
I only dream in black and white I only dream cause Im alive  
I only dream in black and white please save me from myself  
  
The dream is true the dream is true  
The dream is true the dream is true  
  
I get up put on the light dreading the oncoming night  
Scared to fall asleep and dream the dream again  
Nothing that I contemplate nothing that I can compare  
To letting loose the demons deep inside my head  
  
Dread to think what might be stirring that my dream is reoccurring  
Got to keep away from drifting saving me from myself  
  
I only dream in black and white I only dream cause Im alive  
I only dream in black and white to save me from myself  
I only dream in black and white I only dream cause Im alive  
I only dream in black and white to save me from myself  
  
Lost in a dream of mirrors lost in a paradox  
Lost and time is spinning lost a nightmare I retrace  
Lost a hell that I revisit lost another time and place  
Lost a parallel existence lost a nightmare I retrace  
  
I only dream in black and white I only dream cause Im alive  
I only dream in black and white to save me from myself  
I only dream in black and white I only dream cause Im alive  
I only dream in black and white to save me from myself  
  
I only dream in black and white I only dream cause Im alive  
I only dream in black and white to save me from myself  
I only dream in black and white I only dream cause Im alive  
I only dream in black and white to save me from myself  
  
The dream is true the dream is true  
The dream is true the dream is true
