Lay your body down upon the midnight snow  
Feel the cold of winter in your hair  
Here in a world of your own  
In a casing thats grown  
To the childrens delight  
That arrived on the night  
  
Here they come to play their magic games  
Carving names upon your frozen hand  
Here in a world of your own  
Like a sleeper whose eyes  
Sees the pain with surprise  
As it smothers your cries  
Theyll never never know  
  
Hey theres a Snowman  
Hey hey what a Snowman  
Pray for the Snowman  
Ooh ooh what a Snowman  
They say a snow years a good year  
Filled with the love of all who lie so deep  
  
Smiling faces tear your body to the ground  
Covered red that only we can see  
Here in a ball that they made  
From the snow on the ground  
See it rolling away  
With wild eyes to the sky  
Theyll never never know  
  
Hey theres a Snowman  
Hey what a Snowman  
Pray for the Snowman  
Ooh ooh what a Snowman  
They say a snow years a good year  
Filled with the love of all who lie so deep  
  
Hey there goes the Snowman  
Hey there what a Snowman  
Hey there lies a Snowman  
Hey there was a Snowman  
They say a snow years a good year  
Filled with the love of all who lie so deep  
  
Hey there goes the Snowman
