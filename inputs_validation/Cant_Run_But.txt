I cant run but  
I can walk much faster than this  
Cant run but  
I cant run but  
I can walk much faster than this  
Cant run but  
  
A cooling system  
Burns out the Ukraine  
Trees and umbrellas  
Protect us from the new rain  
Armies of engineers  
To analyze the soil  
The food we contemplate  
The water that we boil  
  
I cant run but  
I can walk much faster than this  
Cant run but  
I cant run but  
I can walk much faster than this  
Cant run but  
Oowe Oowe  
  
I had a dream about us  
In the bottles and the bones of the night  
I felt a pain in my shoulder blade  
Like a pencil point A love bite  
A couple was rubbing against us  
Rubbing and doing that new dance  
The man was wearing a jacket and jeans  
The woman was laughing in advance  
  
I cant run but  
I can walk much faster than this  
Cant run but  
I cant run but  
I can walk much faster than this  
Cant run but  
  
A winding river  
Gets wound around a heart Pull it  
  
Tighter and tighter  
Until the muddy waters part  
Down by the river bank  
A blues band arrives  
The music suffers  
The music business thrives  
  
I cant run but  
I can walk much faster than this  
Cant run but  
I cant run but  
I can walk much faster than this  
Cant run but  
Oowe Oowe
