Oh the rain is slowly falling and my heart is so sore  
Six more miles and leave my darling never on this earth to meet no more  
Six more miles to the graveyard six more miles long and sad  
Six more miles and leave my darling leave the best friend I ever had  
  
Oh I hear the train a coming bringing my darling back home  
Six more miles to the graveyard and Ill be left here all alone  
Six more miles  
  
Six more miles
