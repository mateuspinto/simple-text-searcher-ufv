You know my baby told me not so very long ago  
He said I dont love you baby  
And you got to you got to let me go  
And that was too much too much for me  
Thats why I walked the back streets and cry  
  
You know it hurts me so bad  
To hear my baby say  
Hear my baby say goodbye  
  
He said another reason that makes me wanna leave  
You aint got enough of nothin to keep me keep me   
That was too much oh too much for me  
Thats why I walked the back streets the back street and cry  
Oh yeah  
  
Oh it hurts me it hurts me so bad  
Oh to hear my baby  
Hear my baby say goodbye  
  
He said Youre a good woman Etta  
To treat me like you do  
He said You aint done nothin to me  
I just cant stay here with you  
  
I stood and watch my baby as far as I could see  
You know the men started runnin  
After waiving waiving goodbye to me  
That was too much too much for me  
Thats why I walked the back streets and cry  
Oh yeah  
  
You know it hurts me it hurts me so bad  
Oh to hear my baby  
Hear my baby say goodbye  
Hear and say goodbye  
  
You know it hurts me so bad  
To hear my baby say goodbye  
Thats why I walked the back streets  
The back streets and cry  
  
Oh I said it hurts me it hurts me so bad  
Hear my baby say so long  
Oh it hurts me hurts me hurts me so bad  
Hear my baby say hear my baby say goodbye  
  
Oh baby oh oh it hurts me so bad  
Hear my baby say goodbye  
That why I walked the back streets  
That why I walked the back streets and cry  
Oh that why I walked the back streets and cry
