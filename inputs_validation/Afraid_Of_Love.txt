You stole my heart the moment you came to town  
I said hello but you were gone when I turned around  
You cant get away cant get away even if you try now  
I want to tell you but the words just cant be found  
  
I like the way you move and just the way you are  
I cant take anymore cause girl youre pushin too hard  
You cant get away cant let you go whats a boy to do now  
You got me askin myself how I survived this far  
  
Chorus  
I gotta get away from you girl  
Cause Ive never been afraid of love til I met you  
Never thought a girl could make me feel the way you do  
Never been afraid of never been afraid of love til I met you  
Ooh yes you say  
  
Cant be something that you never ever had  
When I stop and think about you it makes me laugh  
You took me by surprise I saw it in your eyes I never had a chance girl  
Now that I see what you are it doesnt hurt so bad  
  
Chorus
