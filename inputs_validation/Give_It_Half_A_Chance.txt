I wake up  
In the middle of a dream  
To an unfamiliar scene  
Wonder what I fell into  
Who knows why  
People look for alibis  
In a passing strangers eyes  
What am I supposed to do  
So tonight  
Tell her that you love her tonight  
The only way to know is to try  
tonight  
Give it half a chance  
And the glow  
From the bathroom down the hall  
Lights a mirror on a wall  
Where a stranger stares at me  
Hello stranger  
Where you been  
Do you still remember when  
Well every heartache has an end  
N maybe yours is on the way  
One by one  
Let the nights go on  
And you wont need yesterday  
Beside you  
See yourself in love again  
And believe in the arms youre in  
Tonight  
CHORUS
