From Justus  
It breaks my heart to say Goodbye  
I know that I deserve to cry  
I know that time will see me through  
But in this mean time  
All I dream about is you  
  
Unlucky stars are in my sky  
My fortune teller she saw me and cried  
She said that I might have to wait  
My lucky ship is lost  
And comin in too late  
  
Unlucky stars  
Unlucky stars  
Venus and Mars  
Are up in arms  
  
If now its time to let to  
Give me some time to let you know  
That I adored you till the end  
I couldnt stand another day without a friend  
I couldnt stand another day without a friend
