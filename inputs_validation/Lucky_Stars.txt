Woke up just the other day  
Fell out of bed and my dog ran away  
The car wont start and the weather was cold and gray  
I got stuck in a traffic jam  
My major meeting didnt go as I planned  
Looks like its gonna be another one of those days  
  
I got a roof over my head  
Someone to love me in a four poster bed  
And I can play this here guitar  
I thank my lucky stars  
  
Politicians speak and it makes me Ill  
People are dyin just for a thrill  
Maybe its just evolution gone astray  
  
The climates too hot musics gotten cold  
Ive livin like a health nut but I still grow old  
You do what you can on the edge of the Milky Way  
  
Got a roof over my head  
Someone to love me in a four poster bed  
And I can play this here guitar  
Gonna thank my lucky stars  
  
Wrapped up in the problems of the day  
Just remember theres no rewind and no replay  
Dont you worry cause it aint gonna fix a thing  
  
Woke up just the other day  
Thought that maybe Id be OK  
Cause the story Ive been getting  
Aint written anywhere  
  
Got a roof over my head  
Someone to love me in a four poster bed  
And I can play this here guitar  
Gonna thank my lucky stars  
  
Got a roof over my head  
Someone to love me in a four poster bed  
And I can play this here guitar  
I thank my lucky stars  
Gonna thank my lucky stars  
Thank you stars
