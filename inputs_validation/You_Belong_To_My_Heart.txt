You belong to my heart  
Now and forever  
Though our love had its start  
Not long ago  
  
Well we were gathering stars  
And a million guitars  
Played our love song  
  
When I said I love you  
Every beat of my heart  
Said it too  
  
Was a moment like this  
When I first found you  
And your eyes threw a kiss  
When they met mine  
  
Now we own all the stars  
And a million guitars  
Are still playing  
  
Now you are a song  
And youll always belong  
To my heart  
  
Now you are a song  
And youll always belong  
To my heart
