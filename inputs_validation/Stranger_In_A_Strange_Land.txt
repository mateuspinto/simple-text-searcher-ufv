Was many years ago that I left home and came this way  
I was a young man full of hopes and dreams  
But now it seems to me that all is lost and nothing gained  
Sometimes things aint what they seem  
No brave new world no brave new world  
No brave new world no brave new world  
  
Night and day I scan horizon sea and sky  
My spirit wanders endlessly  
Until the day will dawn and friends from home discover why  
Hear me calling rescue me  
Set me free set me free  
Lost in this place and leave no trace  
  
Stranger in a strange land  
Land of ice and snow  
Trapped here in this prison yeah  
Lost and far from home  
  
One hundred years have gone and men again they came that way  
To find the answer to the mystery  
They found his body lying where it fell on that day  
Preserved in time for all to see  
No brave new world no brave new world  
Lost in this place and leave no trace  
  
What became of the man that started  
All are gone and their souls departed  
Left me here in this place  
So all alone  
  
Stranger in a strange land  
Land of ice and snow  
Trapped inside this prison  
Lost and far from home  
  
What became of the man that started  
All are gone and their souls departed  
Left me here in this place  
So all alone  
  
Stranger in a strange land  
Land of ice and snow  
Trapped inside this prison  
Lost and far from home  
  
Stranger in a strange land  
Land of ice and snow  
Trapped inside this prison  
Lost and far from home  
  
Stranger in a strange land  
Land of ice and snow  
Trapped inside this prison  
Lost and far from home
