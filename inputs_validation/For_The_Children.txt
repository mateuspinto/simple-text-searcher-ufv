I wish I could give you an answer  
As to when life really begins  
I wish I could tell you where we went  
When our days here come to an end  
Wish I could see the future  
The same way I see the past  
Wish I could draw a conclusion  
Why nothing here seems to last  
  
Chorus  
I cant even make a guess  
Or an uneducated thought  
All I can do here is my best  
And be thankful for what weve got  
  
Why do so many suffer  
Oppressed to the end of time  
Why does freedom move so slowly  
Unable to speak its mind  
Some say its a circle  
Others think we live on the wing  
Why are promises broken  
And some think life dont mean a thing  
  
Chorus  
  
I hope you can be a child of life  
With big dreams for everyone  
And know that dyings as natural as birth  
And our troubles here they dont last long  
I have worried about many things  
Most of which did not come to pass  
Hope you find someone to give you love  
And that your love will last  
  
Chorus  
  
Weve got
