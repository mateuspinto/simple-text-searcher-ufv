Headline murder young girl killed  
Desperate shooting at echos hill  
Dreadful ending killer died  
Evidently suicide  
  
A witness heard a horrifying sound  
He ran to find a woman dead and  
Lying on the ground  
  
Standing by her was a man  
Nervous shaking gun in hand  
Witness says he tried to help  
But hed turned the weapon on himself  
  
His body fell across that poor young girl  
After shouting out in vain  
The witness ran to call for assistance  
A sad close to a broken love affair  
  
Our deeds have traveled far  
What we have been is what we are  
  
Our deeds have traveled far  
What we have been is what we are  
  
She wanted love forever  
But he had another plan  
He fell into an evil way  
She had to let him down  
She said I cant love a wayward man  
  
She may have found a reason to forgive  
If he had only tried to change  
Was their fatal meeting prearranged  
  
Had a violent struggle taken place  
There was every sign that lead there  
Witness found a switchblade on the ground  
Was the victim unaware  
They continued to investigate  
They found a note in the killers pocket  
It could have been a suicide letter  
Maybe he had lost her love  
  
I feel theres only one thing left to do  
Id sooner take my life away  
Than live with losing you
