Frantic minds are terrified  
Life lies in a grave  
Silent death rides high above  
On the wings of revelation  
Multi death from chemicals  
Arrogance has won  
Annihilation must be swift  
Destroy without destruction  
  
Gods on the throne must be watching from hell  
Awaiting the mass genocide  
Soldiers defeated by death from a smell  
Bodies lie dormant no life  
Rising new souls on the lands where they fell  
Demons not ready to die  
Nothing to see where the sleeping souls lie  
  
Chemical warfare  
  
Artificial fucking peace  
Line up in a death row  
Generals in their slow defeat  
Diminished from this hell  
Banished from the dying world  
The lords of hell await  
Dogs of war are helpless prey  
To immortality  
  
Gods on the throne must be watching from hell  
Awaiting the mass genocide  
Soldiers defeated by death from a smell  
Bodies lie dormant no life  
Rising new souls on the lands where they fell  
Demons not ready to die  
Nothing to see where the sleeping souls lie  
  
Chemical warfare  
  
Fuck it up  
  
Liquidate  
The torture kills the troops that try to fight  
Terminate  
Human pesticide bring days of doom  
Mist falls  
The deadly gas that brings them to their knees  
Sacrifice  
Steal the soul and send his corpse to hell  
  
Mummified regions lying in dust  
Fall victim to this game  
Petrified corpses bathing in rust  
Taken without being blamed  
Falsified spirits farther they fall  
Soon they will join us in hell  
See the sky burning the gates are ablaze  
Satan awaits eager to merge  
  
Gods on the throne must be watching from hell  
Awaiting the mass genocide  
Soldiers defeated by death from a smell  
Bodies lie dormant no life  
Rising new souls on the lands where they fell  
Demons not ready to die  
Nothing to see where the sleeping souls lie  
  
Chemical warfare
