Its for the ghetto uh man its for the ghetto yeah  
Its for the ghetto uh its for the ghetto yeah

Leanin dipped in rocks pump the joint on the block  
Behind the Dolce Gabbana shades peepin the spots  
Frostbit and Im turnin blue thats why Im so hot  
Put the hustle down majorly and never get knocked  
  
Who can grind for this Momma taught me to swerve  
Rent the presidential suite out snatch ya bird  
My motto is dough or die peace sign in the sky  
In the brand new lectric blue Bentley ridin by  
  
Hurt these clowns anybody that want it  
Let you borrow my crown tell me why would you flaunt it  
Dont you know you can get it have your wigpiece splitted  
Meth asked me to spit it see my coupes is kitted  
  
And my minks is fitted lyrically Im siddick  
Honey frontin when you around I always hit it  
The boss is home regulatin on chrome  
Tell Russell its line one LLs on the phone

This year leave the bar hit the floor  
Represent let these clowns know who you are  
  
When its bangin like this why stop Why stop  
Ask me why I pop Cris why not Why not  
The flow of the century  
Got your Belve splashin to the melody what you tellin me

Leavin momma with a tear in her eye  
You was frontin for a minute now what  
You snapped when the joint dropped
