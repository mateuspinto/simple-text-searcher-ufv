Its cold outside  
It gets so hot in here  
And the boys and girls collide  
To the music in my ear  
  
Hear the children crying  
And I know its time to go  
I hear the children crying  
Take me home  
  
A painted face  
And I know we havent long  
We thought that we had the answers  
It was the questions we had wrong  
  
Hear the children crying  
And I know its time to go  
I hear the children crying  
Take me home  
  
Sad song sad song  
Sad song sad song  
  
La lah la lahLa lah la lahLa lah lah  
Repeat 4x  
  
Sad song sad song  
Sad song sad song  
  
Call out your name  
Call out in shame  
Call out your name  
Call out  
You better call out  
Call call call out
