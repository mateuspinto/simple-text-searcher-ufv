If you want me to do everything girl just for you  
Change your mind telling me lies  
Come and see you in the morning come and see you in the morning  
Time after time told me lies these are things girl which I despise  
If I go wrong in your eyes leave you girl in the morning  
Leave you girl in the morning  
  
As time goes by wish you had never treated me so bad  
You know youre only going to want me back  
Far away in the morning far away in the morning  
If you want me to do everything girl just for you  
Change your mind telling me lies  
Come and see you in the morning come and see you in the morning  
Follow you home in the morning follow you home in the morning
