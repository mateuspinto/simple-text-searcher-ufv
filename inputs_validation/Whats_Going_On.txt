Mother mother  
Theres too many of you crying  
Brother brother brother  
Theres far too many of you dying  
You know weve got to find a way  
To bring some lovin here today yea  
  
Father father  
We dont need to escalate  
You see war is not the answer  
For only love can conquer hate  
You know weve got to find a way  
To bring some lovin here today  
  
Picket lines and picket signs  
Dont punish me with brutality  
Talk to me so you can see  
Oh whats going on

In the mean time

Father father everybody thinks were wrong  
Oh but who are they to judge us  
Simply because our hair is long  
Oh you know weve got to find a way  
To bring some understanding here today  
Oh  
  
Picket lines and picket signs  
Dont punish me with brutality  
Talk to me  
So you can see

Right on baby
