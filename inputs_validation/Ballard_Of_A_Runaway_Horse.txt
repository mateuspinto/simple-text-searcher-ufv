Leonard Cohen  
  
Say a prayer for the cowgirl her horse ran away  
Shell walk til she finds him her darlin her stray  
But the rivers in flood and the roads are awash  
And the bridges break up in the panic of loss  
  
And theres nothin to follow nowhere to go  
Hes gone like the summer gone like the snow  
And the crickets are breaking her heart with their song  
As the day caves in and the night is all wrong  
  
Did she dream was it he who went galloping past  
And bent down the fern broke open the grass  
And printed the mud with the wellhammered shoe  
That she nailed to his speed in the dreams of her youth  
  
And although he goes grazin a minute away  
She tracks him all night she tracks him all day  
And shes blind to his presence except to compare  
Her injury here with his punishment there  
  
Then at home on a branch on a highest tree  
A songbird sings out so suddenly  
And the sun is warm and the soft winds ride  
On a willow tree by the riverside  
  
Ah the world is sweet and world is wide  
Hes there where the light and the darkness divide  
And the steams comin off him hes huge and hes shy  
And he steps on the moon when he paws at the sky  
  
And he comes to her hand but hes not really tame  
He longs to be lost she longs for the same  
And hell bolt and hell plunge thru the first open pass  
To roll and to feed in the sweet mountain grass  
  
Or hell make a break for the high plateau  
Where theres nothing above and nothing below  
Its time for their burden the whip and the spur  
Will she ride with him or will he ride with her  
  
So she binds herself to her galloping steed  
And he binds himself to the woman in need  
And there is no space just left and right  
And there is no time but there is day and night  
  
Then she leans on his neck and whispers low  
Whither thou goest I will go  
And they turn as one and they head for the plain  
No need for the whip or no need for the rein  
  
Now the clasp of this union who fastens it tight  
Who snaps it asunder the very next night  
Some say its him some say its her  
Some say loves like smoke beyond all repair  
  
So my darlin my darlin just let him go by  
That old silhouette on the great western sky  
And Ill pick out a tune and theyll move right along  
And theyre gone like smoke and theyre gone like this song  
  
Say a prayer for the cowgirl
