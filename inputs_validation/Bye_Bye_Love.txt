Chorus  
Bye bye love  
Bye bye happiness  
Hello loneliness  
I think Im gonna cry  
Bye bye love  
Bye bye sweet caress  
Hello emptiness  
I feel like I could die  
Bye bye my love goodbye  
  
There goes my baby  
With someone new  
She sure looks happy  
I sure am blue  
She was my baby  
Till he stepped in  
Goodbye to romance  
That might have been  
  
Chorus  
  
Im through with romance  
Im through with love  
Im through with counting  
The stars above  
And heres the reason  
That Im so free  
My loving baby  
Is through with me  
  
Chorus
