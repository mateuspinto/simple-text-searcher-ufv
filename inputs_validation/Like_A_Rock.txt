Stood there boldly  
Sweatin in the sun  
Felt like a million  
Felt like number one  
The height of summer  
Id never felt that strong  
Like a rock  
  
I was eighteen  
Didnt have a care  
Working for peanuts  
Not a dime to spare  
But I was lean and  
Solid everywhere  
Like a rock  
  
My hands were steady  
My eyes were clear and bright  
My walk had purpose  
My steps were quick and light  
And I held firmly  
To what I felt was right  
Like a rock  
  
Like a rock I was strong as I could be  
Like a rock nothin ever got to me  
Like a rock I was something to see  
Like a rock  
  
And I stood arrow straight  
Unencumbered by the weight  
Of all these hustlers and their schemes  
I stood proud I stood tall  
High above it all  
I still believed in my dreams  
  
Twenty years now  
Whered they go  
Twenty years  
I dont know  
I sit and I wonder sometimes  
Where theyve gone  
  
And sometimes late at night  
When Im bathed in the firelight  
The moon comes callin a ghostly white  
And I recall  
I recall  
  
Like a rock standin arrow straight  
Like a rock chargin from the gate  
Like a rock carryin the weight  
Like a rock  
  
Like a rock the sun upon my skin  
Like a rock hard against the wind  
Like a rock I see myself again  
Like a rock
