Tom johnston  
Its late at night  
Cant go to sleep  
Eyes open wide  
Doin the midnight creep  
Well its just a holiday  
For a circus dream  
cause Im a music man baby  
Hangin from a wire with no net below  
You know Im gonna catch you if you fall  
Swirling dancers  
Driftin in the night  
Make you go crazy  
Forget what is wrong and what is right  
cause the melody gonna make you high  
Float you away like a cloud in the sky  
And the music man with a song for you  
A sweet georgia minstrel who loves to sing the blues  
Get it  
Come and get it  
When you get back home to your flat in the city  
Notice that your neighbor has the radio on  
Out of nowhere you gonna hear a sound  
Movin through your head spinning round and round  
And the music man with a song for you  
A sweet georgia minstrel who loves to sing the blues  
Get it  
Come and get it
