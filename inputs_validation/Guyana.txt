We thank you for the cool aid reverend jim  
Were glad to leave behind their world of sin  
Our lifeless bodies fall on holy ground  
Rotting flesh a sacrificial mound  
  
Were you our God or a man in a play  
Who took our applause and forced us to stay  
Now all together we lived as we died  
On your command by your side  
  
Guyana in the cult of the damned  
Give us your word for the grand final stand  
Guyana in the cult of the damned  
Give us your word for the grand final stand  
  
In the cult of the damned we all worked the land  
Too afraid to look up we all feared his hand  
Hurry my children there isnt much time  
But well meet again on the other side  
Be good to the children and old people first  
Hand them a drink theyre dying of thirst  
  
Bigfoot bigfoot thrown in a well  
Pulled under water screaming like hell  
He told us life was just a hotel  
Time to check out when he rang the bell  
  
Mother mother
