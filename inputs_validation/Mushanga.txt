I cant forget you my little Mushanga I keep a place in my heart for you  
The days of waiting they keep getting longer and not a thing I can do  
I was a poet a magazine writer sent to report on political views  
It was by chance through a lens that I met you a Kingston girl with no shoes  
  
Chorus  
You were runnin down the road I was going your way  
You stopped and turned around and lent you my hand  
You smiled though you were suffering I didnt understand then  
  
You broke into my heart I saw your eyes and then I knew  
You broke into my heart like the wind and rain that followed you  
You broke into my heart had the Lord above forgotten you  
You broke in from the start and all my tears belong to you  
Mushanga oh Mushanga oh  
  
I sat and watched as she danced by the fires  
Through ancient songs did the tale unfold  
They sang of diamonds that came from their mountains  
And loss of lives mining white mans gold  
  
I had to leave and go back to Manhattan  
Where all my stories are bought and sold  
I know the city would surely be saddened if what I knew could be told  
  
Its been so long since I last heard your laughter  
So many letters and still no news  
I hope you find all the things that youre after  
You know my heart is with you  
  
Chorus  
  
Mushanga oh Mushanga oh  
Mushanga oh Mushanga oh  
Mushanga oh Mushanga oh
