Repeat x3  
Reap the wild wind  
  
A finger points to show a scene Take my hand Take my hand  
Another face where mine had been Take my hand Take my hand  
Another footstep where I once walked Take my hand  
Take it all  
  
Chorus  
You take my hand and give me your friendship  
Ill take my time and send you my slow reply  
Give me an inch and Ill make the best of it  
Take all you want and leave all the rest to die  
  
Reap the wild wind  
  
A footprint haunts an empty floor Take my hand Take my hand  
A fading coat that I once wore Take my hand Take my hand  
Oh desolation where I once lived  
I have seen in times gone by  
I have felt a different shadow on the wall  
A stranglehold on a certain feeling  
  
Chorus  
  
Repeat x2  
Reap the wild wind  
  
Chorus  
  
Reap the wild wind
