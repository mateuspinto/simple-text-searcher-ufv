Break it down again  
So those are my dreams  
and these are my eyes  
Stand tall like a man  
Headstrong like a horse  
When its all mixed up  
better break it down  
Oo oo Oo oo  
In the world of secrets  
In the world of sound  
Oo oo  
  
Its in the way youre always hiding from the light  
See for yourself you have been sitting on a time bomb  
No revolution maybe someone somewhere else  
could show you something new about you and your inner song  
  
And all the love and all the love in the world  
wont stop the rain from falling  
waste sleeping underground  
Break it down again  
I want to break it down  
Break it down again  
  
Break it down again  
So those are my schemes  
and these are my plans  
Hot tips for the boys  
Fresh news from the force  
When its all mixed up  
better break it down  
Oo oo Oo oo  
In the world of silence  
In the world of sound  
Oo oo  
  
No sleep for the dreaming say the architects fo life  
Big bouncing babies bread and butter can I have a slice  
They make no mention of the beauty of decay  
Blue yellow pink umbrella save it for a rainy day  
  
And all the love and all the love in the world  
wont stop the rain from falling  
waste sleeping underground  
Break it down again  
I want to break it down  
Break it down again  
  
Horsing around  
Pray to the power  
Play to the crowd  
with your big hit sound  
And they wont simmer  
wont simmer  
wont simmer down  
Play to the crowd  
Play to the crowd  
  
Its in the way youre always hiding from the light  
Last off to heaven just like moses on a motorbike  
No revolution maybe someone else somewhere else  
Could show you something new to help with the ups and downs  
  
Break it down again  
I want to break it down  
Break it down again  
Break it down again  
Break it down again  
Break it down again  
  
No more sleepy dreaming  
No more building up  
It is time to dissolve  
Break it down again  
No more sleepy dreaming
