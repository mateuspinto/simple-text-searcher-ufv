We both wake up staring at the sky  
Dont remember how we got here but we dont wonder why  
Right now we living life like theres no way we can die  
But we bout to do our thing they couldnt stop us if they try  
Keep the weapon for the haters if they try to blow our high  
How the fuck would they stop us if we by each others side  
We were meant to be together we get inside  
How the hell would they kill us when were feeling so alive  
  
Ooh girl I know you want a G  
Its kinda hard not to notice me  
Cause Im right here where you wanna be  
I can take you where you wanna go oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Baby I can give what you want and everything you need  
Put us both in a position where we can both succeed  
And if it takes a sacrifice I promise I will bleed  
All the blessings that I get I promise youll receive  
Fuck them other niggas all they do is deceive  
Let me take away your pain my job is to relieve  
  
Ooh girl I know you want a G  
Its kinda hard not to notice me  
Cause Im right here where you wanna be  
I can take you where you wanna go oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
