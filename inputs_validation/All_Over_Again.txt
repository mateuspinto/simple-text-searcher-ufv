Every time I look at you I fall in love all over again  
Every time I think of you it all begins all over again  
  
One little dream at night and I can dream all day  
It only takes a memory to thrill me  
One little kiss from you and I just fly away  
Pour me out your love until you fill me  
  
I wanna fall in love beginning from the start all over again  
Show me how you stole away my heart all over again  
  
One little dream at night and I can dream all day  
It only takes a memory to thrill me  
One little kiss from you and I just fly away  
Pour me out your love until you fill me  
  
I wanna fall in love beginning from the start all over again  
Show me how you stole away my heart all over again  
  
All over again all over again all over again all over again  
All over again
