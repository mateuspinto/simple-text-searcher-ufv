What would it take to push a man  
Far enough to put somethin material over a human life  
What would drive someone completely over the edge  
To do some shit like that the green and gold  
  
I done filled my lungs up  
With so much of this crack smoke  
My necks bloated my techs loaded  
Im flat broke and Im pissed off  
Mad at the world Ive had it with girls  
And Im frustrated ran to the bus stop  
Just made it and hopped on  
Ready to drop bombs on the first person who had a nice suit and a watch on  
I spot JOHN a white collar worker  
In clean cut walked up to em  
He was like what whatchu mean what you know what time it is man  
At your next stop gimme that Rolex watch with that diamond wrist band  
Got his green and his gold dashed it climbed in his van to steal it and seen  
A man holdin a nine and then  
Shot him from the bottom up  
Stole his keys put em inside the ignition and got em stuck  
Hopped out to flee on my feet  
Fucked around forgot that I left my ID on the seat
