You and I we are simple things  
Oh simple things we are  
Feel the sun and all the joy it brings  
To the simple things we are  
Water rushing from a spring  
Is the simple thing we are  
  
But any hour of any day there is wonder  
In all our striving and our courage and our thunder  
  
You and I we are simple things  
Oh simple things we are  
  
At any hour of any day there is wonder  
In all our skiving and our cowardice and our lying and our blunders  
  
You and I we are simple things  
Oh simple things we are  
  
Simple things we are
