I did my best to notice when the call came down the line  
Up to the platform of surrender I was brought but I was kind  
And sometimes I get nervous when I see an open door  
Close your eyes clear your heart Cut the cord  
  
Are we human or are we dancer  
My sign is vital my hands are cold  
And Im on my knees looking for the answer  
Are we human or are we dancer  
  
Pay my respects to grace and virtue send my condolences to good  
Give my regards to soul and romance they always did the best they could  
And so long to devotion you taught me everything I know  
Wave good bye wish me well you gotta let me go  
  
Are we human or are we dancer  
My sign is vital my hands are cold  
And Im on my knees looking for the answer  
Are we human or are we dancer  
  
Will your system be alright  
When you dream of home tonight  
There is no message were receiving  
Let me know is your heart still beating  
  
Are we human or are we dancer  
My sign is vital my hands are cold  
And Im on my knees looking for the answer  
Youve gotta let me know  
  
Are we human or are we dancer  
My sign is vital my hands are cold  
And Im on my knees looking for the answer  
Are we human Or are we dancer  
  
Are we human or are we dancer  
Are we human or are we dancer
