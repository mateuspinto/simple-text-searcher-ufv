Tell me my life is about to begin  
Tell me that I am a hero  
Promise me all of your violent dreams  
Light up your body with anger  
Now in this ugly world  
It is time to destroy all this evil  
Now when I give the word  
Get ready to fight for your freedom  
Now  
  
Stand up and fight for you know we are right  
We must strike at the lies  
That have spread like disease through our minds  
Soon well have power every soldier will rest  
And well spread out our kindness  
To all who our love now deserve  
Some of you are going to die   
Martyrs of course to the freedom that I shall provide  
  
Ill give you the names of those you must kill  
All must die with their children  
Carry their heads to the palace of old  
Hang them high let the blood flow  
Now in this ugly world  
Break all the chains around us  
Now the crusade has begun  
Give us a land fit for heroes  
Now  
  
Stand up and fight for you know we are right  
We must strike at the lies  
That have spread like disease through our minds  
Soon well have power every soldier will rest  
And well spread out our kindness  
To all who our love now deserve  
Some of you are going to die   
Martyrs of course to the freedom that I shall provide  
  
We are only wanting freedom  
We are only wanting freedom  
We are only wanting freedom  
We are only wanting freedom Freedom freedom freedom freedom  
We are only wanting freedom Things are getting out of control here today  
We are only wanting freedom OK men  fire over their heads  
We are only wanting freedom  
  
We have won
