The way I feel is the way I am  
I wish Id walked before I started to run to you  
Just to you  
  
What kind of people do you think we are  
Another joker whos a rock and roll star for you  
Just for you  
  
The faithful image of another man  
The endless ocean of emotion I swam for you  
Yeah for you  
  
The shot troopers laying down on the floor  
I wish theyd put an end to my running war with you  
Yeah with you  
  
Are you metal are you man  
Youve changed in life since you began  
Yeah began  
  
Ladies digging gold from you  
Will they still dig now youre through  
Yeah youre through  
  
You bought and sold me with your lying words  
The voices in the deck that you never heard came through  
Yeah came through  
  
Your folly finally got to spend with a gun  
A poisoned father who has poisoned his son thats you  
Yeah thats you  
  
I beg you please dont let it get any worse  
The anger I once had has turned to a curse on you  
Yeah curse you  
  
All of the promises that never came true  
Youre gonna get what is coming to you thats true  
Ah thats true  
  
Are you Satan are you man  
Youve changed in life since it began  
It began  
  
Vultures sucking gold from you  
Will they still suck now youre through  
  
Cats Rats  
  
The search is on so you just better run  
And find yourself another way  
Probably dead they dont feel a thing  
To keep them living for another day  
  
Rats Rat  
  
You are nonentity you have no destiny  
You are a victim of a thing unknown  
A mantle picture of a stolen soul  
A fornication of your golden throne  
  
A smiling face it means the world to me  
So tired of sadness and of misery  
  
My life it started some time ago  
Where it will end I dont know  
I thought I was so good  
I thought I was fine  
I feel my world is out of time  
  
But everything is gonna work out fine  
If it dont I think Ill lose my mind  
  
I know I know I know yeah yeah I know  
Listen to me while I sing this song  
You might just think the words are wrong  
Too many people advising me  
But they dont know what my eyes see  
  
But everything is gonna work out fine
