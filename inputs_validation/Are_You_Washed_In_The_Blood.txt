Have you been to Jesus for the cleansing power  
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb  
Are you fully trusting in His grace this hour  
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb  
  
Are you washed in the blood  
In the soul cleansing blood of the Lamb  
Are your garments spotless are they white as snow  
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb  
  
Are you walking daily by the Saviors side  
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb  
Do you rest each moment in the crucified  
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb  
  
Are your garments spotless are they white as snow  
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb
