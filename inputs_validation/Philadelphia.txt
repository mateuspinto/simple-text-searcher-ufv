Sometimes I think that I know  
What loves all about  
And when I see the light  
I know Ill be all right  
  
Ive got my friends in the world  
I had my friends  
When we were boys and girls  
And the secrets came unfurled  
  
City of brotherly love  
Place I call home  
Dont turn your back on me  
I dont want to be alone  
Love lasts forever  
  
Someone is talking to me  
Calling my name  
Tell me Im not to blame  
I wont be ashamed of love  
  
Philadelphia  
City of brotherly love  
Brotherly love  
  
Sometimes I think that I know  
What loves all about  
And when I see the light  
I know Ill be all right  
Philadelphia
