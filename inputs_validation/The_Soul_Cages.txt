The boy child is locked in the fishermans yard  
Theres a bloodless moon where the oceans die  
A shoal of nightstars hang fire in the nets  
And the chaos of cages where the crayfish lie  
  
Where is the fisherman where is the goat  
Where is the keeper in his carrion coat  
Eclipse on the moon when the dark bird flies  
Where is the child with his fathers eyes  
  
These are the soul cages  
These are the soul cages  
  
Hes the king of the ninth world  
The twisted son of the fog bells toll  
In each and every lobster cage  
A tortured human soul  
  
These are the souls of the broken factories  
The subject slaves of the broken crown  
The dead accounting of old guilty promises  
These are the souls of the broken town  
  
These are the soul cages  
These are the soul cages  
These are the soul cages  
These are the soul cages  
  
I have a wager the brave child spoke  
The fisherman laughed though disturbed at the joke  
You will drink what I drink but you must equal me  
And if the drink leaves me standing  
A soul shall go free  
  
I have here a cask of most magical wine  
A vintage that blessed every ship in the line  
Its wrung from the blood of the sailors who died  
Young white body adrift in the tide  
  
And whats in it for me my pretty young thing  
Why should I whistle when the caged bird sings  
If you lose a wager with the king of the sea  
Youll spend the rest of forever in the cage with me  
  
These are the soul cages  
These are the soul cages  
These are the soul cages  
These are the soul cages  
  
A body lies open in the fishermans yard  
Like the side of a ship where the iceberg rips  
One less soul in the soul cages  
One last curse on the fishermans lips  
  
These are the soul cages  
These are the soul cages  
These are the soul cages  
These are the soul cages  
  
Swim to the light  
Swim to the light  
  
He dreamed of the ship on the sea  
It would carry his father and he  
To a place they could never be found  
To a place far away from this town  
A Newcastle ship without coals  
They would sail to the island of souls
