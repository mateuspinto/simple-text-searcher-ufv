They say the neon lights are bright on Broadway  
They say theres always magic in the air  
But when youre walking down that street  
And you aint had enough to eat  
The glitter rubs right off and youre nowhere  
  
They say the girls are something else on Broadway  
But looking at them just gives me the blues  
Cause how ya gonna make some time  
When all you got is one thin dime  
And one thin dime wont even shine your shoes  
  
Ha They say that I wont last too long on Broadway  
Ill catch a Greyhound bus for home they all say  
But oh Theyre dead wrong I know they are  
Cause I can play this here guitar  
And I wont quit till Im a star on Broadway  
  
Oh theyre dead wrong I know they are  
Cause I can play this here guitar  
And I wont quit till Im a star on Broadway on Broadway  
On Broadway on Broadway
