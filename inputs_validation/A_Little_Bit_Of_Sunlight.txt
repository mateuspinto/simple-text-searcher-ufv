Tears would fall like the falling rain  
There would be a sea  
But you dont have to cry to prove your love  
Just believe in me  
  
Chorus  
Cause a little bit of sunlight is all that I want from you  
A little bit of sunlight  
Is all that I want  
All that I want  
All that I want from you  
  
A man who cant live with cloudy skies  
Should only wait and see  
  
Soon all the clouds will disappear  
And leave just you and me  
  
Chorus
