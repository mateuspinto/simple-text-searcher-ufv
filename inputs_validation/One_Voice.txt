In the garden of consciousness  
In fertile mind there lies the dormant seed  
When blooming as charity  
Conscience breathes a sigh of relief  
  
The confessions of sleep  
The awakening seed  
Moved by love to serve  
We celebrate all  
  
Merit in life  
Ah the confessions of sleep  
Unfolding peace  
As we extend  
  
According to need  
And you will hear the call  
All action great and small  
Received joyfully  
  
Heaven abounds  
Let love resound  
If he be mute  
Give him a bell  
  
If he be blind an eye  
It he be down a hand  
Lift up your voice  
Lift up your voice  
  
Lift up your voice  
Give of your mind one mind  
Give of your heart one heart  
Give of your voice  
  
One voice
