My life is a house  
You crawl through the window  
Slip across the floor and into the reception room  
You enter the place of endless persuasion  
Like a knock on the door  
When theres ten or more things to do  
Who is that calling  
You my companion  
Run to the water on a burning beach  
And it brings me relief  
Pass through the walls  
To find my intentions  
Circle round in a strange hypnotic state  
I look into space  
There is no connection  
A million points of light  
And a conversation I cant face  
Cast me off one day  
To lose my inhibitions  
Sit like a lap dog on a matrons knee  
Wear the nails on your feet  
I woke up the house  
Stumbled in sideways  
The lights went on and everybody screamed surprise  
The savage review  
It left me gasping  
But it warms my heart to see that you can do it too  
Total surrender  
Your touch is so tender  
Your skin is like water on a burning beach  
And it brings me relief
