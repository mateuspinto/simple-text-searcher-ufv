Secret bureaucracy its just a lie  
The devils henchmen in suit and tie  
A sacred brotherhood an ancient rite  
Politicians and the double lives they hide  
  
Violate your rights no more equality  
Surrender freedom your social security  
We the people face unconstitutional lies  
In greed we trust in revolution we die  
  
Our founding fathers are rolling in their graves  
The land of liberty needs a regime change  
Until you no longer know right from wrong  
The constitution isnt worth the paper its written on  
  
Violate your rights no more equality  
Surrender freedom your social security  
We the people face unconstitutional lies  
In greed we trust in revolution we die  
  
In revolution we die  
  
Screams from the future warn of calamity  
The coming plagues of the new disease  
The illuminati one world currency  
One world religion one world everything  
  
Violate your rights no more equality  
Surrender freedom your social security  
We the people face unconstitutional lies  
In greed we trust in revolution we die  
  
We the people face unconstitutional lies  
In greed we trust in revolution we die  
  
We the people face unconstitutional lies  
In greed we trust in revolution we die
