Ive seen you twice in a short time  
Only a week since we started  
It seems to me for every time  
Im getting more openhearted  
  
I was an impossible case  
Noone ever could reach me  
But I think I can see in your face  
Theres a lot you can teach me  
So I wanna know  
  
Whats the name of the game  
Does it mean anything to you  
Whats the name of the game  
Can you feel it the way I do  
Tell me please cause I have to know  
Im a bashful child beginning to grow  
  
And you make me talk  
And you make me feel  
And you make me show  
What Im trying to conceal  
If I trust in you would you let me down  
Would you laugh at me if I said I care for you  
Could you feel the same way too  
I wanna know  
  
The name of the game  
  
I have no friends noone to see  
And I am never invited  
Now I am here talking to you  
No wonder I get excited  
  
Your smile and the sound of your voice  
And the way you see through me  
Got a feeling you give me no choice  
But it means a lot to me  
So I wanna know  
  
Whats the name of the game Your smile and the sound of your voice  
Does it mean anything to you Got a feeling you give me no choice  
But it means a lot  
Whats the name of the game Your smile and the sound of your voice  
Can you feel it the way I do  
Tell me please cause I have to know  
Im a bashful child beginning to grow  
  
And you make me talk  
And you make me feel  
And you make me show  
What Im trying to conceal  
If I trust in you would you let me down  
Would you laugh at me if I said I care for you  
Could you feel the same way too  
I wanna know  
Oh yes I wanna know  
  
The name of the game I was an impossible case  
Does it mean anything to you But I think I can see in your face  
That it means a lot  
Whats the name of the game Your smile and the sound of your voice  
Can you feel it the way I do Got a feeling you give me no choice  
But it means a lot  
Whats the name of the game I was an impossible case  
Does it mean anything to you But I think I can see in your face  
That it means a lot
