Theres 104 days of summer vacation  
And school comes along just to end it  
So the annual problem for our generation  
Is finding a good way to spend it  
  
Like maybe  
Building a rocket  
Or fighting a mummy  
Or climbing up the Eiffel Tower  
  
Discovering something that doesnt exist Hey  
Or giving a monkey a shower  
  
Surfing tidal waves  
Creating nanobots  
Or locating Frankensteins brain Its over here  
  
Finding a dodo bird  
Painting a continent  
Or driving your sister insane Phineas  
  
As you can see  
Theres a whole lot of stuff to do  
Before school starts this fall Come on Perry  
  
So stick with us cause Phineas and Ferb  
Are gonna do it all  
So stick with us cause Phineas and Ferb are  
Gonna do it all  
Mom Phineas and Ferb are making a title sequence
