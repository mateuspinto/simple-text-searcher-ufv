I lit a thin green candle to make you jealous of me  
But the room just filled up with mosquitoes they heard that my body was free  
Then I took the dust of a long sleepless night and I put it in your little
shoe  
And then I confess that I tortured the dress that you wore for the world to
look through  
  
I showed my heart to the doctor He said Id just have to quit  
Then he wrote himself a prescription your name was mentioned in it  
Then he locked himself in a library shelf with the details of our honeymoon  
And I hear from the nurse that hes gotten much worse and his practice is all
in a ruin  
  
I heard of a saint who had loved you I studied all night in his school  
He taught that the duty of lovers is to tarnish the golden rule  
And just when I was sure that his teachings were pure he drowned himself in
the pool  
His body is gone but back here on the lawn his spirit continues to drool  
  
An Eskimo showed me a movie hed recently taken of you  
The poor man could hardly stop shivering his lips and his fingers were blue  
I suppose that he froze when the wind tore off your clothes  
And I guess he just never got warm but you stand there so nice in your
blizzard of ice  
Oh please let me come into the storm
