I never cared to know your name  
Roll out the red its all the same  
False idols scream for our love  
Compete for stage devote for name  
Its all pathetically the same  
Convinced of starlight beauty  
A must watch all tune in  
A celebration heartache  
Hail false heroes  
  
Surrender to our envy  
No boundaries left untouched  
No passion left for memories  
No passion for real memories  
  
Here we stand  
Lessened are the far and few who sustain  
Protect and nurture  
  
Who stands before us  
We lay our lives down for the star  
Who stands before us  
  
We speak  
We lay our lives down for the star  
Its all pathetically the same
