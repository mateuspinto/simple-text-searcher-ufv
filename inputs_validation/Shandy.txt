Shandy was somebodys daughter  
Driving to something insane  
They busted her crossing the border  
Quick as a sniff of cocaine  
All she could pay was attention  
So all they could take was her time  
Proving an ounce of possession  
Aint worth a piece of your mind  
  
Chorus  
cause nightmares are somebodys daydreams  
Daydreams are somebodys lies  
Lies aint no harder than telling the truth  
Truth is the perfect disguise  
  
Locked in the goldhandle bathroom  
Martin was changing his mind  
Shedding his humble pretensions  
One careful toke at a time  
And wiping the mask off the man in the mirror  
Who really was billy the kid  
Smiling at somebody dying  
For something that he never did  
  
Chorus  
cause nightmares are somebodys daydreams  
Daydreams are somebodys lies  
Lies aint no harder than telling the truth  
Truth is the perfect disguise  
  
As soon as he sat down beside her  
Shining like saturday night  
Shandy was his for the saving  
Sweet as she looked in the light  
And maybe they moved from the bar to the bedroom  
Maybe just stood there instead  
Martin woke up wet and screaming  
Dreaming of blood on the bed  
  
Chorus  
cause nightmares are somebodys daydreams  
Daydreams are somebodys lies  
Lies aint no harder than telling the truth  
Truth is the perfect disguise
