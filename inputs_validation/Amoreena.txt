Lately Ive been thinking how much I miss my lady  
Amoreenas in the cornfield brightening the daybreak  
Living like a lusty flower running through the grass for hours  
Rolling through the hay like a puppy child  
  
And when it rains the rain falls down  
Washing out the cattle town  
And shes far away somewhere in her eiderdown  
And she dreams of crystal streams  
Of days gone by when we would lean  
Laughing fit to burst upon each other  
  
I can see you sitting eating apples in the evening  
The fruit juice flowing slowly slowly slowly  
Down the bronze of your body  
Living like a lusty flower running through the grass for hours  
Rolling through the hay like a puppy child  
  
Oh if only I could nestle in the cradle of your cabin  
My arms around your shoulders the windows wide and open  
While the swallow and the sycamore are playing in the valley  
Oh I miss you Amoreena like a king bee misses honey  
  
Lately Ive been thinking how much I miss my lady  
Amoreenas in the cornfield brightening the daybreak  
Living like a lusty flower running through the grass for hours  
Rolling through the hay like a puppy child
