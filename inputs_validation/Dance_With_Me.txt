Underneath the foreign stars  
In a foreign place where they dont love you  
I do care  
In the pale moonlight  
Your eyes are wide  
And the band plays  
Everybody wants you  
  
And he takes your hand tenderly  
And he whispers  
Sweet surrender nothing  
How he feels about girls like you  
Your flip flop smiles  
And your big blue eyes  
On vacation  
  
Chorus  
Dance with me into the ocean  
Roll with me into the sea  
Dont tell me the world is in trouble  
  
Do you want to dance with me  
  
Go changes hands as the big waves  
Crash and dream dont die  
But I do  
Where were you when I needed you  
Right now  
The telephone just rings  
Im gonna find you  
  
Chorus  
  
Do you want to dance with me oh  
Do you want to dance with me  
  
Underneath the foreign sun  
With a foreign man who is gone and almost forgotten  
Take everything you see  
And remember us and wonder  
If you will be forgiven  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont tell me the world is in trouble  
  
Chorus  
  
Do you want to dance with me  
Do you want to dance with me oh  
Do you want to dance with me
