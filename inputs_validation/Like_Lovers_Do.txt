Take the line between us  
And hold it close to you  
I want us to get together  
Like lovers do  
  
Let me kiss away your troubles  
The cold and lonely nights  
Just take this heart Im giving  
And love is on the rise  
  
Like lovers do  
Want to hold you through the night  
Like lovers do  
And when I look into your eyes  
  
Like lovers do  
Oh Im drowning in an ocean of emotion  
It feels just like forever  
Since I made love to you  
  
September days of scarlet  
April morning dew  
So take the love between us  
And hold it close to you  
  
I want us to get together  
Like lovers do
