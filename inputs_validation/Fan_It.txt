If the suns too hot cool it if you can  
Better go out and get yourself a five cent fan  
And fan it fan it you gotta fan it and cool it  
Honey till the cows come home  
  
Just met myself a new girl and her name was Sue  
She said To make love to you honey tell you what to do  
You gotta fan it fan it you gotta fan it and cool it  
Honey till the cows come home  
  
My mammas in the kitchen I just heard that back door slam  
Come out of that kitchen honey quit scorching that ham  
And lets just fan it fan it you gotta fan it and cool it  
Honey till the cows come home  
  
Well I got six months in jail my back turned to the wall  
Fannin that thing was the cause of it all  
So fan it fan it gotta fan it and cool it  
Honey till the cows come home
