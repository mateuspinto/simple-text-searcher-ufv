My heart was broken my heart was broken  
Sorrow Sorrow Sorrow Sorrow  
My heart was broken my heart was broken  
  
You saw it  
You claimed it  
You touched it  
You saved it  
  
My tears are drying my tears are drying  
Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you  
My tears are drying my tears are drying  
  
Your beauty and kindness  
Made tears clear my blindness  
While Im worth my room on this earth  
I will be with you  
  
While the Chief puts Sunshine On Leith  
Ill thank him for his work  
And your birth and my birth
