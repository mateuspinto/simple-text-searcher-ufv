Hearts were exploding around us  
As we drifted south down the bay  
The gray up above and gray down below  
Left us with nothing to say  
So we drifted along in silence  
Till the tickle of life trickled in  
And the rhythm began in the hiss of the sand  
We were catching fire again  
  
Oh boatman I am the river  
I am the mountain and the sea  
Oh boatman taker and giver  
Can you deliver me  
I would forever run free  
  
Yeah we finally caught up with legends  
We were walking along side by side  
We worked out a plan to go out hand in hand  
The long trail just wasnt that wide  
The water around us was freezing  
We just laughed and threw ourselves in  
And although we were old  
The sting of that cold pumped up the feeling  
Here it is again  
  
Oh boatman I am the river  
I am the mountain and the sea  
Oh boatman taker and giver  
Can you deliver me  
I would forever run free  
  
Oh Im a message in a bottle  
Drifting along on a deep blue sea  
Waiting for some foreign shore  
Ready for something to be  
  
No longer afraid of falling  
We cut the strings to the sky  
We found lever ground  
And we put ourselves down  
Amazing we all didnt die  
We took each moment as given  
By second they came  
The ice and the sun  
And the thundering guns  
Good God I was finally sane  
  
Oh boatman I am the river  
I am the mountain and the sea  
Oh boatman taker and giver  
Can you deliver me  
Oh holy roller  
I am the river  
I am the mountain and the sea  
Oh boatman taker and giver  
Can you deliver me  
I would forever run free
