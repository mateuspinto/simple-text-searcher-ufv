When you look into my eyes theres nothing else to see  
Nothing but your own mistake stearing back at you  
  
I was best student in a class  
Now all giving me ass  
I just cannot hide sense of guilty  
But I will follow my illness  
To the possible lines  
Ill choose right decision  
And show to world that I am not guilty by association  
  
Go away you  
Go away you  
Go away you  
  
Just like a heroin Im falling apart  
Breaking my heart my angel left me  
  
Im too week to face me  
I never know why she only run so far away far away from me  
I never know why she always runs so far away far away  
  
Far away you  
Far away you  
Far away you  
  
Now you see Heroin is the reason reason reason  
I cant tell you how to make it go  
Now matter how I do how hard I try  
I shouted the outside  
  
Fear scary  
Fear scary  
Fear scary  
  
Repeats to the end of song
