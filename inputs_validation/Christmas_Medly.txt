Santa claus is coming to town 2x  
You better watch out  
You better not cry  
You better not pout  
Im telling you why  
Santa claus is coming to town 3x  
Hes making a list  
And checkin it twice  
Gonna find out whos naughty and nice  
Santa claus is coming to town 3x  
  
People making list  
Buying special gifts  
Taking time to be kind to one and all  
Its the time of year  
When good friends are dear  
And you wish you could give more than just presents from the store  
Why dont you give love on christmas day on christmas day  
Oh even the man who has everything  
Would be so happy if you would bring  
Give love on christmas day on christmas day  
No greater gift is there than love  
  
Someday at xmas  
Men wont boys playin with bombs like kids play with toys  
One warm december our heart will see  
A world where men are free  
Someday at xmas  
Therell be no wars when we have what xmas is for  
When we have found what lifes really worth  
Therell be peace on earth  
Someday at xmas  
Well see a land  
No hungry children no empty hand  
One happy morning People will share  
A world where people care  
  
I saw mommy kissing santa claus  
Underneath a mistle toe last night  
She didnt see me creep down the stairs to have a peep  
She tought that I was tucked up in my bedroom fast asleep  
Then I saw mommy tickle santa claus  
Underneath his beard so snowy white  
Oh what a laugh it would have been if daddy had only seen  
Mommy kissing santa claus last night  
  
Come they told me parapapampam rapapampam  
A new born king to see parapapampam rapapampam  
Our finest gifts to bring parapapampam rapapampam  
To lay before the king parapapampam rapapampam rapapampam  
Soul to honor him parapapampam rapapampam  
When we come when we come
