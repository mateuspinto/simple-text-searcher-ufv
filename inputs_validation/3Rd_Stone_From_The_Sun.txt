  
Star fleet to scout ship please give your position over  
I am in orbit around the third planet from the star called the sun over  
You mean its the earth over  
Positive it is know to have some form of intelligent species over  
I think we should take a look  
Strange beautiful grass of green  
With your majestic silken seas  
Your mysterious mountains  
I wish to see closer  
May I land my kinky machine  
Although your world wonders me  
With you majestic superior cackling hen  
Your people I do not understand  
So to you I wish to put and end  
And youll never hear surf music again
