I need perspective cause Im facing the wall  
I need perspective cause Im not that tall  
I need perspective heard the trumpet call  
Dont trust my eyes want to know where things fall  
  
I need perspective party time for the newly wed  
I need perspective colors ran as the images bled  
I need perspective like confetti on the flower bed  
Dont trust my eyes priest crying hes got fire in his head  
  
Oh Gaia if thats your name  
Treat you like dirt but I dont want to blame  
Oh Gaia the wind heats the fire and blows the ash away  
  
I need perspective sitting in a long long hall  
I need perspective staring at the white white wall  
I need perspective waiting for the phone to call  
Dont trust my eyes theres one thing Ive got to tell you all  
  
I need perspective to see through red red skies  
I need perspective to carry merchandise  
I need perspective I dont trust my eyes  
Dont trust my eyes and I dont like surprise  
  
Oh Gaia etc  
  
I used to be industrial giant  
sitting in a garden full of chemical plant  
trying very hard to get you off my mind  
acting like any man  
taking you for everything I can  
just the same the same as all my kind  
So blind  
  
I need perspective
