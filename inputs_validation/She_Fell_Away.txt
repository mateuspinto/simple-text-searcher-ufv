Once she lay open like a road  
Carbed apart the madness that I stumbled from  
But she fell away  
She fell away  
Shed me like a skin  
She fell away  
Left me holding everything  
Once the road lay open like a girl  
And we drank and laughed and threw the bottle over  
But she fell away  
She fell away  
I did not see the cracks form  
As I knelt to pray  
I did not see the crevice yawn no  
Sometimes  
At night I feel the end it is at hand  
My pistol going crazy in my hand  
For she fell away  
O she fell away  
Walked me th the brink  
The fell away  
I did not see her fall  
To better days  
Sometimes I wonder was she ever there at all  
She fell away  
She fell away  
She fell away
