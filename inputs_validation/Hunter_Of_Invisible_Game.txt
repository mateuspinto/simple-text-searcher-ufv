I hauled myself up out of a ditch  
I built me an ark out of gopher wood and pitch  
Sat down by the roadside and waited on the rain  
Honey Im the hunter of invisible game  
  
Well I woke last night to the heavy clicking and clack  
And a scarecrow on fire along the railroad tracks  
There were empty cities and burning plains  
Honey Im the hunter of invisible game  
  
We all come up a little short and we go down hard  
These days I spend my time skipping through the dark  
Through the empires of dust I chant your name  
Honey Im the hunter of invisible game  
  
Through the bone yard we rattled and black smoke we rolled on  
Down into the valley where the beast has his throne  
I sing my song and I sharpen my blade  
Honey Im the hunter of invisible game  
  
Strength is vanity and time is illusion  
I feel you breathing the rest is confusion  
Your skin touches mine what else to explain  
Honey Im the hunter of invisible game  
  
Now pray for yourself and that you may not fall  
When the hour of deliverance comes on us all  
When high hope and faith and courage and trust  
Can rise or vanish like dust and dust  
Now theres a kingdom of love waiting to be reclaimed  
Honey Im the hunter of the invisible game  
Honey Im the hunter of the invisible game  
Honey Im the hunter of the invisible game
