I go to work in a bubble  
I got everything I need  
I get so high on no trouble  
Its a great feeling being free  
I say a prayer at thanksgiving  
I bless the night and the day  
I look up to the sky with a smile on my face  
And I praise the lord of the new way  
The sweetest sound I ever knew  
Was the sound of reason falling  
Like the summer rain  
And the truth washed the pain away  
New way  
I dont watch tv anymore  
Dont need to see it now we all know the score  
And all the politicians know what theyre there for  
Its a new way  
New way
