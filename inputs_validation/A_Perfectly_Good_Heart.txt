Chorus  
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart  
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now  
Why would you wanna make the very first scar  
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart  
  
Maybe I shouldve seen the signs shouldve read the writing on the wall  
And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall  
No matter what you say I still cant believe  
That you would walk away  
It dont make sense to me but  
  
Chorus  
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart  
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now  
Why would you wanna make the very first scar  
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart  
  
Its not unbroken anymore  
How do I get it back the way it was before  
  
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart  
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now  
Why would you wanna make the very first scar  
Why would you wanna break would you wanna break a  
  
Chorus  
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart  
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now  
Why would you wanna make the very first scar  
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
