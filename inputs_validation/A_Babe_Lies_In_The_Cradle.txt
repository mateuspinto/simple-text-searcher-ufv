A babe lies in the cradle  
A little babe so dear  
With noble light he shineth  
As shines a mirror clear  
This little babe so dear  
  
The babe within the cradle  
Is Jesus Christ our Lord  
To us all peace and amity  
At this good time afford  
Thou Jesus Christ our Lord  
  
Whoso would rock the cradle  
Where lies the gentle child  
A lowly heart must lead him  
By passions undefiled  
As Mary pure and mild  
  
O Jesus babe beloved  
O Jesus babe divine  
How mighty is thy wondrous love  
Fill thou this heart of mine  
With that great love of thine
