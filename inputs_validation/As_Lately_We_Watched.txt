As lately we watchd oer our fields thro the night  
A star there was seen of such glorious light  
All thro the night angels did sing  
Carols so sweet of the birth of a King  
  
A King of such beauty was neer before seen  
And Mary His mother so like a queen  
Blessed be the hour welcome the morn  
For Christ our dear Saviour on earth now is born  
  
His throne is a manger His court is a loft  
But troops of bright angels in lays sweet and soft  
Him they proclaim our Christ by name  
And earth sky and air straight are filled with his fame  
  
Then shepherds be joyful
