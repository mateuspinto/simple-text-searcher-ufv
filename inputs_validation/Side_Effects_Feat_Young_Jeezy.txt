Young Jeezy  
Its MC and YJ  
Another hit okay  
We lookin fine  
Takin off  
Saw us on a runway  
On any given Sunday  
Monday Tuesday  
They try to confuse me  
I never let em use me  
  
Mariah Carey  
I was a girl  
You was a man  
I was too young  
To understand  
I was naive  
I just believed  
Everything  
That you told me  
Said you were strong  
Protecting me  
Then I found out  
That you were weak  
Keepin me there  
Under your thumb  
Cause you were scared  
That Id become much  
More than you could handle  
Shining like a chandelier  
That decorated  
Every room inside  
The private hell we built  
And I dealt with it  
Like a kid  
I wished  
I could fly away  
  
But instead  
I kept my tears inside  
Cause I knew if I started  
Id keep crying  
For the rest of my life  
With you  
I finally built up  
The strength to walk away  
Dont regret it  
But I still live  
With the side effects  
  
Wakin up  
Scared some nights  
Still dreaming bout  
The violent times  
Still little protective  
Bout the people  
That I let inside  
Still little defensive  
Thinkin folk be  
Tryna run my life  
Still little  
Depressed inside  
I fake a smile and deal  
With the side effects  
Oh oh  
Side effects  
Oh oh  
Side effects  
Oh oh  
Side effects  
Oh oh  
  
It didnt stop  
No one was there  
Couldnt be real  
Had to keep quiet  
Once in awhile  
Put up a fight  
Its just too much  
Night after night  
After awhile  
I would just lie  
You was dead wrong  
Said you was right  
Did what I could  
Just to survive  
Couldnt believe  
This was my life  
Flickering like a candle  
Do my best to handle  
Sleeping with the enemy  
Whether he was smothering  
Every last part of me  
So I broke away  
And finally found  
The strength to leave  
  
Still kept the tears inside  
Cause I knew if I started  
Id keep crying  
For the rest of my life  
With you  
I finally built up  
The strength to walk away  
Dont regret it  
But I still live  
With the side effects  
  
Wakin up  
Scared some nights  
Still dreaming  
Bout the violent times  
Still little protective  
Bout the people  
That I let inside  
Still little defensive  
Thinkin folk be  
Tryna run my life  
Still little  
Depressed inside  
I fake a smile and deal  
With the side effects  
Oh oh  
Side effects  
Oh oh  
Side effects  
Oh oh  
Side effects  
Oh oh

So we aint tryin  
To hang with yall

Forgive but I cant forget

Get the best of me  
  
Kept my tears inside

The strength to walk away  
Dont regret it
