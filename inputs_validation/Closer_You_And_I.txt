Closer you and I  
Gino Padilla  
  
Hey theres a look in your eyes  
Must be love at first sight  
You were just part of a dream  
Nothing more so it seemed  
But my love couldnt wait much longer  
Just cant forget the picture of your smile  
Cause everytime I close my eyes you come alive  
  
The closer I get to touching you  
The closer I get to loving you  
Give it a time just a little more time  
Well be together  
Every little smile that special smile  
The twinkle in your eye in a little while  
Give it a time just a little more time  
So we can get closer you and I  
  
Then could I love you more  
So much stronger than before  
Why does it seem like a dream  
So much more so it seems  
I guess I found my inspiration  
With just one smile you take my breath away  
So hold me close and say youll stay with me now  
  
The closer I get to touching you  
The closer I get to loving you  
Give it a time just a little more time  
Well be together  
Every little smile that special smile  
The twinkle in your eye in a little while  
Give it a time just a little more time  
So we can get closer you and I
