Celebrate grab a drink and put a blunt in the sky  
Worldwide nigga its 1999  
Shit out of control sign of the times  
I aint had this much fun since 79  
I was only eight then hadnt been to the pen  
Just a young nigga on the front of a swing  
Playing football up in Powly High  
Too young to ride but its still Eastside  
Homicides didnt happen much niggas wasnt rapping much  
Its 99 nigga shit I know you strapping up  
Hell motherfucking yeah nigga wanna see the end  
So next year we can do it all again  
Same dogg channel same dogg time  
Only the strong will survive in 99  
So much drama and delusion my conclusion is confusing  
Dripping on my memories twisted off my music  
Trying to make my people do things oh yeah we dos it we dos it  
Heres my number baby girl dont you lose it  
Its smoky in this motherfucker while we cruising  
And Eastside niggas is the shadiest shadiest  
But them Westside niggas is the craziest craziest  
Summertime on the grind baby let me shine let me shine  
Roll with this shit Im cold with this shit in my prime  
Nigga done time and I never dropped a motherfucking dime  
Be smart fresh start is all you need  
First thing first cause stop smoking cess weed  
You are what you smoke nigga stop hating  
Thats why you broke and thats why we celebrating  
But lifes so hard on a G thats what they all say  
But somehow someway better days ahead Freddys dead  
And Betty said Eddies a fed  
Sweaty in bed with a nine to his head  
And he fucking with this hoodrat that he met up in dance  
Betty getting mad cause Eddie wanna share  
But look at how you living for a minute then compare  
I love confetti I always stay ready  
Keep some killers by my side and some riders by the telli  
Im ready to do now who now you now  
Eddie wasnt ready when they drew that booyow  
Two down with just one gun  
My nigga and who said killin wasnt no fun  
I sit alone in the zone with a face of stone  
Live the life of Al Capone or Don Coroleone  
Tragically casualties and fatalities  
And all kinds of funny ass niggas coming after me  
My grand pappy once sat me on his lap and he said  
Sonny get your money fore you end up dead  
I never really understood what he said  
Until my motherfucking dogg took a slug in his head  
Cold way nigga gotta learn his lesson  
Slow down and go down shit you know now  
  
Be smart fresh start is all you need  
First things first cuz stop smokin cess weed  
You are what you smoke my nigga stop hating  
Thats why you broke and thats why we celebrating  
But lifes so hard on a G thats what they all say  
But somehow someway you got to make a better way  
  
Somehow someway  
You got to make a better way  
You got to make a better way  
You got to make a better way  
You got to make a better way  
You got to make a better way  
You got to make a better way  
You got to make a better way  
Yeah better days ahead  
Better days ahead  
Better days ahead  
Better days ahead  
  
Thats real  
I feel your pain nigga  
I used to be just like you nigga  
Before I got off in this rap shit  
Shit nigga did anything to get a dollar  
You know but one thing I never did do  
I aint never beg a nigga for nothing or ask a nigga for nothing  
I went out and got my own ya feel me  
So from me to you man to man  
Better days ahead my nigga  
Shit keep the faith and get your hustle on  
Cause Im a get mine regardless  
Nigga whether Im rapping or on the streets  
I gotta have it
