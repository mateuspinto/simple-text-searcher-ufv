Watching the sun  
Watching it come  
Watching it come up  
Over the rooftops  
  
Cloudy and warm  
Maybe a storm  
You can never quite tell  
From the morning  
  
And its going to be a day  
There is really no way to say no  
To the morning  
  
Yes its going to be a day  
There is really nothing left to  
Say but  
Come on morning  
  
Waiting for mail  
Maybe a tail  
From an old friend  
Or even a lover  
  
Sometimes theres none  
But we have fun  
Thinking of all  
Who might have written  
  
And maybe there are seasons  
And maybe they change  
And maybe to love  
Is not so strange  
  
The sounds of the day  
They hurry away  
Now they are gone  
Until tomorrow  
  
When day will break  
And you will wake  
And you will rake your hands  
Across your eyes and realize  
  
That its going to be a day  
There is really no way  
To say no to the morning  
  
Yes its going to be a day  
There is really nothing left to say but  
Come on morning
