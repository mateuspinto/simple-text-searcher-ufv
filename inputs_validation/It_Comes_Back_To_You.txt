4 am beside myself  
And what I think of mental health  
All the things that worry me  
All the things you dont believe  
Ive been told just what to do  
Where to look and point my view  
All the things that I could be  
I think I learnt in therapy  
  
Am I just a shadow you drew  
  
It comes back to you it comes back to you  
All the things that you had lost will find their way to you  
It comes back to you it comes back to you  
Looking back into the past and I can see it through  
  
It comes back to you  
It comes back to you  
It comes back to you  
It comes back to you  
  
Mocking birds and diamond rings  
Oh I have thought of greater things  
All the things that fly by me  
All the lives that I could lead  
Maybe I was born for that  
Or maybe I was first to last  
You could call it cowardess  
But leave me to my studied bliss  
Am I just a shadow you drew  
  
It comes back to you it comes back to you  
All the things that you had lost will find their way to you  
It comes back to you it comes back to you  
Looking back into the past and I can see it through  
  
It comes back to you  
It comes back to you  
It comes back to you  
It comes back to you
