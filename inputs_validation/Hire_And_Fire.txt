It was a night it was just another night  
She was sayin lots of nothing  
She was none too bright  
But youll listen much to anythin  
When anythins in sight wont ya  
  
Double back trouble like a temperance hall  
Shes dealin with the ceilin  
And the writings on the wall  
Then youre wishing it was over like an endless fall  
  
Its a lane side fight  
Oh no Another main line ride  
Oh no There aint a train in sight  
Oh no Settin my soul on fire  
Try her and buy her  
Hire and fire her  
Playin the game his latest flame  
  
Now its a fine line between passion and dread  
Foolin and a droolin  
Starts rulin your head  
To seduction destruction  
Were so easily lead  
  
And then the dawn the so impatient telephone  
The smell of disappointment  
Mirror wants to pick a bone  
Its a cup of cold coffee  
Like the taste of stale beer  
Lets get outta here  
  
Its a lane side fight  
Oh no Another main line ride  
Oh no There aint a train in sight  
Oh no Settin my soul on fire  
Try her and buy her  
Hire and fire her  
  
Carry the flame and make it last  
Carry the blame and kiss your ass goodbye
