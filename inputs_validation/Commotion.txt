Traffic in the city turns my head around  
No no no no no  
Backed up on the freeway backed up in the church  
Everywhere you look theres a frown frown  
  
Chorus  
Com commotion  
Git git git gone  
Com commotion  
Git git git gone  
  
People keep atalkin they dont say a word  
Jaw jaw jaw jaw jaw  
Talk up in the White House talk up to your door  
So much goin on I just cant hear  
  
Chorus  
  
Hurryin to get there so you save some time  
Run run run run run  
Rushin to the treadmill rushin to get home  
Worry bout the time you save save  
  
Chorus
