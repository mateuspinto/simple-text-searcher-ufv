Summer sitting out by the pool  
A ray of sunlight getting in my way  
Close your eyes and wish that it were cool  
Everyday  
  
And I wish it could be back the other way  
But whats dissolved aint coming back today  
Close your eyes and wish that it were  
Close your eyes and wish that it were  
  
Axilla axilla axilla axilla  
  
Never understood what my body was for  
Thats why I always leave it layin out on the floor  
The shape a curiosity  
Where different faces fit before  
  
And tracing my image in the sand  
To pass the time from slip to fall  
The line I trace begins to weave  
A tangled web from wall to wall
