He was working at the record shop  
I would kiss him in the parking lot  
Tasting like cigarettes and soda pop  
Seventeen  
He would tell me I was beautiful  
Sneaking in the neighbors swimming pool  
Yeah he taught me how to break the rules  
Seventeen  
  
Hey those days are long gone  
And when I hear this song it takes me back  
  
We were on top of the world  
Back when I was your girl  
We were living so wild and free  
Acting stupid for fun  
All we needed was love  
Thats the way its supposed to be  
Seventeen  
  
Stealing beers out of the trailer park  
Flicking lighters just to fight the dark  
My favorite place was sitting in his car  
Seventeen  
We laid a blanket on the roof top  
That time I knew I wouldnt make him stop  
The nights were cold but we kept em hot  
Seventeen  
  
Hey those days are long gone  
And when I hear this song it takes me back  
  
We were on top of the world  
Back when I was your girl  
We were living so wild and free  
Acting stupid for fun  
All we needed was love  
Thats the way its supposed to be  
  
We were running red lights  
We were going all night  
Didnt care about anything  
We were living our dream  
It was you and me  
And we were seventeen  
  
Oh oh oh oh  
Seventeen  
Seventeen  
  
I remember what it felt like  
Just a small town kind of life  
If I could only just go back in time  
Seventeen  
  
We were on top of the world  
Back when I was your girl  
We were living so wild and free  
Acting stupid for fun  
All we needed was love  
Thats the way its supposed to be  
  
We were running red lights  
We were going all night  
Didnt care about anything  
We were living our dream  
It was you and me  
And we were seventeen  
  
Seventeen  
Seventeen
