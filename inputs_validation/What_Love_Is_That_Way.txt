You come here lookin for sympathy  
Cause its not everything you thought it would be  
Dont waste your time  
You cant understand why it comes and goes  
The sudden storms the highs and lows  
So you stand here cryin  
Girl get in line  
  
What love is that way  
Youre waitin time pretending  
What love is that way  
When you walk through life expecting  
So much so soon  
Love can only hurt you  
What love is that way  
What love is ever that way  
  
The more you wish and the more you dream  
The more the reality never seems  
What it ought to be  
Its never perfect as when it begins  
Time always seems to put an end  
To the fantasy It seems to me  
  
What love is that way  
Youre waitin time pretending  
What love is that way  
When you walk through life expecting  
So much so soon  
Love can only hurt you  
What love is that way  
What love is ever that way  
  
So much so soon Love can only hurt you  
What love is that way  
What love is ever that way What love is that way
