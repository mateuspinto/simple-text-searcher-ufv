Your love is like liquid  
It fills me it chills me  
Cant hold it control it  
It runs from my touch  
  
It slips through my fingers  
The taste of it lingers  
Your love is like liquid  
I want it so much  
  
Chorus  
  
Liquid love  
Pouring down like rain  
Liquid love  
Let it wash all over me  
  
Your love is like liquid  
It drenches it quenches  
It drowns me surrounds me  
It lies on my skin  
  
It flows through my vains  
Just like warm summer rains  
Yes your love is like liquid  
I feel it within  
  
Chorus  
  
Chorus2  
  
Liquid love  
Flowing through my veins  
Liquid love  
  
Liquid love  
  
My heart was frozen  
Til you came and melted it  
Now my heart is molten  
Turned it into  
  
Chorus  
Chorus2  
Chorus  
Chorus2  
  
Liquid love  
Liquid love  
Flowing through my vains
