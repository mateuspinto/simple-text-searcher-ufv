A sense of doom the warning  
This is our Christ returning  
The tide of fear arising  
We light the candles to sing  
Lucifer rising  Rising  
Lucifer rising  Look into the light  
Lucifer rising  Rising  
Lucifer rising  
A sense of tread the danger  
We welcome the dark stranger  
To bring infernal glory  
Rewrite biblical stories  
A hopelessness foreboding  
Forgotten tales corroding  
The laughter turns to crying  
While Nazarene lies dying
