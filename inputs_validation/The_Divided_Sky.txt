Ahhh  
Divided sky the wind blows high  
  
The divided sky chant is part of an ancient ritual dating back to the  
PreWilson years of She purity in Gamehendge After listening to the  
Sacred sounds for a sloping lawn three chosen subjects eat a special  
Root collected at the base of the enormous mountain that rises in the  
Center of the forest The root is believed to contain the spirit of  
Icculus who lives at the top of the mountain After eating the root  
They venture into a vast field at sundown The field is deep green  
And stretches as far as the eye can see in all directions In the  
Center of the field stands an enormous black rhombus They climb the  
Rhombus and begin to sing paying homage to the gods of the night  
Sky
