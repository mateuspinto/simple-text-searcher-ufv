Goin home late last night  
Suddenly I got a fright  
Yeah I looked thought the window and surprised what I saw  
Fairy boots were dancin with a dwarf all right now  
  
Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me  
Yeah I saw it I saw it I tell you no lies  
Yeah Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me  
I saw it I saw it with my own two eyes well all right now  
  
So I went to the doctor see what he could give me  
He said Son son youve gone too far  
Cause smokin and trippin is all that you do
