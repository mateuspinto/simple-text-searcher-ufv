Tough times demand tough talk  
Demand tough hearts demand tough songs  
Demand   
  
We can rise and fall like empires  
Flow in and out like the tide  
Be vain and smart humble and dumb  
We can hit and miss like pride  
  
We can circle around like hurricanes  
Dance and dream like lovers  
Attack the day like birds of prey  
Or scavengers under cover  
  
Look in   
To the eye of the storm  
Look out   
For the force without form  
Look around   
At the sight and the sound  
Look in look out look around   
  
We can move with savage grace  
To the rhythms of the night  
Cool and remote like dancing girls  
In the heat of the beat and the lights  
  
We can wear the rose of romance  
An air of joie de vivre  
Tootender hearts upon our sleeves  
Or skin as thick as thieves  
  
Rising falling at force ten  
We twist the world and ride the wind  
  
Look in   
Look the storm in the eye  
Look out   
To the sea and the sky  
Look around   
At the sight and the sound  
Look in look out look around
