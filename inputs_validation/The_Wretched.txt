Just a reflection  
Just a glimpse  
Just a little reminder  
Of all the what abouts  
And all the might have  
Could have beens  
Another day  
Some other way  
But not another reason to continue  
And now youre one of us  
The wretched  
  
The hopes and prays  
The better days  
The far aways

Stuck in this hole with the shit and the piss  
And its hard to believe it could come down to this  
Back at the beginning  
Sinking  
Spinning  
  
And in the end  
We still pretend  
The time we spend  
Not knowing when  
Youre finally free  
And you could be  
But it didnt turn out the way you wanted it to  
It didnt turn out quite the way that you wanted it  
  
Now you know  
This is what it feels like  
Now you know  
This is what it feels like  
  
You can try to stop it but it keeps on coming  
You can try to stop it but
