Do I have to come right out  
And say it  
Tell you that you look so fine  
Do I have to come right out  
And ask you to be mine  
If it was a game I could play it  
Trying to make it  
But Im losing time  
I got to bring you in  
Youre overworking my mind  
  
Indecision is crowding me  
I have no room to spare  
And I cant believe she cared  
Like a dream she has taken me  
And now I dont know where  
And a part of me is scared  
The part of me I shared  
Once before  
  
Do I have to come right out  
And say it  
Tell you that you look so fine  
Do I have to come right out  
And ask you to be mine  
  
Indecision is crowding me  
I have no room to spare  
And I cant believe she cared  
Like a dream she has taken me  
And now I dont know where  
And a part of me is scared  
The part of me I shared  
Once before  
  
Do I have to come right out  
And say it girl  
Tell you that you look so fine  
Do I have to come right out  
And ask you to be mine  
If it was a game I could play it  
Trying to make it  
But Im losing time  
I got to bring you in  
Youre overworking my mind  
  
Do I have to come right out  
And say it girl  
Tell you that you look so fine
