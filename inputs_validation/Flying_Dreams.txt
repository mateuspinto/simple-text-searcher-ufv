Dream by night  
Wish by day  
Love begins this way  
Loving starts  
When open hearts  
Touch and stay  
Sleep for now  
Dreamings how  
Lovers lives are planned  
Future songs  
And flying dreams  
Hand in hand  
  
Love it seems  
Made flying dreams  
So hearts could soar  
Heaven sent  
These wings were meant  
To prove once more  
That love is the key  
Love is the key  
You and I  
Touch the sky  
The eagle and the dove  
Nightingales  
We keep our sails  
Filled with love  
And love it seems  
Made flying dreams  
To bring you home to me

Love it seems  
Made flying dreams  
So hearts could soar  
Heaven sent  
These wings were meant  
To prove once more  
That love is the key  
Love is the key  
  
  
You and I  
Touch the sky  
The eagle and the dove  
Nightingales  
We keep our sails  
Filled with love  
Ever strong  
Our future song  
To sing it must be free  
  
  
Evry part  
Is from the heart  
And love is still the key  
And love it seems  
Made flying dreams  
To bring you home  
To me
