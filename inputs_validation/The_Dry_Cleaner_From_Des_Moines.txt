Im down to a roll of dimes  
Im stalking the slot thats hot  
I keep hearing bells all around me  
Jingling in the lucky jackpots  
They keep you tantalized  
They keep you reaching for your wallet  
Here in fools paradise  
  
I talked to a cat from Des Moines  
He said he ran a cleaning plant  
That cat was clanking with coin  
Well he must have had a genie in a lamp  
Cause every time I dropped a dime I blew it  
He kept ringing bells  
Nothing to it  
  
He got three oranges  
Three lemons  
Three cherries  
Three plums  
Im losing my taste for fruit  
Watching the dry cleaner do it  
Like Midas in a polyester suit  
Its all luck  
Its just luck  
You get a little lucky and you make a little money  
  
I followed him down the strip  
He picked out a booth at Circus Circus  
Where the cowgirls fill the room  
With their big balloons  
The Cleaner was pitching with purpose  
He had Dinos and Pooh Bears  
And lions pink and blue there  
He couldnt lose there  
  
Des Moines was stacking the chips  
Raking off the tables  
Ringing the bandits bells  
This is a story thats a drag to tell  
In some ways  
Since I lost every dime  
I laid on the line  
But the cleaner from Des Moines  
Could put a coin  
In the door of a John  
And get twenty for one  
Its just luck
