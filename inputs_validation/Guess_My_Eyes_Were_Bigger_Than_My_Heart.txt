Guess My Eyes Were Bigger Than My Heart  
I saw her and told myself  
She was my dream come true  
I let my eyes deceive me  
  
From the start  
They told me I wanted her  
More than I wanted you  
Guess my eyes were bigger  
Than my heart  
  
Chorus  
Wasnt I the foolish one  
Lord above what have I done  
For her love I tore my world apart  
Now shes here but its no good  
I dont care the way I should  
Guess my eyes were bigger than my heart  
  
I allowed these eyes of mine  
To lead me into sin  
Made me think that I could love her true  
Now she stands out in the cold  
  
My heart wont let her in  
There was only room enough for you  
  
Chorus
