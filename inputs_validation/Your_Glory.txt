Break of day  
Your light it shines on us  
And Your Glory fills this place  
Like the sun it rises up on us  
Its the Glory of Your face  
  
And I lift my eyes to Heaven  
And I lift my eyes to Heaven  
  
Your Glory  
The whole earth is filled with Your Glory  
The nations cry out they sing  
Holy holy is the Lord  
  
Your Glory  
Jesus one touch of your glory  
I lift up my hands and sing  
Holy holy is the lord  
  
Show me Your Glory  
Show me Your Glory  
Show me Your Glory
