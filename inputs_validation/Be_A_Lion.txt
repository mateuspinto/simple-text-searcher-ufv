There is a place well go  
Where there is mostly quiet  
Flowers and butterflies  
A rainbow lives beside it  
  
And from a velvet sky  
A summer storm  
You can feel the coolness in the air  
But youre still warm  
  
And then a mighty roar  
Will start the sky to cryin  
But not even lightning  
Will be frightening my lion  
  
And with no fear inside  
No need to run  
No need to hide  
Youre standing strong and tall  
Youre the bravest of them all  
  
If on courage you must call  
Then just keep on tryin  
And tryin and tryin  
Youre a lion  
In your own way be a lion  
  
Come on be a lion  
  
I am standing strong and tall  
Youre the bravest of them all  
If on courage you must call  
Keep on tryin  
And tryin and tryin  
Im a lion  
In my own way  
Im a lion  
A lion  
A lion  
A lion
