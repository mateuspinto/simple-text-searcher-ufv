Well I wish there was someone  
Well I wish there was someone  
To love me  
  
When I used to be someone  
And I knew there was someone  
That loved me  
  
As I sit here frozen alone  
Even ghosts get tired and go home  
As they crawl back under the stars  
  
And I wish there was something  
Please tell me theres something better  
And I wish there was something more than this  
Saturated loneliness  
  
And I wish I could feel it  
And I wish I could steal it  
Abduct it corrupt it but I never can  
Its just saturated loneliness  
  
Does the silence get lonely  
Does the silence get lonely  
Who knows  
Ive been hearing it tell me  
Ive been hearing it tell me  
Go home  
  
Cause the freaks are playing tonight  
They packed up and turned out the lights  
  
And I wish there was something  
Please tell me theres something better  
And I wish there was something more than this  
Saturated loneliness  
  
And I wish I could feel it  
And I wish I could steal it  
Abduct it corrupt it but I never can  
Its just saturated loneliness  
  
And the bath waters cold  
And this lifes getting old  
  
And I wish I could feel it  
And I wish I could feel it  
And I wish I could steal it  
Abduct it corrupt it  
  
And I wish I could feel it  
And I wish I could steal it  
And I wish I could feel it  
Abduct it corrupt it  
But I never can  
  
I never can  
  
Never can never can never can
