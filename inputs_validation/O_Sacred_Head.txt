O sacred head now wounded  
With grief and shame way down  
Now scornfully surrounded  
With thorns thine only crown  
  
How art thou pale with anguish  
With sore abuse and scorn  
How does that visage languish  
Which once was bright as morn  
  
What language shall i borrow  
To thank thee dearest man  
For this thy dying sorrow  
Thy pity without end  
  
O make me thine forever  
And should i fainting be  
Lord let me never ever  
Outlive my love to thee
