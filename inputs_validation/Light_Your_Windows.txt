Hold on girl now dont be blue  
Dry those tears for me and you  
Cant you see our love is true when you remember  
To do just what you say youll do cant you see I live for you  
And I need you to trust me too open your eyes  
So the sun can shine lights in you will light on your windows  
And change all your baby blues to golden sparks that light your eyes  
When you finally realize that your fears were all just lies  
So open those eyes and let the sun shine lights in you  
Light on your windows and take all your baby blues
