Verse  
My cold heart needs some company  
Shine a light in there maybe I can see  
Wild hostiles on an open frame  
Sun shining when it could be rain  
  
Chorus  
Give me all that I ask some Californian grass  
Bring it over to me I want everything that I see  
We can stop at a grocery store  
Buy a thing for a few dollars more  
  
Verse  
My hand it shakes my pulse is high  
And my complications I cant describe  
Cause your cold heart will break one day  
So dont you throw this chance away  
  
Chorus  
Give me all that I ask some Californian grass  
Bring it over to me I want everything that I see  
We can stop at a grocery store  
Buy a thing for a few dollars more  
  
Sun shining when it could be rain
