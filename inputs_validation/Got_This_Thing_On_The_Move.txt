Got This Thing On The Move  
  
Come on over to my side its where you want to be  
Come on over to joy ride and let your morals be  
Aint no way to deny it if its in your soul  
You dont know till you try it baby let the good times roll  
  
Let me taste your life Let me fill your stream  
Let me make you feel it right now just lay back and dream  
Got this thing on the move its beginin  
Got a strange kind of feeling under my skin  
  
I hear my baby knockin at my front door  
She knows what I got she wants some more  
And when its all over I start to come down  
Think of the restin place Ill leave the ground
