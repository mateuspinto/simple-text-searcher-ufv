I call your name but youre not there  
Was I to blame for being unfair  
Oh I cant sleep at night  
Since youve been gone  
I never weep at night  
I cant go on  
  
Dont you know I cant take it  
I dont know who can  
Im not goin to mayayake it  
Im not that kind of man  
  
Oh I cant sleep at night  
But just the same  
I never weep at night  
I call your name  
Aww  
  
Dont you know I cant take it  
I dont know who can  
Im not goin to mayayake it  
Im not that kind of man  
  
Oh I cant sleep at night  
But just the same  
I never weep at night  
I call your name  
I call your name  
I call your name  
I call your name
