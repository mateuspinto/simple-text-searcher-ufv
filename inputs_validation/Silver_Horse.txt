When I come in my dream to a house Ive never seen before  
I have a tendency to look for the exit door  
Cause I never know it may be that house again  
I never know I never know  
  
When I come in my mind to a stream thats running gently  
I have a tendency to run like a frightened deer  
Cause I never know it may take me to that ocean again  
I never know I never know  
  
I usually stay away from being carried away  
But one day I saw a silver horse  
I though he might take me to that somewhere high  
I thought he might take me to that deep blue sky  
  
I came to realize that the horse had no wings  
No wings well it wasnt so bad you know  
  
I learnt to travel the world around  
And run on the ground in the morning  
And thats the story of a wandering soul  
A story of a dreamer
