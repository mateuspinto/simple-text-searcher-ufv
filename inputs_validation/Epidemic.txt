Breeding fast in poverty  
Infectious driving dormant seed  
Inside your carcass start to mate  
Left in charge to dominate  
Waiting to unfold  
Raging uncontrolled  
Adapt a potency  
Death machine infest my corpse to be  
  
Unyielding kings of agony  
Test your body chemistry  
Pulmonary overthrow  
Possession of your inner throne  
Invasions quickly override malicious domineering strike  
Flood your veins commit slow death  
Deteriorate your makers met  
  
Perpetual demise  
On a fast decline  
Killing tendency  
Epidemic permanent disease  
  
Incapacitate fall into your fate  
Pain results in screams bleed internally  
Years will pass before it can be cured
