Somebody somewhere  
Dont know what hes missin tonight  
It must have all started with that darnd old Late Show  
It made me so lonely and sad  
And to make it all better I kept getting bluer  
With each little drink that I had  
So I tuned in a dj  
Who played every sad song he owned  
Lord I need someone so but everyone I know  
Is away bein needed at home  
Somebody somewhere  
Dont know what hes missin tonight  
Lord here sits a woman  
Just lonesome enough to be right  
For love em or leave em  
How I need someone to hold tight  
Somebody somewhere  
Dont know what hes missin tonight
