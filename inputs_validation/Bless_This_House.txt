Bless this house O Lord we pray  
Make it safe by night and day     
Bless these walls so firm and stout  
Keeping want and trouble out     
Bless the roof and chimneys tall  
Let thy peace lie overall     
Bless this door that it may prove  
Ever open  
To joy and love     
Bless these windows shining bright  
Letting in Gods Heavenly light  
Bless the hearth ablazing there  
With smoke ascending like a prayer  
Bless the people here within  
Keep them pure and free from sin     
Bless us all that we may be  
Fit O Lord to dwell with thee     
Bless us all that one day we may dwell  
O Lord With Thee
