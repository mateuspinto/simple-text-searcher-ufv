I dont care what these commentators say  
I swear I dont care  
For what difference do they make  
I go where I go and I get there fast  
Dont stop me  
I know that its not gonna last  
Forever forever  
Saturday night Saturday night  
Forever forever  
Saturday night Saturday night  
If you see someone gorgeous  
Then you think am I in with a chance  
Should I try  
Buy a rink  
Or maybe its too much  
Like hard work tonight  
But if they look my way  
I might alright  
Forever forever  
Saturday night Saturday night  
Forever forever  
Saturday night Saturday night  
I go where I go and I get there fast  
Dont stop me  
I know that its not gonna last  
Forever forever  
Saturday night Saturday night  
Forever forever  
Saturday night Saturday night
