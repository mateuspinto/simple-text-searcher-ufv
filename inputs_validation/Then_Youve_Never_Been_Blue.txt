If you never had to count  
A million cheap  
Then youve never been blue  
Never been blue  
If youve never had to cry  
Yourself to sleep  
Then youve never been blue  
Never been blue  
I know I could go on laughing at trouble  
Plain trouble  
But when it concerns my heart  
The pain seems double  
Oh no one ever knows what I go through  
While someone at home is babying you  
If you never had to miss a good night kiss  
Then youve never no youve never been blue
