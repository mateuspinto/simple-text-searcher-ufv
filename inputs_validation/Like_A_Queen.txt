  
  
In a town far from the city  
Was a girl just a child  
She grew up to a beautiful dream  
  
And she walked like a queen  
When she walked down the street  
All the men turned around  
To see her high heels  
  
She walked like a queen  
When she walked down the street  
All the men turn around  
To see her go on  
  
Jealousy wasnt a stranger  
Everywhere she would be  
So she cried for someone to help  
  
I want to know is anybody gonna help me when Im down  
I want to know will anybody really help me when Im down  
  
She walks like a queen  
When she walks down the street  
All the men turn around  
To see her high heels  
She walks like a queen  
When she walks down that street  
All the men turn around  
To see her high heels  
  
I want to know is   
I want to know will   
  
She walks like   
  
And at last a fire was burning  
As a man held her hand  
And held her warm
