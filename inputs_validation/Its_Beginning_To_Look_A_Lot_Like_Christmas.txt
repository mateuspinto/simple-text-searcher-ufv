Its beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
Evrywhere you go  
Take a look in the five and ten glistening once again  
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow  
  
Its beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
Toys in evry store  
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be  
On your own front door  
  
A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots  
Is the wish of Barney and Ben  
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk  
Is the hope of Janice and Jen  
  
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again  
  
Its beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
Evrywhere you go  
Theres a tree in the Grand Hotel one in the park as well  
The sturdy kind that doesnt mind the snow  
  
Its beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
Soon the bells will start  
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing  
Right within your heart  
  
Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again  
  
Its beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
Toys in evry store  
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be  
On your own front door on your own front door  
  
Its beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
Its beginning
