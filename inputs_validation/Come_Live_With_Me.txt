Come live with me and be my love  
Share my bread and wine  
Be a part of me the heart of me  
Be mine  
Come live with me and be my love  
Let our dreams combine  
Be wife to me be life to me  
Be mine  
With these hands I will build a roof  
To shield your head  
And with these hands I will carve the wood  
For our babys bed  
Come live with me and be my love  
And let me love you all the time  
Be mate to me be fate to me  
Be mine  
I will try to do my best for you  
I swear I promise you  
I will cry for you I will comfort you  
My whole life through  
Come live with me and be my love  
Share my bread and wine  
Be a part of me be the heart of me  
Be mine
