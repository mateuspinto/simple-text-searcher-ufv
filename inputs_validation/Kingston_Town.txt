The night seems to fade  
But the moonlight lingers on  
There are wonders for everyone  
The stars shine so bright  
But theyre fading after dawn  
There is magic in Kingston Town  
  
Chorus  
Oh Kingston Town  
The place I long to be  
If I had the whole world  
I would give it away  
Just to see the girls at play  
Ooh ooh ooh  
  
And when I am king  
Surely I would need a queen  
And a palace and everything yeah  
And now I am king  
And my queen will come at dawn  
Shell be waiting in Kingston Town  
  
Chorus  
  
And when I am king  
Surely I would need a queen  
And a palace and everything yeah  
And now I am king  
And my queen will come at dawn  
Shell be waiting in Kingston Town
