While the music played you worked by candlelight  
Those San Francisco nights  
You were the best in town  
Just by chance you crossed the diamond with the pearl  
  
You turned it on the world  
Thats when you turned the world around  
Did you feel like Jesus  
Did you realize  
  
That you were a champion in their eyes  
On the hill the stuff was laced with kerosene  
But yours was kitchen clean  
Everyone stopped to stare at your technicolor motor home  
  
Every AFrame had your number on the wall  
You must have had it all  
Youd go to LA on a dare  
And youd go it alone  
  
Could you live forever  
Could you see the day  
Could you feel your whole world fall apart and fade away  
  
Chorus  
Get along get along Kid Charlemagne  
Get along Kid Charlemagne  
  
Now your patrons have all left you in the red  
Your low rent friends are dead  
This life can be very strange  
All those dayglow freaks who used to paint the face  
  
Theyve joined the human race  
Some things will never change  
Son you were mistaken  
You are obsolete  
Look at all the white men on the street  
  
Chorus  
  
Clean this mess up else well all end up in jail  
Those test tubes and the scale  
Just get them all out of here  
Is there gas in the car  
  
Yes theres gas in the car  
I think the people down the hall  
Know who you are  
  
Careful what you carry  
Cause the man is wise  
You are still an outlaw in their eyes  
  
Chorus
