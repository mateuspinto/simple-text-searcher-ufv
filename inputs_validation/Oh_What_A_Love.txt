Oh what a love thatll bind the wounds of a loss and heal my heart  
Oh what a love to cast away the pain  
Oh what a love thatll bear for me the cost of a brand new start  
Oh what a love to let me begin again  
Oh what a life thatll brighten up the corners of a lonely life  
Oh what a life to cast away the rain  
Oh what a life to remove the gloom I face in the dark alone  
Oh what a life I believe I can see again  
I remember the day  
We walked on the beach till sunset then we sang  
And the songs we played were a promise of love thatll last beyond the grave  
Oh what a song learned from the sea taught slowly to the young  
Oh what a song to cast away the rain  
Oh what a song to break the bonds of fear and still the sound  
Oh what a song I believe I can sing again  
I remember the day we met at a place of hope I took what you gave  
And the words wed say were a promise of love thatll honor beyond the grave  
Chorus
