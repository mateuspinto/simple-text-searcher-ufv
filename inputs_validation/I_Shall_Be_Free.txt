Well I took me a woman late last night  
Is threefourths drunk she looked uptight  
She took off her wheel took off her bell  
Took off her wig said How do I smell  
I hotfooted it barenaked  
Out the window  
  
Well sometimes I might get drunk  
Walk like a duck and stomp like a skunk  
Dont hurt me none dont hurt my pride  
Cause I got my little lady right by my side  
Right there  
Proud as can be  
  
Is out there paintin on the old woodshed  
When a can a black paint it fell on my head  
I went down to scrub and rub  
But I had to sit in back of the tub  
Cost a quarter  
And I had to get out quick  
Someone wanted to come in and take a sauna  
  
Well my telephone rang it would not stop  
Its President Kennedy callin me up  
He said My friend Bob what do we need to make the country grow  
I said My friend John Brigitte Bardot  
Anita Ekberg  
Sophia Loren  
Put em all in the same room with Ernest Borgnine  
  
Well I got a woman sleeps on a cot  
She yells and hollers and squeals a lot  
Licks my face and tickles my ear  
Bends me over and buys me beer  
Shes a honeymooner  
A June crooner  
A spoon feeder  
And a natural leader  
  
Oh there aint no use in me workin so heavy  
I got a woman who works on the levee  
Pumping that water up to her neck  
Every week she sends me a monthly check  
Shes a humdinger  
Folk singer  
Dead ringer  
For a thingamuh jigger  
  
Late one day in the middle of the week  
Eyes were closed I was half asleep  
I chased me a woman up the hill  
Right in the middle of an air raid drill  
It was Little Bo Peep  
I jumped a fallout shelter  
I jumped a bean stalk  
I jumped a Ferris wheel  
  
Now the man on the stand he wants my vote  
Hes arunnin for office on the ballot note  
Hes out there preachin in front of the steeple  
Tellin me he loves all kindsa people  
Hes eatin bagels  
Hes eatin pizza  
Hes eatin chitlins  
Hes eatin bullshit  
  
Oh set me down on a television floor  
Ill flip the channel to number four  
Out of the shower comes a grownup man  
With a bottle of hair oil in his hand  
Its that greasy kid stuff  
What I want to know Mr Football Man is  
What do you do about Willy Mays and Yul Brynner  
Charles de Gaulle  
And Robert Louis Stevenson  
  
Well the funniest woman I ever seen  
Was the greatgranddaughter of Mr Clean  
She takes about fifteen baths a day  
Wants me to grow a cigar on my face  
Shes a little bit heavy  
  
Well ask me why Im drunk alla time  
It levels my head and eases my mind  
I just walk along and stroll and sing  
I see better days and I do better things  
I catch dinosaurs  
I make love to Elizabeth Taylor  
Catch hell from Richard Burton
