Ladies and gents  
Turn up this sound system  
To the sound of Carlos Santana  
And the GMBs  
Ghetto blues from the refugee camp  
  
Oh Maria Maria  
She reminds me of a westside story  
Growing up in Spanish Harlem  
Shes livin her life just like a movie star  
Oh Maria Maria  
She fell in love in East LA  
To the sounds of the guitar  
Played by Carlos Santan  
  
Stop the looting stop the shooting  
Pick pocking on the corner  
See as the rich is getting richer  
The poor is getting poorer  
Se mira Maria on the corner  
Thinkin of ways to make it better  
In my mailbox theres an eviction letter  
Somebody just said see you later  
  
Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola  
Ahora vengo mama chola East coast  
Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola  
Ahora vengo mama chola West coast  
  
Oh Maria Maria  
She reminds me of a westside story  
Growing up in Spanish Harlem  
Shes livin her life just like a movie star  
Oh Maria Maria  
She fell in love in East LA  
To the sounds of the guitar  
Played by Carlos Santan  
  
I said a la favella los colores  
The streets are getting hotter  
There is no water  
To put out the fire  
Mi canto la esperanza  
Se mira Maria on the corner  
Thinkin of ways to make it better  
Then I looked up in the sky  
Hoping of days of paradise  
  
Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola  
Ahora vengo mama chola North side  
Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola  
Ahora vengo mama chola South side  
Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola  
Ahora vengo mama chola World wide  
Ahora vengo mama chola mama chola  
Ahora vengo mama chola Open up your eyes  
  
Maria you know your my lover  
When the wind blows I can feel you through the weather  
And even when we are apart  
It feels like we are together  
Maria yeah  
  
She reminds me of a westside story  
Growing up in Spanish Harlem  
Shes livin her life just like a movie star  
Oh Maria Maria  
She fell in love in East LA  
To the sounds of the guitar  
Played by Carlos Santana
