Speak softly closely love  
Warm breath stirs will for life  
Of any tremblin dove  
Wounded by word or knife  
  
A kiss on closed eyes  
I forever will see  
Kiss them now  
Comfort me  
Oh oh oh  
  
Walk ever quietly dear  
Dont wake the sleeping dog  
He makes disquieting fear  
He rests beyond the fog  
  
Sweet balm of dark  
Lie here tenderly  
Cover all  
Comfort me  
Oh oh oh  
  
Bathe me in clouds my love  
Clean crust of tiresome day  
Drink cool and blue my love  
Dont let us float away  
  
Lighter than air the body must be  
Dance with grace  
Comfort me  
Oh oh oh  
  
Speak softly closely love  
Warm breath stirs will for life  
Of any tremblin dove  
Wounded by word or knife  
  
A kiss on closed eyes  
I forever will see  
Kiss them now  
Comfort me  
Me  
Comfort me
