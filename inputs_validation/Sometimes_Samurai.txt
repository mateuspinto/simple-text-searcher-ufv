Sometime Samurai  
  
Man of the moment possibly all time  
Sing to me your lullabyyyy  
Sometime Samurai  
Sometime Samurai  
Sometime Samurai  
Sometime Samurai sometime  
Sometime Samurai sing to me yeah  
  
Mmm Mmm my ocean and swimming at high tide  
Softly you protect me tender touch of you  
Floating in your shadow  
Im like a leaf up on the water  
Cradled by your greatness  
Safe now in your arms  
  
Ooo Mmm Mmm in my treetop im wearing such a smile  
Cooly you caress me  
I purr next to you  
Longing for nothing but more of this  
You are my dreamtime  
Wisely when you guide me  
Lovely in your lights  
  
Mmm im feeling just a little dizzy  
Do you think i can sit down for a while  
  
Man of the moment possibly all time  
Sing to me your lullabyyyy  
Sometime Samurai  
  
Sometime Samurai
