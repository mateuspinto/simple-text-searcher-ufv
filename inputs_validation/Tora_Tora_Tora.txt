They were raining from the sky  
Exploding in my heart  
Is this a love in disguise  
Or just a form of modern art  
  
From the skies you could almost hear them cry  
Tora Tora Tora  
In the town they were going down  
Tora Tora Tora  
  
I had a nightmare only yesterday  
You played a skeleton  
You took my love then died that day  
I played an American  
  
From the skies you can almost hear them cry  
Tora Tora Tora  
In the town they were going down  
Tora Tora Tora  
  
I played an American
