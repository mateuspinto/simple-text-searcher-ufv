Im alone sitting with my broken glass  
My four walls follow me through my past  
I was on a Paris train  
I emerged in London rain  
And you waiting there swimming through apologies  
  
I remember searching for the perfect words  
I was hoping you might change your mind  
I remember the soldier standing next to me  
Riding on the Metro  
  
I was smiling as you took my hand  
Saw the mood we spoke in France  
You were passed as shallow word  
It isnt passed theres still a hurt  
You were passed as shallow word  
It isnt passed theres still a hurt  
I can see you now smiling as I pulled away  
Sorry  
  
I remember the letter wrinkled in my hand  
Ill love you always filled my eyes  
I remember the night we walked along the Seine  
Riding on the Metro  
  
I remember a feeling coming over me  
The soldier turned then walked away  
Fuck you for loving me  
Riding on the Metro
