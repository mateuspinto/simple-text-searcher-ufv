I have got a secret hidden behind my eyes  
A violation tragedy of violence hate and lies  
Locked deep within a chamber dark reccesses of my mind  
A tribute to insanity through hours days and time  
  
Rotten to the core  
  
Recite the testimonial truth and nothing more  
Accusations nominal fall rotten to the core  
So take a look read a book reach a new plateau  
But stain the soul a life you took  
you know not what I know  
  
Rotten to the core  
  
Misguided youth the bitter truth  
Nothing left to chance  
Fallen angel seeking adventure new romance  
How dare you touch you take the soul  
Of one so pure so white  
The violation tragedy  
Took all she had that night  
  
Rotten to the core  
  
I have got a secret hidden behind my eyes  
A violation tragedy of violence hate and lies  
Recite the testimonial truth and nothing more  
Accusations nominal fall rotten to the core  
  
Rotten to the core  
To the core  
  
Rot rot rot rot rot  
Rot rot rot rot rotten rotten rot  
To the core
