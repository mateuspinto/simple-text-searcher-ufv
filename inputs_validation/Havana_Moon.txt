Havana moon Havana moon  
Me all alone with jug of rum  
Me stand and wait for boat to come  
Its long the night its quiet the dock  
The boat she late since 12 oclock  
Me watch the tide easin in  
Is low the moon but high the wind  
  
Havana moon Havana moon  
Me all alone me open the rum  
Its long the wait for boat to come  
American girl come back to me  
Well sail away across the sea  
Well dock in New York the buildings high  
Well find a home up in the sky  
  
Havana moon Havana moon  
Me still alone me sip on the rum  
Me wonder where the boat she come  
To bring me love ow Sweet little thing  
She rock and roll she dance and sing  
She hold me tight she touch me lips  
Me eyes they close me heart she flip  
  
Havana moon Havana moon  
But still alone me drinkin the rum  
Begin to think the boat no come  
American girl she tell a lie  
She say till then she mean goodbye  
  
Havana moon Havana moon  
Me lay down alone was good the rum  
Me fall asleep the boat she come  
The girl she look till come the dawn  
She weep and cry Return for home  
The whistle blow me open me eyes  
Was bright the sun was blue the sky  
Me grab me shoes me jump and run  
Me see the boat head for horizon  
Havana moon is gone the rum  
The boat she sail me love she gone  
Havana moon Havana moon
