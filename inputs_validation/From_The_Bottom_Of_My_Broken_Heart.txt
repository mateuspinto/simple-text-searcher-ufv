Never look back we said  
How was I to know Id miss you so  
Loneliness up ahead emptiness behind  
Where do I go  
  
And you didnt hear  
All my joy through my tears  
All my hopes through my fears  
Did you now still I miss you somehow  
  
From the bottom of my broken heart  
Theres just a thing or two Id like you to know  
You were my first love  
You were my true love  
From the first kisses to the very last rose  
From the bottom of my broken heart  
Even though time may find me somebody new  
You were my real love I never knew love  
Til there was you  
From the bottom of my broken heart  
  
Baby I said  
Please stay Give our love a chance for one more day  
We could have worked things out  
Taking time is what loves all about  
  
But you put a dart through my dreams  
Through my heart  
And Im back where I started again  
Never thought it would end  
  
From the bottom of my broken heart  
Theres just a thing or two Id like you to know  
You were my first love  
You were my true love  
From the first kisses to the very last rose  
From the bottom of my broken heart  
Even though time may find me somebody new  
You were my real love I never knew love  
Til there was you  
From the bottom of my broken heart  
  
You promised yourself  
But to somebody else  
And you made it so perfectly clear  
Still I wish you were here now  
  
From the bottom of my broken heart  
Theres just a thing or two Id like you to know  
You were my first love  
You were my true love  
From the first kisses to the very last rose  
  
From the bottom of my broken heart  
Even though time may find me somebody new  
You were my real love I never knew love  
Til there was you  
From the bottom of my broken heart  
  
Never look back we said  
How was I to know Id miss you so
