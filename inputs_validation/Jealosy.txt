Jealousy night and day you torture me  
I sometimes wonder if this spell that Im under  
Can only be a melody for I know no one but me  
Has won your heart but when the music starts  
My peace departs  
From the moment they play that lovely strain  
And we surrender to all its charm again  
This jealousy that tortures me is ecstasy mystery pain  
We dance to a tango of love  
Your heart beats with mine as we sway  
Your eyes give the answer Im dreaming of  
That soft word your cruel lips will never say  
Well I fear that the music will end  
And shatter the spell it may lend  
To make me believe when your eyes just deceive  
Its only a tango you love  
I fear that the music will end  
And shatter the spell it may lend  
To make me believe when your eyes just deceive  
Its only a tango you love  
Its only a tango that you love
