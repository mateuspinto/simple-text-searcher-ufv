Bucklebees riding Scout

Hello my name is Somanatin  
I cant get out of here  
I need my story told  
I cant get out of here  
The pixie has blown her fairy dust  
I cant get out of here  
And everything turns to gold

The owls search for Samone  
He snatches the sleeping boots from beneath the bed  
Thinking it was his own
