They took me down the grading station  
And they classified me zed  
Cause of over population  
They told me that I would soon be dead  
  
But I slipped out of the force field  
And hid beneath the monorail  
But the automatic blood hounds  
Lord theyre soon hot along my trail  
  
Now if I had been a scholar  
With computer working hard  
Then my molecular structure  
Would not be on the graders card  
  
So I know that they will get me  
Put my index in the brain  
Then the atoms of my body  
Will be disposed of Lordy down the drain  
  
They took me down the grading station  
And they classified me zed  
Cause of over population  
They told me that I would soon be dead
