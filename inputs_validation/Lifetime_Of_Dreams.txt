From the first day  
I envisioned myself with you  
Its so hard to wait  
But with you it was easy  
To do  
Somewhere in time  
I knew I would find you here with every  
Passing moment  
I see forever so clear  
Part of me was lost without you  
You are where I found my faith  
Feels like love is here to stay  
  
Chorus  
When I look in your eyes baby  
I see a lifetime of dreams come true  
And I want you to say that you feel the same  
Way too  
The stars in your eyes tell me  
All my tomorrows will wait for you  
Youre all of my prayers answered  
My one saving grace is you  
  
In another life I believed that I loved you then  
If lightning strikes twice we are destined  
Together again  
We dont have to make a promise we were  
Always meant to be  
Its written in the way you look at me I see  
  
Chorus  
  
Love moves at the speed of light  
Takes years to get it right  
But weve got till the end of time  
I can see I can see You and me forever  
Youre the one woman that can make me stay  
My one and only saving grace  
  
Chorus  
  
I can see I can see  
You and me forever  
I can see I can see  
You and me forever
