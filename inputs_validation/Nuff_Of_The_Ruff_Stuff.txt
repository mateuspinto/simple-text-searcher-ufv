Get funky with it  
I told you before you burn when you play with fire  
So take off your hats matter of fact hail the new Sire  
Youre hungry as hell so im cookin up the chowder  
Its laced with ingredients gon come on like gunpowder  
Pompom lick a shot then I got to order  
Im runnin for the border for causin disorder  
Pompom lick a shot got on my defenses  
Im runnin for the fences of course Im relentless  
The particular name of this queen is Latifah  
Ive often been classified as a feminine teacher  
Collectively capture the heart of a nation  
Love my culture and show appreciation  
Youre lookin for the black influ  
I do want too give it to you  
What are you mad  
Give me some of what you had  
You can huffhuff puffpuff and bluffbluff  
But I got nuff of the ruff stuff  
  
Ruff and tuff  
And all that stuff  
  
Now nuff of the ruff stuff thats what I do and I do it well  
The proof is in the puddin I show and prove not show and tell  
Talk tales you get caught up in a crossfire  
Buckshot must be what you want and desire  
I write concepts I dont be frontin or be buggin  
I solely write the rhymes for the beats that you be lovin  
Its a love thang the Queen doin her thang  
If I was a liquid you would drink me like Tanq  
You think Im kickin things that I myself dont even heed  
I rap not for the love of music but for greed  
Latifahs booty yo she could never succeed  
Shiiit  
You watch me do it and boom it the Flavor Unit will snap necks  
You afi listen a likkle you fi go buy the cassette  
Youre starvin cause you aint had enough  
Thats right nuff of the ruff stuff  
  
Ruff and tuff  
And all that stuff  
  
You talk about flavor  
I got enough flavor to make a grapefruit sweet  
Get old ladies jumpin out of their seats  
Change a peach to a pear to a plum with a little sun n rays  
I got flavor for days  
Now Im the type that the fellas call a honey and  
From me you know you get a worth for your money and  
This is no meaningless attack I gave you a chance  
Matter of fact yo I ordered them to dance  
For me they tried to turn me inside out  
They felt the wrath of my madness I let them come into my house  
Its called latifahs law for the criminal to curse  
And all the gentlemen know its rule ladies first  
Not the typical female that tends to  
Fall vitim to the evil that men do  
Small puff I call your bluff  
Im not mad I just had enuff of the ruff stuff  
  
Ruff and tuff  
And all that stuff  
  
Everybody know Latifah love positivity  
Now positivity erase negativity  
Mi comin inna di dance   
Me rollin with the Flavor Unit posse  
As a black woman mi want equality  
Equality and di freedom to be me  
Mi have a mother Rita only call her Mommy  
Likkle brother and sister Angelo and Kelly  
A brother in them laws but mi call him Winki  
Lost mi daddy and  family  
 black  black country  
Believe in one God one tribe one destiny  
Cease
