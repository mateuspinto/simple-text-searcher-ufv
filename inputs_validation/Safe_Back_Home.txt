I put on her colors with honor  
And carried them over the sea  
To battle at the mouth of the devils tunnels  
Are you safe back home praying for me  
And do you still use the same words you taught me  
That you learned at the Dear Saviors knee  
On that sweet morning there in the garden  
And are you safe back home praying for me  
  
How long how long  
How long how long  
Will the words of this prayer be my hope  
If it be His will and Im the leopard that will  
Well say Amen together I know  
  
On patrol in the cold of this desert  
I trembled as I waited for my relief  
And I picture a circle of family  
Are you safe back home praying for me  
  
Chorus  
  
How long how long  
How long how long  
How long how long  
How long how long  
How long how long  
How long
