It was christmastime in washington  
The democrats rehearsed  
Gettin into gear for four more years  
Of things not gettin worse  
  
The republicans drank whiskey neat  
And they thanked their lucky stars  
They said he can not seek another term  
Theyll be no more F D Are S  
  
I sat home in tennessee  
Just starin at the screen  
An uneasy feelin in my chest  
Just wonderin what it means  
  
So come back woody guthrie  
Come back to us now  
Tear your eyes from paradise  
And rise again somehow  
If you run into jesus  
Maybe he can help us out  
Come back woody guthrie  
To us now  
  
I followed in your footsteps once  
Back in my travelin days  
Somewhere I failed to find your trail  
Now Im stumblin through the haze  
  
Theres killers on the highway now  
And a man cant get around  
So I just sold my soul for wheels that roll  
Now Im stuck here in this town  
  
So come back woody guthrie  
Come back to us now  
Tear your eyes from paradise  
And rise again somehow  
If you run into jesus  
Maybe he can help us out  
Come back woody guthrie  
To us now  
  
See theres foxes in the henhouse  
And theres cows out in the corn  
The unions have been busted  
And their proud red banners torn  
  
But if you listen to the radio  
Theyll tell you all is well  
But you and me and cisco know  
Its goin straight to hell  
  
So come back emma goldman  
Rise up old joe hill  
The barricades are goin up  
They cannot break our will  
Come back to us malcolm x  
And martin luther king  
Were marchin into selma  
While the bells of freedom ring  
  
And come back woody guthrie  
Come back to us now  
Tear your eyes from paradise  
And rise again somehow
