My My Time flies One step and were on the moon next step into the stars  
My My Time flies Maybe we could be there soon a one way ticket to mars  
  
My My Time flies A man underneath a tree an apple falls on his head  
My my time flies a man wrote a symphony its 1812  
  
My My Time flies Four guys across abbey road one forgot to wear shoes  
My My Time flies A rap on a rhapsody a king whos still in the news a
king to sing you the blues  
  
My My Time flies A man in a winter sleigh white white white as the snow  
My My Time flies A new day is on its way so lets let yesterday go  
Could be we step out again  
Could be tomorrow but then  
Could be 2010
