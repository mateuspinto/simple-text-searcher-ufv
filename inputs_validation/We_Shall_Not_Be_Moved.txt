We shall not be moved  
We shall not be moved  
Just like a tree standing by the water side  
Oh we shall not be moved  
  
Well I said we shall not be moved  
Well I said we shall not be moved  
  
Just like a tree standing by the water side  
Oh we shall not be moved  
  
We shall not be moved  
We shall not be moved  
We shall not be moved  
We shall not be moved  
  
Just like a tree standing by the water side  
Oh we shall not be moved  
  
Goodnight
