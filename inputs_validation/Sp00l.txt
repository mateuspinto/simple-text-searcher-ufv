Turn another turn  
  
Turn another turn sp00l  
  
I think therefore I am familiar to most  
How long did we eat the seed planted by our host  
4 billion years between our ears  
Still hatred brings us many tears  
Still we judge each other  
Why when were only looking for the same high  
  
Grind time for old misconceptions  
Roll out new scenery as per suggestion  
Wont salute you wont desert you  
Wont be a prisoner of assumption anymore  
  
Does language define us is reality words  
How far do we appear to be  
Is the measure of scope but  
With our junkie soul we face the need  
Of natures planned dependency  
Dont hold contempt for ecstasy  
Just mourn the dead on the national screen  
Mourn the dead on the screen mourn the dead  
On the screen mourn the dead while they scream  
  
Grind time for old misconceptions  
Roll out new scenery as per suggestion  
Wont salute you wont desert you  
  
Sp00l  
Turn another turn  
Turn another turn  
Sp00l  
Turn another turn  
  
Dont need persuading by the status quo  
  
We can make changes  
If we open up well see the history they sell us  
Holds the structure firm reinforce the mold  
We need to strip it all away  
And let the sp00l turn turn  
Another turn  
Another turn  
Watch it turn watch it turn what well learn  
  
Grind time for old misconceptions  
Roll out new scenery as per suggestion  
Wont salute you wont desert you  
  
Sp00l  
Turn another turn  
Turn another turn  
Sp00l  
Turn another turn  
  
Push away what theyre selling me  
Realize what we need to be  
Focus on a strategy to  
Open up our minds and then  
Together turn another turn
