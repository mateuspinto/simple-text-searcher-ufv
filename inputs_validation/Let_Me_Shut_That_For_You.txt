Here come Mr I aint like that Mr You can count on me  
Here come evolution walkin with stupidity  
  
Waste a time waste a my time  
Give it up lay it down play the bottom line  
Waste a time waste a prime time  
Hey Let me shut that for you  
  
There go noone get over me Mr Not behind your back  
Muthafucka got a larger than life full a shit short a fact  
  
Theres a kind of hush all over the world tonight  
All over the world you can hear the sound  
Know what I mean  
  
Sit down and shut up  
Sit the fuck down and shut the fuck up  
  
Stoop muthafucka gettin under my skin  
Runnin away with that mouth again  
Ah ah ah got nothin better to do

Waste a time waste a my time  
Give it up lay it down play the bottom line  
Waste a time waste a prime time  
Hey Shut the fuck up
