What a friend we have in Jesus  
All our sins and grieves to bear  
What a privilege to carry  
Everything to God in prayer  
Oh what peace we often forfeit  
Oh what needless pain we bear  
All because we do not carry  
Everything to God in prayer  
Have we trials and temptations  
Is there trouble anywhere  
We should never be discouraged  
Take it to the Lord in prayer  
Can we find a friend so faithful  
Who will all our sorrow share  
Jesus knows our every weakness  
So take it to the Lord in prayer  
Oh what peace we often forfeit  
Oh what needless pain we bear  
All because we do not carry  
Everything to God in prayer  
Everything to God in prayer
