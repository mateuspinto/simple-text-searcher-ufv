She never really had a chance  
On that fateful moonlit night  
Sacrificed without a fight  
A victim of a circumstance  
  
Now that Ive become aware  
And Ive exposed this tragedy  
A sadness grows inside of me  
It all seems so unfair  
  
Im learning all about my life  
By looking through her eyes  
  
Just beyond the churchyard gates  
Where the grass is overgrown  
I saw the writing on her stone  
I felt like I would suffocate  
  
In loving memory of our child  
So innocent eyes open wide  
I felt so empty as I cried  
Like part of me had died  
  
Im learning all about my life  
By looking through her eyes  
  
And as her image  
Wandered through my head  
I wept just like a baby  
As I lay awake in bed  
  
And I know what its like  
To lose someone you love  
And this felt just the same  
  
She wasnt given any choice  
Desperation stole her voice  
Ive been given so much more in life  
Ive got a son Ive got a wife  
  
I had to suffer one last time  
To grieve for her and say goodbye  
Relive the anguish of my past  
To find out who I was at last  
  
The door has opened wide  
Im turning with the tide  
Looking through her eyes
