Leading us on to the land of Eternity  
Riding the cold cold winds of Valhalla  
  
The Kingdom of Odin is the Kingdom of Gods  
Where only souls of the brave may rest in peace  
But someone among them had the skill of deceit  
And raised the hand that would open the road to Hell  
  
Chorus  
When the winds of Valhalla run cold  
Be sure that the blood will start to flow  
When the winds of Valhalla run cold  
Valhalla  
  
The ring has been broken and a soul must be saved  
Among the bravest of men who rides to Hell  
The long ships are sailing and the chariots ride  
And yes the anger of Thor will serve you well  
  
Chorus  
  
Raise your hands  
Reach and Valhalla will save your soul  
Raise your eyes  
And Odin will lead us on  
  
They say that history repeats itself  
Upon the year of the seventh Century  
Well nobody knows no you never can tell  
So youd better run now and hide away  
  
Chorus
