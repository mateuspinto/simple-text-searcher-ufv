It begins to tell  
round midnight midnight  
I do pretty well till after sundown  
Suppertime Im feelin sad  
But it really gets bad  
round midnight  
  
Memories always start round midnight  
Havent got the heart to stand those memories  
When my heart is still with you  
And ol midnight knows it too  
  
When a quarrel we had needs mending  
Does it mean that our love is ending  
Darlin I need you lately I find  
Youre out of my heart  
And Im out of my mind  
  
Let our hearts take wings  
round midnight midnight  
Let the angels sing  
For your returning  
  
Till our love is safe and sound  
And old midnight comes around  
Feelin sad  
Really gets bad  
Round  
Round  
Round  
Mid  
Night
