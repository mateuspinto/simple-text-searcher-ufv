When he was young youd not find him doing well in school  
His mind would turn unto the waters  
Always the focus of adolescent ridicule  
He has no time for farmers daughters  
Alienated from the clique society  
A lonely boy finds peace in fishing  
His mother says John this is not the way lifes supposed to be  
Dont you see the life that you are missing  
And he says  
When I grow up I want to be  
One of the harvesters of the sea  
I think before my days are done  
I want to be a fisherman  
Now years gone by we find man that rules the sea  
He sets out on a dark May morning   
To bring his catch back to this small community  
He doesnt see the danger dawning  
Four hours up oh the ocean swelled and swelled  
The fog rolled in it started raining  
The starboard bow Oh my God were going down  
They do not hear his frantic mayday  
And he says  
When I grow up I want to be  
One of the harvesters of the sea  
I think before my days are done  
I want to be a fisherman  
Ill live and die a fisherman  
Calling John the fisherman
