You pull me down  
To the floor  
Of our apartment  
  
A little while later  
We are laughing  
At our carpet burns  
  
I like the way  
That it glows outside  
As the room gets darker  
  
How I wish we could  
Stay like this  
While the rest of the world turns  
  
There has never been a time  
When I didnt want to be your boyfriend  
There has never been a time  
When I didnt want to know your name  
  
Free falling from a work in progress  
Free falling from a life on hold  
There has never been a time  
When I didnt want you  
  
Chorus  
My good lover  
Is my one good thing these days  
You help me keep it all  
From slipping away  
I swear Im gonna marry you someday  
Someday  
  
I am all alone  
And it seems like  
All I do is wait  
Yes we spend hours on the phone  
But its never the same  
  
No nothing good ever does easy  
Nothing good ever comes without a fight  
  
I am all alone  
And I wish I was home  
With you tonight  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah my girlfriend is like  
Magic in the hand  
When I lose my sparkle  
Shes the only one  
That understands  
  
I know Im going to marry you someday Repeat x2  
Yeah I swear Im going to marry you someday  
Yeah yeah I swear Im going to marry you  
Someday Repeat x3
