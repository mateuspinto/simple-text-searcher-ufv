Listen my teachers  
Listen my preachers  
Let the world know he broke out  
Mankind has failed just to see  
What was inevitably  
Satan has taken  
And hidden painstakin  
One of the seven of fate  
Out of the sea he has buried it  
Under the mountain of greed  
  
Stone by stone  
You must carry off  
stone by stone  
On and on  
until the final blinding light shows its too late  
Too late  
  
There is a chance for everyone  
Needs time but can be done  
Fight the darkness  
Dont be afraid my friends  
The last key you have to find  
And so will save mankind  
Keep on trying when I give away  
  
My life for one more day  
My life for one more day  
My life for hours you must find the way  
My life for one more day  
  
You who will find it  
You who will bind it  
And throw it back into the sea  
Will be successor and follower  
Of all my unowned might  
  
Reckon with treason  
For just one reason  
Reckon with envy and hate  
Too many people will always belive  
In the sermont of night  
  
Stone by stone  
You must carry off  
stone by stone  
On and on  
until the final blinding light shows its too late  
Too late  
  
There is a chance for everyone  
Needs time but can be done  
Fight the darkness  
Dont be afraid my friends  
The last key you have to find  
And so will save mankind  
Keep on trying when I give away  
  
My life for one more day  
My life for one more day  
My life for hours you must find the way  
My life for one more day  
  
Now I must leave  
Now I must leave  
Banish the evil  
Trust and believe  
Trust that you need  
Nothing but love  
  
There is a chance for everyone  
Needs time but can be done  
Fight the darkness  
Dont be afraid my friends  
The last key you have to find  
And so will save mankind  
Keep on trying when I give away  
  
My life for one more day  
My life for one more day  
My life for hours you must find the way  
My life for one more day
