Every Sunday I will go down to the bar  
And leave him the guitar  
  
You say you want me  
I want another  
Say you dream of me  
Dream of your brother  
Oh the stars shine so suspiciously  
For we three  
  
You said when you were with me that nothing made you high  
We drank all night together and you began to cry so recklessly  
Baby please dont take my hope away from me  
  
You say you want me  
I want another baby  
You say you wish for me  
Wish for your brother  
Oh the dice roll so deceptively  
For we three  
  
It was just another Saturday  
And evrything was in the key of A  
And I lit a cigarette for your brother  
And he turned and heard me say so desprately  
Baby please dont take my hope away from me  
  
You say you want me  
I want another  
You say you pray for me  
Pray for your brother  
Oh the way that I see him is the way I see myself  
So please stand back now and let time tell you  
Oh cant you see that time is the key that will unlock the destiny  
Of we three  
  
Every night on seprate stars before we go to sleep we pray so breathlessly  
Baby please dont take my hope away from me
