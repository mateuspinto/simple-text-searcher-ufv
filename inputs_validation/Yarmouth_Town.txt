In Yarmouth town there lived a man  
He had a little tavern by the strand  
And the landlord had a daughter fair  
Pretty little thing with golden hair  
  
Chorus  
Wont you come down  
Wont you come down  
Wont you come down to Yarmouth town  
  
One night there came a sailor man  
He asked the daughter for her hand  
Well I wont marry you she said  
I have all I want without being wed  
  
But if with me youd like to linger  
Ill tie some string all around my finger  
As you walk by pull on my string  
Ill come down and let you right in  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Well the very next day at closing time  
The sailor man goes off to the strand  
And as he walks by pulls on that string  
And she came down and let him right in  
  
Well hes never seen such a sight before  
A string on her finger was all she wore  
  
Chorus x2  
  
So all you men who to Yarmouth go  
If ya see those girls with their hair hung low  
All ya gotta do is pull their strings  
And theyll come down and let you right in  
  
Chorus x4
