There could never be a portrait of my love  
For nobody could paint a dream  
You will never see a portrait of my love  
For miracles are never seen  
  
Anyone who sees her soon forgets the Mona Lisa  
  
It would take I know a Michelangelo  
And he would need the glow of dawn that paints the sky above  
To try and paint a portrait of my love  
  
It would take I know a Michelangelo  
And he would need the glow of dawn that paints the sky above  
To try and paint a portrait of my love
