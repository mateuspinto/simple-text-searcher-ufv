Here I lie in my hospital bed  
Tell me sister morphine when are you coming round again  
Oh I dont think I can wait that long  
Oh you see that Im not that strong  
  
The scream of the ambulance is sounding in my ears  
Tell me sister morphine how long have I been lying here  
What am I doing in this place  
Why does the doctor have no face  
  
Oh I cant crawl across the floor  
Ah cant you see sister morphine Im trying to score  
  
Well it just goes to show  
Things are not what they seem  
Please sister morphine turn my nightmares into dreams  
Oh cant you see Im fading fast  
And that this shot will be my last  
  
Sweet cousin cocaine lay your cool cool hand on my head  
Ah come on sister morphine you better make up my bed  
cause you know and I know in the morning Ill be dead  
Yeah and you can sit around yeah and you can watch all the  
Clean white sheets stained red
