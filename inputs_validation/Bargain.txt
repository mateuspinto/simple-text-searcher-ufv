Id gladly lose me to find you  
Id gladly give up all I had  
To find you Id suffer anything and be glad  
  
Id pay any price just to get you  
Id work all my life and I will  
To win you Id stand naked stoned and stabbed  
  
Id call that a bargain  
The best I ever had  
The best I ever had  
  
Id gladly lose me to find you  
Id gladly give up all I got  
To catch you Im gonna run and never stop  
  
Id pay any price just to win you  
Surrender my good life for bad  
To find you Im gonna drown an unsung man  
  
Id call that a bargain  
The best I ever had  
The best I ever had  
  
I sit looking round  
I look at my face in the mirror  
I know Im worth nothing without you  
And like one and one dont make two  
One and one make one  
And Im looking for that free ride to me  
Im looking for you  
  
Id gladly lose me to find you  
Id gladly give up all I got  
To catch you Im gonna run and never stop  
  
Id pay any price just to win you  
Surrender my good life for bad  
To find you Im gonna drown an unsung man  
  
Id call that a bargain  
The best I ever had  
The best I ever had
