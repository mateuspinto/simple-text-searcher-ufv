I can see it in your eyes  
You wanna get down with Queen La  
Lace Latifa I can see ya eyes on my body parts  
The friendships slippin cause it aint me you hittin  
Why you trippin  
  
Wishin you could get a taste from the black Queen  
It captivates the mass when I slide on the scene yo  
We aint gettin down like that  
You took a hug to the next level try to spit that  
  
Counterfeit nice shit put on the act trick  
Try to get a quick kiss and you got snapped quick  
I tried to be nice and play it all smooth  
Well I guess done has somethin to prove  
  
So I had to move getaway like a fugitive  
Didnt wanna do the kid cause I knew the kid  
Didnt really wanna do no harm  
I dont know what I did but I didnt mean to turn you on  
  
I took you out I was only tryin to be nice  
Let you touch it once or twice  
Oh I didnt mean to turn you on  
  
All the ladies in the place know how it go  
When you show a lil kindness cats wanna flow  
Want some mo neck shit some mo sex shit  
Well you tell em from the door its strictly friendship  
  
Didnt mean to turn you on  
Why apologize I aint do nothin wrong  
You knew what the deal was what the real was  
You was confused with the levels of love  
  
I seen you in the club with your eyes on me  
All night lookin asinine up under the strobe light  
More thin ice theres still   
When it break through I dont think we could be friends  
  
If you sayin you a playa baby live like one  
You play yourself like a bomb never gettin none  
And say beggin for some and never get it  
If I turned you on I guess you gotta live with it

Let you touch it once or twice  
Oh I didnt mean to turn you on

So what you mad now got a attitude now  
cause I had to pull your foul  
Frontin big Willie style when youre a major joke  
Pagin me so much till my pager smoked  
  
Got your Eskimo kiss and shit  
Your noses too brown how you get chicks to trip  
Well I aint the one I could buy you and your whip  
Hold your head cause Ive got so many hits what  
  
I took you out I was only tryin to be nice  
Let you touch it once or twice  
Oh I didnt mean to turn you on  
  
And I took you out

Let you touch it once or twice  
Oh I didnt mean to turn you on  
  
And I took you out

Let you touch it once or twice  
Oh I didnt mean to turn you on
