Say I do I do I do  
Say I do I do I do  
  
Never thought that love could make me fall  
Never thought I needed love at all  
Took me a while to finally realize  
That your love was all I needed to complete my life  
Will you make this sacrifice  
Its hard to believe  
But your love has turned my around  
I can make a commitment now  
  
Chorus  
Say I do I do I do  
If you really love me  
Say I do I do I do  
If you wanna be with me  
Say I do I do I do  
Cause I really wanna be with you  
Say I do I do I do  
  
Found myself searchin what was in my heart  
Scared me when I saw us drifting apart  
Even though I didnt know any other way  
I dont wanna lose you  
I want you to stay  
To complete my life  
Will you make this sacrifice  
Its hard to believe  
That your love has turned me around  
Are you ready for love I am now  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh baby my lady  
I cant wait to give you my heart  
My lady sweet lady  
Give me your hand in love  
  
Chorus  
  
If you want me girl and I want you  
Why dont you say I do I do I do  
If you need me girl like I need you  
Why dont you say I do I do I do  
Surrender  
Forever  
Say I do I do I do
