Remember the nights I cried  
You were doing that old Cuban slide  
All night I tried and tried  
I could not master the Cuban side  
  
Rmember the night I started to weep  
Under lights you did the creep  
That night I could not sleep  
Oh lord how goes the creep  
  
Chorus  
AIy YI AIy Ya I wanna dance but my feet wont let me  
AIy YI YI AIy I wanna dance would someone help me  
AIy YI YI Ya I wanna dance but my feet wont let me  
AIy AIy Ya  
  
Last night I could not talk  
On the street you did the Charring Cross walk  
Up and down I swoop and stalk  
Only I can run but I cant walk  
  
Chorus  
  
Remember the nights I cried  
You were doing that old Cuban slide  
All night I tried and tried  
I could not master the Cuban side  
  
AIy YI AIy Ya I wanna dance but my feet wont let me  
AIy YI YI AIy I wanna dance would someone help me  
AIy YI YI Ya I wanna dance but my feet wont let me  
AIy AIy Ya  
  
Now dance
