I took a poundin  
From the radio today  
I heard the radio say some piece of shit  
Was it the sound of today   
  
I took a bitin beating  
When I saw my TV play I saw my TV play  
Over and over  
  
And there were no escape  
The box is hallow  
  
And that riff is fucking dead  
That riff is fucking dead  
But the riff is poundin  
  
In my fucking head  
Theyre gonna push it  
Until false is true  
Until day is night  
  
Theyre gonna push it baby  
Until wrong feels right  
Until wrong feels right  
  
Its a big industry  
And they can beat my brain  
With houses and wars and chains  
  
They are insane  
Yeah  
But they can beat my brain  
  
God and his captains  
They wont pull a fucking plug  
They wont pull a fucking plug  
And give the skies  
Back to the birds and bugs
