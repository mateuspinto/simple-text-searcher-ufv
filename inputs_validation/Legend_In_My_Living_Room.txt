When I was just seventeen I ran away from home  
To be with all the pretty people  
To be on my own  
Bright lights and trains and bedsit stains  
And pavements paved with gold  
And I believed in everything that everybody told me  
Have mercy  
Have mercy on me  
I found myself in a lonely place with a suitcase full of dreams  
And I soon grew up to realise what living in the doghouse means  
But everyday I told myself good things would happen soon  
Cause I knew that was going to be a legend in my living room  
Have mercy  
Have mercy on me  
Welcome to this perfect world  
Now everyday on a dead street is where I spend my time  
The dust has been collecting on the corners of my mind  
But Ive shed my tears in bitter drops until the thorn trees bloomed  
To take the spiky fruit to crown myself the Queen of doom  
Have mercy  
Have mercy
