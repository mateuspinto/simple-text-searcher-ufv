A baby in a manger  
The town of Bethlehem  
The wise men had the heart  
To know He was the great I Am  
They crossed the desert many miles  
To kneel down at His feet  
The star that led them seemed  
To tell them what had come to be  
The Sons gonna rise and shine  
Make the lame walk the deaf talk  
And give sight back to the blind  
Bring a light into the darkness  
No one can deny  
As sure as theres a Heaven  
The Sons gonna rise and shine  
At the age of thirtythree  
The prophecy fulfilled  
On the cross at Calvary  
His blood for man was spilled  
The sky was black as midnight  
But neath the dark and gloom  
Voices rang and Angels sang  
Dancing round the tomb  
The Sonss gonna rise and shine  
Hell take away the keys of death  
The grave will loose its bind  
Hell will be defeated  
In three days of time  
On resurrection morning  
The Sons gonna rise and shine  
Its been two thousand years  
But the storys still the same  
For those who will believe in Him  
And call upon His name  
The Sons gonna rise and shine  
Heal the sick raise the dead  
The Savior of mankind  
The day will soon be dawning  
Will be the end of time  
King of kings Lord of Lords  
The Sons gonna rise and shine  
Jesus Son of Glory  
Will save your soul and mine  
Brother are you ready  
The Sons gonna rise and shine
