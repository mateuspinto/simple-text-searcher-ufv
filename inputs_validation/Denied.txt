The telephone is ringing disconnect the line  
The tension is building but Im alright  
The stars are colliding so you might as well let me go  
The television is burning because I set it on fire  
The wheels they keep turning but Im fine  
What about the questions we have locked up inside  
Somewhere somehow  
Weve been denied  
Hand in hand we walk behind pretending  
Defending while our souls are tied  
Its only the third hour my conscience subsides  
But something reminds me that you lied  
What about the consequences  
This cant be right
