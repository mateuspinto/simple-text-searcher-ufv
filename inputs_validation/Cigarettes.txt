Packet of cigarettes on the counter  
Carrying a government health warning  
Still they want the money still they want the tax  
Still they want the money still they want the tax  
  
Why not take paper currency and light it up  
A lower tar content and a quicker puff  
Then you could keep the money you could keep the tax  
You could keep the money you could keep the tax  
  
Fields wasted growing tobacco  
Could be used to feed the third world countries  
This is the age of hypocrisy  
Everybodys saying vote for me Vote for me  
  
Blind leaders leading the blind  
The cheaters and the cheated will you always find  
Still they want the money still they want the tax  
Still they want the money still they want the tax  
The tax the tax the tax  
  
Still they want the money still they want the tax  
Still they want the money still they want the tax  
But the biggest serial killer is a heart attack  
The biggest serial killer is a heart attack  
  
Still they want the money still they want the tax  
Still they want the money still they want the tax  
Still they want the money still they want the tax  
But the biggest serial killer is a heart attack  
  
Still they want the money still they want the tax  
But the biggest serial killer  
The biggest serial killer  
The biggest serial killer  
The biggest serial killer  
The biggest serial killer is a heart attack
