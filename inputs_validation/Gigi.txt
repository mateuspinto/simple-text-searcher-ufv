Gigi  
Am I a fool without a mind  
Or have I merely been too blind to realize  
Oh Gigi  
  
Why youve been growing up before my very eyes  
Gigi  
Youre not at all that funny awkward little girl I knew  
Oh no  
  
Overnight theres been a breathless change in you  
Oh Gigi  
While you were trembling on the brink  
Oh Gigi  
  
Have I been standing up too close or back too far  
When did your sparkle turn to fire  
And your warmth become desire  
Oh what miracle has made you the way you are  
  
Gigi  
While you were trembling on the brink  
Was I out yonder somewhere blinking at a star  
Oh Gigi  
  
Have I been standing up too close or back too far  
When did your sparkle turn to fire  
And your warmth become desire  
Oh what miracle has made you the way you are
