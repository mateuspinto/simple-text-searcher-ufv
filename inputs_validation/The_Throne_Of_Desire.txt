Written By Cohen Performed In Night Magic  
  
Michael Their bodies Triumphant  
Their power unfurled  
I know I am nothing  
And women the world  
  
A slave to their favours  
Their no and their yes  
Im crushed in the crease  
Of a cotton dress  
  
And Im dead except  
In their company  
And Im only at rest  
When they motion to me  
  
And night after night  
I turn to myself  
And I raise them  
Out of my panic  
And they come to me  
Willing at last  
Inflamed and fast  
Mutual and graphic  
  
And suddenly they drill my heart  
With cavities of absence  
And they cover their thighs  
With cellophane  
And they cover their breasts  
With a shadow  
And they nail my good right hand  
To a wall in the attic  
  
O take me away  
From the thorns and the fire  
And let me recline  
On the Throne of Desire  
  
From the Throne of Desire  
I make this solemn decree  
Every woman I want  
Will want will want will want  
Will more than want me  
  
O o o
