Suzanne was the jewel keeper  
In a word she stole all the jewels  
And she took them to a foreign land  
Which was strictly against all the rules  
And she wore them all proudly  
Like a tiara crown on her head  
She slept with them at night  
Suzanne and the jewels in a bed  
  
Chorus  
Suzanne and her jewels  
Livin on the edge of a friend  
Suzanne how will you sleep at night  
When they take that crown from your head  
  
Suzanne lived down by the river  
The fountain of youth did flow  
And she played on a steel guitar  
And the drifters did come and theyd go  
And shed put on her crown  
And shed sing them a song  
And some drifters would stay here the night  
But they never did stay long  
  
Chorus  
  
This girl flew on the wind  
She wrote her own name in the stars  
Just goes to show sometimes you win  
No matter how crazy you are  
But a thief can come knocking  
Even with blood on the door  
And drink up your fountain of youth  
And throw your jewels and your crown on the floor  
  
Chorus Repeat 2X
