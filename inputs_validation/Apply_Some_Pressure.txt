feat Paul Smith  
  
You know that I would love to see you next year  
I hope that I am still alive next year  
You magnify the way I think about myself  
Before you came I rarely thought about myself  
  
Behind your veil I found a body underneath  
Inside your head were things I never thought about  
You know that I would love to see you next year  
I hope that I am still alive next year  
  
Whats my view  
Well how am I supposed to know  
Write a review  
Well how objective can I be  
X2  
  
You know that I would love to see you in that dress  
I hope that I will live to see you undressed  
The every day is part of what consumes me  
The hate I feel is part of what fuels me  
  
I testify to having guilty feelings  
I must confess Id like to be caught stealing  
You know that I would love to see you in that dress  
I hope that I will live to see you undressed  
  
Whats my view  
Well how am I supposed to know  
Write a review  
Well how objective can I be

I like to wait to see how things turn out  
If you apply some pressure  
X2  
  
What happens when you lose everything  
You just start again  
You start all over again  
X2  
  
I like to wait to see how things turn out  
If you apply some pressure  
X2  
  
What happens when you lose everything  
You just start again  
You start all over again  
X3  
  
What happens when you lose some pressure  
Apply some pressure you lose some pressure  
Apply some pressure you lose some pressure  
Apply some pressure you lose some pressure  
X2  
  
You know that I would love to see you next year  
I hope that I am still alive next year  
You know that I would love to see you in that dress  
I hope that I will live to see you undressed
