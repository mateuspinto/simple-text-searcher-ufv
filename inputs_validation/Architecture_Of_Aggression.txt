Born from the dark  
In the black cloak of night  
To envelop its prey below  
Deliver to the light  
To eliminate your enemy  
Hit them in their sleep  
And when all is won and lost  
The spoils of wars are yours to keep  
  
Great nations built from the bones of the dead  
With mud and straw blood and sweat  
You know your worth when your enemies  
Praise your architecture of aggression  
  
Ensuing power vacuum  
A toppled leader dies  
His body fuels the power fire  
And the flames rise to the sky  
One side of his face a kiss  
The other genocide  
Time to pay with your ass  
A worldwide suicide  
  
Great nations built from the bones of the dead  
With mud and straw blood and sweat  
You know your worth when your enemies  
Praise your architecture of aggression  
  
Born from the dark  
In the black cloak of the night  
To envelop its prey below  
Deliver to the light  
To eliminate your enemy  
Hit them in their sleep  
And when all is won and lost  
The spoils of war are yours to keep  
  
Great nations built from the bones of the dead  
With mud and straw blood and sweat  
You know your worth when your enemies  
Praise your architecture of aggression
