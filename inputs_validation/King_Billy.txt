King Billy  
Why dont you invite them up  
I got a word or two to tell them  
Its about the situation  
A terrible miscommunication  
It involves a child of mine  
Destined to side with the oppression  
King Billy  
Let me speak to them  
But a bad wire burn the connection  
A man fix the problem  
It is the only solution  
King Billy  
I see them birds in flight  
Take off in every direction  
A thinking man a feeling man  
I will not side with the oppression  
King Billy  
Why dont you invite them up  
But aim them in the opposite direction  
A chance at love attraction  
A chance to heal the nation
