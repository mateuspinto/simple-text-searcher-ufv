Many men with lofty aims strive for lofty goals  
Others play at smaller games being simpler souls  
I am of the latter brand All I want to do  
Is to find a spot of land and live there with you  
  
Someday well build a home  
On a hilltop high you and I  
Shiny and new a cottage that two can fill  
And well be pleased to be called  
The folks who live on the hill  
  
Someday we may be adding  
A thing or two a wing or two  
We will make changes as any family will  
But we will always be called  
The folks who live on the hill  
  
Our veranda will command a view of meadows green  
The sort of view that seems to want to be seen  
And when the kids grow up and leave us  
Well sit and look at the same old view just we two  
  
Darby and Joan who used to be Jack and Jill  
The folks like to be called  
What they have always been called  
The folks who live on the hill
