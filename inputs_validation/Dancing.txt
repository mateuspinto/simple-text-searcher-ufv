Here I am dancing in the wind  
My back to your face  
I see the ocean apond us near to my feet  
Youve be smiling the whole time never said a word  
And I said what are you thinking of makes you smile that way  
  
And you said  
  
You  
Your eyes  
Your smile  
Your face  
Ive been taking you in a while  
You  
When Im around  
You seem to light up my world  
And turn me round and round  
You  
  
I just wanted to laugh  
Or cry  
That was so beautiful  
What you just said  
But then you turned silent again  
As I lifted up my knife  
You said before you kill me  
Remember this  
  
And you said  
  
You  
Your eyes  
Your smile  
Your face  
Ive been taking you in a while  
You  
  
When Im around  
You seem to light up my world  
And turn me round and round  
You  
  
Then I really started to cry  
And I bawled  
And I put down my knife  
And took you inside my house  
And I told you that I love you  
Then we did it  
  
The next day I woke up  
After being up all night  
Screaming  
I look over to you  
And I started to smile  
And then you said  
Why the Hell are you smiling like that for Bitch  
  
And I said  
  
Your eyes  
Your smile  
Your face  
Ive been taking you in a while  
You  
When Im around  
You seem to light up my world  
And turn me round and round  
You  
  
Chorous X3  
  
Im so glad for you
