This is True  
Mister nothing said forever said  
I can sing  
Hit it Make it a dead one  
With words like  
Blood soldier mother  
O K O K  
I want to sleep before the end  
Which is impolite  
Hit It Make it a dead one  
If nothing crops up  
Ill give you a ring  
You can sing the end  
O K O K  
Then I could get  
All the little animals out of my room  
Hit it With a broom  
O K O K  
Put them in a big white sack  
No visitors came  
Hit it With words like  
Thou shalt not  
The end
