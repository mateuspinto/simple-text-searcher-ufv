Please let me sit down beside you  
Ive got something to tell you you should know  
I just couldnt wait for not another day  
I love you for more than words can ever say  
Honey living without you is so painful  
I was tempted to call it a day  
Youve got me in your hand why cant you understand  
I love you baby for more than words can say  
I just cant sleep when I lay down in my bed  
The thoughts of you babe just linger in my head  
Living without you is so painful I was tempted to call it a day  
Youve got me in your hand why cant you understand  
I love you honey for more than words can say  
I love you honey for more than words can say  
Yes I do
