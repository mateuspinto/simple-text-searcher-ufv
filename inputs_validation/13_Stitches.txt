The first time I saw the Descendants they were the fastest band Id ever seen  
No one in the crowd really cared for them we were waiting for the Alley Cats
to play  
After a couple months I heard Kabuki Girl on Rodney on the Roq late Sunday
night  
That was enough for me I hopped the bus to Licorice Pizza and bought my all
time favorite record  
  
The next time I went to the Whiskey it was DOA with Millions of Dead Cops  
The latter band played faster than I could believe  
But the songs sounded the same and kinda sucked  
Cept John Wayne was a Nazi and Joey Shithead was a drunk  
Then John Macias beat some hippie to a pulp cause having long hair was a
mistake  
  
The third time I went to the hospital I needed 13 stitches in my head  
I managed to catch about 6 rounds of Ill Repute then some suicidal threw me
into a post  
My girlfriend started to cry cause we had to leave before DRI played fifty
lousy songs  
My blood stained shirt smelled of clove cigarettes  
But it sure looked pretty cool after a wash
