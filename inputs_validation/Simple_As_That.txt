Out on highway 1 I saw a camper van parked out on the shoulder  
Thinkin they had broken down I pulled over  
There was a little old lady and her old man kickin back relaxin  
They said sit down and help us celebrate our golden anniversary  
They had foldin chairs they were holdin hands starin at the fields  
I said man this aint no movie this is real  
  
Love should be as simple as that  
Foldin chairs holdin hands and matching baseball caps  
Love is wanting what you have  
Love should be as simple as that  
  
They said stay awhile I said I thought I might and ask some burnin
questions  
Like howd you make love last so long they started laughing  
He said to keep our love from danger I treat her like a stranger  
Courteous considerate and kind  
  
Love should be as simple as that  
Foldin chairs holdin hands and matching baseball caps  
Love is wanting what you have  
Love should be as simple as that  
  
So I went home and I said baby baby listen  
Theres something missin in our lives  
She said I know I been tryin to tell you  
We need more communication an exotic vacation  
Big screen TV redwood jacuzzi  
Dinners out concerts and movies  
New kitchen big addition a pool jewelry  
Sauna fish pond and a five acre lawn  
I said get in the camper  
  
Love should be as simple as that  
Foldin chairs holdin hands and matching baseball caps  
Love is wanting what you have  
Love should be as simple as that  
  
Love should be as simple as that  
Love should be as simple as that
