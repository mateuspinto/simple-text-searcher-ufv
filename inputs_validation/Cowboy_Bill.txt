He told a good story  
And all us kids listened  
Bout his life on the border  
And the way it was then  
  
And we all believed  
And when he would finish  
Wed ask the old cowboy  
To tell em again  
  
You could almost hear  
Those prairie winds blowing  
His saddle a creakin  
Beneath his old faded jeans  
  
You could taste the dry dust  
From the trail he was ridin  
As he sat there and painted  
Those west Texas scenes  
  
And the grownups would tell us  
You boys keep your distance  
That old mans just telling you lies  
But to all of us kids  
Cowboy Bill was a hero  
Just as true  
As the blue texas sky  
  
He told of a time  
When he rode with the rangers  
Down on the pecos  
And he saved the day  
  
Outnumbered by plenty  
They were almost to cover  
With thirty banditos  
Headed their way  
  
He looked back just in time  
To see a horse stumble  
The captain went down  
And Bill pulled up on his reigns  
  
Through a flurry of bullets  
He rescued the captain  
They rode for the sunset  
Just the story remains  
  
And the grownups would tell us  
You boys keep your distance  
That old mans just telling you lies  
But to all of us kids  
Cowboy Bill was a hero  
Just as true  
As the blue texas sky  
  
Well I still remember  
The day that it happened  
We waited and we waited  
But Bill never showed  
  
The folks at the feed store  
Said they hadnt seen him  
So we set out for his place  
Down on old grist mill road  
  
And we cried when we found him  
Lying there with his memories  
The old trunk wide open  
Things scattered about  
  
He was clutching a badge  
That said Texas Rangers  
And an old yellow letter  
Said Texas is Proud  
  
And the grownups that told us  
You boys keep your distance  
That old mans just telling you lies  
Now theyre all saying  
Cowboy Bill was a hero  
Just as true  
As the blue texas sky  
  
Just as true  
As the blue texas sky
