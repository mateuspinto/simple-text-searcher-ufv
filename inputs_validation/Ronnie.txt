Stories taught  
Quiet town  
Small time for big time crowd  
Never talks  
Never plays  
Different path  
Lost his way  
The streets are red  
Red Im afraid  
Theres no confetti  
No parade  
Nothing happens in this boring place  
But oh my god how it all did change  
And they all pray  
Blood stain wash away  
He said  
Lost my way  
This bloody day  
Lost my way  
I heard it  
He said  
Lost my way  
This bloody day  
Lost my way  
Oh please wash away  
But blood stains the sun red today  
I always said  
Something wrong  
Little strange  
All day long  
Never laugh  
Never smile  
Talked alone for miles and miles and miles  
Yellow comes  
Sun I say  
Keep your smile and laugh all day  
He falls again in this foreign place  
For little boys how they do chase  
And they all pray  
Blood stain wash away  
He said  
Lost my way  
This bloody day  
Lost my way  
I heard it  
He said  
Lost my way  
This bloody day  
Lost my way  
Oh please wash away  
But blood stains the sun red today  
Spoken  
Yeah well all the green things died  
When Ronnie moved to this place  
He said  
Dont you dare ask  
Why Im cursed to wear this face  
I know why the children called him Ronnie frown  
When he pulled that gun from his pocket  
They all fall down down down  
He said  
Lost my way  
This bloody day  
Lost my way  
I heard it  
He screamed  
Lost my way  
This bloody day  
Lost my way  
Oh please wash away  
But blood stains the sun red today  
All things wash away  
They all fall down  
But blood stains the sun today  
All things wash away  
They all fall down  
But blood stains the sun today
