Outlined silhouettes dancing in the dark  
Caught inside your web you stole my heart  
Knew it was wrong from the start  
This game is suicide  
I told you once before  
I feel victimised  
Cause I want you more  
How can I say goodbye  
Tonight tonight  
Running away from you  
Running away from you forever  
  
We live in fantasy were living in tragedy  
But take me to Paradise take me to Paradise  
Take me to Heaven and make me forget  
That youll never be mine  
  
Secret rendezvous  
Dreams that wont come true  
Everything I want  
I found in you  
How can I live this lie  
Tonight tonight  
Running away from you  
Running away from you forever
