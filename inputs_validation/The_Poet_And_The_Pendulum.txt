The end  
  
The songwriters dead  
The blade fell upon him  
Taking him to the white lands  
Of Empathica  
Of Innocence  
Empathica  
Innocence  
  
The dreamer and the wine  
Poet without a rhyme  
A widowed writer torn apart by chains of Hell  
  
One last perfect verse  
Yet still the same old song  
Oh Christ how I hate what I have become  
Take me home  
  
Get away run away fly away  
Lead me astray to dreamers hideaway  
I cannot cry cause the shoulder cries more  
I cannot die I the whore for the cold world  
Forgive me I have but two faces  
One for the world  
One for God save me  
I cannot cry cause the shoulder cries more  
I cannot die I a whore for the cold world  
  
My home was there and then  
These meadows of heaven  
Adventurefilled days  
One with every smiling face  
  
Please no more words  
Thoughts from a severed head  
No more praise  
Tell me once my heart goes right  
Take me home  
  
Get away run away fly away  
Lead me astray to dreamers hideaway  
I cannot cry cause the shoulder cries more  
I cannot die I the whore for the cold world  
Forgive me I have but two faces  
One for the world  
One for God save me  
I cannot cry cause the shoulder cries more  
I cannot die I a whore for the cold world  
Whore for the cold world  
Whore for the cold world  
  
Sparkle my scenery  
With turquoise waterfall  
With beauty underneath  
The Ever Free  
  
Tuck me in  
Beneath the blue  
Beneath the pain  
Beneath the rain  
Goodnight kiss for a child in time  
Swaying blade my lullaby  
  
On the shore we sat and hoped  
Under the same pale moon  
Whose guiding light chose you  
Chose you all  
  
Im afraid so afraid of being raped  
Again and again and again  
I know I will die alone but loved  
You live long enough to hear the sound of guns  
Long enough to find yourself screaming every night  
And if you want  
Live long enough to see your friends betray you  
Years have I been strapped unto this altar  
Now I only have three minutes and counting  
I just wish the tide would catch me first  
And give me a death  
I always longed for  
  
Second robber to the right of Christ  
Cut in half  infacticide  
The world will rejoice today  
As the crows feast on the rotting poet  
  
Everyone must bury their own  
No pack to bury the heart of stone  
Now hes home in Hell serves him well  
Slain by the bell tolling for his farewell  
  
The morning dawned upon this altar  
Remains of the dark passion play  
Performed by his friends without shame  
Spitting on his grave as they came  
  
Get away run away fly away  
Lead me astray to dreamers hideaway  
I cannot cry cause the shoulder cries more  
I cannot die I the whore for the cold world  
Forgive me I have but two faces  
One for the world  
One for God save me  
I cannot cry cause the shoulder cries more  
I cannot die I a whore for the cold world  
A whore for the cold world  
A whore for the cold world  
  
Today in the year of our Lord 2005  
Thomas was called from the cares of the world  
He stopped crying at the end of each beautiful day  
The music he wrote had too long been without silence  
He was found naked and dead  
With a smile in his face a pen and 1000 pages of erased text  
  
Save me  
  
Be still my son  
Youre home  
Oh when did you become so cold  
The blade will keep on descending  
All you need is to feel my love  
  
Search for beauty find your shore  
Try to save them all bleed no more  
You have such oceans within  
In the end  
I will always love you  
  
The beginning
