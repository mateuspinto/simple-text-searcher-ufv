You were near Though I was distant  
Disillusioned I was lost and insecure  
  
Still mercy fought For my attention  
You were waiting at the door Then I let You in  
  
Trading Your life For my offenses  
For my redemption You carried all the blame  
  
Breaking the curse Of our condition  
Perfection took our place  
  
When only love  
Could make a way  
You gave Your life  
In a beautiful exchange  
  
My burden erase my life forgiven  
There is nothing that could take this love away  
  
My only desire and sole ambition  
Is to love You just the same  
  
When only love  
Could make a way  
You gave Your life  
In a beautiful exchange  
  
When only love  
Could break these chains  
You gave Your life  
In a beautiful exchange  
  
Holy are You God  
Holy is Your name  
With everything Ive got  
My heart will sing how I love You
