Intro Kyla  
Baby I like your style  
  
Verse 1 Justin Bieber  
Lips on your neck  
Were never too close now  
Nothing like you and me  
I dont know your name  
But Im sure that you know me  
A little life with the music  
The feeling is mutual  
Loving the way you move on me  
Skin so soft hands on my face to be directed  
And youre all that I can see  
You give the baddest one in here a run for their money  
And when this song comes on you know  
  
Chorus Justin Bieber  
I need a one dance  
1942 in my hand  
One more time fore I go  
Body lockin put a hold on me  
I need a one dance  
1942 in my hand  
One more time fore I go  
Body lockin put a hold on me  
  
Verse 2 Justin Bieber  
You know I like that youre wild  
So make your way over here right now  
We only got a little while  
Just thinkin out loud  
Celebrate life with me babe  
Dont be in a rush to go now  
Oh girl  
  
Chorus Justin Bieber  
I need a one dance  
1942 in my hand  
One more time fore I go  
Body lockin put a hold on me  
I need a one dance  
1942 in my hand  
One more time fore I go  
Body lockin put a hold on me  
  
Outro Justin Bieber  
Hold on me  
Yeah yeah yeah  
One more dance is all I need  
One more dance is all I need  
Oh oh oh
