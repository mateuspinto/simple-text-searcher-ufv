Just dont know why I keep on tryin  
Must be a better way out  
I hope I find it soon  
Every night I just cant keep from cryin  
Even my old dog  
Keeps howlin at the moon  
Even my old dog  
Keeps howlin at the moon  
Even the sun it just a keep on shinin  
Pollyanna days when I was a child and on my own  
Even the tracks they just a keep on linin  
I believe my master is just about to bring me home  
I believe my master is just about to bring me home  
Oh but bless the days and the many different ways  
People try to love one another  
And wont you bless the times and the holy light that shine  
Our cross has been brought asunder  
Even the sun it just a keep on shinin  
Pollyanna days when I was a child and on my own  
Even the tracks they just a keep on linin  
I believe my master is just about to bring me home  
I believe my master is just about to bring me home  
I believe my master is just about to bring me home
