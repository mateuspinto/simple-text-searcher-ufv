Children of Moses

Tell them the truth the truth yeah  
Your soul is worth more than diamonds and gold  
  
If I was President all Blacks will have reparation no segregation  
Feed the nation til there is no famine  
Muslims Jews Christians would all hold hands  
Every week on the beach party by the sand word up  
  
Take trips on Air Force One  
No need to bring the homeless  
With no sneaks to Air Force One  
Better schools in the hood  
Better teachers for the classes  
Makin money payin no taxes

But I gotta watch my back  
Snipers on the hill with the steel  
Man power waitin to JF kill
