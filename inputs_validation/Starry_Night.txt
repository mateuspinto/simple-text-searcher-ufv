Stars in the sky  
I like them better than you  
Stars in the sky  
They tell me what to do  
I dont care about your city  
Or your fat income  
I dont care about your Vanity Fair  
Or your fucking sitcom  
  
Starry night  
Starry night  
That starry night  
  
Makes me feel alright  
I heard a lotta mean talkin  
I met a lotta tough guysthey all look  
Pretty ugly under the stars  
Go out to the desert  
And just look up  
You can feel yourself  
Under the stars  
All mans buildings  
Will soon be gone  
Cause something here  
Is absolutely wrong  
  
Starry night  
Starry night  
That starry night  
  
Makes me feel alright  
Like a human being  
Take your building and your income and  
Shove it up your ass  
Take your building and your income and stuff  
It with your cash  
I heard a lotta big talkmet a lotta tough guys  
That shit looks ugly under a starry night  
Which country is the strongest  
Who plays the best guitar  
Who fucking cares  
Under the stars
