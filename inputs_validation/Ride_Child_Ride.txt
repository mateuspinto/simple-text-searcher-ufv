Well Im sitting here this evening  
Ive got some old friends on my mind yeah I do  
Yeah me and Slick and Davy saluting Mr Daniels  
For the very first time  
We was jamming to old Jimi singing Purple Haze  
No doubt no no  
I think between weed and whiskey  
My head went north and man my feet went south  
  
We had some good times  
And man do I remember them well  
Those days are long gone  
But now I got to tell you just how we left some stories to tell  
  
Chorus  
Ride child ride  
Hell we had some good times then  
Ride child ride  
Sometimes I need those times again  
Do you remember when  
  
Remember all our big talk  
How we were going to be president one day baby  
How we were going to save the whole world  
But man I got to tell you Lord  
Didnt have a clue back then  
  
We had some good times  
And man do I remember them well  
Those days are long gone  
But now I got to tell you just how we left some stories to tell  
  
Chorus  
  
Ride child ride  
Hell we had some good times then  
Ride child ride  
Sometimes I need those times again  
Ride child ride  
Hell we had some good times then  
Ride child ride  
Take me back there man do you remember when
