Tears are falling hearts are breaking  
How we need to hear from God  
Youve been promised weve been waiting  
Welcome Holy Child  
Welcome Holy Child  
  
Hope that you dont mind our manger  
How I wish we would have known  
But long awaited Holy Stranger  
Make yourself at home  
Please make yourself at home  
  
Bring your peace into our violence  
Bid our hungry souls be filled  
World now breaking Heavens silence  
Welcome to our world  
Welcome to our world  
  
Fragile finger sent to heal us  
Tender brow prepared for them  
Tiny heart whose blood will save us  
Unto us is born  
Unto us is born  
  
So wrap our injured flesh around You  
Breathe our air and walk our sod  
Rob our sin and make us holy  
Perfect Son of God  
Perfect Son of God  
Welcome to our world
