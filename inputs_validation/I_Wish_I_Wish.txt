Oh yeah  
I wish I knew I wish I knew  
What makes me me and what makes you you  
Its just another point of view ooh  
A state of mind Im going through yes  
So what I see is never true ahh  
  
I wish I could tell I wish I could tell  
What makes a heaven what makes a hell  
And do I get to ring my bell ooh  
Or land up in some dusty cell no  
While others reach the big hotel yeah  
  
I wish I had I wish I had  
The secret of good and the secret of bad  
Why does this question drive me mad ahh  
Cause I was taught when but a lad yeah  
That bad was good and good was bad no  
  
I wish I knew the mystery of  
That thing called hate and that thing called love  
What makes the inbetween so rough ahh  
Why is it always push and shove ahh  
I guess I just dont know enough yeah  
  
Yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
I wish I knew I wish I knew  
I wish I knew I wish I knew  
  
Somebody tell me somebody tell me  
Ohh ohh
