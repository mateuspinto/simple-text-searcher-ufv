Once inside everything would change before my eyes  
No more decay  
Glorious beauty had taken its place  
But in horror I watched as the wolf began its  
skin to shed  
I grabbed a silver crucifix expecting evil to be next  
To the floor it fell the crucifix the wolf was no  
more a beast  
Instead a lady only dreams can create  
Creeping deep into the heart I never had  
Ill love you forever never leave  
It was love at first sight in true love there is no  
wrong or right  
I didnt care from where she came just her name  
Angel  
Then a kiss soft and warm my love am I really not  
alone  
Nights of heavenly sin in the House of God I  
found true love  
Nights of heavenly sin in the House of God I  
found true love  
Plenty of Food and wine so we laughed and we dined  
We made love in the holiest of places all the  
passion  
it made us crazy  
Ill love you forever never leave  
To the floor it fell the crucifix the wolf was no  
more a beast  
Instead a lady only dreams can create  
Creeping deep into the heart I never had  
I didnt care from where she came just her name  
Angel  
Then a kiss soft and warm my love am I really not  
alone  
Nights of heavenly sin in the House of God I  
found true love  
Nights of heavenly sin in the House of God I  
found true love  
Angel Angel Angel Angel where are you now
