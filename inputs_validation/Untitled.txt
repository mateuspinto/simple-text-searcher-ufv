here it comes  
Well funky monkeys in the jungle tonight  
They got two by two dont hear me right  
  
Band playing loudly baby  
Gone are the days when the days gone  
I said gone  
  
When the monkeys are gone  
Gone or dead this is what they said  
  
Chorus  
Lost Mary  
Cries cries cries  
Yeah she does yeah baby that is what she did  
Lions sleeps baby  
The lamb surely dies   
I just dont want to fuck you  
  
Thats it  
  
When the jungle sleeps  
Is when the monkey shine  
I said you do baby Dont mind  
  
Back Are wild  
If the deuces left in than the deuces are wild  
  
I said baby well  
  
Chorus  
Lost Mary  
Cries cries cries  
Yeah  
Lions sleeps baby  
Dies dies dies  
I just dont want to fuck you  
  
Ooooh kick it  
  
Solo  
  
Give me some of that  
  
Well dime store cowboy shoot your gun  
Knock them mother fuckers down one by one  
  
Money on up its in your face  
Gimme no lip or get your face back here  
  
Ooh got it right  
  
When the monkey dont sleep  
And the money dont shine  
Well   
  
Chorus
