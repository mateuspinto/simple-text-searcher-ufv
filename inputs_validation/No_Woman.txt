No woman  
No cry  
No woman  
No cry  
Cause I remember when we used to sit  
In a government yard in trench town  
Observing the hypocrites  
Mingle with the good people we meet yea yea  
Good friends we have now  
Good friends wie have lost  
Along the way in this great future  
You cant forget your past so dry your tears I say yea yea  
No woman  
No cry  
No woman  
No cry  
Oh little darling do shed no tears  
No woman  
No cfy  
Cause I remember when we used to sit  
In a government yard in trench town  
When Georgie would make the fire lights  
I sit up with the burning through the night yea  
When we would cook cornmeal porridge  
Oh  
Which I share with you my feet is my only carridge  
So I got to push on through and try them gone  
Evrythings gonna be alright  
Evrythings gonna be alright  
Evrythings gonna be alright now  
Evrythings gonna be alright  
Evrythings gonna be alright now  
Evrythings gonna be alright
