Spider crawling on the wall  
I see him and he sees it all  
And he sees it all  
I fell down in that lazy place  
Where the English language cant  penetrate and I  
Saw your mouth moving  just forget it and lie here with me  
Maybe we should just climb under the sheets  
Where the words they dont get in the way  
We were wondering if you recall  
Is this the end of it  end of everything  
We were wondering wonder  
Spider crawling  in my left ear  
Has a message I  want you to hear  
Hope youre happy  found what youre looking for  
Do you miss me miss me at all  
Spider tells me saw you yesterday  
With somebody new  what can I say  
What can I  
Spider crawling I crawl with him   
We go everywhere we see everything  
We are falling we are falling falling to nowhere  
Hope youre happy  found what youre looking for  
Do you miss me miss me at all  
Spider crawling spider crawling spider crawling
