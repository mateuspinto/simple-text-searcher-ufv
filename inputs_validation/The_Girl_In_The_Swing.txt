Do you see them coming through fields of snow  
Do you see them riding through fields of snow  
One rides for a woman who has no name  
One rides for a king  
And one just rides and rides and rides and rides  
For the girl in the swing  
  
They race like phantoms in the Belmont light  
You see them follow the Belmont light  
They ride through places where the walls are white  
Where the noble voices of women sing  
A brace of thanks and silent night  
And a song for the girl in the swing  
  
Well you just asked me do I know what love is  
Well sure I know sure I know what love is  
Its the thief of sleep a boy and his dog  
A red rubber ball these old foolish things  
A rain that falls a long long way from home  
It lives in the girl in the swing  
It lives in the girl in the swing
