Stinky weather fat shaky hands  
Dopey morning doc grumpy gnomes  
  
Little wonder then little wonder  
You little wonder little wonder you  
  
Big screen dolls and explosions  
Sleepy time bashful but nude  
Little wonder then little wonder  
You little wonder little wonder you  
  
Enter galactic see me to be you  
Its all in the tablets sneezy bhutan  
You little wonder little wonder  
You little wonder little wonder you  
  
Mars happy nation sit on my karma  
Dame meditation take me away  
Little wonder then little wonder  
You little wonder little wonder you  
  
Sending me so far away so far away  
Little wonder little wonder you  
  
Sending me so far away so far away  
Little wonder little wonder you
