I thought you was the one hon yeah  
When I met you at the freaknin  
Whoever thought youd be the type to greet and keep secrets  
My friends said dont sleep but I did so now Im reapin  
Disease that I sold I cant beleive you so deceivin  
Sneakin out on the weekends with Michelle  
One of your freak friends from the east end she bad as hell  
Half black and Indonesian the one that tought you treason  
Cupid shoot me on my heart but damn whyd you leave it bleedin  
  
I gave you no reason to lie  
But you choose to live untrue  
Knowing how I feel inside  
Theres no telling what I might do  
Cause I gave you  
  
All my mind  
All my soul  
From the very start  
I gave you full control and you broke my heart  
I tried to show you a better way of life  
But I see that must be what you like  
I loved you more than anything  
I tried to build the future turn a house into a home  
I wanted us to be one flesh and one bone  
Its so hard to keep my sanity  
Now I can do is sit back and reminisce  
Look at the pictures in the frames yo  
Why you playin games yo  
  
As I think back to the begining we was together  
We both loved sports long walks and autumn weather  
Both wanted kids and a family a strong personality  
I liked the way you handled me  
Candles be lit mood set food set you ready yet  
Thats what you said while you was massagin my head  
Now look here I could never leave you lonely  
Cause the love you showed me had me feeling like you already had known me  
Member when you used to blindfold me till I dont see  
Use your mind thats what you told me  
Kissin me slowly  
Never was the loud type always on the low key  
Pretty style but rugged  
Damn I brother I loved the  
  
The birds of a feather sposed to fly together  
Guess that dont apply to birds of your kind  
Cause you only wanted what you wanted like a poacher  
Came to steal my heart and leave me to die  
I aint going out like that though  
  
All my mind  
All my soul  
From the very start  
I gave you full control and you broke my heart  
I tried to show you a better way of life  
But I see that must be what you like  
I loved you more than anything  
I tried to build the future turn a house into a home  
I wanted us to be one flesh and one bone  
Its so hard to keep my sanity  
Now I can do is sit back and reminisce  
Look at the pictures in the frames yo  
Why you playin games yo
