The fires are burning in another land  
Dont start counting dont start counting  
Colder and colder the ice is moving closer  
And gets me down  
Going round and round and down the same old track  
  
Pack on my back going swiftly nowhere  
Heart in my ear beating like a drum  
Where will you go  
  
All by yourself  
And now Im standing on a corner  
Waiting in the rain  
But then in sunlight without warning  
I invent a name  
Me and Sarah Jane  
We had a special thing going  
Me and Sarah Jane  
  
It was a time of love and laughter  
It wouldnt come again  
We had our round of joy but after  
Then began the pain  
  
Me and Sarah Jane  
We had a special thing going  
Me and Sarah Jane  
Sarah Jane  
  
Searching for a clue  
Traces on the sand  
First Im flying going round round round  
Then Im sliding going down down down  
Doesnt matter where I start I always end up  
Crawling through those same old crowded rooms  
  
Me and Sarah Jane  
We had it coming  
All the pain  
Walking down the streets  
And finding nothing is the same  
And now the city lights are dimming one by one  
It costs too much money to keep them on  
  
Me and Sarah Jane  
In silence walk along the shore  
Tears of joy and mocking laughter  
Words lost in the wind  
The tide was rising  
But there we stayed  
We had no fear of dying  
We werent afraid
