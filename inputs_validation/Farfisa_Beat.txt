Everybodys dancing  
To the farfisa beat  
All the girls are crazy  
Acting out the heat  
Tie and shirts and cuff links  
Well thats pretty neat  
  
Chorus  
Flash flash mirror ball  
Stereo and disco  
Wow wow aint she tall  
Moved off my feet  
To the farfisa beat  
  
Pulling my side glances  
To the one across the way  
She wears a lot of makeup  
But they all do these days  
Pretty horny tee shirt  
Well might you explain  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Beat for beat for beat for all  
Cut there in the yea  
Everybodys got their girl  
So is there any spare  
For five foot seven  
Of heavy duty wear  
  
Chorus  
  
Moved Off My Feet To The  
Moved Off My Feet To The  
  
Chorus
