Would you lay with me in a field of stone  
If my needs were strong would you lay with me  
Should my lips grow dry would you wet them dear  
In the midnight hour if my lips were dry  
Would you go away to another land  
Walk a thousand miles through the burning sand  
Wipe the blood away from my dying hand if I give myself to you  
  
Would you bathe with me in the stream of life  
When the moon is full will you bathe with me  
Will you still love me when Im down and out  
In my time of trials will you stand by me  
Would you go away to another land  
Walk a thousand miles through the burning sand  
Wipe the blood away from my dying hand if I give myself to you  
Would you lay with me in a field of stone  
If my needs were strong would you lay with me
