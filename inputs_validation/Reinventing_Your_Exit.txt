Twelvth and Hyde on a Sunday  
Feeling like were grown  
And were nothing short of invincible  
  
It starts again  
Can you feel it  
It takes your breath away  
Stop saying that were invincible  
its round and round  
Youre uninviting unrewarding  
And Im misiforming you  
  
We all want to be somebody  
Right now were just looking for the exit  
This is the way I would have done things  
Up against the wall  
Youve got me up against your wall  
  
Its you and me on a Monday  
The lies that we told  
This is were we both go numb now  
You broke my heart again this time  
Your fading out you crossed the line  
  
We all want to be somebody  
Right now were just looking for the exit  
This is the way I would have done things  
Up against the wall  
Youve got me up against your wall  
  
reason now for an endless liar  
  
This is the way I would have done things  
Up against the wall  
Up against your wall  
This is the way we should have done  
When were up against a wall  
Up against a wall
