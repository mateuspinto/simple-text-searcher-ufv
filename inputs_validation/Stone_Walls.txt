Its been too many years inside this prison  
Too many years just for one little fight  
He got what was comin  
And I think I served enough time  
Im goin home tonight  
  
That stone looks mighty cold  
And the guard that walks that wall  
Is just waitin to get a convict in his sights  
But if I can clear the top  
You can bet Ill never stop  
Cause Im goin home tonight  
  
Because stone walls do a prison  
Make iron bars a cage  
Any man who says they dont  
Never been inside  
Cause in time the bars get closer  
And at night the walls grow tighter  
Do you feel like theres a shackle around your mind  
  
Now those guards are on my tail  
I can hear those sirens wail  
But I know that Ill get away and that Ill be alright  
Cause Id rather live on the run  
Stand free in the morning sun  
Then to spend another lonely prison night  
  
Because stone walls do a prison  
Make iron bars a cage  
Any man who says they dont  
Never been inside  
Cause in time the bars get closer  
And at night the walls grow tighter  
Do you feel like theres a shackle around your mind
