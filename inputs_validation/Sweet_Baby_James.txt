There is a young cowboy he lives on the range  
His horse and his cattle are his only companions  
He works in the saddle and sleeps in the canyons  
Waiting for summer his pastures to change  
And as the moon rises he sits by his fire  
Thinking about women and glasses of beer  
And closing his eyes as the doggies retire  
He sings out a song which is soft but its clear  
As if maybe someone could hear  
He says  
  
Goodnight you moonlight ladies  
Rockabye sweet baby James  
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose  
Wont you let me go down in my dreams  
And rockabye sweet baby James  
  
The first of December was covered with snow  
So was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston  
The Berkshires seemed dreamlike on account of that frosting  
With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go  
  
Theres a song that they sing when they take to the highway  
A song that they sing when they take to the sea  
A song that they sing of their home in the sky  
Maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep  
But singing works just fine for me  
  
Goodnight you moonlight ladies  
Rockabye sweet baby James  
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose  
Wont you let me go down in my dreams  
And rockabye sweet baby James
