I was having this discussion  
In a taxi heading downtown  
Rearranging my position  
On this friend of mine who had  
  
A little bit of a breakdown  
I said breakdowns come  
And breakdowns go  
So what are you going to do about it  
  
Thats what Id like to know  
You dont feel you could love me  
But I feel you could  
  
It was in the early morning hours  
When I fell into a phone call  
Believing I had supernatural powers  
I slammed into a brick wall  
  
I said hey is this my problem  
Is this my fault  
If thats the way its going to be  
Im going to call the whole thing to a halt  
  
You dont feel you could love me  
But I feel you could  
You dont feel you could love me  
But I feel you could  
  
I was walking down the street  
When I thought I heard this voice say  
Say aint we walking down the same street together  
On the very same day  
  
I said hey Senorita thats astute  
I said why dont we get together  
And call ourselves an institute  
  
You dont feel you could love me  
But I feel you could  
You dont feel you could love me  
But I feel you could  I was having this discussion in a taxi heading downtown
