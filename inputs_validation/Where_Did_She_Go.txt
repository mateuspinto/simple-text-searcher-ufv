Everytime I Came Around  
She Made Her Body Go Down  
Her Physical Was So Crazy  
She Could Make A Blind Man See

She Was Gone Before I Could Say shit  
And I aint Looking For No Replacement  
NooWhoa Whoa Whoa  
If I Gotta Almost Search The Whole Club  
Trying To Get To Her Before shes Sobers Up  
Let Me See You Throw Your hands Up

But Everyone Started Rushing Me  
Looking Through The Crowd
