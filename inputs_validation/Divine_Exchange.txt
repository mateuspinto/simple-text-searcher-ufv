Song name Divine Exchange  
Artist Abundant Life Ministries  
  
My heart is captivated Lord by You alone  
Captured by the awesomeness of You alone  
Melted by the grace and mercy You have shown  
I stand in wonder  
  
I reach to You the One who makes the blind eyes see  
Who breaks the chains of sickness with authority  
Restoring what was broken  
So it may fly again  
  
I live to worship You  
I breathe to worship You  
All of my days your face Ill seek  
  
For as I worship You  
You lead me to that place  
To that place of divine exchange
