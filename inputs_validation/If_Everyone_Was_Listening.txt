The actors and jesters are here  
The stage is in darkness and clear  
For raising the curtain  
And noones quite certain whose play it is  
How long ago how long  
If only we had listened then  
If wed known just how right we were going to be  
For we dreamed a lot  
And we schemed a lot  
And we tried to sing of love before the stage fell apart  
  
If everyone was listening you know  
Thered be a chance that we could save the show  
Wholl be the last clown  
To bring the house down  
Oh no please no dont let the curtain fall  
  
Well what is your costume today  
Who are the props in your play  
Youre acting a part which you thought from the start  
Was an honest one  
Well how do you plead  
An actor indeed  
Go relearn your lines  
You dont know what youve done  
The finales begun  
  
If everyone was listening you know  
Thered be a chance that we could save the show  
Wholl be the last clown  
To bring the house down  
Oh no please no dont let the curtain fall
