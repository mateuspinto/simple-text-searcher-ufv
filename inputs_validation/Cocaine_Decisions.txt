Chop a line now  
Cocaine decisions  
You are a person with a snow job  
You got a fancy gottago job  
Where the cocaine decision that you make today  
Will mean that millions somewhere else  
Will do it your way  
  
Cocaine decisions  
You are a person who is high class  
You are a person not in my class  
And the cocaine decision that you make today  
Will mean nothing later on  
When you get nose decay  
  
I dont want to know  
Bout the things that you pull  
Outta your nose  
Or where they goes  
But if you are wasted  
From the stuff youre stickin in it  
I get madder every day  
Cause what you do n what you say  
Affects my life in such a way  
I learn to hate it every minute

Cocaine decisions  
You are a doctor or a lawyer  
You got an office with a foyer  
And the cocaine decision that you make today  
Will not be discovered till its over n done  
By the customers you hold at bay  
  
Cocaine decisions  
You are a movie business guy  
You got accountants who supply  
The necessary figures  
To determine when you fly  
To Acapulco  
Where all your friends go  
  
Cocaine decisions  
We must watch the stuff you make  
You have let us eat the cake  
While your accountants tell you Yes Yes Yes  
You make EXPENSIVE UGLINESS  
How do you do it Let me guess  
Cocaine decisions  
Cocaine decisions  
Cocaine decisions  
Cocaine decisions  
Cocaine decisions  
Cocaine decisions
