Magnificent  
Magnificent  
  
I was born  
I was born to be with you  
In this space and time  
After that and ever after I havent had a clue  
Only to break rhyme  
This foolishness can leave a heart black and blue  
  
Only love only love can leave such a mark  
But only love only love can heal such a scar  
  
I was born  
I was born to sing for you  
I didnt have a choice but to lift you up  
And sing whatever song you wanted me to  
I give you back my voice  
From the womb my first cry it was a joyful noise  
  
Only love only love can leave such a mark  
But only love only love can heal such a scar  
  
Justified till we die you and I will magnify  
The Magnificent  
Magnificent  
  
Only love only love can leave such a mark  
But only love only love unites our hearts  
  
Justified till we die you and I will magnify  
The Magnificent  
Magnificent  
Magnificent
