Theres only one thing that money cant buy  
True love that will never die oh no no  
All my trials Lord soon be over  
  
If religion was a thing that money could buy  
Well the rich would live and the poor would die  
All my trials Lord soon be over  
  
Well the river of Jordan is chilly and cold yeah yeah yeah  
Chills the body but not the soul yeah  
All my trials Lord soon be over  
All my trials Lord soon be over  
All my trials Lord soon be over
