I could use some time to curl away  
My aggression is where you stake your claim  
Why I question this curve on which you grade  
My conception a joke or latest craze  
I try to get away and yet I stick around  
So fall and crawl away and brush away loose ground  
  
My intention may I arrive at eight  
Lie and dream some surprise you guys Im late  
All right correction forgetting something wait  
I try to get away and yet I stick around 2x  
So fall and crawl away and brush away loose ground  
Brush away loose ground  
Brush away
