When the lights go on again all over the world  
And the boys are home again all over the world  
And rain or snow is all that may fall from the skies above  
A kiss wont mean goodbye but hello to love  
  
When the lights go on again all over the world  
And the ships will sail again all over the world  
Then well have time for things like wedding rings and free hearts will sing  
When the lights go on again all over the world  
  
When the lights go on again all over the world  
And the ships will sail again all over the world  
Then well have time for things like wedding rings and free hearts will sing  
When the lights go on again all over the world
