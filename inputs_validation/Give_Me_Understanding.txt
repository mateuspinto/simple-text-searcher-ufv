Give me understanding Lord  
That I might follow  
Teach me from Your Word  
So that my heart be true  
  
Guide me in the path of righteousness  
O Father  
Turn my heart to You  
Turn my heart to You  
  
Thy Word is very good  
Thy Word is very good  
O Lord How I long for You  
  
Thy Word is very good  
Thy Word is very good  
O Lord How I long for You  
  
O Lord How I long for You and Your Word  
  
Turn my eyes from vanities  
Preserve my life Lord  
Be with me so all may see  
Your love and fear  
  
Turn away my troubles  
Let my life be witness  
That my God is near  
That my God is here
