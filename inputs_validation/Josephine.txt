Didnt cha know what I mean  
When I said I love you Josephine Yeah  
Josephine  
Nothing I say does justice to you  
Or lights up the day the way that you do  
Josephine  
  
Like a beautiful queen  
You deserve a crown  
My Josephine Yeah  
Josephine  
Well I pick up the phone and give you a call  
You come around with your sneakers and all  
Josephine  
  
Well  
Sit right back Suppose I went away Ah  
Honey  
Would your love turn sour and moldy green  
When I take from you the light of yoodleehhihoo  
Would I make you sad  
My Josephine  
  
You arrived on the scene  
You made me glad Im alive  
My Josephine Yeah  
JosephineWell  
Nothing I say does justice to you  
Lights up the day the way that you do  
Josephine
