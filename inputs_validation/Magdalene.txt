Magdalene are you thinking of the gentle man  
Who turned your life around  
Magdalene did he leave you any reason to go on  
Magdalene does it make it any better  
That you know he really loved you  
Magdalene all your sins have been forgiven and hes gone  
Magdalene did he give you back the freedom  
To be something you believe in  
Magdalene are you strong enough to make it on your own  
Magdalene I believe he loved you deeper  
Than you ever dreamed of loving  
Magdalene and nobody ever left you so alone  
Oh magdalene   
Magdalene are the shadows in the stillness  
Of the evening full of tears  
Do you wonder how much sorrow you can hold  
Are you haunted by the ghost of something  
Gone but not forgotten  
Will it fill the empty silence when youre old  
Magdalene are you thinking of the gentle man  
Who turned your life around  
Magdalene did he leave you any reason to go on  
Magdalene I believe he loved you deeper  
Than you ever dreamed of loving  
Magdalene all your sins have been forgiven and hes gone
