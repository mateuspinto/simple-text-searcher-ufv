The claim we hold is as good as gold bonanza  
Hand in hand we built this land the Ponderosa Ranch  
Our birthright is this Cartwright bonanza  
We here belong and standing strong wrong aint got a chance  
Day by day work or play ready side by side  
Hello friend come on in the gate is open wide  
Bound to be a fightin free bonanza  
Singing pines of boundary lines for the Ponderosa Ranch  
Every tree and flower is part of our bonanza  
The stars at night the morning light water in the branch  
We ride along four men strong together  
Every plain and ridge is our heritage Ponderosa Ranch  
Day by day work or play ready side by side  
Hello friend come on in the gate is open wide  
Bound to be a fightin free bonanza  
Singing pines of boundary lines for the Ponderosa Ranch
