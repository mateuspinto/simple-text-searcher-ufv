Verse  
Theres a lightning in your eyes I cant deny  
Then theres me inside a sinking boat running out of time  
Without you Ill never make it out alive  
But I know yes I know well be alright  
Theres a devil in your smile its chasing me  
And every time I turn around its only gaining speed  
Theres a moment when you finally realize  
Theres no way you can change the rolling tide  
But I know yes I know that Ill be fine  
  
Chorus  
This time Im ready to run  
Escape from the city and follow the sun  
Cause I wanna be yours dont you wanna be mine  
I dont wanna get lost in the dark of the night  
This time Im ready to run  
Wherever you are is the place I belong  
Cause I wanna be free and I wanna be young  
I will never look back now Im ready to run  
Im ready to run  
  
Verse 2  
Theres a future in my life I cant foresee  
Unless of course I stay on course and keep you next to me  
There will always be the kind that criticize  
But I know yes I know well be alright  
  
Chorus  
This time Im ready to run  
Escape from the city and follow the sun  
Cause I wanna be yours dont you wanna be mine  
I dont wanna get lost in the dark of the night  
This time Im ready to run  
Wherever you are is the place I belong  
Cause I wanna be free and I wanna be young  
I will never look back now Im ready to run  
Im ready to run  
  
Bridge  
This time Im ready to run  
Id give everything that Ive got for your love  
  
Chorus  
This time Im ready to run  
Escape from the city and follow the sun  
Cause I wanna be yours dont you wanna be mine  
I dont wanna get lost in the dark of the night  
This time Im ready to run  
Wherever you are is the place I belong  
Cause I wanna be free and I wanna be young  
I will never look back now Im ready to run  
Im ready to run
