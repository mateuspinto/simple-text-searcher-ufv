My house is no mansion  
But it still holds my treasures  
Things that will never be sold  
Theres a few things in this world  
That just cant be measured  
By money by silver and gold  
  
My house is filled with the things that I love  
From her smile in the mornin  
To her soft goodnight hugs  
Her whisper her laughter  
Everything that she does  
My house is filled with the things that I love  
  
This old bed that we sleep on  
Dont have satin covers  
But it holds some great memories  
No decorations can make better lovers  
In her arms I feel like a king  
My house is filled with the things that I love  
From her smile in the mornin  
To her soft goodnight hugs  
Her whisper her laughter  
Everything that she does  
My house is filled with the things that l love  
Yes my house is filled with the things that I love
