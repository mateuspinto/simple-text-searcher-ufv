The cars leave their trails of hot and cold light inside my head  
Like burnedin long exposure pictures  
The wheels spin slowly backwards  
Strobing in the amber light  
And the rain comes down and washes my brain  
But it dont get clean  
  
This town has turned me into what I have become  
This town dresses me up like a stranger  
This town performs in the window like the ultimate gift  
This town takes us down  
I feel like Im losing you to this town  
  
We were saving our money for half of our lives  
We were saving our dreams  
And we came to this place to make the chances real  
In the big city  
But Ive been counting the days  
Ive been watching you change  
And I can feel it dying  
The noise outside takes you in its arms  
Like a lamb to a lion  
  
And down there somewhere among the noise  
The magazine dolls and the big money boys  
Move silently on their easy heels  
They move silently on their greasy wheels  
  
This town has turned me into what I have become  
This town dresses you up like a stranger  
This town hangs around in the doorway and tells me Im late  
This town takes us down takes us down  
I feel like Im losing you to this town  
  
The morning breaks and I watch you awake  
This town takes you down away from me again
