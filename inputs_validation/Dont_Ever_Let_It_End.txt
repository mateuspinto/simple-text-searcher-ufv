Dont let it end  
Dont let it end  
Dont ever let it end  
  
Well I got two tickets to the game  
It would be great if I could take you to this sunday  
Well Ill walk you home when the whole things done  
If youre there I dont even care which team won  
  
We could stop at the coffee shop  
And make fun of the cops in the parking lot  
We could laugh as we both pretend that were not in love and that were just
good friends  
  
Well Im tired of pretending but Im terrified of it ending  
I know if not for you theres nothing I could do to ever let it end  
And I know you feel the same way because you told me drunk on your birthday  
And as you pulled me near whispered in my ear dont ever let it end  
  
Dont let it end  
Dont let it end  
Dont ever let it end  
  
Saturday Im gonna take her out  
Cause her favorite band is gonna play downtown  
Gonna sing the song weve all heard about those two young friends who should
have fell in love  
  
Later on well cut through the park  
And she can hold my hand because she hates the dark  
And we could laugh as we both pretend that were not in love and that were
just good friends  
  
Well Im tired of pretending but Im terrified of it ending  
I know if not for you theres nothing I could do to ever let it end  
And I know you feel the same way because you told me drunk on your birthday  
And as you pulled me near whispered in my ear dont ever let it end  
  
Please promise me that this wont end  
Dont let it end  
Dont let it end  
Dont ever let it end  
  
Greatest times we ever had the crazy nights just looking back and laugh  
You never know where lifes gonna go because were the only ones who will
ever know  
  
About Sunday night just her and I  
Sitting side by side in the full moon light  
I pulled her close just to hold her tight and the both of us could tell it
just felt right  
She looked at me in the sweetest way  
Like she could tell what the hell I was about to say  
Must have took a while to find the words cause she cut me off and finally
said it first  
  
Well Im tired of pretending but Im terrified of it ending  
I know if not for you theres nothing I could do to ever let it end  
Yeah you know I feel the same way because I told you drunk on my birthday  
And as I pulled you near whispered in your ear dont ever let it end  
  
Please promise me that this wont end  
Dont let it end  
Dont let it end  
Dont ever let it end  
  
Please promise that this wont end  
Dont let it end  
Dont let it end  
Dont ever let it end  
  
Dont let it end  
Dont let it end  
Dont ever let it end
