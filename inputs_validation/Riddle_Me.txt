Chorus  
Riddle me who riddle me why answer me this  
Who owns the chains that bind your wrists  
Riddle me who riddle me why answer me this  
Who built the machine that washed your brain  
Like parents did before them  
Your parents did the same  
They said do your best you must pass the test  
You must learn to play the game  
They scrimped and saved and suffered  
To send you off to school  
But if theyd had the cash they couldve bought the class  
And a different set of rules  
  
Riddle me who riddle me why answer me this  
Who owns the chains that bind your wrists  
Riddle me who riddle me why answer me this  
Who built the machine that washed your brain  
  
They taught a simple system  
Why they had and you had not  
They said know your place you cant win the race  
Lifes an auction youre the lot  
If youd ever thought to question  
They would never answer why  
When they buy your sweat your are in their debt  
And they own you till you die  
  
Riddle me who riddle me why answer me this  
Who owns the chains that bind your wrists  
Riddle me who riddle me why answer me this  
Who built the machine that washed your brain  
  
You took hook line and sinker  
Everything they fed  
Worked day and night for most your life  
To earn their daily bread  
Now youre old and weary  
And you lay you down to sleep  
With body worn and spirit torn  
Whats left is yours to keep  
  
Riddle me who riddle me why answer me this  
Who owns the chains that bind your wrists  
Riddle me who riddle me why answer me this  
Who built the machine that washed your brain
