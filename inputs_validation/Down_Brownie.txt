When I woke up this mornin  
Had a smile run across my face  
My baby from town just had to get down  
Come and drag me all over the place  
  
Gonta drive on a flatbed trailer truck  
Down on highway fiftynine  
I had the blues and my baby she knew  
Shes holdin little piece of mind  
  
Down brownie  
My brownie downtown  
Down brownie  
  
Got my share and Im a black hand cottonfield  
Just to try and keep myself alive  
Eatin red beans and rice with the right sauce its nice  
Or anything you want to try  
  
Now Im hitchin a ride back from Brownies  
Im kind of sad but I feel alright  
The cold night it stings but I got me some wings  
Ill be flyin into Houston tonight
