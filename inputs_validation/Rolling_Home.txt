Rolling home suns around my shoulders  
Rolling home I feel it getting colder  
In my eye the birds cry cry into the land  
While beneath my feet the ship flies fly into the sand  
Rolling home rolling home  
Thoughts returning thoughts of what I told her  
Thoughts returning thoughts as I get older  
In my mind I hear her crying crying in the wind  
In my mind I hear her crying her tears they wheel and spin  
Rolling home Im rolling home  
Golden dawns are shining all around me  
Golden dawns that really think theyve found me  
And I know I will be happy in laughter behind the song  
And I know I will be happy when she and I are one
