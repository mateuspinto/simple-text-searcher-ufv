The wild mountain thyme that grows around my door  
Has grown there for two score years or more  
But Ive grown weary waiting for love to say  
Come my way come my way  
The brook that sings and twinkles in the sun  
Has danced this mercy bounce since time begun  
But O how weary and how long the day  
Will he say Come my way  
Lovers all around I wish you joy  
Happiness to every girl and boy  
But sometimes spare a thought of me and say  
Love come her way come my way
