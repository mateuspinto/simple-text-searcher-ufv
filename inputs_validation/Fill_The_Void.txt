Once there was a man who decided he knew everything  
Once there was a book that he threw in my face  
Once there was an angry mob that marched  
Up and down the street  
Dont ya know they all called my name  
What do they want from me  
CHORUS  
What do they want from me  
What do they want from me  
What do they want from a poor boy who  
Cant believe  
They want to fill the void  
They want to fill the empty spaces  
But I wont let them consume me  
With the rest of the lifeless faces  
Once there was a little girl  
Who thought that she was a queen  
And she thought the world was a playground  
Filled with sand  
So with all her friends she created a fantasy  
They all come to me with their demands  
What do they want from me  
CHORUS  
Every little thing is a piece of a larger thing  
Ever little fish is a tyrant of the sea  
Every little atom is a master of his family  
Every single piece calls my name  
What do they want from me  
CHORUS
