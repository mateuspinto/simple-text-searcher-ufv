All is love is all I am  
A ball is all I am  
Im so new compared to you  
And I am very small  
  
Warm glow moon bloom  
Always need a little more room  
Waiting here seems like years  
Never seen the light of day  
  
All around I hear strange sounds  
Come gurgling in my ear  
Red the light and dark the night  
I feel my dawn is near  
  
Warm glow moon bloom  
Always need a little more room  
Whisper low here I go  
I will see the sunshine show
