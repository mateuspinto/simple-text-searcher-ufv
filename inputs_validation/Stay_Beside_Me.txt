Stay  
Beside me  
Dont go away  
Cause if you leave me I will lose my inspiration  
I dont want to be another victim of frustration  
  
Stay  
Please guide me  
I need your love  
That I may see  
Below above and all around is all confusion  
Youre the only one that breaks the spell of all illusion  
  
Take me  
I belong to only you  
Your love  
Coming down like a gentle rain  
To soothe my pain  
Gently  
Oh wont you stay
