You cut me down a tree  
And brought it back to me  
And thats what made me see  
Where I was going wrong  
You put me on a shelf  
And kept me for yourself  
I can only blame myself  
You can only blame me  
  
And I could write a song  
A hundred miles long  
Well thats where I belong  
And you belong to me  
  
And I could write it down  
Or spread it all around  
Get lost and then get found  
Or swallowed in the sea  
  
You put me on a line  
And hung me out to dry  
And darling thats when I  
Decided to go to sea  
  
You cut me down to size  
And opened up my eyes  
Made me realize  
What I could not see  
  
And I could write a book  
The one theyll say that shook  
The world and then it took  
It took it back from me  
  
And I could write it down  
Or spread it all around  
Get lost and then get found  
And youll come back to me  
Not swallowed in the sea  
  
Ooh  
  
And I could write a song  
A hundred miles long  
Well thats where I belong  
And you belong with me  
  
The streets youre walking on  
A thousand houses long  
Well thats where I belong  
And you belong with me  
  
Oh what good is it to live  
With nothing left to give  
Forget but not forgive  
Not loving all you see  
  
Oh the streets youre walking on  
A thousand houses long  
Well thats where I belong  
And you belong with me  
Not swallowed in the sea  
  
You belong with me  
Not swallowed in the sea  
Yeah you belong with me  
Not swallowed in the sea
