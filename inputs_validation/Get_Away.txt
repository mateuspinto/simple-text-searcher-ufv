Well I used to be a listener  there was nothing left to get  
About what you are and what you havent been yet  
and some of them like to tell a story that is long and old  
and couch it in indifference and the wine  
that they were sold to get away  
  
Well someones got to tell them that its not deserved  
rehearsed or written down by playwrights over time  
just picking up on a nerve  
And some of them got a difference that they reserve for you  
Well I like them all but I dont trust any of them  
well shouldnt you just get away  
  
Well I used to think my freedom was a lot of things Id give  
demanding on my time but I had so much time to give  
and I used to think that everything was a knee in what you are  
But finding out the truth that hurts  
so I never went that far  
I always get away  
  
Well it comes down to the fact that Im now different from the past  
demanding all my ideals its just trying to make them last  
and some of the things that you say theyre ringing home so true  
I hang my head out of the door and I follow you  
yes I follow you and get away
