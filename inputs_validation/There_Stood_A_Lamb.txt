There Stood A Lamb  
Words and music by Ray Boltz  
He was standing in heaven  
With tears in his eyes  
Saying tell me this isnt so  
For there was one in heaven  
And no one on earth  
Worthy to open the scroll  
Then one of the elders  
Said John dont you cry  
It was all part of the plan  
Then in the center  
Of Gods glorious throne  
Hallelujah there stood a lamb  
And they sang worthy  
Worthy of honor and praise  
They were casting down crowns  
And praising His name  
When he cried who is worthy  
I can hear Jesus saying I am  
Oh praise God forever  
There stood a Lamb  
Now open your Bible  
Open your heart  
Its clear we are in last days  
And he said Ill come quickly  
So dont be surprised  
When he comes back to take us away  
And feeble excuses wont get very far  
When you find yourself  
There at His throne  
If you know Jesus  
And He is your Lord  
Hallelujah you wont be alone  
And well sing worthy  
Worthy of honor and praise  
Well be casting down crowns  
And praising His name  
When he says are you worthy  
I can hear Jesus saying I am  
Oh praise God forever  
There stood a Lamb  
And well sing worthy  
Worthy of honor and praise  
As we cast down our crowns  
Well be praising his name  
When he says are you worthy  
I can hear Jesus saying I am  
Oh praise God forever  
Praise God forever  
Praise God forever  
There stood a Lamb
