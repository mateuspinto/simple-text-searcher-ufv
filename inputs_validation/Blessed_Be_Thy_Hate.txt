Enriched with crimson shades of pain the river runs dry  
  
Full of painfull memories of happiness  together we fly  
And I curse you death  cold flesh of ice  
I see your beauty through a halo of flies  
Oh God prevent my fall  
Oh God inside my soul Allah  
The night falls upon my wretched self  
And he who hath forsaken the giver of my purity  
  
And so I never cry the night falls upon my dying eyes  
Theres no power source left to me and so like this I lie  
  
In this barren castle I cant find any tears  
  
My fear takes hold I flow onto the mold  
Sinfull souls dark with fire  
Burn freeze cold with desire  
Heavens start to cry  
Crawl for me beg for me  
To hear your cries  
Why it seems like a life that dies  
Silently I watch you die  
And see you cry  
The tears of hope denied  
They are falling but never from my eyes
