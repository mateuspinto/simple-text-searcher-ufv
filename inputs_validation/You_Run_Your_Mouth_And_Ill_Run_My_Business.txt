You catch me beatin up your chops  
I ought to turn you over to the cops  
But dig this spiel Im going to lay on you gate  
Dont cop your broom park the body and wait  
  
You run your mouth and Ill run my business brother  
You run your mouth and Ill run my business brother  
You tell everybody Im busted  
You talk so much you got me disgusted  
But you run your mouth and Ill run my business  
Brother  
  
You run your mouth and Ill run my business brother  
You run your mouth and Ill run my business brother  
You start in tellin me youre my pal  
And end up tellin me how to handle my gal  
You run your mouth and Ill run my business brother  
  
You run your juicy mouth and Ill run my business  
Brother  
Just run your juicy mouth and Ill run my business  
Brother  
You always tellin me what to do  
Sayin I wouldnt do that if I was you  
You run your mouth and Ill run my business brother  
  
Just clap your liver lips and Ill run my business  
Brother  
Clap your liver lips and Ill run my business brother  
If Id followed your advice on how to make dough  
Id been in the jailhouse long ago  
You run your mouth and Ill run my business brother  
  
Do you dig me Jack
