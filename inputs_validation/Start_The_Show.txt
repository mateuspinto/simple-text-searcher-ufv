For money I assassinate  
Today I have an opponent thats worthy  
Now killing me  
You wont find that so easy  
  
Clap your hands  
Lets start the show cmon  
Lets go  
Say one two three four  
Say oh Clap your hands  
Uh lets start the show  
Cmon cmon  
Say one two three four  
  
Revolutionary gangster the will to kill  
Everything up my roots is steel  
Do it big time march through the desert and shine  
Let the Cs live free while we open the minds  
Of every black man white man no color my writing hand  
Is like dynamite I fight for land  
Blood stains yo gettin money affect the plan  
We travel to Beijing and end up in Japan  
Hoods everywhere bring the goods and gear  
And teach them how to hold mics and grow them beards  
Then stop check my brothers and my sisters in Africa  
We know thats theirs yes we been actin up  
Bush fucked the world up and left our soldiers  
Out in Iraq bless them with roses  
Foes try to approach we roast them goats  
We terrorize the city while forgettin the quotes  
  
Say oh Clap your hands  
Lets start the show cmon  
Lets go  
Say one two three four  
Say oh Clap your hands  
Uh lets start the show  
Cmon cmon  
Say one two three four  
  
They tryin to take us back to Reaganomics with atomic bombs  
On Islamic countries to stop them from being Islamic  
But Islam is a way of life Islam is the way of Christ  
Islam means peace the beast must pay a price  
For his wickedness politics is the trickiest  
Business on this planet the bandits are the slipperiest  
Snakes who ever slithered you ever stop to consider  
Whos pulling these strings from Napoleon to Hitler  
Is there an unseen hand with the unseen plan  
The unclean man from the unclean land  
Desire to kill the righteous dumbs down the brightest  
Give his life in this world that seem so lifeless  
Put a price on things that are priceless  
The fierceness that meanness is stronger than the niceness  
Who really has the power is is theirs is it ours  
Is it a democracy or the morning prowlers  
Do we have a press or President  
Is it a test or a testament Pest or pestilence  
Who got the evidence  
Who got the common sense Stop all the negligence  
  
Say oh Clap your hands  
Lets start the show cmon  
Lets go  
Say one two three four  
  
I oversee the world  
You taught many of em many dudes  
Im moldin rappers and showed em how to eat  
Chef the senator of thoughts  
Democratic gats  
Saved by the judge  
The flavor that was brought about that day  
Steaks come out raw  
  
Say oh Clap your hands  
Lets start the show cmon  
Lets go  
Say one two three four  
Say oh Clap your hands  
Uh lets start the show  
Cmon cmon  
Say one two three four
