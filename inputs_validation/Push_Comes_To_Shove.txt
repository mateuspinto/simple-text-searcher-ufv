Chorus  
Can you be in love  
When you live alone  
Push comes to shove  
When youre bitchin on  
  
Now look at every  
Im tonne on you without a doubt  
Said the music does the talkin  
But all we heard is talk about  
  
The girls are left behind  
When forty women all spend time  
With me and the boys  
And the toys yeah  
  
Rose said she was fine for two  
With blonde hair by crack it  
Miles of blue  
Suze she was on my side  
Cause she and Nancy  
Ah they took me for a ride  
  
The girls are left behind  
When forty women all spend time  
With me and the boys  
And they do yeah the toys  
  
Talk about it  
Walk about it  
Talk about it  
Talkabubi  
Talk about it  
Talk about it  
Dedumdudidudi  
  
Chorus  
  
She looked well about thirty five to me  
When mine was still comin on to you  
But I was covered back back then  
Cause me and the boys  
Knew hot courier  
  
The girls are left behind  
When forty women all spend time  
With me and the boys  
And the toys in the attic  
  
Her sister she was lank and thin  
Never thought Id given in  
Her candle of youth was burnin low  
But me and the boys  
Knew something had to go  
  
The girls are left behind  
When forty women all spend time  
With me and the boys  
Dededudidudu
