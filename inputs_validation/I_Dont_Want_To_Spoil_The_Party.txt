I dont want to spoil the party so Ill go  
I would hate my disappointment to show  
Theres nothing for me here so I will disappear  
If she turns up while Im gone please let me know  
  
Ive had a drink or two and I dont care  
Theres no fun in what I do if shes not there  
I wonder what went wrong Ive waited far too long  
I think Ill take a walk and look for her  
  
Though tonight shes made me sad  
I still love her  
If I find her Ill be glad  
I still love her
