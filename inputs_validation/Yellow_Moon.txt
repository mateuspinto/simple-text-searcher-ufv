The moon is on the rise it stares at me tonight  
Im reminded of the arms that held me tight  
Last time I held you it ended all too soon  
We were lying underneath a yellow moon  
  
Theres a yellow moon hanging in a starry sky  
Oh I wonder if youre watching it too  
Theres a yellow moon hanging in a starry sky  
Wherever you are its watching over you  
Oh shine on shine on yellow moon  
  
Sometimes we sit and talk me and that old moon  
I ask him are you happy or if youre blue  
I start to reminisce to a summer night in June  
We fell in love under a yellow moon  
  
Theres a yellow moon hanging in a starry sky  
Oh I wonder if youre watching it too  
Theres a yellow moon hanging in a starry sky  
Wherever you are its watching over you  
Oh shine on shine on yellow moon  
  
Yellow moon oh yellow moon
