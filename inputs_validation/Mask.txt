Youre wearing a mask  
Youre wearing a mask  
Youre wearing a mask  
You look better that way  
Youre wearing a mask  
Youre wearing a mask  
Youre wearing a mask  
You look better that way  
Are you my friend  
Are you my plumber  
Are you my God  
What do you do  
Wearing a mask  
Youre wearing a mask  
Youre wearing a mask  
Which mask are you  
Which mask are you  
Complicated crushed up disappointed squirming angry thrusting stabbing
regretting starving greedy human alien being struggling down the street up
the alley in the elevator through the party to the office in the bedroom
on your way to the morgue Bullshitting lying doing a good deed or feeling
loved barely possible Aware of insatiable demands of not a society all around
you Chunky frat boys in their shorts pimps with old semite eyes sex
hoochies of the jungle sensitive smart alec college graduates critics
fronting franticly in New York city every body in LA just plain licking ass
or having it licked irony in place of balls balls in place of brains brains
in place of soul where is the soul where is the love where am I  
Which mask are you  
Which mask are you  
Which mask are you  
Youre wearing a mask  
Youre wearing a mask  
Youre wearing a mask  
Which mask are you
