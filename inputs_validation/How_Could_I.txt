There you were like a ghost from my early days staring straight ahead at me  
How could I ever guess from that moment on just how everything would change  
How could I know  
  
I recall something strange coming over me somewhat at a loss for words  
Id been around and had my share of what I thought my soul could bare but
never seen what I saw in your eyes  
  
How could I know  
We never took it slow  
We gave it all we had and more  
  
How could I know  
We never took it slow  
We gave it all we had and more  
  
Looking back at where weve been the road ahead is so uncertain  
We keep passing open windows forever  
  
Ive tried before Ill try again I never know where were going  
I only know that Ill be yours forever Yours forever Forever Forever  
  
How could I know  
We never took it slow  
We gave it all we had  
We gave it all we had
