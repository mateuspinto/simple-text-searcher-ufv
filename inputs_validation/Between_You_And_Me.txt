Today I saw music in the sky  
I drove towards it in my car  
And I turned left and I turned right  
But I could never lose the light  
That shines towards tomorrow night  
  
Who can say what it means  
What goes on in between  
And what gets in between  
Its just somethin  
Between you and me  
Between you and me  
Between you and me  
Its as sweet as can be  
  
Today I saw music in the sky  
It sang around me I went blind  
Like a masterpiece in a disguise  
Couldnt stop it pulling at my eyes  
  
Who can say what it means  
What goes on in between  
And what gets in between  
Ice and fire  
Between you and me  
Between you and me  
Sweet as can be  
Between you and me  
  
Monday Tuesday Blow a fuse day  
Fix it in the usual way  
Meet me at the church and well get in a state  
Stay up late and Ill wake up feeling like  
A kid swingin on heavens gate  
With no God to complain  
Or point the finger of blame  
Well get it all down on video 8  
You comin out to play  
Could be quite a day  
  
And I sang that pretty tune  
An open airy song  
And my heart looped the loop  
Well I could do no wrong  
  
Who can say what it means  
What goes on in between  
Who can say what you see  
And what gets in between you and me  
  
Between you and me  
Sweet as can be  
Between you and me
