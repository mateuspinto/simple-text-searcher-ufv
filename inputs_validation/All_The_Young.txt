Young girls  
Not so innocent  
Will give you wide eyes  
Will show you knowing smiles  
  
Young men  
An air of independence  
Will take you at their leisure  
They live for pleasure  
  
All the young people of today  
  
Young girls  
An air of mystery  
Are dreaming from their towers  
They smell of flowers  
  
Young men  
They can do anything  
They are set to win  
With unmatched power  
  
All the young people of today
