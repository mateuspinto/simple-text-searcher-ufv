In the eye of the storm  
Looking out through the rain  
Gabriel blow your horn  
They shield me from tsunamis and the hurricane  
  
Chorus  
Catch the right ride in the nick of time  
Soldiers stay affronted then they blow your mind  
Bold ass soldiers marching off to war  
No idea what were in for  
Powerful magnificent and so divine  
Soldiers stay affronted itll blow your mind  
  
Hear a thunderous voice  
Shouting there will be no peace  
Until our people rejoice  
When every boy and girl is freed  
You see its going down  
The wars and the mysteries  
But my friends therell be better days  
And a better way  
According to the prophecy  
  
Bridge  
It would be so nice  
To look up at paradise  
By all means we must go  
Or are you in the know  
Like all the way up so child  
  
You been a friend of mine  
  
Chorus  
  
You been a friend of mine  
  
Bridge
