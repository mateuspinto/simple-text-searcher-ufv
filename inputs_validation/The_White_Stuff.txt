The white stuff The white stuff  
  
The first one was a sweet one  
Second one was a blast  
Soon I finished off the bag ate em up real fast  
You can see em in my teeth  
Tell it when I talk  
Had so many my pancreas just went into shock  
  
I love the white stuff baby  
In the middle of an Oreo  
I love the white stuff baby  
Its the most delicious thing I know  
  
Ive had a zillion or two  
In my life theyre so right  
My teeth are all rotted clear through  
But who cares What else am I supposed to do  
  
Chorus  
Oh Oreo  
The white stuff  
Oh Oreo  
Whats in the middle The white stuff  
  
The first time that I tried it  
Got a big sugar buzz  
Nothing gets me high as that sandwich cookie does  
But I love the filling most  
I rub it on my roast  
Mix it in with my coffee and spread it on my toast  
  
I love the white stuff baby  
In the middle of an Oreo  
I love the white stuff baby  
Take some with me everywhere I go  
  
Might get a pimple or two  
Well so what Its all right  
Now Twinkies and Ding Dongs wont do  
All I need You know what it is  
  
Chorus  
Oh Oreo the white stuff Repeat x1  
Oh Oreo  
Whats in the middle The white stuff
