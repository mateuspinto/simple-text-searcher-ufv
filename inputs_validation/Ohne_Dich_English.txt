I will go into the firs  
There where I her last seen  
But the evening threw a cloth onto the country  
And on the ways term edge of forest  
And the forest rises so black and empty  
Pain me oh pain  
And the birds do not sing no more  
  
Without you I cannot be  
Without you  
With you am I also alone  
Without you  
Without you count  I the hours  
Without you  
With you the seconds stand  
Are not worth  
  
On the branches in the ditches  
It is now quiet and without lives  
And breathing falls me oh so heavily  
Pain me oh pain  
And the birds do not sing no more  
  
Without you I cannot be  
Without you  
With you am I also alone  
Without you  
Without you count  I the hours  
Without you  
With you the seconds stand  
Are not worth without you  
  
And breathing falls me oh so heavily  
Pain oh pain  
And the birds do not sing no more  
  
Without you I cannot be  
Without you  
With you am I also alone  
Without you  
Without you count  I the hours  
Without you  
With you the seconds stand  
Are not worth without you  
  
Without you  
Without you  
Without you
