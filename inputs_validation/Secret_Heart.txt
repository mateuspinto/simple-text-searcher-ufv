No other love stood the test of time  
Can you imagine how Id feel if you were mine  
Once I know its not makebelieve  
Its plain to see that youve got something over me  
  
You hold the key to my secret heart  
Just turn the lock  
And we could be lovers after dark  
And we could be lovers after dark  
  
With other girls its just been physical  
So many times before I never cared at all  
With you I realize what love could be  
And I could feel that youve got something over me  
  
You hold the key to my secret heart  
Just turn the lock  
And we could be lovers after dark  
And we could be lovers after dark  
  
You hold the key to my secret heart  
Just turn the lock  
And we could be lovers after dark  
And we could be lovers after dark
