Somebody told me once that pain is a game we all gotta play  
But while am I in overtime every other day  
I know that for all the good in life its a price we all gotta pay  
But I paid till I poked and I still dont know what it is to have a good day  
And everybody knows what it is that I need to do  
Well do me a favor let me worry about me and you worry about you  
I dont need no one to put me down  
Im on the ground cant  
I dont need no one to hack around and make  
Just makes me look older  
I dont need no one to block my eyes and tell me lies
