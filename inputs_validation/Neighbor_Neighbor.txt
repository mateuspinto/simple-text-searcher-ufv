Words and music by Billy Gibbons  
  
Neighbor neighbor why you messin in my life  
Neighbor neighbor youve been talkin to my wife  
tellin her you seen me  
runnin wild the other night  
runnin wild the other night  
  
A neighbor neighbor theress always one in every crowd  
A neighbor neighbor tellin lies and talkin loud  
You better watch your step now  
You might fall off your cloud  
you might fall off your cloud  
  
Now I was walking down a dusty road  
when along came a neighbor of mine  
He saw me walkin with my head hung down  
he just had to stop and pass the time  
Neighbor neighbor floatin in the salty brine  
floatin in the salty brine
