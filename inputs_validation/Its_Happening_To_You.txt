Well its the same old song  
Boy meets girl  
And girl meets boy  
They carry on  
They close their eyes  
And kiss until the world is gone  
Oh yes its true  
Its happening to you  
You know what they say  
They pledge their love forever  
Then they add a day  
They hold their hands so tight  
In the fear  
That one might stray  
Oh yes its true  
Its happening to you  
I loved her  
She loved me too  
We had a lot of love  
Now its all through  
And for a while  
Their hearts beat one  
As they match each other  
Smile for smile  
They dance away the night  
As they praise  
The others style  
Oh yes its true  
Its happening to you
