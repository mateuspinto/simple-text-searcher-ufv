If not tonight  
This is the strangest feeling  
Something I cant control  
Do I play the fool for you  
  
If not tonight  
Waiting forever  
Just to see your face  
Waiting is all that I seem to do  
  
Yeah puro amore  
Will another night exist like this again  
Yeah solo amore  
We will never get this moment back  
Again  
  
If not tonight  
Underneath the stars  
Beneath the crescent  
Sinking down into the sea  
Its not the time  
But I will wait forever  
If this is what you want  
Waiting could be the end of me  
  
Yeah puro amore  
Will another night exist like this again  
Yeah solo amore  
We will never get this moment back  
Again  
  
One day I will open your eyes  
Underneath the stars  
Beneath the crescent  
  
Yeah puro amore  
Will another night exist like this again  
Yeah solo amore  
We will never get this moment back  
Again  
  
Yeah puro amore  
Let it be with you tonight  
There will never be a night  
If not tonight  
  
Tell me when my love
