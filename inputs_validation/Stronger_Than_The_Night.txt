Tonight you are the world to me part of the mystery  
And we dont need a reason to love  
Say youll never go thats all I need to know  
And when you close your eyes Ill still be here  
And if the world falls  
You will be the only reason to love  
Ill find my way  
  
One heart may lie one kiss may die  
But we live live and learn to fly  
Beyond the darkest sky  
Stronger than the night  
  
If you hold me now all that I feel is yours  
cause youre the only reason to love  
What you are to me is all that you need to be  
And when you touch the stars I will be there  
And when the world falls away  
I will be your only reason to love  
  
Ill find my way  
One heart may lie one kiss may die  
But we live live and learn to fly  
Beyond the darkest sky  
Stronger than the night  
  
One heart may lie one kiss may die  
But we live live and learn to fly  
Beyond the darkest sky  
Stronger than the night
