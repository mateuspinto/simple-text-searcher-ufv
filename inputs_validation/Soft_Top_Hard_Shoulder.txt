Soft top hard shoulder  
See me running down that line  
I cant stop too much older now  
Let it run in overtime  
Run till it breaks up  
Overheats and explodes  
Pick up whats left of me  
Leave the rest of it way down that road  
  
Soft top hard shoulder  
  
Soft top hard shoulder  
Step in to the flame  
Blue center so much colder  
Wont be the same again  
  
Im gonna run till it breaks up  
Overheats and explodes  
Pick up whats left of me  
Leave the rest of it way down that road  
Soft top hard shoulder
