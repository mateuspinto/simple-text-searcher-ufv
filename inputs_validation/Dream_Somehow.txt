Come to the rescue now  
Come to the rescue and stay for a little while  
Come to the burning house  
All of the ladybugs children are screaming fire  
Come to the rescue now  
CHORUS  
Tomorrow may changetomorrow may change  
Or it may never come  
Tomorrow may changetomorrow may change  
But it may never come  
Turn aroundturn aroundturn aroundwhat do you see  
Come to the rescue now  
Come to the rescue before all our worlds collide  
Life is a dream somehow  
LIfe is speck of dust lodged in Gods eye  
Life is a dream somehow  
Come to the rescue now  
Come with a mission and come with a broken heart  
Life is a dream somehow  
Life is a dream and our lives are a world apart  
Come to the rescue now  
CHORUS  
Come to the rescue  
Life is a dream somehow  
Life is a nightmare and life is a bitter pill  
Life is a dream somehow  
Life is a Disneyland ride which is better still  
Come to the rescue now  
Life is a drowning pool  
Life is a circus for fools just like you and me  
Life is a mortal coil  
Wrapped in cheap tin foil on a kitchen sink  
Come to the rescue now  
CHORUS  
Dreams somehow come to the rescue now
