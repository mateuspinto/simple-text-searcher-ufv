Youve been right and Ive been wrong  
Ive been weak and youve been strong  
Youve been good and Ive been bad  
Think Ive had enough of that  
  
Chorus  
Cause all I want to do in life  
Is to love somebody with all my might  
All I want to do in life  
Is to love somebody with all my might  
  
I loved the days you loved the night  
I loved to love you loved to fight  
I drive to you youre far away  
It gets harder every day  
  
Chorus  
  
Wish you could be a friend of mine  
Wish you could learn to play with time  
You say I dream my life away  
If I do well thats OK  
  
Chorus x3
