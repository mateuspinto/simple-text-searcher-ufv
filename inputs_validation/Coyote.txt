Coyote goes to the top of the hill  
Doin the things that coyotes will  
Staring at the sky at the moon  
You know he starts to howl  
  
Coyote goes to the mountain top  
Looks over down at the river says What a drop  
No tame dog is gonna take my bone  
  
Coyote at the top of the hill  
Doin the things coyotes will  
You gotta cast the first stone  
Cast the first stone  
  
Jackal goes to the top of the hill  
Doin the things that jackals will  
Staring at the moon  
You know he starts to howl  
  
Wild dog up on the mountain top  
Blood in his jaws the bone he drops  
No tame dog is ever  
Ever gonna take my bone  
  
Jackal up on the top of the hill  
Doin the things that jackals will  
Cast the first stone  
Cast the first stone  
  
Coyote on top of the hill  
Ooohhh doin the things that coyotes will  
Staring at the sky looks at the moon  
He starts to howl  
  
Coyote up on the mountain top  
Blood in his jaws the bone he drops  
Says no tame dog is ever  
Ever gonna take this bone  
  
Coyote up on the mountain top  
Says What a drop  
You gotta cast the first stone  
Cast the first stone  
Cast the first stone  
You gotta cast the first stone
