Yeah  
Here we stand or here we fall  
History wont care at all  
Make the bed light the light  
Lady mercy wont be home tonight  
  
Yeah you dont waste no time at all  
Dont hear the bell but you answer the call  
It comes to you as to us all  
Hey were just waiting  
For the hammer to fall  yeah  
  
Oh every night and every day  
A little piece of you is falling away  
But lift your face the western way baby  
Build your muscles as your body decays  
  
Yeah toe your line and play their game  
Yeah let the anaesthetic cover it all  
Till one day they call your name  
You know its time for the hammer to fall  yeah  
  
Rich or poor or famous for  
Your truth its all the same  oh no  oh no  
Oh lock your door but rain is pouring  
Through your window pane  oh no  yeah  
Baby now your struggles all vain  
  
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh  
  
For we who grew up tall and proud  
In the shadow of the mushroom cloud  
Convinced our voices cant be heard  
We just wanna scream it louder and louder and louder  
  
What the hell we fighting for   
Ah just surrender and it wont hurt at all  
You just got time to say your prayers  
Eh while youre waiting for the hammer to hammer to fall  
Hey yes its starting to fall eh hammer you know  
Yeah hammer to fall wooh ah hey eh woowoo ha eh hammer  
Waiting for the hammer to fall baby  
Yeah yeah while youre waiting for the hammer to fall  
Give it to me one more time
