The moment you walked inside my door  
I knew that I need not look no more  
Ive seen many other souls before  
Ah but Heaven mustve programmed you  
  
The moment you fell inside my dreams  
I realized all I had not seen  
Ive seen many other souls before  
Ah but Heaven mustve programmed you  
  
Oh will you will you will you  
  
I go where true love goes  
I go where true love goes  
I go where true love goes  
I go where true love goes  
  
And if you walk along and if you lose your way  
Dont forget the one who gave you this today  
Follow true love follow true love  
Follow true love follow true love  
  
Oh will you will you will you  
  
I go where true love goes  
I go where true love goes  
I go where true love goes  
I go where true love goes  
  
And if a storm should come and if you face away  
That may be the chance for you to be safe  
And if you make it through the trouble and the pain  
That may be the time for you to know his name  
  
The moment you walked inside my door  
I knew that I need not look no more  
Ive seen many other souls before  
Ah but Heaven mustve programmed you  
  
The moment you fell inside my dreams  
I realized all I had not seen  
Ive seen many other souls before  
Ah but Heaven mustve programmed you  
  
The moment you said I will  
I knew that this love was real  
And that my faith was seen  
Oh Heaven mustve programmed you  
  
The moment I looked into your eyes  
I knew that they told no lies  
There would be no good byes  
Ah cause Heaven mustve programmed you  
  
I go where true love goes  
I go where true love goes  
I go where true love goes  
I go where true love goes
