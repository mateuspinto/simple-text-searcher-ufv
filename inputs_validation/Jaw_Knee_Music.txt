Johnny has a problem  
Johnny is out of control  
He had a TV party  
With the kids in the black hole  
Stealing peoples mail  
And lynching the landlord  
Things to do when angry young and bored  
  
Johnny was only a lad  
Johnny hates the scene  
First he hit an old man  
Then he hit and run Pauline  
The record player spinning the best times  
I never had  
So why do my old records make me sad  
  
Cause theyre so bad  
And no one seems to understand  
The glory of guitar  
When out of tune  
The off timing  
The singers who cant sing  
The beauty of love  
  
Hes a teenage vegetable  
This is the last resort  
Hes got PCP in his veins  
He lives inside a quart  
Johnny is a punk rocker  
Johnny is he queer  
Johnny needed two bags  
And a car to commandeer  
Johnny wasnt liked much  
But he had a lot of friends  
Waits on stage  
Eating ludes  
A mindless brainwashed pig  
Johnny was a good man  
Til the day that he got shot  
He had a jacked up Chevy  
That could blow you off the spot  
  
Johnny always needs  
More than he takes  
Forgets a couple chords  
Forgets a couple breaks  
Johnny says hes bound  
By only six strings to this world  
Johnny Quest hates sellout bands  
And Johnny puxors Ritalin  
And Johnny is an angry amputee
