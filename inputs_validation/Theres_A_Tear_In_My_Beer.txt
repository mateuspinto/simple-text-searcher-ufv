Theres a tear in my beer  
Cause Im cryin for you dear  
You are on my lonely mind  
Into these last nine beers  
I have shed a million tears  
You are on my lonely mind  
  
Im gonna keep drinkin  
Until Im petrified  
And then maybe these tears will leave my eyes  
Theres a tear in my beer  
Cause Im cryin for you dear  
You are on my lonely mind  
  
Last night I walked the floor  
And the night before  
You were on my lonely mind  
It seems my life is through  
And Im so dog gone blue  
You are on my lonely mind  
  
Im gonna keep drinkin  
Til I cant move a toe  
And then maybe my heart wont hurt me so  
Theres a tear in my beer  
Cause Im crying for you dear  
You are on my lonely mind  
  
Lord Ive tried and Ive tried  
But my tears I cant hide  
You are on my lonely mind  
All these blues that Ive found  
Have really got me down  
You are on my lonely mind  
  
Im gonna keep drinkin  
Til I cant even think  
Cause in the last week I aint slept a week  
Theres a tear in my beer  
Cause Im crying for you dear  
You are on my lonely mind
