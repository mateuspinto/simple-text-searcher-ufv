On the first day of March it was raining  
It was raining worse than anything that I have ever seen  
I drank ten pints of beer and I cursed all the people there  
And I wish that all this raining would stop falling down on me  
  
And its lend me ten pounds Ill buy you a drink  
And mother wake me early in the morning  
  
At the time I was working for a landlord  
And he was the meanest bastard that you have ever seen  
And to lose a single penny would grieve him awful sore  
And he was a miserable bollocks and a bitchs bastards whore  
  
And its lend me ten pounds Ill buy you a drink  
And mother wake me early in the morning  
  
I recall we took care of him one Sunday  
We got him out the back and we broke his fucking balls  
And maybe that was dreaming and maybe that was real  
But all I know is I left that place without a penny or fuck all  
  
And its lend me ten pounds Ill buy you a drink  
And mother wake me early in the morning  
  
But now Ive the most charming of verandahs  
I sit and watch the junkies the drunks the pimps the whores  
Five green bottles sitting on the floor  
I wish to Christ I wish to Christ  
That I had fifteen more  
  
And its lend me ten pounds Ill buy you a drink  
And mother wake me early in the morning  
  
And its lend me ten pounds Ill buy you a drink  
And mother wake me early in the morning  
  
The boys and me are drunk and looking for you  
Well eat your frigging entrails and we wont give a damn  
Me daddy was a blue shirt and my mother a madam  
And my brother earned his medals at Mai Lei in Vietnam  
  
And its lend me ten pounds and Ill buy you a drink  
And mother wake me early in the morning  
  
On the first day of March it was raining  
It was raining worse than anything that I have ever seen  
Stay on the other side of the road  
Cause you can never tell  
Weve a thirst like a gang of devils  
Were the boys of the county hell  
  
And its lend me ten pounds and Ill buy you a drink  
And mother wake me early in the morning  
  
And its lend me ten pounds and Ill buy you a drink  
And mother wake me early in the morning
