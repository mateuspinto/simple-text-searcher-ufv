Shell come shell go Shell lay belief on you  
Skin sweet with musky oil  
The lady from another grinning soul  
  
Cologne shell wear Silver and Americard  
Shell drive a beetle car  
And beat you down at cool Canasta  
  
And when the clothes are strewn dont be afraid of the room  
Touch the fullness of her breast Feel the love of her caress  
She will be your living end  
  
Shell come shell go Shell lay belief on you  
But she wont stake her life on you  
How can life become her point of view  
  
And when the clothes are strewn dont be afraid of the room  
Touch the fullness of her breast Feel the love of her caress  
  
She will be your living end  
She will be your living end  
She will be your living end  
She will be your living end  
She will be your living
