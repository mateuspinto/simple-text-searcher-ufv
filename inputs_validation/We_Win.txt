We overcome by Your Word  
Your Word will always prevail  
We overcome by the blood of the Lamb  
And the promise we have in You  
  
We lift our voice with a shout  
You always cause us to trumph  
We lift our hands like its already done  
For its already won by You  
  
Chorus  
We win because of You  
We overcome and conquer in Your name  
We win because of You  
All things are possible  
We win  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
We got the victory  
We got the victory  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
We got the victory  
Its all because of You  
We win  
  
Repeat Chorus
