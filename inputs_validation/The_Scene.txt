The Scene  
Graham Russell Mark Towner Williams Cliff Rehrig  
Its another lovely day  
Are we still so far away  
And how can I share it with you  
Its not easy to believe  
Are we both about to leave  
Without ever saying I do  
I still love you  
Chorus  
Just make me part of the scene  
Say were together always forever  
And everything else in between  
Just say were part of the scene  
I dont want to hear it I just couldnt bear it  
If things werent as good as they seem  
You can say Im not the one  
That a lot of faith has gone  
The bridges were never quite crossed  
Every grain of truth we deny or prove  
Is somewhere before it gets lost  
And is found again  
Repeat Chorus  
What if these feelings are all in my head  
Flying around me in a world of their own  
What if theres nothing that needs to be said  
Repeat Chorus  
Just say were part of the scene  
Say were together always forever  
And everything else in between  
Just say were part of the scene  
Just say were part of the scene  
Just say were part of the scene
