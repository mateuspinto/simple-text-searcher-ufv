Gonna tell you a story that you wont believe  
But I fell in love last Friday evenin  
With a girl I saw on a bar room TV screen  
Well I was just gettin ready to get my hat  
When she caught my eye and I put it back  
And I ordered myself a couple o more shots and beers  
  
Chorus  
The night you know that I fell in love with a Roller Derby Queen  
Round n round oh round n round  
The meanest hunk o woman  
That anybody ever seen  
Down in the arena  
  
She is a five foot six and two fifteen  
A bleachedblonde mama with a streak of mean  
She knew how to knuckle  
And she knew how to scuffle and fight  
And the roller derby program said  
That she were built like a fridgerator with a head  
The fans called her Tuffy  
But all her buddies called her Spike  
  
Chorus  
  
Round n round go round n round  
Round n round go round n round  
Round n round go round n round  
  
Well I could not help it but to fall in love  
With this heavyduty woman I been speakin of  
Things looked kind of bad  
Until the day she skated into my life  
  
Well she might be nasty she might be fat  
But I never met a person who would tell her that  
Shes my big blonde bomber  
My heavy handed Hackensack mama  
  
Chorus  
  
Round n round go round n round  
Round n round go round n round  
Round n round go round n round
