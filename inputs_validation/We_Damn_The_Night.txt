Blood in my pillow  
Blood in my skin  
Am I going mad  
Or was this a dream  
There in the depth  
The hollow souls wait  
Voices surround me  
Tempting my fate  
Then out of nowhere  
Figures in white  
Guarding my soul in the fight  
  
We are strong we realive  
We have faith in his might  
We believe in the everlasting light  
Anytime anywhere we will always be there  
We will fight for whats just and whats right  
We damn the night  
  
Out in the blackness  
Shivering cold  
Doubt takes on shape  
Fear the unknown  
Eyes of the fallen  
Piercing their glance  
Whispers of doom  
Left without chance  
Then out of nowhere  
Figures in white  
Shield my soul in the fight  
  
Were strong were alive  
We have faith in his might  
We believe in the everlasting light  
Anytime anywhere we will always be there  
We will fight for whats just and whats right  
We damn the night  
  
Were strong were alive  
We have faith in his might  
We believe in the everlasting light  
Anytime anywhere we will always be there  
We will fight for whats just and whats right  
We damn the night  
We damn the night  
We damn the night
