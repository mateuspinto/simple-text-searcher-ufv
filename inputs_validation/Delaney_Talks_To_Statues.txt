Delaney talks to statues  
As she dances round the pool  
She chases cats through roman ruins  
And stomps on big toadstools  
She speaks a language all her own  
That I cannot discover  
But she knows I love her so  
When I tuck her neath the covers  
  
Father daughter  
Down by the water  
Shells sink dreams float  
Lifes good on our boat  
  
Delaney draws me pictures  
She finger paints the sand  
We chase the dogs and hop like frogs  
Then I do my bad handstand  
Shes growing up too fast for me  
And asking lots of questions  
Some I know the answers to  
And some Im looking for suggestions  
  
Father daughter  
Born by the water  
Surfs up suns down  
Life in a beach town  
  
And some of the things Ive seen  
Maybe she wont have to see  
But theres a lot I want to pass along  
That was handed down to me  
  
Delaney talks to statues  
As she dances round the pool  
She chases cats through Roman ruins  
And stomps on big toadstools  
She speaks a language all her own  
Just a little like her mother  
And she knows I love her so  
When I tuck her neath the covers  
  
Father daughter  
Down by the water  
Shells sink dreams float  
Lifes good on our boat
