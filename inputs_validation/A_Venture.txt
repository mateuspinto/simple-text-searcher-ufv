Once a peaceful man laid his old head down by a river  
Thought about his childhood life his father and forgiver  
Couldnt hide away hide away  
  
He controlled the horses with a hand clap or a whisper  
Drink he couldnt combat but he knew he was no sinner  
Couldnt hide away hide away  
  
He told all his sons of all the antics of adventure  
Then he told another one who drove himself to drink  
Not to hide away hide away  
  
Better men have realized alone is not a venture  
A decent man would realize alone is not a venture  
Just to hide away hide away  
  
He told all his sons of all the antics of adventure  
Then he told another one who drove himself to drink  
Not to hide away hide away
