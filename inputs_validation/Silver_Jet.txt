Theres a still in the night a tuneless moonlight  
Just the I need you and heres whys  
Snoring Gords and Cheryls theres a heron outside  
Inviolate light theres an urge to go  
A shadow a heightened air of peril  
Your heart jumps too and my heart jumps too  
I think to myself I dont really know my heart  
And as you whisper me too  
Silver jet roars overhead rocks the nocturne  
All everglade and gray sheers  
Silver jet so far off already fought the hot spurs off  
All the way to Cape Spear  
Its quiet again when a car like Big Ben  
Radio dopplerin and for all you Gregory Peck fans  
Let us now praise famous men  
To take some pressure off the wondrous to fight and  
Your heart jumps to and my heart jumps too  
As if the wolves of North humberland themselves  
Were rumored to be en route  
Silver jet way overhead  
Yer an archipelago a satellite a green star  
Silver jet so far off already  
With your I need you and heres why flying to the next part  
Your heart jumps too and my heart jumps too  
Im thinking to myself packing is a secret heart  
And as you whisper me too  
Silver jet roars overhead  
Silver jet flying to the next part  
Silver jet so far off already  
Silver jet a satellite a green star  
Silver jet way overhead  
Silver jet everglade gray sheers  
Silver jet so far off already  
Silver jet Clayqout Sound and Cape Spear
