Spoken The King is pleased  
He is pleased with me  
My Lord and Master  
Declares hes pleased with me  
  
What does he mean  
What does he know of me  
This lord and master  
When he has looked at me what has he seen  
Something young  
Soft and slim  
Painted cheek  
Tapring limb  
Smiling lips  
All for him  
Eyes that shine  
Just for him  
So he thinks  
  
Just for him  
Though the man may be  
My Lord and Master  
Though he may study me  
As hard as he can  
The smile beneath my smile  
Hell never see  
Hell never know I love another man  
Hell never know I love another man
