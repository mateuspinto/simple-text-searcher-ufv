I see her walking in the velvet moonlight  
But then she hides behind the clock of midnight  
And as I look to see her face  
She disappears without a trace  
  
Sometimes I find myself in endless wandering  
When I awaken in the misty morning  
And I must look to find my way  
As I await the end of day  
Dream Lady  
Dream Lady  
  
And I await the end of day  
Til nighttime comes again to stay  
Dream lady  
Dream Lady  
Dream Lady
