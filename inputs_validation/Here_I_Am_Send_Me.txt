Oh Lord theres just so much to be done  
Oh Lord so many souls to be won  
Oh Lord this world is falling apart  
Dying for love from a broken heart  
  
Here am I send me though theres really not that much I can do  
What I have seems so small but I want to give it all to you  
  
Oh Lord you said the harvest was great  
But Lord looks like the workers are late  
Its getting hard to understand  
How they ignore your great command  
  
Here am I send me though you said the ones who labor are few  
Still my heart hears the call and I wanna give it all to you  
Oh to reach the ones nobody does  
Give up my pride and even work in the mud  
I wanna be like those who spilled their blood  
And gave it like water to you  
  
Oh Lord theres just so much to be done  
Oh Lord so many souls to be won  
It seem this world is falling apart  
Lord wont you send me  
  
Oh Lord theres just so much to be done  
Oh Lord so many souls to be won  
Oh Lord this world is falling apart  
Crying for love from a broken heart  
  
Here am I send me though theres really not that much I can do  
What I have seems so small but I want to give it all to you  
Here am I send me  
Though you said the ones youve chosen are few  
Still my heart hears you call  
And I wanna give it all to you
