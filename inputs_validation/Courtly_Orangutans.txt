Hop Frog  
Tomorrow is the seasonal ball  
I propose costumes for you  
and the honourable ministers to wear  
King  
Yes  
Hop Frog  
All dress as orangutans  
All your guests will run and scream  
with their mouths agape  
And try to hide  
And you Sire will have last laugh  
For such imperial cunning  
  
Hop Frog  
I will reach restore wrong  
I will torture you  
I will burn you  
Dead  
Tripitena  
My prince  
My prince  
You light a fire   
Burn monkeys  
Burn
