Here we are  
Safe at last  
We can breathe a sigh  
Seems the storm has passed  
  
Through it all  
No one knew  
That all the tears in heaven  
Would bring me back to you  
  
No one I know  
Imagined we would make it  
But it only made us glad we both believed  
  
You and me were a miracle  
  
Meant to be and nothing can change it  
Mountains move and oceans part  
when they are standing in our way  
You and me were a miracle  
Angels stand watching over us  
And heaven shines upon us everyday  
  
Everytime I felt near defeat  
You were there for me  
On my side completely  
You give me strength  
You set me free  
This is because of you  
Im all that I can be  
  
When Im with you  
The world is ours to reach for  
Together there is nothing we cant do  
  
You and me were a miracle  
  
Meant to be and nothing can change it  
Mountains move and oceans part  
when they are standing in our way  
You and me were a miracle  
Angels stand watching over us  
And heaven shines upon us everyday  
  
The chance was so unlikely  
That we would ever be  
Two stars above the heavens  
Destiny brought you to me  
  
You and me were a miracle  
You and me were a miracle  
Miracle
