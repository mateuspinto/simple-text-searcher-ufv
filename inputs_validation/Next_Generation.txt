Hold on now dont die now be strong now  
He said I was born a crack baby  
In a plastic bag in the alley  
Raised in a foster home  
With no mother to love and I never knew my papi  
Back in the days of Bobby McFerrin  
Used to sing dont worry be happy  
Lord how can I be happy  
When I dont even know my own family tree Lord  
  
We are the next generation we aint scared to die  
The only thing I fear is the after life  
Cause I dont know whats there on the other side  
But I pray the Lord forgives me gives me one more try  
  
Gang poppin things doing drivebys and angers  
Kids going to school putting fears in their teacher  
The teacher let them know that it aint all good  
Cause the gang was created to protect the neighborhood now  
All you red now all you blue now  
All you yellow now follow me now  
To that place of righteousness  
Where the only thing that matters is your consciousness he said  
  
We are the next generation we aint scared to die  
The only thing I fear is the after life  
Cause I dont know whats there on the other side  
But I pray the Lord forgives me gives me one more try  
  
In my fathers kingdom there are many mansions  
All the rooms are free there is no tax collection  
I can see Biggie Tupac Moses and Abraham  
Jason the one and twos jamming with the sun of man  
  
Ive been kicked Ive been stabbed  
Ive been shot Ive been  by a  
Person that I thought I trusted where I live  
Its a war at the cribs walk with a strap  
Myself cause I dont want nobodys son on my back  
My mind playing tricks  to really   
Me out in five unless I take another hit  
I done seen the sun set on the other side of town  
Now Im drifting in the darkness Heaven hold me down  
 but I know Im born dying  
Feel the tears of the angels looking down on me crying  
For a lying ass but yo forgive us in a while  
And Im sorry never let me forget that Im your child  
While Im locked up in this basement staring eye to eye with Satan  
In this cold dark world with no patience  
We get plotted on by agents with talks of replacing  
The Africans Jamaicans and the Haitians in this next generation  
  
We are the next generation we aint scared to die  
The only thing I fear is the after life  
Cause I dont know whats there on the other side  
But I pray the Lord forgives me gives me one more try  
  
Whoa we the next generation look at what we facing  
The kids raise themselves all kind of temptation  
Flowers and candles decorating all the pavements  
No the perpetrator aint seeing no arrangements  
Nobody cares about the feelings of the poor  
Man they suffer while we spending eighty billion on a war uh  
Cutting school budgets US stockmarket plummets  
Conditions only worse and I wonder what become it  
Metal detectors replace music classes  
Angry little kids want to beat their teachers asses  
The red and blues somebody gotta lose  
Reality TV be reality for who  
I dont question what the Lord found in me  
I just pass it on to folks with no boundaries  
Got a long road ahead of us AIDS already gettin us  
Now we got stars how many will there be left of us  
  
We are the next generation we aint scared to die  
The only thing I fear is the after life  
Cause I dont know whats there on the other side  
But I pray the Lord forgives me gives me one more try
