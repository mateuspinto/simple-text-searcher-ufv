Family  
  
Weve gotten word from Philadelphia  
Annas doing well shes making lots of money  
Her contract has been signed to do a solo turn  
It forbids her ever eating when or what she likes to eat  
She likes to eat she likes to eat  
  
Those are hard terms for little Anna  
Who has always been very greedy  
Oh if she does not break her contract  
Theres no market for hippos in Philadelphia  
  
Every single day they weigh her  
Gaining half an ounce means trouble  
They have principles to stand by  
Its a hundredandeighteen that were signed for   
Only for the weight agreed we pay  
Gaining half an ounce means trouble  
More than that would mean disaster  
  
But our Anna is not all that stupid  
And she knows a contract is a contract  
So shell reason After all  
You still can eat like little Anna  
In Louisiana  Crabmeat Porkchops  
Sweetcorn Chicken  
And those golden biscuits spread with honey  
  
Think of our house in Louisiana  
Look  its growing More and more it needs you  
Therefore curb your craving Gluttons will be punished  
Curb your craving Anna Gluttons never go to Heaven
