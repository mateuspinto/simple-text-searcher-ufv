Hear what I say  
See what I do  
Believe me now Im all over you  
All over you  
I know a place  
A certain very tender spot  
To have and to hold  
To have and have not  
Listening to the sad song that the radio plays  
Have we come this fafafa to find a soul cliche  
Let them talk  
Let them talk  
Let them all talk  
Oh yeah were killing time  
Just to keep you clocking on  
These are the best years of your life  
Now theyre here and gone  
Do the world a service  
And you could do yourself a favor  
Whose tongue now is tasting last weeks flavor  
Our day will come  
When you have squandered all your youth  
To have and to hold  
A stranger to the truth  
Listening to the sad song that the radio plays  
Have we come this fafafa to find a soul cliche  
Let them talk
