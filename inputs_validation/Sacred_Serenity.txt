Wherever we go whatever we do  
Your shadow is not far behind our steps  
And our breath  
Protecting and watching all  
Observing spirits on the wall  
What are they telling you  
  
Following all instincts that are pure  
Oblivious to time that may be the cure  
  
Sacred is the gift that they  
have without knowing  
Serenity is knowing its safe  
from destruction of time  
  
Maybe we could take a step back  
And discover what leads us to attack  
Time that is short  distance unknown  
For them each day life has just begun  
Observing spirits on the wall  
What are they telling you  
  
Following all instincts that are pure  
Oblivious to time that may be the cure  
  
Sacred is the gift that they  
have without knowing  
Serenity is knowing its safe  
from destruction of time
