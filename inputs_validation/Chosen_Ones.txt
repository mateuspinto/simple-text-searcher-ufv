You doubt your strength or courage  
Dont come to join with me  
For Deth surely wants you  
With sharp and pointy teeth  
An animal so vicious  
No others fought and won  
So on the fields of battle  
We are the chosen one  
Human bones blanket the dirt  
of the heathens lair  
That we must pass this den of deth  
  
The only path from here  
But I walk in the light  
The time to die has come  
No one shall take my life  
Im of the chosen ones  
Black shadows till the sky  
As the creatures eyes grow near  
Raise the shield of the holy pilgrims  
High into the air  
Heavens powers fill my arms  
Onward now to fight Im sent  
Oh the beast is coming  
To put you to the test  
  
Lookout  
Now this land is mine to pilage  
Rape and steal and take at will  
Never let you cross this path  
I reign for now I say to Kill
