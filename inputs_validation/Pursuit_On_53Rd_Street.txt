On a cross town bus in the city  
I spied a lady all dressed in black  
High heeled shoes and her dress cut loose  
Her front was saggin out on the rack  
I believe I believe  
That the ladys gonna bring me luck  
I believe I believe  
That the ladys gonna bring me luck  
Driver wont you stop this crazy machine  
And let my feet out and touch the ground  
Got to lay me a line on the lady  
Before she walks down the street too far  
I believe I believe  
That the ladys gonna bring me luck  
I believe I believe  
That the ladys gonna bring me luck  
Thats right  
Yes she has yes she has  
Watch me waking  
I believe I believe  
That the ladys gonna bring me luck  
I believe I believe  
That the ladys gonna bring me luck  
I know she bring some luck
