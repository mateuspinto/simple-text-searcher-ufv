You got away got away got away from me  
Now get away get away get away from me  
  
I couldnt grow just living in the shadow  
Where do you go when no ones following you  
You ran away ran away it was right on cue  
  
Shall I go on and on and on  
And on and on and on again  
  
Rosemary youre part of me  
You know you are you are you are  
Rosemary youre part of me  
You know you are you are you are  
Rosemary please pardon me  
  
Truth aint gonna change the way you lie  
Youth aint gonna change the way you die  
  
Dear Rosemary  
Dear Rosemary  
  
Youve got a way got a way got a way with things  
You got away got away got away with things  
  
False starts young hearts get shattered  
Pick up the pieces coming down around you  
You ran away ran away it was right on cue  
  
Can I go on and on and on  
And on and on and on again  
  
Rosemary youre part of me  
You know you are you are you are  
Rosemary youre part of me  
You know you are you are you are  
Rosemary please pardon me  
  
Truth aint gonna change the way you lie  
Youth aint gonna change the way you die  
  
This was no ordinary life  
This was no ordinary life  
This was no ordinary life  
This was no ordinary life  
  
Im here from now on  
But once Im gone  
Im gone  
  
Truth aint gonna change the way you lie  
Youth aint gonna change the way you die  
  
Dear Rosemary dear Rosemary  
Youre a part of me youre part of me

Please pardon me please pardon me
