I know you  
I care too  
I see through  
All of the pictures that you keep on the wall  
All of the people that will come to the ball  
But hear me calling  
Wont you give me  
A free ride  
  
I know too  
What you do  
When youre through  
Counting the cattle as they go by the door  
Keeping a carpet thats so thick on the floor  
But hear me calling  
Wont you give me  
A free ride  
  
I know you  
I care too  
I see through  
All of the pictures that you keep on the wall  
All of the people that will come to the ball  
But hear me calling  
Wont you give me  
A free ride
