Welcome to where time stands still  
No one leaves and no one will  
Moon is full never seems to change  
Just labeled mentally deranged  
Dream the same thing every night  
I see our freedom in my sight  
No locked doors no windows barred  
No things to make my brain seem scarred  
  
Sleep my friend and you will see  
That dream is my reality  
They keep me locked up in this cage  
Cant they see its why my brain says rage  
  
Sanitarium leave me be  
Sanitarium just leave me alone  
  
Build my fear of whats out there  
And cannot breathe the open air  
Whisper things into my brain  
Assuring me that Im insane  
They think our heads are in their hands  
But violent use brings violent plans  
Keep him tied it makes him well  
Hes getting better cant you tell  
  
No more can they keep us in  
Listen damn it we will win  
They see it right they see it well  
But they think this saves us from our Hell  
  
Sanitarium leave me be  
Sanitarium just leave me alone  
Sanitarium just leave me alone  
  
Fear of living on  
Natives getting restless now  
Mutiny in the air  
Got some death to do  
Mirror stares back hard  
Kill its such a friendly word  
Seems the only way  
For reaching out again
