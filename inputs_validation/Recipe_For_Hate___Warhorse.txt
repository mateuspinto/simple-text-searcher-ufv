Each day my shortcomings pick my pockets  
My faults were letters carved in stone  
As meaningful to you as words written in water  
Im left to walk this world alone  
  
In a broken mold they made me  
The black sheep of the family  
Worth less than zero my opinion  
And room temperature IQ  
  
I did something now Im nothing  
Always wrong with this or that  
Poisoned with fear watch it twist  
My measly brain mad  
  
Talk about me when my bac is turned  
Next time we meet it will be to late  
The memory burned in my ears of what you said  
And now Ive got a recipe for hate Taste it  
  
Dark clouds on the horizon  
Make it hard to breathe  
A walking mistake but every time  
I run away I just come back for more  
  
The choice is clear I can quit  
And fall on my sword or light a fire  
To see who runs or stays  
And plays the confidence game  
  
Warhorse  
Im feeling quite invisible  
I feel just like thin air  
The truth taunts me  
  
I see the earth below me  
I watch it spinning there  
Does someone somewhere  
Out there hear me  
  
Sentenced to walk in Purgatory  
My life is running down  
I cant believe what theyve done to me  
  
Im left riding a Warhorse  
A man without a country
