They wokw up early on Christmas morning  
They saw the presents all around the tree  
It was everything they ever wanted  
They were happy as happy can be  
  
All at once something caught their eye  
On the floor neath the stockings on the chimmey  
It was certainly a big surprise  
Everyone wondered what could it be  
  
Chorus  
It was red and then green  
Silver then gold  
Hard to explain but a sight to behind  
A magical shimmering whirling delight  
And maybe it was meant for children to find  
Or something that Santa Claus left behind  
  
So incredible and so exciting  
As the followed it around the roon  
But it was late and they were getting sleepy  
Christmas Day had ended too soon  
  
And when they woke up in the morning  
They tried to find it but it disappeared  
Mother said dont be disappointed  
Maybe youii find it again next year  
  
Chorus  
  
The moral of the story  
When youre going to bed tonight  
If you dream and you just believe it  
It just might come true  
It could happen to you
