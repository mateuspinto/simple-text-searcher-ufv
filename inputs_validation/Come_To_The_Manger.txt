Come come  
Come to the manger  
Children  
Come to  
The childrens King  
Sing sing  
Chorus of angels  
Stars of morning  
Over Bethlehem sing  
  
He lies mid  
The beasts  
Of the stall  
Who is Maker  
And Lord of us all  
The wintry wind  
Blows cold and deary  
See  
He weeps  
The world is weary  
Lord have pity  
And mercy on me  
  
Come come  
Come to the manger  
Children  
Come to  
The childrens King  
Sing sing  
Chorus of angels  
Stars of morning  
Over Bethlehem sing  
  
He leaves all  
His glory behind  
To be born and to die  
For mankind  
With grateful beasts  
His cradle chooses  
Thankless man  
His love refuses  
Lord have pity  
And mercy on me  
  
Come come  
Come to the manger  
Children  
Come to  
The childrens King  
Sing sing  
Chorus of angels  
Stars of morning  
Over Bethlehem sing  
  
To Bethlehems  
Manger now come  
To the Savior  
Emmanuels home  
The heavnly hosts  
Above are singing  
Set  
The Christmas bells  
Aringing  
Lord have pity  
And mercy on me  
  
Come come  
Come to the manger  
Children  
Come to  
The childrens King  
Sing sing  
Chorus of angels  
Stars of morning  
Over Bethlehem sing
