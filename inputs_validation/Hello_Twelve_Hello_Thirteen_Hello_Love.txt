Hello twelve hello thirteen hello love  
Changes oooh  
Down below up above  
Time to doubt  
  
To break out its a mess  
Its a mess  
Time to grow time to go  
Hello hello  
  
Too young to take over  
Too old to ignore  
Gee Im almost ready  
But What For  
  
Theres a lot I am not certain of  
Hello twelve hello thirteen hello love  
Lalalala  
  
Goodbye twelve goodbye thirteen  
Hello love  
Robert Goulet Robert Goulet My God Robert Goulet  
Oh Down below up above  
Playing doctor with Evelyn  
La la la  
Ill show you mine  
La la  
You show me yours  
La la  
Seeing Daddys naked  
Time to grow  
Time to go  
La la la  
Mom and Dad were doing it  
Theres a lot I am not certain of  
Hello twelve hello thirteen hello love  
Hello twelve hello thirteen hello love
