Holy spirit touch your people  
Teach us the ways of god  
As we live as jesus did  
You are in awe and lifted up  
Theres a stirring in the spirit  
There an urgency in this sound  
We as children must obey  
Can you hear the footsteps of god  
God is movinggod is moving  
Can you hear the sound of revival  
God is moving god is moving  
Can you hear the sound of revival  
as we praise you lord  
As we praise you as we sing  
Youre drawn into our soul god  
As we cry out for this nation  
Pour out revival in this land  
Theres a stirring in the spirit  
There an urgency in this sound  
We as children must obey  
Can you hear the footsteps of god  
God is movinggod is moving  
Can you hear the sound of revival  
God is moving god is moving
