Heat grows in his mind  
Hits the steering wheel to tryin  
Tune the radio out loud  
  
He heard Jobim say  
And his heart began to sway  
He didnt think of anything  
But his baby  
  
He was drivin  
Keep on drivin  
He kept drivin down Brazil  
  
He feels batucada  
He dances the samba  
If only in his head  
  
Chorus  
He was drivin down Brazil  
All pimped up and dressed to kill  
A thousand single dollar bills  
In his low ride Bonneville  
He was drivin down Brazil  
  
He was drivin down Brazil  
And he gave the girls a thrill  
In his low ride bonneville  
Hes the king king of the hill  
He was drivin down Brazil  
  
Shhh shut up and get your baby  
Please comma comma get your baby  
Please comma comma get your baby  
Shes waiting  
  
He cruised up to the light  
She jumps in by his side  
They kiss and wave goodbye oh  
  
They had so much to say  
But the groove began to play  
He couldnt think of anything but his baby  
  
He was drivin  
He kept on on drivin  
He was drivin down Brazil  
  
He dreams of Amanda  
While he sips guarana  
In his mind shes dressed in red  
If anything  
  
Chorus  
  
He was drivin down Brazil  
And he gave the girls a thrill  
In his low ride bonneville  
Hes the king king of the hill  
He was drivin down Brazil

He feels batucada he dances the samba  
If only in his head  
Makes me crazy  
  
He was drivin down Brazil  
All pimped up and dressed to kill  
A thousand single dollar bills  
In his low ride Bonneville  
He was drivin down Brazil  
  
He was drivin down Brazil  
All pimped up and dressed to kill  
A thousand single dollar bills  
In his low ride Bonneville  
He was drivin down Brazil
