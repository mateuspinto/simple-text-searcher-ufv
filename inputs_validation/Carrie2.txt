When lights go down  
I see no reason  
For you to cry  
Weve been througth this before  
In every time in every season  
God knows Ive tried  
So please dont ask for more  
Can you see it in my eyes  
That this might be our last Good Bye  
Carrie Carrie  
Things they change my friend  
Carrie Carrie  
Maybe will meet Again Somewhere Again  
I read your mind with no intention  
I feel unkind I wish I could explain  
It all takes time oh lot of passion  
If is a crime how can I feel no pain  
Can you see it in my eyes  
That this might be our last good bye  
Carrie Carrie  
Things they change my friend  
Carrie Carrie  
Maybe will meet Again  
Can you see it my eyes  
That this might be our last good bye  
Carrie carrie  
Things that change Carrie Carrie Carrie  
Maybe will meet again somewhere again  
When Lights go Down
