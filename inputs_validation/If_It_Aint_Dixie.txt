Oh I love those Colorado Rockies  
And that big starry Montana sky  
And the lights of San Francisco  
On a California night  
Enjoyed those ballgames in Chicago  
On those windy afternoons  
It s a big beautiful country  
But I m never home too soon  
If it ain t Dixie it won t do  
  
If it ain t Dixie it don t feel quite like home  
My southern blood runs deep and true  
I ve had good times  
North of the line  
I ve got a lot of good friends too  
But if it ain t Dixie it won t do  
It won t do  
  
When the leaves turn in New England  
I love the chill that s in the air  
I ve walked the New York City sidewalks  
Had a big time in Times Square  
But now my wheels are rollin southward  
And heaven s comin into view  
Homesweethome is Alabama  
That s what I look forward to  
  
If it ain t Dixie it don t feel quite like home  
My southern blood runs deep and true  
I ve had good times  
North of the line  
I ve got a lot of good friends too  
If it ain t Dixie it won t do  
It won t do  
  
If it ain t Dixie  
Oh no Oh nowhoah  
  
Now my wheels are rollin southward  
And heaven s comin into view  
Homesweethome is Alabama  
That s what I look forward to  
  
Y all come to Dixie
