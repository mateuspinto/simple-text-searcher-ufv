Delight  
See our faces are both shining  
And Ive never felt so wanted  
Than when you cling with arms and legs  
  
I tremble  
You crush my burning lips like ashes  
With so much skin to travel over  
While my head spins and you knew it would  
  
And oh what a storm  
And oh what a storm  
  
We shelter in our skin storm  
  
I feel  
Feel your breath burn on my body  
You touch my senses tingling brightly  
Slipandsliding into heaven  
  
Love could be a wonderful emotion  
With such a rush of pleasure motion  
When Im dancing on our skin  
  
And oh what a storm  
And oh what a storm  
  
We shelter in our skin storm  
  
And oh what a storm  
And oh what a storm  
  
We shelter in our skin storm
