You dont know a thing about their lives  
They live where you wouldnt dare to drive  
You shake as you think of how they sleep  
But you write as if you all lie side by side  
Reader meet Author  
With the hope of hearing sense  
But you may be feeling let down  
By the words of defense  
He says Noone ever sees me when I cry  
  
You dont know a thing about their lives  
Books dont save them books arent Stanley knives  
And if a fight broke out here tonight  
Youd be the first away because youre that type  
And the year two thousand wont change anyone here  
As each fabled promise flies so fast  
Youll swear it was never there  
Oh have you ever escaped from a shipwrecked life  
  
So safely with your software miles from the front line  
You hear the way their sad voice sings and you start to imagine things  
Oh any excuse to write more lies
