The day the Circus of Heaven came to town  
Local folks lined the streets in a Midwestern town  
Waiting anxiously for the parade to begin all around  
On the very last day  
  
A unicorn headed the mystical way  
Surrounded by what seemed a thousand golden angels at play  
Behind were Centaurs elves bright fairies all in colors of jade  
On the very final day  
  
For what seemed only just a moment in time  
Seven solemn flying silvered regal horses rode by  
Seven golden chariots in tow a wonder to behold  
The Seven Lords of the Mountains of Time  
There then arose where nothing really stood there before  
A giant tent rising one thousand feet high from the floor  
Towns people flocked inside with their eyes all amazed  
To greet the Seventh Lord of the seventh age  
A fanfare rang out in an incredible sound  
Bringing out the strangest visions perfect harmony round  
Any dreams he asked would they like to have seen  
From historical or mythical scenes  
  
Then there above their heads just as vivid as life  
Each vision transported multitudes inventing light  
Grecian galleons the sack of Troy to the Gardens of Babylon  
A play of millions roared along  
The gigantic dreams of Alexander the Great  
Civil wars where brothers fought and killed their friendship with hate  
All seen by Zeus performing scenes in the magical way  
The day the circus came to town  
  
Outside great animals as tame as the trees  
Angels high in starlight dancing streets  
Turning their colors with indigo and gold  
Dropping violet red and emerald snow  
As the circus finally changed its invisible course  
A new world to be found  
  
On the dreamy ground we walked upon  
I turned to my son and said  
Was that something beautiful amazing wonderful extraordinary  
beautiful  
  
Oh It was OK But there were no clowns no tigers lions or bears
