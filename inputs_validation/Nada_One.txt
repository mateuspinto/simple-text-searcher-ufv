Fire eye flashin bright  
Come again into my dream tonight  
Dont fade away when the mornin comes  
Fadin in the sun  
Nada One Nada One  
  
Moon shone silver in your eye  
Shown on my midnight blues from the sky  
Paint the night with love till the burnin sun  
See the colors run  
Nada One Nada One  
  
Mornin come down on me  
Wanderin through the endless street  
Nobody seein where Ive been  
Nobody feels what Ive done  
Nada One Nada One  
  
Look inside I find  
Your song flows around my mind  
You are as real as I feel  
You are the moon in my sun  
Nada One Nada One
