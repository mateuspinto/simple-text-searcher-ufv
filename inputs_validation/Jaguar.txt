Grace space race  
Everything theyve seen you have seen  
Everywhere theyve been you have been  
Everything theyve done you have been and done already  
  
Every lovely spot near or far  
You can reach them too in your car  
Or you might be there now if you own a jag already  
  
The radio blasting the girls are glancing  
The dash is dancing with gleaming dials  
  
Grace space race  
Grace space race  
Jaguar jaguar jaguar jaguar
