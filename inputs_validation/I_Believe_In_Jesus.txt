Ran into mother Mary down on line  
Street in LA  
She was preaching the gospel  
She was singing how Jesus saves  
When a crowd of passing tourists  
Looked to see what they could see  
You know before they know it she had  
Them all down on their knees  
I believe in Jesus you know I know him  
Oh so well  
And Im going to heaven by and by  
cause I already been through hell  
I believe in Jesus in Jesus in Jesus  
I believe in Jesus in Jesus  
So onward Christian soldiers still  
Marching as to war  
With the cross of Jesus just going on before  
Now Jesus was a little lamb his fleece  
Was white as snow  
And every where that Jesus went  
This lamb is sure to go  
Well I believe in Jesus you know I know him  
Oh so well  
And Im going to heaven by and by  
cause I saved my soul from going to hell  
I believe in Jesus in Jesus in Jesus  
I believe in Jesus in Jesus  
Look at the sheep cause theyre  
Running fast  
They wanna make it through the gates  
At last  
So onward Christian soldiers still  
Marching as to war  
With the cross of Jesus just going on before  
I believe in Jesus in Jesus  
I believe in Jesus in Jesus
