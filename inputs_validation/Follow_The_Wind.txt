Im so weary from holding this load  
But its only love for you that I walk this lonely road  
I must follow the wind follow the wind  
And the wind will take me hold before the cold  
  
Every stay I have counted  
Each flower I have seen  
But the place where Im going theres no grass as green  
I must follow the wind follow the wind  
And the wind will take me home where I can dream  
  
In the hour I am lonely youre love will be mine  
I will stay in your arms dear until comes the time  
I must be on my way for my home is anywhere  
I have no time to stay I have no time to care  
I must follow the wind follow the wind  
As the wind gently blows in my hair  
  
I must follow the wind follow the wind  
As the wind gently blows in my hair  
I must follow the wind follow the wind  
As the wind gently blows in my hair
