Doctor my eyes have seen the years  
And the slow parade of fears without crying  
Now I want to understand  
  
I have done all that I could  
To see the evil and the good without hiding  
You must help me if you can  
  
Doctor my eyes  
Tell me what is wrong  
Was I unwise to leave them open for so long  
  
Cause I have wandered through this world  
And as each moment has unfurled  
Ive been waiting to awaken from these dreams  
People go just where they will  
I never noticed them until I got this feeling  
That its later than it seems  
  
Doctor my eyes  
Tell me what you see  
I hear their cries  
Just say if its too late for me  
  
Is it too late  
Is it too late for me  
Tell me doctor  
Doctor my eyes  
Cannot see the sky  
Is this the price for having learned how not to cry
