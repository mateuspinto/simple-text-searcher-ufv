I had to escape  the city was sticky and cruel  
Maybe I should have called you first  
But I was dying to get to you  
  
I was dreaming while I drove  
The long straight road ahead  
Uhhuh yeah  
  
Could taste your sweet kisses your arms open wide  
This fever for you was just burning me up inside  
  
I drove all night to get to you  
Is that all right  
I drove all night crept in your room  
Woke you from your sleep to make love to you  
Is that all right  
I drove all night  
  
What in this world keeps us from falling apart  
No matter where I go  
I hear the beating of our one heart  
I think about you when the night is cold and dark  
Uhhuh yeah  
  
No one can move me the way that you do  
Nothing erases this feeling between me and you  
I drove all night to get to you  
Is that all right  
  
I drove all night crept in your room  
Woke you from your sleep to make love to you  
Is that all right  
I drove all night  
  
Could taste your sweet kisses your arms open wide  
This fever for you was just burning me up inside  
  
I drove all night to get to you  
Is that all right  
I drove all night crept in your room  
Is that all right  
I drove all night
