Oh its crying time again  
Youre gonna leave me  
I can see that faraway look in your eyes  
I can tell by the wayyou hold me darling  
That it wont be long  
Before its crying time  
Oh they say that absence makes  
The heart grow fonder  
fonder  
And that tears are on their way  
To make love grow  
grow  
Well my love foryou could never  
Never never never grow no stronger  
stronger  
If I live to be a hundred  
And I say a hundred years old  
Oh you say that youve found someone  
You love better  
Thats the way its happened  
Every time before  
before  
And as sure as the sun comes out tomorrow  
tomorrow  
Crying time will start  
When you walk out  
When you walk out my door  
Oh its crying time again  
Youre gonna leave me  
I can feel it now  
I can see that faraway look in your eyes  
I can feel it now  
I can see it baby inyour eyes  
I can tell by way you hold me darling  
That it wont be long before its crying time  
No it wont be long before its crying time
