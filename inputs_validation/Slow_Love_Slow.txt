Come and share  
This painting with me  
Unveiling of me  
The magician that never failed  
  
This deep sigh  
Cover all my chest  
Intoxicated by  
A major chord  
  
I wonder do I love you  
  
Slow love slow  
Only the weak  
Are not lonely  
  
Southern blue  
Morning dew  
Let down your guards  
I love you  
Ice cream castels  
Lips to ear rhymes  
A slumber deeper than time  
  
Slow love slow  
Only the weak  
Are not lonely  
  
Sloooow slow love slow  
Slow love slooooooow  
Slow slow hum hooo hum huuuuum
