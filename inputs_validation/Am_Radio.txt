Clip of old radio broadcast  
sungKHJ Los Angeles  
spoken Portions of todays programming are reproduced by means of
electrical transcriptions or tape recordings  
Clip of Motown song Mr Big Star fades into lyrics  
You can hear the music  
Of the AM radio  
  
The VCR and the DVD  
There was none of that crap  
Back in 1970  
We didnt know about a  
World Wide Web  
It was a whole different game  
Playin back when  
I was a kid  
  
Want to get down in a cool way  
Picture yourself on a beautiful day  
Big bell bottoms and groovy long hair  
Just walkin in style with a portable CD player  
No youd listen to the music on the  
  
AM radio AM radio  
Yeah you could hear the music on the  
AM radio AM radio  
  
Flashback 72  
Another summer in the neighborhood  
Hanging out with nothing to do  
Sometimes we go driving around  
In my sisters pinto  
Cruising with the windows rolled down  
We listen to the radio station  
We were too damn cool  
To buy the eight track tape  
There wasnt any good time  
To want to be inside  
My mama want to watch that TV  
All goddamn night  
  
Id be in bed with the radio on  
I would listen to it all night long  
Just to hear my favorite song  
Youd have to wait till you could hear it on the  
  
AM radio AM radio  
Yeah you could hear the music on the  
AM radio AM radio  
I can still hear Mama say  
Boy turn that radio down  
  
Spoken Aw Mom Not that show again I dont want to watch that show Cant
we watch Good Times or Chico and the Man or something cool Turn it off  
  
Things changed back in 75  
We were all growing up on the in and the outside  
We got in trouble with the police man  
We got busted getting high in the back of my friends van  
I remember 1977  
I started going to concerts and I saw the Led Zeppelin  
I got a guitar on Christmas day  
I dreamed that Jimmy Page would come to  
Santa Monica to teach me to play  
Teach me to play  
  
There isnt any place that I need to go  
There isnt anything that I need to know  
That I did not learn on the radio  
  
Everything gets stupid and I just dont know  
Where to find my happy I listen to my music on the  
AM radio AM radio  
You can hear the music on the  
AM radio AM radio  
You can hear the music on the  
AM radio AM radio  
Spoken I like pop I like soul I like rock but I never liked disco I
like pop I like soul I like rock but I never liked disco We like pop we
like soul we like rock but we never liked disco  
  
No never liked disco  
No never liked disco  
No never liked disco  
No never liked disco
