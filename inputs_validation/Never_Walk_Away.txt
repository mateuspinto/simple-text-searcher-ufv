Verse 1  
So young in love  
They couldnt wait  
Said their vows  
Had to run away  
Suddenly  
They felt their lives  
Had changed  
They believed  
Their hearts were strong  
Just to find  
They couldnt get along  
The dream they shared  
Had slowly come undone  
  
Chorus  
Will she go  
Or will she stay  
Fool herself for  
One more day  
Dont give up  
Never walk away  
Loves the promise  
That he made  
In his heart  
It still remains  
Dont give up  
Never walk away  
  
Verse 2  
They had to meet  
Somewhere halfway  
Heart to heart and  
Face to face  
Compromise  
A price they had to pay  
Cared enough  
To stand her ground  
Screamed and shouted  
Till the walls came down  
Worth the fight  
To see a brand new day  
  
Chorus  
Will she go  
Or will she stay  
Fool herself for one more day  
Dont give up  
Never walk away  
Loves the promise that he made  
In his heart  
It still remains  
Dont give up  
Never walk away  
  
Chorus  
Will she go  
Or will she stay  
Fool herself for one more day  
Dont give up  
Never walk away  
Loves the promise that he made  
In his heart  
It still remains  
Dont give up  
Never walk away  
  
Never walk away  
  
Ooohhh  
  
Never walk away
