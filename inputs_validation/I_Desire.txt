Here in this world that youve designed  
From the rolling plains to the oceans  
Deep and wide  
Where are the words that can say whats  
In my heart  
All that I am is amazed by who you are  
  
Chorus  
The one thing I desire  
Is just to know you more  
To live a life that moves and breathes  
And loves to bring you joy  
So fill me with a fire  
That burns away my doubts and all my fears  
Into a place where you are all I hear  
Its the one thing I desire  
To do what you require  
Is the one thing I desire  
  
To love when Id rather turn away  
To give when Im more resigned to take  
To reach out a hand to someone who  
Feels alone  
The way you reached for me  
When there seemed to be no hope  
  
Chorus  
  
Ill live my life serving Christ  
Offering a sacrifice of praise  
  
Chorus
