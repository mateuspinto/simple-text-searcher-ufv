Once upon a time  
There was a family  
Singing through the streets of Europe  
Singing their dear heartsongs  
  
Chorus They went with open heart to every corner  
Every street every land every town through Europe  
  
Then came along a young man  
Saying what can I do  
To help you through  
To help you through my dear Europe  
He came through the rain  
Through the storm through the sorrow  
Through the hard times we had  
The prince of Europe  
  
Chorus  
  
So he knocked on the door  
The door of my heart  
He won my heart he won my love  
And my fidelity my prince of Europe  
So here I am  
Your wife forever  
Im on my knees  
I promise you love  
I promise you love with full fidelity  
My prince of Europe  
  
Chorus
