Sailors have the seven seas and four strong winds that blow  
Drifters have the next town down the road  
Gamblers have the chance to bet the ace thats in the hole  
Soldiers have the hope of coming home  
  
Chorus  
And the flowers have the early April rain  
Believers have what they have never seen  
And the dreamers have tomorrow if today does not come true  
You have eyes that shine and I have you  
  
Heroes have their names engraved forever in a stone  
Hermits have their peace of mind alone  
Lovers have each other and a small slice of the moon  
God still bless the child who has his own  
  
Chorus x 2
