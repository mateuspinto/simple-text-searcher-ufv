Be an angel be an angel  
And treat me real sweet  
Be an angel and bless me with your love  
Be an angel be an angel  
I kneel at your feet  
Be an angel and touch me with your love  
  
Youre a joy and heaven on earth to me  
You are all the poems in history  
Be an angel be an angel  
And make life complete  
Be an angel and bless me with your love  
  
Youre a joy and heaven on earth to me  
You are all the poems in history  
Be an angel be an angel  
And make life complete  
Be an angel and bless me with your love
