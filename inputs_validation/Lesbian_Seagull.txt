Over rocks and trees and sand  
Soaring over cliffs  
And gently floating down to land  
She proudly lifts her voice  
To sound her mating call  
And soon her mate responds by singing  
Caw Caw Caw  
Come with me  
Lesbian Seagull  
Settle down and rest with me  
Fly with me lesbian seagull  
To my little nest by the sea  
With me thats where you belong with me  
I know I can be strong when youre with me  
She skims the water  
At the new time to seek  
Her fish and she emerges  
With one squirming in her beak  
She plays among the waves  
And hides between the swells  
She walks the beach at twilight  
Searching for some shells  
Come with me  
Lesbian Seagull  
Settle down and rest with me  
Oh fly with me lesbian seagull  
To my little nest by the sea  
With me thats where you belong with me  
I know I can be strong when youre  youre with me  
And in the evening  
As they watch the setting sun  
She loooks at her as if to say  
The day is done  
Its time to find their shelter  
Hidden in the dunes  
And fall asleep the  
Music of the moon  
You and me  
Lesbian seagull  
You just watch the world oh my  
Just you and me lesbian seagull  
Side by side with me till we die  
Till we die  
You and I  
We can make it if we try  
Our love will keep us flyin high  
Until we die
