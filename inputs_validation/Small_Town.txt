Well I was born in a small town  
And I live in a small town  
Probably die in a small town  
Oh those small communities  
  
All my friends are so small town  
My parents live in the same small town  
My job is so small town  
Provides little opportunity  
  
Educated in a small town  
Taught the fear of Jesus in a small town  
Used to daydream in that small town  
Another boring romantic thats me  
  
But Ive seen it all in a small town  
Had myself a ball in a small town  
Married an LA doll and brought her to this small town  
Now shes small town just like me  
  
No I cannot forget where it is that I come from  
I cannot forget the people who love me  
Yeah I can be myself here in this small town  
And people let me be just what I want to be  
  
Got nothing against a big town  
Still hayseed enough to say  
Look whos in the big town  
But my bed is in a small town  
Oh and thats good enough for me  
  
Well I was born in a small town  
And I can breathe in a small town  
Gonna die in this small town  
And thats probably where theyll bury me
