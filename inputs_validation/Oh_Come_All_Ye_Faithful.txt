O come all ye faithful  
Joyful and triumphant  
O come ye  
O come ye to Bethlehem  
Come and behold Him  
Born the King of Angels  
O come let us adore Him  
O come let us adore Him  
O come let us adore Him  
Christ the Lord  
  
O Sing  
Choirs of angels  
Sing in exultation  
Sing all  
That hear in heaven  
Gods holy word  
Give to our Father  
Glory in the Highest  
O come let us adore Him  
O come let us adore Him  
O come let us adore Him  
Christ the Lord  
  
All Hail  
Lord we greet Thee  
Born this happy morning  
O Jesus  
For evermore  
Be Thy name adored  
Word of the Father  
Now in flesh appearing  
O come let us adore Him  
O come let us adore Him  
O come let us adore Him  
Christ the Lord
