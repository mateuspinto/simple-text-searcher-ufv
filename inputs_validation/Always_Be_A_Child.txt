Always Be A Child  
Words and Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
I was there  
When you drew the breath of life  
And I could hear your voice  
The first time that you cried  
And though you couldnt see Me  
I was very near  
And theres something now  
That I want you to hear  
Chorus  
You will always be a child  
In my eyes  
And when you need some love  
My arms are open wide  
And even when youre growing old  
I hope you realize  
You will always be a child  
In my eyes  
I was there the first time  
That you prayed  
And I heard  
All the promises you made  
And when you fell before Me  
Crying Father I have sinned  
I picked you up  
And held you close again  
Chorus repeat
