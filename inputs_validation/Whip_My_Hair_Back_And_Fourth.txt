I was on my way to school  
I doz me  
I hopped out the drop  
Grabbed my juicy  
I hopped skipped and  
Jumped past the  
Hoopdies But wait  
I forgot to grab my loose  
Leaf I doubled right back b  
Back like whos that  
I did a little dance like  
Cat booom boom cat  
I love how the  
Jocks be watching me me  
So I grab my crotch and say hehe  
I be like bum diggity bum  
When I pop my gum  
They lookin dumb  
Digetty dumb  
Think they stopin something  
I said excuse me honey  
Im bbugs bunny  
Elmer Fud aint got my carrots  
So he aiint got nothing for me  
Cause we the mean girls  
Yyes we so fetch  
And when we in the yard  
Be jumping double dutch  
We back to the future  
Pearl ya with da best
