I was a man of convinction  
Itchin in pure overdrive  
Burning both ends of the candle  
Searching for meaning in life  
Until that one night when it happened  
You took my soul by surprise  
And suddenly I knew the answer  
There in the blue of your eyes  
I learned it  
  
I learned it all from you  
I learned it all from you  
I heard it all ring true  
Everything I ever knew  
I learned it all from you  
  
My body flew back through the ages  
Where sages all wrote in stone  
You showed me what I was missing  
You helped me to find my way home  
I learned it  
  
I learned it all from you  
I learned it all from you  
I heard it all ring true  
Everything I ever knew  
I learned it all from you  
  
I learned it all from you  
I learned it all from you  
I heard it all ring true  
Everything I ever knew  
I learned it all from  
I learned it  
  
I learned it all from you  
I learned it all from you  
I heard it all ring true  
Everything I ever knew  
I learned it all from you
