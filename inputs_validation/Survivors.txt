I never meant to break your heart please forgive me  
  
No I never meant to hold you back  
I never meant to turn away  
Please forgive me  
  
I never meant to break your heart  
Id give my last breath before I do  
Please forgive me  
  
No I never meant to hold you down  
I never meant to break your heart  
Somehow somehow  
We are survivors  
  
No I never meant to hold you back  
I never meant to turn away  
Here we are standing here  
Survivors in the night  
  
No I never meant to break your heart  
Ill always be here for you  
Heres my word take my hand  
Survivors in the night  
  
No I never meant to let you down  
Id give my last breath before I do  
All I ever wanted was to be right here  
Survivors in the night  
  
When all is said and done  
Well find a way  
To put all this behind us  
Well find some way  
Cause you know that I wont be leaving  
Yes Im here and I wont be leaving  
  
No I never meant to cause you pain  
No I never meant to hurt you  
All I want to do now is to try my best  
Survivors in the night  
  
When all is said and done  
Well find someday  
We can forget all this  
Somehow some way  
  
And as long as Im here  
Therell be no worries any more  
And all these promises Im making now  
Ill hold each day  
  
So dont ever dont ever dont forget  
That I never never meant to break your heart  
All I ever wanted was to stand beside you  
Survivors in the night  
  
We are survivors in the night
