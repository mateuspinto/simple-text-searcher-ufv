Look at how they stop and stare  
As if theyve never seen a heart in love  
And though I see them I dont care  
cause Im too busy thinking bout our love  
Thinking about that each and every morning  
I wake up to that love glow in your eyes  
And though it seems Im hooked on this fixation  
I will not stop my daydreaming  
Until my nights are true with you  
Ooh baby my love is on fire  
Ooh baby my heart is on the wild  
Ooh baby Im burning with desire  
I want to feel your love  
I need to feel your love mixed with mine  
Listen at me call your name  
As if youre witness to my every word  
And though it seems sometimes insane  
Something within me tells me theyll be heard  
So I wait so patiently the moment  
When my love fantasies will come to life  
And all I need from you is confirmation  
Then Ill be living truth those moments  
That I long with you  
Ooh baby my love is on fire  
Ooh baby my heart is on the wild  
Ooh baby Im burning with desire  
I want to feel your love  
I need to feel your love mixed with mine  
On flute Hubert Laws  
And all I need from you is confirmation  
Then Ill be living truth those moments  
That I long with you  
Ooh baby my love is on fire  
Ooh baby my heart is on the wild  
Ooh baby Im burning with desire  
I want to feel your love  
I need to feel your love mixed with mine

Cant cha feel the pulsation of my heart  
Cant cha feel the fire burning
