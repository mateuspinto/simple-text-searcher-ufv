I went down to Captain Tonys  
To get out of the heat  
I heard a voice call out to me  
Son come have a seat  
I had to search my memory  
As I looked into those eyes  
Our lives changed like the weather  
But a legend never dies  
  
Chorus  
He said I ate the last mango in Paris  
I took the last plane out of Saigon  
Took the first fast boat to China  
And Jimmy theres still so much to be done  
I had a third world girl in Buzios  
With a pistol in each hand  
  
She always kept me covered  
As we moved from land to land  
I had a damn good run on Wall Street  
With my high fashion model wife  
I woke up dry beneath the African sky  
Just me and my Swiss Army knife  
  
Chorus  
  
We shot the breeze for hours  
As the sun fell from the sky  
And like the sun he disappeared  
Before my very eyes  
It was somewhere past darkthirty  
As I went back to the head  
I read upon the dingy walls  
The words the old man said  
  
Chorus x2
