Losing sleep  
In a waking dream  
  
A recurring face I see  
Comes to pass my way  
  
Still my heart  
Will you please be still my heart  
In this world of change  
You keep turning me round again  
  
In my mind  
Could it be that Im just a fool for love  
Is blind to danger  
  
Is this faith  
Then why should I  
Hesitate when love would dance with a stranger  
  
Shout it loud from the rooftop high  
Let it burn inside  
And try only to fade and die  
  
If I knew all there was to learn  
Every twist and turn  
Why do I still try
