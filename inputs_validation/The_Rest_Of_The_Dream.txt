You were a tiny spark caught in your parents eyes and when they made love in
the dark well you were A big surprise and the old man came through gave his
very best for you and your mothers arms t  
Ept you warm like no other arms can do til the light of the day was as bright
as it seems and you knew in your heart you were living the rest I had a dream
of you but I never realized that baby  
Ream was true until you opened my eyes and I will come through give my very
best for you and your loving arms will keep me warm cause no other arms will
do when you cant find the light and we k  
  
N our hearts were living the rest of the dream now I see a tiny spark caught
in your loving eyes as We make love in the dark and dream of the big surprise
and the old man will come through son  
Ughter just for you and your mamas arms will keep you warm like no other arms
can do when you cant find the light at the top of the stairs when you cry in
the night well you know well be there  
The light of the day is as be  
Right as it seems repeat chorus
