The summer breeze made ripples on the pond  
Rattled through the rings and the willow trees beyond  
Daddy in his good hat mama in her Sunday dress  
Watched in pride as I stood there in the water up to my chest  
And the preacher spoke about the cleansing blood  
I sank my toes into that East Tennessee mud  
  
And it was down with the old man up with the new  
Raised to walk in the way of light and truth  
I didnt see no angels just a few saints on the shore  
But I felt like a new baby cradled up in the arms of the Lord  
  
Amazing grace oh how sweet the sound  
There was glory in the air there was dinner on the ground  
And my sins went for many were washed away and gone  
Along with a buffalo nickel I forgot to leave at home  
But that seemed like such a small small price to pay  
For the blessed peace of mind that came to me that day  
  
And it was down with the old man up with the new  
Raised to walk in the way of light and truth  
I didnt see no angels just a few saints on the shore  
But I felt like a new baby cradled up in the arms of the Lord  
  
This road is long and dusty sometimes the soul must be cleansed  
And I long to feel that water rushing over me again  
  
Down with the old man up with the new  
Raised to walk in the way of light and truth  
I didnt see no angels just a few saints on the shore  
But I felt like a new baby cradled up in the arms of the Lord  
I felt like a newborn baby cradled up in the arms of the Lord
