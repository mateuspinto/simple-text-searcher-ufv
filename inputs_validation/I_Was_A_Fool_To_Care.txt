I was a fool to care  
I was a fool to care  
I was a fool to care  
But I dont care even  
If I was a fool  
Im still in love with you  
Had I listened to the grapevine  
I might have had my doubts  
But I did my level best  
Just to block them out  
Cause love is so unwise  
And love has no eyes  
And it took a while  
For a fool to see  
What his friends were on about  
  
I was a fool to care  
I was a fool to care  
I was a fool to care  
But I dont care even  
If I was a fool  
Im still in love with you  
Imagining your face  
It almost fills  
The empty space before me  
I can see your eyes  
And almost hear your lovely lies  
  
I wish I was an old man  
And love was through with me  
I wish I was a baby on my mamas knee  
I wish I was a freight train  
Moving down the line  
Just keeping track of time  
Without all these memories  
  
I was a fool to care  
I was a fool to care  
I was a fool to care  
But I dont care even  
If I was a fool  
Im still in love with you babe yes I am  
I could have opened my eyes  
I could have seen through your lies  
I could have stood for no more  
I could have walked out the door  
  
But I was a fool to care  
I was a fool to care  
But I was a fool to care  
I was a fool to care  
You werent nothing but a fool to care  
Just a country fool to care  
You werent nothing but a fool to care  
Just a country fool to care
