I left jerusalem last week for jericho  
In the afternoon the sun was getting low  
And then the bushes shook and out they came at me  
They were robbing half naked while they beat me head to toe  
And they left me on the road to jericho  
Lying almost slain and wounded by the road  
Crying out in pain for a sympathetic soul  
First a priest and another of my kind  
Well they were men I could have trusted but they left me deaf and blind  
They were strangers on the road to jericho  
Through the blood and tears I saw a worried face  
He was from samaria my people hate his race  
He bandaged up my wounds and laid me on his horse  
Although my memory is cloudy I still can feel his friendly flow  
Such a kind man on the road to jericho  
When I later asked the innkeeper the mans name he did not know  
Just a neighbor on the road to jericho
