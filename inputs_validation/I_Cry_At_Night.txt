This house that I live in has no reason  
This house that I sleep in has no purpose  
It has a bed and a few old chairs  
Three flights up two flights of stairs  
But it has no reason  
  
Then someone shot through the tire swing  
The dogs barked and bayed in the winter and spring  
And the ivy that hung now sadly clings  
To a dying season  
  
And I cry at night when the lights go out  
And the green eyes fuse and the full moon shouts  
From road maps and red lines to lipstick lies  
And when the lights go out its thought to survive  
  
This man holds a hand that shows a tremble  
This man that I live in bears his faults  
He has a heart and a well worn soul  
Ten years a slave to rock and roll  
But he has to tremble  
  
For the yellow grass on the sun burnt lawn  
Sleeps in her seeds from the sunset to dawn  
And just like your love thats come and gone  
It goes on breathing
