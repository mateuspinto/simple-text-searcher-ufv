Long time ago in Trinidad  
Happen such a thing to make you sad  
Had a big fire where they make the rum  
For miles around all the people come  
And they shouting  
  
Out the fire down there  
Out the fire down there  
Out the fire down there  
Out the fire down there  
  
A little old woman past eighty eight  
Running in the fire thru the burning gate  
Before you could beat on a funeral drum  
She was rollin out a peck o rum  
And she singing  
  
Out the fire down there  
Out the fire down there  
Out the fire down there  
Out the fire down there  
  
The way de woman runnin into the flame  
Man you would think was a Carnival game  
I Tell you friends it was a sight to see  
I never had known such bravery  
And she screaming  
  
Out the fire down there  
Out the fire down there  
Out the fire down there  
Out the fire down there  
  
The way de woman runnin with a bucket and line  
Man she was working overtime  
She work up her sweat and never complain  
She was drinking rum and prayin for rain  
And she singing  
  
Out the fire down there  
Out the fire down there  
Out the fire down there  
Out the fire down there  
  
You could see the fire way down the road  
Everybody waited for the thing to explode  
The distillery burnt down to the ground  
Not a single drop of rum could be found  
And they singing  
  
Out the fire down there  
Out the fire down there  
Out the fire down there  
Out the fire down there  
  
Although it all happened a long time ago  
There is one thing that I dont know  
She was eighty eight there is no doubt  
How she get all the rum in she mouth  
And she singing  
  
Out the fire down there  
Out the fire down there  
Out the fire down there  
Out the fire down there
