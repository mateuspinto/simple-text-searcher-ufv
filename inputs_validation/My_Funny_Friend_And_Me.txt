In the quiet time of evening  
When the stars assume their patterns  
And the day has made his journey  
And we wondered just what happened  
To the life we knew before the world changed  
When not a thing I held was true  
But you were kind to me and you reminded me  
That the world is not my playground  
There are other things that matter  
And when a simple needs protecting  
My illusions all would shatter  
But you stayed in my corner  
The only world I knew was upside down  
And now the world and me I know you carry me  
You see the patterns in the big sky  
Those constellations look like you and I  
Just like the patterns in the big sky  
We could be lost we could refuse to try  
But we made it through in the dark night  
Would those lucky guys turn out to be  
But that unusual blend of my funny friend and me  
Im not as clever as I thought I was  
Im not the boy I used to be because  
You showed me something different  
You showed me something pure  
I always seemed so certain but I was really never sure  
But you stayed and you called my name  
When others would have walked out on a lousy game  
And you couldve made it through  
But your funny friend and you  
You see the patterns in the big sky  
Those constellations look like you and I  
That tiny planet in a bigger guy  
I dont know whether I should laugh or cry  
Just like the patterns in the big sky  
Well be together til the end this time  
Dont know the answer or the reason why  
Well stick together till the day we die  
If I had to do this all a second time  
I wont complain or make a fuss  
When the angels sing that that unlikely blend  
Are those two funny friends thats us
