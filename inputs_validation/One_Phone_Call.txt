Hard to believe it  
Its almost a year since  
I got to hold you head on my shoulder  
Dodging the daylight taking the blame I  
Its all I got left so lately Ive spent  
  
Every single night like its 25 to life  
And this sentence Ive been living is alone and unforgiven  
And Im guilty as charged cause I went and broke your heart  
But even Ive got rights youre always gonna be my  
  
Always be my one phone call  
All I want all I need is one phone call  
Im gonna leave my message at the tone  
Begging pretty baby please come home  
Cause youre my one  
Always be my one phone call  
  
First time it rings  
I cant help but think of the first time I saw you  
That moment I knew  
Holding the phone tight I hear the tone twice  
If you just pick up swear I can fix us  
  
Every single night feels like 25 to life  
And this sentence Ive been living is alone and unforgiven  
And Im guilty as charged cause I went and broke your heart  
But even Ive got rights your always gonna be my  
  
Always be my one phone call  
All I want all I need is one phone call  
Im gonna leave my message at the tone  
Begging pretty baby please come home  
Cause youre my one  
Always be my one phone call  
  
So let me make my case  
That way you wont erase the message  
That Im leaving for you now  
But if you do at least you knew  
  
Cause youre my one  
Always be my one phone call  
All I want all I need is one phone call  
  
Im gonna leave my message at the tone  
Begging pretty baby please come home  
Cause youre my one  
Always be my one phone call  
  
Youll always be my one  
Youll always be my one  
Cause youre my one  
Always be my one phone call  
Youll always be my one phone call
