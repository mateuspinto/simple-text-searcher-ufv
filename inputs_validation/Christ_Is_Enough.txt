VERSE  
Christ is my reward  
And all of my devotion  
Now theres nothing in this world  
That could ever satisfy  
  
PRECHORUS  
Through every trial  
My soul will sing  
No turning back  
Ive been set free  
  
CHORUS  
Christ is enough for me  
Christ is enough for me  
Everything I need is in You  
Everything I need  
  
VERSE  
Christ my all in all  
The joy of my salvation  
And this hope will never fail  
Heaven is our home  
  
PRECHORUS  
Through every storm  
My soul will sing  
Jesus is here  
To God be the glory  
  
BRIDGE  
I have decided to follow Jesus  
No turning back  
No turning back  
  
The cross before me  
The world behind me  
No turning back  
No turning back
