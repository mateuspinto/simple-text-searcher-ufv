On the shores of gitchgoomy by the shining big sea water  
Hiawatha old and grayin listened to the older prophet listened to Lagu  
And the young men and the women from the land of Ojibways  
From the land of the Dakotas from the woodlands and the prairies  
Stood and listened to the prophet heard lagu tell Hiawatha  
I have seen he said A water bigger than the big sea water  
Broader than the gitchgoomy bitter so that none cold drink it  
Salty so that none would use it  
Hiawatha then spoke to them stopped all their jeering and their jesting  
And he spoke to all the people  
Its true what Lagu tells you for I have seen it in a vision  
I have also seen the water to the east to the land of morning  
And upon this great water came a strange canoe with pinions  
Bigger than a grove of pine trees taller than the tallest tree tops  
And upon this great canoe were sails to carry it swiftly  
And it carried many people strange and foreign were these people  
And white were all their faces and with hair their chins were covered  
Then said Hiawatha I beheld a darker vision  
Many hundreds came behind them pushed their way across our prairies  
In our woodlands rang their axes in our valleys smoked their cities  
Our people were all scattered all forgetful of our councils  
Left their homelands going westward wild and woeful  
And the man with bearded faces the men with skin so fair  
With their barking sticks of thunder drove the remnants of our people  
Farther westward westward westward then wild wild and wilder  
Grew the west that once was ours
