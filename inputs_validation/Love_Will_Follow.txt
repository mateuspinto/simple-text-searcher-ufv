I run out of breath and start to shake  
I love you with all my heart can take  
I hold you beside me in my sleep  
And long to be dreaming in my sleep  
  
Weve come into a place in time  
Where I am yours and youre mine  
A circle filled with love  
  
If youll come away with me  
I could show you ecstasy  
Close your eyes and we will lead  
And love will follow  
  
Take a chance and hold my hand  
I know youll understand  
Well find a special land  
And love will follow  
  
A smile on your lips and in your eyes  
A stranger adrift in paradise  
You touch me and slowly move away  
Take all of the night you need to take  
  
Just wait a little while and see  
What you mean to me  
Ive waited all my life  
  
If you come away with me  
I could show you ecstasy  
Close your eyes and we will lead  
And love will follow  
  
Use your wings and fly away  
And come with me today  
Your heart will lead the way  
And love will follow  
  
If this was just a chance of makebelieve  
Youd never feel it this way  
Ive always wanted to love somebody  
As much as I I wanted you now  
  
Weve come into a place in time  
Where I am yours and youre mine  
A circle filled with love  
  
If youll come away with me  
I could show you ecstasy  
Close your eyes and we will lead  
And love will follow  
  
Take a chance and hold my hand  
I know youll understand  
Well find a special land  
And love will follow  
  
Girl I swear Ill never fall  
Its a natural pure law  
And everywhere we go  
Love will follow  
  
Use your wings to fly away  
And come with me today  
Your heart will lead the way  
And love will follow  
  
Hold me long all night long where you belong my baby  
Hold me long all night long where you belong my baby  
Hold me long all night long where you belong my baby  
Hold me long all night long where you belong my baby  
Hold me long all night long where you belong my baby  
Hold me long all night long where you belong my baby  
Hold me long all night long where you belong my baby  
Hold me long all night long where you belong my baby  
Hold me long all night long where you belong my baby
