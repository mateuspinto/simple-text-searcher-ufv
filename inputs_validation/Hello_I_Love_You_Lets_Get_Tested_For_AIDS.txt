Hello I love you  
Lets get tested for aids  
You know I want you  
But lets wait a few days  
  
She might look nice and sweet  
But sleeps with every guy she meets  
You might think you know some guy  
But you know guys and they always lie  
  
Hello I love you  
Lets get tested for aids  
You know I trust you  
But you cant tell these days  
Hello I love you  
And liked to get laid  
You know I want you  
But Im deathly afraid  
  
She holds my hand and sighs  
But her hand wont satisfy  
Our thoughts are wicked  
But our legs are crossed  
And I doubt I can hold out too long  
  
The doc wont know for at least a week  
Im like a dog locked up when my mates in heat  
And I hope she doesnt see me drool  
Cuz I hope to use my rusty tool
