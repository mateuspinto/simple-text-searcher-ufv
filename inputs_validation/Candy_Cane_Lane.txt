Just a hint of peppermint and every single thing begins to feel like  
Christmas  
And just like the snowflakes no two are ever the same  
  
Red and white and candy striped in every shape and size oh what a sweet  
Treat this is  
So hop on the choo choo and woo woo to Candy Cane Lane  
  
Youll be all aglow from your head to mistletoes oh  
Theres no road that could ever smell as sweet or look as good enough to  
Eat  
Theres nothin like a city block of hangin lights where I  
Just wanta curl up by the fire for a couple cups of cider and  
Roast all those marshmallows  
  
Theyre hung up in the trees in line the bulbs all fill the street just  
Like a scene from a snow globe  
So baby lets go take a stroll down to Candy Cane Lane  
  
Youll be all aglow from your head to mistletoes oh  
Theres no road that could ever smell as sweet or look as good enough to  
Eat  
Theres nothin like a city block of hangin lights where I  
Just wanta curl up by the fire for a couple cups of cider and  
Roast all those marshmallows  
  
Add a pinch of cinnamon and suddenly the world begins to taste like  
December  
And youll always remember comin down to Candy Cane Lane  
Just a couple licks from the minty sugar stick and everything turns  
Wintergreen  
On Candy Cane Lane one block from Gum Drop Street
