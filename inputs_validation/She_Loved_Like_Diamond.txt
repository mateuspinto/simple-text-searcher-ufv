She ran the risk from unity  
Obsession dies alone with tragedy  
She loved like diamond  
She loved like diamond  
And cut so hard she died  
A passion course that leads to pain  
An acid taste that laced her soul again  
She loved like diamond  
She loved like diamond  
And cut so hard she died  
Another path Ive run them all  
The rain has cleared the stains no trace at all  
She loved like diamond  
She loved like diamond  
And cut so hard she died  
She loved like diamond  
She loved like diamond  
And cut so hard she died
