The liberator of sin  
The giver of delight  
I took the drug  
And went out like a light  
I giggled on the bed  
As I stared at the wall  
I was the one who felt ever so small  
I couldnt take it  
I couldnt win with my thoughts  
Forever playing chess  
And keeping reports  
On whatever I saw  
And whatever moved  
I was emperor for an hour  
I had nothing else to do  
  
The universe caved in  
My legs fell away  
I took the drug but you didnt say  
That I would be you and you would be me  
When I took the pill  
That put me to sleep  
I couldnt take it  
I couldnt spin all the plates  
Forever in a mind field of personal games  
What could I do  
I was Caesar of Rome  
Thank God I woke up  
To find you had come home
