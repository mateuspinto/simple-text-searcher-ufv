Yesterday may linger forever  
Today may never be found  
Tomorrow may never come

Yesterday may haunt us forever  
Today may pass in fear  
Tomorrow my never come  
Tomorrow may never come  
  
All we have is you and I  
All we have you and I  
Feeling the wind and the sky

Reach me touch me hold me  
Hold me  
Hold me while my lips are still soft

All we have is you and I  
All we have you and I  
Feeling the wind and the sky

Hold me while my lips are still soft
