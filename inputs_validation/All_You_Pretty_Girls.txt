Do something for me boys  
If I should die at sea boys  
Write a little note boys  
Set it off afloat saying  
  
Bless you bless you all of you pretty girls  
Village and city girls by the quayside  
Bless you bless you all of you pretty girls  
Watching and waiting by the sea  
  
Bless you bless you all of you pretty girls  
Quiet or witty girls by the quayside  
Bless you bless you all of you pretty girls  
Watching and waiting by the sea  
  
I think about your pale arms waving  
When I see the caps upon the green  
And the rocking rollercoaster ocean  
Think about you every night when Im fathoms asleep  
And in my dreams  
We are rocking in a similar motion  
  
I think about the salt sea rolling  
Down in pearly tears upon your cheeks  
Just like the day the harbor pulled away  
I think about your warm white sheets unfolding  
The more I have to drink  
The more that I can think to say
