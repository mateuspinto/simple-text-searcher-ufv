Are you passionate  
Are you livin like you talk  
Are you dreamin now  
That youre goin to the top  
Are you negative  
In a world that never stops  
Turnin on you  
Turnin on me  
Turnin on you  
  
Are you loving it  
Can you ever get enough of it  
Is it everything  
A love that never stops  
Comin to you  
Comin to me  
Comin to you  
  
Once I was a soldier  
I was fighting in the sky  
And the gunfire kept  
Comin back on me  
So I dove into the darkness  
And I let my missles fly  
And they might be the ones  
That kept you free  
  
Once I was a prisoner  
I was riding in a truck  
Cleaned up for public display  
I looked at those around me  
And when they looked at me  
I let them see my soul that day  
  
Are you scared of it  
Do you wish that it would stop  
Does it bother you  
When you hear your spirit talk  
Well Im right with you  
Yes Im right with you  
Its working on me  
Its working on you  
Its working on me
