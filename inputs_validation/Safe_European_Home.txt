Well I just got back an I wish I never  
Leave now  
Who dat Martian arrival at the airport  
How many local dollars for a local anesthetic  
The Johnny on the corner was a very sympathetic  
  
I went to the place where every white face is an  
Invitation to robbery  
An sitting here in my safe European home  
I dont want to go back there again  
  
Wasnt I lucky n wouldnt it be loverly  
Send us all cards an have a laying in on a Sunday  
I was there for two weeks so how come I never tell  
That natty dread drinks at the Sheraton hotel  
  
Now they got the sun an they got the palm trees  
They got the weed an they got the taxis  
Whoa the harder they come n the home of ol bluebeat  
Yes Id stay an be a tourist but I cant take the gun play
