Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind  
Clinging to strange promises dying on the vine  
Never bein able to separate the good from the bad  
Ooh I cant stand it I cant stand it  
Its makin me feel so bad  
  
Dead man dead man  
When will you rise  
Cobwebs in your mind  
Dust in your eyes  
  
Satan got you by the heel theres a birds nest in your hair  
Do you have any faith at all Do you have any love to share  
The way that you hold your head cursin God with every move  
Ooh I cant stand it I cant stand it  
What are you tryin to prove  
  
Dead man dead man  
When will you rise  
Cobwebs in your mind  
Dust in your eyes  
  
The glamor ad the bright lights and the politics of sin  
The ghetto you build for me is the one you end up in  
The race of the engine that overrules your heart  
Ooh I cant stand it I cant stand it  
Pretending that youre so smart  
  
Dead man dead man  
When will you rise  
Cobwebs in your mind  
Dust in your eyes  
  
What are you tryin to overpower me with the doctrine or the gun  
My back is already to the wall where can I run  
The tuxedo that youre wearin the flower in your lapel  
Ooh I cant stand it I cant stand it  
You want to take me down to hell  
  
Dead man dead man  
When will you rise  
Cobwebs in your mind  
Dust in your eyes
