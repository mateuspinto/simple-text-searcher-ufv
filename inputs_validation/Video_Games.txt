Swinging in the backyard  
Pull up in your fast car whistling my name  
  
Open up a beer  
And you say get over here and play a video game  
  
Im in his favorite sun dress  
Watching me get undressed take that body downtown  
  
I say you the bestest  
Lean in for a big kiss put his favorite perfume on  
  
Go play your video game  
  
Its you its you its all for you  
Everything I do  
I tell you all the time  
Heaven is a place on earth with you  
Tell me all the things you want to do  
I heard that you like the bad girls honey is that true  
Its better than I ever even knew  
They say that the world was built for two  
Only worth living if somebody is loving you  
Baby now you do  
  
Singing in the old bars  
Swinging with the old stars  
Living for the fame  
  
Kissing in the blue dark  
Playing pool and wild darts  
Video games  
  
He holds me in his big arms  
Drunk and I am seeing stars  
This is all I think of  
  
Watching all our friends fall  
In and out of Old Pauls  
This is my idea of fun  
Playing video games  
  
Its you its you its all for you  
Everything I do  
I tell you all the time  
Heaven is a place on earth with you  
Tell me all the things you want to do  
I heard that you like the bad girls honey is that true  
Its better than I ever even knew  
They say that the world was built for two  
Only worth living if somebody is loving you  
Baby now you do Now you do  
  
Its you its you its all for you  
Everything I do  
I tell you all the time  
Heaven is a place on earth with you  
Tell me all the things you want to do  
I heard that you like the bad girls honey is that true  
Its better than I ever even knew  
They say that the world was built for two  
Only worth living if somebody is loving you  
Baby now you do Now you do  
  
Now you do Now you do
