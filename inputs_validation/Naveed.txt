Are you there and is it comfortable  
Did you want to escape try to escape the population  
The pressure is deceiving  
And for you particularly should we let a young man die  
Let him die if he wants to  
I cant live here anymore  
Its hard when you reach for that floor and  
And theres something that tears me inside so I cant  
Go brother are you there  
Now tell me is it wonderful  
Or were you hoping to find something a little more  
Climbing down the hours I need to know now  
Do the hands of time only rule this chapter  
Ill have to try once again Ill have to try when I want to  
There hes on his knees again  
Trying hard to understand  
Why Naveed would let a young man die  
Convinced that he might break he reaches for that phone  
And then another day has gone
