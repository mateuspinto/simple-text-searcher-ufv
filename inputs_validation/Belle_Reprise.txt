Belle  
  
Is he gone  
Oh can you imagine  
He asked me to marry him  
Me the wife of that boorish brainless   
  
Madame Gaston  
Cant you just see it  
Madame Gaston  
His little wife ugh  
No sir Not me I guarantee it  
I want much more than this provincial life  
I want adventure in the great wide somewhere  
I want it more than I can tell  
And for once it might be grand  
To have someone understand  
I want so much more than theyve got planned
