Like a bird that flies  
In the morning light  
Or a butterfly in the spring  
When your spirit rides  
On the winds of hope  
Youll find your wings  
  
Erika  
And your always free to begin again  
And your always free to believe  
When you find the place that your heart belongs  
Youll never leave  
  
Anneliese  
You and I will always be  
Celebrating life together  
  
Both  
I know I have found a friend forever more  
  
Anneliese  
Love is like a melody  
One that I will always treasure  
  
Both  
Courage is the key that opens every door  
  
Though you may not know where your gifts may lead  
And it may not show at the start  
When you live your dream  
Youll find destiny  
Is written in your heart  
  
All  
Though you may not know where your gifts may lead  
And it may not show at the start  
When you live your dream  
Youll find destiny  
Is written in your heart
