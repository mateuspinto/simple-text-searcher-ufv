Im used to opening my own doors and splitting the checks  
He introduced me was always just a friend  
I bought a new dress he never noticed  
Always falling for these bad boys such a challenge  
Im getting tired of cleaning up after them  
I think Im ready to be a woman  
  
Oh love I think Im ready  
Ready for it  
  
You were such a surprise  
An unexpected gift  
Said I was pretty and I believed it  
Not really used to all this attention  
Told myself I dont deserve you  
And this is just a phase  
Could I get used to being loved the right way  
I wanna argue but there is nothing to say  
  
Oh love I think Im ready  
Ready for it  
Ready for it  
Oh love I think Im ready  
  
Cause you send me flowers when theres no occasion  
Yeah we talk for hours you still wanna listen  
Wont hold it against me if I just need you to hold me tonight  
My mother always told me that youd show up one day  
So scared to feel this way but love I think Im ready  
Ready for it  
Ready for it  
Oh love I think Im ready  
Ready for it  
Ready for it  
Oh love I think Im ready
