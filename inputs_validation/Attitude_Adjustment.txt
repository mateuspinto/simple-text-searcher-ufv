Now I met an old friend  
In the bar the other night  
And he got a little drunk  
And he wanted to fight  
And he jumped up  
And challenged every man in the room  
And just about the time he got the words out  
An ol boy jumped up and closed his mouth  
And used his head for a mop  
And his butt for a broom  
  
It was an attitude adjustment  
I guess it was his first time  
An attitude adjustment  
Now he understands just fine  
He got bent out of shape  
And he opened his mouth  
And just one appointment  
Straightened him right out  
It was an adttitude adjustment  
Oh Itll work every time  
  
Well Ive got this big ol brotherinlaw  
And me and him just never did get along  
Because he wants to make sure  
Im treating his sister right  
He got drunk one night  
And started beating me up  
And I went and got a tire tool  
Out of my truck  
And laid him out as cold as a block of ice  
  
It was an attitude adjustment  
And it will work every time  
An attitude adjustment  
I made him see the light  
And he says Im his kind of man  
And he comes around with his hat in his hand  
It was an attitude adjustment  
I cured all his family pride  
  
Now my girlfriend slapped me in the face  
I said darlin that was youre first mistake  
Then she went wild and her eyes turned red  
She started breaking everything  
And sceaming loud  
And kickin me and cussin me out  
And I gave her a little adjustment  
On the top of the head  
  
It was an attitude adjustment  
Now she loves on me all the time  
Just an attitude adjustment  
She got a whole new frame of mind  
She dont nag  
And I dont beg  
And we get along and like I said  
Just an attitude adjustment  
Oh everythings just fine  
Well almost  
  
She called the cops to take me in  
And I said youre never gonna do it friend  
And they just smiled  
And said Oh Yes We Will  
Now a stick to the head  
And some kicks in the chin  
And a several bites from Rin Tin Tin  
And I couldnt wait to get into that jail  
  
It was an attitude adjustment  
Oh I went along peacfully  
Attitude adjustment  
Oh they made me cleary see  
Cause my head is black  
And my legs are blue  
And both knee caps are bent clean through  
It was an attitude adjustment  
It made my whole outlook brand new  
Just a attitude adjustment  
It made my whole outlook brand new
