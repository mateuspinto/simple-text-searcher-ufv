On the firefly platform of sunny goodge street  
A violent hashsmoker shook a chocolate machine  
Involved in an eating scene  
Smashing into neon streets in their stillness  
Smearing their eyes on the crazy kali goddess  
Listening to sounds of mingus mellow fantastic  
my my they sigh  
In dull house rooms with coloured lights swinging  
Strange music boxes sadly tinkling  
Drink in the sun shining all around you  
my my they sigh  
The magician he sparkles in satin and velvet  
You gaze at his splendour with eyes youve not used yet  
I tell you his name is love love love  
my my they sigh  
my my so high  
my my they sigh  
Hmm hmm  
Hmm hmm  
Hmm hmm
