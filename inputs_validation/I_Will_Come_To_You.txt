Just like a ship sailing out on a mornin tide  
Sailing far away out to sea and the sea is very wide  
You walked away where theres lots of room to hide  
Out into the world and the world is very wide  
But one day baby one day baby one day  
  
Chorus   
I will come to you if it takes everyday left in my life  
I will come to you for there must be someone in my life  
No matter where you are  
Ill find you near or far  
Or I will never love til I can love with you  
And I wont really live  
For life without you is like dying  
  
Dont know where you are  
And I dont know if you think of me  
But where you are  
Is the only place I want to be  
Lost in a world of nothing much to do  
Thats how I am ever since losing you  
But one day baby one day oh baby one day  
  
Chorus   
  
I will come to you ooh ooh  
There must be someone in my life  
I will come to you ooh ooh  
I will come to you ooh ooh  
Oh baby there must be someone in my life baby  
I will come to you ooh ooh  
Oh everyday left in my life
