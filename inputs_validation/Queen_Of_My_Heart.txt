So here we stand in our secret place  
The sound of the crowd is so far away  
You take my hand and it fees like home  
We both understand it where we belong  
So do I say do I say goodbye  
We both have our dreams we both want to fly  
So lets take tonight to carry us through the lonely times  
  
Chorus  
Ill always look back as I walk away  
Memories will last for eternity  
And all of our tears will be lost in the rain  
As I found my way back to your arms again  
But until that day you know you are  
The Queen of my heart  
  
So lets take tonight and never let go  
While we dance we kiss like theres no tomorrow  
As the stars sparkle down like a diamond ring  
Ill treasure this moment till we meet again  
  
But no matter how far away you may be   
Ill just close my eyes and your in my dreams  
And there you will be until we will meet  
  
ChorusRepeat x2
