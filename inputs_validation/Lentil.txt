You were waiting for me adore me you saw me  
As I wish the whole world could  
You would never hurt me desert me or work me  
For all the things you thought you could  
You would lick the tears from my eyes when I cry  
How I missed you when I was gone  
Hurt me so to leave you deceive you I needed you  
I believed in you  
  
So I never meant to let you down  
Awake with a stake in my eye  
I never meant to let you down  
Im trying not to fall apart  
  
All I have are pictures and stitches and riches  
But money could never buy what you give  
Though my heart is achin and breakin Im takin  
Most of what you send my way  
I want just to hold you unfold you I told  
I am coming back for you  
I know we will be okay everyday  
The sun shines a little brighter  
  
So I never meant to let you down  
Awake with a stake in my eye  
I never meant to let you down  
Im trying not to fall apart  
I never meant to let you down  
Awake with a stake in my eye  
I never meant to let you down  
Im trying not to fall apart  
Im trying not to fall apart  
  
When in the night well set a light  
Im wishing with all of my mind  
Oh no I never meant to let you down  
Never meant to let you down  
Im trying not to fall apart  
I never let you down  
I never meant to let you down  
Im trying not to fall apart
