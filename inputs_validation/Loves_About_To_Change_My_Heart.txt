I never needed someone  
cause I always led a life of my own  
Never waited for the ring of the phone  
Never had anyone here  
When I got home  
But loves about to change my heart  
  
Im waiting for the doorbell to chime  
When I always lived one day at a time  
I thought that I was getting on fine  
Never felt I was alone  
til you change your mind  
Loves about to change my heart  
  
Could a day be so long  
When I always felt secure and so strong  
And all the time as I went along  
Never thought I would desire  
So much to belong  
Loves about to change my heart  
Loves about to change my heart ooh  
  
Never ever thought the sky was so blue  
Never ever thought Id feel so new  
Always thought Id know what to do  
But I guess I wasnt counting on you  
  
What did I know  
I always felt so much on control  
I thought Id make it all on my own  
Never thought I would forget  
All I have known  
Loves about to change my heart  
Loves about to change my heart  
Loves about to change change change  
My heart
