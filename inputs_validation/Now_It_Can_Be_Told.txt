All the worlds great lovers have been glorified  
History placed them in a romantic set  
In between book covers they are side by side  
But the real thing hasnt been written yet  
  
Now it can be told  
Told in all its glory  
Now that we have met  
The world may know the sentimental story  
  
The greatest romance they ever knew  
Is waiting to  
Unfold  
  
Now it can be told  
As an inspiration  
Every other tale  
Of boy meets girl is just an imitation  
  
The great love story  
Has never been told before  
But now  
Now it can be told
