If my life gets like a jigsaw  
With the pieces out of place  
Come on over  
Put a smile back on my face  
  
And if all my bad days came at once  
You would know just what to do  
Come on over  
Baby you would see me through  
  
And if you think I need you  
Come on over  
Bring your love around  
You can dry away my tears  
  
And if you think I need you  
Come on over  
Lay your body down  
You know I will be here  
So bring your love around  
  
When I cannot see in front of me  
And I know my darkest day  
Come on over  
You can take it all away  
  
And if you think I need you  
Come on over  
Bring your love around  
You can wipe away my tears  
  
And if you think I need you  
Come on over  
Lay your body down  
You know I will be here  
So bring your love around  
  
If you think  
If you think I need you  
Come on over
