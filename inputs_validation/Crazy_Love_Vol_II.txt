Fat Charlie the Archangel  
Sloped into the room  
He said I have no opinion about this  
And I have no opinion about that  
  
Sad as a lonely little wrinkled balloon  
He said well I dont claim to be happy about this boys  
And I dont seem to be happy about that  
  
I dont want no part of this crazy love  
I dont want no part of your love  
I dont want no part of this crazy love  
I dont want no part of your love  
  
I dont want no part of this crazy love  
I dont want no part of your love  
I dont want no part of this crazy love  
I dont want no part of this crazy love  
  
She says she knows about jokes  
This time the joke is on me  
Well I have no opinion about that  
And I have no opinion about me  
  
Somebody could walk into this room  
And say your life is on fire  
Its all over the evening news  
All about the fire in your life  
On the evening news  
  
I dont want no part of this crazy love  
I dont want no part of your love  
I dont want no part of this crazy love  
I dont want no part of your love  
  
Fat Charlie the Archangel  
Files for divorce  
He says well this will eat up a year of my life  
And then theres all that weight to be lost  
She says the joke is on me  
I say the joke is on her  
I said I have no opinion about that  
Well well just have to wait and confer  
  
I dont want no part of this crazy love  
I dont want no part of your love  
I dont want no part of this crazy love  
I dont want no part of your love  
  
I dont want no part of this crazy love  
I dont want no part of your love  
I dont want no part of this crazy love  
I dont want no part of this crazy love
