If I was down would your arms lift me up to higher ground  
With just the strength of your love  
If I was lost would I find something in your eyes to lead me home  
  
And if it all went wrong  
Would you be there to hold  
Its easy to be there through the good times  
But when the times get hard  
Would you stay or walk away  
  
Chorus  
Are you gonna be there when the rain comes  
Are you gonna be there with a warm touch  
Can you swear youll be there with a real love  
Are you gonna be there  
Will you stand by my side through the bad times  
Through whatever will be will you still be mine  
Will you stay in my life for a lifetime  
Are you gonna be there  
  
When I need someone to hold  
Someone there for me  
Are you gonna be there  
  
But in my world  
If it should all fall down  
Will you be there  
Be there to turn it around  
Will you still care  
Can I depend on you to see me through this life  
  
And if it all goes wrong  
Will you still make it right  
Its easy to be there through the good times  
But when the times get hard  
Will you still be on my side  
  
Chorus  
  
When I need someone beside me  
Someone there for me  
Are you gonna be  
There with the arms to hold me  
There with the love I need with you baby  
Will you be there  
Heart and soul I need to know  
  
Are you gonna be there  
Are you gonna still care  
Are you gonna be there  
Will you stand by my side  
Are you gonna be mine  
Are you gonna be there  
  
Chorus
