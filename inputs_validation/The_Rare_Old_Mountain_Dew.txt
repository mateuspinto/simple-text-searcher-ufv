Let grasses grow and waters flow  
In a free and easy way  
But give me enough of the rare old stuff  
Thats made near Galway Bay  
Come gangers all from Donegal  
Sligo and Leitrim too  
Oh well give the slip and well take a sip  
Of the rare old Mountain Dew  
Hi the dithery al the dal dal the dal the dithery al al the dal dal dithery
al dee  
Hi the dithery al the dal dal the dal the dithery al dal the dal dal
dithery al dee  
Theres a neat little still at the foot of the hill  
Where the smoke curls up to the sky  
By a whiff of the smell you can plainly tell  
That theres poitin boys close by  
For it fills the air with a perfume rare  
And betwixt both me and you  
As home we roll we can drink a bowl  
Or a bucketful of Mountain Dew  
Now learned men as use the pen  
Have writ the praises high  
Of the rare poitin from Ireland green  
Distilled from wheat and rye  
Away with yer pills itll cure all ills  
Be ye Pagan Christian or Jew  
So take off your coat and grease your throat  
With a bucketful of Mountain Dew
