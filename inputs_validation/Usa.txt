When I was young I watched the cars  
When I was older I drank in bars  
When I was young well I chewed the leaves  
When I was older I drank with thieves  
I found a love she gave me dreams  
She left me drunk in New Orleans  
So cold and lonely so all alone  
I wished my heart was made of stone  
I took the cold bright needle  
I used it as a sword  
My eyes have seen the glory of  
The coming of the Lord  
I burned across the Delta  
I swam across the Ford  
My eyes have seen the glory of  
The coming of the Lord  
When I was a young man standing on this road  
My empty belly an aching hole  
An old man said to me Kid dont you know  
That its the same wherever you go  
I gambled in two graveyards  
I won against the odds  
With the saints and with the saviors  
With the maggots and the Gods  
I cursed the things they showed me  
I could never see again  
And the howling of the wind at night  
I wrote upon the rain  
I found the thing for which I prayed  
And came back home to the USA  
With a heart of stone so now I know  
That its the same wherever you go  
Wherever you go  
Wherever you go  
Wherever you go  
Wherever you go  
Come come here we come  
Come come here we come  
Come come here we come
