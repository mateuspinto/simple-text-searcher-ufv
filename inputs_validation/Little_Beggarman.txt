Traditional  Arr Gbs  
  
Well I am a little beggarman a begging I have been  
For three score or more in the little isle of green  
All over the Liffey and down to Segue  
Im known by the name of auld Johnny Dhu  
  
Of all the trades a going begging is the best  
When a man gets tired he can sit down and rest  
Singin for his supper when theres nothing else to do  
When I come around the corner with me old rigadoo  
  
I went to a barn went down to Currabawn  
Got down on the floor and I slept till the dawn  
Holes in the roof and the rain seeping thru  
Me toes froze together in me little beggar shoes  
  
Buy a pair of leggings and a collar and a tie  
A nice old lady you will find by and by  
Buy a pair of leggings and Ill color them blue  
For a foxy old lady Ill make her too  
  
I met a little flaxen haired girl one day  
Good morning little flaxen haired girl I did say  
Good morning little beggarman how do you do  
With your bags and your rags and your auld rigadoo  
  
Who should I waken but the woman of the house  
With her white spotted apron and her calico blouse  
She began to frighten so I said boo  
Sure dont be afraid its only Johnny Dhu  
  
Over the road with me pack on me back  
Over all the fields with me big heavy sack  
Over the hills with the moon peeking through  
Singing skin a ma rink a doodle on me auld rigadoo  
  
I must be going to bed its getting late at night  
The fire is all out so out goes the light  
Now youve heard the story of the auld rigadoo  
So good night and God be with you this is auld Johnny Dhu
