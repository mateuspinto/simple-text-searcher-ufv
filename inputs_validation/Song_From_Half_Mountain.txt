Now the wind is still  
In a moment it will be raging  
Now my soul is young  
In a moment it will be aging  
And high above the pines  
I wrote several lines  
And left them in a bottle  
For you to find  
  
Now the dream is rising  
In a moment it will be past  
This breath is my first  
It will all too soon be my last  
  
And on a windy coast  
I made several toasts  
To you and me and the sea  
And no one heard  
  
Now the wind is still  
In a moment it will be raging  
Now my soul is young  
In a moment it will be aging  
  
And high above the pines  
I wrote several lines  
And left them in a bottle  
For you to find
