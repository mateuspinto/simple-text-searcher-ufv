Which way are you going  
Which side will you be on  
Will you stand and watch  
While all the seeds of hate are sown  
Will you stand with those who say  
Let his will be done  
  
One hand on the bible  
One hand on the gun  
One hand on the bible  
One hand on the gun  
  
Which way are you looking  
Is it hard to see  
Do you say  
Whats wrong for him is not wrong for me  
You walk the streets  
Righteousness but you refuse to understand  
  
You say you love the baby  
Then you crucify the man  
You say you love the baby  
Then you crucify the man  
  
Everyday things are changing  
Words once honored turned to lies  
People wondering can you blame them  
Its too far to run and too late to hide  
  
Now you turn your back on  
All the things that you used to preach  
Now its Let him live in freedom if he lives like me  
Well your light has changed confusion rains  
What have you become  
  
All your olive branches turned to spears  
When your flowers turned to guns  
Your olive branches turned to spears  
When your flowers turned to guns
