theres a tree  
standing there  
in such an ordinary way  
but as I look around  
everything keeps changing  
theres a leaf  
on that tree  
and it floats into a stream  
and like everything  
it gets carried away  
to the sea  
chorus  
but if we give a little of our love away  
maybe meet in the middle  
every night and day  
if we could hear just a whisper  
of what the heart needs to say  
it could sure make a difference  
in some small  
in some small way  
in your heart lies the key  
that unlocks your destiny  
look within and well find  
everything were longing for  
chorus  
oh  
may you cherish each moment you live  
and know all the love that you give  
will go on and on and on  
theres a sky vast and blue  
and it lies deep inside of you  
breathe it in  
let it out  
breathe it in again  
chorus
