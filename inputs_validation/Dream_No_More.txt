He sleeps under black seas waiting  
Lies dreaming in death  
He sleeps under cosmos shaking  
Stars granting his breath  
  
He wakes as the world dies screaming  
All horrors arrive  
He wakes giving earth its bleeding  
Pure madness alive  
  
And He haunts you  
And He blinds your soul  
And He loathes you  
And reclaims it all  
  
You turn to stone  
Cant look away  
You turn to stone  
Madness they say  
  
Cthulhu awaken  
  
He sways in abyss returning  
Inhaling black skies  
He shakes with a torture burning  
All lost in his eyes  
  
And He haunts you  
And He blinds your soul  
And He loathes you  
And reclaims it all  
  
You turn to stone  
Cant look away  
You turn to stone  
Madness they say  
  
Cthulhu awaken  
  
You turn to stone  
Cant look away  
You turn to stone  
Madness they say  
  
Sanity taken  
Seething damnation  
Cthulhu awaken  
Wake Winged Salvation  
Death by creation  
Cthulhu awaken  
Wake Dreaming no more  
  
Cthulhu awaken  
Wake Dreaming no more  
Cthulhu awaken  
Wake Dreaming no more
