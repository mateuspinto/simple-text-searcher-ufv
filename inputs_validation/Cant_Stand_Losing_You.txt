Ive called you so many times today  
And I guess its all true what your girlfriends say  
That you dont ever want to see me again  
And your brothers gonna kill me and hes six feet ten  
I guess youd call it cowardice  
But Im not prepared to go on like this  
  
I cant I cant I cant stand losing  
I cant I cant I cant stand losing  
I cant I cant I cant I cant stand losing you  
I cant stand losing you  
I cant stand losing you  
I cant stand losing you  
  
I see you sent my letters back  
And my lp records and theyre all scratched  
I cant see the point in another day  
When nobody listens to a word I say  
You can call it lack of confidence  
But to carry on living doesnt make no sense  
  
I cant I cant I cant stand losing  
I cant I cant I cant stand losing  
I cant I cant I cant stand losing  
I cant I cant stand losing you  
I cant I cant I cant stand losing  
I cant I cant I cant stand losing  
  
I guess this is our last goodbye  
And you dont care so I wont cry  
But youll be sorry when Im dead  
And all this guilt will be on your head  
I guess youd call it suicide  
But Im too full to swallow my pride  
I cant I cant I cant stand losing  
I cant I cant
