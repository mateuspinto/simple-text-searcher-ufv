I was sinking deep in sin  
Far from the peaceful shore  
Very deeply stained within  
Sinking to rise no more  
But the Master of the sea  
  
Heard my despairing cry  
From the waters lifted me  
Now safe am I  
  
Love lifted me Love lifted me  
When nothing else could help  
Love lifted me  
Love lifted me Love lifted me  
When nothing else could help  
Love lifted me  
  
Souls in danger look above  
Jesus completely saves  
He will lift you by his love  
Out of the angry waves  
  
But the master of the sea  
Billows His will obey  
He your savior wants to be  
Be saved today  
  
Love lifted me Love lifted me  
When nothing else could help  
Love lifted me  
Love lifted me Love lifted me  
When nothing else could help  
Love lifted me
