I lit my purest candle close to my window  
Hoping it would catch the eye  
Of any vagabond that passed it by  
And I waited in my lonely house  
  
Before he came I felt him drawing near  
And as he neared I felt the ancient fear  
That he had come to my door and jeer  
And I waited in my fleeting house  
  
Tell me stories I called to the hobo  
Stories of old I smiled to the hobo  
Storie of cold I wept to the hobo  
As he stood before my fleeting house  
  
No said the hobo no more tales of time  
Dont ask me now to wash away the grime  
I cant come in for its too high a climb  
And he walked away from my lonely house  
  
Then you be damned I screamed to the hobo  
Turn into stone I cried to the hobo  
Leave me alone I knelt to the hobo  
And he walked away from my fleeting house  
  
I lit my purest candle close to my window  
Hoping it would catch the eye  
Of any vagabond who passed it by  
And I waited in my fleeting house
