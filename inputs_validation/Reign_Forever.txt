No mountain too high  
No valley too low  
That You cannot overcome  
  
No problem too great  
No need that You cannot fulfill  
Because of your power  
  
Saviour Healer Redeemer  
Creator giver of life to all things  
  
I stand in awe of You  
I stand in owe of your wonder and grace  
I stand in awe of You  
My God You reign forever  
  
Jesus King of kings  
Jesus Lord of lords  
Jesus King of kings  
And You reign forevermore
