We are here  
In this holy cave today  
To celebrate  
The reincarnation  
Of Domingo de Santa Clara  
The man who convinced us  
That there is no Lord  
For His name is Buddha Allah Shiva Jahve  
Outside our bodies  
  
We are God  
Cause only we can create the idea  
Of His existence in our holy brains  
  
Let us pray to ourselves and our spirits  
  
Domingo you show me just nothing  
Like no one before  
Domingo you show me just nothing  
Like no one before  
Domingo you show me just nothing  
Like no one before  
Domingo you show me just nothing  
Like no one before  
  
Domingo of Santa Clara  
You made us believe  
That you are no phantom  
When without  
  
The slightest spot of a thousand nations  
You sprayed your blood of Domingo  
  
We all know  
Domingo of Santa Clara  
Will be born today tomorrow and the day after  
  
Billions of times  
Til the end of the Universe  
Here with a smile on his face  
As the rest of our species watches  
The catastrophe  
  
Domingo you show me just nothing  
Like no one before  
Domingo you show me just nothing  
Like no one before  
Domingo you show me just nothing  
Like no one before
