On the lake  
The deep forbidden lake  
The old boats go gliding by  
And the leaves  
Are falling from the trees  
And landing on the logs and I  
See the turtles  
Heading for the bog  
And falling off the log  
They make the water splash  
And feeling no backlash  
They climb the happy banks  
  
On the boats  
The old and creaky boats  
The shoreline goes gliding by  
And the wind  
There was a dying breeze  
Is making the banners fly  
See the colors  
Floating in the sky  
The pride of the captains eye  
As he glides  
His slender craft inside  
And opens up the door  
  
On the coast  
The long and tempting coast  
The cards on the table lie  
And a speech  
So eloquent in reach  
Was made by a passerby  
Passing by the way between  
Here and left behind  
And it ripples through the crowds  
Who run and cast their doubts  
In the deep forbidden lake  
  
Yes it echoes through the crowds  
Who run and cast their doubts  
In the deep forbidden lake
