Twice bitten twice baked  
Twice led down the same mistake  
Try me on a Saturday try me  
Try me  
Fine fool for a holiday  
Slow sun in a Spanish way  
One heart for one week of May why me  
Why me  
Twice given to yesterday  
Right for a foray with fate  
Fly me home to heavens gate fly me  
Fly me Fly  
Twice bitten twice baked  
Twice led down the same mistake  
Try me on a Saturday try me  
Try me  
Try me try me
