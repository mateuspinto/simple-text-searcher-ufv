When Liberty Valance came to town  
The women folk would hide theyd hide  
When Liberty Valance walked around  
The men would step aside  
Because the point of a gun  
Was the only law that Liberty understood  
When it came to shooting straight and fast  
He was mighty good  
  
From out of the east a stranger came  
A law book in his hand  
A man the kind of man the west would need  
To ease a troubled land  
Because the point of a gun  
Was the only law that Liberty understood  
When it came to shooting straight and fast  
He was mighty good  
  
Many a man would face his gun  
And many a man would fall  
The man who shot Liberty Valance  
He shot Liberty Valance  
He was the bravest of them all  
  
Now the love of a woman can make a man  
Stay on when he should go stay on  
Just trying to build a peaceful life  
Where love is free to go  
But the point of a gun  
Was the only law that Liberty understood  
When it came to shooting straight and fast  
He was mighty good  
  
Alone and afraid she prayed that hed return  
That fateful night that night  
When nothing she said could keep her man  
From going out to fight  
But the point of a gun  
Was the only law that Liberty understood  
When it came to shooting straight and fast  
He was mighty good  
  
Out in the sun two shots rang out  
The shots made Liberty fall  
The man who shot Liberty Valance  
He shot Liberty Valance  
He was the bravest of them all
