Go to the hungry ones and fill them with his bread  
Theyll leave their darkness as you shine the light he shed  
Point to his promises believe in what he said  
And his joy will be manifest in you  
And the lost will be found as he works through you  
Out on the highways theres so many passing by  
Step out in boldness and watch the family multiply  
Pray up some miracles lets open up the sky  
And his joy will be manifest to you  
And the lost will be found by the things you do  
Oh dont you know that jesus loves you  
So lets go and spread his word  
Redeem the time while theres still time  
Lets share the call we heard lets share the call we heard  
Is your house open to let strangers enter there  
Give to the least of them show them someone cares  
And you may be entertaining angels unaware  
And his joy may be manifest to you  
And the lost may be found as he works through you  
And his joy will be manifest in you  
And the lost theyll be found by the things you do
