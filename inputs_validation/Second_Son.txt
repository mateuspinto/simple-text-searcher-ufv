Damned at birth the child king born  
The prophets warned beware the second son  
Born to lead And then raised in peace and harmony  
My fellow man and I live as one  
  
Together forever  
Forever in the kingdom of the son  
  
Watched in fear another day the final year  
The light that fills our sky begins to die  
Haunted dreamsI sleep in terror wake in screams  
The scent of burning flesh fills sacred skies  
  
Skies filled with slaughter  
And slaughter from the order in my mind  
  
History unfolds as the prophets had fortold  
And lightning strikes the fire fills my eyes  
Hell hath claimed another soul now  
Watch the spirit die  
  
Evil minds now rule my destiny  
A Sinner by my side wont set me free  
Thoughts of pain and power fill my veins  
All fear my name  
You were warned of the child born  
Beware  
  
Feel the fire Expect no mercy  
Olympus burns Father forgive me  
Know my wrath brother before me  
Beware
