The Abraham Lincoln town cars  
Arrive to dispose of our king and queen  
They orchestrated dramatic new scenes  
For Celebritarian needs  
  
When one world ends  
Something else begins  
But without a scream  
Just a whisper because we  
Just start it over again  
  
Do you love your guns  
Your god and your government  
Let me hear you  
Hey  
Do you love your guns  
Do you love your god and your government  
Let me hear you goddamn it  
Hey  
Do you love your guns  
And your god and your government  
Let me hear you  
Hey  
Your mother  
And your father  
And your baby  
Goddamn it let me hear you  
Hey  
Do you love your guns  
I want your mothers and your fathers  
To hear you say it  
Hey  
Every single one of you motherfuckers  
Let me hear it from you  
Hey  
Do you love your guns  
And your god and your government  
Hey  
I want to hear it from everyone  
I want to hear you say you want a gun  
Let me hear it  
Hey
