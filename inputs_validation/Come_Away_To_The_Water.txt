Come away little loss  
Come away to the water  
To the ones that are waiting only for you  
Come away little loss  
Come away to the water  
Away from the life that you always knew  
We are calling to you  
Come away little light  
Come away to the darkness  
In the shade of the night well come looking for you  
Come away little light  
Come away to the darkness  
To the ones appointed to see it through  
We are calling for you  
We are coming for you  
  
Come away little lamb  
Come away to the water  
Give yourself so we might live anew  
Come away little lamb  
Come away to the slaughter  
To the ones appointed to see this through  
We are calling for you  
We are coming for you  
  
Come away little lamb  
Come away to the water  
To the arms that are waiting only for you  
Come away little lamb come away to the slaughter  
To the one appointed to see this through  
We are calling for you  
We are coming for you  
We are coming for you  
We are coming for you
