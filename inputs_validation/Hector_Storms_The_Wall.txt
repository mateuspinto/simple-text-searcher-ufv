See my chariot run to your ships  
Ill drive you back in the sea  
You came here for gold  
The wall will not hold  
This day was promised to me  
The Gods are my shield  
My fate has been sealed  
Lightning and javelins fly  
Soon many will fall  
We are storming the wall  
Stones fall snow from the sky  
We will pay with our glory  
In the fire of battle  
Zeus today is mine  
Killing all in my way  
Like sheep and like eattle  
Smashing skulls of all who defy  
I spake not the hammer  
I spake not the sword  
This day will ring with my name  
None have to chase me  
Let he who will face me  
Kill me or die by the sword
