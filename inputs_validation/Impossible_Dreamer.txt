The street was loud  
From an angry crowd and  
I thought of you I thought of you  
Dreamer  
Land of the free  
No hungry bellies  
Impossible  
Impossible dreamer  
  
In the darkest part of the night  
Blue shadows conjure you  
And in the brightest height of the daylight  
Sometimes I blink cause I think I see you  
Dreaming like you do  
  
The moon was bright  
Like day for night  
And I thought of you  
I thought of you  
Dreamer  
No acid rain  
Love without pain  
Impossible  
Impossible Dreamer  
  
In the darkest part of the night  
Blue shadows conjure you  
And at the brightest height of the daylight  
Sometimes I blink cause I think I see you  
Dreaming like you do  
  
The room was dark  
And full of sharks  
And I thought of you  
I thought of you  
Dreamer  
Give peace a chance  
Dont think just dance  
Impossible  
Impossible dreamer  
  
In the darkest part of the night  
Blue shadows conjure you  
And at the brightest height of the daylight  
Sometimes I blink cause I think I see you  
Dreaming like you do
