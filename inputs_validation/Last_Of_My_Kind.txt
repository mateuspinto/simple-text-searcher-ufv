So young so braise and so unholy  
I come to you in painted skies  
Youre broken taint your ancient story  
The living challenge you their lies  
  
Trapped in the cold outside  
There aint no shelter  
And they want to force my hand  
Until I take what I wanted  
And break all their lies  
And defeat the fucking liars  
Smash all the temples  
And crawl through the rubble  
And cry to the fallen  
  
Im the last of my kind still standing  
Im the last of my kind still standing on the wall  
  
Oh from out upon the hillside  
I am but what theyve thrown away  
I go to sleep behind the eight ball  
I live to fight for one more day  
  
Im trapped in the cold outside  
There aint no shelter  
And they want to force my hand  
Until I take what I wanted  
And break all their lies  
And defeat the fucking liars  
Smash all the temples  
And crawl through the rubble  
And cry to the fallen  
  
Take what I wanted  
And break all the lies  
And defeat the fucking liars  
Smash all the temples  
And crawl through the rubble  
And cry to the fallen  
  
Im the last of my kind still standing  
Im the last of my kind still standing on the wall  
  
Im the last of my kind still standing  
Im the last of my kind still standing on the wall  
  
The last of my kind still standing  
The last of my kind still standing
