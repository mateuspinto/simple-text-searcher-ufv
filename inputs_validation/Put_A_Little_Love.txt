She stood outside  
In the middle of the night  
Looking so far away  
As far as she could see  
Where the sky meets the land  
Looking for answers  
Her life is falling apart  
Her marriage is on the rocks  
She thinks about her mother  
She thinks about her children  
She thinks about the church  
And everybody that thought  
They had it made in heaven  
Suddenly the comfort  
In the house dont mean nothing  
All she needs is some loving  
In her life  
Oh God  
  
Put a little love  
In my world  
  
In her mind  
The dream is still alive  
But if you ask me  
I cant tell you right now  
Its a losing battle  
Her mother told her  
About this time  
The vows she took  
Were a mere formality  
But in her life  
They became a reality  
And by the look of things  
Shes fighting a losing battle  
Joleen is about to take her man  
Why do bad things happen  
To good people  
She thinks about her mother  
She thinks about her children  
She thinks about the church  
Suddenly the money in the house  
Dont mean nothing  
All she needs is love  
  
Put a little love  
In my world  
Put a little love  
In my world  
Put a little love  
In my world
