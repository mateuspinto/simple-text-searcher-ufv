That certain night the night we met  
There was magic abroad in the air  
There were angels dining at the ritz  
And a nightingale sang in berkeley square  
  
I may be right i may be wrong  
But im perfectly willing to swear  
That when you turned and smiled at me  
A nightingale sang in berkeley square  
  
The moon that lingered over londontown  
Poor puzzled moon he wore a frown  
How could he know that we two were so in love  
The whole darn world seemed upside down  
  
The streets of town were paved with stars  
It was such a romantic affair  
And as we kissed and said goodnight  
A nightingale sang in berkeley square  
  
When dawn came stealing up all gold and blue  
To interrupt our rendezvous  
I still remember how you smiled and said  
was that a dream or was it true  
  
Our homeward step was just as light  
As the dancing of fred astaire  
And like an echo far away  
A nightingale sang in berkeley square
