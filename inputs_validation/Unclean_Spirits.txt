Holy Lord Almighty Father  
Everylasting God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ  
Who sent your only begotten son into the world  
To crush that lion  
Strike terror Lord into the Beast  
Let your mighty hand cast him out of your servant  
Sarah Lafayette  
So he may no longer hold captive this prisoner  
  
I cast you you unclean spirit  
In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ  
It is he who commands you  
It is God himself who commands you  
By this sign of Holy Cross  
Give way to Christ  
The power of Christ compells you  
The power of Christ compells you  
The powerthe power
