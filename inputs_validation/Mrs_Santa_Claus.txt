Who feeds the reindeer all their hay  
Who wraps the gifts and packs the sleigh  
Whos helping Santa every day  
Mrs Santa Claus  
  
Who keeps his red suit looking nice  
Who does he turn to for advice  
Who gives the brownies all their spice  
Mrs Santa Claus  
  
She pitter patters all around the workshop  
The whole year long  
Amid the happy clatter of the workshop  
She sings a merry merry Christmas song  
  
Who reads the notes from girls and boys  
Turns in the order for their toys  
Fills every heart with wondrous joys  
Mrs Santa Claus
