Chorus  
Sweet dreams  
  
On this Midsummer might  
Everyone is sleeping  
We go driving into the moonlight  
  
Could be in a dream  
Our clothes are on the beach  
These prints of our feet  
Lead right up to the sea  
No one no one is here  
No one no one is here  
We stand in the Atlantic  
We become panoramic  
  
We tire of the city  
We tire of it all  
We long for just that something more  
  
Could be in a dream  
Our clothes are on the beach  
These prints of our feet  
Lead right up to the sea  
No one no one is here  
No one no one is here  
We stand in the Atlantic  
We become panoramic  
  
The stars are caught in our hair  
The stars are on our fingers  
A veil of diamond dust  
Just reach up and touch it  
The skys above our heads  
The seas around our legs  
In milky silky water  
We swim further and further  
We dive down  
We dive down  
  
A diamond night a diamond sea  
And a diamond sky  
  
We dive deeper and deeper  
We dive deeper and deeper  
Could be we are here  
Could be we are in a dream  
It came up on the horizon  
Rising and rising  
In a sea of honey a sky of honey  
A sea of honey a sky of honey  
  
Chorus  
  
Look at the light all the time its a changing  
Look at the light climbing up the aerial  
Bright white coming alive jumping off of the aerial  
All the time its a changing like now  
All the time its a changing like then again  
All the time its a changing  
And all the dreamers are waking
