Ohh ah yeah  
  
U work so hard U really do  
I dont think that anyone could ever work as hard as U  
Hot desert sun U can feel the heat  
Every drop of sweat on your brow is what I am so U best believe  
  
Chorus  
I got 1000 hugs and kisses 4 U when U come back home baby Ooh woo  
I got 1000 hugs and kisses 4 U when U come back home baby Ooh woo  
  
When U give em your all and still its only second best  
U can come and lay your head upon your babys chest  
Every one of your worries all your miseries All your miseries  
U can put them in the little book and ship them off 2 sea  
Cuz  
  
Chorus  
  
Ohh ah yeah  
  
I got a 1000 hugs and kisses U when U come back home  
Come here  
  
The world can be well 2 put it frankly such a bitch sometimes  
Seems like love that lasts 4ever is so damn hard 2 find  
Seems like all we ever find is another reason 2 cry  
As long as U got me I got your back and this is why  
  
U work so hard U really do  
I dont think that anyone could ever work as hard as U  
Better lock the door U better unplug the phone  
Cuz Im gonna give 1000 reasons why we need 2 be alone  
  
Chorus  
  
I got 1000 hugs and kisses baby when U get back home  
When U get back home  
Oh yeah  
  
I wanna hold U wrap U up in lace  
And I wanna kiss U kiss U all over your face  
I wanna love U all up and down  
I got 1000 hugs and kisses 4 U when U come back home baby  
Give U love like U never had all ungagged and bound  
Ooh yeah Ohh
