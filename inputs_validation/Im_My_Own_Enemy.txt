From now on Im dancing with myself  
To the sound of a blue and broken string  
Left behind with the dust upon a shelf  
The remains of a long forgotten song  
All that we had but now again  
I stand alone all love has an end  
You cannot see this is my destiny  
Im my own enemy  
In my life there was noone like you  
You cannot see this is my reality  
Im my own enemy  
In my life there was noone like you  
From now on Im sleeping with my shadow  
In the night my thoughts can be my own  
All the pain and all this endless sorrow  
I miss you more than I will ever know  
Holding you never again  
It cannot be all love has an end  
You cannot see this is my destiny  
Im my own enemy  
In my life there was noone like you  
You cannot see this is my reality  
Im my own enemy  
In my life there was noone like you  
Now I know there is noone that is waiting  
At the end of that long and winding road  
Memories in the dead of night are calling  
All the way I carry on my heavy load  
All that we had but now again  
I stand alone all love has an end  
You cannot see this is my destiny  
Im my own enemy  
In my life there was noone like you  
You cannot see this is my reality  
Im my own enemy  
In my life there was noone like you
