Quickly checking what company hes in  
Absorbing values like a chameleon  
His rhythm and his method have got out of line  
When you sit on a fence you get a sore behind  
  
Must not upset the apple cart  
Hell choose your views today  
Having some kinda conflict  
Seems to get right in his way  
  
Chorus  
Whoarubber morals  
Whoarubber morals  
Whoarubber morals plasticine ideals  
See how this one feels  
  
The men in st peters will not agree to a slipping  
On his conscience like he slips on a johnnie  
Hes a part time socialist and a part time tycoon  
Flags of convenience fly in his cocoon  
  
Must not upset the apple cart  
Preserve the status quo  
His heart felt convictions  
Left a long time ago  
  
A sign over his bed will testify  
Is there nothing in his life from which hed live or die  
A pale shade of grey lines a vacant head  
With our condomnation you are blessed  
  
Must not upset the apple cart  
Hell choose your views today  
Having some kinda conflict  
Seems to get right in his way
