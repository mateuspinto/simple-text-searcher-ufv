Are you there  
Putting all the words together  
Painting your new masterpiece  
Ocean air  
Carrying reminders of that perfect pair  
We use to be  
  
Someday everything ends  
Can we begin  
Finding our way back before were too late  
And lost in between  
The truth and the dream  
Ive never been more ready to move on  
  
Changing keys  
Giving up on me to find familiar things  
And try blending in  
Know this please  
I will not forget the sound of you and me  
When we were friends  
  
Someday everything ends  
Can we begin  
Finding our way back before were too late  
And lost in between  
The truth and the dream  
Ive never been more ready to move on  
  
Bring walls down  
Hear all my sound  
Let me back in  
Love me again  
  
Bring walls down  
Hear all my sound  
Let me back in  
Love me again  
Yeah  
  
Bring walls down  
Hear all my sound  
Let me back in  
Love me again
