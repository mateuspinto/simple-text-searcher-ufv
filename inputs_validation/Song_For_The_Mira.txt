Song For The Mira  
Out on the Mira one warm afternoon  
Old men go fishing with black line and spoon  
And if they catch nothing they never complain  
I wish I was with them again  
As boys in their boats call to girls on the shore  
Teasing the one that they really adore  
And into the evening the courting begins  
I wish I was with them again  
Chorus  
Can you imagine a piece of the universe  
More fit for princes and kings  
Ill give you ten of your cities  
For Marion Bridge and the pleasure it brings  
Out on the Mira on soft summer nights  
Bonfires blaze to the childrens delight  
They dance round the flames singing songs with their friends  
I wish I was with them again  
And over the ashes the stories are told  
Of witches and werewolves and Oak Island gold  
The stars on the river they sparkle and spin  
I wish I was with them again  
Chorus  
Out on the Mira the people are kind  
Theyll treat you to homebrew and help you unwind  
And if you come broken theyll see that you mend  
I wish I was with them again  
And thus I conclude with a wish you go well  
Sweet be your dreams may your happiness swell  
Ill leave you here for my journey begins  
Im going to be with them going to be with them  
Im going to be with them again
