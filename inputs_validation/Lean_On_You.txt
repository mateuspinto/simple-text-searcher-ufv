The firt step to heaven  
I will take in my life  
I am not afraid when  
I can hold you tight  
If there must be an answer  
Then there must be a prayer  
And you must be the angel  
When youre standing there  
So I lean on you I lean on you  
  
My life is such a statement  
Of my hopes and despairs  
But nothing really matters  
Just as long as youre there  
You love me such honesty  
You love with no gain  
You speak to me so tender  
And you never explain  
So I lean on you I lean on you  
My baby she cares  
Its so easy to do  
My baby she tells me what to do  
She always tells me the truth  
My baby she cares  
Its so easy to do  
My baby knows what Im gonna do  
Thats why I lean on you  
  
I dream of an island  
Of a fantasy place  
Where I can go to sometimes  
And no one can trace  
Well such is the nature  
The nature of love  
That when we dream it  
Sometimes means that we need love  
So I lean on you I lean on you  
My baby she cares  
Its so easy to do  
My baby she tells me what to do  
She always tells me the truth  
My baby she cares  
Its so easy to do  
My baby knows what Im gonna do  
Thats why Im gonna lean on you  
  
So I lean on you I lean on you  
I lean on you so I lean on you  
my baby she cares its so easy to do  
my baby knows what Im gonna do  
thats why Im gonna lean on you  
whooo oooh oooh ooohrepeat chorus  
my baby she loves me  
whooo oooh oooh
