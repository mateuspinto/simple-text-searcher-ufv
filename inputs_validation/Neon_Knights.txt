Oh no here it comes again  
Cant remember when we came so close to love before  
Hold on good things never last  
Nothings in the past it always seems to come again  
Again and again and again  
  
Cry out to legions of the brave  
Time again to save us from the jackals of the street  
Ride out protectors of the realm  
Captains at the helm sail across the sea of lights  
  
Circles and rings dragons and kings  
Weaving a charm and a spell  
Blessed by the night holy and bright  
Called by the toll of the bell  
  
Bloodied angels fast descending  
Moving on a neverbending light  
Phantom figures free forever  
Out of shadows shining everbright  
  
Chorus  
Neon Knights  
Neon Knights  
All right  
  
Cry out to legions of the brave  
Time again to save us from the jackals of the street  
Ride out protectors of the realm  
Capatins at the helm sail across the sea of lights  
Again and again again and again and again  
  
Chorus
