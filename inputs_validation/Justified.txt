Ive tried everything I know  
Just to earn a piece of mercy for my soul  
Despite my strain  
Guilty I remained  
Then I found forgiveness  
I found grace  
All condemnation Youve erased  
Taking my death and giving me life  
I have been justified  
You gave hope a place to stand  
Paying all the cost Your holiness demands  
Free from all  
All that I deserve  
I found forgiveness  
I found grace  
All condemnation Youve erased  
Taking my death and giving me life  
I have been justified  
Freedom from my darkest hours  
Freedom to be in the light  
Freedom I am blameless in Your sight  
I found forgiveness  
I found grace  
All condemnation Youve erased  
Taking my death and giving me life  
I have been justified
