In the wee hours of the morning  
After all have gone to bed  
Yes I go all to myself  
Think of things that you have said  
Yeah but I fall asleep do you wonder  
If there is anything for me ahead  
  
I fell in love with you baby  
Before I even held your hand  
And you were still in your teens  
Too young to understand  
But when you looked at me and smiled darling  
Thats when it all began  
  
You know I was just sitting here thinking  
About the things we used to do  
Ah but you now belong to someone else  
And Im still in love with you  
You know I wonder I wonder  
Will I ever be back with you
