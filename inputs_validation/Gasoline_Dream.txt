Wishful thinking eyes are blinking  
In the sun the garbage stinking  
To ignore the rancid wont make it go away  
  
Untruth spoke through blistered lip  
Unclean thoughts that take the step  
Down upon the roaches  
Wont go away  
  
Born to follow  
To be the first to swallow  
Garbage from the plate  
Now to borrow  
A match ignite the gasoline  
To burn away  
  
Surviving through a gasoline dream  
In the month the razon blade gleam  
Slashing up the tongue wont make it go away  
On a binge of self destruction  
  
Children of the reconstruction  
Suck the tit of discontent  
Go away  
  
Slam slam down  
Respond in kind malcontent  
Dont go away  
Burn burn down  
  
Temple of the conscience  
Dont go away  
  
I was soaked in gasoline  
Playin with a match  
I was everything I seemed  
They stood and watched  
  
Ate from your table  
Ate from your hand  
Eight days of waiting  
Buried in the sand  
  
Burn in a gasoline dream burn away my love  
Burn away the conscience burn away my love  
Take away my dignity take away my pain  
Take just for taking we are one in the same  
  
Burn Burn  
Burn in a gasoline dream burn away my love  
Burn away the conscience burn away my love
