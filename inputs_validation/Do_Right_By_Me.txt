Sometimes you treat me so cruel  
I dont think I can take it  
Sometimes you hurt me so bad I just want to die  
But in a moment like this  
With a tender touch and a lovers kiss  
You put all of my  
pain aside and I say to you with my eyes  
  
Chorus  
Do right by me and make it last forever  
Tonight I need to be here in your arms  
Where the hurting ends and the love begins  
Do right by me and Ill never do you wrong  
  
It feels so good to be so close like we were when  
we started oh back when the troubles were few  
and the loving was blind  
Funny how people so close  
Know the things to  
say that can hurt the most  
Baby why cant we just be kind and capture this moment in time  
  
Chorus
