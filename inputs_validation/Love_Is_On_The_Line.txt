Love Is On The Line  
  
Love Is On The Line  
  
  
I love the way you move me  
But baby you move me too fast  
I dig it when you hold me  
But I want to be sure it will last  
I smile when you are with me  
Even when you hold my hand  
So good I cant believe it  
But I want you to understand  
  
A woman needs a little space to contemplate  
And it always seems to me  
That good things come to those who wait  
  
Love is on the line  
Time is on our side  
Want it to be right  
Want it to be mine  
Love is on the line  
  
You tell me what youre feeling  
Keeping me up with the score  
You give me all I need I couldnt ask for more  
  
A woman needs a little space to contemplate  
And it always seems to me  
That good things come to those who wait  
  
Love is on the line  
Time is on our side  
Want it to be right  
Want it to be mine  
Love is on the line  
  
You could be the one forever  
Id be happy ever more  
But if were to be together Baby I got to be sure  
  
A woman needs some space to contemplate  
And it always seems to me  
That good things  good things good things  
  
Love is on the line  
Time is on our side  
Want it to be right  
Want it to be mine  
Love is on the line  
  
  
Love is on the line
