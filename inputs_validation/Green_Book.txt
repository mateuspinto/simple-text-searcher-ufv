My coat is black and the moon is yellow  
Here is where I get off  
As you can see for yourself old girl in the Green Book  
I tango down to the smoky lobby  
My eyes adjust to the light  
The new cashier looks like Jill St John  
Can that be right  
Im rolling into the bar at Joeys  
Theyre getting ready to close  
And here she comes very Kiss Me Deadly  
My life my love my third hand rose  
Flash ahead to a yummy playback  
Just you and me in a room  
Double dreaming a page at a time in the Green Book  
  
The torso rocks and the eyes are keepers  
Now whered we sample those legs  
Im thinking Marilyn 40 in the Green Book  
I like the neon I love the music  
Anachronistic but nice  
The seamless segue from fun to fever  
Its a sweet device  
Im so in love with this dirty city  
This crazy grid of desire  
The festive icons along the way  
The boardwalk the lovers the house on fire  
Shes kinda cute but a little younger  
Shes got the mood and the moves  
Its kinda scary to dig yourself in the Green Book
