Im on the inside  
Im on your side  
And each thought stings  
  
I can think straight  
It overflowing  
It overflowing  
It coming down  
It overflowing  
It sinking  
It overflowing  
  
It some savior  
you fall into  
And each love stings  
I can think straight  
  
It overflowing  
It overflowing  
It coming down  
It overflowing  
I sinking  
It overflowing  
It coming down  
It overflowing  
It sinking  
It overflowing  
It coming down
