Come now lady dont you do me wrong  
I fell for you and now it wont be long  
Before I hold you in my arms  
Before I take you to my heart again  
  
Time is flying by us every day  
I want to show my love in every way  
I wanna hold you in my arms  
I wanna take you to my heart again  
  
If you believe it you can stay all night  
Hide in the darkness til its getting light  
Do everything until weve got it done  
Then sing hosanna to the morning sun  
Hosanna hosanna  
Sing hosanna to the morning sun  
  
Come down lady dont put up a fight  
If you are true you know the time is right  
For me to hold you in my arms  
For me to take you to my heart  
  
If you believe it we can stay all night  
Hide in the darkness til its getting light  
Do everything until weve got it done  
Then sing hosanna to the morning sun  
Hosanna hosanna  
  
Sing hosanna to the morning sun  
Hosanna hosanna
