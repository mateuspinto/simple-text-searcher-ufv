Porter Wagoner  
He left me love enough to last a lifetime  
A lifetime filled with loving memories  
And so I have no reason to search for new love  
Time could never take his love from me  
And my mind is filled with memories sweet and tender  
My heart is filled with love he left for me  
And each thought of him just makes love grow sweeter  
He left me love to last eternally  
I just close my eyes and I still see him  
And in dreams he loves me just like he used to do  
He even wakes me with a tender kiss every mornin  
A kiss that lingers on my lips the whole day through  
And my mind is filled with memories sweet and tender  
And my heart is filled with love he left for me  
And each thought of him just makes love grow sweeter  
He left me love to last eternally  
Oh yes he left me love
