Mr Mambo repeat  
Ive been waiting for the weekend  
To go out and have some fun  
Well the stars shine just like sequins  
And my heart beats like a machine gun  
All my friends all need to party  
Most of them are on the floor  
Well I feel like Im in heaven  
As that boy walks through the door  
Ooh I hope he notices  
And when he looks me in the eye  
Gotta have a beat now  
Thats why Im countin on you  
Please Mr Mambo  
Strike up the combo  
And let the music sway  
Please Mr Mambo  
Just one more song now  
So we can shake the night away  
Here he comes so clean and ready  
As hes rockin to the beat  
As he gets closer Im breathin heavy  
Lookin down at my own feet  
An in a second hes right before me  
Askin me for a dance  
I look up slowly feelin the glory  
As he takes me by the hand  
Ooh I wanna feel the rhythm  
Ooh Ive gotta feel the groove now  
I know its your decision  
Thats why Im countin on you  
Please Mr Mambo  
Just on sambo  
And let the music sway  
Please Mr Mambo  
Just one more song so  
We can swing the night away  
  
Like it was Mardi Gras Night at the mall and everyone who was anybody was
there  
There was some kind of like Limbo contest  
Oh no it was Mr Natural Brazil you know no steroids  
Oh and then like this gorgeous guy come up and asked me to dance  
Well like I got so nervous I split my diet soft drink on him  
Well that kind of bummed the evening out for us  
And just as I was trying to dry him for off the music started  
Like I had never heard this type of music before  
I had no experience with this strange beat  
It sounded like they stole it from like the I Love Lucy show  
And then like this guy came out  
He was like so for sure for sure  
He had like wing tip shoes on and like this funny little red hat on  
Like oh wow that was the night Mr Mambo changed my life  
Mr Mambo repeat and fade with following  
Please Mr Mambo  
Strike up the combo  
And let this music sway  
Please Mr Mambo  
Just one more song now  
So we can dance the night away  
Please Mr Mambo  
Strike up the combo  
So we can shake the night away
