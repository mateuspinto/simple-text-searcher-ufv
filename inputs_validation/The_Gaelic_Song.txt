Through the ages through war pestilence and sleet the Celtic culture has
survived its songs and dances passed from father to son from mother to
daughter from uncle to goat And though few still speak Gaelic the ancient
language of the Celts all hearts are still stirred by the beautiful tones of
this mellifluous tongue  
  
Ah ma wee hach patew mae bo clee hach maneagh  
Heow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow bark meow  
Saigh hough loo loo cheow dach hagh vreigh chouach mouheaugh  
Douauh meah mae couchah moo ma meagh pach hooragh  
  
And though other cultures tried to destroy them driven no doubt by their
jealousy of the Celts fine fashion sense and edible cuisine they did not
surrender Actually they surrendered quite often but they were never
entirely wiped out clinging to the corners of small islands their voices
raised in song the clarion call of the pipes ringing out to the heavens  
  
Undescribably beautiful pennywhistle solo  
  
Ah ma wee hach patew mae bo clee hach maneagh  
Heow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow bark meow  
Saigh hough loo loo cheow dach hagh vreigh chouach mouheaugh  
Douauh meah mae couchah moo ma meagh pach hooragh  
  
Ah ma wee hach patew mae bo clee hach maneagh  
Heow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow bark meow  
Saigh hough loo loo cheow dach hagh vreigh chouach mouheaugh  
Douauh meah mae couchah moo ma meagh pach hooragh
