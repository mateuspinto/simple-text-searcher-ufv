If the mother goes to sleep with you  
Will you run and tell geraldo  
If the mother bears your children without tears  
Without the usual costs of labor  
  
If the mother goes to bed with you  
Will you run and tell the neighbors  
Will you hide behind that get up that you wear  
Or will take te first ear that comes into contact with your blade  
Like peter did on the hill  
  
Will you call her a freak  
Will you call them freaks  
  
If the mother goes to bed with you  
Will you run and tell the papers  
How she picked you from a line up in downtown philadelphia  
With a cigarette hangin out of your mouth and henry miller in your back
pocket  
You little fucker  
  
If the mother goes to bed with you  
In the bowels of the cathedral  
Will you render her asunder with what she really needs  
Or will you crash that beautiful silence with some talk about  
Finding yourself in you mothers arms  
  
Will you call her a freak  
Will you call them freaks  
Or will you call them gods  
Will you call them freaks  
  
You know you sperm is weak  
You never looked so high  
To ever find her so low  
You did not have to go that far  
To show her you were holy  
  
Now you know theyre gonna come for you  
And drag your silly name into the mud  
If the mother bears your children without tears  
And without the usual costs of labor  
  
Will you call her a freak  
Will you call them freaks  
Or will you call them gods  
Will you call them freaks
