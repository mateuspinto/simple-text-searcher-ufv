Gimme gimme gimme some candy baby  
I got the crave I got to fill  
Lemme lemme lemme some money maybe  
Im gonna buy everything you sell  
Take it on down take what you want yeah  
Pay me later gotta place to be  
Move it on in take it on over  
Whats that face you know me  
  
Here but now its gone  
Here to carry on  
Nothing more to say  
Your mind has gone away  
  
Chorus  
Unholy fill the moment out  
Of your mind  
The damn has spilled the secret out  
Deaf dumb and blind  
  
want towant to give ya what youre looking for  
Make it all better like I did before right  
When you find when you find you gotta choice  
And the screams you hear are your own voice  
Turn it on up turn it into stone  
Love me later gotta gotta go  
Move it on in take it on home  
Wipe that face you dont know  
  
Here but now its gone  
Here to carry on  
Nothing more to say  
Your mind has gone away  
  
Chorus  
  
Live your life  
Live it through me  
Leave your mind  
Where it should be  
Is the truth  
So hard to find  
Is the truth  
Out of your mind  
  
Here but now its gone  
Here to carry on  
Nothing more to say  
Your mind has gone away  
  
Chorus
