As I lay me down  
Heaven hear me now  
Im lost without a cause  
After giving it my all  
  
Winter storms have come  
And darkened my sun  
After all that Ive been through  
Who on earth can I turn to  
  
I look to you  
I look to you  
  
After all my strength is gone  
In you I can be strong  
  
I look to you  
I look to you  
  
Yeah  
  
And when melodies are gone  
In you I hear a song  
  
I look to you  
  
After losing my breath  
Theres no more fighting left  
Sinking to rise no more  
Searching for that open door  
  
And every road that Ive taken  
Led to my regret  
And I dont know if Im gonna make it  
Nothing to do but lift my head  
  
I look to you  
I look to you  
  
Yeah  
  
And when all my strength is gone  
In you I can be strong  
  
I look to you  
I look to you  
  
Oh yeah  
  
And when melodies are gone  
In you I hear a song  
  
I look to you  
  
my levies have broken my walls have come  
  
Coming down on me  
  
crumbling down on me  
  
All the rain is falling  
  
the rain is falling defeat is calling  
  
Set me free  
  
I need you to set me free  
  
Take me far away from the battle  
I need you  
Shine on me  
  
I look to you  
I look to you  
  
After all my strength has gone  
In you I can be strong  
  
I look to you  
I look to you  
  
And when melodies are gone  
In you I hear a song  
  
I look to you  
  
Yeah  
  
I look to you  
I look to you
