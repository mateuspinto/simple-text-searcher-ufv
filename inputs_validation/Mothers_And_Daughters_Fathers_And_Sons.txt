And so they came with perfect schemes  
And precious dreams that made them one  
One by one  
  
Oh and there they stood lost in the haze  
With spirits blazing like the sun  
Mothers and daughters  
Fathers and sons  
  
They held the light  
Yes they did  
And it shined all night  
Oh all night  
And they took the blows  
Yes they did  
Never letting go  
Oh no oh no  
Oh no  
  
And so they came with perfect schemes  
And precious dreams that made them one  
One by one  
  
Oh look up and see the eagles fly  
And fill the sky beneath the sun  
Mothers and daughters  
Fathers and sons  
  
You hold the light  
Yes you do  
And youve got the right  
Oh got the right  
And youll feel the blows  
Yes you will  
Dont you dare let go  
Oh no oh no  
  
Said that we have the right  
Yes we do  
Its down in black and white  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
And we made it so  
Yes we did  
And we wont let go  
Oh no oh no
