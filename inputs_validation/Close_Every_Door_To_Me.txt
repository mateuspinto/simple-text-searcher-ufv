Joseph  
Close every door to me  
Hide all the world from me  
Bar all the windows  
And shut out the light  
Do what you want with me  
Hate me and laugh at me  
Darken my daytime  
And torture my night  
If my life were important I  
Would ask will I live or die  
But I know the answers  
Lie far from this world  
  
Close every door to me  
Keep those I love from me  
Children of Israel are never alone  
For I know I shall find  
My own peace of mind  
For I have been promised  
A land of my own  
  
Choir  
Close every door to me  
Hide All the world from me  
Bar all the windows  
And shut out the light  
  
La La La La La La La La La La  
La La La La La La La La La La  
La La La La La La La La La La  
La La La La La La La La La La  
  
Joseph  
Just give me a number  
Instead of my name  
Forget all about me  
And let me decay  
  
I do not matter  
Im only one person  
Destroy me completely  
Then throw me away  
If my life were important I  
Would ask will I live or die  
But I know the answers  
Lie far from this world  
  
Close every door to me  
Keep those I love from me  
Children of Israel  
Are never alone  
For we know we shall find  
Our own piece of mind  
For we have been promised  
A land of our own
