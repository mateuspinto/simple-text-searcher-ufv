Hey Hey Hey Hey  
  
Look at the sky turn a hell fire red  
Somebodys house is burnin down down down down  
Down down down  
  
Well I asked my friend where is that black smoke comin from  
He just coughed and changed the subject and  
said oh wa I think it might snow some  
So I left him sippin his tea an I jumped in my chariot  
And rode off to see just why and who could it be this time  
  
Sisters and brothers daddys mothers standin round cryin  
When I reached the scene the flames were makin a ghostly whine  
So I stood on my horses back an I screamed without a crack  
I say oh baby whyd you burn your brothers house down  
  
Hey  Hey  Hey  Hey   
  
Look out the sky turn a hell fire red Lord  
Somebodys house is burnin down down down down  
Look out the sky turn a hell fire red Lord  
Somebodys house is burnin down down down down down  
  
Well someone stepped from the crowd he was nineteen miles high  
He shouts retired and disgusted so we paint red through the sky  
I said the truth is straight ahead so dont burn yourself instead  
Try to learn instead of burn hear what I say yeah yeah  
  
So I finly rode away but Ill never forget that day  
Cause when I reached the valley I looked way down cross the way  
A giant boat from space landed with eerie grace  
And came and taken all the dead away  
  
Hey  Hey  Hey  Hey   
  
Whatd I say  
Look at the sky turn a hell fire red Lord  
Somebodys house is burning down down down down  
Look at the sky turn a hell fire red Lord  
Somebodys house is burning down down down down  
Look at the sky look at the sky  
  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh ooh  
Oh baby
