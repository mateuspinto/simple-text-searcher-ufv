By Bob Dylan  
  
If you getcha one girl better get two  
Case you run into Gypsy Lou  
Shes a ramblin woman with a ramblin mind  
Always leavin somebody behind  
Hey round the bend  
Gypsy Lous gone again  
Gypsy Lous gone again  
  
Well I seen the whole country through  
Just to find Gypsy Lou  
Seen it up seen it down  
Followin Gypsy Lou around  
Hey round the bend  
Gypsy Lous gone again  
Gypsy Lous gone again  
  
Well I gotta stop and take some rest  
My poor feet are second best  
My poor feet are wearin thin  
Gypsy Lous gone again  
Hey gone again  
Gypsy Lous round the bend  
Gypsy Lous round the bend  
  
Well seen her up in old Cheyenne  
Turned my head and away she ran  
From Denver Town to Wichita  
Last I heard shes in Arkansas  
Hey round the bend  
Gypsy Lous gone again  
Gypsy Lous gone again  
  
Well I tell you what if you what if you want to do  
Tell you what youll wear out your shoes  
If you want to wear out your shoes  
Try and follow Gypsy Lou  
Hey gone again  
Gypsy Lous round the bend  
Gypsy Lous round the bend  
  
Well Gypsy Lou I been told  
Livin down on Gallus Road  
Gallus Road Arlington  
Moved away to Washington  
Hey round the bend  
Gypsy Lous gone again  
Gypsy Lous gone again  
  
Well I went down to Washington  
Then she went to Oregon  
I skipped the ground and hopped a train  
Shes back in Gallus Road again  
Hey I cant win  
Gypsy Lous gone again  
Gypsy Lous gone again  
  
Well the last I heard of Gypsy Lou  
Shes in a Memphis calaboose  
She left one too many a boy behind  
He committed suicide  
Hey you cant win  
Gypsy Lous gone again  
Gypsy Lous gone again
