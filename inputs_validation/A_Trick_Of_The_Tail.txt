Bored of the life on the city of gold  
Hed left and let nobody know  
Gone were the towers he had known from a child  
Alone with the dream of a life  
He traveled the wide open road  
The blinkered arcade  
In search of another to share in his life  
Nowhere  
Everyone looked so strange to him  
  
Theyve got no horns and theyve got no tail  
They dont even know of our existence  
Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold  
That lies in the deep distance he cried  
  
And wept as they led him away to a cage  
Beast that can talk read the sign  
The creatures they pushed and they prodded his frame  
And questioned his story again  
But soon they grew bored of their prey  
Beast that can talk  
More like a freak or publicity stunt  
Oh  
No  
  
Theyve got no horns and theyve got no tail  
They dont even know of our existence  
Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold  
That lies in the deep distance he cried  
  
And broke down the door of the cage and marched on out  
He grabbed a creature by the scruff of his neck pointing out  
There beyond the bounds of you weak imagination  
Lie the noble towers of my city bright and gold  
Let me take you there show you a living story  
Let me show you others such as me  
Why did I ever leave  
  
Theyve got no horns and theyve got no tail  
They dont even know of our existence  
Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold  
That lies in the deep distance he cried  
And wept  
  
And so we set out with the best and his horns  
And his crazy description of home  
After many days journey we came to a peak  
Where the beast gazed abroad and cried out  
We followed his gaze and we thought that maybe we saw  
A spire of gold  no a trick of the eye thats all  
But the beast was gone and a voice was heard  
  
Theyve got no horns and theyve got no tail  
They dont even know of our existence  
Am I wrong to believe in a city of gold  
That lies in the deep distance
