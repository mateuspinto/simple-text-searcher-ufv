A midnight swim  
Is what Im needing  
A careless whim  
A fast for feeding  
  
I take to the deep  
Where the lights been til now  
Gotta break out and find  
What the day left behind  
  
So into blue  
Begin an ark  
The man was you  
True and spark oh  
  
I take to the deep  
Where the lights been til now safe  
Gotta break and out and find  
What the day left behind  
  
Now  
No no no  
Whoa no no no  
Whoa no no no  
Whoa ah  
  
Water and salt  
Secrets like new  
Arrive salt  
A midnight swim  
  
I take to the deep  
Where the lights until now asleep  
Gotta break in and find  
What the day left behind  
  
No  
No no no  
Whoa  
No no no  
Whoa  
No no  
Whoa  
Aha
