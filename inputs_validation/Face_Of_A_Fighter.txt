These lines in my face caused from worry  
Grow deeper as you walk out of sight  
Mine is the face of a fighter  
But my heart has just lost the fight  
  
Round one you told me you loved me  
An I felt my heart falling there an then  
The last round you walked tall an left me  
An I guess my hearts losing again  
  
Mine is the face of a fighter  
I fought for your love with all my might  
Mine is the face of fighter  
But my heart has just lost the fight  
  
Yes mine is the face of a fighter  
I fought for your love with all my might  
Mine is the face of fighter  
But my heart has just lost the fight
