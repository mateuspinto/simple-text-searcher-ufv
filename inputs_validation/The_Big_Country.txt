I see the shapes  
I remember from maps  
I see the shoreline  
I see the whitecaps  
A baseball diamond nice weather down there  
I see the school and the houses where the kids are  
Places to park by the factries and buildings  
Restaurants and bar for later in the evening  
Then we come to the farmlands and the undeveloped areas  
And I have learned how these things work together  
I see the parkway that passes through them all  
And I have learned how to look at these things and I say  
  
Chorus  
I wouldnt live there if you paid me  
I wouldnt live like that no siree  
I wouldnt do the things the way those people do  
I wouldnt live there if you paid me to  
  
I guess its healthy I guess the air is clean  
I guess those people have fun with their neighbors and friends  
Look at that kitchen and all of that food  
Look at them eat it guess it tastes real good  
  
They grow it in the farmlands  
And they take it to the stores  
They put it in the car trunk  
And they bring it back home  
And I say  
  
Chorus  
  
Im tired of looking out the windows of the airplane  
Im tired of traveling I want to be somewhere  
Its not even worth talking  
About those people down there  
  
Goo Goo Ga Ga Ga  
Goo Goo Ga Ga Ga
