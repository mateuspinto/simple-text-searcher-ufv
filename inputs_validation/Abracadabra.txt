I heat up I cant cool down  
You got me spinning  
Round and round  
Round and round and round it goes  
Where it stops nobody knows  
  
Every time you call my name  
I heat up like a burning flame  
Burning flame full of desire  
Kiss me baby let the fire get higher  
  
Abra abracadabra  
I wanna reach out and grab ya  
Abracadabra  
Abracadabra  
  
You make me hot you make me sigh  
You make me laugh you make me cry  
Keep me burning for your love  
With the touch of a velvet glove  
  
Abra abracadabra  
I wanna reach out and grab ya  
Abracadabra  
Abracadabra  
  
I feel the magic in your caress  
I feel magic when I touch your dress  
Silk and satin leather and lace  
Black panties with an angels face  
  
I see magic in your eyes  
I hear the magic in your sighs  
Just when I think Im gonna get away  
I hear those words that you always say  
  
Abra abracadabra  
I wanna reach out and grab ya  
Abracadabra  
Abracadabra  
  
Every time you call my name  
I heat up like a burning flame  
Burning flame full of desire  
Kiss me baby let the fire get higher  
  
I heat up I cant cool down  
My situation goes round and round  
I heat up I cant cool down  
My situation goes round and round  
I heat up I cant cool down  
My situation goes round and round
