Youve got Hiroshima going cough inside  
You cheat and lie just to survive  
Shake the money tree heed the warning signs  
Where lovers lie not parricides  
What would you give to be the master of your life  
This struggle is such a waste of time yours and mine  
I give you these eyes that I see through  
My blood my money too  
Im not afraid to run to you cause I get lonely too  
No one knows you like I do  
Youve got Hiroshima inside where lovers lie  
What would you give to be the master of your life  
Cause struggle is such a waste of time yours and mine  
I give you these eyes that I see through  
My blood my money too  
Im not afraid to run to you cause I feel lonely too  
No one knows you like I do  
What would you give to be the master of your life  
The struggle is such a waste of time yours and mine  
I give you these eyes that I see through  
My blood my money too  
Im not afraid to run to you cause I get lonely  
I give you these eyes that I see through  
My blood my money too  
Im not afraid to run to you cause I get lonely too  
I give you these eyes that I see through  
My blood my money too  
Im not afraid to run to you cause I get lonely
