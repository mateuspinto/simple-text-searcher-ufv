Ive been traveling a long time  
To be just where you are  
In dreams I have seen you  
But you are so very far  
  
How long must I travel on  
To be just where you are  
How long must I travel on  
To be just where you are  
  
I was your friend  
I was a fool  
I feel for you though were far apart  
I see your face  
Lost without trace  
I see your mind just an empty space  
  
Mindless child of motherhood  
You have lost the thing thats good  
Mindless child of motherhood  
You have lost the thing thats good  
  
I know that its not fair  
To bare a bastard son  
But why do you hide there  
When we could have shared a love  
  
How long must I travel on  
To be just where you are  
How long must I travel on  
To be just where you are  
  
I was your friend  
I was a fool  
I feel for you though were far apart  
I see your face  
Lost without trace  
I see your mind just an empty space  
  
Mindless child of motherhood  
You have lost the thing thats good  
Mindless child of motherhood  
You have lost the thing thats good  
  
To me
