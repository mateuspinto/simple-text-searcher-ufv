Verse  
Man of sorrows Lamb of God  
By His own betrayed  
The sin of man and wrath of God  
Has been on Jesus laid  
  
Silent as He stood accused  
Beaten mocked and scorned  
Bowing to the Fathers will  
He took a crown of thorns  
  
Chorus  
Oh that rugged cross  
My salvation  
Where Your love poured out over me  
Now my soul cries out  
Hallelujah  
Praise and honour unto Thee  
  
Verse  
Sent of heaven Gods own Son  
To purchase and redeem  
And reconcile the very ones  
Who nailed Him to that tree  
  
Bridge  
Now my debt is paid  
It is paid in full  
By the precious blood  
That my Jesus spilled  
  
Now the curse of sin  
Has no hold on me  
Whom the Son sets free  
Oh is free indeed  
  
Verse  
See the stone is rolled away  
Behold the empty tomb  
Hallelujah God be praised  
Hes risen from the grave
