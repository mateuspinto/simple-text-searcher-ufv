Wind is in the east  
Stare at us eyes in wonder  
Like beggars at a feast  
We cant even count the number  
What you gonna do  
Send them table scraps were leaving  
One who care are few  
Most spend there time with useless meaning  
Dear father  
Do you think that it will be alright  
Tell me mother  
Will we make it through  
We make it through the hungry night  
Somewhere in the west  
Gold teeth but sometime is gleaming  
We know we are the best  
Even know the beasts lie screaming  
Weve got power to spare  
A new clear day  
Is dawning they say  
But tell us dont you dare  
The piper has a price that we pay  
Dear preacher  
Do you think that well see the light  
Tell me teacher  
Well we make it through  
We make it through the darkest night  
Two faces in the south  
The first one has a look of  
With fine words in his mouth  
His heart is black  
As ghetto chimneys  
What you gonna do  
To hide the shame  
Contain their anger  
What you gonna say  
You walk the line of constant danger  
Dear brother  
You think well have to stand and fight  
Tell me sister Will we make it through  
We make it through the longest night  
Dear father  
Do you think its gonna be alright  
Tell me teacher  
Do you think that well see the light  
Tell me brother  
You think well have to stand and fight  
Tell me sister  
Will we make it through  
Make it through the longest night
