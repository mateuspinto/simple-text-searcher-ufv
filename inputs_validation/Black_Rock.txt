On the black rock is where I spend my time  
Writing a memory or writing a rhyme  
Thinking about what is right or wrong  
On the black rock is where I like to go  
After a long night comin home from the show  
Thats where I write my song all day long  
The black rock  
Sometimes I just look around  
Taking the feeling coming out from the ground  
Thats just something I do sometimes  
And then I just come out the door  
Taking the wind coming off of the shore  
And thats just what Im doing tonight  
On the black rock is where I spend my time  
Writing a memory or writing a rhyme  
Thinking about what is right or wrong  
On the black rock is where I like to go  
After a long night comin home from the show  
Thats where I write my song all day long  
The black rock  
When you are on your own  
Not speaking out is like fighting alone  
And that is the worst damn way to fight  
And when you are scared no more  
You reach your hand out and just open the door  
And thats just what Im doing tonight  
On the black rock is where I spend my time  
Writing a memory or writing a rhyme  
Thinking about what is right or wrong  
On the black rock is where I like to go  
After a long night comin home from the show  
Thats where I write my song all day long  
The black rock
