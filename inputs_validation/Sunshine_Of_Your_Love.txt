Its getting near dawn  
The lights close their tired eyes  
Ill soon be with you my love  
To give you my dawn surprise  
Ill be with you darling soon  
Ill be with you when the stars start falling  
  
Ive been waiting so long  
To be where Im going  
In the sunshine of your love  
  
Im with you my love  
The light shining through on you  
Yes Im with you my love  
Its the morning and just we two  
Ill stay with you darling now  
Ill stay with you till my seeds are dried up  
  
Ive been waiting so long  
To be where Im going  
In the sunshine of your love  
  
Its getting near dawn  
The lights close their tired eyes  
Ill soon be with you my love  
To give you my dawn surprise  
Ill be with you darling soon  
Ill be with you when the stars start falling  
  
Ive been waiting so long
