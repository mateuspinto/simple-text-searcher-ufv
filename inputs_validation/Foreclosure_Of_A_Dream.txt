Rise so high yet so far to fall  
A plan of dignity and balance for all  
Political breakthrough euphorias high  
More borrowed money more borrowed time  
Backed in a corner caught up in the race  
Means to an end ended in disgrace  
Perspective is lost in the spirit of the chase  
  
Foreclosure of a dream  
Those visions never seen  
Until all is lost  
Personal holocaust  
Foreclosure of a dream  
  
barren land that once filled a need  
Are worthless now dead without a deed  
Slipping away from an iron grip  
Natures scales are forced to tip  
The heartland cries loss of all pride  
To leave aint believing so try and be tried  
Insufficient funds insanity and suicide  
  
Foreclosure of a dream  
Those visions never seen  
Until all is lost  
Personal holocaust  
Foreclosure of a dream  
  
Now with new hope some will be proud  
This is no hoax no one pushed out  
Recieve a preieve and bea pioneer  
Break new ground of a new frontier  
New ideas will surely get by  
No deed or divident  
Some may ask Why  
Youll find the solution the answers in the sky  
  
Foreclosure of a dream  
Those visions never seen  
Until all is lost  
Personal holocaust  
Foreclosure of a dream  
  
Rise so high yet so far to fall  
A plan of dignity and balance for all  
Political breakthrough euphorias high  
More borrowed money more borrowed time  
  
Foreclosure of a dream  
Those visions never seen  
Until all is lost  
Personal holocaust  
Foreclosure of a dream  
  
Holocaust
