How long did you blind me baby how long  
How long did you blind me baby how long  
With your little girl laugh and your siren song  
  
Was I right about you girl or was I wrong  
Was I right about you lyin or was I wrong  
You had another man lovin you all along  
  
You said Baby I love you I wouldnt trade you in if I could  
You said Look at me baby if I wanted to leave you I would  
Yeah you had me hangin on  
Every time while you were gone  
I believed you were hurryin home to me baby  
But you were never on time  
  
How long did you lie to me baby how long  
How long did you lie to me baby how long  
With your love light shut off and your runnin light on  
  
You said Baby I love you I wouldnt trade you in if I could  
You said Look at me baby if I wanted to leave you I would  
Yeah you had me hangin on  
Every time while you were gone  
I believed you were hurryin home to me baby  
But you were never on time  
  
How long did you blind me baby how long  
How long did you blind me baby how long  
With your little girl laugh and your siren song  
With your little girl laugh and your siren song
