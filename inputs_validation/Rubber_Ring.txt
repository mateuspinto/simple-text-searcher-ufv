A sad fact widely known  
The most impassionate song  
To a lonely soul  
Is so easily outgrown  
But dont forget the songs  
That made you smile  
And the songs that made you cry  
When you lay in awe  
On the bedroom floor  
And said  Oh oh smother me Mother  
No  
Rubber ring rubber ring rubber ring rubber ring  
La  
  
The passing of time  
And all of its crimes  
Is making me sad again  
The passing of time  
And all of its sickening crimes  
Is making me sad again  
But dont forget the songs  
That made you cry  
And the songs that saved your life  
Yes youre older now  
And youre a clever swine  
But they were the only ones who ever stood by you  
  
The passing of time leaves empty lives  
Waiting to be filled the passing  
The passing of time  
Leaves empty lives  
Waiting to be filled  
Im here with the cause  
Im holding the torch  
In the corner of your room  
Can you hear me  
And when youre dancing and laughing  
And finally living  
Hear my voice in your head  
And think of me kindly  
No   
Rubber ring rubber ring rubber ring rubber ring  
La  
No  
Rubber ring rubber ring rubber ring rubber ring  
  
Do you  
Love me like you used to  
Oh  
Rubber ring rubber ring rubber ring rubber ring  
La  
  
Youre clever  
Everybodys clever nowadays  
Youre clever  
Everybodys clever nowadays  
  
You are sleeping  
You do not want to believe  
You are sleeping  
You do not want to believe  
You are sleeping  
You do not want to believe  
You are sleeping
