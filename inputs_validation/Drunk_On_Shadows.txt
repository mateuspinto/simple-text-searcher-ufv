Hiding underneath  
The veil of broken dreams  
We find her weeping  
  
On her once white wings  
She will be carrying the weight of our deeds  
And she bleeds for love  
Forever gone  
  
Drunk on shadows and lost in a lie  
Killing ourselves a kiss at a time  
Devils dance while angels smile  
Drunk on shadows and lost in life  
  
Finding souls to feed  
The night side of Eden  
We see the struggling  
For her loves  
Last breath and walk off  
  
Drunk on shadows and lost in life  
Killing ourselves a kiss at a time  
Devils dance while angels smile  
Drunk on shadows and lost in life  
  
Shes blinded by the fear  
Of life and death and everything in between  
We smile when she cries a river of tears  
A mirror where we see nothing but a reflection of heaven too far away  
  
Drunk on shadows and lost in life  
Killing ourselves a kiss at a time  
Devils dance while angels smile  
Drunk on shadows and lost in life  
So alive  
Drunk on shadows  
So alive
