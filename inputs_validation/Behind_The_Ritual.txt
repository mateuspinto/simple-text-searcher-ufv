Drinking wine in the alley drinking wine in the alley  
Making time drinking that wine  
Out of my mind in the days gone by  
  
Making time with Sally drinking that wine  
In the days gone by talking all out of my mind  
Drinking that wine talking all out of my mind  
  
Spin and turning in the alley spin and turning in the alley  
Like a Whirling Dervish in the alley drinking that wine  
Drinking wine making time in the days gone by  
  
Boogie woogie child in the alley  
Drinking that wine making time talking all out of my mind  
Drinking wine in the days gone by behind the ritual  
  
Behind the ritual behind the ritual  
In the days gone by drinking that wine  
Making time drinking that wine way back in time  
  
Spin and turn and rhyme in the alley  
Spin and turning making up rhymes talking all out of my mind  
Talking that jive drinking that wine in the days gone by  
  
Drinking wine in the alley drinking that wine  
Making time talking all out of my mind  
Drinking that wine making time in the alley  
  
Behind the ritual behind the ritual  
You find the spiritual you find the spiritual  
Behind the ritual in the days gone by  
  
Drinking wine in the alley drinking wine in the alley  
Making time talking all out of my mind  
Drinking that wine in the days gone by days gone by  
  
Spin and turn talking that jive  
Spin and turn talking that jive all out of our minds  
Drinking that sweet wine  
Making time making time in the days gone by  
  
Behind the ritual behind the ritual

Drinking that wine making time in the days gone by

Drink that wine making time  
Getting high in the days gone by drinking that wine  
  
Getting high behind the ritual  
Getting high behind the ritual  
Drinking that wine in the days gone by  
  
Behind the ritual behind the ritual  
Behind the ritual behind that spiritual  
In the days gone by drinking that wine and getting high  
  
So high behind the ritual so high behind the ritual  
So high in the days gone by  
Drinking that wine making time making time  
  
Stretching time stretching time  
Drinking that wine stretching time  
Stretching time in the days gone by behind the ritual
