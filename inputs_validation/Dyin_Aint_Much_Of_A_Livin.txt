A whiskey bottle comforts me  
And tells me not to cry  
While a full moon says a prayer for me  
I try to close my eyes  
  
But the nights there to remind me  
Of the guns and the early graves  
The ghosts appear as I fall asleep  
To sing an outlaws serenade  
  
Dyin aint much of a livin  
When youre livin on the run  
Dyin aint much of a livin for the young  
Is it too late to ask for forgiveness  
For the things that I have done  
Dyin aint much of a livin for the young  
  
The deserts been a friend to me  
It covers me by night  
And a snakebites not my enemy  
But it taught me how to fight  
  
All this fame dont bring you freedom  
Though it wears a this disguise  
When an outlaw is just a man to me  
And a man has to die  
  
Dyin aint much of a livin  
When youre livin on the run  
Dyin aint much of a livin for the young  
Is it too late to ask for forgiveness  
For the things that I have done  
Dyin aint much of a livin for the young  
  
And I hope someone will pray for me  
When its my turn to die pray for me  
  
Dyin aint much of a livin  
When youre livin on the run  
Dyin aint much of a livin for the young  
Is it too late to ask for forgiveness  
For the things that I have done  
Dyin aint much of a livin for the young
