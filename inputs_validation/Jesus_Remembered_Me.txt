I was all alone and drifting on a lonely sea of sin  
Nothing but darkness no sunshine within  
I lifted my eyes to the Lord in the sky  
And Jesus remembered me  
Jesus remembered me  
And so He set me free  
Once I was blinded but now I can see  
Glory to God He remembered me  
Now the sun is shining Im happy and free  
No more sorrow no troubles to see  
Im going home to glory my savior to see  
Glory to God He remembered me  
Jesus remembered me  
And so He set me free  
Once I was blinded but now I can see  
Glory to God He remembered me  
When He talked to his disciples at the sea of Galilee  
He said Hed remember a mortal like me  
I asked for his blessing down on my knees  
And glory to God He remembered me
