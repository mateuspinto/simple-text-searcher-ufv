Daddys little soldier boy  
Mamas little pride and joy  
Both hands on her apron strings  
Dont you touch that dirty thing  
A warning signal from above  
Inspection with a clean white glove  
They say that opposites attract  
like right and wrong  
Black on black  
  
Like pleasure and a little pain  
The sacred and profane  
Ice and fire counteract like black on black  
The oldest story known to man  
The willing sacrificial lamb  
Behind the light a shadow falls  
The code of silence shakes the walls  
A whisper to a silent scream  
The power is so frightening  
They say that opposites attract  
like right and wrong  
Black on black  
  
Like pleasure and a little pain  
The sacred and profane  
Ice and fire counteract just like black on black  
A warning signal from above  
Inspection with a clean white glove  
They say that opposites attract  
like right and wrong  
Black on black  
  
Some things seem so sacred  
Like a loaded question the power of suggestion  
Like the face of danger the kindness of a stranger  
Like a Judas Kiss like pleasure and a little pain  
Immaculate seduction absolute corruption  
Ice and fire counteract no turning back  
like black on black  
Black on black  
Black on black  
  
Like pleasure and a little pain  
The sacred and profane  
Ice and fire counteract like black on black  
Like pleasure and a little pain  
The sacred and profane  
Ice and fire counteract just like black on black  
Black  
A little pain  
Just like black on black  
Black  
Black on black  
Black on black  
Black on black
