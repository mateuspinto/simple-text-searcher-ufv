Betty was worried about the lover that she has married  
And she didnt know what to do  
Hed been hit by a hammer on the head and he lay dead  
An all her worst fears had come true  
  
Chorus  
Call the police  
Call the police  
Call the police  
Call the police  
  
Johnny was a joker and a very heavy smoker  
And he never ever broke the law  
Thin miss lizzy was akept very busy  
And sometimes very dizzy we knew what for  
  
Chorus  
  
And take em all away  
Lock em up  
  
Chorus x4  
  
Louie was a loner and a big time Al Caponeer  
Doin all his dipping from the door  
He knew a shady dealer who had done a dirty DJ  
The sooner he could even the score  
  
Chorus  
  
And lock em up  
Help ya have a birthday say  
Take em all away
