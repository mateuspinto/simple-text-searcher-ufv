All around us these days  
There are souls that cry so deeply  
To fill the emptiness we feel inside  
We look around so hard to try and find  
The kind of love we know that will survive  
But here within a heartbeat  
Is a love that so completely  
Will take away the fear we try to hide  
And even though we often wonder why  
He gives us love so strong we cant deny  
  
If the world lost all its love  
He would still have some to give you  
And if the stars should lose their light  
Wed still have His to hold back the night  
This hope is mine  
If the world lost all its love  
His still would shine  
  
Hearts in need of kindness  
Often stumble into blindness  
When the dream world and the real world pull apart  
It leaves us with a cold and empty heart  
Youd think that we would know right from the start  
  
If the world lost all its love  
He would still have some to give you  
And if the stars should lose their light  
Wed still have His to hold back the night  
This hope is mine  
If the world lost all its love  
His still would shine  
  
Lost inside the hearts we hide  
Theres hope that He will take us in  
To take away the suffering  
And let new life begin  
  
If the world lost all its love  
He would still have some to give you  
And if the stars should lose their light  
Wed still have His to hold back the night  
This hope is mine  
If the world lost all its love  
His still would shine
