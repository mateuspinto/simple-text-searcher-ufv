I wanted her all over me so I cut her up and I smeared her  
Smack dab flat on my back  
The solid ground began to crack  
I pulled her down and down and down  
I lost my breath  
I thought Id drown  
Fistfuls of you  
Fistfuls of you  
You pulled me through with white knuckles  
Fistfuls of you  
Fistfuls of you  
You pulled me through with white knuckles  
Her leg my hand a smoldering brand  
Sticking to her wet body like sand  
Her place distaste we fell from grace  
Red smears across her face  
Fistfuls of you  
Fistfuls of you  
You pulled me through with white knuckles  
Fistfuls of you  
Fistfuls of you  
You pulled me through with white knuckles  
White knuckles  
White knuckles  
White knuckles  
White knuckles
