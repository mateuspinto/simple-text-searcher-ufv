Does The Light Still Shine  
Words by Ray Boltz Music by Steve Millikan and Ray Boltz  
He used to run the mission  
This old friend of mine  
And it stood down on the corner  
Underneath a neon sign  
Had a cross that lit up heaven  
And the message Jesus Saves  
And each week at the old folks home  
His question was the same  
Chorus  
Does the light still shine  
Does the light still shine  
Is it bright enough  
For the lost to find  
Does the light still shine  
Now how was I to tell him  
They tore the old sign down  
Explain about electric codes  
And zoning in the town  
I knew that it would break his heart  
I didnt want to lie  
So I just held his hand and smiled  
When he asked me the last time  
Chorus  
In a quiet ceremony  
I began to understand  
After all the testimonies  
For this ordinary man  
He took them in he gave them food  
He taught them of Gods grace  
And as they spoke  
I saw a light  
Shining on each face  
And you may not believe it  
But I tell you thats it true  
The light kept growing brighter  
Until it filled the room  
I heard a voice say  
This my friend is what  
I was speaking of  
When you touch someone in Jesus name  
There shines the light of love  
Oh the light still shines  
Oh the light still shines  
Yes its bright enough  
For the lost to find  
Oh the light still shines  
Oh the light still shines  
Yes the light still shines  
And its bright enough  
For the lost to find  
Oh the light still shines  
Yes the light still shines
