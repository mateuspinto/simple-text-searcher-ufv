Intro Poems of Power  Ella Wheeler Wilcox  
The human wheel that force unseen  
The offspring of a deathless soul  
Can hew away to any goal  
The walls of granite intervene  
Be not in patient delay but  
Wait as one who understands  
When spirit rises and demands  
The Gods are ready to obey  
  
Verse  
Take my money like an ugly beak  
Covered in my mind but too dumb to see  
A Fibonacci burnin by your jealousy  
Im happy to pull my veins out  
And braid a rope I dont need ought  
To know that you die slow  
Im happy to pull my veins out  
And braid a rope I dont need ought  
To know that you die slow  
  
PreChorus  
You are what you believe yeah  
You are what you beat yeah  
  
Chorus  
There were men of brand new parents  
Didnt know it yet  
So we chanted work work work  
But they didnt know they were dead  
Didnt know they were dead  
  
Verse 2  
Then the winter flew to a sick young coward  
Look into then like went on hating  
ReJubilating a gently apple to own by God  
  
Chorus  
There were men of brand new parents  
Didnt know it yet  
So we chanted work work work  
But they didnt know they were dead  
Didnt know they were dead
