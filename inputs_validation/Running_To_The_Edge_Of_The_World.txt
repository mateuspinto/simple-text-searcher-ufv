Remember when I took you  
Up to the top of the hill  
We had our knives drawn  
They were as sharp  
As we were in love  
If god crossed us  
Wed take all his drugs  
Burn his money  
And his house down  
And wait for the fire to spread  
  
Sometimes hate is not enough  
To turn this all to ashes  
Together as one  
Against all others  
Break all of our wings to  
Make sure it crashes  
  
Chorus  
Were running to the  
Edge of the world  
Running running away  
Were running to the edge of the world  
I dont know if the world will end today  
  
I had no choice  
I erased the debt of our family  
Let you say goodbye  
With lips like dynamite  
And everyone  
Turned their backs  
Because they knew  
When we held on tight  
To each other  
We were something fatal  
That fell into the wrong hands  
  
Sometimes hate is not enough  
To turn this all to ashes  
Together as one  
Against all others  
Break all of our wings to  
Make sure it crashes  
  
Were running to the  
Edge of the world  
Running running away  
Were running to the edge of the world  
I dont know if the world will end today  
  
We dont see death we see destruction Repeat x2  
  
Chorus  
  
See a new beginning rise behind the sun  
We cant never catch up to them as fast as we run
