One little Christmas tree was standing alone  
Waiting for someone to come by  
One little Christmas tree that never had grown  
Cried as he looked up to the sky  
Oh please Mr Father Tree the tallest of all  
Im so afraid and so alone  
Could one little Christmas tree  
So tiny and small light up someones home  
  
Cause one little Christmas tree can light up a home  
So one little child can find a toy  
One little Christmas tree can light up a home  
So one little heart can find some joy  
  
One little angel who was riding a star  
Cried as she looked down at the tree  
Oh please Mr Father Tree wherever you are  
May I give him the star you gave to me  
Then in the heavens came a voice from afar  
A voice that was heard throughout the world  
Go down little angel girl and give him your star  
Tonight hell light the world  
  
Cause one little Christmas tree  
Can light up the world  
So those who are lost may find their way  
One little Christmas tree can light up the world  
So all men may see on Christmas day
