Every day I give you a reason to cry  
I see the hurt in your eyes  
But stronger yet  
I see the love that shines  
  
Help me learn to take on the nature of you  
And love more than I accuse  
And pardon others like you taught me to  
  
Cause something happens inside my heart  
Lord when I obey  
Something happens inside my heart  
Every time I pray  
  
Forgive me  
As I learn how to forgive  
The ones who broke my heart  
The way Ive broken yours  
  
Forgive me  
As I learn how to forgive  
And reach out through the pain  
And touch with hands of grace  
  
As you prayed for those who crucified you  
Forgive they dont know what they do  
Compassion reched out to a world confused  
  
Help me learn to bless those who persecute me  
And pray for my enemies  
And show them mercy like youve shown to me  
  
Cause something happens inside my heart  
Lord when I obey  
Something happens inside my heart  
Every time I pray  
  
Forgive me  
As I learn how to forgive  
The ones who broke my heart  
The way Ive broken yours  
  
Forgive me  
As I learn how to forgive  
And reach out through the pain  
And touch with hands of grace  
  
Forgive me  
As I learn how to forgive  
The ones who broke my heart  
The way Ive broken yours  
Forgive me  
  
As I learn how to forgive  
And reach out through the pain  
And touch with hands of grace  
Forgive me
