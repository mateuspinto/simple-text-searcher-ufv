Well my poor broke mama told me  
When I was twelve years old  
Said you eatin talkin nare too fast  
Theres one thing you should know  
Should take your time my sweet baby  
Take your time my blue eyed son  
Well you might never have his money  
But you wont miss no rich mans fun  
  
Yeah I could never give you money honey  
I could never buy you clothes  
But the way them women look at you  
Some day you should have both  
If you take your time my sweet baby  
Take your time and love em slow  
And if you play your cards right now  
You wont never wait no more  
  
Yeah well the ladies like the diamonds  
They like their brand new clothes  
But I was blessed with plenty of  
The thing they love the most  
I take my time with the ladies  
I take my time and I love them slow  
And since I turned thirteen Lord  
I aint never wait no more  
  
Yeah I could never give you money honey  
I could never buy you clothes  
But the way these schoolgirls look at you  
Someday you gonna have both  
Take your time my sweet baby  
Take your time my blue eyed son  
Well you might never have his money  
But you wont miss no rich mans fun  
  
Yeah ladies like the diamonds  
I tell ya I like their brand new clothes  
But I was blessed with plenty of  
The thing they love most  
I take my time with the ladies  
I take my time I love them slow  
And since I turned thirteen Lord  
I aint never wait no more
