Intro  
Once upon a time in our life  
We held the key to every door  
And I that I desired  
Was you forever more  
I found love in a heart  
Once broken far beyond repair  
And you restored a sole  
That had forgotten how to care  
Everything we needed  
Was at our beckon call  
With you and I together  
We could conquer all  
When I needed badly  
To be cheered up for a while  
You were there  
And all you had to do was simply smile  
And holding things together  
Was so easy for us to do  
For you could turn to me for help  
And I could turn to you  
And jealousy was something  
That never entered our hearts  
For we were made for one another  
No matter where we are  
When things were at there darkest  
I could hold you next to me  
And I knew all would be okay  
For you were strong and I was weak  
So given every chance for me  
To start my life anew  
Thered be no question  
Id do it all again with you
