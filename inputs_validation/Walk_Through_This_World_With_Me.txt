Walk through this world with me go where I go  
Share all my dreams with me I need you so  
In life we search and some of us find Ive looked for you a long long time  
And now that I found you new horizons I see  
Come take my hand and walk through this world with me  
 guitar   
Walk through this world with me go where I go  
Share all my dreams with me Ive searched for you so  
Now that I found you new horizons I see  
So come take my hand and walk through this world with me  
Come take my hand and walk through this world with me
