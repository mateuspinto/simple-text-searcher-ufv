Live clean  
Let your works be seen  
Stand firm  
Or you gonna feed worm  
Chorus  
One baldhead tell me say  
This here baldhead tell me say  
Put one me clothes and come with him  
And mek we go to church Sunday  
Soul seekers I say  
Jacket and tie come tell me say  
Clean clothes come tell me say  
If me come with him  
And go to church this Sunday  
Soul seekers I say  
Chorus  
This here one come tell I say  
Another one come tell I say  
If you want to be saved son  
Got to go in a grave son  
Pack of bullshit  
That is bullshit I say  
The other one come tell I say  
If you want to be in the light son  
Youve got to love Jesus Christ son  
That is fantasy  
Whole pack of ignorance I say  
Chorus  
Then the parson tell I say  
If I want to be pure within  
Ive got to come confess my sins  
Another pirate I say  
Chorus  
This here one come tell I say  
Do you think it is wised  
That I should get baptized  
But when I realized  
It was the devil in disguise  
This here one come tell I say  
Another one come tell I say  
To be in the light  
Got to take Jesus Christ  
Youre talkin like gladness  
But that is madness I say  
Chorus
