Verse  
Countin down its new years eve  
You come on over then start askin me  
Hey girl you wanna dance   
I try to say no but it came out yes and  
Here it goes middle of the dance floor  
Were both pretty nervous I can tell by look in his eyes  
Then came the count down  
  
Chorus  
5 4 3 2 1  
New years  
Everybody shouts and here it goes  
I wanna see it flow  
We look at the screen  
The camera was focused on us  
You blushed and turned away  
I kissed you on the cheek and ran away  
5 4 3 2 1  
  
Verse 2  
My birthday everybodys here  
All except for one  
At the sleepover you showed right then  
All the girls scream except for me  
You have roses in your hand  
Gave em to me and whispered  
Payin you back  
Then all the girls  
Started to get that feeling  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 3  
Then they shouted  
5 4 3 2 1  
Here it goes  
Then he kissed me on the cheek and said  
Just remember this day Later on in your life  
Youll recall this day and wonder why  
I didnt count down  
5 4 3 2 1  
Then I got that feeling when you left  
It was the count down  
I got that feeling  
It was a 5 4 3 2 1  
Once again
