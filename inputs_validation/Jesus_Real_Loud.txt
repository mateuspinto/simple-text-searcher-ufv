Jesus Real Loud  
Words and music by Ray Boltz  
The doors opened up  
And I got on the elevator  
I saw the other people  
Who were standing around  
Everyone was silent  
No one made a sound  
And I thought  
What if I said Jesus real loud  
Hey  
Chorus  
What if I said Jesus real loud  
What if I just lifted up my voice  
And did it now  
Would you think I was a prophet  
Would you still want me around  
What if I said Jesus real loud  
What if I said Jesus real loud  
What if I just lifted up my voice  
Above the crowd  
Would you think I was a prophet  
Would you think I was a clown  
What if I said Jesus real loud  
The doors opened up  
And I went in the dentists office  
They handed me a magazine  
They told me to sit down  
Everyone was waiting  
No one made a sound  
And I thought  
What if I said Jesus real loud  
Hey  
Chorus  
Its ok sometimes to whisper  
But hey listen to me mister  
The way we act can anybody tell  
Lift your voice a little higher  
Smell the smoke and feel the fire  
Aint it time somebody  
Started to yell  
Chorus  
What if I said Jesus real loud  
What if I said Jesus real loud
