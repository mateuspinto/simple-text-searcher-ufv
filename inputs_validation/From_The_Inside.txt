I dont know who to trust your surprise  
Everyone feels so far away from me  
Happy thoughts sift through dust and the lies  
Trying not to break but Im so tired of this deceit  
  
Every time I try to make myself get back up on my feet  
All I ever think about is this  
All the tiring time between  
And how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me  
  
Take everything from the inside and throw it all away  
cause I swear for the last time I wont trust myself with you  
  
Tension is building inside steadily  
Everyone feels so far away from me  
Happy thoughts forcing their way out of me  
Trying not to break but Im so tired of this deceit  
Every time I try to make myself get back up on my feet  
All I ever think about is this  
All the tiring time between  
And how trying to put my trust in you just takes so much out of me  
  
Take everything from the inside and throw it all away  
Cause I swear for the last time I wont trust myself with you  
  
I wont waste myself on you  
You  
You  
Waste myself on you  
You  
You  
  
Ill take everything from the inside and throw it all away  
Cause I swear for the last time I wont trust myself with you  
  
Everything from the inside and just throw it all away  
Cause I swear for the last time I wont trust myself with you  
You  
You
