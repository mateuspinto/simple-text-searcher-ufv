When I was a young man I was let astray  
I met with a body down in Logy Bay  
We went out in a weather  
We wore out our shoes  
And up Kingsway road for a drink or two  
  
Chorus  
  
Drink er up boys its well after ten  
Drink er up boys its well after ten Repeat  
  
Some people say that the pinky is fine  
Others will swear by a drop of moonshine  
But as for myself Im a bottle of each  
Mixed in with a gallon of dipper or screech  
  
Chorus  
  
Its the old shavin lotion thats made me this way  
Sweeter than Pepsi and stronger than tea  
And when in the evening when were feeling fine  
Well stop into Jakeys for icon and shine  
  
Chorus  
  
Its the old shavin lotion thats made me this way  
Sweeter than Pepsi and stronger than tea  
And when in the morning when Im feeling rough  
I curse ol Jakey who sold me this stuff  
  
ChorusRepeat x2
