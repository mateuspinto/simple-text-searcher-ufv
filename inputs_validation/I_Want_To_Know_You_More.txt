In the secret in the quiet place  
In the stillness you are there  
In the secret in the quiet hour  
I wait only for you  
Cause I want to know you more  
  
I want to know you  
I want to hear your voice  
I want to know you more  
  
I want to touch you  
I want to see your face  
I want to know you more  
  
I am reaching for the highest goal  
That I might receive the prize  
Pressing onward pushing every hindrance aside  
Out of my way  
Cause I want to know you more  
  
I want to know you  
I want to hear your voice  
I want to know you more  
I want to touch you  
I want to see your face  
I want to know you more  
  
I want to know you  
I want to hear your voice  
I want to know you more  
I want to touch you  
I want to see your face  
I want to know you more  
  
I want to know you  
I want to hear your voice  
I want to know you more  
I want to touch you  
I want to see your face  
I want to know you more  
  
I want to know you  
I want to hear your voice  
I want to know you more  
I want to touch you  
I want to see your face  
I want to know you more
