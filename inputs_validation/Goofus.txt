I was born on a farm out in Ioway  
A flaming youth who was bound that hed fly away  
I packed my grip and I grabbed my saxophone  
Cant read notes but I play anything by ear  
I made up tunes on the sounds that I used to hear  
When Id start to play folks used to say  
Sounds a little Goofus to me  
  
Cornfed chords appeal to me I like rustic harmony  
Hold that note and change the key thats called Goofus  
Not according to the rules that you learn at music schools  
But the folks just dance like fools they go Goofus  
  
Got a job but I just couldnt keep it long  
The leader said that I played all the music wrong  
So I stepped out with an outfit of my own  
Got together a new kind of orchestree  
And we all played just the same Goofus harmony  
And I must admit we made a hit
