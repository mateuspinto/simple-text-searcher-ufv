Intro  
Tale as old as time  
True as it can be  
Barely even friends  
Then somebody bends  
Unexpectedly  
  
Verse 1  
Just a little change  
Small to say the least  
Both a little scared  
Neither one prepared  
Beauty and the beast  
  
PreChorus  
Ever just the same  
Ever a surprise  
Ever as before  
Ever just as sure  
As the sun will rise  
  
Chorus  
Tale as old as time  
Tune as old as song  
  
Verse 2  
Bitter sweet and strange  
Finding you can change  
Learning you were wrong  
  
Bridge  
Certain as the sun  
Rising in the east  
  
Chorus  
Tale as old as time  
Song as old as rhyme  
Beauty and the beast x2  
  
Outro  
Off to the cupboard with you Chip its past your bed time  
Goodnight love
