June was the lobster shell  
I dug by hand a haven that hid me well  
Beneath the sand  
The white windy waves washed in  
But I stayed dry  
The great breakers broke again  
Cause Im on and off inside  
And then when the empress run aground  
And my eyes turned blue and green  
I heard a gorgeous sound  
And thats when it became a dream  
When the sky fell in  
When the hurricanes came for me  
I could finally crash again  
And thats how I became the sea  
I wrenched the engines off  
And dragged them down  
The depths turned the iron soft  
As they swiftly drowned  
And I brought the ocean side  
To its rusty knees  
  
As I felt the even tide  
Deep in my shallow dreams  
And then when the empress run aground  
And my eyes turned blue and green  
I heard a gorgeous sound  
And thats when it became a dream  
When the sky fell in  
When the hurricanes came for me  
I could finally crash again  
And thats how I became the sea  
When the sky fell in  
When the sky fell in  
When the sky fell in  
When the hurricanes came for me  
I could finally crash again  
And thats how I became the sea  
Thats how I became the sea  
Thats how I became the sea
