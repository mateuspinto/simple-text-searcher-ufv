Come on baby take a ride with me  
Im up from Indiana down to Tennessee  
Everything is as cool as can be  
In a peaceful world  
  
People know this world is a wreck  
Were sick and tired of being politically correct  
If I see through it now but I didnt at first  
The hypocrites made it worse and worse  
Lookin down their noses at what people say  
These are just words and words are okay  
Its what you do and not what you say  
If youre not part of the future then get out of the way  
  
Come on baby take a ride with me  
Im up from Indiana down to Tennessee  
Everything is cool as can be  
In a peaceful world  
  
Racism lives in the US today  
Better get hip to what Martin Luther King had to say  
I dont want my kids being brought up this way  
Hatred to each other is not okay  
Well Im not a preacher just a singer son  
But I can see more work to be done  
Its what you do and not what you say  
If youre not part of the future then get out of the way  
  
Come on baby take a ride with me  
Im up from Indiana down to Tennessee  
Everything is cool as can be  
In a peaceful world  
  
The moneys good and the work is okay  
Looks like everything is rollin our way  
Til you gotta look the devil in the eye  
You know that bastards one big lie  
So be careful with your heart and what you love  
Make sure that it was sent from above  
Its what you do and not what you say  
If youre not part of the future then get out of the way  
  
Come on baby take a ride with me  
Im up from Indiana down to Tennessee  
Everything is cool as can be  
In a peaceful world  
  
Lay back the top and ride with me  
Im up from Indiana down to Tennessee  
Everything is cool as can be  
In a peaceful world  
  
Hey yeah  
Hey yeah  
Hey yeah  
Hey yeah
