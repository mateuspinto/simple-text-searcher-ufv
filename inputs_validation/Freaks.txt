Have you ever met a lady screaming angst potential  
Have you ever dreamed of romance no matter how experimental  
Have you ever felt an alien drifting back into your hometown  
Did you think you were buying safety  
When you bought that piece of ground  
  
She said all the best freaks are here  
She said all the best freaks are here please stop staring at me  
So I said all the best freaks are here  
All the best freaks are here please stop staring at me  
  
Have you ever woke up sweating in the middle of the night  
You search the darkness and youre scrambling for the light  
Have you ever walked down the street heard bootsteps following you  
Dont worry my son youve got the spook squad looking after you  
  
He said all the best freaks are here  
He said all the best freaks are here please stop staring at me  
So I said all the best freaks are here  
All the best freaks are here please stop staring at me stop staring at me  
  
Airport terminal patiently waiting on the last call  
You feel the eyes burn the back of your head  
Sign the autograph get out of the picture gonna have the last laugh  
Feel the whispers as you head for the plane  
Stop staring at me  
  
Love and linen sheets seem so very far away  
You save your pennies and you buy another day  
But after all its only hide and seek just another game  
Theres so much fun to be had when youre living with a name  
  
All the best freaks are here all the best freaks are here  
Please stop staring at me all the best freaks are here  
All the best freaks are here please stop staring at me  
Oh stop staring at me oh stop staring at me  
  
They said all the best freaks are here  
All the best freaks are here please stop staring at me  
All the best freaks are here  
All the best freaks are here please stop staring at me
