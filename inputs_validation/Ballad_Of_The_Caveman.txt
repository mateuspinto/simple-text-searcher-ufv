Ill tell you bout a caveman lived a million years ago  
When mother earth was young and dinosaurs walked to and fro  
His skull contained but half a brain but he didnt mind at all  
Hes a hot shot caveman yah do dah   
Who loved to fight and brawl  
  
He walked the misty plate in time to find whatever he could find  
Then at last he saw her there covered with hair  
A cavegirl looking right his way half naked half well who can say  
Such a thing hed never seen before Well then need I tell you more  
The caveman fell in love love love  
And so he wielded his club  
  
Oooh oooh what could he do  
You cant blame a fellow for trying his luck  
Hes just a simple caveman who wanted to  
Well when the cavegirl came around she had some things to relate  
About the methods he used to communicate  
And she said  
  
Female spoken  
I never expected a caveman to exhibit much finesse  
But a fifty pound club aint exactly a caress  
So if you want to call me you better learn to talk  
Until you learn some manners buddy  
Take a walk
