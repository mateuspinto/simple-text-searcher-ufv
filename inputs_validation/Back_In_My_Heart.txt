A grey ghost night  
On an eastern flight  
Sixteen thousand miles away  
I lay awake  
When the morning breaks  
But what can I do to get you  
Back in my heart again  
  
The towns top gun  
Safe at number one  
No mans will can change my life  
Safe and certain  
But now Im hurtin  
So what can I do to get you  
  
Chorus  
  
Back in my heart again  
Blowin through my life  
Life a cold winters wind  
Now in my mind I know I didnt win  
I want you back in my heart again  
  
Baby baby  
What can I say  
I was wrong so I ran away  
A million miles  
Wont make me smile  
I want you want you want you
