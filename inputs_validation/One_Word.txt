Wake up love wake up babe  
I wanna tell you let me say  
Dreaming never looked so true  
One word aint enough  
Heavens finding eyes in you  
How can I say love  
Many smilers lie to each other oh  
Children hide with pretty words oh  
So many times we seem to find  
Children play too rough  
Never too late for what we are made for  
How can I say love  
All this feeling here inside  
One word aint enough  
The way to say it seems to hide  
How can I say love  
How do we wind up  
Why do we wind up so alone  
How many roads do we gotta travel on  
Till we find out were already home  
Already home  
All this feeling here inside  
One word aint enough  
The way to say it seems to hide  
How can I say love
