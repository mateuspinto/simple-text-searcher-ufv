I love to pick you up  
Cause youre still a baby to me  
Cribs and cradles and bottles and toys  
Are part of the joys they bring  
I wanna wash your face  
And change your clothes and button your shoes  
Walk you around and wrestle with you  
Then Im gonna make you sing  
In the mornin I could wake you up  
Feed you breakfast from a little cup  
I want to pick you up  
Rock you back and forth and make you smile  
I want to hold you close for a while  
I wanna tickle your feet  
Drop you in your little tub  
Wash your body and shampoo your hair  
Be careful not to sting your eyes  
When its night Ill put you in your bed  
And Ill bend and kiss ya on your head  
I want to pick you up  
Rock you back and forth and make you smile  
I want to hold you close for a while  
Pat pat pat pat pat her on her butt butt  
Shes going to sleep be quiet  
Pat pat pat pat pat her on her butt  
Shes going to sleep  
Little baby go to sleep
