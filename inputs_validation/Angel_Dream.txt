I dreamed you  
I saw your face  
Cut my lifeline when drifting through space  
  
I saw an angel  
I saw my fate  
I can only thank God it was not too late  
  
Over mountains  
I floated away  
Cross an ocean  
I dreamed her name  
  
I followed an angel down through the gates  
I can only thank God it was not too late  
  
Sing a little song of loneliness  
Sing one to make me smile  
Another round for everyone  
Im here for a little while  
  
Now Im walkin  
This street on my own  
But shes with me  
Everywhere I go  
  
Yeah I found an angel  
I found my place  
I can only thank God it was not too late  
I can only thank God it was not too late  
I can only thank God it was not too late
