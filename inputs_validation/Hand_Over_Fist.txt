Hand over fist  
Paper around the stone  
Scissors cut the paper  
Cut the paper to the bone  
Hand over fist  
Paper around the stone  
Scissors cut the paper  
And the rock must stand alone  
  
I could disappear into the crowd  
But not if I keep my head in the clouds  
I could walk away so proud  
Its easy enough if you dont laugh too loud  
  
I thought I was okay alone  
Wait for the postman and the telephone  
Lost in a world of my own  
I thought I could run alone  
Thought I could run through the night alone  
  
Hand over hand  
Doesnt seem so much  
Hand over hand  
Is the strength of the common touch  
  
You talk as we walk along  
You never imagined I could be so wrong  
Humming your favorite song  
You know Ive hated that song for so long  
  
How can we ever agree  
Like the rest of the world  
We grow farther apart  
I swear you dont listen to me  
Holding my hand to my heart  
Holding my fist to my racing heart  
  
Take a walk outside myself  
In some exotic land  
Greet a passing stranger  
Feel the strength in his hand  
Feel the world expand  
  
I feel my spirit resist  
But I open up my fist  
Lay hand over hand over  
Hand over fist
