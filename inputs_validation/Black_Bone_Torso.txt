Black bone torso  
black bone torso  
  
Cyanide a suicide  
No thoughts of pain  
Genocide a crucified martyrs laid  
Down to the dust there to fade away  
  
All geeks and circus freaks  
Come play with me  
Pimps to bring my sex fiends  
Molesting me  
Round to the lust my debauchery  
  
Destined here to reign supreme  
Your bloodied king  
Dying for the world  
Oh death where is thy sting  
My black bone torsos  
Bleeding me
