Billy Yes I will go back to school  
And achieve victory  
No man will take what my father has built  
Unless that man is me  
  
Veronica My Billy sweet Billy boy  
I knew you would go back  
No one can stop you if you try  
Dont I have a nice rack  
  
Billy Veronica I thank you  
For beating the shit out of me  
I see things so clearly now  
I choose my destiny  
  
veronica Oh Billy I knew you had it in ya  
  
Kids Were here to help you Billy  
Get back in school to stay  
You gotta work real hard  
And stick it out  
Till graduation day  
  
Clown Hey Kids Its me  
I bet you thought that I was dead  
But when I fell over I just broke my leg  
And got a hemorrhage in my head ha ha ha  
  
All There are obstacles in the way  
Maid In the way  
All again But together we shall overcome  
Maid Overcome  
But you cant break a spirit  
And you cant heal a dream  
Maid Dream  
Do you have anymore gum  
More gum more gum more gum  
Billy Do you have anymore gum
