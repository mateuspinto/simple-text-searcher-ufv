We are your church  
We are your sons and daughters  
Weve gathered here to meet with you  
  
We lift our eyes  
We lay our hearts before you  
Expectant here for you to move  
  
With our hands to the heaven alive  
In your presence oh God  
When you come  
So pour out your spirit  
We love to be near you oh God  
When you come  
  
You are the way  
The truth and the life we live for  
Oh how we long to know you more  
  
Come like a rushing wind  
Come light the fire again  
Come like a burning flame  
Have your way  
Have your way
