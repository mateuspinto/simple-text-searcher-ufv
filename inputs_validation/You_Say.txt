Here in the light  
It burns you up inside  
Here in the shell of a sun  
We echo on  
  
Too much listening  
Not enough living  
  
Chorus  
And you say  
What did I say  
What did you say  
We just  
Go away  
Go away  
Go away  
  
It helps you out  
Knowing Im left out  
Locked in a box with a light  
That wont shine  
  
Turn it on and wait for  
Someone to come  
  
Chorus  
  
Im here now  
Waiting  
Holding on to reasons  
Wasted  
I faced it  
Watching you deny me  
  
Here in the light  
It burns you out sometimes  
Here in the shell of a sun  
We echo on  
  
Left alone forever  
All alone together  
  
Chorus
