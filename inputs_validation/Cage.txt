Walking down the street do you stare at your feet and never do you let your
eyes meet the freaks The deadbeat addicts  
social fanatics theyre a dime a dozen and they carry guns  
  
Chorus  
Halloween every other day of the week  
Living in a cage in the USA  
Living in a cage in the USA  
Holy smoke somebody blew up the pope  
Living in a cage in the USA  
All around us the rules are changing  
Taller walls and stronger cages  
Nothing is sacred or too outrageous  
Taller walls and stronger cages  
  
What in the world is happening to the world  
What in the world  
Driving in your Mercedes you think youre safe but youre never safe in a
world of hate with criminal minds with guns and  
knives who say gimme your ride or give your life  
  
Chorus  
  
What in the world is happening to the world  
What in the world
