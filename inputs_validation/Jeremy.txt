Sitting by an open door  
With rain dropping in my face  
Then lightning strikes  
Across the room  
I fall in your embrace  
It was a lovely rendezvous  
Better than anyone ever know  
A gentle face a fiery heart  
With nothing to conceal  
Thats what it takes to hold me down  
A man with grand appeal  
Oh while I draw you to my soul  
I feel the fire of love taking control  
Jeremy  
When I think of you  
The good times that we have  
The melody  
Sings out to me  
My heart at your command  
Jeremy  
Oh baby oh baby oh baby  
Oohh  
Youre the only one who can  
Silent nights are lonely nights  
Wherever were apart  
And every moment youre away  
I hide you in my heart  
Oh while I draw you to my soul  
I feel the fire of love taking control  
Jeremy  
When I think of you  
The good times that we have  
The melody  
Sings out to me  
My heart at your command  
Jeremy  
Oh baby oh baby oh baby  
Oooh  
Youre the only one who can  
Jeremy you see  
That we are two of a kind  
We could stay together baby  
For all time  
We can live without each other  
But it wouldnt be the same  
cause I am you and you are me  
Its never gonna change  
Jeremy  
When I think of you  
The good times that we have  
The melody  
Sings out to me  
My heart at your command  
Jeremy  
Oh baby oh baby oh baby  
Oooh  
Jeremy  
Jeremy oh baby oh baby
