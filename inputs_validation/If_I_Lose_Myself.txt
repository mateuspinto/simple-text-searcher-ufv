I stared up at the sun  
Thought of all other people places and things Ive loved  
I stared up just to see  
Of all other faces you are the one next to me  
You can feel the light start to tremble  
Washing what you know out the sea yeah  
You can see your life out of the window tonight  
  
If I lose myself tonight  
Itll be by your side  
If I lose myself tonight whoa whoa whoa  
  
If I lose myself tonight  
Itll be you and I  
Lose myself tonight  
  
I woke up with the sun  
Thought of all other people places and things Ive loved  
I woke up just to see  
Of all other faces you were the one next to me  
You can feel the light start to tremble  
Washing what you know out the sea yeah  
You can see your life out of the window tonight  
  
If I lose myself tonight  
Itll be by your side  
If I lose myself tonight whoa whoa whoa  
  
If I lose myself tonight  
Itll be you and I  
Lose myself tonight whoa  
Whoo  
Oh ooh  
  
Take us down and we keep trying  
40000 feet keep flying  
Take us down and we keep trying  
40000 feet keep flying  
Take us down and we keep trying  
40000 feet keep flying  
Take us down and we keep trying  
40000 feet keep flying  
  
Lose myself  
If I lose myself tonight  
Hoo hoo ooh  
Hoo hoo ooh
