Before this hits the ground  
Before this fades away  
I wanna let it out  
And I dont wanna wait  
So dont you let me down  
And dont you hesitate  
Before I turn around  
Before I walk away  
I want you to make me  
Make me  
Make me  
  
Make me believe again  
In some kind of faith  
Help me to see again  
Before its too late  
Cause forever is never  
That far away  
Make me believe again  
Make me believe again  
I cant pretend  
Make me believe again  
  
Make me believe again  
In some kind of faith  
Help me to see again  
Before its too late  
Cause forever is never  
That far away  
Make me believe again  
Make me believe again  
I cant pretend  
Make me believe again  
  
If you could take the dirt  
And wash it all away  
If you could say the words  
That make me want to stay  
Just tell me theres a chance  
To Hell with all the blame  
If you could take my hand  
If you could lead the way  
I want you to make me  
Make me  
Make me  
  
Make me believe again  
In some kind of faith  
Help me to see again  
Before its too late  
Cause forever is never  
That far away  
Make me believe again  
Make me believe again  
I cant pretend  
Make me believe again  
  
Make me believe again  
In some kind of faith  
Help me to see again  
Before its too late  
Cause forever is never  
That far away  
Make me believe again  
Make me believe again  
I cant pretend  
Make me believe again
