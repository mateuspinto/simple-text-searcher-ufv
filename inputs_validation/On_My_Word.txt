On my word  
There will never be anyone but you child  
On my word  
No one else will ever do but you  
On my word  
I will never stay from your side  
And someday youre gonna be my bride  
On my word  
They say Im the cheatin guy  
They say looking girl youll find someone new  
So someone new keeps in my heart  
But dont believe them cause I know  
That deep inside they love you too honey  
Repeat the 1st verse  
  
Umm they say that I am no good  
They say that I never would stand by you  
So someday when youre givin me  
But dont believe them cause I know  
That deep inside they love you too honey  
Repeat the 1st verse again
