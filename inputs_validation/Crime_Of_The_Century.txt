Now theyre planning the crime of the century  
Well what will it be  
Read all about their schemes and adventuring  
Its well worth a fee  
So roll up and see  
And they rape the universe  
How theyve gone from bad to worse  
Who are these men of lust greed and glory  
Rip off the masks and let see  
But thats not right  oh no whats the story  
Theres you and theres me  
Thank you for that
