Aint no reason why I should feel this way  
I got everything going for now  
Might have it all some people say  
But each time I think of your smiling face  
For I took upon inside now  
In your sweet love I can take  
Cause I lost the best thing  
I miss you more everyday  
And I know deep inside me  
No one can take your place oh no  
Sometimes when I am lonely  
And I can feel your presence near  
Well I look at your picture  
And your sweet voice I can often hear  
But every time I really see you  
Oh my heart often smiles  
And at that precise moment  
I break up all inside  
Cause I lost the best thing  
I miss you more everyday  
And I know deep inside me  
No one can take your place oh no  
Oh all alone Ive lost you  
Twas nothing you could do  
I lost my only creation  
And now Im paying all the due  
But every time I really see you  
Oh my heart often smiles  
And at that precise moment  
I break up all inside  
Cause I lost the best thing  
I miss you more everyday  
And I know deep inside me  
No one can take your place oh no
