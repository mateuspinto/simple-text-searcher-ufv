She sits in silence in her midnight world  
Her faded pictures of her dancing girls  
Her distant dreamer on the seas of time  
Her happy memories dancing through her mind  
  
In days of romance  
She was the queen of dance  
Shed dance the night away  
  
And as the seasons turn the days to years  
She holds her pictures hears the silent cheers  
The days grow lonely for the dancing queen  
And now she dances only in her dreams  
  
In days of romance  
She was the queen of dance  
Shed dance the night away away away away
