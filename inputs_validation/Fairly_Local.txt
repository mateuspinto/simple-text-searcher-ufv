Im fairly local Ive been around  
Ive seen the streets youre walking down  
Im fairly local good people now  
  
Im evil to the core  
What I shouldnt do I will  
They say Im emotional  
What I want to save Ill kill  
Is that who I truly am  
I truly dont have a chance  
Tomorrow Ill keep a beat  
And repeat yesterdays dance  
  
Yo this song will never be on the radio  
Even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote  
Its the few the proud and the emotional  
Yo you bulletproof in black like a funeral  
The world around us is burning but were so cold  
Its the few the proud and the emotional  
  
Im fairly local Ive been around  
Ive seen the streets youre walking down  
Im fairly local good people now  
  
Im not evil to the core  
What I shouldnt do I will fight  
I know Im emotional  
What I want to save I will try  
I know who I truly am  
I truly do have a chance  
Tomorrow Ill switch the beat  
To avoid yesterdays dance  
  
Yo this song will never be on the radio  
Even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote  
Its the few the proud and the emotional  
Yo you bulletproof in black like a funeral  
The world around us is burning but were so cold  
Its the few the proud and the emotional  
  
Im fairly local Ive been around  
Ive seen the streets youre walking down  
Im fairly local good people now
