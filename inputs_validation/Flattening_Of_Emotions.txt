Where is the person that could have been  
Who what took over when did the end begin  
Should we not prepare for the uncertain  
Mysteries of our life of our destiny  
See things that are not there  
Intruding voices  
What went wrong to their picture perfect life  
They once knew  Flattening of emotions  
  
Solos Schuldiner Masvidal  
  
A mind shared by an uninvited stranger  
Which comes and goes as choose to appear  
Should we not prepare for the uncertain  
Mysteries of our life of our destiny  
See things that are not there  
Intruding voices  
What went wrong to their picture perfect life  
They once knew  Flattening of emotions
