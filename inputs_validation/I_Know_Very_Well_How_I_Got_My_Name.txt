A child in a curious phase  
A man with sullen ways  
Oh I know very well how I got my name  
  
You think you were my first love  
You think you were my first love but youre wrong  
You were the only one  
Whos come and gone  
  
When thirteen years old  
Who dyed his hair gold   
Oh I know very well I dont need to be told  
  
You think you were my first love  
You think you were my first love but youre wrong  
You were the only one  
Whos come and gone  
  
You were the only one  
Whos come and gone
