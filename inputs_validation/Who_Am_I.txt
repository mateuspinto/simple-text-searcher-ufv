WHO AM I  
Who am I to understand  
The ways of love a grain of sand  
To fall between these fingers  
That I hold  
Who am I that you should trust  
A wind that turns a stone to dust  
A mountain to surrender all its gold  
And who am I to say you should believe in me  
And who am I to say I love you  
One reason why love cannot die  
Tell me who am I  
DOUBLE VOICE  
Who am I I never knew  
My heart was roaming from or to  
I dont know where we are going to  
The different arms between my day and night  
All I want is just to be with you  
Who am I a distant sun  
A thought before the moments gone  
Just a thought before the moments gone  
And I will never let you from my side  
You will always be the only one  
And all I have to say you can believe in me  
For who am I to say I love you  
One reason why love cannot die  
You are on my heart remembers  
Tell me who am I  
And who am I to say I love you  
One reason why love can not die  
Tell me who am I  
For who am I to say I love you  
One reason why love cannot die  
You are on my heart remembers  
Tell me who  
Tell me who am I
