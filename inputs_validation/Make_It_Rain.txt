Verse 1  
When the sins of my father  
Weigh down in my soul  
And the pain of my mother  
Will not let me go  
Well I know there can come fire from the sky  
To refine the purest of kings  
And even though I know this fire brings me pain  
Even so and just the same  
  
Chorus x2  
Make it rain  
Make it rain down lord  
Make it rain  
Oh make it rain  
  
Verse 2  
Well a seed needs the water  
Before it grows out of the ground  
But it just keeps on getting hard  
Hunger more profound  
Well I know they cant count tears from the eye  
But they may as well be in vain  
And even though I know these tears come with pain  
Even so and just the same  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Verse 3  
The seas are full of water  
Stops by the shore  
Its like the riches of grandeur  
Never reach the poor  
And let the clouds fill with thunderous applause  
And let lightning be the veins  
And fill the sky with all that they can draw  
When its time to make a change  
  
Chorus x4
