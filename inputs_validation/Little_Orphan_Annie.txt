Play your fiddle Little Orphan Annie  
Play it for the shrimpers and the pirates out to sea  
Play it for the hippies down in Mallory Square  
If Im not there wont you play a song for me  
  
We all called her Little Orphan Annie at the playground  
Merry go merry go merry go round  
Till she picked her fiddle up we always put her down  
When she picked her fiddle up  
They come for miles around to hear her play  
  
Play your fiddle Little Orphan Annie  
Play it for the shrimpers and the pirates out to sea  
Play it for the hippies down in Mallory Square  
If Im not there wont you play a song for me
