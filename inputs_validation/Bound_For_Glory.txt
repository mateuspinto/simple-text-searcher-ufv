Out on the transCanada highway  
There was a girl hitchhiking with her dog  
Fireflies buzzin round her head  
Like candles in the fog  
  
He was three miles down the road  
Tryin to stay up but he knew that he couldnt  
She was looking for a ride through the night  
But out there who wouldnt  
  
They were bound for glory  
Bound for living on the edge  
They were bound for each other  
Like two comets heading for a bed  
  
She had a new way of living  
New way of looking at life  
He had an 84 International and two kids  
He left back home with his wife  
  
He was tired of writin letters to himself  
And living in the dark  
She was open to suggestions  
And some say she had a broken heart  
  
He had everything he wanted  
Til it all turned out to be a job  
One fallen asleep trucker  
And a girl hitchhiking with her dog  
  
They were bound for glory  
Bound for living on the edge  
They were bound for each other  
Like two comets heading for a bed  
  
She had a new way of living  
New way of looking at life  
He had an 84 International and two kids  
He left back home with his wife  
  
Out on the transCanada highway  
The sun came climbing up the cab  
By the time it hit the window they were wakin up  
From what little sleep they had  
  
When that heat hit the blankets  
They were looking for love at second sight  
Just starin in each others eyes  
Findin it in the mornin light  
  
They were bound for glory  
Bound for living on the edge  
They were bound for each other  
Like two blankets layin on a bed  
  
She had a new way of living  
New way of looking at life  
He had an 84 International and two kids  
He left back home with his wife
