Were holding on to nothing left to hold onto  
Im so tired of holding on to nothin  
The years have shown no kindness  
For the hard times weve been through  
  
Weve squeezed the life from every dream  
And still go right on bluffin  
With really nothin left to hold onto  
  
Oh why do we keep holding on  
With nothing left to hold onto  
Lets be honest with each other  
Thats the least that we can do  
I feel guilty when they envy me and you  
Were holding on with nothing left to hold onto  
  
We were young and foolishly mistaken  
Victims of a passion much too strong to be denied  
With only tears to show for all the years that weve been fakin  
God only knows how long how hard weve tried  
  
Oh why do we keep holding on  
With nothing left to hold onto  
Lets be honest with each other  
Thats the least that we can do  
I feel guilty when they envy me and you  
Were holding on with nothing left to hold onto  
  
Were holding on with nothing left to hold onto
