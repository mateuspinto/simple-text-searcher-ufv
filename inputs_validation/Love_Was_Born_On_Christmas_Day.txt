Love was born on christmas day  
  
It was a dark starry night  
That made the world see the light  
Three wise men followed the star  
The angels led them to a new born child  
When they saw him love filled the air  
  
It was a cold December night  
A father a mother and a child  
  
Chorus  
Love was born on Christmas day  
Love was born on Christmas day  
Sleeping in a manger  
Was the world only Saviour  
Humble beginnings of love  
Were given and shown to the world  
Love was born on Christmas day  
  
Frankincense Myrth and gold  
Were the first gifts of love  
Given to a poor child by kings  
A shepherd and his lambs  
Gathered around to see a miracle  
On a peaceful night angels sung and prayed  
  
Picture of love on a cold December night  
A father a mother and a child  
  
Repeat chorus 2X
