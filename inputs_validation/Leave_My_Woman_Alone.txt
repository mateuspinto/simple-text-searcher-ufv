If you dont want you dont have to get in trouble  
If you dont want you dont have to get in trouble  
If you dont want you dont have to get in trouble  
Say you better leave my woman alone  
  
Well I know you are a playboy  
And youve got women all over town  
But listen buddy if you ever sweettalk my little girl  
Im gonna lay your body down  
  
Chorus  
If you dont want you dont have to get in trouble  
You know you dont want oh yeah get in trouble  
If you dont want you dont have to get in trouble  
Say it Oh you better leave my woman alone  
  
Well I know you got your money  
And youve got a new fiftysix too  
But if I ever see my little girl in your new car  
Im gonna do some work on you  
  
Chorus  
  
Well I dont believe in trouble  
So I dont want to start a fight  
So if youll take heed and stay away from my little girl  
Then everything will be alright  
  
Chorus  
  
My woman alone  
My woman alone  
You better leave woman alone  
Better leave woman alone  
My woman alone woman alone  
I said woman alone  
I said woman alone  
I said woman alone  
You better leave woman alone  
You better leave woman alone  
You better leave woman alone  
My woman alone  
I woman alone

My woman woman alone  
My woman alone woman alone  
Oh now woman alone  
Oh oo woman alone  
Oh yeah woman alone  
Oh yeah woman alone  
You better leave woman alone  
My woman alone woman alone  
  
If you dont want you dont have to get in trouble  
If you dont want you dont have to get in trouble  
If you dont want you dont have to get in trouble  
Say it Yeah you better leave my woman alone  
My woman alone
