A country girl in Paris moonlight on the Seine  
Memories of Tennessee Nashville in the rain  
Its such a contradiction a heart thats filled with pain  
A country girl in Paris dreamin Nashville in the rain  
  
She walks along the boulevard Champs Alysee  
Thinks about a country boy three thousand miles away  
Pride is such a hard thing its such a price to pay  
To be all alone in Paris with true love so far away  
  
Up upon Mont Martre when she stops to rest awhile  
All the artists look at her and they long to paint her smile  
For even in her sorrow theres something in her eyes  
That makes the young men jealous makes the old men sigh  
  
They say the loss of innocence is always linked to pain  
For once the heart is opened nothing ever is the same  
And so the evening lends itself to lovers and romance  
The way to heal a broken heart is to give true love  
One more chance  
  
A country girl in Paris moonlight on the Seine  
Memories of Tennessee Nashville in the rain  
Its such a contradiction a heart thats filled with pain  
A country girl in Paris dreamin Nashville in the rain  
A country girl in Paris longing for Nashville in the rain
