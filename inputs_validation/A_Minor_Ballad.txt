Beyond the wild misty mountain  
Within the valley so free  
There dwells a maid with a heart so mellow  
Soft as the wind and wild as the sea  
When will you love me  
As I love thee  
  
I have no gold to give her  
Nor gowns of soft crimson hue  
Nor poems of love no rhymes to bring her  
Into my heart so strong so true  
When will you love me  
As I love you  
  
Beyond the wild misty mountain  
Within the valley so free  
There dwells a maid with a heart so mellow  
Soft as the wind and wild as the sea  
When will you love me  
As I love thee
