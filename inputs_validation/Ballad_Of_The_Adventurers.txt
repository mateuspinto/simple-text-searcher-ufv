Sickened by sun with rainstorms lashing him rotten  
A looted wreath crowning his tangled hair  
Every moment of his youth apart from its dream was forgotten  
Gone the roof overhead but the sky was always there  
Oh you who are flung out alike from heaven and from Hades  
You murderers whove been so bitterly repaid  
Why did you part from the mothers who nursed you as babies  
It was peaceful and you slept and there you stayed  
Still he explores and rakes the absinthe green oceans  
Though his mother has given him up for lost  
Grinning and cursing with a few odd tears of contrition  
Always in search of that land where life seems best  
Loafing through hells and flocked through paradises  
Calm and grinning with a vanishing face  
At times he still dreams of a small field he recognises  
With a blue sky overhead and nothing else
