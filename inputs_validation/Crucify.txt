Every finger in the room is pointing at me  
I want to spit in their faces then I get afraid of what that could bring  
I got a bowling ball in my stomach I got a desert in my mouth  
Figures that my courage would choose to sell out now  
  
Ive been looking for a savior in these dirty streets  
Looking for a savior beneath these dirty sheets  
Ive been raising up my hands  
Drive another nail in just what god needs one more victim  
  
Why do we crucify ourselves  
Every day  
I crucify myself  
Nothing I do is good enough for you  
Crucify myself  
Every day  
And my heart is sick of being in chains  
  
Got a kick for a dog beggin for love  
I gotta have my suffering so that I can have my cross  
I know a cat named Easter he says  
Will you ever learn youre just an empty cage girl  
If you kill the bird  
  
Ive been looking for a savior  
Looking for a savior  
Ive been raising up my hands  
Got enough guilt to start my own religion  
Please be save me  
I cry  
  
Why do we
