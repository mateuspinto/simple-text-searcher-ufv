I wont take all that they hand me down  
And make out a smile though I wear a frown  
And Im not gonna take it all lying down  
Cause once I get started I go to town  
  
Cause Im not like everybody else  
Im not like everybody else  
Im not like everybody else  
Im not like everybody else  
  
And I dont want to ball about like everybody else  
And I dont want to live my life like everybody else  
And I wont say that I feel fine like everybody else  
Cause Im not like everybody else  
Im not like everybody else  
  
But darling you know that I love you true  
Do anything that you want me to  
Confess all my sins like you want me to  
Theres one thing that I will say to you  
Im not like everybody else  
Im not like everybody else  
  
Im not like everybody else  
Im not like everybody else  
And I dont want to ball about like everybody else  
And I dont want to live my life like everybody else  
And I wont say that I feel fine like everybody else  
Cause Im not like everybody else  
Im not like everybody else  
  
Like everybody else  
Like everybody else  
Like everybody else  
Like everybody else  
  
If you all want me to settle down  
Slow up and stop all my running round  
Do everything like you want me to  
Theres one thing that I will say to you  
Im not like everybody else  
Im not like everybody else  
  
Im not like everybody else  
Im not like everybody else  
And I dont want to ball about like everybody else  
And I dont want to live my life like everybody else  
And I wont say that I feel fine like everybody else  
Cause Im not like everybody else  
Im not like everybody else  
  
Like everybody else like everybody else  
Like everybody else like everybody else  
Like everybody else like everybody else
