I hope the ring you gave to her  
Turns her finger green  
I hope when youre in bed with her  
You think of me  
I would never wish bad things  
But I dont wish you well  
Could you tell  
By the flames that burned your words  
I never read your letter  
Cause I knew what youd say  
Give me that Sunday school answer  
Try make it all OK  
  
Chorus  
Does it hurt  
To know Ill never be there  
But it sucks  
To see my face everywhere  
It was you  
Who chose to end it like you did  
I was the last to know  
You knew  
Exactly what you would do  
And dont say  
You simply lost your way  
She may believe you  
But I never will  
Never again  
  
If she really knows the truth  
She deserves you  
A trophy wife oh how cute  
Ignorance is bliss  
But when your day comes  
And hes through with you  
And hell be through with you  
Youll die together but alone  
You wrote me in a letter  
You couldnt say it right to my face  
Well give me that Sunday school answer  
Repent yourself away  
  
Chorus  
  
Never again will I hear you  
Never again will I miss you  
Never again will I fall to you  
Never  
Never again will I kiss you  
Never again will I want to  
Never again will I love you  
Never  
  
Does it hurt  
To know Ill never be there  
But it sucks  
To see my face everywhere  
It was you  
Who chose to end it like you did  
I was the last to know  
You knew  
Exactly what you would do  
And dont say  
You simply lost your way  
They may believe you  
But I never will  
I never will  
I never will  
Never again
