Were spinning round on this ball of hate  
Theres no parole theres no great escape  
Were sentenced here until the end of days  
And then my brother theres a price to pay  
  
Were only human we were born to die  
Without the benefit of reason why  
We live for pleasure to be satisfied  
And now its over theres no place to hide  
  
Why dont you come down to  
Its such a brutal planet  
Its such an ugly world  
Why wont you come down to  
  
This world is such perfection What a sight  
Its just like paradise For your eyes  
A truly grand creation What a sight  
From up here it looks so nice For my eyes  
  
Its such a brutal planet  
Its such a living hell  
It was a holy garden  
Thats right where Adam fell  
Its where the bite was taken  
Its where we chose to sin  
Its where we first were naked  
This is where our death begins  
  
We took advice from that deceiving snake  
He said dont worry its a piece of cake  
And sent us swimming in a burning lake  
Now were abandoned here for heavens sake  
  
Why dont you come down to  
Its such a brutal planet  
Its such an ugly world  
Why wont you come down to  
  
This world is such perfection What a sight  
Its just like paradise For my eyes  
A truly grand creation What a sight  
From up here it looks so nice For my eyes  
  
Heres where we keep the armies  
Heres where we write their names  
Heres where the money god is  
Heres our famous hall of shame  
Heres where we starve the hungry  
Heres where we cheat the poor  
Heres where we beat the children  
Here is where we pay the whores  
  
Why dont you come down to  
Its such a brutal planet  
Its such an ugly world  
Why wont you come down to  
  
This world is such perfection What a sight  
Its just like paradise For my eyes  
A truly grand creation What a sight  
From up here it looks so nice For my eyes  
  
Right here we stoned the prophets  
Built idols out of mud  
Right here we fed the lions  
Christian flesh and Christian blood  
Down here is where we hung him  
Upon an ugly cross  
Over there we filled the ovens  
Right here the holocaust
