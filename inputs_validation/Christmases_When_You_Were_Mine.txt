Please take down the mistletoe  
Cause I dont wanna think about that right now  
Cause everything I want is miles away  
In a snow covered little town  
My mommas in the kitchen worrying about me  
Seasons greetings hope youre well  
Well Im doing alright  
If you were wondering  
Lately I can never tell  
  
I know this shouldnt be a lonely time  
But there were Christmases when you were mine  
  
Ive been doing fine without you really  
Up until the nights got cold  
And everybodys here except you baby  
Seems like everyones got someone to hold  
  
But for me its just a lonely time  
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine  
  
Merry Christmas everybody  
Thatll have to be something I just say this year  
Ill bet you got your mom another sweater  
And were your cousins late again  
When you were putting up the lights this year  
Did you notice one less pair of hands  
  
I know this shouldnt be a lonely time  
But there were Christmases when I didnt wonder how you are tonight  
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine  
  
You were mine
