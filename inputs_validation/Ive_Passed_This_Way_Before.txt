Life lands a freshing blow  
And once again our heart is broken  
And as history repeats itself  
These few words are sadly spoken  
  
Ive passed this way before  
Ive felt this pain before  
A hurt that took so long to end  
Has found my poor heart again  
  
As I watch love walking away  
It brings back old memories  
But a familiar pain still feels the same  
Once again heartache has found me  
  
A dark cloud covered my heart  
Oh when she told me goodbye  
Now theres nothing left but emptiness  
And the tears that filled my crying eyes  
  
Ive passed this way before  
Ive felt this pain before  
A hurt that took so long to end  
Has found my poor heart again  
  
No matter how strong a man is  
Without a love he walks in the dark baby  
If love deserts him it would surely hurt him  
Cause his weakness is his heart  
  
A lonely journey now stands before me  
The endless pain has started  
But this time I know the way  
Walking alone and broken hearted  
  
Because Ive passed this way before  
And Ive felt this pain before  
A hurt that took so long to end  
Has found my poor heart again  
  
Ive passed this way before  
Ive felt this pain before  
A hurt that took so long to end  
Has found my poor heart again
