Tonight youre mine completely  
You give your love so sweetly  
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes my darling  
But will you love me tomorrow  
  
Is this a lasting treasure  
Or just a moments pleasure  
Can I believe the magic of your sighs My darling  
Will you still love me tomorrow  
  
Tonight with words unspoken  
You say that Im the only one  
But will my heart be broken  
When the night meets the morning sun  
  
Id like to know that your love  
Is just a love I can be sure of  
So tell me now and I wont ask again  
Will you still love me Will you still love me  
  
Will you still love me tomorrow  
So tell now I wont ask again  
Will you still love me tomorrow  
  
Will you still love me tomorrow  
Will you still love me tomorrow  
Will you still love me tomorrow
