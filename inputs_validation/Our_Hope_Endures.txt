You would think only so much can go wrong  
Calamity only strikes once  
And you assume that this one has suffered her share  
Life will be kinder from here  
  
Sometimes the sun stays hidden for years  
Sometimes the sky rains night after night  
When will it clear  
But our hope endures the worst of conditions  
Its more than our optimism  
Let the earth quake  
Our hope is unchanged  
  
How do we comprehend peace within pain  
Our joy at a good mans wake  
Walk a mile with a woman whose body is torn  
With illness but she marches on  
  
Sometimes the sun stays hidden for years  
Sometimes the sky rains night after night  
When will it clear  
  
But our hope endures the worst of conditions  
Its more than our optimism  
Let the earth quake  
Our hope is unchanged  
  
Emanuel God is with us  
El Shaddai all sufficient  
Emanuel God is with us  
El Shaddai all sufficient  
Emanuel God is with us  
El Shaddai all sufficient  
  
We never walk alone  
This is our hope  
Our hope endures the worst of conditions  
Its more than our optimism  
Let the earth quake  
Let the earth quake  
Let the earth quake  
Our hope is unchanged
