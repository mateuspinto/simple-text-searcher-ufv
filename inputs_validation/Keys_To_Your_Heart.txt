You might say  
You dont love me  
That might be right  
Say that you wanted me  
Say that you needed me  
Say that you wanted me  
  
And I said now hold me  
Please hold me  
Make this seem right  
All through the night  
I said hold me  
Please hold me  
Yes you can try just a little  
For you to make it right  
  
Holding on for so long  
Gets me the keys to your heart  
  
So let me take a little while  
To tell you about heaven heaven in my life  
It could be a secret  
It could be a lie  
Its a case of holding on til I die  
  
Now I said now hold me  
Please hold me  
Make this seem right  
All through the night  
And I said now hold me  
Please hold me  
Yes you can try just a little  
For you to make it right  
  
Holding on for so long  
Gets me the keys to your heart  
Holding on for so long  
Gets me the keys to your heart  
  
And I said now hold me  
Please hold me  
Yes you can try just a little  
Please try just a little  
Please try and you will see  
  
Holding on for so long  
Gets me the keys to your heart  
Holding on for so long  
Gets me the keys to your heart  
You gotta give a little  
To get the keys to your heart  
Gets me the keys to your heart
