His shadow floats upon the earth  
Casting a song from the north  
Yeshua weeps Zions song  
Thy will of man  
My kingdom gone  
  
You place all your hatred upon my throne  
Your hands form your own path  
Curse the one that has made you  
I see Cain in all your eyes  
  
I am laying down to go to sleep forever  
I do not hide my face in shame at all  
I do not cower before your blade  
This is what your black hearts pray  
  
Time moves as slow as the oceans tide  
Neon explosion in the haggard sky  
No sun shall set  
Lest we forget  
Mans will be done  
  
The last Lamb  
The last hope  
The last song from Zion
