They say you never come home boy you been drivin too fast  
When you gonna shape up how long is this gonna last  
You may be laughin today but listen to some good advice  
An take a look at tomorrow in a workin mans weary eyes  
You gotta pick a carreer go for the gold  
Smile for the camera do what youre told  
Well you can take away the ladder cause I aint gonna climb it  
If theres a stairway to heaven I swear Im gonna find it  
  
Well there are winners and outlaws and leaders and lovers  
Behind every man in the news  
And one thing I know is behind everyone theres a boy who had nothin to lose  
Behind every man who has somethin to say  
Theres a boy who had nothin to prove  
An every hero was once every villain was once just a boy with a bad attitude  
Every hero was once every villain was once just a boy with a bad attitude  
  
She says you never call how come youre actin so tough  
You either hold me too tight or you dont hold me enough  
Dont be afraid of me angel I aint about to clip your wings  
Just put your feet on the ground and your arms around the real thing  
  
You gotta love me for keeps feather the nest  
Plan for the future an gimme your best  
Boy were never gonna have a normal family life  
Steamin up and down the speedway on the back a your bike  
  
Well there are winners and outlaws and leaders and lovers  
Behind every man in the news  
And one thing I know is behind everyone theres a boy who had nothin to lose  
Behind every man who has somethin to say  
Theres a boy who had nothin to prove
