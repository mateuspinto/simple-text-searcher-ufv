Ladies and gentlemen  
Yeszir  
Lets do it  
Yeszir  
  
Yo On and on and my nuts Im palming  
Take two of these and call me in the morning  
You should see the way the chain heart is to charmin  
Flying like a bird like Nelly Furtado  
Shit pop ya bottles toast to screen cheers  
Getcha 2step cuz its the record of the year  
Nigga that brought you ice creams 2 for a pair  
Officially announcing that this is warfare  
Cuz back in the day my clouds was grey  
And it seemed like my angels couldnt blow them away  
But then i sold my first verse that cut the NSX  
But i was still ridin in them thin ass jets  
But now  
  
My business so clear out the window of the leer  
And Im talking on my celly all this shit that you should hear  
Listen clearly now

And act like ya tryin to get this money right quick  
So can i have it like that  
You got it like that

You got it like that  
  
On and on and this beat is zoning  
I control the mind straight over the phone  
Let em explore the words something like a tourist  
They never get addicted unless the headywop is serious  
From Louisdales to Jimmy Choos is real  
She knows the time she sees the richard mille  
Flat double skeletal tourbillon  
Its just like her body move it turns her on  
She like the way my hands use her body for hand warmers  
And all our car doors go up like Transformers  
See i can do it thisaway i can do it thataway  
From the crib in Viginia to that new Miami getaway  
So cool like new edition that she hollas ya scent  
Ill get it ok let it boil away  
But please run along cuz ladeez is feelin wrong  
And I got some right for em right after this song  
Cuz my name is SkateBoardP

On and on and the temperatures warming  
I spit heat flashes niggaz get nautious  
Bright as a bitch  
So analyze with caution  
When the light hit the ice bet a 100 that you vomit  
Should i mention the fact the transition is the track  
No one change into the vision just to get me where Im at  
No skateboy P too grown  
Riding up and down college in that new 2 tone  
Its so cold you dont wanna feel the chill of it Uh  
Just stand back and just look at the grill of it Uh  
I dont smoke but i bet the love it  
It totally intensifies vivd ass appeal of it  
  
You could be jealous and grit ya teeth  
But all these little nigaas got something in reach  
  
While on my boat party trying to sunseek
