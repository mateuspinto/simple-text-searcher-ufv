Do the walls come down  
When you think of me  
Do your eyes grow dim  
Do the walls come down  
When you think of me  
Do you let me in  
Do the walls come down  
  
Nothing like a rainy night  
To set your heart remembering  
Nothing like a vivid dream  
To take you back again  
  
When you think of me  
Do your eyes grow dim  
Do the walls come down  
When you think of me  
Do you let me in  
Do the walls come down  
  
Something in my pocket  
That was written years ago  
In faded ink said You are my fire  
Do you think so  
  
Do the walls come down  
When you think of me  
Do your eyes grow dim  
Do the walls come down  
When you think of me  
Do you let me in  
Do the walls come down  
  
Is it easier for you to say  
You never loved me anyway  
Or do you hide me in your attic trunk  
Like a stowaway  
  
Do you think of me  
Do your eyes grow dim  
Do the walls come down  
When you think of me  
Do you let me in  
  
Oh baby do the walls come down  
Oh baby do the walls come down  
Do the walls come  
Do the walls come  
Do the walls come down  
  
Do the walls come  
Do the walls come  
Do the walls come down  
Do the walls come down  
  
When you think of me
