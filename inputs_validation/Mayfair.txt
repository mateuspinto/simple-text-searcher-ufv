Mayfair strange in the morning light  
Mayfair strange in the summer night  
Mayfair strangest in the afternoon  
Mayfair stretching far above  
Full of fame but lacking love  
Could it be we see the Mayfair moon  
Mayfair strange across the park  
In the day or in the dark  
Theres no need to walk or even run  
Mayfair faces clean and nice  
But beauty here is cold as ice  
Could it be we see the Mayfair sun  
Mayfair strange at every hour  
Hidden frowns with mystic power  
Starry heights and golden throne  
Down below youre on your own  
Mayfair strange for passersby  
Sights of wonder for the eye  
Could it be that theyll pass by again  
Mayfair calling far and near  
For even trees are wealthy here  
Could it be we hear the Mayfair rain  
Mayfair strange in the morning light  
Mayfair strange in the summer night  
Mayfair strangest in the afternoon  
Mayfair stretching far above  
Full of fame but lacking love  
Could it be we see the Mayfair moon
