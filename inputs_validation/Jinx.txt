I fucked up again its all my fault  
So turn me around and face the wall  
Read me my rights and tell me Im wrong  
Until it gets into my thick skull  
A slap on the wrist  
A stab in the back  
Torture me Ive been a bad boy  
Nail me to the cross until you have won  
I lost before I did any wrong  
Im hexed with regrets and bad luck  
Keep you distance cause its rubbing off  
Or you will be damned to spend your life in hell  
Or earth with me tangled at your feet  
You finally met you nemesis disguised as your fatal long lost love  
So kiss it good bye  
Until death do we part  
You fell for a jinx for crying out loud  
Im a curse hanging around you in the end
