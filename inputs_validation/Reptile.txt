She spread herself wide open to let the insects in  
She leaves a trail of honey to show me where shes been  
She has the blood of reptile just underneath her skin  
Seeds from a thousand others drip down from within  
Oh my beautiful liar  
Oh my precious whore  
My disease my infection  
I am so impure  
Devils speak of the ways in which shell manifest  
Angels bleed from the tainted touch of my caress  
Need to contaminate to alleviate this loneliness  
I now know the depths I reach are limitless  
Oh my beautiful liar  
Oh my precious whore  
My disease my infection  
I am so impure
