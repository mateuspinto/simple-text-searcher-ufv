Are you happy  
I met a pretty girl on a date last night  
And let me tell you now she was groovy  
And I kissed the pretty girl and I held her tight  
Let me tell you now she was groovy  
  
And now no matter what I try to do  
My minds drifting back to you  
  
Are you happy  
And now no matter what I try to do  
My minds drifting back to you  
  
Are you happy  
To you  
Are you happy  
Oh I love you  
Please tell me now that youre happy  
Please tell me now that youre mine  
  
Please tell me now that youre happy  
Please tell me now that youre mine  
  
I want to tell you I love you  
Are you happy
