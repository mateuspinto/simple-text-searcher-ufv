Once upon a time in a faraway land  
A young Prince lived in a shining castle  
Although he had everything his heart desired  
The Prince was spoiled selfish and unkind  
But then one winters night  
An old beggar woman came to the castle  
And offered him a single rose In return for shelter from the bitter cold  
Repulsed by her haggard appearance  
The Prince sneered at the gift  
And turned the old woman away  
But she warned him not to be deceived by appearances  
For Beauty is found within  
And when he dismissed her again  
The old womans ugliness melted away  
To reveal a beautiful Enchantress  
The Prince tried to apologize but it was too late  
For she had seen that there was no love in his heart  
And as punishment  
She transformed him into a hideous beast  
And placed a powerful spell on the castle  
And all who lived there  
Ashamed of his monstrous form  
The beast concealed himself inside his castle  
With a magic mirror as his only window to the outside world  
The Rose she had offered  
Was truly an enchanted rose  
Which would bloom for many years  
If he could learn to love another  
And earn her love in return  
By the time the last petal fell  
Then the spell would be broken  
If not he would be doomed to remain a beast  
For all time  
As the years passed  
He fell into despair and lost all hope  
For who could ever learn to love A Beast
