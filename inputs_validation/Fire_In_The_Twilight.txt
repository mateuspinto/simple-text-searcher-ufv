Hot on the run from the grip of the power game  
The man who leads the way the man who leads the way  
Shell in its box from his home that theyll never tame  
The man who leads the way the man who leads the way  
  
He is burning burning in the twilight  
He is turning turning to face us  
He is burning fire in the twilight  
He is turning turning to lead us away away away  
Lead us away away away  
  
Taking a break from the role of the everyday boy  
The man who leads the way the man who leads the way  
Is he for real or is he back to the old way boy  
Can he lead the way oh can he lead the way  
Hes searching but hes lonely and hes hurting but hes only  
Waiting for a chance just in time to live a life  
Does he need ya does he want ya  
Does he listen to what you say  
Is he only waiting for the simple way  
  
He is burning burning in the twilight  
He is turning turning to face us  
He is burning fire in the twilight  
He is turning turning to lead us away away away  
Lead us away away away
