Christmas toys all over the place  
Little Shelby wears a funny smile on his face  
Shelby has a secret  
And the secret he must share  
He wants to tell somebody  
So he tells his teddy bear  
  
Chorus  
I saw Mama kissing Santa Claus  
Underneath the mistletoe last night  
She didnt see me creep  
Down the stairs to have a peekit says peep but go with peek  
She thought that I was tucked up in my bedroom fast asleep  
Then I saw Mama tickle Santa Claus  
Underneath his beard so snowy white  
Oh what a laugh it would have been  
If Daddy had only seen  
Mama kissing Santa Claus last night  
  
Repeat Chorus
