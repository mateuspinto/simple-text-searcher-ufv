The storm is coming but I dont mind  
People are dying I close my blinds  
All that I know is Im breathing now  
  
I want to change the world instead I sleep  
I want to believe in more than you and me  
But all that I know is Im breathing  
All I can do is keep breathing  
All we can do is keep breathing  
Now I now I  
Now I now now  
  
All that I know is Im breathing  
All I can do is keep breathing Repeat x5  
  
All we can do is keep breathing Repeat x5  
Now
