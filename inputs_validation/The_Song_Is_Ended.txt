My thoughts go back to a heavenly dance  
A moment of bliss we spent  
Our hearts were filled with a song of romance  
As into the night we went  
And sang to our hearts content  
The song is ended  
But the melody lingers on  
You and the song are gone  
But the melody lingers on  
The night was splendid  
And the melody seemed to say  
Summer will pass away  
Take your happiness while you may  
There neath the light of the moon  
We sang a love song that ended too soon  
The moon descended  
And I found with the break of dawn  
You and the song had gone  
But the melody lingers on
