Well I saw my first rodeo in Amarillo Texas  
Busting broncos is more than just a way to make a living  
Horses were like women they were fast and fancy free  
  
I saw Shirley stoker up in pan head West Virginia  
Her and Connie Shovelhead was standing in the rain  
Both of them were dressers Lord they sure were looking pretty  
Motorcycle fever has almost drove me insane  
  
Eighteen were rollin when I climbed up in that Ken Worth  
Me oh my that semi was the apple of my eye  
Horses trucks and motorcycles sure makes life worth living  
Hope I never see the day I kiss them all good bye
