Lately I saved myself  
Lately I saved myself  
Lately I saved myself  
See I I was wrong but I saved myself  
And you held out your hand and it was all that I had  
And these places Ive been that you couldnt share with me  
But your tears had their place on those cold lonely days  
And I was wrong but I need you now  
Lately I saved myself  
Lately I saved myself  
Lately I saved myself  
Cause I I was wrong but I saved myself  
You held out your hand when it was all that I had  
Through those rapid winds of change you were solid at the base  
But your tears had their place on those cold lonely days  
And I was wrong but I need you now  
So so sorry Im so sorry  
So so sorry Im so sorry  
So so sorry Im so sorry  
So so sorry cause I was wrong
