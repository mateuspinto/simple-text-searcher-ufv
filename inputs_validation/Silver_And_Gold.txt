In the shit house a shotgun  
Praying hands hold me down  
Only the hunter was hunted  
In this tin can town  
Tin can town  
  
No stars in the black night  
Looks like the sky fell down  
No sun in the daylight  
Looks like its chained to the ground  
Chained to the ground  
The warden said  
The exit is sold  
If you want a way out  
Silver and gold  
  
Broken back to the ceiling  
Broken nose to the floor  
I scream at the silence its crawling  
It crawls under the door  
Theres a rope around my neck  
And theres a trigger in your gun  
Jesus say something  
I am someone I am someone  
I am someone  
  
Captain and kings  
In the ships hold  
They came to collect  
Silver and gold  
Silver and gold  
  
Seen the coming and going  
Seen them captains and the kings  
See them navy blue uniforms  
See them bright and shiny things  
Bright shiny things  
  
The temperature is rising  
The fever white hot  
Mister I aint got nothing  
But its more than you got  
  
Chains no longer bind me  
Not the shackles at my feet  
Outside are the prisoners  
Inside the free  
Set them free  
Set them free  
  
A prize fighter in a corner is told  
Hit where it hurts  
Silver and gold  
Silver and gold  
  
spoken part follows  
  
Yep silver and gold This song was written in a hotel room in New York city
round about the time a friend or ours Little Steven was putting together a
record of artists against apartheid This is a song written about a man in a
shanty town outside of Johannesburg A man whos sick of looking down the
barrel of white South Africa A man who is at the point where he is ready to
take up arms against his oppressor A man who has lost faith in the
peacemakers of the west while they argue and while they fail to support a man
like bishop Tutu and his request for economic sanctions against South Africa  
  
Am I buggin you I dont mean to bug ya  
  
Okay Edge play the blues
