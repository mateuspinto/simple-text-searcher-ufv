Kat was in the bedroom  
Playing hidehideho  
Lou was in the kitchen  
Kissing Michelangelo  
Ray was in a coffin  
Taking measurements  
With string  
Jean was cleaning  
Windows trying to  
Teach the world to sing  
The satellite was beaming  
In a cabaret show were  
Juliet was arguing with stupid romeo  
The dog was reading poetry by  
Poe and valerie  
And I was sat there thinking  
How happy we could be  
  
Bye bye baby  
Baby bye bye  
I feel so happy but I dont know why  
Were off to see the wizard  
AWOL  
Bye bye baby  
I wish you well  
  
Now the sneaky fat magician  
He stole my handkerchief  
He blew his nose and gave  
Himself 20 years of grief  
And I was so dumbfounded  
When he asked me for a loan  
I told him to repeat it  
To my tiny dictaphone  
And all the lazy bastards  
That ever walked the earth  
Were trying to get hold of me  
From Tokyo to Perth  
But I was up the cundy  
Combing my goatee  
You thought I was surrounded  
But with one bound  our hero was free  
  
Bye bye baby  
Baby bye bye  
I feel so happy but I dont know why  
Were off to see the wizard  
AWOL  
Bye bye baby  
I wish you well  
  
Now all you gay lieutenants  
Who follow the yellow brick  
Be sure to take your happy pills  
Before you get seasick  
The journey is longwinded  
With many twists and snakes  
And I forgot to mention  
There were never any breaks
