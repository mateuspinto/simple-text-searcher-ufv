A woman left lonely will soon grow tired of waiting  
Shell do crazy things yeah on lonely occasions  
A simple conversation for the new men now and again  
Makes a touchy situation when a good face come into your head  
And when she gets lonely shes thinking bout her man  
She knows hes taking her for granted yeah yeah  
Honey she doesnt understand no no no no  
  
Well the fevers of the night they burn an unloved woman  
Yeah those redhot flames try to push old love aside  
A woman left lonely shes the victim of her man yes she is  
When he cant keep up his own way good Lord  
Shes got to do the best that she can yeah  
A woman left lonely Lord that lonely girl  
Lord Lord Lord
