Well its almost nightfall  
And theres no forecast of rainfall  
And Im in the mood for a party  
So Im gonna go out to a club  
And give the dancefloor body  
So I jump in the car and go to the venue  
Walk in the door and now Im on the menu  
Guys in the house theyre wacthing me  
Theyre clocking me theres no stopping me  
  
Desire I know you want me  
Youre fine thank you  
But Im not the type of girl that you think I am  
I dont jump into the arms of every man  
But Im paid I dont need your money  
I love you you must be mad  
Easy lover is something that I aint  
Besides I dont know you from a can of paint  
  
Tell me why is it when I walk past the guys  
I always hear yo baby  
I mean like whats the big idea  
Im a queen nuff respect  
Treat me like a lady  
And no my name aint yo and I aint got your baby  
Im looking for a guy whos sincere  
One with class and savoir faire  
Im looking for someone who has to be  
Perfect for the queen latifah me  
  
Fly girl fly girl  
Come here cause youre sexy and youre fine  
And I want you to be mine  
Fly girl fly girl  
Have no fear your heart is in good hands  
Wont you let me be your man  
  
All my friends are in relationships  
Some of then good ones and some of them bad ones  
Some of the bad ones took a turn for the better  
And some of the good ones ended up sad ones  
You see loving it aint hard to get  
I want a friend not just a lover  
Someone who is dedicated only to me  
Not to me and two or three others  
One who will not lie to me or think  
He can get my love by buying me  
I know Ill find him some day  
And when I find him  
He sure wont say  
  
Fly girl fly girl  
Come here cause youre sexy and youre fine  
And I want you to be mine  
Fly girl fly girl have no fear  
Have no fear your heart is in good hands  
Wont you let me be your man  
  
Lounging sitting in the house  
And Im cooling first day of the week  
So theres nothing to do  
And Im in the mood for a real soft kiss  
Momma never said therell be days like this  
So I called her and we talked for a while  
Hang up the phone feeling better  
With a smile  
  
Its cool cause 91 is my year  
And this time I know Im gonna hear  
  
Fly girl fly girl come here  
Come here cause youre sexy and youre fine  
And I want you to be mine  
Fly girl fly girl  
Have no fear your heart is in good hands  
Wont you let me be your man

But Im not the type of girl that you think I am  
I dont jump into the arms of every man  
But Im paid I dont need your money  
I love you you must be mad  
Easy lover is something that I aint  
Besides I dont know you from a can of paint
