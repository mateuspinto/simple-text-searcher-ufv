If I could look across the country  
From California to New Jersey  
Then I would count the parks and lake resorts  
And number all the jets and airports  
All those rather dreary rain clouds still bother me  
cause I look through the camera eyepiece and cannot see  
If I could open up my window  
And see from Tampa Bay to Juneau  
Then I would survey all those open miles  
And line them up in single file  
Everywhere I look I see green scenic sublime  
And all those oceanic vistas are so divine  
If I was standing on the balcony  
And you were walking down below  
Id feel rather depressed and out of place  
And lonely just to watch you go  
If you were swinging from the highway overpass  
Within the western hemisphere  
Id feel rather afraid and insincere  
If you began to disappear  
If I was walking through a sad art gallery  
And you were driving through the night  
Id feel rather alone and ill at ease  
Beneath the brilliant showroom light  
If I was flying on a plane above your town  
And you were gazing at the sky  
Somehow Id feel intact and reassured  
If you began to wave goodbye
