The more of you that I inspect  
The more of me I see reflect  
The more I try to read your lips  
The more the mask youre wearing rips  
But when I seek out your voice  
My ears are overcome with noise  
You show and tell with greatest ease  
Raving impossibilities  
Engaged in crime I grasp my throat  
Enraged my mind starts to smoke  
Enforce a mental overload  
Angry again angry again angry owe  
And when the story takes a twist  
If folds like a contortionist  
Slight of hand and quick exchange  
The old tricks have been rearranged  
Engaged in crime I grasp my throat  
Enraged my mind starts to smoke  
Enforce a mental overload  
Angry again angry again angry  
The searing of the sinew  
My body fights for air  
The ripping of the tissue  
My lungs begin to tear  
Gravitys got my bones  
It pulls my flesh away  
The steam finally dissipates  
I make out my sweaty face  
Association that I choose  
Game I inevitably lose  
Governed by laws set up by me  
Fracture its jaw to let me be  
A cutout cardboard condo maze  
Filled with an insubordinate race  
Irrational youths stop to stare  
As music rubber hosed the air  
Engaged in crime I grasp my throat  
Enraged my mind starts to smoke  
Enforce a mental overload  
Angry again angry again angry again  
And again and again again  
Engaged in crime I grasp my throat  
Enraged my mind starts to smoke  
Enforce a mental overload  
Angry again angry again angry owe
