I dont know whats going happen to you baby  
But I do know that I want you  
You walk around this town with your head all up in the sky  
And I do know that I want you  
  
Lets dance lets shout  
Shake you body down to the ground  
Shake you body down to the ground  
  
You tease me with your loving to play hard to get  
Cause you do know that I love it  
You walk around this town with your head all up in the sky  
And I do know that I want you  
  
Lets dance lets shout  
Shake you body down to the ground  
Shake you body down to the ground  
Shake you body down to the ground  
Shake you body down to the ground  
  
You are the spark that lit the fire inside of me  
And you know that I love it  
I need to do just something to get closer to your soul  
And you do know that I want to  
  
Lets dance lets shout  
Lets dance lets shout
