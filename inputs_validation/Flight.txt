Oh i have slipped the surly bonds of earth  
And danced the sky on laughter silvered wings  
Sunward ive climbed and joined the tumbling mirth  
Of sunsplit clouds and done a hundred things  
Ive wheeled and soared and swung high in the sunlit silence  
Hovering there ive chased the shouting winds aloft  
And flung my eager craft through footless halls of air  
  
The higher we fly the farther we go  
The closer we are to each other  
The darker the night the brighter the star  
In peace go my sisters and brothers  
  
Up up the long delirious burning blue  
Ive topped the windswept heights with easy grace  
Where never lark nor even eagle flew  
And while with silent lifting mind i trod  
The high untresspassed sanctity of space  
Put out my hand and touched the face of god  
  
The higher we fly the farther we go  
The closer we are to each other  
The darker the night the brighter the star  
In peace go my sisters and brothers
