Yesterday I would not have believed  
That tomorrow the sun would shine  
Then one day you came into my life  
I am alive again I am alive again  
  
All the empty yesterdays have disappeared  
Now that you have filled my life with love  
No one else could ever mean so much to me  
Every day my high lasts longer  
As our love grows ever stronger  
  
Yesterday I would not have believed  
That tomorrow the sun would shine  
Then one day you came into my life  
I am alive again I am alive again  
  
When you gave your love to me you changed my life  
Dreams that once seemed hopeless come with ease  
Thank you girl for being just the way you are  
I would never try to change you  
All I live for is to love you  
Im feeling alive again  
Im feeling alive again
