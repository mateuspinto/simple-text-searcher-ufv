Standing on the borderline  
Between joy and reason  
Tending carefully my fire  
Waiting for my season  
I know who these people are  
I know what they stand for  
Corruptions built into this plan  
Nothings under the other hand  
  
Tricks and trials await the child  
  
Instinct keeps me running  
Running like a deer  
Instinct keeps me running  
Running through the grinning shadows  
  
I have seen the sludgy beach  
And the poisoned river  
I have met the lordly rich  
Theyre just getting stiffer  
This whole place is like a maze  
Or like some Medusa  
Let me out I cant accept  
A certain read life story  
  
Tricks and trials await the child  
  
Instinct keeps me running  
Running like a deer  
Instinct keeps me running  
Running where the sorrow bless me  
Instinct keeps me running  
Running like a moose  
Instinct keeps me running  
Running to keep one chance open  
  
Marks on walls the common outlet  
Tell the truth and always will  
Marks on wall destroy the thought  
Of perfect sunny civilization  
  
Tricks and trials await the child  
  
Instinct keeps me running  
Running like a deer  
Instinct keeps me running  
Running through the grinning shadows  
Instinct keeps me running  
Running like a bear  
Instinct keeps me running  
Running to keep one chance open  
Instinct keeps me running  
Running cause I dont believe it  
Instinct keeps me running  
Running through the bare emotion  
Instinct keeps me running  
Instinct keeps me running  
Running  
Im running running running running
