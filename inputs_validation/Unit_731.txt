I am the last of the dying insane  
You would scream at the things Ive done  
Knowing that the dead still see  
My blood it runs like mercury  
  
Your last breath the sword comes down  
She dies first speaking death to me  
Philosophy the vision the view within  
Duty science abstract cruelty  
  
Chorus  
What are your final thoughts  
Do you want to kill me or die in shame  
From my point of view  
Justified action the enemy burns  
  
The fun of massacre in the brain  
Bioweapons and I are the same  
Look at their face hatred in their blood  
Pile up the dead my humanity  
  
Xrays burn all that you can see  
Nobody knows what a body can stand  
Skulls on fire yet mercy is worse  
You seek only your pleasure in death  
  
Chorus  
  
Bacterial target eyes exploding  
Melting flesh through your mind  
Become your madness insanity wins  
Infants flesh on the walls  
Testing limits threshold of pain  
Ripping out teeth to observe  
I want blood  
  
Repeat x4  
Knowing now the dead still see  
My blood it runs like mercury  
  
Human brain experiment  
On prisoners open skull  
Vivisection live dissection  
Repulsing to the core  
  
Chorus  
  
Fuckin burns  
  
Pathogens seek horrible end  
Churning factories of death  
Crematoriums see your crime  
You will see me in hell
