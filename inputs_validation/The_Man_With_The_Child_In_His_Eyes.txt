I hear him  
Before I go to sleep  
And focus on the day thats been  
I realize hes there  
When I turn the light off  
And turn over  
Nobody knows about my man  
They think hes lost on some horizon  
And suddenly I find myself listening  
To a man Ive never known before  
Telling me about the sea  
Oh his love is to eternity  
  
Oh hes here again  
The man with the child in his eyes  
Oh hes here again  
The man with the child in his eyes  
  
Hes very understanding and hes so  
Aware of all my situations  
When I stay up late  
Hes always with me  
What I feel when I hesitate  
Oh Im so worried about my love  
They say No No it wont last forever  
And here I am again my girl  
Wondering what on earth I am doing here  
Maybe he doesnt love me  
I just took a trip on my love for him  
  
Oh hes here again  
The man with the child in his eyes  
Oh hes here again  
The man with the child in his eyes
