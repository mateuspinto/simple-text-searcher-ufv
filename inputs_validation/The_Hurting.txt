Is it an horrific dream  
Am I sinking fast  
Could a person be so mean  
As to laugh and laugh  
On my own  
Could you ease my load  
Could you see my Pain  
Could you please explain  
The Hurting  
  
Could you understand a child  
When he cries in Pain  
Could you give him all he needs  
Or do you feel the same  
All along  
Youve been told youre wrong  
When you felt it right  
And youre left to fight  
The hurting  
  
Get in line with the things you know  
Feel the Pain  
Feel the sorrow  
Touch the hurt and dont let go  
Get in line with the things you know  
Learn to cry  
Like a baby  
Then the hurting wont come back
