I abandon every distraction  
My attention is set on You  
My devotion Jesus my portion  
My affection is set on You  
  
I was made to worship  
I was made for Your embrace  
I was made for worship  
I was made to bless Your name  
  
I will bless the lord at all times  
I will bless the lord at all times  
I was made to worship  
I was made to bless Your name  
  
I will shout Your praise forever  
I will shout Your praise forever  
I was made to worship  
I was made to bless Your name  
  
Captivated by Your goodness  
Overwhelmed by Your majesty  
Swept away in Your holy presence  
Giving over all of me  
  
My heart and flesh cries out  
For You to fill me up  
You satisfy me  
Fill me with Your power and truth  
Fill me with love from You  
You satisfy me
