Gonna tell you a story  
About Chuck and Diane  
Couple British kids from  
The palace at Buckingham  
Chuckie wants to grow up  
And be a polo star  
And ride his little horsies  
All around the backyard oh yeah  
You know they really paid their dues  
I said hey lawdy mama  
They got them Buckingham blues  
  
Now Chuckie goes hunting  
And leaves Diane alone  
So she fixes her hair  
And she talks on the Princess Phone  
Chuckies still tryin to figure out  
What his jobs supposed to be  
And Dianes the fashion leader  
Of the aristocracy  
I said hey Lady Di  
Tell me whered you get them shoes Ah  
Well hey nonny nonny  
Looks like you got them Buckingham blues  
  
Aw bein heir to the throne well  
It must be awful hard  
Gotta pose for pictures  
Out on the front yard  
And Lady Di well  
She must have it pretty rough  
Gotta hang around the house all day  
Makin babies and stuff  
Another game of croquet  
Then theyre off on a Caribbean cruise  
Well hey boparebop  
They really got them Buckingham blues  
  
Ah tell it to me now tell it towow  
Ah got my mojo workin  
  
They dont serve no Twinkees  
With their afternoon tea  
Never had a dinner  
Made by Chef BoyarDee  
Bein in the spotlight  
Is a hard life to choose  
Diane drops half a pound  
Its on the six oclock news Ah yeah  
Those kids have really paid their dues  
Aw what a royal pain it is  
When you got them Buckingham blues
