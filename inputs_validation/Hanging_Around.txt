She sat right down on the sofa  
And said Where have you been Ive been waiting for you  
Cause last night I had something so good  
These days get so long and I got nothin to do  
  
Ive been hanging around this town on a corner  
Ive been bummin around this old town so long  
Ive been hanging around this town on a corner  
Ive been bummin around this old town for way too long  
  
We spent all day gettin sober  
Just hiding from daylight watching tv fading away  
We just look a lot better in the blue light  
Well you know I gotta get out but Im stuck so tight  
Weighed by the chains that keep me  
  
Hanging around this town on a corner  
Ive been bummin around this old town too long  
Ive been hanging around this town on a corner  
Ive been bummin around this old town for way too long  
Well everybody trip  
  
You know man Im just Im just  
Im just tryin to scurry up a little  
  
This girl listens to the band play she says Where have you been  
I been lyin right here on the floor right here on the floor  
Well I got all this time to be waiting for what is mine to be hated  
What I am after the light has faded  
  
Hangin around this town on a corner  
Ive been bummin around this old town so long  
Ive been hanging around this town on a corner  
Ive been bummin around this old town for way too way  
  
Ive been hanging around this town on a corner  
Ive been bummin around this old town for way too long  
Ive been hanging around this town on a corner  
Ive been bummin around this old town for way  
Way way way way too long  
  
Way way way way too long  
Way way way way too long  
Way way way way too long  
Way way way way too long  
Way way way way too long  
Way way way way too long
