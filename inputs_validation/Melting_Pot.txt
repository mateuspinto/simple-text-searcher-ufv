Take a pinch of white man  
Wrap him up in black skin  
Add a touch of blue blood  
And a little bitty bit of red indian boy  
Oh like a curly latin kinkies  
Oh lordy lordy mixed with yellow chinkees yeah  
You know you lump it all together  
And you got a recipe for a get along scene  
Oh what a beautiful dream  
If it could only come true you know you know  
  
What we need is a great big melting pot  
Big enough enough enough to take  
The world and all its got  
And keep it stirring for  
A hundred years or more  
And turn out coffee coloured people by the score  
  
Rabbis and the friars  
Vishnus and the gurus  
We got the beatles or the sun god  
Well it really doesnt matter  
What religion you choose  
And be thankful little mrs Graceful  
You know that livin could be tasteful  
We should all get together in a lovin machine  
I think Ill call up the queen  
It s only fair that she knows you know you know  
  
What we need is a great big melting pot  
Big enough enough enough to take  
The world and all its got  
And keep it stirring for  
A hundred years or more  
And turn out coffee coloured people by the score  
  
Coffee coloured people  
Coffee coloured people  
Coffee coloured people by the score
