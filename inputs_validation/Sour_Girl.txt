She turned away what was she looking at  
She was a sour girl the day that she met me  
Hey what are you looking at  
She was a happy girl the day that she left me  
  
What would you do  
What would you do if I follow you  
What would you do I follow  
  
Dont turn away what are you looking at  
He was so happy on the day that he met her  
Say what are you looking at  
I was a superman the looks are deceiving  
  
The rollercoaster rides a lonely one  
I pay the ransom note to stop it from steaming  
Hey what are you looking at  
She was a teenage girl when she met me  
  
What would you do  
What would you do if I follow you  
What would you do I follow  
  
What would you do  
  
The girl got reasons  
They all got reasons  
  
What would you do  
  
Hey what are you looking at  
She was a happy girl the day that she left me  
The day that she left me The day that she left me  
She was a happy girl the day that she left me  
The day that she left me The day that she left me  
She was a happy girl the day that she left me
