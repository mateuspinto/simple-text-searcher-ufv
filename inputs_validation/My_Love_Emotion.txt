Here I am slave to my routine  
Here I am longing to fly  
Like a bird heading for summer  
Like a child questioning why  
A feeling inside  
That wont be denied  
Set me free My Love Emotion  
Make me feel I am alive  
Lift me up My Love Emotion  
Burn my soul give me your song  
Wake up my heart My Love Emotion shine on  
Here I am on the horizon  
Mountains high sharing the blue  
Thats my face there in the windscreen  
Staring back thinking of you  
Somewhere to hold  
Somewhere to love  
Set me free My Love Emotion  
Make me feel I am alive  
Lift me up My Love Emotion  
Burn my soul gentle and strong  
Wake up my heart  
Where has all the love gone  
Where is all the good evening news  
Where has all the love gone  
Where is all the passion and truth  
So easy to lose  
Let Love Emotion shine through  
Put words in my mouth  
Straight from my heart  
Set me free My Love Emotion  
Make me feel I am alive  
Lift me up My Love Emotion  
Burn my soul give me your Emotion  
Set me free My Love Emotion  
Make me feel I am alive  
Lift me up My Love Emotion  
Burn my soul gentle and strong  
Wake up my heart My Love Emotion shine on
