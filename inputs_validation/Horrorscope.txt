Critical moments pass  
And doctrines of fools will last  
I am just trying to cope  
Into my horroscope  
  
Through eyes and ears they bleed  
Reciting their holy creed  
Heeding but one request  
The future is put to rest  
  
Bless me in darkened days  
Down to my knees I pray  
I am just trying to cope  
Within this horrorscope  
In the wake of all frustration  
I begin to loose control  
  
Watched as the weapons fired  
Bombs burst in the air  
Burned in the fields of fire  
  
Standing in the middle of nowhere  
Watched as the weapons fired  
Baptized in fields of fire  
  
Well  
The change in here an the future clear  
I can feel it coming  
So full of hate its geting late  
Yeah I know its coming  
When all the choice turned to just one voice  
Yeah the wind is turning  
  
This is your horrorscope  
  
Words laced with blasphemy  
Drip with sincerity  
Falling into the plan  
Like sacrificial lambs  
  
Hearing the words and said  
Rings like nail to the head  
Now I can see the stars  
I know we have gone too far  
  
Baptized in fields of fire  
Watched as the weapons fired  
  
This is your horoscope
