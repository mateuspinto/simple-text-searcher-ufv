Christy Brown  
A clown around town  
Now man of renown  
From Dingle to Down  
I can type with me toes  
Suck stout through me nose  
And where its gonna end  
God only knows  
Down all the days  
The taptaptapping of the typewriter pays  
The gentle rattling of the drays  
Down all the days  
I have often had to depend upon  
The kindness of strangers  
But Ive never been asked and I never replied  
If I supported the Glasgow Rangers  
And down all the days  
The taptaptapping of the typewriter pays  
The gentle rattling of the drays  
Down all the days  
Down all the days  
The taptaptapping of the typewriter pays  
The gentle rattling of the drays  
And down all the days
