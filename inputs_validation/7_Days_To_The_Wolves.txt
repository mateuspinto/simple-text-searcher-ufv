The wolves my love will come  
Taking us home where dust once was a man  
Is there life before a death  
Do we long too much  
And never let in  
  
Chorus  
Howl Seven days to the wolves  
Where will we be when they come  
Seven days to the poison  
And a place in heaven  
Time drawing near us  
They come to take us  
  
This is my church of choice  
Last drinks and death in last sacrifice  
For the rest I have to say to you  
I will dream like the god  
And suffer like all the dead children  
  
Chorus  
  
This is where heroes and cowards part ways  
  
Light the fire feast  
Chase the ghosts give in  
Take the road less traveled by  
Leave the city of fools  
Turn every poet loose  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Hero  
Coward  
No more
