Hey I never met a girl like you before  
Yeah I never met a girl like you before  
Girls like you are very hard to find  
  
Hey I never met a girl that I could miss  
Yeah I never met a girl that I could kiss  
Girls like you are very hard to find  
  
When I kiss you  
I kiss your lovely lips  
When I hold you  
You got one hand I want to hold  
  
Girl I never met a girl like you before  
Yeah I never met a girl like you before  
Girls like you are very hard to find  
  
Hey I never met a girl like you before  
Yeah I never met a girl like you before  
Girls like you are very hard to find  
To find to find youre mine
