You were my adored one  
Then you became the bored one  
And I was like a toy that brought you joy one day  
A broken toy that you preferred to throw away  
If I expected love when first we kissed  
Blame it on my youth  
If only just for you I did exist  
Blame it on my youth  
I believed in everything  
Like a child of three  
You meant more than anything  
All the world to me  
If you were on my mind both night and day  
Blame it on my youth  
If I forgot to eat and sleep and pray  
Blame it on my youth  
And if I cried a little bit when first I learned the truth  
Dont blame it on my heart  
Blame it on my youth
