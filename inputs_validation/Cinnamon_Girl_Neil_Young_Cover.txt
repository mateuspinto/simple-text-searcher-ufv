I wanna live with a cinnamon girl  
I could be happy the rest of my life  
With a cinnamon girl  
A dreamer of pictures  
  
I run in the night  
You see us together  
Chasing the moonlight  
My cinnamon girl  
  
Ten silver saxes a bass with a bow  
The drummer relaxes and waits between shows  
For his cinnamon girl  
A dreamer of pictures  
  
I run in the night  
You see us together  
Chasing the moonlight  
My cinnamon girl  
  
Pa sent me money now  
Im gonna make it somehow  
I need another chance  
You see your baby loves to dance  
Yeah yeah yeah
