Yesterday when we were getting high you were invited  
You wouldve liked it II know you all too well  
I said that we could kiss the past goodbye  
But you werent excited theres no way to fight it  
You can stay but shawty here I go  
  
Uh should I spend the weekend in Vegas  
Im living inside a moment not taking pictures to save it  
I mean how could I forget My memories never faded  
I cant relate to these haters my enemies never made it  
I am still here with who I started with  
The game needed life I put my heart in it  
I blew myself up Im on some martyr shit  
Carried the weight for my city like a cargo ship  
Uh Im 23 with a money tree  
Growing more too I just planted a hundred seeds  
Its ironic cause my mother was a florist  
And thats how she met my pops and now my garden is enormous  
Its happening Penny Lane just like you said  
I avoided the Coke game and went with Sprite instead  
Uh huh thats word to the millions that they putting up  
Im trying to do better than good enough  
  
Chorus  
What am I afraid of This is suppose to be what dreams are made of  
But people I dont have the time to hang with  
Always look at me and say the same shit they say  
You promised me you would never change  
You promised me you would never change  
  
Uh Am I wrong for making light of my situation Clap on  
When 40 got some shit for me to snap on  
Now that Im on I dont really want to worry about getting back on  
Im just trying to stay on get my fucking buffet on  
I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home  
And I be acting like I dont know how to work a phone  
But hit redial you see that I just called some chick I met at the mall  
That I barley know at all and  
Plus this woman that I messed with unprotected  
Texting saying that she wish she wouldve kept it  
The one that Im laying next to just looked over and read it  
Man I couldnt tell you where the fuck my head is  
Im holding on by a thread its  
Like Im high right now the guy right now  
And you can tell by looking in my eyes right now  
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now  
cause we just having the time of our lives right now  
  
Chorus  
  
Well all right Uh I live by some advices girl Lisa told me  
The other day Lisa told that she missed the old me  
Which made me question when I went missing  
And when I start treating my friends different  
Maybe it was the fast paced switch up  
Or the two guns in my face during the stick up  
Maybe cause the girl I thought I trusted was who set the whole shit up  
Or the fact I havent seen em since they locked Big Rich up  
I know At the same time Im quick to forget  
Im bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets  
Burn it all burn it all Im starting it fresh  
Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed  
Did I just trade free time for camera time  
Will I blow all of this money baby Hammer Time  
I just need some closure  
Aint no turning back for me Im in till its over
