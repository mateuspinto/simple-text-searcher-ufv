When I was young we used to play the game called hide and seek  
Someoned go hide Id count to ten  
You probably never played instead you talked a game of sheep  
A skill you almost do perfect  
  
Run pig run  
Here I come  
  
Woo hoo hoo run  
Woo hoo hoo run  
Woo hoo hoo run  
  
I am no saint and make no claims to being in the right  
Its just for now I am wrong less  
Youre probably wondering with what to do this has with you  
I wanna play the game you missed  
  
Run pig run  
Here I come  
  
There is no safe place  
There is no safe place  
There is no safe place to hide  
  
Woo hoo hoo run  
Woo hoo hoo run  
Woo hoo hoo run
