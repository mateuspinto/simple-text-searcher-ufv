the futility of war  
Oh I was born your only son  
And I will think of you  
Before this day is done  
The fires of hell surround me now  
So I must fight for freedom  
Against their raging guns  
In all my life I never said  
How much I loved you  
In all this time  
I never really said I cared  
This war is wrong and so  
I write these words  
Before I give my life to the somme  
In all my life I never said  
How much I loved you  
In all this time  
I never really knew you  
The fires of hell surround me oh  
The guns of hell will  
Take my breath away  
From my life this day  
The fires of hell surround me oh  
The words I say  
Must never disappear  
Keep them locked inside your heart  
I can hear the pipers song  
And it will play for me  
Before this day is done  
So I will hold my head up high  
If I must give my life  
To stop their raging guns  
Oh I was born your only son  
And I thank God for that and  
That that will be done
