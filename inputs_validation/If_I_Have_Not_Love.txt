Jesus I could sing  
In the tongues of men and angels  
But if I have not love  
I am just a clanging cymbal and empty sound  
2x  
Chorus  
This is a love song  
This is a love song  
Jesus a love song to You  
A song of devotion a reverent passion  
Savior a love song to You  
Jesus I could pray  
With a faith that moves a mountain  
But if I have not love  
It is just a noise resounding an empty sound  
2x  
Chorus 2x  
This is a love song to You  
Hear our devotion  
Chorus  
Its the overflow of hearts  
As we gaze upon Your beauty  
A reflection of Your worth  
For weve seen a glimpse of You in Your glory Lord
