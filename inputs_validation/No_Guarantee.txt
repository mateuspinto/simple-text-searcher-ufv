No guarantee  
Is what Im getting today  
Appetites so rampant  
And theyre demanding money  
Everybody wants a good time  
Yeah yeah yeah  
And wild terms to agree  
No credit taken  
Oh oh oh whoa whoa whoa whoa  
No guarantee  
  
No guarantee  
When we kiss  
Your lips are tempting  
Well baby listen to this  
Gotta have some action  
Yeah yeah yeah  
You know I got to be free  
Contracts are binding  
Oh oh oh whoa whoa whoa whoa  
No guarantee  
  
Guarantee my baby  
Guarantee my love  
  
Guarantee me for a month of good Sundays  
Promise me every single onell be fun days  
Give me a dime for every party revolution  
Launder my debts in paragorical solution  
Even the boss has been slandered and slagged  
Now hes sitting in the alley  
With a bottle in a paper bag  
  
No guarantee  
When we play  
Turn the house lights up Bob  
Fellas look over day  
This hall is empty  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Up to seventeen B  
But whats depressing  
Oh oh oh whoa whoa whoa whoa  
No guarantee  
  
Guarantee me  
Guarantee baby  
Guarantee my love  
Oh guarantee when youre coming in me  
You got a rubber on baby  
Guarantee when I love you for free  
Im gonna pay one day  
Oh guarantee  
When you sock it to me  
When you punch it to me  
When you hook it to me  
When you knock it to me  
When you talk it to me  
You guarantee my love  
Oh
