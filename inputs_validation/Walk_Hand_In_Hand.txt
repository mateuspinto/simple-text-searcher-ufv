WALK HAND IN HAND  
WRITER JOHNNY COWELL  
Walk hand in hand with me through all eternity Have faith believe in me give
me your hand Love is a symphony of perfect harmony When lovers such as we walk
hand in hand Be not afraid for I am with you all the while So lift your head
up high and look toward the sky Walk hand in hand with me this is our destiny
No greater love could be walk hand in hand Walk with me instrumental
interlude Be not afraid for I am with you all the while So lift your head up
high and look up to the sky Walk hand in hand with me this is our destiny No
greater love could be walk hand in hand Walk with me
