We ran through the summer fields  
Between the earth and sky  
Little did we realize  
We were flying you and I  
We sang to the stars above  
We praised the earth below  
You fell into my arms that night  
And Ive never let you go  
It was beautiful glorious  
We were riding on a wave  
With foolish hearts and foolish love  
We would give ourselves away  
Remember how we cried out loud  
Heard angry voices shout  
I love you as I loved you then  
No danger and no doubt  
It was beautiful glorious  
We were riding on a wave  
With foolish hearts and foolish love  
We would give ourselves away  
And now as we look behind  
To see the road of life  
Turning to the ones we love  
Salvation is in sight  
Cause it was beautiful glorious  
We were riding on a wave  
With foolish hearts and foolish love  
We would give ourselves away  
Remember how we cried out loud  
Heard angry voices shout  
I love you as I loved you then  
No danger and no doubt
