I climbed the hill lay in the grass  
A little darkeyed girl drifted past  
She said all the best is come it could not last  
And the worst it has come true  
  
  
Her hands are small and fluttered up  
I lay amongst the buttercups  
I pulled on my coat and buttoned it up  
For the worst it had come true  
  
  
Sail away sail away  
To a place where your troubles cant follow  
Sail away sail away  
Save all your tears for tomorrow  
  
  
Orphans of the city moved toward us  
And the swallows swooped and the starlings warned us  
And the peril in everything  
It assured us that the worst had come true  
  
  
And all my sorrows made their bed beside me  
The shame the disgrace and the brutality  
And she whispered then Let laughter flee  
For the worst it has come true  
  
  
Dry your tears forget while were here  
Leave all your sorrows behind you  
Never lose heart all things will pass  
To a place where your troubles cant find you  
  
  
She came beside me amongst my coat  
Her breath was warm against my throat  
We clung to each other so very close  
For the worst it had come true  
  
  
Sail away sail away  
To a place where your heart will not shame you  
Take my hand through this night without end  
For the worst it has come to claim you  
  
  
Sail away sail away  
To a place where no one can betray you  
Take my hand through this night without end  
For the worst it has come to claim you
