The winds of the heart  
They are as fickle as the weather  
The winds of the heart  
They are as constant as the moon  
They blow us apart  
And just as quickly turn  
And blow us together again  
And we dont know how  
And we cant say when  
No we cant say when  
The workings of time  
They are the face of love in motion  
The workings of time  
They are as secret as the sea  
It seems such a crime  
We should waste our love  
Deciding whose fault it should be  
We it might be yours  
But it might be me  
Oh it might be me  
Well they say that love is jealous  
And they say that love is blind  
And they say that love is  
Always in a hurry  
But the face of loves forgiving  
And the face of love is kind  
And the grace of love is there  
For all to find  
The winds of the heart  
They are as fickle as the weather  
The winds of the heart  
They are as constant as the moon  
They blow us apart  
And just as quickly turn  
And blow us together again  
And we dont know how  
And we cant say when  
No we cant say when  
They say that love is jealous  
And they say that love is blind  
And they say that love is  
Always in a hurry  
But the face of loves forgiving  
And the face of love is kind  
And the grace of love is there  
For all to find  
Well they say that love is jealous  
And they say that love is blind  
And they say that love is  
Always in a hurry  
But the face of loves forgiving  
And the face of love is kind  
And the grace of love is there  
For all to find
