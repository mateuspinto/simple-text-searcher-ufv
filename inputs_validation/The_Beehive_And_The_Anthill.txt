Here is the beehive  
Hold fisted right hand outward  
  
Where are the bees  
Hidden away where nobody sees  
  
Soon they come buzzing  
Out of the hive  
One Two Three Four Five  
Extend fingers one at a time  
  
Once I saw an anthill  
Hold fisted left hand outward  
  
With no ants about  
So I said Oh little ants  
Wont you please come out   
  
And then as if by magic  
It seemed they heard my call  
Cause One Two Three Four Five came out  
Extend fingers one at a time  
And that was all
