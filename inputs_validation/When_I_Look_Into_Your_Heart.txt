Chorus  
When I look into your heart  
I see us holding each other  
I can finally see forever  
When I look into your heart  
  
Ive seen the moon dance on the waters  
Watched the morning sun slip through the trees  
Bu tthe sight of you is the vision  
That takes me to my knees  
  
Chorus  
  
Ive never known such comfort  
Ive never felt such release  
Ive never felt so connected  
Ive never known such peace  
  
Chorus  
  
I can finally see forever  
When I look into your heart
