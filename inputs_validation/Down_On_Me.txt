Please dont fight me baby  
This silence has got to stop  
You used to want to know my mind  
But now I even hate to bring that up  
You get so down  
Down on me  
  
All these nights I rocked you  
Didnt I lay it on you enough  
I always give you something wild  
And sweet  
But its hard to keep it up  
When you get so down  
Down on me  
  
Gently I want to dance you darlin  
Breathin breathe it in slowly groovin  
Wrapped around in sweet sweet chains  
Feel the romance when we move  
  
You know I cant resist  
I got a need for you  
Please baby reach into your kindest mind  
Tell me what I am going to do  
If it all comes down  
Down on me
