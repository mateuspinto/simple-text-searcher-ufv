If we seek solace in the prisons of the distant past  
Security in human systems were told will always always last  
Emotions are the sail and blind faith is the mast  
Without the breath of real freedom were getting nowhere fast  
  
If God is dead and an actor plays his part  
His words of fear will find a place in your heart  
Without the voice of reason every faith is its own curse  
Without freedom from the past things can only get worse  
  
Sooner or later just like the world first day  
Sooner or later we learn to throw the past away  
Sooner or later just like the world first day  
Sooner or later we learn to throw the past away  
Sooner or later we learn to throw the past away  
  
History will teach us nothing  
History will teach us nothing  
  
Our written history is a catalog of crime  
The sordid and the powerful the architects of time  
The mother of invention the oppression of the mild  
The constant fear of scarcity aggression as its child  
  
Sooner or later  
Sooner or later  
Sooner or later  
Sooner or later  
  
Convince an enemy convince him that hes wrong  
Is to win a bloodless battle where victory is long  
A simple act of faith  
In reason over might  
To blow up his children will only prove him right  
History will teach us nothing  
Sooner or later just like the world first day  
Sooner or later we learn to throw the past away  
Sooner or later just like the world first day  
Sooner or later we learn to throw the past away  
Sooner or later we learn to throw the past away  
  
History will teach us nothing  
History will teach us nothing
