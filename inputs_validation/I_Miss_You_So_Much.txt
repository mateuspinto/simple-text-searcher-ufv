I never asked for this feeling  
I never thought I would fall  
I never knew how I felt  
Till the day you were gone  
I was lost  
I never asked for red roses  
I wasnt looking for love  
Somehow I let my emotions take hold  
And guess what all at once  
Im in love  
  
Chorus  
Oh I miss you so much  
I long for your love  
Its scares me  
Cause my heart gets so weak  
That I cant even breathe  
How can you take things so easily  
Baby why arent you missing me  
  
Why did I act like you mattered  
It was silly of me to believe  
That if I just opened my heart  
Things would come naturally  
Jokes on me yeah  
I did not ask for love letters  
So why did you give them to me  
How could I let your intentions  
Get hold over me  
So in love  
So naive oh baby  
  
Chorus  
  
And oh how I hate what you have done  
Made me fall so deep in love  
Got no cure  
Youre the only one I want  
That I love oh baby  
  
Chorus  
  
Baby why arent you missing me  
Baby why arent you missing me
