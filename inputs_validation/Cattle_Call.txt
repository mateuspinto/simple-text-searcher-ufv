Leann  
yodeling  
The cattle are prowlin  
The coyotes are howlin  
Way out where the doggies roam  
Where spurs are a jinglin  
And the cowboy is singing  
His lonesome cattle call  
yodeling  
  
He rides in the sun  
til his days work is done  
And he rounds up the cattle each fall  
yodeling  
Singing his cattle call  
  
Eddy  
For hours he would ride  
On the range far and wide  
When the night wind blows up and slow  
His heart is a feather  
In all kinds of weather  
He sings his cattle call  
yodeling  
  
Hes browned as a fairy  
From ridin the prairie  
And he sings with an western drawl  
Singing his cattle call  
  
Leann and eddy  
yodeling
