No one ever thought this one would survive  
Helpless child gonna walk a drum beat behind  
Lock you in a dream never let you go  
Never let you laugh or smile not you  
  
Well I just want to walk right out of this world  
Cause everybody has a poison heart  
I just want to walk right out of this world  
Cause everybody has a poison heart  
  
Making friends with a homeless torn up man  
He just kind of smiles it really shakes me up  
Theres danger on every corner but Im okay  
Walking down the street trying to forget yesterday  
  
Well I just want to walk right out of this world  
Cause everybody has a poison heart  
I just want to walk right out of this world  
Cause everybody has a poison heart  
A poison heart a poison heart a poison heart  yeah  
  
You know that life really takes its toll  
And a poets gut reaction is to search his very soul  
So much damn confusion before my eyes  
But nothing seems to phase me and this one still survives  
  
I just want to walk right out of this world  
Cause everybody has a poison heart  
I just want to walk right out of this world  
Cause everybody has a poison heart  
Well I just want to walk right out of this world  
Cause everybody has a poison heart  
A poison heart a poison heart a poison heart  
A poison heart a poison heart a poison heart
