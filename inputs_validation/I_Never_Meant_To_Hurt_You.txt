I never meant to hurt you  
Im not that way at all  
Please believe the words of the heart  
A heart that seems so small  
And I swear I never meant to hurt you  
I guess I lost my place  
Please believe the wards of the heart  
A heart that hides its fails  
  
Why do I do things  
I never mean to do  
Oh why did I speak so carelessly  
When all that i felt  
Was love for you  
  
And I swear I never  
I never meant to hurt you  
Ive got to make you know  
Please believe the words of the heart  
A heart that didnt show  
I never meant to hurt you  
I only meant to love you  
Its true  
And when I saw you crying  
I cried too
