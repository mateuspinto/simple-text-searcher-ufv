Its at times such as this shed be tempted to spit  
If she wasnt so ladylike  
She imagines how she might have lived  
Back when legends and history collide  
So she looks to her prince finding hes so charmingly  
Slumped at her side  
Those days are recalled on the gallery wall  
And shes waiting for passion or humor to strike  
  
What shall we do what shall we do with all this useless beauty  
All this useless beauty  
  
Good Friday arrived the sky darkened on time  
Till he almost began to negotiate  
She held his head like a baby and said its okay if you cry  
Now he wants her to dress as if you couldnt guess  
He desires to impress his associates  
But hes part ugly beast and Hellenic deceased  
So she finds that the mixture is hard to deny  
  
Chorus  
She wont practice the looks from the great tragic books  
That were later disgraced to face celluloid  
It wont even make sense but you can bet  
If she isnt a sweetheart or plaything or pet  
The film turns her into an unveiled threat  
  
Nonsense prevails modesty fails  
Grace and virtue turn into stupidity  
While the calendar fades almost all barricades to a pale compromise  
And our leaders have feasts on the backsides of beasts  
They still think theyre the gods of antiquity  
If something you missed didnt even exist  
It was just an ideal is it such a surprise  
  
Chorus x 2
