Take  
Rob this world of resource  
Burn the oil for fortune  
Stealing from our savior  
In quest of power  
  
Sealed  
Our fate is catastrophic  
The coming days of failure  
Aborting evolution  
In quest of power  
  
Take all you want and these bloody skies will reign  
Take whats hers and these blood skies will reign  
Oh mother close your eyes  
  
These bloody skies will reign  
Dear savior brace your heart  
These bloody skies will reign  
  
Blackened lives  
Sunsless skies  
Our bare world weeps  
Black hearts how reign  
Blasphemous corruption  
Controlling progression  
Our bare world weeps  
Black hearts now reign  
  
In solitude a lonely voice is heard  
This future of despair is easy to avoid  
This future of despair is easy to avoid  
Lies strangle this world hope  
In quest of power
