He was the king of the zoo king of the zoo  
Yes he was oh he was  
Ooooh ooooh  
Facing his crowd his head high and proud  
While they threw breadcrumbs laughing through their gums  
doodoodoodoodoo  
He was the king of the zoo king of the zoo  
Yes he was oh he was  
Ooooh ooooh  
When the gates was closed at night  
And no one was in sight  
He would pace around what was called his ground  
Dreaming of the land in his minds eye  
Roaring roaring to the dark sky  
He was a show show stopper  
A mind mind topper  
He was a dreamer he was a dreamer he was a king  
Yes he was yes he was oh he was oh he was  
Ooooh that he was  
Show stopper mind topper  
Show stopper mind topper  
Show stopper mind topper  
Show stopper mind topper  
Show stopper mind topper
