I got a friend in Fremont  
He sells used cars ya know  
Well he calls me up twice a year  
Just ask me howd it go  
Pretty good not bad I cant complain  
Actually everything is just about the same  
I met a girl from Venus and her insides were lined in gold  
Well she did what she did said How was it kid  
She was politely told  
Pretty good not bad I cant complain  
But actually everything is just about the same  
Moonlight makes me dizzy  
Sunlight makes me clean  
Your light is the sweetest thing  
That this boy has ever seen  
Molly went to Arkansas she got raped by Dobbins dog  
Well she was doing good till she went in the woods  
And got pinned up against a log  
Pretty good not bad she cant complain  
Cause actually all them dogs is just about the same  
Moonlight makes me dizzy  
Sunlight makes me clean  
Your light is the sweetest thing  
That this boy has ever seen  
I heard Allah and Buddha were singing at the Saviors feast  
And up the sky and Arabian rabbi  
Fed Quaker oats to a priest  
Pretty good not bad they cant complain  
Cause actually all them gods is just about the same  
Pretty good not bad I cant complain  
Cause actually everything is just about the same
