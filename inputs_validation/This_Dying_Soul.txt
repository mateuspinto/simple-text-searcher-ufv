Hello Mirror  
so glad to see you my friend its been a while  
Searching Fearless  
where do I begin to heal this wound of selfdenial  
  
Face yourself man  
Brace yourself and trace your hell back  
  
Youve been  
Blinded  
Living lie a one way  
Cold existence  
All the while  
Now its  
Time to  
Stare the problem right between  
The eyes  
You long lost child  
  
I want to feel your body breaking  
Want to feel your body breaking  
And shaking  
And left in the cold  
I want to heal your conscience making  
A change to fix this dying soul  
This Dying Soul  
  
Born into this world a broken home  
Surrounded by love yet all alone  
Forced into a life thats split in two  
A mother and a father both pulling you  
Then you had to deal with loss and death  
Everybody thinking they know best  
Coping with this shit at such an age  
Can only fill a kid with pain and rage  
Family disease pumped through your blood  
Never had the chance you thought you could  
Running all the while with no escape  
Turning all that pain in to blame and hate  
Living on your own by twenty one  
Not a single care and having fun  
Consuming all the life in front of you  
Burning out the fuse and smoking the residue  
  
Possessive obsessions  
Selfish childish games  
Vengeful resentments  
Passing all the blame  
  
Living out a life of decadence  
Acing without thought of consequence  
Spreading all your lies from coast to coast  
While spitting on the ones that matter most  
Running power mad with no control  
Fighting for the credit they once stole  
No one can ever tell you what to do  
Ruling others lives while the cant stand the thought of you  
  
A living reflection  
Seen from miles away  
A hopeless affliction  
Having run astray  
  
I want to feel your body breaking  
Want to feel your body breaking  
And shaking  
And left in the cold  
I want to heal your conscience making  
A change to fix this dying soul  
This Dying Soul  
  
Now that you can see  
All you have done  
Its time to take that step  
Into the kingdom  
All your sins will  
Only make you strong  
And help you break right  
Through the prison wall  
  
Come to me my friend  
Listen to me  
Ill help this torture end  
Help to set me free  
Let your ego go  
I cant carry this load  
You cant go through this alone  
I feel so hopeless and exposed  
Youll find your peace of mind  
Give me some direction  
You can no longer hide  
Break out of this isolation  
Let humility  
Openness honesty  
And become what you can be  
A healing tranquility  
  
Help me  
Save me  
Heal me  
I cant break out of this prison all alone  
  
These tormenting ghosts of yesterday  
Will vanish when exposed  
You cant hold onto your secrets  
Theyll only send you back alone  
  
Your fearless admissions  
Will help expel your destructive obsessions  
With my help I know you can  
Be at one with God and man  
  
Hear me  
Believe me  
Take me  
Im ready to break right through this prison wall
