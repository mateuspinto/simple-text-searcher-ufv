Down to the Banana Republics  
Down to the tropical sun  
Go the expatriated American  
Hopin to find some fun  
  
Some of them go for the sailing  
Brought by the lure of the sea  
Tryin to find what is ailing  
Living in the land of the free  
Some of them are running to lovers  
Leaving no forward address  
Some of them are running tons of ganja  
Some are running from the IRS  
  
Late at night you will find them  
In the cheap hotels and bars  
Hustling the senoritas  
While they dance beneath the stars  
Spending those renegade pesos  
On a bottle of rum and a lime  
Singin give me some words I can dance to  
Or a melody that rhymes  
  
First you learn the native custom  
Soon a word of Spanish or two  
You know that you cannot trust them  
Cause they know they cant trust you  
  
Expatriated American feelin so all alone  
Telling themselves the same lies  
That they told themselves back home  
  
Down to the Banana Republics  
Things arent as warm as they seem  
None of the natives are buying  
Any second hand American dreams  
  
Late at night you will find them  
In the cheap hotels and bars  
Hustling the senoritas  
While they dance beneath the stars  
Spending those renegade pesos  
On a bottle of rum and a lime  
Singing give me some words I can dance to  
Or a melody that rhymes  
  
Down to the Banana Republics  
Down to the tropical sun  
Go the expatriated Americans  
Hopin to find some fun
