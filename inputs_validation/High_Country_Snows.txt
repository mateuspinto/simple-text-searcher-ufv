Theres a place in the Rockies  
A place that I know  
Where the world cannot find me  
And the time goes so slow  
In the piney wood forest  
Theres a flower that grows  
Through the long months of winter  
And the high country snows  
  
To a house by a meadow  
Neath the towering peaks  
Is a place where my heart goes  
When its love that it seeks  
There a woman lies waiting  
Like the wild growing rose  
Through the long months of winter  
And the high country snows  
  
In the space of a lifetime  
A man misses much  
Till he finds him a woman  
And treasures her touch  
When the lakes all are frozen  
And the wild wind blows  
Ill return to my darlin  
And the high country snows  
Ill return to my darlin  
And the high country snows
