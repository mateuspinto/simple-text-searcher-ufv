I got a good thing  
I got a good thing  
I got a good thing  
I got a good thing  
I got a good thing  
I got a good thing going  
Take the sun and take the moon  
And stars that shine so bright  
All I need is my guy  
And everythings all right  
Everything about him thrills me  
The way he looks at me just kills me  
Hes got a way of getting to me  
Every kiss just goes right through me  
I got a good thing  
I got a good thing  
I got a good thing  
You know I got a good thing baby  
I got a good thing  
I got a good thing going  
Take the rainbow from the sky  
Oh I dont really care  
I will have a pot of gold  
As long as he is there  
I never knew such sweet affection  
And its all in my direction  
If he left theres no mistaking  
My poor heart would start to break and  
I got a good thing  
I got a good thing  
I got a good thing  
You know I got a good thing going yeah  
You know I got a good thing yeah  
I got a good thing  
I got a good thing yeah  
I got a good thing  
You know I got a good thing going  
I got a good thing  
You know I got a sweet thing baby  
I got a good thing  
Everything is everything baby  
I got a good thing  
Everything is uptight all right out of sight  
I got a good thing  
Know I got a ooh oh sweet sweet thing  
I got a good thing  
Sweet mmm  
I got a good thing
