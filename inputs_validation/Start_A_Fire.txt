come lay down with me tonight  
we can start a fire here and  
ill be wrong and youll be right  
we can start a fire here  
  
and watch you climb these walls walls  
our bodies create the flames and  
loves blaze conquers all all  
close your eyes and take me as i sing  
  
come lay down with me tonight  
we can start a fire here and  
ill be wrong and youll be right  
we can start a fire here  
  
tonight x 4  
  
watch the flames just stay  
when i kiss you sparks light up this night  
girl take my hand  
squeeze it as i enter you singing  
  
come lay down with me tonight  
we can start a fire here and  
ill be wrong and youll be right  
we can start a fire here  
  
tonight x 4  
  
your body  
my body  
together  
  
so well start a fire here tonight  
  
your body  
my body  
together  
  
so well start a fire here tonight  
  
come lay down with me tonight  
we can start a fire here and  
ill be wrong and youll be right  
we can start a fire here  
  
tonight
