When Romes in ruins  
We are the lions free of the coliseums  
In poison places we are empty venom  
Were the beginning of the end  
  
Tonight the foxes hunt the hounds  
Its all over now  
Before it has begun  
Weve already won  
  
We are wild  
We are like young volcanoes  
We are wild  
Americana exotica  
Do you wanna feel a little beautiful baby  
  
Come on make it easy say I never mattered  
Run it up the flag pole  
We will teach you how to make boys next door out of assholes  
  
Tonight the foxes hunt the hounds  
And its all over now  
Before it has begun  
Weve already won  
  
We are wild  
We are like young volcanoes  
We are wild  
Americana exotica  
Do you wanna feel a little beautiful baby  
  
We are wild  
We are like young volcanoes  
We are wild  
Americana exotica  
Do you wanna feel a little beautiful baby
