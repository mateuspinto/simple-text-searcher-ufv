My hands  
Were made  
To worship you  
  
My heart  
My king  
It beats  
For you  
  
Oh lamb so true  
I surrender to you  
My life I give you  
My love  I give you  
My all all  
  
Your touch  
Your kiss  
Your grace  
To me  
  
Is deeper than  
My soul  
Can see  
  
My purpose  
It changed  
When I called  
Out your name  
My life I give you  
My love I give you  
My all all  
  
Your touch  
Your kiss  
Your grace  
To me  
  
Is deeper than  
My soul  
Can see  
  
My purpose  
It changed  
When I called  
Out your name  
My life I give you  
My love I give you   
My all  My all all  
  
My past  
My past has been erased  
With just one touch from you  
My clouds my rain  
My pain has changed  
Your blood has made me new  
  
Oh lamb  
So true

And when  
This world  
Has come  
To end  
And paradise  
With you  
Begins  
Well done  
Youll say  
When I see your face  
My life I give you  
My love I give you  
My all My all all  
  
My past  
My past has been erased  
With just one touch from you
