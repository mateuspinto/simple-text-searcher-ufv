I saw you today  
You were too far away  
It had hurt me to say  
Hurt me to say  
The words  
The words I have to say  
  
There aint no sound  
When youre not around  
And it gets me down  
Yeah it gets me down  
My life feels so brown  
  
I just want to be with you  
Thats all I wanna do  
X2  
  
Inside my brain  
Its just not the same  
Cos it started to rain  
Its started to rain  
  
I just want to be with you  
Thats all I wanna do  
X2
