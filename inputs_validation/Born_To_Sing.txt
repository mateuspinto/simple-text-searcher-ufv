Man can be king  
Seems to have everything  
But it comes with a sting  
When you were born to sing  
  
Reason doesnt walk in  
Its not done on a whim  
Passions everything  
When you were born to sing  
  
Feeling good  
Singing the blues  
It aint easy  
Keep on paying dues  
  
When it gets to the part  
Well lets not stop and start  
Deep down in your heart  
You know you were born to sing  
  
When you came in  
No original sin  
You were a king  
Because you were born to sing  
  
Reason doesnt walk in  
Its not done on a whim  
Passions everything  
When you were born to sing  
  
Lord feeling good  
Singing the blues  
Keep on keeping on  
Paying them dues  
  
When it comes to the part  
Well lets not stop and start  
Deep down in your heart  
Baby you were born to sing  
  
When it gets to the part  
When the band starts to swing  
Then you know everything  
cause you were born to sing  
  
When it gets to the part  
When the band starts to swing  
Then you know everything  
cause you were born to sing
