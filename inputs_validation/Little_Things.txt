Me and you and the Sunday paper  
Spread all over the bed  
A rose colored morning light  
All to ourselves  
Hot coffee and the comic strips  
Pillow talk and your fingertips  
Laying down and loving  
Til theres nothing left  
  
Chorus  
Ill take the little things  
The simple pleasures that your sweet love brings  
Ill take the little things with you  
  
Open the window leave that old fan on  
Lay here with me til the sun is gone  
  
Dont say nothin just let the time  
Pass right on by  
I want to hear you breathe  
I want to brush your hair  
I dont care if we go anywhere  
Weve got everything we need  
  
Right here in this room  
  
Chorus  
  
Me and you and the Sunday paper  
Spread all over the bed
