So many questions  
So many answers  
So many reasons  
Most of them wrong  
  
Facing the future  
With the faith of my father  
I let a stranger  
Into my home  
  
And right there before me  
I saw it happen  
Theres no denying  
Nothings the same  
  
The truth is a highway  
Leading to freedom  
All is forgiven  
Love is to blame  
  
Chorus  
And Ive seen him hold her  
With his head on her shoulder  
Singing her love songs  
Soft as her smile  
Tender affection  
Under the rainbow  
Holy Creation  
Mother and child  
  
I know the story  
I read the papers  
I see the anger  
I feel it too  
  
But when I see the wonder  
In the smiles of my children  
It reminds me of dreams  
Worth coming true  
  
Chorus
