Yeah Ya Yeah  
Yeah Ya Yeah Oh  
  
Yeah Hey alright  
I I would dig a hole all the way to China  
Unless of course I was there  
And Id dig my way home  
If by digging I could steal  
The wind from the sails of the greedy men who ruled the world  
Still youre my best friend  
And after a good good drunk  
You and me wake up and make love  
After a deep sleep where I was dreaming  
I was dreaming of a  
  
Dreamgirl  
Dreamgirl  
Dreamgirl Yeah  
Dreamgirl  
  
I was feeling like a creep as I watched you asleep  
Face down in the grass in the park in the middle of hot afternoon  
Your top was untied and I thought how nice itd be to follow the sweat down
your spine  
Youre like my best friend  
Oh after a good good drink  
You and me wake up and make love  
After a deep sleep where I was dreaming  
I was dreaming of a  
  
Dreamgirl yeah  
Dreamgirl  
Dreamgirl yeah  
Dreamgirl  
  
Caught by a wave my back to the ocean  
It knocks me off my feet and  
Just as I find my footing  
Here you come again  
  
Dreamgirl oh  
Dreamgirl mumble man  
The deep end
