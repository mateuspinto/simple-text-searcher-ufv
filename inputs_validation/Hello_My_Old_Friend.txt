Early morning day is dawning  
Cooling towers and factory gates  
Dirty streets and laughing people  
Skinny dogs and beer crates  
  
Hello my old friend  
Hello my old friend  
  
Sad canals green black water  
Somewhere bicycles and beds  
Wet and windy afternoons  
And pigeons coo in garden sheds  
  
Hello my old friend  
Hello my old friend  
  
Highrise tower blocks with panoramic  
Views of trains and coal  
Tiehead railway tracks tread faithfully  
The gas works to behold  
  
Hello my old friend  
Hello my old friend  
  
Just to see the sunset  
Pretty rainbows over your majestic towers  
To feel your earth beneath my feet  
Here I could stand for hours and hours  
  
Young girls sing Fara Jacka in the background  
Big machines that once were champions  
Turn to dust under the sky  
Broken windows choking chimneys  
Factory walls for miles and miles  
  
Bye bye my old friend  
Bye bye my old friend  
  
Just to see the sunset  
Pretty rainbows over your majestic towers  
To feel your earth beneath my feet  
Here I could stand for hours and hours
