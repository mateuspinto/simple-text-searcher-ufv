In the calling out to one another  
Of the lovers up and down the strand  
In the sound of the waves and the cries  
Of the seagulls circling the sand  
  
In the fragments of the songs  
Carried down the wind from some radio  
In the murmuring of the city in the distance  
Ominous and low  
  
I hear the sound of the world where we played  
And the far too simple beauty  
Of the promises we made  
  
If you ever need holding  
Call my name Ill be there  
If you ever need holding  
And no holding back Ill see you through  
Sky blue and black  
  
Where the touch of the lover ends  
And the soul of the friend begins  
Theres a need to be separate and a need to be one  
And a struggle neither wins  
  
Where you gave me the world I was in  
And a place I could make a stand  
I could never see how you doubted me  
When Id let go of your hand  
  
Yeah and I was much younger then  
And I must have thought that I would know  
If things were going to end  
  
And the heavens were rolling  
Like a wheel on a track  
And our sky was unfolding  
And itll never fold back  
Sky blue and black  
  
And Id have fought the world for you  
If I thought that you wanted me to  
Or put aside what was true or untrue  
If Id know thats what you needed  
What you needed me to do  
  
But the moment has passed by me now  
To have put away my pride  
And just come through for you somehow  
  
If you ever need holding  
Call my name Ill be there  
If you ever need holding  
And no holding back Ill see you through  
  
Youre the color of the sky  
Reflected in each storefront window pane  
Youre the whispering and the sighing  
Of my tires in the rain  
  
Youre the hidden cost and the thing thats lost  
In everything I do  
Yeah and Ill never stop looking for you  
In the sunlight and the shadows  
  
And the faces on the avenue  
Thats the way love is  
Thats the way love is  
Thats the way love is  
Sky blue and black
