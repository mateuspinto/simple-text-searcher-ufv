Think that I know you but I just cant place the face  
Got something to show you it can never be replaced  
Wherever we walk wherever we fly  
Wherever we live wherever we die  
Think that I know you but I just cant say goodbye  
  
This is it  
Hey now dont it make you feel better Come and get it  
This is it  
Here we go we going to fly  
Come and get it  
This is it  
Hey now dont it make you feel better Come and get it  
This is it  
Here we go we going high  
Come and get it  
  
Remember the rising when the lightning filled the air  
No compromising in a strapped electric chair you were there  
We never could walk we always could fly  
We never could live we always could die  
Think that I know you but I just cant talk too high  
Think that I know you but I just talk too high  
Over your horse and ride  
  
Do you know a better way to make it all good inside  
All the friends have died away by a new law they abide  
And all Gods children there they go judgement on their side  
Do you know a better way to make it all good inside  
And I cry does it make you feel better sing it  
  
All Gods children there they go taking the free ride
