Believe me if all those endearing young charms  to my mother  
believe me if all those endearing young charms  
Which I gave on so fondly today  
Were to change by tomorrow and fleet in my arms  
Like the fairy gifts fading away  
Though would still be adored as this moment thou art  
Let thy loveliness fade as it will  
And around the dear ruin each wish of my heart  
Would entwine itself verdantly still  
It is not while beauty and youth are thine own  
And thy cheeks unprofaned by a tear  
That the fervour and faith of a soul can be known  
To which time will but make thee more dear  
No the heart which has truly loved never forgets  
But as truly loves on to the close  
As the sunflower turns on her guard when he sets  
The same look which she turned when he rose
