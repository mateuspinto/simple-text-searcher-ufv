Life lines and suicide crimes   
He found me in a state  
Grabbed my purse and hitched a ride  
With a Mrs Jesus how you been  
Ive been cruisin a good invention  
But in some ways  
I dont think it gets any easier  
Your walking on the water  
Bit by far my favorite one  
But now it seems were drowning  
In a drop of water love  
And even as Im climbing up the stairs  
I know theres heaven there  
And then empty arms that comes  
With the morning star  
Well made my bed of  
Cut roses by understanding  
That the cause  
It just comes first  
With my Mrs Jesus  
The gospel changes meaning  
If you follow John or Paul  
And could you ever let it be  
The Mary of it all  
And even as Im climbing up the stairs  
Well life lines and suicide crimes  
Theres the something every day  
And theres someone always paging  
My Mrs Jesus  
Your walking on the water  
So if you get the Jones at the crossroad  
The personals are great  
If youre my way  
Let me love you Mrs Jesus
