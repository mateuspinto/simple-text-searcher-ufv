So I lay awake another hour  
Just like the one before  
The shadows play a game with my head  
I cant take this anymore  
  
I hear the sound  
Of my own breathing  
It makes me miss you more  
  
Chorus  
Wake me up when its over  
After the ending  
When the damage has all been done  
I dont wanna be somewhere  
Where you can watch me as I bleed  
Just leave me here in pieces  
In pieces  
  
I cant take the chance  
Of running into  
You running into me  
So lock the door  
And close the window  
I just wanna see  
  
Until the day  
Inside my future  
When Ill be on my feet  
  
Chorus  
  
If you want you can find me  
On the dark side of the sun  
Babe I dont wanna see what weve become  
The damage has all been done  
  
Wake me up when its over  
After the ending  
Wake me up when its over  
When the damage has all been done  
The damage is done  
I dont wanna be somewhere  
I dont wanna be somewhere  
Where you can watch me as I bleed  
Leave me here in pieces  
Just leave me in pieces  
Just leave me in pieces  
Just wake me up when its over in pieces  
Just wake me up when its over
