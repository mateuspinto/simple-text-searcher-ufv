I always used to be afraid  
That I was going to lose my way  
I never used to walk in line but stray  
  
I never thought Id see it through  
That I could deal with losing you  
But suddenly I see the light of day  
  
Leading me in  
From out of the night  
Staying on course Im still alive  
I had to confess I never thought I would ever survive  
  
I was lost and found  
I had run aground  
I was lost but now Im found  
  
Focused on my altered state  
I would just disorientate  
Suffering alone amongst the crowd  
  
Drifting on a sea of doubt  
And no one ever heard me shout  
That I was lost and couldnt find my way  
  
No one at hand  
Having no plan  
Stumbled through a barren land  
  
After so long  
Of going wrong  
I found the road  
  
I was lost and found  
I had run aground  
I was lost but now Im found  
  
I was lost and found  
I had hit the ground  
I was lost but now I found  
  
That I dont need no one  
To survive  
Youve got to believe alone  
Youll rise  
  
Starting to run  
Shedding the load  
Now I can see Im close to home  
  
After so long  
Of going wrong  
I found the road  
  
I was lost and found  
I had run aground  
I was lost but now Im found
