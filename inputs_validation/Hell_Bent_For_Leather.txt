Seek him here seek him on the highway  
Never knowing when hell appear  
All await engines ticking over  
Hear the roar as they sense the fear  
  
Wheels A glint of steel and a flash of light  
Screams From a streak of fire as he strikes  
  
Hell bent hell bent for leather  
Hell bent hell bent for leather  
  
Black as night faster than a shadow  
Crimson flare from a raging sun  
An exhibition of sheer precision  
Yet no one knows from where he comes  
  
Fools Self destruct cannot take that crown  
Dreams Crash one by one to the ground  
  
Hell bent hell bent for leather  
Hell bent hell bent for leather  
  
Theres many who tried to prove that theyre faster  
But they didnt last and they died as they tried  
  
Theres many who tried to prove that theyre faster  
But they didnt last and they died as they tried  
  
Hell bent hell bent for leather  
Hell bent hell bent for leather  
Hell bent hell bent for leather  
Hell bent hell bent for leather
