Wheres the orchestra  
Wasnt this supposed to be a musical  
Here I am  
In the balcony  
How the hell could I have missed the overture  
  
I like the scenery  
Even though I have absolutely no idea at all  
What is being said despite the dialogue  
Theres the leading man  
  
The movie star who never faced an audience  
Wheres the orchestra  
After all this is my big night on the town  
My introduction to the theatre crowd  
  
I assumed that the show would have a song  
So I was wrong  
At least I understand  
All the innuendo and the irony  
  
And I appreciate  
The roles the actors played  
The point the author made  
And after the closing lines  
  
And after the curtain calls  
The curtain falls  
On empty chairs  
Wheres the orchestra
