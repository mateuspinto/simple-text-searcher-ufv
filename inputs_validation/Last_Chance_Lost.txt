Last chance lost  
In the tyranny of a long goodbye  
Last chance lost  
We talk of us with deadly earnest eyes  
Last chance lost  
We talk of love in terms of sacrifice and compromise  
Last chance  
Last chance lost  
  
Last chance lost  
The hero cannot make the change  
Last chance lost  
The shrew will not be tamed  
Last chance lost  
They bicker on the rifle range  
Blame takes aim  
Last chance  
Last chance lost
