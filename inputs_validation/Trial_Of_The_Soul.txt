Hell tear you apart  
For he knows what to do  
And he knows what to say  
Hell match your will  
For if its weak  
Youre his prey  
  
But still I try  
As I ride by the light of the moon  
Heart burstin inside  
As I fly evil around me now looms  
The trial of the soul when theres nothing left you can say  
For all your lies weigh heavy against you today  
  
Now be judged  
On what is locked  
Deep inside  
Battle till death  
For your honor  
For your pride  
In your heart you must know  
What is just  
What is true  
When the devil looks in your face  
Its just him  
Its just you  
  
My battle ordained  
Flesh blood horror and pain  
In God I put my trust  
That Hell save my soul if Im slain  
Before the final battle as the storm turns heading my way  
Behold the invincible weapon  
The only thing thatll save you today  
  
One thing I know  
The true test of a warriors soul  
His battle lies within  
Deep in his heart where evil takes its hold  
Once foretold  
The mightiest sword you could hold  
Is a heart that is true  
When the battles ensues  
As the prophecy unfolds  
  
For his thoughts  
Are so quick  
From his mouth  
Roll the lies  
If you listen  
To him  
You are caught  
By surprise  
  
Believe or die our swords clash  rings the bell of the doomed  
Millions whove tried before  
The fires of Hell have consumed  
But his deadliest blows  
My sword seems to jump in their way  
Over and over in my mind these are the words that I say  
  
One thing I know  
The true test of a warriors soul  
His battle lies within  
Deep in his heart where evil takes its hold  
For I was told  
Of the incredible power it holds  
Against anything will victory bring  
In the trial of the soul  
  
For the sword that you hold  
Draws its power from your soul  
Quicker than light cutting deep in the night  
Where evil blood runs cold  
So to the bold  
Prepare the weapon you must hold  
And ask of the Lord  
Victory to our swords  
As we face the dangers untold
