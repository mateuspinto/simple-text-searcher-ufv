Got to be there got to be there  
Got to be there in the morning  
When she says hello to the world  
  
Got to be there got to be there  
Got to be there in her down time  
And show her that shes my girl  
Ooh what a feeling therell be  
The moment I know she loves me  
Cause when I look in her eyes I realize  
I need her sharing the world beside me  
  
So I got to be there got to be there  
Got to be there in the morning  
And welcome her into my world  
And show her that shes my girl  
When she says hello world got to be there got to be there  
  
I need her sharing the world beside me  
Thats why I got to be there got to be there  
Got to be there where it all begins  
And thats everywhere she goes  
I got to be there so she knows  
That when shes with me  
Shes home ooh shes home ooh shes home yea  
  
Got to be there got to be there got to be there  
Got to be there got to be there got to be there  
Got to be there ooh baby baby got to be there got to be there
