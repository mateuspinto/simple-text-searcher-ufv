Something calls me  
From a dark place  
And so I pray every night  
Something knows me  
It whispers my name  
And Im losing my faith  
I can feel it breathing  
But it feels like something dead and cold  
I can feel it waiting  
But it waits for something in my soul  
Sometimes I call out for you and sometimes Im afraid  
So I beg God  
For salvation for an angel  
Every night  
And I ask God  
Can He forgive me  
And I want to believe  
I think I hear it laughing  
But it sounds like my voice lost and old  
I think it showed me Heaven  
And now I know why Im scared to die  
Am I a fool in the dark I dont know  
Am I the ghost in my dreams I dont know  
Am I a shadow of life I dont know  
Am I afraid of the truth I dont know  
Sometimes I call out for you and sometimes Im afraid  
So I ask for  
One small mercy  
But it whispers Who are you  
So I ask God  
If He can save me  
He says Its all too dark
