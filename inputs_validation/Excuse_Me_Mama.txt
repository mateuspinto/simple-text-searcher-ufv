Verse  
I was at the mall on some back to school  
Tryna cop me a couple pairs of shoes  
And then I looked to my left  
And I lost my breath cause this girl was so fresh  
Really wasnt tryna intrude  
But she looked like the type I was into  
And I wanted to holla but she was wit her mama  
Felt like a catch 22  
Okay how should I step to her how should I step to her  
Without any disrespect to her  
But I thought she would like  
If I kept it polite  
So I stepped and this is what I said to her  
  
Chorus  
Excuse me mamma hey  
Your daughters fine your daughters fine  
And If I could Id like a moment of her time a moment of her time  
While I was shopping I saw her walking by  
So can I get her number and Ill give her mine  
  
Verse 2  
Wishin I could catch her by herself  
Waitin til she wasnt with nobody else  
Now every time I saw her  
I was tryin to call her  
And she was busy checkin for the sales  
Part of me was like just let it go  
The other part of me was like let her know  
But I will never get this chance  
My life again gotta man up and tell her so  
  
Hook  
Okay how should I step to her how should I step to her  
Without any disrespect to her  
But I thought she would like  
If I kept it polite  
So I stepped and this is what I said to her  
  
Chorus  
Excuse me mamma hey  
Your daughters fine so fine so finee so fine  
And If I could Id like a moment of her time  
While I was shopping and I saw her walking by  
So can I get her number and Ill give her mine  
  
Breakdown  
Baby dont you know that you  
Got me all up in the wrong store  
Now the malls bout to close  
Crazy but I followed you  
Cause I just couldnt take it no more  
No disrespect to your mama but I need that  
Number baby yeaa  
  
Chorus X2  
Excuse me mamma hey  
Your daughters fine  
And If I could Id like a moment of her time  
While I was shopping and I saw her walking by  
So can I get her number and Ill give her mine  
Excuse me mamma hey  
Your daughters fine your daughters fine  
And If I could Id like a moment of her time  
While I was shopping and I saw her walking by  
So can I get her number and Ill give her mine
