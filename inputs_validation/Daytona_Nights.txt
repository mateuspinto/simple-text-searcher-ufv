I got some sun tan oil  
And a rebel flag  
Stuck a Florida road map  
In my saddle bag  
I think Panama City  
Would be a good place to start  
On this little vacation  
To loosen up my heart  
Orange blossom trail  
Over in Orlando  
Ive heard some wild tales about the women there standing out on the road  
And when you leave out of there  
On a midnight ride  
Take that highway down to that famous town on the ocean side  
  
Daytona nights  
They make you dance  
All the girls got that centerfold pose  
And they all got a tan  
And if theyre looking for love  
Its like a rising tide  
And they will swallow you up like sand to the hubs daytona nights  
  
Now the Boothill Saloon  
And the Last Resort  
Thats a few of the sites  
You need to be looking for  
Hawaian tropic women  
They got the best buns of all  
I like the way they sway when they walk up and say  
hey and how are yall  
So we swim all day  
And we played all night  
And I never want to leave this free as a breeze daytona nights  
  
Daytona nights  
Sure make you dane  
All these girls got that centerfold pose  
And they all got a tan  
And if theyre looking for love  
Its like a rising tide  
They will swallow you up like sand to the hubs daytona nights  
  
Yes if theyre looking for love  
Its like a stormy tide  
They will swallow you up like sand to the hubs daytona nights  
Stuck in those daytona nights  
  
Here comes the tide
