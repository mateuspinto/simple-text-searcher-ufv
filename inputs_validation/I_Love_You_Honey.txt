Down in Dallas near the Palace  
I met a boy who was so cute  
I loved his huggin I loved his kissin  
As we sat in his little red coupe  
  
He said Tell me confidentially  
How much do you love me  
Well I thought awhile and then I smiled  
And this is what I told him dontcha see  
  
I love you honey I love your money  
I love your automobile  
I love you baby I dont mean maybe  
Youre the sweetest thing on wheels  
  
I love your kisses I wouldnt miss it  
No matter how I feel  
I love you honey I love your money  
Most of all I love your automobile
