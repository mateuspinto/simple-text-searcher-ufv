She went to the river  
She never thought twice  
She went to the river  
The river of ice  
Slowly she removed the blouse of silk  
From her back  
Carefully undid her skirt  
And let it fall unwrapped  
  
She cut with her fingers  
The cold river sighed  
She wanted the water  
The water inside  
She walked to the center  
Unbraided her hair  
Stepped out of her panties  
And left her breast bare  
  
Stretched out on the ice  
She dug into it slowly  
Methodically punching  
The half frozen floor  
The blood from her fingers  
Helped warm them but only  
Until it froze over a moment  
No more  
No more  
  
He watched from the tower  
He saw her below  
Her physical power would melt  
Like the snow  
But not so the power  
Of crystal decision  
The lock of the mind  
In undaunting precision  
  
On the window  
A flower hed bought to her  
Bought but forgotten to water  
  
The night rolled in slowly  
But did not bring sleep  
Her opening was only a few  
Inches deep  
But as she pressed her head  
  
Down to the unyielding shell  
She could hear the water  
Almost well  
  
Morning crept in cautiously  
Fearing what itd find  
A ring of clothes around on  
Opening of the mind  
And the water humming  
For beneath  
She is mine  
And the water humming  
For beneath  
She is mine  
  
She is mine
