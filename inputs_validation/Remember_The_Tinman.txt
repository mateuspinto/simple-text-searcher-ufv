There are locks on the doors  
And chains stretched across all the entries to the inside  
Theres a gate and a fence  
And bars to protect from only God knows what lurks outside  
Who stole your heart left you with a space  
That no one and nothing can fill  
Who stole your heart who took it away  
Knowing that without it you cant live  
Who took away the part so essential to the whole  
Left you a hollow body  
Skin and bone  
What robber what thief who stole your heart and the key  
  
Who stole your heart  
The smile from your face  
The innocence the light from your eyes  
Who stole your heart or did you give it away  
And if so then when and why  
Who took away the part so essential to the whole  
Left you a hollow body  
Skin and bone  
What robber what thief  
Who stole your heart and the key  
  
Now all sentiment is gone  
Now you have no trust in no one  
  
Who stole your heart  
Did you know but forget the method and moment in time  
Was it a trickster using mirrors and sleight of hand  
A strong elixir or a potion that you drank  
Who hurt your heart  
Bruised it in a place  
That no one and nothing can heal  
  
Youve gone to wizards princes and magic men  
Youve gone to witches the good the bad the indifferent  
But still all sentiment is gone  
But still you have no trust in no one  
  
If you can tear down the walls  
Throw your armor away remove all roadblocks barricades  
If you can forget there are bandits and dragons to slay  
And dont forget that you defend an empty space  
And remember the tin man  
Found he had what he thought he lacked  
Remember the tin man  
Go find your hear and take it back  
  
Who stole your heart  
Maybe no one can say  
One day you will find it I pray
