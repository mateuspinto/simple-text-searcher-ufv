We still got a long way to go  
We still got a long way to go  
We all got a long way to go  
  
Whats keeping us apart isnt selfishness  
Whats holding us together isnt love  
Listen to the man whos been  
touched all his life  
Yes hes the one they call the fool  
  
Where is the saviour of the sidewalk life  
and the road that takes us to the crusades  
Ive seen those shadows  
as theyre moving in my sleep  
leading the blind poet to his grave  
  
We still got a long way to go  
We still got a long way to go  
Yes we all got a long way to go  
  
Please dont waste your energy on me my friend  
cause we still got a long way to go  
well meet again some day  
but right now just go away  
cause I still got a long way to go  
  
The silence is speaking  
so why am I weeping  
I guess I love it  
I love it to death  
  
Yes we still got a long way to go  
Yes we still got a long way to go  
Yes we all got a long way to go
