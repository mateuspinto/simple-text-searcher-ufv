Arrivederci roma  
Goodbye goodbye to rome   
  
City of a million moonlit places  
City of a million warm embraces  
Where I found the one of all the faces  
Far from home  
  
Arrivederci roma  
Its time for us to part  
  
Save the wedding bells for my returning  
Keep my lovers arms outstretched and yearning  
Please be sure the flame of love keeps burning  
In her heart
