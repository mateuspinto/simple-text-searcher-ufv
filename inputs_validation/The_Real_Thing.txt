She is waiting  
In the office  
For the bell to go  
She is thinking  
Of their meeting  
Just a month ago  
Now shes running  
Through the people  
Everyone so slow  
Now he holds her  
And he loves her  
He tells her so and  
  
La la la  
Love is the real thing  
You know  
Love is the real thing  
La la la la  
La love  
La la la  
Love is the real thing  
You know  
Love is the real thing  
La la la la  
  
By the nightfall  
They have driven  
From the world they know  
Shes so happy  
Theyre together  
And their love will grow  
  
And when you feel your chance has come  
Whos going to throw it all away  
And if theres someone left behind  
You have to say that  
  
La la la  
Love is the real thing  
You know  
Love is the real thing  
La la la la  
  
La love  
La la la  
Love is the real thing  
You know  
Love is the real thing  
La la la la  
  
La la la  
Love is the real thing  
You know  
Love is the real thing  
La la la la  
La love  
La la la  
Love is the real thing  
You know  
Love is the real thing  
La la la la
