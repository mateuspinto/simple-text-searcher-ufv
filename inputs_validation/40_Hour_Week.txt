There are people in this country who work hard every day  
Not for fame or fortune do they strive  
But the fruits of their labor are worth more than their pay  
And its time a few of them were recognized  
  
Hello Detroit auto workers let me thank you for your time  
You work a forty hour week for a livin just to send it on down the line  
Hello Pittsburgh steel mill workers let me thank you for your time  
You work a forty hour week for a livin just to send it on down the line  
  
This is for the one who swings the hammer driving home the nail  
Or the one behind the counter ringing up the sale  
Or the one who fights the fires the one who brings the mail  
For everyone who works behind the scenes  
  
You can see them every morning in the factories and the fields  
In the city streets and the quiet country towns  
Working together like spokes inside a wheel  
They keep this country turning around  
  
Hello Kansas wheat field farmer let me thank you for your time  
You work a forty hour week for a livin just to send it on down the line  
Hello West Virginia coal miner let me thank you for your time  
You work a forty hour week for a livin just to send it on down the line  
  
This is for the one who drives the big rig up and down the road  
Or the one out in the warehouse bringing in the load  
Or the waitress the mechanic the policeman on patrol  
For everyone who works behind the scenes  
  
With a spirit you cant replace with no machine  
Hello America let me thank you for your time
