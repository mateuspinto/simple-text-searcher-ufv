Got into a cab Broadway Fifty Ninth  
Took off like a blast  
Almost lost my mind  oh oh oh  
  
Cabbies on crack  
  
It first felt like at thrill ride  
Excited for a while  
Got pretty scary  
Swerving at a hundred miles an hour  oh oh oh  
  
Cabbies on crack  
I want to get out  
out of this yellow shell  
I want to get out  
crack cabbies straight from hell  
  
And I dont wanna die before I live  
Cabbies on Cabbies on crack  
  
Cabbies on crack  
Want my money back  
Disco blasting out  
Stomach in my mouth  oh oh oh  
  
Cabbies on crack  
  
Times Square was approaching  
He braked for the light  
At 90 miles an hour  
flashed by I saw my life  oh oh oh  
  
Cabbies on crack  
I want to get out  
out of this yellow shell  
I want to get out  
crack cabbies straight from hell  
  
And I dont wanna die before I live  
Cabbies on Cabbies on crack  
  
And I dont wanna die before I live  
Cabbies on Cabbies on crack  
  
Cabbies on crack
