Youve got to try for the kingdom  
Youve got to try for the kingdom  
On high youve got to try  
By His grace by His grace  
  
Youve got to live your religion  
Deep inside when you try  
For the kingdom on high  
By His grace by His grace  
  
Open your mind to the wisdom  
When you try for the kingdom on high  
By His grace by His grace  
  
Open your heart to the wisdom  
In your mind when you try  
For the kingdom on high  
By His grace by His grace  
  
One day at a time you got to try  
Open your eye it will come  
By and by when you try  
By His grace by His grace  
By His grace by His grace
