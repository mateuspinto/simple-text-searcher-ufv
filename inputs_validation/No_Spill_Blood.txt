What is the law  
What is the law  
Animals came from miles around  
So tired of walking so close toe the ground  
They needed a chance thats what they said  
Life is better walking on two legs  
But they were in for a big surprise  
Cause they didnt know the law  
CHORUS  
What is the law  
No spill blood  
What is the law  
No spill blood  
Who makes the rules  
Someone else  
Who makes the rules  
Someone else  
The rules are written in the stone  
Break the rules and you get no bones  
All you get is ridicule laughter  
And a trip to the house of pain  
CHORUS in reverse order  
We walk on two legs not on four  
To walk on four legs breaks the law  
What happens when we break the law  
What happens when the rules arent fair  
We all know here we go from there  
To the house of pain  
To the house of pain  
What is the law  
What is the law  
Who makes the rules  
Who makes the rules  
We walk on two legs not on four  
To the house of pain  
To the house of pain  
To the house of pain  
To the house of pain  
To the house of pain  
No spill blood
