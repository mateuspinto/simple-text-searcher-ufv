Of all the stars that ever shone  
Not one does twinkle like your pale blue eyes  
Like golden corn at harvest time your hair  
Sailing in my boat the wind  
Gently blows and fills my sail  
Your sweetscented breath is everywhere  
  
Daylight peeping through the curtain  
Of the passing night time is your smile  
And the sun in the sky is like your laugh  
Come back to me my Nancy  
Linger for just a little while  
Since you left these shores Ive known no peace  
Nor joy  
  
No matter where I wander Im still haunted  
By your name  
The portrait of your beauty stays the same  
Standing by the ocean wondering where youve  
Gone if youll return again  
Where is the ring I gave to Nancy Spain  
  
On the day in Spring when snow starts to melt  
And streams to flow  
With the birds Ill sing this song  
Then in the while Ill wander  
Down by bluebell stream where wild flowers grow  
And Ill hope that lovely Nancy will return  
  
No matter where I wander Im still haunted  
By your name  
The portrait of your beauty stays the same  
Standing by the ocean wondering where youve  
Gone if youll return again  
Where is the ring I gave to Nancy Spain
