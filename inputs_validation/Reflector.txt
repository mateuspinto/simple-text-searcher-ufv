Since Ive found your love  
Ive never needed anything to fill my heart  
Even when I fall  
Youre always there with open arms to pick me up  
From the start I knew  
No one else could make me feel the way you do  
Everyday I want to grow  
Just a little bit closer just a little bit closer  
I want to be a reflector  
I want to shine with your glory  
I want to let the whole world know that youre  
Living in me  
I want to burn with your fire  
Shine my light a little brighter  
I want to let the whole world know that  
Jesus Lives in me
