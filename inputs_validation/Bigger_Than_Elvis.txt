Come lets talk just you and me  
For once just let me be  
The little boy you used to know  
Relive that summers bliss  
Cause they came no more like this  
Those were the days  
The days when love was still in style  
  
Chorus  
All I ever dreamed Id be  
Is what you are to me  
Bigger than Elvis  
And for all the missing years  
A memory reappears  
Bigger than Elvis  
  
I saw you on TV  
The king you were to me  
Could you feel me watching you  
At times my heart got mad  
Only heroes are allowed  
To run free that they could come back inside of me  
  
Chorus  
  
We know the sadness of goodbyes  
Must be the one thats bringing tears to your childs eyes  
  
Oh from now on Ill walk with you  
Making music like you do  
Would you believe I always knew  
  
You were never hard to take  
In some mysterious way  
Bigger than Elvis  
And for all the missing years  
Your memory reappears  
Bigger than Elvis  
  
Now Ive found the missing years  
Forgotten all my tears  
Ive found the missing years
