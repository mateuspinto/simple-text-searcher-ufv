Baby take me baby take me baby Im drivin maybe  
Baby take me  
Take it or leave it on a Saturday night  
If what you see is what you get then gimme a bite  
Here comes the ladies theyre so insecure  
Leave it to the boys and the fool on the hill  
Hey baby be no jock no third degree  
Oh jailbait  
Play the foolin play the pawn  
Wake up baby Im out the door jailbait  
Im believin someone talkin  
Cant let go got the hold oh jailbait  
What it is that you believe  
What you got got up your sleeve oh  
Jailbait jailbait jailbait jailbait  
  
Take it leave it roll the dice  
Youre hot as hell Im cold as ice oh jailbait  
Tell your daddy how you do me  
Put the woodshed do it to me jailbait  
Whatchya see in daddys eyes  
Check the voice aint no surprise  
Jailbait jailbait jailbait jailbait jailbait jailbait  
Do me do you tell me would you  
See me me too do me do you

Girls in love I never knew she jailbait  
Steep the chase cold sweatin
