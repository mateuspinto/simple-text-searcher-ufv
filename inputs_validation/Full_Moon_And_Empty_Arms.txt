Full moon and empty arms  
The moon is there for us to share  
But where are you  
  
A night like this  
Could weave a memory  
And every kiss  
Could start a dream for two  
  
Full moon and empty arms  
Tonight Ill use the magic moon to wish upon  
And next full moon  
If my one wish comes true  
My empty arms will be filled with you  
  
Full moon and empty arms  
Tonight Ill use the magic moon to wish upon  
And next full moon  
If my one wish comes true  
My empty arms will be filled with you
