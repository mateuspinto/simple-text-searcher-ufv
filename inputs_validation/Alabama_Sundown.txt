The cold December wind seems bent on rockin New York City  
The town thats got me down to my last dime  
And everywhere I go the people seem in such a hurry  
To keep this Mobile girl from feelin fine  
  
Chorus  
Lord what Id give to see an Alabama sundown  
The sun just seemed to drop in Mobile Bay  
New York town has got a gifted way to keep a girl down  
But that never was the Mobile way no no  
That never was the Mobile way  
  
A flashing sign says that you can rent a bed for just a dollar  
In anybodys town that price is cheap  
Its a shame to know a girl would ever fall down to my standards  
Cause I need ninety cents to go to sleep  
  
Chorus  
  
I felt so big the day I left that Mobile couldnt hold me  
I thought there had to be a better way  
But if I could find that man that first called Lady Luck a lady  
That gentleman would surely learn to pray  
  
Chorus x2
