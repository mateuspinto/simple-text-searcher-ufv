After we love we bathe in a glow  
Remembering what happened a moment ago  
Like after the rain when the wind breezes a sigh  
While its resting on pillows of sky  
Deep in your arms its peaceful and warm  
Together we lay in a calm that comes after a storm  
In a moment or two we can hear the stars coming through  
I love the quiet right after the rain here with you  
  
After the rain the birds want to fly  
The trees all in green hang the leaves out to dry  
Like puddles and pools what your eyes let me see  
Are their loving reflections of me  
After a while you touch me and then  
I feel like a flower that longs for a shower again  
  
And then lost in a kiss  
I could stay for hours like this  
Though i dont know just what magic the raindrops contain  
I know that everythings wonderful after the rain
