Take a walk in the warm New England sun  
Aint no time to look for clues  
You get the point from Uncle Sams loaded gun  
Who be the hand that light the fuse ah  
  
Take a look take a look at my old billy goat  
He used to raise all kinds of hell  
He took a dose of radiation dope  
Back in the barn is where he fell like hell  
  
Lucy chromosone  
Lucy superdome  
  
What makes you think you patronizin my old friends  
After you ride in my car car  
What do you do when your oils mexican  
OPEC boys you went too far to faar  
  
Lucy chromosone  
Lucy superdome  
Lucy papadum  
Lucy sing the song  
  
Ah dig it up  
Ah leave it up  
Ah dig it up  
Ah leave it up  
  
Look out
