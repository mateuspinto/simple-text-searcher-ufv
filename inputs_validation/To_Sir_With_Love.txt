The time has come  
For closing books and long last looks must end  
And as I leave  
I know that I am leaving my best friend  
A friend who taught me right from wrong  
And weak from strong  
Thats a lot to learn  
What what can I give you in return  
  
If you wanted the moon  
I would try to make a start  
But i would rather let me give my heart  
To you with love  
  
Those schoolgirl days  
Of telling tales and biting nails are gone yeah  
But in my mind  
I know that they live on and on and on and on  
But how do you thank someone  
Who has taken you from crayons to perfume  
Well its not easy  
But Ill try  
  
If you wanted the sky  
I would write across the sky in letters  
That would soar a thousand feet high  
To you with love  
Those awkward years have hurried by  
Why did they fly fly away  
Why is it sir children grow up to be people one day  
What takes the place of climbing tres and dirty knees in the world outside  
What what is there that I can buy  
  
If you wanted the world  
Id surround it with a wall Id scrawl  
These words withe letters ten feet tall  
To you with love
