I caught the moon today  
Pick it up  
And throw it away all right  
I got the perfect steal  
A cleaner love  
With a dirty feel all right  
Fall out and take the bait  
Eat the fruit  
And kiss the snake goodnight  
  
Common ruse dirty face  
Pretty noose is pretty hate  
And I dont like  
What you got me hanging from  
  
Let your motor race  
Pick it up  
And get this mother gone  
Out from and far away  
The wooden snake  
This thing has got me on  
  
Diamond rope silver chain  
Pretty noose is a pretty pain  
And I dont like  
What you got me hanging from  
  
I dont care what you got  
I dont care what you need  
I dont want anything  
And I dont like what  
You got me hanging from
