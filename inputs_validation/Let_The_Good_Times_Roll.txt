Im casting pearls before the swine  
I think I must be losing my mind  
You tried to leave me high and dry  
Yes you nearly left me to die  
Sticks and stones may break my bones  
But your words they never hit home  
Time to say goodbye to all the pain  
And chase away the rain  
Now there is wind in my sails  
And I cannot fail  
Let the good times roll  
Let the good times roll  
Im a soldier and I will fight  
On through the darkness and into the light  
Now the ace is up my sleeve  
Its so good its hard to believe  
I will take the journey to the end  
Until there is nothing left for you to defend  
Now the tables are being turned  
And its time for you to burn  
Now there is wind in my sails  
And I cannot fail  
Let the good times roll  
Let the good times roll  
guitar solo  
Let the good times roll  
Let the good times roll  
Let the good times roll
