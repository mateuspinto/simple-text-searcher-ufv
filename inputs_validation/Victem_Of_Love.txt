What kind of love have you got  
You should be home but youre not  
A room full of noise and dangerous boys  
Still makes you thirsty and hot  
I heard about you and that man  
Theres just one thing I dont understand  
You say hes a liar and he put out  
Your fire  
How come you still got his gun in your hand  
Victim of love I see a broken heart  
You got your stories to tell  
Victim of love its such an easy part  
And you know how to play it so well  
  
Some people never come clean  
I think you know what I mean  
Youre walkin the wire pain and desire  
Looking for love in between  
  
Tell me your secrets Ill tell you mine  
This aint no time to be cool  
And tell all your girlfriends  
You been around the world friends  
That talk is for losers and fools  
  
Victim of love I see a broken heart  
I could be wrong but Im not  
Victim of love were not so far apart  
Show me what kind of love have you got  
  
Victim of love youre just a victim of love  
I could be wrong but Im not  
Victim of love now youre a victim of love  
What kind of love have you got  
What kind of love have you got  
What kind of love have you got
