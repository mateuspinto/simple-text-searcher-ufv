Im sailing away set an open course for the virgin sea  
Ive got to be free free to face the life thats ahead of me  
On board Im the captain so climb aboard  
Well search for tomorrow on every shore  
And Ill try oh Lord Ill try to carry on  
  
I look to the sea reflections in the waves spark my memory  
Some happy some sad  
I think of childhood friends and the dreams we had  
We live happily forever so the story goes  
But somehow we missed out on that pot of gold  
But well try best that we can to carry on  
  
A gathering of angels appeared above my head  
They sang to me this song of hope and this is what they said  
They said come sail away come sail away  
Come sail away with me  
Come sail away come sail away  
Come sail away with me  
  
I thought that they were angels but to my surprise  
They climbed aboard their starship and headed for the skies  
Singing come sail away come sail away  
Come sail away with me  
Come sail away come sail away  
Come sail away with me
