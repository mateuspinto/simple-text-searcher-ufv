Christmas celebration  
All around the nation  
Wont you stay with me tonight  
Cause Im running out of fight  
And the pagentry is such a bore  
  
Carolers are singing  
Registers kachinging  
And the presents are in place  
But Id rather eat some mace  
Cause that egg nog always makes me sick  
  
You know how the story goes  
Youve seen it all before  
That man is so obese  
That he cant get out the door  
  
Christmas to perfection  
Im begging for some action  
And the ringing in my ears  
Is the sound of Christmas cheer  
Cause they knocked me screaming overboard  
  
You know how the story goes  
Youve seen it all before  
That man is so obese  
That he cant get out the door  
  
You know how the story goes  
Youve seen it all before  
That man is so obese  
That he cant get out the door  
  
Christmas celebration  
All around the nation  
Wont you stay with me tonight  
Cause Im running out of fight  
And the pagentry is such a bore  
The pagentry is such a bore  
The pagentry is such a bore  
The pagentry is such a bore yeah  
The pagentry is such a bore yeah
