No One Sleeps No One Sleeps  
Even You O Princess  
In Your Cold Room  
Watch The Stars  
That Tremble With Love  
And With Hope  
But My Secret Is Closed Within Me  
My Name No One Shall Know No No  
On Your Mouth I Will Reveal It  
When The Light Shines  
And My Kiss Will Dissolve The Silence  
That Makes You Mine  
Vanish O Night  
Set Stars  
Set Stars  
At Dawn I Shall Conquer  
I Shall Win  
I Shall Win
