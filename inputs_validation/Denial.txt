Here I am in a house full of doors but no exits  
In a light that is grey like the stain on my windows  
All of this is a gift such a painful companion  
Inside of me  
  
Its just something I know the answers not there  
It comes and it goes and it frightens me  
Its just something I know the answers not there  
It comes and it goes and it frightens me  
  
This feeling inside me cant confront the decay  
To fall down on my knees and resume this charade  
Believe me this distance its not what I need  
Inside of me  
  
Its another story some of it is blurred  
I tried to understand him I tried so hard  
Time worked so well upon us inside of me  
Inside my soul Inside my soul  
  
Time worked so well upon us  
Inside of me inside my soul  
Inside of me inside my soul
