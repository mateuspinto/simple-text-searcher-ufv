I see heaven before me  
Angels passing around me  
Here I stand in awe of your beauty  
Captured by your holiness  
Lift up your eyes  
All of heavens in worship  
Angels rejoice and the clouds will be filled  
With the wonder of your name  
With the wonder of your name  
The train of his robe fills the temple with glory  
Heavenly hosts fall before him in worship  
Crying Holy Holy Holy is the Lord God Almighty  
Holy Holy Holy is the Lord God Almighty
