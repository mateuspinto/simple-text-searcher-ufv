All Roads They Lead To Shame  
All Drowning In The Blame  
All Reflections Look The Same  
In The Shine Of The Midnight Revolver  
  
All Hide Beneath A Skin  
A Hope So Paper Thin  
Im at The Door Again  
And The Shine Of The Midnight Revolver  
  
Even The Promise Of Danger Has Gone Dull  
Staring Down The Barrel Of A 45  
  
Suck On The Barrel  
Suck On The Barrel  
Suck It til Its Gone Dry  
  
For All Reflections Look The Same  
In The Shine Of The Midnight Revolver  
  
Redemption Purify  
Will Nothing Satisfy  
The Scars Just Multiply  
In The Shine Of The Midnight Revolver  
  
Twisting In Apocalypse  
Death Upon The Fingertips  
Frigid Metal Touches Lips  
And The Shine Of The Midnight Revolver  
  
Cause You Lied  
  
Just A Bullet Away  
Just A Bullet Away From Leavin You  
Just A Bullet Away  
Stop The Voices In My Head  
  
Caressing Death Again  
Becomes The Heroin  
Forbidden Medicine  
Puts A Shine On The Midnight Revolver  
  
Eternal Borderline  
All The Faces Intertwine  
Oh God Now I See Mine  
In The Shine Of The Midnight Revolver  
  
Even The Promise Of Danger Has Gone Dull  
Staring Down The Barrel Of A 45  
  
Suck On The Barrel  
Suck On The Barrel  
Suck Suck Till Its Dry  
  
For All Reflections Look The Same  
In The Shine Of The Midnight Revolver  
  
Down In Misery  
Down In Misery  
  
Just A Bullet Away  
Just A Bullet Away From Leavin You  
Just A Bullet Away  
Stop The Voices In My Head  
  
All Roads They Lead To Shame  
All Drowning In The Blame  
Reflections Look The Same  
In The Shine Of The Midnight Revolver  
  
All Hide Beneath A Skin  
A Hope So Paper Thin  
Im At The Door Again  
And The Shine Of The Midnight Revolver  
  
Even The Promise Of Danger Has Gone Dull  
Staring Down The Barrel Of A 45  
  
Suck On The Barrel  
Suck On The Barrel  
Suck Suck Till Its Dry  
  
Do All Reflections Look The Same  
In The Shine Of The Midnight Revolver  
  
Cause You Lied  
Yes You Lied  
  
Just A Bullet Away  
Just A Bullet Away From Leavin You  
Just A Bullet Away  
Stop The Voices In My Head
