Every thread of creation is held in position  
By still other strands of things living  
In an earthly tapestry hung from the skyline  
Of smoldering cities so gray and so vulgar  
As not to be satisfied with their own negativity  
But needing to touch all the living as well  
  
Every breeze that blows kindly is one crystal breath  
We exhale on the blue diamond heaven  
As gentle to touch as the hands of the healer  
As soft as farewells whispered over the coffin  
Were poisoned by venom with each breath we take  
From the brown sulfur chimney and the black highway snake  
  
Every dawn that breaks golden is held in suspension  
Like the yoke of the egg in albumen  
Where the birth and the death of unseen generations  
Are interdependent in vast orchestration  
And painted in colors of tapestry thread  
When the dying are born and the living are dead  
  
Every pulse of your heartbeat is one liquid moment  
That flows through the veins of your being  
Like a river of life flowing on since creation  
Approaching the sea with each new generation  
Youre now just a stagnant and rancid disgrace  
That is rapidly drowning the whole human race  
  
Every fish that swims silent every bird that flies freely  
Every doe that steps softly  
Every crisp leaf that falls all the flowers that grow  
On this colorful tapestry somehow they know  
That if man is allowed to destroy all they need  
He will soon have to pay with his life for his greed
