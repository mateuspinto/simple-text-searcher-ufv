Last night I saw an accident  
On the corner of third and green  
Two cars collided and I got excited  
Just being part of that scene  
  
It was mrs tom walker and her beautiful daughter  
Pamela was driving the car  
They got hit by a man in a lite blue sedan  
Who had obviously been to a bar  
  
Chorus  
They dont know how lucky they are  
They could have run into that tree  
Got struck by a bolt of lightning  
And raped by a minority  
  
It was a four way stop dilemma  
We all arrived the same time  
I yielded to the man to the right of me  
And he yielded it right back to mine  
Well the yield went around and around and around  
Till pamela finally tried  
Just then the man in the light blue sedan  
Hit pamelas passenger side  
  
Chorus  
  
Pamela hit her head on the mirror  
Mrs walker got a bump on the knee  
The man hit himself in the face and said  
why does this happen to me   
The neighbors came out  
And they gathered about  
Saying hey who hit who anyway   
And the police arrived at a quarter to five  
And pronounced all the victims okay  
  
Chorus
