Now if youve ever been down to New Orleans  
Then you can understand just what I mean  
All through the week its quiet as a mouse  
But on Saturday night they go from house to house  
  
You dont have to pay the usual admission  
If youre a cook a waiter or a good musician  
So if you happen to be just passin by  
Stop in at the Saturday Night Fish Fry  
  
It was rockin it was rockin  
You never seen such scufflin  
And shufflin til the break of dawn  
It was rockin it was rockin  
You never seen such scufflin  
And shufflin til the break of dawn  
  
Now my buddy and me was on the main stem  
Foolin around just me and him  
We decided we could use a little something to eat  
So we went to a house on Rampart Street  
  
We knocked on the door and it opened up with ease  
And a lush little miss said Come in please  
And before we could even bat an eye  
We were right in the middle of a big fish fry  
  
It was rockin it was rockin  
You never seen such scufflin  
And shufflin til the break of dawn  
It was rockin it was rockin  
You never seen such scufflin  
And shufflin til the break of dawn  
  
Now the folks was havin the time of their life  
And Sam was jivin Jimmies wife  
Over in the corner was a beat up grand  
Being played by a big fat piano man  
  
Some of the chicks wore expensive frocks  
Some of them had on bobbie socks  
But everybody was nice and high  
At this particular Saturday Night Fish Fry  
  
It was rockin it was rockin  
You never seen such scufflin  
And shufflin til the break of dawn  
It was rockin it was rockin  
You never seen such scufflin  
And shufflin til the break of dawn  
  
Now the women were screamin and jumpin and yellin  
The bottles was flyin and the fish was smellin  
And way up above all the noise they made  
Somebody hollered Better get out of here this is a raid  
  
Now I didnt know we was breakin the law  
But somebody reached up and hit me on the jaw  
They had us blocked off from the front to the back  
And they was puttin em in the wagon like potato sacks  
  
It was rockin it was rockin  
You never seen such scufflin  
And shufflin til the break of dawn  
It was rockin it was rockin  
You never seen such scufflin  
And shufflin til the break of dawn  
  
I knew I could get away if I had a chance  
But I was shakin like I had the St Vitus dance  
Now I tried to crawl under a bathtub  
When the policeman said Where you goin there bub  
  
Now they got us out of there like a house afire  
Put us all in that Black Maria  
Now they might have missed a pitiful few  
But they got poor me and my buddy too  
  
It was rockin it was rockin  
You never seen such scufflin  
And shufflin til the break of dawn  
It was rockin it was rockin  
You never seen such scufflin  
And shufflin til the break of dawn  
  
We headed for jail in a dazed condition  
They booked each one of us on suspicion  
Now my chick came down and went for my bail  
And finally got me out of that rotten jail  
  
Now if you ever want to get a fist in your eye  
Just mention a Saturday night fish fry  
I dont care how many fish in the sea  
But dont ever mention a fish to me  
  
It was rockin it was rockin  
You never seen such scufflin  
And shufflin til the break of dawn  
It was rockin it was rockin  
You never seen such scufflin  
And shufflin til the break of dawn  
  
Give me one of them their fish sandwiches  
Get away from there boy yowza
