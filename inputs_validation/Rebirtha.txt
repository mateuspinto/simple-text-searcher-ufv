Rebirtha strolling cross the street  
Juggling keys to a small red car  
Butterflies and bombs fly close  
Like shes some Disney movie star  
  
Sipping hopes and loneliness  
Since the big leagues left us dry  
Birtha rebirtha sing a sad song  
Soothe these troubled times  
  
First time  
Its not the first time  
Last time  
No I know I seen your place before  
Maybe in a past life  
Or maybe it was just last night  
I dont know  
  
Birtha never sang too well  
But her stereo shook glass  
Leather gripped our bodies  
As her toes curled around the gas  
  
Shaking loose out of Kansas  
First twenty minutes in blackandwhite  
Birtha rebirtha talk to me take to me  
Ease these troubled times  
  
Wont ever talk too much  
She had those television eyes  
My gaze never strayed too much  
Too much past those eyes  
  
She said I know a town where real lifes a game  
Baseballs all thats real  
At night all the faces light up  
As the players take the field  
  
First time  
Its not the first time  
Last time  
No I know I seen your place before  
Maybe in a past time  
Maybe it was just last night  
Dont just know

Birtha rebirtha sweettalk talk em  
Soothe these troubled times  
  
Birtha never ever talked too much  
Had those television eyes  
Said We act like what we watch  
Like what we act out most the time  
  
Gonna take you to a town  
Where real lifes a game  
Baseball is really real  
At night all the spirits lighten up  
As the heroes take the hill  
  
First time  
Its not the first time  
No I know I seen your place before  
Maybe in a past time  
Maybe it was just last night  
I dont know
