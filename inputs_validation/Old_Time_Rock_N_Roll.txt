Just take those old records off the shelf  
Ill sit and listen to em by myself  
Todays music aint got the same soul  
I like that old time rock n roll  
Dont try to take me to a disco  
Youll never even get me out on the floor  
In ten minutes Ill be late for the door  
I like that old time rock n roll  
  
Still like that old time rock n roll  
That kind of music just soothes the soul  
I reminisce about the days of old  
With that old time rock n roll  
  
Wont go to hear them play a tango  
Id rather hear some blues or funky old soul  
Theres only one sure way to get me to go  
Start playing old time rock n roll  
Call me a relic call me what you will  
Say Im oldfashioned say Im over the hill  
Todays music aint got the same soul  
I like that old time rock n roll  
  
Repeat Chorus x3  
  
I like the Old time Rock n Rock
