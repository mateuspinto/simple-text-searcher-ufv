Love is easy hate is wrong  
Find a way babe way back home  
Give your heart love never die  
Oh a little clown will cry  
Be a dreamer be a fool  
Come were breakin all these rules  
Better late than never done  
For the children we need a home  
Give me peace on Earth  
Give me all your love  
Say that we want fightin  
For the peace on Earth  
Give me peace on Earth  
Let the children sing  
Give me all your love  
Give me all your love  
For the little children  
For the peace of all  
Come together turn a dream  
For the children loves all we need  
Oh the wrongs dont make it right  
For the children we will fight
