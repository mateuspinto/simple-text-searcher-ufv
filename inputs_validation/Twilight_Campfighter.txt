Twilight campfighter  
You build your fire into an open wound  
You want us to feel better  
On these darker trails  
With light revealing holy grails  
To hike through dangerous weather  
You need twilight eyes  
Sunspot solider you come from another day  
Accept no pay  
You want us to feel better  
All for longing causes  
Racing minds and lengthy pauses  
All who must soon shed their veils  
And wipe their eyes  
As we vegetate and wait around for brighter days  
And can dance contented to the sound of money  
Could I have seen a sight  
Much greater than your twilight eyes  
That penetrate your silent lives lies  
Twilight campfighter  
We do congratulate  
Its not too late  
To make us all feel better  
Under darker skies  
With your twilight eyes
