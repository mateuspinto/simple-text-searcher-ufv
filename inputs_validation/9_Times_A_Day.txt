Well they dance with my mind  
Through these traits undefined  
You and you and you alike  
Well you all seem to  
Blow me away  
Nine times a day then  
By the tenth time  
Im drifting away  
And you all gather in my brain  
And you dance with my mind  
I like to intercept your trance  
Dissect the stories that you share  
While all the rhythm feeds my soul  
It all swells up and  
Blows me away  
Nine times a day then  
By the tenth time  
Im drifting away  
And you all gather in my brain  
And you dance with my mind  
You blow me away  
Nine times a day then  
By the tenth time  
Im drifting away  
And you all gather in my brain  
And you dance with my mind  
Well they dance with my mind  
Through these traits undefined  
You and you and you alike  
Well you all seem to  
You dance with my mind
