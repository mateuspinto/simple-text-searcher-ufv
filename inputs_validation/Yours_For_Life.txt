In this day and age where changes happen twice as fast  
Sometimes I get wonderin if anything will last  
People changin partners like they change their underwear  
Maybe Im oldfashioned but darlin I still care  
  
Chorus  
And Im yours for life  
Come and be my lifetime  
Come and take the love I have for only one  
Yes Im yours for life  
Come and share my lifetime  
Share the world until our day is done  
  
Time that I first saw your face I loved you where you stood  
In your eyes a kindness  told me you were good  
And if the world could share your heart thered never be a war  
And darlin if I tried and tried I could not love you more  
  
Chorus  
  
Sometime I pray that you will always be the way you always  
Are to me  
Cause if I lost you to the winds of change then I would cease to be
