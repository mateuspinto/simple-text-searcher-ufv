I had it with the same old routine  
I had it with the same old faces places  
Every night in my life  
I started feeling washed up washed out  
Hung up wrung out left to dry out  
Every night  
But I know  
Yeah I know youre out there somewhere  
Oh I I can almost hear you callin  
Im looking for a stranger in the night  
I need a little danger in my life tonight  
  
Im tired of the same old  
Hello baby how ya doin Come here often  
Where have you been all my life  
Every night  
  
But I know  
That someday somewhere  
Ill turn around and youll be there  
OohIn my life  
Every night  
  
But I know  
Yeah I know youre out there somewhere  
Oh I I can almost hear you callin  
Im looking for a stranger in the night  
I need a little danger in my life tonight  
  
Im looking for a stranger in the night  
I need a little danger in my life tonight
