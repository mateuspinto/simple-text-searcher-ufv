Do you know where your heart is  
Do you think you can find it  
Or did you trade it for something  
Somewhere better just to have it  
  
Do you know where your love is  
Do you think that you lost it  
You felt it so strong but  
Nothings turned out how you wanted  
  
Well bless my soul  
Youre a lonely soul  
Cause you wont let go  
Of anything you hold  
  
Well all I need  
Is the air I breathe  
And a place to rest  
My head  
  
Do you know what your fate is  
And are you trying to shake it  
Youre doing your best and your best look  
Youre praying that you make it  
  
Well bless my soul  
Youre a lonely soul  
Cause you wont let go  
Of anything you hold  
  
Well all I need  
Is the air I breathe  
And a place to rest  
My head  
  
I said all I need  
Is the air I breathe  
And a place to rest  
My head  
  
Do you think you can find it  
Do you think you can find it  
Do you think you can find it  
Better than you had it  
  
Do you think you can find it  
Do you think you can find it  
Do you think you can find it  
Yeah better than you had it  
Better than you had it  
  
I said I all I need  
Is the air I breathe  
And a place to rest  
My head  
  
I said all I need  
Is the air I breathe  
And a place to rest  
My head  
  
Whenever the end is  
Do you think you can see it  
Well until you get there  
Go on go ahead and scream it  
Just say it
