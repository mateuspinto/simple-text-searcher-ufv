Got our feet on a narrow road  
Got our eyes on the one who will be our goal  
and our brothers at our side  
If we stumble we wont fall  
If we miss the mark Hell be there after all  
With an everlasting prize  
The race is on  
  
Chorus  
Cone on and go  
Leave behind the sin you find  
That slows your time  
Come on and go  
You know the race is on  
Come on and go  
Straight ahead be safely led  
By him instead  
Come on and go  
You know the race is on  
  
Lord I try running my own race  
Losin ground losin hope  
Losin sight of your face  
And Im ready to retire  
  
Then Im back on your solid ground  
You remind me of the strength  
That in you Ive found  
And you fill me with your fire  
The race is on  
  
Chorus
