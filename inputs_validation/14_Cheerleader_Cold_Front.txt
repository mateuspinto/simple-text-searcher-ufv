14 cheerleader cold front  
Put your nose beyond  
Creeping boys in alleys  
Find them when your gone  
  
Stick close to locker rooms  
And wavy clothes to wear  
You will hold them dear  
To something queer and stare  
  
16 used companions  
Have nowhere to stay  
Give them access to parking spaces  
No coin meters there  
  
Stick close to locker rooms  
And wavy clothes to wear  
You will hold them dear  
To something queer and stare  
You will hold them dear  
To something queer and stare
