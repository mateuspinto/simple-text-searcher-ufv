Sister of night  
When the hunger descends  
And your bodys a fire  
An inferno that never ends  
An eternal flame  
That burns in desires name  
Sister of night  
When the longing returns  
Giving voice to the flame  
Calling you through flesh that burns  
Breaking down your will  
To move in for the kill  
Oh sister come for me  
Embrace me assure me  
Hey sister I feel it too  
Sweet sister just feel me  
Im trembling you heal me  
Hey sister I feel it too  
Sister of night  
In your saddest dress  
As you walk through the light  
Youre desperate to impress  
So you slide to the floor  
Feeling insecure  
Sister of night  
With the loneliest eyes  
Tell yourself its alright  
Hell make such a perfect prize  
But the cold light of day  
Will give the game away  
Oh sister come for me  
Embrace me assure me  
Hey sister I feel it too  
Sweet sister just feel me  
Im trembling you heal me  
Hey sister I feel it too
