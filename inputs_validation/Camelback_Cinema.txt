Hes standin tall at 5 foot 4  
With the sharpness of a troubadour  
I dare you look him in the eye  
His stench would make a buzzard cry  
  
He likes burt in white lightning  
Camelback cinema  
  
In the dark she sat and wait  
For her steady random date  
Reflecting back to a time  
When eager boys would stand in line  
She likes Burt in White Lightning  
Hes standin tall at 5 foot 4  
Lurking in the corridor  
He came to buy his weekly whore  
At camelback cinema
