I still get jealous  
When they look at you  
I may not show it  
But I do  
  
Its more than I can bear  
When they start to stare  
Cause they think youre  
Too good to be true  
  
I still get jealous  
When we kiss goodnight  
Unless you hold me  
Extra tight  
  
And dear I know a secret  
You didnt know I knew  
I still get jealous  
Cause it pleases you  
  
And dear I know a secret  
You didnt know I knew  
I still get jealous  
Cause it pleases you  
  
Maamaa  
Dear dolly I know a secret  
You didnt know I knew  
I still get jealous honey  
Very jealous ja ja ja  
I still get jealous  
Cause it pleases you
