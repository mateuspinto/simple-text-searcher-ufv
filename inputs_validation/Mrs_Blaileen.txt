Mrs Blaileen  she was a sixth grade teacher  
And she controlled the children  
By using humiliation  
The target always seemed to be Donny  
  
He was a bit slower than the others  
When he was quite young  
His mother died at the kitchen table  
While choking on some food  
  
The fashion of the day  
Was bleach and tied Levis  
Donny decided to make some  
But he didnt know to rinse them  
  
So he came to school a reekin  
Bleach stenched filled the classroom  
Mrs Blaileen began to chastise  
She made him feel like an asshole  
  
Two feet small  
Oh what a lonely boy  
Don and Ronald  
They always stuck together  
  
For they were a bit different than the others  
And they were as tight as brothers  
Then Ronald moved away  
Now Steven  
  
He was year or two younger  
And he really thought he was something  
He liked to harass other children  
Or anyone he found outnumbered  
  
Alone Don walks from fishing  
Steven and his friend they stop him  
They took his hat and they taunt him  
Pimpslap him with a newspaper  
  
Don lunged forward with his fish knife  
Then ran all the way home weeping  
He gave his knife to his father and  
Said I think I hurt Steve  
Oh what a lonely boy
