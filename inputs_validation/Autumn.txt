Autumn it feels like autumn  
Although the breeze is still  
I feel the chill of autumn  
Oh yes its autumn  
Its always autumn  
However green the hill  
To me it still is autumn  
I can feel the frost now  
That makes my spring and summer dreams  
Seem lost now  
Why cant the autumn haze  
Recall the days of warm summer laughter  
That faded soon after in the autumn  
He left in autumn  
And though another seasons here  
I feel the emptiness of autumn  
All the year
