Well Im on the Downeaster Alexa  
And Im cruising through Block Island Sound  
I have charted a course to the Vineyard  
But tonight I am Nantucket bound  
We took on diesel back in Montauk yesterday  
Left this morning from the bell in Gardiners Bay  
Like all the locals here I had to sell my home  
Too proud to leave I worked my fingers to the bone  
So I could own my Downeaster Alexa  
And I go where the ocean is deep  
There are giants out there in the canyon  
And a good captain cant fall asleep  
I got bills to pay and children who need clothes  
I know theres fish out there but God only knows  
They say these waters arent what they used to be  
But I got people back on land who count on me  
So if you see my Downeaster Alexa  
And if you work with the rod and the reel  
Tell my wife I am trolling Atlantis  
And I still have my hands on the wheel  
Now I drive my Downeaster Alexa  
More and more miles from shore every year  
Since they told me I cant sell no stripers  
And theres no luck in swordfishing here  
I was a bayman like my father was before  
Cant make a living as a bayman anymore  
There aint much future for a man who works the sea  
But there aint no island left for islanders like me
