Now Theres a man youll hear about  
Most anywhere you go  
And his holdings are in Texas  
And his name is Diamond Joe  
  
And he carries all his money  
In a diamondstudded jar  
He never took much trouble  
With the process of the law  
  
I hired out to Diamond Joe boys  
Did offer him my hand  
He gave a string of horses  
So old they could not stand  
  
And I nearly starved to death boys  
He did mistreat me so  
And I never saved a dollar  
In the pay of Diamond Joe  
  
Now his bread it was corn dodger  
And his meat you couldnt chaw  
Nearly drove me crazy  
With the wagging of his jaw  
  
And the telling of his story  
Mean to let you know  
That there never was a rounder  
That could lie like Diamond Joe  
  
Now I tried three times to quit him  
But he did argue so  
Im still punching cattle  
In the pay of Diamond Joe  
  
And when Im called up yonder  
And its my time to go  
Give my blankets to my buddies  
Give the fleas to Diamond Joe
