He was rough he was tough  
And he drank his whiskey straight  
He would fight every night  
If he didnt get his way  
She was kind she could find  
All the good in everyone  
And then one day she passed his way  
He felt reborn in that morning sun  
He saw her face she caught his name  
And from that moment  
He knew hed never be the same  
  
What you can find in the eyes of a woman  
Is a reason to believe  
Look deep inside the eyes of a woman  
See the man you want to be  
  
Now Ive been down kicked around  
The world had got the best of me  
Out of rope little hope  
I never get back on my feet  
She took my hand said yes you can  
One look at her and Im a brand new man  
  
What you can find in the eyes of a woman  
Is a reason to believe  
Look deep inside the eyes of a woman  
See the man you want to be  
  
Oh when I feel the need for inspiration  
With just one look I found my salvation  
  
What you can find in the eyes of a woman  
Is a reason to believe  
Look deep inside the eyes of a woman  
See the man you want to be  
See the man you want to be  
See the man see the man you want to be
