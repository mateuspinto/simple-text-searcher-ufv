I walked through the park and saw a young oak tree growing  
Growing beside an old bark hit by lightning  
I asked the young tree how he wished to be  
He shook his leaves and sung to me  
  
Im a strong oak tree like my father used to be  
Though deep in my heart the memorys still there  
The sky is clearer now and the wind is fair  
The world is beautiful and I like it out here  
  
When I hear thunder I think of my father  
He taughtme about life that was when I was five  
Its true that some days are more than grey  
But we learn to get by day by day  
  
Im a strong oak tree like my father used to be  
Though deep in my heart the memorys still there  
The sky is clearer now and the wind is fair  
The world is beautiful and I like it out here
