Like anyone I knew a Dave  
Drove a Plymouth shallow grave  
Said my girl dont just walk she unfurls  
With motorcycle language  
He stumbled through his slang pledge  
Then he dragged the mud for wedding pearls  
  
He closed both his eyes and sort of gave her a kiss  
Said dont worry baby about what youre gonna miss  
There will always be a much much more than this  
Every time you go you are all I see  
Holding out for you and me  
  
Pulled down his birthday suitcase  
Brown with dust from no place  
Said I think its time we made a start  
They danced the waltz of charity  
No car garage two kids for free  
They were pissing bliss and playing parts  
  
She closed both her eyes sorta gave him a kiss  
Said dont worry baby about what youre gonna miss  
There will always be a much much more than this  
Every time you go you are all I see  
Holding out for you and me  
  
And the big snake pit  
And we dance to the edge of it  
And we laugh and we laugh  
Cause we aint seen the edge of it  
  
Every time you go you are all I see  
Holding out for you and me  
Every time you go you are all I see  
Holding out for you and me  
Every time you go you are all I see  
Holding out for you and me  
You and me you and me you and me
