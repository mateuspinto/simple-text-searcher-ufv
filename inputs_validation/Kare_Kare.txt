I was standing on a wave  
Then I made the drop  
I was lying in a cave  
In the solid rock  
I was feeling pretty brave  
Til the lights went off  
Sleep by no means comes too soon  
In a valley lit by the moon  
We left a little dust on his Persian rug  
We gathered up our clothes got the washing done  
In a long forgotten place wholl be the first to run  
Sleep by no means comes too soon  
In a valley lit by the moon  
I was floating on a wave  
Then I made the drop  
I was climbing the walls  
Waiting for the band to stop  
You can say the magic words  
Ive got my sensors on  
And this is the only place  
That I always run from  
Sleep by no means comes too soon  
In a valley lit by the moon
