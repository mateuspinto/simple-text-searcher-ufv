The Lords my Shepherd I have everything I need  
Mercy and love follow me  
Though I walk through the dark valley of death I will  
Not be afraid for Hes here  
  
The Lords my refuge no evil can come near me  
Dwelling in His secret place  
I put my trust in Him He is my shield I will  
Let His peace rule in my heart  
  
Surely the Angel of the Lord is around me  
I have no cause to fear my God will not forsake me  
I am His child now no enemy can touch me  
I will not die but live to tell what He has done  
  
He has ransomed me He gave me all authority  
Power love and a sound mind  
Strong in the Lord and the power of His might I will  
Put on His amour and stand  
  
Surely the Angel of the Lord is around me  
I have no cause to fear my God will not forsake me  
I am my Fathers child now no enemy can touch me  
I will not die but live to tell what He has done  
  
I know surely the Angel of the Lord is around me  
I have no cause to fear my God will not forsake me  
I am my Fathers child now no enemy can touch me  
I will not die but live to tell what He has done
