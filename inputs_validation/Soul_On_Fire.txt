Ooh yeah there you were  
Standin outside the door  
Years since I told you I  
Couldnt go on this way no more  
  
Had no explanation  
Fareyoustration  
Thought I was so very sure  
Oh oh  
  
So you went on your way  
Hittin up at the party scene  
Actin as if you were  
Entirely over me  
  
Dancin with all the ladies  
Just so the news would make it  
Directly to the hot hot line  
Now youre settin my soul on fire  
  
Woah  
Woah  
Didnt know how good it was til you were gone  
Oh  
Woah  
  
Now youre playin with my head  
And you only forget  
All the things I put you through  
But I never stopped lovin you  
  
Forget all that I said  
Cant we go back to bed  
Let bygones go on by  
Cause now youre settin by soul on fire  
  
Woah  
Woah  
Didnt know how good it was til you were gone  
Woah  
Woah  
Now I only want you back so come on home  
Woah  
Woah  
Didnt know how much Id miss you on my own  
Oh  
Baby come on home  
  
So find it in your heart  
Hear my apology  
Weve taken it this far  
Dont you want the rest  
The best of me  
  
Oh  
Woah  
Woah  
Didnt know how good it was til you were gone  
Woah  
Woah  
Now I only want you back so come on home  
Woah  
Woah  
Didnt know how much Id miss you on my own  
Oh  
Baby come on home  
  
Mm mm mm
