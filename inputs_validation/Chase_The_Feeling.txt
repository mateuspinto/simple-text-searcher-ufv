It takes one to know one baby  
I know how you feel  
You got your hunger  
And some problems that are real  
  
And youre dealing with some demons  
Who are driving you insane  
And Ive seen them drag you screaming  
Down the hallways of your brain  
  
Chorus  
And you got loaded again  
Aint you handsome when youre high  
Nothing matters  
Chase the feeling till you die  
  
Let it right on in there baby  
Let it run your life  
Let it run your children off  
And let it run your wife  
  
Let it take the joy you love  
And turn it to despair  
You knew you knew better baby  
You just didnt care  
  
Chorus  
  
Blame it on the moonlight baby  
Think of number one  
Tangled up in two  
When you were shining like the sun  
  
With a pretty piece of hunger  
Who was younger than her eyes  
On the scale of cosmic thunder  
Its a wonder youre alive  
  
Chorus
