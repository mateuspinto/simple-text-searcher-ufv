Here we play games  
Like turning men into boys  
And everyone must cry or love  
  
Recall my circuit  
Recall Im notyou are  
Remember that I moved too soon  
  
Corridor empty  
Time to call in the stage  
A game called echo  
  
Now I ask questions  
I get so nervous of  
A game called echo  
  
We rename vehicles  
You rename heroes  
I switch to auto  
  
You are reception  
I can take it or leave  
Do I need permission to stop
