Denied the everlastin life  behold the son of man  
Nevermore the saviour  bound and damned  
Thou shalt not  be  
Thou shalt not  live  
One law for one  
Do what thou will  gods forsaken  lead me in to hell  
Vicious by nature  evil at heart  
Carnal indulgence  the finest art  
The lies of ages  love you to death  
Inhale your last breath  gods forsaken  
Welcome ye to hell  
Everlasting lies  
Richteous path lies  
False prophet lies  
Rejected from the minds  rejecting golden lies  
Suffer little children  suffer all mankind  
Thou shalt not  ask  
Thou shalt not  rule  
One law for on  
What thou will do  gods forsaken  lead me in to hell  
Gods forsaken
