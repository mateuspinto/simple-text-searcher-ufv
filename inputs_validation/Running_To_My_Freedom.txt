You should have been there when I gave out the news  
I know you would have been surprised to see  
The smoke and the fire that was comin out of me  
Now that Ive finally shaken you loose  
  
And Ive cut the chains that held me back  
Feelin more and more like a train rolling down the track  
Running to my freedom  
I aint never gonna give it back  
  
Me and my freedom from now on  
One of these days its gonna happen to you  
Youre gonna find yourself in love so deep  
That you would give up anything for that love to keep  
  
Then sooner or later it will break down on you  
And when you finally feel all the hurt inside  
You will understand the reason why I cried  
Why I took my freedom  
  
I aint never gonna give it back  
Me and my freedom from now on  
Running to my freedom  
I aint never gonna give it back  
  
Me and my freedom from now on  
  
And now that Ive finally shaken you loose  
And I have cut the chains that held me back  
Feelin more and more like a train rolling down the track  
Running to my freedom  
  
I aint never gonna give it back  
Me and my freedom from now on  
Running to my freedom  
I aint never gonna give it back  
  
Me and my freedom from now on
