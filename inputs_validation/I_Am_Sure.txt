Looking at the future  
Who can tell you what is going on  
It seems we have become the generation  
Of wars and bombs  
And the heart grows weak  
And the fear grows strong  
That the day may come and it may not be very long  
And you want to run  
But you dont know where  
So where do you go  
I know  
And I tell you  
  
Chorus  
I am sure there will be a day  
But it will not be like the nations say  
The Lord will come when this life is through  
And His deep desire is to be with you  
Hearts will fly when the new world starts  
And joy will rise like the morning star  
God will meet every cry of the heart  
And its my prayer  
I want you to be there  
  
I like to think about the new creation  
Things that God will do  
So every now and then I stop and close my eyes  
I enjoy the view  
And the heart grows strong  
And the fear grows weak  
And I cannot wait for the new world to come to me  
And while I dream  
Oh I pray for you  
Cause He wants you to go  
I know  
And I tell you  
  
Chorus
