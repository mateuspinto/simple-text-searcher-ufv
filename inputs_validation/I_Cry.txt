You said goodbye  
I fell apart  
I fell from all we had  
To I never knew  
I needed you so bad  
You need to  
Let things go  
I know you told me so  
Ive been through hell  
To break the spell  
  
Why did I ever  
Let you slip away  
Cant stand another day  
Without you  
Without the feeling  
I once knew  
  
I cry silently  
I cry inside of me  
I cry hopelessly  
Cause I know  
Ill never breathe  
Your love again  
I cry  
Cause youre not  
Here with me  
I cry  
Cause Im lonely  
As can be  
I cry hopelessly  
Cause I know  
Ill never breathe  
Our love again  
  
If you could see me now  
You would know just how  
How hard I try  
Not to wonder why  
  
I wish I could believe  
In something new  
Oh please  
Somebody tell me  
Its not true  
Oh girl  
Ill never be over you  
  
Why did I ever  
Let you slip away  
Cant stand another day  
Without you  
Without the feeling  
I once knew  
  
I cry silently  
I cry inside of me  
I cry hopelessly  
Cause I know  
Ill never breathe  
Your love again  
I cry  
Cause youre not  
Here with me  
I cry  
Cause Im lonely  
As can be  
I cry hopelessly  
Cause I know  
Ill never breathe  
Your love again  
  
If I could have you  
Back tomorrow  
If I could lose  
The pain and sorrow  
I would do just anything  
To make you see  
You still love me  
  
I cry silently  
I cry inside of me  
I cry hopelessly  
Cause I know  
Ill never breathe  
Your love again  
I cry  
Cause youre not  
Here with me  
I cry  
Cause Im lonely  
As can be  
I cry hopelessly  
Cause I know  
Ill never breathe  
Your love again
