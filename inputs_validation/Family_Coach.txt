All aboard the family coach  
Its leaving Greenbank Road  
Christmas 1981  
Christmas when it snowed  
Whilst on board the family coach  
They were circlin the moon  
No one had been there before  
They were landing there in June  
  
Hey hey family coach  
My family coach  
Youve got to make the most  
The most of your family coach  
  
Meanwhile on the family coach  
The postillion quietly spoke  
He said You can not leave your family coach  
This is not a joke  
We must work out our differences  
Though none of us may change  
We all take different routes through life  
But your coach will stay the same   
  
Hey hey family coach  
My family coach  
Youve got to make the most  
The most of your family coach  
  
Hey hey family coach  
My family coach  
Youve got to make the most  
The most of your family coach  
  
Back onboard Apollo 8  
They had gone behind  
And the human family held its breath  
And wondered what theyd find  
Our family coach can stay on earth  
Or be a rocket ship  
But wherever wherever you may go  
Your kin will share the trip  
  
Hey hey family coach  
My family coach  
Youve got to make the most  
The most of your family coach  
  
Now it might well appear to you  
That they were simpler days  
And the family coach is smaller now  
Some have passed away  
But theres never been a golden age  
Nostalgias for the lame  
The best is yet to come my dear  
Its that kind of game  
  
Hey hey family coach  
My family coach  
Youve got to make the most  
The most of your family coach  
  
Hey hey family coach  
My family coach  
Youve got to make the most  
The most of your family coach
