Lyrics  
It was a Zombie Jamboree  
Took place in a New York cemetery  
It was a Zombie Jamboree  
Took place in a New York cemetery  
Zombies from all parts of the Island  
Some of them was a great Calypsonians  
Although the season was Carnival  
We get together in bacchanal  
And they singing  
Back to back belly to belly  
I dont give a damn I done dead already  
Oho back to back belly to belly  
At the Zombie Jamboree  
One female Zombie wouldnt behave  
See how she jumping out of the grave  
In one hand a quarter rum  
In the other hand she knocking Congo drum  
Believe singer start to make his rhyme  
The Zombies are racking their bones in thyme  
One bystander had this to say  
T was a pleasure to see the Zombies break away  
Back to back belly to belly  
I dont give a damn I done dead already  
Oho back to back belly to belly  
At the Zombie Jamboree  
I goin talk to Miss Brigit Bardot  
And tell her miss Bardot take it slow  
All the men think theyre Casanova  
When they see that shes bare foot all over  
Even old men out into beaker  
Find their hearts getting weaker and weaker  
So I goin to ask her for your sake and mine  
At least to wear her ear rings part at the time  
Back to back belly to belly  
I dont give a damn I done dead already  
Oho back to back belly to belly  
At the Zombie Jamboree  
A lot of World leaders talkin bout war  
And Im afraid theyre going too far  
So its up to us you and me  
To put an end to Catastrophe  
We must appeal to their goodness of heart  
And ask them to breech in and please do their part  
Cause if this Atomic war begin  
They wont even have a part to breech in  
Back to back belly to belly
