Right now  
Im bout to show you how its done you can  
Shut down  
Yo my Uzi weights a ton you can  
Beat down  
And you can pump it in your system till it  
Blow out  
Whatever dog no doubt Im bout to  
Smack up  
Anybody who front like he  
Hardcore  
Dont he know I stay raw This is  
LL  
Competition they fell because I  
Do this  
Bringing drama and truth cause I dont  
Play that  
And I be reaping up cash since  
Way back  
Put your honey on my lap and make her  
Heat up  
Got her begging me to beat it up  
Raw dog  
Throw your wacky on the floor straight  
Kill that  
Have her gargling nuts until I  
Spill that  
You better play like En Vogue and  
Hold on  
You wanna battle Set it off baby  
Come on  
Come one Come on Come on  
  
Chorus  
Because my flavors the best  
I get my hustle off all day  
Reck my block knee all far  
I gotta hold it down wit my man  
Big up to my nigga E Love  
Keep the ill rims on the car  
I repped it what more can I say son  
Farmers What  
Farmers What  
  
Murder  
Little niggas getting money on the  
Hot block  
He got the chrome shit spinning up on  
Linden  
Look at the ice and leather the way it  
Blending  
Pass the spit hot Linden from here to  
Mary  
You think you hot Cool Jane Ever  
Here it  
And when it comes to this Im not a  
Soldier  
Im a General crack King  
I told ya  
I proved Im the greatest rapper nigga  
What now  
Tell your man step up then watch he  
Go down  
Game one do or die like  
Bedside  
Nobody even coming close nigga  
Why try  
From the Bronx to Shaolin to  
Uptown  
Like Buckshot said nigga  
Duck down  
You better play like En Vogue and  
Hold on  
You know Im going out nigga  
Come on  
Come on Come one Come on  
  
Chorus  
  
No doubt  
Ill take your block and air it out stay  
Ice out  
Me and my man Little Sharp in the  
Double R  
Whole block lined up wit all the  
Hot cars  
Nigga never be afraid you gotta  
Get paid  
No matter what I do I keep it  
Sexy  
Me and my team spending cream on the  
Club scene  
On Performance Boulevard out in  
Killa Queens  
This joint knocked in the tunnel bout  
One oclock  
They like them raw not the watered down  
Hip Hop  
The broad money and alah zay it  
Dont Stop  
Niggas stumbling and falling off a  
Head Ride  
When Im going to Bedshaw  
Remember me  
Im the greast emcee there could  
Ever be  
You better call Def Jam and tell em  
Hold on  
Cause another major label told me  
Come on  
Come on Come on Come on  
  
Chorus
