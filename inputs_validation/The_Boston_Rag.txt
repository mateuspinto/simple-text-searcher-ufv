Any news was good news  
And the feeling was bad at home  
I was out of mind and you  
Were on the phone  
Lonnie was the kingpin  
Back in nineteen sixtyfive  
I was singing this song  
When Lonnie came alive  
  
Chorus  
Bring back the Boston Rag  
Tell all your buddies  
That it aint no drag  
Bring back the Boston Rag  
  
You were Lady Bayside  
There was nothing that I could do  
So I pointed my car down  
Seventh Avenue  
Lonnie swept the playroom  
And he swallowed up all he found  
It was fortyeight hours til  
Lonnie came around  
  
Chorus
