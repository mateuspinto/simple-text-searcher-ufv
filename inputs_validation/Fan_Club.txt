Years ago our love was told  
Reminded those of love  
Like in a storybook  
  
Now were fighting every day  
This aint love This is hate  
Get it straight  
Take a break  
Storybook  
  
Years ago our love was told  
Reminisced and kissed  
The fifties flame  
So weve been told  
Now were fighting every day  
This aint love  
This is hate  
Get it straight  
Take a break  
Donnybrook  
  
Pretty pictures of the queens themselves  
You had my 8 by ten on your shelf  
You sold me cheap  
And I cried for help  
  
You stayed with us through thick and thin  
You sat and watched with Quaalude and gin  
And clapped a lot  
  
Were you there  
When we were almost crucified and died  
A thousand deaths  
No  
Well thanks a lot  
  
4 kings with an army strong  
You knew the words to all our songs  
You stayed with us all night long  
  
Pretty pictures of the queens themselves  
You had my 8 by ten on your shelf  
You sold me cheap  
And I cried for help  
Well thanks a lot
