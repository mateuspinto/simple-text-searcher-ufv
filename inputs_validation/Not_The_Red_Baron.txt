Not the Red Baron  
Not Charlie Brown  
Think I got the message figured  
Another pilot down  
And are their devils with halos  
In beautiful capes  
Taking them into the flames  
  
Not Judy G  
Not Jean Jean with a hallowed  
Heart  
I see that screen go  
Down in the flames  
With every step with every beautiful heel  
Pointed  
  
Not the Red Baron Im sure  
Not Charlie Browns wonderful dog  
Not anyone I really know  
Just another pilot down  
Maybe Ill just sing him a last  
Little sound many there know some girls  
With red ribbons  
The prettiest  
Red  
Ribbons
