You couldnt change it if you tried  
Sometimes it seems oh darling  
It seems that you were born to cry  
Trying for so long  
But your sweet sweet love keeps going wrong  
  
Take a chance take a chance on a  
Lonely love from a lonely loving boy  
Oh darling try a lonely love from a lonely loving boy  
  
You been let down time after time  
And now Im begging you please please please  
Try to put your little heart back on the line  
Forget those tears you cried  
Leave them to the falling rain outside  
  
Take a chance take a chance on a  
Lonely love from a lonely loving boy  
Try a lonely love from a lonely loving boy  
  
Forget those tears you cried  
Leave them to the falling rain outside  
Take a chance take a chance on a  
Lonely love from a lonely loving boy  
Oh please try a lonely love from a lonely loving boy  
Try a lonely love from a lonely loving boy
