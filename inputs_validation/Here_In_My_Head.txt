In my head I found you there  
And running around and following me  
But you dont dare  
But I find that I have now more  
Than I ever wanted to  
  
So maybe Thomas Jefferson wasnt born  
In your backyard like you have said and  
Maybe Im just the horizon you run to when she has left  
You there you are here in my head and  
Running around and calling me come back  
Ill show you the roses that brush off the snow and  
Open their petals again and again and you know that  
Apple green ice cream can melt in your hands I cant so I  
  
Held your hand at the fair and  
Even forgot what time it was  
And even Thomas Jefferson wasnt born  
In your backyard like you have said and  
Maybe Im just the horizon you run to  
When she has left you and me here alone on the floor  
Youre counting my feathers as the bells toll  
You see the bow and belt and the girl from the south all  
Favorites of mine you know then all well  
And spring brings fresh little puddles that makes it all clear makes it all  
Do you know what this is doing to me  
Here in my head
