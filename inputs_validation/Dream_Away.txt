Midnight sunshine silent thunder

Waking while youre still deep sleeping  
Finding youre not here  
Watching a dream appear  
Tumbling through a thousand centuries  
You dont know where youll land  
Its so dark in mythology  
Treasures of history to be found  
Near the legends of time  
All the handiworks remain there  
Only a dream away  
Oh Ry In Eye Ay  Oh Ry In Eye Ay  
Oh Ry In Eye Key Ooh Lay  
Ka Lay Ooh Lau Ee  Oh Ry In Eye Ay

Greedy feeling wheeling dealing  
Losing what you won  
See the dream come undone  
Stumble you may with the elementary  
Lucky you got so far  
All you owe is apologies  
Measure the mystery and astound  
Without taking up time  
So the handiworks remain there  
Only a dream away  
Oh Ry In Eye Ay  Oh Ry In Eye Ay  
Oh Ry In Eye Key Ooh Lay  
Ka Lay Ooh Lau Ee  Oh Ry In Eye Ay

In out hot cold up down young old  
What a lot to do  
Sharing a dream with you  
Oh Ry In Eye Ay  Oh Ry In Eye Ay  
Oh Ry In Eye Key Ooh Lay  
Ka Lay Ooh Lau Ee  Oh Ry In Eye
