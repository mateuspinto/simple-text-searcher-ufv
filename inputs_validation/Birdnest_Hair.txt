Birdnest hair so slips the dream  
A paper boat in heavy seas  
Into thin air lost upon on the tidal stream  
Another year  
But I dont care  
Birdnest hair  
Her resolve  
Her retribution  
Hands are tied  
Dissolution  
Its just me here  
Fetal postition  
Make up your mind  
Make a decision  
Birdnest hair the frozen breath  
Of butterflies she dissapears  
Into thin air the falling star  
Slips from my hand Im out of here  
But I dont care  
Birdnest hair  
Her resolve  
Her retribution  
Sticks and stones  
Dissolution  
Hands are tied  
Fetal position  
Is that the time  
I must be leaving
