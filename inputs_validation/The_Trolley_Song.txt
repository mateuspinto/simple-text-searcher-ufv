With my high starchedcollar and my hightopped shoes  
And my hair piled high upon my head  
I went to lose a jolly hour on the trolley  
And lost my heart instead  
With his light brown derby and his bright green tie  
He was quite the handsomest of men  
I started to yen so I counted to ten  
Then I counted to ten again  
  
Clang clang clang went the trolley  
Ding ding ding went the bell  
Zing zing zing went my heart strings  
From the moment I saw him I fell  
Chug chug chug went the motor  
Bump bump bump went the brake  
Thump thump thump went my heart strings  
When he smiled I could feel the car shake  
He tipped his hat and took a seat  
He said he hoped he hadnt stepped upon my feet  
He asked my name I held my breath  
I couldnt speak because he scared me half to death  
  
Chug chug chug went the motor  
Pop pop pop went the wheels  
Stop stop stop went my heart strings  
As he started to go then I started to know how it feels  
When the universe reels  
  
The day was bright the air was sweet  
The smell of honeysuckle charmed you off your feet  
You tried to sing but couldnt squeak  
In fact you loved him so you couldnt even speak  
  
Buzz buzz buzz went the buzzer  
Plop plop plop went the wheels  
Stop stop stop went my heart strings  
As he started to leave  
I took hold of his sleeve with my hand  
And as if it were planned  
He stayed on with me and it was grand just to stand  
With his hand holding mine to the end of the line
