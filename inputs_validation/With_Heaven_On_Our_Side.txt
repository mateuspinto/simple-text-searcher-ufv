Time our precious time  
In the beginning  
Your heart and mine  
I thought our love  
Was one of a kind  
I thought we were winning  
But I was one step behind  
  
Words I couldnt say  
The words that would keep you  
From running away  
But I shouldve tried  
Even begged you to stay  
I felt the tears of an angel  
Fall from Heaven that day  
  
I know I know  
Your voice keeps haunting me  
Come home come home  
Come on back to me  
I know it aint easy  
Youre part of me  
Youre the wings on my heart  
  
Can we give our love another try  
Can we keep our broken dream alive  
Now more than ever  
With Heaven on our side  
  
Can we give our love one more night  
I miss you angel can we make it right  
Now and forever with Heaven on our side  
  
This tender love slipped through our hands  
Two broken hearts could not withstand it  
Girl I know what I put you through  
If you need me now Ill be there for you  
  
And I know it aint easy  
  
Youre a part of me  
Youre the wings on my heart  
  
Can we give our love another try  
Can we keep our broken dream alive  
Now more than ever  
With Heaven on our side  
  
Can we give our love just one more night  
Angel baby shine your golden light  
Now and forever with Heaven on our side  
  
Give our love another try  
Can we keep our broken dream alive  
Now more than ever  
With Heaven Heaven on our side
