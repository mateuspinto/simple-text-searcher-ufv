Walkin down on main street  
Well its not the same street like before  
Those drinks that Ive been drinkin were stirred not shaken ooh its sore  
My legs have gone all weak  
Its so hard for me to speak anymore  
I must get home to bed  
And rest my aching head thats for sure  
Drivin in the country  
The grass is green as it was before  
Rolled up on that river  
Just aint as clean thats for sure  
You know my legs have gone all weak  
Its so hard for me to speak anymore  
I must get home to bed  
And rest my aching head thats for sure  
Goin down to main street to buy some wine  
Make some love with that woman of mine  
Drink some wine  
Love some time  
Ah walkin down on main street  
Well its not the same street like before  
Those drinks that Ive been drinkin were stirred not shaken ooh its sore  
You know my legs have gone all weak  
Its so hard for me to speak anymore  
Well I must get home to bed  
Rest my aching head and thats for sure
