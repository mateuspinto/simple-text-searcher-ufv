Forgive me my love  
For hiding my soul from you  
It seems easier for us  
If I dont show all of myself  
  
How am I gonna tell you how I miss you  
How am I gonna tell you how I need you  
Through pride and hurt and love and fear  
We lay an ocean between us  
  
Forgive me my love  
For closing my eyes to our love  
It seems easier for us  
If we thought this was just a play  
  
How am I gonna tell you how I miss you  
How am I gonna tell you how I need you  
Through pride and hurt and love and fear  
We hold an ocean inside us  
  
Let me take your hand  
And press it on my breast  
And you will know that  
The ocean is for you
