Buongiorno Teresa  
Like the sun you brighten up my day  
Good mornin Teresa  
Smile at me an send me on my way  
You sit by the tower  
The world rushes by  
Sell me a flower  
An straighten my tie  
Ill walk home this evening  
Through the lonely market place  
Ill sleep well Ill dream well  
Because tomorrow I can say Buongiorno Teresa  
I love you more each day  
  
Ill walk home this evening  
Through the lonely market place  
Ill sleep well Ill dream well  
Because tomorrow I can say Buongiorno Teresa  
I love you more  I love you more  each day  
Teresa  
I love you more each day  
Teresa  
I love you more each day
