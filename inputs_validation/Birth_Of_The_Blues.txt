Oh they say some people long ago  
Were searching for a different tune  
One that they could croon as only they can  
  
They heard the breeze in the trees  
Singing weird melodies  
And they made that the start of the blues  
  
And from a jail came the wail  
Of a downhearted frail  
And they played that as part of the blues  
  
From a whippoorwill out on a hill  
They took a new note  
Pushed it through a horn till it was worn into a blue note  
  
And then they nursed it rehearsed it  
And gave out the news  
That the Southland gave birth to the blues
