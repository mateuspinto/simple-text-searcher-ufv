Breathe and Ill carry you away into the velvet sky  
And well stir the stars around and watch them fall away  
Into the Hudson Bay and plummet out of sight and sound  
The open summer breeze will sweep you through the hills  
Where I live in the Alpine heights  
Below the northern lights I spend my coldest nights alone awake  
And thinking of the weekend we were in love  
The weekend we were in love  
Home among these mountain tops can be so awfully dull  
A thousand miles from the tide  
Put photos on the walls of New York shopping malls  
Distract me so I stay inside  
I wish the rocket stayed over the promenade cause I would make a hook  
And I can fish them from the sky  
My darling she and I were hanging on so take us high  
To sing the world goodbye  
I am floating away lost in a silent ballet  
Im dreaming youre out in the blue and I am right beside you  
Awake to take in the view  
Late nights and early parades  
Still photos and noisy arcades  
My darling were both on the wing  
Look down and keep on singing and we can go anywhere  
Are you there  
Are you there  
Are you there  
Are you there  
Are you there  
Are you there  
Are you there  
Are you there  
Or are you just a decoy dream in my head  
Am I home or am I simply tumbling all alone  
I am floating away  
Floating away  
Lost in a silent ballet  
Silent ballet  
Im dreaming youre out in the blue and I am right beside you  
Awake to take in the view  
Late nights and early parades  
Early parades  
Still photos and noisy arcades  
Noisy arcades  
My darling were both on the wing look down and keep on singing  
And we can go anywhere  
Are you there  
Are you there  
Are you there  
Are you there  
Are you there  
Are you there  
Are you there  
Are you there
