Im standin at the doorway  
My head bowed in my hands  
Not knowin where to sit  
Not knowin where I stand  
My father looms above me  
For him there is no rest  
My mothers arms enfold me  
And hold me to her breast  
They say you been out wanderin  
They say you travelled far  
Sit down young stranger  
And tell us who you are  
The room has all gone misty  
My thoughts are all in spin  
Sit down young stranger  
And tell us where you been  
Well Ive been up to the mountain  
Ive walked down by the sea  
I never questioned no one  
And no one questioned me  
My love was given freely  
And oftimes was returned  
I never came to borrow  
I only came to learn  
Sometimes it did get lonely  
But it taught me how to cry  
And laughter came too easy  
For life to pass me by  
I never had a dollar  
That I didnt earn with pride  
Cause I had a million daydreams  
To keep me satisfied  
And will you gather daydreams  
Or will you gather wealth  
How can you find your fortune  
When you cannot find yourself  
My mothers eyes grow misty  
Theres a tremblin in her hand  
Sit down young stranger  
I do not understand  
And will you try and tell us  
Youve been too long at school  
That knowledge is not needed  
That power does not rule  
That war is not the answer  
That young men should not die  
Sit down young stranger  
I wait for your reply  
The answer is not easy  
For souls are not reborn  
To wear the crown of peace  
You must wear the crown of thorns  
If Jesus had a reason  
Im sure He would not tell  
They treated Him so badly  
How could He wish them well  
The parlor now is empty  
Theres nothin left to say  
My father has departed  
My mothers gone to pray  
Theres rockets in the meadows  
And ships out on the sea  
The answers in the forest  
Are carved upon a tree  
John loves Mary  
Does anyone love me
