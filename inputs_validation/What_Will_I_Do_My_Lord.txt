Let me know oh my God  
What I am supposed to do  
I hope you dont mind  
My asking you  
I beg you to heal me  
My body and my soul  
You are my hope  
My everything my all  
  
What will I do my Lord  
Help me to see  
What heart to thee  
Let me fallow the plan  
Your divine plan for me  
What will I do my lord  
Help me to see  
  
Let me know oh my God  
What am I supposed to do  
Just show me the way  
Ill follow you  
I now I ask you to help me  
Take away all my fears  
Come to my heart  
Please take away my tears
