Men are armed shout who goes there  
We have journeyed far from here  
Armed with bibles make us swear  
  
Candy and taffy hope we both are well  
Please come see me in the citadel  
  
Flags are flying dollar bills  
Round the heights of concrete hills  
You can see the pinnacles  
  
Candy and taffy hope we both are well  
Please come see me in the citadel  
  
In the streets are many walls  
Hear the peasants come and crawl  
You can hear their lovers call  
  
Candy and taffy hope we both are well  
Please come see me in the citadel  
  
Screaming people fly so fast  
In their shiny metal cars  
Through the woods of steel and glass  
  
Candy and taffy hope we both are well  
Please come see me in the citadel
