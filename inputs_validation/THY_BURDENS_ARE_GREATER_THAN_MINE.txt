Travelin down a lonely highway  
I knew not where the road would end  
Not a penny in my pocket  
All a lone without a friend  
In a little country village  
I met a man and he was blind  
As I helped him cross the highway  
Oh lord I cried thy burdens are greater than mine  
  
I can see the light of day  
I need not feel my way  
Yes thy burdens are greater than mine  
  
Met a lad while on my travels  
Tryin hard to play the game  
Though his leg was very crippled  
And he could not speak his name  
Yet he smiled in understandin  
Though life to him had been unkind  
And as I watched I cried in sorrow  
Oh lord his burdens are greater than mine  
  
I can speak my name aloud  
Make my way among the crowd  
Yes his burdens are greater than mine  
  
Just by chance I passed a graveyard  
I saw a young man kneelin there  
In his hand there were some roses  
On his lips there was a prayer  
On a stone these words were written  
Your soul is gods your memry mine  
And as I watched I cried in sorrow  
Oh lord I see his burdens are greater than mine
