I can hear so much in your sighs  
And I can see so much in your eyes  
There are words we both could say  
  
Dont talk put your head on my shoulder  
Come close close your eyes and be still  
Dont talk take my hand and let me hear your heart beat  
  
Being here with you feels so right  
We could live forever tonight  
Lets not think about tomorrow  
  
And dont talk put your head on my shoulder  
Come close close your eyes and be still  
Dont talk take my hand and listen to my heart beat  
Listen  
Listen  
Listen  
  
Dont talk put your head on my shoulder  
Dont talk close your eyes and be still  
Dont talk put your head on my shoulder  
Dont talk close your eyes and be still
