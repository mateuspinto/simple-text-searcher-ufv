Where is your mother  
Where is your father  
Two little children  
Locked in the cupboard  
Into the wide world  
High on the high wire  
  
What would you give to fly away  
Away away away away  
Girl with the flower  
Boy with the hammer  
Lost in a forest  
On another planet  
Find me the exit  
Find them the way home  
  
Find all the love they took away  
Away away away away  
Cause your head is a brick wall  
And your heart is a football  
And your eyes broken windows  
When you cry  
Its a good day to die  
  
And your head is a brick wall  
And your heart is a football  
And your eyes broken windows  
When you cry its a good day  
  
Cause your head is a brick wall  
And your heart is a football  
And your eyes  
Its a good day to die  
To die  
To die  
To die
