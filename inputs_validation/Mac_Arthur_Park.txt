Spring was never waiting for us girl it ran one step ahead as we followed in
the dance  
Tween the parted pages and were pressed  
In loves hot fevered iron like a stripped pair of pants  
I recall the yellow cotton dress  
Foaming like a wave on the ground around your knees  
And birds like tender babies in your hands  
And the old man playing checkers by the trees  
Mac Arturh Park is melting in the dark all the sweet green icing flowing down  
Someone left the cake out in the rain  
I dont think that I can take it cause it took so long to bake it  
And Ill never had that recipe again oh no  
  
There will be another songs for me for I will sing it  
There will be another dream for me someone will bring it  
Ill drink the wine while it is warm and never let you catch me looking in the
sun  
But after all the loves of my life after all the loves of my life youll still
be the one  
I will take my life into my hands and I will use it  
I will win the worship in their eyes and I will lose it  
I will have the things that I desire  
And my passions flow like rivers through the sky  
But after all the loves of my life oh after all the loves of my life  
Ill be thinking of you and wondering why  
Mac Arturh Park is melting
