Yo first of all son peep the arson  
Many brothers I be sparkin and bustin mad light inside the dark  
Call me dough snatcher just the brother for the rapture  
I hand glide holdin on strong hard to capture  
Extravagant RZA bake the track and its militant  
Then I react like a convict and start killin shit  
  
Its manifested the Gods work like appliances  
Dealin in my cypher I revolve around sciences  
The ninth chamber leave you trapped inside my hallway  
You try to flee but you got clamped by the doorway  
  
No question I send your ass back right to the essence  
Your whole frame is smothered in dirt now how you restin  
While Ill be trapped by sounds locked behind loops  
Throwin niggaz off airplanes and the cash rules  
  
Everything around too black as you can see  
Swallow this murder one verse like God degree  
Then analyze this soundtrack with satisfaction  
You adapt like a flashback chain reaction
