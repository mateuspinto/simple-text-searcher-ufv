Some people call me the Creeper  
Cause they dont know my name or face  
I got em running in circles  
Because a homicidal genius never leaves a trace  
Im a lonely hunter  
City full of game  
Walkin in the neon lights  
  
Chorus  
Chop chop chop engine of destruction  
Chop chop chop a perfect killing machine  
Chop chop chop its a symbiotic function  
Chop chop chop I keep the city so clean  
Chop chop chop  
  
Some people call me the Ripper  
Stole my modus operandi from the movie screen  
Shes just a celluloid stripper  
Just another bloody player in my splatterfilled dream  
Women on the streets  
Want money when we meet  
I take them for a little ride  
  
Chorus  
  
She was standing on the corner  
With her bright red lips  
Her face was so white and pale so pale  
She had a black leather skirt  
That was tight to her hips  
And an anklet with a name  
It spelled MARY Gail  
Gail Gail Gail Gail  
Gail Gail Gail Gail
