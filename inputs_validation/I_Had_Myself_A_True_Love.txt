I had myself a true love  
A true love who was something to see  
I had myself a true love  
At least thats what I kept on telling me  
  
The first thing in the morning  
I still try to think of a way to be with him  
Some part of the evening  
And thats the way I live through the day  
  
I had myself a true love but now hes gone  
And left me for good  
The lord knows I dont hear those back yard  
Whispers going round the neighborhood  
  
There maybe a lot of things I miss  
A lot of things I dont know  
But I do know this now I aint got no love  
And once upon a time I had a true love  
  
In the evening in the doorway  
While I stand there and wait for his coming  
With the house swept and the clothes hung  
And a pot on the stove where I had meal  
  
Where is he while I waste the rising newel  
Where is he Whyd he gone so soon  
Now there aint no way that it used to be what now  
And everybody keeps telling me  
  
There are may be a lot of things I miss  
A lot of things I dont know  
But I do know this now  
I aint got no love  
  
And once upon a time I had a true love
