When the shirt came off it was all in time  
When a minute turned into a mile  
And then I broke that grin and I cut it out  
And you got all turned on by the taste of your sin  
When I mention blue all you thought was color  
When you mention drugs all I thought was sober  
When your pants came off and I turned you over  
When you mention blue  
  
Kill smile cut it out for me this time  
Smile havent seen him smile in awhile  
  
Keep the mask aligned  
Get it up in time  
Theres a space between valleys  
and try and catch a vibe  
Make a circle square a rectangle curve  
Use a smile as a noun and I think like a verb  
Run quick switch sides  
Spill the filled up canister  
And the room is shaking  
Now youre changing places  
and I switched my pace  
and my breathing races when you mention blue  
  
Kill smile cut it out for me this time  
Smile havent seen him smile in awhile  
Kill smile cut it out for me this time  
Smile havent seen him smile in awhile  
You smile cut out for me cut it cut it out  
Smile cut it out for me cut it cut it out  
We cut it out  
Get down and stay awake  
Smile
