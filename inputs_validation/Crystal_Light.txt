Standin by the roadside views are in my hand  
Coat Im wearings blowing cold  
Turn my back to the wind  
Winter mists along the coast  
City lights close down  
Your empty station there  
Train line cuts the ground  
Train line cuts the ground  
  
Chorus  
Crystal light shinin bright  
Shine on down for me  
Good is even passin by dying not received  
Like a fool I hit that road took my time to see  
Life was only foolin there  
  
Cold crisp air it burns my lungs find it hard to breathe  
The hospital shut their gates I cant get me no peace  
Weaker people stand and scream stumble in the road  
Close my eyes turn off the lights  
Timeless found a dream timeless found a dream  
  
Chorus x2
