Hook  Quavo  
Dope on the scale man you never seen it  
Hundred band juug no you never hit it  
You never been on the road to riches  
This the story I tell so you pay attention  
Cold turkey yeah we had to eat it  
So I take that pot and fucking beat it  
You never been on the road to riches  
Take your pen and your pad cause you gonna need it  
Trap money me and my dogs spend it  
Your bitch me and my dogs hit it  
Drop the head on the Bentley then fall in it  
When we dropped Versace then yall did it  
They hate that we came from the Northside  
Then lived in the city got mob ties  
They hate that we came in with plenty juice  
Young nigga  first day of school  
  
Verse 1  Quavo  
Remember the days with the pocket rockets  
Turned the bando to a fucking hot pocket  
Its a million dollars in the corner pocket  
I just share the rock like Im John Stockton  
African diamonds Olajuwon Houston Rockets  
My niggas  then go up out it  
Aint no need to talk about it  
Megaton trucks it dont weigh enough  
Had to take out the plug he was switching up  
You mad cause your label do finger fucks  
Qc the label got mega bucks  
Gas off in the back of the spinner bus  
Say that you trapping really you got   
This is the life of the Hefty bags  
You know that them ounces dont weigh enough  
  
Hook  
  
Verse 2  Takeoff  
I came a long way from dropping   
Finessing the plug for his riches  
Wake up in the morning I go grab the spatula  
Walk in the kitchen and whip me a chicken  
Her wrist is a Masi my neck is a Bentley  
Blue Benjamins that can pay your tuition  
Lupe said that Activis been discontinued  
Double cup a nigga still be sipping  
Got a plug out in Mississippi  
Wrap it up ship it to Finley  
I trap out the bando dont trap out the trap house  
And whatever you with we with it  
Came a long way from that midget  
Money taller than a midget  
I keep the mac like a   
Mama we made us a milli we did it  
Fuck the negativity fuck the critics  
  
Hook  
  
Verse 3  Offset  
They hate that that money start coming  
And I be too fresh I call it double mints  
I was on the block you was on punishment  
Giuseppe stepping and my diamonds they compliments  
Qc my label and thats my establishment  
Supercharge my Bentley I call it Clark Kent  
Me and my niggas spread the butter margarine  
Foreign  got Raris I cut off the engines  
Now park it  
You can catch a bullet in your carcass  
100 band juug and you wasnt a part  
I took the plug off and we had a departure  
You telling a story bout me Im the author  
These bitches be choosing they digging my posture  
Whipping babies Im not talking bout toddlers

Little babies get  they call me stepfather
