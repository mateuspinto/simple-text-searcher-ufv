Inch by inch row by row  
Gonna make this garden grow  
All it takes is a rake and a hoe  
And a piece of fertile ground  
  
Inch by inch row by row  
Someone bless these seeds I sow  
Someone warm them from below  
Till the rain comes tumbling down  
  
Pulling weeds and picking stones  
Man is made of dreams and bones  
Feel the need to grow my own  
Cause the time is close at hand  
  
Painful rain sun and rain  
Find my way in natures chain  
Tune my body and my brain  
To the music from the land  
  
Plant your rows straight and long  
Temper them with prayer and song  
Mother Earth will make you strong  
If you give her love and care  
  
Old crow watching hungrily  
From his perch in yonder tree  
In my garden Im as free  
As that feathered thief up there
