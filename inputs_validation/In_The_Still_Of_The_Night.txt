In the still of the night  
As I gaze from my window  
At the moon in its flight  
My thoughts all stray to you  
  
In the still of the night  
While the world is in slumber  
Oh the times without number  
Darling when I say to you  
  
Do you love me as I love you  
Or you might lie to be my dream come true  
Or will this dream of mine fade out of sight  
Like the moon growing dim on the rim of the hill  
In the chill still of the night  
  
Do you love me as I love you  
Or you might lie to be my dream come true  
Or will this dream of mine fade out of sight  
Like the moon growing dim on the rim of the hill  
In the chill still of the night
