Raise sails head for the open sea  
With sails full of wind  our hearts  
Overflow with belief  
  
The guest for the grail to England  
We sail with our steel We  
Bring what was lost If  
Lives are the cost let it be  
  
Strong she stands  reaching her  
Hand Brave and grand On English  
Ground  we were born Proudly  
We return  To English shore  
  
Hail hail hail  
  
We march from the hills  
Down to London Town   
Join Raise your hand  or hide  
When we ride for the crown  
  
The sign of the hammer and  
The black winds blow through  
The night Long was our wait  
Our meeting with Fate is tonight  
  
Strong she stands  reaching her  
Hand Brave and grand On English  
Ground  we were born Proudly  
We return  To English shore  
  
Hail hail to England   
Hail hail hail  
  
Standing tall  one and all   
Light the hall   
  
Years have passed  Ive dreamed  
of this day  
As we raise our hands  we  
proudly say  
  
Hail hail to England   
Hail hail hail
