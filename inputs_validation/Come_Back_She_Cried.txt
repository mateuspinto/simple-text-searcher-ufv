I lied I lied  
Come back come back  
Come back she cried  
I lied I lied  
I tried I tried  
Come back come back  
Come back she cried  
I lied  
Oh oh no nothing to worry about  
Oh oh no nothing to worry about  
I lied I lied  
Come back come back come back she cried  
I walked out I walked out I walked out  
Down the drain  
Of something else I was in it  
So silly so unfair she stayed standing there  
Oh oh no nothing to worry about  
Oh oh no nothing to worry about  
I lied I lied  
Come back come back  
Come back she cried  
I lied I lied  
I tried I tried  
Come back come back  
Come back she cried  
Oh oh no nothing to worry about  
Oh oh no nothing to worry about  
I lied I lied  
Come back come back  
Come back she cried  
I freaked out I freaked out I freaked out  
Is the water as high as itll get  
Super wet mom told me  
Every chance I have seen  
Trying to get clean  
Oh oh no nothing to worry about  
Oh oh no nothing to worry about  
I lied I lied  
Come back come back  
Come back she cried  
I lied I lied  
I tried I tried  
Come back come back  
Come back she cried  
I lied I lied  
Oh oh no nothing to worry about x6
