If you believe  
Wont you please raise your hands  
Lets hear your voices  
Let us know where you stand  
Dont shout from the shadows  
Cause it wont mean a damn  
Now more than ever  
  
Now more than ever  
The world needs love  
Not just a slogan  
But the world needs love  
Now more than ever  
I cant stand alone  
Now more than ever  
  
If I was to buy you  
A diamond ring  
Make you my princess  
Would it mean anything  
Would you take me for granted  
And just curse my name  
Now more than ever  
  
Now more than ever  
The world needs love  
Not just a slogan  
But the world needs love  
Now more than ever  
I cant stand alone  
Now more than ever  
  
Who am I to say  
What needs to be done  
I am just nobody  
Another lost one  
Caught between whats left  
And what needs to be done  
Now more than ever  
The loss of love  
The loss of our dreams  
Its not too late  
  
Now more than ever  
The world needs love  
Not just a slogan  
But the world needs love  
Now more than ever  
I cant stand alone  
Now more than ever  
  
Now more than ever  
The world needs love  
Not just a slogan  
But the world needs love  
Now more than ever  
I cant stand alone  
Now more than ever
