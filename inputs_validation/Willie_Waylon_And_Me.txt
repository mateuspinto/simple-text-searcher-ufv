I heard The Burritos out in California could fly higher than The Byrds  
Roger Mcguinn had a 12 string guitar it was like nothing Id ever heard  
And The Eagles flew in from the west coast like The Byrds they were trying to
be free  
While in Texas the talk turned to Outlaws like Willie and Waylon and me  
  
Hey well that they say Texas music is in the make  
And weve been making music that is free  
Doing one night stands and playing with our bands Willie Waylon and me  
Oh Mad Dog  
 harmonica  steel   
They say The Beatles were just the beginning of everything music could be  
Just like The Stones I was rolling along like a ship lost out on the sea  
And Joplin would die for the future and Dylan would write poetry  
And in Texas the talk turned to Outlaws like Willie and Waylon and me  
  
Hey my name is David Allan Coe and Im from Dallas Texas  
They say Texas music is in the make  
And weve been making music that is free  
Doing one night stands and playing with our bands Willie Waylon and me  
 piano  guitar   
I heard The Burritos out in California
