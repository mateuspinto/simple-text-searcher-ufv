Fine man crazy man he cant see  
Sound of the sunset sound of the sea  
Why do the people always look at me  
Nobody can see that we are you  
We are you  
Shes him too  
Shes him too  
Fine man crazy man he cant see  
Sound of the sunset sound of the sea  
Umm hummm  
Umm hummm  
  
Solid brass statuary guards the door  
Used to come as one now it comes as four  
Somebody here just sent for more  
Red and yellow cartoons saying we need two  
We need two  
More than you  
More than you  
Solid brass statuary guards the door  
Used to come as one now it comes as four  
Umm hummm  
Umm hummm  
  
Somebody stole they mind  
Somebody stole they mind  
They way they cant find  
What is kind  
What is kind  
  
Somebody stole they mind  
Somebody stole they mind  
They way they cant find  
What is kind  
What is kind  
  
Fine man crazy man he cant see  
Sound of the sunset sound of the sea  
Why do the people walk away from me  
Nobody can see that we are you  
We are you  
Shes him too  
Shes him too  
Fine man crazy man he cant see  
Sound of the sunset sound of the sea  
Umm hummm  
Umm hummm
