Rose so red  
This Night of Hunters  
Find love instead of their  
Blood by your thorn  
  
Rose so red  
This Night of Hunters  
Find love instead of their  
Blood by my thorn  
  
Dark forces are out there gathering  
Dark forces are out there gathering  
Some hunt for power  
Others to invade childrens dreams  
Some hunt for power  
Others to invade childrens dreams  
  
They must pay this Night of Hunter  
Find love instead of their  
Blood by your thorn  
Find love instead of their  
Blood by my thorn  
  
Holy Father why not ask forgiveness  
From the land  
Spirit to spirit  
End this suffering  
Spirit to spirit  
Soul to soul  
They stole the dreams  
Of the children  
By distorting what love means  
  
Watching over  
Keeping watch  
Watching over  
Keeping watch  
Watching over  
Keeping watch over childrens dreams  
The ancient Seven Sisters above  
  
Tuning the frequency  
Keeping watch  
Watching over  
Keeping watch over childrens dreams  
The ancient Seven Sisters above  
  
Changing the frequency  
Watching over  
Keeping watch  
Watching over  
Watching over  
Keeping watch over childrens dreams  
The ancient Seven Sisters above  
  
Tuning the frequency  
Keeping watch  
Watching over

Holy Father you ask forgiveness  
From the land  
Sacred Mother you are released  
From your chains  
  
Spirit to Spirit  
The childrens dreams  
Must now be reclaimed  
  
Spirit to Spirit  
Changing the frequency  
Spirit to Spirit  
Soul to Soul
