I felt the rush of the Rio Grande into Yellowstone  
Ive seen firsthand Niagara Falls  
And the lights of Vegas  
Ive Crisscrossed down to Key Biscayne  
And Chitown via Bangor Maine  
Think Ive seen it all  
And all I can say is  
  
Chorus  
How bout them cowgirls  
Boys aint they something  
Sure are some proud girls  
And you cant tell them nothing  
And I tell you right now girls  
May just be seven wonders of this big whole round world  
But how bout them cowgirls  
  
Shes riding colts in Steamboat Springs  
Bailing hay outside Abilene  
Shes trying hard  
To fit in some city  
But her home is neath that big blue sky  
And the Northern Plains and those other wide open spaces  
Now adays there aint as many but  
  
Chorus  
  
Boy she dont need you and she dont need me  
She can do just fine on her own two feet  
But she wants a man who wants her to be herself  
And shell never change dont know how to hide  
Her stubborn will or her fighting side  
But you treat her right and shell love you like no one else  
  
Yeah how bout them cowgirls  
Boys aint they something  
Sure are some proud girls  
But you cant beat their loving  
  
And Ill tell you right now girls  
May just be seven wonders of this big old round world  
But how bout them cowgirls  
How bout em boys
