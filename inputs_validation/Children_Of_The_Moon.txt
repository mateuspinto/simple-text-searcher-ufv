Pay no attention to the writing on the wall  
The words seem Empty cause theres nothing there at all  
We let the wise men beat the Drums too soon  
We were just children of the moon  
  
No one to turn to  
Nowhere to Run to even if we could  
Too late to save us but try to understand  
The seas were empty there was hunger in the land  
  
We let the blind man lead the Way too long  
Easy to see where we went wrong  
Nothing to live for  
Nothing to die for  
Were Lost in the middle of a hopeless world  
Lost in the Middle of a hopeless world  
  
Children children of the moon watch the world go by  
Children children of the moon are hiding from the sun and the sky  
Children Children of the moon watch it all go by  
Children children of the moon are Blinded by the light in their eyes  
  
No one to turn to  
Nowhere to run to even if we could  
Follow the pilgrim to the Temple of the dawn  
The altars empty and the sacrifice is gone  
We let the Madmen write the golden rules  
We were no more than mortal fools  
  
Nothing to live for  
Nothing to die for  
Were lost in the middle of a hopeless world  
Lost in the Middle of a hopeless world  
Children children of the moon watch the world go by  
Children children of the Moon hiding from the sky
