Heaven it shines in the dawns early light  
In a movement out in the brush  
Far out  
Watering graves of the people who read in the book  
Of forbidden content  
Tragedy  
  
In a gentle way hear the angry hills  
In a gentle way hear them laughing  
  
Imagination under attack for the  
Pictures I cant even think  
I dont even know them  
  
In a gentle way hear the angry hills  
In a gentle way hear them laughing  
In a gentle way  
In a gentle way hear the angry hills  
In a gentle way I am laughing  
Yes I am laughing  
I am laughing  
Yes I am laughing
