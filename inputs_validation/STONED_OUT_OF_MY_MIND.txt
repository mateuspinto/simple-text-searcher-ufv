Baby when I found out you were lying  
Playing around and conniving  
Undesired tears I was crying  
Cause sugar coated as I was buying  
I was just a backseat driver in a car of love  
Going wherever you take me  
Dont know why I put up with the pain  
Cause no one else can make me  
  
Youve got me going  stoned out of my mind  
And when you led me to the waters I drank it  
But I drank more than I could hold  
And you took my mind off my body  
And now you want to take my soul  
  
Where can I run  
Where can I hide  
Who can I talk to  
Tell me what more can I do  
  
Youve got me going  stoned out of my mind  
Playing around with every guy in town  
Its funny I just cant put you down  
See my head  its spinning around  
Since the day you let me down
