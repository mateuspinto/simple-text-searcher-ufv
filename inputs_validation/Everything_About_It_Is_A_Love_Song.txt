Locked in a struggle for the right combination of words in a melody line  
I took a walk along the riverbank of my imagination  
Golden clouds were shuffling the sunshine  
  
But if I ever get back to the twentieth century  
Guess Ill have to pay off some debts  
Open the book of my vanishing memory  
With its catalogue of regrets  
Stand up for the deeds I did  
And those I didnt do  
Sit down shut up think about God  
And wait for the hour of my rescue  
  
We dont mean to mess things up  
But mess them up we do  
And then its Oh Im sorry  
Heres a smiling photograph of love it was new  
At a birthday party  
  
Make a wish and close your eyes surprise surprise surprise  
  
Early December and brown as a sparrow  
Frost creeping over the pond  
I shoot a thought into the future  
And it flies like an arrow  
Through my lifetime and beyond  
  
If I ever come back as a tree or a crow  
Or even the windblown dust  
Find me on the ancient road in the song when the wires are hushed  
Hurry on and remember me as Ill remember you  
Far above the golden clouds the darkness vibrates  
  
The earth is blue  
  
And everything about it is a love song  
Everything about it  
Everything about it is a love song  
Everything about it  
Everything about it is a love song
