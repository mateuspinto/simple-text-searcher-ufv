Turn on Im in a Fast Baby  
I Much you know  
 Take it Fast  
  
Some people been driving to fast  
Some people still having a gas  
But if theres one thing you gotta conceed  
You gotta know whos driving you car  
You get to fifth gear with your foot on the floor  
Or else youre starring in A Cruise Too Far  
  
Turn on tune in cop out  
Let it flow now mama  
Let it flow become a woman  
  
Some people been wasting their time  
Some people expanding their minds  
But if youve known love like the jokers before  
Then youre likely to be home on the range  
No more the Cowboy gosta flaunt his wares  
Hes been grazing on a different plain  
  
Its easy to see why theres a thousands of people  
Are regularily turning it out  
Its easy to find when you mess with your mind  
That youve gone beyond a resonable doubt
