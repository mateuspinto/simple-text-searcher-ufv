Last train to Norwich  
Summer days that blind your face will soon be dead and gone  
Better get it on  
Tuned to a day the babe against the world  
You took the best seat rather risk it when the chips were down  
Better make it long  
Schrodingers cat is dead to the world  
  
You say your cat sees in the dark  
You criticize the play and isolate the box  
I always knew you were a scientist at heart  
Just as the breeze with speed and build you sat upon the fence  
Clucking like a chicken making perfect sense  
  
Pass that gun hand me that knife  
Mans little monster has been brought back to life  
  
You say your cat sees in the dark  
You criticize the flow and isolate the box  
I always knew you were a scientist at heart  
I always knew you were
