Oh my Lord Please dont forsake me  
This is your child Im tired and sore  
Oh my Lord can you hear me  
I need your love my soul is poor  
  
I can hear the angels singing  
I can see those pearly gates  
Oh my Lord can you hear me  
I need a place where I can rest  
  
Oh my Lord I cant remember  
When I first said Come in my life  
For I have lived my life in darkness  
My whole world is filled with strife  
  
I can hear the angels singing  
I can see those pearly gates  
Oh my Lord can you hear me  
I need a place where I can rest  
  
I can hear the angels singing  
I can see those pearly gates  
Oh my Lord can you hear me  
I need a place where I can rest  
  
Oh my Lord can you hear me  
I need a place where I can rest
