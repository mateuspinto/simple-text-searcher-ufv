There is nothing that is wrong  
In wanting you to stay here with me  
I know youve got somewhere to go  
But wont you make yourself at home and stay with me  
And dont you ever leave  
  
Chorus  
Lay down Sally and rest you in my arms  
Dont you think you want someone to talk to  
Lay down Sally no need to leave so soon  
Ive been trying all night long just to talk to you  
  
The sun aint nearly on the rise  
And we still got the moon and stars above  
Underneath the velvet skies  
Love is all that matters Wont you stay with me  
And dont you ever leave  
  
Chorus  
  
I long to see the morning light  
Coloring your face so dreamily  
So dont you go and say goodbye  
You can lay your worries down and stay with me  
And dont you ever leave  
  
Chorus x2
