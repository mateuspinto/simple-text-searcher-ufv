Dont know present time  
Children of the other crime  
All my dreams are wasting now  
No more reason see the cloud  
As I watch you from the road  
Find it open Reason Man  
Find it open Reason Man  
  
Moving in theres nothing to see  
One look and youll always regret  
Thinking someone ought to hear  
If you listen and only fear  
Things were edging to the right  
See him laughing Reason Man  
See him laughing Reason Man  
  
Ever infected all the time  
Only boredom crime  
Blessed with the feeling we will break  
  
Now infecting Reason Man  
Now infecting Reason Man
