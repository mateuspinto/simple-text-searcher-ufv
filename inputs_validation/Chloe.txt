How come youre so understanding  
When I tell you all my lies  
And pretending to believe them  
See through all my alibis  
And I need you more than ever  
And I want you till the end Chloe  
  
How you handle what you live through  
I can never hope to learn  
Taking all the pain I give you  
Loving blindly in return  
And I need you more than ever  
I will always be your friend  
Chloe Chloe  
  
Chorus  
Chloe what you gonna do about me  
Chloe what you gonna do  
What you gonna do about me  
  
Youre the lifeline that I cling to  
When I feel like giving in  
When the dreams that I rely on  
Start to wear a little thin  
Then I need you more than ever  
And I want you till the end  
Chloe Chloe  
  
Chorus
