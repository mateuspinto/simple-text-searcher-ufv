Have you seen the old men  
That lean on the walls  
Of salvation halls  
In the streets of your town  
You cant have missed  
  
The vagrant  
He is the rubble  
He is the trouble you want to remove  
In the parks about sundown  
  
He makes his bed  
His shoes are a pillow for his head  
Have you seen the young men  
That look so old  
Theyd rather have the cold dark lonely road  
Have you ever wondered  
  
Why do they go  
Leaving the tv and the automo  
You can see them hailing trucks down the open road  
You wave your thumb and you hop on board  
You aint got no keeper you dont need a friend  
  
I betcha wish you were the same  
Yeah I betcha wish you were the same  
Have you seen the old men  
We lean on the walls  
Of salvation halls  
  
In the streets of your town  
Were just a little shady  
We get a little crazy  
In the streets of your town  
In the parks about sundown  
  
We lay our heads  
Our shoes are our pillow  
The grass our bed  
Dont need no keeper  
And dont need no friend  
I betcha wish you were the same  
Yeah I betcha wish you were the same
