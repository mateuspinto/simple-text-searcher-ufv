I used to know a girl  
She had two pierced nipples and a black tattoo  
Wed drink that Mexican beer  
Wed live on Mexican food  
Yeah I wish I could go back  
Yes back in time  
  
Esther used to be the kind of girl that you would  
Never leave  
Shed do anything to give me what I need for my  
Disease  
Shed do anything  
  
I can hear them talking in the real world  
But they dont understand that Im happy in hell  
With my heroin girl  
Yeah with a heroin girl  
  
Esther used to be the kind of lover you would  
Never leave  
Shed do anything to give me what I need for my  
Disease  
Shed do anything  
  
I can hear them talking in the real world  
But they dont understand that Im losing myself  
In a whitetrash hell  
Lost inside a heroin girl  
Yeah with a heroin girl yeah yeah  
  
They found her out in the fields  
About a mile from home  
Her face was warm from the sun  
But her body was cold  
I heard a policeman say  
Just another overdose  
Just another overdose  
  
Esther used to be the kind of lover you would  
Never leave  
Shed do anything to give me what I need for my  
Disease  
She would do anything
