Dear Eva Friedel  
Got a brand new needle for you  
You said weed was evil  
So we smoked it in the lobby in the hotel foyer  
It wasnt even noon yet  
We didnt want to peak too soon yet  
But when the sun goes down through the after glow  
The night is yours but your mother should never know  
  
Auf Wiedersehen Berliner Star  
You rock like a bastard plastered  
You should have seen her  
Everything we did was wunderbar  
Till God came between us and you fell for Jesus  
  
Eva tore my heart out  
I got wasted in action  
But you know that I am a sucker for  
Instant satisfaction  
Theres nothing more obscene now than seeing where Ive been  
But you learn you know to see the after glow  
Youve got to burn to grow but your  
Mother should never know  
  
Auf Wiedersehen Berliner Star  
You rock like a bastard plastered  
You should have seen her  
Everything we did was wunderbar  
Till God came between us and you fell for Jesus  
  
You were everything everything  
Everything to me  
You were everything everything  
Everything to me  
You were everything everything  
Everything to me  
You were everything everything  
Everything to me  
  
Auf Wiedersehen Berliner Star  
You rock like a baster plastered  
You should have seen her  
Everything we did was wunderbar  
Till God came between us and you fell for Jesus  
Everything everything everything to me you were everything  
Everything  
Everything to me  
Everything we did was wunderbar  
Till God came between us and you fell for Jesus  
You were everything thing thing  
Everything to me  
I still love you I do  
Everything everything everything now
