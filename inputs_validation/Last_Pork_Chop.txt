Well you know you get the hots for some gal you just cant stop  
Makin love six times a day better than pork chop  
Cause ones good as the other and you know what I mean  
Some of them like a little bit of fat  
Some of them like that meat just a little bit lean  
  
I like gravy on the side with hot and juicy lovin  
Brown sugar on top sausage warm out of the oven  
Sometimes you get to eatin Lord and you just cant stop  
Make me wonder to myself  
Why oh why why did I leave that last pork chop  
  
Well met this fine gal in the choir she sure could sing  
She said come down to my house  
Im gonna give you ham hocks and beans  
We devoured each other Lord her kitchen was smokin hot  
I had to jump up and open a window and I thought to myself  
Why did I leave that last pork chop  
  
I have been on a very strict diet of beer and scotch and love  
I was offered lunch break specials but now Im a fool for her  
Shed been serving that pie while I was gone punchin the clock  
I thought about that waitress down at Maxines and I said to myself  
Why did I leave that last pork chop
