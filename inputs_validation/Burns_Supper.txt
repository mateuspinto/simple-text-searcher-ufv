Richard Thompson  
  
Oh you speak the words  
Locked in my breast  
But its late for me  
Let an old man rest  
One more black and tan on the barricade  
To keep me safe from loving  
  
Well I close my eyes close my eyes  
To the cold flame of the Northern Lights  
Well I close my eyes close my eyes  
And I see you still in the shuttered night  
  
What a newfound friend is honesty  
To see ourselves as others see  
To see the shy boy inside the man  
Is that all I am just starved of loving  
  
Well I close my eyes close my eyes  
To the cold flame of the Northern Lights  
Well I close my eyes close my eyes  
And I see you still in the shuttered night
