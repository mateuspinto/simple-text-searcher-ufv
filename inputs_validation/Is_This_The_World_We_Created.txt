Just look at all those hungry mouths we have to feed  
Take a look at all the suffering we breed  
So many lonely faces scattered all around  
Searching for what they need  
  
Is this the world we created  
What did we do it for  
Is this the world we invaded  
Against the law  
So it seems in the end  
Is this what were all living for today  
The world that we created  
  
You know that everyday a helpless child is born  
Who needs some loving care inside a happy home  
Somewhere a wealthy man is sitting on his throne  
Waiting for life to go by  
  
Wooh is this the world we created  
We made it all our own  
Is this the world we devastated right to the bone  
If theres a God in the sky looking down  
What can he think of what weve done  
To the world that he created
