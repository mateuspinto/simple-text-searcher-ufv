Sometimes I dont know where  
This dirty road is taking me  
Sometimes I cant even see the reason why  
I guess I keep agamblin  
Lots of booze and lots of ramblin  
Its easier than just waitin around to die  
  
One time friends I had a ma  
I even had a pa  
He beat her with a belt once cause she cried  
She told him to take care of me  
Headed down to Tennessee  
Its easier than just waitin around to die  
  
I came of age and I found a girl  
In a Tuscaloosa bar  
She cleaned me out and hit in on the sly  
I tried to kill the pain bought some wine  
And hopped a train  
Seemed easier than just waitin around to die  
  
A friend said he knew  
Where some easy money was  
We robbed a man and brother did we fly  
The posse caught up with me  
And drug me back to Muskogee  
Its two long years Ive been waitin around to die  
  
Now Im out of prison  
I got me a friend at last  
He dont drink or steal or cheat or lie  
His names Codine  
Hes the nicest thing Ive seen  
Together were gonna wait around and die  
Together were gonna wait around and die
