Come all ye shepherds ye children of earth  
Come ye bring greetings to yon heavenly birth  
For Christ the Lord to all men is given  
To be our Savior sent down from heaven  
Come welcome Him  
  
Hasten then hasten to Bethlehems stall  
There to see heaven descend to us all  
With holy feeling there humbly kneeling  
We will adore Him bow down before Him  
Worship the King  
  
Angels and shepherds together we go  
Seeking the Savior from all earthly woe
