How could I be happy  
Without her by my side  
Without her smiling face  
At the sunrise  
  
How could I keep living  
With emptiness inside  
With no one there to touch  
At the sunrise  
  
She gave meaning to my words  
She helped me find my way  
  
The time I had to leave her  
Leave her all alone  
The way she looked at me  
Made me cry  
  
I know she understands me  
She knows Im feelin bad  
Until Im back beside her  
At the sunrise
