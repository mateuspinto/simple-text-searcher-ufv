Your face my door  
Havent we both been here before  
Sightless no more  
No vision so high  
  
Your touch my hand  
Suspecting that I understand  
Night stands passin  
Im askin your life  
  
Can this be real   
Can this be lovin feelin  
Can this be a dream that fades a morning light  
Can this be real   
Can this be lovin feelin  
Are you what you seem will you be real tonight  
  
Ouick turn long stares  
Is that a shadow or are there  
You feel so real  
But is this confusion  
  
Ooh your voice soft and low  
Comes in my ear and breezes that blow  
No choice I knew  
I ask my illusions  
  
Can this be real   
Can this be lovin feelin  
Can this be a dream that fades a morning light  
Can this be lovin feelin  
Are you what you seem will you be real tonight  
  
Night goes and days here  
I can still remember the taste of the tear  
I still face a cold stare  
The essence of someone is constantly here  
  
Can this be real   
  
I can almost feel your touch  
But youre not there  
  
This  and I need you in the end yeah oh  
  
Can this be real   
Can this be lovin feelin  
Can this be a dream that fades a morning light  
Can this be lovin feelin  
Are you what you seem will you be real tonight  
  
Your face my door  
Havent we both been here before
