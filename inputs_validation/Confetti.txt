Skinny little brats  
Walking down Avenue A  
Dangling their cigarettes  
Their Independence Day  
Tears like filigrees  
Wear them on their sleeves  
Nobodys main squeeze  
Its thirtyfive degrees  
  
Poetry of ordinary life is what I live for  
They just want to be seen  
They just want to be heard said  
  
Chorus  
My words are like confetti  
And you never pick them up  
They fall to the ground  
I need someone to lift me up  
  
So diaphanous so ephemeral  
And all those bad words  
They never learned in school  
Groovy like my mamma was  
In her black turtle neck  
She was so high strung  
She was so low tech  
  
Poetry and tattooed dreams  
And fourteen caret nose rings  
The children of elite  
Are trying to be street saying  
  
Chorus  
  
Chorus
