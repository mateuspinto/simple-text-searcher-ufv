Hometown lady leavin for the city  
Bags in hand shes boardin the train  
Her last look through the window I saw her eyes were as red as mine  
I waved goodbye but I cant believe shes leaving  
  
But a woman cant be highclass  
In a lonely farmers town  
And the son of a poor man  
Aint gonna turn your head around  
But if you ever get lonely  
Just pick up the telephone  
And the son of a poor man will bring you home  
  
Maybe soon Ill see her on some television show  
Painted lips and fingers singing for the world  
A fashion plate for sure dancin for your plastic world  
Call me up if you can but if not well Ill understand  
  
But a woman cant be highclass  
In a lonely farmers town  
And the son of a poor man  
Aint gonna turn your head around  
But if you ever get lonely  
Just pick up the telephone  
And the son of a poor man will bring you home
