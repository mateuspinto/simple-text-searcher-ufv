Black lung got you down tonight  
Saving it all for work  
Suha pins her arms to her side  
Watching her twin want to die  
  
I hate my body I hate the desert  
Please let me escape  
When will I be going home  
I hate my husband I hate my childeren  
Im going to hang myself  
When will I be going home  
  
Black hair got you down tonight  
Black love black cuts from your work  
Weep like the busted girl you are  
Wash down your hope in that car  
  
My name is Suha Im 25 years old  
Im going to hump a cop  
When will I be going home
