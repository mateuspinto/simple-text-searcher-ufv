As we drove on through the Finger Lakes  
Water shining at our side  
I was wrestling the demons in my mind  
But it seemed to me you were reaching for  
Some places wed never been  
Where wed leave the past  
On some dark road behind  
  
I will always come  
If you need me  
And I will never forget  
The things you said  
And in my hour of darkness  
You will come to me  
And I will raise up  
My worried head  
  
Theres a line between what might have been  
And where we stand today  
There are roads we both know  
We can never cross  
But a voice comes down from history  
And whispers in my ear  
Dont waste the time  
The time that isnt lost  
  
I will always come  
If you need me  
And I will never forget  
The things you said  
And in my hour of darkness  
You will come to me  
And I will raise up  
My worried head  
  
I have walked by so many rooms  
And watched you brooding in the dark  
I spent my youth moving round you  
Like a ghost  
But the years go by  
And the reasons die  
That kept us far apart  
Now the sun coming up each days  
What we need most  
  
I will always come  
If you need me  
And I will never forget  
The things you said  
And in my hour of darkness  
You will come to me  
And I will raise up  
My worried head
