Well I was happy here at home  
I got everything I need  
Happy bein on my own  
Just living the life I lead  
  
Well suddenly it dawned on me  
That this was not my life  
So I just phoned the airline girl  
And said Get me on flight number 505  
Get me on flight number 505  
  
Well I confirmed my reservation  
Then I hopped a cab  
No idea of my destination  
And feeling pretty bad  
  
With my suitcase in my hand  
In my head my new life  
So then I told the airline girl  
Well get me on flight number 505  
Get me on flight number 505  
Alright  
  
Well I sat right there in my seat  
Well feeling like a king  
With the whole world right at my feet  
Of course Ill have a drink  
  
Well suddenly I saw  
That we never ever would arrive  
He put the plane down in the sea  
The end of flight number 505  
The end of flight number 505  
Alright  
  
Whew they put the plane down in the sea  
The end of flight number 505  
The end of flight number 505
