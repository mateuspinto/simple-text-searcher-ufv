While the storm clouds gather far across the sea  
Let us swear allegiance to a land thats free  
Let us all be grateful for a land so fair  
As we raise our voices in a solemn prayer  
  
God bless America land that I love  
Stand beside her and guide her  
Through the night with a light from above  
From the mountains to the prairies  
To the oceans white with foam  
God bless America  
My home sweet home
