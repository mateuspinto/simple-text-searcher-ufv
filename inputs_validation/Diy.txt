Warmongers kill yourselves  
Demonstrate the power of the product  
That youre trying to sell  
Gun wavers shoot yourselves  
Make a big hole in your head with a shiny shell  
Whats wrong with that kind of vision  
Whats wrong with that kind of world  
If I suffered less from indecision  
Id stand on that platform myself  
Chickenhawks theres a cell  
Down in hell where you may fight aswell  
If I may paraphrase John Lennon  
Why fill this world with more pain and fear  
To every budding Mark Chapman  
I offer these words most sincere  
Warmongers kill yourselves  
Demonstrate the power of the product  
That youre trying to sell  
Gun wavers shoot yourselves  
Make a big hole in your head with a shiny shell  
Do it yourself
