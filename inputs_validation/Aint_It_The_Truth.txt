Aint it the truth  
Aint it the truth now baby  
Aint it the truth now  
What I say  
  
Eat watermelon  
Eat peaches and cream  
Eat ripe tomatoes  
You know what I mean  
  
Aint it the truth  
Aint it the truth now baby  
Aint it the truth now  
What I say  
  
Your majesty  
Your curvaceousness  
Your highness  
Your soulfulness  
  
Make love to me babe  
Make love to me  
Make me feel all right now  
Make me feel so good
