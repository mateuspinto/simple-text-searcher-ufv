Good Bye  
  
  
  
I remember holding on to you  
All them long and lonely nights I put you through  
Some where in there Im sure I made you cry  
But I cant remember if we said good bye  
  
I recalled all them nights down in Mexico  
The one place I might never go in my life again  
Was I just off somewhere just to hide  
But I cant remember if we said good bye  
  
I only miss you every now and then  
Like the soft breeze blowin on from the Caribbean  
Each November I break down and cry  
But I cant remember if we said good bye  
  
I recalled all them nights down in Mexico  
The one place I might never go in my life again  
Was I just off somewhere just to hide  
But I cant remember if we said good bye  
  
Good bye
