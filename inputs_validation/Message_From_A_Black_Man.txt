Melvin

But thats no reason to hold me back

I have wants and desires  
Just like you

You cant stop me now

Yes your skin is white  
Does that make you right  
  
Eddie  
Why dont you think about it

This is a message  
A message to yall  
Together we stand  
Divided we fall oh  
  
Dennis  
Black is a color  
Just like white  
Tell me how can a color determine whether  
Youre wrong or right  
We all have our faults  
Yes we do  
  
Eddie  
So look in your mirror  
  
Temptations  
Look in the mirror  
  
Eddie  
What do you see  
  
Temptations  
What do you see  
  
Eddie  
Two eyes  
  
Temptations  
Two eyes  
  
Eddie  
A nose and a mouth just like me oh  
  
Eddie  
Your eyes are open  
But you refuse to see  
The laws of society  
Were made for both you and me  
Because of my color  
I struggle to be free  
Sticks and stones  
May break my bones  
But in the end  
Youre gonna see my friend oh  
  
Temptations  
No matter how hard you try  
You cant stop me now  
  
Temptations  
Say it loud  
No matter how hard you try  
You cant stop me now
