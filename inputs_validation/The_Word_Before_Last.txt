Television You will notice that very appropriately Im lefthanded  
  
This man I saw  
Was happy then  
And then loved  
And on tv well  
But now he cried  
And he cried  
And of course he had to want to die  
But he watched him  
Which made it worse  
Of course of course of course of course  
  
You understand  
He didnt know  
That it was someone else  
Who looked the same  
A similar voice taken  
The clothes changed  
But the face retained  
  
Surrounded by  
Old imagery  
His brain bypassed  
The eternal moment laid bare  
No time to heal  
Continual pain continual pain continual pain continual pain  
  
I spent a bad day yesterday  
With a man and a picture of himself  
The tape was running and the tv turned  
  
Television  And described Mrs Thatchers first three months in power as
disastrous
