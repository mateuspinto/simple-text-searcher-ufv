From the coast of Ipanema  
To the Island of Capri  
All the way to Guadeloupe  
I will follow you wherever you may be  
From the moment I first saw you  
Knew my heart could not be free  
Have to hold you in my arms now  
There can never be another for me  
  
All I need is the rhythm divine  
Lost in the music your heart will be mine  
All I need is to look in your eyes  
Viva la musica say youll be mine  
  
Can you feel the heat of passion  
Join the dance and let it happen  
Put tomorrows cares right out of your mind  
As the music draws you closer  
And you fall under my spell  
I will catch you in my arms now  
Where the night will take us no one can tell  
  
All I need is the rhythm divine  
Lost in the music your heart will be mine  
All I need is to look in your eyes  
Viva la musica say youll be mine  
  
Gotta have this feeling forever  
Gotta live this moment together  
Nothing else matters just you and the night  
Follow on the wings of desire  
Now the rhythms taking you higher  
No one can stop us from having it all  
You are my heart you are my soul  
  
All I need it the rhythm divine  
Lost in the music your hear will be mine  
All I need is to look in your eyes  
Viva la musica say youll be mine
