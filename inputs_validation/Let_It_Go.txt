Spent the night with a friend of mine and a handle of good whiskey  
We picked guitars and talked about how the glory days we missed em  
And it didnt take too long to find the truth inside that bottle  
Cast asea so long ago was a message from my father  
  
You keep your heart above your head and your eyes wide open  
So this world cant find a way to leave you cold  
And know youre not the only ship out on the ocean  
Save your strength for things that you can change  
Forgive the ones you cant  
You gotta let it go  
  
Looking back now on my life I cant say I regret it  
And all the places that I ended up not the way Ma woulda had it  
But you only get once chance at life to leave your mark upon it  
And when a pony he comes riding by you better set your sweet ass on it  
  
And keep your heart above your head and you eyes wide open  
So this world cant find a way to leave you cold  
And know youre not the only ship out on the ocean  
Save your strength for things that you can change  
Forgive the ones you cant  
You gotta let it go  
  
Like a sweet sunset in Georgia let it go  
And like the fear that grabs a hold ya let it go  
La la la la la la let it go let it go let it go  
La la la la la la let it go let it go let it go  
  
You keep your heart above your head and you eyes wide open  
So this world cant find a way to leave you cold  
And know youre not the only ship out on the ocean  
Save your strength for things that you can change  
Forgive the ones you cant  
You gotta let it go  
Learn to let it go
