Beauty queen of only eighteen she  
Had some trouble with herself  
He was always there to help her she  
Always belonged to someone else  
  
I drove for miles and miles and wound up  
At your door  
Ive had you so many times but somehow I want more  
  
I dont mind spendin everyday  
Out on your corner in the pourin rain  
Look for the girl with the broken smile  
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile  
And she will be loved and she will be loved  
  
Tap on my window knock on my door I  
Want to make you feel beautiful  
I know I tend to get so insecure  
It doesnt matter anymore  
  
Its not always rainbows and butterflies  
Its compromise that moves us along yeah  
My heart is full and my doors always open  
You can come anytime you want yeah  
  
I dont mind spendin everyday  
Out on your corner in the pourin rain  
Look for the girl with the broken smile  
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile  
And she will be loved and she will be loved  
And she will be loved and she will be loved  
  
I know where you hide alone in your car  
Know all of the things that make you who you are  
I know that goodbye means nothing at all  
Comes back and makes me catch her every time she  
Falls  
  
Yeah tap on my window knock on my door I  
Want to make you feel beautiful  
  
I dont mind spendin everyday  
Out on your corner in the pourin rain oh  
Look for the girl with the broken smile  
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile  
And she will be loved and she will be loved  
And she will be loved and she will be loved  
  
Please dont try so hard to say goodbye  
I dont mind spendin everyday out on your corner in the pourin rain  
Please dont try so hard to say goodbye
