Patience shadow While youre sick theres no sight to see  
Little shadow little shadow  
To the night will you follow me  
Pardon shadow hold on tight to your darkened key  
Little shadow little shadow  
To the night will you follow me  
  
Closer shadow volume strikes still were cut free  
of this song little shadow  
To the night will you follow me  
Hey shadow stars break of dawn take a turn for stars to my fantasy  
Little shadow to the night will you follow me  
Little shadow to the night will you follow me
