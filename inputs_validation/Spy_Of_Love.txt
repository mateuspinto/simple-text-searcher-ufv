Have you noticed to this day  
How many times weve prayed and played  
Lifting lovers up and down  
It gets around in this old town  
  
Sleight of hand and sleight of mouth  
A dirty trick to catch me out  
I dont mind but what I say  
Use that magic for better days  
  
Standing above this moment  
Listening to all I say  
The spy of love will track me  
Will catch me  
  
Through the window I see a face  
That dirty face that speaks with sorrow  
You listen to the walls for clues  
Stand in shadows protecting you
