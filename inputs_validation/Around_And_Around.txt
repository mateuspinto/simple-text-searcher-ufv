Chorus  
Well the joint was jumping going round and round  
Hey realin and a rocking what a crazy sound  
Well they never stopped rocking till the moon went down  
  
Well it sounds so sweet I had to take me a chance  
I rose out of me seat Lord I had to dance  
Started moving my feet well a clapping my hands  
  
Chorus  
  
Well at twelve oclock Lord the place was packed  
The front doors was locked Lord the place was packed  
When the police knocked those doors they flew back  
  
Chorus
