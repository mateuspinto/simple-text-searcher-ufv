Come feed the beast within  
My teeth cut through this grin  
That the razors that can shred your heart apart  
Feel my dark sound begin to wash away the sin  
That made these bloodshot eyes start to spark  
  
You tore the skin of day till light went dark  
  
Now Ive seen the side of my soul  
Now Ive found what I was searching for  
Now Ill take you for a ride all the way to the world Behind these rotting
holes  
  
Let night pour through your veins  
As my voice leaves these stains  
Like the tears that never got to drop  
Let me devour your pain  
Till hurts to touch like crane  
And the words become a roof to shelter us  
  
My words become a roof to shelter us  
Now Ive seen the side of my soul  
Now Ive found what I was searching for  
Now Ill take you for a ride all the way to the world Behind these rotting
holes  
  
I I instill in me  
This worlds pressuring  
I I I can breathe  
All the insanity  
I I instill in me  
This worlds pressuring  
I I I can breathe  
All the insanity  
  
Ooh cruelty is our song  
Ooh sins are sins to wash off  
  
Now Ive seen the side of my soul  
Now Ive found what I was searching for  
Now Ill take you for a ride all the way to the world Behind these rotting
holes  
  
I I instill in me  
This worlds pressuring  
I I I can breathe  
All the insanity  
I I instill in me  
This worlds pressuring  
I I I can breathe  
All the insanity
