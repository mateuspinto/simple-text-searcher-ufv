Now there are three steps to heaven  
Just listen and you will plainly see  
And as life travels on and things do go wrong  
Just follow steps one two and three  
Step one you find a girl you love  
Step two she falls in love with you  
Step three you kiss and hold her tightly  
Yeah that sure seems like heaven to me  
The formula for heavens very simply  
Just follow the rules and you will see  
And as life travels on and things do go wrong  
Just follow steps one two and three
