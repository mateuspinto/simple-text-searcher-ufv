Lead me Lord  
Lead me by the hand  
And help me face the rising sun  
Comfort through all the pain  
That life may bring  
  
Theres no other hope  
That I can lean upon  
Lead me Lord  
Lead me all my live  
  
Walk by me Walk by me  
Across the lonely roads that I may face  
Take my arms and let your hand  
Show me the way  
  
Show the way to live inside your heart  
All my days  
All my life  
  
You are my light  
Youre the lamp upon my feet  
All the Time my Lord I need you there  
You are my light  
I can not live alone  
Let me stay by your guiding love  
All through my live  
Lead me Lord  
  
Lead me Lord  
Eventhough at times  
Id rather go along my way  
Help me take the right direction  
  
Take your road  
Lead me lord  
And never leave my side  
All my days all my life  
  
You are my light  
Youre the lamp upon my feet  
All the Time my lord I need you there  
You are my light  
I can not live alone  
Let me stay by your guiding love  
All through my life  
  
You are my light  
Youre the lamp upon my feet  
All the Time my lord I need you there  
You are my light  
  
I just cannot live alone  
Let me stay by your guiding light  
All through my life  
All through my days  
  
Lead me O Lord
