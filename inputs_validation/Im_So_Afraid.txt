I been alone  
All the years  
So many ways to count the tears  
I never change  
I never will  
Im so afraid the way I feel  
  
Days when the rain and the sun are gone  
Black as night  
Agonys torn at my heart too long  
So afraid  
Slip and I fall and I die  
  
I been alone  
Always down  
No one cared to stay around  
I never change  
I never will  
Im so afraid the way I feel  
  
Days when the rain and the sun are gone  
Black as night  
Agonys torn at my heart too long  
So afraid  
Slip and I fall and I die
