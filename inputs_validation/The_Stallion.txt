Stay if you want to dont be ashamed leavin is easy Lord losins the same  
Life is a promise nobody keeps lay yourself down girl rock me to sleep  
  
We were the wild ones proud in our prime me and the stallion Lord one of a
kind  
See how we run Lord see how we fall ridin for moonlight we done it all  
Well the daylight was dyin rooks in the wind she stood before me stripped
to the skin  
  
Next to my stallion she purely shown glidin the moonlight starlight and
stone  
The moonlight is silver starlight is cold waking to laughter shaking my soul  
She was running my stallion naked and free ridin for moonlight gone like
the dream  
  
So stay if you want to dont be ashamed leavin is easy Lord losins the
same  
Life is a promise nobody keeps lay yourself down girl rock me to sleep
