Fortyfive minutes  
Fortyfive cents  
Sixtyfive agents sitting on a fence  
Singing hey brother  
  
Look what we got for you  
Were gonna rope off an area  
And put on a show  
From the Canadian border  
  
Down to Mexico  
It might be the most  
Potentially gross  
Thing that we could possibly do  
  
Yeah little buddy gonna get your chance  
Make them pubescents all wet their pants  
Well record it live  
And thats no jive  
  
Hold it Stop it No No No No  
Bang went the pistol  
Crash went the window  
Ouch went the son of a gun  
  
Onomatopoeia  
I dont want to see ya  
Speaking in a foreign tongue  
Knock Knock Hello  
  
Can I come in  
Gee that was a wonderful show  
Oh you havent gone on yet  
Well how was I supposed to know  
  
Hey We got a great date  
Its really downtown  
Were gonna get the Grand Canyon  
To do the sound  
  
Its a boxing ring  
But it might be the thing  
To really put you in the dough  
Listen little brother dont ya get us wrong  
  
Why we even know the words to your song  
Just say I do  
And well lay it on you  
You You And me Me Me  
  
Bang went the pistol  
Crash Went the window  
Ouch Went the son of a gun  
Onomatopoeia  
  
I dont want to see ya  
Speaking in a foreign tongue
