Look out of my window  
See the world passing by  
See the look in her eye  
  
One more time to live and I have made it mine  
Leave the wise to write for they write worldly rhymes  
  
And he who wants to fight begins the end of time  
For I have riches more than these  
For I have riches more than these  
  
Desolation

Tell me someone why theres only confusion

Look out on the hedgerow  
As the world rushes by  
Hear the birds sign a sigh  
  
One more tree will fall how strong the growing vine  
Turn the earth to sand and still permit no crime  
How one thought will live provide the others die  
For I have riches more than these  
For I have riches more than these
