Doo wop bop  
When it comes to boys  
Mamma always said  
Never let any temptation go to your head  
Doo wop bop  
Oh but its so tempting so delicious  
When I kiss your lips  
When I feel your fingertips  
Cause ooh youre my love toy  
No batteries required  
Ooh youre my love toy  
Wind me up and I start to move  
Ooh youre my love toy  
No batteries required  
No no no Id be so ashamed  
Besides Ive got my reputation to maintain  
Must you be so darn persistent  
Tryin to make me weak  
Bout to knock me off my feet  
Ooh youre my love toy  
No batteries required  
Ooh youre my love toy  
Wind me up and I start to move  
Ooh youre my love toy  
No batteries required  
Doo wop bop  
Ooi ooi doo wop doo wop bop  
You are always on the sly  
When I see you smiling  
With that look in your eyes  
Whispering those little secrets  
You really turn me on  
Doo wop bop  
Makes me wanna have more fun  
Ooh youre my love toy  
No batteries required  
Ooh youre my love toy  
Wind me up and I start to move
