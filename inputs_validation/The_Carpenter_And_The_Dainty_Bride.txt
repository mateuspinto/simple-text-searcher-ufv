To the carpenter said the dainty bride  
The grass appears greener on the other side  
So lets clarify before we unite that the grass is never greener on the other
side  
To the carpenter said the dainty bride  
I pledge to you my love tonight  
But I will not hesitate to euthanize if the grass becomes greener on the other
side  
Said the carpenter to the dainty bride  
I would never do a thing to jeopardize this union I consider prize  
Grass never will be greener on the other side  
To the preacher man said the dainty wife  
He thought the grass was greener on the other side  
So I buried in his belly my butcher knife and ended these years of wretched
strife  
Said the preacher man to the guilty wife  
Though the law may give you twenty years to life pray forgiveness in the
Fathers eyes  
And the grass just may be greener on the other side
