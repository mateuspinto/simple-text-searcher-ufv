Well it seems that I was lost  
In intoxicated nights  
Following the trace of ecstasy  
With no future and no past  
Just the present was alive  
Like a prisoner chained on to a dream  
  
I was drowning in a feeling  
That obsession rules  
till the morning kills the creatures of the night  
And I read your lipstick message  
On the mirror of the truth  
Now that youre gone I realize  
Without you  
Lifes like a song without music  
Without you  
This world wont be the same  
  
I need your love every minute  
I need your love every day  
I need your love every minute  
I need your love come back and stay  
  
Well I know that I was lost  
In the nightmare of my life  
Following the flash of fantasy  
In a feeling that exploded  
Id left reality behind  
Addicted to the power of a dream  
Without you  
Lifes like that road that leads nowhere  
Without you  
The world wont feel the same  
  
I need your love every minute  
I need your love every day  
I need your love every minute  
I need your love come back and stay
