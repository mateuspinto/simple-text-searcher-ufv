If you want to ride a rainbow come with me  
And I will take you to the magic purple sea  
And maybe we will find a thousand sugar fish  
When you eat them they will grant your every wish  
And if you want your friends to come  
Then bring them all along  
If you want to catch a star then walk my way  
I will take you where the night is always day  
You can follow me if you really try  
Maybe we will find a rainbow to teach it to fly  
I will take you through the magic dancing wood  
And I will take you where the goblins are all good  
I will take you where the elfs and pixies do sing  
And I will take you round the magic fairy ring  
Bow your head and let your eyelids close on down  
Where were going you wont need to bring your frown  
You will find that all the things that I have said  
Will come true when you are lying in your bed
