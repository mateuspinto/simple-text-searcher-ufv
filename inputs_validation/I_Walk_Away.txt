You came  
Out of this world to me  
My life  
Parted like the red sea  
We flowed  
Easy between the rocks and stones  
Never seemed to stop us  
The years  
Ended in confusion  
Dont ask me I dont know what happened  
But I am  
A man with a mission  
Must be the devil I dont know  
  
Its hard to let go  
Of all that we know  
As I walk away from you  
Hurled from my home  
Into the unknown  
As I walk away from you  
  
Reveal whatever you desire  
To you it may be death defying  
Black day  
In the coldness of winter  
Black words  
Slipping off my tongue  
I say forget it  its over  
As a dark cloud covered up the sun  
  
Its hard to let go  
Of all that we know  
As I walk away from you  
The sun always sets  
With room for regrets  
As I walk away from you  
  
Give it to me  
Give it to me  
Your inspiration  
Give to receive  
Find all we need  
As I walk away  
  
Just a slave to ambition  
Tension your permanent condition  
So much youve always wanted  
Too much given you a sore head
