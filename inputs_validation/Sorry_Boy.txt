Take want you want  
Giving back a steely stare  
Eyes black as night I  
Can feel a shiver in the air  
  
Sorry boy  
Sorry boy  
  
Time everlasting  
As a mothers blood runs cold  
Blast everyone  
Theres no forgiveness  
When your soul is sold  
  
Sorry boy  
Sorry boy  
Sorry boy  
  
No one will be there  
To pick you up if you should fall  
Burned every bridge  
Your only friends  
The shadow on the wall  
  
Sorry boy  
Sorry boy  
Sorry boy  
  
Sorry boy  
Sorry boy  
Sorry boy
