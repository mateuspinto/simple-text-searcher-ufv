Hey now all you sinners  
Put your lights on put your lights on  
Hey now all you lovers  
Put your lights on put your lights on  
  
Hey now all you killers  
Put your lights on put your lights on  
Hey now all you children  
Leave your lights on you better leave your lights on  
  
Cause theres a monster living under my bed  
Whispering in my ear  
Theres an angel with a hand on my head  
She say Ive got nothing to fear  
  
Theres a darkness deep in my soul  
I still got a purpose to serve  
So let your light shine into my hole  
God dont let me lose my nerve  
Lose my nerve  
  
Hey now hey now hey now hey now  
Wo oh hey now hey now hey now hey now  
  
Hey now all you sinners  
Put your lights on put your lights on  
Hey now all you children  
Leave your lights on you better leave your lights on  
  
Because theres a monster living under my bed  
Whispering in my ear  
Theres an angel with a hand on my head  
She say Ive got nothing to fear  
She say La ill aha ill allah  
We all shine like stars  
La ill aha ill allah  
We all shine like stars  
Then we fade away
