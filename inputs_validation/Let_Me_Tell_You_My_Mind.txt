Some quiet morning let me let me tell you my mind  
Before the sun find you here beside me one more time let me tell you my mind  
How I want you to stay and never think about goin away  
Oh oh baby let me tell you my mind oh oh baby let me tell you my mind  
Crazy things keep a running through my head let me tell you my mind  
When my shoes are under your bed one more time let me tell you my mind  
Tell you of the thrills I find they will keep running through my mind  
Oh oh baby let me tell you my mind mhm oh oh baby let me tell you my mind  
If my mind could write the words to say let me tell you my mind  
Id read them to you some better day one more time let me tell you my mind  
If my story never ends and I never have you again  
Oh oh baby let me tell you my mind oh oh baby let me tell you my mind
