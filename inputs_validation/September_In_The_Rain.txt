The leaves of brown came tumblin down remember  
In September in the rain  
  
The sun went out just like a dying ember  
That September in the rain  
  
To every word of love I heard you whisper  
The raindrops seemed to play a sweet refrain  
  
Though spring is here to me its still September  
That September in the rain  
  
To every word of love I heard you whisper  
The raindrops seemed to play a sweet refrain  
  
Though spring is here to me its still September  
That September in the rain  
That September in the rain
