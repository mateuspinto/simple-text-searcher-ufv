When we were young the future was so bright  
The old neighborhood was so alive  
And every kid on the whole damn street  
Was gonna make it big and not be beat  
  
Now the neighborhoods cracked and torn  
The kids are grown up but their lives are worn  
How can one little street  
Swallow so many lives  
  
Chances thrown  
Nothings free  
Longing for what used to be  
Still its hard  
Hard to see  
Fragile lives shattered dreams  
  
Jamie had a chance well she really did  
Instead she dropped out and had a couple of kids  
Mark still lives at home cause hes got no job  
He just plays guitar and smokes a lot of pot  
  
Jay committed suicide  
Brandon ODd and died  
What the hell is going on  
The cruelest dream reality
