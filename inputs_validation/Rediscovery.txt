Oh what a beautiful night  
The stars are shining bright  
Ive not been feeling right  
Not been feeling right  
Ive not been feeling right  
Soon its gonna change  
Time to rearrange  
Stop this acting strange  
Found us a beautiful place  
Perfect time and space  
And now we can retrace  
Now we can retrace  
Now we can retrace  
All we have begun  
New oblivion  
Havin lots of fun  
Got to get back inside  
Dreams and thoughts collide  
Save you from this crazy  
Save you from this crazy  
Save you from this crazy  
Life  
Please be good to me  
Last chance to be free  
This mountain majesty  
This rediscovery
