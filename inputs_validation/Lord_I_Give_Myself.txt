Lord I give myself I trust in You  
Mighty God My Saviour  
And Your mercy and love overflows  
And my soul rejoices  
  
Lord show me Your ways guide my steps  
Lead me to You righteousness  
And the light of Your love  
Takes my fear away  
Cause I know You walk before me  
  
Oh my Shepherd  
You let me rest in Your arms  
You comfort me  
And everywhere that I go  
Im not alone Mighty God  
I know Youre with me  
And everywhere that I go  
Im not alone Mighty God  
I know Youre with me
