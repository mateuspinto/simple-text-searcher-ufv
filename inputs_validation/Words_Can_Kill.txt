Why must we fight  
Must we shatter sweet dreams  
The way we hurt each other night after night  
Its almost obscene  
Must we tear at our hearts  
Even now while were alone in the dark  
Lay your sorrow on my sadness  
Hold me close now stop this madness  
Love be silent love be still  
Now hush my darling words can kill  
Woman dont speak  
Seems like a year since weve kissed  
Just close your eyes and bring your lips next to mine  
Let me know I exist  
My love will not wait  
Take me in your arms before its to late  
Lay your sorrow on my sadness  
Hold me close now stop this madness  
Love be silent love be still  
Now hush my darling words can kill  
Words can kill  
Words can kill
