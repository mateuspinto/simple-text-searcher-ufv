When the sun crashes into your world  
Look around and you try and find your girl  
And youre daring too sick of what you see  
Out of town is the only place to be  
  
When your life starts to run out of juice  
Feel like dyin and you just want to get loose  
Prayin moves dont make much sense to you  
Seeing red before your feeling is blue  
  
Last exit Brooklyn last exit Brooklyn  
  
Going back getting out of this town  
Stretch it lean and mean it turns you around  
Take your dreams and stretch them out on the street  
Take your turn to get back on your feet  
  
Feel the wheels singin over the ridge  
Feel the song like Oakland take you  
All the time you knew you had the itch  
All the girls were glad to see you  
  
Last exit Brooklyn last exit Brooklyn  
  
Girl in ol V wont pray  
Dont give you a hard time  
All the girls from Brooklyn say  
Last exit Brooklyn last exit Brooklyn  
  
Do you remember the day you left the block  
Your mama said you would live to regret it  
Coming home coming stoned come in hope coming ready  
Are you holding steady  
  
Last exit Brooklyn last exit Brooklyn last exit Brooklyn
