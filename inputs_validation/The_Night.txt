Deep in the darkness slumber  
Endless sleep  
Nothing moves inside my funeral suite  
I feel the sun slip down as hunger strikes  
Waking like being born  
Here comes the night  
All my senses awakened  
By little demons  
Taste the human heartbeat  
Bittersweet  
Bittersweet  
Dont take long  
To get back in the groove  
Sharpen up you attitude  
Get down with the moves  
Dont look no stranger  
In the eye  
Walk across some trouble baby  
Just walk on by  
No tomorrow  take it right now  
In the night I walk alone  
In the night is where I belong  
Take my flesh  Ill give you my soul  
Hungry night keeps driving me on  
Neon concrete jungle  
Devour the weak the humble  
Hear the city nocturne  
Makes you burn  
Oh slip on into darkness  
Sharpen up your awareness  
Get your seven senses working tonight  
No tomorrow  take it right now  
In the night I walk alone  
In the night  thats where I belong  
Take my flesh  Ill give you my soul  
Hungry night keeps driving me on  
No tomorrow  take it right now  
In the night I walk alone  
In the night  thats where I belong  
Take my flesh  Ill give you my soul  
Hungry night keeps driving me on  
In the night I walk alone  
In the night  thats where I belong  
Take my flesh  Ill give you my soul  
Hungry night keeps driving me on  
On and on
