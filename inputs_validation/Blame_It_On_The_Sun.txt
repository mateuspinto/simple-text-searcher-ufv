Where has my love gone  
How can I go on  
It seems dear love has gone away  
Where is my spirit  
Im nowhere near it  
Oh yes my love has gone astray  
But Ill blame it on the sun  
The sun that didnt shine  
Ill blame it on the wind and the trees  
Ill blame it on the time that never was enough  
Ill blame it on the tide and the sea  
But my heart blames it on me  
Who poured the love out  
What made this bitter doubt  
Is peace not here for me to see  
Wish I could tell you  
But words wont come for me to speak  
But Ill blame it on the sun  
That didnt fill the sky  
Ill blame it on the birds and the trees  
Ill blame it on the day that ended once too soon  
Ill blame it on the nights that could not be  
But my heart blames it on me  
backgroundyeh yeh yeh ooh  
Your heart blames it on you this time
