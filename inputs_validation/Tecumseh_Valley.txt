The name she gave was Caroline  
Daughter of a miner  
Her ways were free  
It seemed to me  
That sunshine walked beside her  
  
She came from Spencer  
Across the hill  
She said her pa had sent her  
cause the coal was low  
And soon the snow  
Would turn the skies to winter  
  
She said shed come  
To look for work  
She was not seeking favors  
And for a dime a day  
And a place to stay  
Shed turn those hands to labor  
  
But the times were hard Lord  
The jobs were few  
All through Tecumseh valley  
But she asked around  
And a job she found  
Tending bar at Gypsy Sallys  
  
She saved enough to get back home  
When spring replaced the winter  
But her dreams were denied  
Her pa had died  
The word come down from Spencer  
  
So she turned to whorin out on the streets  
With all the lust inside her  
And it was many a man  
Returned again  
To lay himself beside her  
  
They found her down beneath the stairs  
That led to Gypsy Sallys  
In her hand when she died  
Was a note that cried  
Fare thee well  
Tecumseh valley  
  
The name she gave was Caroline  
Daughter of a miner  
Her ways were free  
It seemed to me  
That sunshine walked beside her
