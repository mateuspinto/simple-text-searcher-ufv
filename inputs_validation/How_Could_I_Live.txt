How could I live without You  
How could I survive  
Without Your love  
Without Your touch  
Youre the One that heals me  
And cleanses my heart  
And sets me free  
  
Now I come right before You  
With my hands lifted up  
With my heart humbly bowed  
At Your work on the cross  
As You hang there and die  
You were paying the price  
For my life For my life  
  
For Your love is higher than the heavens  
Deeper than the seas  
And all I want is You in my life  
No one else can satisfy my soul  
Can make me feel this way  
Only You Lord only You
