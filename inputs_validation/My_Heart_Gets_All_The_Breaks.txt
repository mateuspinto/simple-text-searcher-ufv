Just my hearts luck to be stuck with a fool like me  
The only thing I bring my heart is misery  
I cant hold on to you no matter how I try  
The only time your lips meet mine is when Im gettin kiss goodbye  
  
Someone always gets to hold you in their arms it seems  
While Im left to hold the back of broken dreams  
Will my eyes get all the tears and my head gets all the aches  
And my heart poor old heart gets all the breaks  
  
My heart keeps begging me to stay away from you  
It knows darn well youre only out to make me blue  
Everytime I think Im gonna hold you near  
  
Someone walks by gives you the eye and like a ghost you disappear  
Someone always gets to hold you  
And my heart poor old heart gets all the breaks
