Beyond two thousand in the future wars beyond the limits of our mind  
Central computer that control and know the simple weakness of mankind  
Humanoid living in a structured will walking in a lifeless path  
Motor with a need to kill need to kill need to kill  
Searching through the wreckages of molten steel and glass seeing all in infra
red and heavy in its mass  
Terminate exterminate the son of Connor Reese you must prevent the bastard
ever being born  
Stop at nothing kill at will but rid the earth of this small child you must
deter this fucking evil spawn  
Mark the dogs for only they know your not human your ot flesh at all  
Break the jaw before it speaks and kill the men that answer to its call  
Justified in genocide and leave them in theiir broken pride until they realize
that its no use  
Unsuspecting victim one guerilla fighter with a gun the terminators finally
been let loose  
Try to run but only they know theres nowhere to run nowhere to hide  
Cornered trapped by the death machine dont you go to sleep dont close your
eyes ah  
Beyond twp thousand in the future wars beyond the limits of our mind  
Central computer that control and know the simple weakness of mankind  
And still the armies of robotic men crushing the humans in their path  
Lifeless of pain and a void of sorrow create a crimson aftermath
