Calling Mr Oswald with the swastika tattoo  
There is a vacancy waiting in the English voodoo  
Carving V for vandal on the guilty boys head  
When hes had enough of that maybe youll take him to bed  
To teach him hes alive before he wishes he was dead  
  
Chorus  
Turn up the TV no one listening will suspect  
Even your mother wont detect it so your father wont know  
They think that Ive got no respect but  
Everything is less than zero  
Hey oo heyey  
Hey oo heyey  
  
Oswald and his sister are doing it again  
Theyve got the finest home movies that you have ever seen  
Theyve got a thousand variations every service with a smile  
Theyre gonna take a little break and theyll be back after a while  
Well I hear that South America is coming into style  
  
Chorus  
  
A pistol was still smoking a man lay on the floor  
Mr Oswald said he had an understanding with the law  
He said he heard about a couple living in the USA  
He said they traded in their baby for a Chevrolet  
Lets talk about the future now weve put the past away  
  
Chorus  
Hey oo heyey  
Hey oo heyey
