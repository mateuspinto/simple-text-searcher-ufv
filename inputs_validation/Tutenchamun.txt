Falkenhorstbeen and seen down flight from Chicago  
All aboard the African Queen  
I am on a night boat down to Cairofeeling like a tourist with a foreign man
abroad  
Tells it like he thinks it is but I know he is fraud  
There is a map tucked under his shoulder  
And a cap perched on his head  
If he looked any older he might as well be deaddressed in army surplus the
files around me swarm  
On a mission without a purpose I wish Id never been bornby the light of a
pale moon  Tutankhamen  
Half past high noon  Tutankhamenput you in the picture  1884  
Im up to date on the literature  
But I have never been here beforethere is a black boy on the corner trailing
me behind  
Stalking like a vulture money on his mind  
In the shadow of the giant sphinx the archeological tale  
Before the eastern sun sinks Ill be learning brailleby the light of a pale
moon  Tutankhamen  
Half past high noon  Tutankhamen  
They are playing our tune  Tutankhamen  
Half past high noon  Tutankhamenby the light of a light of a pale moon 
Tutankhamen  
Half past high noon  Tutankhamen  
By the light of a pale moon  Tutankhamen  
Half past high noon  Tutankhamen
