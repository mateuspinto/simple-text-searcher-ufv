Pardon me  
What a rare mood Im in  
Check the glorious grin  
And the bright eyes above  
Well excuse me world for being alive  
At last Ive arrived  
Ive fallen in love  
Ate with augustine monks babbled in tongues  
Climbed the highest hill in peru  
Took a walk on the ganges peeled the wraps of rameses  
Slayed me a dragon or two  
Turned saviors and saints and little green men  
Moonshine and miracle drugs  
But I never quite saw the light  
till I fell in love  
Pondered zen and zoroaster and the life ever after  
Blavatsky marx moliere  
Found jesus and siddhartha in a bar in djakarta  
Chatting where the air is quite rare  
Let solomon keep his philosophers stone  
Let jove keep his heavens above  
To my mind it aint near as divine as falling in love  
Im in love  
Pardon me  
What a rare mood Im in  
Check the glorious grin  
And the bright eyes above  
Well excuse me world for being alive  
At last Ive arrived  
To my mind it aint near as divine  
Not nearly as sweet and sublime  
As falling in love  
Im in love  
Pardon me  
What a rare mood Im in  
Check the glorious grin  
And the bright eyes above  
Well excuse me world for being alive  
At last Ive arrived  
Ive fallen in love  
Im in love  
Fallen in love
