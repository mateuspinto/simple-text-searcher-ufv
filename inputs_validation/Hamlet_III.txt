When the autumn leaves are falling to the ground  
When the air gets cold then I think of us  
Of you and I  
And it almost makes me cry  
So sad and kind of bitter sweet  
And the memories filled with tears  
And I feel my heart will break  
Guess it all was my mistake  
  
Autumns chilly winds were blowing through the trees  
The rain fell softly on your face  
Oh I remember every little thing about that day  
I remember every place  
Grey skies you were laughing at the clouds  
The rain fell softly on your face  
The memories of our time together cannot be replaced  
I never loved you more than on those happy autumn days
