The sky is changing  
The clouds are gathering we can see  
Its growing darker day by day  
But Im so high  
  
Within this stormy weather  
God is the wind could take my soul  
Even as I pray  
You with your lack of time  
  
Me with my lack of space  
Where are you my love  
Lost in your reckless dreams  
I tried to share your garden of Eden  
  
But temptation trims the wings of those  
Who only wish to know  
Denied  stop looking for a reason  
Its hard to face the time to fly  
  
Harder still to go  
You with your lust for time  
Me with my lust for space  
Where are you now my love  
  
Lost in your restless dreams  
And though were strong and tough  
Can our hearts open wide enough  
To recognize the faults  
  
And then to smile  
And though we tear each others hearts and minds  
We show no sense  
We can still have our innocence  
Like a Child
