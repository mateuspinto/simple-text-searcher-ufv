The wind is telling stories about us  
Writing words with sand and powder dust  
Deserted squares and lonesome trees  
The wind revealing stories about us  
  
Fall is telling stories about us  
Writing words with leaves and powder dust  
Multicoloured lanes of trees  
Mesmerising stories about us  
  
We all float  
Clouds of gold  
The mountains make the sun arise  
Your rainbow coloured eyes can change the tide  
  
We all float  
Clouds of gold  
The mountains make the sun arise  
Your rainbow coloured eyes can change the tide  
  
The river telling stories about us  
Writing words with water full of lust  
Yellow purple green or blue  
Drip by drip revealing things on you  
  
We all float  
Clouds of gold  
The mountains make the sun arise  
Your rainbow coloured eyes can change the tide  
  
We all float  
Clouds of gold  
The mountains make the sun arise  
Your rainbow coloured eyes can change the tide  
  
Mountains make the sun arise  
Your rainbow coloured eyes can change the tide
