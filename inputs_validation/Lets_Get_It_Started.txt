Chorus 2x  
Lets get it started  
Verse 1  
Now your party wasnt jumping and your DJ was weak  
Instead of dope beats he was spinnin them Zs  
All the fly girls who came with a beat in mind  
They all up against the wall like a welfare line  
Do you think for one minute that this is it  
Your party is bogus Yo it aint legit  
You better put on the hammer And you will be rewarded  
My beat is ever boomin And you know I get it started  
Get it started  
Chorus 5x  
Verse 2  
Now get up out your seat because my beat is so complete  
Im movin everybody from A to Z  
And when it comes to straight up rockin Im second to none  
From Doug E Fresh to LL or DJ Run  
They say hammer how you do it I got it like that  
My posses ever rollin We keep it in tact  
Just put on the hammer And you will be rewarded  
My beat is ever boomin And you know I get it started  
Chorus 6x  
Verse 3  
Now a lot of be boys make em dance Yo they fakin the beat  
They hip hop on the outside put rock underneath  
Before the show gets started They shakin they boots  
My posse in the end cold displayin the troops  
Like a trooper Im down cold hooked on the drugs  
808 SB12S are expirin africans  
Just put on the hammer And you will be rewarded  
My beat is ever boomin And you know I get it started  
Chorus 5x  
Verse 4  
They said it couldnt happen that rap wouldnt last  
The beat is in effect like the oil in your gas  
Cause its makin lots of money from top to bottom  
Whatever in effect Yo be boys have got em  
Nobody knows how a rapper really feels  
A mind full of rhymes and a tongue of steel  
Just put on the hammer and you will be rewarded  
My beat is ever boomin and you know I get it started  
Chorus 7x
