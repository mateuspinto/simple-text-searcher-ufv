In what other lives have I known your kiss  
And what forgotten moments have I felt like this  
The way you touch me I come undone  
You know me more than anyone  
Whatever you want  
  
In what other lives have I touched your face  
And what words did we whisper in a strange forbidden place  
To be with you baby is to find myself  
Were two of a kind you and I  
I couldnt love anyone else  
  
You are my beginning my end  
You are my lover my friend  
In this life in this time  
  
Whatever you want whatever you need  
I will be right here waiting baby baby baby  
Whatever you want whatever you need  
I will be right here waiting yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
In what other lives did I feel your skin  
And when exactly did I breathe you in  
Feel like Ive known you for a thousand years  
Youre so familiar to me and there is no fear  
  
You are my beginning my end  
You are my lover my friend  
In this life in this time  
  
Whatever you want whatever you need  
I will be right here waiting baby baby baby  
Whatever you want whatever you need  
I will be right here waiting yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Watch the sun go down yeah yeah  
My past and future in you are bound oh yeah  
I watch as time moves on Im alive and strong  
And when Im with you theres no right no wrong  
  
Whatever you want whatever you need

Whatever you want whatever you want  
Whatever you need whatever you need
