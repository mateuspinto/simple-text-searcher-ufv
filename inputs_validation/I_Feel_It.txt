Spoken  
Here we go again  
I dont wanna let you in  
But you know what happens  
  
When I when I  
When I feel it  
  
I feel it deep inside  
I feel it come alive  
Here comes that feeling again  
  
I feel it deep inside  
I feel it come alive  
Here comes that feeling again  
  
Keep telling you its over  
But boy here we go again  
You say Im coming over  
Cause you know Ill let you in  
So sly and so persuasive  
I dont wanna let you win  
But my respects diminishing  
And then I go  
When I when I  
When I feel it  
  
I feel it deep inside  
I feel it come alive  
Here comes that feeling again  
  
I feel it deep inside  
I feel it come alive  
Here comes that feeling again  
  
Keep trying to convince myself  
You aint no good for me  
Make futile resolutions  
That Im gonna let you be  
But everytime you come back  
My defenses start to wane  
And I can hardly break away  
And then I go  
When I when I  
When I feel it  
  
I feel it deep inside  
I feel it come alive  
Here comes that feeling again  
  
I feel it deep inside  
I feel it come alive  
Here comes that feeling again  
  
When I when I when I  
When I feel your love  
Here comes that feeling again  
  
Here it comes again boy  
And I feel it and I feel it  
Here comes that feeling again  
  
And I feel it oh baby  
Here it comes and here it comes  
And here it comes
