HONKY TONK WOMEN  
WRITERS MICK JAGGER KEITH RICHARDS  
I met a ginsoaked barroom queen in Memphis She tried to take me upstairs for
a ride She had to heave me right across her shoulder Cause I just cant seem
to drink you off my mind Its the honky tonk women That gimme gimme gimme
the honky tonk blues I laid a divorcee in New York City I had to put up some
kind of a fight The lady then she covered me in roses She blew my nose and
then she blew my mind Its the honky tonk women That gimme gimme gimme the
honky tonk blues
