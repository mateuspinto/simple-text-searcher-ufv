When you shut your eyes and fell asleep  
Dark clouds descended on the souls of the ones  
Who held you close to their hearts  
Close to their hearts  
  
My heart broke  
My heart broke  
My heart broke  
Open  
Open  
Open  
Open  
  
The beauty of an embrace a place  
To lay down the pain  
  
Where blood and fire bring rest and peace  
Where blood and fire bring rest and peace  
Where blood and fire bring rest and peace  
Where blood and fire bring rest and peace  
  
I sit away in a secret place the shadow of wings  
I think of you  
I think of you  
I think of you  
I think of you  
I think of you  
I think of you  
I think of you  
And my heart breaks open
