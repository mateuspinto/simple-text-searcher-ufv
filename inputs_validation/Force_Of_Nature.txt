Understand Shes a Force of Nature  
Contraband hiding deep inside her soul  
Exercising her will to lose control  
She lets go  
  
Common Man he dont stand a chance no  
One to love who allowed his in the hole  
No way to save someone who wont take the role  
And just lets go  
  
One Man Stands the edge of the ocean  
A beacon on dry land  
Eyes above the horizon  
In the dark before the dawn  
  
Hurricane has the trade winds blowing  
Gale force shaking windows in the storm  
Shipwreck from a love that he calls home  
One light on  
  
Somewhere theres a siren singing  
Solemnly he hears  
All the strengths you might think would  
Disappear resolving  
  
One man stands alone awaiting for her to come home  
Eyes above the horizon  
In the dark before the  
Darkness leaves the dawn  
  
Makes me ache  
Makes me shake  
Is it so wrong to think that  
Love can keep us safe  
  
Last I saw he was out there waiting  
A silhouette in the black light full moon  
In the sand there he stands upon the shore  
Forevermore  
  
Somewhere theres a siren singing  
Solemnly he hears  
All the strength  
That you might think would disappear resolving  
  
One man stands alone awaiting for her to come home  
Eyes are closed you cannot know  
But his heart dont seem to know  
Grow  
Home
