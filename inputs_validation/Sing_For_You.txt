One two one two three four  
  
Sweet and high at the break of dawn  
Simple tune that you can hum along too  
I remember there was a time  
When I used to sing for you  
  
Chorus  
Do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do  
  
I used to sing for you  
  
Chorus  
  
Knew all the words to the popular songs  
With the radio on full volume  
I remember there was a time  
When I used to sing for you  
  
Chorus  
  
I used to sing for you  
  
Chorus  
  
Forget the chorus youre the bridge  
The words and music to everyday Ive lived  
Theres nothing I wouldnt give  
For one more time when I can sing for you  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh Yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Soft and low when the evening comes  
Holding you sleeping in my arms  
I remember there was a time  
When I used to sing for you  
  
Chorus  
  
I used to sing for you  
  
Chorus  
  
I used to sing for you
