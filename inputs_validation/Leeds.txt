Its dark at 4 pm in Leeds  
The steeples pierce the skylight till the last of it bleeds  
The absent sound of another day as it recedes  
Into the shadows  
Until its nothing  
  
Fax papers slipped under the hotel room door  
Like food for the prisoner or the prospect to the whore  
Well fed and halfway drunk I ache myself for more  
Until Im shadows of myself  
Until Im nothing  
  
Sixteen black churches burning on the tv  
All the way from Texas to Tennessee  
And a politician locks my eye and says to me  
There is no crisis here  
Theres no conspiracy  
  
I crave inertia every move made so I can stop  
Whatever this madness is in me spinning like a top  
On a bed of anxiety over a deep dark drop  
Down into nothingness  
Into withoutyouness  
  
Was it ever so the evil creep like ivy  
A toe hold on the stronger half of natures dichotomy  
Im beating back a path through nothing more than pure insistence  
Until here becomes  
The distance  
  
Hold my head love Im sick tonight  
Find the open hole and press your fingers there with all your might  
Before the last ounce of my spirit bleeds  
Onto the pristine sheets  
Of the hotel bed in Leeds
