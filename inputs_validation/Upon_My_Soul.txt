Be my staple and my stay  
Jesus help through each day  
As I walk this weary way  
Upon my soul  
  
And when judgement falls to me  
Through my saviour shall I be  
Given peace eternally  
Upon my soul  
  
Upon my soul  
Upon my free and joyous soul  
Given peace eternally  
Upon my soul  
  
Jesus shine your light on me  
Shine with love and charity  
That I might help brothers see  
Upon my soul  
  
For temptation let me ply  
Be my wings Lord be my eyes  
Guard me when old Satans nigh  
Upon my soul  
  
Upon my soul  
Upon my free and joyous soul  
Guard me when old Satans nigh  
Upon my soul  
  
I shall fill each earhly day  
With the singing of his praise  
Follow in his holy ways  
Upon my soul  
  
And when I lay my troubles down  
On my brow hell place a crown  
And the trumpets all shall sound  
Upon my soul  
  
Upon my soul  
Upon my free and joyous soul  
And the trumpets all shall sound  
Upon my soul
