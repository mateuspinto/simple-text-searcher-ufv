Verse 2  
Now pull in the parking lot  
Nigga find a parking spot  
Fired up everyone want to spark a lot  
Puffpuffpass we out on Ave  
Lookin for a big fat ass to harass  
Is it you Uhhuh I see you lookin  
When we roll by pussy still cookin  
Freaks get taken when they lookin for stars  
If you dont like my face bitch look at my car  
Keep it simple I told you once befo  
It really dont matter how I get you to the mo  
It really dont matter how I get you in my low  
Just hop in lets go  
And let your friends know  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 3  
Do ya thang girl  
Fuck what they lookin at  
We the dogs gettin chased by the pussycat  
West Coast baby with so much gravy  
You should call The Navy ever since the 80s  
Ive been doin good they been doin bad  
When I see you walk by Im pursuin that  
But never chase it my game is so basic  
As soon as I lace it  baby wanna taste it  
Just face it put me to the test  
Ice Cube would ace it Im built for success  
Fuck a Rockstar We wanna party like a Rap Star  
In the club in the house or the backyard Yayyay  
You make it rain with ones I make it rain with huns  
And we get lapdance from nuns  
They put away they crucifix  
And they say Ice Cube boy you the shit
