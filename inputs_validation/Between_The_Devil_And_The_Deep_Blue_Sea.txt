I dont want you  
But I hate to lose you  
You got me in between  
The devil and the deep blue sea  
  
I forgive you  
Cause I cant forget you  
You got me in between  
The devil and the deep blue sea  
  
I ought to cross you off my list  
But when you come a knockin at my door  
Fate seems to give my heart a twist  
And I keep runnin back for more  
  
I should hate you  
But I guess I love you  
You got me in between  
The devil and the deep blue sea  
  
You got me in between  
The devil and the deep blue sea  
Hmm you got me in between  
The devil and the deep blue sea  
  
I ought to cross you off my list  
But when you come a knockin at my door  
Fate seems to give my heart a twist  
And I keep runnin back for more  
  
Hmm I should hate you  
But I guess I love you  
You got me in between  
The devil and the deep blue sea  
  
You got me in between  
The deviland the deep blue seaand the deep blue sea
