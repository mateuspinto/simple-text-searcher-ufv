Look at you  
Feeling all good  
You cant resist  
You have to be all  
Up in it  
Dont it feel great  
Talking Shit  
I let it go  
  
Chorus  
Why dont you just leave me alone  
My heart is gonna break from the fall  
Holding on to petty things  
Feeling all the hate it brings  
Why dont you just leave me alone  
  
What a puss  
Think youre so tough  
I take this shit  
All I had was  
Loving me  
It was so good  
But that wasnt enough  
You ripped it away  
  
Chorus  
Why dont you just leave me alone  
My heart is gonna break from the fall  
Holding on to petty things  
Feeling all the hate it brings  
Why dont you just leave me alone  
  
All the disrespect  
Oh fuck hypocrite  
All the bullshit you took from me  
Your such a piece of shit  
Nothing but a heretic  
Sucking the life out of me  
Fucker your gone without me  
  
Chorus  
Why dont you just leave me alone  
My heart is gonna break from the fall  
Holding on to petty things  
Feeling all the hate it brings  
Why dont you just leave me alone  
  
Leave me alone  
Leave me alone  
Leave me alone  
Leave me the fuck alone
