I look at them shuffle and the shuffle come down  
Ramblin and scramblin and aheadin for town  
Hoppin and boppin and abuzzin around  
Happily awaitin at the station  
I look at that train number 709  
Hoppin and boppin and arrivin on time  
Who do you think is about to arrive  
The band they call the Dixieland Five  
  
Theyre gonna play that muskrat ramble tune  
Like the way you never heard it played  
Get ready for the big parade  
All together now  one and two  
Join that happy crowd  
Tellin me that ramblin scramblin muskrat song  
Come on ramble along  
Yeah
