Pressure pushing down on me  
Pressing down on you no man ask for  
Under pressure that burns a building down  
Splits a family in two  
Puts people on streets  
  
Bah bah   
  
Thats okay  
Its the terror of knowing  
What this world is about  
Watching some good friends  
Screaming Let me out  
Pray tomorrow takes me higher  
Pressure on people people on streets  
  
Okay Chipping around kick my brains around the floor  
These are the days it never rains but it pours  
People on streets  
People on streets  
  
Its the terror of knowing  
What this world is about  
Watching some good friends  
Screaming Let me out  
Pray tomorrow takes me higher  
Pressure on people people on streets  
  
Turned away from it all like a blind man  
Sat on a fence but it dont work  
Keep coming up with love  
But its so slashed and torn  
Why why why  
Love love love love  
  
Insanity laughs under pressure were cracking  
Cant we give ourselves one more chance  
Why cant we give love one more chance  
Why cant we give love give love give love give love give love  
  
Cause loves such an old fashioned word  
And love dares you to care  
For the people on the edge of the night  
And love dares you to change our way of  
Caring about ourselves  
  
This is our last dance x2  
This is ourselves  
Under pressure  
Under pressure  
Pressure
