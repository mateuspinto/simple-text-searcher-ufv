Sing sweet and low a lullaby  
Till angels say Amen  
A mother tonight is rocking  
A cradle in Bethlehem  
  
While wisemen follow through the dark  
A star that beckons them  
A mother tonight is rocking  
A cradle in Bethlehem  
  
A little child shall lead them  
The prophets said of old  
And storm and tempest heed them  
Until the bell is tolled  
  
Sing sweet and low your lullaby  
Till angels say Amen  
A mother tonight is rocking  
A cradle in Bethlehem  
  
Sing sweet and low your lullaby  
Till angels say Amen  
A mother tonight is rocking  
A cradle in Bethlehem
