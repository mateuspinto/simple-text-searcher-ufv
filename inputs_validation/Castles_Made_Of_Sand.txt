Down the street you can hear her scream  
Youre a disgrace as she slams the door  
in his drunken face  
And now he stands outside  
and all the neighbors start to gossip and drool  
He cries oh girl you must be mad  
What happened to the sweet love you and me had  
Against the door he leans and start a scene  
and his tears fall and burn the garden green  
And so castles made of sand  
fall in the sea  
eventually  
A little Indian brave who before he was ten  
played wargames in the woods with his Indian friends  
And he built a dream that when he grew up  
he would be a fearless warrior Indian chief  
Many moons past and more the dream grew strong  
until tomorrow he would sing his first war song  
and fight his first battle  
but something went wrong  
surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night  
And so castles made of sand  
fall in the sea  
eventually  
There was a young girl  
whose heart was a frown  
cause she was crippled for life  
and she couldnt speak a sound  
and she wished and prayed  
she could stop livin  
so she decide to die  
She drew her wheelchair to the edge of the shore  
and to her legs she smiled  
You wont hurt me no more  
But then a sight shed never seen made her jump and say  
Look a golden winged ship is passing my way  
And it really didnt have to stop  
It just kept on going  
And so castles made of sand  
slips into the sea  
eventually
