Chorus   
You take me up and than you take me down  
I hear my heart its such a lonely sound  
And I know my love is serious  
Can I trust your heart youre dangerous  
The grass is greener girl when I see you  
The sky is bluer girl its true  
But I know this love is serious  
Can I trust your heart youre dangerous  
Cause I I want to kiss your lips tonight  
  
Why does it feels so good  
To be with you tonight  
Cause no matter what I do I do it just for you my love  
Why does it feels so good  
If you are by my side  
Cause no matter what I do its only me an you  
Cause its  
One to make me crazy  
Two to be my baby  
Three youll never let me go  
Oh its  
Four you play with fire  
Five higher and higher  
Six and baby time will show  
  
Why does my heart is beating just for you  
You promised on a secret rendevous  
And I know this love is serious  
Can I trust your heart youre dangerous  
Maybe Im weak and you are strong  
But babe I know where my heart belongs
