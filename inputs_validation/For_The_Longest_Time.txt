Whoa oh oh oh  
For the longest time  
Whoa oh oh  
For the longest  
  
If you said goodbye to me tonight  
There would still be music left to write  
What else could I do  
Im so inspired by you  
That hasnt happened for the longest time  
  
Once I thought my innocence was gone  
Now I know that happiness goes on  
Thats where you found me  
When you put your arms around me  
I havent been there for the longest time  
  
Whoa oh oh oh  
For the longest time  
Whoa oh oh  
For the longest time  
  
Im that voice youre hearing in the hall  
And the greatest miracle of all  
Is how I need you  
And how you needed me too  
That hasnt happened for the longest time  
  
Maybe this wont last very long  
But you feel so right  
And I could be wrong  
Maybe Ive been hoping too hard  
But Ive gone this far  
And its more than I hoped for  
  
Who knows how much further well go on  
Maybe Ill be sorry when youre gone  
Ill take my chances  
I forgot how nice romance is  
I havent been there for the longest time  
  
I had second thoughts at the start  
I said to myself  Hold onto your heart  
Now I know the woman that you are  
Youre wonderful so far  
And its more than I hoped for  
  
I dont care what consequence it brings  
I have been a fool for lesser things  
I want you so bad  
I think you ought to know that  
I intend to hold you for the longest time  
  
Whoa oh oh oh  
For the longest time  
Whoa oh oh  
For the longest time  
Whoa oh oh  
For the longest time
