The weight of the charm  
Lights out for hands stretched out to lead  
The forsaken walk of allegiance  
In trust we deceive  
Walk onnever to turn back  
A look inside turned to stone  
My soul is free with blood on my hands  
My soul is free  
Lights out  
I stand aside  
Struggle in my mind  
I look inside to see the crowd infringed upon  
Lights out  
The death of the charm  
Lights outthe hands will recede  
The forgotten chance of disloyalty  
In trust we are deceived  
Send offits out of your hands  
Walk onits only your life
