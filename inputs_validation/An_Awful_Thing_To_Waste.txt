You say that you could do with a break  
Above all you can take  
You need to find somewhere you can run to  
Somewhere a long way from here  
Somewhere where the skies are all clear  
Somewhere you can think all your thoughts through  
It took a long time to make me understand  
You gotta meet life and shake it by the hand  
You gotta use your emotion  
You talk a nice line to put your mind at ease  
You wanna sit back and count your memories  
But thats no solution  
I dont want to harp about it  
But what you gonna do about it  
Look at how youre set in your ways  
You used to be so willing to face  
Any kind of problem before you  
Life is not as long as you think  
Open up your mind and youll see  
Dont destroy yourself I implore you I implore you  
Youve got a fine wife a perfect family  
You had it all planned to live so carefully  
But where does it get you  
They say the mind is an awful thing to waste  
And thats a fact that you must come to face  
What more can I tell you  
I dont want to harp about it  
But what you gonna do about it  
You have everything that you need  
You only have to try to succeed  
And realize its all waiting for you  
Living life this way is the worst  
If youve to suffer you must  
And dont you know we want to applaud you  
Yes applaud you
