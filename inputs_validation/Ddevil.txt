Plagiarized existence exist  
Among the writers of the word  
Shake your spear at Shakespeare  
Shake your spear at Shakespeare  
  
Loud and noisy  
Strong refrigerators  
Gaining independence  
Gaining independence  
  
Stupid people do stupid things  
Smart people outsmart each other  
Then themselves then themselves  
Then themselves then themselves  
  
Take me down there  
Photographic relapse  
People feeding frenzy  
The devil is so lovely  
  
My blue moon rivets in exits  
Forewarned customary spirits  
By myself by myself  
By myself by myself  
  
Take me down there  
Photographic relapse  
People feeding frenzy  
The devil is so lovely  
  
Take me down there  
Photographic relapse  
People feeding frenzy  
The devil is so lovely
