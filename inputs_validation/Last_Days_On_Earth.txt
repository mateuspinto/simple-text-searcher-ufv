Tired of this elegant life  
With the best will in the world  
Its a thorn in your side  
  
Dazed not a little confused  
Let the patient do the work  
They got nothing to lose  
  
I told you  
Id hold you  
til the last days on earth  
  
Ties that are tested and tried  
Like the crushing of the waves  
Well be lost in the tide  
  
Talk away the pain for the very last time  
Like an echo in a cave  
Let it die in your mind  
  
I told you  
Id hold you  
Til the last days on earth  
  
If you should fall into these opened arms  
You would be blessed not just bemused  
Wake up their mind love is alonely world  
Where nothing on earth lies like a truth  
  
Ties that are tested and tried  
Like the crushing of the waves  
Well be lost in the tide  
  
Talk away the pain for the very last time  
Like an echo in a cave  
Let it die in our mind  
  
I told you  
Id hold you  
Til the last days on earth
