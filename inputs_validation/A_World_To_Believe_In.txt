Ive seen the tears and the heartache and I felt the pain  
Ive seen the hatred in so many lives and lost in vain  
And yet through this darkness theres always a light that shines through  
And takes me back home  
Takes me back home  
  
All of the promises broken  
And all of the songs left unsung  
Seems so far away as I make my way back to you  
  
Chorus  
You gave me faith and you gave me a world to believe in  
You gave me your love to believe in  
And feeling this love I can rise up above  
And be strong and be whole once again  
  
I know that dreams we hold on to can just fade away  
And I know that words can be wasted with so much to say  
And I when I feel helpless theres always a hope that shines through  
And makes me believe  
Makes me believe  
  
  
And I see for one fleeting moment  
A paradise under the sun  
I drift away and I make my way back to you  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge  
Life goes on  
Can leave all sweet sorrow and pain  
And life hold on  
To all that you are  
To all that well be  
And I can go on once again  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Because your love hears my soul once again  
I can live and I can dream once again  
Because you made me love you
