Got Lil Wayne pumpin on my iPod  
Pumpin on the subs in the back of my crew cab  
Redneck rockin like a rockstar  
Sling a lil mud off the back we can do that  
Friday night football Saturday last call Sunday hallelujah  
If you like it up loud and youre hillbilly proud  
Then you know what Im talking about  
  
Let me hear you say truck yeah  
Wanna get it jacked up yeah  
Lets crank it on up yeah  
With a little bit of luck I can find me a girl with a truck yeah  
We can love it on up yeah  
Til the sun comes up yeah  
And if you think this life I love is a little too country  
Truck Yeah  
  
Our party in the club is a honky tonk downtown

Chillin in the back room  
Hangin with my whole crew  
Sippin on a cold brew hey now

Wanna hear a country song  
If you like it up loud and youre hillbilly proud  
Throw your hands up now let me hear you shout  
  
Truck yeah  
Wanna get it jacked up yeah  
Lets crank it on up yeah  
With a little bit of luck I can find me a girl with a truck yeah  
We can love it on up yeah  
Til the sun comes up yeah  
And if you think this life I love is a little too country  
Truck yeah
