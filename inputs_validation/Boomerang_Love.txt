Hole in the wind behind the island  
Big blue hole in the middle of my heart  
I cant forget the time we spent together  
I cant remember how long  
How long weve been apart  
  
Chorus  
Be ridin on this boomerang love circling fast  
Hard to see in a sky so vast  
Laugh till you cry cry till you smile  
Up and down all around  
Boomerang boomerang  
Boomerang love  
  
Now we both know were now in different orbits  
Different islands different worlds  
Though we really are the same  
Im just glad glad we started talking  
Finally realize no one is to blame  
  
Chorus  
  
Weve been riding on a boomerang love  
Cant let go  
Running fast movin slow  
Whats the right way who is to say  
Tension and suspension  
On a boomerang boomerang love  
Boomerang boomerang love  
  
Big blue hole out in the ocean  
Where I dive straight down until  
I can not see  
Feel my way through a bevy of solutions  
There I realize the answer lies in me  
  
Gettin off of this boomerang love  
Comin up for air  
Do whats right do whats fair  
Come what may well find a way  
No more tension and suspension  
No more boom boom  
Boomerang love
