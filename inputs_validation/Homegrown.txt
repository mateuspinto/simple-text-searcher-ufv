Homegrowns all right with me  
Homegrown is the way it should be  
Homegrown is a good thing  
Plant that bell and let it ring  
  
The sun comes up in the morning  
Shines that light around  
One day without no warning  
Things start jumping up from the ground  
  
Well homegrowns all right with me  
Homegrown is the way it should be  
Homegrown is a good thing  
Plant that bell and let it ring
