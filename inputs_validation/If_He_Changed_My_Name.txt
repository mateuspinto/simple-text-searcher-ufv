I told Jesus it would be alright if He changed my name  
I told Jesus it would be alright if He changed my name  
I told Jesus it would be alright if He changed my name  
And He told me that I would go hungry if He changed my name  
And He told me that I would go hungry if He changed my name  
And He told me that I would go hungry if He changed my name  
  
But I told Jesus it would be alright if He changed my name  
I told Jesus it would be alright if He changed my name  
So I told Him it would be alright and the world would hate me  
That I would go hungry if He changed my name
