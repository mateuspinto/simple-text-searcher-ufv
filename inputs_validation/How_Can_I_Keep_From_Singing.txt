My life goes on in endless song  
Above earths lamentations  
I hear the real though faroff hymn  
That hails a new creation  
  
Through all the tumult and the strife  
I hear its music ringing  
It sounds an echo in my soul  
How can I keep from singing  
  
While though the tempest loudly roars  
I hear the truth it liveth  
And though the darkness round me close  
Songs in the night it giveth  
  
No storm can shake my inmost calm  
While to that rock Im clinging  
Since love is lord of heaven and earth  
How can I keep from singing  
  
When tyrants tremble in their fear  
And hear their death knell ringing  
When friends rejoice both far and near  
How can I keep from singing  
  
In prison cell and dungeon vile  
Our thoughts to them are winging  
When friends by shame are undefiled  
How can I keep from singing
