Cause he gets up in the morning  
And he goes to work at nine  
And he comes back home at fivethirty  
Gets the same train every time  
Cause his world is built round punctuality  
It never fails  
  
And hes oh so good  
And hes oh so fine  
And hes oh so healthy  
In his body and his mind  
Hes a well respected man about town  
Doing the best things so conservatively  
  
And his mother goes to meetings  
While his father pulls the maid  
And she serves the tea with councilors  
While discussing foreign trade  
And she passes looks as well as bills  
At every suave young man  
  
Cause hes oh so good  
And hes oh so fine  
And hes oh so healthy  
In his body and his mind  
Hes a well respected man about town  
Doing the best things so conservatively  
  
And he likes his own backyard  
And he likes his fags the best  
Cause hes better than the rest  
And his own sweat smells the best  
And he hopes to grab his fathers loot  
When Pater passes on  
  
Cause hes oh so good  
And hes oh so fine  
And hes oh so healthy  
In his body and his mind  
Hes a well respected man about town  
Doing the best things so conservatively  
  
And he plays at stocks and shares  
And he goes to the regatta  
And he adores the girl next door  
Cause hes dying to get at her  
But his mother knows the best about  
The matrimonial stakes  
  
Cause hes oh so good  
And hes oh so fine  
And hes oh so healthy  
In his body and his mind  
Hes a well respected man about town  
Doing the best things so conservatively
