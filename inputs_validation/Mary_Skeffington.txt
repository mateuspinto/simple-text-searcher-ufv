Mary Skeffington close your eyes  
And make believe that you are just a girl again  
Go to sleep tonight dream of days  
When you had something there to light the way  
  
Remember a holiday in a north of England town  
You slept in a room upstairs on a bed of eiderdown  
  
Mary Skeffington when you wake  
You mustnt be afraid to face another day  
Think of what you had youll get by  
Youve always been a lady hold your head up high  
  
Look back on your home where you spent the best years of your life  
Remember the man who asked you if you would be his wife
