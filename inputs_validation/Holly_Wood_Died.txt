Accidents out on the highway to somewhere  
They tell us about when were young  
Rescuers working to clean up the crashes  
Before she can see what theyve done   
Nobody told her shed lose in the first round  
The last fight was fixed from the start  
Names on her sidewalks they move through her body  
Like razors they cut through her heart  
Like razors they cut through her heart  
  
Hey let go of all you know  
Youre flying away now  
What have you got to lose  
Say out loud these words Ive found  
Ill be there when you come down  
Ill be waiting for you  
  
Night life the highlife she just wants a good life  
So someone remembers her too  
But somewhere she heard there was someplace to go  
When you die when you live like we do  
Die when you live like we do  
  
Hey let go of all you know  
Im finding a way now  
What have you got to lose  
Say out loud these words Ive found  
Ill be there when you come down  
Ill be waiting for you  
  
Hey let go of all you know  
Youre flying away now  
What have you got to lose  
Say out loud these words Ive found  
Ill be there when you come down  
Ill be waiting for you
