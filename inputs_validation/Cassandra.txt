Down in the street theyre all singing and shouting  
Staying alive though the city is dead  
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter  
While you are crying alone on your bed  
  
Pity Cassandra that no one believed you  
But then again you were lost from the start  
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets  
Bargain playing smart aching in our hearts  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didnt believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
So in the morning your ship will be sailing  
Now that your father and sister are gone  
There is no reason for you to linger  
Youre grieving deeply but still moving on  
  
You know the future is casting a shadow  
No one else sees it but you know your fate  
Packing your bags being slow and thorough  
Knowing though youre late that ship is sure to wait  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didnt believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
I watched the ship leaving harbor at sunrise  
Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain  
She stood on deck just a tiny figure  
Rigid and restrained blue eyes filled with pain  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didnt believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
Im sorry Cassandra  
Im sorry Cassandra
