I went to bed late last night  
Pulled down the shade  
And turned out the light  
I fell asleep and I began to dream  
The most extraordinary beautiful dream  
Incense and perfume filled the air  
The sound of music was everywhere  
I met a woman by a babbling brook  
She was gifted she was wise  
She was reading a book  
She talked about virtue  
She talked about vice  
She acted kinda naughty  
But she looked real nice  
I could see her body move  
To the rhythm to the beat  
Of a powerful groove  
Her lips are red  
Her body is soft  
She is a movin volcano  
Man I mean shes hot  
She got the long cool legs  
She got the sexy sexy style  
She got the cool sweet walk  
She got the beautiful smile  
When I awoke it was the break of day  
I got to go to work I got to earn my pay  
I am a man who works on the line  
Im the muscle Im the blood Im the overtime  
I gotta lift that bail  
Work my fingers to the bone  
You know I cant stop the train  
I gotta let it roll on  
No need to dream about it anymore  
cause I found my dream lover on the 13th floor  
Incense and perfume filled the air  
The sound of music was everywhere  
I met a woman by a babbling brook  
She was gifted she was wise  
She was reading a book  
Her lips are red  
Her body is soft  
She is a movin volcano  
Man I mean shes hot  
No need to dream about it anymore  
cause I found my dream lover on the 13th floor  
She got the long cool legs  
She got the sexy sexy style  
She got the cool sweet walk  
She got the beautiful smile  
She got the long cool legs  
She got the sexy sexy style  
She got the cool sweet walk  
She got the beautiful smile  
Her lips are red  
Her body is soft  
She is a movin volcano  
Man I mean shes hot  
No need to dream about it anymore  
cause I found my dream lover on the 13th floor  
She got the long cool legs  
She got the sexy sexy style  
She got the cool sweet walk  
She got the beautiful smile  
She got the long cool legs  
She got the sexy sexy style  
She got the cool sweet walk  
She got the beautiful smile
