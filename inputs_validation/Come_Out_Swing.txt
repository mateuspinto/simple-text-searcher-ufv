You brace and hold it all inside  
Its more than you can stand  
No one around even tries  
Tries to understand  
  
Dont turn away dont turn away  
Come out swinging  
Come out alone  
Theyre in your way  
But as long as youre swinging  
Strong then youll get by  
  
Your pacings wearing out a line  
Right beside your bed  
The scene replays a million times  
Stuck inside your head  
  
And though you stand in place  
Your mind escapes  
Read between the lies  
Smiles on your face  
You fake like youre ok  
  
Dont turn away dont turn away  
Come out swinging  
Out on your own  
Theyre in your way  
You may be stinging  
But youll get by  
Dont turn away dont turn away  
Come out swinging  
Never alone again  
The pain inside can guide your way  
  
Midnight no sleep  
Inside you scream to  
No one hears you fall  
Daylight prove me today  
One more try  
  
Dont turn away dont turn  
Come out swinging  
Come out alone  
Theyre in your way  
You may be stinging  
But youll get by  
Don T turn away dont turn away  
Come out swinging  
Never alone again  
Pain inside  
Leads you through so youll get by
