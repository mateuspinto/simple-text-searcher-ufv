Just one more dance just one more chance so I can talk to you  
Dont run around dont turn me down and I will try to prove  
I would do anything you want me to  
  
Just one more dance just one more chance let me talk to you  
Dont go too far with that crowd at the bar  
Thats not the way to win please fall in love again  
Give me your heart so I can start to build our life anew  
  
Just one more dance just one more chance let me talk to you  
  
Dont go too far with that crowd
