Judging by the voice  
He was free to himself so real  
We slaved ourselves to sacrifice  
More than that we do not know  
Then you hear him on the radio  
He would play the sacred themes  
That my children sang to me  
  
Amazing as it seems  
It was the answer to my dream  
His heart that touches me  
More than that I do not not know  
Then I hear him on the radio  
Remembering his every word  
  
That my children sing to me  
We have seen the world this ecstasy  
Now my children sing to me  
This loving place beyond belief  
  
You got to stand stand to to together  
Keep the message alive  
  
You got to stand stand to to together  
To keep the message alive  
  
Spirit up moving spirit up  
Rhythm of sunfire  
  
You got to stand stand to to together  
Keep the message alive  
  
Listening for his words  
He would speak in ancient verse  
So we mesmerize a way to go  
Reaching out the universe  
Reaching out the universal  
Not afraid to learn new words  
  
That our children sing to us  
We have seen the world this ecstasy  
So his children bring to us  
This inner peace beyond belief  
  
You got to stand stand to to together  
Keep the message alive  
  
You got to stand stand to to together  
To keep the message alive  
  
Spirit up moving spirit up  
Rhythm of sunfire  
  
You got to stand stand to to together  
Keep the message alive  
  
One voice  
One world  
One touch  
One life truly truly say it  
One world one voice  
One touch truly truly say it  
Some people realize  
Some people see it  
From the beginning  
One world one touch  
One voice one life  
One touch one voice one world one life
