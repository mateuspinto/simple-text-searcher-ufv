Like they deserve  
Wasnt spilt in vein  
So now youre pullin the moves pullin  
the moves pullin the moves  
Well wage well wage well wage war  
To replace our name  
Some guys got blurred  
So now youre pullin the moves pullin  
the moves pullin the moves  
Well wage well wage well wage war  
To reclaim our terrain  
  
On January 1st 1994  
The indigenous farmers of Southern Mexico  
Declared war on an unjust  
and illigitimate government  
  
Of of the debt of the most wild the most poor  
Came a just arm struggle  
for democracy justice and liberty  
And it wont stop until that 65 year old dictatorship  
the Partido Revolucionario Institucional  
Institutional Revolutionary Party is buired in the ground  
and the peoples voicce is heard once again  
  
So check it out  
On January 1st they became known as  
the Zapatista movement  
And they have a saying and I want you all to  
sing along with me real quick  
It goes something like this  
It goes everything for everyone  
and nothing for ourselves  
Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves  
Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves  
Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves  
Yeah sing that shit  
Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves  
Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves  
Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves  
Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves
