Theres a little place down in Jackson County  
Right off the river road  
If you wanna take a ride to the end of the rainbow  
Find yourself a pot of gold  
Everybody asks me where Im goin  
Yeah everybody wants to know  
Your sister says she wants to come along with me  
I know she really wants to go  
Yeah I know she really wants to go  
  
Down down down down  
Down is where I wanna go  
Down down down down  
Down to the honey hole  
  
If you wanna check it out on a hot summer night  
Climb over the garden wall  
Grab your little baby and hold her tight  
Underneath the sugar falls  
Underneath the sugar falls  
  
Down down down down  
Down is where I wanna go  
Down down down down  
To the honey hole  
To the honey hole  
  
Sugarcane grows wild in the fields  
Like corn sticky yellow sweet  
Late at night you can hear em all buzzin  
Searchin for the queen bee  
Callin for the queen bee  
  
Down down down down  
Down is where I wanna go  
Down down down down  
To the honey hole  
To the honey hole  
To the honey hole  
To the honey hole  
To the honey hole
