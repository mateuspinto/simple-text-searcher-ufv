realizing the new world  
  
I know instinctively  
When something is right  
With no one there to save me  
You came into my life  
The words you whispered  
Still echo in my mind  
Forget about tomorrow  
Forget about time  
  
So good to be alive and touch  
The spirit of freedom  in your soul  
So good to breathe the air and  
Feel that life is worth living  
Theres no time to waste in this life  
Theres no time at all  
So good to see the truth and touch  
The spirit of freedom  
  
I never thought that  
I could ever feel this way  
To see the warmest sunlight  
On a cold and rainy day  
Dawn wakes the silence  
And I know that I cant wait  
To hear the words  
I wanna say again and again  
  
So good to be alive and touch  
The spirit of freedom  in your soul  
So good to breathe the air and  
Feel that life is worth living  
Theres no time to waste in this life  
Theres no time at all  
  
Theres no time to waste in this life  
Theres no time at all  
So good to be alive and touch  
The spirit of freedom  in your soul  
So good to breathe the air and  
Feel that life is worth living  
Theres no time to waste in this life  
Theres no time at all  
So good to be alive and touch  
The spirit of freedom  in your soul
