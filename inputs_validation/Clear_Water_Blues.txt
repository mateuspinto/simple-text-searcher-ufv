Clear water blues thinkin of you  
Sittin here fishin catchin a few  
Spendin my days just tryin to lose  
These clear water blues  
  
Clear water blues driftin along  
Nowhere to go now that youre gone  
My lonely heart dont know what to do  
With these clear water blues  
  
Lookin out across the ocean  
Blue is all I see  
And it seems like no matter how far I go  
Your memory just wont set me free  
  
Clear water blues wont leave me alone  
Keeps on remindin me why youre gone  
My reflection is showin a fool  
In these clear water blues  
  
Clear water blues still thinkin of you  
Sittin here fishin catchin a few  
Spendin my days just tryin to lose  
These clear water blues  
These clear water blues
