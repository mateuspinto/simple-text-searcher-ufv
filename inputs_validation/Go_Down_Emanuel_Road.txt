Go down Emanuel Road man and boy  
Got to break that stone  
Go down Emanuel Road man and boy  
Got to break that stone  
Well the moon still in the sky  
An the sleep still in you eye  
But when you hear me sing  
You better make dem hammers ring  
Wake up and go down Emanuel Road man and boy  
Got to break that stone  
Go down Emanuel Road man and boy

And some of your heads are tight  
But when I call this roll please Lord  
I dont want to miss a soul  
So get up and go down Emanuel Road man and boy  
Got to break that stone  
Go down Emanuel Road man and boy

But man you just begun  
Cause today I tell you something new  
You gotta break dem two by two  
So come on and go down Emanuel Road man and boy  
Got to break that stone

Cause from sun to sun you gotta stick  
And dont tell me bout you sick

To night you better let them women rest  
So you can get up and go down Emanuel Road man and boy
