The next morning at the camp Errand Wolfe and Rutherford stood frozen in awe
as the famous mockingbird flew out of the sky and laid the Helping Friendly
Book at their feet The quest for the book had dragged on for so many years
that its sudden appearance left the men staring in disbelief unsure of what
their next move should be The shock wore off quickly though and Errand Wolfe
shot into high gear He snatched up the book with one hand and the famous
mockingbird with the other and began to inform Rutherford of his plan He
would first kill Wilson and then put the Helping Friendly Book to work for
him  
  
With Rutherfords aid he fastened the famous mockingbird to a pole with glue
and rubber bands to insure the secrecy of his mission and then set out to
find the only man in Gamehendge who could handle the job of eliminating a
King
