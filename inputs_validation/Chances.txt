At times in life  
Youll connect with some  
And some will have to move on  
At times youll feel  
The need to fly  
And fly though you may hurt someone  
  
You were there  
Your chances were clear  
Choices were made in spite  
Of times that were spent  
Feelings were mixed  
Amongst your support base  
A heart was lost  
But a heart found its place  
  
This is a recipe of life  
Made up of fragments of peoples  
Peace and peoples vibes  
Well its each now to their own  
Well your heart will know
