How have I come to this  
How did I slip and fall  
How did I throw half a lifetime away  
Without any thought at all  
  
This shouldve been my time  
Its over it never began  
Facing a world for once not on my side  
I simply turned and ran  
  
I try to blame it on fortune  
Some kind of twist in my fate  
But I know the truth and it haunts me  
I learned it a little too late  
  
I know the truth and it mocks me  
I know the truth and it shocks me  
I learned it a little too late  
  
People have faith in me  
I think I once did too  
I promise whoever has a hold on our lives  
Ill see the bad times through  
  
This should have been my time  
Its over it never began  
Facing a world for once not on my side  
I simply turned and ran  
  
I try to blame it on fortune  
Some kind of shift in the stars  
But I know the truth and it haunts me  
Its flown just a little too far  
  
I know the truth and it mocks me  
I know the truth and it shocks me  
Its flown just a little too far  
  
I try to blame it on fortune  
Some kind of twist in my fate  
But I know the truth and it haunts me  
I learned it a little too late
