A lonely bard wandering across the lands am I  
Singing dancing finding answers to every why  
The taverns are full and one crosses my path too  
I just might reward myself with a beer or two  
  
This inn the place of many romantic tales  
On the loft women offer their sales  
But my eyes they catch a girl beat by everyone  
A slave she is but for me a rose undone  
  
Hear me sing  
Watch me dance  
Play that lute of thine  
And share with me this dance  
  
As she danced my eyes began to shine  
There she was the maiden so divine  
How could I approach her with my outlook so poor  
Her beauty being much more than I could endure  
  
So I asked if I could sing a chanson  
With a language of ancient and of lore  
Gathered the men around us me and the girl in rags  
Soon were the melodies heard by everyone  
  
Hear us sing  
Watch us dance  
Sing with us this tale  
With a clap of hands  
  
The stories longforgotten we still know  
Performing our skills wherever we go  
I end my story as I receive a kiss  
From my girl the dearest Beatrice  
  
Hear us sing  
Watch us dance  
Sing with us the tales  
Which the music will keep alive
