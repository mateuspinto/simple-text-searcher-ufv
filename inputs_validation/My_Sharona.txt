Oo my little pretty one pretty one  
When you gonna give me some time Sharona  
Oo you make my motor run my motor run  
Gun it coming off of the line Sharona  
Never gonna stop give it up such a dirty mind  
I always get it up with a touch of the younger kind  
Myee eyee byee ahee ah woo  
Ma ma ma my Sharona  
Come a little closer over here  
Close enough to look in my eyes Sharona  
Keep a little mystery kissin me  
Runnin down the length of my thigh Sharona  
Never gonna stop give it up such a dirty mind  
I always get it up from a touch of the younger kind  
Myee eyee byee ahee ah woo  
Ma ma ma my Sharona  
Ma ma ma my Sharona  
When ya gonna get to me get to me  
Is it just a matter of time Sharona  
Is it a destiny a destiny  
Or is it just a game in my mind Sharona  
Never gonna stop give it up such a dirty mind  
I always get it up from a touch of the younger kind  
Myee eyee byee ahee ah woo  
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma  
Myee eyee byee ahee ah woo  
Ma ma ma my Sharona  
Ooooh my Sharona
