All the banners stop waving  
And the flags stop flying  
And the silence comes over  
Thousands of soldiers  
Thousands of soldiers  
  
Who is that girl Do I know her face  
Who is that girl  
  
Joanni Joanni wears a golden cross  
And she looks so beautiful in her armour  
Joanni Joanni blows a kiss to God  
And she never wears a ring on her finger  
  
All the cannon are firing  
And the swords are clashing  
And the horses are charging  
And the flags are flying  
And the battle is raging  
And the bells the bells are ringing  
  
Who is that girl Do I know her face  
Who is that girl  
  
Joanni Joanni wears a golden cross  
And she looks so beautiful in her armor  
Joanni Joanni blows a kiss to God  
And she never wears a ring on her finger  
Joanni Joanni Joanni Joanni blows a kiss to God  
And she just looks beautiful in her armor  
Beautiful in her armor
