I walked in there sat Slim  
Cleaning up his memory with some sapphire gin  
Mr Pain grabbed my arm and pulled me aside  
And said kid are you ready for the wild ride  
  
I looked up there she stood  
I say didnt look so great I say you look good  
Aww she took her hand ran it up my thigh  
And said cowboy you ready for the wild ride  
  
Chorus  
Come on now junior take a wild ride wild ride  
See can you make it on the wild ride wild ride  
Dont try no shakin on the wild ride wild ride  
Things start breakin on the wild ride wild ride  
Yes it does  
  
Out on the highway I saw my mind  
In tiny little pieces blown from side to side  
My heart was shattered along with my pride  
Guess you cant keep em on the wild ride  
  
Chorus  
  
I was crawling cross the floor I was tryin to leave  
When I felt something tugging what was left of my sleeve  
I heard a little voice with a gold plated vibe  
Say I bought a ticket for the wild ride  
  
Chorus x2
