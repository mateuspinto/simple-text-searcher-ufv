Why must I love a heartless one  
Wholl never know the harm shes done  
Though love is blind I should have known  
Just call me lonesome from now on  
I climb the stairs up to my room  
But no one meets me in the gloom  
And the silence tells me she is gone  
Just call me lonesome from now on  
These walls will hide me when I cry  
And pray that heaven lets me die  
What good is life when hope is gone  
Just call me lonesome from now on  
I pray my memories at last  
Will fade into the distant past  
And if I must live and love alone  
Just call me lonesome from now on  
Just call me lonesome from now on
