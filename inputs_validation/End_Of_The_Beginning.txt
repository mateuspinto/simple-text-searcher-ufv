Is this the end of the beginning  
Or the beginning of the end  
Losing control or are you winning  
Is your life real or just pretend  
  
Reanimation of the sequence  
Rewinds the future to the past  
To find the source of the solution  
The system has to be recast  
  
Release your mind  
Fast forward to the secrets of your soul  
Your lifes on overload  
Is this your fate  
  
Will you decide what makes you an entity  
Thats your identity  
Well if you dont know  
Which way to go  
  
You might be lost and confused  
A second chance no time to lose  
  
Regeneration of your cyber sonic soul  
Transforming time and space beyond control  
Rise up and resist to be the master of your fate  
Dont look back before today tomorrow is too late  
  
You dont want to be a robot ghost  
Occupied inside a human host  
Analyzed and cloned relentlessly  
Synthesized until they set you free  
  
Alrightokay alright  
Till they set you free  
Alrightokay  
Till they set you free  
  
I dont want to see you yeah  
I dont want to see you yeah
