Here in the country we dance and we play  
And we pray to our saints and we make love all day  
I fell in love with a real city boy  
Whos afraid of his nature afraid of his joy  
I punched him out and brought him to this hut  
But I know hell thank me when he wakes up  
We got trees we got snakes we got acres of sky  
His life in the city was making him cry  
  
Come on come on darling be brave for a while  
You dont look afraid when you laugh and you smile  
Ill be good Ill be strong  
Ill be just what you needed all along  
  
Here in the country we dance and we play  
And we pray to our saints and we make love all day  
I fell in love with a real city boy  
Whos afraid of his nature afraid of his joy  
  
Us Amazonians know where we stand  
We got kids we got jobs why do we need a man  
Us Amazonians make out alright  
But we want something to hold in the forest at night  
  
Come on come on darling be brave for a while  
You dont look afraid when you laugh and you smile  
Breathe in deep stick with me  
Youll still be free as you let yourself be  
  
If youre certain if youre true  
Ill be the only country girl for you  
Ill be good Ill be strong  
Ill be just what you needed all along  
  
Here in the country we dance and we play  
And we pray to our saints and we make love all day  
I fell in love with a real city boy  
Gotta teach him about nature and teach him about joy  
  
Us Amazonians know where we stand  
We got kids we got jobs why do we need a man  
Us Amazonians make out alright  
But we want something to hold in the forest at night
