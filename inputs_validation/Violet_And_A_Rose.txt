Send me some violets Im blue as can be  
A violet fell in love with a rose and started it flashing from its head to its
toe  
Then one day the rose was kissed by the dew  
A new love was born and the violet turned blue  
Roses are red violets are blue Im sending red red roses to you  
If you care to send some flowers to me then send me some violets Im blue as
can be  
 choir   
I wanted my love to bouquet with you but just like the rose youve proven
untrue  
A flower thats wild they say has no home and just like the violet Im left
all alone  
Roses are red
