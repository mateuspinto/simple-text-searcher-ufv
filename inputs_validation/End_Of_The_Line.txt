Take a look  
Take a good long look and tell me what you see  
Through time passing  
  
Make a stand  
In your way  
Leaves way too much for me  
On the edge  
Standing  
  
I was there when lightning struck  
I watched the idols fall  
I could see it coming  
Could read the writing on the wall  
  
Time Time after time  
The end of the line  
We stand and watch it fade away  
Sign of the times the end of the line  
  
Its your move  
So play it right  
Sometimes you get just one chance  
Superstitious  
No  
If I had the time I still wouldnt dance  
  
I was there when lightning struck  
And yes I kept my head  
I could feel them coming  
Could feel the living dead Dead Dead  
  
Save your breath  
Dont pray for me pray for yourself  
Through time keeling  
  
Its the end  
It snuck up  
Quick and took you by surprise  
The waitings over  
  
I was there when lightning struck  
I watched the idols crawl  
It was the second coming  
It was written on the wall
