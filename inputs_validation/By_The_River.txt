I was walkin by the river  
I held my hand out to feel the rain  
  
Just a light rain  
Almost a sun shower  
Makinall things shine again  
  
And I felt like I belonged  
I felt so strong  
As I walked on  
  
There was rhythm  
And there was order  
There was a balance  
There was a flow  
  
There was patience  
Indulgence  
There was a power  
I could not know  
  
And I felt it all made sense  
The innocence  
The permanence  
  
I took my young son to the river  
I held his hand out to feel the rain
