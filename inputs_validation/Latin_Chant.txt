Choir  
Respice quaesumus Domine  
Famulam tuam Evita  
In infirmitate  
Et animam refove quam creasti  
Ut castigationibus emendata  
Se tua sentiat medicina salvatam  
Per Christum Dominuum  
Qui vivit et regnat  
Per omnia saecula saeculorum  
Amen  
Translation  
Look with favor we beseech Thee Oh Lord  
Upon Thy handmaid Evita  
In her weakness  
And refresh the soul which Thou hast created  
That being corrected by Thy chastisement  
She may find herself cured by Thy healing  
Through Christ Our Lord  
Who lives and reigns  
Forever and ever  
Amen   
  
Che  
She had her moments she had some style  
The best show in town was the crowd  
Outside the Casa Rosada crying Eva Peron
