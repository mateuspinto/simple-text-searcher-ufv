I just jumped out in the open  
Without knowing if my parachute would save me  
Its quiet and peaceful in this emotional nirvana blue  
  
Cause taking off was so easy  
But landing very rough  
No tears no smile  
Not even the urge to cry  
  
I just jumped out in the open  
Without knowing if my parachute would save me  
Its quiet and peaceful in this emotional nirvana blue  
  
Your portrait is fading  
Raw canvas remaining  
As a white page in my soul  
  
Cause taking off was so easy  
But landing very rough  
No tears no smile  
Not even the urge to cry  
  
Your portrait is fading  
Raw canvas remaining  
As a white page in my soul

Without knowing if my parachute would save me  
Its quiet and peaceful in this emotional nirvana blue  
  
Cause taking off was so easy  
But landing very rough  
No tears no smile  
Not even the urge to cry  
  
I just jumped out in the open  
I just jumped out in the open  
I just jumped out in the open  
I just jumped out in the open  
  
I just jumped out in the open  
I just jumped out in the open  
I just jumped out in the open  
I just jumped out in the open
