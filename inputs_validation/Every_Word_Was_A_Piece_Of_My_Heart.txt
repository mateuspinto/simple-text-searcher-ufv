J Bon jovi  
  
Ive been staring at the page  
For what seems like days  
I guess I put this one off for a while  
Did I see a tear fall from your eyes  
Or did you laugh so hard that you cried  
When I served my secrets on a silver tray to you  
Hey now I guess the nights just bringing me down  
  
Theres not love theres no hate  
I left them there for you to take  
But know that every word was a piece of my heart  
  
Youve been the blood in my veins  
The only one who knows my middle name  
And the smiles they came easy cause of you  
You know that I love you but I hate you  
Cause I know I can never escape you  
Let the choir sing for tonight Im an easy mark  
Hey now am I acting just a little too proud  
  
Theres not love theres no hate  
I left them there for you to take  
But know that every word was a piece of my heart  
Have I said too much  
Maybe I havent said enough  
But know that every word was a piece of my heart  
  
Hush me darling maybe Ive lost my touch  
Maybe Ive lost my guts  there is that truth enough  
Hey now hey now  
  
You know these love letters mix with whisky  
Just dont light a match when you kiss me  
Though Ill blow away you know Ill be back soon  
Hey now hey now hey now am I talking just a little too loud  
  
Theres not love theres no hate  
I left them there for you to take  
But know that every word was a piece of my heart  
Have I said too much  
Maybe I havent said enough  
But know that every word was a piece of my heart  
Hey now am I talking just a little too proud  
Hey now the nights just bringing me down
