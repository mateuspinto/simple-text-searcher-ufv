This one  
Can you feel it feel the groove  
Let the music take control and let your body move  
Just relax and listen to the sound  
Once the music takes you you will finally have found  
It will take you away to another state of mind  
Where peace youll find inside the sound  
Just escape to a place  
Troubles seem to flow away when you get away  
Get this party going on the feel of the rhythm  
Gotta gotta make it strong leave it going on  
If you wanna get away and ease your mind now  
Come on everybody stay and let the song take you away yeah  
Alright
