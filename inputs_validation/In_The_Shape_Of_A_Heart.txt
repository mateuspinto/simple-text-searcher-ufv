It was a ruby that she wore  
On a chain around her neck  
In the shape of a heart  
In the shape of a heart  
It was a time I wont forget  
For the sorrow and regret  
And the shape of a heart  
And the shape of a heart  
I guess I never knew  
What she was talking about  
I guess I never knew  
What she was living without  
People speak of love dont know what theyre thinking of  
Wait around for the one who fits just like a glove  
Speak in terms of belief and belonging  
Try to fit some name to their longing  
There was a hole left in the wall  
From some ancient fight  
About the size of a fist  
Or something thrown that had missed  
And there were other holes as well  
In the house where our nights fell  
Far too many to repair  
In the time that we were there  
People speak of love dont know what theyre thinking of  
Reach out to each other though the push and shove  
Speak in terms of a life and the learning  
Try to think of a word for the burning  
You keep it up  
You try so hard  
To keep a life from coming apart  
And never know  
What breaches and faults are concealed  
In the shape of a heart  
It was the ruby that she wore  
On a stand beside the bed  
In the hour before dawn  
When I knew she was gone  
And I held it in my hand  
For a little while  
And dropped it into the wall  
Let it go heard it fall  
I I guess I never knew  
What she was talking about  
I guess I never knew  
What she was living without  
People speak of love dont know what theyre thinking of  
Wait around for the one who fits just like a glove  
Speak in terms of a life and the living  
Try to find the word for forgiving  
You keep it up  
You try so hard  
To keep a life from coming apart  
And never know  
The shallows and the unseen reefs  
That are there from the start  
In the shape of a heart
