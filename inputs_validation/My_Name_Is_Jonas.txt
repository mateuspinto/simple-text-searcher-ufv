My name is Jonas  
Im carrying the wheel  
Thanks for all youve shown us  
But this is how we feel  
Come sit next to me  
Pour yourself some tea  
Just like grandma made  
When we couldnt find sleep  
Things were better then  
Once but never again  
Weve all left the den  
Let me tell you bout it  
  
The choochoo train left right on time  
A ticket costs only your mind  
The driver said hey man we go all the way  
Of course we were willing to pay  
  
My name is Wepeel  
I gotta box full of your toys  
Theyre fresh out of batteries  
But theyre still makin noise  
Tell me what to do  
Now the tank is dry  
Now this wheel is flat  
And you know what else  
Guess what I received  
In the mail today  
Words of deep concern  
From my little brother  
  
The buildings not goin as he planned  
The foreman has injured his hand  
The dozer will not clear a path  
The driver swears he learned his math  
The workers are goin home  
  
My name is jonas
