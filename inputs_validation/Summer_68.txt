Would you like to say something before you leave  
Perhaps youd care to state exactly how you feel  
We said goodbye before we said hello  
I hardly even like you I shouldnt care at all  
We met just six hours ago the music was too loud  
From your bed I gained a day and lost a bloody year  
And I would like to know  
How do you feel how do you feel how do you feel  
  
Not a single word was said delights still without fears  
Occasionally you showed a smile but what was the need  
I felt the cold far too soon  the wind of 95  
My friends are lying in the sun I wish that I was there  
Tomorrow brings another town and another girl like you  
Have you time before you leave to greet another man  
Just you let me know  
How do you feel how do you feel how do you feel  
  
Goodbye to you  
Charlotte Kringles too  
Ive had enough for one day
