The good ship Granma lies at anchor in the harbour  
Waiting for the evening tide to rise and bring high water  
Bound for Cuba she must go across the Gulf of  
Mexico and The Caribbean Ocean  
Shes carrying a human cargo 83 good companeros  
Each one burning with determination to be free  
  
Chorus  
  
Against Batista The Fidelistas courage was their armour As they fought at  
Fidels side with Che Guevara  
  
Five days out from Mexico these Companeros  
Landed on the Cuban beach Los Colarados  
Fidel said this year will see our country and our people free Or else we  
Will be martyrs  
Weve only guns enough for 20 the enemy has arms a plenty  
Meet him and defeat him and hell keep us well supplied  
  
Chorus  
  
Five weeks later in the Canyon De La Rio  
Fidels army was reduced to 18 Companeros  
Hungry weak and unafraid learning revolutions trade in the high Sierra  
Maestre  
Where the mountain winds did blow bearing seeds to sprout and sow  
New crops in Cuban soil that marked the death of slavery  
  
Chorus  
  
Companeros tu valaderos Please correct if wrong  cm  
Courage was their armour as they fought at Fidels side with Che Guevara  
  
They made their way across the peak of El Torquino  
Joined by bands of volunteers and the men from Santiago  
They faced Batistas tanks and trains drove them back across the plains  
From the high Sierra Maestre  
They drove the gangsters from Los Vios straight across the Cordileros  
Santa Barbra fell to Che Guevara and was free  
The fire lit on that Cuban beach by Fidel Castro  
Still shines all the way to Terra del Fuego  
Sparks are blown upon the breeze people rise from off their knees when  
They see the night is burning  
It blazes up in Venezuela Bolivia and Guatamala  
Lights the road that we must go in order to be free
