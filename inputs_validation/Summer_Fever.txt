Winds may come and winds may blow  
But theres no wind can cure me of my fever  
Summer fever  
Time of love time of year  
Temperatures rising our bodies near in fever  
Summer fever fever summer fever  
Heat wave run dog day night  
Were making love things are right with fever  
Summer fever  
You burn so deep with your love so sweet  
And you satisfy and mystify my fever  
Summer fever fever summer fever  
Fever summer fever  
Body to body arms entwined  
Locked in your love and feeling fine with fever  
Summer fever  
Its the time of love the time of year  
Temperatures rising our bodies near in fever  
Summer fever fever summer fever  
Fever summer fever fever summer fever  
Summer summer fever  
Summer summer fever  
Summer summer fever  
Summer summer fever  
Summer summer fever  
Summer summer fever  
Summer summer fever  
Winds may come and winds may blow  
But theres no wind can cure me of my fever I got  
Summer fever I got  
You burn so deep your love so sweet  
And you satisfy and mystify my fever I got  
Summer fever I got
