has been released on  
  
  
Casey Jones he was a mighty man  
But now hes resting in the promised land  
The only thing he could understand  
Was an eight wheel driver under his command  
He made the freight train boogie  
All the time  
He made the freight train boogie  
As he rolled down the line  
  
Whoo whoo wah wah  
Whoo whoo wah wah  
Whoo whoo wah wah  
Whoo whoo wah wah  
He made the freight train boggle  
As he rolled down the line
