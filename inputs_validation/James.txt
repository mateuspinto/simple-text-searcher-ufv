James we were always friends  
From our childhood days  
And we made our plans  
And we had to go our separate ways  
I went on the road  
You pursued an education  
  
James do you like your life  
Can you find release  
Will you ever change  
Will you ever write your masterpiece  
Are you still in school  
Living up to expectations James  
  
You were so relied upon  
Everybody knows how hard you tried  
Hey look at what a job youve done  
Carrying the weight of family pride  
  
James youve been well behaved  
Youve been working hard  
But will you always stay  
Someone elses dream of who you are  
Do whats good for you or youre not good for anybody James  
  
I went on the road  
You pursued an education James  
  
How you gonna know for sure  
Everything was so well organized  
Hey now everything is so secure  
And everybody else is satisfied  
  
James do you like your life  
Can you find release  
Will you ever change  
When will you write your masterpiece  
Do whats good for you or youre not good for anybody James
