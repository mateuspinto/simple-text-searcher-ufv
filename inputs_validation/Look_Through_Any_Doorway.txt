Look through any doorway  
Each life will tell its story  
See the joy and heartbreak  
For all the world to see  
Shes on the city streets  
On her face is desolation  
Just a kid from out of town  
In the land of hope and glory  
Look through any doorway  
Each life will tell its story  
See the joy and heartbreak  
For all the world to see  
Open up your heart  
Open up the highway  
The road will stretch before you  
For there will be a new day  
Where love will show the way  
Only shadows of the world we left behind  
Open up your heart  
Many shadows of the past so dont look back  
Look at the wars  
A part of greed affects us all  
Theres a better way despite what they do or say  
People of the world  
Look through any doorway  
Tell me what you see  
Open up your heartache  
And love will show the way  
Searching for the way  
Through all the doubt and sorrow  
Days turn into years  
But well build a new tomorrow  
Look through any doorway  
Each life will bear its treasure  
Open up your heartache  
And love will show the way  
All the shadows of the world we left behind  
Open up your heart  
Many shadows of the past so dont look back  
Open up your heart  
Open up your heart  
Look through any doorway  
Tell me what you see  
Look through any doorway
