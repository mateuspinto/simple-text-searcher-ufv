Down at Backwater junction rolling down the line  
In the dark early morning I heard the onefortynine  
I was walking down the highway needed somewhere to go  
A lady laid beside me and she invited me home  
She led me cold tired and hungry down the backwater road  
  
In a house on the corner looking over the track  
I woke up with a fever and a pain in my back  
She was lying there beside me my fever started to grow  
Had a funny feeling but the lady said no  
My lover needs a doctor down the Backwater Road  
  
Whatcha lookin for whatcha lookin for  
Lady do you know what cha lookin for  
Was I wrong to play along  
Lady was I right or lady was I wrong  
  
Backwater doctor youve got me breathing in time  
Its tenthirty in the morning and Im feeling alright  
I went back to my lady but I wasnt to know  
Lady left this morning and shes not coming home  
I was cold when she left me down the Backwater Road  
  
I am just a poor man got nowhere to go  
All my leaves have fallen left me all alone  
If I was a rich man if I was a king  
I would give you all I have give you everything  
If youd just take me just take me now  
If youd just take me  
  
Never seen my daddy died when I was two  
Mama did the best she could taught me all she knew  
Said that love was everything tears came to her eyes  
Never knew the meaning now I realise  
Love is all you need all you need now  
If you just take me  
  
Im trying hard to get you Im not the only one  
Never had a big car but Im not on the run  
If love has got a meaning see it in my eyes  
If you see the beginning then youd realise  
Love is all you need all you
