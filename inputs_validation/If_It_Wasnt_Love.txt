Funny sometimes how you think  
You found someone  
Out of all the others you recall  
He stays a little longer on your mind  
The only one  
When life becomes the hardest place to fall  
  
If it wasnt love at all  
Then what were all those feelings and why  
If it wasnt love at all  
Cant I just go on dreamin  
  
Starting out at zero we built it up  
Built it up  
And made it more than  
Most will ever do  
Maybe it was just in times of need  
We stayed in touch  
But not enough to last one whole life through  
  
If it wasnt love at all  
Then what were all those feelings and why  
If it wasnt love at all  
Cant I just go on dreamin tonight  
  
Living for you now is all I want  
Who but you could ever really change  
This changing of mine  
Loving you I thought  
That I had found the other side  
  
If it wasnt love at all  
What were all those feelings and why  
If it wasnt love at all  
Cant I just go on dreamin  
Cant I just go on dreamin tonight
