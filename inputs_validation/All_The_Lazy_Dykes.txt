All the lazy dykes  
Cross armed at the palms  
Then legs astride their bikes  
Indigo burns on their arms  
One sweet day An emotional whirl  
You will be good to yourself  
And youll come and join the girls  
  
All the lazy dykes They pity how you live Just somebodys wife  
You give and you give  
And you give and you give  
Give and you give  
And one sweet day  
An emotional whirl  
You will be good to yourself  
And youll come and join the girls  
  
Touch me  
Squeeze me  
Hold me too tightly  
And when you look at me you actually see me  
And Ive  
Never felt so alive  
In the whole of my life  
In the whole of my life  
  
Free yourself Be yourself  
Come to the Palms and see yourself  
And at last your life begins  
At last your life begins  
At last your life begins  
At last your life begins
