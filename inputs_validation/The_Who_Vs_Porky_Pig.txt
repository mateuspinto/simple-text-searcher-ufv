Hey go  
Quick be off be sinking  
Lown down whale the navy wing  
It clears out congested arenas  
They sell rocking host balloons  
And theyre celebrating children  
And the weeping circus  
  
And the smokingnosed robot  
Tasted blackens the sticks  
Like clowns from a fire the albatross winks  
Faked to the back goes right wing shield  
All in a days work  
  
We met at one of the Kinks yeah  
We could come from the inner circle  
Of the dry   
Until it is just one trap  
One threaded
