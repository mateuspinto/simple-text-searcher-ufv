Its just another night and Im staring at the moon  
I saw a shooting star and thought of you  
I sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew  
If you were here Id sing to you  
Youre on the other side as this skyline splits in two  
Miles away from seeing you  
  
But I can see the stars from America  
I wondered do you see them too  
  
So open your eyes and see the way our horizons meet  
And all of the lights will lead into the night with me  
And I know these scars will bleed  
But both of our hearts believe  
All of these stars will guide us home  
  
I can hear your heart on the radio beats  
Theyre playing Chasing Cars and I thought of us  
Back to the time you were lying next to me  
I looked across and fell in love  
So I took your hand back through London streets and knew  
Everything led back to you  
  
So can you see the stars over Amsterdam  
Hear the song our heart is beating to  
  
So open your eyes and see the way our horizons meet  
And all of the lights will lead into the night with me  
And I know these scars will bleed  
But both of our hearts believe  
All of these stars will guide us home  
  
And all  
And all  
And all  
I can see the stars from America
