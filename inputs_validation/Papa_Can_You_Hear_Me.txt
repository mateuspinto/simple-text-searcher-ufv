Papa can you hear me  
Papa can you see me  
Papa can you find me in the night  
Papa are you near me  
Papa can you hear me  
Papa can you help me not be frightened  
  
Looking at the skies I see a million eyes  
Which ones are yours  
Where are you now  
That yesterday has waved goodbye  
And closed its doors  
The night is so much darker  
The wind is so much colder  
The world is so much bigger  
Now that I am alone  
  
Papa please forgive me  
I know you understand me  
Papa dont you know I had no choice  
Oh can you hear me prayin  
Anything Im sayin  
  
Even though the night is filled with voices  
I remember everything you ever taught me  
Evey book Ive ever read  
  
Can all the words  
All the music help me face whats ahead  
The trees are so much taller  
I feel so much smaller  
The moon is twice as lonely  
And the stars are half as bright  
  
Daddy how I love you  
Daddy how I need you  
Daddy how I miss you  
Kissing me goodnight
