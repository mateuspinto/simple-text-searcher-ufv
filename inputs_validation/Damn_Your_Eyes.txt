I can do what I want  
Im in complete control  
Thats what I tell myself  
I gotta a mind of my own  
Ill be alright alone  
Dont need anybody else  
I gave myself a good talking to  
No more bein a fool for you  
But I see ya  
And all I remember  
How you make me want to surrender  
Damn your eyes  
For taking my breath away  
Makin me want to stay  
Damn your eyes  
For gettin my hopes up high  
Making me fall in love again  
Damn your eyes  
Its always the same  
You say that youll change  
Somehow you never do  
I believe all your lies  
The look in your eyes  
You make it all seem true  
I guess I see what I want to see  
Or is it my heart just deceivin me  
Because with that look I know so well  
I fall completely under your spell  
Damn your eyes  
For takin my breath away  
For makin me want to stay  
Damn your eyes  
For gettin my hopes up high  
For makin me fall in love again  
Damn your eyes  
You keep deliberately deceivin me  
Makin me see what I want to see  
Damn your eyes  
For takin my breath away hey  
For makin me want to stay  
Damn your eyes  
For gettingmy hopes up high  
For making me fall in love again  
Damn your eyes  
Damn your eyes  
For taking my breath away  
Damn damn your eyes  
For getting my hopes up high  
For making me fall in love  
Fall in love again  
Damn damn your eyes
