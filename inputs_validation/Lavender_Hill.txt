I want to walk eternity  
In through the land of make believe  
And watch the clouds roll over me  
And let the sun shine down on me  
The only place that I want to be  
Lavender Hill for me  
Wish I could live on sugar and milk  
Then I could live on Lavender Hill  
Then I could raise my head to the sky  
And let the sun saturate me with love  
I want to walk you up Lavender Hill  
Everybody loves Lavender Hill  
Even the bird that sits in the tree  
Seems to sing sweet melodies  
Even the breeze is whispering  
Lavender Hill for me  
While people eat their biscuits with tea  
They dream of daffodils that sway in the breeze  
And every Sunday afternoon  
Tidy ladies shine their shoes  
And every little lady dreams  
Lavender memories  
Lavender Hill for me  
Lavender Hill for me  
I want to walk you up Lavender Hill  
I want to walk you up Lavender Hill
