On the day  
You were saved  
Heaven and hell marked you down  
Angels praise  
Devils raged  
Life became a battleground  
So when hell starts to move  
And the enemy marches on you  
Hang on its a fight  
Youve been marked by the army of night  
Youre a target  
  
When your heart  
Loved the dark  
Hell could just leave you alone  
With your life  
Filled with light  
You have become quite a foe  
  
So when hell starts to move  
And the enemy marches on you  
Hang on its a fight  
Its a battle of darkness and light  
  
Chorus  
When things get bad and you cant stand to look  
Its time to read to the end of the book  
Dont put it down til you get to the end  
When Jesus come and His Kingdom begins  
Til He comes  
God the Son  
Teaches us to use the sword  
And every fight  
Has a light  
When you know we win the war  
  
So when hell starts to move  
And the enemy marches on you  
Hang on its a fight  
Youre a part of the army of light  
  
Chorus
