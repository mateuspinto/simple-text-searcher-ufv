Original by John Hiatt  
  
My babys gone and I dont know why  
She let out this morning  
Like a rusty shot in a hollow sky  
Left me without warning  
Sooner than the dogs could bark  
And faster than the sun rose  
Down to the banks in an old mule car  
She took a flatboat across the shallow  
Chorus  
Left me in my tears to drown  
She left a baby daughter  
Now the waters wide and deep and brown  
Shes crossing muddy waters  
Tobacco standing in the fields  
Be rotten come November  
And a bitter heart will not reveal  
A spring that love remembers  
When that sweet brown girl of mine her black eyes are ravens  
We broke the bread and drank the wine  
From a jug that shed been saving  
Repeat chorus  
Babys crying and the daylights gone  
That big oak tree is groaning  
In rush of wind and river of song  
I can hear my sweetheart moaning  
Crying for her baby child  
Or crying for her husband  
Crying for that rivers wild  
To take her from her loved ones  
Repeat chorus twice
