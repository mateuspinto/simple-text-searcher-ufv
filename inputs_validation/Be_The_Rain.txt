Save the planet for another day  
Attention shoppers buy with a conscience and save  
Save the planet for another day  
Save Alaska let the caribou stay  
Dont care what the governments say  
Theyre all bought and paid for anyway  
Save the planet for another day  
Hey Big Oil what did you say  
  
We were runnin through the night  
Never knowin if we would see the light  
Paranoid schizophrenic visions  
Livin in fear of the wrong decisions  
We got to wake up  
We got to keep goin  
If they follow us  
Theres no way of knowin  
We got a job to do  
We got to save Mother Earth  
  
Be the ocean when it meets the sky  
You can make a difference if you really try  
Be the magic in the Northern lights  
Six Dayssix nights  
Be the river as it rolls along  
It has threeeyed fish and its smelling strong  
Be the rain you remember fallin  
Be the rain be the rain  
  
Yeah rain was fallin and were soakin wet  
Hail is beatin down on our heads  
The wind is blowin through our hair  
Faces frozen in the frigid air  
We got to get there  
Alaska  
We got to be there  
Before the big machines  
We got a job to do  
We got to save Mother Earth  
  
Dream the hunter on the western plain  
The birds are all gone where did they go  
Dream the fisherman in his boat  
Hes comin home empty hes barely afloat  
Dream the logger in the great northwest  
Theyre runnin out of trees they got to give it a rest  
Theres no other way to cut it  
Dream the farmer in the old heartland  
Corporate greed and chemicals are killin the land  
  
Next mornin Sun was up at dawn  
She looked around and Earth was gone  
Dark visions he had last night  
He needed peace he needed light  
He heard the rumble and  
He saw the big machines  
The green army rose  
It was a bad dream  
He had a job to do  
He had to save Mother Earth  
  
Be the ocean when it meets the sky  
Greek freighters are dumping crap somewhere right now  
Be the magic in the northern lights  
The ice is melting  
Be the river as it rolls along  
Toxic waste dumpin from corporate farms  
Be the rain you remember fallin  
Be the rain be the rain  
Save the Planet for another day  
Be the rain be the rain  
Be the river as it rolls along  
Be the rain be the rain
