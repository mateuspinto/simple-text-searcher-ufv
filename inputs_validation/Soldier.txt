Soldier  
Stand for the truth you stand alone  
Government will cover up  
I saw a man sitting in a room  
Holding a gun to his head  
He said man oh man  
What am I gonna do  
I cant change the past but I can change the future  
If I pull this trigger right now right here  
Everything will be over  
Not a day goes by I dont see them in my dreams  
Not a day goes by I dont hear them screaming in my ears  
Begging for mercy pleading innocent  
Since my heart is made up to be as cold  
As the barrel of this gun I hold  
I would pull the trigger anyway  
  
Chorus  
I was a soldier following instructions from a man  
We have known as the general  
So many medals so many praises  
Nothing can take away the guilt  
That I feel inside me  
Government covered up every crime we committed  
Against human kind  
Not a day goes by I dont see them in my dreams  
Not a day goes by I dont hear them crying in my ears
