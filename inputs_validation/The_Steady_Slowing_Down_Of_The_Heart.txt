Moonlight shines on you and me  
Got the sailors back from the sea  
You try sleeping but all that you hear is  
The steady slowing down of my heart  
Its not that you get lazy  
Its not about getting old  
Its not that you get up in the morning  
Wishing you never woke  
The car I drive is built to last  
It does not go particularly fast  
Im in no great hurry is that caused of the effect of  
The steady slowing down of my heart  
Its not that I got lazy  
Its not about getting old  
Cause theres no miracle cure for getting used to someone  
And now jimmy spends a fortune because hes down to twice a week  
His shrink says a crisis in midlife is only natural well well well  
Julie got a facelift you know shes only 33  
Jesus may I give thanks to brigitte bardot  
You try sleeping now that all that you hear  
Is the steady slowing down of my heart  
Its not that I got lazy  
Its not that I got old  
Its just theres no miracle cure you know  
To getting used to someone  
The moonlight shines on you and me  
Brings the sailors back from the sea  
As I lie sleeping down my side  
All that you hear is  
The steady slowing down of my heart  
Its not that you get lazy  
Its not about getting old  
Its not that you get up in the morning and wish you never woke  
But then julie was aroused by jimmys lack of self esteem  
The shrink says when a man takes a mistress its often helpful  
Well well well jimmy asked for heaven she was happy to ablige  
His shrink said guess this was a bad year to quit smoking
