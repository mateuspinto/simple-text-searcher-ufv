As I sat sadly by her side  
At the window through the glass  
She stroked a kitten in her lap  
And we watched the world as it fell past  
Softly she spoke these words to me  
With brand new eyes open wide  
We pressed our faces to the glass  
As I sat sadly by her side  
She said father mother sister brother  
Uncle aunt and nephew niece  
Soldier sailor physician laborer  
Actor scientist mechanic priest  
Earth and moon and sun and stars  
And planets and comets with tails blazin  
All are there forever fallin  
Fallin lovely and amazin  
Then she smiled and turned to me  
And waited for me to reply  
Her hair was fallin down her shoulders  
As I sat sadly by her side  
As I sat sadly by her side  
The kitten she did gently pass  
Over to me and again we pressed  
Our different faces to the glass  
That may be very well I said  
But watch the one fallin in the street  
See him gesture to his neighbors  
And see him trampled beneath their feet  
All outward motion connects to nothin  
For each is concerned with their immediate need  
Witness the man reachin up from the gutter  
See the other one stumblin on who can not see  
With tremblin hand I turned toward her  
And pushed the hair out of her eyes  
The kitten jumped back to her lap  
As I sat sadly by her side  
Then she drew the curtains down  
And said oh when will you ever learn  
That what happens there beyond the glass  
Is simply none of your concern  
God has given you but one heart  
You are not a home for the hearts of your brothers  
And God does not care for your benevolence  
Anymore than he cares for the lack of it in others  
Nor does he care for you to sit  
At windows in judgment of the world He created  
While sorrows pile up around you  
Ugly useless and over inflated  
At which she turned her head away  
Great tears leapin from her eyes  
I could not wipe the smile from my face  
As I sat sadly by her side  
As I sat sadly by her side  
As I sat sadly by her side  
As I sat sadly by her side
