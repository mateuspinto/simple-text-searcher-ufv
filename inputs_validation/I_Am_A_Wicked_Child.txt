Mother Mary come for me  
For I am a wicked child  
I have sinned and I am so confused  
For I am a wicked child  
I am a wicked child  
  
I am the Devils son  
And I wish I could be good  
I walk the crooked mile  
Yeah I wish I could be good  
I wish I could be good  
  
If I could have kept on the straight and narrow  
If I could have kept on the straight and narrow  
But God broke your heart  
God broke your heart  
  
Now I wake up in the night  
Hes tugging at my arms and legs  
Like I was a marionette  
Send baby Jesus  
To radiate his lie  
To radiate his lie
