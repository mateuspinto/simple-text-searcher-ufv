Call your mother long distance tell her to expect your body home  
  
If the city dont bury you baby lord knows the county will  
If the city dont bury you baby lord knows the county will  
  
You made your last mistake you going way out on that boot hill

Lord I dont want to wax you baby cause you gave me my first thrill  
You did me so wrong youre going way out on that boot hill
