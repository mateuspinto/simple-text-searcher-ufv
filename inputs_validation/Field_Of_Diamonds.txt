Field of diamonds in the sky worlds are whirling right on by  
Are you wondering who am I Fields of diamonds in the sky  
Am I just a star in some crown  
Or someones life sun going down down down  
Field of diamonds in the sky silent beauty shining high  
Are you tears the angels cry Field of diamonds in the sky  
  
Field of diamonds in the sky like the night you pass me by  
I could touch you if I tried fields of diamonds in the sky  
Am I just a star in some crown  
Or someones life sun going down down down  
  
Field of diamonds in the sky silent beauty shining high  
Are you tears the angels cry Field of diamonds in the sky
