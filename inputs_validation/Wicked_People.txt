Go to hell come to me  
For I am a wicked child  
I sin and I so confuse  
And I am a wicked child  
I am a wicked child  
  
I am the devils son  
And I wish I could be good  
Keep you satisfied  
Yeah I wish I could be good  
I wish I could be good  
  
Go to hell and come to me  
For I am a wicked child  
I sin and I so confuse  
Yeah I am a wicked child  
I am a wicked child  
  
  
I wanna be good  
I wanna be good
