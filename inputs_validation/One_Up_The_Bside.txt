Get it up keep it up  
As good as you can  
The change is good as the rest is  
To be or not to be when shit hits the fan  
This is the ultimate test

The bent overture  
Let me hear it at my request  
You may think its funny but I dont know why  
It gets it all off your chest

One up the bsidex2

Just another time or else ill lose my mind  
The answers simple and straight to the point  
You can see it coming from behind
