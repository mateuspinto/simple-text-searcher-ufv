When you come across the sea  
Me like a beacon guiding you to safety  
The sooner the better now  
And when you come the hills  
Will breathe like a baby  
Pulled up heaving from the bottom of the ocean  
The sooner the better now  
When you come to cover me with your kisses  
Fresh like a daisy chained up in a lions den  
Ill know you by the thunderclap  
Pouring like a rain of blood to my emotions  
And that is why  
I stumble to my knees  
And why underneath the heavens  
With the stars burning and exploding  
I know I could never let you down  
  
When you come like an iceberg float in darkness  
Smashing my hull send me to the bottom of the sea  
I should know you better now  
When you come your majesty  
To entrap me  
Prince of light receding  
The sooner the better now  
And when you come to cover me  
With your kisses hard like armour  
The sooner the better now  
Ill know you by the thunderclap  
Pouring like a rain of blood to my emotions  
  
And that is why  
I stumble to my knees  
And why underneath the heavens  
With the stars burning and exploding  
I know I could never let you down  
  
She came out of the water  
Into my horizon  
Like a cumulo nimbus  
Coming in from a distance  
Burning and exploding  
Burning and exploding  
Like a slow volcano  
When you come  
Cover the ground with ashes  
When you come
