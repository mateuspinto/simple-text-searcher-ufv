I remember the day  
Seems so far away  
When I walked into your life  
And the look in your eyes  
How it took you by surprise  
But it felt so right  
Then I drew you in  
Told you anything  
cause I wanted you so bad  
Girl I led you on  
Said theres nothing wrong  
In giving your heart to me  
But when it comes to love  
I should know better  
When it comes to love  
I take the blame  
cause you are the one I shouldve held on to  
Yeah it coulda ben you  
I never realized  
How time was on my side  
Lost sight of my perfect world  
And the man that Ive become  
From the damage that Ive done  
Its so clear to me now  
But I wished that I  
Never was the kind  
To steal a lonely heart  
And I didnt see how good you were for me  
Now its too late to go back  
cause when it comes to love  
I should know better  
When it comes to love  
I take the blame  
cause you are the one I shouldve held on to  
When it comes to love  
Girl I cant help it  
When it comes to love  
I always lose my way  
And you are the one I shouldve held on to  
Ah it coulda been you  
Making a change in my heart  
Finding a new place to start  
Wondering what I can do  
Will I ever get over you no  
When it comes to love  
I should know better  
When it comes to love  
I take the blame  
cause you are the one I shouldve held on to  
When it comes to love  
Girl I cant help it  
When it comes to love  
I always lose my way  
And you are the one I shouldve held on to  
Ah it couldve been you
