Livin with my eyes closed goin day to day  
I never knew the difference I never cared either way  
Lookin for a reason searchin for a sign  
Reachin out with both hands I gotta feel the kick inside  
All fired up  
Now I believe there comes a time  
All fired up  
When everything just falls in line  
All fired up  
We live an learn from our mistakes  
All fired up fired up fired up hey  
  
Aint nobody livin in a perfect world  
Everybodys out there cryin to be heard  
Now I got a new fire burnin in my eyes  
Lightin up the darkness movin like a meteorite  
  
Chorus  
All fired up  
Now I believe there comes a time  
All fired up  
When everything just falls in line  
All fired up  
We live an learn from our mistakes  
All fired up fired up fired up  
The deepest cuts are healed by faith  
Now I believe there comes a time  
When everything just falls in line  
We live an learn from our mistakes  
The deepest cuts are healed by faith  
  
Now I believe there comes a time  
When everything just falls in line  
We live an learn from our mistakes  
The deepest cuts are healed by faith  
Now I believe there comes a time  
When everything just falls in line  
We live an learn from our mistakes  
The deepest cuts are healed by faith  
Now I believe there comes a time  
When everything just falls in line  
We live an learn from our mistakes  
The deepest cuts are healed by faith  
Now I believe  
  
Chorus
