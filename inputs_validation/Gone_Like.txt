Shes taken to walking alone in the evening  
Shes taken to sleeping all night in his chair  
Together they both had a reason for living  
Back when the felling of loving was there  
Then she took to dreaming when he wasnt looking  
And he took to looking for moments alone  
Together they drifted apart from each other  
Together they both knew the felling was gone  
Gone like the sparrow south for the winter  
Gone like the river out to the sea  
Gone like the leaves from the trees when its snowing  
Gone like the love that they once gave so free  
Till he took to starring at his lonesome shadow  
And she took to humming the words to some song  
They both felt it slipping that feeling of giving  
Leaving the feeling of being alone  
Each of them reach out for the other  
Together they go though the motions alone  
Trying to pretend that nothing else matters  
Making believe that their love isnt gone
