We stood and watched the river flow  
We were too young to really know  
In the country fair  
Oh in the country fair  
  
We laid out in the long green grass  
And never thought that it would pass  
In the country fair  
In the country fair  
  
On an old on an old open day  
On an old rain shine open day  
In the country fair  
In the cool night air  
In sweet summer time  
  
We counted pebbles in the sand  
Sand like time slippin through our hand  
In the country fair  
In the country fair  
  
On an old on an old open day  
On an old rain track open day  
In the country fair  
In the cool night air  
In sweet summer time  
  
Hmmm mmmm  
On an old open day  
On an old  
Pine cone open day
