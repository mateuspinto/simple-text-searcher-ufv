Fabolous  Verse 1  
Ha ha sicker than yo average  
Oh you think you hot  
Ill come through quicker than a maverick  
Shut ya heat down youll quickly be embarrassed  
Come through where you live flick it up like Dallas  
Stick to living savage Ill stick to living lavish  
Picking up a bad bitch the chick look like my adlibs niiice  
She calling me Fab Pitt you can be my Jolie  
Swing big sticks shorty you can be my goalie  
You ask too many questions yo you can be the police

My car like a hospital with the windows tinted cause  
You cant see me but you know a sick nigga in it right
