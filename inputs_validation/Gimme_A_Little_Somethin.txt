My life is not as easy as you say  
My life is not anything but as the day  
My life is surrounded by the things of the day that have gone  
My world is built on everything that I want can be won  
  
Gimme a little somethin to help me on my way Repeat x2  
  
My heart is not as cold as you can say  
My heart is not anything but as the day  
My heart is warmed by the way that you love and are gone  
My life is founded on the thoughts that we two are just one  
  
Gimme a little somethin to help me on my way Repeat x5
