Changing moving in a circle  
I can see your face in all of my dreams  
Smiling laughing from the shadows  
When I hear your voice I know what it means  
I know it doesnt matter just how hard I try  
Youre all the reason for my life  
  
Disillusion disillusions all you left for me  
How can I forget you when my world is breaking down  
Youre all I had youre all I want  
Disillusion disillusions now thats all I have  
  
Wishing hoping chasing shadows  
Did I see your face somewhere in the crowd  
Thinking wondering what youre doing  
I cant stop myself from crying out loud  
They say my wound will heal and only leave a scar  
But then they never shared our love  
  
Disillusion disillusions all you left for me  
How can I forget you when my world is breaking down  
Youre all I had youre all I want  
Disillusion disillusions now thats all I have  
  
Disillusion disillusions now thats all I have
