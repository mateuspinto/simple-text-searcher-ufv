Respect her shes the one  
Our seasons change with each sign  
Truth lies in her bones  
Our choices now it faked everyone  
I I I I  
Like a river cuts through the mountains  
To the sun  
The truth cannot be changed  
It has come  
There are leaders who lead  
But our leaders prefer to deceive  
As our oceans they rise they rise  
Still now they choose to deny  
I I I I  
Like a river cuts through the mountains  
To the sun  
The truth cannot be changed  
It has come yeah  
So respect her shes the one
