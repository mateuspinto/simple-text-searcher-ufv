How many times have I been around  
Recycled papers paving the ground  
Well she lives for the written word  
And people come second or possibly third  
  
And there is no style but I say well done  
To the girl least likely to  
Oh deep in my heart how I wish I was wrong  
But deep in my heart I know I am not  
And theres enough gloom in her world Im certain  
Without my contribution  
  
So I sit and I smile and I say well done  
To the girl least likely to  
Page after page of sniping rage  
An English singe or an American tinge  
Theres a publisher she said in the new year  
Its never in this year  
  
I do think this but I cant admit it  
To the girl least likely to  
So one more song with no technique  
One more song which seems all wrong  
And oh the news is bad again  
See me as I am again  
  
And the scales of justice sway one way  
In the rooms of those least likely to  
Oh deep in my heart how I want to be wrong  
But the moods and the styles too frequently change  
From twenty one to twenty five from twenty five to twenty nine  
  
And I sit and I smile and I say well done  
To the girl least likely to  
Oh one more song about The Queen  
Or standing around the shops with thieves  
But somebodys got to make it she screams  
So why why cant it be me  
But she would die if we heard her sing from the heart  
Which is hurt  
  
So how many times will I shed a tear  
And another stage of verse to cheer  
When you shine in the public eye my dear  
Please remember these nights  
When I sit and support with a dutiful smile  
Because theres nothing I can say  
So chucking churning and turning the knife  
On everything except their own life  
And a clock somewhere strikes midnight  
And an explanation  it drains me  
If only there could be a way  
  
There is a different mood all over the world  
A different youth unfamiliar views  
And dearest it could all be for you  
So will you come down and Ill meet you  
And with no more poems with nothing to hear  
Oh darling its all for you  
Darling its all for you  
Oh darling its all for you  
Oh darling its all for you
