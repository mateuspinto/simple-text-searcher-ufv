Sittin by myself in the summertime when the heat is burnin down  
Watchin the golden crops in the field just growin without a sound  
I was a boy raised in the country and its still a part of me  
And you see no matter where I go its a beautiful memory  
Rise with sun at the break of day lookin out my window  
Its the same as yesterday  
Sittin under an old oak tree pickin my guitar in the shade  
That old tree spreadin over my head is the closest friend I made  
Just me and some lonely wooden music floatin through air  
The grass is rustlin and the birds are singin and my heart dont have a care  
Still another day finds me in the fields sweat is soakin up my ragged
clothes  
But Id rather work than steal  
Watchin the sun settle down over open Texas land looking at the cattle and
the horses runnin wild as they can  
Life was different in the old days you just get a days work done  
When you were finished workin in the fields there was chores at home to be
done  
I was always hearin music always wanna play me some  
As a fulltime friend or the way to ease the end of a woman that swayed me
some  
Hearin those tunes always had a way of soothin out my soul  
When times got hard and work got slow it was music that kept me whole  
Sun beatin down through the trees gets so hot bring a workin man to his
knees  
Part of my heart part of my soul part of a melody  
Hands are clappin and people swayin in simple harmony  
Life was different in the old days you just get a days work done  
When you finished workin in the fields there was chores at home to be done  
Late in the evenin on the front porch when the sun is settin in the west  
Me and the boys pass around the bottle and sing what we like best  
Sing about our wives sing about our children singin out the Delta blues  
Were simple folks and we like it that way got nothin left to lose
