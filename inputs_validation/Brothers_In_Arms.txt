These mist covered mountains  
Are a home now for me  
But my home is the lowlands  
And always will be  
Someday youll return to  
Your valleys and your farms  
And youll no longer burn  
To be brothers in arms  
  
Through these fields of destruction  
Baptisms of fire  
Ive witnessed your suffering  
As the battle raged higher  
And though they did hurt me so bad  
In the fear and alarm  
You did not desert me  
My brothers in arms  
  
Theres so many different worlds  
So many different suns  
And we have just one world  
But we live in different ones  
  
Now the suns gone to hell and  
The moons riding high  
Let me bid you farewell  
Every man has to die  
But its written in the starlight  
And every line in your palm  
We are fools to make war  
On our brothers in arms
