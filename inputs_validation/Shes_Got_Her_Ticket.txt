Shes got her ticket  
I think she gonna use it  
I think she going to fly away  
No one should try and stop her  
Persuade her with their power  
She says that her mind is made up  
  
Why not leave why not  
Go away  
Too much hatred  
Corruption and greed  
Give your life  
And invariably they leave you with  
Nothing  
  
Young girl aint got no chances  
No roots to keep her strong  
Shes shed all pretenses  
That someday shell belong  
Some folks call her a runaway  
A failure in the race  
But she knows where her ticket takes her  
She will find her place in the sun  
  
And shell fly fly fly
