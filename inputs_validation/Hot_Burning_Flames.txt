She left me almost burned out  
I couldnt feel a thing  
A walkin talkin statue  
Afraid to love again  
She did everything to kill a flame  
But a little spark got through  
Shed of got her way  
Id be gone today  
If it hadnt been for you  
  
You turn cold gray ashes into  
Hot burning flames  
Im alive with love because of you  
When you came to light the fire  
I knew just what to bring  
You turn cold gray ashes into  
Hot burning flames  
  
She thought she had me down and out  
But at the count of nine  
A livin lovin angel  
Showed up just in time  
She thought that I would surely die  
Sometimes I wanted to  
She had no doubt  
The fire was out  
But she didnt count on you  
  
You turn cold gray ashes into  
Hot burning flames  
Im alive with love because of you  
When you came to light the fire  
I knew just what to bring  
You turn cold gray ashes into  
Hot burning flames  
  
You turn cold gray ashes into  
Hot burning flames  
Im alive with love because of you  
When you came to light the fire  
I knew just what to bring  
You turn cold gray ashes into  
Hot burning flames  
  
You turn cold gray ashes into  
Hot burning flames
