Follow Me Around  
I see you in the dark  
Corner of the street  
Coming after me Yah  
  
Headlights on fullbeam  
Coming down the fast lane  
Coming after me Yah  
  
You follow me around  
You follow me around  
  
Nowadays I get panicked  
I cease to exist  
I cease to exist  
  
I feel absolutely nothing  
The words are out of ink  
The words you know are out of ink  
  
They follow me around  
They follow me around  
  
Did you lie to us Tony  
We thought you were different  
Now you know were not so sure  
  
Drooling Looney tunes  
Moving in a swarm  
Moving in a swarm  
  
They follow me around  
They follow me around  
They follow me around  
They follow me around
