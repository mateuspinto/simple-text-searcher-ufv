I open up my door to greet the early morning sun  
Closing it behind me and away I do run  
To the meadow where the meadow lark  
Is singing in the tree  
In the meadow I go walking  
In the early morning breeze  
  
I cup my hands to catch a multicolored butterfly  
Perched upon the petals of flowers growing wild  
Freeing it I watch it as it flies away from me  
To visit with the flowers in the early morning breeze  
  
Rainbow colored flowers kissed with early morning sun  
The aster and the dahlia and wild geraniums  
Drops of morning dew still lingers on the iris leaves  
In the meadow where Im walking  
In the early morning breeze  
  
Mistyeyed I look about the meadow where I stray  
For its there I find the courage to greet the coming day  
For there among the flowers I kneel gently to my knees  
To have a word with God in the early morning breeze  
  
A rainbow colored meadow kissed with early morning sun  
The aster and the dahlia and wild geraniums  
Drops of morning dew still lingers on the iris leaves  
In the meadow where Im walking  
In the early morning breeze
