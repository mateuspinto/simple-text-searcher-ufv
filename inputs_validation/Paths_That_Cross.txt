Speak to me  
Speak to me heart  
I feel a needing  
To bridge the clouds  
Softly go  
A way I wish to know  
A way I wish to know  
  
Oh youll ride  
Surely dance  
In a ring  
Backwards and forwards  
Those who seek  
Feel the glow  
A glow we will all know  
A glow we will all know  
  
On that day  
Filled with grace  
And the hearts communion  
Steps we take  
Steps we trace  
Into the light of reunion  
  
Paths that cross  
Will cross again  
Paths that cross  
Will cross again  
  
Speak to me  
Speak to me shadow  
I spin from the wheel  
Nothing at all  
Save the need  
The need to weave  
A silk of souls  
That whisper whisper  
A silk of souls  
That whispers to me  
  
Speak to me heart  
All things renew  
Hearts will mend  
Round the bend  
Paths that cross  
Cross again  
Paths that cross  
Will cross again  
  
Rise up hold the reins  
Well meet again I dont know when  
Hold tight bye bye  
Paths that cross  
Will cross again  
Paths that cross  
Will cross again
