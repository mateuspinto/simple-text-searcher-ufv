Today as I was walking  
In the fields just down the way  
I sat down on a fallen log  
To pass the time away  
And as I looked around me  
The more that I did look  
The more I realize that I am viewing  
Gods coloring book  
I saw a golden ray of sunlight  
A silver drop of dew  
A soft white floating cloud  
Sailing cross the sky a blue  
A yellow dandelion  
Pretty evergreen  
And some red and orange flowers  
Growing wild along the stream  
And the more I look around me  
And the more that I do look  
The more I realize that I am viewing  
Gods coloring book  
The greyness in an old mans hair  
The pink in babys cheeks  
The blackness in a stormy sky  
The brown in fallen leaves  
And the multicolored rainbow  
Stretched out across the sky  
And the purple haze at sunset  
Just before the night  
And the more I look around me  
And the more that I do look  
The more I realize that I am viewing  
Gods coloring book  
Then I turn my face toward the sky  
And say a silent prayer  
Though God doesnt speak to me  
I see him everywhere  
He is all around me  
Hes everywhere I look  
And each new day is but a new page  
In gods coloring book  
Tag  
Each new day is but a new page  
In gods coloring book  
Hmmmmmm
