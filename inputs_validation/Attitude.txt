Suppose I say  
Im never satisfied  
Suppose I say  
You cut some root  
To make the tree survive  
Just let me kill you for a while  
Just let me kill you for a smile  
Just let me kill you once  
Im oh so bored to death  
Oh I hunger  
I hunger  
I eat  
Born into attitude  
Asleep at the wheel  
Throw all your bullets in the fire  
And run like hell  
Why cure the fever  
What ever happened to sweat  
Suppose I say  
The vultures smile at me  
Suppose I say  
I set them down  
They plan to pick you clean  
And satisfaction this way comes  
And satisfaction this way comes  
And satisfactions here and gone  
Gone yeah and gone again  
Oh I hunger  
Oh I hunger  
I eat  
Born into attitude  
Asleep at the wheel  
Throw all your bullets in the fire  
And stand there  
Born into attitude  
Twist mother tongue  
Throw all your bullets in the fire  
And run like hell  
Why cure the fever  
What ever happened to sweat  
Just let me kill you for a while  
Just let me kill you for a smile  
Just let me kill you once for me  
Im bored to death  
And satisfaction this way comes  
And satisfaction this way comes  
And satisfactions here and gone  
Gone gone again  
Yeah I hunger  
Oh I hunger  
I eat  
Born into attitude  
Asleep at the wheel  
Throw all your bullets in the fire  
And stand there  
Born into attitude  
Twist mother tongue  
Throwing all your bullets in the fire  
And run like hell  
Why cure the fever  
What ever happened to sweat
