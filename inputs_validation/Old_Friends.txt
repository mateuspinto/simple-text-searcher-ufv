Old friends old friends sat on their parkbench like bookends  
A newspaper blowin through the grass  
Falls on the round toes of the high shoes of the old friends  
Old friends winter companions the old men  
Lost in their overcoats waiting for the sunset  
The sounds of the city sifting through trees  
Settles like dust on the shoulders of the old friends  
Can you imagine us years from today sharing a parkbench quietly  
How terribly strange to be seventy  
Old friends memory brushes the same years silently sharing the same fears  
  
Time it was and what a time it was it was  
A time of innocence a time of confidences  
Long ago it must be I have a photograph preserve your memories  
There all thats left of you
