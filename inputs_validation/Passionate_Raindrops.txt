The days been hot and sunny  
Evenings about to take control  
The sky is painting pictures  
Stirring up love bliss in our souls  
The breeze carries the fragrance  
Of the sweetest symphony as it blows through your hair  
Better can be nowhere  
Our voices turn to whispers  
Blending with rhythms of the night  
The nightingales sing a love song  
Glancing down at us in their flight  
The moisture brings forth magic  
That permeates the midnight air  
To kiss the love we share are  
Raindrops passionate raindrops  
The kind of rain that writes theyre  
So in love on our skin  
Raindrops that we hope wont stop  
Cooling the red hot love that we are making  
Raindrops passionate raindrops  
That brings out all the fire that we have within  
Raindrops cover every spot  
Right to the last drop  
We want all of you and then  
Let each drop a rain be a lifetime that our love wont end  
Somewhere in our doing  
Trying to make our bodies one  
We fall prey to moon dreams  
Till awaken by the morning sun  
Still disorientated  
I feel something warm on my face  
Coupled by your embrace  
We gaze in awe and wonder  
As if we cant believe its so  
Just that taste of heaven  
Has got us longing for much more  
We lie there impatient  
Anxiously waiting foe the sun to go in  
And the clouds to burst again to give us  
Raindrops passionate raindrops  
The kind of rain that writes theyre  
So in love on our skin  
Raindrops that we hope wont stop  
Cooling the red hot love that we are making  
Raindrops passionate raindrops  
That brings out all the fire that we have within  
Raindrops cover every spot  
Right to the last drop  
We want all of you and then  
Let each drop a rain be a lifetime that our love wont end
