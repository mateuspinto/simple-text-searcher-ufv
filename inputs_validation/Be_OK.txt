Chorus  
Open me up and you will see  
Im a gallery of broken hearts  
Im beyond repair let me be  
And give me back my broken parts

I just want to know today know today know today  
Know that maybe I will be okay

Just give them back to me please  
Just give me back my pieces  
And let me hold my broken parts  
  
I just want to be okay be okay be okay  
I just want to be okay today

I just want to know today know today know today  
Know that maybe I will be okay  
Know that maybe I will be okay  
Know that maybe I will be okay
