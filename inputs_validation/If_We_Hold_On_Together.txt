Dont lose your way  
With each passing day  
Youve come so far  
Dont throw it away  
Live believing  
Dreams are for weaving  
Wonders are waiting to start  
Live your story  
Faith hope and glory  
Hold to the truth in your heart  
  
If we hold on together  
I know our dreams will never die  
Dreams see us through to forever  
Where clouds roll by  
For you and I  
  
Souls in the wind  
Must learn how to bend  
Seek out a star  
Hold on to the end  
Valley mountain  
There is a fountain  
Washes our tears all away  
Words are swaying  
Somebody is praying  
Please let us come home to stay  
  
If we hold on together  
I know our dreams will never die  
Dreams see us through to forever  
Where clouds roll by  
For you and I  
  
When we are out there in the dark  
Well dream about the sun  
In the dark well feel the light  
Warm our hearts everyone  
  
If we hold on together  
I know our dreams will never die  
Dreams see us through to forever  
As high as souls can fly  
The clouds roll by  
For you and I
