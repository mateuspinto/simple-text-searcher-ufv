A child of winter  
A child of the snow  
Im making a snowball  
That someone will throw  
Im making a snowman  
With charcoal for the eyes  
A scarf draped in red  
And a derby on his head  
  
Here comes santa claus here comes santa claus  
Right down santa claus lane  
Vixen and blitzen and all his reindeer are pulling on the reins  
Bells are ringing children singing  
All is merry and bright  
Hang your stockings and say your prayers  
cause santa claus comes tonight  
  
The evening of christmas  
Presents have been passed  
The wood in the fireplace  
Is glowing its last  
Im closing my eyes now  
In my bed Im snuggling  
Outside my window  
The carolers sing  
  
Christmas comes and the snow covers all  
Trees are decorated with tinsel and lights  
Mamas in the kitchen making cookies and bread  
The children are hungry theyre waiting to be fed  
  
A child of christmas  
A child of snow  
A wonderful feeling  
Underneath the mistletoe  
And may your christmas  
Last all year  
With laughter of children  
Peace and cheer  
  
A child of christmas  
A child of snow  
A wonderful feeling  
Underneath the mistletoe  
Merry christmas to you  
Ding dong ding go the bells  
Ding dong ding go the bells  
Ding dong ding go the bells  
Ding dong ding go the bells  
Ding dong ding go the bells
