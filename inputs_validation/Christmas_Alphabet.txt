C is for the candy trimmed around the christmas tree  
H is for the happiness with all the family  
R is for the reindeer prancing by the window pane  
I is for the icing on the cake as sweet as sugar cane  
S is for the stocking hanging on the chimney wall  
T is for the toys beneath the tree so tall  
M is for the misletoe where everyone is kissed  
A is for the angels who make up the christmas list  
S is for the santa who makes every kid his pet  
  
Be good and hell bring you everything in your christmas alphabet
