As we worship You let all the world come and see  
How the mercy we received from You can set them free  
As we worship You let all this joy that fills our hearts  
Bring a hunger and a hope to those who strayed so far  
  
Chorus  
As we bow in adoration and stand in reverent awe  
Show Your majesty and glory let Your anointing fall  
As we declare Your name Lord Jesus as the only name who saves  
May the power of Your salvation fill each heart we pray  
  
As we worship You let all the nations hear our song  
Song of Jesus and His blood that proved His love for all  
As we worship You may all the lost and broken come  
May they hear Your still small voice call out their names each one  
  
Chorus  
  
As we worship You let all the world come and see  
How the mercy we received from You can set them free  
As we worship You let all this joy that fills our hearts  
Bring a hunger and a hope to those who strayed so far  
  
Chorus  
As we worship You as we worship You  
As we worship You as we worship You  
As we worship You
