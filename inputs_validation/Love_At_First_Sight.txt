See the lovers all gone crazy  
Looking for romance it seems  
Many sleepless nights will follow  
Some may lose but some succeed  
  
Love at first sight  
What they want is  
Love at first sight  
  
Make a play of lust intention  
Only just one thing in mind  
Make a slip could be forever  
Wedding bells the shotgun kind  
  
Love at first sight  
What they want is  
Love at first sight  
  
Mouse takes the bait  
So soon as he leaves his seat  
Theres no escape very soon their eyes will meet  
  
Love at first sight etc  
  
Take your partner to surrender  
Then your misdemeanors done  
Sacrifice of maidenhood  
But little boys must have their fun  
  
Love at first sight
