Oh little birdy oh little birdy  
  
I saw the little birdy sing  
He sang with glee and everything  
He sang for spring and sang for me  
And everything was so happy  
  
I dont know why I want to fly  
Try to sigh try to fly made a tie  
And then it tried to get me down  
I want to buy make me fly  
Get me high so I can try  
And then I try  
The little birdy start to cry so happy  
Little birdy was so happy  
Little birdy was so happy  
  
Can I touch your birdy wing  
And fly and hop and everything  
Can the sun reach down on us  
And through the heavens only we would sing  
  
I want the birdy make me laugh  
See the birdy make me laugh  
Take a little birdy bath  
I dont know why he got me high  
I dont know why I dont know why  
It cannot die it sang too high  
And all the birds on the wing sang so together  
Oh little birdy oh little birdy  
  
I saw the little birdy sing  
He sang with glee and everything  
He sang for spring and sang for me  
And everything was so happy  
  
I dont know why I want to fly

And then it tried to get me down  
I want to buy make me fly  
Get me high so I can try  
And then I try  
The little birdy start to cry so happy  
Little birdy was so happy  
Little birdy was so happy  
  
Can I touch your birdy wing  
And fly and hop and everything  
Can the sun reach down on us  
And through the heavens only we would sing

See the birdy make me laugh  
Take a little birdy bath  
I dont know why he got me high  
I dont know why I dont know why  
It cannot die it sang too high  
And all the birds on the wing sang so together  
  
So together so together
