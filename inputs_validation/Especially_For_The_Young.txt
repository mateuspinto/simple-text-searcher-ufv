Lets share the thrills that were made  
Especially for the young  
The dreams that never will fade  
Especially for the young  
Lets find out why a tender sigh  
Is the sweetest song ever sung  
Especially for the young Especially for the young  
Especially for the young Especially for the young  
  
So take my hand  
And walk with me  
The night is young  
And so are we  
  
Lets lose our hearts in a kiss  
Especially for the young  
For nights are made just like this  
Especially for the young  
The moon is there for all to share  
But we will find it was hung  
Especially for the young  
Especially for the young Especially for the young  
  
Especially for the young
