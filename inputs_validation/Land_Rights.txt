Cause it was signal cause it was found  
Cause these were feelings from so long ago  
Listen to the spirits came up strong  
All put together with same layer song  
This is how they did it spears by their side  
Stood on the mountain for their land rights  
All the people noticed movement took fly  
They said  
This is our home just honor our lives  
Ooh this is our home just honor our lives  
Country it was speaking land of God  
Families were broken spirits were crushed  
The language that was silenced set free to be passed  
The cup that was empty slowly filled up  
So we can prove together show our children it is time  
You see this is our home just honor our lives  
Ooh this is our home just honor our lives  
Ooh this is our home just honor our lives
