Mamas got a squeeze box  
She wears on her chest  
And when Daddy comes home  
  
He never gets no rest  
Cause shes playing all night  
And the musics all right  
Mamas got a squeeze box  
Daddy never sleeps at night  
  
Well the kids dont eat  
And the dog cant sleep  
Theres no escape from the music  
In the whole damn street  
Cause shes playing all night  
And the musics all right  
  
Mamas got a squeeze box  
Daddy never sleeps at night  
She goes in and out and in  
And out and in and out and in and out  
Shes playing all night  
  
And the musics all tight  
Mamas got a squeeze box  
Daddy never sleeps at night  
She goes squeeze me come on and squeeze me  
Come on and tease me like you do  
Im so in love with you  
  
Mamas got a squeeze box  
Daddy never sleeps at night  
She goes in and out and in and out  
And in and out and in and out  
Cause shes playing all night  
  
And the musics all right  
Mamas got a squeeze box  
Daddy never sleeps at night
