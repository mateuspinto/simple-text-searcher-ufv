In the wooden chair  
Beside my window  
I wear a face born in the falling rain  
I talk to shadows from a lonely candle  
Recite the phrases from the wall  
I cant explain this Holy pain  
  
Six days ago my life had taken a tumble  
The orders came from high above they say  
A need to use me once again theyve got my number  
Further the cause boy yes you know the game  
  
Ill wait here for days longer  
Till the sister comes to wash my sins away  
She is the lady that can ease my sorrow  
She brings the only friend  
That helps me find my way  
  
I search the past back to a time  
When I was younger  
A target for the new society  
Picked to displace the leaders  
Countering objectives  
Of this new underground reality  
  
Waiting for days longer  
til sister comes to wash my sins away  
She is the lady that can ease my sorrow  
My love for her  
Will help me find my way  
  
My mission saved the world  
And I stood proud  
My mission changed the world  
It turned my life around  
  
I look around my room is filled with candles  
Each one a story but they end the same  
Ill hide away in here the law will never find me  
The walls will tell the story of my pain  
  
Waiting for days longer  
Till sister comes to wash my sins away  
She is the lady who can ease my sorrow  
She sets the pace for my delivery of pain  
  
Theyll say my mission saved the world  
And I stood proud  
My mission changed the world  
The underground will rise and  
Save this world well all stand proud  
Our mission changed the world well change the world  
Well all stand proud
