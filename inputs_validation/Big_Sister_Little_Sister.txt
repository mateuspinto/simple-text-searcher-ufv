Give up to the baby thats what theyd always say  
And big sister would let her path away  
We shared a sandbox little sister and me I was her big sister and she was only
three  
Give up to the baby thats what theyd always say  
And big sister would let her path away  
All through our childhood and our high school days  
My little sister always had to have her way  
Now I cant hurt the baby and I cant let him go  
Be brave big sister this time and say no  
Now all that I remember as they drove out of sight  
Just married and her holdin the ones I love so tight  
Now all I do is rock my darling I just cant let her cry  
So rock a bye baby rock a bye  
Give up to the baby and Id lose every time  
Now theyre saying big sister is losin her mind
