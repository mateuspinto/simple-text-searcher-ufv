I see shes crying  
And I hear her calling  
But I disregard her  
Just keep on walking  
My heart is burning  
She need to work it out  
Before she leaves her innocence behind  
I want to be there by your side  
I want to see the morning sun rise  
Dont want to be left alone in the dark  
Like a blind man  
I cant find my way  
Strike a light up in your window  
So that I can see right up to your door  
Long live the night we spent together  
Long live the night forevermore  
Out in the streets  
In the cold light of day  
Ive been reflecting on what she might say  
I felt a shiver  
The devil passed me by  
He said nothing  
My luck was running high
