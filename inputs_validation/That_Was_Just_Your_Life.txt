Like a siren in my head that I was placed to repeat  
Like a blind man that was shoved into the speeding drivers seat  
Like a face that learned to speak when all it knew was how to fight  
Like a misery that keeps me from just going out astray  
Like an illness that Im about to waken from its state  
  
Contradiction  
A premonition  
Now are the aids who I deny  
I deny  
  
I blind my eyes and try to force it all into place  
I stitch them up see not my fall from grace  
I blind my eyes I hardly feel it passing me by  
I open just in time to say goodbye  
  
Almost like your life  
Almost like your endless fight  
Cursed the day is long  
Realize you dont belong  
Disconnect somehow  
Never stop complaining now  
Almost like your fight  
And there it went  
Almost like your life  
  
Like a bullet keeps on bleeding to remind me not to think  
Like a raging river drowning when I only need a drink  
Like a poison that I swallow but I want the world to die  
  
Like a release from a prison that I didnt know I was in  
Like a fight to live the present I pictured it like this  
Like a general without a mission until the wars start again  
Start again  
  
I blind my eyes and try and force it all into place  
I stitch them up see not my fall from grace  
I blind my eyes I hardly feel it passing me by  
I open just in time to say goodbye  
  
Almost like your life  
Almost like your endless fight  
Cursed the day is long  
Realize you dont belong  
Disconnect somehow  
Never stop complaining now  
Almost like your fight  
And there it went  
Almost like your life  
  
Like a touch from hell  
I feel how hot that it can get if you get caught  
Like a strike from heaven that turns that key  
That brings you straight down to your knees  
Like a touch from hell  
I feel how hot that it can get if I get caught  
Like a strike from heaven to reprieve  
That brings you straight down to your knees  
  
Almost like your life  
Almost like your endless fight  
Cursed the day is long  
Realize you dont belong  
Disconnect somehow  
Never stop complaining now  
Almost like your fight  
And there it went  
Almost like your life  
That was just your life
