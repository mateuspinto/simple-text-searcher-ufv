Down the drain pipe cross the yard and through the fence  
I risked a whoopin every time I went  
Cause white boys werent allowed  
On the colored side of town  
But I was proud to call  
That old black man my friend  
He had a pillow by the bed he used to pray on  
And a beat up old guitar he let me play on  
I knew where my fingers went  
From his greasy fingerprints  
Yeah he was passin on  
What was handed down to him  
  
Chorus  
And it soaked up all the blood and sweat and teardrops  
And the beers he missed in smokey little bars  
And sometimes that old man he comes alive in my hands  
I feel the beating of his sad old broken heart  
Just like theres a ghost in this guitar  
A ghost in this guitar  
  
Well the night before he died he made me take it  
He said You play it now cause I gotta go  
And I can feel him in my fingers when I play it  
Cause sometimes Im in control  
And sometimes I just sit back  
And let him go  
Sit back and let him go  
  
Chorus  
  
Take a listen to the ghost in this guitar
