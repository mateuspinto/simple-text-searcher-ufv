Last night I heard my own heart beating  
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs  
Six months gone and Im still reaching  
Even though I know youre not there  
I was playing back a thousand memories baby  
Thinking bout everything weve been through  
Maybe Ive been going back too much lately  
When time stood still and I had you  
  
Come back come back come back to me like  
You would you would if this was a movie  
Stand in the rain outside til I came out  
Come back come back come back to me like  
You could you could if you just said youre sorry  
I know that we could work it out somehow  
But if this was a movie youd be here by now  
  
I know people change and these things happen  
But I remember how it was back then  
Locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing  
Cause nothing like this ever happened to them  
Now Im pacing up the hall chasing down your street  
Flashback to a night when you said to me  
Nothings gonna change not for me and you  
Not before I knew how much I had to lose  
  
Come back come back come back to me like  
You would you would if this was a movie  
Stand in the rain outside til I came out  
Come back come back come back to me like  
You could you could if you just said youre sorry  
I know that we could work it out somehow  
But if this was a movie youd be here by now  
  
If youre out there  
If youre somewhere  
If youre moving on  
Ill be waiting for you  
Wary since youve been gone  
I just want it back the way it was before  
And I just want to see you back at my front door  
And I say  
  
Come back come back come back to me like  
You would before you say its not that easy  
Before the fight before I locked you out  
But I take it all back now  
Come back come back come back to me like  
You would you would if this was a movie  
Stand in the rain outside til I came out  
Come back come back come back to me like  
You could you could if you just said youre sorry  
I know that we could work it out somehow  
But if this was a movie youd be here by now  
  
Youd be here by now  
Its not the kind of ending you wanna see now  
Baby I dont like the ending  
Oh I thought youd be here now whoa  
Thought youd be here by now
