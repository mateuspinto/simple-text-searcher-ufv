On the side of a hill in a land called Somewhere  
A little boy lies asleep in the earth  
While down in the valley a cruel war rages  
And people forget what a childs life is worth  
  
On the side of a hill a little cloud weeps  
And waters the grave with its silent tears  
While a soldier cleans and polishes a gun  
That ended a life at the age of seven years  
  
And the war rages on in the land called Somewhere  
And generals order their men to kill  
And to fight for a cause theyve long ago forgotten  
While the little cloud weeps on the side of a hill
