Trailing off the likes of it  
She likes it when it grows  
Sending out a candidate  
Shes sinking her foes  
Peaking out then leveling  
Wherever it goes  
  
And her mother will greet you  
And a river will reach you  
Breaking out to make you slave again  
  
Chasing Heather crazy  
Chasing Heather crazy  
Making sure that all the world is coming down  
All the world is coming down on her  
Anywhere I want to  
And if you want to come too  
Well go down where  
All the girls are stumblin round  
All the world is crumbling down around her  
  
Staring out from otherworldly windows painted red  
Doesnt have to listen to the voices in your head  
Thats a different lie  
Do you remember what was said
