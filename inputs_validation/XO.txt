I comb the crowd and pick you out  
My mouth moves too fast for you to figure it out  
It starts eyes closed to fingers crossed  
To I swear I say to I swear I say  
  
To hands between legs to whatever it takes  
To drinks at the club to the bar  
To the keys to your car  
To hotel stares to the emergency exit door  
  
To the love I left my conscience  
Pressed between the pages of a  
Bible in the drawer  
What did it ever do for me I say  
  
It never calls me when Im down  
Love never wanted me but I took it anyway  
Put your ear to the speaker and choose love or sympathy  
But never both love never wanted me  
  
I hoped you choked and crashed your car  
Hey tear catcher thats all that you are  
And ever were from the start  
I swear I say  
  
To hands between legs to whatever it takes  
To drinks at the club to the bar  
To the keys to your car  
To hotel stares to the emergency exit door  
  
To the love I left my conscience  
Pressed between the pages of the  
Bible in the drawer  
What did it ever do for me I say  
  
It never calls me when Im down  
Love never wanted me but I took it anyway  
Put your ear to the speaker and choose love or sympathy  
But never bothlove  
  
To the love I left my conscience pressed  
Through the keyhole I watched you dress  
Kiss and tell  
Loose lips sink ships  
  
To my love I left my conscience pressed  
Through the keyhole I watched you dress  
Kiss and tell  
Loose lips sink ships  
  
To the love I left my conscience pressed  
Through the keyholes I watched you dress  
Kiss and tell Kiss and tell  
Loose lips sink ships  
  
To the love I left my conscience pressed  
To the love I left my conscience pressed  
To the love I left my conscience pressed  
Pressed between the pages of the  
Bible in the drawer  
What did it ever do for me I say
