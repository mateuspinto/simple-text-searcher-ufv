I had a dream last night  
One that will stay with me for a long time  
One that will stay with me  
For as long as I live  
We were living in a world there was no pain  
We were living in the world there were no hungry people  
Everyone was at peace with one another  
  
There was a man in my dream  
He told me hes from the future  
Coming to give something better Repeat x3  
Even though I that  
  
Chorus  
One monster dies another one comes alive  
  
I had a dream last night  
It was my dream but I know it is a dream  
Of a lot of people in the world  
To be living in a world with no homeless people  
To be living in a world where little children  
Dont have to die because their parents are poor  
When we came to this world  
We were prepared to fight a battle  
But we found a war  
When we came to this world  
We were prepared to fight demons  
But we found the devil himself  
  
There was a man in my dream  
He told me hes here  
To gimme something better  
Even though I know that  
  
Chorus
