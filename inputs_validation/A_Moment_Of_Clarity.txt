I would describe it as a invisible darkness  
Casting a shadow a blinding black  
Guarded by hope my soul is kept safe from  
The bloody claws  
  
Look beyond what vision lets me see  
Time after time unneeded misery  
Holding tight to my dreams  
I own no price for you  
I grip them tight and hope for sight  
  
Open my eyes wide to see a moment of clarity  
Confusion gone its in your hands  
Your turn to ask why  
  
Life is like a mystery  
With many clues but with few anwers  
To tell us what it is that we can do to look  
For messages that keep us from the truth
