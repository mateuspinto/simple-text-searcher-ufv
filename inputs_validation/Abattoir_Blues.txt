The sun is high up in the sky and Im in my car  
Drifting down into the abattoir  
Do you see what I see dear  
  
The air grows heavy I listen to your breath  
Entwined together in this culture of death  
Do you see what I see dear  
  
Slide on over here let me give you a squeeze  
To avert this unholy evolutionary trajectory  
Can you hear what I hear babe  
Does it make you feel afraid  
  
Everythings dissolving babe according to plan  
The sky is on fire the dead are heaped across the land  
I went to bed last night and my  
Moral code got jammed  
I woke up this morning with a Frappucino in my hand  
  
I kissed you once I kissed you again  
My heart it tumbled like the stock exchange  
Do you feel what I feel dear  
  
Mass extinction darling hypocrisy  
These things are not good for me  
Do you see what I see dear  
  
The line the God throws down to you and me  
Makes a pleasing geometry  
Shall we leave this place now dear  
Is there someway out of here  
  
I wake with the sparrows and I hurry off to work  
The need for validation babe gone completely  
Berserk  
I wanted to be your Superman but I turned out such a  
Jerk  
I got the abattoir blues  
I got the abattoir blues  
I got the abattoir blues  
Right down to my shoes
