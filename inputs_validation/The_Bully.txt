How you been feeling  
Its not about marbles snakes or glue  
How you been healing  
Now that we cannot win or lose  
So how you been keeping  
It doesnt matter whose dads richest now  
How you been sleeping  
From the top bunks further to fall down  
  
You turned that around on me  
You turned that around on me  
You turned that around on me  
You turned that around on me  
  
What you been doing  
Still make the world a better place  
Never stopped ruing  
Making those tears fall down your face  
Making you suffer  
Wondering how you got your scars  
And only in hindsight  
I wish I had taken you in my arms  
  
Taken you in my arms  
Taken you in my arms  
Taken you in my arms  
Taken you in my arms  
  
You turned that around on me  
You turned that around on me  
You turned that around on me  
You turned that around on me  
  
You turned that around on me forgiving the bully  
You turned that around on me  
You turned that around on me forgiving the bully
