New York City is a thousand miles away  
And if you ask me Ill tell you thats OK  
Now Im not trying to put the big apple down  
Cause they dont need a man like me in town  
I pick cotton down on the Dixie line  
Work hard all day tryin to make a dime  
But thats alright thats OK by me  
Cause thats the way that it was meant to be  
  
Big city hard times dont bother me  
Im a country boy Im as happy as I can be  
  
I dont like smoke chokin up my air  
And some of those city folks well they dont care  
I dont like cars buzzing around  
I dont even want a piece of concrete in my town  
I like sunshine fresh clean air  
Makes me feel like you wouldnt care but  
Thats all right each to his own  
But one smell from the city  
And this country boy is gone  
Big city hard times dont bother me  
Im a country boy Im as happy as I can be  
  
Well I dont want to even read about it  
  
Let me tell you something let me tell you true  
Whats right for me might not be right for you  
Well you live your way Ill live mine  
And I hope that your happy all the time  
I pick cotton down on the Dixie line  
Work hard all day tryin to make a dime  
But thats all right thats OK by me  
Cause thats the way that it was supposed to be  
  
Big city hard times never bother me  
Im a country boy Im as happy as I can be  
  
Let me tell yaI said  
Big city hard times never bother me  
Im a country boy Im as happy as I can be  
Ooh thats my way baby  
I dont want you to even tell me about the big city  
I dont want to read about it
