Child its broke  
And I feel you  
Slipping away  
Child you spoke  
And the world  
Fell silent again  
Do you love  
Do you need love  
Child undone  
By fear of falling  
Through cracks  
Child by one mistake  
Youve lost your way back  
Somethings gotta  
Turn you round  
  
Do you love  
Do you need love  
When your angels shout  
Is your heart strung out  
  
Do you love  
Do you need love  
When your angels fall  
Have you lost it all  
  
Child be still  
In the storm  
To wave us goodbye  
Child we will  
Return to dance  
With the sky  
  
Do you love  
Do you need love  
When your angels shout  
Is your heart strung out  
  
Do you love  
Do you need love  
When your angels fall  
Have you lost it all  
  
Do you love  
Do you need love  
When your angels cry  
Does your spirit die
