feat Nelly Furtado  
  
Tell me when will you be mine  
Tell me quando quando quando  
We can share a love divine  
Please dont make me wait again  
  
When will you say yes to me  
Tell me quando quando quando  
You mean happiness to me  
Oh my love please tell me when  
  
Every moments a day  
Every day seems a lifetime  
Let me show you the way  
To a joy beyond compare  
  
I cant wait a moment more  
Tell me quando quando quando  
Say its me that you adore  
And then darling tell me when  
  
Every moments a day  
Every day seems a lifetime  
Let me show you the way  
To a joy beyond compare  
  
I cant wait a moment more  
Tell me quando quando quando  
Say its me that you adore  
And then darling tell me when  
  
Whoa lover tell me when  
Oh darling tell me when  
Oh come on tell me when  
Yea tell me when
