Though the night be dark as dungeon not a star to be seen above  
I will be guided without a stumble into the arms of me only love  
I went up to her bedroom window kneeling gently upon a stone  
I rapped on her bedroom window My darling dear do you lie alone  
  
Chorus  
  
Im a rover  seldom sober  
Im a rover of high degree  
Ans when Im drinking Im always thinking  
How to gain my loves company  
  
She raised her head up from her feather pillow raised her arms up around her
breast  
Saying Whos at me bedroom window disturbing me at me long nights rest  
Its only me your own true lover open the door and please let me in  
For I have come on a long nights journey I am near drenched to the skin  
  
Chorus  
  
She opened the door with the greatest pleasure opened the door and she let me
in  
We both shook hands and embraced each other Til the morning we lay as one  
Well now me love I must go and leave you though the mountains be high above  
Well I will climb them with greater pleasure that I have been with me only
love
