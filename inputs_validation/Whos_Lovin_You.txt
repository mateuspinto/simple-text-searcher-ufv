  
When I had you  
I treated you bad  
And wrong my dear  
And girl since  
Since you been away  
Dontcha know  
I sit around  
with my head hangin down  
And I wonder  
Whos lovin you  
  
I I I I should have never ever  
Ever made you cry  
And girl since  
Since you been gone  
Dontcha know  
I sit around  
with my head hangin down  
And I wonder  
Whos lovin you  
  
Life without love  
Is oh so lonely  
I dont think  
I dont think  
Im gonna make it  
All my life  
All my life yeah  
belongs to you only  
Come on and take it girl  
Come on and take it  
  
Because  
All I can do  
All I can do  
Since you been gone is cry  
And you oooh  
  
Dontcha know I  
Sit around  
With my head hangin down  
And I wonder  
Whos lovin you  
Whos lovin you  
Whos lovin you
