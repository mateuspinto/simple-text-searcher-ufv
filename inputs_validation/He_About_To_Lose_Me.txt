Im touching hands with someone seriously beautiful  
I feel it burning and I know Im standing far too close  
Im telling lies and if it shows I see that he dont care  
I know he wants to take me home and get on out of here  
  
I got someone waiting at home  
He says he in love but lately I just dont know  
He dont see me or make me feel hot  
Banging in the club with all of my ladies and he dont know that  
  
He about to lose about to lose about to lose me  
He about to lose me  
He about to lose about to lose about to lose me  
He about to lose me  
  
I feel my body is in focus as he touches me  
And I should go but I cant overcome this chemistry  
He pulls me close before he whispers something in my ear  
He says he wants to take me home and get me out of here  
  
I got someone waiting at home  
He says he in love but lately I just dont know  
He dont see me or make me feel hot  
Banging in the club with all of my ladies and he dont know that  
  
He about to lose about to lose about to lose me  
He about to lose me  
He about to lose about to lose about to lose me  
He about to lose me  
  
Someone by the bar keeps looking at us dancing  
I see him staring at me I see what he wants to be  
Someone by the bar keeps looking at us dancing  
I gotta I gotta go  
He dont know that  
  
He about to lose about to lose about to lose me  
He about to lose me  
He about to lose about to lose about to lose me  
He about to lose me  
He about to lose about to lose about to lose me  
He about to lose me  
He about to lose about to lose about to lose me  
He about to lose me  
  
Im touching hands with someone seriously beautiful
