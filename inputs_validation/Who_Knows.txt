Mi was a ganja smoker  
Livin la vida loca  
Mi couldnt be no broker  
Mi nearly touch di coka  
But di powers of Jehovah  
A dat me mek tek over  
Daddy use to call me joker  
Now him call me Nova Scotia  
Fight until di fight is over  
Mek wicked run for cover  
Dem watch mi like bulova  
Dem want we squeeze trigga  
Fi police kick we like Ruud Gullit  
Den lock up we fi pull it  
Wha appen to di man  
Weh mek di bullet and di gun fi full it  
Dem wah me crash di jeep and  
Know mi work fi buy di vehicle  
Good mi a wish fi people  
While dem a wish mi evil  
Dem want mi come to nuttin and  
Mi nuh do dem nuttin  
Choo dem cant press mi button  
Dem wish me Ali buttn  
Somethin muss do dem and if not  
Mi still give it to dem  
Fight people pickney cuh dem and  
Fi dem forbidden  
Mi see dem and gwaan like  
Mi no si dem and give dem  
Something fi talk while  
Mi juck it inna dem heart  
  
Who knows what tomorrow brings  
In a world where everyones lying  
Where you go no matter how far  
Ill find to let you know you are not alone  
  
Who love you more  
Outta you baby madda or you real mother  
You brethren or your bradda  
You fren dem or you Fadda  
You Deacon or your daughta  
Blood thicker dan water  
So dont get mix up like mortar  
Dont mek dem ever trap you  
Inna dem web like Peter Parker  
Leave dem and return like Luke Skywalker  
Di Jedi dem red eye  
So dem want fi si you falter  
Stand up like Gibraltar  
Wid nine calibre PPK Walter  
Dem fear weh dem nuh understand and  
Hate weh dem cant conquer  
Dem want sink you like anchor  
Choo you become di banker  
Dem want a match  
Tell dem go watch West Indies and Sri Lanka  
Dem want a war tell dem go on  
Take on some Russian Tanker  
Waterford no pet or pamper  
From baby to di Grandpa  
Wi nuh cowboy like Dallas  
But wi brave like Atlanta  
Gangsta if you nuh have no sense  
You nah mek no dollar and if you cant be a leader  
Careful who you follow  
  
Who knows what tomorrow brings  
In a world where everyones lying  
Where you go no matter how far  
Ill find to let you know you are not alone
