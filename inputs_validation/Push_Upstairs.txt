Tina lives in Berlin  
Her voice so seldom  
On my machine  
Is here tonight  
And Im on the market  
And when Im on a market  
Words move faster  
Wire and clouds move  
Thin between us  
Like a skin  
Like a salty skin  
For a seed  
A fat circles  
A smiling smiling  
Her voice so intentionally  
Smiling  
And a cloud between us  
And these are my intentions  
Pushing Repeat x7  
Push  
Ah Repeat x10  
 the blonde  
Is carrying something  
Is carrying me  
And someone I used to be  
Great plastic someone  
Blue plastic girl  
Your dream is  
Pushing Repeat x5  
Pushed away your body is  
Pushing Repeat x3  
Pushed away your  
Come me for the unbelieve  
Carry on song  
Lipstick fodder  
The boyfriend blond  
Between the holes of sheets  
Is professionally poised  
Faces watching her  
Shes watching the faces  
Watching her

Pushing Repeat x3  
Love Repeat x9
