Oh my son I am sorry about what happened  
Many years ago  
Me and your mother had trouble all the time  
We could not stay together any more  
The last solution was getting divorced  
I know what that means to your life  
I can hear you crying  
From a million miles away  
Calling Daddy but there s no answer  
But deep down in me I know the reason why  
cause the blood that runs in you  
Is the same as the blood in me  
I mean the blood the blood that runs in you  
Is the same as the blood in me  
Oh my son I m sorry  
Oh my son I m sorry  
Oh my son I m sorry  
I can hear you crying  
From a million miles away  
Calling Daddy but there s no answer  
But deep down in me I know the reason why  
cause the blood that runs in you  
Is the same as the blood in me  
I mean the blood the blood that runs in you  
Is the same as the blood in me  
cause the blood that runs in you  
Is the same as the blood in me  
I say the blood the blood that runs in you  
fade
