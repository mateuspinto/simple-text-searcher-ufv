I walked in my greatcoat  
Down through the days of the leaves  
No before after yes after before  
We were shining our light into  
The days of blooming wonder  
In the eternal presence  
In the presence of the flame  
  
Didnt I come to bring you a sense of wonder  
Didnt I come to lift your fiery vision bright  
Didnt I come to bring you a sense of wonder in the flame  
  
On and on and on and on we kept singing our song  
Over newtonards and comber  
Gransha and the Ballystockart Road  
This spike an boffyflow  
I said I could describe the leaves  
For Samuel and Felicity  
Rich red browny half burnt orange and green  
  
Didnt I come to bring you a sense of wonder  
Didnt I come to lift your fiery vision bright  
Didnt I come to bring you a sense of wonder in the flame  
  
Its easy to describe the leaves in the autumn  
And its oh so easy in the spring  
But down through January and February  
Its a very different thing  
  
On and on and on through the winter of our discontent  
When the wind blows up the collar and the ears are frostbitten too  
I said I could describe the leaves for Samuel and what it means to you and me  
You may call my love Sophia but I call my love philosophy  
  
Didnt I come to bring you a sense of wonder  
Didnt I come to lift your fiery vision  
Didnt I come to bring you a sense of wonder in the flame  
  
Didnt I come to bring you a sense of wonder  
Didnt I come to lift your fiery vision  
Didnt I come to bring you a sense of wonder in the flame  
  
Wee Alfie at the castle picture house on the Castlereagh Road  
Whistling on the corner next door where  
He kept Johnny McBrides horse  
O solo mio by Mcgimsey  
And the man who played the saw  
Outside the city hall  
Pastie suppers down at Daveys chipper  
Gravy rings wagon wheels barmbracks snowballs  
  
A sense of wonder  
A sense of wonder  
A sense of wonder
