che  
And the money kept rolling in from every side  
Evas pretty hands reached out and they reached wide  
Now you may feel it should have been a voluntary cause  
But thats not the point my friends  
When the money keeps rolling in you dont ask how  
Think of all the people guaranteed a good time now  
Evas called the hungry to her open up the doors  
Never been a fund like the foundation eva peron  
  
Chorus  
  
workers  
Rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin  
Rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin  
Rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin  
Rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin rollin  
  
Rollin on in rollin on in  
Rollin on in rollin on in  
On in  
  
che  
Would you like to try a college education  
Own your landlords house take the family on vacation  
Eva and her blessed fund can make your dreams come true  
Heres all you have to do my friends  
Write your name and your dream on a card or a pad or a ticket  
Throw it high in the air and should our lady pick it  
She will change your way of life for a week or even two  
Name me anyone who cares as much as eva peron  
  
Chorus  
  
Rollin on out rollin on out  
Rollin on out rollin on out  
On out  
  
che  
And the money kept rolling out in all directions  
To the poor to the weak to the destitute of all complexions  
Now cynics claim a little of the cash has gone astray  
But thats not the point my friends  
When the money keeps rolling out you dont keep books  
You can tell youve done well by the happy grateful looks  
Accountants only slow things down figures get in the way  
Never been a lady loved as much as eva peron  
  
Chorus  
  
Rollin on out rollin on out  
Rollin on out rollin on out  
On out  
  
che  
Eva  
When the money keeps rolling out you dont keep books  
You can tell youve done well by the happy grateful looks  
Accountants only slow things down figures get in the way  
Never been a lady loved as much as eva peron  
  
Chorus  
  
Rollin on out rollin on out  
Rollin on out rollin on out  
Rollin on out rollin on out  
On out
