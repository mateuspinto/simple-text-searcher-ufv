Knock on any door  
Look through any window  
Baby knock on any door  
Knock on any door  
Is there any place you want to go  
Baby who you lookin for  
  
Yeah yeah baby now you know  
Its a cold world like they told you so  
  
Knock on any door  
Save your tears for some occasion  
Keep your heartache to yourself  
Knock on any door  
Its a simple operation  
Just trade your memory for your health  
  
Knock on any door  
Look through any window  
Walk on  
Knock on any door  
Look through any window  
Walk on  
  
Its insane girl you cant run away  
Its the same world it was yesterday  
  
Knock on any door  
Look through any window  
Walk on  
Knock on any door  
Look through any window  
Walk on  
  
Now now now how do you survive  
With a pain so real in a world so jive  
  
Knock on any door  
Look through any window  
Peek through any shade  
Knock on any door  
Look through any window  
Walk on
