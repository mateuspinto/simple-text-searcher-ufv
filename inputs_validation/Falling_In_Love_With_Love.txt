I weave with brightly colored strings  
To keep my mind off other things  
So ladies let your fingers dance  
And keep your hands out of romance  
  
Lovely witches  
Let the stitches  
Keep your fingers under control  
Cut the thread but leave  
The whole heart whole  
  
Merry maids can sew and sleep  
Wives can only sew and weep  
Falling in love with love  
Is falling for makebelieve  
Falling in love with love  
Is playing the fool  
  
Caring too much is juvenile fancy  
Learning to trust is just  
For children in school  
I fell in love with love one night  
When the mood was full  
I was unwise with eyes  
Unable to see  
  
I fell in love with love  
With love everlasting  
But love fell out with me
