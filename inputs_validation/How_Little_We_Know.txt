Maybe it happens this way  
Maybe we really belong together  
But after all how little we know  
  
Maybe its just for a day  
Love is as changeable as the weather  
And after all how little we know  
  
Who knows why an April breeze never remains  
Why stars in the trees hide when it rains  
Love comes along casting a spell  
Will it sing you a song  
Will it say a farewell  
Who can tell  
  
Maybe youre meant to be mine  
Maybe Im only supposed to stay in your arms a while  
As others have done  
  
Is this what Ive waited for am I the one  
Oh I hope in my heart that its so  
In spite of how little we know  
  
Is this what Ive waited for am I the one  
Oh I hope in my heart that its so  
In spite of how little we know
