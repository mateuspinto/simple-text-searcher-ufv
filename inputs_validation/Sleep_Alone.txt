Say so long baby  
Turn around  
Loneliness hits you  
Emptiness closes you down  
Alone in his car  
  
You think of his name  
Took part of you with him  
It wont be the same  
You love to relive  
The love that he gives  
  
You love to recall  
The rush of it all  
He woos you so sweet  
Then kicks on the heat  
Youre willing youre hot  
Give him all that you got  
Lonely woman gets so cold  
With no loverboy to hold  
  
One more night shes on her own  
Nobody meant to sleep alone  
Youre waiting too hard counting the days  
Till he comes home to lift you out of this haze  
You dream all day climb the walls all night  
No satisfaction till he makes it right  
  
So hard to kick  
The memory addicting you  
So hard to lick  
The romance afflicting you  
  
You love to relive the love that he gives  
You love to recall the rush of it all  
Lonely woman gets so cold  
With no lover boy to hold  
One more night shes on her own  
Nobody meant to sleep alone
