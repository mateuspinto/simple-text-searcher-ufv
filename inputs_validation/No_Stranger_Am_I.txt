No stranger am I  
You enter my world  
I hear flowers sing  
No emptiness now  
You enter my world  
Hear flowers with me  
Sing joyous  
  
I feel you er I sing  
No unending time alone  
  
No stranger am I  
You open my eyes  
I feel laughter ring  
No longer alone  
You open my heart  
Feel laughter with me  
Ring joyous  
  
Indifference gone away  
No unending time alone  
  
Indifference gone away  
No undening time alone
