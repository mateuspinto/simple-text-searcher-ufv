Catfish girl makes it feel so fine  
Catfish girl always pulling on my line  
When I see her smiling face She get me every single time  
Yeah she does  
Catfish girl I miss you Lord I feel so blue  
Oh my Catfish girl Oh and every little thing that you do  
Oh Catfish girl I only want to be with you  
Oh Catfish come on now  
Aint that the prettiest thing you ever did see
