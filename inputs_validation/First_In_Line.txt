When they gave out eyes like diamonds  
That would shame the stars that shine  
My darlin my darlin  
You were the first in line  
When they gave out lips like honey  
That hold a new thrill every time  
My darlin my darlin  
You were the first in line  
  
There may be others  
That know you longer  
Who pledge their hearts to you  
But theres no other  
Could love you stronger  
Any stronger than I do  
Dont refuse me say youll choose me  
I am yours  
Oh please be mine  
My darlin say Im your darlin  
The first and the last in line  
  
There may be others  
That know you longer  
Who pledge their hearts to you  
But theres no other  
Could love you stronger  
Any stronger than I do  
Dont refuse me say youll choose me  
I am yours  
Oh please be mine  
My darlin say Im your darlin  
The first and the last in line
