If I had to choose just one day  
To last my whole life through  
It would surely be that Sunday  
The day that I met you  
  
Newborn whippoorwills were calling from the hills  
Summer was acoming in but fast  
Lots of daffodils were showing off their skills  
Nodding all together I could almost hear them whisper  
Go on kiss him go on and kiss him  
  
If I had to choose one moment  
To live within my heart  
It would be that tender moment  
Recalling how we started  
Darling it would be when you smiled at me  
That way that Sunday that summer  
Go on kiss him go on and kiss him  
  
And if I had to choose just one moment  
To live within my heart  
It would surely be that moment  
Recalling how we started  
Darling it would be when you smiled at me  
That way that Sunday that summer  
  
If I had to choose just one day
