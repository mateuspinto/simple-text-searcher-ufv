Silent dance with death  
Everything is lost  
Torn by the arrival of Autumn  
The blink of an eye you know its me  
You keep the dagger close at hand  
And you saw nothing  
False love turned to pure hate  
The wind cried a lamentation  
before merging with the grey  
Demon of the fall  
Gasping for another breath  
She rose screaming at closed doors  
  
Seductive faint mist forging  
through the cracks in the wall  
I shant resist  
In tears for all of eternity  
She turned around and faced me for the first time  
Run away run away  
Just one second and I was left with nothing  
Her fragrance still pulsating through damp air  
That day came to an end  
And she had lost in me her credence
