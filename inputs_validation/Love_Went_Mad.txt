Ive looked at it every way I can  
From under and above  
And every chance ive had  
My love went mad  
Love went mad love went mad  
You you feel like I feel  
Do you have a heart  
Do you have a heart of iron and steel  
  
Are you a man now you wear a mans hat  
Are you a man now or are you a rat  
You go to church quiet as a mouse  
Youre a big cheese now in the workhouse  
With these vulgar fractions of the treble clef  
I wish you luck with a capital f  
A selfmade mug is hard to break  
A silent partner in someone elses mistake  
  
Every day goes by without a hitch  
You feel the urge becoming an itch  
The boys in blue are hard to catch  
Theyre busy turning piccadilly  
Into brands hatch  
But with your fingers in your ears  
Feeling bright as a button  
Thinking thank god therell be no more  
Lamb dressed as mutton  
Playing family favorites on a tissue and a comb  
Dying a thousand deaths  
In the safety of your own home
