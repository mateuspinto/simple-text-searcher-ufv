The barricade is now complete  
  
Students  
Now we pledge ourselves to hold this barricade  
Let them come in their legions  
And they will be met  
Have faith in yourselves  
And dont be afraid  
Lets give em a screwing  
That theyll never forget  
This is where it begins  
And if I should die in the fight to be free  
Where the fighting is hardest  
There will I be  
Let them come if they dare  
Well be there  
  
Army Officer Offstage  
You at the barricade listen to this  
No one is coming to help you to fight  
Youre on your own  
You have no friends  
Give up your guns  or die  
  
Enjolras  
Damn their warnings damn their lies  
They will see the people rise  
  
Students  
Damn their warnings damn their lies  
They will see the people rise  
  
Javert climbs over the barricade  
  
Javert  
Listen my friends  
I have done as I said  
I have been to their lines  
I have counted each man  
I will tell what I can  
Better be warned  
They have armies to spare  
And the danger is real  
We will need all our cunning  
To bring them to heel  
  
Enjolras  
Have faith  
If you know what their movements are  
Well spoil their game  
There are ways that a people can fight  
We shall overcome their power  
  
Javert  
I have overheard their plans  
There will be no attack tonight  
They intend to starve us out  
Before they start a proper fight  
Concentrate their force  
Hit us from the right
