Is there someone I can believe in  
Is there somewhere I can hide  
Take me out of the straits Im in  
Come and stay here by my side  
Somebody I can rely on  
I broke the law Ive been set free  
Give me something to decide upon  
Come and show yourself to me  
Is there someone sewing seams  
Through all my hopes through all my dreams  
You know living a life of ease  
Dont make your meals taste better if you please  
Is there someone I can relate to  
Who will break the ice for me  
Take me out of the place Im in  
Come and share yer life with me  
Somebody with nothing to live up to  
Who will mend my broken dreams  
Give me a wave I can ride upon  
Come and show yer strength to me  
I have felt the final rush of loves embrace  
The magic touch running headlong to attract  
I felt the breath of Satan on my back  
Is there someone I can believe in  
Is there something I can do  
Take me out of the straits Im in  
Let me show myself to you  
Somebody to whom I can belong  
Take my hand Ive been set free  
Give me some wings I can glide upon  
Come and show yourself to me  
Is there someone sewings seams  
Through all my hopes through all my dreams  
You know living a life of ease  
Dont make yer meals taste better if you please
