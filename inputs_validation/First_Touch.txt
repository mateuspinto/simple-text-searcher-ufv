I dreamed of all  
The wonders in the world  
And lovers that I knew  
I saw so many good things  
At one time  
Mountains of emotion  
Coming right into view  
When I arose from my bed  
I got that warm glow  
At the back of my head  
First touch feel the power  
Hear the thunder over me  
First touch out of nowhere  
See the future over me  
Then I dreamed about  
The tenderness we shared  
And how it makes us feel  
Like every first encounter  
That we have  
When I think I must be dreamin  
You tell me that its real  
And here you are in my bed  
I get that warm glow  
At the back of my head
