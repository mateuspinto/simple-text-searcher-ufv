Love lives in New York City  
He got a place off of the park  
Heard he was standing in the ruins  
And in his hands a broken heart  
He called an army of his angels  
I heard they had to hide their wings  
It was them who brought you water  
If you listen closely I know you can hear  
The choir singing  
  
Chorus  
Hey hallelujah baby  
Rise Up  
Hold out your hands and reach out  
Higher  
Get up on your feet  
Rise Up  
Let it flow though you baby  
Run it through your veins  
Like a healing rain  
Everywhere youll see  
Another reason to believe  
  
I saw him down south of Canal Street  
Right there in a mothers eyes  
At a table in a restaurant window  
In a taxi passing by  
Love went running up the stairwell  
When the sky came falling down  
It was him in a newborn babys cry  
He was there to make that sound  
That keeps this whole world spinning round  
  
Chorus  
Rise Up  
Hold out your hands and reach out  
Higher  
Get up on your feet  
Rise Up  
Let it flow though you baby  
Run it through your veins  
Like a healing rain  
Everywhere youll see  
Another reason to believe  
  
Its different than it was before  
Now we need it even more  
Fires falling from the sky  
Innocence just said goodbye  
It may never be the same  
Maybe it was time to change  
A time to grieve  
A time to cry  
A time to live  
A time to fly
