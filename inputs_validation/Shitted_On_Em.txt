Eyo bring this one back man this one is crazy man  
Lets start that shit again  
Yeah lets go  
Aha wooo yeah  
Going in right now man  
Yeah cha les go  
Far from a rookie man  
Im far from a amatuer  
Rappers hit the booth  
And then they turn into characters  
Word to my record label word to my manager  
Life is like a fucking red number in a calender  
  
Everyday a holiday Im buttoned up my colars straight  
We disturbing london make them niggers do geography  
Same nikeys on but nigger mine a different colour wait  
Now my face up in the source and I aint talking   
  
Uh yeah I just shitted on em  
I like my women nice and thick with no knickers on em  
Every message in my phone have got kisses on em  
All my shows sold out no tickets for em  
All them niggers is my sons I just shitted on em

All I see is numbers niggers sum
