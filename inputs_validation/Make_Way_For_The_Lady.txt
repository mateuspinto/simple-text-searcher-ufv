Some life Ive been livin  
Like a song in the night  
Good sounds every moment  
Good news and bright lights  
Anytime I get lonesome  
I just got to do the things right  
Make way for the lady  
You can do it my son  
Makin hay with no gravy  
Brings the good folk down  
Anytime you get lonely  
You just got to turn it around  
  
This life Ive bin given  
It dont tell you no lies  
Couldve been somewhat wasted  
How could it be otherwise  
When the sound of the laughter  
Brought the tears in to my eyes  
  
Make way for the lady  
You can do it my son  
Makin hay with no gravy  
Gets the days work done  
When a blue mood gets rollin  
You just got to turn it around  
Turn it around  
  
Shake hands with the father  
The son and the holy ghost  
The impossible believers  
And the heavenly host  
If you must do it better  
You just got to do it the most  
  
Make way for the lady  
You can do it my son  
Makin hay with no gravy  
Brings all the good folks down  
When a blue moon starts risin  
You just got to turn it around  
Turn it around  
Turn it around  
  
Make way for the lady  
And turn it around
