Will you remember me baby  
One day you should go away  
I know you say youll always stay  
Oh but life takes funny turns at times  
And has a way of changing minds  
No I could never be your friend  
Be your friend  
To me the end would be the end  
But weve shared so much happiness  
Just remember ohh baby  
Remember  
I know you tell me every day  
Youll love me till the end of time  
I tell it to you just in case  
Someday you are no longer mine  
Just one thing Ill ask of you  
One thing baby  
cause both of us have much to lose  
For all the things weve made it through  
Just remember please remember  
Baby cmon baby cmon baby cmon oh  
Remember me with love baby  
Remember  
Remember me with love  
Dont you forget to remember  
No matter where or when  
Where or when  
If you think of me again  
Remember me with love  
Remember me with love  
Remember me with love baby  
Will you remember me baby Remember will you remember  
Remember me with love  
Will you remember me baby Will you remember  
I know you care for me  
Care for me  
But if one day you set me free  
Remember me with love  
Remember me with love  
Do you remember me baby Do you remember me  
Seems like everywhere I turn  
Somebody else is breakin up  
I know as far as Im concerned with you  
Ill always be in love  
But if one day you feel differently  
All you have to do is come to me  
I will let you go so easily  
But remember please remember  
Baby cmon baby cmon baby cmon oh  
Remember me with love baby  
Remember  
Remember me with love everyday  
Dont you forget to remember

If you think of me again
