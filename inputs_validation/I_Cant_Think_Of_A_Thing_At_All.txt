And if a clock should keep me waiting  
Im gonna think of a way I can speed the clock

And if a wall is between us  
Im gonna think of a way I can climb that wall

Baby to get a little closer to you  
You know what  
I couldnt think of a thing at all

Now if an opinion should become between us  
Im gonna think of a way we can reach an agreement  
An agreement an agreement  
  
And if a brick floor should be between us  
Im gonna think of a way I can dig through the ceiling  
Through the ceiling through the ceiling  
  
If theres a ball of fire between us

Im gonna think of a way I can cross those miles  
Cross the miles cross the miles  
  
And if my actions begin to bore ya  
Im gonna think of a way I can change my style  
Change my style change my style  
  
And if theres burning hall between us  
Im gonna think of a way to get down that hall  
  
I tried to think of something I wouldnt do  
Hey to get a little closer to you  
You know what
