Just a thought  
To add suspense  
To all the games  
Of discontent  
  
Fear is real  
But not selftaught  
You let others  
Be the cause  
  
There we go racing towards the sun  
Ignoring all the noise  
Striving for the grace of man  
People play this great charade  
And always miss the point  
Never fall for prophecies  
  
You say it draws near  
That it will be clear  
You act so convinced  
A fortress youve built  
Remember the doubt  
By which I now stand  
You write the book  
On the way it all ends  
  
Tear down  
Those mighty walls  
Reinvent  
The way you talk  
  
Look ahead  
Now down below  
Or high above  
Where angels flowThere we go racing towards the sun  
Ignoring all the noise  
Striving for the grace of man  
People play this great charade  
And always miss the point  
Never fall for prophecies  
  
Waiting to see  
Our kind disagree  
You draw the line  
And stick to your pride  
Remember the doubt  
By which I now stand  
You write the book  
On the way  
  
It ends  
  
Guitar solos  
  
You say it draws near  
That it will be clear  
You act so convinced  
A fortress youve built  
Remember the doubt  
By which I now stand  
You wrote the book  
On the way it all ends  
  
It ends
