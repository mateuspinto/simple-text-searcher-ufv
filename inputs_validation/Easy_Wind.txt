I been balling a shiny black steel jackhammer  
Been chippin up rocks for the great highway  
Live five years if I take my time  
Ballin that jack and a drinkin my wine  
  
I been chippin them rocks from dawn till doom  
While my rider hide my bottle in the other room  
Doctor say better stop ballin that jack  
If I live five years I gonna bust my back yes I will  
  
Easy wind cross the Bayou today  
Cause theres a whole lotta women mama  
Out in red on the streets today  
And the rivers keep a talkin  
But you never heard a word it said  
  
Gotta find a woman be good to me  
Wont hide my liquor try to serve me tea  
Cause Im a stone jack baller and my heart is true  
And Ill give everything that I got to you yes I will  
  
Easy wind going cross the Bayou today  
Theres a whole lotta women  
Out in red on the streets today  
And the rivers keep a talkin  
But you never heard a word it said
