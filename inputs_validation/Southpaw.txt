You were a boy before you became a man  
I dont see the joy  
And you ran with your pals in the sun  
You turned around and they were gone  
Again  
  
A sick boy should be treated  
So easily defeated  
Oh I just dont understand  
So you ran with your pals in the sun  
You turned around  
You were alone  
Again  
And you ran back to Ma  
Which set the pace for the rest of your days  
Oh you ran back to Ma  
Which set the pace for the rest of your days  
Oh you ran back to Ma  
Which set the pace for the rest of your days  
  
And now there is something that you should know  
There is something that you should know  
The girl of your dreams is  
Here all alone  
Girl of your dreams is  
Here all alone  
The girl of your dreams is  
Sad and all alone  
The girl of your dreams is  
Here all alone  
There is something that you should know  
There is something that you should know  
Girl of your dreams is  
Here all alone  
The girl of your dreams is  
Sad and is all alone  
The girl of your dreams is  
Sad and is feeling all alone  
Oh there is something that you should know  
  
Help me help me help me
