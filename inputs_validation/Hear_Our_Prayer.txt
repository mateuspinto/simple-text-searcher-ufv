Hear our prayer Spirit come  
How I long for Your sweet touch  
On my knees I cry out  
Jesus Savior behold Your child  
Like a deer longing for water  
My soul yearns  
Only You can fill my deep hunger  
My heart burns my heart burns  
Hear our prayer Spirit come  
How I long for Your sweet touch  
On my knees I cry out  
Jesus Savior behold Your child  
Like a deer longing for water  
My soul yearns  
Only You can fill my deep hunger  
My heart burns my heart burns  
Like a deer longing for water  
My soul yearns  
Only You can fill my deep hunger  
My heart burns my heart burns  
Oceans deep mountains high  
Oh my God I cannot live without Your love  
I cannot live without Your love  
Like a deer longing for water  
My soul yearns  
Only you can fill my deep hunger  
My heart burns my heart burns  
Like a deer longing for water  
My soul yearns  
Only you can fill my deep hunger  
My heart burns my heart burns  
My heart burns my heart burns  
My heart burns my soul yearns for You  
My heart burns my heart burns
