I used to be a very carefree man  
A loving man of the world  
Yeah I would still be except for the time  
When I met ya little girl  
Say Ive tried and Ive tried but I just cant  
You sure got a hold on me  
Ah your good good lovin is makin me faint  
Mama please dont set me free  
Because I need ya need ya need ya need ya yeah  
Need ya need ya  
Oh need ya need ya need ya need ya yeah  
Need ya need ya  
You got that kinda air that drives me insane  
And sometime ya sure got me new  
Ah sometimes I feel like knockin you down  
But I would never pull that scene  
Though I get tired I know that you know  
That Id never do you wrong  
Cause when its late and I feel down turn the lights on low  
And I will hold things in my soul  
Cause I need ya need ya need ya need ya yeah  
Need ya need ya  
Im gonna need ya need ya need ya need ya yeah  
Need ya need ya  
Yeah  ooh yeah  
Ah need ya need ya need ya need ya yeah  
Need ya need ya need ya need ya  
You know I need ya need ya need ya need ya yeah  
Need ya need ya need ya need ya  
Yeah oh oh need ya need ya need ya need ya yeah  
Need ya need ya need ya need ya  
Oh yeah need ya need ya need ya need ya yeah  
Oh  Need ya need ya need ya need ya   
Oh  Need ya need ya need ya  need ya
