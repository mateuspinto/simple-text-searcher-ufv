Anyone whos played on a record date  
will remember stage door Jenny  
Well I saw her last night  
and man she looked like she wasnt gettin any  
Oh  Rock n roll kind of took its toll  
when she shed her inhibitions  
Too many scenes in limousines  
and dressing room intermissions  
  
She was the queen of nineteen sixty four  
But the truth of the matter is  
nobody wants her any more  
There was a time she could have shown them how  
But nobody wants an overage groupie now  
  
When it came to a superstar  
Jenny was a bragger  
She spread it around to everyone in town  
that she made it with Mick Jagger  
Oh  but theres no doubt when the truth comes out  
true love will always conquer  
She didnt get Mick but she got a kick  
and a black eye from Bianca  
  
She was the queen of nineteen sixty four  
What a pity she became a shadow of the girl she was before  
She passed her prime it seems a shame somehow  
But nobody wants an overage groupie now  
  
Dwee da da da dwee da da da dwee da da da da  
Dwee da da da da da da  dwee da da da da  
Dwee da da da da da da da da da da da da da  
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do  
  
Im afraid that this mornings trade  
had a sad obituary  
Therell be no more Jenny at the door  
They took her to the cemetery  
Just an autograph book and a stereo  
there was no one she was close to  
She was found with her arms around an Elvis Presley poster  
  
She was the queen of nineteen sixty four  
Tonight therell be a moment of silence at the Troubador  
There was a time she could have shown em how  
But nobody wants an overage groupie now  
But nobody wants an overage groupie now  
  
Dwee da da da dwee da da da dwee da da da da  
De de de de da da da da da da da da da da da da  
Papa oom a mow mow oom mow mow mow  
Papa oom a mow mow oom mow mow mow  
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do
