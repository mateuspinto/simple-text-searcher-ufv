My daddy got here on the gravy train  
I guess my mama had a real bad start to the game  
They went walking and she took his name  
Round here  
  
There was dancing in the afternoons those days  
Waiting tables chasing girls with the money he made  
It was 1957 and love felt the same love felt the same  
  
Frightened little girl she makes a break  
Into the arms of something better  
Round here  
  
I hear my mama call in Kingsbury Park  
Just me and David and a football that glowed in the dark  
Waiting patiently to make my mark  
Round here  
  
And I remember my first day at school  
And I remember trouble and thinking I was so cool  
I remember it all like yesterday  
  
Dont you  
  
Every time I try to leave this place  
Something inside says You can do better  
Round here  
  
So come with me let me show you where Ive lived  
I want to put my hands in this earth again  
Music fell like rain to the streets  
The Specials and The Jam to The Beat  
Even though I think Ive seen everything there is to see of this world  
I gotta be thankful that this crowded space  
Is the place of my birth  
  
When all that I wanted was to be someone  
  
Two little Hitlers in an old church hall  
Some cheesy covers and those neighbors that banged on the walls  
Andy says its time to show them all  
Round here  
  
Please sir we two have other plans  
Please sir you would not understand  
Whats going on  
Is magical cant you see  
That some of us do more than dream  
  
Every time I try to leave this place  
Something inside says Keep on keeping on and on  
Around here  
  
So come with me let me show you where Ive lived  
I want to put my hands in this earth again  
Music fell like rain to the streets  
The Specials and The Jam ABC  
Even though I think Ive seen everything there is to see of this world  
I gotta be thankful that this crowded space  
Is the place of my birth  
  
My birth  
In this town  
Yes I guess I got to be someone  
  
To be somebody  
In the Beautiful city  
  
This place I call home  
These streets of London  
Its everything I know everything and everybody  
On the streets of London  
I want to thank you  
  
My daddy got here on the gravy train
