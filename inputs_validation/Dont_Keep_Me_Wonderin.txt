Oh tell me bout the car I saw  
Parked outside your door  
Tell me what you left me waiting  
Two or three hours for  
  
Tell me why when the phone rings baby  
Youre up and across the floor  
Please dont keep me wonderin no longer  
I think about the bad times  
  
Lord I think about yours and mine  
You were lost in the silver spoon  
Thought I pulled you out in time  
And I hope that you got reasons  
  
For the way that youve been lyin  
Please dont keep me wonderin no longer  
I think Im gonna go now  
But you know that Ill be back  
  
Now you can think it over Baby  
Tell me how youre gonna act  
Im gonna keep on holding on  
But I dont get no stronger  
  
Please dont keep me wonderin no longer
