Welcome to my world  
Involve yourself within my dream  
Experience a life  
Just like your mind thought not to be  
Take a look through time  
As past or present words to be  
I rule this inferno  
Enthroned for eternity  
  
Chorus  
Coils of the serpent unwind  
Buried beneath you will find  
Deep in the halls of the damned  
Spirit in black till the journeys end  
  
Spirits damned to rot  
Amidst the brimstone fireballs  
Eyes of the dead  
Watching from their living walls  
Broken glass reflections  
Show your flesh eaten away  
Beyond the gates I ll take you  
Where the blood forever rains  
  
Chorus  
  
Afterlife confessions  
Tell me who you used to be  
Looking on in wonder  
As I show you it was me  
Burning from within  
You know one spark is all it takes  
Hear the piercing cries of all  
Who found that hell awaits  
  
Living nightmare cant you see  
You really have no choice  
Faded memories haunt you  
Listen clearly to my voice  
Feed me all your hatred  
Empty all your thoughts to me  
I can fill your emptiness  
With immortality  
  
Welcome to my world  
Involve yourself within my dream  
Experience a life just like your mind thought not to be  
Take a look through time  
As past or present worlds to be  
I rule this inferno  
Enthroned for eternity
