Youre older youre haunted  
Youre ahead of your time  
In corners of acres of blocks of  
Straight lines  
Blurringly hourly we cross some  
Great divides  
Some heritage moments and some  
Melodious minds  
A voice above the engine and the  
Jet stream combined  
its time sir the time sir  
Do you have the time  
As the moon groomed the airplane in a  
Benevolent way  
Again with the myth thats neither here  
Neither there  
Again with the myth from up  
Up high in the air  
Above it all I love you all  
Oh how could this be the end  
Satan backhands our nose and our chin  
The wings tell the tailfins  
its freak turbulence  
  
Just then the Captain assures us  
We will land  
Ill have you on the ground  
In 25 minutes or less  
or less did he say less Unless what  
Were not on time  
Or less he said or less Jet stream  
And engine combine  
Unless he said Or less as if a joke might  
Just keep us flying  
Benevolent way  
  
As the moon groomed the airplane with its  
Benevolent rays
