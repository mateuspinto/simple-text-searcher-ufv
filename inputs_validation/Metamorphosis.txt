Please allow me to try and explain  
Im living proof that man can change  
I knew what I wanted  
I knew how to get it  
  
It didnt make it happy so I started again  
What I wanted to be was a family man  
But nature had some alternative plans  
So I did without the lot put emotion on hold  
And hoped my instincts would do what they were told  
  
I want to know yeah  
I want to know  
  
But every now and then  
Often at night  
A particular feeling would surface in spite  
Of what I told myself and tried to deny  
I kept on asking the question why  
  
Chorus  
I want to know yeah  
I want to know  
You grow up and experience this  
A total metamorphosis  
Its all about change  
Its a metamorphosis  
  
With time and age I had to change  
Cause my behaviour was getting strange  
People on the street caught my eye  
And I began to think I might be their kind of guy  
  
The longterm suppression of an adolescent urge  
Was in retreat and I was on the verge  
Of falling in love or having fun  
Time was running out  
Something had to be done  
  
I want to know yeah  
I want to know  
I want to know yeah  
Tell me whats the reason  
  
Where was I  
Laying down the law  
Dancing with others  
Out on the floor  
  
Music and smoke  
What did it mean  
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream  
I had what I wanted  
  
Madly in love  
Nothing else mattered  
This was enough  
Questions were answered  
Which used to perplex  
In particular those about the big sex  
  
I want to know yeah  
I want to know  
I want to know yeah  
Tell me whats the reason  
  
You grow up and experience this  
A total metamorphosis  
Its all about love  
Its a metamorphosis  
  
Dreaming is easy  
Life is tough  
I got the picture  
The most important thing  
  
Is not to end up bitter  
Cause when you start to feel  
Increasingly forlorner  
Woomph love comes  
Right around the corner  
  
It may not last  
But here am I  
Once a caterpillar  
Now a butterfly  
It can seem strange  
But when you reminisce  
Its all about change  
Its a metamorphosis  
  
Chorus  
  
You grow up and experience this  
A total metamorphosis  
Its all about change  
Its a metamorphosis  
  
Chorus
