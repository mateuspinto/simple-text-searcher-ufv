And you see much better than I see  
And you know all that Im thinking  
To define or redefine too slow  
And it seems all that Im sinking  
Running through the deep  
Gonna find the backwoods  
I found out  
All day long who will be the big men giving some  
  
And you bleed much better than I bleed  
And youve shown all that is so good  
And your word much better than my word  
And you stand right where a hole should  
  
Running through the deep  
Gonna find the backwoods  
I found out  
All day long who will be the big men giving some  
  
To feel divine  
To hold onto ones self  
To give and to give and  
To never receive by myself  
  
Running through the deep I want it  
Gonna find the backwoods I need it  
I found out much more than he did  
All day long who will be the big men giving some  
give it back somehow  
Giving some Im ready to forgive now  
  
Running through the deep  
Gonna find the backwoods  
I found out  
All day long who will be the big men giving some  
Running through the deep gonna find the back backwoods  
I found out gonna get it gonna get it  
All day long who will be the big men  
Are you really really gonna get it
