Dear darlin surprised to hear from me  
Bet youre sittin drinkin coffee yawnin sleepily  
Just to let you know  
Im gonna be home soon  
Im kinda awkward and afraid  
Time has changed your point of view  
  
How you gonna see me now  
Please dont see me ugly babe  
Cause I know I let you down  
In oh so many ways  
How you gonna see me now  
Since weve been on our own  
Are you gonna love the man  
When the man gets home  
  
Listen darlin now Im heading for the west  
Straightened out my head but my old heart is still a mess  
Yes Im worried honey  
Guess thats natural though  
Its like Im waiting for a welcome sign  
Like a hobo in the snow  
  
How you gonna see me now  
Please dont see me ugly babe  
Cause I know I let you down  
In oh so many ways  
How you gonna see me now  
Since weve been on our own  
Are you gonna love the man  
When the man gets home  
  
And just like the first time  
Were just strangers again  
I might have grown out of style  
In the place Ive been  
And just like the first time  
Ill be shakin inside  
When I walk in the door  
Therell be no place to hide  
  
How you gonna see me now  
Please dont see me ugly babe  
Cause I know I let you down  
In oh so many ways  
How you gonna see me now  
Since weve been on our own  
Are you gonna love the man  
When the man gets home
