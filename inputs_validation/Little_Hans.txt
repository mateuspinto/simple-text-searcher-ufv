Lead vocal graham dye  
  
Little hans little hans what do you see  
The worlds is full of big surprises  
Little hans little hans what can they be  
They come in many shapes and sizes  
  
Little boys always love to play  
But something is not quite right  
Little hans wont come out today  
Hes scared of a horse that might bite  
  
Little hans little hans what can it be  
Your thoughts are filled with such confusion  
Little hans little hans when will you see  
Youre barking up the wrong conclusion  
  
Professor man asks him oh so nicely  
Why will you not come out  
Little hans tells him most politely  
What he is thinking about  
  
A ride in a tram a lily white lamb raspberry jam  
Little hans little hans where will you go  
The world is full of compromises  
Little hans little hans how will you know  
The come in many strange disguises  
  
Professor man shakes his head and wonders  
How will he work it out  
Little hans tells him quite precisely  
What hes been dreaming about  
  
I jump in the bath I make myself laugh I ride a giraffe  
  
Little hans little hans I found a clue  
I think Ive made the right connection  
Little hans little hans all I can do  
Is give a common sense injection  
  
Little boys grow up just like daddy  
Professor man has no doubt  
Little hans goes to sleep and wonders  
What he was talking about
