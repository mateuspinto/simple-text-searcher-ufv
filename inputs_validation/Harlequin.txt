Harlequin has lost his crown  
Look they say a broken clown  
Yesterday he ruled the world  
Now hes crying to be heard  
Yesterday he called the tune  
Now hes howling at the moon  
Harlequin has broken down  
Harlequin Harlequin has lost his crown  
  
Harlequin has broken loose  
Slipped the knot and skipped the noose  
Can those bloodhounds find his trail  
Will they send him back to jail  
Can those bloodhounds find his scent  
Will they find out where he went  
Harlequin cannot be found  
Harlequin Harlequin has gone to ground  
  
Harlequin is back on top  
Now his fame will never stop  
See him shown from coast to coast  
Hes the one they love the most  
See them slap him on the back  
How they love his every crack  
Harlequin we knew youd do it  
Harlequin Harlequin  
  
Harlequin Harlequin  
Harlequin Harlequin  
Harlequin Harlequin  
Harlequin Harlequin
