You were good  
I was bad  
I just want everything you had  
Good loving is meant for two  
A bit for me and a bit for you  
Alright oh yeah  
Cmon and make my bed  
Oh baby baby I Cmon  
Kneel and pray  
Oh baby this is what I say  
You did right I did wrong  
Let me sing my simple song  
Oh baby oh please  
Oh tremble on my knees  
Yeah yeah I need you so  
Come in come in oh let us play with sin  
Alright yeah  
Kneel and pray  
Oh baby this is what I say  
Oh  
Lady lady lady  
You better turn around  
Look at the ground  
Tell me what you found  
Aaah oh yeah  
I wanna feel so good inside you  
Alright  
I cant hear you  
I cant see you  
I need you  
You better turn around  
Look at the ground  
Tell me what you found
