Its over I filled our world with hurt  
I cheated and I lied to you and piled up so much dirt  
Now Id lost the only one in life I held so dear  
I slowly bury your love in the dirt behind my years  
You had every right to leave as far as Im concerned  
You gave all your love to me got nothing in return  
You tried and Ill bet youll cry at least the million tears  
But they just couldnt wash away the dirt behind my years  
You had every right to leave as far as Im concerned  
You gave all your love to me got nothing in return  
You tried and Ill bet youll cry at least the million tears  
But they just couldnt wash away the dirt behind my years
