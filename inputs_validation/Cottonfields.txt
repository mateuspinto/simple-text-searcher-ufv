When I was a little bitty baby  
My Momma done rocked me in the cradle  
In them old cottonfields back home  
It was back in Louisiana  
Just about a mile from Texarkana  
In them old cottonfields back home  
Let me tell you now well I got me in a mess  
I caught a nail in my tire doing lickety splits  
I had to walk a long long way to town  
Came along a nice old man  
Well he had a hammer  
Wait a minute mister can you get me some direction  
Im gonna wanna be right off for home  
Oh let them cotton balls get rotten  
I got you baby who needs cotton  
In them old cottonfields back home  
Well it sure feels good to breathe the air back home  
You should have seen their faces when they seen how Id grown  
In them old cotton fields back home
