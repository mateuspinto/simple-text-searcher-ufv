He is sensible and so incredible  
And all my single friends are jealous  
He says everything I need to hear and its like  
I couldnt ask for anything better  
He opens up my door and I get into his car  
And he says you look beautiful tonight  
And I feel perfectly fine  
  
Chorus  
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain  
And its two am and Im cursing your name  
Youre so in love that you act insane  
And thats the way I loved you  
Breakin down and coming undone  
Its a roller coaster kinda rush  
And I never knew I could feel that much  
And thats the way I loved you  
  
He respects my space  
And never makes me wait  
And he calls exactly when he says he will  
Hes close to my mother  
Talks business with my father  
Hes charming and endearing  
And Im comfortable  
  
Chorus  
  
He cant see the smile Im faking  
And my hearts not breaking  
Cause Im not feeling anything at all  
And you were wild and crazy  
Just so frustrating intoxicating  
Complicated got away by some mistake and now  
  
I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain  
And its two am and Im cursing your name  
Im so in love that I acted insane  
And thats the way I loved you  
Breakin down and coming undone  
Its a roller coaster kinda rush  
And I never knew I could feel that much  
And thats the way I loved you  
  
And thats the way I loved you oh oh  
Never knew I could feel that much  
And thats the way I loved you
