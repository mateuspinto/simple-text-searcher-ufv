Nothing I must do  
Nowhere I should be  
No one in my life  
To answer to but me  
No more candlelights  
No more purple skies  
No one to be near  
As my heart slowly dies  
  
Chorus  
If I could hold you one more time  
Like in the days when you were mine  
Id look at you  
Till I was blind  
So you would stay  
Id say a prayer each time you sign  
Cradle the moments like a child  
Id stop the world if only i  
Could hold you one more time  
Mmmmmm    
  
Ive memorized your face  
I know your touch by heart  
Still lost in your embrace  
I dream of where you are  
  
Chorus
