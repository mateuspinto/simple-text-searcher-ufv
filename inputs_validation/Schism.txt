I know the pieces fit cause I watched them fall away  
Mildewed and smoldering Fundamental differing  
Pure intention juxtaposed will set two lovers souls in motion  
Disintegrating as it goes testing our communication  
The light that fueled our fire then has burned a hole between us so  
We cannot see to reach an end crippling our communication  
I know the pieces fit cause I watched them tumble down  
No fault none to blame it doesnt mean I dont desire to  
Point the finger blame the other watch the temple topple over  
To bring the pieces back together rediscover communication  
The poetry that comes from the squaring off between  
And the circling is worth it  
Finding beauty in the dissonance  
There was a time that the pieces fit but I watched them fall away  
Mildewed and smoldering strangled by our coveting  
Ive done the math enough to know the dangers of our second guessing  
Doomed to crumble unless we grow and strengthen our communication  
Cold silence has a tendency to atrophy any  
Sense of compassion  
Between supposed lovers  
I know the pieces fit
