Tall and tan and young and lovely the girl from Ipanema goes walking  
And when she passes each one she passes goes  ah  
When she walks shes like a samba that swings so cool and sways so gentle  
When she passes each one she passes goes  ooh  
  
Ooh but I watch her so sadly how can I tell her I love her  
Yes I would give my heart gladly  
But each day when she walks to the sea  
She looks straight ahead not at me
