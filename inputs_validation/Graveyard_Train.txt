On the highway thirty people lost their lives  
On the highway thirty people lost their lives  
Well I had some words to holler and my Rosie took a ride  
  
In the moonlight see the greyhound rollin on  
In the moonlight see the greyhound rollin on  
Flyin through the crossroads rosie ran into the hound  
  
For the graveyard thirty boxes made of bone  
For the graveyard thirty boxes made of bone  
  
Mister undertaker take this coffin from my home  
  
In the midnight hear me cryin out her name  
In the midnight hear me cryin out her name  
Im standin on the railroad waitin for the graveyard train  
  
On the highway thirty people turned to stone  
On the highway thirty people turned to stone  
Oh take me to the station cause Im number thirtyone
