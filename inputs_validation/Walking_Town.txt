One foot after the other  
One place pretty much like another  
Some folks got a pretty good deal  
Some are just looking for their next meal  
Out here where the days go by  
And the glances never meet the eye  
Its a walking town  
And Im just out here walking round  
Walking round this walking town  
  
You got a house on top of a hill  
And a powerful automobile  
The windows up the AC high  
In a world of comfort speeding by  
Stressed out in the latest style  
How long has it been since you walked a mile  
In yours or anybody elses shoes  
Well in any life there will be dues  
Its a walking town  
And Im just out here walking round  
Walking round this walking town  
  
Walking up walking down  
Walking back walking round  
Walking mute walking bound  
Walking through your walking town  
  
One foot on the concrete shore  
One foot in the human sea  
Night falls on the streets of the city  
And it falls over you and me  
And all our dreams and our descriptions  
Of the life this was supposed to be  
Drift above the rooftops and the houses  
Until the sunlight finds me where I lay  
And its a walking town  
And Im back out here walking round  
Walking round this walking town
