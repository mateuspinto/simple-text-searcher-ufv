A man can lose his past in a country like this  Wandering aimless   
Parched and nameless   
A Man could lose his way in a country like this  Canyons and cactus   
Endless and trackless  
  
Searching through grim eternity  
Sculptured by prehistoric sea   
  
Seven Cities of Gold   
Stories that fired my imagination  
Seven Cities of Gold   
A splendid mirage in this desolation  
Seven Cities of Gold   
Glowing in my dreams like hallucinations  
Glitter in the sun like a revelation  
Distant as a comet or a constellation  
  
A man can lose himself in a country like this  
Rewrite the story   
Recapture the glory   
A man could lose his life in a country like this  Sunblind and friendless   
Frozen and endless   
The nights grow longer the father I go  
  
Wake to aching cold and a deep Sahara of snow   
That gleam in the distance could be heavens gate  
  
A longawaited treasure at the end of my cruel fate
