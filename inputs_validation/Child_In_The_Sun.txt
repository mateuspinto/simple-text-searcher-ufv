I am just a child in the sun  
Just another soul on the run  
One more of your unwanted sons  
Tell me where can I go  
  
I had a line I tried for a while  
Now Im walkin mile after mile  
On my face no trace of a smile  
Why does time pass so slow  
  
Take me down to the river  
Take me down to the sea  
Where I can drown all my sorrows  
Wash all my troubles away  
Watch all my cares sail away  
  
I have no ties my hands are unbound  
There is no friend no love I have found  
I have no ups Im fixed to the ground  
Tell me river where you flow
