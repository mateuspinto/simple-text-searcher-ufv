Not a word was heard  
At the tomb that day  
Just shuffling of soldiers feet  
As they guarded the grave  
One day two days  
Three days had past  
Could it be that Jesus  
Breathed His last  
  
Could it be that His Father  
Had forsaken him  
Turned his back on his son  
Despising our sin  
All hell seemed to whisper  
Just forget Him Hes dead  
Then the Father looked down  
To his son and he said  
  
Arise My love  
Arise My love  
The grave no longer  
Has a hold on you  
No more deaths sting  
No more suffering  
Arise Arise My love  
  
The Earth trembled  
And the tomb began to shake  
And like lightning  
From Heaven the stone was rolled away  
And as dead man  
The guards they all stood there in fright  
As the power of love  
Displayed its might  
Then suddenly a melody  
Filled the air  
Riding wings of wind  
It was everywhere  
The words all creation  
Had been longing to hear  
The sweet sound of victory  
So loud and clear  
  
Arise my love  
Arise my love  
The grave no longer has a hold on you  
No more deaths sting  
No more suffering  
Arise Arise  
  
Sin where are your shackles  
Death where is your sting  
Hell has been defeated  
The grave could not hold the king  
  
Arise My love  
Arise My love  
The grave no longer  
Has a hold on you  
No more deaths sting  
No more suffering  
Arise Arise Arise
