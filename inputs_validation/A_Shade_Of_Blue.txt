A lifetime waiting for the light to shine  
Suddenly you were here like an angel appeared  
And the world that I knew changed into a wonderland  
Then you called out my name Looked around and I found You were gone  
Like the rays of the sun disappeared into never ending nights  
  
Chorus  
Where everything real has turned to stone  
And the songbird has flown youre gone  
Now I know a rose can change a shade of blue  
Ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
A shade of blue  
  
My bodys hurting crying and yearning  
Sometimes I feel like Im loosing my mind  
And I think about you knowing only you could understand  
Here alone in my room I can feel all the walls closing in  
Feeling trapped in a shell wishing that I could spin the wheels of change
