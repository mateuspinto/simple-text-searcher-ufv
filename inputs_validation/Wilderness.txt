I traveled far and wide through many different times  
What did you see there  
I saw the saints with their toys  
What did you see there  
I saw all knowledge destroyed  
I traveled far and wide through many different times  
  
I traveled far and wide through prisons of the cross  
What did you see there  
The power and glory of sin  
What did you see there  
The blood of Christ on their skins  
I traveled far and wide through many different times  
  
I traveled far and wide and unknown martyrs died  
What did you see there  
I saw the one sided trials  
What did you see there  
I saw the tears as they cried  
They had tears in their eyes  
  
Tears in their eyes  
Tears in their eyes  
Tears in their eyes
