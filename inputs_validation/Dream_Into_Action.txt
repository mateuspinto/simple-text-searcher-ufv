Between every man there is a division  
Nobody ever seems to get it right  
Even between friends there is a long gap  
One of them makes a mistake there is a fight  
Whatever you do you have the benefit of the doubt  
Whatever I do please understand  
Whatever we do lets make a pledge to put it right  
So we can end the rule of the division  
Putting the dream into action into action  
Putting the dream into action into action  
Whatever you like to do then let that be my pleasure  
Whatever you like to say Ill try to understand  
Whatever you do you have the benefit of the doubt  
Whatever I do please understand  
Whatever we do lets make a pledge to put it right  
So we can end the rule of the division  
Putting the dream into action into action  
You are strong  
We are strong  
You feel it  
We feel it  
You are strong  
We are strong  
You are action  
Putting the dream into action
