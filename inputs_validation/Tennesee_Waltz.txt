I was dancin with my baby to the Tennessee Waltz  
When an old friend I just happened to see  
I introduced her to my loved one  
And while they were dancin  
My friend stole my sweetheart from me  
I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz  
And I knew just how much I had lost  
I have lost my little darlin  
The night they were playing  
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz  
I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz  
And I knew just how much I had lost  
I have lost my little darlin  
The night they were playing  
The beautiful beautiful Tennessee Waltz  
The Tennessee Waltz
