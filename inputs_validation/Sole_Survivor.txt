I got that fever  
Burning my head  
So many memories  
No tear so shed  
Burns like a fire  
Who stole my aims  
My comrade fighters  
Been sent astray  
  
How could I know  
What others had in mind for me  
How would they know  
What measures I take  
  
Sole survivor  
Of a kill without alert sing your feelings out  
Your song remains unheard  
Sole survivor  
  
We shared like brothers  
A light in the black  
Totally blended  
Bold and erect  
But weve grown intriguers  
Till its too late  
Time has brought fire  
Fear greed and hate  
  
Now Im cryin  
Shattered on the ground  
All I find  
Has died anyway  
  
Sole survivor  
Of a kill without alert sing your feelings out  
Your song remains unheard  
Sole survivor  
Got a voice without a sound  
Mean mistreaters  
Took away your ground  
Sole survivor  
  
SOLO  
  
Sole survivor
