Are Sambora  
  
Its amazing  
We go through changes  
When times get crazy  
Its up and down its hot and cold  
These complications  
Just keep on coming  
These aint no running  
When it comes to life thats how it goes  
Round and round we go  
Sometimes it feels like  
Were on a roller coaster ride  
Baby dont you know  
It could eat up  
If you try and keep it all inside  
Seems like hard times come easy  
We do a lot of hangin on these days  
But the heart finds a reason  
And love always seems to find a way  
Even if it hurts  
Even if it hurts us baby  
Theres gonna be thunder  
Theres gonna be rain  
Theres gonna be those times  
We both get caught up in the pain  
The realization  
Keeps sinkin in  
The way you make it  
Is learn to take it on the chin  
Round and round we go  
Its just another day  
With trouble knockin at your door  
Baby dont you know  
We can work it out  
Cause we always seem to find a cure  
Seems like hard times come easy  
We do a lot of hangin on these days  
But the heart finds a reason  
And love always seems to find a way  
Even if it hurts  
Even if it hurts us baby  
  
Round and round we go  
Sometimes it feels like  
Were on a roller coaster ride  
Baby dont you know  
Well keep holdin on  
Through the changes that we feel inside  
Seems like hard times come easy  
We do a lot of hangin on these days  
But the heart finds a reason  
And love always seems to find a way  
Hard times come easy babe
