Day is done and night is calling  
From the window light is falling  
Shadows spinning on the walls  
And dancing in the light  
And round the door the kids are playing  
Like June bugs into the light  
And it seems like Im looking at a mighty good time  
All alone tonight  
Hands aclapping voices singing  
Tambourines and guitars ringing  
Echoes through the willows  
Bringing music to the night  
And in the wind the whippoorwills crying  
Cold and all alone  
And I am standing outside of a mighty good time  
All alone tonight  
Well I cant recall when Louisiana music  
Ever sounded so sweet  
Just listen to the fiddle playing  
Bonapartes Retreat  
Well I just cant take no more  
I gotta make it through that door  
And dance until the break of day  
As long as theres still music playing  
Bet your life I wont be staying all alone tonight  
Well I just cant take no more  
I gotta make it through that door  
And dance until the break of day  
As long as theres still music playing  
Bet your life I wont be staying all alone tonight
