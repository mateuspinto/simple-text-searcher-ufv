All i get is mixed signals from you  
But you never give me a simple clue  
Im stuck in a well with tear drops falling  
My guide out is your voice but i dont hear your calling  
I always hear through the grape vine  
That you you talk about me all the time  
  
Chours  
  
Where do i turn for shelter from this heartbreaking storm  
I used to be able to turn to you to keep me safe and warm  
But now she came in the picture  
And ripped our future from my grasp  
why cant you say you want me back  
So everything can be like our past  
And love me again
