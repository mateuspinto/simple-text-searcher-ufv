The things I used to like I dont like any more  
I want a lot of other things Ive never had before  
Its just like my mama says I sit around and mourn  
Pretending that I am so wonderful and knowing Im adored  
  
Im as restless as a willow in a windstorm  
Im as jumpy as a puppet on a string  
Id say that I had spring fever  
But I know it isnt spring  
  
Im as starry eyed and gravely discontented  
Like a nightingale without a song to sing  
Oh why should I have spring fever  
When it isnt even spring  
  
I keep wishing I were somewhere else  
Walking down a strange new street  
Hearing words I have never never heard  
From a man Ive yet to meet  
  
Im as busy as a spider spinning daydreams  
Im as giddy as a baby on a swing  
I havent seen a crocus or a rosebud  
Or a robin or a bluebird on the wing  
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way  
That it might as well be spring  
It might as well be might as well be  
It might as well be spring
