Watch the band through a bunch of dancers  
Quickly follow the unknown with something more familiar  
Quickly something familiar  
Courage my word it didnt come it doesnt matter  
  
Sleepwalk so fast asleep in a motel  
That has the lay of home and piss on all of your  
Background and piss on all your surroundings  
Courage my word it didnt come it doesnt matter  
Courage it couldnt come at a worse time  
  
So theres no simple explanation  
For anything important any of us do  
And yeah the human tragedy  
Consists in the necessity  
Of living with the consequences  
Under pressure under pressure  
Courage my word it didnt come it doesnt matter  
Courage it couldnt come at a worse time
