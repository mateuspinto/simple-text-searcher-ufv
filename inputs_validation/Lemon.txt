See through in the sunlight  
She wore lemon  
But never in the daylight  
Shes gonna make you cry  
Shes gonna make you whisper and moan  
And when youre dry  
She draws her water from the stone  
  
And I feel  
Like Im slowly slowly slowly slipping under  
And I feel  
Like Im holding onto nothing  
  
She wore lemon  
To color in the cold grey night  
She had heaven  
And she held on so tight  
  
A man makes a picture  
A moving picture  
Through the light projected  
He can see himself up close  
A man captures color  
A man likes to stare  
He turns his money into light to look for her  
  
And I feel  
Like Im drifting drifting drifting from the shore  
And I feel  
Like Im swimming out to her  
  
Midnight is where the day begins  
Midnight is where the day begins  
Midnight is where the day begins  
  
Lemon  
See through in the sunlight  
  
A man builds a city  
With banks and cathedrals  
A man melts the sand so he can  
See the world outside  
Her there  
A man makes a car  
Destination  
And builds roads to run them on  
A man dreams of leaving  
But he always stays behind  
  
And these are the days  
When our work has come asunder  
And these are the days  
When we look for something other  
  
Midnight is where the day begins  
Midnight is where the day begins  
Midnight is where the day begins  
Midnight is where the day begins  
Midnight is where the day begins  
  
Midnight is where the day begins  
Midnight is where the day begins  
Midnight is where the day begins  
Midnight is where the day begins  
Midnight is where the day begins  
  
A man makes a picture  
A moving picture  
Through the light projected  
He can see himself up close  
Her there  
A man captures color  
Destination  
A man likes to stare  
There  
He turns his money into light  
To look for her  
She is the dreamer  
Shes imagination  
Through the light projected  
He can see himself up close
