I pulled into Nazareth was feelin bout half past dead  
I just need some place where I can lay my head  
Hey mister can you tell me where a man might find a bed  
He just grinned and shook my hand and No was all he said  
  
Take a load off Fanny  
Take a load for free  
Take a load off Fanny  
And and and you can put the load right on me  
  
Picked up my bag went lookin for a place to hide  
When I saw Carmen and the Devil walkin side by side  
I said Hey Carmen come on lets go downtown  
She said I gotta go but mfriend can stick around  
  
Take a load off Fanny

Crazy Chester followed me and he caught me in the fog  
He said I will fix your rack if youll take Jack my dog  
I said Wait a minute Chester Im a peaceful man  
He said Thats OK just feed him when you can

Catch a cannon ball now to take me down the line  
My bag is sinking low and I do believe its time  
To get back to Miss Fanny you know shes the only one  
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone  
  
Take a load off Fanny
