Every night before I go to sleep  
Find a ticket win a lottery  
Scoop the pearls up from the sea  
Cash them in and buy you all the things you need  
Every night before I rest my head  
See those dollar bills go swirling round my bed  
I know theyre stolen but I dont feel bad  
I take that money buy you things you never had  
Oh baby it would mean so much to me  
Oh baby to buy you all the things you need for free  
Ill buy you a jet plane baby get you on a higher plane to a jet stream  
And take you through the stratosphere  
And check out the planets there and then take you down deep  
Where its hot hot in Arabia babia then cool cold fields of snow  
And well roll dream roll dream roll roll dream dream  
When we dream it when we dream it when we dream it  
Well dream it dream it for free free money  
Free money free money free money free money free money  
Free money  
Every night before I go to sleep  
Find a ticket win a lottery  
Every night before I rest my head  
See those dollar bills go swirling round my bed  
Oh baby it would mean so much to me  
Baby I know our troubles will be gone  
Oh I know our troubles will be gone goin gone  
If we dream dream dream for free  
And when we dream it when we dream it when we dream it  
Lets dream it well dream it for free free money
