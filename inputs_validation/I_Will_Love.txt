I will love You Lord my strength  
I belong to You  
I will bless You while I live  
And I will lift my hands up in Your name  
  
Jesus You alone are holy  
You alone are holy  
Name above every name  
Lord Jesus You alone are worthy  
You alone are worthy  
Jesus the Lamb that was slain  
  
Nailed to the cross for me  
Died and rose again  
You redeemed me to the Father by Your blood  
You cleansed me from all sin
