Take all your problems  
And rip em apart  
Oh oh oh  
Carry them off  
In a shopping cart  
Oh oh oh  
  
And another thing you  
Shouldve known from the start  
The problems in hand  
Are lighter than at heart  
  
Be like the squirrel girl  
Be like the squirrel  
Give it a whirl girl  
Be like the squirrel  
  
And another thing  
You have to know in this world  
Cut up your hair  
Straighten your curls  
Well you problems  
Hide in your curls
