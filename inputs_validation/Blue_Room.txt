Well have a blue room  
A new room for two room  
Where every days a holiday  
Because youre married to me  
  
Not like a ball room  
A small room a hall room  
Where I can smoke my pipe away  
With your wee head upon my knee  
  
We will thrive on keep alive on  
Just nothing but kisses  
With mister and missus  
Own little blue chairs  
  
You sew your trousseau  
and Robinson Crusoe  
Is not so far from worldly cares  
As our blue room far away upstairs  
  
They will thrive on keep alive on  
Just nothing but kisses  
With mister and missus  
Own little blue chair  
  
Shell wear her trousseau  
and Robinson Crusoe  
Is not so far from worldly cares  
As our blue room  
Far away upstairs
