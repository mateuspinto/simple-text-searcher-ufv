Its a little bit funny this feeling inside  
Im not one of those who can easily hide  
I dont have much money but boy if I did  
Id buy a big house where we both could live  
  
And you can tell everybody this is your song  
It may be quite simple but now that its done  
I hope you dont mind I hope you dont mind that  
I put down in words  
How wonderful life is while youre in the world  
  
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss  
Well a few of the verses well theyve got me quite cross  
But the suns been quite kind while  
I wrote this song  
Its for people like you that keep it turned on  
  
And you can tell everybody this is your song  
It may be quite simple but now that its done  
I hope you dont mind I hope you dont mind that I put down in words  
How wonderful life is while youre in the world
