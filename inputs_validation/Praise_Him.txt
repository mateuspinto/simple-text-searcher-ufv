Looking out my window  
I see the trees blowing in the breeze  
Looking out my window  
I see the birds flying in the sky  
And I know  
With just one breath  
You created the whole world  
And I know  
If I dont praise You  
The rocks will soon cry out cry out cry out  
Praise Him  
Lift your voices  
Let it ring  
Throughout all the earth  
Praise Him  
Let all men know that Jesus Christ  
He is alive
