Behind a burning bush hes waiting  
Like a sleepless night  
So silent and so strong  
I know that I must push push push  
Until the morning light  
Dont make me wait too long  
  
Till I open my eyes  
Open the door  
Take a walk outside  
And feel the sun  
Fall on my skin  
Its time to get up  
But not time to give in  
I just woke up  
  
With eyes as cold as ice cream  
Floating in a frozen lake  
I have to set the spark  
And stroke the fire within him  
Oh I have to see him smile  
To have a happy heart  
  
I opened my eyes  
Walked outside and I realised  
That what I saw was there before  
But I opened my eyes  
When I opened the door  
I just woke up  
  
One day I just woke up  
I opened my eyes  
Opened the door took a walk outside  
And what I saw was there before  
But I opened my eyes when I opened the door  
I just woke up  
  
Oh let me open my eyes  
Open the door and look up to the skies  
And leave the shore  
And let my hand trail in the cool water  
Float downstream say goodbye to  
That dreamI just woke up  
  
I opened my eyes  
I walked outside and I realised  
That what I saw was there before  
But I opened my mind when I  
Opened the doorI just woke up
