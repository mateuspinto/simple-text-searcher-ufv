Screams and nightmares  
Of a life I want  
Cant see living this lie no  
A world I haunt  
Youve lost all control of my  
Heart and soul  
Satan holds my future  
Watch it unfold  
  
I am the Antichrist  
Its what I was meant to be  
Your God left me behind  
And set my soul to be free  
  
Watching disciples  
Of the satanic rule  
Pentagram of blood  
Holds the jackals truth  
Searching for the answer  
Christ hasnt come  
Awaiting the final moment  
The birth of Satans son  
  
Screams  
From a life I live  
Torment  
Is what I give  
Torture  
Is what I love  
The down fall  
Of the heavens above  
  
I am the Antichrist  
All love is lost  
Insanity is what I am  
Eternally my soul will rot
