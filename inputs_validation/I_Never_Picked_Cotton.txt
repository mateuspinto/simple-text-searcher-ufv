Chorus  
I never picked cotton  
But my mother did  
And my brother did  
And my sister did  
And my daddy died young  
Workin in a coal mine  
  
When I was just a baby  
Too little for a cotton sack  
I played in the dirt  
While others worked  
Til they couldnt straighten their backs  
I made myself a promise  
When I was big enough to run  
That Id never stay a single day  
In that Oklahoma sun  
  
Chorus  
  
Folks said I grew up early  
And that the farm couldnt hold me then so I stole ten bucks  
And a pickup truck  
And I never went back again  
Then it was fast cars and whiskey  
Long haired girls and fun  
I had everything that money could bring  
And I took it with a gun  
  
Chorus  
  
It was Saturday night in Memphis  
When a redneck grabbed my shirt  
When he said go back to your cotton sack  
I left him dying in the dirt  
Theyll take me in the morning  
To the gallos just outside  
And in the time I got  
There aint a hell of a lot  
That I can look back on with pride
