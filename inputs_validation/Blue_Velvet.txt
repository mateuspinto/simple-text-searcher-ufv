She wore blue velvet  
Bluer than velvet was the night  
Softer than satin was the light  
From the stars  
  
She wore blue velvet  
Bluer than velvet were her eyes  
Warmer than may her tender sighs  
Love was ours  
  
Ours a love I held tightly  
Feeling the rapture grow  
Like a flame burning brightly  
But when she left gone was the glow of  
  
She wore blue velvet  
But in my heart therell always be  
Precious and warm a memory through the years  
And I still can see blue velvet through my tears
