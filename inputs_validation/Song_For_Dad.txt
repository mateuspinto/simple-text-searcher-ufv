Lately Ive been noticing  
I say the same things he used to say  
And I even find myself acting the very same way  
I tap my fingers on the table  
To the rhythm in my soul  
And I jingle the car keys  
When Im ready to go  
When I look in the mirror  
Hes right there in my eyes  
Starin back at me and I realize  
  
Chorus  
The older I get  
The more I can see  
How much he loved my mother and my brother and me  
And he did the best that he could  
And I only hope when I have my own family  
That everyday I see  
A little more of my father in me  
  
There were times I thought he was bein  
Just a little bit hard on me  
But now I understand he was makin me  
Become the man he knew that I could be  
In everything he ever did  
He always did with love  
And Im proud today to say Im his son  
When somebody says I hope I get to meet your dad  
I just smile and say you already have  
  
Chorus  
  
Hes in my eyes  
My heart my soul  
My hands my pride  
And when I feel alone  
  
And I think I cant go on  
I hear him sayin Son youll be alright  
Everythings gonna be alright  
Yes it is  
  
The older I get  
The more I can see  
That he loved my mother and my brother and me  
And he did the best that he could  
And I only hope when I have my own family  
That everyday I see  
Oh I hope I see  
I hope everyday I see  
A little more of my father in me  
  
A little more of my father in me  
I hope everyday I see in me  
In me  
In me  
I hope everyday I see  
  
A little more of my father in me
