Hello friend Ive come a callin  
Passively stationed active patrol  
Slidin in at high noon like some reluctant sheriff  
Not wanna get involved in it all  
Who stands guard for each other  
Why must we guard anything at all  
Anything at all  
From the earths four corners the people are calling  
Forming equations but the questions are hard  
All men are brothers killing each other  
And Mother Earth is wringing in wonder  
Who stands guard for each other  
Oh why must we guard anything at all  
Anything at all  
Whirl away now  
Whirl away now  
Whirl away now  
Whirl away  
Theres a cross on the road theres a great mill turnin  
Some seeking answers some born to dancers  
You can hold on the blade and turn around forever  
Be flung into space into another kind of grace  
Who stands guard for each other  
Oh why must we guard anything at all  
Anything at all  
Whirl away now  
Whirl away now  
Whirl away now  
Whirl away  
Whirl away now  
Whirl away now  
Whirl away now  
Whirl away  
Give Incomprehensible  
Some giveth their hand  
Some giveth their land  
Some giveth their life  
You lay in the fields of grain the staff of life all around you  
But yet you you will cut someone down  
For their possessions some material thing  
And our children theyre being blown away like wishes in the wind  
For the sake of their coat  
Or the colors of their coat  
Or the color of their skin  
Or the name on their shoes  
And the mother cries  
Why they taken my son  
And the father wonders  
Are they taking my boy  
He extended his hand  
He gave them his land  
He gave them his bread  
He gave them his heart  
Said Hello friend
