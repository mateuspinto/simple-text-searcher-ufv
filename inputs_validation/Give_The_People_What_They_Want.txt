Hey hey hey  
Give the people what they want  
  
Well its been said before the world is a stage  
A different performance with every age  
Open the history book to any old page  
Bring on the lions and open the cage  
  
Give the people what they want  
You gotta give the people what they want  
The more they get the more they need  
And every time they get harder and harder to please  
  
The Roman promoters really did things right  
They needed a show that would clearly excite  
The attendance was sparse so they put on a fight  
Threw the Christians to the lions sold out every night  
  
Give the people what they want  
You gotta give the people what they want  
The more they get the more they need  
And every time they get harder and harder to please  
  
Give em lots of sex perversion and rape  
Give em lots of violence and plenty to hate  
Give the people what they want  
Give the people what they want  
  
When Oswald shot Kennedy he was insane  
But still we watch the reruns again and again  
We all sit glued while the killer takes aim
