The chamber was in confusion  all the voices shouting loud  
I could only just hear a voice quite near say Please help me through the
crowd  
I said if I helped her thru she could help me too but I could see that she
wholly blind  
But from her pale face and her pale skin a moonlight shined  
  
Lilywhite Lilith  
She gonna take you thru the tunnel of night  
Lilywhite Lilith  
She gonna lead you right  
  
When Id led her through the people the angry noise began to grow  
She said Let me feel the way the breezes blow and Ill show you where to
go  
So I followed her into a big round cave she said Theyre coming for you
now dont be afraid  
Then she sat me down on a cold stone throne carved in jade  
  
Lilywhite Lilith  
She gonna take you thru the tunnel of night  
Lilywhite Lilith  
She gonna lead you right  
  
She leaves me in my darkness  
I have to face face my fear  
And the darkness closes in on me  
I can hear a whirring sound growing near  
I can see the corner of the tunnel  
Lit up by whatevers coming here  
Two golden globes float into the room  
And a blaze of white light fills the air
