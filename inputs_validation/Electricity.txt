The Minus is loveless  
He talks to the land  
And the leaves fall  
And the pond overices  
She dont know the system Plus  
She dont understand  
Shes got all the wrong fuses and splices  
Shes not going to fix it up  
Too easy  
  
The masking tape tangles  
Its sticky and black  
And the copper  
Proud headed Queen Lizzie  
Conducts little charges  
That dont get charged back  
Well the technical manuals busy  
Shes not going to fix it up too easy  
And she holds out her flashlight  
And she shines it on me  
She wants me to tell her  
What the trouble might be  
Well Im learning  
Its peaceful  
With a good dog and some trees  
Out of touch with the breakdown  
Of this century  
Theyre not going to fix it up  
Too easy  
  
We once lovedtogether  
And we floodlit that time  
Inputoutputelectricity  
But the lines overloaded  
And the sparks started flying  
And the loose wires  
Were lashing out at me  
Shes not going to fix that up  
Too easy  
But she holds out her candle  
And she shines it in  
And she begs him to show her  
How to fix it again  
While the song that he sang her  
To soothe her to sleep  
Runs all through her circuits  
Like a heartbeat  
Shes not going to fix it up  
Too easy
