Who tends the fire  
Who keeps the torches lit  
Who fills your eyes with smoke  
So you cant see  
I need the fire  
I need the torches lit  
To see through all the smoke covering me  
  
I have seen the fires burning  
Burning through the night  
I have watched the tides a turning  
And they go from dark to light  
  
What is this meaning  
What does this writing mean  
Where do I go  
What do I do for now  
Prophecies are foolish  
They never last  
They never speak the truth  
So why are they calling me now  
  
I dont know cause I cannot see  
All Im sure is gotta be  
Im not sure that Im even me  
But I know that I gotta be  
Yes I know that youre gonna die  
Birth life death is the reason why  
Save those fears that youre gonna cry  
Cause I know that youre gonna die  
Yes I know I cannot see  
And Im sure that I gotta be  
All these voices are killin me  
But they say that I got  
Say that I got  
Say that I gotta be me  
  
Who tends the fire  
Who keeps the torches lit  
Who fill your eyes with smoke  
So you cant see  
I need the fire  
I need the torches lit to see
