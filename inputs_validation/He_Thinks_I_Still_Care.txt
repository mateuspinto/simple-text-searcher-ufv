He thinks I still  
He thinks I still  
He thinks I still care  
  
Just because I asked a friend about him  
Just because I spoke his name somewhere  
Just because I called his number by mistake last night  
He thinks I still  
He thinks I still  
He thinks I still care  
  
Just because I haunt the same old places  
Where his memory seems to linger everywhere  
Just because Im not the happy girl I used to be  
He thinks I still  
He thinks I still  
He thinks I still care  
  
He used to treat me so unkind  
Now he doesnt cross my mind  
  
He thinks I still love him so  
But why that is I just dont know  
  
Ive got friends all over town  
And he can never bring me down  
  
The things he did was so unfair  
How could he think that I still care
