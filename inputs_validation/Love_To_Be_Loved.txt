So you know how people are  
When its all gone much too far  
The way their minds are made  
Still theres something you should know  
That I could not let show  
That fear of letting go  
  
And in this moment I need to be needed  
With this darkness all around me I like to be liked  
In this emptiness and fear I want to be wanted  
Cause I love to be loved  
I love to be loved Repeat x2  
Yes I love to be loved  
  
I cry the way that babies cry  
The way they cant deny  
The way they feel  
Words they climb all over you  
Til they uncover you  
From where you hide  
  
And in this moment I need to be needed  
When my selfesteem is sinking I like to be liked  
In this emptiness and fear  
I want to be wanted  
Cause I love to be loved  
I love to be loved Repeat x2  
Oh I love to be loved  
  
This old familiar craving  
Ive been here before this way of behaving  
Dont know who the hell Im saving anymore  
Let it pass let it go let it leave  
From the deepest place I grieve  
This time I believe  
  
And I let go Repeat x2  
I can let go of it  
Though it takes all the strength in me  
And all the world can see  
Im losing such a central part of me  
I can let go of it  
You know I mean it  
You know that I mean it  
I recognize how much Ive lost  
But I cannot face the cost  
Cause I love to be loved  
  
Yes I love to be loved  
I love to be loved  
Repeat x3  
  
I love to be loved  
  
I love to be loved  
Yes I love to be loved
