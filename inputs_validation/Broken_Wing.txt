Today I watched a robin  
In our front yard  
I thought by now that they should all be gone  
With winter round the corner  
Snow on its way  
Surely something must be wrong  
Then in that old oak tree I finally saw her  
Where she sat gazing down upon her mate  
And the song that she was singing  
Seemed to say Ill be right here  
Id like to go but your loves made me stay  
  
Hes got a broken wing  
And thats why he cant fly  
She just cant leave him there  
So she stays by his side  
Theyre just like you and me  
Oh you shouldve heard her sing  
They wont give up  
Its just a broken wing  
  
I wish we all could learn  
What they seem to have found  
To love our families  
When trouble comes around  
Ill bet that God saw fit  
To show them unto me  
Him on the ground  
Her in that tree  
  
Hes got a broken wing  
And thats why he cant fly  
She just cant leave him there  
So she stays by his side  
Theyre just like you and me  
Oh you shouldve heard her sing  
They wont give up  
We wont give up  
They wont give up  
Its just a broken wing  
  
Ooh  
Its just a broken wing
