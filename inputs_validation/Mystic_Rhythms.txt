So many things I think about  
When I look far away  
Things I know  things I wonder  
Things Id like to say  
The more we think we know about  
The greater the unknown  
We suspend our disbelief  
And we are not alone  
  
Mystic rhythms  capture my thoughts  
And carry them away  
Mysteries of night escape the light of day  
Mystic rhythms  under northern lights  
Primitive things stir  
The hearts of everyone  
  
We sometimes catch a window  
A glimpse of whats beyond  
Was it just imagination  
Stringing us along  
More things than are dreamed about  
Unseen and unexplained  
We suspend our disbelief  
And we are entertained  
  
Mystic rhythms  capture my thoughts  
And carry them away  
Nature seems to spin  
A supernatural way  
Mystic rhythms  under city lights  
Or a canopy of stars  
We feel the powers  
And we wonder what they are  
We feel the push and pull  
Of restless rhythms from afar
