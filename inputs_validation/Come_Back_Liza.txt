Whenever Im away from Liza water come to me eye  
Every time Im away from Liza water come to me eye  
  
Chorus  
Come back Liza come back girl  
Wipe the tear from me eye  
Come back Liza come back girl  
Wipe the tear from me eye  
  
When the evening starts to fall water come to me eye  
I need to hear my liza call water come to me eye  
  
Chorus  
  
Standing here in the marketplace water come to me eye  
I need to see my Lizas face water come to me eye  
  
Chorus  
  
Whenever Im away from Liza water come to me eye  
Whenever Im away from Liza water come to me eye  
  
Chorus
