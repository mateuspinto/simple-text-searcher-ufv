I dont want to be hostile  
I dont want to be dismal  
But I dont want to rot in an apathetic existence either  
See I want to believe you  
And I want to trust  
And I want to have faith to put away the dagger  
But you lie cheat and steal  
And yet I tolerate you  
Veil of virtue hung to hide your method  
While I smile and laugh and dance  
And sing your praise and glory  
Shroud of virtue hung to mask your stigma  
As I smile and laugh and dance  
And sing your glory  
While you lie cheat and steal  
How can I tolerate you  
Our guilt our blame  
Ive been far too sympathetic  
Our blood our fault  
Ive been far too sympathetic  
I am not innocent  
You are not innocent  
No one is innocent  
I will no longer tolerate you  
Even if I must go down beside you  
Because no one is innocent
