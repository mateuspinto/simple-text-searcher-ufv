All in all its no ones fault  
Excuses turn to carbon walls  
Blame it all on chemical intercourse  
  
The swallowed seeds of arrogance  
Breeding in the thoughts of ten  
Thousand fools that fight irrelevance  
  
The full moon is dead skin  
The one down heres wearing thin  
So set up the ten pins  
As the human tide rolls in  
Like a ball thats spinning  
  
Bombs dropping down  
Overhead underground  
Its instilled to want to live  
  
Bombs dropping down  
Please forgive our hometown  
In our insignificance  
  
Turn the jukebox up he said  
Dancing in irreverence  
Play V3 let the song protest  
  
The plates began to shift  
Perfect lefts come rolling in  
I was alone and far away hey  
When I heard the band start playing  
On the lip late take off  
  
Bombs dropping down  
Overhead underground  
Its instilled to want to live  
  
Bombs dropping down  
Please forgive our hometown  
In our insignificance  
  
Feel like resonance of distance  
In the blood the iron lies  
  
Its instilled to want to live  
  
Bombs dropping down  
Please forgive our hometown  
In our insignificance  
Oh in our insignificance oh
