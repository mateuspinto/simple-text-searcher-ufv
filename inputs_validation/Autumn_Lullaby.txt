The sun has gone from the shining skies  
Bye baby bye  
The dandelions have closed their eyes  
Bye baby bye  
The stars are lighting their lamps to see  
If babes and squirrels and birds and bees  
Are sound asleep as they should be  
Bye baby bye  
  
The squirrel keeps warm in his furs of gray  
Bye baby bye  
Neath feathers birdies are tucked away  
Bye baby bye  
In yellow jackets the bees sleep tight  
And cuddle close through the chilly night  
My babys snug in her gown of white  
Bye baby bye  
  
The squirrel nests in a big oak tree  
Bye baby bye  
He finds a hole in the trunk you see  
Bye baby bye  
The robins home is a nest oerhead  
The bees they nest in a hive instead  
My babys nest is her little bed  
Bye baby bye
