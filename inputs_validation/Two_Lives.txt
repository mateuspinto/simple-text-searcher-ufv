Maybe Im a dreamer  
Maybe just a fool  
Lately I can hardly see the sun  
If you had a secret I could take a guess  
Nothin in your eyes seems to hold me  
Truth or consequences  
Which one will it be  
  
Someone said that time would ease the pain  
Of two lives love has torn apart  
But I believe whoever wrote that song  
Never had a broken heart  
  
One of us is hiding  
One of us can tell  
Cause no one likes to be the first to know  
Someone has to answer  
Cause someone has to ask  
Keeping on like this is torture  
And going undecided is twice as bad for sure  
  
Someone said that time would ease the pain  
Of two lives love has torn apart  
But I believe whoever wrote that song  
Never had a broken heart
