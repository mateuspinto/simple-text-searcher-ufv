Just as you take my hand  
Just as you write my number down  
Just as the drinks arrive  
Just as they play your favorite song  
As your bad day disappears  
No longer wound up like a spring  
Before youve had too much  
Come back and focus again  
  
The walls are bending shape  
You got a Cheshire cat grin  
All blurring into one  
This place is on a mission  
Before the night owl  
Before the animal noises  
Closed circuit cameras  
Before you comatose  
  
Before you run away from me  
Before youre lost between the notes  
The beat goes round and round  
The beat goes round and round  
I never really got there  
I just pretended that I had  
Words are blunt instruments  
Words are a sawn off shotguns  
  
Come on and let it out  
Come on and let it out  
Come on and let it out  
Come on and let it out  
  
Before you run away from me  
Before youre lost between the notes  
Just as you take the mike  
Just as you dance dance dance  
  
Jigsaws falling into place  
There is nothing to explain  
You eye each other as you pass  
She looks back and you look back  
Not just once  
Not just twice  
Wish away your nightmare  
Wish away your nightmare  
You got the light you can feel it on your back  
You got the light you can feel it on your back  
Jigsaws falling into place you just got paid
