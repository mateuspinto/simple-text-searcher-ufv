High class Slim came floatin in  
Down from the county line  
Just gettin right on Saturday night  
Ridin with some friends of mine  
They invited me just to come and see  
Just what was on their minds  
And then I took my first long look  
At the Master of Sparks on high  
  
In the back of Jimmys Mack  
Stood a round steel cage  
Welded into shape by Slim  
Made out of sucker gauge  
How fine they cried now with you inside  
Strapped in there safe and sound  
I thought myomy how the sparks will fly  
If that thing ever hit the ground  
  
Slim was so pleased when I had eased  
Into his trap of death  
He had slammed the door but I said no more  
And I thought Id breathed my last breath  
We was out in the sticks down Highway Six  
And the crowd was just about right  
The speed was too so out I flew  
Like a stick of rollin dynamite  
  
When I hit the ground you could hear the sound  
And see the sparks a country mile  
End over end I began to spin  
But the ball started runnin wild  
But it was too late as I met my fate  
And the ball started gettin hot  
But through the sparks and the flame I knew that the claim  
Of the Master of Sparks was gone
