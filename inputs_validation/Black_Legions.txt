High on a ridge where the darklord stands sending black legions to crush the
lands  
Captures of hades transporting the crown into the pit of this unholy row  
Do it all alone down into Belials home live then die Satan calls his evil
child  
Strengthens his force as the darkness falls laughs at the angels their feeble
calls  
High on their fortress that crumbles before all that in touch with the dark
evil law  
Do it all alone down into Belials home strike the final chord hail unto the
overlord  
High on a ridge where the darklord stands sending black legions to crush the
lands  
Captures of hades transporting the crown ever further ever down into the pits
of hell  
Now in the bleakness the elders recant thinking of histories the ancients
relent  
Gathered in circles before their host theres no one soul he desires most  
Do it all alone way down into Belials home strike a chord hail unto the
overlord
