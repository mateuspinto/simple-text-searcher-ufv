Walkin down this lonely stretch of beach  
She and I walked down a thousand times  
I just cant force myself to give her up  
Like all the things she left behind  
Gone are the days when Id wake up  
With her warm body next to mine  
  
It gets cold here in the wintertime  
And my mind drifts away  
To that house across the bay  
A long talk and a glass of wine  
And wed love the night away  
But that was yesterday  
In that house across the bay  
  
Her laughter was contagious  
Her walk her talk her smile lit up every room  
They say things happen for a reason  
But I cant find one good reason  
Why shes gone so soon  
Life just seems to hang  
On every thought and everything  
We used to be  
  
It gets cold here in the wintertime  
And my mind drifts away  
To that house across the bay  
A long talk and a glass of wine  
And wed love the night away  
But that was yesterday  
In that house across the bay  
  
There was sunshine everyday  
And wed love the night away  
In that house across the bay
