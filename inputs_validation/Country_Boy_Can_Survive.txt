The preacher man says its the end of time  
The Mississippi river shes goin dry  
The interest is up and the stock markets down  
You only get mugged if you go down town  
  
I live back in the woods you see  
My woman my kids and my dogs and me  
I got a shoutgun and a rifle and a 4 wheel drive  
A Country boy can survive  
  
And a Country boy can survive  
See I can plow a field all day long  
I can catch catfish from dusk till dawn  
We make our own whisky and our own smoke too  
  
Aint too many things these ole boys cant do no  
We grow good ole tomatoes make homemade wine  
A Country boy can survive  
And a Country boy can survive  
  
Cause you cant starve us out cant make me run  
Hey there boy I got a big shotgun  
We say grace and we say Mam  
If you aint into that we dont give a God damn  
  
I had a good friend in NY city  
He never called me Kid Rock he called me hillbilly  
My grandpa taught me how to live off this land  
His taught him to be a businessman  
  
He used to send me pictures of the broadway night  
Id send him some of that homemade wine  
But he was killed by a man with a switchblade knife  
For 43 dollars my friend lost his life  
  
I want to spit some beachnut in the dudes eyes  
Shoot him with my mother fuckin 45  
A country boy can survive  
Cause you cant starve us out cant make us run  
  
Hey there boy I got a big shotgun  
We say grace and we say Mam  
If you aint into that we dont give a God damn  
Were from North California and South Alabam  
  
And little towns all around this land  
Well I can skin a buck and run a trout line  
A Country boy can survive  
Well a Country boy can survive  
  
Survive
