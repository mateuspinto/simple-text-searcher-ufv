It takes so long to say goodbye  
Goodbye is a long long time  
Tonight my love the moonbeams shine  
Upon your dream and mine  
So take my kiss to sleep with you  
This kiss of love divine  
Oh it takes so long to say goodbye  
Goodbye is a long long time  
So take my kiss to sleep with you  
This kiss of love divine  
Oh it takes so long to say goodbye  
Goodbye is a long long time  
Goodbye is a long long time
