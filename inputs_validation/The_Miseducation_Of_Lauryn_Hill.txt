My world it moves so fast today  
The past it seems so far away  
And life squeezes so tight that I cant breathe  
And every time I try to be what someone else has thought of me  
So caught up I wasnt able to achieve  
  
But deep in my heart the answer it was in me  
And I made up my mind to define my own destiny  
  
I look at my environment  
And wonder where the fire went  
What happened to everything we used to be  
I hear so many cry for help  
Searching outside of themselves  
Now I know his strength is within me  
  
And deep in my heart the answer it was in me  
And I made up my mind to define my own destiny  
  
And deep in my heart  
And deep in my heart the answer it was in me  
And I made up my mind to define my own destiny
