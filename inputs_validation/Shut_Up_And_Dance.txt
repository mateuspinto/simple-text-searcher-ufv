Oh dont you dare look back  
Just keep your eyes on me  
I said your holding back  
She said shut up and dance with me  
This woman is my destiny  
She said oh oh oh  
Shut up and dance with me  
  
We were victims of the night  
The chemical physical kryptonite  
Helpless to the bass and faded light  
Oh we were born to get together  
Born to get together  
  
She took my arm  
I dont know how it happened  
We took the floor and she said  
  
Oh dont you dare look back  
Just keep your eyes on me  
I said your holding back  
She said shut up and dance with me  
This woman is my destiny  
She said oh oh oh  
Shut up and dance with me  
  
A backless dress and some beat up sneaks  
My discotheque Juliet teenage dream  
I felt it in my chest as she looked at me  
I knew we were born to be together  
Born to be together  
  
She took my arm  
I dont know how it happened  
We took the floor and she said  
  
Oh dont you dare look back  
Just keep your eyes on me  
I said your holding back  
She said shut up and dance with me  
This woman is my destiny  
She said oh oh oh  
Shut up and dance with me  
  
Deep in her eyes  
I think I see the future  
I realize this is my last chance  
  
She took my arm  
I dont know how it happened  
We took the floor and she said  
  
Oh dont you dare look back  
Just keep your eyes on me  
I said your holding back  
She said shut up and dance with me  
This woman is my destiny  
She said oh oh oh  
Shut up and dance  
  
Oh dont you dare look back  
Just keep your eyes on me  
I said your holding back  
She said shut up and dance with me  
This woman is my destiny  
She said oh oh oh  
Shut up and dance with me  
  
Oh oh oh shut up dance with me  
Oh oh oh shut up dance with me
