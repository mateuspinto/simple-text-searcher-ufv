I I who have nothing  
I I who have no one  
Adore you and want you so  
Im just a no one  
With nothing to give you but Oh  
I Love You  
  
He He buys you diamonds  
Bright sparkling diamonds  
But believe me dear when I say  
That he can give you the world  
But hell never love you the way  
I Love You  
  
He can take you anyplace he wants  
To fancy clubs and restaurants  
But I can only watch you with  
My nose pressed up against the window pane  
  
I I who have nothing  
I I who have no one  
Must watch you go dancing by  
Wrapped in the arms of somebody else  
When darling its I  
Who Loves you  
  
I Love You  
I Love You  
  
I Looove Yoooou
