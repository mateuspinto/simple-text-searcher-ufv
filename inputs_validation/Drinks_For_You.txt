This is for my singles ladies and single mothers  
Raising babies working hard  
I know the feeling I used to live it  
My mother worked 2 to 3 jobs  
Thats what this song is dedicated  
To all the women out there motivated  
Always finding ways to make ends meet  
All my women out there innovative  
You name the game and theyve played it  
Theyve heard all the stories so save it  
All my women with power meet me at happy hour  
Lets celebrate
