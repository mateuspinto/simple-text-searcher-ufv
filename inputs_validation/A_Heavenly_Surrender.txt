I make you a prayer a heavenly surrender  
To the one somewhere out there  
The one who can mend her  
I pray for the one who can open my door  
Let me go through it  
Oh yes give me more  
A prayer for the lover the willing intender  
To break down the girl a heavenly surrender  
I crave your violence act it upon me  
Set me free by your weighted autonomy  
I am so human so small so debased  
Jealously and darkness rule over this place  
A prayer for the lover the willing intender  
To break down the girl a heavenly surrender  
Im a lover of freedom but I cling to the dust  
Im blown by the wind Im a slave I am lust  
Please rub my face in the shit that I sleep in  
Tie me and bind me up for your keeping  
I make you a prayer a heavenly surrender  
To the one somewhere out there  
The one who can mend her
