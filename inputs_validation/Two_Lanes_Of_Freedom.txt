Two hearts two bucket seats too much sun not to wear shades  
Boot to the pedal and pedal to the metal were the reason this road was paved
yeah  
Now honey how fast you wanna go NASCAR driving Miss Daisy  
Radio loud radio low or I can sing if you want me to baby  
I can tell Gods smiling down I just get that feeling  
You and me going town to town on two lanes of freedom  
  
Oh no red lights or stop signs around for miles  
Just swaying trees your hair in the breeze and that smile and I know  
God made old country roads for driving and dreaming  
Mines coming true girl here with you on two lanes of freedom  
Two lanes of freedom  
  
Bottle of wine and a cheap motel door 12 feet from the road  
Watch the sunset holding hands and talk about where were gonna go  
So where you wanna go Where you wanna go  
Where you wanna go Where you wanna go  
Where you wanna go Where you wanna go  
Where you wanna go Where you wanna go  
  
Babe theres no red lights or stop signs around for miles  
Just swaying trees your hair in the breeze and that smile and I know  
Gods working down from that sky blue ceiling  
He made these old country roads for driving and dreaming  
Mines coming true girl here with you on two lanes of freedom  
Two lanes of freedom  
Two lanes of freedom  
Two lanes of freedom  
  
Two lanes of freedom  
Two lanes of freedom  
Two lanes of freedom  
Two lanes of freedom  
Two lanes of freedom
