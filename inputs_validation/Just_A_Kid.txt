Well the news spread through Jerusalem tonight a child is born  
There are shepherds fallin to their knees and Angels blowin horns  
But in their golden halls the Pharasees  
Scoffed and drank their wine  
They said its only Hebrew prophesy  
We dont care and besides He just a kid  
Thats all He is  
One more pebble in the gravel  
One more rumor in the ravel  
How can He be king  
Hes just a kid  
  
Well in no time He seen the world was knockin on His door  
Performed miracles and wonders they had never see before  
Soon the Pharasees stopped laughin  
The silver sun was paid  
And near the end He knelt down in the garden and He prayed  
  
Im just a kid  
Thats all I am  
Ill need Your strength too see me through it  
If it is Your will Ill do it  
But how can I be king Im just a kid  
  
Now I think about the Baby and the Man at Christmas time  
Of mothers sons and fathers and children just like mine  
About the power in unselfishness love and sacrifice  
The Gift that we were given and the price  
  
And how the news spread through Jerusalem tonight a child is born  
There are shepherds fallin to their knees and angels blowin horns  
I wonder how on Earth the Pharasees could scoff and drink their wine  
And say Hes only Hebrew prophesy  
We dont care and besides Hes just a kid  
Thats all He is  
One more pebble in the gravel  
One more rumor in the ravel  
And how can He be king Hes just a kid  
  
Oh how can He be king  
Hes just a kid  
Ooh
