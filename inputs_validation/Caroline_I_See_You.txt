Caroline I see you  
Standing on the stairway  
Waiting for your bear there  
Handy on the landing  
Penny in my pocket  
High enough to hold you  
  
When I come back home  
To you tomorrow  
You may well be angry  
Ill for sure be hungry  
Meet me in the middle  
Make it melt like chocolate  
Be my little baby  
  
I take you down by the water  
Some December morning  
Take you from your family  
Leave them with their longing  
Take you by your hand  
Somewhere on the sand  
  
Caroline I love you  
Though Im late to say so  
Hesitate to tell you  
What will be your answer  
Some December morning  
Standing on the stairway  
Caroline I see you
