Endure the pain  
You know my name  
I am your soul insane  
  
I am no one  
No one who cares  
I am your soul despair  
  
Your fear deceives  
Vulnerability  
Leaving an easy prey  
  
Consume your mind  
A power so divine  
Will take you and rape you blind  
  
Gemini master of demise  
Your death is my salvation  
To a kingdom mine  
My lord is my light  
The master of darkness  
Your death is my salvation  
To a kingdom mine  
  
You look at me with eyes of fate  
And see the graphic truth  
  
Your ignorance cannot shield you  
From your naked abuse  
Numbing of your moral sense  
Facing reality  
That life is unconditional  
And death is only the beginning  
  
The pain will never end  
  
Walking slow breathing heavy  
You could see death sweat  
How it shined  
An argument out of control in my mind  
  
I am here for the sole purpose of your death  
Walking slow breathing heavy  
You can see death sweat  
  
I am here for the sole purpose of death  
Look into my eyes and see the revelation of your demise  
Feel the pain that stares at the center of your heart  
Reflections of my soul  
Reflections of the dark
