You can hear hear it comin  
Like a train out of control  
Surely leaves you wonderin  
Exactly where your ticket goes  
Scream at the conductor  
Hes been deaf for twenty years  
Hear the other people laughin  
As he grinds through every gear  
  
You go to grab your nerve you find that its been missin  
Seems youve lost your faith in everyone you know  
Well I surely hope that you dont plan on winnin  
Better start payin more attention to the ones that throw you clear  
You are seconds from the impact but youre movin way too slow  
  
You say time will surely mold you  
Into something you dont like  
Now youre runnin like a rabbit  
Stick your finger in the dike  
  
Look around your room you find the paint is peelin  
Your reflective skin is fallin off your bones  
Well I must admit I know just how youre feelin  
Must grab each others collar must rise out of the water  
Cause you know as well as I do that its no fun to die alone  
  
After all that Ive been through youre the only one that matters  
Climb to safety  
You never left me in the dark here on my own  
Climb to safety  
I can feel the water rising let me be your ladder  
Climb to safety  
I promise youll be dry and never be alone  
  
You tell me love has always scared you  
Like the things under your bed  
Baby we can walk on water  
Like some junkies swore they did  
  
You call me on the phone you say that it is crucial  
Stick your fingers in your ears til they explode  
Its just business and it rolls along as usual  
Must grab each others collar we must rise out of the water  
Cause you know as well as I do that its no fun to die alone  
  
After all that Ive been through youre the only one that matters  
Climb to safety  
You never left me in the dark here on my own  
Climb to safety  
I can feel the water rising let me be your ladder  
Climb to safety  
I promise youll be dry and never be alone  
  
After all that Ive been through youre the only one that matters  
Climb to safety  
You never left me in the dark here on my own  
Climb to safety  
I can feel the water rising let me be your ladder  
Climb to safety  
I promise youll be dry and never be alone  
  
Yeah climb to safety  
Ooh climb to safety safety  
Yeah  
Climb to safety
