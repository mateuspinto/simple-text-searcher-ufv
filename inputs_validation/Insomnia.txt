You done someone wrong  
Your karma has come  
To settle the score with you  
Youre sneaking youre crawling  
Into the ground  
Eyes open wide and blue  
  
Insomnia  
Closer but no closer  
Insomnia  
Closer but no closer  
  
The night you were laid  
You had it made  
When everyone fell into place  
Higher and higher  
Too fast to miss a beat  
Body and bones as well  
  
Insomnia  
Burning like a hell  
Insomnia  
  
Oh burning yes burning like a hell  
Where does it come from  
Where does it go  
Throwing over your sleep  
Walking and talking  
Dancing till dawn  
  
Insomnia  
Waiting to get you  
Insomnia  
Waiting to get you  
  
Waiting to waiting to get you inso  
Waiting to waiting to get you inso  
Dont let it dont let it inso  
Dont let it dont let it  
Dont let it get you
