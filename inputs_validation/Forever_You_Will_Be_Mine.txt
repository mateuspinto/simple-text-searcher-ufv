I am not the only one  
Who can see that you are beautiful  
But I am the only one  
Who can see you belong to me  
Making me feel so light  
Making me feel such powerful emotion  
Making my heart so light  
All the time  
Something in the air tonight  
Something in the air with powerful emotion  
Something in the air so right  
Feels so right  
Oo oo together in love  
Oo oo forever in love  
Oo oo together we are  
Forever you will be mine  
Filling my life with love  
Filling my life with powerful emotion  
Filling my life with love  
All the time  
I am not the only one  
Who can see that you are beautiful  
But I am the only one  
Who can see you belong to me  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Mmmm  
Oo oo together in love  
Oo oo forever in love  
Oo oo together we are  
Forever you will be mine  
Together we are  
Forever you will be mine  
I am not the only one  
Who can see that you are beautiful  
But I am the only one  
Who can see you belong to me  
Something in the air tonight  
Something in the air with powerful emotion  
Something in the air so right  
Feels so right  
Oo oo together in love  
Oo oo forever in love  
Oo oo together we are  
Forever you will be mine
