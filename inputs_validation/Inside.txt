Were all lost  
Were all found  
Were all the same  
Just one heart beats in us  
With different names  
Just one heart  
With different names  
  
Hold me inside you  
Cause I want to be inside you  
Inside you  
  
Take this hand  
Lift me up  
Into your sky  
Hold me here  
Its just you and me  
Cause you make me fly  
You make me fly  
  
Hold me inside you  
Cause I want to be inside you  
Inside you  
  
Were all lost  
Were all found  
Were all the same  
  
Hold me inside you  
Cause I want to be inside you inside you  
Hold me hold me hold me  
Inside you inside you  
Cause I hold me want to be hold me hold me  
Inside you inside you  
  
Oh inside you  
Oh inside you
