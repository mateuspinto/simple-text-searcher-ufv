I dont smoke I dont shoot smack  
But I got a spicy monkey ridin on my back  
Dont eat beignets too much sugar and dough  
But I will play for gumbo  
Yes I will play for gumbo  
  
It started at my Grandmas kitchen by the sea  
She warned me when she told me son the first ones free  
It hit me like a rock or some Taikwondo  
Cause I will play for gumbo  
Oh yea I will play for gumbo  
Chorus  
A piece of French bread  
With which to wipe my bowl  
Good for the body  
Good for the soul  
Its a little like religion  
And a lot like sex  
You should never know  
When youre gonna get it next  
At midnight in the quarter or noon in Thibadeaux  
I will play for gumbo  
Yes I will play for gumbo  
  
Im not talkin quesadillas or a dozen Krispy Kremes  
Or a pound of caviar thats a rich mans dream  
No banana split or fillet of pompano  
No I will play for gumbo  
Yeah I will play for gumbo  
Chorus  
Maybe its the sausage or those pretty pink shrimp  
Or that popcorn rice that makes me blow up like a blimp  
Maybe its that voodoo from Marie Leveaux  
But I will play for gumbo  
Yeah I will play for gumbo  
  
The sauce boss does his cookin on the stage  
Stirrin and a singing for his nightly wage  
Sweating and frettin from his head to his toe  
Playin and swayin with the gumbo  
Prayin and buffetin with the gumbo  
Chorus
