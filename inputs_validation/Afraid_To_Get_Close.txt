Watching the cat sleep on my pillows  
Afraid to get close to anyone and afraid not to  
The need of all creatures to be warmed and touched  
The girls who want dads  
  
I think the writing is eating up myself  
Preventing any togetherness with anyone  
Hurting and recycling people over and over again  
  
How much longer  
How many more  
I held her in my arms and I didnt want to realize  
She was putting her life in my hands
