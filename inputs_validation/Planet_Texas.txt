Planet Texas  
  
They rode like they was Rangers as they came out of the skies  
They had HighTech horses with beacons in their eyes  
My gun was cocked and ready when I looked into their face  
I seen they just werent just common buckaroos born of the human race  
No sir these Cowboys came from space  
Their shootin irons shot laser light and their spurs was anodized  
Bandanas caked with stardust and their jeans was pressurized  
Well he handed me a halter said Tighten up the girth  
But before I hit the saddle we were miles above the Earth  
And I mean MILES above the Earth  
Yippieayeaye  
I seen London Paris Budapest Kashmir and Tokyo  
And there aint no sight like a desert night looking down on Mexico  
To the Moons of Mars and Jupiter round Saturns rings we rode  
Past the frozen plains of Pluto where even the sunshines cold  
Man I do mean COLD  
Then our interstellar stallions sailed through the starless void  
There was nothing to miss in that emptiness not even a stray asteroid  
So we picked up the trail of a comet tail man you cant even DREAM that far  
And the galloping beat like the rhythm of an old catgut guitar  
Just the strummin of a distant star  
Yippieayeaye  
Well it could have lasted minutes or a hundred thousand years  
When they got me down I was safe and sound and it hadnt even popped my ears  
And they reared back on their broncos and they shot a bolt of light  
I knew they were the good guys yes sir you got it right  
Cause their cowboy hats was White  
So I asked em as they pulled their reins towards the settin sun  
I said Before you go Id like to know just where you boys come from  
Well they opened up a star chart and said right here where this X is  
Its the biggest place in Outer Space the planet known as Texas  
Yippieayeaye  
Yippieayeaye  
Yippieayeaye  
Yippieayeaye
