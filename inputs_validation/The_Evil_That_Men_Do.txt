Love is a razor and I walked the line on that silver blade  
Slept in the dust with his daughter  
Her eyes red with the slaughter of innocence  
And I will pray for her I will call her name out loud  
And I will bleed for her if I could only see her now  
Living on a razors edge balancing on a ledge  
Living on a razors edge balancing on a ledge  
Balancing on a ledge living on a razors edge  
Balancing on a ledge you know you know  
  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
  
Circle of fire my baptism of joy at an end it seems  
The seventh lamb slain the book of life opens before me  
And I will pray for you someday I may return  
Dont you cry for me beyond is where I learn  
  
Living on a razors edge balancing on a ledge  
Living on a razors edge you know you know  
  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
  
Living on a razors edge balancing on a ledge  
Living on a razors edge you know you know  
  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil the evil the evil that men do  
The evil the evil the evil that men do
