Eternal night encroaches  
Disaster speaks his name  
Ignite the fires of Hades  
A world engulfed in flame  
You burn  in hell  
Visions shared by the blind  
The chase heats up the danger  
Old dragons breath  
Inferno  Youre gonna crash and burn  
Inferno  Youre gonna burn in hell  
Blood eyes in burning fury  
Flesh peeling from the bone  
The Gods are judge and jury  
Inferno is their home  
You cry  You die  
As you head for the grave  
Welcome to purgatory  
Your soul is fried  
Eternal night encroaches  
Disaster speaks his name  
Ignite the fires of Hades  
A world engulfed in flame  
You burn  in hell  
Visions shared by the blind  
The chase heats up the danger  
Old dragons breath
