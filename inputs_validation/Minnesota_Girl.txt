Sittin on the hood of a camaro  
Walkin shooting stars across the earth  
Counting all the bites from the mosquitoes  
There goes my Minnesota girl  
Lazy days  
Gone without notice  
In a daze With faraway eyes  
Driving to a closed spot Wednesday afternoon  
There goes my Minnesota girl  
In a daze  
Go without notice  
Lazy days With faraway eyes  
Countin from the pieces we have been through  
Here comes my Minnesota girl  
There goes my Minnesota girl
