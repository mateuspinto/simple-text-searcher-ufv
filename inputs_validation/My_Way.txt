And now the end is near  
So I face the final curtain  
My friend Ill say it clear  
Ill state my case of which Im certain  
  
Ive lived a life thats full  
Ive traveled each and every highway  
And more much more than this  
I did it my way  
  
Regrets Ive had a few  
But then again too few to mention  
I did what I had to do  
And saw it through without exception  
  
I planned each charted course  
Each careful step along the byway  
Oh and more much more than this  
I did it my way  
  
Yes there were times Im sure you knew  
When I bit off more than I could chew  
But through it all when there was doubt  
I ate it up and spit it out  
I faced it all and I stood tall  
And did it my way  
  
Ive loved Ive laughed and cried  
Ive had my fails my share of losing  
And now as tears subside  
I find it all so amusing  
To think I did all that  
And may I say not in a shy way  
Oh no no not me  
I did it my way  
  
For what is a man what has he got  
If not himself then he has not  
To say the things he truly feels  
And not the words he would reveal  
The record shows I took the blows  
And did it my way
