I got a blue bird  
A blue bird on my shoulder  
I got a blue bird  
A blue bird on my shoulder  
  
I saw her standing  
Standing by the water  
She was naked  
Her hair in great disorder  
  
And I know why Im flying  
And the rest is lies  
  
I sent a warning  
A warning of disaster  
I sent a warning  
I warned of great disaster  
  
I sent that blue bird  
That blue bird down the water  
I sent that blue bird  
Floating down the water  
  
And I know that Im flying  
And the rest is lies  
  
And I know that Im flying  
And the rest is lies
