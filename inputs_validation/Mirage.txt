I am just a mirage  
Oh I am just a mirage  
When you look at me  
Through your crystal glass you will see  
That I am now your past  
But you give your love to me  
In your life I wasnt meant to be  
Oh I am just a mirage  
Oh I am just a mirage  
Just a mirage fading away like water  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
I am just a mirage  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
I am just a mirage  
I am just a mirage  
  
But until that day has come  
When you say Ill be your only one  
I will live the way its meant for me  
With ups and downs and mystery
