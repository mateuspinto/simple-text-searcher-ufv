By the light of the lamp I sit to typemy notes on tab at my side  
I dont see the sun much these days  
A fluorescent tan covers my hide  
How much impact shall I have this time  
My goal today is to read the deadline  
I write between the lines  
I deal with fantasy  
I report the facts  
Give them to me please  
  
Ham and egg salad on white bread keeps me company on nights like this  
A pack of metholated cigarettes keeps my air nice and thick  
When I write words flow like coins from a candy box  
Get out of my way  
Ive got something to say  
  
The pulse is beating louder now  
The cramps in my hands grow more intense with each  
Tik tik tap tap tap tap tap on the keys  
My social life is at an end so it seems to be  
Why dont I trample on your lawn today  
Ill take skies of blue turn over skies of grey  
I write between the lines  
I deal with fantasy  
I am the pressman  
Acknowledge me  
  
Mother always told me never stray too far from home  
The little lady said Boy youll never have to be alone  
Because  
You build with fountain pen  
You create the memory stain  
You are the pressman  
Stand up straight boy
