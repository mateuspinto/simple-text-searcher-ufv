I remember that first night we met  
Dancing to the sounds of clarinets  
Dancing cheek to cheek oh how sweet  
You and me and this fantasy  
Oh I remember our first night  
  
I remember how we carried on  
On and on until the light of dawn  
From the very start you stole my heart  
I knew right then we would never part  
Oh I remember that first night  
  
Remember that first night  
Remember that first night  
  
I saw your love light through the candles glow  
Champagne was flowing and so I let myself go  
And when the night was over we both looked around the room  
Remember darling chairs on the table and only me and you  
  
I remember how we carried on  
On and on until the light of dawn  
And from the very start you stole my heart  
I knew right then we would never part  
I remember that first night  
  
Remember that first night  
Remember that first night  
Remember that first night
