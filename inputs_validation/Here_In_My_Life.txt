have never walked on water  
Felt the waves beneath my feet  
But at Your word Lord  
Ill receive Your faith to walk on oceans deep  
  
And I remember how You found me  
In that very same place  
All my failings surely would have drowned me  
Still You made a way  
  
Chorus  
You are my freedom  
Jesus Youre the reason  
Im knelling again at your throne  
Where would I be without You  
Here in my life  
Here in my life  
  
You have said that all the heavens  
Sing for joy at one who finds the  
Way to freedom truth of Jesus  
Brought from death into this life  
  
And I remember how You saw me  
Through the eyes of Your grace  
And though the price was Your beloved for me  
Still You made a way  
  
Chorus x 2  
  
Chorus being sung in the background repeatedly
