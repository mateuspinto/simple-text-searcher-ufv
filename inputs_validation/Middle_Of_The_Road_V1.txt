Version one  
  
The middle of the road is trying to find me  
Im standing in the middle of life with my plans behind me  
Well I got A smile for everyone I meet  
As long as you dont try dragging my bay  
Or dropping the bomb on my street  
  
Now come on baby  
Get in the road  
Oh come on now  
In the middle of the road yeah  
  
In the middle of the road you see the darndest things  
Like fat guys driving round in jeeps through the city  
Wearing big diamond rings and silk suits  
Past corrugated tin shacks full up with kids  
Oh man I dont mean A hampstead nursery  
When you own A big chunk of the bloody third world  
The babies just come with the scenery  
  
Oh come on baby  
Get in the road  
Oh come on now  
In the middle of the road yeah  
  
One Two Three Four  
  
The middle of the road is no private culDeSac  
I cant get from the cab to the curb  
Without some little jerk on my back  
Dont harass me cant you tell  
Im going home Im tired as hell  
Im not the cat I used to be  
I got A kid Im thirtyThree  
  
Baby get in the road  
Come on now  
In the middle of the road  
Yeah
