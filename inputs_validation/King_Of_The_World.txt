Smoke and mirrors  
Its a house of cards  
Everybody has windows  
And big cigars  
  
The law of the jungle  
Is very new to some  
The animals are vicious and arrogant  
And they eat their young  
  
I used to work my job from 9 to 5  
I just survived  
  
I was the king of the world  
I had every thing thrown at me  
That the judge and jury could hurl  
I was the man of the hour  
I would claw and scratch my way up  
To the very top of the tower  
  
Helter skelter  
Its a den of thieves  
Sea of errors  
That a greedy man weaves  
  
A few really bad apples  
Always spoil the lot  
Rolling blackouts  
On everyones block  
  
I go to work and try to make ends meet  
My life is over  
  
I was the king of the world  
I had everything I needed  
I owned every type of girl  
I was the man of the hour  
I would claw and scratch my way  
Up to the very top of the tower  
  
I was the king of the world  
I had everything I needed  
I owned every type of girl  
I was the man of the hour  
I would claw and scratch my way  
Up to the very top of the tower
