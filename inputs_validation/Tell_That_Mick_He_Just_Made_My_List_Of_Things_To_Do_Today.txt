Light that smoke for giving up on me  
And one just cause theyll kill you sooner than my expectations  
To my favorite liar to my favorite scar  
I could have died with you  
I hope you choke on those words that kiss that bottle I confess  
Now ash youself out on the insides said I loved you but I lied  
  
Lets play this game called When you catch fire  
I wouldnt piss to put you out  
Stop burning bridges  
and drive off of them  
So I can forget about you  
  
So bury me in memory  
His smiles your rope  
Wrap it tight around your throat  
  
On the drive home  
Joke about the kid you used to see  
And his jealousy  
Breaking hearts has never looked so cool  
As when you wrap your car around a tree  
Your make up looks great next to his teeth  
  
Lets play this game called When you catch fire  
I wouldnt piss to put you out  
Stop burning bridges  
and drive off of them  
So I can forget about you  
  
So bury me in memory  
His smiles your rope  
Wrap it tight around your throat 2x  
  
So bury me in memory  
around your throat
