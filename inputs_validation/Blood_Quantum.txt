Youre standing in the blood quantum line  
With a pitcher in your hand  
Poured from your heart into your veins  
You said I am  
I am  
I am  
  
Now measure me  
Measure me  
Tell me where I stand  
Allocate my very soul  
Like you have my land  
  
Genocide  
Genocide  
  
Colonize you  
Christianize you  
Patronize you  
Advertise you  
We loved you genocide  
  
Regulate you  
Assimilate you  
Appropriate you  
We love to hate you  
  
Genocide  
you are a man without a face  
youre just a number on a page  
Genocide  
there you are a woman without a face  
well just erase you  
  
There you are a man without a face  
Youre just a number  
youre just a number on a page  
There you are a woman without a face  
Well just erase you  
  
Conscripted children  
Torn from truth  
To the boarding school station  
Force fed the foreign tongue of fire  
And a prison education  
Broken knowledge  
Pencil scarred  
Spit faced  
The scattered sage  
Wisdom deep within the rock  
the wisdom deep within the rock  
Outlives  
outlives the pretty lies upon the page  
  
Genocide  
how white the snowy graves  
How red the blood terrain  
Genocide  
still pulsing with your dreams  
Above that stubborn stain  
  
There you are a man without a face  
how white the snowy graves  
how red the blood terrain  
Red the blood terrain  
still pulsing with your dreams  
There you are a woman without a face  
above that stubborn stain  
Above that stubborn stain  
  
Genocide  
Genocide  
Genocide
