I want to see the blue sky  
I want to feel the breeze  
I want to hear the summer wind  
Singing in the trees  
I want to touch forever  
And drift into its soul  
Put my troubles in my right hand  
Hold them up  
And let them go  
  
Sweet summer day  
Talking about a sweet summer day  
Take your troubles and let them fly away  
Im talking about a sweet summer day  
  
So much time is wasted pulling the line  
For sure you are running faster  
But youre only running blind  
I want to touch forever  
I want to really know  
Put my troubles in my right hand  
Hold them up and let them go  
  
Sweet summer day  
Im talking about a sweet summer day  
Take your troubles and let them drift away  
Talking about a sweet summer day
