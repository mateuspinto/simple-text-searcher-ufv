Well if your from Texas its more or less a law  
Theres no love loss for Oklahoma especially in football  
Well partner its time for that ol myth to die  
I want you to see how they treated me in Enid last night  
  
I was feeling low in Fort Worth I had the heartbreak blues  
My sweet love had left me for some California dude  
To Sacramento that girl did go said she wont be back  
Well I never thought I could feel so good after I hurt so bad  
  
Yes I was greeted in Enid last night  
That old Oklahoma hospitality was really nice  
Cause my girl walked out in cowtown and left me high and dry  
But I was trapped down and loved on site  
Oh those sooner folks are alright  
I was greeted in Enid last night  
  
Now thie pretty Okcitybilly has really stole my heart  
And Ill take bets that her and Tex are never gonna part  
Well who would dream it here in Enid I would meet my wife  
And Oklahoma and Texas are gonna get along just fine  
  
Yes I was greeted in Enid last night  
That good old Oklahoma hospitality was really nice  
Yes my girl walked out in cowtown and she told me bye bye  
But I was trapped down and loved on site  
Oh those sooner folks are alright  
I was greeted in Enid last night  
  
I think I forgot my hat honey
