Come on turn it up madness  
Stalking the night feeding fast on my prey  
Draining the life till the dawn of the day  
Drinking and sucking the blood rushing sweet  
Half crazed with glory half crazed in the heat  
Blood lust  
Tearing the flesh of the weak and the child  
Sparing no one the meek and the mild  
I sink my fangs in your neck as you dream  
I am Count Cronos vampire supreme  
Blood lust  
Blood lust upon me Im biting the flesh  
Ill take away your God given breath  
Now I shall feast on your life giving blood  
Leave you to die on the land you once stood  
Blood lust
