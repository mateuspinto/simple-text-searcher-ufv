Oh love its a brittle madness I sing about it in all my sadness  
Its not falsified to say that I found god so inevitably well  
It still exists pale and fine I cant dismiss  
And I wont resist and if I die well at least I tried  
  
And we just lay awake in lust and rust in the rain  
And pour over everything we say we trust  
It happened again I listened in through hallways and thin doors  
Where the rivers unwind rust and in the rain endure  
The rust and the rain are sins  
And Im in like Flynn again  
  
So go on place your order now cause some other time is right around the clock  
You can stand in line it finally begins just around the clock  
You can have your pick if your stomach is sick whether you eat or not  
And there is just one thing that I never forgot  
  
And we just lay awake in lust and rust in the rain  
And pour over everything we say we trust  
It happened again I listened in through hallways and thin doors  
Where the rivers unwind rust and in the rain so easy  
These are the comforts that be  
  
You see well Im feeling lucky oh well maybe thats just me  
You should be proud of me oh hell if you could only see  
That were gonna grow on up to be ah yes  
We are thick as thieves  
  
Oh love its a brittle madness I sing about it in all my sadness  
Its not falsified to say that I found god  
Inevitably well it still exists pale and fine I cant dismiss  
And I wont resist and if I die well at least I tried  
  
And we just lay awake in lust and rust in the rain  
And pour over everything we say we trust  
It happened again I listened in through hallways and thin doors  
Where the rivers unwind and the rust and the rain endure  
the rust and the rain endure Im sure  
  
I am insofar to know the measure of love isnt loss  
Love will never ever be insofar to know the measure of love isnt loss  
Love will never ever be lost on me  
Love will never ever be lost on me
