I went to work for her that summer  
A teenage kid so far from home  
She was a lonely widow woman  
Hell bent to make it on her own  
We were a thousand miles from nowhere  
Wheat fields as far as I could see  
Both needing something from each other  
Not knowing yet what that might be  
Til she came to me one evening  
Hot cup of coffee and a smile  
In a dress that I was certain  
  
She hadnt worn in quite a while  
There was a difference in her laughter  
There was a softness in her eyes  
And on the air there was a hunger  
Even a boy could recognize  
She had a need to feel the thunder  
To chase the lightning from the sky  
To watch a storm with all its wonder  
Raging in her lovers eyes  
She had to ride the heat of passion  
Like a comet burning bright  
  
Rushing headlong in the wind  
Out where only dreams have been  
Burning both ends of the night  
That summer wind was all around me  
Nothing between us but the night  
When I told her that Id never  
She softly whispered Thats alright  
And then I watched her hands of leather  
Turn to velvet in a touch  
Theres never been another summer  
When I have ever learned so much  
  
She had a need to feel the thunder  
To chase the lightning from the sky  
To watch a storm with all its wonder  
Raging in her lovers eyes  
She had to ride the heat of passion  
Like a comet burning bright  
Rushing headlong in the wind  
Out where only dreams have been  
Burning both ends of the night  
I often think about that summer  
The sweat the moonlight and the lace  
  
And I have rarely held another  
When I havent seen her face  
And every time I pass a wheat field  
And watch it dancing with the wind  
Although I know it isnt real  
I swear inside I feel  
Her hungry arms again  
She had a need to feel the thunder  
To chase the lightning from the sky  
To watch a storm with all its wonder  
  
Raging in her lovers eyes  
She had to ride the heat of passion  
Like a comet burning bright  
Rushing headlong in the wind  
Out where only dreams have been  
Burning both ends of the night  
Rushing in long in the wind  
Out where only dreams have been  
Burnin both ends of the night
