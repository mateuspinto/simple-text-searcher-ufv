In your creation heaven did decree  
That in your arms sweet death should dwell  
Deep Silent Complete  
Black velvet sea  
  
The sirens are calling for me  
Saved my soul thinking This songs a lie  
Sand on the shore is so dry  
Deep Silent Complete  
  
Black velvet sea  
Brave day sinking in endless night  
The age will say This poet lies  
Heaven never touched earthly face  
  
The age will say This night was ours  
Blessed with the Deep  
The Silent the Complete
