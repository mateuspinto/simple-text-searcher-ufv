Chorus  
Life is a dance life is a dance  
Life is a dance life is a dance  
  
Everywhere coast to coast  
Around the land  
We all have one thing in common  
We all love to dance  
In and out of discos crazy lights  
Keep on movin all through the night  
  
Chorus  
  
Why dont you listen  
Listen to the groove  
I am sure enough sure youll find  
Just the rhythm the rhythm of your soul  
Dance to the music keepin steady time  
  
Chorus  
  
Dance to the music crazy lights  
Dance to the music on crazy lights  
Dance to the music crazy lights  
Dance
