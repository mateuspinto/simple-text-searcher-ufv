Tis a sad but true story  
From the bible it came  
And it tells us how Judas  
Sold the savior in shame  
He planned with the council  
Of high priest that day  
30 pieces of silver  
Was the price they would pay  
30 pieces of silver  
30 shackles of shame  
Was the price paid for Jesus  
On the cross he was slain  
Betrayed and forsaken  
Unloved and unclaimed  
In anger they pierced him  
But he died not in vein  
Twas on there on the hillside  
The multitude came  
And found our dear savoir  
Then took him away  
They bruised and mocked him  
Thorns was crowned around his head  
And his garment of purple  
Showed the blood stains of red  
Far off in the mountains with his face towards the sun  
Judas begged merci for what he had done  
He gave back the silver  
For his heart filled with strife  
Then there in the mountain he took his own life  
30 pieces of silver  
30 shackles of shame  
Was the price paid for Jesus  
On the cross he was slain
