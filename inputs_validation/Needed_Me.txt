Intro YG  
Mustard on the beat ho  
  
Verse 1  
I was good on my own thats the way it was thats the way it was  
You was good on the low for a faded fuck on some faded love  
Shit what the fuck you complaining for  
Feeling jaded huh  
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin to you  
Had some fun on the run though I give it to you  
  
PreChorus  
But baby dont get it twisted  
You was just another nigga on the hit list  
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch  
Didnt they tell you that I was a savage  
Fuck your white horse and a carriage  
Bet you never could imagine  
Never told you you could have it  
  
Chorus  
You needed me  
Oooh you needed me  
To feel a little more and give a little less  
Know you hate to confess  
But baby ooo you needed me  
  
Verse 2  
You been rollin around shit Im rollin up  
Light and roll it up  
Break it down like a pound shit was never us  
Shit was never us  
Thats the real on the real are you serious  
How you feel how you feel  
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin to ya  
Had some fun on the run though I give it to ya  
  
PreChorus  
But baby dont get it twisted  
You was just another nigga on the hit list  
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch  
Didnt they tell you that I was a savage  
Fuck your white horse and a carriage  
Bet you never could imagine  
Never told you you could have it  
  
Chorus  
You needed me  
Oooh you needed me  
To feel a little more and give a little less  
Know you hate to confess  
But baby ooo you needed me
