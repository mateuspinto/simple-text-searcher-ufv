This one goes out to that special someone in my life  
Oh we all have somebody special  
This is for you  
  
I like ice cream cherry pie  
And lemonade with summer breeze  
I like rainbows leafy trails  
And puppy dogs with bumble bees  
  
I like cotton candy gum  
And bumper cars and carnivals  
Golden skies and hazel eyes  
And sand inbetween my toes  
  
But something tells me that I hate you  
Something tells me I must kill you  
  
You aint shit but a slutty ass mother fucking slut you fuckin whore  
I fuckin hate you  
  
I like birthday candle cakes  
And titty shakes with silicone  
Secret whispers and  sister  
And apple dips gingerbread homes  
  
Faygo chills they give me thrills  
And NyQuil pills they make me sleep  
Hershey kisses and heppy misses is something so bliss but yet all the while  
  
Somethin tells me that I hate you  
Somethin tells me I must kill you  
  
Suck my fuckin dick fuck off  
go fuck yourself you fuckin ass little bitch  
  
Come on come on bitch come on come on come on come on bitch I fuckin hate
you  
Come on come on bitch come on come on  
  
I like shaggy hes my friend  
I like his mom cause shes nice to me  
Thank you J I like you too  
Well its OK were family  
  
Raver chicks and kung fu flicks  
And sugar sticks like lolly pop  
All these things happiness brings  
But my hatred for you dont stop bitch  
  
Something tells me that I hate you  
Something tells me I must kill you  
Something tells me that I hate you  
Something tells me I must kill you  
  
Bitch I fuckin hate you Ill fuckin kill you  
  
You selfish bitch
