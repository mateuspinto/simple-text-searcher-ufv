One rule for us for you another  
Do unto yourself as you see fit for yor brother  
  
Is that not within realm of understanding  
A fifty second capacity of mind too demanding  
  
Well the poor unfortunate you  
There are a myriad of things that you can do  
Like pick up a pen and paper  
or go and talk to a friend  
The history of the future  
No violence or revenge  
  
Your shame is never    ending  
Just one psychological drama after another  
You are guilty a  
nd how you ever entered into this life  
God only knows the infinite complexities of love  
  
We all have the ability  
Our freedom is fragile  
We all laugh and we cry dont we  
We all bleed and we smile  
  
Your shame is never    ending  
Just one psychological drama after another  
You are guilty  
and how you ever entered into this life  
God only knows  
youre not to sacrifice the art of love  
  
Your shame is never    ending  
Just one psychological drama after another  
We are guilty  
and how we ever entered into this life  
God only knows the infinite complexities of love  
  
We are guilty  
and how we ever entered into this life  
God only knows  
were not to sacrifice the art of love  
  
We are guilty  
and how we ever entered into this life  
God only knows the infinite complexities of love  
  
We are guilty  
and how we ever entered into this life  
God only knows the ultimate necessity of love
