Fall out  
Fall in  
Fall out  
Fall in  
Fall out  
Fall in  
  
Goodnight my love  
Goodbye the feeling of breathing you into my life  
I ran with the wind in my face  
I was proud  
I flew with my father when I was allowed  
I felt like a hero when I was with you  
Those days I felt God  
They were far They were few  
They were mine  
  
Goodnight my babies  
Goodbye the memories of showing my pride and my joy  
You are the angels  
A world spinning forward  
You are the reason Ill never need more  
I felt like a great man when I was with you  
Those days I felt honor  
They were far  
They were few  
They were mine  
  
Fall out  
Fall in  
Fall out  
Fall in  
  
Goodnight my friends  
Goodbye the dreams that all danced their way into my life  
The horse of forever  
We rode in our youth  
We walked into heaven through hell in these boots  
I feel a great love while Im here in your arms  
You were all brothers  
And fathers and sons  
You were mine  
  
Now I can finally see the light  
I can finally see you in the night  
  
Fall in  
Fall out  
Fall in  
Fall in  
  
I can finally see the light  
I can finally see you in the night  
I can finally see  
And I can finally see the light  
I can finally see you in this night
