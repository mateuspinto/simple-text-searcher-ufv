The sweet sound of patent approval comin down in a not quite fog  
The sweet sound of patent approval comin down in  
Powdery sparks the sweet sound of patent approval  
Comin down with holiday concern the sweet sound of patent approval  
Comin down in a world of hurt  
  
In my opinion the drug is ready  
  
The warm hand of abject approval comin down with its ropey veins  
The warm hand of abject approval comin down to the  
Fingerbowl  
  
In my opinion the drug is ready  
  
The cold eye of constant approval comin down to freeze the blood  
The cold eye of constant approval comin down to look real  
Close  
  
In my opinion the drug is ready
