On judgment day the moon lights the way  
And those with open eyes will see  
Hail the avenger midnight defender  
The end will never be  
  
You look to the light  
Dawn of a new day  
Hail the avenger  
He who lights the way  
  
Away with your fear Ive cried all my tears  
Delivered from the night  
Hail the avenger laughing at danger  
Shed blood bring life  
  
If you live by the sword  
You die by the sword  
All hail the avenger  
Accept our new lord  
  
The defeated lay lifeless in the pit  
His face reflects the horror of his victems in tenfold  
A death of deaths  
All evil fear his name  
  
Struck down by a man  
His severed limbs ooze oceans of our blood  
 man stands oh knee deep within  
Paused to scream this is not a sin  
  
I have done your will Ive delivered  
From this day forth known as the avenger  
  
Guarding the weak and those who seek  
Asylum from a world of wrong  
Hail the avenger midnight defender  
Silent bold and strong  
  
You echo our cry so ends war  
All hail the avenger  
Victory hour  
Ooo Victory ours  
  
Our vengeance recall those starting to fall  
Oh victory hour
