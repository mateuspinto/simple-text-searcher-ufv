Im gonna make you bend and break It sent you to me without wait  
Say a prayer but let the good times roll  
In case God doesnt show Let the good times roll let the good times roll  
  
And I want these words to make things right  
But its the wrongs that make the words come to life  
Who does he think he is  
If thats the worst you got better put your fingers back to the key  
  
Chorus  
One night and one more time  
Thanks for the memories even though they werent so great  
He tastes like you only sweeter  
One night yeah and one more time  
Thanks for the memories thanks for the memories  
See he tastes like you only sweeter oh  
  
Been looking forward to the future  
But my eyesight is going bad  
In these crystal balls  
Its always cloudy except for  
When you look into the past  
One night stand  
One night stand  
  
Chorus  
  
They say  
I only think in the form of crunching numbers  
In hotel rooms collecting page six lovers  
Get me out of my mind  
Get you out of those clothes  
Im a letter away  
From getting you into the mood  
Whoa  
  
Chorus  
  
One night one more time  
One night and one more time  
Thanks for the memories even though they werent so great  
He tastes like you only sweeter  
One night yeah and one more time  
One night one more time  
Thanks for the memories thanks for the memories  
For the memories for the memories  
See he tastes like you only sweeter
