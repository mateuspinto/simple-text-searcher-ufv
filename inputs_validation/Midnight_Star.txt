I was waiting in the express lane with my twelve items or less  
At the checkout counter at the local grocery store  
I was only passing by  
But a paper caught my eye  
And I learned a few things I never knew before  
  
It said your pet may be an extra terrestrial  
It said the ghost of Elvis is living in my den  
You can learn to cope with stress  
You can beat the IRS  
And the incredible frog boy is on the loose again  
  
Oh Midnight Star  
Its in the weekly Midnight Star  
Aliens from outer space are sleeping in my car  
Midnight Star I want to know I want to know  
  
Eat jelly donuts and lose twenty pounds a day  
Hear the story of the man born without a head  
And top psychics all agree  
That the telephone company  
Will have a brand new service that lets you talk to the dead  
  
Oh Midnight Star  
You can believe it if you read it in the weekly Midnight Star  
Theyre keeping Hitlers brain alive inside a jar  
Midnight Star I want to know I want to know  
  
Tell me tell me tell me how to make my bustline grow  
Midnight Star I want to know  
  
Oh Midnight Star  
Well dont you know that I read it I read it in the weekly Midnight Star  
The UFOs have landed and well tell you where they are  
Midnight Star I want to know I want to know  
  
Midnight Star  
Well you can read all about in in the weekly Midnight Star  
You can use you ESP to learn to play guitar  
Midnight Star I want to know I want to know  
  
Ah Midnight Star I want to know I want to know  
Ah Midnight Star I want to know I want to know  
Ah Midnight Star I want to know I want to know  
Ah Midnight Star Inquiring minds like mine want to know
