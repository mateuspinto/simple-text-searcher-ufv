Im dreaming tonight  
Of a place I love  
Even more than I usually do  
And although I know  
Its a long road back  
I promise you  
  
Ill be home for Christmas  
You can count on me  
Please have snow and mistletoe  
And presents under the tree  
Christmas Eve will find me  
Where the lovelight gleams  
Ill be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams  
  
Oh oh ah Ill be home for Christmas  
You can count on me  
Please have snow and mistletoe  
And presents under the tree  
Oh Christmas Eve will find me  
Where the lovelight gleams  
Ill be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams  
  
If only yeah  
Well now if only only only only  
If only in my dreams  
If only  
Well well well Lord  
If only oh  
If only in my dreams
