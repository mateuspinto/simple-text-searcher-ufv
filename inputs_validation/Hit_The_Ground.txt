Anesthetized by these lies  
I dont believe in truth  
And I apologize  
But my sacrifice  
Has nothing to do with you  
  
Cause Ive been victimized  
Like ocean size  
From the blood your needle drew  
And I apologize  
But my demise  
  
Has everything to do with you  
Settle up with the devil  
Close the basement door  
Full force on the shovel  
And unearth the floor  
You were there one day  
But youre here no more  
Like a stroke through the heart  
  
And you play the whore  
Cause you stole my soul  
Kleptomaniac  
Now I can hate myself take my anger back  
  
Love is a violent attack  
You cut me down  
I feel no pain now  
This nightmare is almost through  
  
I hit the ground  
No need to feel now  
My time here is all but done  
All but done  
Now Im up in the attic  
Where the rafters strong  
So many reasons to be tragic  
  
And the list is long  
If you think Ive lost hope  
You were never wrong  
Cause the churning of the rope  
Is my battle song  
  
Settle up with the devil  
Close the basement door  
Full force on the shovel  
And unearth the floor  
  
You were there one day  
But youre here no more  
Like a stake through the heart  
And you play the whore  
  
Cause you burned my soul  
Pyromaniac  
You can hate yourself take your anger back  
Love is a violent attack  
I cant stand on my own feet now  
  
I cant crawl forever and a day  
Felt like I was getting stronger  
Before you turned and walked away  
I apologize  
But my demise  
Has everything to do with you
