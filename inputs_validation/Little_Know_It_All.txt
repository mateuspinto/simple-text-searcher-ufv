feat Sum 41  
  
Im the kid that no one knows  
I live a life I never chose  
But these thoughts in my mind  
Are my own my own  
  
Im face to face with the unknown  
My scary movie will be shown  
Ive got one evil mind  
My own my own  
  
Chorus  
We take from one another  
And never stop to wonder how it feels from the other side  
But nothing lasts forever  
When stupid turnes to cleaver  
Why are you surprised  
Little know it all litle know it all  
Ten bucks in my hand  
Little know it all little know it all  
Dont cry I understand  
So  
  
Im a target although smart  
They got amunition I got heart  
Im analyized and tagged  
Before I start  
  
So tell me who can I respect  
I feel the leash around my neck  
As I find out the shame  
In the game in the game  
  
Chorus  
We take from one another  
And never stop to wonder how it feels from the other side  
But nothing lasts forever  
When stupid turnes to cleaver  
Why are you surprised  
  
And I feel like Ive crawled outside the box  
And I feel like Im sleeping when Im not  
  
Chorus  
We take from one another  
And never stop to wonder how it feels from the other side  
But nothing lasts forever  
When stupid turnes to cleaver  
Why are you surprised  
Little know it all litle know it all  
Ten bucks in my hand  
Little know it all little know it all  
Dont cry I understand  
You little know it all litle know it all  
Ten bucks in my hand  
Little know it all little know it all  
Dont cry I understand  
Youll never know it all
