She drew out all her money out of the Southern Trust  
And put her little boy aboard a Greyhound Bus  
Leaving Louisiana for the Golden West  
Down came the tears from her happiness  
Her own little son name o Johnny B Goode  
Was gonna made some motion pictures out in Hollywood  
Bye bye bye bye  
Bye bye bye bye  
Bye bye Johnny  
Good bye Johnny B Goode  
She remembered taking money out from the gathering crop  
And buying Johnnys guitar at a broker shop  
As long as he would play it by the railroad side  
And wouldnt get in trouble he was satisfied  
But never thought that there would come a day like this  
When she would have to give her son a goodbye kiss  
Going  
Bye bye bye bye  
Bye bye bye bye  
Bye bye Johnny  
Good bye Johnny B Goode  
She finally got the letter she was dreaming of  
Johnny wrote and told her he had felt in love  
As soon as he was married he would bring her back  
And build a mension for em by the railroad track  
So every time they heard the locomotive roar  
Theyd be a standin a wavin by the kitchen door  
Howling  
Bye bye bye bye  
Bye bye bye bye  
Bye bye Johnny  
Good bye Johnny B Goode
