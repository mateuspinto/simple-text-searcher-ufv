But the land was already claimed by a people  
When the cowboy came and when the soldiers came  
The story of the American Indian is in a lot of ways  
A story of tragedy like that day at Wounded Knee South Dakota  
Big Foot was an Indian chief  
Of the Minneconjou band  
A band of Minneconjou Sioux  
From South Dakota land  
Big Foot said to Custer  
Stay away from Crazy Horse  
But Custer crossed into Sioux land  
And he never came back across  
Then Big Foot led his people  
To a place called Wounded Knee  
And they found themselves surrounded  
By the 7th Cavalry  
Big chief Big Foot  
Rise up from your bed  
Minneconjou babies cry  
For their mothers lying dead  
Big Foot was down with a fever  
When he reached Wounded Knee  
And his people all were prisoners  
Of the 7th Cavalry  
Two hundred women and children  
And another hundred men  
Raised up a white flag of peace  
But peace did not begin  
An accidental gunshot  
And Big Foot was first to die  
And over the noise of the rifles  
You could hear the babies cry  
Big chief Big Foot  
Its good that you cant see  
Revenge is being wrought  
By Custers 7th Cavalry  
Then smoke hung over the canyon  
On that cold December day  
All was death and dying  
Around where Big Foot lay  
Farther on up the canyon  
Some had tried to run and hide  
But death showed no favorites  
Women men and children died  
One side called it a massacre  
The other a victory  
But the white flag is still waving  
Today at Wounded Knee  
Big chief Big Foot  
Your Minneconjou band  
Is more than remembered here  
In South Dakota land
