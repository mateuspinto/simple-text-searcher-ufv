When the season is turning  
And my day has gone by  
And to see my reflection  
See it in your eyes  
Know the day thats come now has gone by  
  
And if you look now quite closely  
You feel the sun start to shine  
And you know the day is longing  
Longing just for you  
The season thats come now is as fresh as you  
  
And if you look now quite closely  
You feel the sun start to shine  
And you know the day is longing  
Longing just for you  
The season thats come now is as fresh as you
