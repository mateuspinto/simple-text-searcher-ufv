Hmmmmmm  
You  
Need a love like mine  
That you can depend on  
When your whole worlds falling in  
When you need a friend  
You can depend on me  
You can depend on me  
  
Ill be by your side  
When you need me  
When the whole world seems unfair  
When no one seems to care  
You can depend on me  
You can depend on me  
  
When life seems not worth living  
And nothing seems to be going right  
The comfort my love will be giving giving  
Will change your darkness to light  
  
I I I I  
Ill be by your side  
When you need me  
When the whole seems unfair  
When no one seems to care  
You can depend depend on  
Yeah yeah  
You can depend on me
