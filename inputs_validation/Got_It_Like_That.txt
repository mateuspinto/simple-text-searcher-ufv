Dreams of money and a double bag of diamonds  
Get it like that I got it like that  
Plenty bank rolls but I still look back  
Same old flow with a lot more stacks  
Big body cadillacs million dollar contracts  
The cribs the cars the jewelry  
Exotic brauds they killin me thick and all alicia keys  
Still get involved with the project freaks  
One phone call they becomin in a fleet

Just like off a ball in the club with that green
