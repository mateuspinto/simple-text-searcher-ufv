A day once dawned  
And it was beautiful  
A day once dawned from the ground  
Then the night she fell  
And the air was beautiful  
The night she fell all around  
  
So look see the days  
The endless coloured ways  
And go play the game that you learnt  
From the morning  
  
And now we rise  
And we are everywhere  
And now we rise from the ground  
And see she flies  
And she is everywhere  
See she flies all around  
  
So look see the sights  
The endless summer nights  
And go play the game that you learnt  
  
From the morning
