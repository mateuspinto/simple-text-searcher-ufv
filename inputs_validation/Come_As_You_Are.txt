Come as you are as you were as I want you to be  
As a friend as a friend as an old enemy  
Take your time hurry up the choice is yours dont be late  
Take a rest as a friend as an old memoria  
Memoria memoria memoria memoria  
  
Come doused in mud soaked in bleach as I want you to be  
As a trend as a friend as an old memoria memoria memoria  
  
And I swear that I dont have a gun  
No I dont have a gun  
No I dont have a gun  
Memoria memoria memoria memoria  
  
And I swear that I dont have a gun  
No I dont have a gun  
No I dont have a gun  
No I dont have a gun  
No I dont have a gun
