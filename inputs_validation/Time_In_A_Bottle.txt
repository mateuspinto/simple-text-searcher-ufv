If I could save time in a bottle  
The first thing that Id like to do  
Is to save every day  
Til eternity passes away  
Just to spend them with you  
  
If I could make days last forever  
If words could make wishes come true  
Id save every day like a treasure and then  
Again I would spend them with you  
  
Chorus  
But there never seems to be enough time  
To do the things you want to do  
Once you find them  
Ive looked around enough to know  
That youre the one I want to go  
Through time with  
  
If I had a box just for wishes  
And dreams that had never come true  
The box would be empty  
Except for the memory  
Of how they were answered by you  
  
Chorus
