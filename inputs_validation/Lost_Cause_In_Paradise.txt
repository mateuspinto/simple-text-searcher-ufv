They were fair and they were blond  
Laughing loud and singing songs  
Hoping for the best in life  
Heading for a paradise  
In the flash of an eye was born  
What would grow to become a storm  
When the fountain of youth was sprung  
Lost and gone everyone  
In the man is the child alive  
To know and feel how to survive  
But the world was as cold as ice  
When they looked for paradise  
Love in hand the first to fight  
The golden dawn was a nasty sight  
The world turns as cold as ice  
Lost cause in paradise  
They were fair and they were blond  
Laughing loud and singing songs  
Bit the world was as cold as ice  
Lost cause in paradise
