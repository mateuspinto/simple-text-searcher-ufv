My shattered dreams and broken heart are mending on the shelf  
I saw you holding hands standing close to someone else  
Still I sit all alone wishing all my feelings were gone  
I gave my best to you nothing for me to do  
  
Chorus  
But have one last cry one last cry Before I leave it all behind I got to
put you out of my mind this time believe a lie I guess Im down to my last
cry  
  
I was here you were there guess we never could agree  
While the sun shines on you I need some love to rain on me  
Still I sit all alone wishing all my feelings were gone  
Gotta get over you nothing for me to do  
  
Chorus  
But have one last cry one last cry before I leave it all behind I got to
put you out of my mind this time believe a lie I know Ive gotta be strong
cause round me life goes on and on and on and on Ohh  
  
Im gonna dry my eyes right after I get my  
  
Chorus  
One last cry one last cry before I leave it all behind I got to put you out
of my mind for the very last time believe a lie I guess Im down I guess
Im down I guess Im down to my last cry
