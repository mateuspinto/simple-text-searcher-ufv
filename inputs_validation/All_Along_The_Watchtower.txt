Bob Dylan   
  
There must be some kind of way out of here  
Said the joker to the thief  
Theres too much confusion  
I cant get no relief  
Business men they  
They drink my wine  
Plowmen dig my earth  
No one will ever on the mine  
Nobody of it is worth  
  
No reason to get excited  
The thief he kindly fool  
There are many here among us  
Who feel that life is but a joke  
But you and I weve been through that  
And this is not our fate  
So let us talk falsely now  
The hours getting late  
Yeah  
  
All along the watchtower  
The princess kept the view  
While all the women came and went  
Bare feet servants too  
Outside in the cold distance  
A wild cat did growl  
Two riders were aproaching now  
And the wind began to howl  
  
Yeah  
All along the watchtower  
Yeah  
All along the watchtower  
Oh come on
