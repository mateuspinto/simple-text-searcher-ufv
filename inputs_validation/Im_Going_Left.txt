Chorus  
Well Im goin left  
Til you lead me to the right  
Lead me to what is right  
Im goin left  
Til you lead me to the right  
Lead me to what is right  
  
Theres a train people say  
I could ride to get my whole life straight  
But the bridge on the way  
Has a toll too much for me to pay  
Yes I know it must be  
What I chose could mean my destiny  
Lights are green all is go  
But my heart keeps telling my mind no  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres a plane over there  
Where all are given even share  
What you get is so small  
Its like never having nothing at all  
Take my hand says a friend  
A will stick with you until the end  
But Im in doubt I must decline  
Cause even friends can change their lines  
  
Chorus
