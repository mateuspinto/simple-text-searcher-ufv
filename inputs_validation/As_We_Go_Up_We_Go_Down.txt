I cant terrorize I see terror in your eyes  
As we go up we go down  
I cant socialize Ill be institutionalized  
As we go up we go down  
  
And see the truth yeah is just a lie oh  
And see the truth yeah is just a lie oh  
  
I speak in monotone Leave my fucking life alone  
As we go up we go down  
As we go up we go down And see the truth yeah  
As we go up we go down Is just a lie  
As we go up we go down And see the truth yeah  
As we go up we go down Is just a lie  
As we go up we go down And see the truth yeah  
As we go up we go down Is just a lie  
As we go up we go down And see the truth yeah
