Draggin old Mustang 69  
Top dropped back an lookin fine  
Workin the groove backin up with Scotch  
Lookin like Sir Lancelot  
What it is brother  
What it is kid  
Rock it like a mother  
What it is  
Lookin to sway by the evenin shade  
But I aint ready to behave  
An that aint bad on the other hand  
Detroit rocks like the Rio Grande  
What it is brother  
What it is kid  
Rock it like a mother  
What it is  
What it is What it is  
What it is What it is  
What it is What it is
