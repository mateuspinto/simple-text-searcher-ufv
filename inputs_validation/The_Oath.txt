Burning embers of the second death will come in the night  
Priests and kings the alpha and omega poison bites  
False prophets and deceivers swing from the trees  
Now dawn the age of birds  
Drunk with blood like lepers with disease  
Lord of the sky Mercury the guide  
Lord of the underworld I swear the sacred right  
I will crucify slay them with their tribe  
Hear my war cry  
  
Theyll find no sanctuary hidden in their ancestral halls  
Let loose the knot that binds the spirit and flesh  
Let it fall  
For only courage and heroism linger after death  
So hold fast thy sword rejecting pain feel the dragons  
Breath  
  
Ive sworn the oath
