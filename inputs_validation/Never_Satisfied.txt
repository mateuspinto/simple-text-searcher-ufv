Where do we go from here  
There must be something near  
Changing you changing me forever  
Places changes faces change  
Life is so very strange  
Changing time changing rhyme together  
Theres no where else to go  
This could be our last show  
Changing dreams changing schemes never  
We are never satisfied  
Love is gone along with fun  
Now were reaching for the gun  
Changing cast changing fast no more tether  
We are never satisfied
