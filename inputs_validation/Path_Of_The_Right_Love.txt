Love love love love love  
Say the word so very losely  
Where we come from is love love pure love  
And were on our way back home  
  
And on that way you never look back  
Cause theres nothing there to see  
Just look around you  
Theres always someone thats in need  
  
Of Maybe just kindness  
As we watch each other bleed  
From wounds we choose  
We never lose  
  
Love love love love love  
Misunderstood yet so desired  
We pay the cost for love love real love  
But we get back so much more so much more  
  
So many questions  
Beginning to unfold  
I look for the answers  
In the middle of my soul  
  
I know youre out there  
And its not like Ive been told  
So I run to you  
I run to you  
  
To find the path of the right love  
Oh yeah the path of the right love  
Were on the path of the one love  
Oh yeah the path of the right love  
  
Love love love love love  
All around yet so elusive  
If we dont reach out for love love this love  
Were all just wasting time precious time  
  
When in the long run  
Whats meant to be will be  
Those things we ask for  
Become our destiny  
  
But while were living  
Our souls can not be free  
Eventually we will come to see  
To find the path of the right love right love right love  
  
Oh yeah the path of the right love  
Were on the path of the one love yeah yeah  
Oh yeah the path of the right love  
And that love love love true love  
  
Must surely be good must surely be kind  
And that love sweet love strong love  
Is meant to be yours is meant to be mine  
And I do believe if we share this life  
  
We must learn to share all its pain and strife  
To find the path of the right love  
Oh yeah the path of the right love  
Were on the path of the one love  
  
Oh yeah the path of the right love  
To find the path of the right love  
Oh yeah the path of the right love  
Were on the path of the one love  
  
Oh yeah the path of the right love  
Aspire to your inevitable bliss  
And every grace will be given you
