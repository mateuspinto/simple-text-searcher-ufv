What you gonna do if the fashion changes  
Have you got a good song can you go on  
Will you be so strong you can rearrange it  
Will you still have the thought to rely on  
Will you cut your hair do you dye it yellow  
Are you still the right flavor to be tasted  
Will you have your name in the sunday papers  
Do you tell them you are straight or get wasted  
Do you think about it do you think about it  
Do you think about it Ill bet you do  
Do you think about it do you think about it  
Do you think about it Ill bet you do  
Did you ever think when you picked the front line  
Are you gonna back up on your promises  
Did you tell the folks you could make the changes  
Are you gonna play it different than the last one  
You got the address and you got the power  
Are you gonna use it right or abuse it  
Taking all the trust that you know youre given  
Are you gonna play the game or just lose it  
Do you think about it do you think about it  
Do you think about it Ill bet you do  
Do you think about it do you think about it  
Do you think about it Ill bet you do  
Do you think about it do you think about it  
Do you think about it Ill bet you do  
Do you have the looks  
Do you have the profile  
Do you have your fingerprints or a record  
If they come to you for some information  
Looking for a secret would you sell one  
Do you think about it do you think about it  
Do you think about it Ill bet you do  
Do you think about it do you think about it  
Do you think about it Ill bet you do  
Do you think about it do you think about it  
Do you think about it Ill bet you do  
Do you think about it do you think about it  
Do you think about it Ill bet you do
