Blessed assurance  
Jesus is mine  
Oh what a foretaste  
Of glory divine  
  
Heir of salvation  
Purchase of God  
Born of his spirit  
Washed in his blood  
  
This is my story  
This is my song  
Praising my savior  
All the day long  
This is my story  
This is my song  
Praising my savior  
All the day long  
  
Perfect submission  
All is at rest  
I in my savior  
Am happy and blessed  
Watching and waiting  
Looking above  
Filled with his goodness  
And lost in his love  
  
This is my story  
This is my song  
Praising my savior  
All the day long  
This is my story  
This is my song  
Praising my savior  
All the day long  
Praising my savior  
All the day long
