I tried to do a little bit of big time moving  
I played the clubs and stayed out late at night  
I tried to lose the memory of a lover  
When someone said Two wrongs dont make a right  
Well I had too much of this and that  
And this and that is no good  
I said I had too much of this and that  
And this and that is no good  
I tried so hard to really get to understand you  
You took advantage of me from the start oh baby  
But now it seems that you have found another  
And just like me youre gonna end with a broken heart  
Oh no listen to me  
cause I had too much of this and that  
And this and that is no good  
I said I had too much baby of this and that  
And this and that is no good  
Call me if youre all alone and blue  
Say you love me and Ill come running to you  
And I will you know I will do anything for you oh  
cause I had too much of this and that  
And this and that is no good  
Listen baby I had too much honey of this and that  
And this and that is no good no good  
One time  
I had too much of this and that  
And this and that is no good no good no good  
I said I had too much baby of this and that
