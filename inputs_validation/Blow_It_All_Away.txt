Without a sound ever heard  
Without a lesson I have learned  
You are foolish  
And diluted  
  
Too many lies have you burned  
Where theres eyes to be found  
This seems lifes underground  
  
But even if you had it all  
You would find  
I could never let you stay  
  
Cause you blow it all away  
You blow it all away  
Blow it all away  
  
If you go  
I will stall  
  
Yes I see it  
Yes I feel it  
You have no oppressions at all  
  
But if life is truly devoured  
Ill strip your bare till the truth comes out  
  
But even if you had it all  
You would find  
  
You blow it all  
You blow it all away  
Blow it all away  
  
Blow it all blow it all blow it all away  
  
Forever is your mind to be naive  
Remember it will bring us to our years  
You blow it all away  
  
But even if you had it all  
You would find  
  
You blow it all  
You blow it all away  
Blow it all away  
Blow it all blow it all blow it all  
Blow it all blow it all blow it all  
  
Blow it all away  
Blow it all away  
Blow it all away  
You blow it all away
