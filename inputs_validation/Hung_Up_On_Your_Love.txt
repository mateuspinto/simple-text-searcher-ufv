I was ready to take a chance  
I found myself a new romance  
Then you call that same old night  
Always change my mind  
  
Oh no not again  
Oh no not again  
  
Chorus  
Just when I thought it was over you come back  
And Im hung up on your love again  
Just when I thought I was free you come back  
Now Im hung up on your love again  
  
Just as I was doing good  
You come back just to prove you could  
Things will always be the same  
With me the victim of the game  
  
Oh no not again  
Oh no not again  
  
Chorus x4
