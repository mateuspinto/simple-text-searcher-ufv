A North country maid up to London has strayed  
Although with her nature it did not agree  
So she wept and she sighed and bitterly she cried  
Oh I wish once again in the North I could be  
For the oak and the ash and the bonny ivy tree  
They all grow green in the North country  
While sadly I roam I regret my dear home  
Where the lads and young lasses are making the hay  
Where the birds sweetly sing and the merry bells do ring  
And the maidens and meadows are pleasant and gay  
For the oak and the ash and the bonny ivy tree  
They all grow green in the North country  
No doubt if I please I could marry with ease  
Where maidens are fair many lovers will come  
But he that I wed must be North country bred  
And carry me back to my own country  
For the oak and the ash and the bonny ivy tree  
They all grow so green in the North country
