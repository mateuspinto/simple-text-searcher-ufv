I met her in Atlanta she was a dancing in a cafe  
With a price tag on her body and a tombstone in her eye  
You could tell she was not happy by the way she kept on staring  
Past the other side of nowhere at a man shed like to try  
And the makeup she had painted could not hide the youthful motions  
Of her body fom the music or the crowd  
I started like all the others with my right hand in the pocket  
While she showed us everything the law allowed  
Play it Pete Drake  
 steel  fiddle   
Twenty bucks an hour later my one bedroom apartment  
I was feeling weak from all the seeds Id sown  
She was sweet she was gentle as she introduced my body  
To some pleasures it had never ever known  
When I woke up in the morning she was a laying there beside me  
Like a kitten with her face turned to the sun  
And a look of satisfaction on her lips that make me wonder  
If she ever felt ashamed of what wed done  
So I left her in Atlanta
