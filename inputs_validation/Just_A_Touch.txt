I was on my way  
To getting close to you  
Until you flipped the script on me  
Another personality  
I was just that close  
To putting karats in your ring  
Until I peeped your card  
Now you threw it before you started baby  
  
I was just a touch away  
From playing the fool for you  
Till you lost my trust  
And now I got to back this thing on up  
I was just a touch away  
From playing the fool for you  
Till you lost my trust  
And now I got to back this thing on up babe  
  
You were almost in  
About to take you home with me  
Until you opened up my eyes  
And showed me your other side  
You were inches from the room  
Just about to take control  
Now that I know it was all an act  
I gots to get that bracelet back  
  
I was just a touch away  
From playing the fool for you  
Till you lost my trust  
And now I got to back this thing on up  
I was just a touch away  
From playing the fool for you  
Till you lost my trust  
And now I got to back this thing on up babe  
  
What made you think you could lie to me  
Baby and get away with it  
Come back down to reality  
When it comes to love you just dont get it  
  
I was just a touch away  
From playing the fool for you  
Till you lost my trust  
And now I got to back this thing on up  
I was just a touch away  
From playing the fool for you  
Till you lost my trust  
And now I got to back this thing on up babe  
  
Having never lived like a lap full of gs  
When all the time you was just tryna trap me  
Closer and closer and closer to me  
Trying to get rooted like the ground and trees  
Now I want to get tight like the harmonies  
All you want to do is just scheme scheme scheme  
Riding in my gators sittin on my things  
Drinking and smoking up all my weed  
  
I was just a touch away  
From playing the fool for you  
Till you lost my trust  
And now I got to back this thing on up  
I was just a touch away  
From playing the fool for you  
Till you lost my trust  
And now I got to back this thing on up babe
