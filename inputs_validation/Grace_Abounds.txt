Verse  
You lay aside Your throne  
And to this world  
You have come  
  
You offered up Your life  
The debt You paid  
Was not Yours  
  
Chorus  
Your grace abounds to me  
Your grace abounds to me  
Jesus  
In You I find all that I need

A gift I could not earn  
Your open arms  
Are undeserved  
  
Enabled by Your grace  
Now to live  
Is Christ alone  
  
Chorus x2  
Your grace abounds to me  
Your grace abounds to me  
Jesus  
In You I find all that I need  
  
Bridge x3  
All powerful  
All glorious  
Theres nothing like the Name of Jesus  
  
All powerful  
All glorious  
Theres nothing like Your Name  
  
Chorus x2  
Your grace abounds to me  
Your grace abounds to me  
Jesus  
In You I find all that I need  
  
Find all I need in You
