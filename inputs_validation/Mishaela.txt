Who knows what is in her eyes  
Grey clouds disperse in the four winds  
A dry riverbed overflows  
And the horizon opens wide  
  
Up to the heaven she turns her eyes  
Searching diving in to the chilly blue  
Floating in the air  
Touching the pure golden light  
That glimmers in her hair  
  
Mishaela what do you see  
What is it in your heart  
That greets the desolate silence with such laughter  
  
It is one rainbow in the east she says  
It is all I need  
  
What more could I want  
It is all that I need
