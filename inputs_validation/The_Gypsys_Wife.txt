And where where where is my Gypsy wife tonight  
Ive heard all the wild reports they cant be right  
But whose head is this shes dancing with on the threshing floor  
whose darkness deepens in her arms a little more  
And where where is my Gypsy wife tonight  
Where where is my Gypsy wife tonight  
  
Ah the silver knives are flashing in the tired old cafe  
A ghost climbs on the table in a bridal negligee  
She says My body is the light my body is the way  
I raise my arm against it all and I catch the brides bouquet  
  
And where where is my Gypsy wife tonight  
Too early for the rainbow too early for the dove  
These are the final days this is the darkness this is the flood  
And there is no man or woman who cant be touched  
But you who come between them will be judged  
  
And where where is my Gypsy wife tonight
