Are Sambora  
  
If God was a woman  
  
If God was a woman  
With long blond hair  
Would you kneel at her altar  
And offer her prayer  
Could she be your addiction  
Could she make you sin  
If God was a woman  
And you were her man  
If God was a woman  
Would you be impressed  
If she showed up in high heels  
And a pretty red dress  
Would you make a donation  
Or would you draw the line  
Would you yield to temptation  
Or savor her wine  
If God was a woman  
Shed come like an angel  
Or a devil in disguise  
When she left in the morning  
Would you lose your religion  
Or kiss your faith goodbye goodbye  
If God was a woman  
If God was a woman  
Tell me who could we blame  
Would she make jesus righteous  
Or completely insane  
If God was a woman  
Would she kiss and tell  
Would we wind up in heaven  
Or would we all burn in hell  
If God was a woman  
Shed come like an angel  
Or a devil in disguise oh yeah  
And if she left in the morning  
Would you lose your religion  
Or kiss your faith goodbye goodbye  
If God was a woman  
And you were her man yeah  
Solo  
If God was a woman  
Would she come like an angel  
Or a devil in disguise oh yeah  
When she left in the morning  
Would you lose your religion  
Or kiss your faith goodbye goodbye  
If God was a woman  
If God was a woman  
If God was a woman  
If God was a woman  
Wes all burn in hell  
If God was a  
Woman woman woman woman  
If God was a woman  
Tell me who would we blame  
If God was a woman  
If God was a woman  
Shed drive us insane yeah
