I was a crab dragging claws through the mire  
Down below in the murky depths of nowhere  
Merry Christmas Happy New Year  
Pleased to meet you oh how do you do  
  
You were the head in the window of a car  
Passed by over and over again  
Merry Christmas Happy New Year  
Pleased to meet you oh how do you do  
  
I was blind blind inside  
But now I see how you told the truth  
When you lied to me
