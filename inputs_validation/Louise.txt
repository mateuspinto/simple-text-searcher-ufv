When he saw her getting off the bus  
It seemed to wipe away the years  
Her face was older just a little rough  
But her eyes were still so clear  
He drank his coffee and he hurried out  
Across before she walked away  
Then he approached her like a little child  
Too scared for what he had to say  
  
Hello Louise  
Remember me  
Now should we part  
Or stay awhile  
As if we were still lovers  
  
She took a moment just to recognise the man shed known so well before  
And as he started to apologise  
Lose any bitterness she bore  
She gently put her finger on his lips  
To let him know she understood  
And with her suitcase standing on the floor  
Embraced him like a lover would  
  
He told louise  
You look so good  
Its just you see  
You make me feel  
As if we were still lovers  
  
Its not always true that time heals all wounds  
There are wounds that you dont wanna heal  
The memories of something really good  
Something truly real that you never found again  
  
As if we were still lovers  
  
And though they talked just for just a little time  
Before she said she had to go  
He saw the meeting as a tiny sign  
That told him all he had to know  
  
And so Louise  
Waved from the bus  
And as she left  
She gave that smile  
As if they were still lovers  
  
Its not always true that time heals all wounds  
There are wounds that you dont wanna heal  
The memories of something really good  
Something truly real that Ive never found again
