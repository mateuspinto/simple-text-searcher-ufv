Grandma welcome home  
You have  
Been gone for far too long  
Is this a dream are You really back  
  
Let me help You out of the chair  
Grandma  
Let me touch You let me feel  
  
Grandma take a look  
What do You think of the house and  
The silvery moon  
We are going to repaint the front door  
Soon  
  
Let me help You out of the chair  
Grandma  
Let me touch You let me feel  
  
Wait till You see Your room up in the  
Attic  
Prepared just like You said without a  
Bed  
You will find Your rocking chair and  
The tea pot that Missy found  
  
Let me help You out of the chair  
Grandma  
There is someone waiting for You  
Now come along  
  
Missy and Mother they are dying to  
Meet You  
How strange shes spoken no word  
I wonder Grandma  
Are You all right  
  
Grandma what was it like to be on  
That holiday site  
Oh it could have been worse but  
With them by my side  
In the twilight they sang all the old  
Lullabies  
Grandma who are they  
Never mind You dirty little brat  
  
Let us go inside somethings on  
Their mind  
They are still alive can You feel  
Their eyes  
Can You feel their eyes  
Now that You are stuck with me You  
Better be my friend
