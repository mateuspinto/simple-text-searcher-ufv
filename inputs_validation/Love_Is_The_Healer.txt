So many times in my life  
Ive been alone left alone  
Heart broken and  
Turned around  
I find myself  
Crying in the night time  
Dying out loud  
In the night I sleeplessly  
Wake up  
From a dream thats  
Tormenting me  
I I I I I gotta get help  
Oh yeah  
Love is the healer  
Love is the healer  
Come heal me  
Love is the healer  
Love is the healer  
Set me free  
Late at night I was afraid  
And I tried to turn away  
I was afraid to face  
What inevilitable is  
Say you know the way  
To find true freedom  
Can you save yourself  
From the pain youre feeling  
Something in my head  
That youre dreaming  
That the angels said  
Love is the healer  
Love is the healer  
Come heal me  
Love is the healer  
Love is the healer  
Set me free  
Love is the healer  
Love is the healer  
Come heal me  
Love is the healer  
Love is the healer  
Set me free  
I am on a mission a mission of love  
I am on a mission a mission of love  
I am on a mission a mission of love  
I am on a mission a mission of love  
I am on a mission a mission of love  
Loveis the healer  
Love is the healer  
Come as a healer  
Set me free  
Love is the healer  
Come as a healer  
Set me free  
Love is the healer  
Come as a healer  
Set me free  
Love is the healer  
Come as a healer  
Set me free  
Do you know the way to love  
Do you know the place of love  
Do you know what love  
Can do  
Do you know what  
Itll do for you
