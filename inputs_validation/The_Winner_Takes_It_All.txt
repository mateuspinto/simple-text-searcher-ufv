I dont want to talk  
About the things weve gone through  
Though its hurting me  
Now its history  
Ive played all my cards  
And thats what youve done too  
Nothing more to say  
No more ace to play  
  
The winner takes it all  
The loser standing small  
Beside the victory  
Thats my destiny  
  
I was in your arms  
Thinking I belonged there  
I figured it made sense  
Building me a fence  
Building me a home  
Thinking Id be strong there  
But I was a fool  
Playing by the rules  
  
The gods may throw a dice  
Their minds as cold as ice  
And someone way down here  
Loses someone dear  
The winner takes it all  
The loser has to fall  
Its simple and its plain  
Why should I complain  
  
But tell me does she kiss  
Like I used to kiss you  
Does it feel the same  
When she calls your name  
Somewhere deep inside  
You must know I miss you  
But what can I say  
Rules must be obeyed  
  
The judges will decide  
The likes of me abide  
Spectators of the show  
Always staying low  
The game is on again  
A lover or a friend  
A big thing or a small  
The winner takes it all  
  
I dont want to talk  
If it makes you feel sad  
And I understand  
Youve come to shake my hand  
I apologize  
If it makes you feel bad  
Seeing me so tense  
No selfconfidence  
But you see  
The winner takes it all  
The winner takes it all
