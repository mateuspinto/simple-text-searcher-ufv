Chorus  
Emotions in this game run deep  
So before these haters kill me in my sleep  
Id like to say its been a pleasure  
Reppin til my last second through  
Done a lot of shit theyll never get to do  
Id like to say its been a pleasure  
Honored to be somebody they mention  
But before these niggas stop payin attention  
Ill just say its been a pleasure  
Youll never be somebody they need  
Tomorrow aint guaranteed  
So tonight we gon do it like this  
Oh for the HTown  
Tonight Im gon make some money go  
For the HTown  
  
Ladies and gentlemen  
Youre now listenin to the Dirty South trillionaire naire  
Keepin it trill in there been here and hes still in there there  
Pay attention its the beginnin of a new era era  
Get a little closer you can see the view clearer view clearer  
Its like Lasik but are basic  
Ebonics if youre hooked on chronic and you can taste it  
Trace it recognize the real when ya face it  
Ball up in the club gettin white boy wasted  
One shot of Patron then another one to chase it  
Put me to the test I wont pass it Ill ace it  
Been so many places up and down the interstate  
Cities that Ive never been wonderin if they fin to hate  
Step up in the spot let em look me in the grill grill  
So they can see it for they self that I keep it trill I keep it trill  
I paid the cost to be the boss and left a tip  
So its all good good dont even trip  
Believe me its been a pleasure  
  
Chorus  
  
Man Ive been all over the world  
Tryin to tell em bout the trill and what we been through through  
What we already done and what we fin do do  
What we got into what we gettin into to  
When ties bout to cut it closer than a Ginsu su  
Roll through Atlanta Birmingham Alabama bama  
Jacksonville to Jackson Mississippi spittin grammar spittin grammar  
From Shreveport port down to New Orleans leans  
And all points in between just to get the cream cream  
Me and my II Trill team on the road flippin flippin  
Eight hours straight no stops no trippin trippin  
Had to keep them heaters on em so its no slippin slippin  
Promote a play with show money we were slow grippin slow grippin  
Sometimes we rock the stage and put it down down  
Other times we had to fight and shoot it out of town town  
But we always made it home okay  
And we still on the road to this day  
I gotta say its been a pleasure  
  
Chorus  
  
They say that you never really know  
What you got til its gone and cant touch it touch it  
If it look too good to be true you cant trust it trust it  
If you never had it had it then you can never miss it miss it  
But looks can be deceivin so dont you get it twisted twisted  
Walked a lot of miles in these old school Js Js  
Thought of many ways lookin at back in the days days  
Like how to climb from in between a rock and a hard place  
How to keep your cool when youre dealin with a hard case with a hard case  
And how to duck when the judge throw the book at you the book at you  
And its a twosided mirror that youre lookin through youre lookin
through  
The phone receivers in your hand starin at your child child  
And your heart skips a beat every time they smile smile  
See thats how real life is and how it can be can be  
And how its deeper then just comin down candy candy  
So Im just tryin to play the cards that they hand me  
For those that overstood me understand me  
Its been a pleasure  
  
Chorus  
  
Id like to say its been a pleasure  
Ill just say its been a pleasure
