Biggie mom  
Lets say many times as i looked and soroow reflexes of my son Biggie i argue
sometimes and saltied i soroow thoughts and said Well Done i thoght of  
Him Biggie instinly and slighty ask why i tried formly and just cant say
goodbye i live with visions twin and twisted passion so cold and withored  
Thoghts batored shattered i dream dreams cherish memorys house friendships
and promise that mattered in the end time is trausured like love for my son  
Love Is Everlasting
