Island goodbye island goodbye  
We been too long together my island and I  
Cross the blue sea cross the blue sea  
We been too long together my island and me  
  
Cobwebs and dust cobwebs and dust  
I hate to leave you but leave you I must  
Float through the sky float through the sky  
We been too long together my cobwebs and I  
  
Troubles goodbye troubles goodbye  
We been too long together my troubles and I  
Cross the blue sea cross the blue sea  
We been too long together my troubles and me  
  
Cobwebs and dust cobwebs and dust  
I hate to leave you but leave you I must  
Float through the sky float through the sky  
We been too long together my cobwebs and I  
  
Unlock the gate unlock the gate  
Lower the drawbridge the hour is late  
Whom shall it be Whom shall it be  
We been too long together my drawbridge and me  
  
Cobwebs and dust cobwebs and dust  
I hate to leave you but leave you I must  
Float through the sky float through the sky  
We been too long together my cobwebs and I  
  
Tear down the walls tear down the walls  
Gather my treasure and scatter it all  
Cross the blue sea cross the blue sea  
We been too long together my island and me  
  
Run to her side run to her side  
Run to my island and make her yer bride  
Whom shall it be Whom shall it be  
We been too long together my island and me
