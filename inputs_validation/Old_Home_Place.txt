Its been ten long years since I left my home in the hollow where I was born  
Where the cool fall nights make the woods smell right and the fox hunter blows
him horn  
I fell in love with a girl from the town I thought that she would be true  
I ran away to Charlottsville and worked in a sawmill or two  
What have they done to the old home place  
Why did they tear it down  
And why did I leave the plow in the field and look for a job in the town  
Now the girl ran off with somebody else tariffs took all my pay  
And here I stand where the old home stood before they took it away  
Now geese fly south and the cold wind blows as I stand here and hang my head  
I lost my love and lost my home and now I wish that I was dead  
Chorus
