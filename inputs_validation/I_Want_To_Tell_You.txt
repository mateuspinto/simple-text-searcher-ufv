I want to tell you  
My head is filled with things to say  
When youre here  
All those words they seem to slip away  
  
When I get near you  
The games begin to drag me down  
Its all right  
Ill make you maybe next time around  
  
But if I seem to act unkind  
Its only me its not my mind  
That is confusing things  
I want to tell you  
I feel hung up and I dont know why  
I dont mind  
I could wait forever Ive got time  
  
Sometimes I wish I knew you well  
Then I could speak my mind and tell  
Maybe youd understand  
  
I want to tell you  
I feel hung up and I dont know why  
I dont mind  
I could wait forever Ive got time  
Ive got time  
Ive got time
