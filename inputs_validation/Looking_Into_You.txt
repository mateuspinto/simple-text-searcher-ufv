Well I looked into a house I once lived in  
Around the time I first went on my own  
When the roads were as many as the places I had dreamed of  
And my friends and I were one  
Now the distance is done and the search has begun  
Ive come to see where my beginnings have gone  
  
Oh the walls and the windows were still standing  
And the music could be heard at the door  
Where the people who kindly endured my odd questions  
Asked if I came very far  
And when my silence replied they took me inside  
Where their children sat playing on the floor  
  
Well we spoke of the changes that would find us farther on  
And it left me so warm and so high  
But as I stepped back outside to the grey morning sun  
I heard that highway whisper and sigh  
Are you ready to fly  
  
And I looked into the faces all passing by  
Its an ocean that will never be filled  
And the house that grows older and finally crumbles  
That even love cannot rebuild  
Its a hotel at best youre here as a guest  
You oughta make yourself at home while youre waiting for the rest  
  
Well I looked into dream of the millions  
That one day the search will be through  
Now here I stand at the edge of my embattled illusions  
Looking into you  
  
The great song traveler passed through here  
And he opened my eyes to the view  
And I was among those who called him a prophet  
And I asked him what was true  
Until the distance had shown how the road remains alone  
Now Im looking in my life for a truth that is my own  
  
Well I looked into the sky for my anthem  
And the words and the music came through  
But words and music can never touch the beauty that Ive seen  
Looking into you  and thats true
