I went down to the grocery store  
To get in I had to pay a dime or more  
I hadnt yet begun to start  
When I had to pay the rent on the shopping cart  
Deedle lee dumb deedle lee dumb  
Deedle lee dumb de dumb dumb  
Well I let the kids loose on the floor  
And they ran round for a while or more  
Till the manager with the broken smile  
Said its a dollar down and a quarter an aisle  
Deedle lee dumb deedle lee dumb  
Deedle lee dumb de dumb dumb  
I was down in the freezer upon my knees  
Somebody was yelling that the price got freezed  
There was a rioting mob a strangling hold  
I received the bill for the escaping cold  
Deedle lee dumb deedle lee dumb  
Deedle lee dumb de dumb dumb  
It was about this time that I was goin insane  
I went and picked the kids up in the other lane  
Put back the food and ran out of the store  
I aint goin back to that place no more  
Deedle lee dumb deedle lee dumb  
Deedle lee dumb de dumb dumb  
Well Im tellin the truth now I dont fib  
I dont mind no womens lib  
But if my woman dont want to go down to the store  
The family aint gonna eat no more  
Deedle lee dumb deedle lee dumb  
Deedle lee dumb de dumb dumb
