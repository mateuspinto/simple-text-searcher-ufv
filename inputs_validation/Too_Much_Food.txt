You can say that Im one curly fry in the box of the regular  
Messing with the flavor oh the flavor that you savor  
Saving me for last but you better not eat me at all  
Living in a fast food bag making friends with the ketchup and salt  
People say that Im crazy for not moving on to better things  
Instead Im sitting around trash talking with the onion rings  
But its much too soon to leave this easy life  
Pass me the spoon Pass the analytical knife  
  
Cause your about to get cut and get cut down  
Its all about the wordplay all about the sound in the tone of my voice  
You gotta let me make my choice alone before my food gets cold  
Better shut up or get shot down Its all about the know how all just a matter
of taste  
Stop telling me the way I gotta play Too much food on my plate  
  
Believe it or not I super sized my sights on the surprise in the cereal box  
My stomachs smaller than my eyes  
so I went to see the doctor and he said turn your head and then cough  
I didnt listen to what he said instead I couldnt wait to get off  
He said I can have this but I cant have that  
That I should keep wishing I was living the life of a cat because  
I aint the one whose gonna be missing the feast  
Just like you aint the one who seems to be calming the beast  
  
Now your about to get cut and get cut down  
Its all about the wordplay all about the sound in the tone of my voice  
You gotta let me make my choice alone before my food gets cold  
Better shut up or get shot down It s all about the know how all just a matter
of taste  
Stop telling me the way I gotta play Too much food on my plate  
  
Well if you are what you eat in my case Ill be sweet so come and get some  
Im so over it  
  
Now your about to get cut and get cut down  
It s all about the know how all just a matter of taste  
Stop telling me the way I gotta play Too much food on my plate  
Get up and get some  
Theres too much food on my plate
