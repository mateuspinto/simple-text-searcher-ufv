America Will Always Stand  
Randy Travis  
Album America Will Always Stand  
She stands in the face of evil  
And will not lose hope or faith  
America the land of freedom  
Still the home of the brave  
Chorus  
So raise the banner called Old Glory  
Let us join our fellow man  
History will write the story  
America will always stand  
Walking through the fires of danger  
There are those who gave their lives  
Theyre the worlds greatest heroes  
And we wont forget their sacrifice  
Chorus  
So raise the banner called Old Glory  
Let us join our fellow man  
History will write the story  
America will always stand  
America is not divided  
Our enemies they will be stopped  
Cause we the people are united  
And still one nation Under God  
Chorus  
So raise the banner called Old Glory  
Let us join our fellow man  
History will write the story  
America will always stand  
History will write the story  
America will always stand
