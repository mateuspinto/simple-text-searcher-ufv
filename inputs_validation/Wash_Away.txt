An old man lying by the road  
Black as night  
Hes got his finger on the trigger  
An easy target in sight  
Hes got no future no family tree  
Hes got a three dollar bottle  
And he drinks til he cant see  
All night all night  
  
A young girl waiting on a line  
Eight am shes got a six month old burden  
Willpowers withering thin  
An unwed mother beaten by her trade  
Each week her welfare reminds her  
Of mistakes she never made  
Oh no  
  
Now what has that to say about tomorrow  
What has that to show for today  
Noah thought to build an ark  
Before the heavens washed it all away  
Away  
  
A baby crying through a dream  
An afterthought  
Mother is seething for pleasure  
After the poison is bought  
His eyes are tainted staggered is his breath  
Oh God hes addicted  
Addicted to death  
Oh no  
  
Now what has that to say about tomorrow  
What has that to show for today yeah yeah yeah  
Noah thought to build an ark  
Before the heavens washed it all away  
Away yeah  
  
Oh now  
Now what has that to say about tomorrow  
What is that to show for today yeah yeah yeah  
Noah thought to build an ark  
Before the heavens washed it all away
