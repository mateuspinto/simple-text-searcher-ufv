Angels we have heard on high  
Sweetly singing oer the plains  
And the mountains in reply  
Echoing their joyous strains  
  
Gloria in excelsis Deo  
Gloria in excelsis Deo  
  
Shepherds why this jubilee  
Why your joyous strains prolong  
What the gladsome tidings be  
Which inspire your heavenly song  
  
Gloria in excelsis Deo  
Gloria in excelsis Deo  
  
Come to Bethlehem and see  
Christ whose birth the angels sing  
Come adore on bended knee  
Christ the Lord the newborn King  
  
Gloria in excelsis Deo  
Gloria in excelsis Deo  
  
See Him in a manger laid  
Whom the choirs of angels praise  
Mary Joseph lend your aid  
While our hearts in love we raise  
  
Gloria in excelsis Deo  
Gloria in excelsis Deo
