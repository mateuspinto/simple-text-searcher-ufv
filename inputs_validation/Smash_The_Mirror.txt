Mother  
  
You dont answer my call  
With even a nod or a wink  
But you gaze at your own reflection  
You dont seem to see me  
But I think you can see yourself  
How can the mirror affect you  
  
Can you hear me  
Or do I surmise  
That you fear me can you feel my temper  
Rise  
  
Do you hear or fear or  
Do I smash the mirror  
Do you hear of fear or  
Do I smash the mirror Smash
