Ten thousand men on a hill  
Ten thousand men on a hill  
Some of m goin down some of m gonna get killed  
  
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue  
Ten thousand men dressed in oxford blue  
Drummin in the morning in the evening theyll be coming for you  
  
Ten thousand men on the move  
Ten thousand men on the move  
None of them doing nothin that your mama wouldnt disapprove  
  
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold  
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold  
All clean shaven all coming in from the cold  
  
Hey Who could your lover be  
Hey Who could your lover be  
Let me eat off his head so you can really see  
  
Ten thousand women all dressed in white  
Ten thousand women all dressed in white  
Standin at my window wishing me goodnight  
  
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail  
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail  
Each one of em got seven wives each one of em just out of jail  
  
Ten thousand women all sweepin my room  
Ten thousand women all sweepin my room  
Spilling my buttermilk sweeping it up with a broom  
  
Ooh baby thank you for my tea  
Baby thank you for my tea  
Its so sweet of you to be so nice to me
