On the field I remember you were incredible  
Hey shut up hey shut up yeah  
On the field I remember you were incredible  
Hey shut up hey shut up yeah  
  
On the match with the boys you think youre all alone  
With the pain that you drain from love  
In a car with a girl promise me shes not your world  
Cause Andy youre a star  
  
Leave your number on the locker and Ill give you a call  
Hey shut up hey shut up yeah  
Leave your legacy in gold on the plaques that line the hall  
Hey shut up hey shut up yeah  
  
On the streets such a sweet face jumping in town  
In the staff when the verdict is in  
In a car with a girl promise me shes not your world  
Cause Andy youre a star  
In nobodys eyes but mine  
Andy youre a star  
In nobodys eyes but mine  
Andy youre a star  
In nobodys eyes  
In nobodys eyes but mine
