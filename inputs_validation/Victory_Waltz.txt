Come take me down to your heart of gold and I will hear your song  
Cover me up in your fantasy world where I can do you no harm  
  
  
And hold me now close to you  
Fear the thoughts I am sending  
Hold me now close again  
This dream is almost ending  
  
  
Come take me down to your victory waltz and I will break your heart  
Gaze once again at the promise we made that I have torn all apart  
  
  
And hold me now close to you  
As though were still pretending  
Hold me now close again  
This dream is almost ending
