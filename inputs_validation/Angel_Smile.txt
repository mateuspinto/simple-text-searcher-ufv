I never thought that I could find  
Angel smile Heaven on Earth  
And peace of mind angel smile  
Someone to love me all the time  
Angel smile oh whoa oh oh  
  
And then I saw your angel smile  
It made my heart start jumping  
And my nerves start running wild  
You made my nerves start running wild  
  
I been to dances by the score  
Angel smile I never cared  
To dance before angel smile  
But there I was on the ballroom floor  
Angel smile oh oh whoa oh  
  
It only took your angel smile  
To make the music move me  
And my feet start running wild  
You made my feet start running wild  
  
What chases the blue  
When I am low angel smile  
What gives me that tender  
Loving glow angel smile  
And what will I always cherish so  
Angel smile oh oh oh oh  
  
And when I see your angel smile  
I dream of you there beside me  
As we both walk down the aisle  
You make me feet walk down the aisle  
  
What chases the blue  
When I am low angel smile  
What gives me that tender  
Loving glow angel smile  
And what will I always cherish so  
Angel smile oh oh oh oh  
  
And when I see your angel smile  
I dream of you there beside me  
As we both walk down the aisle
