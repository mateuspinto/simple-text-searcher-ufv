Living life dont you cry  
My life pain is God  
Many nights painful thoughts occur  
Yell at me again Im numb  
In denial I tried to be your friend  
I tried to be a good boy  
All I see a hate deep inside  
Startle me someone save me  
Now these memories fill my heart  
They bury me  
All I want to do is kill you  
You are not my real mother Ill beat and stab and fuck her  
You are not my real mother Ill beat and stab and fuck her  
You are not my real mother Ill beat and stab and fuck her  
You are not my real mother Ill beat and stab and fuck her  
  
Looking back I was never ever right you were my step mom  
who always wanted me out of your sight  
I would come walkin in and Id say hello but youd slap me  
And youd make some fucked up comment about my clothes but I tried to let it
pass  
But the pictures in my head were with you with a knife up your ass  
Laying dead so I popped some more caps in your ass now your son is not so fun  
Mother fucking bitch dont you ever try to play me  
You make me lie it hurt so  
All I want to do is kill you  
All I want to do is kill you  
All I want to do is kill you  
All I want to do is kill you  
You are not my real mother Ill beat and stab and fuck her  
You are not my real mother Ill beat and stab and fuck her  
  
Wish you were dead now  
Now right now  
How can I cry over someone I never loved  
How can I cry over someone I never loved  
Never loved  
Never loved
