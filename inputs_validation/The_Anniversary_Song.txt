Oh how we danced on the night we were wed  
We vowed our true love though a word wasnt said  
The world was in bloom there were stars in the skies  
Except for the few that were there in your eyes  
  
Dear as I held you close in my arms  
Angels were singing a hymn to your charms  
Two hearts gently beating murmuring low  
Darling I love you so  
  
The night seemed to fade into blossoming dawn  
The sun shone anew but the dance lingered on  
Could we but recall that sweet moment sublime  
Wed find that our love is unaltered by time  
  
Darling I love you so  
  
The night seemed to fade into blossoming dawn  
The sun shone anew but the dance lingered on  
Could we but recall that sweet moment sublime  
Wed find that our love is unaltered by time
