Chewing on a piece of grass  
Walking down the road  
Tell me how long you gonna stay here Joe  
Some people say this town dont look  
Good in snow  
You dont care I know  
  
Ventura Highway in the sunshine  
Where the days are longer  
The nights are stronger  
Than moonshine  
Youre gonna go I know  
  
Cause the free wind is blowin through  
Your hair  
And the days surround your daylight  
There  
Seasons crying no despair  
Alligator lizards in the air  
  
Wishin on a falling star  
Watchin for the early train  
Sorry boy but Ive been hit by  
Purple rain  
Aw come on Joe you can always  
Change your name  
Thanks a lot son just the same  
  
Ventura Highway  
In the sunshine  
Where the days are longer  
The nights are stronger  
Than moonshine  
Youre gonna go I know  
  
Cause the free wind is blowin through  
Your hair  
And the days surround you daylight  
There  
Seasons crying no despair  
Alligator lizards in the air
