Chorus  
Im gonna suffer for you no longer  
Im gonna suffer for you no more  
Im gonna write you out of my life  
And shut the door  
  
You tried to drive a wedge between me and my friends  
You pushed me to the edge time and again  
Ive been living in your shade since I cant remember when  
Now Im bringing this charade to an end  
  
Chorus  
  
There was subtlety and skill in your manipulative ways  
You chipped away my will so you could make me stay  
You soothed me with your voice until I obeyed  
But Im making my own choice from today  
  
You used the tongue of love like a boxer uses fists  
You contained me like a glove or a creeping cloak of mist  
You guaranteed the stars but there always was a twist  
Now I see you as you are Egotist   
  
Chorus  
  
Ive got a ticket in my hand and I must be moving on  
But I want you to understand that from the moment I am gone  
I release and let you go you owe nothing now to me  
Im not angry anymore Im free   
  
Chorus
