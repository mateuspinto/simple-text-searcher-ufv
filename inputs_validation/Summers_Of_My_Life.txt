The sea is sad the world is stray  
The love of earth has passed away  
And war after war how we fail and ignore what we defend  
And soon it will end  
The pain is east the pain is west  
The greed of all men has ravaged the blessed  
And year after year every crime reappears without a care  
Where are the summers of my life  
Have the seasons all gone cold  
Where are the lovers of this life  
Whos drowned the fires of our souls  
What have we done  
If God is good then God be cruel  
Take back the world youve granted to fools  
Salvage the land that is best without man and all his grief  
Where are the summers of my life  
Have the seasons all gone cold  
Where are the lovers of this life  
Whos drowned the fires of our souls  
Where are the summers of my life  
Have the seasons all gone cold  
Where are the lovers of this life  
Whos drowned the fires of our souls
