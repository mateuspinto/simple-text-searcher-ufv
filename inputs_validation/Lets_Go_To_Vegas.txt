Hey baby lets go to Vegas  
Kiss the single life goodbye  
Hey baby lets go to Vegas  
Bet on love and let it ride  
  
Lyin on the bank of the river  
Stars are dancin Lord its hot  
Holdin you is what I live for  
I just had a crazy thought  
  
Hey baby lets go to Vegas  
Kiss the single life goodbye  
Hey baby lets go to Vegas  
Bet on love and let it ride  
  
Well find a little wedding chapel  
A pair of rings and a preacher too  
Underneath the neon steeple  
Well take a gamble and say I do  
  
Hey baby lets go to Vegas  
Kiss the single life goodbye  
Hey baby lets go to Vegas  
Bet on love and let it ride  
  
Viva Las Vegas sparklin lights  
Dangerous livin tumblin dice  
Youre my ace in the hole now honey  
And Im your lady luck  
Pack a few things and a little money  
And put em in the truck  
  
Hey baby lets go to Vegas  
Kiss the single life goodbye  
Hey baby lets go to Vegas  
Bet on love and let it ride
