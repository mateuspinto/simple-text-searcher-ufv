The better of the people the perents are people  
Are depending on we depending on for the growth of children  
On the deeds of the children  
If they teach them right  
They gonna have a brighter future  
If they teach them wrong  
We gonna have nothing in the world  
If they grow up without their parent

If they grow up without their parent  
Whose gonna tell this is wrong who gonna tell them

Born to suffer  
  
You gonna watch out my son  
If your mother doesnt care for you  
You gonna watch out my son  
If your father doesnt care for you

They need parental care  
They need spiritual care  
  
If they grow up without their parent  
Whose gonna tell this is right tell them  
If they grow up without their parent  
Whose gonna tell them this is wrong  
  
Without the mother  
Children suffering  
Without the father  
Children suffering  
Without the parent help
