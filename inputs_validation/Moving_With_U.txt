Looky here looky here looky here  
You out the frame with it you off the chain with it  
You out the frame with it woman woman  
  
You got your girlfriend around ya  
No wonder she surround you Look at you  
Your brown eyes pierce just like a knight  
Make a fella think real hard about the rest of his life  
The whole shit is strange Im really thinkin brains  
But on the other hand I really feel your stress and pain  
Flimsy little men they cant command you  
And they dont have the heart to demand you  
But neither do I I guess Ill let you walk  
On and watch cause your walk is strong  
Sippin passion wit a stranger in the club  
It doesnt necessarily equate to love  
Its not really in the air I want to take it elsewhere  
Somethin wild that you cant compare  
Bangin on my wood drum now  
Hope your hearin all the sound Now nigga come now  
Sittin at home a hat in my hand  
While you crawlin on the earth with your natural tan  
Your than is jiggalin and causin a stir  
Lets do it real rough until life is a blur  
  
Chorus  
I suit you the way thatchu want  
Hey hey hey the way thatchu want  
It caught me the way thatchu want Uh uh uh  
Hey hey hey the way thatchu want Check it out now  
I suit you the way thatchu want Check it out Check it Uh  
Hey hey hey the way thatchu want Check it  
It got me the way thatchu want  
Hey hey hey the way thatchu want  
  
I can kinda understand you know  
I mean bein at the top I mean to start a show  
The brushes with fame continuous game you get  
Hustles with plans stakin they clans and shit  
But you shine and you pay it no mind always  
Stayin on the grind with the things you do  
You got the illest little switch and you  
Aint takin no shit cause nobody want to fuck with you  
Admiration to the utmost  
All my dogs raise your cups til the girl toast  
I dont want to bring shame to you really  
I want to put flames to you sincerely  
Make your boxspring jump like a low rida  
Best place that I could be is inside ya  
The love that we have could be real  
But you gotta go by what your heart feels  
Heart feels Repeat x4  
Come on  
  
Chorus
