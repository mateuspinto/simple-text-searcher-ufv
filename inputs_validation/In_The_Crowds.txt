I look for the sun  
In dire need of someone somewhere  
I look for the sun  
In dire need of someone somewhere  
Words lost in the past  
Of memories that will never last  
  
My mind wanders the crowds in a search  
In the search of the one that I feel is my life  
It the crowds  
  
For me this is the end  
For me this is the end  
For me this is the end  
For me this is the end  
For me this is the end  
For me this is the end  
For me this is the end
