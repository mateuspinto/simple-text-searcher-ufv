Left my fear by side of the road  
Hear You speak wont let go  
Fall to my knees as I lift my hands to pray  
Got every reason to be here again  
Fathers love that draws me in  
And all my eyes wanna see is a glimpse of You  
  
All I need is You  
All I need is You Lord is You Lord  
  
All I need is You  
All I need is You lord is You Lord  
  
One more day and its not the same  
Your spirit calls my heart to sing  
Drawn to the voice of my Savior once again  
Where would my soul be without Your Son  
Gave His life to save the earth  
Rest in the thought that Youre watching over me  
  
All I need is You  
All I need is You Lord is You Lord  
  
All I need is You  
All I need is You Lord is You Lord  
  
You hold the universe  
You hold everyone on earth  
You hold the universe  
You hold You hold  
  
Cos all I need is You  
All I need is You  
  
All I need is You  
All I need is You Lord is You Lord
