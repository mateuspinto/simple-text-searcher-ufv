I am a sailor youre my first mate  
We signed on together we coupled our fate  
Hauled up our anchor determined not to fail  
For the hearts treasure together we set sail  
  
With no maps to guide us we steered our own course  
Rode out the storms when the winds were gale force  
Sat out the doldrums in patience and hope  
Working together we learned how to cope  
  
Chorus  
Life is an ocean and love is a boat  
In troubled water that keeps us afloat  
When we started the voyage there was just me and you  
Now gathered round us we have our own crew  
  
Together were in this relationship  
We built it with care to last the whole trip  
Our true destinations not marked on any charts  
Were navigating to the shores of the heart  
  
Chorus  
Life is an ocean and love is a boat  
In troubled water that keeps us afloat  
When we started the voyage there was just me and you  
Now gathered round us we have our own crew  
  
Chorus  
Life is an ocean and love is a boat  
In troubled water that keeps us afloat  
When we started the voyage there was just me and you  
Now gathered round us we have our own crew
