We are so fragile  
Advertising lies  
That are whiter than yours  
We are so fragile  
They could give us a war  
Just to keep us amused  
  
We are so fragile  
I could stay here inside  
And say Its all been done  
We are so fragile  
Just pretend I never tried  
Ill leave up to you  
  
We are still so young  
And it must be wrong  
But Ill do it all the same  
We are really so shy  
Theres nothing I can do  
Except believe in you  
  
We could always go home  
But everyone says  
This is the place to be  
We are so unnatural  
But you wouldnt understand  
You only deal with men
