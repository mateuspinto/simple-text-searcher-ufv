Mother s first look to the eyes of a child  
Casts the die of destiny  
Its a perfect life she gives to you  
Not to lose so innocently  
Leading the way she rises above  
Unexpected adversity  
I hear her calling keeper of the light  
The words of warning thunder in the night  
I hear her calling guarding what is right  
I see her waiting keeper of the light  
  
A silhouette on the skyline a symbol of your liberty  
Protecting time thats passing by  
Mother knows never lies  
A better life the children will see  
A world of change full of hope and sympathy  
  
I hear her calling keeper of the light  
The words of warning thunder in the night  
I hear her calling guarding what is right  
I see her waiting keeper of the light  
  
Repeat
