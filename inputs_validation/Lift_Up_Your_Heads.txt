Lift up your heads oh you gates  
Swing open wide you ancient doors  
Let the King of kings take his rightful place  
Make room make way for the King of grace  
Lift up your hands open up your hearts  
His victory over sin and death is ours  
Let the King of kings take his rightful place  
Make room make way for our King of grace  
Who is this King of glory Lord of power  
His name is Jesus our risen King  
Who is this King so mighty Lord of strength  
His name is Jesus our risen King  
Lift up your hands open up your hearts  
His victory over sin and death is ours  
Let the King of kings take his rightful place  
Make room make way for our King of grace  
Who is this King of glory Lord of power  
His name is Jesus our risen King  
Who is this King so mighty Lord of strength  
His name is Jesus our risen King  
Who is this King of glory Lord of power  
His name is Jesus our risen King  
Who is this King so mighty Lord of strength  
His name is Jesus our risen King  
King of glory Lord of power  
King of glory Lord of power  
King of glory Lord of power  
King of glory Lord of power
