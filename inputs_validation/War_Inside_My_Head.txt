Napalm napalm napalm showers  
Showed the cowards  
Werent there to mess around  
Heat exhaustion  
Mind distortion  
Military victory mounted on innocent ground  
Hearing voices from miles away  
Saying things never said  
Seeing shadows in the light of the day  
Waging a war inside my head  
War inside my head  
Years and years of  
Bloodshed and warfare  
Our mission was only to get in and kill  
A free vacation  
Of palm trees and shrapnel  
Trading innocence for permanent psychotic hell  
Hearing voices from miles away  
Saying things never said  
Seeing shadows in the light of the day  
Waging a war inside my head  
Feeling strangers staring my way  
Reading minds never read  
Tasting danger with each word I say  
Waging a war inside my
