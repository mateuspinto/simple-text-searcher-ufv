Come out Virginia dont let me wait  
You Catholic girls start much too late  
Aw but sooner or later it comes down to faith  
Oh I might as well be the one  
  
Well they showed you a statue told you to pray  
They built you a temple and locked you away  
Aw but they never told you the price that you pay  
For things that you might have done  
Only the good die young  
Thats what I said  
Only the good die young  
Only the good die young  
  
You might have heard I run with a dangerous crowd  
We aint too pretty we aint too proud  
We might be laughing a bit too loud  
Aw but that never hurt no one  
  
So come on Virginia show me a sign  
Send up a signal Ill throw you a line  
The stainedglass curtain youre hiding behind  
You know  
Never lets in the sun  
Darlin only the good die young  
Woah  
I tell ya  
Only the good die young  
Only the good die young  
  
You got a nice white dress and a party on your confirmation  
You got a brand new soul  
Mmm and a cross of gold  
But Virginia they didnt give you quite enough information  
You didnt count on me  
When you were counting on your rosary  
Oh woah woah  
  
They say theres a heaven for those who will wait  
Some say its better but I say it aint  
Id rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints  
The sinners are much more fun  
You know that only the good die young  
Thats what I said  
I tell ya  
Only the good die young  
Only the good die young  
  
Well your mother told you all that I could give you was a reputation  
Aw she never cared for me  
But did she ever say a prayer for me oh woah woah  
  
Come out come out come out Virginia dont let em wait  
You Catholic girls start much too late  
Oh sooner or later it comes down to faith  
Oh I might as well be the one  
You know that only the good die young  
  
Im telling you baby  
You know that only the good die young  
Only the good die young  
Only the good  
Only the good die young  
Only the good  
Only the good die young
