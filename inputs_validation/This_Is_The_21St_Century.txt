If you could only see what Ive seen with your eyes  
  
A wise man once said  
A flower is only  
A sexual organ  
Beauty is cruelty  
And evolution  
A wise man once said  
that everything could be explained with mathematics  
He had denied  
His feminine side  
Now where is the wisdom in that  
  
I came just as fast as I could  
Through the dirty air  
Of your neighbourhood  
Your name on a grain of rice  
Hangin around my neck  
And a head like lead  
  
This is the 21st century  
I heard everything they said  
The Universe demystified  
Chemicals for God  
This is the 21st century  
I heard everything they said  
  
A wise man once wrote  
That love is only  
An ancient instinct  
For reproduction  
Natural selection  
A wise man once said  
That everything could be explained  
And its all in the brain  
  
We lay on a velvet rug  
by the open fire  
She blew air on my eyelids  
I cried Whats it all about  
As she kissed my hair  
She said There there  
  
This is the 21st century  
I heard everything you said  
The universe demystified  
Astronomy instead  
This is the 21st century  
Cant you get it through your head  
This aint the way it was meant to be  
Magic isnt dead  
Come to bed  
Come to bed  
  
And rest your heavy head my love  
And slowly from above  
She showed the answers something that cant be written down  
  
This is the 21st century  
Flash to crash and burn  
Nobodys gonna give you anything  
For nothing in return  
Theres a man up in a mirrored building  
And he just bought the world  
  
Would you want  
To have kids  
Growing up  
Into whats left of this  
  
She shook her head  
She said Cant you see  
The world is you  
The world is me
