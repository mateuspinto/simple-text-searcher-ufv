Walking in the snowy street  
Let me understand  
Drifting down a silent park  
Stumbling over land  
Open up your heart to me  
Show me who you are  
And I would be your slave  
  
Do you sleep in quietude  
Do you walk in peace  
Do you laugh out loud at me  
No one else that is free  
Open up your heart to me  
Show me all you are  
And I would be your slave  
  
I dont sit around and wait  
I dont give a damn  
I dont see the point at all  
No footprints in the sand  
  
I bet you laugh out loud at me  
A chance to strike me down  
Give me peace of mind at last  
Show me all you are  
Open up your heart to me  
And I would be your slave  
  
I dont sit and wait  
I dont give a damn  
I dont see the point at all  
No footprints in the sand  
I would give you all my love  
Nothing else is free  
Open up your heart to me  
And I would be your slave
