No earthly church has ever blessed our union  
No state has ever granted us permission  
No family bond has ever made us two  
No company has ever earned commission  
  
No debt was paid no dowry to be gained  
No treaty over border land or power  
No semblance of the world outside remained  
To stain the beauty of this nuptial hour  
  
The secret marriage vow is never spoken  
The secret marriage can never be broken  
  
No flowers on the altar  
No white veil in your hair  
No maiden dress to alter  
No Bible oath to swear  
  
The secret marriage vow is never spoken  
The secret marriage can never be broken
