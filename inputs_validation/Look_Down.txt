Im holding my hand out keeping my head high  
Trying to get out of mechanical nights  
When I get to the top of the clear crystal mountain  
Im going to stay up there as long as I can  
And look down  
Dig in the sights all around  
Listen to all of the sounds and look down  
And look down and look in  
And my mind sends me reeling breathing and feeling  
I remember the time when I tried to come clean  
But my interests collided besides I was misguided  
And who do you confide in when you trip on a dream  
And look down  
Dig in the sights all around  
Listen to all of the sounds and look down  
And look down and look in  
If you want to come with me and tell me what you see  
Just step in beside me and do what you want  
And you may see clearly though it sometimes is lonely  
To be free is the only possession that counts  
Im holding my hand out Im keeping my head high  
Trying to get out of mechanical nights  
When I get to the top of the clear crystal mountain  
Im going to stay up there as long as I can  
Dig in the sights all around  
Listen to all of the sounds and look down  
And look down  
And look down  
And look down  
Look down  
Look down  
Look down  
Hold on Im coming
