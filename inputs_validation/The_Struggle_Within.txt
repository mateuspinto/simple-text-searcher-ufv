Reaching out for something youve got to feel  
While clutching to what you had thought was real  
Kicking at a dead horse pleases you  
No way of showing your gratitude  
So many things you dont want to do  
What is it What have you got to lose  
What the hell  
What is you think youre gonna find  
Hypocrite  
Boredom sets into the boring mind  
  
Struggle within it suits you fine  
Struggle within your ruin  
Struggle within you seal your own coffin  
Struggle within the struggling within  
Home is not a home it becomes a hell  
Turning it into your prison cell  
Advantages are taken not handed out  
While you struggle inside your hell  
Reaching out  
Grabbing for something youve got to feel  
Closing in  
The pressure upon you is so real  
  
Struggle within it suits you fine  
Struggle within your ruin  
Struggle within you seal your own coffin  
Struggle within the struggling within  
  
Reaching out for something youve got to feel  
While clutching to what you had thought was real  
What the hell  
What is you think youre gonna find  
Hypocrite  
Boredom sets into the boring mind  
  
Struggle within it suits you fine  
Struggle within your ruin  
Struggle within you seal your own coffin  
Struggle within the struggling within
