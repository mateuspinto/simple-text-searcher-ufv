Lord I lift my voice in praise to You  
For the love You placed inside of me  
Lord I give my life my heart and soul  
To You alone  
  
And with every breath that comes from me  
Will flow Your mercy and Your grace  
Proclaiming love and liberty  
For all who have an ear to hear  
  
Chorus  
And Your love  
Stirs faith and hope in me  
And Your grace  
Brings power to set this sinner free  
And Your blood  
Pours joy into my life  
Jesus You gave it all for me
