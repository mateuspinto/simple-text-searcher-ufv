Oh Ms Believer  
My pretty sleeper  
Your twisted mind is like snow on the road  
Your shaking shoulders prove that its colder  
Inside your head in the winter of death  
  
I will tell you I love you  
But the muffs on your ears will cater your fears  
My nose and feet are running as we start  
To travel through snow  
Together we go 2x  
  
We get colder  
As we grow older  
We will walk so much slower  
  
Oh Ms Believer  
My pretty weeper  
Your twisted thoughts are like snow on the rooftops  
Please take my hand  
Were in foreign land  
As we travel through snow  
Together we go 2x  
  
We get colder  
As we grow older  
We will walk so much slower
