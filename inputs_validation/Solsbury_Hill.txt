Climbing up on Solsbury Hill  
I could see the city light  
Wind was blowing time stood still  
Eagle flew out of the night  
He was something to observe  
Came in close I heard a voice  
Standing stretching every nerve  
I had to listen had no choice  
I did not believe the information  
I just had to trust imagination  
My heart going boom boom boom  
Son he said grab your things Ive come to take you home  
  
To keep in silence I resigned  
My friends would think I was a nut  
Turning water into wine  
Open doors would soon be shut  
So I went from day to day  
Though my life was in a rut  
Till I thought of what Id say  
And which connection I should cut  
I was feeling part of the scenery  
I walked right out of the machinery  
My heart going boom boom boom  
Son he said grab your things Ive come to take you home  
  
When illusion spin her net  
Im never where I want to be  
And liberty she pirouette  
When I think that I am free  
Watched by empty silhouettes  
Close their eyes but still can see  
No one taught them etiquette  
So I will show another me  
Today I dont need a replacement  
Ill tell them what the smile on my face meant  
My heart going boom boom boom  
Hey I said you can keep my things theyve come to take me home  
  
Come back home  
Come back home  
Come back home
