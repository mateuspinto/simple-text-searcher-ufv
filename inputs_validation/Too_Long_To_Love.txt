In fear of somthing so unheard of  
She tries to hide but she cant  
whoa oh oh  
Looking for an advantage  
Cause he is too far gone  
  
Fighting the light that shines in through the window  
Running away from what she dont know  
Breaking away from the streak that she cant hide from  
But theres not enough time to love  
her love is too long  
  
Again her stays restless  
As she hides in the dark  
Waiting for the light to break through  
As the wall begins to fall  
oh its so strong  
  
Fighting the light that shines in through the window  
Running away from what she dont know  
Breaking away from the streak that she cant hide from  
But theres not enough time to love  
her love is too long  
  
How is her love so strong  
No one can break the wall  
Trying so hard to win her  
There is too long to love  
cause  
  
Fighting the light that shines in through the window  
Running away from what she dont know  
Breaking away from the streak that she cant hide from  
But theres not enough time to love  
her love is too long
