Several years ago  
In a foreign town  
Far away from home  
I met the Count of Tuscany  
  
A young eccentric man  
Bred from royal blood  
Took me for a ride  
Across the open countryside  
  
Get into my car  
Lets go for drive  
I love the way I feel uptight  
Just step inside  
  
Maybe youll recall  
I kind of felt curious  
A character inspired by my brothers life  
  
Winding through the hills  
Seeing far behind  
On and on we drove  
Down narrow streets and dusty roads  
  
And last we came upon  
A picturesque estate  
On sprawling emerald hills  
An ancient world of times gone by  
  
Now let me introduce  
My brother  
A bitter gentleman  historian  
Sucking on his pipe  
Distinguished accent  
Making me uptight  no accident  
  
I  
Want to stay alive  
Everything about this place just doesnt feel right  
  
I  
I dont wanna die  
Suddenly Im frightened for my life  
  
I  
Want to say goodbye  
This could be the last time you see me alive  
  
I  
I may not survive  
Knew it from the moment we arrived  
  
Would you like to see  
Our secret holy place  
I come here late at night  
To pray to him by candle light  
  
Then viewing through the past  
I saw which is believed  
Still dressed in royal clothes  
A saint behind the altar  
  
History recalls  
During times of war  
Legend has been traced  
Stuck inside these castle walls  
  
Soldiers came to hide  
With barrels filled with wine  
Never to escape  
These tombs of old thats where they died  
  
Down the cellar stairs  
I disappear  
Like the angels share  
The end is near  
  
Come and have a taste  
A rare vintage  
All the finest wines  
Improve with age  
  
I  
Want to stay alive  
Everything about this place just doesnt feel right  
  
I  
I dont wanna die  
Suddenly Im frightened for my life  
  
I  
Want to say goodbye  
This could be the last time you see me alive  
  
I  
I may not survive  
Knew it from the moment we arrived  
  
Could this be the end  
Is this the way I die  
Sitting here alone  
No one by my side  
  
I dont understand  
I dont feel that I deserve this  
What did I do wrong  
I just dont understand  
  
Give me one more chance  
Let me please explain  
Its all been circumstance  
Ill tell you once again  
  
It took me for a ride  
Promising a vast adventure  
Next thing that I know  
Im frightened for my life  
  
Now wait a minute then  
Thats not how it is  
You must be confused  
That isnt who I am  
  
Please dont be afraid  
I would never try to hurt you  
This is how we live  
Strange although it seems  
Please try to forgive  
  
The chapel and the Sade  
The soldiers in the wine  
The fables and the tales  
All handed down through time  
  
Of course youre free to go  
Go and tell the world my story  
Tell about my brother  
Tell them about me  
The Count of Tuscany
