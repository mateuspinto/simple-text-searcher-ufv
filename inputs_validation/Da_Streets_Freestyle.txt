Fabolous  
Uh yeah  
Im back thats right  
Ghetto Fuckin Fab niggas  
Street Family  
Desert Storm  
Get it on  
  
Verse Fabolous  
I slide through in the name of the streets  
In the Range with the feets  
With TV screens in the frames of the seats  
Im a pimp that slides into dames that I meet  
I rather just slide slugs in the chambers of heat  
Im the reason other rookies in the game couldnt eat  
Im the player Ly put in the game as a cheat  
Yall just tryin to slide in the game in my cleats  
Yall could never be a ghetto superstar like me  
Whats the matter you confused  
I aint flattered or amused  
I dont know who put em in or what batteries they use  
But I got a clip for the slugs fatter than a fuse  
The rat tat tatta from the Uz  
That tell you  
Nobody do it sooner than son  
And he walk around with stones that look like the moon and the sun  
You know its real when another artists street teams comin  
Up to me askin me when Street Dreams comin nigga
