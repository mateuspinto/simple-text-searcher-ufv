Chorus  
Willow is a player  
Shes got me going crazy crazy  
Shes got me wrapped around her finger  
Shes got me going out of my mind playing all the time  
Willow is a player  
Shes got me going crazy crazy  
Shes got me wrapped around her finger  
Shes got me going out of my mind playing all the time  
  
Every time I see her cant help but to smile smile smile  
And every time I touch her touch her she make me feel like a child feel
like a child  
She got me locked up  
Got me locked locked up  
I do just about anything anything to stay on her good side  
And when she want something something from me she wont be denied  
Cant even go shopping shopping without buying her a gift  
Every eye tied to her as she steps out the crib steps out the crib  
She keeps me up all night night on my knees as I pray pray  
Cause I cant sleep till sleep till I know shes okay  
She got me locked up  
Got me locked  locked up  
  
Chorus  
  
I saw another man hold her  
Just a friendly hello  
I know it was nothing nothing but he took to long to let go  
I think you better let her go  
Let my girl girl girl girl go go  
I try to be tough though so strong  
Sometimes she makes me so mad so mad  
Her eyes like diamonds diamonds make me forget shes so bad shes so bad  
Shes my angel angel  
This world shes not of  
Sent from the upstairs upstairs  
Taught me that new kind of love love love love  
I cant tell why yall dont understand what she means in my life the world
to me  
What make it so crazy crazy I met her through my wife  
She got me locked up  
Got me locked locked up  
  
Chorus
