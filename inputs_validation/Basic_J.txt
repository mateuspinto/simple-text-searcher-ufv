Jo the waiter spilling wine  
Over some exfriends of mine  
In zero cafe number 9  
What you gonna say this time  
  
Basic J say are you new here  
  
New ones walking down the stairs  
Pretty young thing but noone cares  
Jo the waiter drops the tray  
Do you always know your name  
  
Jo the waiter smiled at me  
Jo the waiters company  
I keep him in a book by my fireside  
A drama is my perfect bride
