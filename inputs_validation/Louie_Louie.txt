Fine little girl she waits for me  
Me catch the ship for cross the sea  
Me said the ship all alone  
Me never think me make it home  
  
Louie Louie me gotta go  
Louie Louie me gotta go  
  
Three nights and days me sail the sea  
Me think of girl constantly  
On the ship I dream she there  
I smell the rose in her hair  
  
Louie Louie me gotta go  
Louie Louie me gotta go  
  
Me see Jamaica moon above  
It wont be long me see my love  
I take her in my arms and then  
Me tell her I never leave again  
  
Louie Louie me gotta go  
Louie Louie me gotta go
