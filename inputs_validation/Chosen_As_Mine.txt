Here I am so close to you  
Know My voice Ill never leave you  
For I have loved you since before  
The sands of time were made  
I love you still and always will  
Youre chosen as Mine  
My Father wants to bless you now  
Receive from Him all that youll ever need  
Come spend eternity with Me  
My hearts full of love for you  
I love you still and always will  
Youre chosen as Mine  
Cries in the desert My child I hear them  
Tears in the valley My lovely I count them  
Youre so precious you were on My mind as I died  
Here I am so close to you  
Know My voice Ill never leave you  
For I have loved you since before  
The sands of time were made  
I love you still and always will  
Youre chosen as Mine  
Cries in the desert My child I hear them  
Tears in the valley My lovely I count them  
Youre so precious you were on My mind as I died  
I love you as I died for you because I  
Incomprehensible  
I love you still always will  
Youre chosen as Mine  
I love you I love you  
Oh Incomprehensible I do  
Oh yeah oh yeah
