As I was out walking on the corner one day  
I spied an old hobo in the doorway he lay  
His face was all covered in the cold sidewalk floor  
I guess hed been there for a whole night or more  
  
He was only a hobo but one more is gone  
Leaving nobody to carry it on  
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song  
Only a hobo but one more is gone  
  
A blanket of newspaper covered his head  
The step was his pillow  
The street was his bed  
One look at his face  
showed the hard road hed come  
and a fistful of money  
showed the coins that hed bummed  
  
He was only a hobo but one more is gone  
Leavin nobody to sing his sad song  
Leavin nobody to carry it on  
Only a hobo but one more is gone  
  
Does it take much of a man  
to see a whole life go down  
To look on the world  
from a hole in the ground  
Too late for your future  
like a horse thats gone lame  
To lie in the gutter  
and die with no name  
  
He was only a hobo but one more is gone  
Leavin nobody to sing his sad song  
Leavin nobody to carry it on  
Only a hobo but one more is gone
