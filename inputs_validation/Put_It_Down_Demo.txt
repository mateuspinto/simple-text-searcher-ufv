My show  
  
Put it down they move this town  
They follow with their eyes  
Ice cold kisses fierce surprise  
A good a good disguise  
Is all you need to bleed a situation  
  
You know  
  
Pull it back and put on attack  
Admission in your eyes  
Ice cold kisses compromise  
A good a good disguise  
Is all you need to bleed a situation  
  
Let go  
  
Put it down they move this town  
They follow with their eyes  
Ice cold kisses terrorize  
A good a good disguise  
Is all you need to bleed a situation  
  
I could pull it with a bullet  
Down in seven shine a light boy  
I could pull it with a bullet  
What a wasted revolution  
  
I could pull it with a bullet  
Im a white boy need confusion  
I could pull it with a bullet  
Were all out together together forever
