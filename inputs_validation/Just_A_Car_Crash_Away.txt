Love is a fire  
Burns down all that it sees  
Burns down everything  
Everything you think burnt down  
Everything you say  
  
She blew me her deathkiss and the mouthmarks bled down my eyes  
Like her dying on my windshield I can already feel her worms eating my spine  
So how can it be this lonely  
Is this all we get for our lives Is love only sweeter when one of us dies  
  
Then I knew that our love was just a car crash away  
I knew that our love was just a car crash away  
I knew that our love was just a car crash away  
I knew that our love was just a car crash away  
  
Love is a fire  
Burns down all that it sees  
Burns down everything  
Everything you think burns down  
Everything you say  
Love is a fire  
Burns down all that it sees  
Burns down everything  
Everything you think burns down  
Everything you say  
Love is a fire  
Burns down all that it sees  
Burns down everything  
Everything you think burns down  
Everything you say  
  
I knew that our love was just a car crash away  
Knew that our love was just a car crash away just a car crash away  
  
Everything you think  
Everything you think  
Everything you think burns down  
Everything you say  
  
Love is a fire  
Burns down all that it sees  
Burns down everything  
Everything you think burns down  
Everything you say
