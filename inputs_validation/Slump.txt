From front to back street listen we on a mission  
To get right workin street corner in the midnight  
Picture the scene these fiends with fire  
Ten dollar dreams scheme for a sack of that believe that  
Im wit whateva like Wheatstraw  
Stuck servin my cocaine raw  
Drop sixty two off the brick jump back  
Twenty over now thats mo money to get  
Slick we fin to lick on this corner without gettin caught  
But time keep a sleepin and money gettin short  
Plus that crooked cop Brock think we blow slangin fuck him  
That why he ride through the hole with the do swangin  
But I make moves shake them tricks up out they shoestrings  
Be more precise when we do things  
Cause life like shakin the dice but I buck back twice  
Like fivedeuce fotrey okay  
  
Chorus x2  
Im strickly dressin dirty dirty  
Gone represent it to the ttop  
Born and bred up on the street top  
Get to the money and the sweet spot  
And forever hollerin  
Hootie Hoo when we see cops  
  
Sheyit  
Cops and robbers niggaz be bound to get them dollars and cents  
They get in a slump like baseball players  
When they short on they rent  
Anything goin you aint knowin how much money YOU spent  
But in the real world you surrounded by these ladies and gents  
Who hang around you cause you be buyin all the weed  
And all the chicken  
Feedin everybody smokin em out  
When you was broke though they was missin  
Now you ridin bout fo deep startin to tear up yo suspension  
And your baby mamma on child support  
My fault forget to mention  
You dont even have a checkin account  
Wasnt thinkin about no pension  
I used to work at Steak N Ale Old Gold off in the kitchen  
Had determination and graduated  
Now I got the whole rap world fascinated  
I wanted a piece of the pie for me and my family so I made it  
Continue to sell dope its payin the bills so you gon do it  
But legislation got this new policy  
Three strikes and youre ruined now where your crew at  
Yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Ay  
Me and my buddy on the cut and they know we servin em slabs  
We better watch what we doin and look out for Joe Nab  
And quit reinup and standin on this same old block  
Before our gangsta ass partna get both of us shot  
Niggaz talkin cause they makin some flow  
But still aint did nuttin that aint been done befo  
You cant be tryin to showcase just put it down for your spot  
And improvise and work with that little you got  
So I think when I finish sellin my last sack  
Ima take some of this money go and give some back  
Cause people wont forget about the time you gave knowmsayin  
And start thinkin bout a path to pave  
  
Chorus
