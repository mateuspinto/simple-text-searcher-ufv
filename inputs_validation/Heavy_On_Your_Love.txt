Im gettin heavy on your love  
Every night  
Gettin ready for your love  
With all of my might  
I was crazy for your love  
Never stayed around you love  
Aw but you make me deadly  
  
I was lost but now Ive found  
Havin you around has made me heavy  
Heavy on your love  
  
Heavy on your love  
Old enough to wait  
Got a letter full of love  
And its just about to break  
Cause my love was never real  
I could touch but never feel  
Ah but you make me deadly  
  
I was lost but now Ive found  
Havin you around has made me heavy  
Heavy on your love
