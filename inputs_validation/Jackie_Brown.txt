Is this your life Jackie Brown  
Poorly educated and forced to live on the poor side of town  
Is this your daughter Jackie Brown  
This pretty little girl  
In the worn out clothes  
That have been handme down  
Is this your wife Jackie Brown  
With sad blue eyes walking on eggshells so you dont see her frown  
Is this your family Jackie Brown  
  
Dream of vacationing on a mountain stream  
And giving the world more than it gave you  
What ugly truths freedom brings  
And it hasnt been very kind to you  
Is this your life Jackie Brown  
  
Is this your meal Jackie Brown  
Barely enough Ive seen people throw more than this out  
Is this your home Jackie Brown  
This three room shack  
With no running water  
And the bathroom out back  
Is this your grave Jackie Brown  
This little piece of limestone that says another desperate man took  
Himself out  
Is this your dream Jackie Brown  
  
Going nowhere and nowhere fast  
We shame ourselves to watch people like this live  
But who gives a damn about Jackie Brown  
Just another lazy man who couldnt take what was his  
One helluva life Jackie Brown  
Forevermore Jackie Brown  
Amen and amen  Jackie Brown
