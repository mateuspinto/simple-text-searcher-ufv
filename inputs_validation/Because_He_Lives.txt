God sent His Son they called Him Jesus  
He came to love heal and forgive  
He lived and died to buy my pardon  
An empty grave is there to prove my Saviour lives  
  
Because He lives I can face tomorrow  
Because He lives all fear is gone  
Because I know He holds the future  
And life is worth the living just because He lives  
  
How sweet to hold a new born baby  
And feel the pride a joy he gives  
But greater still the calm assurance  
This child can face uncertain days because He lives  
  
Because He lives I can face tomorrow  
Because He lives all fear is gone  
Because I know He holds the future  
And life is worth the living just because He lives  
  
And then one day Ill cross the river  
Ill fight lifes final war with pain  
And then as death gives way to victry  
Ill see the lights of glory and Ill know He lives  
  
Because He lives I can face tomorrow  
Because He lives all fear is gone  
Because I know He holds the future  
And life is worth the living just because He lives
