Surrender your cloth and collar priest  
Theres no need for your beliefs in war  
This is a place for heathens  
Into that darkness fires illuminate  
  
Grotesquely swollen by the heat  
A halfburned corpse hanging naked  
A stream is poisoned by the dead  
In the ghostly light debris of war  
  
Lead us to the brink of extinction  
The time has come for you now to finish it  
  
What has man become a funeral pyre  
Now that judgments near prepare to die  
Need to suffer lust for power  
Mindless hunger never win  
Final six is here the cycle ends  
  
I have come for you my child  
And the gift I bring is murder  
Sumerian death in eastern winds  
Face the father of your terror  
  
Godless warheads wait to breathe  
Set their sights on history  
Distant silhouettes of the dead  
Blacken face screams through the ashes  
  
Lead us to the brink of extinction  
The time has come for you now to finish it  
  
What has man become a funeral pyre  
Now that judgments near prepare to die  
Need to suffer lust for power  
Mindless hunger never win  
Final six is here the cycle ends  
  
Mankind owes his pain to hell  
As he brings the end upon himself  
Arms rising from the ashes  
In the ghastly light of human flares  
  
Berith soldiers capture souls  
Shadows of human sacrifice  
The return of everything thats dead  
A cryptic promise from the heavens  
  
Lead us to the brink of extinction  
The time has come for you now to finish it  
  
Dead flowers for a faceless dead  
A city engulfed by the smell of the death  
Bodies piled beneath the mist  
Walking dead among the living  
  
The world will bleed while horseman ride  
Now that God has wept for Judas  
Days are numbered find your grave  
Forever trying to escape to hell
