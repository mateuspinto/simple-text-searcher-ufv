Its Courtney bitch  
Rat a tat tat Rat a tat tat hey  
No thesis existed for burning cities down at such a rampant rate  
No graphics and no fucking PowerPoint presentation  
So they just DIYd that shit and built their own bombs  
Shes his suicide blond shes never in gold  
  
Are you ready for another bad poem  
One more off key anthem  
Let your teeth sink in  
Remember me as I was not as I am  
And I said Ill check in tomorrow if I dont wake up dead  
I kept wishing she had blonde ambition and shed let it go to my head  
  
Rat a tat tat  
Rat a tat tat tat hey  
If my love is a weapon  
Theres no second guessing when I say  
Rat a tat tat  
Rat a tat tat tat hey  
If my heart is a grenade  
You pull the pin and say  
  
Were all fighting growing old  
Were all fighting growing old  
In the hopes  
Of a few minutes more  
To get on St Peters list  
But you need to lower your standards  
Cause its never  
Getting any better than this  
  
We are professional ashes of roses  
This kerosenes live  
You settled your score  
This is where you come to beg unborn and unshaven  
Killing fields of fire to a congress of ravens  
This is what we do we nightmare you  
  
Im about to make the sweat roll backwards  
And your heart beat in reverse  
Our guts cant be reworked  
As alone as a little white church in the middle of the desert  
Getting burned  
But Ill take your heart served up two ways  
I sing a bitter song  
Im the lonelier version of you  
I just dont know where it went wrong  
  
Rat a tat tat  
Rat a tat tat tat hey  
If my love is a weapon  
Theres no second guessing when I say  
Rat a tat tat  
Rat a tat tat tat hey  
If my heart is a grenade  
You pull the pin and say  
  
Were all fighting growing old  
Were all fighting growing old  
In the hopes  
Of a few minutes more  
To get on St Peters list  
But you need to lower your standards  
Cause its never  
Getting any better than this  
  
Rat a tat tat Rat a tat tat tat hey  
Its never  
Getting any better than this  
Rat a tat tat Rat a tat tat tat hey  
Its never  
Getting any better than this  
Rat a tat tat Rat a tat tat tat hey  
Its never  
Getting any better than this  
Rat a tat tat Rat a tat tat tat hey  
Its never  
Getting any better than this  
  
Shes sick and shes wrong  
Shes young dirty blonde  
And you sink inside her like a suicide bomb  
He says Ive seen bigger  
She says Ive lit better  
And they throw the matches down into the glitter  
Not a dry eye left in the house  
Go boy go boy run for your life  
Go boy go boy run for your life  
Go boy go boy run for your life  
  
Were all fighting growing old  
Were all fighting growing old  
In the hopes  
Of a few minutes more  
To get on St Peters list  
But you need to lower your standards  
Cause its never  
Getting any better than this  
  
Rat a tat tat Rat a tat tat tat hey  
Its never  
Getting any better than this  
Rat a tat tat Rat a tat tat tat hey  
Its never  
Getting any better than this  
Rat a tat tat Rat a tat tat tat hey  
Its never  
Getting any better than this  
Rat a tat tat Rat a tat tat tat hey  
Its never  
Getting any better than this  
  
Are you ready for another bad poem
