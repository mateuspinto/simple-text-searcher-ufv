Well its up in the mornin  
Everybody off and runnin  
Everybody got some place to be  
Some people never go walkin  
Some people just stop talkin  
And I was slippin away  
You came and pulled me through  
I want to stay in the land of the living with you  
  
I want to stay in the land of the living  
I want to stay here with you  
I want to stay in the land of the living  
I want to stay here with you  
  
We work and we worry  
This old worlds in such a hurry  
So many things we just dont see  
Some people always cryin  
Some people just stop tryin  
And I was slippin away  
You came and pulled me though  
I want to stay in the land of the living with you  
  
We got to do what we can about all this pain and sorrow  
But try to live just a little  
We could all be gone tomorrow  
When I look at you girl my heart rejoices  
You taught me somethin  
Considering the choices  
  
I want to stay in the land of the living  
I want to stay here with you  
I want to stay in the land of the living  
I want to stay here with you
