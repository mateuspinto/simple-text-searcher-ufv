Well I drank till I stumbled  
I drank till I fell  
When the drunk part was over it hurt me like hell  
I know about drinkin  
So I know one things true  
Being drunks a lot like loving you  
  
Cause I loved till I stumbled  
I loved till I fell  
When the loving was over it hurt me like hell  
Now I what a taste of the wrong love can do  
Being drunks a lot like lovin you  
  
And Ive woke up some mornings and sworn off the drink  
And at that Ive done reasonably well I think  
But I havent done well swearing off you and me  
At that Ive failed miserably  
  
Well I felt the hangover of loving all night  
Ive sat at the bar all alone in a fight  
Ive bottled up feelings and poured them out too  
Being drunks a lot like loving you  
  
And Ive woke up some mornings and sworn off the drink  
And at that Ive done reasonably well I think  
But I havent done well swearing off you and me  
At that Ive failed miserably  
  
Well I drank till I stumbled  
I loved till I fell  
When the drunk part was over love hurt me like hell  
Now I know about drinkin so I know one things true  
Being drunks a lot like loving you  
  
Though I know what a taste of the wrong love can do  
Sometimes I still get drunk loving you
