Standin on the corner  
Of Toulouse and Dauphine  
Waitin on MarieOndine  
Im tryin to place a tune  
Under a Louisiana moonbeam  
On the planet of New Orleans  
  
In a bar they call The Saturn  
And in her eyes of green  
And somethin that she said in a dream  
Inside of my suit I got my mojo root  
And a true love figurine  
For the planet of New Orleans  
  
New Orleans  the other planet  
With other life upon it  
And everythin thats shakin in between  
If you should ever land upon it  
You better know whats on it  
The planet of New Orleans  
  
Now Im tryin to find my way  
Through the rain and the steam  
Im lookin straight ahead through the screen  
And then I heard her say  
Somethin in the Limousine  
Bout takin a ride across the planet of New Orleans  
  
If she was an ace  
And I was just a jack  
And the cards were never seen  
We could have been the king and queen  
But she took me back to her courtyard  
Where magnolia perfume screams  
Behind the gates and the granite  
Of the planet of New Orleans
