A little space a little time see what it can do  
A little faith peace of mind see what passes through  
The sun will shine on you again a bell will ring inside your head  and all
will be brand new  
  
Come alive come on in heres something that you know  
The worlds as wide as your life is thin So entertain your goals  
The sun will shine on you again a bell will ring inside your head  and all
will be brand new  
  
All will be brand new  
  
I can tell you what you want to hear Ive been there once before  
You pulled me through my empty nights sleepless on your floor  
The sun will shine on you again a bell will ring inside your head  and all
will be brand new  
  
And all will be brand new  
And all will be brand new
