Yours til the stars lose their glory  
Yours til the birds fail to sing  
Yours to the end of lifes story  
This pledge to you dear I bring  
  
Yours in the grey of December  
Here or on far distant shores  
  
Ive never loved anyone the way I love you  
How could I when I was born to be  
Just yours  
  
This night has music the sweetest music  
It echoes somewhere within my heart  
I hold you near me oh darling hear me  
I have a message I must impart  
  
Just yours  
When I was born to be just yours
