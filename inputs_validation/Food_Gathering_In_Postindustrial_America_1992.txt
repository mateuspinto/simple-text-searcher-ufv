Food Gathering In PostIndustrial America 1992  
  
When the last decrepit factory has dumped its final load of toxic waste into
the water supply and shipped its last badly manufactured incompetently
designed consumer thing we gaze in astonishment as the denizens of NUPERFECT
AMERICA dine on rats mmmmm poodles Styrofoam packing pellets all
floating in a broth of tritiumenriched sewage roasting the least diseased
body parts of abandoned wild children accumulating since the total ban on
abortion a few years back
