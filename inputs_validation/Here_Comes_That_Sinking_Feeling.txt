Here Comes That Sinking Feeling  
  
Have you ever heard the sound of disappointment  
It tangles your head like a winter rose  
Comes up eager and shining  
And it likes to leave a scar before it goes  
  
Here comes that sinking feeling  
Cant keep it to myself  
  
Nobody hurts me like you do  
You cut into me like a poison dart  
Creep into my sleep at night  
Break into my dreams and tear them apart  
  
Here comes that sinking feeling  
  
Have you ever felt the sound of disappointment  
It pounds in your head like hammer blows  
Comes on gentle and smiling  
And it likes to leave a scar  
Here it comes again no  
Here comes that sinking feeling
