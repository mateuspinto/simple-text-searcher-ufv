You are everything I need to see  
Smile and sunlight makes sunlight to me  
Laugh and come and look into me  
Drips of moonlight washing over me  
Can I show you what you want from me  
  
Angel of mine can I thank you  
You have saved me time and time again  
Angel I must confess  
Its you that always gives me strength  
And I dont know where Id be without you  
  
After all these years one thing is true  
Constant force within my heart is you  
You touch me I feel Im moving into you  
I treasure every day I spend with you  
All the things I am come down to you  
  
Angel of mine  
Let me thank you  
You have saved me time and time again  
Angel I must confess  
Its you that always gives me strength  
And I dont know where Id be without you  
  
Back in the arms of my angel  
Back to the peace that I so love  
Back in the arms of my angel I can finally rest  
Giving you a gift that you remind me  
  
Angel of mine  
Let me thank you  
You have saved me time and time and time and time again  
Angel I must confess  
Its you that always gives me strength  
And I dont know where Id be without you  
  
Angel of mine  
Can I thank you  
You have saved me time and time again  
Angel I must confess  
Its you that always gives me strength  
And I dont know where Id be without you  
 Without you
