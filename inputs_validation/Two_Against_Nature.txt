Bad news breaking in 18A  
Missys Kitty turn inside out she say  
Spider queen demon and that whole crew  
Across the lobby the wicker wing chair flew  
  
All the nice people those goodly souls  
Quaking in their respective hidey holes  
Everyones wasted in this gruesome dream  
Not a one of them left to hear you scream  
  
Chorus  
Two against nature dont you know  
Whos gonna grok the shape of things to go  
Two against nature make them groan  
Whos gonna break the shape of things unknown  
  
Madame Erzulie she come last night  
Bang you silly but leave a nasty bite  
There on your nightstand much worse than that  
Panatella and old black derby hat  
  
Call your doctor call your shrink  
Western science she strictly rinky dink  
They all masissi but we hang tough  
Apsatively gonna help you beat that stuff  
  
Chorus  
  
Two against nature tan and lean  
Puttin big heat on skanky things unseen  
Two against nature slinging dread  
These boys want to bang the skulls of things undead  
  
TBone Angie she champion liar  
Sew the mouth shut with rusty chicken wire  
Brother Lou Garue and the Jerry Garry  
Sprinkling chicken water gonna hush all three  
  
Beautiful housewife in deep distress  
Specially you deserve the very best  
Two against nature they got that stuff  
Good things happening when you see about us  
  
Chorus  
  
Two against nature love this gig  
Pull up the weeds before theyre too damn big  
Two against nature stand alone  
Whos gonna chase the shape of things unknown  
  
Two against nature dont you know  
Whos gonna drop the boom on things to go  
Two against nature make them groan  
Gonna go bangzoom to the moon on things unknown  
  
Scrape the wallboards the whole damn batch  
Catch the maggoty eggs before they hatch  
Pepper and ratbone make damn sure  
Shake the rubbish out on the patio floor  
  
Soak the timber with special spray  
Nuke the itty bitty ones right where they lay  
Whip the bastards while they still green  
Take the firemop sweep it kissing clean
