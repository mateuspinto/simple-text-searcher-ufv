The clouds prepare for combat  
In the ever expanding world  
Of nuclear attacks and global destruction  
An invisable circle of silence  
Errupts inside your abdomen  
Eye to eye no one speaks  
Who will be more obsecure  
Evil lingers around us  
And no one seeks to destroys us  
Prepare for interrogation  
With the immaculate nucleus  
With imminent imaginations  
Through the magic of fascination  
  
Do not go outside the invisable door  
Cause nobody else seems to disappear  
As long as all of us are there  
Throughout the wear and tear  
Of dreams past and present  
  
Here we are on the planet Evilville  
Put your head above the sky and detonate  
All your phantom fears and all of your dangers that might kill  
And why do I the power however  
To destroy our destiny  
And the power to overcome this buzzkill  
Comes from underneath the earth  
  
Do not go outside the invisable door  
Cause nobody else seems to disappear  
As long as all of us are there  
Throughout the wear and tear  
Of dreams past and present
