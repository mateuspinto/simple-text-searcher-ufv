I got home late this evening stumbled up the stair  
I couldnt believe my eyes when I looked in the bedroom there  
My woman with a man was lyin fast asleep  
I felt a rage inside me control I couldnt keep  
  
She was a cheater  
  
I reached the dressing table kicked away the door  
I gripped the cold black metal a loaded 44  
By this time theyre awake and they dont know what to do  
I scream you cheatin bitch heres what I think of you  
  
You are a cheater  
  
They both pleaded for mercy I said no way  
When you do this upon me you have no say  
I treated you so real good and this is what you do  
Oh no Ive finished with you your time is through  
  
You are a cheater  
  
If you need a cheater theres nobody sweeter than this one  
Theres no neater come on here and meet her  
Cheater cheater cheater come on and meet her
