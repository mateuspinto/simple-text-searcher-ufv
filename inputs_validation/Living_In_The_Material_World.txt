Im living in the material world  
Living in the material world  
  
cant say what Im doing here  
But I hope to see much clearer  
After living in the material world  
  
I got born into the material world  
Getting worn out in the material world  
Use my body like a car  
Taking me both near and far  
Met my friends all in the material world  
  
Met them all there in the material world  
John and Paul here in the material world  
Though we started out quite poor  
We got Richie on a tour  
Got caught up in the material world  
  
From the Spiritual Sky  
Such sweet memories have I  
To the Spiritual Sky  
How I pray  
Yes I pray  
That I wont get lost  
Or go astray  
  
As Im fated for the material world  
Get frustrated in the material world  
Senses never gratified  
Only swelling like a tide  
That could drown me in the  
Material world  
  
From the Spiritual Sky  
Such sweet memories have I  
To the Spiritual Sky  
How I pray  
Yes I pray  
That I wont get lost  
Or go astray  
  
While Im living in the material world  
Not much giving in the material world  
Got a lot of work to do  
Try to get a message through  
And get back out of this material world  
  
Im living in the material world  
Living in the material world  
I hope to get out of this place  
By the LORD SRI KRSNAS GRACE  
My salvation from the material world  
Big Ending
