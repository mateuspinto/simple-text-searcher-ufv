Those crazy nights I do remember in my youth  
I do recall those were the best times most of all  
In the heat with a blue jean girl  
Burnin love comes once in a lifetime  
She found me singing by the rail road track  
Took me home we danced by moonlight  
  
Chorus  
Those summer nights are callin  
Stone in love  
Cant help myself Im fallin  
Stone in love  
  
Old dusty roads led to the river  
Runnin slow  
She pulled me down and in clover  
Wed go round  
In the heat with a blue jean girl  
Burnin love comes once in a lifetime  
Oo the memories never fade away  
Golden girl Ill keep you forever  
  
Chorus
