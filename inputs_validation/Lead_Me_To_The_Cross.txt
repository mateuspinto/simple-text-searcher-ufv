Savior I come  
Quiet my soul remember  
Redemptions hill  
Where Your blood was spilled  
For my ransom  
Everything I once held dear  
I count it all as lost  
  
Chorus  
Lead me to the cross  
Where Your love poured out  
Bring me to my knees  
Lord I lay me down  
Rid me of myself  
I belong to You  
Lead me lead me to the cross  
  
You were as I  
Tempted and trialed  
You are  
The word became flesh  
Bore my sin and death  
Now youre risen  
  
Everything I once held dear  
I count it all as lost  
  
Chorus  
  
To your heart  
To your heart  
Lead me to your heart  
Lead me to your heart  
  
Chorus x2
