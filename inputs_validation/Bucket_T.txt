Bucket bucket T T bucket T bucket T  
Bucket bucket T T bucket T bucket T  
Bucket bucket T T bucket T bucket T  
  
Found her in a barn in Tennessee  
I paid five bucks for my Bucket T  
Took me three years of sweat and blood  
To clean off all that Tennessee mud  
  
Chorus  
My Bucket T Bucket T  
Bucket T Bucket T  
My Bucket T Bucket T  
My Bucket T Bucket T  
T T T Bucket bucket bucket  
  
Cruise down the street in front of school  
I wanna rev it up but I gotta be cool  
Drivin down the road Ill get my kicks  
Apoppin the clutch and aslippin the sticks  
  
Chorus  
  
I was right too shes first in her class  
Theres nothing on the freeway she dont pass  
All the girls want to take a ride with me  
But theres only one seat in my Bucket T  
  
Chorus
