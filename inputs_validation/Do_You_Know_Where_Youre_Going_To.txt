Do You Know Where Youre Going To  
  
Do you know where youre going to  
Do you like the things that life is showing you  
Where are you going to  
Do you know  
Do you get what youre hoping for  
When you look behind you theres no open door  
What are you hoping for  
Do you know  
Once we were standing still in time  
Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds  
You knew how I loved you but my spirit was free  
Laughing at the questions that you once asked of me  
  
Do you know where youre going to  
Do you like the things that life is showing you  
Where are you going to  
Do you know  
  
Now looking back at all weve had  
We let so many dreams just slip through our hands  
Why must we wait so long before we see  
How sad the answers to those questions can be  
  
Do you know where youre going to  
Do you like the things that life is showing you  
Where are you going to  
Do you know  
Do you get what youre hoping for  
When you look behind you theres no open door  
What are you hoping for  
Do you know
