Gotta be crazy you gotta be mean  
Gotta keep your shoes and your car clean  
Gotta keep smiling you gotta keep fit  
You gotta keep drinking you gotta eat shit  
  
You gotta be small to be a big shot  
Gotta eat meat to stay at the top  
You gotta be trusted you gotta tell lies  
Gotta be able to narrow your eyes  
  
You gotta believe theyve gotta believe you  
Gotta appear to be easy to see through  
Gotta be sure you look good on tv  
Gotta resemble a human being  
  
You gotta keep one eye over your shoulder  
Gonna get harder as you get older  
Gotta fly south and hide in the sand  
Gotta forget that your gonna get cancer  
  
And when you lose control  
Youll reap the harvest you have sown  
And as the fear grows  
The bad blood slows and turns to stone  
And its to late to loose the weight you used to need to throw around  
So have a good drown as you go down alone  
Dragged down by the stone  
  
You gotta be sure you gotta be quick  
Gotta divide the tame from the sick  
Gotta keep all of us docile and fit  
You gotta keep everyone buying this shit  
  
They gotta get you started early  
Processed by the time youre thirty  
You work like fuck till your sixtyfive  
Then your times your own until you die  
  
Gotta admit to a lot of confusion  
Pain in the head is the child of collusion  
Gotta resist this creeping malaise  
Gotta believe in the way you get out of the maze  
  
But you you just keep on pretending  
You can tell a sucker from a friend  
But you still raise the knife  
To stranger lover friend and foe alike  
  
Who was born in a house full of pain  
Who was sent out to play on his own  
Who was raised on a diet of shame  
Who was trained not to spit in the fan  
Who was told what to do by the man  
Who was broken by trained personnel  
Who was fitted with bridle and bit  
Who was given a seat in the stand  
Who was forcing his way to the rails  
Who was offered a place on the board  
Who was only a stranger at home  
Who was ground down in the end  
Who was found dead on the phone  
Who was dragged down by the stone  
  
Dragged down by the stone
