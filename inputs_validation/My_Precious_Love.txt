You came to me like a dream  
How would I know it was a scheme  
To get me to you  
  
Your eyes burned like fire  
Through my heart  
Although we were life times apart  
  
Making mistakes was my game  
Your life I tried to rearrange  
But now I know a better way  
  
My precious love  
  
Now youre a woman  
Youve got a child  
And those days of being wild  
Are gone with the past  
  
But now baby you still aint got no home  
All those endless nights youve had to roam  
But I know a better way  
  
My precious love
