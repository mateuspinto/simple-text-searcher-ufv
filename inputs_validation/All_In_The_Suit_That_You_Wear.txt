Hey you someone said you were lost out there  
In the grip trying to strangle us all down here  
In the meantime are you ever gonna set us free  
Hey you will we ever get out of here  
  
Are you ever gonna surrender  
Do you even care  
Wasnt talking about sweet submission  
It wasnt even there  
  
All in the suit that you wear  
When youre looking for something  
Its in the suit that you wear  
When youre hiding from someone  
All in the suit that you wear  
When you wear it  
  
Hey you you keep awalking the razor  
On the edge you cut your feet when you stand in there  
In the meantime theres always someone to set you free  
Hey you will you ever get out of there  
  
Are you ever gonna surrender  
Do you even care  
Wasnt talking about sweet submission  
It wasnt even there  
  
All in the suit that you wear  
When youre looking for something  
Its in the suit that you wear  
When youre hiding from someone  
All in the suit that you wear  
When you wear it  
  
In the suit that you wear  
In the suit that you wear  
In the suit that you wear  
In the suit that you wear  
  
All in the suit that you wear  
When youre looking for something  
Its in the suit that you wear  
When youre hiding from someone  
All in the suit that you wear  
When you wear it  
  
All in the suit that you wear  
When you wear it  
  
All in the suit that you wear  
When you wear it
