Do you still dream of summer nights  
The endless roads between the distant lights  
Do you still find yourself  
On strange and long highways  
Drifting into unknown phase  
  
Do you still dream of summer days  
The sunlight dancing on white rolling waves  
The everlasting taste of innocent desire  
The atom splitting of its fire  
  
Do you still dream  
  
Do you see that tunnel showing any sign of light  
Does fear still wake you in the night  
  
Do you still dream
