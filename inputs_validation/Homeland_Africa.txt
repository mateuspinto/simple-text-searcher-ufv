Ship ahoi ship ahoi ship ahoi ship ahoi  
Ship ahoi ship ahoi ship ahoi ship ahoi  
Ship ahoi ship ahoi ship ahoi ship ahoi  
  
Down the ocean a ship comes sailing through the waves  
Filled with hundreds of men they take as slaves  
Just long for their true homeland africa  
And to be saved they want to be free  
Men women and babyslaves  
Coming to the land of liberty liberty  
Ship ahoi ship ahoi ship ahoi ship ahoi  
  
They are tired of waiting for a brand new day  
Some of them sing and chant some of them pray  
And some men got a little tired too  
No one knows if the journey pay  
  
Men women and babyslaves  
Coming to the land of liberty liberty  
Ship ahoi ship ahoi ship ahoi ship ahoi
