Lyrics Leah Goldberg  
Music Achinoam Nini  
  
Transliteraion  
Ulai kan nigmeret darki  
Al hasaf hashalev  
Notfim kochavim yerukim  
Leat  keholem halev  
  
Beivshat anafim yeveshah  
Birkat shlomim  
Haetsim haktanim bachorshah  
Chiku li kol hayamim  
  
Mah muzar shebikashti otcha  
Bidrachim larov  
Ad shebati al saf beitcha  
Vehu koh karov  
  
Translation  
Perhaps it is here that my road ends  
On the verge of the serene  
Greenish stars drop to my feet  
Slowly as the heart will beat  
  
A pile of brittle autumn leaves  
Bid welcome as they crack  
The small trees in the field have  
Always known that Id be back  
  
How strange that I have searched for you  
A thousand roads and more  
Until I found you  
And all this time  
You were right next door
