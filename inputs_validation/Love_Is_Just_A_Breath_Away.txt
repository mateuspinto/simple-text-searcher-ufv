Deep in the night when youre  
Away from me  
Im reachin out just to touch you  
In my dreams  
Countin the hours till youll be  
Here again  
So hard to wait got to have you  
Close to me  
cause baby  
  
You turn my nights to day  
When your love love is just a  
Breath away  
  
Somethin inside has taken  
Over me  
So baby cant you see you  
Captured my heart  
I cant disguise the things you  
Make me feel  
I should have known this was  
Magic right from the start  
  
Cause baby you turn my nights to day  
When your love love is just a breath away  
We we dont have a word to say  
Our hearts can speak a thousand ways  
When love is just a breath away  
  
Take me take me into paradise  
Show me  
All the love thats in your eyes  
Light up my life  
  
You you turn my nights to day  
When your love love is just a breath away  
We we dont have a word to say  
Our heart can speak a thousand ways  
When love is just a breath away  
You you turn my nights to day  
When your love love is just a breath away
