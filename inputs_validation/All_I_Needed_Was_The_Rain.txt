Hello misfortune hows my old friend Mr Misery  
Ive been away so long I bet you think you saw the last of me  
Got no bed to rest my head  
No doors or walls or window pane  
Now all I needed was the rain  
Rain rain rain rain  
  
Met a little honey at the Buzzin Bumble Bee Cafe  
Yes I did  
One drink and all my money and that honey bee had flown away  
Im bout as low as I can go  
I dont really mean to complain  
Now all I needed was the rain  
Rain rain rain rain  
  
All I needed was this rain  
All I needed was the rain um um
