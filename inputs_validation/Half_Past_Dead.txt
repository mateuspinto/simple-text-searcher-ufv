No wasted  
No wanting the cant have  
Untasted  
Seems everything I have  
  
Yeah ready  
Heard everything you said  
Im steady  
Even though its half past dead  
  
Welcome to the unforgiving  
Franernity of pain where  
The lines remains uncrossed  
Are entertained  
  
Greetings from the other side  
Where all has gone array here  
But in all honesty takes me away  
There  
  
See your new Jerusalem  
In saturated red  
Commencement of the requiem  
Begins at half past dead  
Half past dead  
  
Welcome to the humiliating  
Theater insane where  
Our daily theme  
Is always inhumane here  
Rebuild your shattered castles  
From ashes to the sky  
Pickup your fallen icons  
Where they lie  
There  
  
See your new Jerusalem  
In saturated red  
Commencement of the requiem  
Begins at half past dead  
Half past dead  
  
All eyes front and looking toward the sky  
Better then I do  
One step up if youre not afraid to die  
Better then you do  
  
Violent movement spawns brutality  
Better then I do  
Charging out into infinity  
Better then you do  
  
Peace comes to the war inside my head  
Better then I do  
Peace comes late the clock strikes  
Half past dead
