Duvalier was a bitter man who cursed the morning sun  
That brought a new betrayal every day  
He shunned the world of mortals and the sound of human tongues  
And blessed the night that chased their sight away  
A disillusioned dreamer who would never love again  
Whod tried of it and found that it was rotten  
Preferring perfect strangers to the company of friends  
Because strangers are so easily forgotten  
  
Oh its hard to keep believing when you know youve been deceived  
To face a lie and dare to try again but theres nothing like a woman  
With a spell of make believe to make a new believer of a man  
Duvalier took the fickle turns of fortune in his stride  
  
Expecting next to nothing out of life  
Till fortune found a girl who fanned a flame he thought had died  
Whose burning beauty cut him like a knife  
She touched him through the senses that his mind could not control  
Then smiling stepped aside and watched him fall  
Betrayed by his own body and the hunger in his soul  
Duvalier was a dreamer after all  
  
Oh its hard to keep believing when you know youve been deceived  
To face a lie and dare to try again but theres nothing like a woman  
With a spell of make believe to make a new believer of a man  
Duvalier took the fickle turns of fortune in his stride  
  
Oh its hard to keep believing when you know youve been deceived  
To face a lie and dare to try again but theres nothing like a woman  
With a spell of make believe to make a new believer of a man
