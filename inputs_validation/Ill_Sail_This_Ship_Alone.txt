If if you choose that we will always lose  
Well then Ill sail this ship alone  
And if if you decide to give him another try  
Well then Ill sail this ship alone  
  
Well they said if I wrote the perfect love song  
You would take me back  
Well I wrote it but I lost it  
And now will you take me back anyway  
  
Now if if you insist that this is for the best  
Well then Ill sail this ship alone  
And if if you swear that you no longer care  
Well then Ill sail this ship alone  
  
Ill sail this ship alone  
Between the pain and the pleasure  
Ill sail this ship alone  
Amongst the sharks and the treasure  
If you would rather go your way then go your way  
Ill sail this ship alone  
  
If if youre afraid that I wont make the grade  
Well then Ill sail this ship alone  
And if if you agree to him instead of me  
Well then Ill sail this ship alone  
  
Well they said if I wrote the perfect letter  
That I would have a chance  
Well I wrote it and you burnt it  
And now do I have a chance anyway  
  
If if you swear that you no longer care  
Well then Ill sail this ship alone  
  
Ill sail this ship alone  
Between the pain and the pleasure  
Ill sail this ship alone  
Amongst the sharks and the treasure  
If you would rather go your way then go your way  
Ill sail this ship alone  
  
Well they said if I burnt myself alive  
That youd come running back
