Seen the lights go out Broadway  
I saw the Empire State laid low  
And life went on beyond the Palisades  
They all bought Cadillacs  
And left there long ago  
  
They held a concert out in Brooklyn  
To watch the island bridges blow  
They turned our power down  
And drove us underground  
But we went right on with the show  
  
Ive seen the lights go out on Broadway  
I saw the ruins at my feet  
You know we almost didnt notice it  
Wed seen it all the time on 42nd Street  
  
They burned the churches down in Harlem  
Like in that Spanish civil war  
The flames were everywhere  
But no one really cared  
It always burned up there before  
  
Ive seen the lights go out on Broadway  
I saw the mighty skyline fall  
The boats were waiting at the Battery  
The union went on strike  
They never sailed at all  
  
They sent a carrier out from Norfolk  
And picked the Yankees up for free  
They said that Queens could stay  
They blew the Bronx away  
And sank Manhattan out at sea  
  
You know those lights were bright on Broadway  
That was so many years ago  
Before we all lived here in Florida  
Before the Mafia took over Mexico  
There are not many who remember  
They say a handful still survive  
To tell the world about  
The way the lights went out  
And keep the memory alive
