The love of my man  
Keeps me safe and warm  
The love of my man  
Protects me from all harm  
Cause I know he loves me  
And I love him so yes I do  
  
And oh the love of my man  
It makes my whole life worth living  
The love of my man  
Makes me feel just like giving  
Giving yeah  
And when his lips touch mine  
It gives me a feeling so divine  
Yes it does  
  
When he goes away  
Im never never lonely  
Cause I know he thinks of me  
He thinks of me only yes he does  
But Ill go on loving him  
Ill go on loving him anyway  
  
Oh oh oh oh  
Oh the lovethe lovethe love of my man  
Early in the morning  
I like to talk about the love of my man  
Late in the evening  
In the wee hours of the morning  
I like to talk about the love of my man  
Its good
