Hey  Hey out there knock it off will ya  
Hey give it a rest will ya Im tryin to get some sleep  
Want me to call the cops  
I tell ya Erma I cant till next week when they start to tear that damn old
theatre down  
  
The rain was hot the streets were empty  
As downtown closed her eyes  
The movie house stood in silence as I said my last goodbyes  
Her silver screen was stained with memories  
As Cagney shot them down  
And as I watched I was that hero  
In dreamlands lost and found  
  
Oh my God well we both are empty Paradise and me  
Do you believe Im still chasing rainbows  
When everywhere I see  
  
Lonely People Lonely People  
Up above these ghetto streets  
In penthouse suites they sit and stare  
Lonely People Lonely People  
They smile and say theyre fine  
But behind their eyes they just dont care  
Lonely People  
They just dont care  
Lonely People Lonely People  
  
Lonely People Lonely People  
Beneath these neon streets in subway seats they crowd for air  
Lonely People Lonely People  
So close and yet so far they share the secrets of despair  
Lonely People Lonely People repeat and fade
