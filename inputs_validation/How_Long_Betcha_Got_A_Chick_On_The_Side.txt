Betcha got a chick on the side sure you got a chick  
I know you got a chick on the side  
I know you got a chick on the side  
I know you got a chick on the side  
I know you got a chick on the side Repeat x 4  
  
I know you want us both and I know the reason why  
I can give you so much lovin   
But presents she can buy you  
Last night youre in my arms  
Tonight Im all alone  
  
Chorus  
How long will this game go on How long  
Oh oh how long  
Betcha got a chick on the side sure you got a chick  
I know you got a chick on the side  
  
And its plain plain enough to see that  
Youre not the man for me  
I cant keep playin games that keep my heart in pain  
I want to turn and walk away but its harder to do  
Than it is to say  
  
Chorus  
  
It might hurt me for awhile but of one thing I am sure  
Ill get over you yes Ill find someone new  
Each time I open up my heart  
It seems to just get torn apart  
  
Betcha got a chick on the side sure you got a chick  
I know you got a chick on the side Repeat x 4  
  
I saw you dont you try to hide  
Dont hide it from me no no no Repeat several times  
  
Adlib line 2  
You thought you would hide it hide it  
Hide it from me  
Repeat several times  
  
Talking at the end
