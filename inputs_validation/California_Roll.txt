Chorus Pharrell  
Baby you could be a movie star hey in Los Angeles  
Get yourself a medical card yeah in Los Angeles  
Cause thats how California rolls  
They do the fingers like Redd Foxx in Los Angeles  
You can make it on a light blue box yeah in Los Angeles  
Cause thats how California rolls yeah  
  
Verse 1 Snoop Dogg  
Say when I pass you that weed and I ask you can you roll  
You say roll dont you know that Im from round here  
Well girl I like the way you roll  
Even though you from the ghetto you belong in a home in the mountains  
Not talking bout the view  
Im talking bout me and you  
So if you wanna go to Melrose  
Lets hit Adidas cause girl we got our own shell toes  
And then well go to Venice  
You roll so good you might as well let me hit it  
For like 15 minutes  
Girl you never gon forget it  
And if you wanna go around town  
I could show you where all the real get it  
And if you wanna go downtown  
You might as well roll with a real nigga  
Im not talking bout them fools  
Im talking bout me and you  
  
Chorus
