Standing alone with no direction  
How did I fall so far behind  
Why am I searching for perfection  
Knowing its something I wont find  
  
In my fear and flaws  
I let myself down again  
All because I run  
Til the silence splits me open I run  
Til it puts me underground  
Til I have no breath  
And no roads left but one  
  
When did I lose my sense of purpose  
Can I regain whats lost inside  
Why do I feel like I deserve this  
Why does my pain look like my pride  
  
In my fear and flaws  
I let myself down again  
All because I let myself down  
  
In my fear and flaws I run  
Til the silence splits me open I run  
Til it puts me underground  
Til I have no breath  
And no roads left but one  
No roads left but one  
  
In my fear and flaws  
I let myself down again  
All because I run  
And the silence splits me open I run  
And it puts me underground  
But theres no regret  
And no roads left to run
