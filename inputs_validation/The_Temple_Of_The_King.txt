One day in the year of the fox  
Came a time remembered well  
When the strong young man of the rising sun  
Heard the tolling of the great black bell  
  
One day in the year of the fox  
When the bell began to ring  
Meant the time had come  
For one to go  
To the temple of the king  
  
There in the middle of the circle he stands  
Searching seeking  
With just one touch of his trembling hand  
The answer will be found  
  
Daylight waits while the old man sings  
Heaven help me  
And then like the rush of a thousand wings  
It shines upon the one  
And the day had just begun  
  
One day in the year of the fox  
Came a time remembered well  
When the strong young man of the rising sun  
Heard the tolling of the great black bell  
  
One day in the year of the fox  
When the bell began to sing  
It meant the time had come  
For one to go  
To the temple of the king  
  
There in the middle of the people  
He stands  
Seeing feeling  
With just a wave of a strong right hand  
Hes gone  
To the temple of the king  
  
Far from the circle at the edge of the world  
Hes hoping wondering  
Thinking back from the stories hes heard  
Of what hes going to see  
  
There in middle of the circle it lies  
Heaven help me  
Then all could see by the shine in his eyes  
The answer had been found  
  
Back with the people in the circle  
He stands  
Giving feeling  
With just one touch of a strong right hand  
They know  
Of the temple and the king
