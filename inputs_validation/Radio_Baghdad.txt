Suffer not Your neighbors affliction  
Suffer not Your neighbors paralysis  
But extend your hand Extend your hand  
Lest you vanish in the city And be but a trace  
Just a vanished ghost And your legacy  
All the things you knew Science mathematics thought  
Severely weakened Like irrigation systems  
In the tired veins forming From the Tigris and Euphrates  
In the realm of peace All the world revolved  
All the world revolved Around a perfect circle  
City of Baghdad City of scholars  
Empirical humble Center of the world  
City in ashes City of Baghdad  
City of Baghdad Abrasive aloof  
  
Oh in Mesopotamia Aloofness ran deep  
Deep in the veins of the great rivers  
That form the base Of Eden  
And the tree The tree of knowledge  
Held up its arms To the sky  
All the branches of knowledge All the branches of knowledge  
Cradling Cradling  
Civilization In the realm of peace  
All the world revolved Around a perfect circle  
Oh Baghdad Center of the world  
City of ashes With its great mosques  
Erupting from the mouth of god Rising from the ashes like  
a speckled bird Splayed against the mosaic sky  
Oh clouds around We created the zero  
But we mean nothing to you You would believe  
That we are just some mystical tale We are just a swollen belly  
That gave birth to Sinbad Scheherazade We gave birth  
Oh oh to the zero The perfect number  
We invented the zero And we mean nothing to you  
Our children run through the streets  
And you sent your flames Your shooting stars  
Shock and awe Shock and awe  
Like some some Imagined warrior production  
Twentyfirst century No chivalry involved  
No Bushido  
  
Oh the code of the West Long gone  
Never been Where does it lie  
You came you came Through the west  
Annihilated a people And you come to us  
But we are older than you You come you want to  
You want to come and rob the cradle  
Of civilization And you read yet you read  
You read Genesis You read of the tree  
You read of the tree Beget by god  
That raised its branches into the sky Every branch of knowledge  
Of the cradle of civilization  
  
Of the banks of the Tigris and the Euphrates  
Oh in Mesopotamia Aloofness ran deep  
The face of Eve turning What sky did she see  
What garden beneath her feet The one you drill  
You drill Pulling the blood of the earth  
Little droplets of oil for bracelets Little jewels  
Sapphires You make bracelets  
Round your own world We are weeping tears  
Rubies We offer them to you  
We are just Your Arabian nightmare  
We invented the zero But we mean nothing to you  
Your Arabian nightmare  
  
City of stars  
City of scholarship  
Science City of ideas  
City of light City  
City of ashes That the great Caliph  
Walked through His naked feet formed a circle  
And they built a city  
A perfect city of Baghdad  
In the realm of peace  
And all the world revolved  
And they invented And they mean nothing to you  
Nothing to you Nothing  
  
Go to sleep Go to sleep my child  
Go to sleep And Ill sing you a lullaby  
A lullaby for our city A lullaby of Baghdad  
Go to sleep Sleep my child  
Sleep Sleep  
Run Run  
  
You sent your lights Your bombs  
You sent them down on our city Shock and awe  
Like some crazy TV show  
  
Theyre robbing the cradle of civilization  
Theyre robbing the cradle of civilization  
Theyre robbing the cradle of civilization  
  
Suffer not The paralysis of your neighbor  
Suffer not But extend your hand
