Ten years before my time  
I sang a song to a friend of mine  
Bout a girl working for a dime  
  
Although I didnt know that gypsy girl  
But knew about her kind of thrill  
Her loves not cheap but always up for sale  
  
Picture this I was alone  
But when I sing this song  
Im not alone  
With my gypsy girl  
  
Gypsy lady lost her soul  
Shes so scared of growing old  
But words dont age for me to turn to gold  
  
Gypsy girl with raven hair  
Eyes like saucers with a stare  
That says shes the one that never seems to care  
  
Picture this I was alone  
But when I sing this song  
Im not alone  
With my gypsy girl  
  
Gypsy girl plays it fair  
Throws her hand in the air  
Saying that she didnt really care
