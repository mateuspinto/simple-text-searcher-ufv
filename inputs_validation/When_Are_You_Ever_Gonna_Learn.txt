Look in the mirror wipe the guilt from your eyes  
Take a drink to chase the bitter taste left over from your lies  
You go right back to the bottom every time my back is turned  
Buddy when are you ever gonna learn  
  
Bow your head you cant look me in the eye  
Because just like me you hate to see a man break down and cry  
But youll go on burning bridges till theres no more left to burn  
Buddy when are you ever gonna learn  
  
Was the thrill worth the gamble that you live from day to day  
Does it really hold a candle to the love you threw away  
Each night takes you closer to the point of no return  
Buddy when are you ever gonna learn  
Buddy when are you ever gonna learn
