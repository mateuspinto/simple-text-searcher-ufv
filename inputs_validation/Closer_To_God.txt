You let me violate you  
You let me desecrate you  
You let me penetrate you  
You let me complicate you  
I broke apart my insides  
Ive got no soul to sell  
The only thing that works for me  
Help me get away  
I want to fuck you  
I want to taste you  
I want to feel you  
I want to be you  
Just like an animal  
You can have my isolation  
You can have the hate that it brings  
You can have absence of faith  
You can have my everything  
You tear down all my reason  
You see through what I hide  
You make me perfect  
Help me get inside  
I want to fuck you  
I want to taste you  
I want to feel you  
I want to be you
