It was the struggle of the century  
And all the grown men came to see  
The girl who tamed the tiger yeah yeah  
The heart of southern lovebirds  
They found her under the sea  
She said she came from cell block three  
  
The girl hit hot like a barracuda baby  
She floated on air like a crest of wave  
She was a primal institution  
She was a danger to herself yeah  
  
Mad loving by the cold hearted  
Take a big breath  
Because we just started  
  
Mystery girl  
Mystery girl  
Keep on faking your mystery world  
Cause the mystery boys  
Will be your toys yeah  
Cause the mystery boys  
Will be your toys  
  
Not a day goes by I want to disappear  
Into her eyes a mother pearl  
And my head feels dead  
With all this useless fighting  
But my heart aint dead  
Cause it keeps on loving  
  
The girl hit hard like a barracuda baby  
She floated on air like a crest of wave  
She was a primal institution  
She was a danger to herself yeah  
  
Mad loving by the cold hearted  
Take a big breath  
Because we just started  
  
Mystery girl  
Mystery girl  
Keep on faking your mystery world  
Cause the mystery boys  
Will be your toys yeah  
Cause the mystery boys  
Will be your toys yeah  
There be your toys  
There be your toys alright
