There was cheese cheese walkin on its knees  
In the store in the store  
There was cheese cheese walkin on its knees  
In the corner grocery store  
  
Chorus  
My eyes are dim I cannot see  
I have not brought my specs with me  
I have not brought my specs with me  
  
There were plums plums twiddling their thumbs  
In the store in the store  
There were plums plums twiddling their thumbs  
In the corner grocery store  
  
Chorus  
  
There was corn corn blowin on a horn  
In the store in the store  
There was corn corn blowin on a horn  
In the corner grocery store  
  
Chorus  
  
There were beans beans trying on some jeans  
In the store in the store  
There were beans beans trying on some jeans  
In the corner grocery store  
  
Chorus  
  
There was more more just inside the door  
In the store in the store  
There was more much more just inside the door  
In the corner grocery store
