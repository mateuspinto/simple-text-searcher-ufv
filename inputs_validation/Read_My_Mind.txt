On the corner of main street  
Just tryin to keep it in line  
You say you wanna move on and  
You say Im falling behind  
  
Can you read my mind  
Can you read my mind  
  
I never really gave up on  
Breakin out of this twostar town  
I got the green light  
I got a little fight  
Im gonna turn this thing around  
  
Can you read my mind  
Can you read my mind  
  
The good old days the honest man  
The restless heart the Promised Land  
A subtle kiss that no one sees  
A broken wrist and a big trapeze  
  
Oh well I dont mind you dont mind  
Cause I dont shine if you dont shine  
Before you go can you read my mind  
  
Its funny how you just break down  
Waiting on some sign  
I pull up to the front of your driveway  
With magic soaking my spine  
  
Can you read my mind  
Can you read my mind  
  
The teenage queen the loaded gun  
The drop dead dream the Chosen One  
A southern drawl the world unseen  
A city wall and a trampoline  
  
Oh well I dont mind you dont mind  
Cause I dont shine if you dont shine  
Before you jump  
Tell me what you find  
When you read my mind  
  
Slipping in my faith until I fall  
He never returned that call  
Woman open the door dont let it sting  
I wanna breathe that fire again  
  
She said I dont mind you dont mind  
Cause I dont shine if you dont shine  
Put your back on me  
Put your back on me  
Put your back on me  
  
The stars are blazing like rebel diamonds cut out of the sun  
When you read my mind
