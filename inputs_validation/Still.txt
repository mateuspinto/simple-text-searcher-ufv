Trick of the light  
Or just  
A loss of perspective  
Flaw in the grand plan  
Just  
The way it is  
  
Looks good from a distance  
But  
The closer I come  
It  
Becomes more daunting  
But  
These moments will pass  
  
Still  
Halfway up the hill  
My fingers may bleed  
But Ive got to get there  
Still  
Standing on the hill  
My spirits released  
But Ive got to get there  
  
Lost in an abstract thought  
Dazed and distracted  
Winded yet still Im caught  
With a fragment of doubt  
Slowed by reflection  
But  
These moments will pass  
  
Still  
Halfway up the hill  
My fingers may bleed  
But Ive got to get there  
Still  
Standing on the hill  
My spirits released  
But Ive got to get there  
  
Its just confusion  
An illusion  
Easily overdone  
Here comes resolution  
Absolution  
  
Its not an illusion  
Not a fiction  
Easily overcome  
Here comes revolution  
Absolution  
  
Trick of the light  
Or just  
Too much perspective  
Looks good from a distance  
But  
The closer I come  
It  
Becomes more daunting  
But  
These moments will pass  
  
Still
