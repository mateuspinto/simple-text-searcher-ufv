In my hour of darkness  
In my time of need  
Oh Lord grant me vision  
Oh Lord grant me speed  
  
Once I knew a young man  
Went driving through the night  
Miles and miles without a word  
With just his highbeam lights  
  
Whod have ever thought  
Theyd build such a deadly Denver bend  
To be so strong to take so long  
As it would till the end  
  
In my hour of darkness  
In my time of need  
Oh Lord grant me vision  
Oh Lord grant me speed  
  
Another young man safely strummed  
His silver string guitar  
And he played to people everywhere  
Some say he was a star  
  
But he was just a country boy  
His simple songs confess  
And the music he had in him  
So very few possess  
  
In my hour of darkness  
In my time of need  
Oh Lord grant me vision  
Oh Lord grant me speed  
  
Then there was an old man  
Kind and wise with age  
And he read me just like a book  
And he never missed a page  
  
And I loved him like my father  
And I loved him like my friend  
And I knew his time would shortly come  
But I did not know just when  
  
In my hour of darkness  
In my time of need  
Oh Lord grant me vision  
Oh Lord grant me speed  
Oh Lord grant me vision  
Oh Lord grant me speed
