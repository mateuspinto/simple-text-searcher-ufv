Now Right now  
Look at the place I m in  
When I think about things that I could have done  
Its impossible for me tp pretend  
But I see it now as the lights grow dim  
And the world starts to close its eyes  
I just wanted to say goodnight  
Sweet Suzanne  
I hear the music playin  
But I no longer understand  
Around the corner down the street  
Its got to be better than where I am  
I see it all now as the light grows dim  
And the world starts to close its eyes  
I just wanted to say goodnight  
Sweet Suzanne  
I just wanted to say goodnight  
Just wanted to see if everything was all right  
Just wanted to say goodnight  
Sweet Suzanne  
Time goes by  
Oh so quietly  
Hazy days and memories  
And in the end there was only me  
Wouldnt have been I ask sometimes  
But I see myself inside this rhyme  
Enjoyed what I had back then  
Would I do it again  
Well I see it now  
As the lights grow dim  
I just wanted to say goodnight  
Sweet Suzanne  
I just wanted to say goodnight  
I just wanted to see if everythings all right  
Just wanted to say goodnight  
Sweet Suzanne  
I just wanted to say goodnight  
I just wanted to see if everything s all right  
I just wanted to say goodnight  
Sweet Suzanne
