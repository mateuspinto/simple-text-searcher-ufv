Caught between the twisted stars  
the plotted lines the faulty map  
that brought Columbus to New York  
Betwixt between the East and West  
he calls on her wearing a leather vest  
the earth squeals and shudders to a halt  
A diamond crucifix in his ear  
is used to help ward off the fear  
that he has left his soul in someones rented car  
Inside his pants he hides a mop  
to clean the mess that he has dropped  
into the life of lithesome Juliette Bell  
  
And Romeo wanted Juliette  
and Juliette wanted Romeo  
And Romeo wanted Juliette  
and Juliette wanted Romeo  
  
Romeo Rodriguez squares  
his shoulders and curses Jesus  
runs a comb through his black ponytail  
Hes thinking of his lonely room  
the sink that by his bed gives off a stink  
then smells her perfume in his eyes  
And her voice was like a bell  
  
Outside the street were steaming the crack  
dealers were dreaming  
of an Uzi someone had just scored  
I betcha I could hit that light  
with my one good arm behind my back  
says little Joey Diaz  
Brother give me another tote  
those downtown hoods are no damn good  
those Italians need a lesson to be taught  
This cop who died in Harlem  
you think theyd get the warnin  
I was dancing when his brains run out on the street  
  
And Romeo had Juliette  
and Juliette had her Romeo  
And Romeo had Juliette  
and Juliette had her Romeo  
  
Ill take Manhattan in a garbage bag  
with Latin written on it that says  
its hard to give a shit these days  
Manhattans sinking like a rock  
into the filthy Hudson what a shock  
they wrote a book about it  
they said it was like ancient Rome  
  
The perfume burned his eyes  
holding tightly to her thighs  
And something flickered for a minute  
and then it vanished and was gone
