The moon is the same moon above you  
Aglow with its cool evening light  
But shining at night in Tunisia  
Never does it shine so bright  
  
The stars are aglow in the heavens  
But only the wise understand  
That shining at night in Tunisia  
They guide you through the desert sand  
  
Words fail to tell a tale  
Too exotic to be told  
Each nights a deeper night  
In a world ages old  
  
The cares of the day seem to vanish  
The ending of day brings release  
Each wonderful night in Tunisia  
Where the nights are filled with peace  
  
Each wonderful night in Tunisia
