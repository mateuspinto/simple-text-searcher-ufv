Somethings going on in society  
Dancing with the big boys  
You chew your fingers and stare at the floor  
Dancing with the big boys  
One wrong word and youre out of sync  
Talking bout a hands on policy  
Big boys  
Death to the trees  
Dancing with the big boys  
They werent bad they werent brave  
Nothing is embarrassing  
Dancing with the big boys  
There are too many people too much belief  
Dancing with the big boys  
Where theres trouble theres poetry  
Dancing with the big boys  
Your family is a football team  
Big boys  
This dot marks your location  
Dancing with the big boys  
Loneliness in a free society  
Dancing with the big boys  
Big boys  
This can be embarrassing  
Big boys  
Dancing with the big boys  
Big boys  
Big boys
