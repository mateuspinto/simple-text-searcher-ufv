Do you really want to see  
I dont think I can take this anymore  
You are fucking naive and I am nothing  
Im disgusting and so much more  
  
Holding all the lies I told you  
Feeling like somehow I spoiled you  
Dying is a trial Ive been to  
This is the time for truth and pain  
  
Do you really want to see the  
Torment hatred of this world  
Hand in a book and I believed it  
All it brought me was pain and more  
  
Holding all the lies I told you  
Feeling like somehow I spoiled you  
Dying is a trial Ive been to  
This is the time for truth and pain  
  
Holding all the lies I told you  
Feeling like somehow I spoiled you  
Dying is a trial Ive I been to  
This is the time for truth and pain  
  
I believe I believe  
  
Holding all these lies I told you  
Holding all the lies I told you  
Holding all these lies I told you  
Holding all these lies I told you  
Lies I told you  
  
Holding all the lies I told you  
Feeling like somehow I spoiled you  
Dying is a trial Ive been to  
This is the time for truth and pain  
  
Truth is pain  
Truth is pain  
Truth is pain  
Truth is pain  
Truth is pain  
  
I believe  
I never meant to hurt you  
I believe  
I never meant to betray you  
I never meant to hurt you  
I never meant to hurt you
