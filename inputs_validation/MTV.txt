I was driving through the night  
Into an endless tunnel of fog  
When it dawned on me something was wrong  
I was in a trance hypnotized  
Bored beyond belief  
I was listening to the same old song  
I know every lick every word  
Every nuance  
Im on first name terms with the crew  
But Id better get used to this poop du jour  
Sure as hell they wont play anything new  
  
Oh yes I love you really  
Classic Rock Radio  
Oh my dear its time for bed  
Time for you to go  
Everyone is asleep  
  
The pirates took to water stole the charts  
But sadly that didnt go down well with those upstairs  
Who require loyalty  
The establishment considered  
That the uncontrolled appreciation of music  
Was a danger to royalty  
The mighty empire roared  
As Cash n Everett on the high seas  
Looked like theyd get blown out of the water  
They did of course eventually come ashore  
As meek as mice or to be more accurate  
As lambs to the slaughter  
  
Oh yes I love you really  
I stand to attention  
Oh Fanny I love you dearly  
Something else I should mention  
You sweet thing  
  
Lets not talk about MTV  
I dont even want to start  
I want to take a look at Classic Rock Radio  
Were talking about the state of the art  
  
Mr Grover n Mr Gillian  
You musta made a million  
The night that Frank Zappa caught on fire  
Could you tell us all about it  
Keep it short and use my version  
Or everyone out therell think Im a liar  
We can speak about Bananas for one second  
Just because I understand  
You have to get them off your chest  
But in the meantime while your talking  
Could you do some more of these here IDs  
And then this station might maintain some interest  
  
Oh yes I love you dearly  
But why do you exist  
Oh yes I love you really  
Is there something that I missed
