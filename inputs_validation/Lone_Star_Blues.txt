At a truck stop in St Angelo  
Saw a bill board about this rodeo  
This weekend out in El Paso  
So I signed up to ride  
  
I drew a bull called original sin  
Heard hed killed a couple of men  
Figured this was something I could win  
Cause the devil was on my side  
I was havin myself one hell of a ride  
But I ended up disqualified  
That bull just up and died  
Before they blew the whistle  
  
Chorus  
With those north Texas blues  
Thought Id paid all my dues  
Then those south Texas blues  
Told me son you aint through  
Had the east Texas blues and the west Texas too  
Ive done all I know to do  
Tryin to lose tryin to lose  
These ol Lone Star Blues  
  
Well I got laid off at Brown and Rue  
Then on my way back to cuttin chute  
I lost my wrist watch and my boots  
Shootin dice with a dude from Houston  
Well there aint no jobs here workin cattle  
So I got on the part time haulin gravel  
With some outfit from Seattle out here building custom homes  
  
Chorus  
  
Well I gassed my truck and I packed my clothes  
Turned in my key and I hit the road  
I said cow towns where Ill go  
You never know I might get lucky  
  
Well I got a friend there turning knobs  
At a place called Billy Bobs  
Said thought he could get me a job there  
Workin as a bouncer  
First night on the job was just insane  
Some ol boy got all deranged  
Hit me in the head with a Harley chain  
To this day my ears still ring  
  
Chorus  
  
Ive done all I know to do  
Tryin to lose tryin to lose  
These ol Lone Star blues
