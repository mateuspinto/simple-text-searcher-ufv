They say theres wreckage washing up all along the coast  
No one seems know too much or got hit the most  
Nothing has been spoken theres not alot to see  
But something has been broken thats how feels to me  
  
We had a harmony I never meant to small boats  
Lying out in the water like a slick of oil  
Tide is running out to sea under a darkening sky  
The night is falling down on me and Im a thinking that I should head on  
  
Head on home been gone to long  
Gone too long leave my roam  
Beachcomb  
  
Little wild kitten out hunting see what he can get  
Youre in a big city that wont stop growing yet  
The sun is goin down smokin a flaming testiment  
Something has been broken and it feels permenant  
  
The little seabird flying he knows were he wants to go  
Quess I ought to pack my stuff and do the thing I know  
Turn around and head on back along the old sea walls  
I felt somthing give and crack and now Im sorry thats all head on  
  
Head on home been gone to long  
Gone too long leave my roam  
Beachcomb
