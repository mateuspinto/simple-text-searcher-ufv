Intrigue surrounding me  
Intrigue surrounding you  
I was only looking for a bit of harmony and grace  
I swear I only meant it in good faith  
  
In league enfolding you  
Fatigue I feel it too  
I guess I never thought I had a thing or two to lose  
I never thought Id end up as good news  
  
Believe in what you hear  
Concede to what you fear  
And if you think that I have so much love to go to waste  
Cut out the running home make the pace  
  
Intrigue surrounding me you  
Intrigue surrounding you me  
I was only looking for a bit of harmony and grace  
I swear I only meant it in good faith  
  
And if you think that I have so much love to go to waste  
Cut out the running home make the pace  
  
Intrigue  
Intrigue  
Intrigue  
Intrigue  
Intrigue  
Intrigue
