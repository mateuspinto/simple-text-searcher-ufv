You drive a pretty car you know how fine you are  
And nobody needs to say it no way  
They love the clothes you wear they compliment you  
And I just love the way you play it  
  
But the only thing you dream of  
Money cant buy for you oh  
And in my dreams Ill make your wish come true  
  
For the girl who has everything I bring you love  
I bring you love  
Cause the girl who has everything cant get enough  
Of my love  
  
Why do you run and hide say what you feel inside  
Say what you feel  
Why must you always fake it oh yeah  
Girl you need to understand  
Your hearts safe within my hands  
I promise Ill never break it oh  
  
I know that you still dream of  
What money cant buy for you  
And in my dreams Ill make your wish come true  
  
For the girl who has everything I bring you love  
I bring you love I bring you love  
Cause the girl who has everything cant get enough  
Enough of my love  
  
If you just let me try  
My baby listen  
Ill help you find  
What youve been missing  
Oh yeah you gotta listen to your heart  
And not your mind  
Oh baby yeah  
  
For the girl who has everything I bring you love  
I bring you love I bring you love yeah  
Cause the girl who has everything cant get enough  
Of my love  
  
For the girl who has everything  
Oh girl you want my love Im gonna give it to you  
I bring you love  
Cause the girl who has everything cant get enough  
Of my love
