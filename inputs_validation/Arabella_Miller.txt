Little Arabella Miller  
Had a fuzzy caterpillar  
Tickle palm with two fingers  
  
First it crawled up on her mother  
Walk fingers up left arm  
  
Then upon her baby brother  
Walk fingers up right arm  
  
They said Arabella Miller  
Walk fingers up over head  
  
Put away your caterpillar   
hide hands behind back  
  
Little Arabella Miller  
Had a fuzzy caterpillar  
First it crawled upon her brother  
Then upon her dear grandmother  
Gran said Arabella Miller  
How I love your caterpillar
