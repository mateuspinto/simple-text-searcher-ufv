Its the same in every country  
When you say youre leaving  
Left behind the loved ones  
Waiting silent in the hall  
Where youre going lies adventure  
Others only dream of  
Red and green light this is real  
And so you go to war  
  
For the passion for the glory  
For the memories for the money  
Youre a soldier for your country  
Whats the difference all the same  
  
Far away from the land of our birth  
We fly a flag in some foreign earth  
We sailed away like our fathers before  
These colors dont run from cold bloody war  
  
There is no one that will save you  
Going down in flames  
No surrender certain death you  
Look it in the eye  
On the shores tyranny you  
Crashed a human wave  
Paying for my freedom with your  
Lonely unmarked graves  
  
For the passion for the glory  
For the memories for the money  
Youre a soldier for your country  
Whats the difference all the same  
  
Far away from the land of our birth  
We fly a flag in some foreign earth  
We sailed away like our fathers before  
These colors dont run from cold bloody war
