And she was lying in the grass  
And she could hear the highway breathing  
And she could see a nearby factory  
Shes making sure she is not dreaming  
See the lights of a neighbors house  
Now shes starting to rise  
Take a minute to concentrate  
And she opens up her eyes  
  
Chorus  
The world was moving and she was right there with it and she was  
The world was moving she was floating above it and she was and she was  
  
And she was drifting through the backyard  
And she was taking off her dress  
And she was moving very slowly  
Rising up above the earth  
Moving into the universe  
Drifting this way and that  
Not touching ground at all  
Up above the yard  
  
Chorus  
  
She was glad about it no doubt about it  
She isnt sure what shes done  
No time to think about what to tell him  
No time to think about what shes done  
And she was  
  
And she was looking at herself  
And things were looking like a movie  
She had a pleasant elevation  
Shes moving out in all directions  
  
Chorus  
  
Joining the world of missing persons and she was  
Missing enough to feel alright and she was
