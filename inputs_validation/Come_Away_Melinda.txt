Daddy daddy come and look  
See what I have found  
A little ways away from here  
While digging in the ground  
  
Come away Melinda  
Come in and close the door  
Its nothing just a picturebook  
They had before the war  
  
Daddy daddy come and see  
Daddy come and look  
Why theres four or five  
Little Melinda girls  
Inside my picture book  
  
Come away Melinda  
Come in and close the door  
There were lots of little girls like you  
Before they had the war  
  
Oh Daddy daddy come and see  
Daddy hurry do  
Why theres someone  
In a pretty dress  
Shes all grown up like you  
Wont you tell me why  
  
Come away Melinda  
Come in and close the door  
That someone is your Mummy  
You had before the war  
  
Daddy daddy tell me if you can  
Why cant things be  
The way they were  
Before the war began  
  
Come away Melinda  
Come in and close the door  
The answer lies in yesterday  
Before they had the war
