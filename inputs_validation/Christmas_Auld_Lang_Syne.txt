When mistletoe and tinsel glow  
Paint a yuletide valentine  
Back home i go to those i know  
For a christmas auld lang syne  
  
And as we gather round the tree  
Our voices all combine  
In sweet accord to thank our lord  
For a christmas auld lang syne  
  
When sleigh bells ring and choirs sing  
And the childrens faces shine  
With each new toy we share their joy  
With a christmas auld lang syne  
  
We sing his praise this day of days  
And pray next year this time  
Well all be near to share the cheer  
Of a christmas auld lang syne  
  
In sweet accord to thank our lord  
For a christmas auld lang syne
