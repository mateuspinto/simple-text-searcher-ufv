Every night I have the same old dream  
Bout you and me and whats in between  
So many changes so many lies  
Try to run try to hide  
  
From everything that I feel inside  
But I cant escape you or your frozen eyes  
Searching in the darkness  
Fading out of sight  
  
Love was here and gone like a thief in the night  
Stone Cold  
And I thought I knew you so well  
Stone Cold  
  
Cant break away from your spell  
Another dark and empty night  
If I was wrong I want to make it right  
But you are so distant so far away  
  
Your words like ice fall on the ground  
Breaking the silence without a sound  
Oh familiar strangers with nothing to say  
Searching in the darkness  
  
Fading out of sight  
Love was here and gone like a thief in the night  
Stone Cold  
And I thought I knew you so well  
  
Stone Cold  
Cant break away from your spell  
You leave me Stone Cold  
Searching in the darkness  
  
Fading out of sight  
Love was here and gone like a thief in the night  
Stone Cold  
And I thought I knew you so well  
  
Stone Cold  
Cant break away from your spell  
Youre Stone Coldyeah  
I cant break away from your spell  
  
Stone Cold baby  
I thought I knew you so well  
Youre stone coldice cold  
Cant break away from your spell  
  
You put me in the deep freeze  
Oh baby dont you leave me  
Stone cold your leavin me cold  
Stone Cold I thought I knew you so well  
  
Stone Cold xant break away from your spell
