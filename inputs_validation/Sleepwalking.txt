Trippy little Popsicle cod  
Did I get it quite right  
Broken got broke  
Was it good to smoke  
I am not sure  
Was it good to sing  
Was it right to love  
Was it wrong this turning that I took  
Does the song sound right  
Do I look alright  
I spent all night getting it right  
So you would love me more  
So you would love me more  
Pray for your indecision girl  
Run from your indecision girl  
Hide from your indecision girl  
Somnambulation up and down the road  
I lay in the garden with the cats  
Oh my how the grass did grow  
I watch the clock till the day did stop  
I pray for my lovers return  
I spent all night getting it right  
So you would love me more  
So you would love me more  
Pray for your indecision girl  
Burn for your indecision girl  
Blind from your indecision girl
