The places that we live and the living that we did  
The places we were put and the things we were given  
He sings what they talk  
But they took away are pride but they didnt take our lives  
They took away the things that made us feel alive  
Said Ooh ooh what have we become  
What have we become  
Said Ooh ooh how did this become  
How did this become How did this become  
In old woman we flex from the East to the West  
She thinks of her grandmother and her grandfather  
And strings that they had  
Now she looks to the arm saw them sniffing on their drugs  
The drink in there has stolen so many souls  
And flooded her sacred blood  
She says Ooh ooh what have we become  
What have we become  
She says Ooh ooh how did this become  
How did this become  
She says Ooh ooh the bottle took away my son  
It took away my son  
She says Ooh ooh where are we gonna run  
What have we become  
She says Ooh ooh what have we become  
What have we become  
She says Ooh ooh how did this become  
How did this become  
She says Ooh ooh see the bottle took away my son  
It took away my son  
She says Ooh ooh where are we gonna run  
What have we become
