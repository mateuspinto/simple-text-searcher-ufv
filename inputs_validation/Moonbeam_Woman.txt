Whos that sister mader her own space  
Shes got moondust on her fro  
Damn we miss her sugarsome face  
Wistful moonbeam sense to go  
Six months later she steamed up the van  
We got no small surprise  
Daisy lady sits on her hand a naughty sparkle in her eyes  
  
Daisy Lady come flyin out my hand  
Daisy Lady Playmate of the land  
  
Late arrival never been kissed  
Strode up sneaking in tongues  
Settled nicely up to the wrist  
Grinding to the bass and the drum  
3 years later shes back in her stride  
Down Full Circle doin the bump  
Lovely Lady up on her feet  
Shes getting over the hump  
  
That poor old poet didnt know so  
But she cooked the wrong goose  
She should have lapped it up  
And licked it like we do with that juice  
And if you ask her she just shrugs  
And digs the life that she chose  
She sure nuff gets some when her cup overflows  
  
Cant stop Wont stop rockin to the lady cuz I get down and I go down x
many
