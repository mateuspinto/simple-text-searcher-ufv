I know this place is where I am  
No other place is better then  
No matter where I go I am  
Proud to be Canadian  
  
I am you know I am I am Canadian  
I am you know I am I am Canadian  
Common  
  
I love this country where I am  
This land is where I make my stand  
No other heart is truer then  
The one we call Canadian  
  
Sing it  
  
I am you know you know I am I am Canadian  
I am you know I am you know I am I am Canadian  
I am canadian
