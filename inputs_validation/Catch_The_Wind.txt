In the chilly hours and minutes of uncertainty I want to be  
In the warm hold of your loving mind  
To feel you all around me and to take your hand along the sand  
Ah but I may as well try and catch the wind  
When sundown pales the sky I want to hide a while behind your smile  
And everywhere Id look your eyes Id find  
For me to love you now twould be the sweetest thing twould make me sing  
Ah but I may as well try and catch the wind  
  
When rain has hung the leaves with tears I want you near to kill my fears  
To help me leave all my blues behind  
Standing in your heart is where I want to be and long to be  
Ah but I may as well try and catch the wind  
  
Ah but I may as well try and catch the wind
