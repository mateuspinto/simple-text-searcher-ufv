Wake me up with laughter  
Wrap me in your arms  
This aint  
No morning after  
Never been so warm  
It didnt take so long  
For us to feel this way  
  
Can a good thing last longer than day Where do we take it  
Now now that we caught fire Will something greater grow  
Out of this desire Should I drop my guard at the risk of being  
Used but the way you do those things to me how can I  
Refuse  
  
I could get addicted to your energy the way you take me over  
Pulling on me Our hearts beat together out timing is the same  
  
Can I trust my feelings save myself the pain Where do we  
Take it now now that we caught fire Will something greater  
Grow out of this desire Should I drop my guard at the risk of  
Being but the way you do those things to me how can I  
Refuse  
  
We could share the mystery spare ourselves the misery  
Discover it again everyday We could take love all the  
Way  
  
Where do we take it now now that we caught fire Will  
Something greater grow out of this desire Should I drop my  
Guard at the risk of being used But the way you do those  
Things to me how can I refuse
