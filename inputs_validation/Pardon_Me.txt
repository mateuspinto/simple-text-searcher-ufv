I tried my best  
I gave my all  
Sometimes my best wasnt good enough  
For you  
Sometimes I let you go  
Sometimes I hurt you so  
I know that I can be the meanest person in the world  
  
Chorus  
So I apologize to you  
And to anyone else that I hurt too  
I may not be the perfect soul  
But I cant learn self control  
So pardon me pardon me pardon me my friend  
  
I never thought  
That anyone  
Was more important than the plans  
I made  
But now I feel the shame  
Theres no one else to blame  
For all the broken hearts scattered on the field of war  
  
Chorus  
  
Sometimes I let you go  
Sometimes I hurt you sooo  
I know that I can be the meanest person in the world  
  
Chorus  
  
So pardon me  
Pardon me  
Pardon me my friend  
Pardon meeeee  
My friendddd  
Pardon meee  
My frienddd
