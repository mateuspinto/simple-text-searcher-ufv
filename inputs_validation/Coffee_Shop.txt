I am just a lousy bum  
Searching for the unknown crumb  
The crumb the crumb  
Something or someone to come  
  
Come along illuminate my lust  
Combust  
Confucius might have been confused  
And Buddha might have blown a fuse  
I ooze the muse  
  
Meet me at the coffee shop  
We can dance like Iggy Pop  
Another go in the parking lot  
Frewak the cheek on your hot spot  
  
Back and forth my bodys jerking  
Will to thrill will not stop working  
Work and work  
Ill take you on a honeymoon  
Jumping on a bed in a hotel room  
The room the groom  
  
Meet me at the coffee shop  
We can dance  
Like Iggy Pop  
Another go in the parking lot  
Frewak the cheek on your hot spot
