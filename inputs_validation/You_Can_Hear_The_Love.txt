Like the summer wind that whispers in the dark  
Let the song ignite the spark and you can hear the love  
Hush of evening and the rustling of the leaves  
The murmur as a baby breathes and you can hear the love  
  
Chorus  
Her body moves just like a symphony she needs you  
To be the one whos harmony will guide her  
And let her know shes getting through  
And you can hear the love  
Sometimes it sounds just like a never ending choir  
She puts your words to musics sweet desire  
And whenever she is near you can hear the love  
Dont you know that you can feel it touch it always hear the love  
  
Tender touches to the rythm of the night  
Written down in candle light beneath the stars above  
Sweetly woven in a perfect applique  
Listen to the music play and you can hear the love  
  
Ch x 2  
  
Ad lib and fade
