I had me a wife I had me some daughters  
I tried so hard I never knew still waters  
Nothing to eat and nothing to drink  
Nothing for a man to do but sit around and think  
Nothing for a man to do but sit around and think  
  
Well Im a thinkin and thinkin till theres nothin I aint thunk  
Breathing in the stink till finally I stunk  
It was at that time I swear I lost my mind  
I started making plans to kill my own kind  
I started making plans to kill my own kind  
  
Come little daughter I said to the youngest one  
Put your coat on well have some fun  
Well go out to mountains the one to explore  
Her face then lit up I was standing by the door  
Her face then lit up I was standing by the door  
  
Come little daughter I will carry the lanterns  
Well go out tonight well go to the caverns  
Well go out tonight well go to the caves  
Kiss your mother goodnight and remember that God saves  
Kiss your mother goodnight and remember that God saves  
  
A led her to a hole a deep black well  
I said make a wish make sure and not tell and  
Close youre eyes dear and count to seven  
You know your papa loves you good children go to heaven  
You know your papa loves you good children go to heaven  
  
I gave her a push I gave her a shove  
I pushed with all my might I pushed with all my love  
I threw my child into a bottomless pit  
She was screaming as she fell but I never heard her hit  
She was screaming as she fell but I never heard her hit  
  
Gather round boys to this tale that I tell  
You want to know how to take a short trip to hell  
Its guaranteed to get your own place in hell  
Just take your lovely daughter and push her in the well  
Take your lovely daughter and throw her in the well  
  
Dont speak to me of lovers with a broken heart  
You want to know what can really tear you apart  
Im going out to the barn will I never stop in pain  
Im going out to the barn to hang myself in shame
