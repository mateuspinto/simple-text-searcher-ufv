Little Amsterdam  
In a southern town  
Hominy get it on the plate girl  
Momma keep your head down  
Momma it wasnt my bullet  
  
Dont take me back to the Range  
Im just comin out of the cell in my brain  
Girl you got to know there days  
Which side your own  
  
Momma got shit  
She loved a brown man  
Then she built a bridge in the Sheriffs bed  
Shed do anything to save her man  
You see her olives are cold pressed  
And her best friend is a sun dress  
But Momma  
It wasnt my bullet  
  
Round and a round and a round I go  
Round and a round this time for keeps  
Father only you can save my soul  
And playing that organ must count  
For something  
Girl you got to know these days  
Which side your on  
Little Amsterdam  
Shut down today  
They buried her with a  
Butter bean bouquet  
And the Sheriff now cant ride away  
Like he said into the sunset  
And I wont say  
He shouldna paid  
But Momma  
It wasnt my bullet
