Like the talon of Mars Ill tear right through the wall  
Thunder and lightning in power the gods reveal all  
In the black where the siren reigns  
Ravaging the spirits of the brave  
  
The wine of violence breaks our control  
See the madness burning angels glow  
The wine of violence I steal your soul  
See the madness in me grow  
  
I am the wound and the scar and the spear come to life  
Sacred red son of the sun torn to pieces imbibed  
In the black where the darkness rains death  
Drowning in the currents of your shame  
  
The wine of violence takes your control  
Sin and madness burning kingdoms whole  
The wine of violence I steal your soul  
See the madness in me grow  
  
Fight me you coward thief of stolen days  
Joy is destruction driving me insane to fight  
Win the silence of the damned holy order high command  
Eagle tearing flesh from bone  
Golden whirlwind bare the stars we fly fly  
Let the death mist close your eyes  
  
The wine of violence takes all control  
See the fire burning down below  
The wine of violence I steal your soul  
See the god in me enthroned  
  
All dead silent and alone  
No more savior carved in stone  
All dead nobody will weep  
Icy water death runs deep vengeance is mine I regain my halls
