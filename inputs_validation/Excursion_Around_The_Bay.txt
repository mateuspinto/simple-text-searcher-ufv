Well it was on this Monday morning  
And the day be calm and fine  
A harbor grace excursion  
With the boys who had the time  
And just before the sailor  
Took the gangway from the pier  
I saw some fellow haul me wife  
Aboard as a volunteer  
  
Chorus  
Oh me oh my I heard me old wife cry  
Oh me oh my I think Im gonna die  
Oh me oh my I heard me old wife say  
I wish Id never taken this excursion around the bay  
  
We had fourteen hundred souls aboard oh what a splendid sight  
Left strong and regimental to make our spirits bright  
And meself being in the double when a funny things theyd say  
They choke themselves from laughing when theyd see us in the bay  
  
Chorus  
  
Me wife she got no better she turned a sickly green  
I fed her cake and candy fat pork and kerosene  
Castor Oil and sugar of candy I rubbed pure oil on her face  
And I said shell be a dandy when we reaches Harbor Grace  
  
Chorus  
  
My wife she got no better my wife me darling dear  
The screeches from her trolley could hear in Carbonear  
I tried every place in Harbor Grace  
Tried every store and shop  
To get her something for a cure or take her to the hop  
  
Chorus  
  
She died below the brandys as we were coming back  
We buried her in the ocean wrapped up in a Union Jack  
So now I am a single man in search of a pretty face  
And the woman that says shell have me Im off for Harbor Grace  
  
Chorus
