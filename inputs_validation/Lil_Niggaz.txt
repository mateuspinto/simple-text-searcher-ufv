Verse  
Yeah Aint nothin but to do it nigga thats true  
A quarter milli and a Buick nigga guess who  
It came to me like the dream that I once had  
Niggas said I couldnt do it then I bust through  
And now Im flying worldwide singing rap songs  
Fucking all the bad hoes that I once knew  
And busted nuts for all the times I was shitted on  
See now it was once fuck me now its fuck you  
Clearly now hear me  
Back with a vengeance hope you niggas feel me  
Cut me deep and know it hurts severely  
Im a forgiver I still love you dearly sincerely  
Its Truly Yours bout to stack another quarter milli  
Nigga got a quarter milli dont be silly
