Standing in a field of three leaf clovers  
Waiting for the rain to pass over  
No rainbows on my shoulder  
Just the weight of walking day to day  
Nothing shiny coming along the way  
Then I saw you and I reached out  
aint no more blue now I understand why  
  
How lucky I am lucky I am  
To be the one who fills your eyes  
Blowin away sails on a lake  
Flyin like a flag in the sky  
Bright colored balloons in the wind  
Thats how lucky I am  
how lucky I am  
  
Now the road is rising up to meet me  
And my half empty cup is filled completely  
And Im drinking that sweet taste of rain  
So grateful for each moment I get  
To have found you  
I could have walked on by  
But the stars were on my side
