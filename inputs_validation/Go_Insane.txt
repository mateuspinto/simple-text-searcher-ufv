Two kinds of people in this world  
Winners losers  
  
I lost my power in this world  
Cause I did not use it  
  
So I go insane  
Like I always do  
  
And I call your name  
Shes a lot like you  
  
Two kinds of trouble in this world  
Living dying  
  
I lost my power in this world  
And the rumors are flying  
  
So I go insane  
Like I always do  
  
And I call your name  
Shes a lot like you  
  
So I go insane  
Like I always do  
  
And I call your name  
Shes a lot like you
