What do you get when you fall in love  
A guy with a pin to burst your bubble  
Thats what you get for all your trouble  
Ill never fall in love again  
Ill never fall in love again  
  
What do you get when you kiss a girl  
You get enough germs to catch pneumonia  
After you do shell never phone you  
Ill never fall in love again  
Ill never fall in love again  
  
Dont tell me what its all about  
Cause Ive been there and Im glad Im out  
Out of those chains those chains that bind you  
That is why Im here to remind you  
  
What do you get when you give your heart  
You get it all broken up and battered  
Thats what you get a heart thats shattered  
Ill never fall in love again  
Ill never fall in love again  
  
Out of those chains those chains that bind you  
That is why Im here to remind you  
  
What do you get when you fall in love  
You only get lies and pain and sorrow  
So for at least until tomorrow  
Ill never fall in love again  
Ill never fall in love again  
  
Ill never fall in love again  
Ill never fall in love again
