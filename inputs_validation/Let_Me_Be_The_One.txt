Something in the way you move  
Lets me get too close to you  
I tremble when I look at your face  
And I want all the world to see  
Tonight the world belongs to me  
Touch me with your animal grace  
  
Put your hand on my heart  
And feel the need in me  
  
Let me be the one  
Lead me into temptation  
And show me the right side of wrong  
Let me be the one  
Take me in from the cold  
Gimme something to hold  
Let me be the one  
Let me be the one  
  
Burnin in the afterglow  
We catch the wind and let it go  
Washed away like words in the sand  
A passion thats so physical  
Electric and untouchable  
Dont want to let it slip through my hands  
  
Put your hand on my heart  
And feel the need in me  
  
Let me be the one  
Lead me into temptation  
And show me the right side of wrong  
Let me be the one  
Take me in from the cold  
Gimme something to hold  
  
Dont let this dream pass by  
Just spread your wings and fly  
Reach out and touch  
Let your heart just breathe me in  
Ill be your oxygen  
  
Put your hand on my heart  
Feel the need in me  
  
Let me be the one  
Lead me into temptation  
And show me the right side of wrong  
Let me be the one  
Take me in from the cold  
Gimme something to hold  
Let me be the one  
Let me be the one  
Oh oh  
Let me be the one  
Let me be the one
