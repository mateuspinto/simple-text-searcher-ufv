Weve laid the cables and the wires  
Weve split the wood and stoked the fires  
Weve lit our town so there is no  
Place for crime to hide  
Our little church is painted white  
And in the safety of the night  
We all go quiet as a mouse  
For the word is out  
That God is in the house  
God is in the house  
God is in the house  
No cause for worry now  
God is in the house  
Moral sneaks in the White House  
Computer geeks in the school house  
Drug freaks in the crack house  
We dont have that stuff here  
We have a tiny little Force  
But we need them of course  
For the kittens in the trees  
And at night we are on our knees  
As quiet as a mouse  
For God is in the house  
God is in the house  
God is in the house  
And no ones left in doubt  
God is in the house  
Homos roaming the streets in packs  
Queer bashers with tirejacks  
Lesbian counterattacks  
That stuff is for the big cities  
Our town is very pretty  
We have a pretty little square  
We have a woman for a mayor  
Our policy is firm but fair  
Now that God is in the house  
God is in the house  
God is in the house  
Any day now he will come out  
God is in the house  
Wellmeaning little therapists  
Goosestepping twelvestepping Tetotalltarianists  
The tipsy the reeling and the drop down pissed  
We got no time for that stuff here  
Zero crime and no fear  
Weve bred all our kittens white  
So that you can see them in the night  
And at night were on our knees  
As quiet as a mouse  
Since the word got out  
From the North down to the South  
For noones left in doubt  
Theres no fear about  
If we all hold hands and very quietly shout  
Hallelujah  
God is in the house  
God is in the house  
Oh I wish he would come out  
God is in the house
