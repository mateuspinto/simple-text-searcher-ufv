Only a tramp was Lazarus sad fate  
He who lay down at the rich mans gate  
He begged for the crumbs from the rich man to eat  
He was only a tramp found dead on the street  
He was some mothers darlin he was some mothers son  
Once he was fair and once he was young  
And some mother rocked him her darlin to sleep  
But they left him to die like a tramp on the street  
Jesus he died on Calvarys tree  
He shed his lifes blood for you and for me  
They pierced his side and then his feet  
And they left him to die like a tramp on the street  
He was Marys own darlin he was gods chosen son  
Once he was fair and once he was young  
Mary she rocked him her darlin to sleep  
But they left him to die like a tramp on the street  
If Jesus should come and knock on your door  
For a place to come in or bread from your store  
Would you welcome him in or turn him away  
Then the gods would deny you on the great judgment day
