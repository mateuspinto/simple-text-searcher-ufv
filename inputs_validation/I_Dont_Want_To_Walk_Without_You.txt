All our friends keep knocking at the door  
Theyve asked me out a hundred times or more  
But all I say is Leave me in the gloom  
And here I stay within my lonely room  
Cause  
  
I dont want to walk without you Baby  
Walk without my arm about you Baby  
I thought the day you left me behind  
Id take a stroll and get you right off my mind  
But now I find that  
I dont want to walk without the sunshine  
Whyd you have to turn off all that sunshine  
Oh Baby please come back or youll break my heart for me  
Cause I dont want to walk without you  
No sire
