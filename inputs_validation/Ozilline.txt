he did he observed Saturday as the sabbath  
what what kind of faith does that make him  
Uh he didnt have one  
oh OK  
He didnt believe in any one thing  
he would go out on the street and all the kids would play the  
with a drum like thing some kind of an instrument yeah  
and mama played the organ  
she had a organ and she played that and she got a real big kick out of it  
  
Oh Ozilline  
The moon is almost full  
And you dont need a torchlight  
To see into these woods  
Now sister bring the medicine  
To keep you from decline  
But its the waxing and the waining  
Thats always on your mind  
  
Chorus  
I said oh Ozilline  
Oh Ozilline  
I feel for you  
I said oh Ozilline  
Oh Ozilline  
I feel for you  
  
As soon as the corns in  
The deer will come to feed  
And when the berry ripens  
The bird will come to eat  
You build by the river  
Its pretty but youll pay  
Cause the springtime brings the flood plain  
And your cutbank washes away  
  
Chorus  
  
I had to put the dog down  
Before I hit the road  
Yeah I watched that sweet old life  
Become a bag of bones  
So when youre bodys broken  
And your heart wants to give in  
And you hear that hoot owl callin  
Just like she was a friend  
  
Chorus  
  
I said Ozilline she dont let you cry  
If you ask her where it hurts  
I said Ozilline she dont let you cry  
If you ask her where it hurts  
She said what a blessed sky
