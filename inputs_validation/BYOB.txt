Why do they always send the poor  
  
Barbarisms by barbaras  
With pointed heels  
Victorious victorious kneel  
For brand new spankin deals  
  
Marching forward hypocritic and  
Hypnotic computers  
You depend on our protection  
Yet you feed us lies from the tablecloth  
  
Everybodys going to the party have a real good time  
Dancing in the desert blowing up the sunshine  
  
Kneeling roses disappearing into  
Moses dry mouth  
Breaking into fort knox stealing  
Our intentions  
  
Hangers sitting dripped in oil  
Crying freedom  
Handed to obsoletion  
Still you feed us lies from the tablecloth  
  
Everybodys going to the party have a real good time  
Dancing in the desert blowing up the sunshine  
  
Everybodys going to the party have a real good time  
Dancing in the desert blowing up the sunshine  
  
Blast off  
Its party time  
And we dont live in a fascist nation  
Blast off  
Its party time  
And where the fuck are you  
  
Where the fuck are you  
Where the fuck are you  
  
Why dont presidents fight the war  
Why do they always send the poor  
  
Why dont presidents fight the war  
Why do they always send the poor  
  
Why do they always send the poor  
Why do they always send the poor  
Why do they always send the poor  
  
Kneeling roses disappearing into  
Moses dry mouth  
Breaking into fort knox stealing  
Our intentions  
  
Hangers sitting dripped in oil  
Crying freedom  
Handed to obsoletion  
Still you feed us lies from the tablecloth  
  
Everybodys going to the party have a real good time  
Dancing in the desert blowing up the sunshine  
  
Everybodys going to the party have a real good time  
Dancing in the desert blowing up the sun  
  
Where the fuck are you  
Where the fuck are you  
  
Why dont presidents fight the war  
Why do they always send the poor  
  
Why dont presidents fight the war  
Why do they always send the poor  
  
Why do they always send the poor  
Why do they always send the poor  
They always send the poor  
They always send the poor
