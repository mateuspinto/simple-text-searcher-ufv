Girl  
You have no faith in medicine  
  
Is there a way to find a cure for this  
Implanted in a pill  
Is it just the name upon the bottle  
The determines if it will  
  
Is the problem your allergic  
To a well familiar name  
Do you have any problem with this one  
If the results are they same  
  
Acetaminophen

Girl  
You have no faith in medicine  
  
Well strip the bark right off a tree  
And just hand it this way  
Dont even need a drink of water  
To make the headache go away  
Give me a sugar pill  
And watch me just rattle  
Down the street  
  
Acetaminophen  
You see the medicine
