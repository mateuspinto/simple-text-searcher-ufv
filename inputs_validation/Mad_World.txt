All around me are familiar faces  
Worn out places worn out faces  
Bright and early for their daily races  
Going nowhere going nowhere  
And their tears are filling up their glasses  
No expression no expression  
Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow  
No tomorrow no tomorrow  
  
And I find it kind of funny  
I find it kind of sad  
The dreams in which Im dying  
Are the best Ive ever had  
I find it hard to tell you  
Cause I find it hard to take  
When people run in circles  
Its a very very  
Mad world  
  
Children waiting for the day they feel good  
Happy birthday happy birthday  
Made to feel the way that every child should  
Sit and listen sit and listen  
Went to school and I was very nervous  
No one knew me no one knew me  
Hello teacher tell me whats my lesson  
Look right through me look right through me  
  
And I find it kind of funny  
I find it kind of sad  
The dreams in which Im dying  
Are the best Ive ever had  
I find it hard to tell you  
Cause I find it hard to take  
When people run in circles  
Its a very very  
Mad world
