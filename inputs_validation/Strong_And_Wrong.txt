Strong and wrong you win  
Only because  
Thats the way its always been  
Men love war  
Thats what history s for  
History  
A massmurder mystery  
His story  
  
Strong and wrong  
You lose everything  
Without the heart  
You need  
To hear a robin sing  
Where have all the songbirds gone  
Gone  
All I hear are crows in flight  
Singing might is right  
Might is right  
  
Oh the dawn of man comes slow  
Thousands of years  
And here we are  
Still worshiping  
Our own ego  
  
Strong and wrong  
What is Gods will  
Onward Christian soldiers  
Or thou shall not kill  
Men love war  
Is that what God is for  
Just a Rabbits foot  
Just a lucky paw  
For shock and awe  
Shock and awe  
  
The dawn of man comes slow  
Thousands of years  
Here we are  
Still worshiping  
Our own ego  
Strong and Wrong  
Strong and Wrong
