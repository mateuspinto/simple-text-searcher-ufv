Every kiss is a goodbye kiss  
And every touch is momentary  
Like trying to hold her ghost  
Yes she disappears at sunrise  
Some times the past is all we have  
I see you in my mind so clearly  
A salvation to these tired cold and searching eyes  
We fade we fade away like dream  
We come apart at the seam  
Every moment comes to an end  
Just another fading memory  
She let life destroy her  
Move through me like a ghost  
No one to break their blades  
No one to cut their throats  
All of your words will wash away  
My broken heart stills mends  
But you could care less anyway
