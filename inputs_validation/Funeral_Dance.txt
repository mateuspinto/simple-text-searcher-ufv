In Amerigo Carnival was as hallowed as Christmas itself perhaps slightly
more  
So  
There was a meaning to it See Islanders did not put into words yet which  
Made it the authentic supreme day in the Kinjian calendar  
  
Africa was marching down the main street of this little harbor town today  
  
Africa in undimmed black vitality surging up out of centuries of island  
Displacement island slavery island isolation island ignorance  
  
Africa unquenchable in its burning love of life  
  
Carnival was Africa Day in Amerigo
