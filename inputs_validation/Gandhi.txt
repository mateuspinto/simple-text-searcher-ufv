I had a dream Mr King If youll beg my pardon  
I was trespassing A sacred garden  
And the blossoms fell And they dropped like candy  
And nature cried Gandhi Gandhi  
And nature cried Gandhi Gandhi  
  
When he was a boy He was afraid of the dark  
His mother would fast And pray at his feet  
And the lamp burned as he slept Slept as he dreamed  
He was dreaming of his sisters Dressed in white muslin  
Dressed in white muslin Dancing in a ring  
He was afraid of the dark And the lamp burned  
And his mother fasted And prayed as he slept  
Dreaming of blossoms They were burning his throat  
He had eaten flowers Fell burning  
Flowers fell burning From the young girls hair  
He was whispering Into his gods ear  
Let the children be so Let the children be so  
And the lamplight flickered flickered And his mother withered like Job  
And he lay there dreaming And the blossoms fell  
And Tilaks trumpet Proceeded to call  
And the blossoms fell And they dropped like candy  
And the people cried Gandhi Gandhi  
  
I had a dream Mr King If youll beg my pardon  
I was trespassing The sacred garden  
And the blossoms fell Well they dropped like candy  
And nature cried Gandhi Gandhi  
  
Hey little man Awake from your slumber  
Get em with the numbers Get em with the numbers  
  
He was frail and shy And the cast of his mind  
Was mercurial Was mercurial  
As the sacred verbs Scrawled  
In the dust On the floor  
On the floor Long live revolution  
And the spinning wheel And a handful of salt  
And a handful of salt The untouchables  
Dropped like candy They called to him  
Gandhi Gandhi The children of god  
With hands full of candy They called to him  
Gandhi Gandhi Feel our woes  
Man of the giving Rejoin the living  
Rejoin the living Awake from the net  
Where youve been sleeping And their climbing climbing  
The flowing hair And the golden flowers  
Of the young girls Well they dropped all around  
They dropped like candy And people cried  
Gandhi Gandhi Awake little man  
Awake from your slumber And get em with the numbers  
Get em with the numbers  
  
One Two Three Four hundred  
Thousand million people  
People People  
  
Awake from your slumber Awake from your slumber  
Awake from your slumber And get em with the numbers  
Get em with the numbers Long live revolution  
And the spinning wheel Awake awake  
Is the mighty appeal Oh people awake  
Awake from your slumber And get em with the numbers  
Get em with the numbers  
  
I had a dream Mr King  
If youll beg my pardon I was trespassing  
The sacred garden And the blossoms fell  
Dropped like candy And nature called  
Gandhi Gandhi Gandhi Gandhi  
  
Awake from your slumber Awake from your slumber  
And get em with the numbers Get em with the numbers
