Thinking of the faces Ive seen  
Back when I was young and green  
I was falling back then  
Now Im workin on building a fire  
And flirtin with that ol desire  
And fallin again into the wind  
I fall in love again Im fallin again  
Well youd think that I would learn by now  
To keep from falling somehow  
But Im fallin again  
Cause when I caught that look in your eyes  
Thats when I realized  
I was fallin again into the wind  
I fall in love again  
Fall fall fall fallin again  
Fall fall fall fallin again  
Fall fall fall fallin again  
I fall in love again  
Fallin again into the wind  
Fall fall fall fallin again  
Fall fall fall fallin again  
I fall in love again  
Fallin again into the wind
