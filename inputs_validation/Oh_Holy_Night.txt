Oh Holy Night  
The stars  
Are brightly shining  
It is the night of the dear  
Saviours birth  
Long lay the world in sin  
And error pining  
Til He appeared  
And the soul felt  
Its worth a thrill of hope  
The weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new  
And glorious morn  
Fall on your knees  
Oh hear the angel voices  
  
Oh night divine  
Oh night  
When Christ was born  
Oh night divine  
Oh night  
Oh Holy night  
Fall on your knees  
Oh hear the angel voices  
Oh night divine  
Oh night  
When Christ was born  
Oh night divine  
Oh night  
Oh Holy night
