Flying through the night in a beat up wagon  
A mike stand up my jacksy  
Give me a beer and Ill stand on a chair  
And slip into something sexy  
Black Cat Woolwich The Tigers Head  
The Cafe des Artistes The Revolution and the Bag O Nails  
  
Ill see you down the Speak  
Your Ma said you slept real good in your food last night  
But you couldnt hold it down  
And you broke up a damn good fight  
Ligging at the Old Marquee spinning Jack a line  
Even he knew better than me back in sixty nine  
  
Sixty nine sixty nine  
Sixty nine sixty nine  
  
On the road to Paradiso  
Back of your head got to pay some dues  
Rugged looked down as the Thames swallowed  
His life at the Boathouse Kew  
Hot girls no AC cheap TV sleep on the floor  
Hallelujah whats a roadie hush my baby sleep no more
