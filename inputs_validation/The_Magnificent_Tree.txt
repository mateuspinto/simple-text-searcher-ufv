Bought this guitar  
At a shop called mars  
But on the way back home  
Strange things happened in my car  
Started to play  
All by itself  
Creatures jumped from  
The highest shelf  
Until I touched string 12  
This magnificent tree  
Appeared in my mind  
Even without leaves  
ITS strength was divine  
Synthesized gnomes  
Penetrated this godly zone  
Summer was thrown off  
Its royal throne  
This magnificent tree  
Appeared in my mind  
Even without leaves  
Its strength was divine
