Father obented me  
I ask thee  
Raise thy hand  
We the sons of Odin  
Await thy command  
Born  
Under the sign  
Of the hammer we stand  
And here we all may die  
Our blood on the ground  
The battle horns sound  
Let thy Valkyries fly  
Chorus  
Down from the sky into the fight  
Clutched full of rage  
Full of thunder  
And glory  
Swords in the wind  
Crossing the sky  
Lords of doom bring an end to their story  
Today is the day we Die in the fight  
None shall remain  
Till last one for night  
Now Valhallas calling us immortal  
We are gods immortal  
We are Gods Of War  
Odin  
Hear the fallen wait  
To join thee  
By thy side  
Let Valhallas gates  
Open wide  
Born under the sign of the hammer  
They lived  
And here they fought and died  
There blood on the ground  
The battle horns sound  
Let thy Valkyries fly  
Chorus  
Down from the sky into the fight  
Clutched full of rage  
Full of thunder  
And glory  
Swords in the wind  
Crossing the sky  
Lords of doom bring an end to their story  
Today is the day we Die in the fight  
None shall remain  
Till last one for night  
Now Valhallas calling us immortal  
We are gods immortal  
We are Gods Of War  
Chorus  
Woooooa  
Wooooooa  
Woooooooa  
Wooooooooa  
Woooooooooa  
Woaaaa  
Wooooa
