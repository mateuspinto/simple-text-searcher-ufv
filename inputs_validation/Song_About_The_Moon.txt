If you want to write a song about the moon  
Walk along the craters in the afternoon  
When the shadows are deep and the light is alien  
And gravity leaps like a knife off the pavement  
And you want to write a song about the moon  
You want to write a spiritual tune  
Na na na na na na  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Presto a song about the moon  
  
If you want to write a song about the heart  
Think about the moon before you start  
Cause the heart will howl like a dog in the moonlight  
And the heart can explode like a pistol on a June night  
So if you want to write a song about the heart  
And its everlonging for a counterpart  
Na na na na na na  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Write a song about the moon  
  
Laughing boy laughed so hard  
He fell down from his place  
Laughing girl she laughed so hard  
Tears rolled down her face  
Wo wo  
Dont look at her  
  
If you want to write a song about a face  
That you really cant remember but you cant erase  
Oh wo  
Wash your hands and dreams and dreams and lightning  
Cut off your hair and whatever is frightening  
If you want to write a song about a face  
If you want to write a song about the human race  
Na na na na na na  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Write a song about the moon  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oooo  
  
You want to write a song about the moon  
If you want to write a spiritual tune  
Na na na na na na  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Then do it  
Write a song about the moon
