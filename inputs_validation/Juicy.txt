Yea this album is dedicated to all the teachers that told me  
Id never amount to nothing to all the people that lived above the  
Buildings that I was hustling in front of that called the police on  
Me when I was just trying to make some money to feed my daughter  
And all the niggas in the struggle you know what Im saying  
  
Its all good baby baby  
  
It was all a dream  
I used to read Word Up magazine  
Salt n Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine  
Hangin pictures on my wall  
Every Saturday Rap Attack Mr Magic Marley Marl  
I let my tape rock til my tape popped  
Smokin weed and Bambu sippin on Private Stock  
Way back when I had the red and black lumberjack  
With the hat to match  
Remember Rappin Duke duhha duhha  
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far  
Now Im in the limelight cause I rhyme tight  
Time to get paid blow up like the World Trade  
Born sinner the opposite of a winner  
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner  
Peace to Ron G Brucey B Kid Capri  
Funkmaster Flex Lovebug Starski wassup  
Im blowin up like you thought I would  
Call the crib same number same hood thats right  
Its all good its aaalll good  
And if you dont know now you know nigga  
  
Chorus  
You know very well who you are  
Dont let em hold you down reach for the stars  
You had a few but not that many  
Cause youre the only one Ill give you good and plenty  
  
I made the change from a common thief  
To up close and personal with Robin Leach  
And Im far from cheap I smoke skunk with my peeps all day  
Spread love its the Brooklyn way  
The Moet and Alize keep me pissy  
Girls used to diss me  
Now they write letters cause they miss me  
I never thought it could happen this rappin stuff  
I was too used to packin GATs and stuff  
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast  
From the Mississippi down to the east coast  
Condos in Queens indo for weeks  
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak  
Livin life without fear  
Puttin 5 karats in my baby girls ears  
Lunches brunches interviews by the pool  
Considered a fool cause I dropped out of high school  
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood  
And its still all good  
Uh and if you dont know now you know nigga  
  
Chorus  
  
Super Nintendo Sega Genesis  
When I was dead broke man I couldnt picture this  
Fifty inch screen money green leather sofa  
Got two rides a limousine with a chauffeur  
Phone bill about two Gs flat  
No need to worry my accountant handles that  
And my whole crew is lounging  
Celebrating every day no more public housing  
Thinking back on my oneroom shack  
Now my mom pimps a Ac with minks on her back  
And she loves to show me off of course  
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source  
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us  
No heat wonder why Christmas missed us  
Birthdays was the worst days  
Now we sip champagne when we thirstay  
Uh damn right I like the life I live  
Cause I went from negative to positive  
And its all  
  
Its all good  
  
Aand if you dont know now you know nigga
