Came in this morning high on a birds wing  
Quite open minded but still quite aware  
Followed the sunrise right through from dawning  
Picking out landmarks that said I was there  
Led to positions by stern faced leaders  
Who never let one smile depart from their face  
  
Then with an arm raise the slaughter is started  
One or two crack up and start to cry  
Selfishness breeds in this cesspool of sorrow  
Every few moments I see I friend die  
Synchronized watches flash in the sunlight  
As into the battle we are all led  
  
Killer killer keep your thoughts at bay  
Maiming destroying every single day  
Is this the way that you get your fun  
Slaying waylaying in the heat of the midday sun  
  
Get out get out go and do your job  
Rape and pillage squander all and rob  
You make me sick getting paid for murder  
You wouldnt lay a finger on your mother oh no  
You never ever dream to hurt her  
  
Hero hero you have done so well  
So sit back and lick your wounds cause you wont go to hell  
Take your medal wear it now with pride  
Consolation for the pain and sin you feel inside
