A world become one  
Of salads and sun  
Only a fool would say that  
A boy with a plan  
A natural man  
Wearing a white stetson hat  
Unhand that gun begone  
Theres no one to fire upon  
If hes holding it high  
Hes telling a lie  
  
Chorus  
I heard it was you  
Talkin bout a world  
Where all is free  
It just couldnt be  
And only a fool would say that  
  
The man in the street  
Draggin his feet  
Dont want to hear the bad news  
Imagine your face  
There is his place  
Standing inside his brown shoes  
You do his nine to five  
Drag yourself home half alive  
And there on the screen  
A man with a dream  
  
Chorus  
  
Anybody on the street  
Has murder in his eyes  
You feel no pain  
And youre younger  
Then you realize  
  
Chorus
