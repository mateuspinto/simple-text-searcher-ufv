Up here in space  
Im looking down on you  
My lasers trace  
Everything you do  
  
You think youve private lives  
Think nothing of the kind  
There is no true escape  
Im watching all the time  
  
Im made of metal  
My circuits gleam  
I am perpetual  
I keep the country clean  
  
Im elected electric spy  
Im protected electric eye  
  
Always in focus  
You cant feel my stare  
I zoom into you  
You dont know Im there  
  
I take a pride in probing all your secret moves  
My tearless retina takes pictures that can prove  
  
Im made of metal  
My circuits gleam  
I am perpetual  
I keep the country clean  
  
Im elected electric spy  
Im protected electric eye  
  
Electric eye in the sky  
Feel my stare always there  
Theres nothing you can do about it  
Develop and expose  
I feed upon your every thought  
And so my power grows  
  
Im made of metal  
My circuits gleam  
I am perpetual  
I keep the country clean  
  
Im elected electric spy  
Im protected electric eye  
  
Im elected electric spy  
  
Im Elected Protected Detective Electric eye
