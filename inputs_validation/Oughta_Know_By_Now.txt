You oughta know by now  
That a man cant hold on forever  
So why do you keep waiting here  
When you know it makes me want you more  
  
You oughta know by now  
How it fells to be loved  
So why dyou keep me hanging here  
With this stone around my heart dragging me down down down  
  
When all Im trying to do is trying to get next to you let me in let me in  
  
You oughta know by now  
Or maybe someone should show you  
That a man needs to be loved  
And even in this mans world  
With you it dont come easy  
  
You oughta know by now  
That no man can sleep at night  
With a burning in his heart  
That would tear this man apart  
Take me out of my misery  
  
Cause all Im trying to do is trying to get next to you let me in let me in  
  
You oughta know by now  
Just how good it feels to be wanted  
And no man could love you more  
So why cant you show me something  
Just a little bit of something  
  
You oughta know by now  
All the things a man has to do in his life  
And all these things I do  
You know that I do it all for you I do it all for you  
  
Cause all Im trying to do is trying to get next to you  
Yes all Im trying to do is trying to get next to you  
  
Let me in let me in  
Let me in your heart
