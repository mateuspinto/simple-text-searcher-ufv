If you read in the paper that I went away  
Would it make any difference to you  
If I packed my things and left town today  
Would it make any difference to you  
  
Do you do you even know  
Do you even know that Im still alive  
  
Oh I wonder  
I wonder if I ever oh cross  
If I ever cross your sweet mind  
  
If I got in if I got into trouble  
Would I send for you  
Would you come would you come  
Or would you stay away  
  
If we never love again  
Like we used to do  
Would it make oh  
Would it make any difference to you
