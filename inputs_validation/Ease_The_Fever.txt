No need talking  
I cant see it  
Someone set your heart on fire  
Now shes gone and all she left is hurt  
Lots of burning sweet desire  
  
Chorus  
So let me ease the fever and erase the pain  
Let me make a believer out of you again  
Hold me close and let me love the tears away  
Let me ease the fever and erase the pain  
  
Let your tears fall on my shoulder  
Let your arms around me tight  
Yesterday is gone forever  
Lets make tomorrow start tonight  
  
Chorus x3
