Basic elemental  
Instinct to survive  
Stirs the higher passions  
Thrill to be alive  
  
Alternating currents  
In a tidewater surge  
Rational resistance  
To an unwise urge  
Anything can happen  
  
From the point of conception  
To the moment of truth  
At the point of surrender  
To the burden of proof  
  
From the point of ignition  
To the final drive  
The point of the journey  
Is not to arrive  
Anything can happen  
  
Basic temperamental  
Filters on our eyes  
Alter our perceptions  
Lenses polarize  
  
Alternating currents  
Force a show of hands  
Rational responses  
Force a change of plans  
Anything can happen  
  
From a point on the compass  
To magnetic north  
The point of the needle  
Moving back and forth  
  
From the point of entry  
Until the candle is burned  
The point of departure  
Is not to return  
Anything can happen  
  
I set the wheels in motion  
Turn up all the machines  
Activate the programs  
And run behind the scene  
  
I set the clouds in motion  
Turn up light and sound  
Activate the window  
And watch the world go round  
  
Anything can happen
