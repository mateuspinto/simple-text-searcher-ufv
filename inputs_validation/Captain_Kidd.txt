Chorus  
My name is Captain Kidd  
As I sailed as I sailed  
Oh my name is Captain Kidd as I sailed  
My name is Captain Kidd  
And Gods laws I did forbid  
And most wickedly I did as I sailed  
  
My father taught me well  
To shun the gates of hell  
But against him I rebelled as I sailed  
He shoved a bible in my hand  
But I left it in the sand  
And I pulled away from land  
As I sailed  
  
Chorus  
  
I murdered William Moore  
And I left him in his gore  
Twenty leagues away from shore  
As I sailed  
And being crueler still the gunner did I kill  
All his precious blood did spill  
As I sailed  
  
Chorus  
  
I was sick and nigh to death  
And I vowed at every breath  
Oh to walk in wisdoms path  
As I sailed  
But my repentance lasted not  
My vows I soon forgot  
Oh damnation is my lot  
As I sailed  
  
Chorus  
  
To the execution dock  
Lay my head upon the block  
Laws no more Ill mock as I sail  
So take warning here and heed  
To shun bad company  
Or youll wind up just like me  
As I sailed
