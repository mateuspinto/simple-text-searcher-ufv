Girl we made it to the top  
we went so high we couldnt stop  
we climbed the ladder leading us nowhere  
Two of us together building castles in the air  
We spun so fast we couldnt tell  
the gold ring from the carousel  
How could we know the right would turnout bad  
Everything we wanted was everything we had  
I miss the Hungry Years  
the once upon a time  
the lovely long ago  
we didnt a dime  
those days of me and you  
we lost along the way  
how could I be so blind  
not to see the door  
closing on the World  
I now hunger for  
Looking through my tears  
I miss the Hungry years  
We shared our day dreams one by one  
Making plans was so much fun  
We set our goals and reached the highest star  
Things that we were after were much better from afar  
Here we stand just me and you  
with everything and nothing too  
It wasnt worth the price we had to pay  
Honey take me home Lets go back to yesterday  
I miss the Hungry Years  
the once upon a time the lovely long ago  
we didnt have a dime  
those days of me and you  
we lost along the way  
how could I be so blind  
not to see the door  
closing on the World I now hunger for  
Looking through my tears  
I miss the Hungry years  
I miss the Hungry Years
