When I m feelin down  
I do a little dance  
Beyond the wall of tears  
There is a second chance  
  
In the city in the meadow  
In the village in the park  
On the highway in the jungle  
I wanna take your hand in mine  
  
When I am feelin sad  
I sing a little song  
Beyond the wall of tears  
Nobody s right or wrong  
  
In the city in the meadow  
In the village in the park  
On the highway in the jungle  
I wanna take your hand in mine  
  
If our hands are tied  
Were gonna cut the rope  
Together you and me  
Dance the dance of hope  
  
In the city in the meadow  
In the village in the park  
On the highway in the jungle  
I wanna take your hand in mine  
I wanna take your hand in mine
