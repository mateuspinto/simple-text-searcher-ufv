Im Everlast born to be a caucassion but it makes no difference what
persuasion you are  
As long as you know how to get up on the floor and start workin a sweat  
To a musical measure that makes you move as soon as the needle drops into the
groove  
So get up and dance to the gift Im giving forget about your troubles get
into the rhythm  
Talking bout the rhythm all we need is rhythm

You linger for the rap singer when Donald D brings the party to the deal my

Listen to the tracks that rolls watch the mic as it glows  
The lethal weapon got you trapped in this dance mode  
IceTs throwin words at you like dodge ball yall  
You gotta move get hit if you get hit you fall no jokin no boastin and
no bragging  
Grip the mic like a 44 magnum dust you off if you suck cause I aint  
You want me to write soft rhymes sorry I write the rhythm
