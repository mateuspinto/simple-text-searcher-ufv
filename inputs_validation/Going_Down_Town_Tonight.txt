Im going down town tonight Im gonna find myself a dream  
Im gonna dress up right and be the best theyve ever seen  
You can tell from their eyes you can tell from their eyes  
That theyre never impressed that theyre never impressed  
From the way they walk round from the way they walk round  
They are used to the best they are used to the best  
Going down town tonight going down town tonight  
Going down town tonight going down town tonight  
Why let them break you in with selfsophisticated praise  
cause when the cards are low you see the smile come on their face  
If you speak the right words if you speak the right words  
They will hear what you say they will hear what you say  
They will take your attention just take your attention  
And then turn away and then turn away  
Going down town tonight going down town tonight  
Going down town tonight going down town tonight  
Just one thing before you go my ladies of the night  
Just one thing I have to say Ive got you and youre  
Confident and debonair you move between the stars  
Hungry for those staring eyes that fill your waking hours  
Going down town tonight going down town tonight  
Going down town tonight going down town tonight  
Going down town tonight going down town tonight  
Your face is all run dry with all the echoes of the night  
And so Im home alone I wash my head and hold on tight  
If you speak the right words if you speak the right words  
They will hear what you say they will hear what you say  
They will take your attention just take your attention  
And then turn away and then turn away  
Going down town tonight going down town tonight  
Going down town tonight going down town tonight  
Going down town tonight going down town tonight  
Going down town tonight going down town tonight  
Going down town tonight going down town tonight
