I dont know what to say  
I dont know where the light shines  
Its a grey dawn rising on a green hill  
And theres so much behind us  
  
I dont know where we go  
I sure feel theres something out there  
Theres a great awakening and a new morning  
And your spirits pounding loud and clear  
  
If the river can bend  
Ill find you waiting  
Home at last from the wild sea  
All the twists and turns  
Weve made together  
All the boats you rocked  
With your harmony  
If the river can bend  
If the river can bend  
If the river can bend  
If the river can bend  
  
Come and embrace the struggle  
But win or lose we live here  
Build a new beginning on an old rock  
Breathe deep of the sweet fresh air
