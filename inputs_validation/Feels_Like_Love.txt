Look what my heart has gotten into  
The sweetest gift I ever knew  
Its even better than my favorite shoes  
Look what my heart has found in you  
  
Chorus  
Feels like sunshine feels like rain  
Lord it feels like love finally called my name  
I want to jump and shout I want to sing and dance  
Lord it feels like love wants a second chance  
  
Look what my heart can clearly see  
How much I crave your company  
A true companion I will always be  
Look what my heart has done to me  
  
Chorus  
  
Looks like my heart has become  
The safest place for us to run  
Ill be here for you when the day is done  
Looks like my heart has found someone  
  
Chorus
