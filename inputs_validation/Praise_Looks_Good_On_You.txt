Verse 1  
When you lift Your hands up high  
And you sing a song of praise to Me  
It brings Me great delight  
Such a lovely sight  
And yes it is true  
Praise looks good on You  
Morning night and noon  
Your praise ascends to heaven  
Like the smell of sweet perfume  
Filling every room  
And yes it is true  
Praise looks good on You  
  
Chorus  
You bring your sacrifices  
And you offer up your praise  
You lift your voice with singing  
But your heart seems far away  
More than a sacrifice  
I am looking for your life  
Holy and acceptable  
And pleasing in my sight  
  
Verse 2  
So offer up your lives  
Holy and acceptable  
A willing sacrifice  
Precious in my sight  
But in all that you do  
Remember all I want is You  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Verse 3  
So lift your hands up high  
And worship Him before the altar  
Consecrate your life  
A willing sacrifice  
But in all that you do  
Remember all He wants is You  
And yes it is true  
Praise looks good on you
