In a small moment  
She accepted credit for something she did not do  
She said shed done the water color in her bedroom  
But it was done by a friend from school  
Just a little lie  
No one would discover  
At least not very soon  
  
In a small moment  
Just a little lie  
When she wasnt looking it just slipped on by  
  
In a small moment  
In a restaurant where she worked the late night shift  
She short changed a sailor and made five  
You could never really call it a theft  
Just a little lie  
Swept up in her apron and kept as a well deserved gift  
In a small moment  
Just a little lie  
When she wasnt looking it just slipped on by  
  
In a small moment  
She cheated on her lover and placed it in the back of her mind  
As long as nobody knew the truth about her  
It could never really be unkind  
Just a little lie  
That slipped beside her as she tossed and turned in her alibis  
  
In a small moment  
Just a little lie  
When she wasnt looking it just slipped on by  
Just a little lie  
When she wasnt looking it just slipped on by  
Slipped on by
