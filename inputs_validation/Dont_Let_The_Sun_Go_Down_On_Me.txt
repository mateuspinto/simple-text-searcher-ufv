I cant light no more of your darkness  
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white  
Im growing tired and time stands still before me  
Frozen here on the ladder of my life  
  
Too late to save myself from falling  
I took a chance and changed your way of life  
But you misread my meaning when I met you  
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light  
  
Dont let the sun go down on me  
Although I search myself its always someone else I see  
Id just allow a fragment of your life to wander free  
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me  
  
I cant find oh the right romantic line  
But see me once and see the way I feel  
Dont discard me just because you think I mean you harm  
But these cuts I have they need love to help them heal
