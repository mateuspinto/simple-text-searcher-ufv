Saturday midnight  
  
At midnight that same night the Lafaettes were slipping  
At midnight that same night there is a shadow creeping  
  
Salem is moving without a sound  
Salem is moving moving moving to the burial ground  
  
So hot and so quiet only the leaves are shaking  
By one of the graves Doctor le Croix is waiting  
  
Salem is moving without a sound  
Salem is moving moving moving to the burial ground  
  
Doctor Le Croix shaking the hand of Salem  
My my my my my God Salem tell me the secret  
My my my my my God this makes me feel uneasy  
  
In shock Le Croix is terrified this could be the end  
Fear turns to hate Great Wanga will befall the Lafayettes  
  
Salem help me save us Salem help me save us  
By turning them to dust  
  
So take this money and off you go  
To Madame Saritas Boutique of Voodoo  
A snake curse and a little Goofer Dust  
You Salem will be the link between them and us  
This could be an easy way to turn the Lafayettes to dead  
  
Two hours later Salem leaves Madame Sarita  
My my my my my God Salem is looking scary  
My my my my my God now hes heading for the cemetery  
  
Kneeling in front of the graves  
A handful of soil and Salem is on his way  
He must leave a copper penny as payment for the soil  
And to protect himself  
From all the spirits that could come and dig themselves  
Into his head dead dead dead Salem is here  
  
By the house in the dark there is a shadow digging  
The snake in the bottle is buried and its ready  
  
Salem is moving without a sound  
Everyones sleeping but me cause I dont need it  
No
