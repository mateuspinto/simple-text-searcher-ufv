Walking alone tonight  
Cause Ive only got room for two  
Me and my burdened black heart  
Its all we know how to do  
  
Yet I look for a bigger bang  
Than the kind I continually see  
Sick of all this inertia  
Oh wont you mend me  
  
Lover can you help me  
Im a child lost in the woods  
A black heart pollutes me  
And I think  
  
Youre a mountain that Id like to climb  
Not to conquer but to share in the view  
  
Pulled by a false inertia  
Pushed out by circumstance  
Pistol firing at my feet  
Thats coercing me to dance  
  
Yet I look for a bigger bang  
Than the kind Im sorry to know  
Here I am first foot of the climb  
Watch me go  
  
Lover can you help me  
Im a child lost in the woods  
A lit path eludes me  
And I think  
  
Youre a mountain that Id like to climb  
Not to conquer but to share in the view  
Youre a bonfire and Im gathered round you  
Set this old black heart inertia aflame  
Send it away  
Send it away  
Send it away  
Send it away  
Send it away  
Send it away  
Send it away  
Send it away  
  
Youre a mountain that Id like to climb  
Not to conquer but to share in the view  
Youre a bonfire and Im gathered round you  
Set this old black heart inertia aflame  
  
Set it aflame send it away  
Set it aflame send it away  
Set it aflame send it away  
Set it aflame send it away  
Set it aflame send it away  
Set it aflame send it away
