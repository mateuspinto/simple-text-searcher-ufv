Throw away your old address book  
Of the guys you used to know  
Get all dressed up in your best look  
Ill take you to the movie show  
You look lovely when youre angry  
But I love the way you smile  
We could while away the hours  
Or we could walk another mile  
My darling dont you ever change  
I dont think Id be quite the same  
I thought I was in control  
I thought I was in control  
If I knew then what I know now  
Of the chances at the time  
Didnt know that Id be missing  
A chance to lay it on the line  
I could have asked you if you needed  
Or maybe wanted to get out  
But it didnt really matter  
We got together anyhow  
My darling dont you ever change  
I dont think Id be quite the same  
I thought I was in control  
I thought I was in control  
Threw away your old address book  
Took a while to realize  
Youd be better off with someone  
What I mean is me and mine  
So what ya doing at the weekend  
Shall we make it Friday night  
Anywhere you fancy going  
And anyway with mes alright  
My darling dont you ever change  
I dont think Id be quite the same  
I thought I was in control  
I thought I was in control  
My darling dont you ever change  
I dont think Id be quite the same  
I thought I was in control  
I thought I was in control
