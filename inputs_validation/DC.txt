Bribing me We come We watched how  
Were last to throw our pennies  
A passive tramps lifts her skirt  
And asks us then we throw them down to her  
  
And I know why I will always follow you  
Anywhere my brother leads me to  
  
We dont want to live in the sun  
Just to keep them happy for awhile  
Midnight and Frank freaks out and reaches God and  
Fairly tied up too  
  
But I know why I will always follow you  
Anywhere my brother leads me to  
And I remember wanting to be you  
And pray to God that we would all pull through  
Cause I know why I will always follow you  
If youre my brother then I will follow you  
  
Lifelong friends threw bottle ends  
And yell in the air like lifelong enemies  
Whos stronger whos lived longer  
World quarrels and grandkids on your knee  
  
Cause I know I will always follow  
Anywhere my brother leads me to  
And I remember wanting to be you  
And pray to God that we would all pull through  
Cause I know why I will always follow you  
If youre my brother then I will follow you  
  
Cause I know why I will always follow  
I will follow you and I will  
I know why I will always follow  
I will follow you and I will
