Now a country boy named Shorty  
And a city boy named Dan  
Had to prove who could run the fastest  
To wed Miss Lucys hand  
  
Now Dan had all the money  
And he also had the looks  
But Shorty musta had that something boys  
That cant be found in books  
  
Cut across Shorty Shorty cut across  
Thats what Miss Lucy said  
Cut across Shorty Shorty cut across  
You know its you that I want to wed  
  
Wait a minute  
Now Dan had been in training  
About a week before the race  
He made up his mind old Shorty  
Would end in second place  
You know Dan with his long legs flying  
He left Shorty far behind  
Shorty heard him holler out  
Miss Lucy that youll soon be mine  
  
Cut across Shorty Shorty cut across  
Thats what Miss Lucy said  
Cut across Shorty Shorty cut across  
You know its you that I want to wed  
  
But Shorty wasnt worried  
There was a smile upon his face  
Cause old Lucy had fixed the race  
And just like that old story  
About the turtle and the hare you know that thing  
When Danny crossed over the finish line  
He found Shorty waiting there  
  
Cut across Shorty Shorty cut across  
Thats what Miss Lucy said  
Cut across Shorty Shorty cut across  
You know its you that I want to wed  
  
Its you that I want to wed no no  
And oh Lord its you I want to wed  
Its you that I want to wed
