Here I go again  
Just gonna play it like a fool again  
Here I go again  
Over you  
Over you  
Im just like a bell again  
You know Im starting to ring again  
Here I go again  
Over you  
Over you  
Typically when I had it  
Treated it like dirt  
Now naturally when I dont have it  
I am chasing less and less rainbows  
Here we go again  
I guess Im like a fool again  
Here I go again  
Over you  
Over you  
Over you  
Over you
