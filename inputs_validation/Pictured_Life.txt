Ooh Dark meditation  
Your second sight can show my light  
In a crystal ball  
Sweet are the days intoxication  
Crowblack the nights caging my mind  
Behind the wall  
  
Into the rock through walls of red dreams  
Into the rock to find the cream  
Into the rock through walls of red dreams  
Pictured life from yesterday  
  
Ooh Dark meditation  
Deep down inside a stream of light  
Begins to flow  
Sweet are the days intoxication  
Crowblack the nights caging my mind  
Behind the wall  
  
Into the rock through walls of red dreams  
Into the rock to find the cream  
Into the rock through walls of red dreams  
Pictured life from yesterday  
  
Pictured life pictured life  
Pictured life from yesterday
