Now I greet you from the other side of sorrow and despair with a love so vast  
And so shattered it will reach you everywhere  
  
And I sing this for the captain whose ship has not been built for the mother
in  
Confusion her cradle still unfilled  
  
For the heart with no companion for the soul without a king for the prima  
Ballerina who cannot dance to anything  
  
Through the days of shame that are coming through the nights of wild
distress  
Though your promise count for nothing you must keep it nonetheless  
  
You must keep it for the captain whose ship has not been built for the mother
in  
Confusion her cradle still unfilled  
  
For the heart with no companion for the soul without a king for the prima  
Ballerina who cannot dance to anything
