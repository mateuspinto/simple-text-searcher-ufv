Your knuckles whiten on the wheel  
The last thing that your hands will feel  
Your final flight cant be delayed  
  
No land just sky its so serene  
Your pink fat lips let go a scream  
You fry and melt I love the scene  
  
Sometimes I fantasize  
When the streets are cold and lonely  
And the cars they burn below me  
Dont these times  
Fill your eyes  
When the streets are cold and lonely  
And the cars they burn below me  
Are you all alone  
Is anybody home  
  
Im standing warm against the cold  
Now that the flames have taken hold  
At least you left your life at style  
  
And for as far as I can see  
Tin twisted grills grin back at me  
Bad money dies I love the scene  
  
Sometimes I fantasize  
When the streets are cold and lonely  
And the cars they burn below me  
Dont these times  
Fill your eyes  
When the streets are cold and lonely  
And the cars they burn below me  
Are you all alone  
Is anybody home  
  
Sometimes I fantasize  
When the streets are cold and lonely  
And the cars they burn below me  
Dont these times  
Fill your eyes  
When the streets are cold and lonely  
And the cars they burn below me  
Are you all alone  
Are you made of stone
