Woke up sweating from a dream  
With a different kind of feeling  
All day long my heart was beating searching for the meaning  
Hazel eyes I was so color blind  
We were just wasting time  
For my own life we never crossed the line  
Only friends in my mind  
But now I realize it was always you  
Cant believe I couldnt not see it all this time all this time  
It was always you  
Now I know why my heart wasnt satisfied satisfied  
It was always you you  
  
No more saying who  
Looking by now I know it was always you always you  
All my hidden desires finally came alive  
No I never talk lies to you so I will start tonight  
Hazel eyes I was so color blind  
We were just wasting time  
For my own life we never crossed the line  
Only friends in my mind  
But now I realize it was always you  
Cant believe I couldnt not see it all this time all this time  
It was always you  
Now I know that my heart wasnt satisfied satisfied  
It was always you you  
  
Woke up sweating from a dream  
With a different kind of feeling  
  
It was always you  
Even if I couldnt not see it all this time all this time  
It was always you  
Now I know that my heart wasnt satisfied satisfied  
It was always you you
