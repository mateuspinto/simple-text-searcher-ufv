The weekend is back  
But so is he  
Head to the floodlights  
See the fraternity  
They are waiting  
I hear them up in the north  
And down in the south  
And all that is spewing  
Spewing out of his mouth  
  
Entertain me  
  
At his and hers dating  
Bored minds agree  
Requirements to be stated  
Replies awaited  
She wants a loose fit  
He wants instant whip  
He guesstimates her arrival  
Will she want it really badly  
  
Entertain me  
  
A car a house both in a street  
The boredom of the sober week  
The weekends here hip hip hooray  
To make the blues just go away  
  
Entertain me
