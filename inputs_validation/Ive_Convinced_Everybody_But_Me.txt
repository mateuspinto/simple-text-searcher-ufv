The guys down at the job all want to know  
How things are going since I let you go  
I laugh and say my heart aint missed a beat  
Ive convinced everybody but me  
  
Im all right Im okay  
Thats what I always say  
When they ask me how Im doing without you  
I say Im glad Im free and if they all believe  
Ive convinced everybody but me  
  
Im the life of the party every night  
Nobody knows Im dyin deep inside  
I dont hurt at all as far as they can see  
Ive convinced everybody but me  
  
Im all right Im okay  
Thats what I always say  
When they ask me how Im doing without you  
I say Im glad Im free and if they all believe  
Ive convinced everybody but me  
  
I smile in every mirror  
Like Im such a happy man  
But my heart knows what a liar I am  
  
Im all right Im okay  
Thats what I always say  
When they ask me how Im doing without you  
I say Im glad Im free and if they all believe  
Ive convinced everybody but me  
  
Yes Ive convinced everybody but me
