It took a lot of reasoning  
Before she got to please him  
She made a combination  
Of despair and inspiration  
A mother and a mistress  
A sister to her sisters  
A child who hoped her dreams come true  
But now shes only stuck with you  
  
At least she has a home to share  
A man who comes to do her hair  
A garden with a patio  
A place to have a barbecue  
The envy of her neighbors  
Who smile and wave and ask her  
If they could live for just a day  
In luxury and ecstasy  
  
But its a long way home  
From where shes come  
And its a long way back  
Too much to ask  
  
The trash is in the garbage can  
The mystery of wonderland  
One day she thinks of leaving him  
The next she treats him like a king  
She hears it on the radio  
She sees it on the video  
She wait s until the kids have grown  
And then she thinks shell start again  
  
But its a long way home  
From where shes come  
And its a long way back  
Too much to ask  
  
Before she gave her friends a ring  
She promised almost everything  
They ran away to paradise  
But everything will have its price  
From woman number one  
To woman number two  
Now shes woman number three  
And she thinks that shes lucky  
  
But its a long way home  
From where wheres come  
And its a long way back  
Too much to ask  
  
From X Y Z  
To women III
