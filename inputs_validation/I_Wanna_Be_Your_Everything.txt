The first time I looked in your eyes I knew  
That I would do anything for you  
The first time you touched my face I felt  
What I had never felt with anyone else  
I wanna give back what youve given to me  
And I wanna witness all of your dreams  
Now that youve shown me who I really am  
I wanna be more than just your man  
  
I wanna be the wind that fills your sails  
And Be the hand that lifts your veil  
And Be the moon that moves your tides  
The sun coming up in your eyes  
Be the wheel that never rusts  
And be the spark that lights you up  
All that youve been dreaming of and more  
So much more I wanna be your everything  
  
When you wake up Ill be the first thing you see  
And when it gets dark you can reach out to me  
Ill cherish your words  
Ill finish your thoughts  
And Ill be your compass baby when you get lost  
  
I wanna be the wind that fills your sails  
And be the hand that lifts your veil  
Be the moon that moves your tides  
The sun coming up in your eyes  
Be the wheel that never rusts  
Be the spark that lights you up  
All that youve been dreaming of and more  
So much more I wanna be your everything  
  
Ill be the wheel that never rusts  
And be the spark that lights you up  
All that youve been dreaming of and more  
So much more I wanna be your everything  
I wanna be your everything  
I wanna be your everything
