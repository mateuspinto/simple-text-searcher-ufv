Heaven today has gone away  
To a place I once called home  
Heart of a child one final sigh  
As another love goes cold  
Once my heart beat to the  
Rhythm of the falling snow  
Blackened below the river now flows  
A stream of mountain virgin snow  
  
Chorus  
For the heart Ill never have  
For the child forever gone  
The music flows because it longs  
For the heart I once had  
  
Living today without a place  
To understand the weight of the world  
Faded and torn old and forlorn  
My weak and hoping heart  
For the child for the night  
For the heart I once had  
I believe and foresee  
Everything I could ever be  
  
Chorus  
  
Time will not heal  
A dead boys scars  
Time will kill  
  
Chorus
