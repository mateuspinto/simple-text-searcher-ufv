Well always be together  
Well make it through until the end  
And I will always love you  
And we will be much more than friends  
Ill build my life around you  
And Ill do anything for you  
No walls will bind around us  
And show the world our love is true  
  
Share my love with you my darling together  
Let the love shine between us forever  
  
You came along when I was down  
And lifted me up to higher ground  
You gave me strength to live each moment  
And fill my world with the brightest thing  
  
Share my love with you my darling together  
Let the love shine between us forever  
  
Our love will shine forever  
Well turn the darkness into day  
Love will bind us together  
To make our world a brighter place  
  
Share my love with you my darling together  
Let the love shine between us forever  
  
Share my love  
Let the love shine between us forever  
  
Share my love with you my darling together
