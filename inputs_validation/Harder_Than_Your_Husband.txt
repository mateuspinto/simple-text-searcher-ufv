We must say goodbye  
Theres no need for you to cry  
Its better that I tell you this tonight  
Our affair has been quite heated  
You thought I was what you needed  
But the time has come my darlin  
To set things right cause  
Ill be harder than yer husband  
To get along with  
Harder than yer husband every night  
Harder than yer husband  
Harder than yer husband  
An I dont want our love affair  
To end with a fight  
You been like a little angel  
How you loved me  
I appreciate the warmth of your embrace  
Well the world dont need to know  
How I adored you  
But theres somethin I must tell you darlin  
Face to face  
Ill be harder than yer husband  
To get along with

An I dont want our love affair  
To end with a fight  
So its adios adios my little darlin

When you cry  
There are things that trouble me  
And Im sure that you must see  
That it breaks my heart the same as yours
