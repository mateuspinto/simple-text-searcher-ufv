I hear the drizzle of the rain  
Like a memory it falls  
Soft and warm continuing  
Tapping on my roof and walls  
  
And from the shelter of my mind  
Through the window of my eyes  
I gaze beyond the raindrenched streets  
To England where my heart lies  
  
My minds distracted and diffused  
My thoughts are many miles away  
They lie with you when youre asleep  
And kiss you when you start your day  
  
And a song I was writing is left undone  
I dont know why I spend my time  
Writing songs I cant believe  
With words that tear and strain to rhyme  
  
And so you see I have come to doubt  
All that I once held as true  
I stand alone without beliefs  
The only truth I know is you  
  
And as I watch the drops of rain  
Weave their weary paths and die  
I know that I am like the rain  
There but for the grace of you go I
