Swing in this tree  
Oh I am bounce around so well  
Branch to branch  
Limb to limb you see  
All in a days dream  
Im stuck  
Like the other monkeys here  
I am a humble monkey  
Sitting up in here again  
But then came the day  
I climbed out of these safe limbs  
Ventured away  
Walking tall head high up and singing  
I went to the city  
Car horns corners and the gritty  
Now I am the proudest monkey youve ever seen  
Monkey see monkey do  
  
Then comes the day  
Staring at myself I turn to question me  
I wonder do I want the simple simple life that I once lived in well  
Oh things were quiet then  
In a way they were the better days  
But now I am the proudest monkey youve ever seen  
Monkey see monkey do  
Monkey see monkey do
