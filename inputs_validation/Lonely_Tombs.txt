e I was strollin one day in a lonely graveyard  
When a voice from the tomb seemed to b7 say  
I once e lived as you live walked and talked as you talk  
But from earth I was b7 soon called a e way  
Chorus  
e oh those tombs oh those tombs  
Lonely tombs lonely tombs   
Seemed to say in a low gentle b7 tone  
Oh how e sweet oh how sweet  
Is the rest is the rest  
In our beautiful b7 heavenly e home  
Every voice from the tomb seemed to whisper and say  
Livin man you must soon follow me  
And I thought as I gazed on that cold marble slab  
What a sad lonesome place that must be  
Repeat chorus  
I then came to the place where my mother did lay  
And her voice soft and low from the tomb  
It said son Im at rest with the savior above  
I am safe in my heavenly home  
Repeat chorus
