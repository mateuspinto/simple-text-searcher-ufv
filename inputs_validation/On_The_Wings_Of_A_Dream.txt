Yesterday I had a dream about dying  
About laying to rest and then flying  
How the moment at hand  
Is the only thing we really own  
And I lay in my bed and I wonder  
After all has been said and is done for  
Why is it thus we are here  
And so soon we are gone  
  
Is this life just a path  
To the place that we all have come from  
Does the heart know the way  
And if not can it ever be found  
In a smile or a tear  
Or a prayer or a sigh or a song  
  
And if so I sing for my father  
And in truth you must know I would rather  
He were here by my side  
We could fly on the wings of a dream  
To a place where the spirit could find us  
And joy and surrender would bind us  
We are one anyway  
Anyway we are more than we seem  
  
There are those who will lead us  
Protect us each step of the way  
From beginning to end  
For each moment forever each day  
Such a gift has been given  
It can never be taken away  
  
Though the body in passing must leave us  
There is one who remains to receive us  
There are those in this life  
Who are friends from our heavenly home  
So I listen to the voices inside me  
For I know they are there just to guide me  
And my faith will proclaim it is so  
We are never alone  
  
From the life to the light  
From the dark of the night to the dawn  
He is so in my heart  
He is here he could never be gone  
Though the singer is silent  
There still is the truth of the song  
  
Yesterday I had a dream about dying  
About laying to rest and then flying  
How the moment at hand  
Is the only thing we really own  
  
And I lay in my bed and I wonder  
After all has been said and is done for  
Why is it thus we are here  
And so soon we are gone  
Why is it thus we are here  
And so soon we are gone
