And the rain will fall it falls for you  
And the clouds will break into tears  
You should be here standing so near to me  
  
Cept I know you should be sad  
But give me time alone to get it out of my mind  
Though say I know its only the weather  
Cause every time it rains you are gone  
And Im blue  
Then I wake up then I wake up  
  
And the sun will shine if just for you  
And the trees will talk to the skies whispering lies  
Heaven will pass to me yeah  
Trains walk by and the birds disappear  
Oh Why am I still here without you by my side  
So I cry your name and love  
The thought to me is back and how near  
Then I wake up then I grow up  
  
And the rain will fall  
It falls for you  
And the clouds will break  
It should be near  
And the sun will shine  
If just for you  
And the love
