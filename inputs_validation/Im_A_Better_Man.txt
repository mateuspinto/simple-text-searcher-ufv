If I could catch a star before it touched the ground  
Id place it in a box tie ribbons all around  
And then Id offer it to you  
A token of my love and deep devotion  
The worlds a better place  
With you to turn to  
Im a better man  
For having loved you  
  
And now at last I face the future unafraid  
With you here by my side how fast the shadows fade  
And there is hope inside my heart  
Cause I have something wonderful to live for  
The worlds a better place  
With you to turn to  
Im a better man  
For having loved you  
  
And as I am today  
Thats how ll always stay  
A better man for having loved you  
A better man for having loved you  
  
The worlds a better place  
With you to turn to  
Im a better man  
For having loved you  
And as I am today  
Thats how Ill always stay  
A better man for having loved you  
A better man for having loved you  
  
If I could catch a star before it touched the ground  
Id place it in a box tie ribbons all around  
And then Id offer it to you
