Well I plopped down in my easy chair and turned on Channel Two  
A bad gun slinger called Salty Sam was a chasin poor Sweet Sue  
He trapped her in the old sawmill and he said with an evil laugh  
If you dont gimme the deed to your ranch Ill saw you all in half  
And then he grabbed her and then he tied her up and then  
He turned on the buzz saw and then and then  
Eh eh and then along came Jones tall thin Jones  
Slow walking Jones deep voice slow talking Jones along came long lean lanky
Jones  
  
Well commercial came on so I got up to get myself a snack  
You should have seen what was going on by the time I got back  
Down in the old abandoned mine sweet Sue was a havin fits  
That villain said gimme the deed to your ranch or Ill blow you all to bits  
And then he grabbed her and then he tied her up and then  
He lit the fuse to the dynamite and then and then  
Eh eh and then along came Jones  
  
Well I got so bugged I turned it off and turned on another show  
But there was the same old shootem up and the same old rodeo  
Salty Sam was a tryin to stuff Sweet Sue in a burlap sack  
He said if you dont give me the deed to your ranch  
Im gonna throw you on the railroad track  
And then he grabbed her and then he tied her up and then  
A train started coming and then and then eh eh and then along came Jones
