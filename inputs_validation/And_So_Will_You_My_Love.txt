The musics stopped the crowd is thinnin now  
One phase of night has reached an ending now  
And nothin nothin lasts forever  
Except forever and you my love  
  
And so will you my love  
My love  
  
The street is dark here while I walk alone  
An since youve gone I always walk alone  
Cause nothin nothin lasts forever  
Except forever and you my love  
  
And so will you my love  
My love  
  
And so will you my love  
Your memories always near  
Wherever I am found  
Your memories still around  
  
The dawn an I arrive at home at last  
Night turns its lonely face toward the past  
Cause nothin nothin lasts forever  
Except forever and you my love  
  
And so will you my love  
My love
