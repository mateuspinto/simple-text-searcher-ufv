Though the world has changed  
Were still the same  
You know that I love you  yeah  
Though the world has changed  
  
Were still the same  
You know that I love you  yeah yeah  
Counting the months and the years  
When I lived alone  
  
The days were so bleak  
And the nights were so black and cold  
Walkin around in the street  
In the pouring rain  
  
Hanging round waitin for love  
But it never came  
Suddenly you were there  
Though I never thought about you  
  
Now that the world has changed  
Its so strange how I found you  
Sharing a secret that no one  
Could understand  
  
Feeling brave in my heart  
Yet too scared to let go of your hand  
Runnin wild in the streets  
Just the way all the young lovers do  
  
You only livin for me  
And me only for you  
Suddenly life had changed  
When you said I love you  
  
And though the words were plain  
Its so strange  
You said I love you  
And oh how my life has changed  
  
After searchin in vain  
I found you  
  
Though the world has changed  
Were still the same  I still love you  
Though the world has changed  
Aah were still the same whyknow I love you  
  
One night I thought that you were gone  
What could I do  
Runnin around in the pouring rain  
Lookin for you  
  
Wondering if Id ever see you again  
Then through the darkness  
I heard you calling my name  
Loving you when youre not there  
  
Im never lonely anywhere  
Outside the world has changed  
Were the same  
I still love you  
  
And though the world has changed  
The words are the same  
You know I love you
