Once I was a slave at the sawmill  
Talk about a poor boy talk about a poor boy  
Let me have a dollar bill  
My work was so hard at the sawmill  
Talk about a poor boy talk about a poor boy  
Let me have a dollar bill  
See my teardrops falling down my wife left this sawmill town  
She said sawmills life had been a sin  
The gravy were much too thin  
I cant work no more at the sawmill  
Talk about a poor boy talk about a poor boy  
Let me have a dollar bill  
If you take your wife to the sawmill  
How you gonna please her how you gonna please her  
When she wants a dollar bill  
Shell run away and leave you at the sawmill  
Women like a dollar women like a dollar Yes and women always will  
See my teardrops falling down my wife left this sawmill town  
She said sawmills life had been a sin  
The gravy were much too thin I cant work no more at the sawmill  
Yes and women like a dollar yes and women like a dollar  
Yes and women always will
