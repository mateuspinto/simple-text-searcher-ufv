Let me tell you a story to chill the bones  
About a thing that I saw  
One night wandering in the everglades  
Id one drink but no more  
  
I was rambling enjoying the bright moonlight  
Gazing up at the stars  
Not aware of a presence so near to me  
Watching my every move  
  
Feeling scared and I fell to my knees  
As something rushed me from the trees  
Took me to an unholy place  
And that is where I fell from grace  
  
Then they summoned me over to join in with them  
To the dance of the dead  
Into the circle of fire I followed them  
Into the middle I was led  
  
As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear  
But still I wanted to go  
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me  
As I walked onto the coals  
  
And I felt I was in a trance  
And my spirit was lifted from me  
And if only someone had the chance  
To witness what happened to me  
  
And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them  
All had death in their eyes  
Lifeless figures they were undead all of them  
They had ascended from hell  
  
As I danced with the dead  
My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me  
Below my undead body  
Just danced the circle of dead  
  
Until the time came to reunite us both  
My spirit came back down to me  
I didnt know if I was alive or dead  
As the others all joined in with me  
  
By luck then a skirmish started  
And took the attention away from me  
When they took their gaze from me  
Was the moment that I fled  
  
I ran like hell faster than the wind  
But behind I did not glance  
One thing that I did not dare  
Was to look just straight ahead  
  
When you know that your time has come around  
You know youll be prepared for it  
Say your last goodbyes to everyone  
Drink and say a prayer for it  
  
When youre lying in your sleep when youre lying in your bed  
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead  
When youre lying in your sleep when youre lying in your bed  
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead  
  
To this day I guess Ill never know  
Just why they let me go  
But Ill never go dancing no more  
Til I dance with the dead
