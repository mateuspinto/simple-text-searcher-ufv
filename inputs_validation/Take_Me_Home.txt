Take that look of worry  
Im an ordinary man  
They dont tell me nothing  
So I find out what I can  
Theres a fire thats been burning  
Right outside my door  
I cant see but I feel it  
And it helps to keep me warm  
So I I dont mind  
No I I dont mind  
  
Seems so long Ive been waiting  
Still dont know what for  
Theres no point escaping  
I dont worry anymore  
I cant come out to find you  
I dont like to go outside  
They cant turn off my feelings  
Like theyre turning off a light  
But I I dont mind  
No I I dont mind  
Oh I I dont mind  
No I I dont mind  
  
So take take me home  
Cos I dont remember  
Take take me home  
Cause I dont remember  
Take take me home  
Cause I dont remember  
Take take me home oh lord  
Cause Ive been a prisoner all my life  
And I can say to you  
  
Take that look of worry mines an ordinary life  
Working when its daylight  
And sleeping when its night  
Ive got no far horizons  
I dont wish upon a star  
They dont think that I listen  
Oh but I know who they are  
And I I dont mind  
No I I dont mind  
Oh I I dont mind  
No I I dont mind  
  
So take take me home  
Cause I dont remember  
Take take me home  
Cause I dont remember  
Take take me home  
Cause I dont remember  
Take take me home oh lord  
Well Ive been a prisoner all my life  
And I can say to you  
  
But I dont remember  
Take take me home
