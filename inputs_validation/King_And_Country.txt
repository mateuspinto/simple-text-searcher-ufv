All the love of my mother I offer to you  
And Ill try so very hard  to get you through  
If lay down my life for my King and country men  
Would it change you for the better  
It better be all right  
To be always like children  
Afraid of the night  
  
If I gave up the cause  what would you give me  
to make up for all the things that I would lose  
If I lay down my life  for my King and country men  
Would it change you for the better  
It better be all right  
To be always like children  
Afraid of the night  
  
Well you better get busy  get it over and done  
I was here when you arrived  Ill be here when youre gone  
If I give up my life for my King and country men  
Would it change you for the better  
It better be all right  
To be never like people  
Afraid of the night  
  
Do do do  etc  fade out
