Nows all we got and time cant be bought  
I know it inside my heart forever will forever be ours  
Even if we try to forget love will remember  
  
You said you love me I said I loved you back  
What happened to that what happened to that  
All your promises and all them plans we had  
What happened to that what happened to that  
Boom gone yeah we move on even if we try to forget  
  
Love will remember you love will remember me  
I know it inside of my heart  
Forever will forever be ours even if we try to forget  
Love will remember love will remember  
Love will remember love will remember love will remember  
  
The trips we dreamed of taking the tacks left on the map  
What happened to that what happened to that  
When all you had was nothing and all we did was laugh  
What happened to that what happened what happened to that  
Boom gone yeah we move on even if we try to forget  
  
Love will remember you love will remember me  
I know it inside of my heart  
Forever will forever be ours even if we try to forget  
Love will remember love will remember  
Love will remember love will remember love will remember  
  
Break down the walls let heaven in somewhere and forever well dance again  
We used to be inseparable I used to think that I was irreplaceable  
We lit the whole world up before we blew it up  
I still dont know just how we screwed it up  
Forever forever forever  
  
Love will remember you love will remember me  
I know it inside of my heart  
Forever will forever be ours even if we try to forget  
Love will remember love will remember  
Love will remember love will remember love will remember  
Love will remember love will remember love will remember lovell remember
