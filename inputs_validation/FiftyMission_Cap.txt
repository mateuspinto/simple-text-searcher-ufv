Bill Barilko disappeared that summer  
He was on a fishing trip  
The last goal he ever scored  
Won the Leafs the cup  
They didnt win another until 1962  
The year he was discovered  
I stole this from a hockey card  
I keep tucked up under  
My fifty mission cap I worked it in  
To look like that  
  
Bill Barilko disappeared that summer in 1950  
He was on a fishing tripin a plane  
The last goal he ever scored in overtime  
Won the Leafs the cup  
They didnt win another until 1962  
The year he was discovered  
I stole this from a hockey card  
I keep tucked up under  
My fifty mission cap I worked it in  
To look like that
