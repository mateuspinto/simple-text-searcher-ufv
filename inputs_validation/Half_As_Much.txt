If you love me half as much as I love you  
You wouldnt worry me half as much as you do  
Youre nice to me when theres no one else around  
You only build me up to let me down  
  
If you missed me half as much as I miss you  
You wouldnt stay away half as much as you do  
I know that I would never feel so blue  
If you only loved me half as much as I love you  
  
If you love me half as much as I love you  
You wouldnt worry me half as much as you do  
Youre nice to me when theres no one else around  
You only build me up to let me down  
  
If you missed me half as much as I miss you  
You wouldnt stay away half as much as you do  
I know that I would never feel so blue  
If you only loved me half as much as I love you
