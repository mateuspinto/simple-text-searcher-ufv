Ya yeh ya heyey ya oh woh woh woh woh ah ah ah ahh  
Say goodbye to all of your friends  
And the people we knew  
Its better that it comes from you  
Tell them what you want  
Cause I tried so hard to make you happy  
No big star dreams no things that seem  
To make up your life  
So Im going back to new york city  
Where people live  
  
In my reality  
All of my life  
Yours was no good for me  
Need to feel the beat  
Of the street in my life  
In my reality  
Back to my life  
Yours was no good for me  
Three thousand miles away  
And everydays a new day  
  
All those dreams that pulled us apart  
And the things that you want  
Theyll never be enough for you  
So Ill say goodbye  
And Im going back to new york city  
Where people live  
  
In my reality  
Back to my life  
Yours was no good for me  
Need to feel the beat  
Of the street  
In my life  
Back to my old address  
Nobody to impress
