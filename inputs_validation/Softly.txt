Softly she comes  
Whispers the breeze with her passing  
In secret love she is laughing  
Softly she comes in the night  
  
Softly she sighs  
Sweetly she lies never sleeping  
Her fragrance all in my keeping  
Softly she comes in the night  
  
Down the darkened hall  
I hear her footsteps on my stair  
And she is in my arms once more  
  
Then softly she goes  
Her shining lips in the shadows  
Whisper goodbye at my window  
Softly she goes in the dawn  
  
Down the darkened hall  
I hear her footsteps on my stair  
And she is in my arms once more  
  
Then softly she goes  
Her shining lips in the shadows  
Whisper goodbye at my window  
Softly she goes in the dawn  
Softly she goes in the dawn
