O little town of Bethlehem  
How still we see thee lie  
Above the deep and dreamless sleep  
The silent stars go by  
Yet in the dark streets shineth  
The everlasting light  
The hopes and fears of all the years  
Are met in thee tonight  
How silently how silently  
The wondrous gift is given  
So God imparts to human hearts  
The blessings of His heaven  
We hear the Christmas angels  
The great glad tidings tell  
O come to us abide with us  
The Lord Emmanuel  
No ear may hear His coming  
But in this world of sin  
Where meek souls will receive Him still  
The dear Christ enters in
