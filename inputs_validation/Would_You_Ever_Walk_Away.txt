From this moment I will follow you  
To the borders of my country  
Will you make those promises come true  
Will you always want to hold me  
  
CHORUS  
Would you ever walk away from love  
Will your lips speak what is true  
If you say that this is where you belong  
Thats all I want from you  
  
In the garden of my deepest soul  
Is the seed to bring the future  
Its the story that is young and old  
And the student is the teacher  
  
REPEAT CHORUS  
  
Wind and rain can never change what is to be  
Lightning strikes across my heart so suddenly  
  
REPEAT CHORUS
