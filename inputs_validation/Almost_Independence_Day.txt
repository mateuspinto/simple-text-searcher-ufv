I can hear them calling way from Oregon  
I can hear them calling way from Oregon  
And its almost Independence Day  
  
Me and my lady we go steppin we go steppin  
We go steppin way out on China town  
All to buy some Hong Kong silver  
And the wadin rushing river we go steppin  
We go out on the out on the town tonight  
  
I can hear the fireworks  
I can hear the fireworks  
I can hear the fireworks  
Up and down the up and down the San Francisco bay  
Up and down the up and down the San Francisco bay  
I can hear them echoing  
I can hear I can hear them echoing  
Up and down the up and down the San Francisco bay  
  
I can see the boats in the harbor way across the harbor  
Lights shining out lights shining out  
And a cool cool night  
And a cool cool night across the harbor  
I can hear the fireworks  
I can hear the people people shouting out  
I can hear the people shouting out up and down the line  
And its almost Independence Day  
  
I can see the lights way out in the harbor  
And the cool and the cool and the cool night  
And the cool and the cool and the cool night breeze  
And I feel the cool night breeze  
And I feel feel feel the cool night breeze  
And the boats go by  
And its almost Independence Day  
And its almost and its almost Independence Day  
  
Way up and down the line  
Way up and down the line
