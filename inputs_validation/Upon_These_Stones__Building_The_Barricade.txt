Enjolras is addressing the revolutionaries  
  
Enjolras  
Here upon these stones  
We will build our barricade  
In the heart of the city  
We claim as our own  
Each man to his duty  
And dont be afraid  
Wait I will need a report  
On the strength of the foe  
  
Javert disguised as a rebel  
I can find out the truth  
I know their ways  
Fought their wars  
Served my time  
In the days  
Of my youth  
  
Various Students  
Now the people will fight  
And so they might  
Dogs will back  
Fleas will bite  
They will do what is right  
  
Marius spots Eponine who is dressed as a boy  
  
Marius  
Hey little boy whats this I see  
God Eponine the things you do  
  
Eponine  
I know this is no place for me  
Still I would rather be with you  
  
Marius  
Get out before the trouble starts  
Get out Ponine you might get shot  
  
Eponine  
I got you worried now I have  
That shows you like me quite a lot  
  
Marius  
There is a way that you can help  
You are the answer to a prayer  
Please take this letter to Cosette  
And pray to God that shes still there  
  
She walks to the Rue Plumet  
  
Eponine  
Little you know  
Little you care  
  
 Where she meets Valjean  
  
I have a letter Msieur  
Its addressed to your daughter Cosette  
Its from a boy at the barricade Sir  
In the Rue de Villette  
  
Valjean  
Give me that letter here my boy  
  
Eponine  
He said to give it to Cosette  
  
Valjean  
You have my word that my daughter will know  
What this letter contains  
  
He gives her a coin  
  
Tell the young man she will read it tomorrow  
And heres for your pains  
Go careful now stay out of sight  
Theres danger in the streets tonight  
  
He opens the letter And reads it  
  
Dearest Cosette you have entered my soul  
And soon you will be gone  
Can it be only a day since we met  
And the world was reborn  
If I should fall in the battle to come  
Let this be my goodbye  
Now that I know you love me as well  
It is harder to die  
I pray that god will bring me home  
To be with you  
Pray for your Marius he prays for you   
  
Valjean goes in leaving Eponine alone
