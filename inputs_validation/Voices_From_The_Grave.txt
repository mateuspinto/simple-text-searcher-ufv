Mesmerizing sounds I hear telling me to kill  
Telling me submit to the power  
Demonic overtones I fear stealing my freewill  
I am now the man of the hour  
Controlling all my thoughts now I dont know  
Right from wrong there is no hope for escape  
Stung by wicked words as the silence  
Speaks to me there is no hope for escape  
CHORUS  
Voices from the grave  
Telling me to sin  
My soul is what they crave  
Killing me within  
Disembodied spirits near pervading through my soul  
Getting harder to live in this Hell  
Angry voices loud and clear now they take control  
Now they leave me just an empty shell  
Controlling all my thoughts now I dont know  
Right from wrong there is no hope for escape  
Stung by wicked words as the silence  
Speaks to me there is no hope for escape  
CHORUS  
Voices from the grave  
Telling me to sin  
My soul is what they crave  
Killing me within  
LEAD  
Nothing to do but heed to their world  
And live to their every command  
All of my thoughts are sacrificial  
And used for their violent plans  
Mustering strength to fight the attack  
Released from a hypnotic state  
I drop to my knees and pray to the Lord  
To save me from my evil fate  
Screaming in pain Im thrown to the floor  
And grabbed by their arms of control  
The powers of evil the powers of good  
Are fighting for my weakened soul  
LEAD  
A winner emerges darkness prevails  
No futures in sight for me  
Cant take the pain darkness delivers  
Dying will set me free  
Clenching the gun sweating in fear  
Knowing the end is surely near  
Pulling the trigger launching death  
Evil inside me gasping breath  
Lifeless pile dead and gone  
Evil around me still lives on  
Lesson in life the road is paved  
Follow God and youll be saved  
Beware of voices from the grave
