It was too cold to stay in the north  
And LA seemed the most likely place I could be  
Those Malibu nights  
And those Hollywood lights were blinding me  
I longed for a lover to help me discover  
The key that would unlock loves door  
While diving the reefs  
Lord she changed my beliefs  
As we made love on the oceans floor  
And she whispered divers do it deeper  
Jockeys do it shorter  
Brick layers always make it  
Just a little bit stronger  
Sailors do it wetter  
Soldiers do it better  
But cowboys stay in the saddle  
Just a little bit longer  
  
I moved from LA for a good job with pay  
Riding range for the Double Bar Jay  
Till the rodeo came out I put in my name  
For the bull riding contest that day  
The judges were watching  
But they never noticed the girl  
Standing close to my chute  
Shed picked me to win  
I could tell by her grin  
As she reached out and platted my boot  
And she said divers do it deeper  
Pilots do it higher  
Bricklayers always make it  
Just a little bit stronger  
Doctors do it cleaner  
Bikers do it meaner  
Cowboys stay in the saddle  
Just a little bit longer  
Divers do it deeper
