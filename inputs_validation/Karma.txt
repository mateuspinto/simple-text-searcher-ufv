And as they say grief is only able to possess  
The rotting body clad in ancient clothes  
Is left behind with a wave of the hand  
I have gone away The bed is cold and empty  
  
Trees bend their boughs toward the earth  
And nighttime birds float as black faces  
It was the hand reaching out through the mirror  
Unknown and scarred by life  
  
The luring eyes you had never seen  
You have nothing more to find  
You have nothing more to loose  
The cold season drifts over the land  
  
They huddle in the brown corners  
Some would settle for less  
The castles were all empty asleep  
Long awaiting their king  
  
Beckoning round the bend  
Amidst the forest one would hear that I had been there  
Draped within a fate I could not change  
And always welcoming Winters EPILOGUE
