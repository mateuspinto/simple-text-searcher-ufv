Marlena under Foster Grants  
Shes undercover from the dawns advance  
That girl is traveldrained  
And the neon mercury vapor stained  
Miami sky  
Its red as meat  
Its a cheap pink rose  
Otis in the drivers seat  
Watches the street lights fade away  
On louvered blocks in green sea air  
In fluorescent fossil yards  
Slippers are shuffling into folding chairs  
Freckled hands are shuffling cards  
  
Theyve come for fun and sun  
While Muslims stick up Washington  
  
Otis empties out the trunk  
On the steps of that celebrated dump  
Sleazing by the sea  
Bow down to her royal travesty  
In her ballrooms heads of state  
In her bedrooms rented girls  
Always the grand parades of cellulite  
Jiggling to her golden pools  
Through flock and cupid colonnades  
They jiggle into surgery  
Hopefully beneath the blade  
They dream of golden beauty  
  
Theyve come for fun and sun  
While Muslims stick up Washington  
  
Marlena white as stretcher sheet  
Watches it all from her 10th floor balcony  
Like its her opera box  
All those Pagliacci summer frocks  
Otis is fiddling with the TV dial  
All he gets are cartoons and reruns  
She taps her glass with an emery file  
Watching three rings in the sun  
The golden dive the fatted flake  
And sizzle in the mink oil  
Its all a dream  
She has awake  
Checked into Miami Royal  
Where theyve come for fun and sun  
While Muslims hold up Washington  
Dream on  
Dream on  
Dream on  
Dream on  
Dream on
