Hey girl if you want me  
Come an get me  
Dont hang around  
Or we could spend the night sleeping alone  
  
If you could change your style for a while  
An look in my direction  
Tell me do I look the kind of guy  
Who takes advantage of a women like you  
  
Would I lie to you would I lie to you  
I would do anything that you want me too  
But would I lie to you  
Would I lie to you would I lie to you  
Baby I would do anything that you want me too  
But would I lie to would I lie to would I lie to you  
  
Hey girl if you need  
Some love an affection  
Ill whisper all the sweet sweet nothings  
I know you little girls like to hear  
If you would change your mind  
We could find a night of satin sheet action  
I promise I wont do anything  
Baby unless you wanted me to  
  
Would I lie to you would I lie to you  
I would do anything that you want me too  
But would I lie to you  
Would I lie to you would I lie to you  
I would do anything that you want me too  
But would I lie to would I lie to should I lie to you  
  
I dont want to sleep alone tonight  
After all you put me through  
Ive spent the whole night searching  
For a woman just like you  
Look in my eyes tell you lies  
Then baby its just because I want you to stay  
  
Would I lie to you would I lie to you  
I would do anything that you want me too  
But would I lie to you  
Would I lie to you would I lie to you  
Baby I would do anything that you want me too  
But would I lie to would I lie to would I lie to you
