Girls were made to take care of boys  
To be kind and dutiful  
Hmm  
Girls were made to take care of boys  
Made to share their sorrows  
Made to share their joys  
Made to help and guide them  
With ever a patient hand  
  
Made to give affection  
In the right direction  
Always understand  
  
Now boys may think they take care of girls  
Just because they pass on their fashions and their curls  
But Ive always found  
Its just the other way around  
Other way around  
  
If you need the girl  
And declare you do  
Tell her that you need her  
Shell be there  
To take care of you  
Shell be there  
Now boys may think they take care of girls  
Just because theyre clever with their fashions and their curls  
But Ive always found  
Its just the other way around
