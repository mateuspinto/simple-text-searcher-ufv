We gonna have a soul shakedown party tonight  
  
The way you love me  
Its all right  
When you put your lovin arms around me  
And you hold me tight  
hold me tight  
  
This is my invitation  
Ive got the special vacation  
I need your concentration  
Just to feel your vibration  
  
At that soul shakedown party tonight  
We gonna have a soul shakedown party tonight  
  
Jane is in the backyard  
Doing the outside dance  
  
From telling me the other day  
She didnt even get a chance  
  
But this is my invitation  
Ive got the special vacation  
I need your concentration  
Just to feel your vibration  
  
Baby I need you tonight  
We gonna have a soul shakedown party tonight  
  
The way you love me  
Its all right  
When you put your lovin arms around me  
And you hold me tight  
Hold me tight  
This is my invitation  
Ive got the special vacation  
I need your concentration  
Just to feel your vibration  
  
At that soul shakedown party tonight  
We gonna have a soul shakedown party tonight
