Verse 1  
I could write a song by my new piano  
I could sing about how love is a losing battle  
Not hard Its not hard  
Its not hard Its not hard  
Its not hard Its not hard  
Its not hard Its not hard  
  
And I could sing about cupid and a shooting arrow  
In the end you found out that my heart was better  
Real hard Real hard  
Its so hard So hard  
Real hard Real hard  
Its that hard Its that hard  
  
PreChorus  
But Id rather make a song they can play on the radio  
That it makes you wanna dance  
Dont it make you wanna dance  
But Id rather make a song they can play on the radio  
Makes you wanna grab your lovers hand

So hold up and  
Take it through the night  
And you should follow through  
To make it alright  
Now grab each others hands get em all  
I want to see you rock to the piano  
The Piano
