I can see that look that says beware  
Try to move in closer if you dare  
So I must sit and play  
My waiting game  
And for a while I know  
Shell do the same  
Fly away  
  
Watches like an eagle from its eyrie  
And like a bird of prey  
She captures me  
But I am older and  
More wise than you  
Bird of prey  
Straight into me you flew  
Fly away  
  
Now every time I tried to set her free  
Im glad to say she comes  
Right back to me  
But if I knew she didnt want to stay  
I wouldnt try to keep that  
Lovely bird of prey
