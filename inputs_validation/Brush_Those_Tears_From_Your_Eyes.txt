Brush those tears from your eyes  
And try to realize  
That the ache in my heart is for you  
  
Brush those tears from your eyes  
And try to realize  
That from now on Ill always be true  
  
I went away  
But I didnt mean to stay  
And I will regret it  
Until my dying day  
  
Brush those tears from your eyes  
And try to realize  
That the ache in my heart is for you  
  
Brush those tears from your eyes  
And try to realize  
That the ache in my heart is for you  
  
Brush those tears from your eyes  
And try to realize  
That from now on Ill always be true  
  
I went away  
But I didnt mean to stay  
And I will regret it  
Until my dying day  
  
Brush those tears from your eyes  
And try to realize  
That the ache in my heart is for you  
That the ache in my heart is for you
