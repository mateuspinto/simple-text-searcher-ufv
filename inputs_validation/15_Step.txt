How come I end up where I started  
How come I end up where I belong  
Wont take my eyes off the ball again  
You reel me out then you cut the string  
  
How come I end up where I started  
How come I end up where I belong  
Wont take my eyes off the ball again  
You reel me out then you cut the string  
  
You used to be alright  
What happened  
Did the cat get your tongue  
Did your string come undone  
One by one  
One by one  
It comes to us all  
Its as soft as your pillow  
  
You used to be alright  
What happened  
Etcetera etcetera  
Facts for whatever  
Fifteen steps  
Then a shear drop
