I see prople piling up on people  
I see brothers ripping of their friends  
I see lovers cheating on their lovers  
the story never ends  
  
I hear babies making it with babies  
I hear buddies lying to their friends  
Politicians lie for politicians  
This party never ends  
  
People help me sing my song  
Better days is going wrong  
Everybody get in touch with me  
Put it back to where we belong  
Push the weak to make the stronng  
Everybody get in touch with me  
  
I see people piling up on people  
I see junnkies taking from their friends  
I see fingers pointing at the fingers  
The story never ends  
  
We got misters beating up on sisters  
We got crazies waiting for the end  
We got answers giving out the answers  
This party never ends
