Looking for a lady  
Im looking for a lady  
To change my night to day  
  
Looking for a lady  
Im looking for a lady  
To chase my blues away  
  
Well I have a few in mind  
But none in particular  
I have had them before  
But nothing that was for sure  
  
And Im in no position to barter  
And Im in no condition to play the martyr  
And Im sadder certainly  
But Im smarter  
And I find myself  
  
Looking for a lady  
Im looking for a lady  
To share my empty bed  
Looking for a lady  
Im looking for a lady  
To soothe my aching head  
  
Well I have a few in mind  
But none in particular  
I have had them before  
But nothing that was for sure  
  
And my feelings have grown  
Rigid like a wooden post  
And my love is like a curtain  
That has been drawn closed  
And my life just isnt going  
The way I thought it was supposed to  
And Im crying and I find myself  
  
Looking for a lady  
Im looking for a lady  
To change my night to day
