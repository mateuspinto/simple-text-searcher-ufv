Take me down to the river bend  
Take me down to the fighting end  
Wash the poison from off my skin  
Show me how to be whole again  
  
Fly me up on a silver wing  
Past the black where the sirens sing  
Warm me up in a novas glow  
And drop me down to the dream below  
  
Cause Im only a crack in this castle of glass  
Hardly anything there for you to see  
For you to see  
  
Bring me home in blinding dream  
Through the secrets that I have seen  
Wash the sorrow from off my skin  
And show me how to be whole again  
  
Cause Im only a crack in this castle of glass  
Hardly anything there for you to see  
For you to see  
For you to see  
  
Cause Im only a crack in this castle of glass  
Hardly anything else I need to be  
  
Cause Im only a crack in this castle of glass  
Hardly anything there for you to see  
For you to see  
For you to see  
For you to see
