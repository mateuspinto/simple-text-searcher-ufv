Take this silver lining  
Keep it in your own  
Sweet head  
And shine it when the night is  
Burning red  
Shine it in the twilight  
Shine it on the cold cold ground  
Shine it till these walls  
Come tumbling down  
  
We were born with our eyes wide open  
So alive with wild hope now  
Can you tell me why  
Time after time they drag you down  
Down in the darkest deep  
Fools and their madness all around  
Know that the light dont sleep  
  
Step into the silence  
Take it in your own  
Two hands  
And sprinkle it like diamonds  
All across these lands  
Blaze it in the morning  
Wear it like an iron skin  
Only things worth living for are  
Innocence and magic amen  
  
We were born with our eyes wide open  
So alive with wild hope now  
Can you tell me why  
Time after time they drag you down  
Down in the darkest deep  
Fools and their madness all around  
Know that the light dont sleep  
  
Whoa whoa  
  
We were born with our eyes wide open  
So alive with wild hope now  
Can you tell me why  
Time after time they drag you down  
Down in the talk so cheap  
Fools and their madness all around  
Know that the light dont sleep  
Know that the light dont sleep  
  
Time after time  
They drag you down  
Down in the darkness deep  
Fools in their madness all around  
Know that the light dont sleep  
Know that the light dont sleep
