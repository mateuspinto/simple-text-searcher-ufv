I found a little beetle so that beetle was his name  
And I called him Alexander and he answered just the same  
I put him in a matchbox and I kept him all the day  
And Nanny let my beetle out  
Yes Nanny let my beetle out  
She went and let my beetle out  
And beetle ran away  
  
She said she didnt mean it and I never sauid she did  
She said she wanted matches and she just took off the lid  
She said that she was sorry but its difficult to catch  
An excited sort of beetle youve mistaken for a match  
  
She said that she was sorry and I really mustnt mind  
As theres lots and lots of beetles which shes certain we could find  
If we looked about the garden for the holes where beetles hid  
And wed get another matchbox and write beetle on the lid  
  
We went to all the places which a beetle might be near  
And we made the sort of noises which a beetle likes to hear  
And I saw a kind of something and I gave a sort of shout  
A beetlehouse and Alexander Beetle coming out  
  
It was Alexander Beetle Im as certain as can be  
And he had a sort of look as if he thought it might be me  
And he had a kind of look as if he thought he ought to say  
Im very very sorry that I tried to run away  
  
And Nannys very sorry too for you know what she did  
And shes writing alexander very blackly on the lid  
So Nan and me are friends because its difficult to catch  
An excited Alexander youve mistaken for a match
