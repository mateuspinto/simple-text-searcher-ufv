Its been a long day without you my friend  
And Ill tell you all about it when I see you again  
Weve come a long way from where we began  
Oh Ill tell you all about it when I see you again  
When I see you again  
  
Damn who knew all the planes we flew  
Good things weve been through  
That Ill be standing right here  
Talking to you about another path I  
Know we loved to hit the road and laugh  
But something told me that it wouldnt last  
Had to switch up look at things different see the bigger picture  
Those were the days hard work forever pays now I see you in a better place  
  
How could we not talk about family when familys all that we got  
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side  
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride  
  
Its been a long day without you my friend  
And Ill tell you all about it when I see you again  
Weve come a long way from where we began  
Oh Ill tell you all about it when I see you again

First you both go out your way  
And the vibe is feeling strong and whats  
Small turn to a friendship a friendship  
Turn into a bond and that bond will never  
Be broken and the love will never get lost  
And when brotherhood come first then the line  
Will never be crossed established it on our own  
When that line had to be drawn and that line is what  
We reach so remember me when Im gone  
  
How could we not talk about family when familys all that we got  
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side  
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride

As you go and every road you take will always lead you home
