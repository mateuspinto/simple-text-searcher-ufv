Eight years of peace and prosperity  
Scandal in the White House  
An election is what we need  
From coasttocoast to Washington  
  
So America voted on a president  
No one kept count  
On how the election went  
From Florida to Washington  
  
Goddamn said one side  
And the other said the same  
Both looked pretty guilty  
But no one took the blame  
From coasttocoast to Washington  
  
So a new man in the White House  
With a familiar name  
Said he had some fresh ideas  
But its worse now since he came  
From Texas to Washington  
  
And he wants to fight with many  
And he says its not for oil  
He sent out the National Guard  
To police the world  
From Baghdad to Washington  
  
What is the thought process  
To take a humans life  
What would be the reason  
To think that this is right  
From Heaven to Washington  
From Jesus Christ to Washington
