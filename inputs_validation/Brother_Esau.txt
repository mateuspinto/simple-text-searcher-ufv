My brother Esau killed the hunter back in 1969  
Before the killing was done his inheritance was mine  
When at first my brother walked away  
Before a weary band  
Esau gave his sleeplessness for a piece of moral land  
Our father favored Esau he was eager to obey  
All the wild commandments the old man shot his way  
But all this ended when my brother failed at war  
He staggered home and found me in the door  
Esau hes on rollerskates today  
And he make a statement to someone in L A  
Sometimes at night I dream hes still that hairy man  
Shadow boxing the apocalypse wandering the land  
Esau holds the blessing brother Esau holds the curse  
I was thinking that the blame was mine  
But suspected something worse  
The more my brother looks like me the more I understand  
The silent war it bloodied both our hands  
None of us can win  
Outside that dream still that hairy man  
Well sometimes at night I think I understand  
Shadowboxing the apocalypse wandering the land
