Born in the window  
Cold blooded spoof  
Raised in the prison  
You called the school  
Taught young in legends  
Told what to do  
I handed my childhood  
Over to you  
  
Travelling endlessly Im searching for mind  
Im almost afraid of what I will find  
Wandering aimlessly oh what can I do  
I handed my future over to you to you  
  
Over to you  
Future looks blue  
What can I do  
  
Watching for freedom  
Fighting our wars  
Feeding our children  
Keeping your laws  
Someday youll suffer  
And what Ill do  
Ill hand all your promises  
Over to you  
  
Standing inside myself Im losing control  
You made me believe in the stories you told  
Waiting impatiently what else can I do  
I handed my future over to you to you  
  
Over to you  
Future looks blue  
What can I do  
  
Tears filled of sadness  
Stealing myself  
Which burning secrets  
What to they tell  
Mad politicians  
Can tell it true  
I handed my children  
Over to you  
  
All over over to you  
All over over to you  
All over over to you
