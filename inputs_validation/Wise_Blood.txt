Im an outcast that no one can save anymore  
And the days of my youth have all long gone by now  
I was the kind of boy the devil would offer a smoke or a drink to  
Or a ride downtown to some God forsaken land  
  
One Sunday morning at dawn you know they baptized my soul  
But they held me down so long Christ I almost drowned  
Yeah I was the kind of boy who never learned to smile  
So I kicked and I screamed  
till I tore myself lose from all these great big hands Oh Yeah  
  
Chorus  
Wiseblood knows how to walk the way the wind blows  
Wiseblood hears grace whisper right behind  
  
My mommma she turned around and said  
Little boy you better wake upcause your a walking dead  
Oh she was the kind a girl who never touched a smoke or a drink  
She just smoldered like an empty church left to burn in the wind
