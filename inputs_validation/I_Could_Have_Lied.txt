There must be something  
In the way I feel  
That she dont want me to feel  
The stare she bares cut me  
I dont care  
You see so what if I bleed  
  
I could never change  
Just what I feel  
My face will never show  
What is not real  
  
A mountain never seems to have  
The need to speak  
A look that shares so many seek  
The sweetest feeling  
I got from you  
The things I said to you were true  
  
I could never change  
Just what I feel  
My face will never show  
What is not real  
  
I could have lied Im such a fool  
My eyes could never never never  
Keep their cool  
Showed her and I told her how  
She struck me but Im fucked up now  
  
But now shes gone yes shes gone away  
A soulful song  
That would not stay  
You see she hides cause she is scared  
But I dont care  
I wont be spared  
  
I could have lied Im such a fool  
My eyes could never never never  
Keep their cool  
Showed her and I told her how  
She struck me but Im fucked up now  
  
I could have lied Im such a fool  
My eyes could never never never  
Keep their cool  
Showed her and I told her how  
She struck me but Im fucked up now
