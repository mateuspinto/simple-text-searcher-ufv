Pink Floyd cover  
  
Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young  
In a world of magnets and miracles  
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary  
The ringing of the division bell had begun  
  
Along the Long Road and on down to the causeway  
Do they still meet there by the Cut  
  
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps  
Running before time took our dreams away  
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground  
To a life consumed by slow decay  
  
The grass was greener  
The light was brighter  
With friends surrounding  
The nights of wonder  
  
Looking beyond the embers of the bridges glowing behind us  
To a glimpse at our great lose of the other side  
Steps taken forward but sleepwalking back again  
Dragged by force of some inner tide  
  
But the highest altitude with flag unfurled  
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world  
  
Encumbered forever by desire and ambition  
Theres hunger still unsatisfied  
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon  
Though down this road weve been so many times  
  
The grass was greener  
The light was brighter  
The taste was sweeter  
The nights of wonder  
With friends surrounded  
The dark mist growing  
The water flowing  
The endless river  
Forever and ever x2
