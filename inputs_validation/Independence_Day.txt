One electrified eye  
Freezing metalized smile  
No more cheating the code  
The scene is set  emotions disconnected  
  
Welcome to the cyber trail  
Laser cops and sirens wail  
Held down with magnetic force  
Said come with us  you broke the law  
  
Obey the rules  dont do no wrong  
A thought too loud  and crime is done  
No appeal for the common man  
Just cold hard facts  in computer land  
  
All freedom burns on eternal fire  
Theres no more independence day  
Forever gone never have another  
No other independence day  
  
Cyborg arms put the straps around  
One more second till the switch comes down  
Flaching lights  a cage of steel  
Turns my head into a dead dogs meal  
  
In this world  robotic rage  
Youll understand the acid pain  
Do no right  you wont last long  
Remote controlled  under the heel of submission  
  
All freedom burns on eternal fire  
Theres no more independence day  
Forever gone never have another  
No other independence day  
  
No remorse  for human kind  
No recourse  to keep your mind  
Its too late  theres no escape  
Is this the end of the line  
  
All freedom burns on eternal fire  
Theres no more independence day  
Forever gone never have another  
No other independence day  
  
All freedom burns on eternal fire  
Theres no more independence day  
Forever gone never have another  
No other independence day  
  
No use for humanity  
Well never ever be free again  
No tomorrows  
Zero  the number of the year  
Zero  the number of the year
