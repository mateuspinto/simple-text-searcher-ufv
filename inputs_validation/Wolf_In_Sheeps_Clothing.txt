Youve got your reputation  
Ive got anonymity  
Ive got my selfrespect  
You cant take that from me  
  
Youve got to protect your interests  
Youve got your enemies  
Ive got a hundred reasons  
To expose your treachery  
  
There is no happy ending  
Only what remains to be  
  
I want an explanation  
I want an apology  
You ruined everything  
You tried to run away but you cant  
I want to hear the answer  
I want the opportunity  
You wasted so much time  
You tried to run away but you cant  
  
You had your way of speaking  
I was full of naivete  
We had a common interest  
And a trust based on a need  
Ive got my own ideas  
Ive got my integrity  
Youve got your binding contracts  
Youve got your misery  
  
Your power and position  
Your hunger and your greed  
Walk on the backs of others  
Toward the goals you will achieve
