Knowing love the way I do  
I can say for certain that its true  
Theres a chance for me and you  
I surely feel like the time is near  
The picture in my mind is very clear  
I think love has brought us here  
  
I remember not too long ago  
I was just a lonely person with a lonely heart  
And I was hopin there could one day be  
Be a chance for me to  
  
Get the love that Id been missin  
Sometimes love takes a long time  
Wait for love and youre gonna get the chance to love  
Wait for love wait for love oh my  
  
When you take the chance on love you see  
Its not a waste of time if you truly believe  
The impossible can be  
So hold on tight if you think youre right  
Cause nothing hurts as bad as when you see  
You gave up too easily  
  
I remember spending all my time  
On a dream that kept me wishing that you could be mine  
And I was hopin there could one day be  
A chance for me to  
  
I never stopped believing there could one day be  
Be a chance for me to
