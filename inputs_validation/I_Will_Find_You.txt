Hope is your survival  
A captive path I lead  
  
No matter where you go  
I will find you  
If it takes a long long time  
No matter where you go  
I will find you  
If it takes a thousand years  
  
Nachgochema  
Anetaha  
Anachemowagan  
  
No matter where you go  
I will find you  
In the place with no frontiers  
No matter where you go  
I will find you  
If it takes a thousand years  
  
Hale w yu ga I sv  
Do na dio sv I  
Wi ja lo sv  
Ha le w yu

No matter where you go  
I will find you  
If it takes a long long time  
No matter where you go  
I will find you  
If it takes a thousand years  
  
No matter where you go  
I will find you  
In the place with no frontiers  
No matter where you go  
I will find you  
If it takes a thousand years  
  
No matter where you go  
I will find you
