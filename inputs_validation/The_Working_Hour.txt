These things  
That Ive  
Been told  
Can rearrange  
My world  
My doubt  
In time  
But inside out  
This is the working hour  
We are paid by those who learn by our mistake  
This day  
And age  
For all  
And not for one  
All lies  
And secrets  
Put on  
Put on and on  
This is the working hour  
We are paid by those who learn by our mistake  
And fear is such a vicious thing  
It wraps me up in chains  
Find out  
Find out  
What this fear is about  
Find out  
Find out  
What this fear is about
