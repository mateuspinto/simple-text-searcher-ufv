My promise could be your theme  
A given end to your dreams  
A simple movement or rhyme  
Could be the smallest of signs  
Well never know what they are or care  
An empty statement or view  
Theres no escape so few in fear  
Give in a changing value  
  
To be given your sight  
Hid in a long peaceful night  
A nervous bride for your eyes  
A fractured smile that soon dies  
A love thats wrong from your life and soul  
A savage mine had begun  
Hello farewell to your love and soul  
Hello farewell to your soul  
  
Now I know what those hands would do  
No looking back now were pushing through  
Well change these feelings well taste and see  
But never guess how the him would scream  
But never guess how the him would scream  
But never guess how the him would scream
