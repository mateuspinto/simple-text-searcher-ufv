Hold on to your love  
Hold on to your love  
Though you may feel tired and blue  
The things you say  
The things you dream you might do  
Come true if you  
Hold on to your love  
  
How long the day  
How dark the night spent apart  
Is this the way to learn  
Go your own way  
Although you may break a heart  
Dont let it start  
Hold on to your love  
  
Hold on to your love  
Hold on to your love  
  
The things you say  
The things you dream you might do  
If only you hold on to your love  
Hold on to your love
