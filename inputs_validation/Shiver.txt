So I look in your direction  
But you pay no attention do you  
I know you dont listen to me  
Cause you say you see straight through me dont you  
but on and on  
from the moment I wake  
to the moment I sleep  
Ill be there by your side  
Just you try and stop me  
Ill waiting in line  
Just to see if you care  
  
Oh did you want me to change  
Well Id change for good  
And I want you to know  
That youll always get your way  
I wanted to say  
  
Dont you shiver  
You shiver  
Singing loud and clear  
Ill always be waiting for you  
  
So you know how much I need you  
But you never even see me do you  
And is this my final chance of getting you  
  
But on and on  
Did she want me to change  
Well Id change for good  
And I want you to know  
That youll always get your way  
I wanted to say  
  
Dont you shiver  
You shiver  
Singing loud and clear  
Ill always be waiting for you  
  
So you know how much I need you  
But you never even see me do you  
And is this my final chance of getting you  
  
But on and on  
from the moment I wake  
to the moment I sleep  
Ill be there by your side  
Just you try and stop me  
Ill be waiting in line  
Just to see if you care if you care  
Oh did you want me to change  
Well Id change for good  
and I want you to know  
That youll always get your way  
And I wanted to say  
  
Dont you shiver  
you shiver  
I sing it loud and clear  
That Ill always be waiting for you
