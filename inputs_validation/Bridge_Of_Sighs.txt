The sun dont shine  
The moon dont move the tides  
To wash me clean  
  
The sun dont shine  
The moon dont move the tides  
To wash me clean  
  
Why so unforgiving and why so cold  
Been a long time crossing  
The bridge of sighs  
  
Cold wind blows  
And the Gods look down in anger  
On this poor child  
  
Cold wind blows  
The Gods look down in anger  
On this poor child  
  
Why so unforgiving and why so cold  
Been a long time crossing  
Bridge of sighs
