Wintertime winds blow cold the season  
Fallen in love Im hopin to be  
Wind is so cold is that the reason  
Keeping you warm your hands touching me  
Come with me dance my dear  
Winters so cold this year  
You are so warm  
My wintertime love to be  
Winter time winds blue and freezin  
Comin from northern storms in the sea  
Love has been lost is that the reason  
Trying so desperately to be free  
Come with me dance my dear  
Winters so cold this year  
And you are so warm  
My wintertime love to be  
La la la la  
Come with me dance my dear  
Winters so cold this year  
You are so warm  
My wintertime love to be
