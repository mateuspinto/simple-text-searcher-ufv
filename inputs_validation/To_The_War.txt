If the day would come to fight for what is right  
Would you go  
Would you guard the ground youve reaped from all your life  
Would you say yes  
Or would you say no  
And if the legacies of your land were on the line  
Would you pledge you allegiance if death be the fate you may find  
Look in your hearts  
Do you know  
To the war   
Does the freedom seek the strong or seek the weak  
Do you care  
Would you face the foe or turn your other cheek  
And bandon the hearts your children must share  
And if the sanctities of your creeds were terrorized  
Would you kneel down in dastardly grace  
Or would you stand up and fight  
Man would you march to war
