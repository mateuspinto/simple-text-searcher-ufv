When a dove is in love with a doll of a dove  
He is out all night coo cooing  
When the owls on a prowl or a feminine fowl  
He goes out all night woo wooing  
Every bird and bee has its lunacy  
In the way he works his dream off  
But when I feel high heres the way  
That I like to get my kind of steam off  
Owls hoo hoo others sigh  
Doves coo coo ah how I  
I could go on singing till the cows come home  
And the rooster starts to crow crow crow  
When I see your eyes I go all out  
I must vocalize till you shout Enough already  
I could go on singing till the moon turns pink  
Anything from Faust to Inkadinkadink  
Love does funny things  
When it hits you this way  
I could go on singing till the cows come home  
And the rooster starts to crow crow crow  
When I see your eyes I go all out  
I must vocalize till you shout Enough already  
I could go on singing till the moon turns pink  
Anything from Faust to Inkadinkadink  
Love does funny things  
When it hits you this way  
I must keep on singing like a lark going strong  
With my heart on the wings of a song singing day
