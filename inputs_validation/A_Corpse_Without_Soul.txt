Listen Im a corpse Im a corpse  
Im a corpse without soul  
Satan hes taken hes taken  
He taken his toll  
Listen Im a corpse Im a corpse  
Im a corpse without soul  
Satan hes taken hes taken  
Hes taken his toll  
I was walking down among the graves  
I heard a cry my shadow is gone  
Emptiness in my body life in the cold  
Small black wings on my naked back  
Now guess what I saw on one of those stones  
I saw my soul in a magical haze  
It was all dressed up as corpse in a wedding dress  
Small black wings on my naked back  
Now hear my prayer  
Begging for mercy  
Im just living to die  
Well I was walking down among the graves  
I heard a cry my shadow is gone  
Emptiness in my body life in the cold  
Small black wings on my naked back  
Now guess what I saw on one of those stones  
I saw my soul in a magical haze  
It was all dressed up as a corpse in a wedding dress  
Small black wings on my naked back  
Listen Im a corpse Im a corpse  
Im a corpse without soul  
Satan hes taken hes taken  
Hes taken his toll  
Listen Im a corpse Im a corpse  
Im a corpse without soul  
Satan hes taken hes taken  
Hes taken his toll
