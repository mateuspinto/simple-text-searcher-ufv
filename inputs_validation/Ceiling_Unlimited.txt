Its not the heat  
Its the inhumanity  
Plugged into the sweat of a summer street  
Machine gun images pass  
Like malice through the looking glass  
  
The slackjaw gaze  
Of true profanity  
Feels more like surrender than defeat  
If culture is the curse of the thinking class  
If culture is the curse of the thinking class  
  
Ceiling unlimited  
World so wide  
Turn and turn again  
  
Feeling unlimited  
Still unsatisfied  
Changes never end  
  
The vacant laugh  
Of true insanity  
Dressed up in the mask of Tragedy  
Programmed for the guts and glands  
Of idle minds and idle hands  
  
I rest my case   
Or at least my vanity  
Dressed up in the mask of Comedy  
If laughter is a straw for a drowning man  
If laughter is a straw for a drowning man  
  
Ceiling unlimited  
Windows open wide  
Look and look again  
  
Feeling unlimited  
Eyes on the prize  
Changes never end  
  
Winding like an ancient river  
The time is now again  
  
Hope is like an endless river  
The time is now again
