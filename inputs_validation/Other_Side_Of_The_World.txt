I had known you for quite sometime  
But the thought of love never crossed my mind  
It seemed to be on the other side of the world  
  
Too many times had I loved  
And not cared at all about love  
Just to have something to do  
Then I saw a different you  
And oh my  
  
Theres so many stories of love  
All with the wonders of love  
And so very sad I would be  
Cause none belonged to me  
Could be its all for the voice  
So I finally let it rest  
Sad but I thought that maybe  
Love wasnt meant for me  
  
There was love  
There was love  
There was love  
On the other  
Side of the world  
  
So much love  
So much love  
So much love  
On the other  
Side of the world  
  
I had known you for quite sometime  
And the thought of love never crossed my mind  
It seemed to be on the other side  
Of the world  
  
So crazy how things can change your life  
Now that love is you everything is right  
And lonliness is the other side  
Of the world  
  
Aint it crazy how things can change your life  
Now that love is you everything is right  
And lonliness is the other side  
Of the world  
  
So crazy how things can change your life  
Now that love is you everything is right  
And lonliness is the other side  
Of the world  
  
Aint it crazy how things can change your life  
Now that love is you everything is right  
And lonliness is the other side  
Of the world  
  
So crazy how things can change your life  
Now that love is you everything is right  
And lonliness is the other side  
Of the world  
Of the world  
Of the world
