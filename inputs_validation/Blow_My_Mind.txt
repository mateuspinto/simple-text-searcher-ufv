You got the mind like a child girl  
You got to fight like a woman  
Well I think youre so wild girl  
Like the sun in the morning  
Im gonna turn you on  
To where you belong  
Pull you tight  
Im gonna show you right  
You blow my mind  
Blow my mind  
Blow my mind  
Blow my mind  
Pull myself together  
Tell you who the boss is  
Now I feel like the weather  
You gotta do what the lord says  
You blow my mind  
Blow my mind  
Blow my mind  
Blow my mind  
Oh Pull yourself together  
Tell you who the boss is  
Well I feel like the weather  
You gotta do what the lord says  
You blow my mind hey blow my mind  
Blow my mind  
Blow my mind  
You got the mind like a child girl  
You got to fight like a woman  
I think youre so wild girl  
Like the sun in the morning  
Im gonna turn you on  
To where you belong  
Pull you tight  
Im gonna show you right  
You blow my mind you blow my mind  
Blow my mind  
Blow my mind
