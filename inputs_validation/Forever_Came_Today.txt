There you were standing there  
As your eyes reached out to me  
Something warm in your eyes  
Touched my heart right then and there  
All the love I never knew  
I found in you  
  
Suddenly my world stood still  
My life was then fulfilled  
As you gently touched my hand  
I knew that we had laid a plan  
For everlasting love  
That I been forever dreaming of  
  
At last ooh at last  
My forever came today  
When you walked into my life  
And made my lonely life a paradise  
It came today  
Forever came today  
  
Forever came today  
Forever came today  
  
As we were standing there  
You didnt speak a single word  
But your eyes  
Your eyes said you wanted me  
Your touch said you needed me  
And my heart said tenderly  
  
Darling ooh my darling  
Make me yours  
Let your kiss touch my face  
And tell me love has lead me  
To this place to your warm embrace  
And our happiness  
  
Thanks to you  
My search has ended  
And I want the world to see  
How gently love has shined on me  
With everlasting love  
That I been forever dreaming of  
  
At last ooh at last  
My forever came today  
When you walked into my life  
And made my lonely life a paradise  
It came today  
Forever came today  
Forever came today  
Forever came today  
  
At last ooh at last  
My forever came today  
When you walked into my life  
And made my lonely life a paradise  
Oh it came today  
Forever came today  
Forever came today  
Forever came today  
  
At last ooh at last  
My forever came today  
When you walked into my life
