Welcoming the virgins fair to live a noble life  
In the castle known to all  the Counts infernal wife  
She invites the peasants with endless lavish foods  
But when evening spreads it wings she rapes them of their blood  
Countess Bathory  
Countess Bathory  
All day long the virgins sit and feast on endless meals  
The Countess laughs and sips her wine  her skin doth crack and peel  
But when nightime fills the air one must pay the price  
The Countess takes her midnight bath with blood that once gave life  
Countess Bathory  
Countess Bathory  
Living in her self styled Hell the Countess dressed in black  
Lifes so distant  deaths so near  no blood to turn time back  
The castle walls are closing in shes crippled now with age  
Welcomes death with open arms  the reaper turns the page
