Oooh oooh oooh oooh  
What I feel inside me  
I never felt before  
My arms are shaking  
Whenever you walk through my door  
And through the night  
I feel so alive  
When you and I  
Are together side by side  
I wanna little love  
Give me love  
I wanna little love  
From you  
I wanna little love  
Give me love  
I wanna little love  
Deep inside you  
I need your lovin  
Makes my heart feel satisfied  
I feel on movin  
Everytime you walk me by  
The feel of love  
Just a bit of love  
I want from you  
And in fact the rest let me do  
I wanna little love  
Give me love  
I wanna little love  
From you  
I wanna little love  
Give me love  
I wanna little love  
Deep inside you  
instrumental  
Let me hold you  
I want to feel the heat inside  
Let my arms around you  
Let me know youre my desire  
The feel of love  
Just a bit of love  
I want from you  
And in fact the rest let me do  
I wanna little love  
Give me love  
I wanna little love  
From you  
I wanna little love  
Give me love  
I wanna little love  
Deep inside you  
Spoken  
I wanna little love  
I wanna little love from you  
The feel of love  
Just a bit of love  
I want from you  
And in fact the rest let me do  
I wanna little love  
Give me love  
I wanna little love  
From you  
I wanna little love  
Give me love

I wanna little love  
Give me love  
I wanna little love  
From you

Deep inside you to fade
