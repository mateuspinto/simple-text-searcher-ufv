I met with Napper Tandy  
And I shook him by the hand  
He said Hold me up for Chrissake  
For I can hardly stand  
The most disgraceful journey  
On which Ive ever been  
The last time that I travelled on  
The Boat Train  
  
I had a couple of drinks in town  
A few more at the port  
I puked up on the gangway  
But some kind folks helped me board  
They helped me to a table  
Poured whiskey down my throat  
They sat me at a table  
And I lost my watch and coat  
  
First we drank some whiskey  
Then we drank some gin  
Then we drank tequila  
I think thats what did me in  
Then we drank some brandy  
And the women had a dance  
The steward then announced  
That we could play the game of chance  
  
We crowded round the table  
With our money in our hands  
I ended up on the other side  
Without a penny in my pants  
I woke up in the toilet  
When we got to Holyhead  
The doors were all abanging  
And I wished that I was dead  
  
We got on board the train  
And then we had a drink or two  
Started playing poker  
But the booze ran out at Crewe  
Some people started sleeping  
Others looked for duty free  
Some bastard started singing  
The little cottage by the Lee  
He then sang Paper Roses  
Boolavogue Eileen Aru  
Somebody started slagging off  
The Pakis and the Jews  
  
First I found some whiskey  
Then I found some gin  
I sat down in the corner  
And I read the Daily News  
First I drank the whiskey  
Then I drank the gin  
I tried to make the toilet  
And I broke my fuckin shin  
Next thing that I knew  
I was in London in the rain  
Staggering up the platform  
Off the Boat Train
