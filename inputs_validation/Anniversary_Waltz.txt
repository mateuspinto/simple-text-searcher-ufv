We just discovered each other  
Tonight when the lights were low  
One dance led up to another  
And now I cant let you go  
  
So tell me I may always dance  
The Anniversary Waltz with you  
Tell me this is real romance  
An anniversary dream come true  
  
Let this be the answer  
To our future years  
Through millions of smiles  
And a few little tears  
May I always listen to  
The Anniversary Waltz  
With you  
  
Let this be the answer  
To our future years  
Through millions of smiles  
And a few little tears  
May I always listen to  
The Anniversary Waltz  
With you
