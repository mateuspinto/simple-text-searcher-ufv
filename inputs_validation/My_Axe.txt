I love my Faygo I love pills Shaggy  
I love my buddies my hatchetman but I love my axe

My axe is my buddy I bring him when I walk  
Me and my axe will leave your head outlined in chalk  
My axe is my buddy he always makes me laugh  
Me and my axe cut biggots spinal cords in half  
My axe is my buddy and when I wind him back

My axe is my buddy I never leave without him  
Me and my axe will leave your neck a bloody fountain

Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope  
Look into the deadest tree tell me baby what you see  
dontt you hear the branches cry Asking for the reasons why  
If they hang so many men from the branches off of them  
Why did humans make them play with them in their evil way  
Look into the moons beam can you fathom what its seen  
Bodies draging from a truck driven by a biggot fuck  
Why you think that heavens cry acid rain and blizzard sky  
Aint no covering tracks and thats why Im here and oh yes  
  
Violent J  
My axe is my buddy hell thump into your head  
Me and my axe will make your white ponys red  
My axe is my buddy you let that ditzy wave  
Me and my axe will fuck your mother on your grave
