While horsemen ride across the green  
And Snow White still remains unseen  
Pegasus the winged horse  
Relays his messages by Morse  
And like some pirate sailor  
We crossed the Spanish Main  
And brought our magic carpet  
To a marble staircased plain  
  
While Handel plays his melody  
Doctors cause uncertainty  
And though I know the lifeguards brave  
There is no one for him to save  
And like some pirate sailor  
We crossed the Spanish Main  
And brought our magic carpet  
To a marble staircased plain  
  
Cock Robin views his frozen feet  
And wraps them in a winding sheet  
And calls out for his favourite drink  
The Persian thats as warm as mink  
And like some pirate sailor  
We crossed the Spanish Main  
And brought our magic carpet  
To a marble staircased plain
