Like a cloud full of rain shouldnt hang in the sky  
Ice shouldnt burn or a bumble bee fly  
If you feel so happy then why do you cry  
Oh nothin bout love makes sense  
  
Like an ocean liner shouldnt float on the sea  
A pearl in an oyster or a circus of fleas  
Someone so perfect cant be fallin for me  
Oh nothin bout love makes sense  
  
Chorus  
Nothin bout love is less than confusin  
You can win when youre losin  
Stand when youre fallin  
I cant figure it out  
Nothin bout love can make an equation  
Nothin short of amazin  
Wish I could explain it  
But I didnt know how  
  
The way that we dance  
The reason we dream  
That big Italian tower  
Oh how does it lean  
Somethin so strong shouldnt make me this weak  
Oh nothin bout love makes sense  
  
Chorus  
  
Like the lights of Las Vegas glowin out of the sand  
A jumbo shrimp or a baby grand  
How you touch my heart when you hold my hand  
Oh nothin bout love makes sense  
  
Oh nothin bout love makes sense  
Oh nothin bout love makes sense  
Oh nothin bout love makes sense
