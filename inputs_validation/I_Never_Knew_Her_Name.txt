Well she swept through the church  
Like a sweet Sunday prayer  
While the choir sang Son of Heaven  
And the groom just walked on air  
  
I was killing time with Jesus  
When the wedding bells began  
And I saw the most beautiful woman  
Getting married to a handsome man  
  
And she walked like a mystery  
And she passed like summer rain  
And she said I do like an angel  
But I never knew her name  
  
Oh the congregation gathered  
But in darkness I remained  
In love with the bride of a handsome man  
But I never knew her name  
  
In the shadow of the holy  
Oh I heard my telltale heart  
Whisper words that never reached her  
As her vows were made at last  
  
Oh the preacher with his blessing  
Pronounced them man and wife  
And I saw the most beautiful woman  
Make a promise to be kept for life
