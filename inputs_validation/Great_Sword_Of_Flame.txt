Iron sounds sear the wound  
Hungry screams fill the air  
Kindred blood infant blood child flesh for their feast  
Judgment falls on the son  
Judgment falls on the King  
Storm of blood raging free  
Taste the blood on my hands  
  
Great sword of flame  split the night  
Great sword of flame in the sky  
Great sword of flame  rip the night  
Great sword of flame in the sky  
  
Open veins tear his heart rip the eyes from his head  
Under God under siege bind their souls to deceit  
Vengeance wrought by the gods forged in sin  
Forged by me  
Seer and whore thunder lord  
Why should I weep for thee  
  
Great sword of flame  split the night  
Great sword of flame in the sky  
Great sword of flame  rip the night  
Great sword of flame in the sky  
  
I am born from the blood of the feast  
She is born from the altar of sacrifice  
We are judgment jury and executioner  
Dark instruments of divine vengeance violence and justice  
Childrens blood virgin blood anoints our sovereignty  
Weep now and atone  
  
Oh Shell embrace you in Hades  
Black cloud of slavery ohsilver sided death  
  
Great sword of flame  split the night  
Great sword of flame in the sky  
Great sword of flame  rip the night  
Great sword of flame in the sky  
Great sword of flame  split the night  
Great sword of flame in the sky  
Great sword of flame  rip the night  
Great sword of flame in the sky  
Great sword of flame in the sky  
Great sword of flame  
Great sword of flame
