I got enough on my mind  
That when she pulls me by the hair  
She hasnt much to hold onto  
She keeping count on her hand  
One two three days that Ive been sleeping on my side  
  
I finish kissing my death  
So now I head back up the steps  
Thinking about where Ive been  
I mean the sun was never like this  
  
I wanna feel with the seasons  
I guess it makes sense  
Cause my lifes become as vapid as  
A night out in Los Angeles  
And I just wanna stay in bed  
  
and hold you like I used to  
You know that I am home  
So darling if you love me  
Would you let me know  
  
Or go on go on go on if you were thinking that the worst is yet to come  
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff  
For once for once for once I get the feeling that Im right where I belong  
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff  
  
She got enough on her mind  
That she feel no sorrow  
I let my fate fill the air  
So now she rolling down the window  
Never been one to hold on  
But I need a last breath  
So I ask if she remembers when  
She used to come and visit me  
We were fools to think that nothing could go wrong  
  
Go on go on go on if you were thinking that the worst is yet to come  
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff  
For once for once for once I get the feeling that Im right where I belong  
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff  
  
I think I kinda like it but I might have had too much  
  
Ill move back down  
To this western town  
When they find me out  
Make no mistake about it  
  
Ill move back down  
To this western town  
When they find me out  
Make no mistake about it  
  
Ill move back down  
To this western town  
  
Go on go on go on if you were thinking that the worst is yet to come  
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff  
  
Go on go on go on if you were thinking that the worst is yet to come  
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff  
For once for once for once I get the feeling that Im right where I belong  
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff  
  
I think I kinda like it but I might have had too much  
Ill move back down
