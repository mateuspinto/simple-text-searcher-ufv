Nothing ever stops all these thoughts and the pain attached to them  
Sometimes I wonder why this is happenin  
Its like nothing I can do would distract me when  
I think of how I shot myself in the back again  
cause from the infinite words I can say I  
Put all pain you gave to me on display  
But didnt realize instead of setting it free I  
Took what I hated and made it a part of me  
  
Never goes away  
Never goes away  
  
And now  
Youve become a part of me  
Youll always be right here  
Youve become a part of me  
Youll always be my fear  
I cant separate  
Myself from what Ive done  
Giving up a part of me  
Ive let myself become you  
  
Hearing your name the memories come back again  
I remember when it started happening  
I see you n every thought I had and then  
The thoughts slowly found words attached to them  
And I knew as they escaped away  
I was committing myself to em n everyday  
I regret saying those things cause now I see that I  
Took what I hated and made it a part of me  
  
Never goes away  
Never goes away  
  
And now  
Youve become a part of me  
Youll always be right here  
Youve become a part of me  
Youll always be my fear  
I cant separate  
Myself from what Ive done  
Giving up a part of me  
Ive let myself become you  
  
Never goes away  
Never goes away  
Never goes away  
Never goes away  
  
Get away from me  
Give me my space back you gotta just  
Go  
Everything comes down the memories of  
You  
I kept it in without letting you  
Know  
I let you go so get away from  
Me  
Give me my space back you gotta just  
Go  
Everything comes down the memories of  
You  
I kept it in without letting you  
Know  
I let you go  
  
And then youve become a part of me  
Youll always be right here  
Youve become a part of me  
Youll always be my fear  
I cant separate  
Myself from what Ive done  
Giving up a part of me  
Ive let myself become you  
Ive let myself become you  
Ive let myself become  
lost inside these thoughts of you  
giving up a part of me  
Ive let myself become you
