She was looking right through me like I was made out of glass  
A la la la la la  
Heaven lie and tell comes back like up at a check  
Why do you get so emotional  
Why do you get so emotional  
Why do you get  
  
Smokin and drinkin tryin to kick stuff Monday night  
Smokin and drinkin tryin to kick start Monday night  
I try and I try  
A sneaky feeling is coming over me  
  
Why do you get so emotional  
Why do you get so emotional  
Why do you get so emotional  
Why do you get so emotional  
  
She said boy you take you take me somehow I dont know who you are
anymore  
I dont know who you are anymore  
break  
Too many complications conversations that go nowhere  
Get out of my my my my head head I see you everywhere  
  
Why do you get so emotional  
Why do you get so emotional  
Why do you get so emotional  
Why do you get so emotional  
  
She said boy you take you take me somehow I dont know who you are
anymore  
I dont know who you are anymore I dont know who you are anymore  
Anymore anymore anymore anymore
