I was in the crowd  
The day that Jesus died  
And as He hung upon the cross  
His mother cried  
I saw the crown of thorns He wore  
The stripes upon His back  
The water and the blood ran out  
And then the sky turned black  
My mind was filled with anger  
My heart was filled with shame  
This man brought only healing  
Who could bring Him pain  
Why does it seem the strong  
Always victimize the weak  
And suddenly I found myself  
Standing to my feet  
And I cried Who nailed Him there  
This Child of peace and mercy  
Who nailed Him there  
Come and face me like a man  
Who nailed Him there  
And the crowd began to mock me  
I cried Oh my God I do not understand  
Then I turned and saw the hammer  
In my hand  
I am just a Roman soldier  
An ordinary man  
I love my wife and children  
I do the best I can  
How could I have killed Him  
It must be someone else  
Theres got to be an answer  
I just cant blame myself  
And I cried Who nailed Him there  
This Child of peace and mercy  
Who nailed Him there  
Come and face me like a man  
Who nailed Him there  
And the crowd began to mock me  
I cried Oh my God I do not understand  
Then I turned and saw the hammer  
In my hand  
I nailed Him there  
The child of peace and mercy  
I nailed Him there  
I am the guilty man  
I nailed Him there  
With my sins and my transgressions  
I cried Oh my God now I understand  
When I turned and saw the hammer in my hand
