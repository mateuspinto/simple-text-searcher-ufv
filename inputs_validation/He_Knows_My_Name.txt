ChorusIsrael  
I have a Maker  
He Formed My Heart  
Before even time began  
My life was in his hands  
  
Chorus  
He knows my name  
He knows my every thought  
He sees each tear that falls  
And hears me when I call  
  
Kids  
I have a father  
He calls me his own  
Hell never leave me  
No matter where I go  
  
Chorus  
He knows my name  
He knows my every thought  
He sees each tear that falls  
And hears me when I call  
  
He hears me when I call  
He hears me when I call  
He hears me when I call  
  
He knows my name  
He knows my every thought  
He sees each tear that falls  
And hears me when I call  
  
I have a Maker  
He Formed My Heart  
Before even time began  
My life was in his hands  
  
Chorus  
He knows my name  
He knows my every thought  
He sees each tear that falls  
And hears me when I call  
  
Kids  
I have a father  
He calls me his own  
Hell never leave me  
No matter where I go  
  
Chorus  
He knows my name  
He knows my every thought  
He sees each tear that falls  
And hears me when I call  
  
He hears me when I call  
He hears me when I call  
He hears me when I call you are my father and I love you  
He hears me when I call you are my father and I love you  
He hears me when I call you are my father and I love you  
He hears me when I call you are my father and I love you  
  
He knows my name  
He knows my every thought  
He sees each tear that falls  
And hears me when I call
