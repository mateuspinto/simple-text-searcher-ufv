Slowly crossing as the river runs below  
Never stopping for whats waiting soon will show  
And this the last time looking back Ill see my home  
For he awaits me reaching for my soul  
He calls my name and waves me on  
The fallen one he stands in flame  
  
Well the life that he has given full of riches  
And success has a price that I made good in  
Blood to pay And the light he now is showing  
To guide my every footstep is insurance if  
I falter on my way And what God has now  
Forsaken and man has never seen are the  
Riches of the underworld below all my  
Years of earthly pleasures gave support  
Unto the bridge I now cross it giving  
Him my soul  
  
Dark Lord I summon thee demanding the  
Sacred right to burn in hell ride up on hells  
hot wind Face one more evil than thou take  
My lustful soul  
Drink my blood as I drink yours impale me on  
the horns of death  
Cut off my head release all my evil Lucifer is king  
Praise Satan  
  
I know the one who waits Satan is  
His name across the bridge of  
Death there he stands in flame  
I know the one who waits Satan  
Is his name across the bridge of death  
There he stands in flame  
  
He is my provider as I walk into the  
Void for eternity I give him my soul  
I shall do his bidding obey him  
Without question even walk among the living if  
Im told  
  
Satan dont forsake me I wait for  
You to take me grant me wings and as  
Your messenger Ill fly
