Say you love me  
Say those three words and  
I will give my love to you  
My love is higher than a mission bell how deep  
Deeper than a wishing well how strong  
Stronger than a magic spell  
My love for you  
  
Its wider than the widest sea how long  
Longer than a memory How sweet  
Sweeter than a honey tree  
My love um for you  
  
Give me your heart of gold  
Your heavenly magic touch  
To cherish have and hold  
I need your love so much  
  
Say you love me  
Say those three words and  
I will give my love to you  
My love is warmer than a day in spring how bright  
Brighter than a diamond ring how great  
Greater than a mighty king  
My love for you  
  
Is taller than the tallest tree how soft  
Softer than a summer breeze  
Oh I ask you please  
Give your love your love  
Sweet love to me  
  
How high um  
How deep um  
How strong um  
How wide um  
How long um
