English translation  
Though Ive lived  
All this time  
All by myself  
Unconcerned with destiny  
I was awoken by  
A flash of light  
In the middle of the night  
I quietly stand at the exit  
Shooting light at the darkness  
Nowadays I wonder if making promises  
Will only make things worse  
I just want to tell someone my wish  
Ill introduce you to my family  
Im sure youll go over well  
No matter what happens  
Were always together  
No matter what happens  
Were by each others side  
A light named you finds me  
In the middle of the night  
Go out into a noisy street When you turn my way  
Take off the mask of destiny Take it all away  
Stop doing meaningless things  
Like always trying to predict whats gonna happen next  
Lets eat tasty food today  
The future is still way off  
Even I dont know what will happen  
Dont complete it  
Make it better  
Well be okay if we take it  
One scene at a time  
A light named you reflects my scenario  
On the screen  
Lets talk some more  
About the tomorrow which is just around the bend  
Turn off the TV  
An look only at me  
No matter how good it seems  
I cant truly believe  
At those times  
Were with each other  
A light called you finds me  
In the middle of the night  
Lets talk some more  
About the tomorrow which is just around the bend  
Turn off the TV  
And look only at me  
Lets talk some more  
About the tomorrow which is just around the bend  
Turn off the tV  
And look only at me
