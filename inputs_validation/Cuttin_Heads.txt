Hey Poppi yea ho  
Hey Poppi yea ho  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Lay low proud Poppi  
Lay low proud Poppi shout it out  
Hes from the deep south shout it out  
Pass Christian Mississippi  
Where the cane breaks are burning every night  
Lay low proud Poppi shout it out  
  
Chorus  
Hey oh  
Hey oh  
Oh Poppi  
Hey oh  
Hey oh  
Hey Poppi  
Hey oh  
Hey oh  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Poppi had a wife  
And she was black and Poppi was white shout it out  
Everything was rolling great shout it out  
Till some man called her race a disgrace  
Oh no  
  
Chorus  
  
Well Poppi went down to the river  
To defend the honor of his wife  
somebodys killing somebody  
Gonna drown the man in the water shout it out  
And the water was shiny like a new knife  
But Poppi stopped at the banks of the delta  
He said this sure aint worth this mans life  
Someday the wind of change  
Is gonna blow on through  
And put all of these jokers right  
See man and sing now  
  
Chorus  
  
chuck d  
Papa got a brand new bag  
Delta blues got em dazed and confused  
Came a long way crazy  
Seems the abuse  
Is racisms baby  
Its wild  
Cause I connect the word with pain  
Now some smile when they scream the name  
Funny how the times have changed  
And the rhymes have changed  
But some cats frame remains the same  
Agitating adjective  
What gives Die n word die  
But I want to live  
Known all this  
Where the word came from  
I must be three times stupid  
And stuck on dumb  
If I use it and confuse it  
With a term of love  
Now popular culture  
Cant stop til it gets enough  
Underlined in marketing campaigns  
I feel undermined  
Heard the n word promotes the bottom line  
Down by the river theres a great divide  
Lets ride  
  
repeat x4  
Dont call me nigga cause you know I dont like it like that  
  
Shout it out  
Yeah shout it out  
Tell the world  
Shout it out  
I said  
Hey oh  
Hey oh  
Hey oh  
Hey oh  
Oh Poppi  
Hey oh  
Hey oh  
Tell the world  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Tell the world  
That it aint right  
Tell the world  
Dont set us back oh Poppi  
Dont set us back now Poppi  
Tell the world
