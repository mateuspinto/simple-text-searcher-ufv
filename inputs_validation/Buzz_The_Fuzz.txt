Once there was a fellow  
And his name was Buzz  
He was just a rookie cop  
Just a baby fuzz  
He patrolled the Sunset Strip  
In the land of the free  
And the home of the hip  
He protected you and me  
From evil women like  
Poor Alice D  
Alice was the girl  
That all good hippies dread  
And they called her sweet Alice Dhead  
Alice it was plain to see was  
Full of pot and STP  
Shed attract a great big crowd  
Because her inner peace was much too loud  
Good Buzz did the thing  
That all the good fuzz must  
Stuck his gun in Alices back  
And said This is a bust  
Shone the flashlight in her eyes  
She began to hypnotize  
Buzz said What a wild sensation  
Guess this must be hallu hallucina cina cina cination hmmm  
Love is so sensational  
When you fall in love with eyes dilational la la  
Now theyre taking pills and shots  
And Buzz is not afraid of Watts  
Buzz and Alice D have shown  
The way of where the Fuzz might be some day  
Buzz is still a cop of course  
Hes the pusher on the force  
Hes protecting you and me  
From evil women like  
Poor Alice D
