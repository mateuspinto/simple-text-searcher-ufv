I remember campin all night  
Down by the rivers edge  
Skinny dippin in the bright moonlight  
Divin off a ledge  
Skippin rocks across the water  
Fishin on an old trout line  
Giggin frogs til the early mornin  
Smokin dried crossvine  
  
Take me back down where the Red River rolls  
Send me back to Louisianne  
Take me back down where the white water flows  
To the Cajun promised land  
Give me my line and my old pirogue  
Get me back as fast as you can  
Take me back home where the Red River rolls  
Take me back home where the Red River rolls  
  
Floatin down the river on a patched up inner tube  
Eatin dinner on the ground  
Made of fresh caught catfish stew  
Lay wake at night  
When I hear a wildcat scream  
Tellin tales by campfire light  
About the girls in our dreams  
  
Take me back home where the Red River rolls  
Send me back to Louisianne  
Take me back down where the white water flows  
To the Cajun promised land  
Give me my line and my old pirogue  
Get me back as fast as you can  
Take me back home where the Red River rolls  
Take me back home where the Red River rolls  
  
Take me back home where the Red River rolls  
Send me back to Louisianne  
Take me back down where the white water flows  
To the Cajun promised land  
Give me my line and my old pirogue  
Get me back as fast as you can  
Take me back home where the Red River rolls  
Take me back home where the Red River rolls
