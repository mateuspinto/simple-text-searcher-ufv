The first thing I remember knowin was a lonesome whistle blowin  
And the youngest dream of growin up to ride  
On a freight train leavin town not knowin where Im bound  
No one could change my mind but mama tried  
One and only rebel child for my family meek and mild  
My mama seemed to know what lay in store  
Spite of all my Sunday learnin toward the bad I kept on turnin  
Till mama couldnt hold me anymore  
And I turned twenty one in prison doing life without parole  
No one could steer me right but mama tried mama tried  
Mama tried to raise me better but her pleadings I denied  
That leaves only me to blame cause mama tried  
  
Dear old daddy rest his soul left my mama heavy load  
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes  
Working hours without rest wanted me to have the best  
She tried to raise me right but I refused  
And I turned twenty one in prison  
That leaves only me to blame cause mama tried
