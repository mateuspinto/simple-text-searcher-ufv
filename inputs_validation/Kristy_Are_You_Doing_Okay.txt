Theres a moment in time  
And its stuck in my mind  
Way back when we were just kids  
  
Cause your eyes told the tale  
Of an act of betrayal  
I knew that somebody did  
  
Oh waves of time  
Seem to wash away  
The scenes of our crimes  
But for you this never ends  
  
Can you stay strong  
Can you go on  
Kristy are you doing okay  
A rose that wont bloom  
Winters kept you  
Dont waste your whole life trying  
To get back what was taken away  
  
Though the marks on your dress  
Had been neatly repressed  
I knew that something was wrong  
And I should have spoke out  
And Im so sorry now  
I didnt know  
Cause we were so young  
  
Oh clouds of time  
Seem to rain on  
Innocence left behind  
And it never goes away  
  
Can you stay strong  
Can you go on  
Kristy are you doing okay  
A rose that wont bloom  
Winters kept you  
Dont waste your whole life trying  
To get back what was taken away  
  
Oh clouds of time  
Seem to rain on  
Innocence left behind  
And it never goes away  
  
Can you stay strong  
Can you go on  
Kristy are you doing okay  
A rose that wont bloom  
Winters kept you  
Dont waste your whole life trying  
To get back what was taken away  
  
Dont waste your whole life trying  
To get back what was taken away
