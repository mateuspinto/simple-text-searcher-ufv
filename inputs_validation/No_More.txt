We need to have a conversation  
  
I made you why would I play you  
Trade home base four California angel  
Swinging a fast bitch foul out betray you  
When I wont even wanna hit it in a day or two  
Straight home Id run well thats debatable  
I cant front I hit a slump all players do  
But tough times are minor to a major dude  
We all lose sometimes I call it paying dues  
Now youre searching all the clubs for whats available  
A year ago my slot was unassailable  
My feast is a famine without you to cater to  
If these walls could talk what would they say to you  
  
Chorus  
Dont understand what we gonna do  
But its like you dont know me  
And I dont know you no more  
Not no more  
And its like damn how the hell we get here  
No idea but were not what we were before  
Could it be that I dont love you and you dont love me no more  
That girl dont live here not no more  
Baby baby  
Yeah Yeah Yeah that girl no more  
  
The dining room has an empty chair  
The mirrored staircase has an empty stair  
House full of company but no ones here  
We singing cheers while we holding back tears  
To keep up appearances in front of our peers  
We play holiday card tricks every year  
Blackjack poker make the joker disappear  
The ace cant breathe when its tension in the air  
Three clubs in one night but nobody cares  
Cause its still not a full house without a pair  
You tipped your hand but the text wasnt clear  
Youre dealing from the bottom queen of hearts play fair  
  
Chorus  
Dont understand what we gonna do  
But its like you dont know me  
And I dont know you no more  
Not no more  
And its like damn how the hell we get here  
No idea but were not what we were before  
Could it be that I dont love you and you dont love me no more  
That girl dont live here not no more  
Baby baby  
Yeah Yeah Yeah that girl no more  
  
Slip in the door you hold my hopes so  
All I hear is love dont live here anymore  
We can tear the house down or build some scaffold  
Were sitting on a fence so where you wanna go  
Youre the architect of your life its your show  
You create the blueprint and how the rooms flow  
Before you burn the house down think take it slow  
Even arsonists need a shelter let me know  
  
Chorus  
Dont understand what we gonna do  
But its like you dont know me  
And I dont know you no more  
Not no more  
And its like damn how the hell we get here  
No idea but were not what we were before  
Could it be that I dont love you and you dont love me no more  
That girl dont live here not no more  
Baby baby  
Yeah Yeah Yeah that girl no more
