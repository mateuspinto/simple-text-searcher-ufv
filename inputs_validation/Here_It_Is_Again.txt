Here it is again its so so mad  
Turning young and happy into old and sad  
Here it is again just passed by chance  
All the way to the lawyer from a sloppy dance  
It was another holiday argument  
But she threw him into the sea  
A glass bottomed boat pulled him up  
His face was rotting in weed  
It was rotting in weed Ive seen those people bleed  
If it never happens well it happened to me  
  
Do you know who you love  
Does anybody here have a clue  
Just who theyre with  
And it was glance by glance  
And it was blow by blow  
Did they know  
Just who they loved  
  
Here it is again in the same disguise  
Clean shoes smart tie and deep blue eyes  
Here it is again and it makes you sick  
Watch the blind man walk along without a stick  
Heads he was a beautiful lover  
Tails he was definitely bad  
Heads youre like no other  
Tails just the best hed had  
  
Youre the best hes had  
Youre the best so far  
All the way to the church from the back of a car  
  
Do you know who you love  
Does anybody here have a clue  
Just who theyre with  
And it was glance by glance  
And it was blow by blow  
Did they know  
Just who they loved  
Just who they loved  
Just who they loved  
Just who they loved  
Just who they loved
