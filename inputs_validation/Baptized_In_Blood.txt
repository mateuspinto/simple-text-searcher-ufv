Under command a newborn child  
Submerged in blood the dead they smile  
Growing possessed burning inside  
A bloody feast for us tonight  
  
The way of death  
Is growing hear just take my hand  
Skies grow black  
Unholy corpses upon their land  
  
The dead they gather around  
Praising the child they found  
Possessed the child shall kill  
The future is now revealed  
  
Baptized in blood  
Destined to burn  
Baptized in blood  
Reborn theyll learn  
  
Gather around watch and see  
A new creation of misery  
Taking the place of the elderly dead  
Forbidden ways now in his head  
  
The way of death  
Is growing hear just take my hand  
Skies grow black  
Unholy corpses upon their land  
  
The dead they gather around  
Praising the child they found  
Possessed the child shall kill  
The future is now revealed  
  
Baptized in blood  
Destined to burn  
Baptized in blood  
Reborn theyll learn  
  
Baptized in blood  
Destined to burn  
Baptized in blood  
Reborn theyll learn
