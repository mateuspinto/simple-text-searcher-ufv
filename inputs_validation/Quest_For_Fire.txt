In a time when dinosaurs walked the earth  
When the land was swamp and caves were home  
In an age when prize possession was fire  
To search for landscapes men would roam  
  
Then the tribes they came to steal their fire  
And the wolves they howled into the night  
As they fought a vicious angry battle  
To save the power of warmth and light  
  
Drawn by quest for fire  
They searched all through the land  
Drawn by quest for fire  
Discovery of man  
  
And they thought that when the embers died away  
That the flame of life had burnt and died  
Didnt know the sparks that made the fire  
Were made by rubbing stick and stone  
  
So they ploughed through the forest and swamps of danger  
And they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts  
In the search to find another fire  
To regain the power of light and heat  
  
Drawn by quest for fire  
They searched across the land  
Drawn by quest for fire  
Discovery of man
