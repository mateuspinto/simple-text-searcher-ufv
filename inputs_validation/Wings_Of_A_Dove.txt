If I had the wings of a dove  
If I had the wings of a dove  
Well I would fly fly away fly away  
And be at rest  
  
If I had the wings of a dove  
If I had the wings of a dove  
Well I would fly fly away fly away  
And be at rest  
  
Oh since I have no wings since  
I have no wings since I have no wings  
Im gonna sing sing sing  
Since I have no wings since  
I have no wings since I have no wings  
Im gonna sing sing sing  
  
If I had the wings of a dove  
If I had the wings of a dove  
I would fly fly away fly away  
And be at rest  
  
Since I have no wings since  
I have no wings since I have no wings  
Im gonna sing sing sing  
Since I have no wings since  
I have no wings since I have no wings  
Im gonna sing sing sing sing  
  
If I had the wings of a dove imagine me  
If I had the wings of a dove  
Well I would fly fly away fly away  
And I would be at rest
