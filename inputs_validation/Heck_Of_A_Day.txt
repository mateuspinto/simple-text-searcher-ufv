Nowhere to go nothing to see  
Except sand and sand and sand and you and me  
  
Baked from the heat weve got sun on all sides  
Getting tanned and tanned like were couple of hides  
  
Two lost nomads who will never be missed  
Some might interpret this  
As just a karmic slap on the wrist  
But Ive just gotta say its a heck of a day to be us  
  
Its a heck of a day to not have a car  
And just walk and walk and walk and not know where you are  
  
Weve got no kind of map  
Nothing to shows us the way  
And its just talk and talk and talk with nothing to say  
Its a heck of a day heck of a day to be us  
Its a heck of a day to be us
