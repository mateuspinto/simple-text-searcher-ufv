Rain on me Im not complaining  
Im soaking from my hat down to my shoes  
Rain on me cause Im believing  
Love is something I get to lose  
What do you know about love  
What do you know about love  
What do you know about love  
What do you know about love  
Take a look at my face to get my meaning  
Mister I got scars on my knees  
Take a look at these hands I got from praying  
You better believe I do believe  
Its raining on bleecker street  
From my heart down to my feet now  
Doo doo doo doo doo doo  
Now I know that this blood here is for bleeding  
Sure as jesus is up above  
He knows my heart is just for pleading  
But what do you know about love  
Its raining on my main street  
From my heart down to my feet now  
Doo doo doo doo doo doo  
Raining from my heart down to my feet now  
What do you know about love  
What do you know about love  
What do you know about love  
What do you know about love  
Its raining on bleecker street  
Raining from my heart down to my feet now  
Doo doo doo doo doo doo  
Raining from my heart down to my feet yessir  
Doo doo doo doo doo doo

falling down on me now now now now

Raining from my heart down to my feet now now  
What do you know about love
