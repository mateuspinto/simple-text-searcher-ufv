Me and my uncle went ridin down  
To South Colorado west Texas bound  
We stopped over in Santa Fe  
that day on the pony just about half way  
And you know it was the hottest part of the day  
  
I took the horses up to the stall  
Went to the barroom ordered drinks for all  
Three days in the saddle You know my body hurt  
It being summer I took off my shirt  
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt  
  
West Texas cowboys they was all around  
Wheat liquor and money they loaded down  
So soon after payday no one seemed ashamed  
You know my uncle he starts playin the game  
Hey A hollow jack and the winner take the hand  
  
My uncle starts winning the cowboys got sore  
One of them called him and then two more  
Accused him of cheatin oh no it couldnt be  
I know my uncle hes as honest as me  
And Im as honest as a Denver man can be  
  
One of them cowboys he starsts to draw  
And I shot him down Lord He never saw  
Shot me another Right then he hit the floor  
In the confusion my uncle grabbed the gold  
And we hightailed it down to Mexico  
  
Now I love thoe cowboys I love their gold  
Love my uncle God rest his soul  
Taught me good Lord Taught me all I know  
Taught me so well that I grabbed that gold and  
I left his dead ass there by the side of the road
