Give your broken heart to me  
Let me give you my soul  
For you to keep  
Just give me some words  
To speak  
  
Im gonna leave it down  
Cause all I wanna do is be with you  
  
Chorus  
Someone like you  
Someone like you  
Someone like you no fool can suffer  
I just cant wait long enough  
For someone else to take your love  
  
Let me open my heart  
For you to see  
Let me give you my soul  
For you to keep  
Let your love go  
Just let it go with me  
  
Have I ever let you down  
Cause all I wanna do it be around  
  
Chorus  
  
And I can learn to live again  
And wash away the hurt inside  
  
Im gonna leave it down  
Cause all I wanna do is be with you  
  
Someone like you  
Someone like you  
Someone like you no fool can suffer  
Someone like you no fool can suffer
