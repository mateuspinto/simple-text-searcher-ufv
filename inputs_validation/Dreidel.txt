I feel like a spinning top for a dreidel  
The spinning dont stop when you leave the cradle  
You just slow down  
Round and around this world you go  
Spinning through lives of the people you know  
We all slow down  
  
How you gonna keep on turning from day to day  
How you gonna keep from turning your life away  
No days you can borrow  
No time you can buy  
No trust in tomorrow  
Its a lie  
  
Oh I feel like a spinning top for a dreidel  
The spinning dont stop when you leave the cradle  
You just slow down  
Round and around this world you go  
Spinning through lives of the people you know  
We all slow down  
  
How you gonna keep on turning from day to day  
How you gonna keep from turning your life away  
  
And I feel like Im adipping and adiving  
My sky shoes are spiked with lead heels  
Im lost in this star car Im adriving  
But my air sole keeps pushing big wheels  
My world is a constant confusion  
My mind is prepared to attack  
My past a persuasive illusion  
Im watching the future its black  
  
What do you know  
You know just what you perceive  
What can you show  
Nothing of what you believe  
And as you grow  
Each thread of life that you lead  
Will spin around your deeds  
And dictate your needs  
As you sell your soul  
And you sow your seeds  
And you wound yourself  
And your loved one bleeds  
And your habits grow  
And your conscious feeds  
On all that you thought you should be  
I never thought this could happen to meeeee  
  
I feel like a spinning top for a dreidel  
The spinning dont stop when you leave the cradle  
You just slow down  
Round and around this world you go  
Spinning through lives of the people you know  
We all slow down  
  
How you gonna keep on turning from day to day  
How you gonna keep from turning your life away  
  
I feel like a spinning top for a dreidel  
The spinning dont stop when you leave the cradle  
You just slow down  
You just slow down  
You just slow down
