Field Commander Cohen he was our most important spy  
Wounded in the line of duty  
Parachuting acid into diplomatic cocktail parties  
Urging Fidel Castro to abandon fields and castles  
Leave it all and like a man  
Come back to nothing special  
Such as waiting rooms and ticket lines  
Silver bullet suicides  
And messianic ocean tides  
And racial rollercoaster rides  
And other forms of boredom advertised as poetry  
I know you need your sleep now  
I know your lifes been hard  
But many men are falling  
Where you promised to stand guard  
  
I never asked but I heard you cast your lot along with the poor  
But then I overheard your prayer  
That you be this and nothing more  
Than just some grateful faithful womans favorite singing millionaire  
The patron Saint of envy and the grocer of despair  
Working for the Yankee Dollar  
  
I know you need your sleep now  
  
Ah lover come and lie with me if my lover is who you are  
And be your sweetest self awhile until I ask for more my child  
Then let the other selves be wrong yeah let them manifest and come  
Till every taste is on the tongue  
Till love is pierced and love is hung  
And every kind of freedom done then oh  
Oh my love oh my love oh my love  
Oh my love oh my love oh my love
