Little child little child  
Little child wont you dance with me  
Im so sad and lonely  
Baby take a chance with me  
  
Little child little child  
Little child wont you dance with me  
Im so sad and lonely  
Baby take a chance with me  
  
If you want someone  
To make you feel so fine  
Then well have some fun  
When youre mine all mine  
So come come on come on  
  
Little child little child  
Little child wont you dance with me  
Im so sad and lonely  
Baby take a chance with me  
  
When youre by my side  
Youre the only one  
Dont you run and hide  
Just come on come on  
So come on come on come on  
  
Little child little child  
Little child wont you dance with me  
Im so sad and lonely  
Baby take a chance with me  
Baby take a chance with me  
Baby take a chance with me
