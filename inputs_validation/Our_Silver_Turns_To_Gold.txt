Watching the smiles on those a few who have somebody to hold onto  
Knowing I need you knowing your needed a special way to be  
My heart was shot by cupids arrow while gaining all my pain and sorrow  
  
Our silver turns to gold when I have you to hold  
Sometimes your fire sometimes ice sometimes your in paradise yeah  
Paradise yeah paradise yeah  
  
When you smile the sun shines out of a blue sky  
Rainbows burst into bloom  
People are dancing and some are romancing  
Grey skies are out of view  
And when your heart was young youll sing a summer song  
  
Our silver turns to gold when I have you to hold  
Sometimes your fire sometimes ice sometimes your in paradise yeah  
Paradise yeah paradise yeah  
  
Just when your sweetheart whispers I love you  
Flowers burst into bloom  
Love hens are swimming and church bells are ringing  
Each time I think of you  
Then on both you and I lights on forever shine  
  
Our silver turns to gold when I have you to hold  
Sometimes your fire sometimes ice sometimes your in paradise yeah  
Paradise yeah paradise yeah  
  
Our silver turns to gold when I have you to hold  
Sometimes your fire sometimes ice sometimes your in paradise yeah  
Paradise yeah paradise yeah
