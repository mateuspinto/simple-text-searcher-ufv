Verse 1  
One Lord one faith and one baptism  
One Father of all Who is in and through you all  
And upon this rock I will build my church  
And the gates of hell shall not prevail against it  
Here oh Israel the Lord our God is one Lord  
So for truth we stand in a pledge of allegiance  
  
Chorus  
To the truth I pledge allegiance  
To the cross I cling in reverence of nailscarred hands  
To the church I vow to walk in the light  
To the truth I pledge allegiance  
  
Verse 2  
So buy the truth and sell it not dont sell it  
For the Bible says the truth shall make you free free indeed  
There is therefore now no condemnation to them  
Who are in Christ Jesus I once was lost but now Im found  
I was blind but now I see the truth  
  
Chorus 2  
To the truth I pledge allegiance  
To the cross I cling in reverence of nailscarred hands  
To the church I vow to walk in the light  
To the truth I pledge allegiance  
  
Bridge  
And what shall we say if we neglect so great salvation  
And to whom shall we go seeing Thou has the words of eternal life  
We must teach it when we rise up and when we lie down  
To our children to our world  
  
Chorus 3  
To the truth I pledge allegiance  
To the cross I cling in reverence of nailscarred hands  
To the church I vow to walk in the light
