Father let me dedicate all this life to Thee  
In whatever worldly state Thou would have me be  
Not from sorrow pain or care freedom dare I claim  
This alone shall be my prayer glorify Thy name  
  
Can a child presume to choose where or how to live  
Can a Fathers love refuse all the best to give  
Let my glad heart while it sings There in all proclaim  
And whatever the future brings glorify Thy Name  
  
Be glorified in me be glorified  
Be glorified in me be glorified
