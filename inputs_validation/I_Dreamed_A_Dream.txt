There was a time when girls were kind  
When their voices were soft  
And their words inviting  
There was a time when love was blind  
  
And the world was a song  
And the song was exciting  
There was a time  
It all went wrong  
  
I dreamed a dream of time gone by  
When hope was high  
And life worth living  
I dreamed that love would never die  
I dreamed that God would be forgiving  
  
When I was young and unafraid  
When dreams were made  
And used and wasted  
There was no ransom to be paid  
  
No song unsung no wine untasted  
But the tigers come at night  
With their voices soft as thunder  
And they tear your hope apart  
  
As they turn your dream to shame  
She slept this summer by my side  
She filled my days with endless wonder  
She took my childhood in her stride  
  
But she was gone when autumn came  
And still I dream shell come to me  
That we will spend the years together  
But there are dreams that cannot be  
  
And there are storms we cannot weather  
I had a dream my life would be  
So different from this hell Im living  
So different now from what it seemed  
But life cant kill  
The dream I dreamed
