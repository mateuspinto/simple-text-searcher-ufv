Turn the lights on  
  
How could someone hurt you but still make you feel so good  
Holler scream and curse you and you stand there and let them do it  
Just cause he gives you pain that dont mean he aint the one  
Fuck you out your brain youll be smiling when hes done  
  
So my advice would be no dont leave dont go so easy no  
Let that argument turn you on  
Its worth it  
  
And these are the lessons learned by lovers  
These are the reasons we make love  
Theres no exception one day we gotta look each other in the eye

Cause now youre so caught up in the passion  
But this shit is beyond compare yeah  
Cause dont he make your heart beat beat beat like a drum  
You fought hard but think about how hard you come

Just let that argument turn you on
