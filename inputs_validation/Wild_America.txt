One night out in la  
I met a Mexicana  
With a butchy girlfriend  
Who I thought was a man  
They took me to the alley  
To have a little chat  
People lined the corner  
Doin this and that  
In wild America  
  
Now I m in a black car  
With my Mexicana  
Shes got methedrine but  
I want marijuana  
I don t want to drive home  
Not in my condition  
So I ask my friend Matt  
To handle the ignition  
In wild America  
Exterminate the brutes  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Yeah  
Well I mean I like it heredo you have anything you d like to say to
America  
Id just like to say at this point that I m 24 hour 7 day a week 365 day a
year American  
  
I was glad that Debbie  
Had a sense of humor  
This time of the morning  
I tend to get gloomy  
She laughed and said iggy  
You have got a biggy  
I had no reply  
So I just closed my eyes  
In wild America  
Exterminate the brutes  
Theyre goin wild  
Goin wild  
They re goin wild  
They re goin wild baby  
They got all kinds of fuckin stuff  
They got everything you could imagine  
They re so god dammed spoiled  
They re poisoned inside  
They Judge a man by what hes got  
And they wanta have more and more  
More power more freedom  
Taller kids longer lives  
Everything bigger houses slaves whoa
