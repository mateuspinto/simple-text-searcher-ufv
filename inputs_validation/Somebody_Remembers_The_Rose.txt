Somebody remembers the rose  
While the other forgets how it grows  
Would all the dangers  
Would all the dangers of love  
Am I still a stranger  
Somebody remembers the dress  
How it was handsome  
Beautifully pressed  
Would all the dangers  
Would all the dangers of love  
Lost to a stranger  
Honey Im out of service  
For a while  
Damaged hearts been manufactured  
And everyday this one never works anyway  
Somebody remembers the rose  
While the other forgets how it grows  
Would all the dangers  
Would all the dangers of love  
Lost to a stranger  
Honey I know you  
Baby I know you  
Yeah I know you
