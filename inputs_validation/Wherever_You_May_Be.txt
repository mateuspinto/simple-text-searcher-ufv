As simple as breathing I picture your face  
All tangled in daydreams and shielded with grace  
I feel you beside me again  
Wherever you may be lift up your head for me  
Theres somewhere in my heart only for you  
If I must do without Ill let these sparks fly out  
Across the wilderness from me to you  
As certain as sunrise your image unwinds  
Youre clearer than crystal you fill up my mind  
Now I have you by my side  
Wherever you may be lift up your head for me  
Theres somewhere in my heart only for you  
Though continents divide and lonely thoughts collide  
Our Heaven will allow no distance now  
I can always close my eyes  
Take your absence by surprise  
Hold my breath and make believe  
As simple as breathing I picture your face  
All tangled in daydreams and shielded with grace  
Theres somewhere in my heart only for you  
If I must do without Ill let these sparks fly out  
Across this wilderness from me to you  
Wherever you may be  
Wherever you may be  
Lift up your head for me  
Lift up your head  
Theres somewhere in my heart only for you  
Somewhere in my heart  
If I must do without  
If I must do without  
Ill let these sparks fly out  
Ooh baby  
Across this wilderness from me to you  
Across this wilderness from me to you  
Wherever you may be  
Lift up your head for me  
Theres somewhere in my heart only for you  
Im missing you baby  
If I must do without  
Ill let these sparks fly out
