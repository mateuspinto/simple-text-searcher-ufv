As long as the moon shall rise as long as the rivers flow  
As long as the sun will shine as long as the grass shall grow  
The Senecas are an Indian tribe of the Iroquios nation  
Down on the New York Pennsylvania Line youll find their reservation  
After the US revolution corn planter was a chief  
He told the tribe these men they could trust that was his true belief  
He went down to Independence Hall and there was a treaty signed  
That promised peace with the USA and Indian rights combined  
George Washington gave his signature the Government gave its hand  
They said that now and forever more that this was Indian land  
As long as the moon shall rise  
On the Seneca reservation there is much sadness now  
Washingtons treaty has been broken and there is no hope no how  
Across the Allegheny River theyre throwing up a dam  
It will flood the Indian country a proud day for Uncle Sam  
It has broke the ancient treaty with a politicians grin  
It will drown the Indians graveyards corn planter can you swim  
The earth is mother to the the Senecas theyre trampling sacred ground  
Change the mint green earth to black mud flats as honor hobbles down  
As long as the moon shall rise  
The Iroquios Indians used to rule from Canada way south  
But no one fears the Indians now and smiles the liars mouth  
The Senecas hired an expert to figure another site  
But the great good army engineers said that he had no right  
Although he showed them another plan and showed them another way  
They laughed in his face and said no deal Kinuza dam is here to stay  
Congress turned the Indians down brushed off the Indians plea  
So the Senecas have renamed the dam they call it Lake Perfidy  
As long as the moon shall rise  
Washington Adams and Kennedy now hear their pledges ring  
The treaties are safe well keep our word but what is that gurgling  
Its the back water from Perfidy Lake its rising all the time  
Over the homes and over the fields and over the promises fine  
No boats will sail on Lake Perfidy in winter it will fill  
In summer it will be a swamp and all the fish will kill  
But the Government of the USA has corrected Georges vow  
The father of our country must be wrong whats an Indian anyhow  
As long as the moon shall rise look up as long as the rivers flow are you
thirsty  
As long as the sun will shine my brother are you warm as long as the grass
shall grow
