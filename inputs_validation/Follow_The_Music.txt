They tried to conquer the world with guns  
Like a horde of Huns  
That had to be removed  
We used a secret weapon  
We did it with a groove  
  
They tried to conquer the world with administration  
And make one nation  
But then they had to move  
We made us a home  
Built on a groove  
  
They tried to conquer the world with kindness  
And blind openmindedness  
Like they had something to prove  
Theyre on their own  
Amen we got the groove  
  
They tried to conquer the world and call it art  
So did Bonaparte  
Now he hangs in the Louvre  
Its not a museum piece  
This is the groove
