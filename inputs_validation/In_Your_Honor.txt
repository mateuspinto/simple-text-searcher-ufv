Can you hear me  
Hear me screamin  
Breaking in the muted skies  
This thunder heart  
Like bombs beating  
Echoing a thousand miles  
  
Mine is yours and yours is mine  
There is no divide  
In your honor  
I would die tonight  
  
Mine is yours and yours is mine  
I will sacrifice  
In your honor  
I would die tonight  
For you to feel alive  
  
Can you feel me  
Feel me breathing  
One last breathe before I close my eyes  
This suffering  
For receiving  
Deliver me into the other side  
  
For you to feel alive  
For you to feel alive  
For you to feel alive  
Ahh
