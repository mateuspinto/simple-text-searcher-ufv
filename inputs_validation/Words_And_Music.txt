You make me  
Think Im listenin to a symphony  
You make me  
Hear the beauty of your poetry  
You got a good way with music baby  
Got a good way with words  
You got a good way with music baby  
Got a good way with words  
You make me  
Hear the lyric in the harmony  
You make me  
Hear the chorus in the melody  
You got a good way with music baby  
Got a good way with words  
You got a good way with music baby  
Got a good way with words  
I see your face  
And when you walk my way  
The violins  
Always start to play  
And when you talk  
I dont care what you say  
It comes out I love you so  
Anyway you should know  
You make me  
Think Im listenin to a symphony  
You make me  
Hear the beauty of your poetry  
You got a good way with music baby  
Got a good way with words  
You got a good way with music baby  
Got a good way with words  
You got a good way with music baby  
Got a good way with words  
You got a good way with music baby  
Got a good way with words
