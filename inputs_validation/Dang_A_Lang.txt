Excuse Me Can I See Your Dang A Lang Brother  
I Mean You Know Just Juggle Your Balls Like The Ringalin Brothers  
Im The Harajukku Barbie I Aint Tripping On Your Chain  
I Mean Look I Got The Sports Package On My Range  
I Just Dip In The Pink For The Pink Effect  
DDiamonds On My Neck For The Link Effect  
And I Was Wondering If I Can Lip sync on that  
You Know My Name Rings  
Ring Tinkle Bells  
Wawatch Check  
Chain Check  
They Be On A Rain Check  
I Be On The Move  
They Be Reaching But They Cant Catch  
I Be With The Baddest bitch  
On The Island Styling  
Black Miley cyrus Saying Hi To Pirates  
I Be Singing Them Ballads  
When He Tossing My Salad  
When I Pet My Parrot All You See Is  
Colorful Carrots  
I Be Singing Them Ballads  
When He Tossing My Salad  
When I Pet My Parrot All You See Is  
Colorful Carrots  
Oh
