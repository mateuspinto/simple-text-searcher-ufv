Donna  
We were strangers starting out on a journey  
Never dreaming what wed have to go through  
Now here we are and Im suddenly standing  
At the beginning with you  
  
Richard  
No one told me I was going to find you  
Unexpected what you did to my heart  
  
Both  
When I lost hope you were there to remind me  
This is the start  
  
And life is a road and I wanna keep going  
Love is a river I wanna keep flowing  
Life is a road now and forever  
Wonderful journey  
Ill be there when the world stops turning  
Ill be there when the storm is through  
In the end I wanna be standing  
At the beginning with you  
  
Donna  
We were strangers on a crazy adventure  
Richard  
Never dreaming how our dreams would come true  
Both  
Now here we stand unafraid of the future  
At the beginning with you  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
I knew there was somebody somewhere  
Like me alone in the dark  
Now I know my dream will live on  
Ive been waiting so long  
Nothings gonna tear us apart  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Richard  
Yeah  
  
Both  
Life is a road and I wanna keep going  
Love is a river I wanna keep going on  
  
Donna  
Starting out on a journey  
  
Both  
Life is a road that I wanna keep going  
Love is a river I wanna keep on flowing  
In the end I wanna be standing  
At the beginning  
With you
