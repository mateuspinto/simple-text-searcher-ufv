I have a friend in you oh Mr Clarinet  
You make me laugh and then cry like the song of the clarinet  
Marry me marry me alive O  
I put on my coat of trumpets  
Will she be there Is my piccolo on straight  
  
  
Her white stockings and red dress that goes  
Swish swish swish around her legs of lace  
Marry me marry me alive O  
  
  
Could you tell her  
Would you tell her for me  
Oh Mr Clarinet confidant  
That I love her love her oh love her  
I love her but I cant wait  
  
  
Marry me marry me alive O  
Oh maybe oh maybe lie down  
  
  
I love her love her love her  
Love her love her love her love her
