Our love runs deep like a chevy  
If you fall Ill fall with you baby  
Cause thats the way we like to do it  
Thats the way we like  
  
You run around open doors like a gentleman  
Tell me girl every day youre my everything  
Cause thats the way you like to do it  
Thats the way you like  
  
Just a little West Coast and a bit of sunshine  
Hair blowing in the wind losing track of time  
Just you and I just you and I  
Woah woah  
  
No matter how far we go I want the whole world to know  
I want you bad and I wont have it any other way  
No matter what the people say  
I know that well never break  
Cause our love was made made in the USA  
Made in the USA yeah  
  
You always reading my mind like a letter  
When Im cold youre there like a sweater  
Cause thats the way we like to do it  
Thats the way we like  
And never ever let the world get the best of you  
Every night were apart Im still next to you  
Cause thats the way I like to do it  
Thats the way I like  
  
We touch down on the east coast  
Dinner in the sky rise winter is the best time for walking in the city lights  
You and I you and I  
Woah woah  
  
No matter how far we go I want the whole world to know  
I want you bad and I wont have it any other way  
No matter what the people say  
I know that well never break  
Cause our love was made made in the USA  
  
Cause baby Ill break the bullet  
And take the blow for love  
Woah our love was made in the USA  
Made in the USA made in the USA  
  
No matter how far we go I want the whole world to know  
I want you bad and I wont have it any other way  
No matter what the people say  
I know that well never break  
Cause our love was made made in the USA  
Made in the USA yeah  
  
Made in the US  
Made in the US  
Made in the USA
