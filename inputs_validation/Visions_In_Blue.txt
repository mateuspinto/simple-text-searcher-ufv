Face in the window in the night  
Caught for a second by the light  
Ashes of memories still aglow  
Only for you  
Portraits and pictures you once saw  
Visions in blue  
Read while the letters still remain  
Sip from the wine of youth again  
Oaths made in silence still return  
Only for you  
Cast like a shroud youre clutching on  
Visions in blue  
Catch aimless smiles from passers by  
Blistered and broken in reply  
Breath seems to mist the hazy view  
Only for you  
Tears coat your lifeless eyes with dew  
Visions in blue  
Visions in blue  
Ashes of memories still aglow  
Portraits and pictures you once saw  
Ashes of memories still aglow  
Portraits and pictures you once saw  
Ashes of memories still aglow  
Portraits and pictures you once saw  
Face in the window in the night  
Caught for a second by the light  
Ashes of memories still aglow  
Only for you  
Portraits and pictures you once saw  
Visions in blue
