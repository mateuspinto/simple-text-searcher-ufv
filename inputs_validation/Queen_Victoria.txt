Queen Victoria  
My father and all his tobacco loved you  
I love you too in all your forms  
The slim and lovely virgin floating among German beer  
The mean governess of the huge pink maps  
The solitary mourner of a prince  
  
Queen Victoria  
I am cold and rainy  
I am dirty as a glass roof in a train station  
I feel like an empty cast iron exhibition  
I want ornaments on everything  
Because my love she gone with other boys  
  
Queen Victoria  
Do you have a punishment under the white lace  
Will you be short with her will you make her read those little Bibles  
Will you spank her with a mechanical corset  
I want her pure as power I want her skin slightly musty with petticoats  
Will you wash the easy bidet out of her head  
  
Queen Victoria  
Im not much nourished by modern love  
Will you come into my life  
With your sorrow and your black carriages  
And your perfect  
Memories  
  
Queen Victoria  
The Twentieth Century belongs to you and me  
Let us be two severe giants not less lonely for our partnership  
Who discolor test tubes in the halls of Science  
Who turn up unwelcome at every Worlds Fair  
Heavy with proverbs and corrections  
Confusing the stardazed tourists  
With our incomparable sense of loss
