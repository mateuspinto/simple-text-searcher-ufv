There were beverages laid out for the party  
There were candy and spices and tricolored pastas  
The meat carved was drawn from succulent juices  
Served on platters of the purest gold  
I was calm when we arrived at the party  
I spoke with fervor embracing the evening  
My wife leaned over and she whispered I love you  
I held her close  we danced  
We had the best time at your party  
The wife and I thank you very much  
We had the best time at your party  
The wife and I thank you very much  
Creampuffs and bourbon and the music was louder  
My wife was competing in a game of chance  
The party raged and the guests were screaming  
I could have danced all night  
We had the best time at your party  
The wife and I thank you very much  
We had the best time at your party  
The wife and I thank you very much  
Later on when we were under the covers  
I closed my eyes then I drifted to sleep  
I dreamt about me maybe throwing a party  
And just how great that would be  
And we said  
We had the best time at your party  
The wife and I thank you very much  
We had the best time at your party  
The wife and I thank you very much
