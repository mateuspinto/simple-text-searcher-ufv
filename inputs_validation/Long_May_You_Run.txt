Weve been through some things together  
With trunks of memories still to come  
We found things to do in stormy weather  
Long may you run  
Long may you run  
Long may you run  
Although these changes have come  
With your chrome heart shining in the sun  
Long may you run  
Well it was back in Blind River in 1962  
When I last saw you alive  
Rollin down that empty ocean road  
Gettin to the surf on time  
Long may you run  
Long may you run  
Although these changes have come  
With your chrome heart shining in the sun  
Long may you run  
Long may you run  
Long may you run  
Although these changes have come  
With your chrome heart shining in the sun  
Long may you run
