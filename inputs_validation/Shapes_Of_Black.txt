Im dressed in black with my stick and hat  
So this is the end where it all will begin  
Shapes Of Black on the floor  
Shapes Of Black behind every door  
They keep sucking on the light until  
There is no more light to find in here  
Hello reality goodbye to my sanity  
Shapes Of Black on my bed  
Shapes Of Black all around my head  
Shhhhhh THEY are here  
Can you hear THEM breathe Listen  
Theres a spider on the wall  
Watching shadows as THEY crawl  
Is the Darkness the only way for the other side to enter our life  
AhAhAh I see THEM AhAhAh I feel THEM  
AhAhAh I see THEM AhAhAh I feel THEM  
Closer and closer Human shapes made from the Dark  
I see a black moth fighting for its life  
In the flame of the last candle that I have  
Solo  Mike  
Shhhhhh One of THEM is really close Can you feel it  
Can you hear it  
Shapes Of Black on my bed  
Shapes Of Black all around my head  
Solo  Andy  
Shapes Of Black THEY try to kill my flame  
Shapes Of Black Ah THEYre driving me insane  
So little time So little light So little time Light  
Phhhh No more light
