Hot Aww  
  
You can keep your black tongue  
Well I found at the mortuary  
You know Im gonna want some want some  
Well hide in the back room gonna have a packed suit  
With this you will regret  
Just let it be your yeah yeah yeah  
  
Sonny kept his ring on  
Red tape so ordinary  
Love I feel like it was gone gone gone gone  
Lets do this like a prison break  
I want to see you scream and shake  
  
Chorus  
Boy you just a stupid bitch  
And girl you just a no good dick  
  
Hot  
  
Were gonna keep it in the family  
Yeah well even though were on the run  
You know theyre gonna want some want some  
Well hide in the back room gonna have a packed suit  
With this you will regret  
Just let it be your yeah yeah yeah  
  
Chorus
