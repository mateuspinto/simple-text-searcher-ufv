Sit down girl beside me  
Come tell me bout your lights  
Got so much to talk about  
Yeah we could stay out all night  
Long time ago we were lovers  
Like no one ever knew  
Long time ago  
Your face was falling out of view  
Haunting me  
I used to say that you were haunting me  
Haunting me  
You know your memory was haunting me  
Now when Im looking at you  
I see more than just a pretty face  
Well I say I want you with me girl  
Because no one could take your place  
Long time ago we were too free  
And easy to fool  
Long time ago we thought  
That the fire would cool
