Words a simple song  
A minstrel sings  
A way of life in his eyes  
Hear the morning call of waking birds  
When they are singing bringing  
Love  love  
Everywhere love is all around  
Everywhere love is all around  
  
Now the winters gone  
Cold wind has blown  
The endless stream in our lives  
Where the minstrel sings  
This simple song  
Hes always bringing singing  
Love  love  
Everywhere love is all around  
Everywhere love is all around  
  
Listen to the one  
Who sings of love  
Follow our friend  
Our wandering friend  
Listen to the one  
Who sings of love  
Everywhere love is around  
Around around  
  
Here the nations sing  
Our minstrels song  
As he walks by in their lives  
Soon the spring will come  
And everyone will all be singing bringing  
Love  love  
Everywhere love is all around  
Everywhere love is all around  
  
Listen to the one  
Who sings of love  
Follow our friend  
Our wandering friend  
Listen to the one  
Who sings of love  
Everywhere love is around  
Around around
