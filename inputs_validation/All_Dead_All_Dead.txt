She came without a farthing  
A babe without a name  
So much ado bout nothing  
Is what shed try to say  
So much ado my lover  
So many games we played  
Through every fleeted summer  
Through every precious day  
  
All dead all dead  
All the dreams we had  
And I wonder why I still live on  
All dead all dead  
And alone Im spared  
My sweeter half instead  
All dead  
And gone  
All dead  
  
All dead all dead  
At the rainbows end  
And still I hear her own sweet song  
All dead all dead  
Take me back again  
You know my little friends  
All dead  
And gone  
  
Her ways are always with me  
I wander all the while  
But please you must forgive me  
I am old but still a child  
  
All dead all dead  
But I should not grieve  
In time it comes to everyone  
All dead all dead  
But in hope I breathe  
Of course I dont believe  
Youre dead  
And gone  
All dead  
And gone
