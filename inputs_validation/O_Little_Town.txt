O little town of Bethlehem  
How still we see thee lie  
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep  
The silent stars go by  
Yet in thy dark streets shineth  
The everlasting light  
The hopes and fears of all the years  
Are met in thee tonight  
  
How silently how silently  
The wondrous gift is given  
So God imparts to human hearts  
The blessings of His heaven  
We hear the Christmas angels  
The great glad tidings tell  
O come to us abide with us  
Our Lord Emmanuel  
  
No ear may hear his coming  
But in this world of sin  
Where meek souls will receive Him  
Still the dear Christ enters in
