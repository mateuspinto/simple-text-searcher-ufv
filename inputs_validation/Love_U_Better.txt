Verse  
This is hard to say I wanna make sure I go about this in the right way  
cause lately I been busy a lot  
And I know you dont feel appreciated and what not  
I used to tell you that youre hair looked fly  
Kiss you slow and stare in your eyes  
Now I talk real foul and slick  
Every other sentence is You make me sick  
Back in the days I was your number one pick  
Now your hearts hairbroken and thats hard to fix  
I had to dig deep inside myself  
cause I cant see you bouncin with somebody else  
Its a long journey back to the place we was  
When I was too embarrassed to admit I was in love  
And you was my good girl that wouldnt give it up  
I cant let us selfdestruct

Im gon love you better  
When your friendsll see you too  
Just when you think theres nothin else I can do

Verse 2  
When I think about the things we did  
And I think about you having my kids  
And I think about us sharing a crib  
Losin all that God forbid  
You deserve flowers and candy the simple things  
In addition to the sls baguettes and rings  
Instead I walk around like Im a king  
And having you aint nothing but a thing  
I even stopped tellin you the lovin was good  
Too busy frontin in the hood Baby girl hold me tight dont ever let go  
Ima do it real gentle baby nice and slow One more chance baby and dont say
no  
cause I got another side to show  
Some say love is painful it helps you grow Well its time for the pain to go
yaknow
