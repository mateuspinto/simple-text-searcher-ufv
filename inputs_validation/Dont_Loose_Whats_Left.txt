I am The Count this is my song  
A coffee a burger you cant go wrong  
  
Rock me Daddio  
Rock it  
  
I am The Count and I love to wear silk stockings on my head  
  
Sing it my pretty sing  
  
Hip hop be bop  
  
I am The Count this is my song  
A coffee a burger just sing along  
  
Rock it  
  
Take it to the bridge take it up up up up  
  
Transylvania  
  
Our chance living in the mystical powers  
Instead I am here alone a bird in a cage  
I will spread my wings and head home  
  
Transylvania  
  
Sock it to me baby  
  
Burger burger  
  
One coffee two burgers three ham and cheese burgers  
And one chicken sandwich  
Poor on the mayo pass me the relish  
Some more onion rings
