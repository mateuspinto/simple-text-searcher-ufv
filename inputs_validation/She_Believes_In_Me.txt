While she lays sleeping I stay out late at night and play my songs  
And sometimes all the nights can be so long  
And its good when I finally make it home all alone  
While she lays dreaming I try to get undressed without the light  
And quietly she says how was your night  
And I come to her and say it was all right and I hold her tight  
  
Chorus  
And she believes in me Ill never know just what she sees in me  
I told her someday if she was my girl I could change the world  
With my little songs I was wrong  
But she has faith in me and so I go on trying faithfully  
And who knows maybe on some special night if my song is right  
I will find a way find a way  
  
While she lays waiting I stumble to the kitchen for a bite  
Then I see my old guitar in the night  
Just waiting for me like a secret friend and theres no end  
While she lays crying I fumble with a melody or two  
And Im torn between the things that I should do  
And she says to wake her up when I am through God her love is true  
  
Chorus
