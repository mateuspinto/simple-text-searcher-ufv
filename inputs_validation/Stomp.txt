Lately Ive been going through some things  
Thats really got me down  
I need someone somebody to help me come and  
Turn my life around  
  
I cant explain it  
I cant obtain it  
Jesus Your love is so  
Its so amazing  
  
It gets me high up to the sky and when  
I think about Your goodness it makes me want to  
Stomp  
Makes me clap my hands  
  
Makes me want to dance and Stomp  
My brother cant you see Ive got the victory  
Stomp  
Oh oh oh oh Stomp on the enemy cause Ive got the victory  
  
Stomp on the enemy cause Ive got the victory
