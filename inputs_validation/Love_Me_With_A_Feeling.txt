Rose All right we all turn to page 438  
Now you know we all gonna sing along  
Oh I do love a revue  
  
Ohhhhhh  
You know women dont like this woman  
cause I always speak my mind  
But the men aint crazy about me  
cause I love to take my time  
  
If youre gonna love this woman  
Gotta love me with a thrill  
cause baby if you dont  
I gotta find a man who will  
  
Love me with a feeling  
You got to love me with a feelin  
You got to love me with a feelin  
Or you dont love me at all  
  
You know Im the kind of woman  
I dont want no halfway stuff  
If youre gonna turn me loose baby  
Be sure I had enough  
  
You know the cops once took me in  
But I did not need the bail  
I just shook it for the judge and he  
He put that cop in jail  
  
You got to love me with a feeling  
You got to love me with a feelin  
You got to love me with a feelin  
Or you dont love me at all  
  
All right Milledge this ones for you  
There was one cat who could not make it  
And Milledge was his name  
The only cat I ever knew  
Who left before he came  
  
There hes astanding  
Drinkin pop from a paper cup  
But when its time for gettin down  
Milledge can not get it up  
  
You gotta love me with a feelin  
Yeah love love me with a feelin  
You got to love me with a feelin  
Or you cant love me at all
