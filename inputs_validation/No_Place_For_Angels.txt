Bonus track  
  
You must seduce me the ties with fire  
My one addiction your sweet desire  
Is living in a world of hate and dreams  
Standing at the end of time  
We had paradise but that was lost  
Forever to mankind  
  
No place for angels for you and me  
No place for angels Im lost in your reality  
And life seems so unreal  
  
I feel the madness the Jesus liar  
The one creation obsessed by fire  
Well living in a world of hate and dreams  
Standing at the end of time  
We had paradise but that was lost  
Forever to mankind  
  
No place for angels for you and me  
No place for angels Im lost in your reality  
And life seems so unreal  
  
You may think that Im just a crazy guy  
And I wear the madman masks  
Do I live my life in a fake disguise  
Is my world nonfiction yeah
