Once we were lovers just lovers we were  
Oh what a life  
Once we were dreamers just dreamers we were  
Oh you and I  
Now I see youre just somebody who wastes all my time and money  
What a lie you and I  
  
Chorus  
What about your  
Your 10000 promises  
That you gave to me  
Your 10000 promises  
That you promised me  
  
Once I could handle the truth  
When the truth was you and I  
But time after time all the  
Promises turned out to be all lies  
Now I see Im just somebody who wasted my time and money  
What a lie what a lie what a lie oh  
You and I  
  
Chorus  
  
You said Ill take you back  
But I closed the door cause I dont want  
10000 more  
Oh  
  
10000 promises yeah oh  
10000 promises you gave to me  
  
Repeat chorus  
What about your 10000 promises  
You gave to me That you gave to me  
What about your 10000 promises  
You gave to me  
Once we were lovers just lovers we were  
Oh you and I  
What a lie
