The summer wind came blowin in  
From across the sea  
It lingered there touched your hair  
And walked with me  
  
All summer long  
We sang a song  
And then we strolled on golden sand  
Two sweethearts  
And the summer wind  
  
Like painted kites those days and nights  
Went flying by  
The world was new  
Beneath the bright blue  
Umbrella sky  
  
Then softer than  
A piper man  
One day it called to you  
I lost you to  
The summer wind  
  
The autumn wind  
And the winter wind  
They have come and gone  
But still those days  
Those lonely days  
Go on and on  
And guess who sighs his lullabies  
Through nights that never end  
My fickle friend  
The summer wind  
  
Umm That summer wind  
Warm warm summer wind  
Umm That summer wind
