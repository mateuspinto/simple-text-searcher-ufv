Down among the reeds and rushes  
A baby boy was found  
His eyes as clear as centuries  
His silky hair was brown  
  
Never been lonely  
Never been lied to  
Never had to scuffle in fear  
Nothing denied to  
Born at the instant  
The church bells chime  
And the whole world whispering  
Born at the right time  
  
Me and my buddies we are traveling people  
We like to go down to restaurant row  
Spend those Eurodollars  
All the way from Washington to Tokyo  
I see them in the airport lounge  
Upon their mothers breast  
They follow me with open eyes  
Their uninvited guest  
  
Never been lonely  
Never been lied to  
Never had to scuffle in fear  
Nothing denied to  
Born at the instant  
The church bells chime  
And the whole world whispering  
Born at the right time  
  
Too many people on the bus from the airport  
Too many holes in the crust of the earth  
The planet groans  
Every time it registers another birth  
  
But down among the reeds and rushes  
A baby girl was found  
Her eyes as clear as centuries  
Her silky hair was brown  
  
Never been lonely  
Never been lied to  
Never had to scuffle in fear  
Nothing denied to  
Born at the instant  
The church bells chime  
And the whole world whispering  
Born at the right time
