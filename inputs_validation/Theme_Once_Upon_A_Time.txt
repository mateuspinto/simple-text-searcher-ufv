Voice monologue over Once Upon A Time instrumental  
  
Once upon a time there was a girl  
She lived in the land of nevernever  
Where everything real is unreal  
And only fairy tales come true  
Something like me and you  
  
But she believed that what she dreamed of could be real  
So she strived on to make it come true  
Fighting odds not knowing what would come of her  
Never giving up the hope within her  
  
She carried on and on because she believed  
That once once in a time in her lifetime  
The things so unreal would be real  
  
And in the morning one day when she awoke  
To find herself surrounded by the same old room  
She was disappointed  
  
So she dreamed and she dreamed  
And she dreamed and she dreamed and she dreamed  
And she said that fairy tales do come true  
cause I believe I believe  
  
And she kept trying and she kept right on fighting  
Till one day she met a man who held her tight  
And she fell in love  
  
Once upon a time in the land of nevernever  
Where all things real are unreal  
There lived a girl who believed  
That all things could be possible  
  
And one day she did awake  
And found herself somewhere else  
Beside her a brand new face  
Of someone that she loved
