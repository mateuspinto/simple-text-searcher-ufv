Jet Jet  
Jet I can almost remember their funny faces  
That time you told them you were going to marrying soon  
And Jet I thought the only lonely place was the moon  
  
Jet Jet Jet  
  
Jet was your father as bold as the sergeant major  
How come he told you that you were hardly old enough yet  
And Jet I thought the major was a lady suffragette  
  
Jet Jet Jet  
  
Ah Mater want Jet to always love me  
Ah Mater want Jet to always love me  
Ah Mater much later  
Jet  
  
And Jet I thought the major was a lady suffragette  
Jet Jet  
  
Ah Mater want Jet to always love me  
Ah Mater want Jet to always love me  
Ah Matermuch later  
  
Jet with the wind in your hair  
Of a thousand laces  
Climb on the back and well go for a ride in the sky  
And Jet I thought the major was a little lady suffragette

And Jet you know I thought you was a little lady suffragette  
Jet  
A little lady  
My little lady yes
