Its night again  
Time for my mind to go wandering  
Off on a journey through space and time  
In search of a face I can never find  
So I close my eyes and look inside  
  
I cant forget  
The night that I saw her we never met  
She felt so close to me as I reached for her hand  
She drifted away like the desert sand  
It was her and she was gone  
  
I wish shed come back tonight  
Like a star shining bright  
I dont know where shes from  
  
Shes like a girl on the moon  
A girl on the moon  
Shes like a girl on the moon  
A girl on the moon  
  
Yeah its night once again  
And that same old feeling is setting in  
It all seems so familiar but I hope this time  
That the girl on the moon will soon be mine  
All mine tonight  
  
Am I asking too much  
Should I leave my dream untouched  
Should I even know where shes from  
  
My girl on the moon  
Shes my girl on the moon  
Girl on the moon  
My girl on the moon  
Girl on the moon  
My girl on the moon  
Girl on the moon  
Girl on the moon  
Girl on the moon  
Fille sur la lune  
Girl on the moon  
Fille sur la lune
