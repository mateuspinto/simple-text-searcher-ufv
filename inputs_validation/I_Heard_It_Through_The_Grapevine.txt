I bet youre wonderin how I knew  
Bout your plans to make me blue  
With some other guy you knew before  
Between the two of us guys  
You know I loved you more  
It took me by surprise I must say  
When I found out yesterday  
Dont you know that I heard it through the grapevine  
Not much longer would you be mine  
Oh I heard it through the grapevine  
Oh Im just about to lose my mind  
  
Honey honey yeah  
I heard it through the grapevine  
Not much longer would you be mine baby  
  
I know a man aint supposed to cry  
But these tears I cant hold inside  
Losin you would end my life you see  
Cause you mean that much to me  
You could have told me yourself  
That you loved some one else  
Instead I heard it through the grapevine  
Not much longer would you be mine  
Oh I heard it through the grapevine  
And Im just about to lose my mind  
  
Honey honey yeah  
I heard it through the grapevine  
Not much longer would you be mine baby  
  
People say believe half of what you see  
Son and none of what you hear  
But I cant help but be confused  
If its true please tell me dear  
Do you plan to let me go  
For the other guy you loved before  
  
Dont you know I heard it through the grapevine  
Not much longer would you be mine baby yeah  
I heard it through the grapevine  
Im just about to love my mind  
Honey honey yeah  
I heard it through the grapevine  
Not much longer would you be mine baby yeah
