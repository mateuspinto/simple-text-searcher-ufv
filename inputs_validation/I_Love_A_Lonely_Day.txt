TVs off at 1 am  
One more day alone again  
The work gets longer every day  
Whyd I have to get away  
But I have found a comfort here  
Solitude can be so dear  
Loneliness is not so blue  
When it puts my mind on you  
I love a lonely day  
I love a lonely day  
It makes me think of you  
I love a lonely day  
All alone I can easily find your love I love  
I love a lonely day  
I love a lonely day  
It chases me to you  
I love a lonely day  
It clears my heart  
Lets my very best part shine through its you  
Lonely people everywhere  
Lucky lonely ones who care  
Youve got all you need and more  
Someone to be lonely for  
Someone cries for you to hear  
Take your heart and wipe that tear  
Give them someone they can miss  
Give them love and sing them this  
I love a lonely day  
I love a lonely day  
It makes me think of you  
I love a lonely day  
All alone I can easily find your love I love  
I love a lonely day  
I love a lonely day  
It chases me to you  
I love a lonely day  
It clears my heart  
Lets my very best part shine through oh its you  
I love a lonely day  
I love a lonely day  
It makes me think of you  
I love a lonely day  
All alone I can easily find your love I love  
I love a lonely day  
I love a lonely day  
It chases me to you  
I love a lonely day
