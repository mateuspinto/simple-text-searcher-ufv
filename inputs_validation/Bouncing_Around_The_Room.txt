The woman was a dream I had  
Though rather hard to keep  
For when my eyes were watching hers they closed and I was still asleep  
  
For when my hand was holding hers  
She whispered words and I awoke  
  
And faintly bouncing round the room  
The echo of whomever spoke  
And I awoke and faintly bouncing round the room  
The echo of whomever spoke  
  
The place I sought was far beneath the surface of the sea  
My sight was poor but I was sure  
The sirens sang their song for me  
  
They dance above me as I sink  
I see them through a crystal haze  
And hear the sweet sound bouncing round  
The neverending coral maze  
The crystal haze  
And hear the bouncing round the room  
The neverending coral maze  
  
Then before and now once more Im bouncing round the room  
That time then and once again Im bouncing round the room  
That time then and once again Im bouncing round the room  
That time then and once again Im bouncing round the room  
That time then and once again Im bouncing round the room cont  
  
And I awoke faintly bouncing round the room  
The echo of whomever spoke  
And I awoke faintly bouncing round the room  
The echo of whomever spoke  
And I awoke faintly bouncing round the room  
The echo of whomever spoke
