I think of all the times I needed you  
And you would come to me cause you wanted too  
And we built the fire that would last through the night  
Still be burnin in the morning light  
  
Oh it must have had a thousand ways  
Of takin our breath away  
We took a chance or two didnt we  
And made some mountains move oh didnt we  
  
From out of the blue storm clouds came  
And it started rainin we just let it rain  
Oh it mustve been a careless love  
Oh it had to be a careless love  
Satin sheets and no regrets  
We had it baby we had the best didnt we  
  
And every now and then  
I let my feelings show  
And though takes me a while  
Just to let you go  
Cause you were more than a lover  
And more than a friend  
Never before and never again  
  
Oh it mustve been  
  
Oh it ought to be you and me  
Oh we had a good didnt we  
Didnt we didnt we
