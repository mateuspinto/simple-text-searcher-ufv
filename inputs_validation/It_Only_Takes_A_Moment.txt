Cornelius  
It only takes a moment  
For your eyes to meet and then  
Your heart knows in a moment  
You will never be alone again  
I held her for an instant  
But my arms felt sure and strong  
It only takes a moment  
To be loved a whole life long  
Clerk  
I missed a few words back there Mr Hackl  
Right after it only  
  
All in docket  
Takes a moment  
But his arms felt sure and strong  
It only takes a moment  
  
Mrs Molloy  
He held me for an instant  
But his arms felt safe and strong  
It only takes a moment  
To be loved a whole life long  
  
Cornelius  
And that is all  
That loves about  
  
Mrs Molloy  
And well recall when time runs out  
  
Both  
That it only took a moment  
To be loved a whole life long
