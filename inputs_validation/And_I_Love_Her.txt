I give her all my love  
Thats all I do  
And if you saw my love  
Youd love her too  
I love her  
  
She gives me everything  
And tenderly  
The kiss my lover brings  
She brings to me  
And I love her  
  
A love like ours  
Could never die  
As long as I  
Have you near me  
  
Bright are the stars that shine  
Dark is the sky  
I know this love of mine  
Will never die  
And I love her  
  
Bright are the stars that shine  
Dark is the sky  
I know this love of mine  
Will never die  
And I love her
