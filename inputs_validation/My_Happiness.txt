Evening shadows make me blue  
When each weary day is through  
How I long to be with you  
My happiness  
  
Every day I reminisce  
Dreaming of your tender kiss  
Always thinking how I miss  
My happiness  
  
A million years it seems  
Have gone by since we shared our dreams  
But Ill hold you again  
Therell be no blue memories then  
  
Whether skies are gray or blue  
Any place on earth will do  
Just as long as Im with you  
My happiness
