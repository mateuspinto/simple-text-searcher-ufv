The child is a king the carolers sing  
The old has passed theres a new beginning  
Dreams of Santa dreams of snow  
Fingers numb faces aglow  
  
Christmas time mistletoe and wine  
Children singing Christian rhyme  
With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree  
A time for rejoicing in all that we see  
  
A time for living a time for believing  
A time for trusting not deceiving  
Love and laughter and joy ever after  
Ours for the taking just follow the master  
  
Christmas time mistletoe and wine  
Children singing Christian rhyme  
With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree  
A time to rejoice in the good that we see  
  
A time for giving a time for getting  
A time for forgiving and for forgetting  
Christmas is love Christmas is peace  
A time for hating and fighting to cease  
  
Christmas time mistletoe and wine  
Children singing Christian rhyme  
With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree  
A time to rejoice in the good that we see  
  
Silent night  
Holy night
