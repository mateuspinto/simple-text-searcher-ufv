Verse 1 Jeremih  
I dont want no drama  
I just wanna be your diamond babe  
Guaranteed to be a problem  
Every time I get around you babe  
I just want you to need me  
You might really wanna try me babe  
All I know I want a rider  
All I know I want a rider babe  
You know that you need a rider  
You know that you need a rider babe  
You know that you need a rider  
You know that you need a rider babe ah yeah  
  
Verse 2 Nicki Minaj  
Yo I just wanna be ya rider  
You should pull up in that Spider  
You should let me hit the mic  
And I aint talking about the fighter  
Get it lit without a lighter  
Lets pull an allnighter  
Tell metell me what you need got the weed  
Im a bad lil bitch and I never indict her  
Get locked Imma write ya  
You on the road Imma Skype ya  
I dont wanna hype ya  
But you a lucky nigga if my mean ass like ya  
You aint never have a bitch understand you  
Most of them wanna use you when they ran through  
I just wanna be somebody that can add to  
Your wife be a friend be a teacher and a fan too  
I just wanna listen  
When you leave I say damn I fucking miss him  
I just wanna be your vixen  
Give you something real wet to put your lips in  
I wanna be the only one that can check you and still respect you  
Cause its you I would change for you always make sure

Verse 3 Nicki Minaj  
Ayo I just wanna be your first go to  
Treat me like a real one sposed to livin bicoastal  
Scoop me in the truck late night wanna humble  
Meet me out in Queens where the city want a sundown  
You could put your gun down you could have fun now  
You could tell you niggas that you won now one down  
Run through the clubs with the baddest  
Bitches is the maddest nothin else matters  
And if they workin where the bag is  
Gotta lot of bags but we never got baggage  
Went to Wonderland on my hands call me Alice balance  
Imma have you coming in my palace  
London Tokyo Paris let me update your status  
Cause its you I would change for you always make sure
