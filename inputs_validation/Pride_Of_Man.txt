Turn around  
Go back down  
Back the way you came  
Cant you see that flash of fire ten times brighter than the day  
  
And behold a mighty city broken in the dust again  
Oh God Pride of Man broken in the dust again  
Turn around  
Go back down  
  
Back the way you came  
Babylon is laid to waste Egypts buried in her shame  
The mighty men are all beaten down their kings are fallen in the ways  
Oh God Pride of Man broken in the dust again  
  
Turn around  
Go back down  
Back the way you came  
Terror is on every side lo our leaders are dismayed  
  
For theose who place their faith in fire their faith in fire shall be  
Repayed  
Oh God Pride of Man broken in the dust again  
Turn around  
  
Go back down  
Back the way you came  
And shout a warning unto the nation that the sword of God is raised  
Yes Babylon that mighty city rich in treasures wide in fame  
  
Oh God Pride of Man broken in the dust again  
The meek shall cause your tower to fall make a new pyre of flame  
Oh you who dwell on many waters rich in treasures wide in fame  
You bow unto your God of gold your pride of might shall be a shame  
  
For only God can lead His people back unto the Earth again  
Oh God Pride of Man broken in the dust again  
A Holy mountain be restored and mercy on that people that people
