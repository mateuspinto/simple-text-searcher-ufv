We walk on every city street  
We walk in lanes where branches meet  
And stars send down their blessings from the blue  
We go through storms of doubt and fear  
And so we walk from year to year  
Believing in each other as we do  
Bravely marching forward two by two  
  
Boys and girls like you and me  
Walk beneath the skies  
They love just as we love  
With the same dream in their eyes  
Songs and kings and many things  
Have their day and are gone  
But boys and girls like you and me  
We go on and on  
  
Songs and kings and many things  
Have their day and are gone  
But boys and girls like you and me  
We go on and on
