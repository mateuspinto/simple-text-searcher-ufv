He the type to pop tags and be cockin the brim  
Might breeze through the Ave might stop at the gym  
And he keep a du rag keep the wave on swim  
Wa waves on swim so they hate on him  
Anyway I think I met him sometime before  
In a different life or where I record  
I mean he was Adam I think I was Eve  
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree  
S on my chest cause Im ready to save him  
Ready to get buck on anybody that plays him  
And I think I love em I love em jus like I raised him  
When he call me momma lil momma I call him baby

He they type to keep a couple hundred grand in the rubber band  
Just left money gram in the lemon Lam  
Hot damn make me scream like summer jam  
I mean that nigga must be from the motherland  
Anyway I think I met him in the sky  
When I was a geisha he was a samurai  
Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai  
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly  
S on my chest lemme get my cape on  
Hes so thugged out Ghostface and Raekwon  
Konvict just like Akon  
Cause you know snitches be puttin the Jake on

Your love your love your love  
Baby your the illest illest illest  
Your love love love
