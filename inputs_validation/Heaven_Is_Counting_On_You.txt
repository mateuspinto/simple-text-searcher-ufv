Heaven is counting on you  
Run with a heart that is true  
Carry the cross reaching the lost  
Heaven is counting on you  
We are standing at the end of time  
We are part of a grand design  
We are grateful to a risen Lord  
For the others who have gone before  
I hear voices in the heavenlies  
They are calling to you and me  
Saying rise up theres a world to win  
I hear them saying again  
Heaven is counting on you  
Run with a heart that is true  
Carry the cross reaching the lost  
Heaven is counting on you  
Many suffered even gave their lives  
For the message of the risen Christ  
Now theyre watching seated high above  
Shouting to us as we run  
Heaven is counting on you  
Run with a heart that is true  
Carry the cross reaching the lost  
Heaven is counting on you  
There is a race there is a prize  
There is a price to pay  
And the saints beyond  
Cheer us on today  
Heaven is counting on you  
Run with a heart that is true  
Carry the cross reaching the lost  
Heaven is counting on you
