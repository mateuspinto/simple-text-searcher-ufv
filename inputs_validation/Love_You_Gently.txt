First see the city sky lights  
Shining from my room  
Your such a sight to see  
In the month of June  
Beautiful like the moons  
Reflection when its passing off your skin  
And before you let me in I hear you say  
  
Its been a long time  
I say OK k k k  
Dont worry I got you  
Then you say  
How bout some foreplay  
I got that got plenty  
I got you  
Then you say  
Play some slow whine  
Got that Sade Al Green and Marvin Gaye to  
  
To love you gently  
Let me love you gently  
  
Lay back relax  
Girl Ima be  
Light as a feather  
Hard as a rock  
Cause daddy know just what you like  
  
Gonna love you  
Gently  
Light as a feather  
But hard as a rock  
  
See I know just when to finish  
And I know just wen to start  
And I be lovin your reaction  
Every time I hit that spot  
Gently but its soft like leather  
Gently but the top is hard  
Whisper your pleasures  
And then do my job  
  
Make it rain intense  
Girl let me do what I do  
I dont know whats echoing louder  
The music or you  
  
Gently I supposed to be done yet  
But you gettin real warm  
Like the comin of thunder  
Right after the storm  
  
You say you say  
Do you say girl  
  
Gonna push you to the limit  
Its yours its yours  
See I can place and win the race  
Ima be your number one  
To the sunshine  
  
Here comes the sun  
Lets try to touch the moon again  
Forevermore  
  
Let me touch you  
Gently thats the sound of love  
Take them shades off the wall  
Light as feather  
But hard as rock  
  
This might not be in the bedroom  
But Ima love you girl  
Gently  
Light as a feather  
But hard a s rock  
  
Let me touch you  
Gently  
Light as a feather  
But hard as a rock  
  
Gonna love you  
Gently  
Light as a feather  
But hard as a rock  
  
Can you feel me girl  
Hey  
  
We dont need no room  
All we need is me and you  
Want to love you
