If youd only realize  
Id been happy with you once before  
Cant you let it be the same and more  
Without you fighting me fighting me  
  
If you could only look into my eyes  
Then you would see the truth within them lies  
That I am trying hard to bring us back together  
  
You try so hard to complicate our love  
But underneath it all its pride my love  
Thats hurting us and keeping us apart  
  
Chorus x2  
I start to wonder if its worth it all  
But then I look at you and start to fall  
In love again like every time before  
In love again like every time before  
In love again like every time before
