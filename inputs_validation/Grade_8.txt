My mind is a warrior  
My heart is a foreigner  
My eyes are the color of red like the sunset  
Ill never keep it bottled up  
Left to the hands of the coroner  
Be a true heart not a follower  
Were not done yet now  
I see it in your movements tonight  
If we can ever do this right  
Im never gonna let you down  
Oh Ill never let you down  
Now keep it on the down low  
And Ill keep you around so Ill know  
That Ill never let you down  
Ill never let you down  
  
Youre strumming on my heart strings  
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way  
Ill pick your feet up off of the ground  
And never ever let you down  
Youre strumming on my heart strings  
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way  
Ill pick your feet up off of the ground  
And never ever let you down  
  
My eyes are a river filler  
This drink is a liver killer  
My chest is a pillow for my weary head to lay to rest again  
Your body is my ballpoint pen  
  
And your mind is my new best friend  
Your eyes are my mirror to take me to the edge again  
Now I see it in your movements tonight  
If we should ever do this right  
Im never gonna let you down  
Oh Ill never let you down  
Well keep it on the down low  
And Ill keep you around so Ill know  
That Ill never let you down  
Ill never let you down  
  
Youre strumming on my heart strings  
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way  
Ill pick your feet up off of the ground  
And never ever let you down  
  
Youre strumming on my heart strings  
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way  
Ill pick your feet up off of the ground  
And never ever let you down  
  
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now now now  
And Ill never let you down  
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now now now  
And Ill never let you down  
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now now now  
And Ill never let you down  
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now now now  
And Ill never let you down  
  
Youre strumming on my heart strings  
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way  
Ill pick your feet up off of the ground  
And never ever let you down  
  
Youre strumming on my heart strings  
Like you were a grade eight but I never felt this way  
Ill pick your feet up off of the ground  
And never ever let you down
