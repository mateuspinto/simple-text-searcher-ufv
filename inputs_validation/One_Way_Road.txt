I want to get high but I never could take the pain  
Cause it would blow away my soul like a hurricane  
Like a one man band clapping in the pouring rain  
If I know where Im going I dont know from where I came  
  
Where we gonna be in summertime  
And are we gonna see the heavens shine  
Like diamonds in the sky  
  
As soon as they come  
The feelings they go  
All alone on a one way road  
  
As soon as they come  
The feelings they go  
All alone on a one way road  
  
I want to get high but I really cant take the pain  
cause it will blow away my soul like a hurricane  
Im like a one man band clapping in the pouring rain  
If I know where Im going I dont know from where I came  
  
Where we gonna be in summertime  
And are we gonna see the heavens shine  
Like diamonds in the sky  
  
As soon as they come  
The feelings they go  
All alone on a one way road  
  
As soon as they come  
The feelings they go  
All alone on a one way road
