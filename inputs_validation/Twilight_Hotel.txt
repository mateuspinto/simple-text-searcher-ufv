Midnight masquerade  
Innocent fantasies  
Never ended from room to room  
Dressed up for sharades  
Every guest has a part to play  
And the rules are understood  
Undercover  
A secret rendezvous  
They wont discover  
That its me and its you  
At the Twilight Hotel  
Check your soul at the door  
Theyve got memories to sell  
And so much more  
Last call at the bar  
Fast talkin it promises  
Never really reaching the lines  
Seems to bizarre  
Such a twisted reality  
This place full of manic minds  
Its like a dreamland  
With time standing still  
So make your big plans  
Theyve got all the frills  
At the Twilight Hotel  
Check your soul at the door  
Theyve got memories to sell  
And so much more  
In the Twilight Hotel  
Price of life still like gold  
Its a twilight magic spell  
And anything goes  
Undercover  
A secret rendezvous  
They wont discover  
That its me and its you  
At the Twilight Hotel  
Check your soul at the door  
Theyve got memories to sell  
And so much more  
In the Twilight Hotel  
Price of life still like gold  
Its a twilight magic spell  
And anything goes
