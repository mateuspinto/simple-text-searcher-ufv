Where did you leave your baby  
bleeding in her bed  
Her ghost has come to stay  
Oh you can try you cant chase her away  
In the bar we sit like blackbirds  
with our broken wings  
Like clocks without springs  
Just like time doesnt mean anything  
Wont you tell me  
which way to the top  
Ah so you know that I cant stay down here  
Um ah hey  
Um ah hey  
We used to ride around  
in a broken down old car  
but now Im changing trains  
Oh and Ill hit all the notes in between  
Mom and Dad are fast asleep now  
but Ill be wide awake  
The surfer in the break  
Oh just waiting for the perfect wave  
And a place in the shade  
Wont you tell me  
which way to the top  
Ah so you know that I cant stay down here  
You better get it now  
while the gettings good  
ah now get it now  
while its happening  
Oh  
Get it nowwhile the gettings good  
Get it now while its happening  
Oh yeah  
Wont you tell me  
which way to the top  
Ah so you know that I cant stay down here  
Wont you tell me  
which way to the top  
Ah so you know that I cant stay down here
