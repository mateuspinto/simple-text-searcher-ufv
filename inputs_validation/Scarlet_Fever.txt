I stood outside the Lucky Star  
Staring at the flashing sign  
It read come on in and watch young  
Scarlets body come alive  
Let her dance for you and catch your spell  
Youll swear you can believe her  
Be careful not to catch the scarlet fever  
So I paid my fare and walked down front  
And found an empty chair  
As I settled in young scarlet took the ribbons from her hair  
The moves her body made while the music played  
Were the likes Ive never seen  
And she became the envy of my dreams  
One by one her teasing movements  
Brought the crowd out of their seats  
And all at once young scarlet  
Danced straight up in front of me  
From the moment that her eyes found mine  
Ive never been the same  
Scarlet locked another heart upon her chain  
Now I get scarlet fever every time I see her  
But shes a night club teaser  
Not paid to notice me  
Yes I get scarlet fever  
If she knew how much I need her  
Shed place her hand in my hand  
And dance away with me  
She looked 25 but I was told  
That she was just 16  
She had a way of making a man believe  
She danced for only him  
As she tantalized I fantasized  
And felt the sound of my heart beat  
And every night Id dream  
Shed fall in love with me  
Then one night while driving in  
My eyes begun to tear  
Cause the sign outside the Lucky Star said scarlet isnt here  
shed left that day to find a life  
of bigger and better things  
and she left behind my chain of broken dreams  
But still get scarlet fever  
In my mind I still see her  
Out there dancing somewhere  
To another fool like me  
Yes I get
