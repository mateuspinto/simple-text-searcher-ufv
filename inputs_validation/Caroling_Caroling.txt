Caroling caroling now we go  
Christmas bells are ringing  
Caroling caroling through the snow  
Christmas bells are ringing  
  
Joyous voices sweet and clear  
Sing the sound of heart to cheer  
Ding dong ding dong  
Christmas bells are ringing  
  
Caroling caroling through the town  
Christmas bells are ringing  
Caroling caroling up and down  
Christmas bells are ringing  
  
Harmony  the song we sing  
Gladsome tidings now we bring  
Ding dong ding dong  
Christmas bells are ringing  
  
Caroling caroling near and far  
Christmas bells are ringing  
Following following yonder star  
Christmas bells are ringing  
  
Sing we now this happy morn  
For the king of heaven is born  
Ding dong ding dong  
Christmas bells are ringing  
  
Ding dong ding dong  
Christmas bells are ringing
