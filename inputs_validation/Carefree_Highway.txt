Pickin up the pieces of my sweet shattered dream  
I wonder how the old folks are tonight  
Her name was Ann and Ill be damned if I recall her face  
She left me not knowin what to do  
Carefree highway let me slip away on you  
Carefree highway you seen better days  
The mornin after blues from my head down to my shoes  
Carefree highway let me slip away  
Slip away on you  
Turnin back the pages to the times I love best  
I wonder if shell ever do the same  
Now the thing that I call livin is just bein satisfied  
With knowin I got no one left to blame  
Carefree highway got ta see you my old flame  
Carefree highway you seen better days  
The mornin after blues from my head down to my shoes  
Carefree highway let me slip away  
Slip away on you  
Searchin through the fragments of my dreamshattered sleep  
I wonder if the years have closed her mind  
I guess it must be wanderlust or tryin to get free  
From the good old faithful feelin we once knew  
Carefree highway let me slip away on you  
Carefree highway you seen better days  
The mornin after blues from my head down to my shoes  
Carefree highway let me slip away  
Slip away on you  
Let me slip away on you  
Carefree highway got ta see you my old flame  
Carefree highway you seen better days  
The mornin after blues from my head down to my shoes  
Carefree highway let me slip away  
Slip away on you
