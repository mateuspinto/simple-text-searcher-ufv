In the still of the night  
Lying in the darkness  
I listen to my heart  
Say it isnt true  
In the dark and the quiet  
The movements of my love  
And the breathing of our children  
Say it isnt true  
In the streets and the buildings  
People in their lives  
And the jobs they do for livings  
Say it isnt true  
And when you think of all the people  
In the cities of the worlds  
Who could vanish in a moment  
Say it isnt true  
Say it isnt true  
That there always has been and always will be war  
Say it isnt true  
And apart from all the finer things that men have struggled for  
Say it isnt true  
There always has been and always will be war  
Say it isnt true  
Im alive in the city  
In a country of the world  
And I wanna go on living  
I wanna see my life unfold  
You know its hard to go on looking  
At the stories of our days  
And the dangers we are facing  
Growing worse in every way  
And you would think with all of the genius  
And the brilliance of these times  
We might find a higher purpose  
And a better use of mind  
Say it isnt true  
That there always has been and always will be war  
Say it isnt true  
And apart from all the finer things that men have struggled for  
Say it isnt true  
There always has been and always will be war  
Say it isnt true  
Say it  
Say it isnt
