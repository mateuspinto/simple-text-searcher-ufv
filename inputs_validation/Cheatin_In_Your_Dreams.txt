You see me now as large as life but underneath you knew all too well  
The hollow shell no spark of life  
Where once upon a time there beat a heart  
For you and you knew it from the start and you went and blew it all away  
And you knew how oh you knew best  
The strings to pull and buttons to press  
To wind me up and make me shake you controlling every move I made  
I couldnt see through it all the pain and you put me through it  
Over and over again just tell me over and over and over  
  
Chorus  
How could you say there was no other why is it nothings what it seems  
You told me Im your greatest lover do you even know what that word means  
Your lovin is coolin baby who ya think youre foolin  
cause when I woke up I caught you cheatin in your dreams  
  
When I woke up I caught you cheatin in your dreams  
  
Stop it Stop it Dont you say a word  
I feel my hands around her neck and everything went blurred  
Broken broken she slipped from out my hands  
She lay so still and lifeless I cried baby baby baby  
  
Chorus  
  
Cheatin cheatin cheatin in your dreams  
  
Cheatin cheatin cheatin in your dreams  
  
It was my dumb luck I just came unstuck  
My whole world shook Id had about enough  
When I woke up I caught you cheatin in your dreams  
  
Cheatin cheatin cheatin in your dreams
