Driving home she grabs something to eat  
Turns a corner and drives down her street  
Into a row of houses she just melts away  
Like the scenery in another mans play  
Into a house where the blinds are closed  
To keep from seeing things she dont want to know  
She pulls the blinds and looks out on the street  
The cool of the night takes the edge off the heat  
  
In the Jackson Cage  
Down in Jackson Cage  
You can try with all your might  
But youre reminded every night  
That you been judged and handed life  
Down in Jackson Cage  
  
Every day ends in wasted motion  
Just crossed swords on the killing floor  
To settle back is to settle without knowing  
The hard edge that youre settling for  
Because theres always just one more day  
And its always gonna be that way  
Little girl youve been down here so long  
I can tell by the way that you move you belong to  
  
The Jackson Cage  
Down in Jackson Cage  
And it dont matter just what you say  
Are you tough enough to play the game they play  
Or will you just do your time and fade away  
Down into the Jackson Cage  
  
Baby theres nights when I dream of a better world  
But I wake up so downhearted girl  
I see you feeling so tired and confused  
I wonder what its worth to me or you  
Just waiting to see some sun  
Never knowing if that day will ever come  
Left alone standing out on the street  
Till you become the hand that turns the key down in  
  
Jackson Cage  
Down in Jackson Cage  
Well darlin can you understand  
The way that they will turn a man  
Into a stranger to waste away  
Down in the Jackson Cage
