I want to be bigger stronger drive a faster car  
To take me anywhere in seconds  
To take me anywhere I want to go  
And drive around a faster car  
I will settle for nothing less  
I will settle for nothing less  
  
I want to be bigger stronger drive a faster car  
At the touch of a button  
I can go anywhere I want to go  
And drive around my faster car  
I will settle for nothing less  
I will settle for nothing less  
  
I think I want to change my attitude  
I think I want to change my oxygen  
I think I want to change my air  
My atmosphere  
I want to choke  
  
I want to be bigger stronger drive a faster car  
To take me anywhere in seconds  
To take me anywhere I want to go  
And drive around my faster car  
I will settle for nothing less  
I will settle for nothing less  
  
I think I need to change my attitude  
I think I want to change my oxygen  
I think I want to change my air  
My atmosphere  
I want to choke  
  
Bigger better  
Bigger and better  
Bigger and better  
Bigger stronger drive a faster car  
At the touch of a button  
I can go anywhere I want to go
