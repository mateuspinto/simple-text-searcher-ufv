Please remedy my confusion  
And thrust me back to the day  
The silence of your seclusion  
Brings night into all you say  
  
Pull me down again  
And guide me into pain  
  
Im counting nocturnal hours  
Drowned visions in haunted sleep  
Faint flickering of your powers  
Leaks out to show what you keep  
  
Pull me down again  
And guide me into  
  
There is failure inside  
This test I cant persist  
Kept back by the enigma  
No criterias demanded here  
Deadly patterns made my wreath  
Prosperous in your ways  
Pale ghost in the corner  
Pouring a caress on your shoulder  
  
Puzzled by shrewd innocence  
Runs a thick tide beneath  
Ushered into inner graves  
Nails bleeding from the struggle  
It is the end for the weak at heart  
Always the same  
A lullaby for the ones whove lost all  
Reeling inside  
My gleaming eye in your necklace reflects  
Stare of primal regrets  
You turn your back and you walk away  
Never again  
  
Spiralling to the ground below  
Like Autumn leaves left in the wake to fade away  
Waking up to your sound again  
And lapse into the ways of misery
