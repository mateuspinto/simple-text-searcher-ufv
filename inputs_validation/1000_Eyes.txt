Crossing the line into the other side  
Emerging as prisoners  
To the emptiness of time  
  
To the left and to the right  
From behind  theyre out of sight  
Plunging into a new found  
Age of advanced observeillance  
A worldwide foolproof cage  
  
Privacy and intimacy as we know it  
Will be a memory  
Among many to be passed down  
To those who never knew  
  
Living in the pupil of 1000 eyes  
  
Was it overlooked in front of all our faces  
Now all the mistakes and secrets  
Cannot be erased  
  
Viewing the blind complexity  
By which laws were justified  
To erase simplicity  
  
To the left and to the right  
From behind  theyre out of sight  
Plunging into a new found  
Age of advanced observeillance  
A worldwide foolproof cage  
  
Privacy and intimacy as we know it  
Will be a memory  
Among many to be passed down  
To those who never knew  
  
Living in the pupil of 1000 eyes  
  
We are enslaved now
