Broken lines broken strings  
Broken threads broken springs  
Broken idols broken heads  
People sleeping in broken beds  
Aint no use jiving  
Aint no use joking  
Everything is broken  
  
Broken bottles broken plates  
Broken switches broken gates  
Broken dishes broken parts  
Streets are filled with broken hearts  
Broken words never meant to be spoken  
Everything is broken  
  
Bridge Seem like every time you stop and turn around  
Something else just hit the ground  
  
Broken cutters broken saws  
Broken buckles broken laws  
Broken bodies broken bones  
Broken voices on broken phones  
Take a deep breath feel like youre chokin  
Everything is broken  
  
Bridge Every time you leave and go off someplace  
Things fall to pieces in my face  
  
Broken hands on broken ploughs  
Broken treaties broken vows  
Broken pipes broken tools  
People bending broken rules  
Hound dog howling bull frog croaking  
Everything is broken
