You push me I dont have the strength to  
Resist or control you  
So take me down  
Take me down  
  
You hurt me but do I deserve this  
You make me so nervous  
Calm me down  
Calm me down  
  
Wake you up in the middle of the night to say  
I will never walk away again  
I never gonna leave this bed  
  
So come here and never leave this place  
Perfection of your face  
Slows me down  
Slows me down  
So fall down I need you to trust me  
Go easy dont rush me  
  
Help me out why dont you help me out  
  
Wake you up in the middle of the night to say  
I will never walk away again  
I never gonna leave this bed  
You say go  
It isnt worth it and I say no  
It isnt perfect so I stay and still  
Im never gonna leave this bed uh  
  
Take it take it all take all that I have  
Id give it all away just to get you back  
And fake it fake it Ill take what I can get  
Knocking so loud can you hear me yet  
Try to stay awake but you cant forget  
  
Wake you up in the middle of the night to say  
I will never walk away again  
Im never gonna leave this bed  
Oh you say go  
It isnt worth it and I say no  
It isnt perfect so I stay and still  
Im never gonna leave this bed uh  
  
Take it take it all take all that I have  
Take it take it all take all that I have  
Take it take it all take all that I have  
Take it take it all take all that I have  
Take it take it all take all that I have  
Take it take it all take all that I have  
Take it take it all take all that I have
