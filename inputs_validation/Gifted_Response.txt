Father we cannot come to You by our own merit  
We will come in the name of Your son  
As He glorifies You  
And in the power of Your spirit  
2x  
  
We have come to something so mysterious  
Too deep for minds to comprehend  
Through the open door  
Where the angels sing  
And the host of heaven are antheming  
  
And well sing the glory of Your name  
Celebrate the glories of Your grace  
We will worship You We will worship You  
And well make Your praise so glorious  
Singing songs of everlasting praise  
We will worship You we will worship You
