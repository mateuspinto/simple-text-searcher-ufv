Blasting our way through the boundaries of Hell  
No one can stop us tonight  
We take on the world with hatred inside  
Mayhem the reason we fight  
Surviving the slaughters and killing weve lost  
Then we return from the dead  
Attacking once more now with twice as much strength  
We conquer then move on ahead  
  
Chorus  
Evil  
My words defy  
Evil  
Has no disguise  
Evil  
Will take your soul  
Evil  
My wrath unfolds  
  
Satan our master in evil mayhem  
Guides us with every first step  
Our axes are growing with power and fury  
Soon therell be nothingness left  
Midnight has come and the leathers strapped on  
Evil is at our command  
We clash with Gods angel and conquer new souls  
Consuming all that we can  
  
Chorus
