O winter night of wonder  night of promise long foretold  
When angel voices filled the heavens high above  
Announced the joy of the ages and His glory to behold  
For into this world is born the wondrous Child of Love  
O star of hope that leads us to His manger  
Shine your light upon the newborn King  
For all who seek to find new life  
Make a gift of your heart  
And follow the star  
To hear the song that heaven sings  
Like the wise men of old  
Come follow the star  
They laid their gifts before Him on that night so long ago  
Stood in His presence every pilgrim great and small  
To worship at His manger is to kneel before His throne  
Laying our burdens down the greatest gift of all  
O star divine that brings us to our Savior  
Give the light of love to show us our way  
In place of gold lay down your life  
In place of frankincense and myrrh  
Abandon all
