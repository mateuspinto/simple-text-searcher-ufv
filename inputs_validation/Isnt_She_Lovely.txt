Isnt she lovely  
Isnt she wonderful  
Isnt she precious  
Less than one minute old  
I never thought through love wed be  
Making one as lovely as she  
But isnt she lovely made from love  
Isnt she pretty  
Truly the angels best  
Boy Im so happy  
We have been heaven blessed  
I cant believe what God has done  
Through us hes given life to one  
But isnt she lovely made from love  
Isnt she lovely  
Life and love are the same  
Life is Aisha  
The meaning of her name  
Londie it could have not been done  
Without you who conceived the one  
Thats so very lovely made from love
