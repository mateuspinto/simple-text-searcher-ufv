You can still come and make me coffee in the mornin  
You can still come and cook me chicken fried steak  
You can live your life with whomever you please to  
As long as someone takes good care of me  
You know I dont mind  
How can I live without you  
If it means I gotta get a job  
You could still come bring me those fancy pastries  
You can still come round crawl into my bed  
You can live your life with whomever you please to  
As long as someone takes good care of me  
You know I dont mind  
How can I live without you  
If it means I gotta get a job
