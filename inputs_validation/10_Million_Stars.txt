You can call it a comeback  
I lay back analyze the rhymes and realize  
I own that crown for lyrical combat  
Spit more raps to count more stacks  
Kicking back in the coup  
I got loops relax Im hotness  
Monotonous fans is running bizzack  
L please dont leave the game like thizzat  
Never in a million years  
Ill never let you down baby  
I drop 50 I steal gravy  
  
Chorus x2  
I look back on Venus  
I look I look back on Mars  
And and I burn with the fire  
Of ten of ten million stars LL guess whos back uh  
  
Im more then a conqueror  
Double up your bets  
Come and rumble with the decks  
I know you had that clown picked  
Mind blowing out cause L still sound sick  
You dream you was me  
I gleam lyrically  
I love em for it its the highest form of flattery  
Doin the buck 10 chrome skating on the battery  
My clutch burnin on top of the world turnin  
Rippers is just learning by stacks I been earnin  
Im the uncle hell future of the funk  
Turn my joint up find out why Im different from all these chumps  
And tell your favorite rapper that Im ready to dump  
For real cat that represented rap from the jump  
  
Chorus  
  
Six figure interest on the cheddar  
From music fashion film and television  
Poppin amaretto so what got a vendetta  
I never felt better  
Now forever competition get severed by skills you cant measure  
Im a champ you a peon  
Kiss the ring begone  
Known and respected on any block you be on  
And be on stand there get your mad on  
I chuckle cause theres nothing to waste energy on  
There you have it  
The uncut raw for rap addicts  
Waited three years to see if L still had it  
Ten million stars  
Got beef to the deck  
End of my contract Im the last one left  
  
Chorus  
  
Repeat x2  
Ls worth paper  
Dash that damn who put em up in that skyscraper yeah  
I take them seriously baby  
Ask my dogs up in old five who made a major  
LL playa  
Now whos next to need a paper  
Drop a bomb on them  
  
Chorus  
  
I look back on Venus  
I look back on mars  
And I burn with the fire  
Of ten million stars
