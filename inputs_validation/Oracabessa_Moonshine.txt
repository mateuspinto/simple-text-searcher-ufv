Oracabessa moonshine  
Is washing over me  
The Jacaranda tree  
And bathing in the sea  
Oracabessa sun up  
Will chase the night away  
Across the Lada bay  
And back to yesterday  
A warm Blue Mountain raincloud welcomed by the land  
Made the morning cooler left a rainbow in the sand  
Sweet Hibiscus lingers in my own backyard  
With a million different colors of a Hummingbird  
  
Orocabessa sunshine  
Is washing over me  
The Jacaranda tree  
And bathing in the sea  
Oracabessa sun up  
Will chase the night away  
Across the Lada bay  
And back to yesterday  
  
The Fireflys romance ignites the evening shade  
Makes the twilight dance a moonlight serenade  
The smoke sends out a signal above the golden sea  
Another day in Ladda Bay is waiting there for me  
  
Oracabessa moonshine  
Is washing over me  
The Jacaranda tree  
And bathing in the sea  
Oracabessa sun up  
Will chase the night away  
Across the Lada bay  
And back to yesterday
