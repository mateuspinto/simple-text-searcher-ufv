You kindle the fire of love inside me  
Each time our lips meet  
Im not strong when were alone  
Your kisses make me weak  
You must know how I feel  
But do you feel the same  
Everytime you kiss me  
You add fuel to the flame  
  
My eyes light up when I see you  
I burn with desire  
Each time youre near  
You say youll care  
But still Im not sure  
But please dont ask me to love you  
If youre not gonna change my name  
  
Everytime you touch me  
You add fuel to the flame  
This fire you started inside me  
Has reached my very soul  
Youre adding fuel to a flame  
Thats already burning out of control  
When you give me your name  
I give you everything  
Everytime you kiss me  
Adds fuel to the flame  
Yes everytime you touch me  
You add fuel to the flame
