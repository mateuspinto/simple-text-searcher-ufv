Life can be strange somethings we forget  
Or rearrange in time lose the past  
Tell me the truth tell me how can I know  
That this new love of ours that its gonna last  
  
I need your strength and I feel your worth  
With you I feel protected from all harm  
  
Where do we go from here its clear  
You erase the fear in me that keeps me alone  
Where do we go from here I know  
No matter what the road your love will lead me home  
  
Whats in a name his life just a game  
We color then erase weve been erased when we lose face  
How many lives tell me how many tries  
Before we get it right before we get it right the truth is inside  
  
I need your strength and I feel your worth  
With you I feel protected from all harm  
  
Where do we go from here its clear  
You erase the fear in me that keeps me alone  
Where do we go from here I know  
No matter what the road your love will lead me home  
  
When I never weak so weak  
To scared to speak  
When I never low so low  
To tell me you will never need  
  
Where do we go from here its clear  
You erase the fear in me that keeps me alone  
Where do we go from here I know  
No matter what the road your love will lead me home  
  
No matter what the road your love will lead me home
