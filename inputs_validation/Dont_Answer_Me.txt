If you believe in the power magic  
I can change your mind  
And if you need to believe in someone  
Turn and look behind  
When we were living in a dream world  
Clouds got in the way  
We gave it up in a moment of madness  
And threw it all away  
  
Dont answer me dont break the silence  
Dont let me win  
Dont answer me stay on your island  
Dont let me in  
  
Run away and hide from everyone  
Can you change the things weve said and done  
  
If you believe in the power of magic  
Its all a fantasy  
So if you need to believe in someone  
Just pretend its me  
It aint enough that we meet as strangers  
I cant set you free  
So will you turn your back forever on what you mean to me  
  
Dont answer me dont break the silence  
Dont let me win  
Dont answer me stay on your island  
Dont let me in  
  
Run away and hide from everyone  
Can you change the things weve said and done
