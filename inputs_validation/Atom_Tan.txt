Now the corporations stopped  
Stopped pushing fast food  
Been a multiple shooting  
Downtown at the bank  
Reluctantly the panic begins  
To catch fire  
But it did not affect  
The steady sale of jun  
The state office looked  
It looked like Hollywood  
With makeup bleeding all over the cracks  
Wo he blew his lines  
Facing the cameras  
He suffered the first  
  
Chorus  
All live heart attack  
Oh youve caught an even atom tan  
  
The motorcyanide  
Cyanide suicide  
He finally found the brick wall in his life  
Shining up his engine  
He dressed right up for it  
At the top of the speedo  
He crumpled the bike  
Theres plenty people runnin runnin for cover  
Hoping at best to hold off all the rest  
Once last stand at the bunker fire  
Machine gun and pitchfork and breast  
  
Chorus  
  
But it isnt so easy  
So easy for lovers  
Chained in love  
Stained at the top of the tower  
The pink hearse is leaving at funeral speed  
Driving your heart  
Away with the flowers  
All night I waited  
I waited for a horseman  
His ever faithful  
His Indian friend  
Im not the only one  
Of the caped crusader fan club watching the sky  
For mankinds friend  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh youve caught an even atom tan  
Calamine
