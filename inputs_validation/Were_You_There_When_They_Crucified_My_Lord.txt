Were you there when they crucified my Lord  
Were you there when they crucified my Lord  
Oh sometimes it causes me to tremble tremble tremble  
Were you there when they crucified my Lord  
Were you there when they nailed him to the tree  
Were you there when they nailed him to the tree  
Oh sometimes it causes me to tremble tremble tremble  
Were you there when they nailed him to the tree  
Were you there when they pierced him in the side  
Were you there when they pierced him in the side  
Oh sometimes it causes me to tremble tremble tremble  
Were you there when they pierced him in the side  
Were you there when they laid him in the tomb  
Were you there when they laid him in the tomb  
Oh sometimes it causes me to tremble tremble tremble  
Were you there when they laid him in the tomb
