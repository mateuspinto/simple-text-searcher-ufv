I see all the tough guys still not 25  
Dying on their feet  
Coughing honking cadging cigarettes  
And still out on the street  
Well they got no money nowhere to go  
Fathers of 2 3 maybe 4 what are they gonna do  
Jimmy got a busted mouth in a fight last night  
He says hes ok  
Going down to the workies club thats a laugh  
To buy something strong and take the pain away  
Joys of christmas  
Joys of christmas  
Northern style  
Flashing christmas light of police blue  
Go spinning down the street  
Women try to drag the men from pubs  
Into the stores  
And work hands in empty pockets deep  
We stand outside the neon ice and wish ourselves the best  
He says hes ok out of work and fighting  
Is all hes ever known  
And laughs and says I worry too much anyway  
Joys of christmas  
Joys of christmas  
Northern style  
Lets drink to the likes of jim  
Before we all go insane  
And please dont ask me why  
Itll take too long to explain  
Joys of christmas
