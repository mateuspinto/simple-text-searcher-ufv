Last night I was in heaven Today Im still on a cloud In his arms I was in  
Heaven and I didnt know what it was all about When he walked out the hurt  
Walked in I guess I wasnt ready for love  
Last night I thought I was gain today I feel so ashamed If he only knew I need  
  
Him again he would come and ease my pain When he walked out the hurt walked in  
I guess I wasnt ready for love  
He said that he loved me he told me hed protect me he told me he needed me
but  
I was to blind to see yeah I was to blind to see  
  
Last night I was in heaven but it was hell when he walked out the hurt walked  
In I guess that I wasnt ready for love  
Wasnt ready Wasnt ready
