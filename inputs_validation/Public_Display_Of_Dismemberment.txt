Anarchy disarray this is the world today  
Justice is a lie for the followers to get by  
No peace only guns cant trust anyone  
Live or die its an eye for an eye  
  
Unrest marshal law society decays  
And its safe to say there is no other way  
With lawless arrogance and savage dissidents  
Public display of dismemberment  
  
Blameless innocent lies of the decadent  
Brazen hypocrites answering to idiots  
New tax market crash high life never lasts  
No quick fix for broken politics  
  
Unrest marshal law society decays  
And its safe to say there is no other way  
With lawless arrogance and savage dissidents  
Public display of dismemberment  
  
Aftermath of tolerance judgment is defined  
Individual pain is a strong incentive  
Infiltrate with fear keeping penance ever near  
Punish with indecency and mutilate for all to see  
  
Disarray no quick fix for broken politics  
Anarchy live or die its an eye for an eye  
  
Unrest marshal law society decays  
And its safe to say there is no other way  
With lawless arrogance and savage dissidents  
Public display of dismemberment
