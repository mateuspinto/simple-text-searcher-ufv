Need your love need your love need your love need your love  
Fell apart broke my heart need your love need your love  
If I could go around the world  
I couldnt find another girl need your love  
Need your love need your love need your love need your love  
  
You make me lonely  
Why should you care  
I give you everything  
Thats hardly fair  
I give you lovin  
Its what you need  
I give you everything  
Everything in me  
It might surprise you  
But thats not the reason
