Here comes Sue and she looks crazy  
Skipping down the hillside gaily  
Looking like the flowers that bloom in May  
Wont you make your reservation  
I will meet you at the station  
Wont you come and see me All Saints Day  
  
Follow my lead it is no wonder I seem to be so high  
Living my dreams the way I ought to  
As the days go rolling by  
See me strolling through the meadow  
With you baby by my side  
Wont you come and see me All Saints Day  
  
See the streamline blue horizon  
With you baby by the way  
Wont you come and see me All Saints Day  
You can make your reservation  
I will meet you at the station  
When you come to see me All Saints Day  
  
When you come to see me All Saints Day  
When you come to see me All Saints Day
