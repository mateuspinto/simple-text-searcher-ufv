This song was first released on the All Aboard album It is the only album it
has been released on  
  
Do you hear that whistle down the line  
I figure that its Engine Number 49  
Shes the only one thatll sound that way  
On the Atchison Topeka and the Santa Fe  
  
See the old smoke rising round the bend  
I reckon that she knows shes gonna meet a friend  
Folks around these parts set the time of day  
From the Atchison Topeka and the Santa Fe  
  
Here she comes whoo oo oo oo  
Hey Jim you better get the rig whoo oo oo oo  
Shes got a list of passengers thats pretty big  
  
And theyll all want a lift to Browns Hotel  
Cause lots of them been traveling for quite a spell  
All the way from Philadel phi a  
On the Atchison Topeka and the Santa Fe  
  
All Aboard All Aboard  
  
Let her rip let her rip Mr Engineer  
Gotta go gotta go far away from here  
While the man at the fire shovels in the coals  
Stick your head out the cab and watch the drivers roll  
See the towns and the roads go a whizzing by  
Farethewell Laramie and Rocky Mountain High  
Yes sirree here we are going all the way  
Mustnt quit till we hit Califor ni a  
  
See the old smoke rising round the bend  
I reckon that she knows shes gonna meet a friend  
Folks around these parts set the time of day  
From the Atchison Topeka and the Santa Fe  
  
Words and music by Johnny Mercer and Harry Warren
