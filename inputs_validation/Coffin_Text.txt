There was a time when men would prosper  
They saw a sign that would offer them the key  
Immortality  
The desert sand held a place of recourse  
Their motivation driven by a higher source  
A higher source  
  
They let them know theres something more  
The writings on the wall  
Tell us the story of it all  
It makes no sense  
  
Show me the key  
The coffin text  
The disbelievers came to conquer  
The secrets lost in a buried desert tomb  
They sealed the truth  
As evolution ate the pharaoh  
Silenced the voice that cured all our sorrow  
Oh our sorrow  
  
Silenced the voice that let us know  
The writings on the wall  
Tell us the story of it all  
It makes no sense  
Show me the key  
The coffin text  
  
Fighting learning saving burning  
Never knowing what is coming next  
Lying stealing never healing  
Safe to say weve all been hexed  
Its in the coffin text
