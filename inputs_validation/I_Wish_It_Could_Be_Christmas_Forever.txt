I wish it could be Christmas forever  
I wish that glow would never fade away  
With friends and loved ones near us  
Round the Christmas tree so tall  
We hear the church bells ringing  
Dear Lord bless us one and all  
  
I know Id be content now and forever  
If those Christmas lights would sparkle every day  
Thered be candy canes and mistletoe  
Children singing carols we know singing carols we know  
If love and peace on earth would always stay  
I know it could be Christmas every day
