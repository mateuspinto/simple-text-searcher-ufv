Well you can run to the end of the highway and not find what youre looking
for  
Moving wont make your troubles disappear  
And you can search to the end of the highway and come back no better than
before  
To find yourself youve got to start right here  
Well I came running when I got the news that you were leaving  
Oh Ive gotta talk some sense to you cause Im your friend  
You say you want to hit the road cause life is so deceiving  
Do you think its different at the other end  
So you can run to the end of the highway and not find what youre looking for  
Moving wont make your troubles disappear  
And you can search to the end of the highway and come back no better than
before  
To find yourself youve got to start right here  
Oh I came running when I got the news that you were crying  
Oh my friend has life been so unkind to you  
You say you want to find a place where people are not lying  
If you find a place like that Ill go there too  
Oh you can run to the end of the highway and not find what youre looking for  
Moving wont make your troubles disappear  
And you can search to the end of the highway and come back no better than
before  
To find yourself youve got to start right here  
Yes to find yourself youve got to start right here
