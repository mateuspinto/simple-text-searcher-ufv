Oft times I recall how it was in days gone by  
No tears at all now you better not make me cry  
Because you know darn well  
I may ring your bell  
Is there anybody home  
Is there anyone in there  
Who can tell me where I am  
Oft times I recall when there wasnt no need to lie  
So much was said but we never did say goodbye  
Oh how I long to hear you whisper in my ear  
Is there anybody home dont you know Im all alone  
Can you tell me where I am  
All I can do is love you til the end of all time  
One day time will tell when youre living in yesterday  
Thinking of things to do thinking of things to say  
Thinking of things divine find a bottom line  
Is there anybody home  
Is there anyone in there  
Who can tell me where I am  
Oft times I recall I was thinking of ways to win  
Ready to risk it all until it wore thin  
Oh how I long to hear you whisper in my ear  
Is there anybody home dont you know Im all alone  
Can you tell me where I am  
All I can do is love you til the end of all time  
All I can do is love you til the end of all time
