Along lifes road  
There will be sunshine and rain  
Roses and thorns laughter and pain  
And cross the miles  
You will face mountains so steep  
Deserts so long and valleys so deep  
Sometimes the Journeys gentle  
Sometimes the cold winds blow  
But I want you to remember  
I want you to know  
  
Chorus  
Chorus  
You will never walk alone  
As long as you have faith  
Jesus will be right beside you all the way  
And you may feel youre far from home  
But home is where He is  
And Hell be there down every road  
You will never walk alone  
  
never no never  
  
The path will wind  
And you will find wonders and fears  
Labors of love and a few falling tears  
Across the years  
There will be some twists and turns  
Mistakes to make and lessons to learn  
Sometimes the journeys gentle  
Sometimes the cold winds blow  
But I want you to remember wherever you may go  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Jesus knows your joy Jesus knows your need  
He will go the distance with you faithfully  
  
Repeat Chorus
