ABSOLUTE ZERO  
Lyrics from the Japanese KFADFFAL  
Can we being at the end to save some time  
Dead center  
Point blank  
Together  
The clock is ticking  
You have no authority here  
Float like a dead man down the river  
And there are no streets in this city  
Et cetera is my worst enemy  
Its low and I know it all will go  
To the big hand of the god damned  
Youre here  
Red dot  
And now you know where not to go  
The middle ground is absolute zero  
What can be found at absolute zero  
Can we begin at the end to save some time  
Et cetera is my worst enemy  
Its low and I know it all will go  
To the big hand of the god damned  
The big hand of the bald man  
The middle ground is absolute zero  
What can be found at absolute zero  
A happy end is absolute zero  
Nobody wins an absolute zero  
Worse than nothing  
Nothing
