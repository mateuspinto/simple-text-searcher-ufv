Watch me now here I go all I needs a little snow  
Starts me off sets the theme helps me dream my Christmas dream  
Every year I dream it hoping things will change  
An end to the crying the shouting the dying  
And I hope you will dream it too  
Its Christmas  
Remember  
Weve got to remember  
  
So light the light Im home tonight  
I need you to warm me to calm me to love me  
To help me to dream my Christmas dream  
  
Crazy things said an done  
Every single day but one  
Every night should I believe  
Be the same as Christmas Eve  
Nights should all be silent  
Days should all slow down  
An end to the hurry the noise and the worry  
And I hope you believe that too  
Its Christmas  
Remember  
Does no one remember  
  
The whole world needs a Christmas dream  
We need it to warm us to calm us to love us  
To help us to dream our Christmas dream
