I am an old woman named after my mother  
My old man is another child thats grown old  
If dreams were lightning thunder was desire  
This old house would have burnt down a long time ago  
  
Chorus  
Make me an angel that flies from Montgomry  
Make me a poster of an old rodeo  
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to  
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go  
  
When I was a young girl well I had me a cowboy  
He werent much to look at just free rambling man  
But that was a long time and no matter how I try  
The years just flow by like a broken down dam  
  
Chorus  
  
Theres flies in the kitchen I can hear em there buzzing  
And I aint done nothing since I woke up today  
How the hell can a person go to work in the morning  
And come home in the evening and have nothing to say  
  
Chorus
