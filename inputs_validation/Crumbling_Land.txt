In a while Ill find the time to make the sunshine mine  
In a smile I saw a single eagle in the sky  
Wheeling soaring gliding high  
On a hill there lived a man with many shining things  
Shiny gold shiny car and shiny diamond rings  
Wining dining shining king  
Now the eagle flies in clear blue skies  
Drinking in the clear blue well  
Back here on the ground another dealer coughs and dies  
But fifty more come rolling off the floor production line  
Then a man commuting like a village on the sand  
In his hand a moving picture of the crumbling land  
Screaming dealing movie man  
Here we go hold your breath to see if something blows  
Close your eyes count till ten and see the sunrise rise  
Gliding high into the sky  
By the holy mansion let the guardian rise  
Upon the finger of the king  
On high the eagle flies that glitter all of gold  
Then wheeling in a cloudy sky he flies into the sun
