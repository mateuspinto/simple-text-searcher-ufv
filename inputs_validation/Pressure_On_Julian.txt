Only the magical transit children  
sing sing the lullaby bah bah bah  
Sitting on the pavement sucking on a long straw  
Its colorful its colorful but it washes you out  
  
Here is my violence and here is the excuse  
I learned it all but only second hand  
Falling into walls well what is it with you  
You never know never know never know  
  
Chorus  
We planned it all this way  
We planned it all this way  
Pressure on Julian  
  
Swimming in yellow pissy water  
Sand getting in between their ears  
No blood in head in this bloddy weather  
Irate people with yellow tounges  
  
Only the magical transit children  
sing sing the lullaby bah bah bah  
Falling into walls well what is it with you  
You never know never know never know  
  
Chorus  
  
There was pressure on Julian pushing trolleys in the car park from B to A  
then back to B Pressure on Julian he keeps passing out  
Poor precious little snout the birds are singing at night  
Pressure on Julian  
  
Chorus
