It was January 1963  
When Johnny came home with a gift for me  
He said I bought it for you because I love you  
And I bought it for you because its your birthday too  
He was so very nice he was so very kind  
To think of me at this point in time  
I used to think of him he used think of me  
He told me to close my eyes  
My gift would be a great surprise  
I saw tears were in his eyes  
He never meant to hurt me  
Oh God Johnny dont point that gun at me  
Theres so many ways our lives have changed  
But please I beg dont do this to me  
Johnny dont point that gun at me  
Can I save my life at any price  
For Gods sake wont you listen to me  
  
And though he was ashamed that he had took a life  
Johnny came home with another wife  
And he often remembered how it used to be  
Before that special occasion 1963  
There was too many ways that you could kill someone  
Like in a love affair when the love is gone  
He told me to close my eyes  
My gift would be a great surprise  
I saw hatred in his eyes  
He never meant to hurt me  
Oh God Johnny dont point that gun at me  
Theres so many ways our lives have changed  
But please I beg dont do this to me  
Johnny you keep on using me  
Can I change my life for any price  
Oh Johnny wont you listen to me  
  
He told me to close my eyes  
My gift would be a great surprise  
I saw hatred in his eyes  
But he never meant to hurt me  
Oh God Johnny dont point that gun at me  
Theres so many ways our lives have changed  
But please I beg dont do this to me  
Johnny you keep on using me  
Can I change my life for any price  
Oh Johnny wont you listen to me  
  
I just want you to be mine  
I dont want this world to shine  
I dont want this bridge to burn  
Oh Johnny do you miss me  
I just want to feel for you  
I will always feel for you
