Hallelujah what a mighty God  
You made a way for me  
You made a way for me  
No one like You  
Wonderful You are  
You freely gave to me  
You freely gave me a  
Hope and a future  
Now I live to worship You  
Thats why I love You  
Because You first loved me  
Yeah You first loved me  
Thank You Jesus  
My whole life has changed  
You laid it down for me  
You laid it down for me  
Out of darkness  
Called me by my name  
You shined Your light on me  
You shined Your light of  
Hope and a future  
Now I live to worship You  
You gave me a hope  
You gave me a future  
I love You  
Cause You first loved me
