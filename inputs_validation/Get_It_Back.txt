Remember when  
It all began  
We were all in love  
Then came the friends  
Telling you when  
Your time for me was good enough  
I constantly  
Had to compete  
With your crew and their schemes  
Remembering  
Back in the day  
I used to mean everything  
  
If we could just get it back  
To the way it used to be  
My only wish would be that  
Nothing would change for you and me  
I remember how it was  
And I know that for a fact  
We were oh so deep in love  
If we could just get it back  
  
Now tell me why  
So many nights  
You had so much to do  
When you said bye  
Sometimes I tried  
I tried to make you choose  
Now tell me how  
You can allow  
You boys to control  
The time we shared  
It was unfair  
But now you need to know  
  
Now if I told you  
That Im moving on  
Boy what would you do  
Things just aint the same  
We were supposed to  
Conquer everything yeah  
Boy let me tell you  
Youve got to make a change  
  
If we could just get it back  
To the way it used to be  
My only wish would be that  
Nothing would change for you and me  
I remember how it was  
And I know that for a fact  
We were oh so deep in love  
If we could just get it back  
  
If we could just get it back  
To the way it used to be  
My only wish would be that  
Nothing would change for you and me  
I remember how it was  
And I know that for a fact  
We were oh so deep in love  
If we could just get it back
