Mortuaries dead of night  
My body starts to rise  
In my mind the horror lives  
To feel death deep inside  
  
Relentless lust of rotting flesh  
To thrash the tomb she lies  
Heathen whore of Satans wrath  
I spit at your demise  
  
Virgin child now drained of life  
Your soul cannot be free  
Not given the chance to rot in Hell  
  
Satans cross points to Hell  
The earth I must uncover  
A passion grows to feast upon  
The frozen blood inside her  
  
I feel the urge the growing need  
To fuck this sinful corpse  
My tasks complete the bitchs soul  
Lies raped in demonic lust  
  
Her stomach bursts the casket breaks  
The seed has taken form  
A writhing shape of twisted flesh  
The Devils child is thrown  
  
Hungry for the smell of Death  
He rules forbidden evil  
Vengeance with a frenzied hatred  
The bastard now must die  
  
Lost souls of the dead  
Form legions that burst through Hells Gates  
Death of one sacrifice  
To avenge the raped corpse from the grave  
Blood of one mortal man  
The fire grows stronger within  
Fate of a frenzied lust  
Lucifer takes my dark soul  
  
Down to the fiery pits of Hell  
Down to the fiery pits of hell
