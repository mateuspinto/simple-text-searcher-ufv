If you turn turn away  
I can pretend that youll stay  
  
If you want it  
If you want I will  
Torn in two torn away  
I could not look  
I wish you did  
  
If you want it  
If you want I will  
If you really want it  
If you really want to  
  
All ways I want to burn  
set fire to  
things that were not returned  
So take what you can get  
second chance might not come  
Or we can just stay dumb  
If really you want to  
I I will  
If you really want to  
  
If you turn away  
If you turn turn away  
  
If you want to  
If you want to  
If you want to  
  
Are we rolling
