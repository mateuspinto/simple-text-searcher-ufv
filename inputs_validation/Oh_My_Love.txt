Oh my love for the first time in my life  
My eyes are wide open  
Oh my lover for the first time in my life  
My eyes can see  
  
I see the wind  
Oh I see the trees  
Everything is clear in my heart  
I see the clouds  
Oh I see the sky  
Everything is clear in our world  
  
Oh my love for the first time in my life  
My mind is wide open  
Oh my lover for the first time in my life  
My mind can feel  
  
I feel the sorrow  
I feel dreams  
Everything is clear in my heart  
I feel the life  
Oh I feel love  
Everything is clear in our world
