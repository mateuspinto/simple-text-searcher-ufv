COSETTE  
In my life  
I have all I could want  
You are loving and gentle and good  
But Papa dear Papa  
In your eyes I am just like a child  
who is lost in a wood  
  
VALJEAN  
No more words  
No more its a time that is dead  
There are words  
That are better unheard  
Better unsaid  
  
MARIUS  
In my life  
She has burts like the music of angels  
the light of the sun  
and my life seems to stop  
as if something is over  
and something has scarcely begun  
  
MARIUS AND EPONINE  
In my life  
there is someone who touches my life  
  
MARIUS  
waiting near  
  
EPONINE  
waiting here
