He wields his flute with an expert hand  
And then all too soon  
The dancing stops and the children stand  
The piper calls the tune  
  
He holds their future in his palm  
An old and powerful man  
With missiles poised and bombs at hand  
They wait for his command  
  
With songs of fear and bigotry  
A cruel hypnotic sound  
He plays his last tune greedily  
And strikes the children down
