Muskrat muskrat candlelight  
Doin the town and doin it right  
In the evenin  
Its pretty pleasin  
  
Muskrat Susie muskrat Sam  
Do the jitterbug out in muskrat land  
And they shimmy  
And Sammys so skinny  
  
And they whirled and they twirled and they tangoed  
Singin and jinglin the jango  
Floatin like the heavens above  
It looks like muskrat love  
  
Nibblin on bacon Chewin on cheese  
Sammy says to Suisie Honey would you please be my missus  
And she says yes  
With her kisses  
  
And now hes ticklin her fancy  
Rubbin her toes  
Muzzle to muzzle now anything goes  
As they wiggle  
And Sue starts to giggle  
And they whirled and they twirled and they tangoed  
Singin and jinglin the jango  
Floatin like the heavens above  
It looks like muskrat love
