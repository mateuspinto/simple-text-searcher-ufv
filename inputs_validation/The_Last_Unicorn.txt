When the last eagle flies  
Over the last crumbling mountain  
And the last lion roars  
At the last dusty fountain  
In the shadow of the forest  
Though she may be old and worn  
They will stare unbelieving  
At the Last Unicorn  
When the first breath of winter  
Throught the flowers is icing  
And you look to the north  
And a pale moon is rising  
And it seems like all is dying  
And would leave the world to mourn  
In the distance hear her laughter  
Its the Last Unicorn  
Im alive Im alive  
When the last moon is cast  
Over the last star of morning  
And the future has past  
Without even a last desparate warning  
Then look into the sky where through  
The cloudes a path is formed  
Look and see her how she sparkles  
Its the Last Unicorn  
Im alive Im alive
