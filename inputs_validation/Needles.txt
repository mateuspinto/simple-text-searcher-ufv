I cannot disguise  
All the stomach pains  
And the walking of the canes  
When you do come out  
And you whisper up to me  
In your life of tragedy  
  
But I cannot grow  
Till you eat the last of me  
Oh when will I be free  
And you a parasite  
Just find another host  
Just another fool to roast  
  
Cause you  
My tapeworm tells me what to do  
You  
My tapeworm tells me where to go  
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass Hey  
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass Hey  
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass Hey  
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass Hey  
  
I cannot deny  
All the evil traits  
And the filling of the crates  
When you do come out  
And you slither up to me  
In your pimpin majesty  
  
But I cannot grow  
Till you eat the last of me  
Oh when will I be free  
And you a parasite  
Just find another host  
Just another stool to post  
  
Cause you  
My tapeworm tells me what to do  
You  
My tapeworm tells me where to go  
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass Hey  
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass Hey  
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass Hey  
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass Hey  
Pull the tapeworm out of me  
  
Im just sitting in my room  
With a needle in my hand  
Just waiting for the tomb  
Of some old dying man  
Sitting in my room  
With a needle in my hand  
Just waiting for the tomb  
Of some old dying man  
  
Cause you  
My tapeworm tells me what to do  
You  
My tapeworm tells me where to go  
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass hey  
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass hey  
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass Hey  
Pull the tapeworm out of your ass Hey  
Hey hey hey hey
