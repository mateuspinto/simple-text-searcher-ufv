Danny got of yellow school bus  
Looking so sad today you see it on his face  
Mommy and Daddy have been fighting again  
Every time they fight hes caught in the middle of it all  
He has dreams like every little boy in the world  
But right now his main dream  
Is to get out of here  
Is to see Mommy and Daddy disappear forever  
He doesnt wanna hear those angry voices anymore  
Danny be careful what you wish for  
You might just get it  
Be careful O Oh Oh  
  
Chorus  
You can choose your friend but you cannot  
Choose who you related to  
  
He goes up to his room hes not feeling good today  
But its no use telling nobody listens here  
No use complaining nobody cares around here  
Little boys go to sleep and pray  
For toys and candy he prays for one thing  
God I need a miracle down here  
Will you make Mommy and Daddy  
Disappear forever  
Danny be careful what you wish for  
You might just get it  
Be careful Oh Oh Oh  
  
Chorus  
You can choose your friend but you cannot  
Choose who you related to
