I want expensive not cheap  
And all the secrets that you keep  
Should be quietly put to sleep  
Not then not when not yet this week  
  
I have told a thousand lies  
But this time he is surprised  
Cut the alibis from my eyes  
From my eyes  
Eyes  
  
One sample of your wit  
You ask me round to babysit  
Just sat there smiling from a pit  
Is the goddess of the vimly lit  
  
I have told a thousand lies  
But this time he is surprised  
Cut the alibis from my eyes  
From my eyes  
From my eyes  
  
I want you pretty not polite  
And all those compliments you invite  
They should burn by candlelight  
Not tomorrow next week but just tonight  
  
I have told a thousand lies  
But this time he is surprised  
You cut the alibis from my eyes  
From my eyes  
From my eyes  
  
I have told a thousand lies  
I have told a thousand lies  
From my eyes  
I have told a thousand lies  
This time he is surprised  
I have told a thousand lies  
I have told a thousand lies
