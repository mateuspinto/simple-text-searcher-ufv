I need a sign to let me know youre here  
All of these lines are being crossed over the atmosphere  
I need to know that things are gonna look up  
Cause I feel us drowning in a sea spilled from a cup  
  
When there is no place safe and no safe place to put my head  
When you feel the world shake from the words that are said  
  
I need a sign to let me know youre here  
Cause my TV set just keeps it all from being clear  
I want a reason for the way things have to be  
I need a hand to help build up some kind of hope inside of me  
  
And Im calling all angels  
Im calling all you angels  
  
When children have to play inside so they dont disappear  
And private eyes solve marriage lies cause we dont talk for years  
And football teams are kissing Queens  
And losing sight of having dreams  
In a world that what we want is only what we want until its ours  
  
Im calling all angels  
Im calling all you angels
