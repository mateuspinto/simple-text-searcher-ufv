Gaze on the glistening lights below and above  
Oh what a night of nights for people in love  
No city but this my friend no city I know  
Gives romance such a chance to grow and grow  
  
Paris loves lovers for lovers its heaven above  
Paris tells lovers love is supreme wake up your dream and make love  
Only in Paris one discovers the urge to merge with the splurge of the spring  
Paris loves lovers for lovers know that love is everything  
  
Paris loves lovers for lovers its heaven above  
Capitalistic characteristic sensualistic they should be atheistic  
Paris tells lovers love is supreme wake up your dream and make love  
Imperialistic Im pessimistic thats anti communistic  
  
Only in Paris one discovers the urge to merge with the splurge of the spring  
Militaristic youre optimistic du jour propaganda  
Paris loves lovers for lovers know that love is everything  
Unrealistic is individualistic and not at all collectivistic but a low  
Totalitarianistic thing
