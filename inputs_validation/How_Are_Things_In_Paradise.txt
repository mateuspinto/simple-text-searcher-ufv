How are things in Paradise since you found a new romance  
Oh how are things in paradise are you glad that you stood a chance  
Oh how are things in paradise  
Do you miss me  
  
Do you ever cry  
Does he try to hold you like I used to do  
Are the stars still in your eyes  
How are things in paradise  
  
Uh does he take you hand and whisper I love you  
Oh dont you know that I love you too  
Is there sunshine or rain  
Are you coming home again  
  
Oh how are things in paradise  
How are things in paradise  
How are things in paradise since you said goodbye
