Ive got a secret I keep in my heart  
A secret that sure makes me smile  
And Ive got a feeling deep down in my soul  
That I havent felt in a while  
Ive found somebody that really does love me  
And I know that shell always stay  
Im the luckiest guy in the world  
Cause my heart feels this way  
  
We watch old movies and cry at the endings  
And get lost in each others eyes  
We hold hands when were walking and  
Spend all night talking and make love as the sun starts to rise  
Shes found somebody that really does love her  
And she knows that Ill always stay  
Im the luckiest guy in the world  
Cause her heart feels this way  
  
We share the same hopes  
We dream the same dreams  
Oh lifelong companions Id say  
Im the luckiest guy in the world  
Cause our hearts feel this way  
Im the luckiest guy in the world  
Cause our hearts feel this way
