Just see how she makes them love her  
Twisting the world around her finger  
Sensing weakness in a stranger  
With one kiss shell rearrange ya  
But I know the truth behind her smile  
Keep me warm tonight never satisfy  
If you meet again she may pass you by  
No apologies never compromise  
Its the truth behind her smile  
Just see how she makes them want her  
Oh if I could be her for one day  
Sensing weakness in a stranger  
See them run no sense of danger  
But I know the truth behind her smile  
Keep me warm tonight never satisfy  
If you meet again she may pass you by  
No apologies never compromise  
Its the truth behind her smile  
Shell let you down  
Keep me warm tonight never satisfy  
If you meet again she may pass you by  
No apologies never compromise  
Its the truth behind her  
Truth behind her smile
