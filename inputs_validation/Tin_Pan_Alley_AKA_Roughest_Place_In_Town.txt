Went down to Tin Pan Alley

Some cat was workin on Annie with a  
Lord with a twobyfour  
Hey hey hey hey Alleys the roughest place Ive ever been  
All the people down there  
Livin for their whiskey wine and gin  
  
I heard a pistol shoot

Somebody killed a crap shooter cause he didnt  
Shake rattle and roll  
Hey hey hey hey Alleys the roughest place Ive ever been  
All the people down there  
Killin for their whiskye wine and gin  
  
I saw a cop standing  
With his hand on his gun  
He said this is a raid boy  
  
Nobody run  
Hey hey hey hey Alleys the roughest place Ive ever been  
Yeah they took me away from Alley  
Lord they took me right back to the pen
