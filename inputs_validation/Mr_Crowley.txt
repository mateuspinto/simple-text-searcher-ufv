Mr Crowley what went on in your head  
Mr Crowley did you talk with the dead  
Your lifestyle to me seemed so tragic  
With the thrill of it all  
You fooled all the people with magic  
You waited on Satans call  
  
Mr Charming did you think you were pure  
Mr Alarming in nocturnal rapport  
Uncovering things that were sacred manifest on this earth  
Conceived in the eye of a secret  
And they scattered the afterbirth  
  
Mr Crowley wont you ride my white horse  
Mr Crowley its symbolic of course  
Approaching a time that is classic  
I hear maidens call  
Approaching a time that is drastic  
Standing with their backs to the wall  
  
Was it polemically sent  
I want to know what you meant  
I want to know  
I want to know what you meant
