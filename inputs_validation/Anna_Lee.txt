Helpless child  
They invite your hands to fill their needs  
Will you be the same  
Shameless smile  
To steal from you the innocence that bleeds  
Will they feel your pain  
  
Trying to believe  
The scars unseen  
The tears wash clean  
You dont wanna breathe the air you breathe  
You dont know how youll live a life alone  
  
She keeps holding on  
Holding on to you  
Let her breathe the air  
Dont wanna be alone where do you belong  
Anna lee  
  
Behind those eyes  
The vivid scene  
A lucid dream within  
Questioned secrets are revealed  
And everytime  
You cant deny  
The lines that trace your skin  
Wounds that never heal  
  
Trying to believe  
The scars unseen  
The tears wash clean  
You dont wanna breathe the air you breathe  
You dont know how youll live a life alone  
  
She keeps holding on  
Holding on to you  
Let her breathe the air  
Dont wanna be alone where do you belong  
Anna Lee  
  
And now shes calling out a name  
Cant keep on hiding all her pain  
You feel the rain move in  
As you begin  
To turn and answer the call  
  
Trying to believe  
The scars unseen  
The tears wash clean  
You dont wanna breathe the air you breathe  
You dont know how youll live a life alone  
  
She keeps holding on  
Holding on to you  
Let her breathe the air  
Dont wanna be alone where do you belong  
Anna Lee
