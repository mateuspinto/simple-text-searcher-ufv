I am the world that hides the universal  
Secret of all time  
Destruction of the empty spaces is my  
One and only crime  
  
Ive lived a thousand times  
I found out what it means to be believed  
The thoughts and images  
The unborn child who never was conceived  
  
When little worlds collide  
Im trapped inside my embryonic cell  
And flashing memories  
Are cast into the never ending well  
  
The name that scorns the face  
The child that never sees the cause of man  
The deathly darkness that  
Belies the face of those who never ran  
  
You gotta believe me  
Im talking to you  
  
Well I know its hard for you to know the reason why  
And I know youll understand when its time to die  
Dont believe the life you have will be the only one  
You have to let your body sleep to let your soul live on  
  
I want you to listen  
Im trying to get through  
  
Love has given life to you and now its your concern  
Unseen eye of inner life will make your soul return  
Still I look but not to touch  
The seeds of life are sown  
Curtain of the future falls  
The secret stays unknown  
  
Just remember love is life  
And hate is living death  
Treat your life for what its worth  
And live for every breath  
Looking back Ive lived and learned  
But now Im wondering  
Here I wait and only guess  
What this next life will bring
