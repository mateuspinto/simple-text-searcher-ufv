The strangest thought came to me on this morning  
As I awake to greet the coming dawn  
The sun was hardly peaking through the garden  
It felt that with everything I was one  
Then I wished that I could come back as a flower  
As a flower as a flower  
How I wished that I could come back as a flower  
As a flower  
To spread the sweetness of love  
To spread the sweetness of love  
The dew had finished making love to many  
A rainbow smelling sweet was in the air  
I envied all the silence I saw growing  
So unmoved by things outside of themselves  
And how I wished that I could come back as a flower  
As a flower as a flower  
How I wished that I could come back as a flower  
As a flower  
To spread the sweetness of love  
How I wished that I could come back as a flower  
Oh as a flower as a flower  
How I wished that I could come back as a flower  
As a flower as a flower  
To spread the sweetness of love  
To spread the sweetness of love
