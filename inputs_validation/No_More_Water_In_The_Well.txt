No more water in the well no more  
No more water in the well no more  
  
You take my love for granted like water  
Water you spill and you wast  
Though love is thicker than water it spills quicker than water  
And youll look up one of these days  
And therell be no more water in the well  
  
How long do you think my love can last through sorrow pain and mistrust  
Today my love is strong  
But keep doing me wrong and tomorrow it may turn to dust
