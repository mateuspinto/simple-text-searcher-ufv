Ive told myself so many times before  
But this time I think I mean it for sure  
We have reached a full stop  
Nothings gonna save us from the big drop  
Reached our natural conclusion  
Outlived the illusion  
I hate being in these situations  
That call for diplomatic relations  
If I only knew the answer  
Or I thought we had a chance  
Or I could stop this  
I would stop this thing from spreading like a cancer  
What can I say I dont want to play anymore  
What can I say Im heading for the door  
I cant stand this emotional violence  
Leave in silence  
Weve been running around in circles all year  
Doing this and that and getting nowhere  
Thisll be the last time  
I think I said that last time  
If I only had a potion  
Some magical lotion  
That could stop this I would stop this  
I would set the wheels in motion  
What can I say I dont want to play anymore  
What can I say Im heading for the door  
I cant stand this emotional violence  
Leave in silence
