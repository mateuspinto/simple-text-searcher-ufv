Just look at your father  
And youll see how you took after him  
Me Im just another  
Like my brothers  
Of my mothers genes  
  
All they ever want for you  
Are the things they didnt do  
All they ever wanted a little clue  
All they ever wanted the truth  
All they ever wanted a little bit of you  
All they ever wanted  
But they never did get  
  
The whims that were weeping for  
Our parents would be beaten for  
Leave the breast  
And then the rest  
And then regret you ever left  
  
All were ever looking for  
Is another open door  
  
All we ever look for another womb  
All we ever look for our own tomb  
All we ever look for ooh la lune  
All we ever look for a little bit of you too  
All we ever look for  
But we never do score  
  
All we ever look for a god  
All we ever look for oh a drug  
All we ever look for a great big hug  
All we ever look for a little bit of you  
All we ever look for a little bit of you too  
All we ever look for  
But we never do score
