Porter  
  
Have you heard among this clan  
I am called the forgotten man  
Well did you evah  
What a swell party this is  
Have ou heard the story of  
Dexter boy being gypped by love  
Well did you evah  
What a swell party this is  
What frails what frocks  
What furs what rocks  
What gaiety  
  
Its all too exquis  
That french champagne  
So good for the brain  
That band its the end  
  
Kindly dont fall down my friend  
Have you heard Professor munch  
Ate his wife and divorced his lunch  
Well did you evah  
What a swell party this is  
Have you heard The countess krupp  
Crossed the bridge when the bridge was up  
Well did you evah  
What a swell party this is  
  
Have you heard that mimsie starr  
Just got pinched in the astor bar  
Well did you evah  
What a swell party this is  
Have you heard that uncle newt  
Forgot to open his parachute  
Well did you evah  
What a swell party this  
It s great its grand  
It s wonderland  
What soup what fish  
That beef what a dish  
That grouse so rare  
That old camembert  
That baba au rhum  
Will you please move over chum  
Have you heard the poor dear blanche  
Got run down by an avalanche  
Well did you evah  
What a swell party this is  
Have you heard Its in the stars  
Next july we collide with mars  
Well did you evah  
What a swell party this is
