Deep inside this city night only you and me  
I can only hear your voice and all you see  
Baby I love you born to be mine  
Ill say forever you say all the time  
Take it like a vow  
Were together now  
Together now together now  
Together now together now  
In this world so fast nothing lasts  
But I can feel it  
Were gonna to make it together  
Now youre winning in big town trade  
Lose it once try to get saved  
Talk gets cheap money gets made  
In too deep time steals away  
I call you up get you on the line  
Wanna get back where we were that time  
Wanna get you out out of this place  
Hold you close just to see your face  
Together now together now  
Together now together now  
Together now together now  
Together now together now
