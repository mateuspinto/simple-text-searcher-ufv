Fellow colleges distinguished members of the press ladies  
And gentlemen  
  
I would like to take this opportunity to personally and humbly thank  
Each and every one of you for joining us at this particular event  
  
It is my hope that we can utilize this meeting of the minds to  
Successfully convey the essence of our platform to you a grand and  
Noble audience  
  
As I look out among the faces I reflect taking console in the words  
Of Franklin Delano Roosevelt who said we have nothing to fear but  
Fear itself  
  
Paranoia is a disease unto itself and may I add the person standing  
Next to you may not be who they appear to be so take precaution  
  
A mind is a terrible thing to waste this is true any a young person  
Has fallen prey to the substances that alter the perspective of any  
Right thinking individual  
  
The problem with the youth today is because of their inexperience  
With the world they cannot attempt to grasp the ideals set forth by  
Myself and those who preceded me  
  
But as history has shown they will come around and embrace our  
Philosophies and become model citizens in their own right God bless  
This great nation
