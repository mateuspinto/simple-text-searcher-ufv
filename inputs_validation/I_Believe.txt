They said you wouldnt make is so far uh uh  
And ever since they said it its been hard  
But never mind the nights you had to cry  
Cause you have never let it go inside  
You worked real hard  
And you know exactly what you want and need  
So believe and you can never give up  
You can reach your goals  
Just talk to your soul and say  
  
Chorus  
I believe I can I can  
I believe I will I will  
I believe I know my dreams are real know my dreams are real  
I believe Ill chant Oh yea  
I believe Ill dance  
I believe Ill grow real soon and Thats why  
That is what I do believe  
  
Your goals are just a thing in your soul uh uh  
And you know that your moves will let them show  
You keep creating pictures in your mind  
So just believe they will come true in time  
It will be fine  
Leave all of your cares and stress behind  
Just let it go  
Let the music flow inside  
Forget all your pain  
And just start to believe  
  
Chorus  
  
Never mind what people say  
Hold your head high and turn away  
With all our hopes and dreams  
I will believe  
Even though it seems its not for me  
I wont give up Ill keep it up  
Look into the sky  
I will achieve all my needs  
I will always believe  
  
Repeat x2  
I believe I can  
I believe I will I can  
I believe I know my dreams are real I got strength  
I believe Ill chant  
I believe Ill dance I gotta dance  
I believe Ill grow real soon and watch me watch me watch me  
That is what I do believe I do believe in me  
  
I believe I can  
I believe I will oh yea  
I believe I know my dreams are real  
I believe Ill chant  
I believe Ill dance I gotta dance  
I believe Ill grow real soon and  
That is what I do believe I do believe yayeeyay
