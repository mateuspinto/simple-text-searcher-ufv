Dear Santa Claus Its been so long  
So long since I have written  
Since as a kid in happy house I dwelled  
Ive moved from there and now I live  
On disillusion avenue  
And Ive been here longer than I care to tell  
  
The twinkling bells of hope and joy  
The laughter that rang in my voice  
Have silenced more and more as time goes by  
Those treasured gifts from other years  
Are tarnished lost or stained with tears  
So Santa would you bring a new supply  
  
Ill be hanging up my empty heart this Christmas  
Please fill it full with love and hope and cheer  
My faith is gone my courage low my patience ran out long ago  
Dear Santa Claus I need so much this year  
  
Bring a basket of forgetfulness to cover up the bitterness  
And the grudges that Ive gathered through the years  
And leave a large bag of forgiveness  
To give out to those who robbed me  
Of my laughter that sometimes filled my eyes with tears  
And Santa please a box piled high with love and understanding  
That I could share with all my neighbors and my friends  
And leave one new temper cause I lost mine  
Lost it one too many times  
And make the new one longer if you can  
  
Ill be hanging up my empty heart this Christmas  
Please fill it full with love and hope and cheer  
Tuck in some smiles to give away and some to wear for every day  
Dear Santa Claus I need so much this year  
  
Please Santa fill my empty heart this year
