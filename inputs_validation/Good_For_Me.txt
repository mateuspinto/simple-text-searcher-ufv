Where can I find the words to describe  
The way that I feel with you by my side  
Everyone can see that you are good for me  
I always dreamed some day Id find you  
Now I can put my arms around you  
And everyone agrees that you are good for me  
Yes I think I do deserve you  
Yes I think I really earned you  
And now it seems every cliche is true  
I can be good for you too  
Ill tell you a story of love lost and found  
Theres noone else for me now you are around  
And everyone can see that you are good for me  
Cut me adrift in the bluest of skies  
Im so close to heaven it was such a surprise  
Now everyone agrees that you are good for me  
Yes I think I do deserve you  
Yes I think I really earned you  
And now it seems every cliche is true  
I can be good for you too
