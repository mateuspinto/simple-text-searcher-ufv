You been laying it on the line  
Too much fat to burn  
You been stuck on a course  
While the world around you turns  
You been out in the rain  
But babe oh the sun still shines  
Well you might walk through a cloud  
Seek and you will find  
  
Seek and you will find  
  
Its like treading on thin ice  
Hot stones in your shoes  
Well you know the world can blow your mind  
Unless you got the guts to cut the fuse  
  
You been out on the streets  
And babe how the road does wind  
Well you might look straight ahead  
Seek and you will find  
  
Seek and you will find seek and you will find  
  
You been out on a limb  
And so many mountains to climb  
Well you just might be sitting on a rainbow honey  
Seek and you will find  
  
Seek and you will find
