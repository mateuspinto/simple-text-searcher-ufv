One never knows does one  
When love will come along  
Then so suddenly life turns out to be a song  
  
One never knows does one  
The moment or the place  
Then right before your eyes  
Someone occupies your embrace  
  
Someday look and youll find  
Two hearts were blest  
Someday fate may be kind  
Pray for the future  
Hope for the best  
One never knows does one  
  
Thats just the way it goes  
All at once you hear  
Hold me Caress me  
And then love may come  
But when one never knows
