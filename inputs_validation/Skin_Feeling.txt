I see some very nice skin out there  
  
I like the smell of that shop  
I like the way it serves me  
I like the pigment in your skin  
I like the way it moves me  
  
I like kids when theyre asleep  
Their little arms around you  
I like the way we play games  
Dont lose that skin feeling  
  
Im looking old Im feeling young  
Its the truth my child  
My second life has just begun  
With this hungry girl  
  
I like black and I like red  
I like that orange circle  
I like the things that you said  
When you were misbehaving  
  
I like the people on TV  
But no one looks like me  
I love you and you love me  
Dont lose that skin feeling  
  
Im looking old Im feeling young  
Its the truth my child  
My second life has just begun  
With this hungry girl  
  
I love the pigment in your skin  
I love the way it moves me  
I like the smell of that shot  
I like the way it serves me  
  
I like the things that you said  
When you were misbehaving  
I love you and you love me  
Dont lose that skin feeling  
  
Im looking old Im feeling young  
Its the truth my child  
My second life has just begun  
With this hungry girl  
  
Its the truth my child  
Let me hold your hand
