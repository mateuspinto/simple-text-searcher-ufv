Standing by the wayside begging for a ride  
I been waiting so long a year has gone  
Look at all the people strangers every one  
Ive been looking so long a year has gone  
  
You were all I lived for I guess my life is through  
Ive been living so long a year has gone  
Lonely Sunday morning rest in peace my love  
You been sleeping so long a year has gone  
  
How could I ever start to tell you  
The end is almost here  
The song of love is riding in my ears  
Playing loud playing clear  
The song will never change  
The memory will always be so near  
  
Standing by the wayside begging for a ride  
I been waiting so long a year has gone  
Look at all the people strangers every one  
Ive been looking so long a year has gone
