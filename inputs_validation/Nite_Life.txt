When shadows fall the day is done  
The mountain tops hide the setting sun  
The magic of the night is here for all young lovers far and near  
  
Night life ooh la la la stars coming out to play  
Night life rah rah rah rah  
See how they light the milky way  
At the end of day mmm night life  
  
Night life aye aye aye aye look at the moon above  
Night life ma ma ma ma its time to fall in love  
Yeah so come on mmm night life  
  
Night life no need to be blue  
The moon and the stars are belong to you  
Night life is so much fun when youre in love and love is young  
  
Night life tra la la la laughing and painting the town  
Night life ha ha ha ha its just a merry go round  
When the sun goes down mmm night life
