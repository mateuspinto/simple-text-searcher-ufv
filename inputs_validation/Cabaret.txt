What good is sitting alone in your room  
But come hear the music play  
Life is a cabaret old chum Come to the cabaret  
  
Put down the knitting the book and the broom  
It is time for a holiday  
Life is a cabaret old chum Come to the cabaret  
  
Come taste the wine Come hear the band  
Come blow that horn Start celebrating  
Right this way your tables waiting  
  
What goods committing prophet of doom  
To wipe every smile away  
Life is a cabaret old chum So come to the cabaret
