When I was just a little wee lad  
I hopped on the lap of my dear old dad  
Something jumped and poked me good  
That he said just me morning wood  
A little tin soldiers marchin by  
Sergeant major unzips his fly  
Pulls his weapon from his camouflage pants  
Slaps away til it starts to dance  
A shootin stars above my bed  
Changin colors of my mushroom head  
A rainbow jizz flys across the room  
Little white spermies meet their doom  
Ah The amazing Willy Wanker  
Aaaah The amazing Willy Wanker  
And my scrotum sack he says  
Lalalalalala tickle me  
Little green men from outer space  
Here to exterminate the human race  
Drop their ray guns and retreat to their ships  
When marshmallow sauce squirts from me tip  
Like a knight of olden Camelot  
The goo takes off like an arrow shot  
Gwynevere drops to her knees and begs  
For the spittin dragon between me legs  
Im using my thing for what its for  
Gentle knock upon me door  
Mumsy drops her cup of tea  
When she sees my wank standing tall and free  
Ah The one and only Willy Wanker  
Aaaaah Here comes Willy Wanker  
And my marble sack he says  
Lalalalalala tickle me  
Rasberry scones and marmalade  
Squeezing my squid in the evening shine  
Visions of mermaids in the sky  
Shooting my load in me own left eye  
Gramps was a hero in the first World War  
But he aint got no dick no more  
Comes home smokin from the corner pub  
Makes poor old Gramsy kiss his nub  
The world spins around like a big bass drum  
Nanny pops a pinkie in the generals bum  
The Irish dance and the Scotsmem howl  
Time to clean up with the washroom towel  
Ah yeah Its only Willy Wanker yeah  
Ah The lonely Willy Wanker  
And my wrinkled sack he says  
Lalalalalala tickle me
