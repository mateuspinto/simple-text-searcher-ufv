Im stuck in this bed you made  
Alone with a sinking feeling  
I saw through the words you said  
To the secrets youve been keeping  
Its written upon your face  
All the lies how they cut so deeply  
You cant get enough you take  
And take and take and never say  
  
No youve gotta get it inside  
You push it back down  
You push it back down  
No youll never get it inside  
Push it back down black out blood in your eye  
  
You say that its not your fault  
And swear that I am mistaken  
You said its not what it seems  
No remorse for the trust youre breaking  
You run but then back you fall  
Suffocate in the mess youre making  
You cant get enough you take  
And take and take and take and take  
Fuck it are you listening  
  
No youve gotta get it inside  
You push it back down  
You push it back down  
No youll never get it inside  
Push it back down  
You push it back down  
No youve gotta get it inside  
You push it back down  
You push it back down  
No youll never get it inside  
Push it back down  
Black out blood in your eye  
  
Floating down as colors fill the light  
We look up from the ground  
In fields of paper white  
And floating up you pass us in the night  
A future gazing out a past to overwrite  
So come down far below  
Weve been waiting to collect the things you know  
Come down far below  
Weve been waiting to collect what youve let go  
  
Come down  
Oh  
Come down  
Oh  
Come down  
Oh  
Come down  
Oh  
Come down  
Oh
