What I dream I had dressed in organdy  
Clothed in crinoline of smoky Burgundy  
Softer than the rain  
  
I wandered empty streets down past the shop displays  
I heard cathedral bells tripping down the alley ways  
As I walked on  
  
And when you ran to me your cheeks flushed with the night  
We walked on frosted fields of juniper and lamplight  
I held your hand  
  
And when I awoke and felt you warm and near  
I kissed your honey hair with my grateful tears  
Oh I love you girl  
  
Oh I love you
