english translation by jorge calderon  
My personal revenge will be the right  
Of our children in the schools and in the gardens  
My personal revenge will be to give you  
This song which has flourished without panic  
My personal revenge will be to show you  
The kindness in the eyes of my people  
Who have always fought relentlessly in battle  
And been generous and firm in victory  
My personal revenge will be to tell you good morning  
On a street without beggars or homeless  
When instead of jailing you I suggest  
You shake away the sadness there that blinds you  
And when you who have applied your hands in torture  
Are unable to look up at what surrounds you  
My personal revenge will be to give you  
These hands that once you so mistreated  
But have failed to take away their tenderness  
It was the people who hated you the most  
When rage became the language of their song  
And underneath the skin of this town today  
Its heart has been scarred forevermore  
It was the people who hated you the most  
When rage became the language of their song  
And underneath the skin of this town today  
Its heart has been scarred forevermore  
And underneath the skin of this town today  
Red and black its hearts been scarred  
Forevermore
