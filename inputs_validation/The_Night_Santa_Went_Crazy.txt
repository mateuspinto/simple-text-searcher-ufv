Down in the workshop all the elves were making toys  
For the good Gentile girls and the good Gentile boys  
When the boss busted in nearly scared em half to death  
Had a rifle in his hands and cheap whiskey on his breath  
From his beard to his boots he was covered with ammo  
Like a big fat drunk disgruntled Yuletide Rambo  
And he smiled as he said with a twinkle in his eye  
Merry Christmas to all now youre all gonna die  
  
The night Santa went crazy  
The night St Nick went insane  
Realized hed been gettin the raw deal  
Something finally must have snapped in his brain  
  
Well the workshop is gone now he decided to bomb it  
Everywhere youll find pieces of Cupid and Comet  
And he tied up his helpers and he held the elves hostage  
And he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage  
He got Dancer and Prancer with an old German Luger  
And he slashed up Dasher just like Freddie Krueger  
And he picked up a flamethrower and he barbecued Blitzen  
And he took a big bite and said It tastes just like chicken  
  
The night Santa went crazy  
The night Kris Kringle went nuts  
Now you can hardly walk around the North Pole  
Without stepping in reindeer guts  
  
Theres the National Guard and the F B I  
Theres a van from the Eyewitness News  
And helicopters circling around in the sky  
And the bullets are flying the body counts rising  
And everyones dyin to know oh Santa why  
My my my my my my  
You used to be such a jolly guy  
  
Yes Virginia now Santas doing time  
In a federal prison for his infamous crime  
Hey little friend now dont you cry no more tears  
Hell be out with good behavior in seven hundred more years  
But now Vixens in therapy and Donners still nervous  
And the elves all got jobs working for the postal service  
And they say Mrs Claus shes on the phone every night  
With her lawyer negotiating the movie rights  
  
Theyre talkin bout  
The night Santa went crazy  
The night St Nicholas flipped  
Broke his back for some milk and cookies  
Sounds to me like he was tired of getting gypped  
  
Wooh the night Santa went crazy  
The night St Nick went insane  
Realized hed been gettin a raw deal  
Something finally must have snapped in his brain  
Wooh something finally must have snapped in his brain  
Tell ya something finally must have snapped in his brain
