Uneasy feeling burning out my eyes  
I hope the end is less painful than my life  
I stand on trial before the gods  
On Judgment Day  
A blink of an eye between  
The cradle and the grave  
One last look at visions of flesh  
The last best hope of man on earth  
Pontius Pilate still washing his hands  
The world dont want to be saved  
Only left alone  
Elysian Fields  
We are storming the heavens  
To raise our swords and shields  
We ascend to our destiny  
To the Elysian Fields  
Soaring to the sun  
With blood upon their wings  
Superstitious dust left twisting in the wind  
Man still has one belief  
One decree that stands alone  
The laying down of arms  
Is like cancer to their bones
