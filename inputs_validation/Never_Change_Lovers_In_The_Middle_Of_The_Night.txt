You and I were finished  
I was through with you  
Splitting up forever  
Seemed the thing to do  
I said I cant stand you  
With your honey touch  
This time you were cheating me  
One time too much  
Just then I remembered  
That a friend I knew  
Told me one thing  
I should never do  
Never never change your lovers in the middle of the night  
Everything may look so different in the early morning light  
Never never be too hasty when youre groping in the dark  
What youre getting into may be just a lark  
Keep your cool and dont change lovers when youre feeling sorta high  
Sorta big and high and mighty without really knowing why  
Let your heat wear off a little give your man another chance  
And dont fall for someone elses song and dance  
Sure there was this guy  
Right next to me  
Mine just for the asking  
He said he would be  
But to leave my man  
Seemed to me all too strange  
And Id say that Im glad  
I didnt make the change  
Now our life is almost  
Like a Paradise  
Let me pass on to you  
This advice  
Keep your cool and dont change lovers in the middle of the night  
You may feel a strong temptation the vibrations may be right  
But who knows whats gonna happen you may simply lose your cool  
When you find it youll find out you were a fool  
Never never change your lovers under any midnight spell  
Take it easy slow and easy everything will turn out well  
Let the sunshine of a new day and dont move while youre uptight  
Changing lovers in the middle of the night  
Never never change your lovers in the middle of the night  
Everything may look so different in the early morning light  
Never never be too hasty when youre groping in the dark  
What youre getting into may be just a lark  
Keep your cool and dont change lovers when youre feeling sorta high  
Sorta big and high and mighty without really knowing why  
Let your heat wear off a little give your man another chance  
And dont fall for someone elses song and dance
