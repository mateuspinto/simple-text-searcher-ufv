Down the road came a Junco Partner  
For he was loaded as can be  
He was knocked out knocked out loaded  
He was awobblin all over the street  
  
Singing six months aint no sentence  
And one year aint no time  
I was born in Angola  
Serving fourteen to ninety nine  
  
Well I wish I had me a million dollars  
Oh one million to call my own  
I would raise meat and say grow for me baby  
I would raise me a tobacco farm  
  
Well I wish I would have me a great deal of money  
Yeah and mighty good things all over town  
Now I aint got no more money  
All of my good friends are putting me down  
  
So now I gotta pawn my rifle and pistol  
Yeah Im gonna pawn my watch and chain  
I would have pawned my seat Gabriella  
But the smart girl she wouldnt sign her name  
  
Give me headstone when I die
