Start with vanity  
Arrogance and greed  
Panic is my obsession  
No one can escape  
  
The thrill is much too great  
Despair is my creation  
Everything obscene  
Emanates from me  
  
Homicide is on the rise  
It all begins now  
Take your final bow  
The camera never lies  
  
Action torture misery  
Endless suffering  
Torment agony  
  
Captured for eternity  
Action  
Youre the main attraction  
  
Torture misery  
Endless suffering  
Pleasing to the eye  
To this you cant deny  
  
No one else around  
Razor wire bound  
Insanity is so near  
Heart begins to seize  
  
Watch you atrophy  
Reality is now clear  
Take a look inside  
Many more have died  
  
The internets an open door  
Everyone can see  
Dying brutally  
The audience begs for more  
  
Action torture misery  
Endless suffering  
Torment agony  
  
Captured for eternity  
Action  
Youre the main attraction  
  
Torture misery  
Endless suffering  
Pleasing to the eye  
To this you cant deny  
  
Murder is my future  
Killing is my future  
Murder is my future  
Killing is my future  
  
Torture misery  
Endless suffering  
Pleasing to the eye  
To this you cant deny  
  
Murder is my future  
Killing is my future  
Murder is my future  
Killing is my future  
  
Murder is my future  
Killing is my future  
Murder is my future  
Killing is my future  
  
Murder is my future
