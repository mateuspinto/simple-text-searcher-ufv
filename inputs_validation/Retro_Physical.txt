We gonna grab them highs and get em off the wall  
So everybody in here can start smokin

We gonna grab them highs and get em off the wall  
So everybody in here can start smokin  
  
Lets get into trouble  
Lots of trouble  
Rock star  
You know how to rock hard  
Hello midnight loverlover  
Hold that lady tighter  
Shoot that bullet through her  
  
My heart beats just like a cherry soda  
In the summer  
Go go go  
Dont be difficult about it  
Get off it  
  
Off the walls get your ass  
Off the walls do that girl  
Dont stumble  
Retro physical  
Off the walls get your ass  
Off the walls move that boy  
So sexual  
Retro physical
