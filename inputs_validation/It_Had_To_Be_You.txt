It had to be you  
It had to be you  
Ive wandered around  
Finally found somebody who  
Could make me be true  
Whoa whoa whoa could make me be blue  
And even be glad just to be sad thinkin of you  
  
Some others Ive seen might never be mean  
Might never be cross  
Or try to be boss  
But they wouldnt do  
For nobody else gave me a thrill  
With all your faults I love you still  
It had to be you  
Wonderful you  
It had to be you  
  
Cause nobody else gave me a thrill  
With all yo faults  
I love you still now  
And it had to be you  
It just had to be you  
It had to be you
