I can feel no sense of measure  
No illusions as we take  
Refuge in young mans pleasure  
Breaking down the dreams we make real  
  
One down one to go  
Another town and one more show  
Downtown theyre giving away  
But she never came back  
  
No phone can take your place  
Do you know what I mean  
We have the same intrigue  
As a court of kings  
  
Ah leave it ah leave it  
Dit dit dit dit dit dit dit  
Doot doot doot doot doot doot doot  
  
Two down there you go  
McArthur Park in the driving snow  
Uptown theyre digging it out  
Better lay your claim  
  
Get home youre not alone  
You just broke out of the danger zone  
Be there to show your face  
On another dreamy day  
  
Ah leave it ah leave it  
Dit dit dit dit dit dit dit  
Doot doot doot doot doot doot doot  
  
Goodbye goodbye goodbye bad  
Leave it  
Hello hello heaven  
  
Goodbye goodbye goodbye bad  
Leave it  
Hello hello heaven  
  
I can feel no sense of measure  
No illusions as we take  
Refuge in young mans pleasure  
Breaking down the dreams we make real  
  
Ah leave it ah leave it  
  
Goodbye goodbye goodbye bad  
Leave it  
Hello hello heaven  
  
Goodbye goodbye goodbye bad  
Leave it  
Hello hello heaven
