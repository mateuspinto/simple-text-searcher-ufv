I just want to be with you  
No matter what they say  
Just want to be with you  
Every night and every day  
Cold nights dark days  
I want to be with you  
  
I just want to be with you  
Till the final curtain falls  
Just want to be with you  
Then know nothing at all  
Cold nights dark days  
I want to be with you  
want to be with you  
  
I know theres a price to pay  
For doing what we do  
But I just want to be with you  
Just want to be with you  
  
Dont want to hold you down  
Whatever that you do  
Shine on sweet angel  
cause I just want to be with you  
I want to be with you
