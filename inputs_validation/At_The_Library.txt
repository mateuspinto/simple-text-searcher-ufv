Hey there lookin at me  
Tell me what do you see  
But you quickly turn your head away  
Try to find the words I could use  
Dont have the courage to come up to you  
My chance is looking a bit gray  
  
Chorus  
Staring across the room  
Are you leaving soon  
I just need a little time  
  
What is it that drives me mad  
Girls like you that I never had  
What is it about you that I adore  
What makes me go so insane  
That makes me feel so much pain  
What is it about you that I adore  
  
Chorus  
  
Why did you have to leave so soon  
Why did you have to walk away  
Oh well it happened again  
She walked away with her boyfriend  
Maybe well meet again some day
