Inequity solace in your driven sate  
Seize your right to earn the same  
She wants it  
How long must we wait  
  
Before they take our side  
Sordid practice engine overheated  
Theres no way to cool  
Turned up on your side  
  
The one that you choose  
Why should they mind  
Scared of what your thinking  
A strong resistant  
  
Sunday feeling under weight  
Of whats to come  
Tired of living under thumb  
She wonders why did you say what you said  
  
Silently living is death  
Shout him down its worth it  
No compromises on this  
Turned up on your side  
  
The one that you choose  
Why should they mind  
Scared of what your thinking  
Scared of what your thinking  
  
She wonders  
How long have we been senseless  
So tired and pensive  
Instead of stand up  
  
Stand to the side  
Feel a strong resistant
