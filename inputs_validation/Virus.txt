Theres an evil virus thats threatening mankind  
Not state of the art a serious state of the mind  
The muggers the backstabbers the two faced elite  
A menace to society a social disease  
  
Rape of the mind is a social disorder  
The cynics the apathy oneupmanship order  
  
Watching beginnings of social decay  
Gloating or sneering at lifes disarray  
Eating away at your own self esteem  
Pouncing on every word that you might be saying  
  
Rape of the mind is a social disorder  
The cynics the apathy oneupmanship order  
  
Superficially smiling a shake of the hand  
As soon as the back is turned treachery is planned  
  
Rape of the mind is a social disorder  
The cynics the apathy oneupmanship order  
  
Watching beginnings of social decay  
Gloating or sneering at lifes disarray  
  
When every good things laid to waste  
By all the jealousy and hate  
By all the acid wit and rapier lies  
  
And every time you think youre safe  
And when you go to turn away  
You know theyre sharpening all their paper knives  
  
All in your mind  
All in your head  
Try to relate it  
  
All in your mind  
All in your head  
Try to escape it  
  
Without a conscience they destroy  
And thats a thing that they enjoy  
Theyre a sickness thats in all our minds  
  
They want to sink the ship and leave  
The way they laugh at you and me  
You know it happens all the time  
  
All in your mind  
All in your head  
Try to relate it  
  
All in your mind  
All in your head  
Try to escape it  
  
The rats in the cellar you know who you are  
Or do you  
  
Watching beginnings of social decay
