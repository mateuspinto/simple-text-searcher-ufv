Down the trail of achin hearts where nobodys hidin their tears  
You sent me there where sadness starts down the trail of achin hearts  
You told me I was your darling you kept me hanging around  
Somebody else is your darling now lonesome and blue Ill be found  
Down the trail  
 guitar   
Once I was passing your window under the light of a star  
Somebody else played my love song and played it on my old guitar  
Down the trail
