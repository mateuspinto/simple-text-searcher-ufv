A thousand cities in the night  
Each one waiting for the light  
Ten million people plan their day  
As the sun still burns away  
  
As the earth just spins in space  
People plan their daily race  
As the sun still burns away  
Few say Thank you for the day  
All the people in their ties  
Forget to look up at the sky  
they exist another day  
As the sun still burns away  
  
I wonder just how long well last  
When the final die is cast  
Every day brings forth the time  
When the sun forgets to shine
