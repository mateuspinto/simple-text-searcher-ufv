Come home to me  
Come home to me  
Back into my arms  
Home where you belong  
Come home to me  
Come home to me  
If home is where you are  
Then home is way too far away  
  
Tv light of blue and white  
Just cant fall asleep at night  
Move over to the space where you should be  
Even half way seem so far  
Over mountains and diamond stars  
Everybody has their own way home  
  
Come home to me  
Come home to me  
Back into my arms  
Home where you belong  
Come home to me  
  
Come home to me  
If home is where you are  
Home is way too far away  
  
All my life Ive dreamed of love  
Never thought it would hurt this much  
To kiss goodbye and wait for your return  
So Ill be strong and hold on to  
A picture and a thought of you  
Getting all the love that you deserve  
  
So come home to me  
Come home to me  
Back into my arms  
Home where you belong  
Come home to me  
Come home to me  
If home is where you are  
Home is way too far away  
  
If home is where you are  
Then home is way too far away
