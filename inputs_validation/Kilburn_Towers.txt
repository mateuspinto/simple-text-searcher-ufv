I am a bird watch me go drifting by  
With my feathers of power I laugh as the hours go slowly by  
That could mean everything  
I am a street watching the people walk  
As I listen their conversations glisten as they start to talk  
Then I hear everything  
  
Little white jug me and Kilburn Towers  
As we sit on the hill and we drink and we swill  
Till the early hours  
Then I am everything  
Little white jug and me and Kilburn Towers  
  
That could mean everything  
  
Little white jug me and Kilburn Towers  
As we sit on the hill and we drink and we swill  
Till the early hours  
Then I am everything  
  
Little white jug and me and Kilburn Towers Repeat x4
