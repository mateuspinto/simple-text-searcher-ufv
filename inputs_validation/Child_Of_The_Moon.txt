The wind blows rain into my face  
The sun glows at the end of the highway  
Child of the moon rub your rainy eyes  
Oh child of the moon  
Give me a wideawake crescentshaped smile  
  
She shivers by the light she is hidden  
She flickers like a lamp lady vision  
Child of the moon rub your rainy eyes  
Child of the moon  
Give me a wideawake crescentshaped smile  
  
The first car on the foggy road riding  
The last star for my lady is pining  
Oh child of the moon bid the sun arise  
Oh child of the moon  
Give me a misty day pearly gray silver silky faced  
Wideawake crescentshaped smile
