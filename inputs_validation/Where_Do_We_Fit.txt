Same when I left you  
Now the same upon return  
As your pages flip over  
You seem to let them burn  
You drink from the bottle  
That stole your friend  
Your friend  
Your friend  
Now the seasons  
They come and they go  
I watch the blossoms  
As the bees take their own  
I peer through the water  
That floods my eyes  
My eyes  
My eyes  
I want you in my life  
I feel I need you in my life  
But I cant have you  
Not tonight  
Not these days  
Not these days  
Not these days  
Not these days  
I watch our children  
As they play in the sand  
Speaking those words  
That only you can understand  
I know inside of you  
You feel that they are gold  
You know theres time  
They are not yet old  
They want you in their lives  
I feel they need you in their lives  
But they cant have you  
Not tonight  
Not these days  
Not these days  
Not these days  
Not these days  
I hope these things  
They come alive inside you  
And you recognise  
I hope these things  
They come alive and bite you  
In the night  
I see you standing with each child  
And laughing  
As you feed their smiles  
I hope these things  
They come alive and bite you  
In the night  
Because we  
We need you  
In our lives  
Because we  
We need you  
In our lives  
Because these days are  
These days are nothing  
Tell me where do we fit in  
These days are  
These days are nothing  
Tell me where do we fit in
