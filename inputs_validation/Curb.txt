Have I gone all too far  
Have I been here before  
If I have let me know  
How it goes  
Take her place  
And I will  
See her face  
No reason  
Let it slide  
And I will  
Watch her die  
To run through fields  
To find and I will  
Hold then lead then lie  
And I willno I wont  
  
Is it now really time  
Can I just give mine if  
I can simply trade  
Deal made  
  
Take her place  
And I will  
See her face  
No reason  
Let it slide  
And I will  
  
Watch her die  
To run through fields  
To find and I will  
Hold then lead then lie  
And I willno I wont  
  
Run hide away from me  
Desouled to seek decide  
And I will no I wont  
  
Run through fields to find  
Hold then lead then lie  
And I will  
Run desouled and  
Hold to heal to find  
And I cant
