Feel the wind burn through my skin  
The pain the air is killing me  
For years my limbs stretched to the sky  
A nest for birds to sit and sing  
  
But now my branches suffer  
And my leaves dont bear the glow  
They did so long ago  
  
One day I was full of life  
My sap was rich and I was strong  
From seed to tree I grew so tall  
Through wind and rain I could not fall  
  
But now my branches suffer  
And my leaves dont offer  
Poetry to men of song  
  
Trees like me werent meant to live  
If all this world can give  
Pollution and slow death  
  
Oh Lord I lay me down  
No lifes left to be found  
Theres nothing left for me  
  
Trees like me werent meant to live  
If all this earth can give  
Is pollution  
  
Trees like me werent meant to live  
Oh Lord I lay me down  
If all this earth can give  
My branches to the ground  
Is pollution and slow death  
Theres nothing left for me  
  
Oh Lord I lay me down  
My branches to the ground  
Theres nothing left for me
