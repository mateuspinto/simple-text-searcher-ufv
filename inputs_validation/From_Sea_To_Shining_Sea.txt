The beautiful spacious skies the amber waves of grain  
To the majestic purple mountains above the fruited plain  
God did shed His grace from sea to shining sea on you and on me  
From Sleepy Hollow mountain country to the swamps of Okefenokee  
To Guthrie Oklahoma to Hibbing Minnesota  
To Grants Pass Oregon to Stone Pipe Wells California  
From Texas to Montana from California to Maine  
In the sunny days the winter snow from Arizona sand  
To Cherokee North Carolina to Tarpen Springs Florida  
America its time to be refreshed recalled to memory  
God did shed His grace on Thee from sea to shining sea  
The land is big the best is free  
Sand and surf grass and tree from sea to shining sea  
God shed His grace on me  
And crown Thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea
