This is not natural  
A bunch of holes where the dead used to be underground  
Forget supernatural  
Cause all those resting in peace are out walking the streets  
Yeah with no heartbeat  
  
Chorus  
Across the sky they can hear you on the other side  
A scream thats loud enough to wake the dead  
And all alone you bought tickets for the nightmare as you wake the dead  
  
Oh this is not possible  
An empty hole in your chest where your heart used to beat  
Does this mean what I think it means  
How could both you and me be about as dead as we could be  
Yeah with no heartbeat  
  
Chorus  
  
Take a walk with me  
Walk with the dead  
Cause you knew that wed have to die sometime  
Well darling tonight could be  
  
Let your voice shred miles of diamond skies  
Just to walk as they wake in the darkness yeah  
Well darling tonight could be a beautiful night to die  
A beautiful night to die yeah  
  
Wake the dead  
Fuck it youre dead  
Wake the dead  
Fuck it youre dead  
Wake the dead  
Wake the dead  
  
Across the sky they can hear you  
A scream thats loud enough to wake the dead  
And all alone you bought tickets for the nightmare as you wake the dead  
Wake the dead  
  
Across the sky they can hear you on the other side  
A scream thats loud enough to wake the dead  
And all alone you bought tickets for the nightmare as you wake the dead  
Wake the dead  
Wake the dead  
Wake the dead  
Wake the dead  
Wake the dead
