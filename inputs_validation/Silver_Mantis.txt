Seito lived in the canyon of the dragons Sashiko lived in the valley of the
moon  
They met along the highway to Aomeri where danger in the forest loomed  
Shashiko dressed in silks and dreamed of heroes  
She was carried in a hammock draped and veiled  
Her father was a cruel and brutal warlord who fearful kept her in a shell  
Seito he was but a lowly servant but his master knew him to be true and brave  
When he happened on the scene of her education he sent her captors to their
graves  
Seito guarded Sashiko to her palace he had no thought of ransom to conceal  
She took him in and washed his cuts and bruises and laid him softly down to
sleep  
When morning came she rose to tell her father  
Of the stranger who had ruined the kidnap plot  
But jealous and enraged her father seized him and chained him in the dungeon
dark  
Sashikos tears flowed like the river Edo as she pleaded Seitos freedom face
to floor  
But the warlord turned his back and would not hear her  
His mercy withered years before  
When night fell she crept down into the dungeon  
Two daggers hidden underneath her coat  
And there they slept in death by harakiri her fathers chains around them both
