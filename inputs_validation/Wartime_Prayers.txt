Prayers offered in times of peace are silent conversations  
Appeals for love or loves release  
In private invocations  
But all that is changed now  
Gone like a memory from the day before the fires  
People hungry for the voice of God  
Hear lunatics and liars  
Wartime prayers wartime prayers  
In every language spoken  
For every family scattered and broken  
  
Because you cannot walk with the holy  
If youre just a halfway decent man  
I dont pretend that Im a mastermind  
With a genius marketing plan  
Im trying to tap into some wisdom  
Even a little drop will do  
I want to rid my heart of envy  
And cleanse my soul of rage  
Before Im through  
  
Times are hard its a hard time  
But everybody knows all about hard times  
The thing is what are you gonna do  
Well you cry and try to muscle through  
Try to rearrange your stuff  
But when the wounds are deep enough  
Its all that we can bear  
We wrap ourselves in prayer  
  
Because you cannot walk with the holy  
If youre just a halfway decent man  
I dont pretend that Im a mastermind  
With a genius marketing plan  
Im trying to tap into some wisdom  
Even a little drop willdo  
I want to rid my heart of envy  
And cleanse my soul of rage  
Before Im through  
A mother murmurs in twilight sleep  
And draws her babies closer  
With hushabyes for sleepy eyes  
And kisses on the shoulder  
To drive away despair  
She says a wartime prayer
