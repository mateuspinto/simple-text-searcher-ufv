In a while in a word  
Every moment now returns  
For a while seen or heard  
How each memory softly burns  
Facing you who brings me new tomorrows  
I thank God for yesterdays  
How they led me to this very hour  
How they led me to this place  
Every touch every smile  
You have given me in care  
Keep in heart always Ill  
Now be treasuring everywhere  
And if life should come to just one question  
Do I hold this moment true  
No trace of sadness  
Always with gladness  
I DO  
instrumental  
Now a song that speaks of now and ever  
Beckons me to someone new  
Unexpected unexplored unseen  
Filled with promise coming through  
In a while in a word  
You and I forever change  
Love so clear never blurred  
Has me feeling wondrous strange  
And if life should come to just one question  
Do I face each moment true  
No trace of sadness always with gladness  
I DO  
Never with sadness  
Always with gladness
