Great Granddad when the land was young  
Barred the door with a wagon tongue  
For the times was rough and the redskins mocked  
And he said his prayers with his shotgun cocked  
  
Twentyone children came to bless  
The old mans home in the wilderness  
They slept on the floor with the dogs and the cats  
And they hunted in the woods in their coonskin caps  
  
Great Granddad was a busy man  
Cooked his grub in a frying pan  
He picked his teeth with his hunting knife  
And he wore the same suit all his life
