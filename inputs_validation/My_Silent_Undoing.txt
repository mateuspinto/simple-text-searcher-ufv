My silent undoing  
My silent undoing  
My silent undoing  
My silent undoing  
My wasp in a jar  
Protruding hips  
And skull and spine  
Ribcage cuts a clear outline  
Oh oh  
All roped up and pinching in  
Distorted and disfiguring  
Oh oh  
My silent undoing  
My silent undoing  
My wasp in a jar  
No photographs around the back  
Emaciated iron flat  
Oh oh  
Dehydrated cutting bones  
Today Im over 7 stone  
Oh oh  
My wasp in a jar  
My wasp in a jar  
My wasp in a jar  
Twinkle little star  
My wasp in a jar
