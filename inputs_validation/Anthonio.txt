Oh Anthonio  
Its been nearly one year since  
Our Rio  
Nights of forever  
Pictures of you and me  
Dancing and memories  
  
Through the masquerade  
You led me by the hand  
Whispered the words  
This Is Forever  
Said from the silver tongue  
Thats where it started from  
  
Oh Anthonio  
My Anthonio  
Was I ever more than just a face in the crowd  
Did you even know my name  
Did you ever really care  
  
Oh Anthonio  
My Anthonio  
Do you ever wonder why  
Or where I am now  
Do you ever feel ashamed  
Do you even feel a thing  
  
Oh  
  
There I was under stars  
Hearts made in the sand  
Lying from the boy  
From Ipanema  
Tide comes rushing in  
Time and time again  
  
Now that summer has gone  
Where did you run  
All my letters are  
Returned to sender  
For eternity  
Youre a part of me  
  
Oh Anthonio  
My Anthonio  
Was I ever more than just a face in the crowd  
Did you even know my name  
Did you ever really care  
  
Oh Anthonio  
My Anthonio  
Do you ever wonder why  
Or where I am now  
Do you ever feel ashamed  
Do you even feel a thing  
  
Oh  
  
Oh Anthonio  
My Anthonio  
You got everything you ever wanted from me  
I was just another girl  
It was just another night  
  
Oh Anthonio  
My Anthonio  
There is only one thing  
That Im trying to say  
It may come as a suprise  
My baby has your eyes
