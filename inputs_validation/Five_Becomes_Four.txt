Needed some time  
So I could find  
A little strength to redefine  
What Ive become  
What I have done  
I never asked to be the one  
  
Im riding it out  
This storm that you brought in  
Bringing it down only around  
For you I go again  
Its got to be easy to see  
What everyone takes out of me  
Knocking me down dragging me out  
How did you end up in that crowd  
  
Chorus  
Did you run away Did you fall apart  
Do you see yourself for what you are  
Will you be looking for it anymore  
When five becomes four  
When youre all alone with the melody  
Do you close your eyes and think of me  
Will you still hear me singing anymore  
When five becomes four  
  
Try and put aside  
Your history and pride  
Maybe for one moment in time  
Well all be on your side  
The story goes nobody knows  
What it was like when you were through  
Someone who cared out in the air  
It went and crashed down anywhere  
  
Chorus  
  
Remember the line never say die  
You were the reason I survived  
Where did you go I need to know  
I waited here you never showed  
Its gonna be harder for me  
I cant forgive so many things  
When you werent there I was around  
Why would you try and hurt me now  
Just tell me why  
Just tell me why  
  
Did you run away  
Did you run away  
  
Did you run away Did you fall apart  
Do you see yourself for what you are  
Will you be looking for it anymore  
When five becomes four  
When you are all alone with the melody  
Do you close your eyes and think of me  
Will you still hear me singing anymore  
When five becomes four  
When five becomes four  
When five becomes four
