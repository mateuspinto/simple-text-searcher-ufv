Chorus  
Every boy and girl woman and man  
When you feel youve done about the best you can  
Motherfuck the wagon come join the band  
Vibrate vibrate higher Repeat  
  
Sometimes when its late at night  
And you have no one to talk to  
Heres what you don you go through that  
Raggedy cell phone bout two or three times  
Tracy aint home Tina aint home  
The Love Below start talkin to ya  
  
Chorus  
  
The circumcision has already begun  
Desensitizing the very thing or thang that Brought you into this motherfucker
in the first place  
And when I say motherfucker I do mean motherfucker  
Because Mother Earth is dying  
And we continue to fuck her death  
Play with your own score sheet  
Become the master of your own  
And Yes God is watching you  
But no need to be embarrassed  
For the future is in your hands  
No the future is in your hand  
Play with your own score sheet  
  
Chorus
