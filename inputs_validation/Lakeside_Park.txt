Midway hawkers calling  
Try your luck with me  
Merrygoround wheezing  
The same old melody  
A thousand ten cent wonders  
Who could ask for more  
A pocketful of silver  
The key to heavens door  
  
Lakeside Park  
Willows in the breeze  
Lakeside Park  
So many memories  
Laughing rides  
Midway lights  
Shining stars on summer nights  
  
Days of barefoot freedom  
Racing with the waves  
Nights of starlit secrets  
Crackling driftwood flames  
Drinking by the lighthouse  
Smoking on the pier  
Still we saw the magic  
Was fading every year  
  
Everyone would gather  
On the twentyfourth of May  
Sitting in the sand  
To watch the fireworks display  
Dancing fires on the beach  
Singing songs together  
Though its just a memory  
Some memories last forever
