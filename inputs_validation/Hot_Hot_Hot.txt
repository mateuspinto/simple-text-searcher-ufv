Uh uh uh uh uh yeah yeah yeah  
uh uh uh  
  
I was swerving thru Queens  
Fully growin benz  
Searching for the butta thru my cartier lense system  
Banging out nothing but the blends on the digital startec  
Rappin to my mens  
Then spotted the most exotic cheekiness half Rachel half Holly  
My shit is  
The slo mo crept up nice and slow  
Breathin on my ice so it shine real nice  
Crease my scar peice  
Laid back in my seat  
Right near Bazely projects on the back streets  
Her name was Keisha full of street knowledge  
Pumped a little trees but she planned to go to college  
Staring at my ice smellin my cologne  
She lived on the southside so bring things on  
Honey got flavour and it just dont stop  
Does she want me for me or me for my rocks  
  
Your carmake me hot hot hot  
You just make me just hot hot hot

They make me hot hot hot  
Baby boy dont stop stop stop  
You keep me hot hot hot  
Im a take you for all youve got  
Baby girl just stop stop stop  
Check this out uh  
  
She slid up my whip like the queen of New York  
We jetted to city island to eat shrimp and talk  
Sourced up my keys to the valet cat  
I glanced at the fatty Im a see about that  
We blazed in the spizza like Bonnie and Clyde  
Scooby dooby hizza  
Im feeling the vibe cop the blue for some video type shit  
Knowing all along how hot these kind of nights get uh  
Ive got her right where I want her  
Reality about to creep up on her  
Stroke her softly gently with my G  
While the light reflects off my icp  
Waiter ice the crystal let it simmer  
Lights to bright heres a grand make them dimmer  
I kept fronting and I just couldnt stop  
I dont mind spending paper when its looking that hot  
  
Your car makes me hot hot hot  
You just make me just hot hot hot  
I Iike youre rocks rocks rocks  
They make me hot hot hot  
Baby boy just dont stop stop stop  
You keep me hot hot hot

Baby girl just stop stop stop

You burst out of semi  
She pulled down the staps to her dress  
Reached in the  sparked up sess  
Banging some Wu Tang feeling the   
She said Now would you wanna sell your soul for chips  
and give up girl to push whips  
Never miss some spiritual down to my bone  
Why you takin jumbo in that zone  
She said I would do anthing for   
Give deep  to  man coats  
Take off my   
Drop to my knees  
Talking in my face  
Breath smelling like cheese  
I asked her  
Shorty you degrade yourself  
Just to throw a little bit of ice on the shelf  
You turnin me off I cant lie  
Keisha said why  
I said yo how can a man respect that knowin if he paid  
then he correct that  
Ice is the price for an overnight wife  
A true shark caller dont want that in his life  
So all you ladies that are selling youre souls  
You need to put you hooker vibes on hold  
Ask for Keisha she working on the stroll  
Dead ass broke but her pimp the man grow
