When I was younger  
I thought the world circled around me  
But in time I realized I was wrong  
My immortal thoughts turned into just dreams of a dead future  
It was a tragic case of my reality  
  
Do you think youre indestructible  
And no one can touch you  
Well I think youre disposable  
And its time you knew the truth  
Cause its just one of my lies  
  
Why does my life have to be so small  
Yet death is forever  
And does forever have a life to call its own  
  
Dont give me an answer cause you  
Only know as much as I know  
Unless youve been there once  
well I hardly think so  
  
I used to pray all night  
Before I lay myself down  
My mother said it was right  
Her mother said it too  
Why
