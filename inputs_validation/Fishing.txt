Inspirtation  
Oh she barely waits a moment  
Elevator doors open  
Hear her footsteps touch the stairs  
  
Words walk by  
Describing definition  
Stop and talk about it  
  
Narcissus  
Is just too easy to see  
Were always looking  
When we see fishes  
When we go fishin  
  
Thoughts meander  
Risin all around us  
Rise and fall and rise again  
Oh we stop and talk about it  
  
Strong beliefs  
Like ideas come to life  
Turn atoms into rain and stone  
Sands and tall trees  
  
Worlds passed by  
Defyin description  
Stop and talk about it  
Talk about it  
  
And Maia she dances  
She dissolves into the light  
Illusions of light  
Oh Maia she dances  
  
Deep romance and poetry  
Songs and movies  
Virtue for la de da  
She dances in the light  
Dance in the light  
  
Maia she dances  
Oh Maia she dances
