Ohhh Yeah  
I should have stopped looked and listened before I proceeded  
But caution I threw to the wind  
Manyve been placed in my life to help lead me and guide me  
But I didnt want to talk to them  
So I ignored their advice and I tried to disguise pain from you and all the
things you did  
The wrong road was chosen my heart has been broken  
Cause I didnt want to hear them  
Shoulda said what I didnt say  
Shoulda went right but I went left that day  
Shoulda prayed but instead I strayed  
Shoulda gone a different way  
Shoulda listened to my mother  
When she said that you were no good for me  
Shoulda listened to my pastors  
When they told me turn around and leave you be  
Shoulda listened to my sisters  
When they said that I was too blind to see  
But I see the light somehow  
And I vow to listen now  
I had the chance to advance and it seemed like the best  
Opportunity that I could get  
I didnt bother to see if my people agreed  
Maybe I knew what they would say and yet  
I didnt control it I kept going for it  
When I shoulda known it wasnt in Gods plan  
Had to let go had I listened before  
I wouldve said no from the door  
Shoulda said what I didnt say  
Shoulda went right but I went left that day  
Shoulda stayed but instead I strayed  
Shoulda gone a different way  
Shoulda listened to my mother  
When she said that you were no good for me  
Shoulda listened to my pastors  
When they told me turn around and leave you be  
Shoulda listened to my sisters  
When they said that I was too blind to see  
But I see the light somehow  
And I vow to listen now  
Shoulda listened to my mother  
When she said that you were no good for me  
Shoulda listened to my pastors  
When they told me turn around and leave you be  
Shoulda listened to my sisters  
When they said that I was too blind to see  
But I see the light somehow  
And I vow to listen now  
Shoulda listened I know I shoulda listened  
But I know that I vow to listen now  
Shoulda listened I know I shoulda listened  
But you dont have to tell me twice Im going to listen now  
Shoulda listened if only I had listened  
But Ive learned my lesson now  
Im gonna listen now  
Shoulda listened cause I just cant be missing  
All the things God has for me  
Repeat till end
