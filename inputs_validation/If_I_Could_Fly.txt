No fear no pain  
Nobody left to blame  
Ill try alone  
Make destiny my own  
I learn to free my mind  
Myself I now must find  
Once more  
Once more  
  
If I could fly  
Like the king of the sky  
Could not tumble nor fall  
I would picture it all  
If I could fly  
See the world through my eyes  
Would not stumble nor fail  
To the heavens I sail  
If I could fly  
  
So here I am  
In solitude I stand  
Ive got dreams inside  
I need to realize  
My faith has grown  
No fear of the unknown  
No more  
No more  
  
If I could fly  
Like the king of the sky  
Could not tumble nor fall  
I would picture it all  
If I could fly  
See the world through my eyes  
Would not stumble nor fail  
I could ravage my jail  
If I could fly
