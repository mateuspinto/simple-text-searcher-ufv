As I walk down this busy street  
I think about your leaving  
How my life may never be the same  
I know I should be planning ways  
To enjoy this endless freedom  
Losing you has put my heart in chains  
  
Darling some prisons dont have walls  
Your memory wont let me go at all  
I found no way out since youve been gone  
Some prisons dont have walls  
  
Every night I turn the TV on  
To break the sound of silence  
For a while it takes you off my mind  
Just when I feel over you reality surrounds me  
  
There I am right back doing time  
Darling some prisons
