Hes brought me here where things are clear  
And trials turn to gold  
He shared with me His victory  
He won in days of old  
  
Oh Lord I dont deserve  
The riches of your word  
But Youve changed my filthy rags  
To linen white as snow  
  
The view from here is nothing near  
To what it is for You  
I tried to see Your plan for me  
But I only acted like I knew  
  
Oh Lord forgive the times  
I tried to read your mind  
Cause you said if Id be still  
Then I would hear your voice  
  
My Lord my King my urge to sing  
And praise the things above  
No words can say the glorious way  
You changed me with your love  
  
Hes brought me low so I could know  
The way to reach the heights  
To forsake my dreams my self esteem  
And give up all my rights  
  
With each one that I lay down  
A jewels placed in my crown  
Cause His love the things above  
Is all well ever need  
  
Hes brought me here where things are clear  
And trials turn to gold
