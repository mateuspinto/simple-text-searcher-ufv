Tell you man Im stuck on this lovely girl  
Of course to me you know she mean all the world  
But then she like another guy  
I fall down dead she never see the tears I cry  
Please please please do not go  
How long can the days go on  
When my love is so strong  
And I know I cannot tell a lie  
I want to see him go bye  
Bye bye bye bye bye bye bye  
  
Now I wonder what she would say  
If I told her that I felt this way  
Why know it might make her turn either way  
So all I can do is patiently pray  
Pray pray pray pray  
Tell you man Im stuck on this lovely girl  
And why know I could travel all over the whole world  
Please please please do not go  
You hurt me so  
I got something to show you
