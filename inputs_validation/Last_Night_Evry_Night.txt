I watch you as you wake and rub your eyes and try to hide them from the  
  
Morning sun  
I whisper how ya doing and you smile and say so tenderly good morning  
Hun  
  
Chorus  
Last night you made his memory fade a little  
You helped me see how love can still be right  
I wish you didnt have to leave  
If you just knew how much I need  
Last night evry night  
  
I know you have to catch a plane to Memphis  
And you mentioned its an early flight  
You start to pack  
And while I comb my hair  
I stare at you and think about last night  
  
Cause Chorus  
  
I slip into my robe to go make coffee  
You come in and pull me close to you  
And as I feel your tender kiss  
I whisper cant Memphis wait a day or two  
Cause Chorus  
  
Cause Chorus
