In ecstasy they cry to know  
If their parents love will let them grow  
Their mothers pride their fathers joy  
We thank the stars that theyre not boys  
The native daughters of the golden west  
Their beauty is priceless  
  
As children do they stayed at home  
Waiting for the day that they were grown  
The future seemed so far away  
But every night theyd kneel and pray  
  
But all in all they did their best  
And one by one they left the nest  
Across the globe they searched for love  
And put their faith in God above  
  
The native daughters of the golden west  
Theyre made out of light  
We never would have guessed  
  
So by and by their dreams came true they fell in love with boys they knew  
Their children grew fed from the breast  
Of the native daughters of the golden west  
The native daughters of the golden west  
They talk all day  
But we were not impressed  
  
The native daughters of the golden west  
Theyre sisters of mercy  
Theyll grant your last request
