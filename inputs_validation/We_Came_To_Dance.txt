We came to dance  
Making moves from a passion play  
  
The ties that bind us just slip away  
We came to dance  
The piper calls out a different rhyme  
  
He cracks the whip and we step in time  
Standing as the parade goes passing by  
I hear a voice around my cry  
Like the sound of a distant drums  
Rejected and alone  
  
A heart without a home  
Then someone said  
We came to dance  
Making moves from a passion play  
  
We came to dance  
Waiting as the panic grips my hand  
Hearing prose from high command  
  
Like a million times before  
No dignity or grace  
  
Its the price and not the race  
And someone said  
We came to dance  
Making moves from a passion play  
  
We came to dance  
We came to dance  
Making moves from a passion play  
  
The ties that bind us just slip away  
  
Take what you can  
They said take it while you may  
But keep in mind penalty fits the crime  
  
And it deals no softened blow  
We came to dance  
Making moves from a passion play  
  
We came to dance  
Making moves from a passion play  
  
We came to dance  
Making moves from a passion play
