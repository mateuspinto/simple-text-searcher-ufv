I went to the waters edge forgot I couldnt swim  
I went to the waters edge all ready to jump in  
I saw the water shimmer  
I heard the wind howl  
I saw my own reflection  
I just cant see it now  
  
You say its the way of the world  
To somehow coexists  
That eventually life unfurls  
A path to happiness  
  
So I whisper your little secret  
And repeat it under my breath  
Ill save it for you in my heart  
In case we both forget  
  
Oh I wish you could wrap yourself around me  
I am gripped by a loneliness  
Oh I wish you could wrap yourself around me  
Id be released in your tenderness  
Id be released in your tenderness  
  
I went to the waters edge and saw my life eclipse  
I went to the waters edge and then felt myself slip  
I dreamed that I was floating just coast until I grew fins  
I want to catch this tide back home and feel you again  
  
Oh I wish you could wrap yourself around me  
I am gripped by a loneliness  
Oh I wish you could wrap yourself around me  
Id be released in your tenderness  
Oh I wish you could wrap yourself around me  
I am gripped by a loneliness  
Oh I wish you could wrap yourself around me  
Id be released in your tenderness  
Id be released in your tenderness  
Id be released in your tenderness
