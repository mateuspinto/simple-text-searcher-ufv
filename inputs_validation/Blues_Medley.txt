I got a sweet little angel mama  
Lord and I love the way she spreads her wings  
Spreads her wings Lord  
All around my everything

Lord ya know she gave me a 20 dollar bill  
I asked my ol lady for a nickel people  
Lord ya know she give me a 20 dollar bill  
And I asked her for a little shot of liquor  
No she bought me a whiskey still  
And I bought you a new Ford  
Say you want a Cadillac  
Bought ya a ten dollar dinner  
You said thanks for the snack  
I let you live in my penthouse  
And you called it a shack  
Gave you seven younguns  
Now you wanna give em all back
