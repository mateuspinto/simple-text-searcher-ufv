How I love the kisses of Dolores  
Ayeayeaye Dolores  
Not Marie or Emily or Doris  
Only my Dolores  
  
From a balcony above me  
She whispers Love me and throws a rose  
Ah but she is twice as lovely  
As the rose she throws  
  
I would die to be with my Dolores  
Ayeayeaye Dolores  
I was made to serenade Dolores  
Chorus after chorus  
  
Just imagine eyes like moon rise  
A voice like music lips like wine  
What a break if I could make Dolores  
Mine all mine  
  
I would die to be with my Dolores  
Ayeayeaye Dolores  
I was made to serenade Dolores  
Chorus after chorus  
  
Just imagine eyes like moon rise  
A voice like music lips like wine  
What a break if I could make Dolores  
Mine all mine
