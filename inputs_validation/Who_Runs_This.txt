Its Pitbull Lil Jon  
Its my way of paying you back dog  
For all the love that you gave me  
  
Pitbull  
Ill be more than happy  
To show you how I rap  
Who I am where Im from  
And whats coming up next  
Fuck the glitter and gold  
And all the glamour and glits  
Im here for 1 reason  
And survey says To get rich  
So give me the loot loot  
Show me the cash  
Open the safe  
Show me the stash  
I suggest that you show  Operation  
Or end up in the hospital  
Getting emergency operations  
Family asking doctor doctor  
Will he make it through  
But theres nothing that doctor doctor can do  
When the chichichichoppers  
Are chichichichopping at you  
Thats it your done  
Your finished your through  
Theres no coming back  
What you think were cooking crack  
Just one question dog  
What the fuck are you looking at  
I know its hard  
Its hard to understand  
But Pitbull will serve you anyway  
Even underhand  
Dont fuck around  
Because you just might end up  
Under land  
Im not the coward motherfucka  
Im the man  
Im the killer on tracks  
Call me the son of sam  
I dont know if yall ready  
But bet ya ass I am  
  
Lil Jon  
Who run this shit
