Start off with a hug lead into embrace  
Oh girl Im glad to see you oh facetoface  
Not a day of age oh and by the way  
I forgot to say how much I missed you baby  
And just like deja vu I say  
Running into you this way  
I wanna keep you here  
I gotta have you near  
Can I have a kiss from you  
Can I have a kiss from you  
For old times sake oh baby

Sure would love to see us back together like we used to be  
So let me take you out so much to talk about  
Like things we used to share and how to get it back my dear  
Just like deja vu I say  
Running into you this way  
I wanna keep you here  
I gotta have you near  
Can I have a kiss from
