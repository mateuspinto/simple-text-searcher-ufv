There is darkness and death in your eyes  
What have you got buried inside  
The shallow grave in your soul  
The ghosts that have taken control  
  
You really should have dug a little deeper there  
Body parts are starting to appear and scare  
The child inside away  
  
Each tear that flows down your face  
Trickles then picks up the pace  
And turns to a river inside  
A river that will not subside  
  
I can hear that dreadful overflowing sound  
And watching from afar I see a child is drowned  
The child inside your heart  
  
I can see you drifting away  
Heading for the light  
I can see you drifting away  
Every night  
  
Why were you always inside  
On days when the weather was fine  
And while we were running around  
You were nowhere to be found  
  
You know you should have taken all your dolls to bed  
Well you were made to play games with your soul instead  
The child inside you died
