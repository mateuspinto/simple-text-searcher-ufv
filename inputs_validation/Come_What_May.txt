I am yours and you are mine come what may  
Love like ours remains divine come what may  
Even though were miles apart  
Youre living in my lonely heart  
At night the teardrops start and pour the long long day  
  
I keep your picture near me since you went away  
I plant a kiss upon your lips each night and day  
Bear in mind and you will find a heart that is true  
And Ill be here with you come what may  
  
All right  
I keep your picture near me since you went away  
I plant a kiss upon your lips each night and day  
Bear in mind and you will find a heart that is true  
  
And Ill be here with you come what may  
And Ill be here with you come what may  
And Ill be here with you come what may  
Ah um bop a bop a um bop a bop a come what may
