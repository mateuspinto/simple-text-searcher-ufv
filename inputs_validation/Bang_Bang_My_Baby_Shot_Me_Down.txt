I was five and she was six  
We rode on horses made of sticks  
I wore black and she wore white  
She would always win the fight  
  
Bang bang she shot me down  
Bang bang I hit the ground  
Bang bang that awful sound  
Bang bang my baby shot me down  
  
Seasons came and changed the time  
And we grew up I called her mine  
She would always laugh and say  
Remember when we used to play  
  
Bang bang I shot you down  
Bang bang you hit the ground  
Bang bang that awful sound  
Bang bang I used to shoot you down  
  
Music played and people sang  
Just for me the church bells rang  
  
Now shes gone I dont know why  
And till this day sometimes I cry  
She didnt even say goodbye  
She didnt take the time to lie  
  
Bang bang she shot me down  
Bang bang I hit the ground  
Bang bang that awful sound  
Bang bang my baby shot me down
