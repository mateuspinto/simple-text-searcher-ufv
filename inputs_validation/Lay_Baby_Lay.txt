Lay baby lay  
Lay across my big brass bed  
Lay baby lay  
Lay across my big brass bed  
  
Whatever colors you have in your mind  
I gonna show them to you  
And Ill make them shine  
Lay baby lay  
Lay across my big brass bed  
  
Stay baby stay  
Stay with your woman awhile  
Till the break of day  
Let me see you make me smile  
  
Your clothes are dirty  
But your hands are clean  
And youre the best thing  
That I ever seen  
Stay baby stay  
Stay with your woman awhile  
  
Why wait any longer  
For the world to begin  
You can have your cake  
And eat it too  
Why wait any longer  
For the one you love  
When she standing in front of you  
So stay baby stay  
Stay across my big brass bed  
Lay baby lay  
Lay while the night is still ahead  
  
I long to see you in the morning light  
I want to reach for you in the night  
So stay baby stay  
Stay across my big brass bed  
Lay baby lay  
Lay while the night is still ahead  
Ah lay baby lay  
Lay across my big brass bed
