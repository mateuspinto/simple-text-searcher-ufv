Outside the leaves are slowly falling from the trees  
Black clouds are moving in a storm is coming on  
Inside the confessional Angel and I are playing games  
Im acting the priest and she is the sinner of all my dreams  
Dreams dreams turn into a nightmare  
A sudden change on her face her smile is gone without a trace  
Nothing nothing is forever she said  
So many things are wrong in here so many times Ive lived in fear  
A year ago I signed a sacred pact and if you love me so will you  
Then she told me of the Pact her tears were not an act  
And they were not alone all my dreams shattered to the bone  
I fell to my knees in prayer but ohhh this is Hell  
The Pact is so powerful it leaves you no way out  
Unless within a year someone else will sign it in blood  
Someone to take your place to guard this evil church  
Another wolf to roam the hills another wolf in for the kill  
Nothing nothing is forever she said  
So many things are wrong in here so many times Ive lived in fear  
A year ago I signed a sacred Pact  
If i sign it now Angel will be free to go  
She must leave without her memory no more a wolf but as a lady  
And if I dont then in seven days she will die before my very eyes  
Either way Ill never see her again  
If i sign then I must stay and only leave as a wolf for prey  
Nothing nothing is forever she said  
So many things are wrong in here so many times Ive lived in fear  
A year ago I signed a sacred Pact  
And now Im signing it for you
