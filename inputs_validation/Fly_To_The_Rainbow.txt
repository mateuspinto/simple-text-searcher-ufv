Life is empty cant remember anytime before  
On a plain lit cold December see it evermore  
Gliding through this life and another is a child  
And were doing games and losing things  
Always playing gigs  
  
Somewhere in the sky where the moon the stars shine bright  
Where the sun is shining in the night  
I am in disgrace yet I see a smiling face  
And I hope you let me share your place  
I dont live today  
  
Rain in the sky  make the world fly  
Into time beg me your time  
Sun in the sky make the world fly  
Into time beg me your time  
  
Rain in the sky  make the world fly  
Into time beg me your time  
Sun in the sky make the world fly  
Into time beg me your time  
  
Rain in the sky  make the world fly  
Into time beg me your time  
Sun in the sky make the world fly  
Into time beg me your time  
  
Well I lived in magic solitude  
Of cloudylooking mountains  
And a lake made out of crystal raindrops  
Roaming through Space ten thousand years ago  
Ive seen the giant city of Atlantis  
Sinking to eternal waves of darkness  
  
Somewhere in the blue distance  
Are those longforgotten trees of yore  
A broken violin floating alone in December  
Darkness everywhere and nothing more  
  
Symbol strange Symbol Melancholy  
Painting torrid colors to a sky of green  
Candle breathing one night only  
Far away in chillness bleak unseen  
  
Drifting galley ghostlike shadow  
Sails rigged to catch and kill the Time  
Echoes wandering down an endless meadow  
To call the Thing  
Sublime
