They line the wailing wall  
The masses fill up Saint Peters square  
Confessions emotions spill out of desperate prayer  
I know theyre not alone  
Theyve come to face the penitence stone  
I hear the voices of souls in need of you cause  
  
Chorus  
You are the answer  
and the meaning of life  
To hearts in darkness  
youre the source of the light  
As we walk this human road  
every question will find  
you are the answer  
  
Across the playground yard  
another future society  
Living and learning the way its supposed to be  
The days of truth grow dim  
Your hand must reach down and write in them  
The message of hope that can only be found in you cause  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
You shined your light in me  
when I had no way  
Rescued my dying heart  
that I could not save  
And not just for me but for the world today  
  
Repeat Chorus
