I embrace the darkness within  
Forever serve beneath its hand  
Horrid thoughts that surface to me  
Ceremony bloods command  
I will live through this forever  
I have done the things you grieve  
As you kneel before its evil  
Death is here deep inside your  
  
Skinned alive now naked  
Terrorized no humanity  
Seek salvation from an mia god  
Empty vessels chanting for your death  
  
Walk the streets beneath the shadows  
Searching for a cryptic bride  
Eat alive the conscience I hate  
Without pain I watch you die  
I will live through this forever  
I have done the things you grieve  
As you kneel before its evil  
My face is the last youll see  
  
Soaked in blood the mask you wear  
Haunting cries the dead scream for me  
Staring eyes invoke no guilt  
I can taste your mind your lifeless  
  
Face the dead and dying  
Feel your life drain  
Through your soul  
Seek salvation from an MIA god  
Empty vessels chanting for the dead  
  
Death is yours  
Your veins have dried  
Staring eyes of glass now empty  
Still you speak with lips so cold  
In my head I hear you cry  
  
God is dead cant save me  
Taking lives with impunity  
Resurrection of a deviant Christ  
Feeding hate to capacity  deviance
