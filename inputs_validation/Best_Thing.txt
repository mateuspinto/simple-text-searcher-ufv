JayZ Talking  
I mean usher is this what it come to man  
This is how we gon do it  
I mean I making grass grow baby ya know  
Seeds become plants  
Boys become men  
Want we gon do  
  
Verse 1 JayZ  
Wrapped around our girls like pashminas  
Whats my demeanor  
The grass is always greener on the other side  
To think of I cant give her a ring up  
I couldnt give a fuck  
I could I give a finger  
Let alone half baths and closets  
So claustrophobic if there were close objects  
Now its sort of like two door garages  
Its like two broads minagin  
Your the best mama  
  
Verse 2 Usher  
Is there any chance  
That you remember me being any more than just a horrible man  
And would you consider  
Pullin this trigger  
And taking a second shot at romance  
Oh Babe  
I want the days when you were my girl  
And I was your man  
Know I took you for granted  
But it wasnt until now I see how much I miss you  
Girl Im sorry that I ran the streets acting like a damn fool yeah  
But for once here goes the truth  
  
Chorus  
I cant be fake I cant be phonie  
Acting all hard thats the niggers thats lonely  
I tried to flex but I confess that when you left you took the very best thing  
The best things that ever happened to me  
You took my best thing  
The best thing that I ever seen  
You took the best thing that I ever seen  
You took the the best thing that I ever had  
And now all I feel is stress cause when you left you took the very best  
  
Verse 3 Usher  
Remember Mimi or Vita remember Isha or Eva  
I aint got em no more hey yes  
Niomi or Jenny the same outcome is chillin  
Girl I let em all go  
No more trickin and kissin miscellaneous chicks  
Acting like a jerk woman I been to church  
And I talked to the bishop and he wanted me to share this with ya  
How much I miss you  
  
Im so sorry that I ran the streets acting like a damn fool  
But for once here goes the truth  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 4 JayZ  
Mama tried t o told me  
Hovie Hov better slow it down  
You gon lose your best thing  
If you keep gettin round  
Like PAC needed pot  
When you old to hold you down  
Ma forever young was forever numb  
Sorry states are sorry done  
Your million and all of them  
All of em was funny time  
It wasnt you it was him  
School me once school me twice  
Three times and I was dumb  
Now its so plant the seed in me  
I got the one  
Your the best mama  
  
Chorus
