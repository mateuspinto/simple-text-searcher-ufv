Nah you dont know me  
Lightning above and a fire below me  
You cannot catch me cannot hold me  
You cannot stop much less control me  
When it rains it pours when the floodgates open brace your shores  
That pressure dont care when it breaks your doors  
Say its all you can take better take some more  
  
Oh  
Cause I know what its like to test fate  
Had my shoulders pressed with that weight  
Stood up strong in spite of that hate  
  
Oh  
Night gets darkest right before dawn  
What dont kill you makes you more strong  
And I been waiting for it so long  
  
The nights go on  
Waiting for a light that never comes  
I chase the sun  
Waiting for a light that never comes  
  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
Waiting for a light that never comes  
  
When I was young they told me they said  
Make your bed you lie in that bed  
A king can only reign til instead  
There comes that day its off with his head  
  
Oh  
The night gets darkest right before dawn  
What dont kill you makes you more strong  
Youll have my mercy then when youre gone  
  
The nights go on  
Waiting for a light that never comes  
I chase the sun  
Waiting for a light that never comes  
  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
Waiting for a light that never comes  
  
And I told them nah you dont know me  
Lightning above and a fire below me  
You cannot catch me cannot hold me  
You cannot stop much less control me  
When it rains it pours  
When the floodgates open brace your shores  
That pressure dont care it breaks your doors  
Say its all you can take better take some more  
  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
Waiting for a light that never comes  
  
The nights go on  
Waiting for a light that never comes  
I chase the sun  
Waiting for a light that never comes  
  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
Waiting for a light that never comes
