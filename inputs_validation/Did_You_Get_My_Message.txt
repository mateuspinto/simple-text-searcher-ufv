Did you get my message the one I left  
While I was trying to convince everything  
That I meant in a minute or less when I called to confess  
And make all of my stresses go byebye  
  
Did you get my message you did not guess  
Cause if you did you would have called me with your sweet intent  
And we could give it a rest  
stead of beating my breast  
Making all of the pressure go skyhigh  
  
Do you ever wonder what happens to the words that we send  
Do they bend do they break from the flight that they take  
And come back together again with a whole new meaning  
In a brand new sense completely unrelated to the one I sent  
  
Did you get my message oooh oooh ooooh  
Did you get my message oooh oooh ooooh  
Did you get my message yeah oooh oooh ooooh hooo  
  
Uh oh where did it go must have bopped past your phone  
And fallen right outta the window  
  
Ooh well how can I tell  
Shoulda called the operator maybe she know the info  
But whether or not my message you got was too much or a lot to reply  
  
Why not try this for a fact  
Should you ever come back Id relax and feel relieved  
Before my panic attack  
  
Ahh hooo oooh  
Did you get my message oooh oooh ooooh  
Did you get my message oooh oooh ooooh  
Did you get my message yeah oooh oooh ooooh hooo  
  
Did you get my message the one that I left  
While I was trying to convince everything that I meant  
  
Now the moment is passed  
Not much sand in the glass and Im standing to lose my mind  
Do you ever wonder what happens to the words that we send  
So they bend do they break from the flight that they take  
And come back together again with a whole new meaning  
to the matter of our love defense and please be sympathetice to the time I
spent  
  
Did you get my message oooh oooh ooooh  
Did you get my message oooh oooh ooooh  
Did you get my message yeah oooh oooh ooooh hooo  
Did you get my message  
  
No I didnt hear a word you said  
Did you get my message  
  
No Im not gonna believe your lies anymore  
Did you get my message that I want to reconnect with you  
Did you get my message

Why did you get the message love   
That I want to get back with you  
Did you get my message love  
  
That I want to reconnect with you  
Why did you get the message love   
Did you get my message  
  
That I want to reconnect with you
