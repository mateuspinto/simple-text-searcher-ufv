Put his coat on his shoulders and slowly he walked away  
Behind him he could hear  
Those innocent voices  
Crying out so bitterly saying  
We did not start the war But we fighting now  
We did not start the fire  
But we burning now  
They were told many years ago that their country is free  
But they didnt understand  
That its not real  
They never knew it was a  
Chorus  
Mickey Mouse freedom independence  
Me come ina you country  
That is said to be free x2  
Me sight corruption  
Me sight starvation  
Walking like a millionaire cause you think you country is free  
One thing you dont know is that your country is being remote controlled  
Chorus  
Mickey Mouse freedom independence till fade
