They married back in 32  
They were young and love was new  
And every day the feeling grew  
Between the two of them  
When work grew scarce and times got bad  
The hope would chase away the sad  
And hope was sometimes all they had  
Between the two of them  
The 40s came and the 50s went  
And the mortgage replaced the rent  
They made the most of each day spent  
Between the two of them  
Their children all turned out just fine  
So he retired in 69  
And left with oh so little time  
Between the two of them  
Today I brave the graveyard rain  
And placed a rose between their names  
Now thats the most that ever came  
Between the two of them  
And though I miss them oh so much  
His crooked smile her gentle touch  
And the pleasure of just growing up  
Between the two of them
