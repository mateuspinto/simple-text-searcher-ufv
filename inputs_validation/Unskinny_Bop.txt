Whats got you so jumpy  
Why cant you sit still yeah  
Like gasoline you want to pump me  
And leave me when you get your fill yeah  
Every time I touch you honey you get hot  
I want to make love you never stop  
Come up for air you push me to the floor  
Whats been going on in that head of yours  
  
Chorus  
Unskinny bop  
Just blows me away  
Unskinny bop bop  
All night and day  
Unskinny bop bop bop bop  
She just loves to play  
Unskinny bop nothin more to say  
  
You look at me so funny  
Love bite got you acting oh so strange  
You got too many bees in your honey  
Am I just another word in your page yeah yeah  
Every time I touch you honey you get hot  
I want to make love you never stop  
Come up for air you push me to the floor  
Whats been going on in that head of yours  
  
Chorus  
  
Youre sayin my love wont do ya  
But that aint love written on your face  
Well honey I can see right through ya  
Well see whose ridin who at the end of the race

What the hell is going on  
  
Chorus
