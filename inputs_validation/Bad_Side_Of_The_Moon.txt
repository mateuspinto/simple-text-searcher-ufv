T seems as though Ive lived my life  
On the bad side of the moon  
To stir your dregs in sickness still  
Without the rustic spoon  
  
Common people live with me  
Where the light has never shone  
And the hermits flock like hummingbirds  
To speak in a foreign tongue  
  
Im a light world away  
From the people who make me stay  
Sitting on the bad side of the moon  
  
There aint no need for watchdogs here  
To justify our ways  
We live our life in manacles  
The main cause of our stay  
  
Exiled here from other worlds  
My sentence comes too soon  
Why should I be made to pay  
On the bad side of the moon
