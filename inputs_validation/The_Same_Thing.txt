Make a man go crazy a woman wear her dress so tight  
Make a man go crazy a woman wear her dress so tight  
Must be the same thing make a tom cat fight all night  
Make you feel so good when your baby get her evening gown  
Make you feel so good when your baby get her evening gown  
Must be the same thing make a preacher lay his bible down  
Woah that same thing  
Woah that same thing  
Tell me who is to blame  
Whole world fighting about that same thing  
What makes all these men chase a big leg woman down  
What makes all these men chase a big leg woman down  
Must be the same thing make a poor dog a hurtin hound  
Woah that same thing  
Woah that same thing  
Tell me who is to blame  
Whole world fighting about that same thing  
Oh that same thing  
Woah that same thing  
Tell me who is to blame  
Whole world fighting about that same thing
