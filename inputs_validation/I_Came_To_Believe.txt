I couldnt manage the problem I laid on myself  
And it just made it worse when I laid them on somebody else  
So I finally surrendered it all brought down in despair  
I cried out for help and I felt a warm comforter there  
  
And I came to believe in a power much higher than I  
I came to believe that I needed help to get by  
In childlike faith I gave in and gave him a try  
And I came to believe in a power much higher than I  
  
Nothing worked out when I handled it all on my own  
And each time I failed it made me feel twice as alone  
Then I cried Lord there must be a surer and easier way  
For it just cannot be that a man should lose hope everyday  
  
And I came to believe in a power much higher than I  
I came to believe that I needed help to get by  
In childlike faith I gave in and gave him a try  
Then I came to believe in a power much higher than I
