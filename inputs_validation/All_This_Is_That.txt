I am that thou art that and all this is that  
I am that thou art that all this is that  
I am that thou art that all this is that  
This is that  
  
Oooo  
Daybreak and I take a glide  
Into the pool of peace inside  
Two waves travel by  
To waves and I both travel by  
And that makes all the difference to me  
  
Life supporting waves of bliss  
Mother Divines precious kiss  
Brings with love the light of wisdom  
And the gift of eternal freedom  
  
To waves and I both travel by  
 and the nature of man  
And that makes all the difference to me  
Krishna  
  
All this is that  
I am that thou art that all this is that  
I am that thou art that all this is that  
This is that  
This is that  
  
Dusk time the shadows fall  
Into the timeless time of all  
  
To waves and I both travel by  
Golden auras glow around you  
Omnipresent love surrounds you  
Wisdom warming as the sun  
You and I are truly one  
  
To waves and I both travel by  
And that makes all the difference to me  
  
I am that thou art that all this is that  
I am that thou art that all this is that  
I am that thou art that all this is that  
I am that thou art that all this is that  
I am that thou art that all this is that  
I am that thou art that all this is that  
I am that thou art that all this is that  
  
Jai guru dev  
I am that thou art that all this is that  
Jai  
I am that thou art that all this is that  
Jai guru dev  
I am that thou art that all this is that  
Jai  
I am that thou art that all this is that  
Jai guru dev  
Jai guru dev  
Jai guru dev  
Jai guru dev  
Jai guru dev  
Jai guru dev  
Jai guru dev  
Jai  
I am that thou art that all this is that  
Jai guru dev
