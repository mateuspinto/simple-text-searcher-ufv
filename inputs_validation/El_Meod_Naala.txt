Hebrew lyrics  
  
El meod naala akabel panav  
Beshira utehila avo limonav x2  
  
Kimimoshe veaharon  
Yovileni lemishkenotav x2  
  
Hoshaa mimaal veishma koli  
Veishlach mimaal veyaazor li x2  
  
Kimimoshe veaharon  
Yovileni lemishkenotav x2  
  
A most honorable god i shell great him  
With singing and glory i will great his coming  
And like mozes and Aaron he will lead me  
To his land above  
X2  
He will lend his ear and hear my voice  
And will send from above and help me  
Couse like mozes and Aaron he will lead me  
To his land above X2
