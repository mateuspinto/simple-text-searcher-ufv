To try to do the right thing always the right thing  
  
Ive been doing some thinking here on my own  
Its been on my mind  
This debt I owe to you  
I have to repay in kind  
  
But I cant find my way  
  
Tired and weary I follow the path  
That leads to your door  
But it occurred to me all that I have  
Is already yours  
  
But I cant find my way  
  
Oh just to sit a while  
Oh just to sit and watch you smile  
  
But I cant find my way  
  
Keep the faith you say  
To keep the faith I pray  
Be strong you say  
Just follow the light  
  
Wheels keep turning but the close I get  
The farther I seem  
Peace will only come  
Finding the peace within  
  
But I cant find my way
