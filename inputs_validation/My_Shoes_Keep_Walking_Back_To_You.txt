I may say that I dont care hold up head up in the air  
Even tell my friends Im glad that you dont call  
But when the day is through my heartaches start anew  
And thats when I miss you most of all  
And my arms keep reaching for you my eyes keep searching for you  
My lips keep calling for you and my shoes keep walking back to you  
  
No matter how much I pretend I wish I had you back again  
For nothing else means half as much as you  
My world just seemed to die the day you said goodbye  
And I cant forget no matter how I cry  
And my arms keep reaching
