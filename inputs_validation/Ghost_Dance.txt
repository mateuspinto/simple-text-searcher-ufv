What is it children that falls from the sky  
Tayi taya tayi aye ya  
Mannah from Heaven from most high  
Food from the Father tayi taye ya  
  
We shall live again we shall live again  
We shall live again shake out the grief  
  
Peace to your brother give and take heed  
Tayi taya it left two feet  
One foot extended snake to the ground  
Wave of the Earth one turn around  
  
We shall live again we shall live again  
We shall live againshake out the grief babe  
  
Stretch out your arms now dip and sway  
Fruit of thy bird tayi taya  
Threw off your shoe haul off the sow  
Dust off the words that shape from the tale  
  
We shall live again we shall live again  
We shall live again shake out the ghost dance  
  
Here we are Father here Holy Ghost  
Bread of your bread host of your host  
We are the tears that fall from your eyes  
Word of your word cry of your cry  
  
We shall live again we shall live again  
We shall live again we shall live  
  
What is it Father in your eye  
What is this grave sign eyes to cry  
Blood of my baby well just what I need  
What is it hide me way off to speed  
  
Who is it Father holy that night  
What is it Father that moves to the right  
What is it Father isnt it pain  
What is it Father that shapes from your main  
  
What is it Father supposed to be brave  
A lot of questions the right to live  
What is it baby I cant do  
Your mama loves you Im dying too  
  
I wont forget you never lie  
Ill always love you till I die
