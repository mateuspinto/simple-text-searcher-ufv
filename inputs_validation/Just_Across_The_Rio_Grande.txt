The lights of Laredo dance on the water  
And shine in a young mans eyes  
Who stand on the border and dreams of paradise  
Hes heard crazy stories of how people live over in the promised land  
He heard they eat three meals a day just across the Rio Grande  
Hes got a wife named Maria and a baby  
Named Rose and another one to feed on the way  
Two willing hands that couldnt find work today  
He stares at the river and curses the future  
That he cant understand  
He knows the child would have a chance just  
Across the Rio Grande  
  
Chorus  
Its only a river  
Thats not so deep or wide  
A boy can throw a stone across and  
Reach the other side Its just some  
Muddy water cutting through the land  
But a man can make a dream come true  
Just across the Rio Grande  
  
The lights of Laredo dance on the water and  
Shine in a young mans eyes Who stand on the  
Border and dreams of paradise  
Hes heard crazy stories of how good life is  
Over in the promised land and  
Sometimes it seems like God must live just  
Across the Rio Grande  
  
Chorus
