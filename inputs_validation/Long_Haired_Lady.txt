Well well well well well  
Do you love me like you know you ought to do  
Well well well well well  
Or is this the only thing you want me for  
Well Ive been meaning to talk to you about it for sometime  
Sweet little lass you are my long haired lady  
Whos the lady that makes that brief occasional laughter  
Shes the lady we wears those flashing eyes  
Wholl be taking her home when all the dancing is over

Ah when youre wrong love is long love is long

Or is this the only thing you want me for  
Well Ive been meaning to talk to you about it for sometime  
Sweet little lass you are my long haired lady  
  
Bells are buzzing about my sweet delectable baby  
Birds are humming about their big surprise  
Whos your favorite person dear phenomenal lady
