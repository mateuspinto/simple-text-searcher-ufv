Hero of the night  
Blood and thunder  
Rushing through me  
Till the dawn of light  
The sky is turning red  
  
Like a renegade  
All alone I walk through fire  
Till I crash and blaze  
Im living on the edge  
  
Start a chain reaction  
Sears the neon light  
Stealing all the action  
Always takes the fight  
  
Leather rebel  
Lightning in the dark  
Leather rebel  
With a burning heart  
  
Master of the streets  
Bullet proof and bound for glory  
Cities at my feet  
Im turning on the power  
  
Running wild and free  
Noone dares to stand before me  
Thats my destiny  
To rule the darkest hours  
  
I can see my future  
Writings on the wall  
Legend in my lifetime  
Stories will recall
