You curl around me  
Like a fern in the spring  
Lie down here  
Let me sing the things you bring  
And we can go down easy  
Oh my lover we can go down easy  
Oh my darling we can go down easy  
You come up and see me  
With your big brown eyes  
Come around to my place  
You know Ill sympathize you  
And we can go down easy  
Oh my lover we can go down easy  
Oh my darling we can go down easy  
I wont be fancy  
But I will be free  
You know I love you  
And you can really talk to me  
And we can go down easy  
Oh my darling we can go down easy  
Oh my lover we can go down easy  
You curl around me  
Like a fern in the spring  
Lie down here  
Let me sing the things you bring  
And we can go down easy  
Oh my lover we can go down easy  
Oh my darling we can go down easy
