Whats the matter with the clothes Im wearing  
Cant you tell that your ties too wide  
Maybe I should buy some old tab collars  
Welcome back to the age of jive  
Where have you been hidin out lately honey  
You cant dress trashy till you spend a lot of money  
Everybodys talkin bout the new sound  
Funny but its still rock and roll to me  
  
Whats the matter with the car Im driving  
Cant you tell that its out of style  
Should I get a set of white wall tires  
Are you gonna cruise the miracle mile  
Nowadays you cant be too sentimental  
You best bets a true baby blue Continental  
Hot funk cool punk even if its old junk  
Its still rock and roll to me  
  
Oh it doesnt matter what they say in the papers  
Cause its always been the same old scene  
Theres a new band in town  
But you cant get the sound from a story in a magazine  
Aimed at your average teen  
  
How about a pair of pink sidewinders  
And a bright orange pair of pants  
You could really be a Beau Brummel baby  
If you just give it half a chance  
Dont waste your money on a new set of speakers  
You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers  
Next phase new wave dance craze anyways  
Its still rock and roll to me  
  
Whats the matter with the crowd Im seeing  
Dont you know that theyre out of touch  
Should I try to be a straight A student  
If you are then you think too much  
Dont you know about the new fashion honey  
All you need are looks and a whole lotta money  
Its the next phase new wave dance craze anyways  
Its still rock and roll to me  
  
Everybodys talkin bout the new sound  
Funny but its still rock and roll to me
