Cant get the stink off  
Hes been hanging around for days  
Comes like a comet  
Suckered you but not your friends  
  
One day hell get to you  
Teach you how to be a holy cow  
  
Chorus  
You do it to yourself you do  
And thats what really hurts is  
You do it to yourself just you  
You and noone else  
You do it to yourself  
You do it to yourself  
  
Dont get my sympathy hanging out the 15th floor  
Youve changed the locks 3 times  
He still comes reeling through the door  
One day I will get to you  
And Teach you how to get to purest hell  
  
Chorus
