Already  
Know what Im sayin this Birdman and this how its goin down  
That little youngin Yo Gotti I certified him stamped approval and the jail  
I see like niggas must be they got us fucked up they got us fucked up  
They got us fucked up we been movin birds bitch they got us fucked up  
They got you fucked up then get you fucked we been movin birds bitch  
  
Chorus  
Quarters quarters and halves  
Chickens chickens and bricks bundles  
Bundles of dope and ounces ounces and shit  
Quarters quarters and halves  
Chickens chickens and bricks bundles  
Bundles of dope and ounces ounces and shit  
  
Get what they lookin fo keep what they lookin fo  
All they gotta do is tell me what they lookin fo  
Im da dopeman dopeman  
Im da dopeman dopeman  
  
Money to be made best believe a nigga clockin  
I run it myself like a quarterback option  
I pitch a 10 Gs tell a bitch to go shopping  
She buy herself some clothes  
And she brought me back a chopper  
See niggas tryna kick it  
But no I dont play soccer  
Im all about my cake Im tryna marry Betty Crocker  
A package on the way you know my whip game proper  
And all for one key I see seventy thousand dollas  
Now I was shootin dice smokin on a joint  
I bet wit Yo Gotti  
He hit five straight points  
We ova here hustlin  
We ova here grindin  
You rap about money and nigga might sign ya  
You rap about me and a nigga might find ya  
But  yo ass what you hear right behind you  
Dope game bitch let his mama worry bout him  
You can holla at me for a fee but I  
Got Em  
  
Chorus  
  
Get what they lookin fo keep what they lookin fo  
All they gotta do is tell me what they lookin fo  
Im da dopeman dopeman  
Im da dopeman dopeman  
  
I met the Birdman with the Bird layin  
Got a twenty piece brought it back to north Memphis charged twenty two a
piece  
Now Im in the kitchen with a beacon and a blender  
Low key in a rental with them thangs in the fender  
See I full time grind January to December  
Put that snow in the summer got it lookin like the winter  
Im goin back to Cali I gotta get that light green  
Mexico valley you know they got them pine trees  
18 wheeler now Im on I10 on my way to Memphis  
I gotta get my hands in  
I come from the north where gangstas gon grind  
Bitch niggas gon whine and hustlas gon shine  
Everybody say they trappin but most of these niggas lyin  
I told slim told stunna Im waitin for my time  
Either robbin or poppin click clack I shot em bullets burryin brr I

Chorus  
  
Get what they lookin fo keep what they lookin fo  
All they gotta do is tell me what they lookin fo  
Im da dopeman dopeman  
Im da dopeman dopeman  
  
Back where I started on my set in black  
Hop out the passenger side of my back  
Under my nuts was two ounces of crack  
But in my palm I had that chromed out mac  
Shinin on them bitches cause nigga Im bout that  
Flip a quarter bird to score a whole sack  
Pull up in the club in a old school lac  
With a bitch ridin fly so hide you love that  
Its grind time nigga been about that  
We flippin birds let them hoes go to sacs  
We livin large with the garbage bag flats  
Want the money and the power real niggas gon stack  
And ridin fly 25s on the back  
Plushed out nigga keep a few stacks  
Out the hood bout money thats that  
If you ever cross the line best believe you gettin whacked  
  
Chorus  
  
Get what they lookin fo keep what they lookin fo  
All they gotta do is tell me what they lookin fo  
Im da dopeman dopeman  
Im da dopeman dopeman
