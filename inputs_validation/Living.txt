Here it is a dope hit Iceman comin with a dope hit  
Cause a few suckers need their throats slit  
Jealous cause I went multi platinum  
Now Im gonna blast you in the head  
Till youre dead with my magnum  
Lyrics might be simplistic but Im no simp  
On the strip cause I know how to pimp it  
Now I got grip and suckers keep sinking  
In my quicksand Vanilla Ice vocal hitman  
Got the number three in my crosses sittin on the rooftop  
Bop bop bop  
And you fools drop Was a big flflflop flop  
Brothers didnt like your record cause it wasnt hip hop hop  
But this aint a dis cause you sold gold  
Still I made a killin and it aint even a ten eleven million  
Given my rhyming spice while my DJs on the slice  
Vanilla Ice is back on the map with the wrath of the Ice king  
No one will stop me  
No one will stop me  
No one will stop me  
Why is that I disperse  
Why does God shun  
Why does my man try to run my actions  
Why is that I disperse  
Why does God shun  
Now why does my man try to run my actions  
My living condition  
Incomprehensible my living condition  
My living condition  
Incomprehensible its my living condition  
Etch on a sketch on a rhyme like an architect  
Now watch your back son cause you might lose your neck  
Pound for pound I rock the ground I stand on  
I rock records every record at random  
Flyin heads as the heads get full  
Incomprehensible speakers get ripped and torn  
To my tomb  
Im wicked as a witch on a broom stick  
I smash bricks with one lick  
Why is that I disperse  
Why does God shun  
Why does my man try to run my actions  
Why is that I disperse  
Why does God shun  
Now why does my man try to run my actions  
My living condition  
Incomprehensible my living condition  
My living condition  
Incomprehensible its my living condition  
Incomprehensible  
Incomprehensible  
Incomprehensible  
Incomprehensible  
Incomprehensible  
No one will stop me  
No one will stop me  
No one will stop me  
You dont get a second chance  
No one will stop me  
Cause and tremors bring the scales in hand  
Call the cops the paramedics the mans down  
No one will stop me  
You wanna rock my bell so I broke them down  
My tongue snapped and cracked like a bull whip  
No one will stop me  
And you aint nothing but my itty bitty target  
And as I walk through the valley of sin  
No one will stop me  
I walk with all you my friends
