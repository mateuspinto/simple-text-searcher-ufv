Since Im putting down all of the true things around but I like it  
I handed down the crown given the jewels and the answers of may  
The thought of being ousted comes and goes  
When I think about it the wind blows  
I hate it  
  
Run me out of town somewhere a move might intended a gown at  
Pissed at all the bowels always the blues and a delicate smile  
Missed all of the sideways gull and noun  
Chills and petty bandaids wrapped around  
I hate it  
  
Good grief
