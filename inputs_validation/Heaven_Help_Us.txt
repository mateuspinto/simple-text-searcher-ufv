Heaven help the child who never had a home  
Heaven help the girl who walks the street alone  
Heaven help the roses if the bombs begin to fall  
Heaven help us all  
Heaven help the black man if he struggles one more day  
Heaven help the white man if he turns his back away  
Heaven help the man who kicks the man who has to crawl  
Heaven help us all  
Heaven help us all heaven help us all help us all  
Heaven help us Lord hear our call when we call  
Oh yeah  
Heaven help the boy who wont reach twentyone  
Heaven help the man who gave that boy a gun  
Heaven help the people with their backs against the wall  
Lord Heaven help us all  
Heaven help us all heaven help us all heaven help us all help us all  
Heaven help us Lord hear our call when we call  
Now I lay me down before I go to sleep  
In a troubled world I pray the Lord to keep keep hatred from the mighty  
And the mighty from the small  
Heaven help us all  
Oh oh oh yeah  
Heaven help us all
