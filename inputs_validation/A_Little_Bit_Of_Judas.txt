Well you can wear those pajamas like those tibetan llamas all day  
You can be the ascetic profound and prophetic in most every way  
You can model your life after christ or suffice with simon peter  
You can bathe in holy water bow to gideon or gautama  
Or the pyramids of giza  
You can wear your frock your collar or your shawl  
But theres a little bit of judas in us all  
You can keep your conscience swept clean  
Your front lawn looking green  
Its a keen neighborhood  
You visit your sick mother weekly  
Spring for charity freely like a moral man should  
You brought two children in the world a little boy a little girl  
You dutifully clothe and you feed them  
Ou come straight home to your wife  
You want no trouble in your life  
You swear youll never cheat on them  
Now suddenly youre feeling so small  
cause theres a little bit of judas in us all  
Well excuse my digression  
But I had the distinct impression she loved me so  
So as not to try her conscience  
She handed me a crock of nonsense while she bled me slow  
Now her picture hangs on the wall to remind me  
Theres a little bit of judas in us all  
A little bit of judas a little bit of judas  
In us all
