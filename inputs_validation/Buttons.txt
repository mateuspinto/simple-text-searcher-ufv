You got me pushing imaginary buttons  
Step away from me lover away from me lover  
You got me counting imaginary school children  
Get away from me lover away from me lover  
Yes I can see that your carpet is animated  
Walk away from me lover away from me lover  
Yes I see open wounds in everyone Ive dated  
Away from me lover get away from me lover  
I am no good for you  
Im seeing ghosts in everything I do  
I am no good for you  
Im seeing ghosts in everything I do

Im seeing ghosts in everything I do oh oh oh oh  
I am no good for you  
Im seeing ghosts in everything I do oh oh oh oh  
You got me turning all the lights on and off  
Walk away from me lover away from me lover  
When will you see that I am carrying this stuff  
Walk away from me lover away from me lover  
Cant you see that I am losing my marbles  
Its marvelous losing another losing another  
I am no good for you  
Im seeing ghosts in everything I do
