Because of rain I fell in love with you  
The raindrops seem to want to help me too  
Because of rain we stayed indoors and watched it pour  
Thats how I found the one that I adore  
Because of rain we stole a kiss or two  
The cloudy day gave way to skies of blue  
We must thank the misty moisty windowpane  
We found our love because of rain  
  
Because of rain we stole a kiss or two  
The cloudy day gave way to skies of blue  
We must thank the misty moisty windowpane  
We found our love because of rain
