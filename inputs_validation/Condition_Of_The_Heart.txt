There was a girl in Paris whom he sent a letter 2  
Hoping she would answer back now wasnt that a foolhardy notion  
On the part of a sometimes lonely musician  
Acting out a whim is only good 4 a condition of the heart  
  
There was a dame from London who insisted that he love her  
Then left him 4 a real prince from Arabia  
Now isnt that a shame  
That sometimes money buys you everything and nothing  
Love  it only seems 2 buy a terminal condition of the heart  
  
Oh  thinking about you driving me crazy  
Oh  my friends all say its just a phase but  
Oh  every day is a yellow day  
Im blinded by the daisies in your yard  
  
There was a woman from the ghetto  
Who made funny faces just like Clara Bow  
How was I 2 know that she would wear the same cologne as you  
And giggle the same giggle that you do  
Whenever I would act a fool the fool with a condition of the heart  
  
Oh  thinking about you driving me crazy  
Oh  my friends all say its just a phase but  
Oh  every single day is a yellow day  
Im blinded by the daisies in your yard  
  
There was a girl in Paris whom he sent a letter 2  
There was a girl Whom he sent a letter 2  
Hoping she would answer back  
She never answered back and now  
Wasnt that a foolhardy notion  
Hes got a condition of the heart
