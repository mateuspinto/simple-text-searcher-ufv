And if Im wasting my time  
Then nothing could be better  
Than hangin on the line  
And waiting for a honest word forever  
  
And if youre saying goodbye  
Please dont you think me better  
For recalling every rhyme  
From the book the page  
The line the word the letter  
  
Well the windows turning blue  
And the waters ever flowing  
And I hope Im not a fool  
For laughing at myself  
As you were going
