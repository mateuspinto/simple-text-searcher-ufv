I was alone  
I found love  
Now I got some yeah yeah yeah yeah  
You came along  
Right on time  
With a new song yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Now theres nothing in this life now that could go wrong  
  
Oh no yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Not me yeah you you you  
How could yeah yeah yeah yeah  
You do do do do do  
The more I see  
The more I want of you  
  
I was afraid  
I would be sad and lonely  
I was afraid  
You would not be my one and only  
Well I got so hung  
Now Im gonna stake my pony  
  
Oh no yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Not me yeah you you you  
How do yeah yeah yeah yeah  
You do do do do do  
The more I see  
The more I want of you  
  
Was a world outside my window  
Should I hide from it  
Tired of it  
But I know the sea of shadows running far
