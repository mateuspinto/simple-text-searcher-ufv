sometimes when I lose my head  
I cant make sense of what you said  
but you dont mean it  
or thats what you say  
all the conversation seems to slip away  
  
oh maybe you can say it better you can say it betterbetter  
I can listen  
people do it all the time baby  
we can make it better we can make it better  
cause mincing words mincing words will never rhyme  
they never rhyme  
  
same excuses that go round and round  
push them up just to knock them down  
confuse the issue to shift the blame  
and lose the picture like a puzzle game  
  
you never notice if youre right or wrong right or wrong  
it becomes a contest of the weak and the strong  
weak and the strong baby  
there is no reason for you to pick a fight no no  
when we lose heart its time to shut out the light  
  
mmmm hmmm  
  
oh maybe you can say it better  
you can say it betterbetter  
I can listen  
people do it all the time baby  
we can make it better we can make it better  
cause mincing words cause mincing words  
Will never rhyme  
baby never rhyme  
will never rhyme
