Verse 1  
How can I love someone I never touched  
You lived under the water but I love you so much  
You never been on land and you never seen the sky  
You dont know what a cloud is  
Why does everything I love have to die  
They all wanted to see you be as big as you could be  
But I couldnt let that be  
By keeping you small by keeping you safe  
If I could do it again Id release you to sea  
Cause I cant bear to see  
Something so wild just die in a tank  
  
Chorus 1  
And Pablow the blowfish  
I miss you so much  
And Pablow the blowfish  
I miss you so bad  
  
Verse 2  
On Saturday night we all went out to eat  
But I can never decide so someone chose sushi  
I got soup and I ordered rice  
But watching my friends eat my friends ruined my appetite  
  
Chorus 2  
Oh Pablow the blowfish  
If they only knew you like I do  
Theyd love you too  
And Pablow the blowfish  
I miss you so bad  
  
Verse 3  
I wont forget even one second we had  
Cause you might be gone but you could never be dead  
I heard of a seahorse named Sadie  
I heard she was quite the lady  
Maybe youll find her and you could make babies  
Thatd be kind of crazy  
  
Bridge  
If Pablow the blowfish  
Found love deep in the sea  
Then that would mean  
Pablow the blowfish  
Is better off than here with me  
  
Outro  
But Pablow the blowfish  
I miss you so bad
