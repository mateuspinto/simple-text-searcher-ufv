In my mind in my head this is where we all came from  
The dreams we have the love we share  
This is what were waiting for  
  
And In my mind in my head this is where we all came from  
The dreams we have the love we share  
This is what were waiting for  
  
Im waiting for a smile  
Waiting for this time waiting for this moment  
To step into the light  
Got the street up in my club  
One night to live it up  
You know Im not stopping till we hell no  
  
Perfect brother can I tell you
