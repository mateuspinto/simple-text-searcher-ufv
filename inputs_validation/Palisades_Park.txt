Last night I took a walk in the dark  
To a place called Palisades Park  
To have some fun to see what I could see  
Thats where the girls are  
I took a ride on the shoopty shoop  
The girl I sat with almost almost puked  
  
And when it stopped she was holding hands with me  
My arms were flying up like a rocket ship  
Down like a roller coaster  
Fast like a loopty loop  
Then around like a merrygoround  
We even at a hot dog stand  
Slam danced to a rockin band  
And when she winked I gave that girl a hug  
In the tunnel of love  
Youll never know how good it just can feel  
Til it stops at the top of the Ferris wheel  
  
I fell in love down at Palisades Park
