One two three four five six seven eight nine out  
Everyone is waiting for the light  
Be afraid dont be afraid  
The sun is shining out of my eyes  
It will not set tonight  
And the world counts loudly to ten  
One  
Here comes the sun  
Two  
Here comes the sun  
Three  
It is the brightest star of them all  
Four  
Here comes the sun  
The sun is shining out of my hands  
It can burn it can blind you all  
When it breaks out of the fists  
It lays down hotly on the face  
It will not set tonight  
And the world counts loudly to ten  
One  
Here comes the sun  
Two  
Here comes the sun  
Three  
It is the brightest star of them all  
Four  
Here comes the sun  
Five  
Here comes the sun  
Six  
Here comes the sun  
Seven  
It is the brightest star of them all  
Eight nine  
Here comes the sun  
The sun is shining out of my hands  
It can burn it can blind you  
When it breaks out of the fists  
It lays down hotly on your face  
It lays down painfully on your chest  
Balance is lost  
It lets you go hard to the floor  
And the world counts loudly to ten  
One  
Here comes the sun  
Two  
Here comes the sun  
Three  
It is the brightest star of them all  
Four  
And it will never fall from the sky  
Five  
Here comes the sun  
Six  
Here comes the sun  
Seven  
It is the brightest star of them all  
Eight nine  
Here comes the sun
