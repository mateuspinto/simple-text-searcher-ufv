The trees are spinning oxygen  
Theyre the rockets we should fear  
If we go and let them off then we will disappear  
Then we will disappear surely we will disappear  
  
The road is hot and dusty  
The desert needs a beer  
But if we go and blow it up then we will disappear  
Then we will disappear surely we will disappear  
If we go and blow it up then we will disappear  
We will disappear surely  
We will disappear  
We will disappear  
We will disappear  
We will disappear  
We will disappear  
We will disappear
