The Boatman calls from the lake  
A lone loon dives upon the water  
I put my hand over hers  
Down in the lime tree arbour  
The wind in the trees is whispering  
Whispering low thar I love her  
She puts her hand over mine  
Down in the lime tree arbour  
Through every step that I take  
And every place I go  
There is a hand that protects me  
And I do love her so  
There will always be suffering  
It flows through life like water  
I put my hand over hers  
Down the lime tree arbour  
The Boatman he is gone  
The loons have flown for cover  
She puts her hand over mine  
Down the lime tree arbour  
Through every word that I speak  
And everything I know  
There is a hand that protects me  
And I do love her so
