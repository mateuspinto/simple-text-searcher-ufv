Are you there  
Are you watching me  
As I lie here on this floor  
They say you feel what I do  
They say youre here every moment  
Will you stay  
Stay till the darkness leaves  
Stay here with me  
I know youre busy I know Im just one  
But you might be the only one who sees me  
The only one to save me  
  
Why is it so hard  
Why cant you just take me  
I dont have much to go  
Before I fade completely  
  
Can you feel how cold I am  
Do you cry as I do  
Are you lonely up there all by yourself  
Like I have felt all my life  
The only one to save mine  
  
How are you so strong  
Whats it like to feel so free  
Your heart is really something  
Your love a complete mystery to me  
  
Are you there watching me  
As I lie here on this floor  
Do you cry do you cry with me  
Cry with me tonight  
  
Are you there  
Are you watching me
