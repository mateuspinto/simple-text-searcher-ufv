Twist away the gates of steel  
Unlock the secret voice  
Give in to ancient noise  
Take a chance a brand new dance  
Twist away the gates of steel  
  
Twist away  
Now twist and shout  
The earth it moves too slow  
But the earth is all we know  
We pay to play the human way  
Twist away the gates of steel  
  
A man is real  
Not made of steel  
  
But the earth is all we know  
We pay to play the human way  
Twist away the gates of steel  
  
The beginning was the end  
Of everything now  
The ape regards his tail  
Hes stuck on it  
Repeats until he fails  
Half a goon and half a god  
A mans not made of steel  
  
Twist away  
Now twist and shout  
The earth it moves too slow  
But the earth is all we know  
We pay to play the human way  
Twist away the gates of steel  
  
A man is real thats how he feels
