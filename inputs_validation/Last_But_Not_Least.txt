There aint enough of me to go around  
Got all kinds of reasons  
To be all over town  
Spread thin and broken down  
Everybody wants a piece  
Oh darlin Im afraid  
  
Youve been last but not least  
Everyone I love the most  
Has to take whats left of me  
I put it all together  
But I left out one big piece  
I put you last  
But youre not least  
  
Nothing ever takes the place of you  
Sometimes things that may not matter  
Jump in front of things that do  
And youre fine to stand in line  
While history repeats  
But oh darlin not this time  
  
Last but not least  
Everyone I love the most  
They deserve the best from me  
I put it all together  
When I found that missing piece  
You were the last  
But youre not least  
  
I go left when I should go right  
I chase the dark when I see light  
I trip and fall down every time I try  
To walk that line  
The sun comes out I look for rain  
I search for joy and I find the pain  
I swear I will never get again  
Last but not least  
  
Last but not least  
Everyone I love the most  
Is gonna see the best of me  
I put it all together  
When I found that missing piece  
You were the last  
You were the last  
But youre not least
