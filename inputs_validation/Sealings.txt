Checked my glove for the cash  
It was all for the one for the one  
Slept my baby through it all  
Checked my door for the crash  
Shut like the first you shut the last  
I won I won slept my baby through it all  
I want out I want out  
I want out I want out  
Drop drop down a floor  
Shoot shoot out your mouth  
These days are scraped from ceilings  
Drop drop down a floor  
Shoot shoot out your mouth  
These days are scraped from ceilings  
I want out well I want  
Checked my glove for the cash  
It was all for the one for the one  
Slept my baby through it all  
Checked my door for the crash  
Shut like the first you shut the last  
I won I won slept my baby through it all  
Love is in the metal  
Love is in the metal  
Love is in the metal  
Love is in the ooh  
Who loves who  
Love is in the metal  
Love is in the metal  
Love is in the metal  
Love is in the ooh  
Who loves who  
Drop drop down a floor  
Shoot shoot out your mouth  
These days are scraped from ceilings  
Drop drop down a floor  
Shoot shoot out your mouth  
These days are scraped from ceilings  
I want out well I want I want  
Left my love for the cash  
Left my love for the cash  
Left my love for the cash  
Only one can pass  
Left my love for the cash  
Left my love for the cash  
Only one can pass  
Left my love for the cash
