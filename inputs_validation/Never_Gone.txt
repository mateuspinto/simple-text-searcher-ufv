I really miss you  
Theres something that I gotta say  
  
The things we did  
the things we said  
Keep coming back to me and make me smile again  
You showed me how to face the truth  
Everything thats good in me I owe to you  
  
Though the distance thats between us now may seem to be too far  
It will never separate us deep inside I know you are  
  
Chorus  
Never gone never far in my heart is where you are  
Always close everyday every step along the way  
Even though for now weve got to say goodbye  
I know you will be forever in my life Yeah  
Never Gone  
  
No no no  
  
I walk along these empty streets  
There is not a second youre not here with me  
The love you gave the grace youve shown  
Will always give me strength and be my corner stone  
Some how you found a way to see the best I have in me  
As long as time goes on I swear to you that you will be  
  
Never gone never far in my heart is where you are  
Always close everyday every step along the way  
Even though for now weve got to say goodbye  
I know you will be forever in my life Yeah  
  
Never gone from me  
If theres one thing I believe  
I believe  
I will see you somewhere down the road again  
  
Chorus x2
