Wednesday morning at five oclock  
As the day begins  
Silently closing her bedroom door  
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more  
She goes downstairs to the kitchen  
Clutching her handkerchief  
Quietly turning the back door key  
Stepping outside she is free  
She we gave her most of our lives  
Is leaving sacrificed most of our lives  
Home we gave her everything money could buy  
Shes leaving home after living alone for  
So many years bye bye  
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown  
Picks up the letter thats lying there  
Standing alone at the top of the stairs  
She breaks down and cries to her husband  
Daddy our babys gone  
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly  
How could she do this to me  
She We never thought of ourselves  
Is leaving never a thought for ourselves  
Home we struggled hard all our lives to get by  
Shes leaving home after living alone for  
So many years bye bye  
Friday morning at nine oclock she is far away  
Waiting to keep the appointment she made  
Meeting a man from the motor trade  
She what did we do that was wrong  
Is having we didnt know it was wrong  
Fun fun is the one thing that money cant buy  
Something inside that was always denied for  
So many years bye bye  
Shes leaving home bye bye
