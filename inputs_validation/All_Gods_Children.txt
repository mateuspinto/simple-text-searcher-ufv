Crazy little whirlwind child  
Pretty babies drive ya wild  
Look like one act like another  
Every night a different lover  
Get affection where you can  
Try a boy then try a man  
First time love is in the past  
Make it young and make it fast  
All gods children will have their say  
All gods children  
Must have their way  
Its a game where you can cheat  
Lovers falling at your feet  
High on sensuality  
A photograph for all to see  
First time love is in the past  
Make it young and make it fast  
They can never get enough  
Strong as death and sweet as love  
They walk and talk like angels  
They walk and talk like angels
