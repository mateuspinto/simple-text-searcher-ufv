You tell me that youve never been this way before  
You tell me things I know that Ive heard somewhere  
Youre standing in the places and youre  
Staring down through faces that bring to mind traces  
Of a girl a girl that I knew somewhere  
  
I just cant put my finger on what it is  
That says to me watch out dont believe her  
I cant give any reasons girl  
My thoughts are bound down in a whirl  
I just cant think who in the world was that girl  
I know I met her somewhere  
  
Someway somehow this same thing was done  
Someone somewhere did me this same wrong  
  
Well goodbye dear I just cant take this chance again  
My fingers are still burning from the last time  
And if your love was not a game I only have myself to blame  
Thats as may be I cant explain  
  
Just ask the girl that I knew somewhere
