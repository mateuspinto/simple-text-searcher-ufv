Black phoebe  
Theres a candle in my window  
Black phoebe  
Its all inside of you  
Black phoebe  
Theres a candle in my window  
  
Baby captain  
I hope those teary eyes  
Are only from x  
And I hope they  
Dont dry  
When your biking photos  
Set you free  
And you see  
What a stunner you are  
  
Cappy captain  
I hope that white gold girl  
Forgets about you  
Your crooked blood  
Seeps up from hell  
And you see  
What a stunner you are  
  
Black phoebe  
Theres a candle in my window  
Black phoebe  
Its all inside of you  
Black phoebe  
Theres a candle in my window
