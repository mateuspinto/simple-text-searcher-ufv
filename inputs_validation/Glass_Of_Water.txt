Scared of losing all the time  
He wrote it in a letter  
He was a friend of mine  
He heard you could see your future  
Inside a glass of water  
With ripples and the rhymes  
He asked Will I see heaven in mine  
  
Oh that is just the way it was  
And nothing could be better  
And nothing ever was  
And they say you can see your future  
Inside a glass of water  
With riddles and the rhymes  
But will I see heaven in mine  
Oh oh oh  
  
Son dont ask  
Neither how full nor empty is your glass  
Cling to the mast  
Spend your whole life living in the past  
Going nowhere fast  
  
So he wrote it on a wall  
The hollowest of halos  
Is no halo at all  
And Televisions selling plastic figurines of leaders  
Saying nothing at all  
And you chime  
Stars in heaven align  
Oh  
  
Son dont ask  
Neither how full nor empty is your glass  
Cling to the mast  
Spend your whole life living in the past  
Going nowhere fast  
  
What are we drinking when were done just glasses of water
