Echoing echoing in my mind  
  
Well its about time  
Its beginning to hurt  
Time you made up your mind  
Just what is it all worth  
  
Watch the clock on the wall  
Feel the slowing of time  
Hear a voice in the hall  
Echoing in my mind  
  
Here I stand the accused  
With your fist in my face  
Feeling tired and bruised  
With the bitterest taste  
  
Incomprehensible  
Incomprehensible  
Time  
  
Time time  
Time time  
Time time  
Time
