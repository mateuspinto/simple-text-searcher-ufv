Aint that the way it always starts  
A simple round of conversation  
Became a shameful equation  
I flipped you station to station  
  
Hey dont go and turn the other way  
Dont say theres nothing more to say  
Come on hear me out hush hush settle down  
Button up dont make a sound  
  
Shame shame go away  
Come again some other day  
You used to say I couldnt save you enough  
So Ive been savin it up I started savin it up  
  
And when you said I couldnt give you enough  
I started givin you up I started givin you up  
You are not me Arlandria Arlandria  
You and what army Arlandria Arlandria  
Oh God you gotta make it stop  
  
Chase all of those memories away  
Save them all for another day  
Dont you remember it was rain that drowned you  
  
Wait I wanna see if you can change  
I wanna keep all I can take  
I feel much better now  
Use me up spit me out let me be your handmedown  
Fame fame go away come again some other day  
  
You used to say I couldnt save you enough  
So Ive been savin it up I started savin it up
