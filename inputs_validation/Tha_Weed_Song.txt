Now heres a Zig Zag story while Im writing this song  
Sit back relax Im igniting this bong  
Picture this sandy beaches dimes wearin thongs  
Serving mixed drinks to me all night long  
With me feet back puffin on my weed sack  
Shit you cant believe that people ask me  
Where you buy your trees at  
Got the Bombay Ganje lime green  
Sticky icky Ganja got me needing Visine  
  
Like a magic carpet ride come fly with me  
And this is for my homies that get high with me  
Just crack the Phillie open cause we keep on smoking  
  
Dimes rubbin on lotion  
Feet soaking in the ocean  
On a tropical Island staying sunny  
We outta Phillies take these skins somebody roll a Mummy  
Now people say money makes the world go round  
  
So come escape with me and lets puff on a pound  
  
Chorus  
So high fly through the sky  
And ride my life high  
Fly through the sky  
  
  
No matter what you say  
Feeling so alright so Ire today  
Fire de go blaze  
No responsibility man  
  
No responsible  
Me I go rolling a fat blunt  
Smoking the fat blunt  
This is my goal  
  
Take it easy Rastaman  
  
I will now go blaze  
From Kingston Jamaica  
  
Bombay to India  
Smoking in the air  
What da da da day  
Some of them are smoking  
Weed to take away frustration  
I and I do it for me aggravation  
Dreadlock to Babylon are selling everyday  
Come me say  
Bringing it back on the boat back to the USA  
With the ganja me floating me floating away  
  
Why not come and puff with me and then we go fly away  
  
Chorus repeat  
  
Well its the sticky icky bomb Holmes  
Got the fat sacks puffier than Sean Combs  
Its the Ice man back blowin dookie out the nostrils  
In the studio creating shit thats colossal  
Apostle of the green bud see me bleemed up  
In my 430 Lexus off in Texas teamed up  
With the Darkman and were blazing  
Some headbanging shit yo the Icell come equipped  
  
To spit with the best cause Im all about mine  
I got dimes of smoke thatll make you float on cloud nine  
  
Then I shine just like a beacon in the night  
Pass me the Thai I get high on the mic  
For real a zig zag story for my peeps  
Bangin in the Jeeps while you slang it in the streets  
Like Napalm Im way gone and now its time to bounce  
  
Its the weed song come with me and smoke an ounce  
  
Chorus repeat
