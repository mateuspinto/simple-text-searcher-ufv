Oh Saturday night  
Mmm everyones having fun  
Im down at the laundromat  
Trying to get my washing done  
Like I done before  
Time and time again  
Watching the clothes go round  
Another week sees its end  
  
Watching the clothes go round  
Watching the clothes go round  
Watching the clothes go round  
Watching the clothes go round  
  
Oh Ive been working hard  
Mmm trying to make some money  
would you like sour cream  
On your potato honey  
I been kissing ass  
Trying to keep it clean  
Serving the middle class  
Yeah its a clean routine  
  
Watching the clothes go round  
Watching the clothes go round  
Watching the clothes go round  
Watching the clothes go round  
  
There go the whites  
Mmm getting whiter  
There go the colors  
Getting brighter  
There go the dedicates  
Through the final rinse  
There goes my Saturday night  
I go without a fight  
  
Watching the clothes go round  
Watching the clothes go round  
Watching the clothes go round  
Watching the clothes go round
