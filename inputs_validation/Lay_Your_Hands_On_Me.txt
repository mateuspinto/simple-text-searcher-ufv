Sat in the corner of the Garden Grill with plastic flowers on the window sil  
No more miracles loaves and fishes been so busy with the washing of the
dishes  
Reaction levels much too high  I can do without the stimuli  
  
Im living way beyond my ways and means living in the zone of the inbetweens  
I can see the flashes on the frozen ocean static charge of the cold emotion  
Watched on by the distant eyes  watched on by the silent hidden spies  
  
But still the warmth flows through me  
And I sense you know me well  
No luck no golden chances  
No mitigating circumstances now  
Its only common sense  
There are no accidents around here  
  
I am willing  lay your hands on me  
I am ready  lay your hands on me  
I believe  lay your hands on me over me  
  
Working in gardens thornless roses fat men play with their garden hoses  
Poolside laughter has a cynical bite sausage speared by the cocktail
satellite  
I walk away from from light and sound down stairways leading underground  
  
But still the warmth flows through me  
And I sense you know me well  
Its only common sense  
There are no accidents around here  
  
I am willing  lay your hands on me  
I am ready  lay your hands on me  
I believe  lay your hands on me over me over me  
  
Lay your hands on me  
Lay your hands on me  
Lay your hands on me over me
