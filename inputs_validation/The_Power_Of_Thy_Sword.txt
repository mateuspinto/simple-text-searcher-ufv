Lord of battle I pray on bended knee conquest by the rising sun  
Ill wait for thy command with flame and blood at hand  
glory and a broken sword  
  
Im the master of the world I have no fear of man or beast  
Born inside the soul of the world  
Riding hard breaking bone with steel and stone  
Eternal might I was born to wield  
  
Let us drink to the battles weve lived and weve fought  
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought  
Great heroes charge into the fight  
From the north to the south in the black of night  
  
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall  
Gods of war feel the power of my sword  
  
Drink to the battles weve lived and weve fought  
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought  
Great heroes charge into the fight  
From the north to the south in the black of night  
  
Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle  
I laugh at my fate  
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled  
Youre never forgiven death is fulfilled   
  
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall  
Gods of war feel the power of my sword  
  
The clash of honor calls  
I will stand when others fall  
Open magic doors  
The will know the power of my sword  
  
There is blood in my hands there is blood in my eyes  
With blood in my voice I scream as you die  
Thirsting for vengeance and mounds of the slain  
Shaking the forest onto the plain  
  
Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle  
I laugh at my fate  
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled  
Youre never forgiven death is fulfilled   
  
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall  
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
