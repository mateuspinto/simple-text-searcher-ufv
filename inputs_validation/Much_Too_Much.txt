Much too much to bear  
Your love is hard and fast  
Your love will always last  
If its you I need  
Ive got to pay the levy  
Got to pay  
Cause your loves too heavy on me  
And its much too much to bear  
If I ever leave you darlin  
I hope you see  
That I really love you  
But your loves too heavy on me  
And its much too much to bear  
When I make love to you  
Do all the things you want me to do  
You never think of me  
Always cry a bevy  
Bevy of tears  
Cause your loves too heavy on me  
And its much too much to bear  
There was a time I could give all I had to you  
But my enthusiasm waned and I cant bear the pain  
Of doing what I dont want to do  
Much too much to bear  
Your love is hard and fast  
Your love will always last  
If its you I need  
Ive got to pay the levy  
Got to pay  
Cause your loves too heavy on me  
And its much too much to bear
