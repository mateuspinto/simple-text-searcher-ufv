Diamonds on the windshield as heaven starts to cry  
In his rearview mirror his angle waves goodbye  
She knows hes got to go she knows hes one of them  
  
Chorus  
Brothers of the highway children of the wind  
That Detroit diesel pirate ship goes rollin out again  
Sailin for that settin sun freedoms your best friend  
Brothers of the highway children of the wind  
  
He putts the peddle to the metal trying to out run the rain  
Another shot of truck stop coffee goes runnin through his veins  
This country turns on eighteen wheels thank god we can depend on  
  
Chorus  
  
Carolina west to Denver Batton Rouge east to Pittsburgh Portland south to
San Diego sail on sail on Tallahassee north to Boston up to  
Bangor west to Austin coast to coast sea to sea sail on sail on you  
  
Chorus  
  
God bless you brothers of the highway children of the wind
