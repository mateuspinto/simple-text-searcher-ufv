On the corner of Government and Bay Avenue  
The old doomsday fanatic wore a crown of kudzu  
Sirens where wailing in the gulf coastal heat  
And it seemed like the whole world was in forced retreat  
I paid no attention revolved through the door  
Passed the newspaper rack on the worn marble floor  
Near civil war history my heart skipped a beat  
She was standing on fiction stretched high on bare feet  
  
Love in the library quiet and cool  
Love in the library there are no rules  
Surrounded by stories surreal and sublime  
I fell in love in the library once upon a time  
  
I was the pirate and she was the queen  
Sir Francis and Elizabeth the best theres ever been  
Then she strolled past my table and stopped at the stairs  
Then sent me a smile as she reached for Flaubert  
  
Love in the library quiet and cool  
Love in the library there are no rules  
Surrounded by stories surreal and sublime  
I fell in love in the library once upon a time  
  
She gathered her books walked while she read  
Words never spoken but so much was said  
You can read all you want into this rendezvous  
But its safer than most things that lovers can do  
Well stories have endings and fantasies fade  
The guard by the door starts drawing the shade  
So write your own ending and hope they come true  
For the lovers and strangers on Bay Avenue  
  
Love in the library quiet and cool  
Love in the library there are no rules  
Surrounded by stories surreal and sublime  
I fell in love in the library once upon a time
