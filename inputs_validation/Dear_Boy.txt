I guess you never knew  
Dear boy what you had found  
I guess you never knew  
Dear boy that she was just the cutest thing around  
I guess you never knew what you had found  
Dear boy  
  
I guess you never saw  
Dear boy that love was there  
And maybe when you look too hard  
Dear boy you never do become aware  
I guess you never did become aware  
Dear boy  
  
When I stepped in my heart was down and out  
But her love came through and brought me round  
Got me up and about  
  
When I stepped in my heart was down and out  
But her love came through and brought me round  
Got me up and about  
  
I hope you never know dear boy  
How much you missed  
And even when you fall in love  
Dear boy it wont be half as good as this  
I hope you never know how much you missed dear boy  
  
I stepped in my heart was down and out  
But her love came through and brought me round  
Got me up and about  
Dear boy how much you missed  
Dear boy
