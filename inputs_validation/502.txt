Pull over shithead this is the cops  
Full tank pockets lined with cash  
Full throttle gonna rip some ass  
Drive all day and through the night  
Romance the road winding left to right  
The stars above guide me the moonlight is free  
A feeling inside me and the whole world to see  
Driving fast makes me feel good  
The speed of light trapped under my hood  
Breaking laws cause theres nothing to do  
Driving the interstate stopped for a 502  
Hundreds of miles rolled off today  
Signs lose their meanings minutes tick away  
Dirt roads to interstates I must have drove them all  
Cigarettes and burgers caffeine and alcohol  
Drive until daybreak always on the go  
Life on the freeway night shift til dawn patrol  
Driving fast makes me feel good  
The speed of light trapped under my hood  
Breaking laws cause theres nothing to do  
Driving the interstate stopped for a 502  
Stopped for a 502 next time its gonna be you  
Stars above guide me  
This feeling inside me  
I drive until daybreak  
Life on the freeway is Hell  
Im coming through
