Goodnight Sweet Jesus  
Guard us in sleep  
Our souls and bodies  
In thy love keep     
Waking or sleeping  
Keep us in sight  
Dear gentle saviour  
Goodnight goodnight     
Goodnight Dear Jesus  
Goodnight goodnight     
Goodnight Sweet Jesus  
Pray that each day  
Of our lives mortal  
Thus pass away    
Thy love oer watching  
Guiding our right  
Dear gentle saviour  
Goodnight goodnight     
Goodnight Dear Jesus  
Goodnight goodnight
