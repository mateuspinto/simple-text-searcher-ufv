We both lie silently still  
In the dead of the night  
Although we both lie close together  
We feel miles apart inside  
  
Was it something I said or something I did  
Did my words not come out right  
Though I tried not to hurt you  
Though I tried  
But I guess thats why they say  
  
Chorus  
Every rose has its thorn  
Just like every night has its dawn  
Just like every cowboy sings his sad sad song  
Every rose has its thorn  
Yeah it does  
  
I listen to our favorite song  
Playing on the radio  
Hear the dj say loves a game  
Of easy come and easy go  
But I wonder does he know  
Has he ever felt like this  
And I know youd be here right now  
If I could have let you know somehow  
I guess  
  
Chorus  
  
Though its been a while now  
I can still feel so much pain  
Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals  
But the scar that scar remains  
  
I know I could have saved our love that night  
If Id known what to say  
Instead of makin love  
We both made our separate ways  
But now I hear you found somebody new  
And that I never meant that much to you  
To hear that tears me up inside  
And to see you cuts me like a knife  
I guess  
  
Chorus
