One evening getting dark  
We first met at the park  
Just sitting by the fountain all alone  
I lifted up my hat  
And then began to chat  
She said shed allow me to see her at her home  
Chorus  
Such a star Ive never seen  
Shes as pretty as the queen  
Shes as perfect as an angel from above  
If shed only be my wife  
Id live happy all me life  
With that aggravating beauty lulu walls  
If she were only mine  
Id build a house so fine  
And around it so many fences tall  
It would make me jealously  
To think that none but me  
Could gaze upon that beauty lulu walls  
Repeat chorus  
One evening getting late  
Well I met her at the gate  
I asked her if shed wed me in the fall  
But she only turned away  
And nothing would she say  
That aggravating beauty lulu walls  
Repeat chorus  
With that aggravating beauty lulu walls
