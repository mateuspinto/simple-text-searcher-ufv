It would be so nice  
It would be so nice  
It would be so nice  
To meet sometime  
Everybody wakes and in the morning  
Hot tea and cant stop yawning  
Pass the butter please  
Have you ever read the daily standard  
Reading all about the plane thats landed  
Upside down  
And no one knows what I did today  
There can be no other way  
But I would just like to say  
It would be so nice  
It would be so nice  
It would be so nice  
To meet sometime  
It would be so nice  
It would be so nice  
It would be so nice  
To meet sometime  
Everybody cares about the weather  
And everybody should know better  
What a waste of time  
Everybody lives beneath the ceiling  
Living out a dream that sends them reeling  
To a distant place  
But no one knows what I did today  
There can be no other way  
But I would just like to say  
It would be so nice  
It would be so nice  
It would be so nice  
To meet sometime  
It would be so nice  
It would be so nice  
It would be so nice  
To meet sometime  
It would be so nice  
It would be so nice  
It would be so nice  
To meet sometime
