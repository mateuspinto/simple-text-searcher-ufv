Real frights the story of a maddening darkness  
It leaves your hands and your face real tight  
Your mind starts to wander while your body starts shaking  
Your mouth feels dry as your bones start aching  
  
You want to know the pattern has has gripped your life  
Your heart starts pounding while youre breathing real fright  
A face chalk white that starts the sight  
Ears hear the sounds of real fright
