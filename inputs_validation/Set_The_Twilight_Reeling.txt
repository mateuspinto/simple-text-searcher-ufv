Take me for what I am a star newly emerging  
Long simmering explodes inside the self is reeling  
In the pocket of the heart in the rushing of the blood  
In the muscle of my sex in the mindful mindless love  
I accept the new found man and set the twilight reeling  
  
At 5 am the moon and the sun sit set before my window  
Light glances off the blue glass we set right before the window  
And you who accept in your soul and your head  
What was misunderstood what was thought of with dread  
A new self is born the other self dead  
I accept the new found man and set the twilight reeling  
  
A soul singer stands on the stage the spotlight shows him sweating  
He sinks to one knee Seems to cry the horn are unrelenting  
But as the drums beats he finds himself growing hard  
In the microphones face he sees her face growing large  
And the swelling crescendo no longer retards  
I accept the new found man and set the twilight reeling  
  
As the twilight sunburst gleams  
As the chromium moon it sets  
As I lose all my regrets and set the twilight reeling  
I accept the new found man and set the twilight reeling
