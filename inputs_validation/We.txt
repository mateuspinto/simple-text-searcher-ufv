We re born  
We re crying  
We fall  
We re trying  
We re little  
We re laughing  
We re lonely sometimes  
  
We grow  
We re open  
We re lost  
We re hoping  
We re careful  
We re calling  
We re leaving behind  
  
You say we need to work together  
With love and care for everyone  
Without the fighting and the anger  
You say the world could be as one  
  
But every time that you say we  
Do you think about me  
 cause every time that you say we  
I hope you think about me  
  
We re strong  
We re chosen  
We re scared  
We re frozen  
We re hardened  
We re hopeful  
We re holding at bay  
  
We take  
We re giving  
We shake  
We re living  
We re lovers  
We re sinners  
We re running away  
  
And if we fail to make a difference  
And if our hope is almost gone  
Despite the fighting and the anger  
You say the world could be as one  
  
But every time that you say we  
Do you think about me  
 cause every time that you say we  
I hope you think about me  
  
And every time that you say we  
Do you think about me  
 cause every time that you say we  
I hope you think about me
