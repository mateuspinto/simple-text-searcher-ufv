If you go down to deep elm put your money in your shoes  
The women in deep elem they give you the deep elem blues  
Oh sweet mama your daddys got them deep elem blues  
Once I had a girlfriend she meant the world to me  
She went down to deep elem now she aint what she used to be  
Once I knew a preacher preached the bible through and through  
He went sown to deep elem now his preaching days are through  
When you go down to deep elem to have a little fun  
Have your ten dollars ready when the police man comes  
When yo go down to deep elem put your money in your pants  
Cause the women in deep elem they dont give a man a chance  
Oh sweet mama your daddys got them deep elem blues
