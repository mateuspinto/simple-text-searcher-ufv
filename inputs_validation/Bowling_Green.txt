Way down in Bowling Green the prettiest girls Ive ever seen  
A man in Kentucky sure is lucky to love down in Bowling Green  
Bowling Green folks treat you kind better you think your own mind  
A man in Kentucky sure is lucky in Bowling Green you walk your own line  
Kentucky sunshine makes the heart unfold  
It warms your body and I know it touches the soul  
The bluegrass is fine Kentucky owns my mind  
  
Fields down in Bowling Green have the softest grass Ive ever seen  
A man in Kentucky sure is lucky to lie down in Bowling Green  
  
Kentucky sunshine makes the heart unfold  
Bowling Green girls treat you right they wear dresses cut country tight  
A man in Kentucky sure is lucky he seen the Bowling Green night  
A man in Kentucky well he sure is lucky he seen the Bowling Green night  
A man in Kentucky well he sure is lucky he seen the Bowling Green night
