Have you seen my girlfriend  
She lives in a pig pen  
Have you seen my girlfriend  
I cant seem to find her  
Perhaps she is hiding  
Underneath a blade of grass  
CHORUS  
Lets take the whole day off  
Lets take the whole day off  
Lets take the whole day off     
Have you seen my new house  
Looks just like a dog house  
Have you seen my new house  
Someone saw it walking  
Straight into the ocean  
He thought it was an ivory boat  
CHORUS  
BRIDGE  
Maybeits just a bad dream and Ill wake up soon  
But I dont think Ill be so lucky  
Maybeits just one of those strange days when nothing seems right  
No nothing seems right at all  
Went up to a pay phone on a bathroom wall  
But I cant remember who I want to call  
Operator can you help me  
Have you seen my garden  
It is most peculiar  
Have you seen my garden  
Nothing there that grows  
Looks anything at all like plants  
I hear their voices     
Lets take the whole day off     
CHORUS  
Have you seen my girlfriend  
Have you seen my girlfriend
