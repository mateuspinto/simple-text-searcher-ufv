Oh you know well get it right this time I could be up  
There with you so high girl I really love you baby  
Oh and I say living my life in my own kind of way this  
Time this time this time smacked on my chin but Im back  
With a grin this time this time this time I know I was  
Wrong but I wont go it alone this time this time this time  
It wont be the same if you stay with me baby  
Heaven so high I see you so clear making up this time  
Oh you know well get it right this time this time will be  
For sure I could be up there with you some time girl this  
Time will be for sure I really love you baby  
Its been a year but where theres love there is nothing to  
Fear this time this time this time made my mistakes but  
No foot on the brakes this time  
Heaven so wide it seemed so clear time after time after  
Time  
Look at the way love has gone up there in your lonely room  
Tonight look at yourself pretty one I could be holding you  
Oh so tight  
You know well get it right this time this time will be for  
Sure I could be up there with you so high girl this time  
Will be for sure I really love you baby  
Look at the way love has gone talk about talk about talk  
About talk about dont let it disappear now up there  
Alone in your room every night isnt it sad what I see all  
Alone all alone all alone all alone is this the way it should  
Be open the book and then take one mad look back  
Oh you know well get it right this time this time will be  
For sure I could be up there with you so high girl this time  
Will be for sure  
I really love you baby oh you know well get it right this  
Time I could be up there with you so tight girl this time  
Will be for sure I really love you baby  
Oh you know well get it right this time oh you know  
Well get it right this time will be for sure oh you know  
Well get it right this time oh you know well get it right  
This time this time will be for sure girl
