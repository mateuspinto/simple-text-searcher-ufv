Take a listen  
Around you  
All the people  
That crowd around  
In your house  
  
Theyve been wanting  
To kill you  
In your sleep  
  
Take a load off  
And bow down  
To the others  
Who love to call you their names  
  
Theyve been wanting  
To kill you  
In your sleep  
  
And all the bull  
That people sling  
It doesnt matter  
What they sing  
  
So jump out  
Jump out  
Get your groove on  
This one  
Is for you  
So come on  
Get out  
Your house girl  
And give me a kiss  
  
And all the bull  
That people sling  
It doesnt matter  
What they sing  
  
So jump out  
Jump out  
Get your groove on  
This one  
Is for you  
So come on  
Get out  
Your house girl  
And give me a kiss  
  
Take a load off  
And bow down  
To the others  
Who love to call you their names  
  
They love to call you their names  
They love to call you their names
