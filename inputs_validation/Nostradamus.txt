They never broke my will  
cause my heart was strong  
They would justify  
Condemnation by invitation  
I will survive  
  
Stood my ground till the end  
Engaged the enemy  
Protect my friends  
  
Nostradamus Nostradamus  
  
Tame the beast  
They send to kill  
The congregation never broke my will  
  
Nostradamus Nostradamus  
  
He has overcome  
He can take the throne  
  
Chorus  
Nostradamus dedication  
Nostradamus is avenged  
Nostradamus our salvation  
Nostradamus is avenged  
  
I walked through fire to justify  
Their inquisitions now condemned to die  
  
Nostradamus Nostradamus  
  
Adversity on which I thrived  
Destroys the alter now Im vilified  
  
Nostradamus Nostradamus  
  
He has seized the day  
He is here to stay  
  
Chorus  
  
Vindication  
Ha has been avenged  
  
They never broke my will  
Cause my heart was strong  
they cannot justify  
i will survive  
  
He has overpowered  
This his finest hour  
  
Chorus  
  
Nostradamus  
Nostradamus  
Nostradamus  
Nostradamus
