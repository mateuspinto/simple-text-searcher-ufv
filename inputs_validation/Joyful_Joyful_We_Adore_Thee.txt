Joyful joyful we adore thee  
God of glory lord of love  
Hearts unfold like flowers before thee  
Opening to the sun above  
Melt the clouds of sin and sadness  
Drive the dark of doubt away  
Giver of immortal gladness  
Fill us with the light of day  
  
All thy work with joy surround thee  
Earth and heavenreflect thy rays  
Stars and angels sing around thee  
Center of unbroken praise  
Field and forest vale and mountain  
Chanting bird and flowing fountain  
Call us to rejoice in thee  
  
Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah rejoice  
  
Mortals join the mighty chorus  
Which the morning stars began  
Father love is reignning oer us  
Brother love binds man to man  
Ever singing march we onward  
Victors in the midst we strife  
Joyful music leads us sunward  
In the triumph song of life  
In the triumph song of life
