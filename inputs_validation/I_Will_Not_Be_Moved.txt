I have been a wayward child  
I have acted out  
I have questioned sovereignty  
And had my share of doubts  
  
And though sometimes  
My prayers feel like theyre bouncing off the sky  
The hand that holds wont let me go  
And is the reason why  
  
I will stumble I will fall down  
But I will not be moved  
I will make mistakes I will face heartache  
But I will not be moved  
  
On Christ the solid rock I stand  
All other ground is sinking sand  
I will not be moved  
  
Bitterness has plagued my heart  
Many times before  
My life has been a broken glass  
That I have kept restored  
Of all my shattered dreams  
And though it seemed  
  
That I was far too gone  
My brokenness helped me to see  
Its grace Im standing on  
  
I will stumble I will fall down  
But I will not be moved  
I will make mistakes I will face heartache  
But I will not be moved  
  
On Christ the solid rock I stand  
All other ground is sinking sand  
I will not be moved  
  
And chaos in my life  
Has been a badge of war  
And though I have been torn  
I will not be moved  
  
I will make mistakes I will face heartache  
But I will not be moved  
  
On Christ the solid rock I stand  
All other ground is sinking sand  
I will not be moved
