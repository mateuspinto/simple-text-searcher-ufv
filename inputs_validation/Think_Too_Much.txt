They say that the left side of the brain  
Controls the right  
They say that the right side  
Has to work hard all night  
Maybe I think too much for my own good  
Some people say so  
Other people say no no  
The fact is  
You dont think as much as you could  
Hmmm  
  
I had a childhood that was mercifully brief  
I grew up in a state of disbelief  
I started to think too much  
When I was twelve going on thirteen  
Me and the girls from St Augustine  
Up in the mezzanine  
Thinking about God  
Maybe I think too much  
Maybe I think too much  
Maybe I think too much  
Maybe I think too much  
  
Have you ever experienced a period of grace  
When your brain just takes a seat behind your face  
And the world begins The Elephant Dance  
Everythings funny  
Everyones sunny  
You take out your money  
And walk down the road  
That leads me to the girl I love  
The girl Im always thinking of  
  
But maybe I think too much  
And I ought to just hold her  
Stop trying to mold her  
Maybe blindfold her  
And take her away  
Maybe I think too much  
Maybe I think too much  
Maybe I think too much  
Maybe I think too much
