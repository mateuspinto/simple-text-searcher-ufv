Put your life into their hands  
Die for someone else  
Now youre in the real world  
Where pain and death are felt  
  
The first blood shed does not seem real  
Reality is what you feel  
Dropping to your knees you pray  
God wont make this go away  
  
You will not return alive  Left to die  
Suffering until the end  Left to die  
  
Time stands still as you pass away  
No more tomorrow this is your last day  
On this fucking earth  
  
Bodies fall onto the ground  
Blood flies through the air  
Shredded victims lie in pain  
Death is never fair  
  
Legs blown off all hope is lost  
A human life is what it cost  
Others follow close behind  
A real adventure they will find  
  
You will not return alive  
Left to die  
Suffering until the end  
Left to die
