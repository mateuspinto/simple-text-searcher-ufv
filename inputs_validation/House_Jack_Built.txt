Open doors so I walk inside  
Close my eyes find my place to hide  
And I shake as I take it in  
Let the show begin  
Open my eyes  
Just to have them close again  
Well on my way  
On my way to where I graze  
It swallows me  
As it takes me in his home  
I twist away  
As I kill this world  
Open doors so I walk inside  
Close my eyes find my place to hide  
And I shake as I take it in  
Let the show begin  
Open my eyes  
Just to have them close once again  
Dont want control  
As It takes me down and down again  
Is that the moon  
Or just a light that lights this dead end street  
Is that you there  
Or just another demon that I meet  
The higher you are  
The farther you fall  
The longer the walk  
The farther you crawl  
My body my temple  
This temple it tells  
Step into the house that Jack built  
The higher you walk  
The farther you fall  
The longer the walk  
The farther you crawl  
My body my temple  
This temple it tells  
Yes this is the house that Jack built  
Open doors as I walk inside  
Swallow me so the pain subsides  
And I shake as I take this in  
Let the show begin  
The higher you are  
The farther you fall  
The longer the walk  
The farther you crawl  
My body my temple  
This temple it tells  
Yes this is the house that Jack built  
The higher you walk  
The farther you fall  
The longer the walk  
The farther you crawl  
My body my temple  
This temple it tells  
Yes I am I am I am  
Open my eyes  
It swallows me  
Is that you there  
I twist away  
Away  
Away  
Away
