My name is frank davis drive up Dixie 109  
I was out on Highway 17 just south of the camden line  
It was down there in heart of Wilsonville where I met my fate  
She was standing outside a barroom said she was waitin for a date  
but I knew that was just a line  
And I knew I was messin with the losin kind  
  
well I knew what we were both doin and I knew that u cant win  
But when the light turned green I reached across the seatpopped the lock and
she slid in  
She said she liked Mexican music she knew a place if I had the time  
So we had a few drinks and we danced for a whileI pulled her close she didnt
mind  
And what I knew kinda slipped my mind  
And I couldnt resist her kiss with the losin kind  
  
Well we drove around in my Buick getting drunk and having fun  
We ended up at the Best Western out on Highway 101  
It was around 300am we went out to this empty little roadside bar  
It was there the cash register was open it was there I hit that guy real hard  
But I knew when I hit him for a second time  
that one attracts the other when there the losin kind  
  
Well I grabbed her hand to get out of there then I felt like I was gonna be
sick  
About a half hour later the sleet started comin down
