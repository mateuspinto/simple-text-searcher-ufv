Theres something in you child  
A mystery that I cant define  
But it blows my mind  
Im walking on air with you  
A kite in the sky  
Without a care  
Its something we share  
And all of these clues  
Lead me to you  
Hey Im so surprised  
Everything that fills my eyes  
Is about you and this new thing  
Hey Is it really true  
Everything I say and do  
Is about you and this new thing lo  
And if I feel blue child  
I come to you so free and so wild  
And I feel fine  
The little things you do I find  
Here in my eyes my heart and my mind  
Your sexy smile  
Your sense of style  
Your kiss  
Hey Im so surprised  
Everything that fills my eyes  
Is about you and this new thing  
Hey Is it really true  
Everything I say and do  
Is about you  
Hey It fells so good  
I never thought I ever would  
Find a new thing  
Such a new thing  
Hey One and one make two  
So everything I say and do is about you  
And this new thing love  
And this new thing Love
