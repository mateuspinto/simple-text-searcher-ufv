Through the windless wells of wonder  
By the throbbing light machine  
In a tea leaf trance or under  
Orders from the king and queen  
  
Songs to aging children come  
Aging children I am one  
  
People hurry by so quickly  
Dont they hear the melodies  
In the chiming and the clicking  
And the laughing harmonies  
  
Songs to aging children come  
Aging children I am one  
  
Some come dark and strange like dying  
Crows and ravens whistling  
Lines of weeping strings of crying  
So much said in listening  
  
Songs to aging children come  
Aging children I am one  
  
Does the moon play only silver  
When it strums the galaxy  
Dying roses will they will their  
Perfumed rhapsodies to me  
  
Songs to aging children came  
This is one
