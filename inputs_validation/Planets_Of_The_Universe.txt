The bright light is lying down  
The earth and the sea and the sky  
Is at rest with the ocean  
And the days go by  
  
They go into the seas that have no shores  
Haunted by that same closed door  
Looking up at skies on fire  
Leaving nothing left of us  
To discover  
  
And the planets of the universe Go their way  
Not astounded by the sun or the moon  
Or by the day  
You and I will simply disappear  
Out of sight  
Ooh but Im afraid soon therell be  
No light  
  
No doubt no pain  
Come ever again well let there be light in this lifetime  
In the cool silent moments  
Of the nighttime  
Of the nighttime  
  
And the planets of the universe  
Go their way  
Not astounded by the sun or the moon  
Or by the day  
We will never change again  
The way that we are changing  
Well you forget the chill of love but not the strain  
  
Now I know  
Well I was wrong to live for a dream  
If I had my life to live over  
I would never dream no  
I still wish you gone  
And I will live alone  
Yes I will live alone  
  
And the planets of the universe go their way  
I know you dont believe it  
Not astounded by the soon or moon or day  
I know you dont believe it  
You and I will simply disappear out of sight  
Well but Im afraid soon therell be no light  
  
You will never love again the way you love me  
You will never rule again the way youve ruled me  
You will never change again the way youre changing  
You will never rule again the way youve ruled me
