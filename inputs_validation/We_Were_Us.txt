Rearview crosses  
Railroad ties  
Oh Hail Marys  
Friday nights  
Heartbeat baby  
Lowbeam lights  
God I miss when you were mine  
  
Chorus  
Back when that song was a song  
I could sing along without thinkin bout you every time it came on  
Every beat every line every word every time  
When a road was a road  
I could roll on through without wishin that empty seat was you  
Money was gas dreams were dust  
Love was fast and we were us  
  
Shotgun sunset  
A cool mint kiss  
Backseat promise  
Breaking it  
Floorboard feeling  
County lines  
God I miss when you were mine  
  
Chorus  
  
In a sleepy town just jumping in  
Far too young to know that summers end  
We were us we cant go back  
Its what it is but God I miss  
  
Chorus  
  
Every beat every line every word every single time  
I just close my eyes and youre ridin shotgun  
You and me baby on the run  
I can feel your heartbeat baby
