The scattered pages of a book by the sea  
Held by the sand washed by the waves  
A shadow forms cast by a cloud  
Skimming by as eyes of the past but the rising tide  
Absorbs them effortlessly claiming  
  
They told of one who tired of all singing  
Praise him praise him  
We heed not flatterers he cried  
By our command waters retreat  
Show my power halt at my feet  
But the cause was lost  
Now cold winds blow  
  
For from the north overcast ranks advance  
Fear of the storm accusing with rage and scorn  
The waves surround the sinking throne  
Singing Crown him crown him  
Those who love our majesty show themselves  
All bent their knees  
  
But he forced a smile even though  
His hopes lay dashed where offerings fell where they fell  
Nothing can my peace destroy as long as none smile  
More opened ears and opened eyes  
And soon they dared to laugh  
See a little man with his face turning red  
Though his storys often told you can tell hes dead
