Say no more  
I think youll never understand  
I have refused the same demand  
All my life  
  
Say no more  
In my book there can be no blame  
When you pretend I have no shame  
Youre half right  
  
All along  
You kept trying to pin me down  
Turn me into your house clown  
If I dont fit the bill  
All the same  
I loved you then  
I love you still  
  
Chorus   
Want to know the truth  
I caught a nasty bug  
And when it got a hold of me  
I could not shake it free  
A lasting blue note  
Has been haunting me  
Its like an old mistress  
Forever chasing me  
  
But say no more  
I may not be an easy man  
But the way you played your hand  
I couldnt stand  
  
Its too bad  
There is much more we could have done  
But now those days are dead and gone  
Nothing lasts  
  
All along  
You made me feel this useless guilt  
Can you look back on what we built  
I wonder what you saw in me  
Tell me was it real  
Was it love  
You tell me  
  
Chorus   
  
And though you think of it  
As the cause of my fall  
Never mind Im blessed Im here at all
