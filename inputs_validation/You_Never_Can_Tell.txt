It was a teenage wedding  
And the old folks wished em well  
You could see that pierre  
Did truly love the mademoiselle  
And the young monsieur and madame  
Have rung the chapel bell  
seeest la vie  
say the old folks  
It goes to show that you never can tell  
They furnished off an apartment  
With a two room roebuck sale  
The coolerator was filled  
With tv dinners and ginger ale  
But when pierre found work  
The little money comin worked out well  
seeest la vie  
say the old folks  
It goes to show that you never can tell  
They had a hifi phono  
Boy did they let it blast  
Seven hundred little records  
All rock rhythm and jazz  
But when the sun went down  
The rapid tempo of the music fell  
seeest la vie  
say the old folks  
It goes to show that you never can tell  
They bought a souped up jitney  
twas a cherry in fiftythree  
They drove it down to new orleans  
To celebrate their anniversary  
It was there where pierre was wedded  
To the lovely mademoiselle  
seeest la vie  
say the old folks  
It goes to show that you never can tell  
It was a teenage wedding  
And the old folks wished em well  
You could see that pierre  
Did truly love the mademoiselle  
And the young monsieur and madame  
Have rung the chapel bell  
seeest la vie  
say the old folks  
It goes to show that you never can tell
