Verse 1  
Yo I had to reinvent I put the V in vent  
I put the heat in vents man I been competin since  
I look beyond what people sayin and I see intent  
Then I just sit back and decipher what they really meant  
Cherish these nights cherish these people  
Life is a movie but there will never be a sequel  
And Im good with that as long as Im peaceful  
As long as 7 years from now Im taking my daughter to preschool  
Cherish these days man do they go quick  
Just yesterday I swear it was 06  
Ten years ago thats when you proposed  
I look down yes I suppose  
  
Hook  
All things go all things go  
All things go all things go  
I feel a minute yeah we got it then its gone  
While we keep waiting for a moment til it falls  
So cant nobody ever tell me that Im wrong  
Cause Ima ride Im with you still the night is young  
We keep goin we go we go we go  
We wake back up and do it all again  
We know we know say fuck the world we ridin til the end  
I know its sudden look at what weve become  
I just want you to know that I did it all for you  
  
Verse 2  
I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence  
His sister said he wanted to stay with me but I didnt invite him  
Why didnt he ask or am I just buggin  
Cause since I got fame they dont act the same  
Even though they know that I love him  
Family ties broken before me niggas trynna kill him he aint even call me  
And thats the reflection of me yes I get it I get it it was all me  
I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes the last day he saw me

Verse 3  
Let me make this clear Im not difficult Im just about my business  
Im not into fake industry parties and fake agendas  
Rock with people for how they make me feel not what they give me  
Even the ones that hurt me the most I still show forgiveness  
I love my mother more than life itself and thats a fact  
Id give it all if I could somehow just rekindle that  
She never understands why Im so overprotective  
The more I work the more I feel like somehow theyre neglected  
I want Caiah to go to college just to say We did it  
My child with Aaron wouldve been sixteen any minute  
So in some ways I feel like Caiah is the both of them  
Its like hes Caiahs little angel looking over him  
And I know Jelani will always love me and Ill always love him  
And Im just his little sister not Nicki Minaj when Im around him  
Yeah we did it lets leave this imprint  
Just finished writing this is The Pinkprint  
  
Hook  
All things go all things go
