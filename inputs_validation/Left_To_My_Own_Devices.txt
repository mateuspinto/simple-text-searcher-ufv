I get out of bed at half past ten  
Phone up a friend whos a party animal  
Turn on the news and drink some tea  
Maybe if youre with me well do some shopping  
  
One day Ill read or learn to drive a car  
If you pass the test you can beat the rest  
But I dont like to compete or talk street street street  
I can pick up the best from the party animal  
  
I could leave you say goodbye  
Or I could love you if I try  
And I could  
And left to my own devices I probably would  
Left to my own devices I probably would  
  
Pick up a brochure about the sun  
Learn to ignore what the photographer saw  
I was always told that you should join a club  
Stick with the gang if you want to belong  
  
I was a lonely boy no strength no joy  
In a world of my own at the back of the garden  
I didnt want to compete or play out on the street  
For in a secret life I was a round head general  
  
I could leave you say goodbye  
Or I could love you if I try  
And I could  
And left to my own devices I probably would  
Left to my own devices I probably would  
Oh I would  
  
I was faced with a choice at a difficult age  
Would I write a book Or should I take to the stage  
But in the back of my head I heard distant feet  
Che Guevara and Debussy to a disco beat  
  
Its not a crime when you look the way you do  
The way I like to picture you  
When I get home its late at night  
I pour a drink and watch the fight  
  
Turn off the TV look at a book  
Pick up the phone fix some food  
Maybe Ill sit up all night and day  
Waiting for the minute I hear you say  
  
I could leave you say goodbye  
Or I could love you if I try  
And I could  
And left to my own devices I probably would  
Come on baby say goodbye  
I could love you if I try  
And I could  
And left to my own devices I probably would  
Left to my own devices I probably would  
  
Out of bed at half past ten  
The party animal phones a friend  
Picks up news about the sun  
And the working day has just begun  
  
Sticks with the gang  at the back of the street  
Pass the test  and dont compete  
  
Drive the car if youre with me  
Che Guevaras drinking tea  
He reads about a new device  
And takes to the stage in a secret life  
  
Aaaaaaaah ce  
  
Left to my own devices I probably would  
If I was left to my own devices I possibly would  
  
Aaaaaaaah ce  
  
If I was left to my own devices I probably would  
Left to my own devices I probably would  
  
I could leave you say goodbye  
Or I could love you if I try  
And I could  
And left to my own devices I probably would  
Left to my own devices I probably would  
Come on baby  
Left to my own devices I probably would
