We are not the sons of God  
We are not his chosen people now  
We have crossed the path he trod  
We will feel the pain of his beginning  
  
Shadow fingers rise above  
Iron fingers stab the desert sky  
Oh behold the power of the Earth  
Are your children ready for the fall  
  
Locking hands together well  
Raze a city build a living hell  
Join the race to suicide  
Listen for the tolling of the bell  
  
Out of the the universe a strange light is born  
Unholy union trinity reformed  
  
Yellow sun its evil twin  
in the black the winds deliver him  
We will sleep to souls within  
At a siege a nuclear gust is riven  
  
Out of the the universe a strange light is born  
Unholy union trinity reformed  
  
Out of the darkness brighter than a thousand suns  
Out of the darkness brighter than a thousand suns  
Out of the darkness brighter than a thousand suns  
Out of the darkness brighter than a thousand suns  
Out of the darkness brighter than a thousand suns  
Out of the darkness brighter than a thousand suns  
  
Burying our morals and burying our dead  
Burying our head in the sand  
E equals MC squared you cant relate  
How we made God with our hands  
  
Whatever would Robert have said to his God  
About he made war with the Sun  
E equals MC squared you cant relate  
How we made God with our hands  
  
All nations are rising  
Through acid bells of love and hate  
Chain medals of Satan  
Uncertainty led us all to this  
  
All nations are raising  
Through acid bells of love and hate  
Confusion and Fury  
  
This body carried em down in vain  
I was preaching of a small pray  
In the bunker where well die  
Were the executioners that lie  
  
Bombers launched with no recall  
Minute warning of the missile fall  
Take a look at your last day  
Guessing you wont have the time to cry  
  
Out of the the universe a strange light was born  
Unholy union trinity reformed  
  
Out of the darkness  
Out of the darkness  
Out of the darkness brighter than a thousands suns  
Out of the darkness brighter than a thousands suns  
Out of the darkness brighter than a thousands suns  
Out of the darkness brighter than a thousands suns  
Out of the darkness brighter than a thousands suns  
  
Holy father we have sinned
