Chorus  
How Do I Love Thee  
Let Me Count The Ways  
How Much Do I Love You  
Well Multiply Your Love By Infiniti  
Picture A Vision Of Beauty  
As We Dance By The Light Of The Moon  
Your Passion So Often Consumes Me  
Like The Lick Of A Native Tongue Tune  
Reality Is Ours To Create  
Fantasy Is Ours To Mold  
Dream My Love Dream  
With My Body And My Soul  
Question Out My Faith  
Im Pledged To Be Your Lover  
And After I Started Loving You  
I Knew Id Never Love Another  
Im Like A Child Within Your Arms  
Would You Come Inside And Play With Me  
Spend The Day With Me  
Have Your Way With Me  
Chorus  
Remember This Always  
My Sweet One  
No Lie Is True  
And Dude Its Not A Lie  
When I Say That  
I Would Die For You  
Youre So Deep Within Thee  
That Sometimes Your Just A Touch Away  
But I Cant Reach You  
I Seek You  
Come To Me  
But Then youre All Around Me  
You Just Surround Me  
And You Astound Me  
And I receive You  
Fore I Complete You  
It Pleases Me  
To Have You Touch Me There  
I Think You Know It Gets To Me  
Stop  
Dont Stop  
Ecstacy  
Chorus  
So Sweet  
I Adore You  
Come To Me  
Thats Right  
Come To Me  
How Do I Love Thee  
Let Me Count The Ways  
How Do I Love Thee  
Let Me Count The Ways  
Reality Is Ours To Create  
Fantasy Is Ours To Mold  
Dream My Love Dream  
With My Body And My Soul  
Question Out My Faith  
Im Pledged To Be Your Lover  
And After I Started Loving You  
I Knew Id Never Love Another  
Im Like A Child Within Your Arms  
Would You Come Inside And Play With Me  
Spend The Day With Me  
Have Your Way With Me  
Please Dont Go  
Happiness Is Nothing Without You  
Stay  
My Sweet One  
I Adore You  
Hold Me  
Come To Me  
Love Me  
Love Me
