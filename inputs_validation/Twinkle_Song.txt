Verse 1  
I had a dream  
Davie Bowie taught us how to skateboard  
But he was shaped like Gumby  
And I had a dream  
Took a helicopter  
Flew it up too high got stuck in the clouds  
Dont wanna come down  
And I had a dream  
We went on a safari  
I said look at that lion she reminds me of you  
Cause youre the queen  
And I had a dream  
That you were dying  
But I wasnt even crying I just sang you to sleep  
I sang you to sleep  
  
Chorus  
But what does it mean  
What does it all mean  
Oh I had a dream  
What did it mean  
What did it mean  
  
Verse 2  
And I had a dream  
We robbed the record store  
The one with the yellow door  
We stole every goddamn record they had  
And I had a dream  
That I didnt give a fuck  
But I give a fuck  
I miss you so bad I think I might die  
  
Chorus  Extended  
What does it mean  
What does it all mean  
Oh I had a dream  
What did it mean  
What did it mean  
I just wanna scream  
What does it mean  
What does it mean  
I just wanna scream  
I just wanna scream  
  
Bridge  
What does it mean  
What does it mean What does it mean  
I had a dream  
What does it mean What does it mean  
I had a dream  
But what does it mean What does it mean  
What does it all mean  
  
Verse 3  
And I had a dream  
We were being chased by a monster  
Maybe they were aliens  
But I wasnt scared cause you were there  
And I had a dream  
We took karate  
Thats when you said you loved me  
You loved me  
  
Outro  
What does it mean  
What does it all mean  
What does it mean  
What does it all mean  
Fuck yeah
