Back in the tomb Lucy is sitting on the floor  
I am I am standing by the door  
  
The door to freedom the door that I shut so close  
And as I take another look at my mind  
I seem to think the sun has arrived no  
  
McKenzie you better realize now its just you and I  
  
Back against the wall  
McKenzies on the stone cold floor  
Hands tied together nowhere to go for Mr Mayor  
  
The door to freedom the door that I shut so close  
And as I take another look at my mind  
I seem to think the sun has arrived  
  
This court is now in session  
  
You stand accused of child abuse  
Of stealing innocence and freedom too  
  
I am the only Judge I am the only Jury  
I am your lawyer too so tell me what to do  
  
Whats it gonna be   
Are you guilty or are you guilty  
Yes you just go ahead and cry  
  
Back against the wall  
McKenzies on the stone cold floor  
Hands tied together nowhere to go for Mr Mayor  
  
The door to freedom the door that I shut so close  
And as I take another look at my mind  
I seem to think the sun has arrived  
  
But oh no there is no sun here  
Theres only darkness  
  
I the jury and the judge  
Find you guilty of stealing the innocence of a child  
And therefore we sentence you to die slowly die  
Die die die die die die die
