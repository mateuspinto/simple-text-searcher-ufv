The handshake  
Seals the contract  
From the contract  
Theres no turning back  
The turning point  
Of a career  
A career of being insincere  
The holiday  
Was fun packed  
The contract  
Still intact  
The grabbing hands  
Grab all they can  
All for themselves  
After all  
Its a competitive world  
Everything counts in large amounts  
The graph  
On the wall  
Tells the story  
Of it all  
Picture it now  
See just how  
The lies and deceit  
Gained a little more power  
Confidence  
Taken in  
By a sun tan  
And a grin  
The grabbing hands  
Grab all they can  
All for themselves  
After all  
Its a competitive world  
Everything counts in large amounts  
The grabbing hands  
Grab all they can  
Everything counts in large amounts
