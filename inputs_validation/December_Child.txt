Close your eyes December Child  
And dream a while my little son and moon  
May the stars be your crown  
And may the earth guide you round and round  
  
Snuggle up and let me hold kiss  
Your baby breath in the dark and cold  
On a silent night long ago  
Another mother held her babe and told him  
  
Chorus  
Close your eyes December Child  
And dream a while my little son and moon  
May the stars be your crown  
And may the earth guide you round and round  
  
They had come such a long long way  
Rest your little head on me and Ill tell you of  
A little king and his bed of hay  
It is remembered every Christmas day  
  
Little one little son  
All my life Ive wished you welcome  
  
Chorus  
Close your eyes December Child  
And dream a while my little son and moon  
May the stars be your crown  
And may the earth guide you round and round
