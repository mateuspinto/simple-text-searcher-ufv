Did you not hear my lady  
Go down the garden singing  
Blackbird and thrush were silent  
To hear the alleys ringing  
O saw you not my lady  
Out in the garden there  
Shaming the rose and lily  
For she is twice as fair  
  
Though I am nothing to her  
Though she must rarely look at me  
And though I could never woo her  
I love her till I die  
  
Surely you heard my lady  
Go down the garden singing  
Silencing all the songbirds  
And setting the alleys ringing  
  
But surely you see my lady  
Out in the garden there  
Rivalling the glittering sunshine  
With a glory of golden hair
