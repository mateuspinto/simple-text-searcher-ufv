Green mansions high upon a hill  
Green mansions quiet and still  
Big wall all around  
Its where my baby will be found  
Waiting for that day to come  
  
Green mansions high upon a hill  
In the countryside where the birds begin to sing  
Free from the glamor of the world  
Where the story does unfurl  
Waiting on that day to come  
  
Tried in vain to forget  
Just how it ought to be  
Over and over and over and over again  
Bout what it means to me  
  
Green mansions I can hear the mocking bird  
Birds singing in a melancholy wood  
The big wall all around  
Where my baby will be found  
Waiting for that day to come  
  
Well Ive tried in vain to forget  
Yeah what it ought to be  
Over and over over again  
Just what it means to me  
  
Green mansions high upon a hill  
Green mansions quiet and still  
Big wall all around  
Where my baby will be found  
Waiting for that day to come  
  
Green mansions high upon a hill  
Green mansions quiet and still  
Big wall all around  
Where my baby will be found  
Waiting for that day to come
