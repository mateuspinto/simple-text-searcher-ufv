Flies are buzzing round my head  
Vultures circling the dead  
Picking up every last crumb  
The big fish eat the little ones  
The big fish eat the little ones  
Not my problem give me some  
  
Chorus  
You can try the best you can  
If you try the best you can  
The best you can is good enough  
If you try the best you can  
If you try the best you can  
The best you can is good enough  
  
This ones optimistic  
This one went to market  
This one just came out of the swamp  
This one dropped a payload  
Fodder for the animals  
Living on animal farm  
  
Chorus  
  
Id really like to help you man  
Id really like to help you man  
Nervous messed up marionettes  
Floating around on a prison ship  
  
If you try the best you can  
You can try the best you can  
The best you can is good enough  
You can try the best you can  
You try the best you can  
  
Dinosaurs roaming the Earth  
Dinosaurs roaming the Earth  
Dinosaurs roaming the Earth
