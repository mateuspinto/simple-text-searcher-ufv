It used to be a sweet sensation  
No price too high for love  
Now I pay for this bitter taste  
And the price is not enough  
  
Such cruel sport for your kicks  
Such hard knocks on my heart  
How long before the pain ends  
Tell me where living starts  
  
And lovers leap off burning buildings  
Waking up on a sky high wire  
Desperation leaves us clinging  
On the edge of a house on fire  
  
Lovers leap off burning buildings  
Live our life on borrowed time  
Every flame that ever moved you  
Touched your lips but never mine  
  
Lovers leap off burning buildings  
No room for conversation  
Cold stares and angry words  
Fall in pieces from our faces  
We read Do not disturb  
  
Some lovers just go hungry  
Others beg for just a bite  
You use me under pressure  
To whet your appetite
