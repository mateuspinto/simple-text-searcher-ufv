You make me strong You make me weak  
You lift me off my feet  
You give me hope when all my dreams seem like theyre out of reach  
Yeah yeah yeah  
You make me understand the way a perfect love should be  
You take me to a place so high I never wanna leave  
And sometimes I think of all the things I should have said  
I hope its not to late I wanna make you understand  
Oh Yeah  
If the world crashes down  
Over me  
I know that my life  
Is complete  
Cause I held you in my arms all night  
I cant imagine life without you by my side  
You whisper in my ear the words  
Just hold me close tonight hold me tonight  
And when the pain is holding me  
Your touch just sets me free  
And sometimes I think of all the things I should have said  
No No No Yeah  
I hope its not to late wanna make you understand  
Oh Yeah  
If the world crashes down  
Over me  
I know that my life  
Is complete  
Cause I held you in my arms all night  
Cause I cant imagine life without you by my side  
Vocals  
You make me weak You make me strong you give me hope  
You hold me close You make me weak you make me strong  
You give me hope you hold me close You make me weak  
You make me strong you give me hope You hold me close  
You take me High Oho  
If the world crashes down  
Over me  
I know then my life  
Is complete  
Cause I held you in my arms all night  
Cause I cant imagine life without you by my side
