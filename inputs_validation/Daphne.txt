Daphne  
Dont be ridiculous  
This silence is killing us  
Talk to me  
Speaking with a loving tongue  
Give life a sense of fun  
Daphne  
Dont be so cavalier  
All that you want is here  
Talk to me  
Speak with your pretty eyes  
Not without compromise  
  
If youre used to a life of farces  
Playing games of judge and jury  
You know when youre wearing those glasses  
You look like Nana Mouskouri  
  
Daphne  
Laugh and take silly time  
Leave sadness way behind  
Talk to me  
Tell jokes and belly laugh  
Dont cut your life in half  
  
Daphne  
Shelley wrote verse for you  
He would have wanted to  
Talk to me  
Saying I must be thick  
Love is a lunatic  
  
If youre used to a life of farces  
Playing games of judge and jury  
You know when youre wearing those glasses  
You look like Nana Mouskouri  
So you can be adjourned  
Daphne Im so concerned  
  
Daphne  
Dont be ridiculous  
This silence is killing us  
Talk to me
