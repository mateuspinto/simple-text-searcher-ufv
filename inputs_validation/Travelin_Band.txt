Seven thirty seven comin out of the sky  
Wont you take me down to Memphis on a midnight ride  
I want to move  
Playin in a travelin band  
Yeah  
Well Im flyin cross the land tryin to get a hand  
Playin in a travelin band  
  
Take me to the hotel baggage gone oh well  
Come on come on wont you get me to my room  
I want to move  
Playin in a travelin band  
Yeah  
Well Im flyin cross the land tryin to get a hand  
Playin in a travelin band  
  
Listen to the radio talkin bout the last show  
Someone got excited had to call the state militia  
Want to move  
Playin in a travelin band  
Yeah  
Well Im flyin cross the land tryin to get a hand  
Playin in a travelin band  
  
Here we come again on a Saturday night  
With your fussin and your fightin wont you get me to the rhyme  
I want to move  
Playin in a travelin band  
Yeah  
Well Im flyin cross the land tryin to get a hand  
Playin in a travelin band  
  
Wont you give myself a hand
