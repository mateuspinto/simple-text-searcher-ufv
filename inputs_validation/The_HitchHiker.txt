I dont know why it is every time I take a trip  
Its always raining somewhere down the line  
This particular night was in Prestonsburg Kentucky  
I stopped to give a country boy a ride  
  
I saw him running toward the car he carried an old suitcase  
A cigarette was dangling from his lips  
He threw the suitcase in the back and as he got inside  
He said Im sorry but Im awful wet  
  
I said Where are you headed kid And he said To Louisville  
Said he had an uncle there who ran a store  
Said his daddy died three weeks ago and they didnt own the place  
And they said he couldnt live there anymore  
  
He said his education was that he could read and write  
He quit school the time his dad got hurt  
Aint much goes on in Prestonsburg and he was seventeen  
And he had to go some place to find some work  
  
He talked about the girl whose father had a lot of money  
He said hed send and get her if he could  
His daddy taught him all there was about tobaccofarmin  
And he said he played the banjer pretty good  
  
We stopped to get a sandwich and the waitress brought a menu  
And I noticed that he read the prices first  
He ordered him a hot dog with a lot of table ketchup  
And water seemed to satisfy his thirst  
  
Well it took awhile but I insisted that I pay the ticket  
Excused myself and went out to the car  
He came out got in the car and handed me a quarter  
And he said You left this layin on the bar  
  
I dropped him off in Lexington and drove down to Bowling Green  
And I thought boy youll never make it without help  
And then I got to thinkin about the days when I was younger  
And I started out the same darn way myself  
  
Well I dont know why it is every time I take a trip  
Its always raining somewhere down the line
