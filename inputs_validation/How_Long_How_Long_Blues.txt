Leroy Carr  
  
A traditional song which was a likely inspiration for The Train Song  
  
How long how long has that evenin train been gone  
How long how long baby how long  
  
Heard the whistle blowin couldnt see the train  
Way down in my heart I had an achin pain  
How long How long how long  
  
If I could holler like a mountain jack  
Id go up on the mountain and call my baby back  
  
I went up on the mountain looked as far as I could see  
The man had my woman and the blues had poor me  
  
I can see the green grass growin on the hill  
But I aint seen the green grass on a dollar bill  
  
Im goin down to Georgia been up in Tennessee  
So look me over baby last youll see of me  
  
The brook runs into the river river runs into the sea  
If I dont run into my baby a train is goin to run into me
