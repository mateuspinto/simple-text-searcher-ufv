Footsteps movements finding people  
Clutch to the forbidden soul  
Twisting words to find a reason  
How am I supposed to throw  
Questions that I cannot answer  
Watch those boys they dance and go  
Hung up like the rules that made them  
Ill be gone before you know  
  
Chorus  
If I cry  
Let me be told  
Or give me something  
That I can hold  
  
Rhythms take me  
Do I need it  
Will we kiss will you let go  
Twisting hearts  
Oh how we bleed them  
How am I supposed to throw  
Memories from where I keep them  
Words will only make us slow  
We are brave on the assumption  
Shell be back  
Before you know  
  
Chorus  
  
Footsteps movements finding people  
Clutch to the forbidden soul  
Twisting words to find a reason  
How am I supposed to throw  
Questions that I cannot answer  
Watch those boys they dance and go  
Hung up like the rules that made them  
Ill be gone before you know  
  
Chorus
