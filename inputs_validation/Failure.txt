What have we done  
Never thought that life would come to this  
Eternal sense of self hatred  
Blame not who but ask us why we did  
This is an open book of failure  
Deceive ourselves all that we can so we can be  
Cycle of life disrupted  
  
Halted by a force too close to home  
Guilt runs through our blood  
Close your eyes and let yourself forget  
This guilt runs on and on  
  
Consumed all sense gone  
Torn these wings of spirit  
Godless relations  
  
Scar this heart beyond all hope to heal  
This being wont meet this world  
I know Ill take this to my grave  
  
All but saved  
Die for us my child  
This is an open book of failure  
  
Deceive ourselves all that we can  
So we can be  
  
I walk each step in anger  
Found in fault in our design  
Now I kneel down to pray  
To plead for a better time  
Now I kneel down to pray  
In hopes to awake from this  
  
Die my child
