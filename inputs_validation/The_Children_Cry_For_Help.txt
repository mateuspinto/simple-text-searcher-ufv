No eyes have seen  
No ears have heard  
No mind has perceived  
What God has prepared for those that love Him  
  
Multitudes behold His glory  
And give praises for what He has done  
In the time of need the children cry for help  
Many searching for a void to be filled  
  
While in stride they fall to their face in  
Tears or laughter  
After the release of His abundance  
Has His unfailing love vanished forever  
  
Has His promise failed for all time  
Has God forgotten to be merciful  
Has the anger withheld His compassion  
Jesus my Lord and Savior  
  
Though my mind wonders of what I  
Have not seen heard or conceived  
I will turn my focus to you
