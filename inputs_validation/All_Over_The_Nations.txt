I keep wondering all these days  
How to thrive the way we stray  
A year a lifetime  parted together  
will be all the same  
Many things to make me sad  
Some can even drive me mad  
Just fear forever  
No more endevours  
Leave me where I stand  
  
You are here  
And make me feel so high  
Day by day  
Something one cant deny  
Lets give each other certainty  
All over the nations the tunes come alive  
Winners and losers were all alike  
No matter as truth aint some great mystery  
We all fade into one  
  
Dont you feel too hypnotized  
Or keep your future jeopardized  
So whats accomplished crying for nothing  
Skip depression now  
  
Come arise and take me higher  
No more lies and every soul can see  
Were incarnate sincerety  
All over the nations the tunes come alive  
Winners and losers were all alike  
No matter as truth aint some great mystery  
We all fade into one  
  
All over the nations the tunes come alive  
Winners and losers were all alike  
No matter as truth aint some great mystery  
We all fade into one
