I come from nowhere  
And you should go there  
Just try it for a while  
The people from nowhere  
Always smile  
Their eyes are all frozen over  
The sides of their faces pooch out at the corners  
Because thats what happens when their mouths turn up  
On both sides  
Which is why we can tell theyre smiling  
They never frown  
They never let their eyebrows turn down  
They like going around with their teeth showing  
All the time  
They are from nowhere  
Your teeth are showing  
So maybe you been there  
You could have the disease of nowhere people  
Where the air gets stuck all over their gums  
When their nowhere lips roll back  
For real excitement  
They stand still  
They shut up  
Then they dont do nothing  
Out there in nowhere
