Its not the pale moon that excites me  
That thrills and delights me oh no  
Its just the nearness of you  
  
It isnt your sweet conversation  
That brings this sensation oh no  
Its just the nearness of you  
  
When youre in my arms and I feel you so close to me  
All my wildest dreams come true  
  
I need no soft lights to enchant me  
If youll only grant me the right  
To hold you ever so tight  
And to feel in the night the nearness of you
