This sunny Sunday  
Is a good day to go  
Guess you want me to stay  
Well let me know  
And I hate to say  
Its been a waste of time  
I hate to interrupt the flow  
  
Chorus  
Why Why Why  
Hushabye  
Hushabye why arent you ready to go  
Why Why Why  
Hushabye  
Couldnt we fast forward all through this show  
  
You say youd love to  
But youve lost whats left to do  
Almost decided to stay because of you  
And Im here today to exchange your dreams  
For one more ticking of your time  
  
Chorus  
  
Why why  
What you hanging up for  
What you doing that for  
What you breakin up for  
Why hushabye  
  
I hate to interrupt the flow  
For one more ticking of your time  
  
Soothing Sunday is a good day to go  
  
Chorus  
  
Hushabye  
Why why why I  
What you breaking up for  
Why why  
Hushabye
