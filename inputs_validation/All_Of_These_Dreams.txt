There is a place on the mountain near by  
Deep in a cave but its up rather high  
There in the darkness I safely concealed  
All of the dreams that you never revealed  
  
And if you go there and after you do  
All of these dreams would be yours to pursue  
The rest of your lifetime devoid of a care  
If you keep your eyes open you may find yourself there  
  
Such is the promise such is the curse  
You could just live your life better or worse  
Knowing the casual dreams up on that hill  
Beckons and sways but wont bend to your will  
  
You might find a river under a mountain that  
Feeds a remote subterranean fountain  
Drink from this taste just a hint of a dream  
That some how leads in to the underground stream  
  
And if you go there and after you do  
All of these dreams would be yours to pursue  
The rest of your lifetime devoid of a care  
If you keep your eyes open you may find yourself there  
  
If you keep your heart open
