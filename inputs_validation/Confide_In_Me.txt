I stand in the distance  
I view from afar  
Should I offer some assistance  
Should it matter who you are  
  
Chorus  
We all get hurt by love  
And we all have our cross to bear  
But in the name of understanding now  
A problem should be shared  
  
Confide in me  
Confide in me  
  
I can keep a secret  
And throw away the key  
But sometimes to release it  
Is to set our children free  
  
Chorus  
  
Confide in me  
Confide in me  
Confide in me  
Confide in me  
  
Stick or twist  
The choice is yours  
Hit or miss  
Whats mine is yours  
  
Stick or twist  
The choice is yours  
Hit or miss  
Whats mine is yours  
  
Chorus  
  
Confide in me  
Confide in me  
Confide in me  
Confide in me  
Confide in me  
Confide in me
