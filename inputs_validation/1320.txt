Grinding my teeth white knuckles grasp at the wheel  
I rush from an avalanche of adrenaline its all that I feel  
As quick as a bolt of lightning a rocket ride in a bucket seat  
It doesnt get any better than this it just feeds my need for speed  
  
Supercharged strapped in and screaming  
Fire spiting from the pipes  
A burnout by the flame throwing fury  
8 000 horses ignite  
Full throttle hit the ground running  
With a tank full of nitro  
And its 1 320 to go to the finish line  
  
My hands hold tight a fire breathing stampede  
I fall into a trance hold my breath till the light turns green  
In a cloud of nitro methane melting rubber I say my prayers  
Man and machine accelerate and I vanish in thin air  
  
Supercharged strapped in and screaming  
Fire spiting from the pipes  
A burnout by the flame throwing fury  
8 000 horses ignite  
Full throttle hit the ground running  
With a tank full of nitro  
And its 1 320 to go to the finish line
