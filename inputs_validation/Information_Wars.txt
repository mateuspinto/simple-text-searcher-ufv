Give us twenty minutes and well give you the world  
We bring good things to life  
The news you need from people you can count on  
Doing what we do best  
  
The heartbeat of America  
Your true voice  
Youre in good hands  
Now more than ever before  
  
And in the flickering light and the comforting glow  
You get the world every night as a TV show  
The latest spin on the shit were in blow by blow  
And the more you watch the less you know  
  
Beyond the hundred million darkened living rooms  
Out where the human ocean roars  
Into the failing light the generations go  
Heading for the information wars  
  
Do people really spend millions upon millions  
To make us think we care about the planet  
At the same time polluting and looting the only world weve got  
So they can maximize their profit  
People do  
  
The heartbeat of America  
Your true voice  
For the life of your business  
Its everywhere you want to be  
  
And theres a front row seat for the precious few  
The latest war as a payperview  
Famine and disaster right in front of you  
And the more you watch the less you do  
  
Beyond the hundred million darkened living rooms  
Out where the human ocean roars  
Into the failing light the generations go  
Heading for the information wars
