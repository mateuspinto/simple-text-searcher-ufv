My sisters and I  
Have this wish before we die  
And it may sound strange  
As if our minds are deranged  
Please dont ask us why  
Beneath the sheltering sky  
We have this strange obsession  
You have the means in your possession  
  
We want our tea in the Sahara with you  
We want our tea in the Sahara with you  
  
The young man agreed  
He would satisfy their need  
So they danced for his pleasure  
With a joy you could not measure  
They would wait for him here  
The same place every year  
Beneath the sheltering sky  
Across the desert he would fly  
  
Tea in the Sahara with you  
Tea in the Sahara with you  
  
The sky turned to black  
Would he ever come back  
They would climb a high dune  
They would pray to the moon  
But hed never return  
So the sisters would burn  
As their eyes searched the land  
With their cups full of sand  
  
Tea in the Sahara with you  
Tea in the Sahara with you  
Tea in the Sahara with you  
Tea in the Sahara with you
