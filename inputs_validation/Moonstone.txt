Well first I have to tell you that Im not insane  
And that once I was a famous archaeologist named  
In a recent expedition in a distant land  
I just happened to be passing my hand in the sand  
  
And then I stopped looked and then I was hooked  
I saw a flash then a sparkle from a moonstone  
Then the mist started started to clear  
I saw a face a face in the moonstone  
And then it started to disappear  
  
Well I walked and walked and never talked  
For many days  
And without a friend a desert is a lonely place  
I was just about to turn around and make way home  
When something told me that I had to see it again  
  
And then I stopped looked and then I was hooked  
I saw a flash then a sparkle from a moonstone  
Then the mist started started to clear  
I saw a face a face in the moonstone  
And then it started to disappear  
  
A vu ray a vu ray  
A vu ray  
  
I saw a flash then a sparkle from a moonstone  
Then the mist started started to clear  
I saw a face a face in the moonstone  
And then it started to disappear  
And then it started to disappear  
And then it started to disappear
