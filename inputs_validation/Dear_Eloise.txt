Dear Eloise I am writing to say  
A number of funny things I heard today  
I heard that hes left you and run off to see  
Could be the best thing thats happened to me  
  
Writing a letter to make you feel better  
Sorry to hear that he left you that way  
I could have told ya  
He was much older  
So much older than you  
  
You loved him blindly  
He treated ya kindly  
Until he found out what he could get from you  
You should have departed before he got started  
Now youve been burned just like I said you would  
  
Please read my letter closely  
Its beneficial to you  
Must read in between the lines  
A message you will see  
If you use your mind youll find  
I want you bad with meeeeeeee  
  
Ba ba ba ba ba  
Ba ba ba ba ba  
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba  
Ba ba ba ba ba  
Ba ba ba ba ba  
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
