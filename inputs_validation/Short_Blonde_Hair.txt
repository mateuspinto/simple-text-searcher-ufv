Hey I think this is getting to me  
First class living in a goldfish bowl  
  
Just when I think  
I have driven my life  
Where I wanted it to be  
  
It takes me to a place  
That I do not want to go  
  
All I ever wanted to do  
Was to learn how to break  
This world in two  
  
To teach it all the tricks  
I wanted it to learn  
To teach it how to do  
What I want it to do  
  
No one really understands  
How simple and plain  
And predictable I am  
  
Because all I ever wanted to do  
Was to play guitar  
In a rock and roll band  
Now Im just losing my hair and Im  
Learning how to smile  
Like I just dont care  
  
No I just dont care  
I hear them under their breath  
No I just dont care  
What they say when they think that I cant hear them  
I see them point and I see them stare  
There goes that stupid guy  
With the short blond hair  
  
Yeah I think this is getting to me  
First class living in a goldfish bowl  
  
Just when I think  
I have driven my life  
Where I wanted it to be  
  
It takes me to a place  
That I do not want to go  
  
All I ever wanted to do  
Was to learn how to break  
This world in two  
  
Teach it all the tricks  
I wanted it to learn  
Teach it how to do  
What I want it to do  
  
No one really understands  
Just how simple and plain  
And predictable I am  
  
Because all I ever wanted real bad  
Was to play guitar  
In a rock and roll band  
Now Im just losing my hair  
And learning how to smile  
Whoa
