They lie waiting there for you  
So step inside and find the other you

But the low road today

Might just be the only way

While the mothers feeling blue

To the one that got away  
Theres no regrets and no dues left to pay  
Cause in these pages we consume

Drifting down the river of the make believe

Hoping for an ending of our own design  
Where all is fine

Lives in many colors lovers in full bloom  
And through the ages words are born  
Speaking to the senses lifting the forlorn  
In these pages we consume  
Lives in many colors lovers in full bloom  
And through the ages words are born fade
