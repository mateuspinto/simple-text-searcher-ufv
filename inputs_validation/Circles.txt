Circles  
My head is going round in circles  
My mind is caught up in a whirlpool  
Draggin me down  
  
Time  
Will tell if Ill take the homeward track  
Dizziness will make my feet walk back  
Walk right back to you  
  
Everything I do  
I think of you  
No matter how I try  
I cant get back  
  
Circles  
Leading me back to you  
  
Round and around and around  
And around and around  
And around and around  
And around and around  
  
Round and round and round  
Like a fool I go  
Down and down in the pool I go  
Draggin me down  
  
Everything I do  
I think of you  
No matter how I try  
I cant get back  
  
Circles  
Leading me back to you  
  
Just one thing could kill the pain  
Of leaving you  
But it gets me so dizzy that Im walkin right back again  
Back to you  
  
Time  
Will tell if these dreams are  fact  
Though I left Im comin back  
Comin on home to you
