Red One Konvict  
One day at a time  
  
Saw you in the club  
You were dancing with somebody  
So close so tight  
You were killing me so slowly  
My friends were telling me what youre doing  
Can drive a man so crazy  
Trying to live my life  
Its been 6 months since you left me  
  
So I oh I oh I  
Still thinking about you baby  
I try I try  
But I guess I gotta take it  
  
One day at a time  
I gotta let you go  
One day at a time  
It seems so impossible  
One day at a time  
I gotta let you go  
And I know yes I know  
I gotta take it one day at a time  
  
One day one day one day  
One day at a time  
One day one day one day  
One day at a time  
  
I am not the jealous heart  
But you stole my heart baby  
Dancing with that guy  
Made it so hard for me to watch baby  
I just been around running in circle  
Im going through it in my mind baby  
Had to suck up the tears from my night strolls  
To stop from crying out loud baby  
  
Oh I oh I  
Still thinking about you baby  
I try I try  
Cant stop thinking about you baby  
Oh I oh I  
I keep thinking about you baby  
I try I try  
But I guess I gotta take it  
  
One day at a time  
Said I gotta let you go  
One day at a time  
But it seems so impossible  
One day at a time  
Said I gotta let you go  
And I know and I know  
I gotta take it one day at a time  
  
First thing I gotta do is try to face it try to face it  
But your voice keeps playing in my ear playing in my ear  
It just makes me crazy trying to fake it trying to fake it  
The true events so bad its not what I wanna hear  
But I guess I gotta take it  
  
One day at a time  
I gotta let you go  
One day at a time  
It seems so impossible  
One day at a time  
I gotta let you go  
And I know yes I know  
I gotta take it one day at a time  
  
One day at a time  
Said I gotta let you go  
One day at a time  
But it seems so impossible  
One day at a time  
Said I gotta let you go  
And I know yes I know  
I gotta take it one day at a time  
  
One day at a time  
Said I gotta let you go  
One day at a time  
But it seems so impossible  
One day at a time  
Said I gotta let you go  
And I know yes I know  
I gotta take it one day at a time
