With lucy simon  
Writer lewis caroll  
  
Will you walk a little faster said a whiting to a snail Theres a
porpoise close behind us and hes treading on my tail See how eagerly the
lobsters and the turtles all advance They are waiting on the shingle  will
you come and join the dance Will you wont you will you wont you will
you join the dance Will you wont you will you wont you wont you join
the dance You can really have no notion how delightful it will be When they
take us up and throw us with the lobsters out to sea  But the snail
replied Too far too far  and gave a look askance  Said he thanked the
whiting kindly but he would not join the dance Would not could not would
not could not would not join the dance Would not could not would not
could not could not join the dance What matters it how far we go  his
scaly friend replied There is another shore you know upon the other side
The further off from England the nearer is to France  Then turn not pale
beloved snail but come and join the dance Will you wont you will you
wont you will you join the dance Will you wont you will you wont you
wont you join the dance
