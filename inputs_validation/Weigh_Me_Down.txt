Were looking in the same direction  
But you dont see what I see  
Just a half moon in your perception  
It looks full to me  
Oh my head is caught caught in clouds  
But your buried so so far down  
  
You drag me down to earth  
You stomp my heart it hurts  
You weigh me down  
The way your pulling me  
Youre worse than gravity  
You weigh me down  
You weigh me down  
  
Your words can pollute the future  
So you should choose carefully  
Cynical is a natural born killer  
If it were up to me I would say  
Lets get you all medicated  
So we can get dedicated  
  
You drag me down to earth  
You stomp my heart it hurts  
You weigh me down  
The way youre pulling me  
Youre worse than gravity  
You weigh me down  
You weigh me down  
  
This is not a race  
This is the relationship  
But you take the cake at being the worst in it  
Try and keep me grounded  
You took my faith and nearly drowned it  
  
This is not a test  
This is the relationship  
You are the best in being Mr Negative  
  
You weigh me down  
  
You drag me down to earth  
You stomp my heart it hurts  
You weigh me down  
The way youre pulling me  
Youre worse than gravity  
You weigh me down  
You weigh me down  
  
You drag me down to earth  
You stomp my heart it hurts  
You weigh me down  
The way youre pulling me  
Youre worse than gravity  
You weigh me down  
You weigh me down  
  
You weigh me down me down
