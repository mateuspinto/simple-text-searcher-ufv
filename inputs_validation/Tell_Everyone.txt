May the smile on your face  
Come straight from your heart  
Takes a lady like you  
To write that for me  
To wake up with you  
Makes my morning so bright  
Wipes the sleep from my eyes  
When you tell me your dreams  
And it goes on and on  
Way beyond and out of reach  
Its a well known old secret  
Go and tell everyone  
Tell everyone  
The smile on your face  
Comes straight from your heart  
If you look you will find  
And you wrote that for me
