Tiny people with little guns  
Little armies march to little drums  
What do they want  
What do they want  
Tiny soldiers with little guns  
Little tanks no bigger than your thumb  
They want you  
Little people with tiny brains  
Little bullets flowing in their veins  
What do they want  
What do they want  
Tiny people with little guns  
Little armies march to little drums  
They want you you  
You you you you  
Little airplanes with tiny bombs  
Little squadrons dropping thimbles of Napalm  
They want you  
What do they want  
What do they want  
Tiny people with little guns  
Little armies march to little drums  
You you  
You you you you  
Tiny people little guns  
Tiny people little guns  
Tiny people little guns
