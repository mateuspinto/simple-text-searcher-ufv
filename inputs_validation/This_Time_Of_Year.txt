Little girls little boys  
Dream of words lots of toys  
This time of the year  
When Christmas is near  
Evergreens are snowy white  
Sleigh bells ring through the night  
This time of the year  
When Christmas is near  
Somewhere near a steeple  
People kneel and pray  
And choirs sing carols of Christmas day  
Santa Claus oh is on his way  
Loads of joy in on his sleigh  
This time of the year  
Yeah when Christmas is near  
Somewhere near a steeple  
People they kneel and pray  
Oh when choirs sing  
Oh they sing carols of Christmas day  
Oh and Santa Claus oh is on his way  
Loads of joy on his sleigh yeah  
This time of the year  
Oh when Christmas is near  
Oh oh yeah yeah yeah this time of the year  
And oh when Christmas is near  
Oh oh Christmas is near
