If the wife and I are fussin brother thats our right  
Cause me and that sweet womans got a license to fight  
Why dont you mind your own business  
Mind your own business  
Cause if you mind your business then you wont be mindin mine  
  
Oh the woman on our party lines the nosiest thing  
She picks up her receiver when she knows its my ring  
Why dont you mind your own business  
Mind your own business  
Well if you mind your business then you wont be mindin mine  
  
I got a little gal that wears her hair up high  
The boys all whistle when she walks by  
Why dont you mind your own buisness  
Mind your own business  
Well if you mind your own business you sure wont be minding mine  
  
If I want to honky tonk around til two or three  
Now brother thats my headache dont you worry bout me  
Just mind your own business  
Mind your own business  
If you mind your business then you wont be mindin mine  
  
Mindin other peoples business seems to be hightoned  
I got all that I can do just to mind my own  
Why dont you mind your own business  
Mind your own business  
If you mind your own business youll stay busy all the time
