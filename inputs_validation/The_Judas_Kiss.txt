When the world has turned its back  
When the days have turned pitch black  
When the fear abducts your tongue  
When the fires dead and gone  
  
So what now  
Where do I head  
  
When you think its all said and done  
When you are the ostracized  
Selfish written dead goodbyes  
Twisting of the tourniquet  
When the pieces never fit  
  
So what now  
Where do I head  
  
When you think its all said and done  
  
Bow down  
Sell your soul to me  
I will set you free  
Pacify your demons  
  
Bow down  
Surrender unto me  
Submit infectiously  
Sanctify your demons  
  
Into abyss  
You dont exist  
Cannot resist  
The Judas kiss  
  
When the storm has blacked your sky  
Intuition crucify  
When the ego strips your reign  
Assassinate the living flame  
  
So what now  
Where do I head  
  
When you think its all said and done  
Venom of a life insane  
Bites into your fragile veins  
Internalize and decimate  
Pitting it as complicate  
  
So what now  
Where do I head  
  
When you think its all said and done  
  
Bow down  
Sell your soul to me  
I will set you free  
Pacify your demons  
  
Bow down  
Surrender unto me  
Submit infectiously  
Sanctify your demons  
  
Into abyss  
You dont exist  
Cannot resist  
The Judas kiss  
  
Judas lives recite this vow  
Ive become your new god now  
  
Follow you from dawn of time  
Whisper thoughts into your mind  
Watched your towers hit the ground  
Lured the children never found  
Helped your kings abuse their crown  
  
In the heart of evil man  
Plant the seeds of my own plan  
Strong and powerful will fall  
Find a piece of me in all  
Inside you all  
  
So bow down  
Sell your soul to me  
I will set you free  
Pacify your demons  
  
Bow down  
Surrender unto me  
Submit infectiously  
Sanctify your demons  
  
Into abyss  
You dont exist  
Cannot resist  
The Judas kiss
