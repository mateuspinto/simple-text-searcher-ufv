If I gave my heart to you  
Would you promise to be true  
It would break my heart in two  
If you left me waiting anticipating  
  
Till some other magic day  
I may steal your heart away  
Then you would take my hand  
And then understand me  
When youd really see me  
  
In a world of different dreams  
Where all things arent what they seem  
When you would take my hand  
  
If I gave my heart  
If I gave my heart  
If I gave my heart to you  
  
For only truth remains  
Cause all things are just the same  
The excepting part of truth  
  
If I gave my heart  
If I gave my heart  
If I gave my heart to you
