How can I go on when every thought hurts  
I flirt with the notion of no more songs  
My old familiar foe self pity haunts me  
Im stuck in some overthemountain town  
In a meaningless bar where fat hands  
Round the steiners  
And no one cares if it suns or pours  
In an hour between trains  
Barney puts the record on  
And the aimless rise to dance  
Embrace me my sweet embraceable you  
I see you George in your  
Apartment on Riverside Drive  
Some fifty years ago  
Your fingers on the keys  
Looking for the song  
Looking for that hook  
Embrace me you irreplaceable you  
Who were you then  
Did you have a woman  
Were you hard up for cash  
Did you ever know youd be heard in  
The middle distance  
In some overthemountain town  
Connecting to the muscles of the dancers  
In this close and smoky room  
  
Who were you then  
Were you sure of your tune  
Or were your dreams and your courage all broken down like mine  
Now theres something that clutches the heart  
A melody that stays  
  
Year after year  
I love all the many charms about you  
Above all I want my arms around you  
Im already late for my train  
But I dont think about that  
I think of you George  
At your piano sweating in the summer heat  
  
By the way did you get your girl  
Did you by your house in the country  
Did you wait for something that never came  
Did you die still waiting for your train  
Dont be a naughty baby come to mama  
Come to mama do  
  
Some part of your heart twists and turns in mine  
Your soul rises  
Theres an angel in charge  
Theres one note that weeps the truth  
And makes my life mean something  
Just for the length of  
  
Embrace me my sweet embraceable you  
Embrace me you irreplaceable you  
Dont be a naughty baby come to mama  
Come to mama do  
  
I will go home I will try again  
I will catch the train  
Catch another breath  
Move back to the piano and  
Let the notes do what theyll do  
In honor of you George  
In honor of you
