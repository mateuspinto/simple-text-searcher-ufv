Ive got a crush on you my sweetie pie  
All the day and nighttime hear me sigh  
I never had the least notion that  
I could fall with so much emotion  
  
Could you coo could you care  
For a cunning cottage that we could share  
The world will pardon my mush  
cause I have got a crush my baby on you  
  
Ohh Could you coo baby could you care  
For a cunning cottage  
We could share  
Now the world will pardon my mush  
cause I have got a crush ohh you know Ive got it bad for you
