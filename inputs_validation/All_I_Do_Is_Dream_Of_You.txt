All I do is dream of you the whole night through  
With the dawn I still go on dreamin of you  
  
Youre every thought youre every thing  
Youre every song I ever sing  
Summer winter autumn and spring  
  
And were there more than twenty four hours a day  
Theyd be spent in sweet content dreamin away  
  
When skies are gray skies are blue  
Morning noon and night time too  
All I do the whole day through is dream of you  
  
When skies are gray skies are blue  
Morning noon and night time too  
All I do the whole day through is dream of you
