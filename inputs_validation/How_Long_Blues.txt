How long baby how long has that evening train been gone  
Its been gone since that blood red sun went down  
  
Thought I heard a whistle and I think I see a train  
Deep in my heart there is an aching pain  
Said how long how long baby how long  
  
Well look down them tracks and feeling so bad  
Lost the best woman that a poor man ever had  
How long well how long baby how long  
  
Well how long baby how long has that evening train been gone  
Its been gone since that blood red sun went down  
  
How long baby how long has that evening train been gone  
Its been gone since that blood red sun went down
