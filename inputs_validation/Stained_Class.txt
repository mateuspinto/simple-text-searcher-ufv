Wildeyed and tight fisted Im fused to the bone  
I stand contemplating reacting alone  
Impaled with betrayal  
The tourniquet turns  
Societys creation  
Poleaxed out and burnt  
  
Long ago when man was king his heart was clean now hes stained class  
Time has slashed each untouched thing so now hes just a stained class king  
  
Transfixed at deliverance is this all there is  
Faithless continuum into the abyss  
Fierce is my conviction absolute my belief  
I spit at you apathy and seducer deceit  
  
Long ago when man was king his heart was clean now hes stained class  
Time has slashed each untouched thing so now hes just a stained class king  
  
Lethal deadly hung drawn and quartered  
He slaughtered and faltered and altered the world  
But by doing so smashed all his hopes and Utopian dreams  
Whipping stripping peeling the flesh off relentless and senseless  
His lust snapped like vipers whose fangs sank in deep  
To infest and decay from the core  
  
Impaled with betrayal the tourniquet turns  
Societys creation poleaxed out and burnt  
  
Long ago when man was king his heart was clean now hes stained class  
Time has slashed each untouched thing so now hes just a stained class king  
  
Stained class king
