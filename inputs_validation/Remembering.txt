Remember those golden days  
We used to walk hand in hand  
I was your friend your fool your lover  
I was your man  
  
I can see you then  
Smiling looking straight at me  
You caught me unawares I blushed  
Lets sit beneath this tree  
  
I cant get over the change in you  
I cant get over the change in me  
  
And I keep on remembering the old days  
I keep on remembering the old ways  
  
I can recall you running to a sweet shop  
You stopped  
Bought me something  
And you handed it to me  
  
You were my girlfriend then  
The first that I ever had  
The first that I ever kissed  
And the first to make me sad  
  
I cant get over the change in you  
I cant get over the change in me  
  
I keep on remembering the old days  
I keep on remembering the old ways  
  
Oh yeah  
I keep on remembering  
I keep on remembering  
  
Oh yeah  
I keep on remembering the old days  
I keep on remembering  
  
Your pretty dress  
With the zip up the back  
I used to love you like that  
I used to love you like that  
  
Oh yeah  
I keep on remembering  
I keep on remembering all about you
