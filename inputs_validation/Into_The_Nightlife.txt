Got this endless itch to ride  
Into the night  
Fortune cookie says Im right  
Kung Fu like  
  
Shake your body Mister  
Gonna make ya body blister say hey hey hey  
Dont wanna have to make ya  
I dont wanna have to shake ya down hey hey hey  
  
Chorus  
Ill take ya till ya all spun up  
Pitter patter doesnt matter what you got  
Ill take ya till ya all spun up  
And in love  
And into the night life  
Ill take ya till ya all spun up  
Turn you over baby till its never enough  
Ill take ya till ya all spun up  
And in love  
And into the night life  
Like love  
In the night life  
  
Want to dress for you tonight  
Under the light  
Shot up like a satellite  
Into the night  
Shake ya money maker  
I will never be a faker now hey hey hey  
Leave em standing waitin  
Till theyre practically faintin now hey hey hey  
  
Chorus  
  
Shirtless wonders wreck my sight Repeat x2  
Under the light  
  
Chorus  
  
Into the night life repeated  
  
Shirtless wonders wreck my sight  
Under the light
