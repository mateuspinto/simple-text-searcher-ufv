Whenever I feel afraid  
I hold my head erect  
And whistle a happy tune  
So no one will suspect  
Im afraid  
  
While shivering in my shoes  
I strike a careless pose  
And whistle a happy tune  
And no one ever knows  
Im afraid  
  
The result of this deception  
Is very strange to tell  
For when I fool the people  
I fear I fool myself as well  
  
I whistle a happy tune  
And evry single time  
The happiness in the tune  
Convinces me that Im not afraid  
  
Make believe youre brave  
And the trick will take you far  
You may be as brave  
As you make believe you are  
  
You may be as brave  
As you make believe you are

While shivering in my shoes  
I strike a careless pose  
And whistle a happy tune  
And no one ever knows  
Im afraid  
  
Louis and anna  
  
The result of this deception  
Is very strange to tell  
For when I fool the people  
I fear I fool myself as well  
  
I whistle a happy tune  
And evry single time  
The happiness in the tune  
Convinces me that Im not afraid  
  
Make believe youre brave  
And the trick will take you far  
You may be as brave  
As you make believe you are
