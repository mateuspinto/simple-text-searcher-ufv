Verse  
She dances in the sheets at night  
She dances to his needs  
She dances til he feels just right  
Until he falls asleep  
  
She dances at the break of dawn  
And quickly cooks his food  
She cant be late cant take too long  
The kids must get to school  
  
Chorus

She dances for the men at work  
Who works her all the time  
She cant be rude as she says so  
I must be home tonight  
  
She dances to the kitchen stove  
Dinner is served by nine  
She sets his food an hour late  
She must be out of her mind

She works so hard just to make her way  
For a man who just wont appreciate  
  
And dont know it takes  
And was all in vain  
Still she could not stop  
Couldnt break his chains  
  
She danced the night  
That they fell out  
She swore shed dance no more  
But then she did she did not quit  
And she ran out the door  
  
She danced through the night  
In fear of her life  
She danced to a beat of her own  
  
She let out a cry and  
Swallowed her pride  
She knew she was needed  
Back home home
