Start in the way that you want to go on  
Tear down the fence that you sit upon  
It was good while it lasted but now it has gone  
So face up to what you have done  
For time immemorial time immemorial time  
  
A glorious contest to find the invincible one  
And I will know everything there is  
Goodbye to you and your money  
And I will go anywhere you say if you take away all the cameras  
The house that we live in is falling apart  
Theres no guarantee cause we got it for free  
And all the pretenders to somebodys throne  
Are finding it out on their own  
For time immemorial time immemorial time  
  
Will go on a mission to find the invincible one  
And I will know everything there is  
Goodbye to you and your public  
And I will go everywhere you say if you dont charge admission  
Okay were lucky but then again  
Time immemorial time immemorial time  
Will go on a mission to find the invincible one  
And I will know everything there is  
Goodbye to you and your money  
And I will go anywhere you say  
Sell me the show the secrets of your house  
  
And I will know everything you say  
Take away all the cameras the cameras  
And I will go anywhere you say  
If you dont charge admission admission
