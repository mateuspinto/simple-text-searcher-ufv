A cloud of eiderdown  
Draws around me  
Softening a sound  
Sleepy time and I lie  
With my love by my side  
And shes breathing low  
  
And the candle dies  
  
When night comes down  
You lock the door  
The book falls to the floor  
As darkness falls  
The waves roll by  
The seasons change  
The wind is wry  
  
Now wakes the hour  
Now sleeps the swan  
Behold the dream  
The dream is gone  
Green fields are calling  
Its falling in a golden door  
  
And deep beneath the ground  
The early morning sounds  
And I go down  
Sleepy time and I lie  
With my love by my side  
And shes breathing low  
  
And I rise like a bird  
In the haze when the first rays  
Touch the sky  
  
And the night wings die
