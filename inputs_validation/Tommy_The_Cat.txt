Well I remember as it were a meal ago  
  
Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter  
May have nestled its way into his mighty throat  
Many a fat alley rat had met its demise while staring point blank down  
The cavernous barrel of this awesome prowling machine  
Truly a wonder of nature this urban predator  
Tommy the Cat had many a story to tell  
But it was a rare occasion such as this that he did  
  
She came slidin down the alleyway like butter drippin off a hot biscuit  
The aroma the mean scent was enough to arouse suspicion in even the  
Oldest of tigers that hung around the hot spot in those days  
The sight was beyond belief  
Many a head snapped for doubleeven tripletakes as this vivacious  
Feline made her her way into the delta of the alleyway where the most  
Virile of the young tabbies were known to hang out  
  
They hung in droves  
Such a multitude of masculinity could only be found in one place  
And that was OMalleys Alley  
  
The air was thick with cat calls no pun intended  
But not even a muscle in her neck did twitch as she sauntered up into  
The heart of the alleyway  
She knew what she wanted  
She was lookin for that stud bull  
She was looking for that he cat  
And that was me  
  
Tommy the Cat is my name and I say unto thee  
  
Say baby do you want to lay down with me  
Say baby do you want to lay down by my side  
Ah baby do you want to lay down with me  
Say baby  
Say baby
