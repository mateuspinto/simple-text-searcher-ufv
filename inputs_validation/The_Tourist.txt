It barks at no one else but me  
Like its seen a ghost  
I guess its seen the sparks aflowin  
No one else would know  
  
Hey man slow down slow down  
Idiot slow down slow down  
  
Sometimes I get overcharged  
Thats when you see sparks  
They ask me where the hell Im going  
At a 1000 feet per second  
  
Hey man slow down slow down  
Idiot slow down slow down  
  
Hey man slow down slow down  
Idiot slow down slow down
