The breeze was cool  
His kiss was fire  
The night birds sang their trills  
And when the moon was gone  
Hidden by the clouds  
I put the fire out somewhere in the hills  
  
His eyes could laugh  
I saw them laugh  
His lips a world of thrills  
The moon looked down and smiled  
On a tender love to see it  
Blossoming somewhere in the hills  
  
All night long we would samba  
  
Laugh and sing with our friends  
Love can be like a samba  
Full of joy then it ends  
  
New day new dawn  
And I have gone  
In search of other thrills  
The moon looks down and sighs  
For those laughing eyes are crying  
Silently somewhere in the hills  
  
All night long we would samba  
Laugh and sing with our friends  
Love can be like a samba  
Full of joy then it ends
