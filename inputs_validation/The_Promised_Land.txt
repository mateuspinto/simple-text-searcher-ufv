I left my home in Norfolk Virginia California on my mind  
I straddled that greyhound and rode him into Raleigh and on across Caroline  
I had motor trouble that turned into a struggle halfway across Alabama  
And that Hound broke down and left me all stranded in Downtown Birmingham  
  
Right away I bought me a through train ticket ridin across Mississippi clean  
And I was on the Midnight Flyer out of Birmingham smokin into New Orleans  
  
Somebody helped me get out of Louisiana just to help me get to Houston Town  
There are people there who care a little bout me  
And they wont let a poor boy down  
  
Sure as youre born they bought me a silk suit they put luggage in my hand  
And I woke up high over Albuquerque on a jet to the Promised Land  
  
Workin on a Tbone steak I had a party flyin over to the Golden State  
When the pilot told me in thirteen minutes  
He would get us at the Terminal zone  
  
Swing low chariot come down easy taxi to the Terminal zone  
Cut your engines and cool your wings and let me make it to the telephone  
Los Angeles give me Norfolk Virginia Tidewater 41009  
And tell the folks back home this is the Promised Land callin  
And the poor boys on the line

And tell the folks back home this is the Promised Land callin  
And the poor boys on the line  
  
And tell the folks back home this is the Promised Land callin  
And their big boys on the line
