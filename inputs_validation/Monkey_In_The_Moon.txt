Once I was so sure once I was so blind  
Wonder what you said if you read my mind  
Angel in a car devil on a cross  
Scarecrows in the fields Jesus on the rocks  
Letters in the rain rabbit on the run  
God was made for you lizards for the sun  
Monkey in the moon I can see you through  
Monkey in the moon this ones made for you  
  
  
Flower in a word words without a priest  
Wings without a bird beauty without beast  
Signal overkill trains are overdue  
Fool upon a hill ocean overview  
Letters in the rain    
Fool upon a hill trains are overdue  
Except what we forgot nothings really new  
Head above the clouds eyes are opened wide  
Windmill burning down walk into the light  
Walk into the light  
Monkey in the moon  
Letters in the rain  
This ones
