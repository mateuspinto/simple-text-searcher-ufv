When building a molotov cocktail  
Dont think of it as Just a bomb  
Be creative express yourself  
Put a little bit of yourself in each one  
But remember kids safety first Ok Lets get started  
Take an empty milk bottle  
Full it full with gasoline  
Stuff a gassed soap rag into the mouth of the bottle  
You cork the top and presto  
Youre gonna have a funfilled night tonight believe me  
Youre gonna be the life of the party  
With this little goodie  
Be safe kids and have a blast
