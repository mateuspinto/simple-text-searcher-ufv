When we want to love we love  
When we want to kiss we kiss  
With a little petting were getting  
Some fun out of life  
When we want to work we work  
When we want to play we play  
In a happy setting were getting  
Some fun out of life  
Maybe we do the right things  
Maybe we do the wrong  
Spending each day  
Just wending our way along  
When we want to sing we sing  
When we want to dance we dance  
You can do your betting were getting  
Some fun out of life  
  
Maybe we do the right things  
Maybe we do the wrong  
Spending each day  
Just wending our way along  
But when we want to sing we sing  
When we want to dance we dance  
You can do your betting were getting  
Some fun out of life
