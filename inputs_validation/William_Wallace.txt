I am William Wallace  
My life was a mystery  
Some say born twelve seven two  
Some say twelve sixty three  
  
Was dubbed Malcolm of Paisley  
Maybe Alan from Aire  
Did I have a wife or no  
Do you really care  
  
They say I had a big red beard  
But all you need to know  
I was a Scottish rebel  
And the English were my foe  
  
William Wallace Scottish rebel  
This is war I cried  
Many English fought me  
And many English died  
  
I took against the English  
Back when I was fairly wee  
Cause an Englishman called Selby  
Bullied my whole family  
It upset me so I struck him dead  
Well wouldnt you  
Then an English sheriff came along  
Guess what I killed him too  
  
They say he killed my wife  
So he deserved what he got  
Then Englands King Ed came for me  
Ooh Im scared Not  
  
William Wallace Scottish rebel  
Possibly six feet seven  
But all that really matters is  
I sent Englishmen to heaven  
  
Forty thousand English came  
To Stirling Bridge for me  
They had to cross a narrow bridge  
To get to us you see  
We held them off pushed them back  
It was no contest  
Bridge collapsed hundreds drowned  
Of course I killed the rest  
  
I celebrated Stirling Bridge  
Another Scottish win  
By decorating my sword  
With the English generals skin  
  
William Wallace Scottish rebel  
Scottish legend too  
Fought for Scottish freedom  
Was a hero through and through  
  
Heres where my rebel story comes unstuck  
At Falkirk defeated Id run out of luck  
Spent seven years playing hide and seek  
Captured sent to London tried for treason  
What a cheek  
  
King Ed hanged me then a lovely touch  
Pulled my guts out guess he didnt like me much  
  
William Wallace Scottish rebel  
In Scotland my heart lived  
Though sadly my head wound up  
On a spike on London Bridge  
  
Ooh that smarts
