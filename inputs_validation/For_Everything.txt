When I found You  
All became new  
Now I live for You  
  
Because You saved me  
And You forgave me  
I have been set free  
  
Everything inside me gives You praise  
  
For everything Youve done in me  
I will sing to You  
And I will worship You  
FOR EVERYTHING  
  
For everything You are to me  
I will shout Your praise  
And live for You always  
FOR EVERYTHING  
  
No matter what I go through  
Ill lift my praise up to You  
In everything I will sing  
My praise unto the King
