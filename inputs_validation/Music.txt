Things may always stay the way they are  
Still my head looks for a change  
From time to time  
I dont really mean to look that far  
Turn on the music strike up the music  
Let the music change my mind  
  
Now dont I dig the big time rock and roll  
Sit in the darkness and be somebody else  
A time which after all is under control  
Crank out the music  
Give me music let the music fill the air  
  
My dear friend your heads been sinking  
Like a stone  
You must try thinking like a cloud sometime  
Just leave a happy side out loud sometime  
Theres a symphony inside you  
Theres a thousand things for you to do  
So come on  
  
Let a hush fall on the movie crowd  
Boy turns to girl and says I love you so  
What I hear in here is violins  
Give me music miss the music  
Let the music be there too  
Ill never know what to do  
Unless you let the music be there too  
  
You see this man his heads been sinking  
Like a stone  
You must try thinking like a cloud sometime  
Just leave a happy side out loud sometime  
Theres a symphony inside you  
Theres a thousand things for you to do  
So come on  
  
Let a hush fall on the movie crowd  
Boy turns to girl and says I love you so  
Well you know what I hear in here is violins  
Strike up the music lay on the music  
Let the music be there too  
Never know what to do unless you  
Let the music be there too
