Twenty cities it passed me by  
Finding treasures I dont wanna find  
But I have stolen and Ive cross the line  
And I want you I want you  
Twenty seconds and you could be gone  
You shine brighter than the morning sun  
You think its over but itd just begun  
And I want you I want you  
  
This sky is grey its full of gold  
Can feel your heart and feel your soul  
Ill drink it up and take it slow  
I dont need anything else  
  
Tell me where Im heading  
Tell me I could be this sane  
Somewhere Ive forgotten  
I die a little more for you  
When everything is broken  
Theres piece Ill never lose  
I keep finding reasons to  
Die a little more for you  
  
Twenty questions ringing in my head  
The moments over but its never dead  
What did I say and what does all this meant  
Cause I want you I want you  
Fire light as it hit you right  
Heads are turned as you walk on by  
Maybe we belong in another time  
I still want you I want you  
  
This sky is grey its full of gold  
Can feel your heart and feel your soul  
I drink it up and take it slow  
I dont need anything else  
  
Tell me where Im heading  
Tell me I could be this sane  
Somewhere Ive forgotten  
I die a little more for you  
When everything is broken  
Theres piece Ill never lose  
I keep finding reasons to  
Die a little more for you  
Die a little more for you  
  
How many things can you wish for  
Cause just wishing is all I do  
When it comes to you  
How many lives can you live through  
How many times can you keep movin keep movin  
  
Tell me where Im heading  
Tell me I could be this sane  
Somewhere Ive forgotten  
I die a little more for you  
When everything is broken  
Theres piece Ill never lose  
I keep finding reasons to  
Die a little more for you  
Die a little more for you  
Die a little more for you
