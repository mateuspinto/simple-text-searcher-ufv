Ooh ooh  
If you see me walking down the street  
And I start to cry each time we meet  
Walk on by  
Boy walk on by  
  
Make believe that you dont see the tears  
Just let me grieve in private  
Cause each time I see you  
I break down and cry  
Boy walk on by  
  
I just cant get over losing you  
And so if I seem broken and blue  
Walk on by  
Boy walk on by  
  
Foolish pride all that I can feel  
So let me hide the tears and the sadness  
You gave me when you said goodbye  
Boy walk on by  
  
Ooh ooh make believe that you dont see the tears honey  
Let me grieve in private  
Cause each time I see you  
I just break down and cry  
Oh oh just walk on by  
Walk on walk on  
Ooh ooh  
Oh walk on by
