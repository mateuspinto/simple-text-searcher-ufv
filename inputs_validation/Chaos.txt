Ordo ob kao Order out of chaos and the idea is that uh with the  
influence of powerful forces behind the scene you can bring order out of the  
chaos that we see We know for instance that much of the  
An eerie order underneath even chaos as if the finger of God  
In order and disorder is always there  
I think he has nothing to support this whyyoure so full of it  
Aliens protecting society how Chaos happens  
Theres too many people here  
Gotta learn the way to turn  
Hat over eye  
Feeling dead more than alive  
Give her something to rely on  
One more time  
No one hears the sound  
Fear is all around  
Turn the music loud  
No more lullaby  
No way in no way out  
Empty talk and TV shouts  
Got to find the way around  
No you aint no lifer  
In this town  
No one hears the sound  
Fear is all around  
Turn the music loud  
No more lullaby  
Stop the beat hear the sound  
Time has come for you to speak  
Your mind  
Cant you hear the sound  
Chaos all around  
Turn the music loud  
No more lullaby  
Deedeedee  
Deedeedee  
Learn to fly
