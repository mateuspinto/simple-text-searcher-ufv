Yeah check it out they say behind every strong man  
Is an even stronger woman  
  
Chorus  
Cause she was put here to defeat me  
Cause she cuss me out quick to leave me  
Cause she not what I want not what I want not what I need  
Cause she blow my phone up to reach me  
Cause she tried to lock now she leaves me  
Cause she not what I want not what I want not what I need  
  
Man X aint with that sucka shit  
Im from a place where they quick to say Fuck A Bitch  
And gettin grits off of pussy try ta get a hitch  
But Im a bachelor stackin it drinkin need to quit  
Me and my clique ride through cities like we own the shit  
You caught my eye looking fly body lookin thick  
So who am I I reply with my government exchange the numbers  
Escapades for days satisfying my hunger  
Dont trip you from a long list a long line  
Get in line you so fucking fine you spendin time  
Introduce you as a friend of mine never my woman  
I got twenty twenty cord vision seein you comin  
Livin my life I dont need a wife  
But you persist tryin ta strengthen our relationship  
But Im a dog and a dog gotta run the streets  
Without a leash this aint workin so Im sayin peace  
You aint the one for me  
  
Chorus  
  
You found some way to hold on through all the bullshit  
Never seen a woman so strong I used to pull shit  
Now them days long been gone I gotta move in them streets  
Provide a place for all my peoples to eat  
Im feelin stuck had to hustle up  
The ATF hit the house had me shackled up  
You lost your mind hate the time I was in and out  
You never let a brother down when you stressin out  
You stressin wanted me to figure out a different route  
You couldve left but you a rider and stuck it out  
And its a trip because its like you never missed a beat  
You waited anxiously patiently stayin strong for me  
I sat aside thinking back to the way I was  
The way I am and how I gotta be a stronger man  
I understand that you love me and you want the best  
But if you want to take the good you gotta take the rest  
I rock a vest baby  
  
Cause I run these streets for my struggle  
Cause I carry heat for my troubles  
Cause I is that what you want is that what you want is that what you need  
Cause I want family so Im buildin  
Cause I want futures for my children  
Cause I is that what you want is that what you want is that what you need  
  
And all this time it was you  
Baby forgive me for the pain I was puttin you through  
Its me and you against the world so Im keepin it true  
I know I havent been the best the wrong things I pursue  
I used to think I was the MAN wasnt havin a clue  
I wasnt lookin for no love but I found it in you  
Its so true behind every great man is a women  
Every time you call me Baby Girl Im a come runnin  
You got a soldier livin right girl you saved my life  
I sacrifice anything to keep my family tight  
I seen the light and when the world try to beat me down  
You always given me another reason I can smile  
Cause you believed in me when there was nothin there to see  
My wife can be my better half complete my family tree  
Ugh nothin can stop us now Vera Wang gown  
Watchin your father walk his little lady down the isle  
Cause you the one for me  
  
Cause she was put here to complete me  
Cause she wooze the earth underneath me  
Cause she got what I want got what I want got what I need  
Cause she wont let go she wont leave me  
Cause she wont leave what she dont need me  
Cause she got what I want got what I want got what I need  
  
Dedicated to the real ones out there  
Ugh yeah this is for you
