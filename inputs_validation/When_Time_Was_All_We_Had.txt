That endless season  
  
When time was all we had  
  
We saw forever  
  
And caught it in our hands  
  
Life was a charm  
  
Our hearts were filled with music  
  
And laughter  
  
When time was all we had  
  
  
  
I never will forget your face in silhouette  
  
Your voice will be the sweetest sound  
  
Ill ever hear and yet  
  
We knew somehow the song would never end  
  
When time was all we had to spend
