Turning and turning  
The world goes on  
We cant change it my friend  
Let us go riding all through the days  
Together to the end to the end  
  
Les bicyclettes de Belsize  
Carry us side by side  
And hand in hand we will ride  
Over Belsize  
Turn your magical eyes  
Round and around  
Looking at all we found  
Carry us through the skies  
Les bicyclettes de Belsize  
  
Spinning and spinning  
The dreams I know  
Rolling on through my head  
Let us enjoy them before they go  
Come the dawn they all are dead  
Yes theyre dead  
  
Les bicyclettes de Belsize  
Carry us side by side  
And hand in hand we will ride  
Over Belsize  
Turn your magical eyes  
Round and around  
Looking at all we found  
Carry us through the skies  
Les bicyclettes de Belsize
