Anyway you look at it  
From any point of view  
You must admit Im lucky  
To be in love with you  
And people say Im cynical  
They never want the truth  
But life will have more twists and turns  
Then found in any book  
Mmm mmm mmm  
And I may travel far away  
Across the seas of doom  
To undiscovered countries  
But Ill come back to you  
Anyway you look at it  
Any point of view  
Ooh babe babe  
Anyway  
Anyway you look at it  
When the camera shoots  
Seen from any angle  
Im still in love with you  
Mmm mmm mmm  
Anyway you look at it  
Anyway you will  
Like a beacon shining out  
Ill be there for you  
Mmm mmm mmm
