I could not take it oh so seriously really  
When you called and said youd seen a UFO  
But then it dawned on me the message in writing  
Spelt out a meeting never dreamed of before  
  
I looked out in the night  
Strange and startling  
Was this voice of time just saying  
Theres got to be a linking of everyone  
Got to be a center  
It all comes flooding back  
  
Arriving through eons of times immortal power of the future to behold  
Vessels of a different impression none that we could ever hope to have known  
  
So look out in the night  
Once they arrive  
On that perennial light  
Impress a bolder empire of energy  
In the ships we see  
The coming of outer space  
  
You say theres no reason to conjure  
With the force as it has been known to be see  
You say Im a fool a believer  
Put your feet on the earth it is green  
  
But look out in the night  
Wait for they arrive  
To start such sciences anew  
Here it is the coming of outer space  
Such a pure delight  
The coming of outer space
