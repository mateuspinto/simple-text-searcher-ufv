Only once the drugs are done that I feel like dying I feel like dying  
Only once the drugs are done that I feel like dying I feel like dying  
Only once the drugs are done that I feel like dying I feel like dying  
I feel like I feel like I feel like  
  
Yeah hello  
Get lifted  
Yeah I get lifted  
Yeah yeah so get lifted yup Haha  
  
I am sittin on the clouds I got smoke comin from my seat  
I can play basketball with the moon I got the whole world at my feet  
Playin touch football on marijuana street  
Or in a marijuana field you are so beneath my cleets  
Get high so high that I feel like lying  
Down in a cigar roll me up and smoke me cause  
I feel like dying  
  
Only once the drugs are done that I feel like dying I feel like dying  
Only once the drugs are done that I feel like dying I feel like dying  
I feel like I feel like I feel like  
  
Swimming laps around a bottle of Louis the Thirteenth  
Jumpin off of a mountain into a sea of Codeine  
Im at the top of the top but still I climb  
And if I should ever fall the ground would then turn to wine  
Pop pop I feel like flying then I feel like frying then  
I feel like dying  
  
Only once the drugs are done that I feel like dying I feel like dying  
Only once the drugs are done that I feel like dying I feel like dying  
I feel like I feel like I feel like  
  
I can mingle with the stars and throw a party on Mars  
I am a prisoner locked up behind Xanax bars  
I have just boarded a plane without a pilot  
And violets are blue roses are red  
Daisies are yellow the flowers are dead  
Wish I can give you this feeling I feel like buying  
And if my dealer dont have no more then  
I feel like dying  
  
Only once the drugs are done that I feel like dying I feel like dying  
Only once the drugs are done that I feel like dying I feel like dying
