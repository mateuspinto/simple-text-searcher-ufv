Skies are crying  
I am watching  
Catching tear drops in my hands  
Only silence  
Has an ending  
Like we never had a chance  
  
Do you have to  
Make me feel like  
There is nothing left of me  
  
Chorus  
You can take everything I have  
You can break everything I am  
Like Im made of glass  
Like Im made of paper  
Go on and try to tear me down  
I will be rising from the ground  
Like a skyscraper  
Like a skyscraper  
  
As the smoke clears  
I awaken  
And untangle you from me  
Would it make you  
Feel better  
To watch me while I bleed  
  
All my windows  
Still are broken  
But Im standing on my feet  
  
Chorus  
  
Go run run run  
Im gonna stay right here  
Watch you disappear ya yaa  
Go run run run  
Ya its a long way down  
But I am closer to the clouds up here  
  
Chorus  
  
Like a skyscraper  
Like a skyscraper  
Like a skyscraper
