Early in the morning  
About the break of day  
The earlybird is working  
So his life dont fade away  
Spends his life denying that  
Hes got no time for flying  
In the breeze  
High up on his own the eagle flies alone  
And he is free  
Earlybird is scratching though  
The goings getting tough  
Time is passing by him and he just  
Cant get enough  
Hell tell you all is well when  
All is really going wrong  
The earlybird will wake one day  
And find his life is gone  
You know I like to lay in bed  
And sleep out in the sun  
Reading books and playing crazy music  
Just for fun  
You know it makes feel so fine  
And puts my mind at ease to  
Know that I dont harm a soul  
In doing what I please  
Aaahhhh ahhhh  ahhhhh ahhh  
Any old day you say  
Aint gonna fade away  
Any old day you say  
Aint gonna fade away
