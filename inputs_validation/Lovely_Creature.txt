There she stands this lovely creature  
There she stands there she stands  
With her hair full of ribbons  
And green gloves on her hands  
So I asked this lovely creature  
Yes I asked yes I asked  
Would she walk with me a while  
Through this night so fast  
She took my hand this lovely creature  
Yes she said yes she said  
Yes Ill walk with you a while  
It was a joyful man she led  
Over hills this lovely creature  
Over mountains over ranges  
By great pyramids and sphinxs  
We met drifters and strangers  
Oh the sands my lovely creature  
And the mad moaning winds  
At night the deserts writhed  
With diabolical things  
Through the night through the night  
The wind lashed and it whipped me  
When I got home my lovely creature  
She was no longer with me  
Somewhere she lies this lovely creature  
Beneath the slow drifting sands  
With her hair full of ribbons  
And green gloves on her hands
