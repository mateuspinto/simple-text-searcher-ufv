Theres evil in goodness and goodness in bad  
Remember the first kiss the first kiss you had  
Choked on her tongue and bit on her lip  
She gave her number but that was it  
  
Chorus  
Did the first thing wrong did the first thing wrong  
Oh eyes to the ceiling and pants on the floor  
I did the first thing wrong  
  
Drove to the city to see the bright lights  
The boys on the corner looked ready to fight  
I stuck my neck out and I looked at his face  
I left her standing I was caught in a chase  
  
Chorus  
But its four in the morning and I knock on the door  
She says how you doin   and I say Im not sure  
I kick the bottles all downstairs  
Guys are freaking out  so what I dont care  
  
Chorus  
Did the first thing wrong  
Did the first thing wrong  
Did the first thing wrong
