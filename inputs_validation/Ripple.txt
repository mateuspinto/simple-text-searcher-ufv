If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine  
And my tunes were played on the harp unstrung  
Would you hear my voice come through the music  
Would you hold it near as it were your own  
  
Its a handmedown the thoughts are broken  
Perhaps theyre better left unsung  
I dont know dont really care  
Let there be songs to fill the air  
  
Chorus  
Ripple in still water  
When there is no pebble tossed  
Nor wind to blow  
  
Reach out your hand if your cup be empty  
If your cup is full may it be again  
Let it be known there is a fountain  
That was not made by the hands of men  
  
There is a road no simple highway  
Between the dawn and the dark of night  
And if you go no one may follow  
That path is for your steps alone  
  
Chorus  
  
You who choose to lead must follow  
But if you fall you fall alone  
If you should stand then whos to guide you  
If I knew the way I would take you home
