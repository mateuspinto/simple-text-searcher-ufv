I know youre disappointed  
In the way I handled things  
Youre thinking I misread the times  
And acted cowardly  
And since what I do affects us both  
And you feel that I let you down  
  
Chorus  
Youre paying a price when there is no price to pay  
Lovers trust no money down  
Youre paying a price when there is no price to pay  
Lovers trust no money down  
  
Hey lover  
Hey lover  
Lover  
  
They say theres someone for everyone  
And for everyone a someone  
And some tattoo roses across their chests  
With a heart that says Rollo  
And some work without a public relations man  
And do their best work baby out of sight  
  
Chorus  
  
Hey lover  
Hey lover  
Lover  
  
Now I have known a hero or two  
And they all learn to swim through mud  
And they all got boots caked with dirty soles  
That they get from squashing bugs  
So when push comes to shove get the Harley revved up  
The moon can eclipse even the sun  
  
Chorus  
  
Lovers trust no money down Hey lover  
Yes lovers trust no money down Hey lover  
Lovers trust no money down Hey hey lover  
Lovers trust no money down Hey hey lover  
Hey hey lover  
Hey hey lover
