Bright morning lights  
Wipe the sleep from another days eye  
Turn away from the wall  
And theres Nothing at all  
Being naked and afraid  
In the open space of my bed  
  
Ill be with you now  
Ill be with you now  
Ill be with you now  
We lie on a cloud  
We lie  
  
Just as I am  
I awoke with a tear on my tongue  
I awoke with a feeling of never before  
In my sleep I discover the one  
But she ran with the morning sun  
  
Ill be with you now  
Ill be with you now  
Ill be with you now  
We lie on a cloud  
We lie  
Another time another place  
We lie  
Another child has lost the race  
We lie  
Another time another place  
We lie  
Your time your price  
  
We lie  
Another time another place  
We lie  
Another child has lost
