This is a time for seeing and singing  
This is a time for breathing You in  
And breathing out Yourpraise  
Our hearts repsond to Your revelation  
All you are showing all we have seen  
Commands a life of praise  
No one can sing of things they have not seen  
God open our eyes towards a greater glimpse  
The glory of You the glory of You  
God open our eyes towards a greater glimpse  
Worship starts with seeing You  
Worship starts with seeing You  
Our hearts respond to Your revelation  
Worship starts with seeing You  
Worship starts with seeing You  
Our hearts respond to Your revelation
