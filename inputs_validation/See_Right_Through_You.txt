Tell me what kind of girl  
Would want to play me  
Tear me down and  
Try to break me  
Baby how could you betray me  
After all Ive done for you  
Take it there  
But your damn ass has  
Lied enough babe  
Better get your story straight babe  
Tell me why you want to play  
Ive had enough  
These games theyve gotta stop  
About to get pissed off  
You had to keep leading me on  
Baby I thought  
You had me fooled  
But I see right through you  
  
Chorus  
Look in to my eyes  
Tell me what you see  
You see a man  
Who thought you loved me  
Played me like a fool  
But I see right through you  
I look in to your eyes  
Tell you what I see  
I see a girl who made me lonely  
Though you had me fooled  
But I see right through you  
  
Tell me girl whats his name  
What he do to take you  
Does he freak you the way  
That I do  
Cause you know that  
I know how to  
I know how to  
When he leaves you  
Dont come crying back to me  
Cause Ill be moving on you see  
And youll be just a memory  
I think Ive had enough  
  
These games theyve gotta stop  
About to get pissed off  
You had to keep leading me on  
Baby I thought  
You had me fooled  
But I see right through you  
  
Chorus  
  
Thought you had me fooled  
See right  
Through you  
Oh see see see right  
Through you  
  
Baby tell me does he  
Do it do it like I do  
Baby tell me will he  
Love you love you like I do  
Now you whining  
Cause you cant believe  
The way its through  
I dont care cause I  
See right through you  
Let me tell you that uh  
This is how its gonna be  
Thought Id forgive for  
What you did to me  
But you wont do this to me  
Cause now I  
See right through you  
  
Chorus x2  
  
See right through you  
See right through you
