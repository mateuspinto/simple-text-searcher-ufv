You never lose a minute if in it there is love  
And old man time always pulls you through  
Its better not to depend on the morning dew  
For the rose you plant in your bed tends to you hard and blue  
  
Some folks take money some take their life some take forever to see  
Blind faith blind love theyre no mystery to me  
You must take the time for thats the fee  
  
Chorus  
  
Its worth the pain that makes the tears  
Its worth the light of a million years  
Only your love I cant explain you are the flower for my rain  
  
You light the sun that shines from my eyes  
Its all in return for what youre giving me  
You are the reason for the earth beneath my feet  
And you kill the space that I call free  
  
You are the flower for my rain you are the flower for my rain  
You are the flower for my rain you are the flower for my rain  
You are the flower for my rain you are the flower for my rain
