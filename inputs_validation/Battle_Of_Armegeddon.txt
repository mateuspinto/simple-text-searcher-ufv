Theres a mighty battle coming and its well now on its way  
Itll be fought at armageddon it shall be a sad sad day  
In the book of revelation words in chapter sixteen say  
Therell be gathered there great armies for that battle on that day  
  
refrain  
All the way from the gates of eden to the battle of armageddon  
Theres been trobles and tribulation therell be sorrow and despair  
He has said ye not be troubled for these things shall come to pass  
Then your life will be eternal when you dwell with him at last  
  
Turn the pages of your bible in st Matthew you will see  
Start with chapter twentyfour and read from one to thirtythree  
In our saviors blessed words he said on earth he prophesised  
For he spoke of this great battle that is coming by and by  
  
refrain  
  
Therell be nation against nation therell be war and rumor of war  
Therell be great signs in heaven in the sun the moon the stars  
Oh the hearts of been shall fail them therell be gnashing of the teeth  
Those who seek it will recieve it mercy at the saviors feet  
  
refrain
