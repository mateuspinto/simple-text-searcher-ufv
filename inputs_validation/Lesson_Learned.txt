Just another lesson learned  
Wear a scar a bore repeating  
Take a simple fateful turn  
Opened up to stop the bleeding  
  
Feeling you never could  
Been the disconnected frying  
Hit the vein and struck a nerve  
Seeing through a self thats blinding  
  
Nowhere to buy in  
Most of us hiding  
Others are shining  
  
You know when you find it  
In your darkest hour you strike gold  
A thought clicks not the beall endall  
Just another lesson learned  
  
Just another brick you toss  
Stone the number one deceiver  
Multiply the added cost  
Easy to become a believer  
  
Feeling like you never could  
Been the disconnected frying  
Hit the vein and struck a nerve  
Seeing through a self thats blinding  
  
Nowhere to buy in  
Most of us hiding  
Others are shining  
  
You know when you find it  
In your darkest hour you strike gold  
A thought clicks not the beall endall  
  
Just another lesson learned
