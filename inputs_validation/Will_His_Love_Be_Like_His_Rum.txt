Will his love be like his rum  
Yes it will yes it will  
Intoxicating all night long  
Yes it will yes it will everybody  
  
Drink drink this toast  
Drink this wedding toast  
Drink oh drink this toast  
To the two we love the most  
  
Did he wed her in the spring  
Yes he did yes he did  
Did he give her finger ring  
Yes he did yes he did  
  
Will her cooking be the best  
Yes it will yes it will  
Make his belly split his best  
Yes it will yes it will  
  
Will she be a perfect wife  
Yes she will yes she will  
Make him work hard all his life  
Yes she will yes she will  
  
Will we dance and sing all nighta  
Yes we will yes we will  
Eat up everything inside  
Yes we will yes we will
