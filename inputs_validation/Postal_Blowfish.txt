Noticing the change we are taking time  
Everybody knows everybodys fine  
And well figure out our purpose in the end  
Unless we have to jump unless we have to swim  
  
Hold you tongue brace yourself  
Give me a kiss show me what I miss  
  
Can I find a phone can I drop a dime  
Can I get a loan runing out of time  
And Ive have a toast to what its all about  
unknown  
  
Hold you tongue brace yourself  
Give me a kiss you show me what I miss  
unknown
