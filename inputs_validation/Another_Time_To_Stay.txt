Had another dream oh yeah  
The play was rolling slowly  
Had another dream oh yeah  
But I could not see you only  
  
Just hold me  
cause lying in your arms its you I have  
Yeah lying in your arms its you I have  
  
This is another time to stay  
This is another time to stay  
Though I dont think my dreams will see the day  
  
All of us bring a smile  
Mines broken please stay
