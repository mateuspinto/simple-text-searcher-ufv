I was born a black boy  
My name is Emmett Till  
I walked this earth for fourteen years  
Then one night I was killed  
For speaking to a woman  
Whose skin was as white as dough  
Thats a sin in Mississippi  
But how was I to know  
  
Id come down from Chicago  
To visit with my kin  
Up there I was a cheeky kid  
I guess I always been  
But the harm they put upon me  
Was too hard for what I done  
For I was just a black boy  
I never hurt no one  
  
They took me from my uncles house  
Mose Wright was his name  
Hed later stand and without hesitation  
Point the blame  
At the ones who beat and cut me  
And shot me with a gun  
Then threw me in the river  
Like I was trash when they were done  
  
I was sent back to my mother  
At least what was left of me  
She kept my casket open  
For the whole wide world to see  
The awful desecration  
And the evidence of hate  
You could not recognize me  
The mutilation was so great  
  
There came a cry for justice then  
To be finally fulfilled  
All because of me a black boy  
My name is Emmett Till  
  
But Id have rather lived  
Til I was too old to die young  
Not miss all I left behind  
All that might have come  
The summer clouds above my head  
The grass beneath my feet  
The warmth of a good woman  
Her kisses soft and sweet  
  
Perhaps to be a father  
With a black boy of my own  
And watch him grow into  
A kinder world than I had known  
  
Where no child would be murdered  
For the color of his skin  
And love would be the only thing  
Inside the hearts of men  
  
They say the horror of that night  
Is still haunting heaven still  
Where I am one more black boy  
My name is Emmett Till
