L Reed  
  
And what costume shall the poor girl wear  
To all tomorrows parties  
A handmedown dress from who knows where  
To all tomorrows parties  
  
And where will she go and what shall she do  
When midnight comes around  
Shell turn once more to Sundays gown  
And cry behind the door  
  
And what costume shall the poor girl wear  
To all tomorrows parties  
Why silks and plumes of yesterdays gowns  
To all tomorrows parties  
  
And what shall she do with Thursdays rags  
When Monday comes around  
Shell turn once more to Sundays clown  
And cry behind the door  
  
And what costume shall the poor girl wear  
To all tomorrows parties  
For Thursdays child is Sundays clown  
For whom none will go mourning  
  
A blackened shroud a handmedown gown  
Of rags and silks a costume  
Fit for one who sits and cries  
For all tomorrows parties
