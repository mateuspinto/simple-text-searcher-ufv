Itemise the things you  
Covet as you squander  
Through your life  
Bigger cars bigger  
Houses term insurance  
For your wife  
Tuesday evenings with your harlot  
And on Wednesdays its  
Your charlatan analyst  
Hes high upon your list  
You got air conditioned  
Sinuses and dark disturbing doubts  
About religion  
And you keep those cards  
And letters going out  
And while your  
Secretarys tempting you  
Your morals are exepting  
You from guilt and shame  
Heaven knows  
Youre not to blame  
You better take care of  
Business Mr Businessman  
Whats your plan  
Get down to business  
Mr Businessman if you can  
Before its too late  
And they throw your life away  
Did you see your children  
Growing up today  
And did you hear the  
Music of their laughter  
As they set about to play  
And did you smell the  
Fragrance of those roses  
In your garden  
Did the morning sunlight  
Warm your soul and  
Brighten up your day  
Do you qualify to be  
Alive or is the limit  
Of your senses  
So as only to survive  
Spending counterfeit  
Incentive wasting  
Precious time and health  
Placing values on the  
Worthless disregarding  
Priceless wealth  
Well you can wheel and  
Deal the best of them  
And steal it from the rest of them  
You know the score  
Their ethics are a bore  
86 proof anesthetic crutches  
Brought you to the top  
Where the smiles are all synthetic  
And the ulcers never stop  
When they take that final inventory  
Yours will be the same  
Sad story everywhere   
No one will really care no one more lonely than  
This rich important man  
Lets have your autograph  
ENDORSE your epitaph  
You better take care  
if you can
