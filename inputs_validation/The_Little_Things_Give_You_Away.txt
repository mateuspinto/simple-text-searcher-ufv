Water gray  
Through the windows up the stairs  
Chilling rain  
Like an ocean everywhere  
Dont wanna reach for me do you  
I mean nothin to you  
The little things give you away  
And now there will be no mistakin  
The levees are breakin  
  
All youve ever wanted  
Was someone to truly look up to you  
And six feet under water  
I do  
  
Hope decays  
Generations disappear  
Washed away  
As a nation simply stares  
  
Dont wanna reach for me do you  
I mean nothin to you  
The little things give you away  
But there will be no mistakin  
The levees are breakin  
  
All youve ever wanted  
Was someone to truly look up to you  
And six feet under water  
I do  
All youve ever wanted  
Was someone to truly look up to you  
And six feet under ground now  
Now I  
Now I do  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Little things give you away  
Little things give you away  
Little things give you away  
Little things give you away  
  
All youve ever wanted Little things give you away  
Was someone to truly look up to you Little things give you away  
All youve ever wanted Little things give you away  
Was someone to truly look up to you Little things give you away  
All youve ever wanted Little things give you away  
Was someone to truly look up to you Little things give you away  
All youve ever wanted Little things give you away  
Was someone to truly look up to you Little things give you away  
All youve ever wanted Little things give you away  
Was someone to truly look up to you Little things give you away  
All youve ever wanted Little things give you away  
Was someone to truly look up to you Little things give you away
