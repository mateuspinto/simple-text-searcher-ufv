I was in the pub last night  
A mutual friend of ours said  
hed seen you in the uniform  
Yeah the leather belt looks manly  
The black boots butch  
But oh what a bastard to get off  
  
Promises promises  
They offer real solutions  
But hatred has never won for long  
  
You was so open minded  
But by someone blinded  
And now your sign says closed  
  
Promises promises  
They offer real solutions  
But hatred has never won for long  
  
I think weve lost our perception   
I think weve lost sight of the goals we should  
Be working for  
I think weve lost our reason  
We stumble blindly and that vision must be restored  
  
I wish that there was something  
I could do about it  
I wish that there was some way  
I could try to fight it  
Scream and shout it   
  
But something you said set the house ablaze  
It is called indoctrination  
And it happens on all levels  
But it has nothing to do with equality  
It has nothing to do with democracy  
And though it professes to  
It has nothing to do with humanity  
It is cold hard and mechanical
