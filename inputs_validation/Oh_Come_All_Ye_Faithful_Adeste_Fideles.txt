Adeste fideles  
Laeti triumphantes  
Venite venite in Bethlehem  
  
Natum videte  
Regem angelorum  
Venite adoremus  
Venite adoremus  
Venite adoremus  
Dominum  
  
Oh come all ye faithful  
Joyful and triumphant  
Oh come ye  
Oh come ye to Bethlehem  
  
Come and behold Him  
Born the King of angels  
Oh come let us adore him  
Oh come let us adore him  
Oh come let us adore him  
Christ The Lord  
  
Oh come let us adore him  
Oh come let us adore him  
Oh come let us adore him  
Christ The Lord
