Burst into heaven  
Kissing the cotton clouds  
Arctic sheets and fields of wheat  
I cant stop coming down  
Your shrunken head  
Looking down on me above  
Send me home like an elephant stone  
To smash my dream of love  
Dreaming till the sun goes down  
And night turns into day  
Rooms are empty Ive got plenty  
You could move in right away  
  
It seems like theres a hole  
In my dreams  
In my dreams  
In my dreams  
  
Down through the heavens  
Choke on the cotton clouds  
Arctic sheets and fields of wheat  
I cant stop coming down  
Your shrunken head  
Looking down on me above  
Send me home like an elephant stone  
To smash my dream of love  
  
Did your bed and bookshelf go  
And run run run away  
These four walls saw the rise and fall  
And your midnight getaway  
Seems like theres a hole  
In my dreams  
Or so it seems  
Yet nothing means anything  
Anymore
