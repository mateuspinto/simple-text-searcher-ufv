For some time Ive watched your coldness grow  
Its true that nothing lasts forever I guess  
But your resentment is so strong that it shows  
You seem to like me better the more you see me less  
You seem to like me better the less you see of me  
The more I try the more you once set free  
To love you I done my very best but you like me better the more you see me
less  
 steel   
I cant believe it youre really gonna let me fall  
Cause the times that I gave you were my best  
My consolation is ever having you at all  
But now you like me better the more you see me less  
You seem to like me better  
You seem to like me better the more you see me less
