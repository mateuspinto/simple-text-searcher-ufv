As I wash my dishes Ill be following a plan  
Till I see the brightness in every pot and pan  
I am sure this point of view will ease the daily grind  
So Ill keep repeating in my mind  
  
Look for the silver lining  
Whenever a cloud appears in the blue  
Remember somewhere the sun is shining  
And so the right thing to do is make it shine for you  
  
A heart full of joy and gladness  
Will always banish sadness and strife  
So always look for the silver lining  
And try to find the sunny side of life  
  
So always look for the silver lining  
And try to find the sunny side of life
