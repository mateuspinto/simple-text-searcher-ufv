Chorus x2  
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl  
I never meant to bring you to my world  
Now you sitting in the corner crying  
And now its my fault My fault  
  
I went to Johns rave with Ron and Dave  
And met a new wave blond babe with half of her head shaved  
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up  
With first aid tape and raped on the first date  
Susan an ex heroin addict who just stopped using  
She loved booze and alternative music  
Told me she was going back to using again  
I said wait first try this hallucinogen  
Its better then heroin and booze and gin  
Come here lets go in here  
Whos in the den Its me and Kelly  
My bad lets try another room I dont trust you  
Shut up slut chew up this mushroom  
This will help you get in touch with your roots  
Walking barefoot butt naked and run in the woods  
Oh hell I might as well try them this party is so drag  
Oh dag I didnt mean for you to eat the whole bag Uh  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Yo Sue Get away from me I dont know you  
Oh shoot shes tripping I need to go puke  
I wasnt trying to turn this into something major  
I just wanted to make you appreciate nature  
Susie stop crying I dont hate ya  
The world is not against you  
I am sorry your father raped you  
So you had your little coochie in your dads mouth  
That aint no reason to start wiggin and spaz out  
She said Help me I think I am having a seizure  
I said I am high too bitch  
Quit grabbing my tshirt Let go  
Would you calm down you are starting to scare me  
She said I am 26 years old and I am not married I dont even have any  
Kids and I cant cook  
I am over here Sue  
You are talking to the plant  
Look we need to get to a hospital  
Before it is too late  
Cause I never seen one eat as many shrooms as you ate  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Susie where you going you better be careful  
leave me alone dad I am sick of getting my hair pulled  
I am not your dad  
And try not to swallow your tongue  
Want some gum  
Put down the scissors before you do something dumb  
I will be right back just chill baby please  
I got to go find Dave he is the one who gave me these  
John wheres Dave at before I bash you  
Hes in the bathroom  
I think he is taking a crap dude  
Dave pull up your pants  
We need an ambulance  
Theres a girl upstairs talking to plants  
Chopping her hair off  
And theres only two days left of spring break  
How long do these things take to wear off  
Well it depends on how may youve had  
I took 3 she had the other 22 caps  
Now she is upstairs crying out her eye balls  
Drinking Lysol She is going to die dude  
I know and its my fault My god  
  
Chorus x2  
  
I am so sorry I am so sorry  
Susie please wake up  
What are you doing  
Your not dead
