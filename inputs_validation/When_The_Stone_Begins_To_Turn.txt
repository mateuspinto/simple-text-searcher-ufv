I come here for Dr King  
Who gave the people a precious thing  
He found a light in the darkest hour  
And the strength for speaking truth to power  
And in the years since they shot him down  
You see changes that once were a dream  
Begin to come around  
When the walls have begun to crumble  
When the laws have begun to burn  
When the wind is singing freedom  
When the stone begins to turn  
And I come here to praise Mandela  
And to bring this message to his jailer  
Your walls may hold the man inside  
But theyll never ever hold back the tide  
Cause in the years youve shut him away  
A generation has grown where he stood  
Theyre gonna see the day  
When the walls have begun to crumble  
When the laws have begun to burn  
When the wind is singing freedom  
When the stone begins to turn  
We come here to sing for freedom  
And to send our voices to the ones who need them  
Freedom for South Africa  
And justice for Nelson Mandela  
Cause in the years theyve shut him away  
A generation has grown where he stood  
Were gonna see that day  
When the walls have begun to crumble  
When the laws have begun to burn  
When the wind is singing freedom  
When the stone begins to turn  
When the wind is singing freedom  
When the wind is singing freedom  
When the wind is singing freedom  
When the wind is singing freedom  
Freedom  
Freedom  
Freedom
