My cheeks were reflecting the longest wavelength  
My fan was folded up and grazing my forehead  
And I kept touching my neck  
To guide your eye to where I wanted you to kiss me when we find some time
alone  
  
My scars were reflecting the mist in your headlights  
I looked like a neon zebra shaking rain off her stripes  
And the rivulets had you riveted  
To the places that I wanted you to kiss me when we find some time alone  
  
And then we can do anything we want  
And then we can do anything we want  
And then we can do anything we want  
  
We started out sipping the water  
And now we try to swallow the wave  
And we try not to let those bastards get us down  
We dont worry anymore cause we know when the gulf comes we get brave  
After all look around  
Its happening its happening its happenin now  
  
Lets pretend were eight years old playing hookey  
Ill draw on the wall and you can play UFC rookie  
Then well grow up  
Take our clothes off  
And you remind me that I wanted you to kiss me when we find some time alone  
  
And then we can do anything we want  
And then we can do anything we want  
And then we can do anything we want  
And then we can do anything we want
