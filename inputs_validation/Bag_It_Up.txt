Gold and silver and sunshine is rising up  
Pour yourself another cup of Lady Grey  
Take my hand in the meantime when youve had enough  
Youll find me on the end of a runway babe  
  
Tell the world that you love them in a melody  
Send my old piano and a telegram  
Gotta get me a doctor with a remedy  
Im gonna take a walk with the Monkey Man  
  
Someone tell me Im dreaming  
The freaks are rising up through the floor  
Everything I believe in  
Is telling me that I want more more more  
  
Chorus  
Lay your love on the fire when you come on in  
I got my heebeejeebees in a hidden bag  
Tell me what you desire and well bag it up high  
  
Someone tell me Im dreaming  
The freaks are rising up through the floor  
Everything I believe in  
Is telling me that I want more more more  
  
Chorus  
  
Shine a light on your fire when you come on in  
I got my heebeejeebees in a hidden bag  
Tell me what you desire and well bag it up high
