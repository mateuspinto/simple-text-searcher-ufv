Sing a song of sixpence pocket full of rye  
Husha bye my baby no need to be crying  
You can burn the midnight oil with me  
as long as you will  
Stare out at the moon  
upon the windowsill and dream  
  
Sing a song of sixpence pocket full of rye  
Husha bye my baby no need to be crying  
Theres dew drops on the window sill  
gumdrops in your head  
Slipping into dream land  
youre nodding your head so dream  
  
Dream of West Virginia or of the British Isles  
Cause when you are dreaming  
you see for miles and miles  
When you are much older remember when we sat  
At midnight on the windowsill  
and had this little chat  
And dream come on and dream  
come on and dream and dream and dream
