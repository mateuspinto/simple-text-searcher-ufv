The man steps out in the moonlight  
At the sound of a scream from below  
He thinks he is a warrior  
So he picks up his sword and goes  
  
From the mouth of the monster  
He rescues the maiden fair  
But we know shes a demon  
Come to lure him to demons lair  
  
Through restless foliage and tall trees he leads  
To a house in a clearing a place in her fear she calls home  
  
Come with me I need you  
I fear the dark and I live all alone  
Ill give you wine and food too  
And something special after if you like  
  
And though his body bids him  
To enter in with her  
There was something in her manner  
That his mind could not ignore  
  
Also it is whispered  
In the kingdom far and wide  
To beware a little cottage  
In the forest in a glade  
  
For who knows what magic takes place in his world  
So he just thanks her kindly preparing to go on his way  
  
Come with me I need you  
I fear the dark and I live all alone  
Ill give you wine and food too  
And something special after if you like  
  
Come to my garden  
Taste the fruits and the spices of love  
You cant resist me  
Im the kind that your dreams tell you of  
  
So glad you could make it  
We had everything arranged  
So glad you saw fit to pay a call  
  
Some men never listen  
And others never learn  
But why this man did as he did  
Only he will ever know  
  
He knew he was walking  
Into a waiting trap  
Neatly set up for him  
With a bait so richly wrapped  
  
So he went inside there to take on what he found  
But he never escaped them for who can escape what he desires  
  
Come with me I need you  
I fear the dark and I live all alone  
Ill give you wine and food too  
And something special after if you like
