Yeah  
All is quiet on New Years Day  
A world in white gets underway  
I want to be with you  
Be with you night and day  
Nothing changes on New Years Day  
On New Years Day  
  
I will be with you again  
I will be with you again  
  
Under a blood red sky  
A crowd has gathered in black and white  
Arms entwined the chosen few  
The newspapers says says  
Say its true its true  
And we can break through  
Though torn in two  
We can be one  
  
I I will begin again  
I I will begin again  
  
Oh oh  
  
Oh oh  
Oh oh  
Oh oh  
  
Oh oh  
Oh oh  
Oh oh  
  
Ah maybe the time is right  
Oh maybe tonight  
  
I will be with you again  
I will be with you again  
  
And so were told this is the golden age  
And gold is the reason for the wars we wage  
Though I want to be with you  
Be with you night and day  
Nothing changes  
On New Years Day  
On New Years Day  
On New Years Day
