Chorus  
Where them girls at Girls at  
That like to be in charge  
When the heat get too hot they just keep turnin it up  
Never let em see see that you sweat gotta go hard  
Where those winning women thats really willin to take it off  
Where them girls at Girls at  
That like to be in charge  
When the heat gets too hot just keep turnin it up  
Never let em see see that you sweat gotta go hard  
Where those winning women thats really willin to take it off  
  
Verse One  
Uhuhuhuh huh  
When you see both of us on catwalk representing our culture  
Uhuhuhuh huh  
Well the time and day has changed where the women wear the pants without
changing the last name  
Uhuhuhuh huh  
Where the word diva diva mean viva viva we run las vegas  
Uhuhuhuh huh  
And then the stock exchange bang Than we got claim to the change  
  
All all all a girl want wants  
All a girl need needs  
Its just all those simple things like to be cared for  
Just to have him be there for  
All that matters its those sweet things  
Thats all a girl really wants  
  
Chorus  
Where them girls at Girls at  
That like to be in charge  
When the heat get too hot they just keep turnin it up  
Never let em see see that you sweat gotta go hard  
Where those winning women thats really willin to take it off  
Where them girls at Girls at  
That like to be in charge  
When the heat gets too hot just keep turnin it up  
Never let em see see that you sweat gotta go hard  
Where those winning women thats really willin to take it off  
  
Verse Two  
Uhuhuhuh huh  
We are too confident me and her talk to Phil never happen again  
Uhuhuhuh huh  
We dont wait we get paid for a trait holiday we sip lemonade  
Uhuhuhuh huh  
Instead of doing what he wants we do what we want buying homes in Geneva  
Uhuhuhuh huh  
Like when the sound baby glance rings and that means more than things  
  
All all all a girl want wants  
All a girl need needs  
Its just of those simple things like to be cared for  
Just to have him be there for  
All that matters its those sweet things  
Thats all a girl really wants  
  
Chorus x2  
Where them girls at Girls at  
That like to be in charge  
When the heat get too hot they just keep turnin it up  
Never let em see see that you sweat gotta go hard  
Where those winning women thats really willin to take it off  
Where them girls at Girls at  
That like to be in charge  
When the heat gets too hot just keep turnin it up  
Never let em see see that you sweat gotta go hard  
Where those winning women thats really willin to take it off
