Wicked prophets kill speaking his name  
In the glory of an innocent age  
A king is born to a house filled with rage  
One mans fear is another mans truth one fear  
  
The blind suffer at the hands of sin  
Lines are drawn where the boundaries begin  
Ten thousand broken by the madness within  
Broken  
  
One more cry in the night one more  
One more war left to fight one more  
One life cut down by fire  
Once childs angry desire one more  
  
Hearts of stone pride without shame  
Wicked prophets kill while speaking his name  
As the heavens fall from the sky  
Fallin  
  
Brother to brother blood on their hands  
Desolation in the kingdom of man  
Holy vengeance is the justice of hell  
Mercy mercy  
  
One more cry in the night one more  
One more war left to fight one more  
One life cut down by fire  
Once childs angry desire one more  
  
Wings of fire drums of thunder  
No more no more  
One more cry in the night one more  
One more was was left to fight one more  
  
One life cut down by fire  
One childs angry desire one more  
One more one
