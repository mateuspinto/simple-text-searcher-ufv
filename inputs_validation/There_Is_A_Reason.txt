Ive seen hard times and Ive been told  
There isnt any wonder that I fall  
Why do we suffer crossing off the years  
There must be a reason for it all  
  
Ive trusted in You Jesus to save me from my sin  
Heaven is the place I call my home  
But I keep on getting caught up in this world Im living in  
And Your voice it sometimes fades before I know  
  
Hurtin brings my heart to You crying with my need  
Depending on Your love to carry me  
The love that shed His blood for all the world to see  
This must be the reason for it all  
  
Hurtin brings my heart to You a fortress in the storm  
When what I wrap my heart around is gone  
I give my heart so easily to the ruler of this world  
When the one who loves me most will give me all  
  
In all the things that cause me pain You give me eyes to see  
I do believe but help my unbelief  
Ive seen hard times and Ive been told  
There is a reason for it all
