  
Dont look away  
An innocent face  
Cries and searches for some comfort  
Love will provide  
What fate has denied  
All they ask is simply someone  
  
With arms that reach  
And words that teach  
Will be their strength  
In times of need  
  
Every boy and girl  
Should dance on dreams  
Around this world  
Arent they all our children after all  
Who will dry their tears  
And lift them up  
If they should fall  
Arent they all our children after all  
  
Who will be there  
To show them love and care  
They are this worlds living treasure  
The heart of a child  
Is born to wear a smile  
And feel joyful without measure  
  
With arms that reach  
And words that teach  
Will be their strength  
In times of need  
Well hold their hearts  
In loving hands  
Help them believe  
In love again  
  
Every boy and girl  
Should dance on dreams  
Around this world  
Arent they all our children after all  
Who will dry their tears  
And lift them up  
If they should fall  
Arent they all our children after all  
Arent we all their children after all  
  
And as they grow  
They will always know  
That love will ease their troubled road  
And you and I  
Are their wings  
To help them fly  
  
Every boy and girl  
Should dance on dreams  
Around this world  
Arent they all our children after all  
Who will dry their tears  
And lift them up  
If they should fall  
Arent they all our children after all  
Arent they all our children after all  
  
Arent they all our children after all
