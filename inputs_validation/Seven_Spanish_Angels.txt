He looked down into her brown eyes  
Said  Say a prayer for me  
She threw her arms around him  
Whispered God will keep us free  
And they could hear the riders comin  
He said This is my last fight  
If they take me back to Texas  
They wont take me back alive  
  
Chorus  
And there were seven spanish angels  
At the altar of the sun  
They were prayin for the lovers  
In the valley of the gun  
And when the battle stopped  
And the smoke cleared  
There was thunder from the throne  
And seven spanish angels  
Took another angel home  
  
She reached down and picked the gun up  
That lay smokin in his hand  
Said Father please forgive me  
I cant make it without my man  
And she knew the gun was empty  
And she knew she couldnt win  
But her final prayer was answered  
When the rifles fired again  
  
Chorus
