OK  
I woke up in heaven today  
She kissed me I floated away away  
Never felt anything so great  
Alright  
Now I brace myself for a fight  
Something must go wrong  
Cuz its way to right  
Im light as a feather tonight  
  
Chorus  
Cause I cant feel the ground  
Someone let me down  
I never felt so high as I do now  
Its too good to be true  
I dont deserve you  
I never felt a love strong enough to  
Stop this world from spinning  
Stop this world from spinning  
  
And I see  
Heaven when she looks at me  
In her smile is the most amazing dream  
And in her eyes I fall asleep  
And I hope  
Hope that she can see through the smoke  
Of my imperfections into my soul  
And my heart where she has control she has control  
  
Chorus  
  
Happiness like this can never last can never last  
Turns into the memories of the past turns into the memories of the past  
Going just as fast  
  
Chorus
