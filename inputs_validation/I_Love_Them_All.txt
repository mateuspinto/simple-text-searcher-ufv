While lookin into my drawer only yesterday  
You know the things that I saw made me cry  
I saw the pictures and letters  
I should have known better  
Than to try to deny  
  
I love them all  
I love them all  
And if they came again  
Id do the same again  
Cause Im that kind of a guy  
  
And as I walked through the park where we used to play  
You know the bench and the tree are still there  
And the pictures that you did  
Why am I so stupid  
They wont ever disappear  
  
I love them all  
I love them all  
And if they came again  
Id do the same again  
Cause Im that kind of a guy
