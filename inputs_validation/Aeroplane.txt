Chorus  
I like pleasure spiked with pain  
And music is my aeroplane  
Its my aeroplane  
Songbird sweet and sour Jane  
And music is my aeroplane  
Its my aeroplane  
Pleasure spiked with pain  
That mother fucker always spiked with pain  
  
I  
Looking in my own eyes hello  
I cant find the love I want  
Someone better slap me  
Before I start to rust  
Before I start to decompose  
Looking in my rear view mirror  
Looking in my rear view mirror  
I can make it disappear  
I can make it disappear have no fear  
  
Chorus  
  
Sitting in my kitchen hey girl  
Im turning into dust again  
My melancholy baby  
The star of mazzy must  
Push her voice inside of me  
Im overcoming gravity  
Im overcoming gravity  
Its easy when youre sad to be  
Its easy when youre sad said bout me  
  
Chorus  
  
Just one note  
Could make me float  
Could make me float away  
One note from  
The song she wrote  
Could fuck me where I lay  
Just one note  
Could make me choke  
One note thats  
Not a lie  
Just one note  
Could cut my throat  
One note could make me die
