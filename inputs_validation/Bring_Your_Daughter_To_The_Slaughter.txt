Honey its getting close to midnight and all the myths are still in town  
True love and lipstick on your linen bite the pillow make no sound  
If theres some living to be done before your life becomes your tomb  
Youd better know that Im the one so unchain your back door invite me around  
  
Bring your daughter bring your daughter to the slaughter  
Let her go let her go let her go  
Bring your daughter bring your daughter to the slaughter  
Let her go let her go let her go  
Let her go yeah  
Honey its getting close to daybreak the sun is creeping in the sky  
No patent remedies for heartache just empty words and humble pie  
So get down on your knees honey assume an attitude  
You just pray that Ill be waiting cos you know Im coming soon  
  
Bring your daughter bring your daughter to the slaughter  
Let her go let her go let her go  
Bring your daughter bring your daughter to the slaughter  
Let her go let her go let her go  
  
So pick up your foolish pride no going back  
No where no way no place to hide
