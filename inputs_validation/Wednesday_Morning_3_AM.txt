I can hear the soft breathing  
Of the girl that I love  
As she lies here beside me  
Asleep with the night  
And her hair in a fine mist  
Floats on my pillow  
Reflecting the glow  
Of the winter moonlight  
She is soft she is warm  
But my heart remains heavy  
And I watch as her breasts  
Gently rise gently fall  
For I know with the first light of dawn  
Ill be leaving  
And tonight will be  
All I have left to recall  
Oh what have I done  
Why have I done it  
Ive committed a crime  
Ive broken the law  
For twentyfive dollars  
And pieces of silver  
I held up and robbed  
A hard liquor store  
My life seems unreal  
My crime an illusion  
A scene badly written  
In which I must play  
Yet I know as I gaze  
At my young love beside me  
The morning is just a few hours away
