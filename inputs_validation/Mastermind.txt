Anonymous existence rendered useless to mankind  
Destroy the logic volume in the confines of the mind  
En massed and purposeless marching in a perfect line  
Neoneuro torture mental meltdown a heinous crime  
Mastermind I tell you what to think  
I tell you what you need  
I tell what to feel  
Invade the core of souls to wipe the lives away  
Design vacant beings welcome the inhuman race  
Encrypted horror codes directive psyche overwrite  
Processing brains to pabulum  
Delete and format living drives  
I tell you whats real  
Hail to the power age lest the viral hour comes  
Raise the flag of voltage bow to circuitry unknown  
Kneel before the processor lords of static laugh  
Electrons in submission you must know who I am  
I tell you what to think  
I dont care what you thought  
I tell you what to get  
I dont care what you got  
Mastermind  
I dont care what you got  
Mastermind  
Mastermind  
Mastermind
