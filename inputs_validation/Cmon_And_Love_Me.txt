Shes a dancer a romancer  
Im a Capricorn and shes a Cancer  
She saw my picture in a music magazine  
  
When she met me said shed get me  
Touched her hips and told me that shed let me  
I took her hand baby this is what I said  
  
I said baby baby dont you hesitate  
Cause I just cant wait  
Lady wont you take me down to my knees  
You can do what you please  
Cmon and love me  
  
Im a man Im no baby  
And youre lookin every inch a lady  
Youre good lookin and youre lookin like you should be good  
  
You were distant now youre nearer  
I can feel your face inside the mirror  
The lights are out and I can feel you baby with my hand  
  
So baby baby dont you hesitate  
Cause I just cant wait

You can do what you please  
Cmon and love me
