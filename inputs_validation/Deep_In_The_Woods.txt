The woods eats the woman and dumps her honeybody in the mud  
Her dress floats down the well and it assumes the shape of the body of a
little girl  
  
Yeah I recognize that girl  
She stumbled in some time last loneliness  
But I could not stand to touch her now  
My one and onlyness  
  
Deep in the woods  
Deep in the woods  
Deep in the woods a funeral is swinging  
  
Worms make their cruel design  
Saying DIE into her skin  
Saying dead into belly and death into shoulder  
Well last night she kissed me but than death was upon her  
  
Deep in the woods  
Deep in the woods  
Deep in the woods a funeral is swinging  
  
Now the killed waits for the killer  
And the trees all nod their heads they are agreed  
This knife feels like a knife feels like a knife that feels like its feed  
Yeah I recognize that girl  
I took her from rags right through to stitches pray for me now  
Oh baby tonight we sleep in separate ditches  
  
Deep in the woods  
Deep in the woods  
Deep in the woods a funeral is swinging  
  
Love is for fools and all fools are lovers  
Its raining on my house and none of the others  
Love is for fools and God knows Im still one  
The sidewalks are filled with loves lonely children  
The sidewalk regrets that we had to kill them
