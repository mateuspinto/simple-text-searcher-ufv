Pardon the smile on my face my friend  
Dreamin of reachin my journeys end  
Im headin straight for my hearts desire  
Gee its good to know Im near the home fire  
  
All of the folks that I love are there  
I got a date with my favourite chair  
With every step every hope grows higher  
Didnt know how much I missed the home fire  
  
The noises the TV the rusty old pipes  
The cat always teasin my dog  
The neighbors the quarrels the screaming of kids  
For the first time in years Ill sleep like a log  
  
Heaven is waiting for me my friend  
Seven or eight dreams around the bend  
And if youre ever in town inquire  
Well be glad to have you share the home fire  
  
Yes the noises the TV the rusty old pipes  
The cat always teasin my dog  
The neighbours the quarrels the scream of the kids  
For the first time in years Ill sleep like a log  
  
Heaven is waiting for me my friend  
Seven or eight dreams around the bend  
And if youre ever in town inquire  
Well be glad to have you share the home fire  
  
Well be glad to have you share the home fire
