Draw me oh draw me please draw me my Jesus  
Into your presence where I cannot lie  
My soul is so thirsty I cannot endure it  
And if I cant get closer I surely will die  
  
Take me oh take me please take me my Jesus  
Quickly before I forget that Im lost  
For so many times my mind has deceived me  
That I really dont have to carry the cross  
That I really dont have to carry the cross  
  
I just need to know how to pray  
My wicked desires block the way  
Sometimes I have grieved you away  
I dont want to do that today  
  
Help me oh help me please help me my Jesus  
Save me from sins that I thought were all gone  
Kill me with kindness and break through my blindness  
I know till Im dead I can never live on  
I know till Im dead I can never live on  
  
I just need to know how to pray  
My wicked desires block the way  
Sometimes I have grieved you away  
I dont want to do that today  
  
Draw me oh draw me please draw me my Jesus
