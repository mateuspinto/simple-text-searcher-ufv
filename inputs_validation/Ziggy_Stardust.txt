Ziggy played guitar jamming good with Weird and Gilly  
And The spiders from Mars he played it left hand  
But made it too far  
Became the special man then we were Ziggys band  
  
Ziggy really sang screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo  
Like some cat from Japan he could lick em by smiling  
He could leave em to hang  
Came on so loaded man well hung and snow white tan  
  
So where were the spiders  
While the rats tried to break our balls  
Just the beer light to guide us  
So we bitched about his fans  
And should we crush his sweet hands oh  
  
Ziggy played for time jiving us that we were voodoo  
The kids were just crass he was the nazz  
With God given ass  
He took it all too far but boy could he play guitar  
  
Making love with his ego  
Ziggy sucked up into his mind  
Like a leper messiah  
When the kids had killed the man  
I had to break up the band oh  
  
Oh yeah ooooooh  
Now Ziggy played guitar
