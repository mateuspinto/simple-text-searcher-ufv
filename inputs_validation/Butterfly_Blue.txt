Butterfly Bleu  
  
I found me a little butterfly  
As blue as the sky  
With just a touch of gold  
I knew I had to hold  
My butterfly fly away with meeeeeee  
Every time I reached for her  
She managed to slip away  
Takin my breath away from me  
How can I make her stay  
My butterfly fly away with meee yeah  
My heart was beating faster  
She started to come near  
Spread her wings around me  
And cast out all my fears  
My butterfly fly away with meeeeeeeeee yeah  
Instrumental bridge and jam  
Now the bright light of her eyes show  
She never was leavin me  
Got in me by my efforts to reach her  
Leading me to be freeeee  
My butterfly fly away with me  
Yeah yeah ooooow  
Butterfly fly away
