Youre the kind of person that Ive been dreaming of  
Youre the kind of person that I always wanted to love  
And when I first seen you walk right through that bar door  
And I seen those suit and tie johns buy you one drink  
And then buy you some more I had a   
  
I know you had that crazy feeling  
Now now now youre got that crazy feeling  
You know that Ive had that crazy feeling too  
I can see it in your   
You got that crazy feeling  
Now now now now now you got that crazy feeling  
Ive had that crazy feeling too  
  
Now everybody knows that business ends at three  
And everybody knows that after hours love is free  
And you you really are a queen  
Oh such a queen such a queen  
And I know cause I made the same scene  
I know just what you mean  
Because you got that crazy feeling  
Now now now now youre got that crazy feeling  
You got that crazy feeling deep inside  
Now I can see it in your eyes  
You got that crazy feeling  
Now now now now youre got that crazy feeling  
And you got that crazy feeling too  
I feel just like feel just like you  
Crazy feeling
