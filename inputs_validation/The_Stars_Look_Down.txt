Like the fly on the wheel who says  
What a lot of dust were raising  
Are you under the illusion  
That youre part of this scheme  
Seems like a lifetime ago  
You could look with pride  
On your world of dreams  
What is the meaning of this  
And the stars look down  
What are you trying to do  
And the stars look down  
Was it something I said  
And the stars look down  
Like the rat in a maze who says  
Watch me choose my own direction  
Are you under the illusion  
The path is winding your way  
Are you surprised by confusion  
When it leads you astray  
Have you lived a lifetime today  
Or do you feel like you just got carried away  
What is the meaning of this  
And the stars look down  
What are you trying to do  
And the stars look down  
Was it something I said  
And the stars look down  
Something youd like me to do  
And the stars look down
