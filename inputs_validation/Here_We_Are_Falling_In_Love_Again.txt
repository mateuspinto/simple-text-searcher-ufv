In love so many fall but rarely do we rise in love  
We sing the saddest song  
Lamenting to ourselves how bad we feel when love goes wrong  
I know Ive been in love so many many times before  
And swore to all my friends  
That I would never never fall in love again  
  
Chorus  
And here we are falling in love again  
Whod ever believe we could  
After all the many heavy falls  
Why should it feel so good  
Here we are falling in love again  
I still cant believe its true  
Here we are falling in love  
And theres nothing we can do  
  
In dreams I often see a never ending kind of love  
That glides on golden wings  
Above the everyday affairs and ordinary things  
In love so many fall from dizzy heights of fantasy  
To find their love in flames  
So very sure that it was nothing more than just a game  
  
And here we are falling in love again  
Whod ever believe we could  
After all the many heavy falls  
Why should it feel so good  
Here we are falling in love again  
I still cant believe its true  
Here we are falling in love  
And theres nothing we can do  
  
Music  
  
And here we are falling in love again  
Whod ever believe we could  
After all the many heavy falls  
Why should it feel so good  
Here we are falling in love again  
I still cant believe its true  
Here we are falling in love  
And theres nothing we can do  
  
And here we are falling in love again  
Whod ever believe we could  
After all the many heavy falls  
Why should it feel so good  
Here we are falling in love again  
I still cant believe its true  
Here we are falling in love  
And theres nothing we can do
