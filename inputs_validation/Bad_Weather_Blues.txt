Well I been away  
I said I been away for so long  
Tell me have you  
Have you done me wrong  
Can I tell by the look thats in your eyes  
Have you kept your loving locked away inside  
Can you shake the dust from off my shoes   
Take away these bad weather blues  
I done time I got carried away  
I done laid this highclass babe out in the hay  
Spent half a year in the jailhouse all alone   
This never would have happened if Id stayed at home oh no  
Can you shake the dust from off my shoes   
Take away these bad weather blues  
Come on everybody then clap your hands in the air  
Come on a little bit louder a little bit louder  
Come on everybody Ill teach you come on  
We want to hear you louder louder  
We want you all to join in with us   
When we say yeah when we say yeah  
We want you to say yeah you got it  
Come on are you ready cant hear you  
Thats better here we go  
  
Say yeah yeah  
Say yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Can you shake the dust can you shake the dust  
Can you make me shine  
Can you shake the dust and make me shine  
Like they do in sheffield all the time  
Been everywhere around the world  
Seen every every kind of girl yeah  
But it moves me the way that I think I know  
And it weakens me so make your loving flow  
Can you shake the dust from off my shoes   
Take away these bad weather blues  
Can you shake the dust from off my shoes   
Take away these bad weather blues
