A crowd made the magic happen  
The band made the music play  
I can close my eyes and see him there  
Just like it was yesterday  
It was just another party  
Till he walked in all alone  
  
And I read the message in his eyes  
It said Honey Ill take ya home  
So I took him back to my place  
And I knew that he would stay  
And he held me and he loved me  
Till we loved the night away  
  
Chorus  
He was beautiful  
In the daylight of the morning sun  
His golden hair had come undone  
So beautiful  
He touched me with his fingertips  
He bended close I kissed his lips  
So beautiful  
  
It was easy for me to say goodbye  
Watch him walk right out the door  
Tellin myself Id forget his face  
Like all the other times before  
And I was halfway through the afternoon  
When I knew that I was wrong  
  
He was spinning around inside my head  
Like some old familiar song  
So maybe some night while the music plays  
Though I dont know where or when  
Ill be walking into some crowded room  
And Ill see his face again
