I met her at lovers park  
One rainy April Monday  
Smiling soft and warm as on  
A clear December Sunday  
Wearing taffeta and lace  
That matched her braided hair  
With their coraled beads that sang to me  
  
She said hi and asked me why  
Was I looking with sorrow  
When there were much brighter days  
In store for me tomorrow  
  
I looked up at her and smiled  
And said why I dont know  
But would she agree to stay with me  
And she said  
Never in your sun she said  
Never in your sun then she said  
I will only come  
In your pouring rain to relieve the pain  
  
So if you are at lovers park  
And someone looks with sorrow  
Ask them why are they so sad  
When sunshines theirs tomorrow  
Theyll reply they dont know why  
And ask you please to stay  
Til the end of time and when theyre fine  
  
Be kind and say  
Never in your sun just tell them  
Never in your sun then say  
I will only come  
In your pouring rain to relieve the pain never ever  
Never in your sun never in your sun believe that  
I will only come  
In your pouring rain to relieve the pain
