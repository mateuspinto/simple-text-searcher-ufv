Something told me it was over  
When I saw you and him talking  
Something deep down in my soul said Cry boy  
When I saw you and him out walking  
  
I would rather I would rather go blind girl  
Than to see you walk away from me child  
So you see I love you so much  
I dont want to see you leave me baby  
Most of all I just dont I just dont want to be free  
  
I was just I was just sitting here thinking  
Of your kiss and your warm embrace child  
When the reflection in the glass  
That I been held to my lips now baby  
  
Revealed the tears I had on my face  
I would rather I would rather be blind child  
Than to see you walk away from me  
Baby baby baby I would rather go blind  
Than to see you walk away from me
