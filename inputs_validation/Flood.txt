Here comes the water  
All I knew and all I believed  
are crumbling images  
that no longer comfort me  
I scramble to reach higher ground  
some order and sanity  
or something to comfort me  
So I take what is mine and hold what is mine  
suffocate what is mine and bury whats mine  
Soon the water will come  
and claim what is mine  
I must leave it behind  
and climb to a new place now  
This ground is not the rock I thought it to be  
Thought I was high and free  
I thought I was there  
divine destiny  
I was wrong  
This changes everything  
The water is rising up on me  
Thought the sun would come deliver me  
but the truth has come to punish me instead  
The ground is breaking down right under me  
Cleanse and purge me  
in the water
