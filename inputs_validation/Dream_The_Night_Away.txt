Its 5 oclock I think Ill find my way downtown  
I try to turn my mind off but I dont know how  
  
Let me dream the night dream the night away  
Dont make me dream the night dream the night away  
  
How can I help but hate the way I feel  
Make sense of memories that wont make them real  
  
Whoa  
  
Dream the night dream the night away  
Dream the night dream the night away  
  
Sometimes the love you make can break your heart  
Just when it seems so easy then it all falls apart  
  
I feel so helpless when I think of you  
I never said those things I thought you knew  
  
Hey  
  
Dream the night dream the night away  
Dream the night dream the night away  
  
You got to dream the night  
  
Dream the night dream the night away  
Dream the night dream the night away  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
