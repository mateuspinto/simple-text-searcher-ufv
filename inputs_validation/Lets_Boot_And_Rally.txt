Oh my my what have we done  
Guess we had a little too much fun  
But what comes down goes up again  
  
Dont you worry about me my friend  
Ill boot and rally boot and rally boot and rally boot and rally  
Ill boot and rally boot and rally boot and rally boot and rally  
  
The resist only made a mess of you  
You wrecked your car and you cracked your tooth  
Come and sing our sewer song  
Whether we get loud and we get strong  
Boot and rally boot and rally boot and rally boot and rally  
Boot and rally boot and rally boot and rally boot and rally  
  
Ah boot and rally boot and rally  
Ah boot and rally boot and rally  
  
Brother my brother my oldest friend  
Vull yourself back up again  
Dont you be no graveyard man  
Time to finish what you began  
Boot and rally boot and rally boot and rally boot and rally  
Boot and rally boot and rally boot and rally boot and rally  
Boot and rally boot and rally boot and rally boot and rally  
Boot and rally boot and rally boot and rally boot and rally  
Boot and rally boot and rally boot and rally boot and rally
