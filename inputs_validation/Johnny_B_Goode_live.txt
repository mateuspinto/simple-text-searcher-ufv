Way down Louisiana close to New Orleans  
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens  
Livin in a cottage made of earth and wood  
Lived a country boy name of Johnny B Goode  
He never ever learned to read or write so well  
But he could play the guitar just like ringing a bell  
  
Go go  
Go Johnny go go  
Go Johnny go go  
Go Johnny go go  
Go Johnny go go  
Johnny B Goode  
  
He use to carry his guitar in a gunny sack  
And sit beneath the trees by the railroad track  
Oh strummin his guitar in the gentle shade  
Playing to the music that the drivers made  
People passing by theyd stop and say  
Oh my that little country boy could play  
  
Go go  
Go Johnny go go  
Go Johnny go go  
Go Johnny go go  
Go Johnny go go  
Johnny B Goode  
  
His mama told him someday you will be a man  
And you will be the leader of a big old band  
All kinds a people coming from miles around  
To hear ya play ya guitar till the sun go down  
Maybe someday your name will be in lights  
Saying Johnny B Goode tonight  
  
Go go  
Go Johnny go go  
Go Johnny go go  
Go Johnny go go  
Go Johnny go go  
Johnny B Goode
