Well if I get to heaven before you do  
I will meet you at the station when your train comes along  
Ill be watching and waiting Mother dear for you  
I will meet you at the station when your train comes along  
  
Chorus   
Father when the train  
Father when the train  
Meet me at the station when the train comes along  
When the train  
Father when the train comes along  
I will meet you at the station when your train comes along  
  
Well if my eyes see the glory before yours do  
I will meet you at the station when your train comes along  
Ill be watching and waiting Father for you  
I will meet you at the station when your train comes along  
  
Chorus   
  
Now if my feet touch the home line before yours do  
I will meet you at the station when the train comes along  
Ill be watching and waiting my brother for you  
I will meet you at the station when the train comes along  
  
Repeat 2X  
When the train  
When the train  
Meet me at the station when the train comes along  
When the train  
When the train comes along  
Meet me at the station when the train comes along  
  
Now if you see Gods country before I do  
Will you meet me at the station when my train comes along  
Will you be there watching sister for me  
Will you meet
