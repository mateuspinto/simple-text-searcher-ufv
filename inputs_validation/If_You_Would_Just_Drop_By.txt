Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
Friends I used to know are coming by  
To ask me if my situations high  
Cause sometimes I just stare at the sky  
Up is down before Her crown I cry  
CHORUS  
If you would just drop by sometime  
If you would just drop by  
If you can possible make it up sometime  
I can be there if I try  
The world world keeps spinnin me round  
Bringing me up and bringing me down  
But I cant get there with my feet on the ground  
Maybe I oughta start digging a hole around my feet on the ground  
CHORUS  
You know once in while as I sit and stare  
I get the feeling that theres no one there  
Look at me now as I roll off my chair  
How did I know that a chair could be out where I stare  
CHORUS
