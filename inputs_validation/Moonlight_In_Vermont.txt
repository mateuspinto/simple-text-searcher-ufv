Pennies in a stream  
Falling leaves a sycamore  
Moonlight in Vermont  
  
Icy fingerwaves  
Ski trails on a mountainside  
Snowlight in Vermont  
  
Telegraph cables they sing down the highway  
And travel each bend in the road  
People who meet in this romantic setting  
Are so hypnotized by the lovely  
  
Evening summer breeze  
Warbling of a meadowlark  
Moonlight in Vermont  
  
  
Telegraph cables how they sing down the highway  
And they travel each bend in the road  
People who meet in this romantic setting  
Are so hypnotized by the lovely  
  
Evening summer breeze  
The warbling of a meadowlark  
Moonlight in Vermont  
You and I and Moonlight in Vermont
