You spoke the words and all the worlds came into order  
You waved your hands and planets filled the empty skies  
You placed the woman and the man inside the garden  
And though they fell they found compassion in your eyes  
  
Bridge  
Oh Lord I stand amazed at the wonder of it all  
And yet a greater wonder brings me to my knees  
  
Chorus  
Lord I praise you because of who you are  
Not for all the mighty deeds that you have done  
Lord I worship you because of who you are  
Its all the reason that I need to voice my praise  
Because of who you are  
  
One holy night you sent your promise from a virgin  
And promise grew as you revealed to us your heart  
Enduring love displayed through out your crucifixion  
And in your death you tore the darkened grave apart  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus 2x
