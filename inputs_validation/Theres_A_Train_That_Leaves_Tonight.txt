Like a jazz refrain the midnight train is callin  
Hey youd best go soon the late night moon is fallin  
Let the nightbirds whisper to themselves  
This train pulls out at twelve  
High tides breakin on the shores church bell tolls  
Chorus  
Theres a train that leaves tonight  
I might just ride on  
Nothin here that makes me wanna stay  
Theres a train that leaves tonight  
I might just ride away  
I just cant hope to tell you bout the stillness and the quiet  
bout the frozen fields so lonely and the train songs in the night  
About the sounds of nothin moving night fields all aglow  
I simply got to leave you my heart cries out to go  
Chorus
