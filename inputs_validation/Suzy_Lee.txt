Theres a story  
I would like to tell  
My problem is  
Its one you know too well  
Its one you know too well  
  
Miss Suzy lee  
The one Im speaking of  
The question is  
Is she the one I love  
Is she the one I love  
Alright  
Is she the one I love  
Is she the one I love  
  
She sent me flowers  
With her tears burned inside  
And you know what Id do  
I would run and hide  
I would run and hide  
  
And the paper  
On it was my name  
With the question  
Do you feel the same  
Do you feel the same  
Alright  
  
To end this tale  
The one Im speaking of  
I wish I had an answer but I just dont know  
Is this really love  
Is this really love  
Is this really love  
Is this really love
