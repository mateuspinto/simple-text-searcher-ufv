If you want a fancy fan  
Or a turkey born in turkeystan  
Or a slave thats awflly african  
Or a teapot early ming  
Come to the supermarket in old peking  
  
If you want to buy a kite  
Or a pup to keep you up at night  
Or a dwarf who used to know snow white  
Or a frog who loves to sing  
Come to the supermarket in old peking  
  
They have sunfloware cakes moonbeam cakes  
Gizzard cakes lizard cakes  
Pickled eels pickle snakes  
Fit for any king  
  
If you want a bust of jade  
Or an egg thats more or less decayed  
Or in case you care to meet a maid  
For a nice but naughty fling  
  
Come to the supermarket  
If you come on an ostrich you can park it  
So come to the supermarket  
And see pe

If you want a gong to beat  
Or a rickshaw with a sassy seat  
Or a painting slightly indiscreet  
That is simply riveting  
Come to the supermarket and see peking  
  
Well if you want some calico  
Or a gentle water buffalo  
Glow worm guaranteed to glow  
Or a cloak inclined to cling  
Come to the supermarket in old peking  
  
They have birdsnest soup seaweed soup  
Noodle soup poodle soup  
Talking crows with the croup  
Almost anything  
  
If you want to buy a saw  
Or a fish delicious when its raw  
Or a pill to kill your mothareinlaw  
Or a bee without a sting

If you come on a turtle you can park it  
So come to the supermarket  
If you come on a goose you can park it  
So come to the supermarket  
And see
