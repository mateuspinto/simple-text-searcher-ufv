Deep in a land made of mans toil and trouble where I fight for my life  
Ive found an island of refuge to run to to escape from the strife  
When tempters arise to destroy me  
When life is much more than one heart can take  
There is someone who protects me  
  
Living under your wings of love  
Safe in the arms of the mighty God  
Living under your wings of love  
Safe in the arms of the mighty God  
  
Oh  
Oh ooh  
  
Captive by choice of the strength that surrounds me  I just cant walk
away  
I hear your voice say how much you love me how you want me to stay  
Warmed by the breath of your Spirit I rest my head on your pillow  
Covered where nothing can harm me  
  
Living under your wings of love living under  
Safe in the arms of the mighty God  
Living under your wings of love living under  
Safe in the arms of the mighty God  
Oh living under your wings of love  
  
No more living alone  
No more fear of the night  
Forever I will make my home
