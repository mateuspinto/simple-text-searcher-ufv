  
Oh the happiest Christmas  
Is a homecoming Christmas  
With the snow fluttering down til the world seems new  
chorus  
Bright candles burning  
Old friends returning  
The wishes of children coming true  
And the happiest wishes are just old fashioned wishes  
May your days be merry your sorrows be small  
May the ones you love be near you  
Thats the happiest Christmas of all  
repeat chorus
