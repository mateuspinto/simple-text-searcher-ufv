Dont ya love her madly  
Dont ya need her badly  
Dont ya love her ways  
Tell me what you say  
  
Dont ya love her madly  
Want to be her daddy  
Dont ya love her face  
Dont ya love her as shes walkin out the door  
  
Like she did one thousand times before  
Dont ya love her ways  
Tell me what you say  
Dont ya love her as shes walkin out the door  
  
All your love  
All your love  
All your love  
All your love  
All your love is gone  
  
So sing a lonely song  
Of a deep blue dream  
Seven horses seem to be on the mark  
Yeah dont you love her  
Dont you love her as shes walkin out the door  
  
All your love  
All your love  
All your love  
Yeah all your love is gone  
  
So sing a lonely song  
Of a deep blue dream  
Seven horses seem to be on the mark  
Well dont ya love her madly  
Dont ya love her madly  
Dont ya love her madly
