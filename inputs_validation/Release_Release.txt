Have you heard before hit it out dont look back  
Rock is the medium of our generation  
Stand for every right kick it out hear you shout  
For the right of all of creation  
  
Weve heard before but we just dont seem to move  
The pressures on is there lack of concentration  
  
Power defy our needs lift us up show us now  
Show us how amid the rack of confusion  
Drive in thoughts of high satisfy in a plan  
Set it out for all to understand it  
  
Weve heard before but we just dont seem to move  
The pressures on is there lack of concentraion  
  
Lost and wondering maybe how it is  
Seems to me its as simple as this  
No matter where you go youre going to find  
You wont see me in front but you cant leave me behind  
  
Power at first to the needs of each others days  
Simple to lose in the void sounds of anarchys calling ways  
All unaccounted for in the craziness of power  
In the craziness  
Release all release all or abandon your hope for your brother  
Release all release all or abandon your hope for your sister  
Release release enough controllers  
Show some signs of appreciated loyalties  
Release release enough controllers  
Show some signs of appreciated loyalties  
  
Straight jacket freedoms march is it all far beyond  
Our reason of understanding  
Campaign everything antiright antileft  
Anticipate the love of creation  
  
Stand for every right  
Kick it out hear you shout  
Further the right  
Further the right  
Further the right  
Of all of creation  
  
Power at first to the needs of each others days  
Simple to lose in the void sounds of anarchys calling ways  
All unaccounted for in the craziness of power  
In the craziness  
Release all release all or abandon your hope for your brother  
Release all release all or abandon your hope for your sister  
Release release  
Release release  
Release release  
Release release
