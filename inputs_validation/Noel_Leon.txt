Leon Dixon leaves his Christmas lights up all year round  
Its somethin different about our town  
Weve often wondered why he never takes em down  
But Leon leaves his Christmas lights up all year round  
Theres a big bright noel flashin off and on  
In the yard where the children play the whole year long  
Weve all gotten used to it year by year  
Now its kinda gotten to be a part of things round here  
  
Chorus  
Peace on earth Good will to men  
Christmas time is here again  
Can it be all that wrong  
To feel like Christmas all year long  
  
Leon got sick its been back awhile  
Short on luck and money but he still wore that smile  
And nobody could stand to see him do without  
So we all drove over to see if we could help out  
Yeah the noel flashed on and the bills stayed paid  
I felt so warm as we drove away  
I had never seen Christmas spelled so clear  
As when I saw LEON flashin in my rear view mirror  
  
Chorus
