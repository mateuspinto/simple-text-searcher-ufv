Well here it comes again  
That old feelin so strong  
You came into my life  
I won your love for a song  
And when I see you in my mind baby  
Think of the words you will say  
And in a mist of desire  
Your love takes me away  
  
Girl you take me away  
In a mist of desire  
And our loves not an ember baby  
Its a raging fire  
I need to be with you  
What else can I say  
In a mist of desire  
Your love takes me away  
  
I feel the love when we touch  
I can see it in your face  
I get lost in the shadows of your warm embrace  
And you rush into my arms  
My emotions run wild  
And were off to a love world  
In a mist of desire  
  
Girl you take me away  
In a mist of desire  
And our loves not an ember baby  
Its a raging fire  
I need to be with you  
What else can I say  
In a mist of desire  
Your love takes me away  
  
In a mist of desire  
Your love takes me away
