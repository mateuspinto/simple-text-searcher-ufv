If I knew then what I know now  
  
Well hello girl tell me how have you been  
By the way Ill never make the same mistake again  
And you know girl its been a long hard time  
Nothing like back when you were mine  
  
And if I knew then what I know now  
Id have found the way  
To make things work out somehow  
Id have held you tight  
Id have treated you right  
If I knew then what I know now  
  
Its a crazy world for a boy and a girl  
Harder than it is for a woman and a man  
Oh it was easy then just to push you away  
Guess I never knew how I feel today  
  
If we knew then  
  
You know I do things differently  
If you ever come back to me  
If we could just go back in time  
Theres no broken heart  
Girl were at the start this time
