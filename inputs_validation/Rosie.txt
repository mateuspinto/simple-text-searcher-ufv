She was standing at the loadin  
When the trucks rolled up  
She was sniffin all around  
Like a halfgrown female pup  
She wasnt hard to talk to  
Looked like she had nowhere to go  
So I gave her a pass  
So she could get in and see the show  
Well I sat her down right next to me  
And I got her a beer  
While I mixed that sound on the stage  
So the band could hear  
The more I watched her watch them play  
The less I thought of to say  
And when they walked off stage  
You know the drummer swept that girl away  
  
But Rosie youre all right  
You wear my ring  
When you hold me tight  
Rosie thats my thing  
When you turn out the light  
I got to hand it to me  
Looks like its me and you again tonight Rosie  
  
Well I guess I might have known from the start  
Shed come for a star  
Well I told my imagination not to run too far  
Of all the times that Ive been burned  
By now you think Idve learned  
That its who you look like  
Not who you are  
You all keep that in mind  
  
Rosie youre all right  
You wear my ring  
When you hold me tight  
Rosie thats my thing  
When you turn out the light  
I got to hand it to me  
It looks like its me and you again tonight Rosie  
It looks like its me and you again tonight  
It looks like its me and you again tonight Rosie  
Rosie Rosie Rosie Rosie
