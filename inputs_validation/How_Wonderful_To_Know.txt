How wonderful to know you really love me  
How wonderful to know you really care  
How beautiful to feel my arms around you  
  
Kissing your eyes  
Hearing your sighs  
Touching your hair  
  
How wonderful to know sunshine and laughter  
That fills my empty heart with love divine  
To share this life with you now and hereafter  
  
How wonderful to know that you are mine  
To share this life with you now and hereafter  
How wonderful to know that you are mine
