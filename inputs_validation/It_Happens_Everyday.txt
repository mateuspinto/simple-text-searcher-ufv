It happens everyday  
Two lovers with the best intentions to stay  
Together they decide to separate  
Just how it happens neither is certain  
But it happens everyday  
  
It happens everyday  
After you break up you say these words to your friends  
How could I have loved that boy  
He was so bad to me in the end  
Well you make him a liar  
Turn him into a robber  
Well it happens everyday  
  
But I dont regret that I loved you  
How I loved you I will never forget  
And in time Ill look back and remember  
The boy that I knew when we first met  
  
Still it happens everyday  
Two lovers turn and twist their love into hate  
But am I so different from that young girl you used to date  
You used to adore me  
You used to adore me  
Still it happens everyday  
  
Whoooohoohoohoohoohooh  
Everyday yeah yeah yeah
