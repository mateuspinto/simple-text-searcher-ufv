Sounds of laughter here comes sunshine smiling faces all around  
They possess you bless you sunshine now you can never let them down I say
sunshine  
  
Sunshine sunshine is that a cloud across your smile or did you dream again
last night  
Its best you rest inside a while as blue doesnt seem to suit you right  
  
Things aint what they used to be pain and rain and misery  
Illness in the family and sunshine means a lot to me I say sunshine  
  
But could it be Sunshine is drifting with midnight and lonely when everyones
gone  
Blue crystal spirits and gardens in moonlight  
Leave weak alone and bleak all quiet and grey by dawn  
  
Sunshine sunshine rising to late to chase the cold and failing to change the
frost to dew  
Shes trading her mood of yellow gold for frost bitten shades of silverblue  
  
Friends and lovers past and gone and no one waiting further on  
Im running short of things to be and sunshine means quiet a lot to me I say
sunshine  
Sunshine sunshine
