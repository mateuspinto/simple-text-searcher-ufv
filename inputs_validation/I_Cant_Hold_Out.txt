I just talked to my baby  on the telephone  
She said stop what your doing and  come on home  
I cant hold out I cant hold out to long  
I get a real good feeling  talking to you on the phone  
  
She said daddy you know I love you your my hearts desire um  
Stay right here with you till the day I die  
I cant hold out I cant hold out to long  
I get a real good feeling  talking to you on the phone  
Oh yeah  
  
She daddy you can run walk or fly  
Stay right here with you til the day I die  
I cant hold out I cant hold out to long  
I get a real good feeling talking to you on the phone  
  
Whoa yeah talk a to me baby  
Talk a to me baby  
Talk to me baby  
Talk a to me baby  
I get a real good feeling  talking to you on the phone
