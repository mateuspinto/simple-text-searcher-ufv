I made myself a promise sometime ago  
Never again to give my heart away  
Fell in love with someone who left me in the end  
The price of love was just too high to pay  
I thought my life had ended but you came along  
And showed me how much brighter things could be  
Now you see Ive turned my back on that promise that I made  
Knowing that your love has set me free  
Cause you were reason enough for me to go on living  
You were reason enough for me to smile again  
In a world where hearts were broken every now and then  
One finds reason enough to love  
Liked Ive found reason enough in you to love again  
So here I am all caught up in this new found love  
Feeling like Ive never felt before  
Putting my love on the line with you  
Taking a chance again  
Im not afraid to love anymore  
Cause you were reason enough for me to go on living  
You were reason enough for me to smile again  
In a world where hearts were broken every now and then  
One finds reason enough to love  
Liked Ive found reason enough in you to love again  
Cause you were reason enough for me to go on living  
You were reason enough for me to smile again  
In a world where hearts were broken every now and then  
One finds reason enough to love  
Liked Ive found reason enough in you to love again  
In a world where hearts are broken every now and then  
One finds reason enough to love  
Liked Ive found reason enough in you to love again
