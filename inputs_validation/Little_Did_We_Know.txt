Little did we know the day we said hello  
That youd be the one for me  
Little did we dream our hearts would play a theme  
That soon was a symphony  
Little did we know one sweet caress  
Would lead the way to happiness  
Yes little did we know the love wed share  
That now wed know how much we care  
Little did we guess one sweet caress  
Would lead the way to happiness  
Yes little did we know the love wed share  
But now we know how much we care
