Everybody knows that the grass is close to the ground  
Fifteen unces and a half are close to a pound  
Everybody knows that the leaves are close to the tree  
But theres yet to be for them to see  
Things as close together as you and me  
  
Everybody knows Niagara is close to the Falls  
And the fact is known that windows are close to the walls  
Everybody knows that Nashville is close to Tennessee  
But theres yet to be for them to see  
Things as close together as you and me  
  
Grass will wilt when you pull it from the ground  
Youll lose weight when you take away a pound  
Leaves will die when you chop down the tree  
Like I would if you would taken from me  
  
Niagara wouldnt be seen without Falls  
Windows wouldnt be broke without walls  
Nashvilles in Tennessee  
And love will always be in you and and me  
  
Everybody knows that freight trains are close to the track  
And the truth is known that shoe soles are close to the tracks  
Everybody knows that the sea shores are close to the sea  
But theres yet to be for them to see  
Things as close together as you and me  
  
Oh things as close together as you and me
