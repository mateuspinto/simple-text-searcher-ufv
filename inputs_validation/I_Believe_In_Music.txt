I believe in music  
I believe in love love love  
I believe in music  
I believe in love  
  
Well I can just sit around makin music all day long  
Long as Im makin music I cant do nobody no wrong  
And who knows maybe someday Ill come up with a song  
That makes people want to stop their fussin an fightin  
Long enough to sing along  
  
I believe in music  
I believe in love     
I believe in music  
I believe in love  
  
Music is love love is music if you know what I mean  
People who believe in music are the happiest people Ive ever seen  
So clap your hands an stomp your feet shake your tambourine  
 Lift your voices to the sky  God loves you when you sing  
  
I believe in music  
I believe in love     
I believe in music  
I believe in love  
  
Music is the universal language and love is the key  
To brotherhood an peace an understandin to live in harmony  
So take your brothers by the hand and sing along with me  
Find out what it really means to be young rich an free  
  
I believe in music  
I believe in love     
I believe in music  
I believe in love  
  
I believe in music  
I believe in love     
I believe in music  
I believe in love  
I believe in music  
I believe in love
