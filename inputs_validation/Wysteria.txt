Wysteria did you change your face again  
Those of us who loved you when  
Cant even find you  
Wysteria did you lose another man  
Did you make him understand  
That he cant touch you  
  
Wysteria did he take you to the fair  
Were the folks that you met there  
The same that we met  
Wysteria did he teach you how to dance  
Did he bring you paper fans to hide your secret  
Was he just like all the rest  
When he got to the sad part  
Did he stay a bit too long  
To save his heart  
  
Wysteria are your lips still lily white  
Do they still bloom just  
At night and die at sunrise
