Blackness awakens visions come alive  
Seeing through darkness with borrowed eyes  
  
Death survivor take me higher  
Reunite my soul  
Whisperer of truth I trust in you  
To make me whole  
  
Sun come shine my way  
Make healing waters bury all my pain  
Wind carry me home  
The fabric of reality is tearing apart  
The piece of me that died  
Will return to live again  
  
Feeling myself slip away  
Silently dreaming awake  
Hidden memories flooding back  
I will not grow in the light  
Until I pass through the darkest caverns  
Of my heart  
  
Dance with fire spirit guide  
Erase the world outside  
Messenger of truth I trust in you  
Transform me now  
  
Sun come shine my way  
Make healing waters bury all my pain  
Wind carry me home  
The fabric of reality is tearing apart  
The piece of me that died  
Will return to live again  
And at last the time has come  
To unite again as one  
To the power of the earth Im calling  
Crossing bridges in the sky  
On a journey to renew my life  
Shaman take my hand  
  
Sun come shine my way  
Make healing waters bury all my pain  
Wind carry me home  
The fabric of reality is tearing apart  
The piece of me that died  
Will return to live again  
And at last the time has come  
To unite again as one  
To the power of the earth Im calling  
Crossing bridges in the sky  
On a journey to renew my life  
Shaman take my hand
