Underneath a winter sky  
A distant train sings out the miles  
And so I wonder can it be  
Will every mile bring you to me  
  
A promise made may still come true  
So I am waiting here for you  
If you dont come what will I do  
Who shall I tell my secrets to  
  
Christmas bells ring out their chimes  
I hear them echo through the night  
And moonlight shines upon the road  
And trembles on the falling snow  
  
I look into the midnight blue  
So many stars I never knew  
If you dont come what will I do  
Who shall I tell my secrets to  
  
I look into the midnight blue  
So many stars I never knew  
If you dont come what will I do  
Who shall I tell my secrets to
