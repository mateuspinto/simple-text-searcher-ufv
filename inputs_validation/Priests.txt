And who will write love songs for you  
When I am lord at last  
And your body is some little highway shrine  
That all my priests have passed  
That all my priests have passed  
  
My priests they will put flowers there  
They will stand before the glass  
But theyll wear away your little window love  
They will trample on the grass  
They will trample on the grass  
  
And who will aim the arrow  
That men will follow through your grace  
When I am lord of memory  
And all your armour has turned to lace  
And all your armour has turned to lace  
  
The simple life of heroes  
And the twisted life of saints  
They just confuse the sunny calendar  
With their red and golden paints  
With their red and golden paints  
  
And all of you have seen the dance  
That God has kept from me  
But he has seen me watching you  
When all your minds were free  
When all your minds were free  
  
And who will write love songs for you   
  
My priests they will put flowers there
