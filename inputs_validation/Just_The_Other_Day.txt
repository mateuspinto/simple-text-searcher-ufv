Just the other day  
I heard you walked out on her  
Just the other day  
I heard its not forever  
You say anyway  
You said its not like before  
Just the other day  
Did she let you go  
Did she let you go  
Just the other day  
You lost the girl you adored  
Just the other day  
You boyish love was the cause  
Did she cost you pain  
You could have held out for more  
Just the other day  
Did she let you go  
Did she let you go  
I see your walking alone  
Will you still talk to me  
If shes not by your side anymore
