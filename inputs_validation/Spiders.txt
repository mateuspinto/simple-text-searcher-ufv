The piercing radiant moon  
The storming of poor June  
All the life running through her hair  
  
Approaching guiding light  
Our shallow years in fright  
Dreams are made winding through my head  
  
Through my head  
Before you know Awake  
  
Your lives are open wide  
The Vchip gives them sight  
All the life running through her hair  
  
The spiders all in tune  
The evening of the moon  
Dreams are made winding through my head  
  
Through my head  
Before you know Awake  
  
Through my head  
Through my head  
Before you know  
Before you know I will be waiting all awake  
  
Dreams are made winding through her hair  
Dreams are made winding through her hair
