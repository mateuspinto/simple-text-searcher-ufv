Your world always seemed so far away  
My words are bouncing against your shield  
They say time will heal all wounds  
But I cant bleed forever  
  
I want to live  
I want to breathe  
I want to live forever  
  
Please spare us your selfpity  
Its tedious enough  
The stack of empathy  
Has long ago run out  
  
I hold no regrets of what has been done  
I dont need the memories of a haunted man  
It sickens me to feel this way  
But I cant bleed forever  
I want to live  
I want to breathe  
I want to live forever
