Sometimes I think it would be better  
If you just walked away  
And stopped returning phone calls  
Come out to see the band play  
  
Lady Leave me I will love you more  
Sometimes I only speak when  
Im ignored  
  
Big fish little fish dont swim back to me  
Eww eww eww eww  
Circle my ship and slip back into the sea  
Eww eww eww eww  
Im sending out a  
Warning cause I think you oughta know  
If catching you is easy then Im gonna have to let you go  
  
Sometimes I wish you wouldnt smile  
Every time I come around  
And pick me up so easily  
Every time I let you down  
  
And baby  
Make me  
Crazy  
If you can  
  
Miscommunicate to make me  
Understand  
  
Big fish little fish dont swim back to me  
Eww eww eww eww  
Circle my ship and slip back into the sea  
Eww eww eww eww  
Im sending out a  
Warning cause I think you oughta know  
If catching you is easy then Im gonna have to to let you go  
  
Let you go home  
I can swim like a stone again  
  
Big fish little fish dont swim back to me  
Eww eww eww eww  
Circle my ship and slip back into the sea  
Eww eww eww eww  
Big fish little fish dont swim back to me  
Big fish little fish dont swim back to me  
Big fish little fish dont swim back to me
