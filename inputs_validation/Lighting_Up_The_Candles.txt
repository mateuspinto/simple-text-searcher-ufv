Lighting up the candles lighting up our love  
Lighting up the candles lighting up our love  
  
Lighting up the candles  
To what use to be  
Tender memories in moments of love  
Happy times and bad times  
All seem wonderful  
When you have a toast to moments of love  
Lighting up the candles lighting up our love  
  
Lighting up the candles  
To what use to be  
Tender memories in moments of love  
Happy times and bad times  
All seem wonderful  
When you have a toast to moments of love  
  
I really think we could have made it  
To that forever and a day  
But destiny and fate decided  
They would get in our way  
  
Lighting up the candles  
Wishing you the best  
Like the happiness in moments of love  
For lighting up the candles  
Spark the memories  
Helping us to see more moments of love  
  
I really think we could have made it  
To that forever and a day  
But destiny and fate decided  
They would get in our way  
  
For lighting up the candles  
Spark the memories  
Helping us to see the need for what was  
Helping us to see more moments of love  
  
Lighting up the candles lighting up our love  
Lighting up the candles lighting up our love  
Lighting up the candles lighting up our love
