Bad fog of loneliness  
Put a cloud  
On my singlemindedness  
I dream of sweet caress  
From you  
  
What makes tomorrow guess  
What makes me take from me  
And put aside the rest  
I dream of sweet caress  
From you  
  
So long woman I am gone  
So much pain to go through  
Come back maybe I was wrong  
  
Bad fog of loneliness  
Put a cloud  
On my singlemindedness  
I dream of sweet caress  
From you
