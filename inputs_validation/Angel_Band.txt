By Michael Nesmith  
My latest sun is sinking fast  
My race is nearly run  
My strongest trials now have passed  
My triumph is begun  
Oh come angel band  
Come and around me stand  
Oh bear me away on your snowwhite wings  
To my immortal home  
Oh bear me away on your snowwhite wings  
To my immortal home  
Oh bear my longing heart to Him  
Who bled and died for me  
Whose blood now cleanses from all sin  
And brings me victory  
Oh come angel band  
Come and around me stand  
Oh bear me away on your snowwhite wings  
To my immortal home  
Oh bear me away on your snowwhite wings  
To my immortal home  
Oh come angel band  
Come and around me stand  
Oh bear me away on your snowwhite wings  
To my immortal home  
Oh bear me away on your snowwhite wings  
To my immortal home  
Oh come angel band  
Come and around me stand  
Oh bear me away on your snowwhite wings  
To my immortal home  
Oh bear me away on your snowwhite wings  
To my immortal home  
Fade out
