I will endure  
It will endure in me  
Until the end forever  
I will endure  
If we continue in these ways  
Rebellion bends towards hatred  
We rise up for our cause  
And forsake the outsiders  
Where is this love this understanding  
Who will stand  
What will break down  
If this uprise of self is left to reign This has chose for a standard to
uphold  
An answer for the questions  
Wavering of beliefs lead to destruction  
Nothing remains constant to to its origin  
But the unchanging faith of Christ  
The One stable since since creation  
Thoughts have come and theories have gone  
Nothing has lasted through through the resistance  
But can deny who can dispute  
The faith thats been throughout  
Since the foundation of the beginning  
It has always been and will always be  
Forever  
It has been proven it shall remain  
This faith has stood the test  
It persists through the conflict  
Through the revolt against its ways  
Nothing has held true like this  
No other has revealed such strength  
The roots deep within  
Entangling around my Rock  
Never letting go of this truth  
The power that sustained  
I will endure in what I believe and what I believe  
Will endure in me
