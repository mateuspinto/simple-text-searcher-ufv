Grandpa tell me bout the good old days  
Sometimes it feels like this worlds gone crazy  
Grandpa take me back to yesterday  
When the line between right and wrong  
Didnt seem so hazy  
  
Chorus  
  
Did lovers really fall in love to stay  
And stand beside each other come what may  
Was a promise really something people kept  
Not just something they would say  
Did families really bow their heads to pray  
Did daddies really never go away  
Oh grandpa tell me bout the good old days  
  
Grandpa everything is changing fast  
We call it progress but I just dont know  
And grandpa lets wander back into the past  
And paint me the picture of long ago  
  
Did lovers really fall in love to stay  
And stand beside each other come what may  
Was a promise really something people kept  
Not just something they would say and then forget  
Did families really bow their heads to pray  
Did daddies really never go away  
Oh grandpa tell me bout the good old days  
Oh grandpa tell me bout the good old days
