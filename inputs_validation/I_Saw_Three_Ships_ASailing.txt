I saw three ships come sailing in  
On Christmas day on Christmas day  
I saw three ships come sailing in  
On Christmas day in the morning  
  
And what was in those ships all three  
On Christmas day on Christmas day  
And what was in those ships all three  
On Christmas day in the morning  
  
Our Saviour Christ and His Lady  
On Christmas day on Christmas day  
Our Saviour Christ and His Lady  
On Christmas day in the morning  
  
And all the bells on earth shall ring  
On Christmas day on Christmas day  
And all the bells on earth shall ring  
On Christmas day in the morning  
  
And all the angels in Heaven shall sing  
On Christmas day on Christmas day  
And all the angels in Heaven shall sing  
On Christmas day in the morning  
  
And let us all rejoice and sing  
On Christmas day on Christmas day  
And let us all rejoice and sing  
On Christmas day in the morning  
On Christmas day in the morning  
  
La da la la la la la la
