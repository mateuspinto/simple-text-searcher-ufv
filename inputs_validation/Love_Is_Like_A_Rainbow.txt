When I Look Into Your Eyes  I Can See A Part Of Heaven  
Never Felt Like This Before  In My Life  
Love Shines In Many Colors  Love Is Shining For Us  
Believe Me  That My Love Is Real  
  
Love Will Lift You Up And And Let You Down  
The Light Behind The Shadow Will Tell You  
That I Will Never Go  
If You See A Rainbow In The Sky  
I Will Promise That Youll Never Cry  Again  
Those Tears From Heaven  
  
Every Hour And Every Minute  
I Will Touch You And I Will Feel It  
Always Looking For Someone Like You In My Life  
I Cover You With Sunlight  
I Will Take Your Hand And Hold You Tight  
If Raindrops  Will Darken The Sky
