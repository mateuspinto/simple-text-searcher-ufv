Whitey  
Oh they day cant begin  
Till the gard lets me in  
Then I walk for some exersise  
  
In less then a snap  
I complete my daily lap  
Then its time to socilize  
  
I see Raidy and Ruth  
At the Information Booth  
Have rigged the hearing lady  
At Ben and Jerrys Shake  
  
Then I go to Pet Land  
Where the manager stands  
Has about to be the dangorous stake  
  
Then I pass the tie rack  
On my way to Radioshack  
Where I pretent to be a Hollywood Star  
I try to walk like John Wayne  
While singing in the rain  
And the Janitor laughs all the time  
  
A little bit later  
All the flash and the painter  
Was so high I had to close my eyes  
  
Janitor  
He takes his 11 30 crap  
  
Whitey  
Then go over to the Gap  
And try clothes on for kids my size  
  
You want to go to Panda Express  
Their spicey Chicken is the best  
Go to Instant Barrel for a medium drink  
Cause their staff is really nice  
And they only use cubed ice  
Which is better then chushed I think  
  
Bangle lesson nothing sees   
Look for chocolate heriings   
Cuz he les me take a quich cat nap  
He says he misses his daughter  
Puts my hand in warm water  
And I wake up with a wet yellow lap  
  
Footlocker is my last stop  
Where I have to go and shop  
For some clean passings couples at a nice price  
  
Cuz when I leave the mall  
I reff Youth League basketball  
And to look your best Never hurts  
But the greatest thing of all  
If the truth be told  
Here at the mall its never too hot or cold  
Cuz they were smart enough to make it truckin tall  
 At the mall at the mall at the mall
