Does the light of passion still burn bright  
Only love would know my imagination  
Tells me Im a pentup fool in the deep end of the pool  
Is the light of passion burnin tonight  
Only love would know only love would know  
She lives on the other side you wanna know the reason why  
She arrives at promises and you believe in what she says  
Everywhere you go  
Is the light of passion burnin bright  
Everywhere you go only love would know  
You think youve been wronged again  
Oh what a way to treat a friend  
She belongs to other eyes and surely you must realize  
She aint the kind who would soon step aside  
Pay any dues at the expense of her pride  
Everywhere she goes only love would know  
In the days gone by I came to believe  
Everything is trust all the rest is dust  
Mother nature mother dear listen to us over here  
Are the sounds of laughter ringing true  
Only love would know only love would do  
She lives on another plane away from the drivin rain  
She says no you say yes  
And thats how it should be I guess  
Only love would know  
May the light of love surround you tonight  
Everywhere you go only love would know  
You think you were wrong until  
You learned once and for all its still  
One more lesson on the way  
Or that is what it seemed to say  
Shes not the kind who would soon step down  
Not the kind you would try to walk around  
When only a thought would go very well  
You can tell by the touch  
Ah but only love would know  
Passion burnin bright  
Tears of passion late at night  
Is the light of passion burning bright  
Everywhere you go only love would know
