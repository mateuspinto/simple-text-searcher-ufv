You hid your skeletons when I had shown you mine  
You woke the devil that I thought youd left behind  
I saw the evidence the crimson soaking through  
Ten thousand promises ten thousand ways to lose  
  
And you held it all but you were careless to let it fall  
You held it all and I was by your side powerless  
  
I watched you fall apart and chased you to the end  
Im left with emptiness that words can not defend  
Youll never know what I became because of you  
Ten thousand promises ten thousand ways to lose  
  
And you held it all but you were careless to let it fall  
You held it all and I was by your side powerless  
  
And you held it all but you were careless to let it fall  
You held it all and I was by your side powerless  
  
Powerless  
Powerless
