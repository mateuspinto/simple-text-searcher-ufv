Tiran porter  
Well Ive had some thought in a loving direction  
I want to be the part of someone affection  
Been alone too long my head hangin low  
Theres no one to see and no place to go  
Need a lady  
Drive me crazy  
Come with me and surely well be free  
I walk the streets in the dead of night  
Wishing for some lovin arms to hold me tight  
But its always down to my old guitar  
Thats all that keeps me from the bars  
I need a need a lady  
Need a lady  
Like the lady from tennessee
