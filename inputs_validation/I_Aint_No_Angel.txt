I told my baby girl  
That I live by all the rules  
She laughed and said to me  
Dont you take me for a fool  
Then she ran me down  
People saw me over town  
Then word got back to her  
That I was fooling round  
  
Chorus  
I I aint no angel  
I I aint no angel  
So good goodbye love  
Good goodbye love  
  
Now Im living on my own  
Since my baby set me free  
Seems I hurt her pride  
And caused her misery  
She never understands  
To keep me satisfied  
I got to live this life  
The only way I can  
  
Chorus  
  
All right then come on  
  
Chorus  
  
Now they say there is no doubt  
That the question in their minds  
That Ill be down and out  
And the days Ill never find  
But youll never understand  
To keep me satisfied  
I got to live my life  
The only way I can  
  
Chorus
