Blue Jean I just met me a girl named Blue Jean  
Blue Jean she got a camouflaged face and no money  
Remember they always let you down when you need em  
Oh Blue Jean is heaven any sweeter than Blue Jean  
She got a police bike  
She got a turned up nose  
  
Sometimes I feel like  
Oh the whole human race  
Jazzin for Blue Jean  
Oh and when my Blue Jeans blue  
Blue Jean can send me  
Oh somebody send me  
Somebody send me  
Oh somebody send me  
  
One day Im gonna write a poem in a letter  
One day Im gonna get that faculty together  
Remember that everybody has to wait in line  
Blue Jean look out world you know Ive got mine  
She got Latin roots  
She got everything
