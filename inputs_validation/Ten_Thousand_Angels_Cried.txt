Stillness filled the heavens on crucifixion day  
Some say it rained I dont know if its true  
Well I can just imagine ten thousand angels cried  
That would seem like rain to me and you  
  
The angels all stood ready to take him from the tree  
They waited for the words from his voice  
And when he asked the father why has thou forsaken me  
They watched the saviour die of his own choice  
  
Ive never seen ten thousand angels cry  
But Im sure they did  
As they stood by  
And watched the saviour die  
  
God turned his head away  
He couldnt bear the sight  
It must have looked like rain  
When ten thousand angels cried  
  
As the sun slipped away  
The skies turned to grey  
And when jesus gave his all  
Thats when the tears began to fall  
  
Ive never seen ten thousand angels cry  
But Im sure they did  
As they stood by  
And watched the saviour die  
  
God turned his head away  
He couldnt bear the sight  
It must have looked like rain  
When ten thousand angels cried  
  
It must have looked like rain  
When ten thousand angels cried
