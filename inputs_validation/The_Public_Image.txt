When Im dead  
It will be read  
Here Lies The Public Image  
5 percent human being  
And 95 image  
  
What you see is what you get  
And what you get may well be worth seeing  
But just be careful when you walk  
On those old broken stones  
Because they are my feelings  
  
If I smile  
Do not be swayed  
I simply serve the public image  
When all have gone  
Just one remains  
Thank God for the public image  
  
What you see is what you get  
And what you get may well be worth seeing  
But just be careful when you walk  
On those old broken stones  
Because they are my feelings  
  
Scrape beneath  
The surface and  
You will find more public image  
  
I used to have  
A childish dream  
Until I had it kicked from me  
I tried to pass myself off  
As a Human being  
But the truth soon exposed me  
I had a love and she was very kind  
But she was no match for the Public Image  
  
What you see is all there is  
And what there is may well be worth seeing  
But just be careful what you say  
About people like me  
Because we dont take it lightly
