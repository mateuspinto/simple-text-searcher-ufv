Needed the shelter of someones arms  
And there you were  
Needed someone to understand my ups and downs  
And there you were  
With sweet love and devotion  
Touching my emotions  
  
I wanna stop  
And thank you baby  
I just wanna stop  
And thank you baby  
Whoa Oh Yeah  
  
How sweet it is to be loved by you  
How sweet it is to be loved by you  
  
I close my eyes at night  
Wondering where would I be without you in my life  
Everything I did was such a bore  
Everywhere I went you know  
Id been there before  
But you brighten up for me all my days  
With a love so sweet in so many ways  
I wanna stop  
And thank you baby  
I just wanna stop and thank you baby  
Whoa oh  
  
How sweet it is to be loved by you  
How sweet it is to be loved by you  
  
You were better to me than I was to myself  
For me there is you and there aint nobody else  
I wanna stop  
And thank you baby  
I just wanna stop  
And thank you baby  
Oh whoa oh  
  
How sweet it is to be loved by you  
How sweet it is to be loved by you  
How sweet it is to be loved by you  
How sweet it is to be loved by you
