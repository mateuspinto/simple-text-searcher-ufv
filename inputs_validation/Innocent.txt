I guess you really did it this time  
Left yourself in your warpath  
Lost your balance on a tightrope  
Lost your mind tryin to get it back  
  
Wasnt it easier in your lunchbox days  
Always a bigger bed to crawl into  
Wasnt it beautiful when you believed in everything  
And everybody believed in you  
  
Its alright just wait and see  
Your string of lights is still bright to me  
Oh who you are is not where youve been  
Youre still an innocent  
Youre still an innocent  
  
Did some things you cant speak of  
But at night youll live it all again  
You wouldnt be shattered on the floor now  
If only you had seen what you know now then  
  
Wasnt it easier in your fireflycatchin days  
And everything out of reach someone bigger brought down to you  
Wasnt it beautiful runnin wild til you fell asleep  
Before the monsters caught up to you  
  
Its alright just wait and see  
Your string of lights is still bright to me  
Oh who you are is not where youve been  
Youre still an innocent  
  
Its okay life is a tough crowd  
Thirty two is still growin up now  
Who you are is not what you did  
Youre still an innocent  
  
Time turns flames to embers  
Youll have new Septembers  
Every one of us has messed up too  
  
Lives change like the weather  
I hope you remember  
Today is never too late to  
Be brand new  
  
Its all right just wait and see  
Your string of lights are still bright to me  
Oh who you are is not where youve been  
Youre still an innocent  
  
Its okay life is a tough crowd  
Thirty two is still growin up now  
Who you are is not what you did  
Youre still an innocent  
Youre still an innocent  
  
Lost your balance on a tight rope oh  
Its never too late to get it back
