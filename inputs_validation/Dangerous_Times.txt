I dont know if its in my mind  
Watching all the shadows behind me  
Cause I could get hurt  
Or maybe this time  
The cloud has got a silver lining  
And if Im scared I got a right to be  
I know you could wound me critically  
  
Chorus  
These are dangerous times  
And if I take some chances  
Put my heart on the line  
What would you do to me  
If I give myself up  
To these circumstances  
In these dangerous times  
Would you keep me safely  
  
Over the hill theres an army of fools  
Waiting for their hearts to be broken  
How do I know  
If Im gonna explode  
When I come out in the open  
Cause even lovers can turn into enemies  
I dont want to be a casualty  
  
Chorus  
Would you keep me  
  
Baby would you keep me safely tonight  
Can I trust you with all of my affections  
Can I trust you to be on my side  
In these dangerous times  
  
Chorus x 2
