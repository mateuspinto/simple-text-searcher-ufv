We are damned and we are dead  
All Gods children to be sent  
To our perfect place in the sun  
And in the dirt  
  
Theres a windshield in my heart  
We are bugs so smeared and scarred  
And could you stop the meat from thinking  
Before I swallow all of it  
Could you please  
  
Put me in the motorcade  
Put me in the death parade  
Dress me up and take me  
Dress me up and make me your dying god  
  
Angels with needles poke through our eyes  
And let the ugly light of the world in  
We were no longer blind  
We were no longer blind  
  
Put me in the motorcade  
Put me in the death parade  
Dress me up and take me  
Dress me up and make me your dying God  
  
Now we hold the ugly head  
The Marywhore is at the bed  
Theyve cast the shadow of our perfect death  
In the sun and in the dirt
