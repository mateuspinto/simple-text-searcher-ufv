Yesterday as I finished the last of the seven graves  
I went to call McKenzie  
I woke him up in the middle of the night  
You should have heard me SURPRISE  
  
Oh revenge is sweet  
  
Up and awake McKenzie knew that I was still alive  
And I have to tell you  
He is the Mayor of this God forsaken town  
Hes Lucys father the man that brought me down  
  
He is such a sick little man  
Hes so much sicker than me and I am  
  
Meet me at midnight by the cemetery gates  
Meet me at midnight or your Lucy will be dead  
  
Revenge is sweet  
Revenge is sweet I know that you agree  
  
Call me sick in the head but I would never lie to you  
I worked for the man  
Mayor McKenzie is an old perverted swine  
I caught him one night molesting his own little child  
  
Who do you think they all believed  
  
He is such a sick little man  
Hes so much sicker than me and I am  
  
Meet me at midnight by the cemetery gates  
Meet me at midnight or your Lucy will be dead  
  
McKenzie did you hear meNo Lucy she is fine  
Shes sleeping in her coffin  
Cant wait to meet your face again  
  
He is such a sick little man  
Hes so much sicker than me and I am  
  
Meet me at midnight by the cemetery gates  
Meet me at midnight or your Lucy will be dead
