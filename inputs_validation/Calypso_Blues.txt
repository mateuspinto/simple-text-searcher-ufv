Sittin by de ocean  
Me heart she feel so sad  
Sittin by de ocean  
Me heart she feel so sad  
Dont got de money  
To take me back to Trinidad  
  
Fine calypso woman  
She cook me shrimp and rice  
Fine calypso woman  
She cook me shrimp and rice  
These Yankee hot dogs  
Dont treat me stomach very nice  
  
In Trinidad one dollar buy  
Papaya juice banana pie  
Six coconut one female goat  
An plenty fish to fill de boat  
One bushel bread one barrel wine  
An all de town she come to dine  
  
But here is bad one dollar buy  
Cup of coffee ham on rye  
Me throat she sick from necktie  
Me feet hurt from shoes  
Me pocket full of empty  
I got Calypso blues  
  
These Yankee girl give me big scare  
Is black de root is blond de hair  
Her eyelash false her face is paint  
And pads are where de girl she aint  
  
She jitterbug when she should waltz  
I even think her name is false  
But calypso girl is good a lot  
Is what you see is what she got  
  
Sittin by de ocean  
Me heart she feel so sad  
Sittin by de ocean  
Me heart she feel so sad  
Dont got de money  
To take me back to Trinidad
