Looking out  
Across the nighttime  
The city winks a sleepless eye  
Hear her voice  
Shake my window  
Sweet seducing sighs  
  
Get me out  
Into the nighttime  
Four walls wont hold me tonight  
If this town  
Is just an apple  
Then let me take a bite  
  
If they say  
Why why tell em that its human nature  
Why why does he do it that way  
If they say  
Why why tell em that its human nature  
Why why does he do me that way  
  
Reaching out  
To touch a stranger  
Electric eyes are everywhere  
See that girl  
She knows Im watching  
She likes the way I stare  
  
If they say  
Why why tell em that its human nature  
Why why does he do me that way  
If they say  
Why why tell em that its human nature  
Why why does he do me that way  
  
I like livin this way  
I like lovin this way  
  
That way Why why  
That way Why why  
  
Looking out  
Across the morning  
Where the citys heart begins to beat  
Reaching out  
I touch her shoulder  
Im dreaming of the street  
  
If they say  
Why why tell em that its human nature  
Why why does he do me that way  
If they say  
Why why tell em that its human nature  
Why why does he do me that way
