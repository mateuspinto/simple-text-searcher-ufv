I heard that youre on your own now  
So am I  
Im living alone now  
I was wrong  
So were you  
What will you do  
Are you glad to be free  
Are you feeling lost just like me  
Longing for company  
  
Oh Sam Sam you know where I am  
Come around and talk awhile  
I need your smile  
You need a shoulder  
Oh Sam Sam you know where I am  
And the door is open wide  
Come on inside  
Longing to see you  
Oh Sam Sam you know where I am  
  
I find the days hard to face now  
Empty rooms  
Theres much too much space now  
And the nights go so slow  
Im sure you know  
Wish I knew what to do  
It would be so nice seeing you  
And it might help you too  
  
Oh Sam Sam you know where I am  
Come around and talk awhile  
I need your smile  
You need a shoulder  
Oh Sam Sam you know where I am  
And the door is open wide  
Come on inside  
Longing to see you  
Oh Sam Sam you know where I am  
  
Oh Sam you know where I am  
Oh Sam ooh Sam  
You know you know  
You know where I am
