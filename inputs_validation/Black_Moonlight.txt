Lost in the shuffle Ive drifted and strayed  
Bruised by the city bewildered betrayed  
With a heart heavy laden with faltering strides  
I have come to the bridge to the line that divides  
  
What am I doing up here in a daze  
As I gaze at the cold river bed  
Why do I ask myself shall I go back  
When I seem to be going ahead  
  
To black moonlight  
Where everything reflects your color  
Darkness that is endless  
Nights that leave me friendless blue  
  
Black moonlight  
You make the lights of Harlem duller  
Just like me youre faded jaded and degraded too  
Why must you send  
Ebony moonbeams depressing distressing  
Like shadows of love that are gone  
  
Where will it end  
Will it spread on to the starlight the sunlight  
And darken each promise of dawn  
  
Black moonlight  
Ive lost all power to resist you  
Madly I await you even though I hate you  
Black black moonlight
