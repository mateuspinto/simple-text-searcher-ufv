Yeah  
This is a song was sung by Leadbelly and it was written forhis friend  
He had a friend named Blind Lemon  
And they used to ride back and forth on a train from somewhere to Texas  
And I leraned this tune from a record  
I heard by him  
  
Silver City bound Im Silver City bound  
Im gonna tell my little baby Im Silver City bound  
Im gonna meet Blind Lemon gonna ride on down  
Silver City bound Im Silver City bound  
Im gonna tell my little baby Im Silver City bound  
Im gonna meet Blind Lemon gonna ride on down  
  
Take me by the hand oh babe  
And lead me to the promises land  
Take me by the hand oh babe  
And lead me to the promised land  
  
Silver City bound Im Silver City bound  
Im gonna tell my little baby Im Silver City bound  
Im gonna meet Blind Lemon gonna ride on down  
  
Take me by the hand oh babe  
And lead me to the promises land  
Take me by the hand oh babe  
And lead me to the promised land  
  
Im Silver City bound Im Silver City bound  
Im gonna tell my little baby Im Silver City bound  
Im gonna meet Blind Lemon gonna ride on down  
  
Silver City bound Im Silver City bound  
Im gonna tell my little baby Im Silver City bound  
Im gonna meet Blind Lemon gonna ride on down
