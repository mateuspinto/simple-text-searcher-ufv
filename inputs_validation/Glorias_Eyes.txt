I was your big man I was your prince charming  
King on a white horse hey now look how far Ive fallen  
I tried to trick you yeah but baby you got wise  
You cut me cut me right down to size  
Now Im just a fool in Glorias eyes  
  
Swore Id get you back I was so sure  
Id get you back like I done so many times before  
A little sweet talk to cover over all of the lies  
You came runnin back but to my surprise  
Well there was somethin gone in Glorias eyes  
  
Well in the dark when it was just me and you  
I asked the question that I knew the answer to  
Is that a smile my little dolly on the shelf  
Tell me is that a smile  
Or is it something else  
  
Now I work hard to prove my love is true  
Now I work hard and I bring it on home to you  
At night I pray as silently you lie  
Some day my love again will rise  
Like a shining torch in Glorias eyes  
  
I was your big man your prince charming  
King on a white horse now look how far Ive fallen
