She was a princess  
Queen of the highway  
Sign on the road said  
Take us to Madre  
  
No one could save her  
Save the blind tiger  
He was a monster  
Black dressed in leather  
  
She was a princess  
Queen of the highway  
  
Now they are wedded  
She is a good girl  
Naked as children  
Out in the meadow  
  
Naked as children  
Wild as can be  
Soon to have offspring  
Start it all over  
  
Start it all over  
  
American boy American girl  
Most beautiful people in the world  
Son of frontier Indian Swirl  
Dancing through the midnight whirlpool  
Formless hope it can  
Continue a little while  
Come on
