Out working on the virgin ground  
Waitin for the time I could head to town  
All those pretty girls Ill be looking for the pearl  
That could bring me up and ease me down  
Flying down the dusty road  
Little foreign wheels putting on a show  
My thoughts are hazy about this girl  
Might make me crazy I bet she will  
Never say never say no  
Dont ever let me hear ya say ya gotta go  
Never say never say no  
You better say never say no  
Then she stopped to my surprise  
Little foreign wheels want to cross the line  
With her voice so soft  
Turned the poppin Johnny off  
Then I began to realize  
She said her daddy needs to know  
Bout this ol boy fore he lets her go  
Ill work for him then time will tell  
Hell get to know me I bet he will  
Never say never say no  
Dont ever let me hear ya say ya gotta go  
Never say never say no  
Never let me hear ya say ya gotta go  
No never say never say no  
Never let me hear ya say ya gotta go  
Never say never say no no  
Never say never say no  
Dont ever let me hear ya say ya gotta go  
Never say never say no  
Never let me hear ya say ya gotta go  
Never say never say no  
Dont ever let me hear ya say ya gotta go  
Never say never say no no  
Dont ever say never say no  
Never let me hear ya say ya gotta go  
Never say never say no  
Never let me hear ya say ya gotta go
