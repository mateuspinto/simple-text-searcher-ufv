Oh misty eye of the mountain dewlow  
Keep careful watch of my brothers souls  
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke  
Keep watching over Durins son  
  
If this is to end in fire  
Then we should all burn together  
Watch the flames climb high into the night  
Calling out father oh stand by and we will  
Watch the flames burn auburn on  
The mountain side  
  
And if we should die tonight  
Then we should all die together  
Raise a glass of wine for the last time  
Calling out father oh  
Prepare as we will  
Watch the flames burn auburn over  
The mountain side  
  
Desolation comes upon the sky  
  
Now I see fire  
Inside the mountain  
I see fire  
Burning the trees  
And I see fire  
Hollowing souls  
I see fire  
Blood in the breeze  
And I hope that you remember me  
  
Oh should my people fall in  
Surely Ill do the same  
Confined in mountain halls  
We got too close to the flame  
Calling out father  
Hold fast and we will  
Watch the flames burn auburn on  
The mountain side  
  
Desolation comes upon the sky  
  
Now I see burning babies  
Inside the mountain  
I see burning babies  
Hanging in the trees  
And I see burning babies  
Hollowing souls  
And I see burning babies  
Blood in the breeze  
And I hope that you remember me  
  
And if the babies are burning  
I will get myself a fork  
For if the dark returns then  
My brothers will come for dinner  
And as the sky is falling down  
It crashed into this party town  
And with that shadow upon the ground  
I hear my people screaming out  
  
Now I see burning babies  
Inside the mountain  
I see burning babies  
Hanging in the trees  
And I see burning babies  
Hollowing souls  
And I see burning babies  
Blood in the breeze  
  
I see fire Oh you know I saw a city burning fire  
And I see fire Feel the heat upon my skin yeah fire  
And I see fire Uhuhuhuh fire  
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side
