Five little froggies sat on a shore  
Children crouch in a row like frogs  
  
One went for a swim then there were four  
First frog leaps and swims off  
  
Four little froggies  
Children crouch in a row like frogs  
  
Looked out to sea  
Children put hand at brow and look out to sea  
  
One went swimming and then there were three  
Second frog leaps and swims off  
  
Three little froggies said What can we do  
Children crouch and repeat  
  
One jumped in the water then there were two  
Third frog leaps and swims off  
  
Two little froggies sat in the sun  
Children crouch  
  
One swam off and then there was one  
Fourth frog leaps and swims off  
  
One little froggie said This is no fun  
Child crouches and repeats  
  
He dived in the water and then there were none
