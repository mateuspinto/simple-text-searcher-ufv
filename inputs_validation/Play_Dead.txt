A moth into a butterfly  
And a lie  
Into the sweetest truth  
Im so afraid of life  
  
I try  
To call your name but Im  
Silenced by the fear of dying in your heart once again  
  
I see the seasons changing  
And in the heart of this autumn I fall  
With the leaves from the trees  
  
I play dead  
To hide my heart  
Until the world gone dark fades away  
  
I cry  
Like God cries the rain  
And Im just one step away from the end of today  
  
I see the reasons changing  
And in the warmth of the past I crawl  
Scorched by the shame  
  
I play dead  
To hide my heart  
Until the world gone dark fades away  
  
I stay dead  
Until you veil my scars and say goodbye to fate  
Before its too late
