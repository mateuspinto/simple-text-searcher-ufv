Say exactly how you feel  
Right now youre free to say it all  
There is no one here to judge you I only love you  
Youre free to close your eyes and fall  
You can trust me this is real  
Say exactly how you feel  
  
Chorus  
Tell me all your dreams  
What you think love means  
Well lock the world outside  
Embrace the gift of time  
Promising forever  
Knowing that this moment might be  
All we ever find  
  
Every breath of who you are  
Tells a story that I love  
I have finally found the truth in what I see in you  
And what I feel with every touch  
The simple beauty of your heart  
In every breath of who you are  
  
Chorus Repeat 2X  
  
Promising forever  
Knowing that this moment might be  
All we ever find
