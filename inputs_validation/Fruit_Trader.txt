Cain told Abel Brother youd better get busy  
We got watermelon burnin up out there in the sun  
Abel said Cain brother youre drivin me silly  
Raisin up this fruit trader bull you know it aint no fun  
  
Chorus  
Were just yellin in the dark  
Were just pissin in the wind  
From underneath the sheets that we pray from  
Better let a little bit of this goodness get in  
  
So Cain rose up and he slay his brother  
The human soul and violence sometimes can be the next of kin  
And feelings are real in moments of desperation  
When the lowest dimension of the animal is let in  
  
Chorus  
  
Aint got no purpose aint got no direction I aint got no morals  
Aint got no politics aint got no particular point of view  
What Ive got is plenty of time on my hands Ol Skinnys playground  
Hey Lord tell me again what you want me to do  
  
Chorus  
Better let a little bit of this beauty  
Better let a little bit of this goodness get in
