The spinningwheel to eilly and teesa in philly  
  
Mellow the moonlight to shine is beginning  
Close to the window yound eileen is spinning  
Bent over the fire her blind grandmother sitting  
Is crooning and moaning and drowsily knitting  
Eileen achara I hear someone tapping  
tis the ivy dear mother against the glass flapping  
Eilly I surely hear somebody sighing  
tis the sound mother dear of the summer winds dying  
Chorus  
  
Merrily cheerily noiselessly whirring  
Swings the wheel spins the wheel while the foots stirring  
Sprightly and brightly and airily ringing  
Thrilss the sweet voice of the young maiden singing  
  
Whats that noise I hear at the window I wonder  
tis the little birds chirping the holly bush under  
What makes you be shovin and moving your stool on  
And singing all wrong that old song of the coolin  
Theres a form at the casement the form of her true love  
And he whispers with face bent Im waiting for you love  
Get up on your stool through the lattice step lightly  
Well rove in the grove while the moons shining brightly  
  
Chorus  
  
The maid shakes her head on her lips lays her fingers  
Steals up from her seat longs to go and yet lingers  
A frightened glance turns to her drowsy grandmother  
Puts one foot on the stool spins the wheel with the other  
Lazily easily swings now the wheel round  
Slowly and lowly is heard now the reels sound  
Noisless and light to the lattice above  
The maid steps then leap to the arms of her lover  
  
Chorus  
  
Slower and slower and slower the wheel swings  
Lower and lower and lower the reel rings  
Ere the reel and the wheel stopped there ringing and moving  
Through the grove the young lovers by moonlight are roving
