Change in the weather change in the sea  
Come back baby youll find a change in me  
Everybody they ought to change sometime  
Because sooner or later we have to go down in that lonesome ground  
  
I changed suits I changed shirts  
I changed baby just to get shed of the dirt  
Everybody we ought to change sometime  
Because sooner or later were going down in that lonesome ground  
  
I changed honey I changed money  
I changed people just to keep from being funny  
Everybody they ought to change sometime  
Because sooner or later were going down in that lonesome ground  
  
Change in the ocean change in the sea  
Come back baby youll find a change in me  
Everybody we ought to change sometime  
Because sooner or later were going down in that lonesome ground
