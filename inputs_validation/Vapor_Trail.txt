Stratospheric traces of our transitory flight  
Trails of condensation held  
In narrow paths of white  
The sun is turning black  
The world is turning gray  
All the stars fade from the night  
The oceans drain away  
  
Horizon to horizon  
Memory written on the wind  
Fading away like an hourglass grain by grain  
Swept away like voices in a hurricane  
  
In a vapor trail  
  
Atmospheric phases make the transitory last  
Vaporize the memories that freeze the fading past  
Silence all the songbirds  
Stilled by the killing frost  
Forests burn to ashes  
Everything is lost  
  
Washed away like footprints in the rain  
  
In a vapor trail
