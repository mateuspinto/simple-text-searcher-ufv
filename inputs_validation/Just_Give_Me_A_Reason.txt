Verse 1  
Right from the start you were a thief you stole my heart  
And I your willing victim  
I let you see the parts of me that werent all that pretty  
And with every touch you fixed them  
  
PreChorus  
Now youve been talking in your sleep oh oh  
Things you never say to me oh oh  
Tell me that youve had enough  
Of our love our love  
  
Chorus  
Just give me a reason just a little bits enough  
Just a second were not broken just bent  
And we can learn to love again  
Its in the stars its been written in the scars on our hearts  
Were not broken just bent  
And we can learn to love again
