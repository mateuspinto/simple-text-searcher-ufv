I see you comb your hair and gimme that grin  
Its making me spin now spinnin within  
Before I melt like snow you say hello how do you do  
I love the way you undress now baby begin  
Do your caress honey my hearts in a mess  
I love your blueeyed voice like Tiny Tim shines through  
How do you do  
Well here we are cracking jokes in the corner of our mouths  
And I feel like Im laughing in a dream  
If I was young I could wait outside your school  
Cause your face is like the cover of a magazine  
  
How do you do do you do the things that you do  
No one I know could ever keep up with you  
How do you do did it ever make sense to you  
To say bye bye bye  
  
I see you in that chair with perfect skin  
Well how have you been baby livin in sin  
Hey I gotta know did you say hello how do you do  
Well here we are spending time in the louder part of town  
And it feels like everythings surreal  
When I get old I will wait outside your house  
Cause your hands have got the power meant to heal  
  
How do you do do you do the things that you do  
No one I know could ever keep up with you  
How do you do did it ever make sense to you  
To say bye bye bye  
  
How do you do do you do the things that you do  
No one I know could ever keep up with you  
How do you do did it ever make sense to you  
To say bye bye bye
