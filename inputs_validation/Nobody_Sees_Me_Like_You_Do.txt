I see your face looking into the space  
All tired and worried  
Why does it have to be like this you and I  
I wanted us to be happy  
  
No one can see me like you do  
No one can see you like I do  
  
I see your face with a trace of life  
Being a wife and a woman  
If I ever hurt you please remember  
I wanted you to be happy  
  
Is there anything I want more  
More than your trust and understanding  
  
No one can see me like you do  
No one can see you like I do  
  
I wanna quit moving  
I wanna quit running  
I wanna relax and be tender  
I wanna see us together again  
Rocking away in our walnut chairs  
  
Even with your warmth and closeness  
The feeling of loneliness hangs over like a curse  
  
No one can see me like you do  
No one can see you like I do  
  
Even with our dreams and yearnings  
The feeling of loneliness hangs over like a thirst  
  
No one can see me like you do  
No one can see you like I do  
  
No one can see me like you do  
No one can see you like I do
