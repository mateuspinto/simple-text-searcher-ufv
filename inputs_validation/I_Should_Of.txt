If Id known then  
If only I had known  
What where or when  
I would of kept you on the phone  
Hindsight is tough  
Its so obvious  
Never enough for the two of us  
  
I would of tried a little harder  
I would have cried a little louder  
I would have lied with more aplomb  
I I I I I I I should have known  
  
When we made love  
Sometimes it was great  
Just once or twice  
I would have called it second rate  
Anyway the days passed by in peace  
I never though you needed  
More release  
  
I would of tried a little harder  
I would have cried a little louder  
I would have lied with more aplomb  
I I I I I I I should have known  
  
If I hadif if if  
I should have I should have  
I could have I could have  
Oh fuck I really miss you  
I really miss you  
  
I should have tried a little harder  
I should have cried a whole lot louder  
I should have lied  
With more aplomb  
I I If only I I should have known
