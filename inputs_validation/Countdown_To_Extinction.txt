Endangered species caged in fright  
Shot in cold blood no chance to fight  
The stage is set now pay the price  
And ego boost dont think twice  
Technology the battles unfair  
You pull the hammer without a care  
Squeeze the trigger that makes you Man  
Pseudosafari the hunt is canned  
The hunt is canned  
All are gone all but one  
No contest nowhere to run  
No more left only one  
This is it this is the Countdown to Extinction  
Tell the truth you wouldnt dare  
The skin and trophy oh so rare  
Silence speaks louder than words  
Ignore the guilt and take your turn  
Liars anagram is lairs  
Man you were never even there  
Killed a few feet from the cages  
Point blank youre so courageous  
So courageous  
One hour from now  
Another species of life form  
Will disappear from the face of the planet  
Forever And the rate is accelerating
