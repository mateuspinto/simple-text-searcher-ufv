I see a lion captive in the kitchen  
Rolling thunder rumbles down the hall  
Once in awhile everyone paces the floor  
Lately its more and more  
Love if yu must be started go easily on your way  
Still I wonder could it wait another day  
Will it last enough to say you have your freedom  
Is the answer just another road to go  
Does it have to leave to be  
Can it stay and be with be with me  
When will it last enough to have it here at home  
Too many roads are needlessly divided  
By silent walls we build along the way  
Why be alone to learn that your life has more  
Thats what our love is for  
Tear down those angry walls Ill walk with you where you go  
Still youre the only one wholl ever know  
Will it last enough to say you have your freedom  
Is the answer just another road to go  
Does it have to leave to be  
Or can it stay and be with me  
Will it last enough Oh will it last enough  
Will it last enough Oh will it last enough  
When will it last enough to have it here at home
