My life nothing was easy till now  
Hope like the morning will paint the dawn  
More than ordinary deep down  
Make it more than merry deep down  
Take me to the jamboree deep down  
And shine a light on me  
Draw back the curtains and smile  
Everythings wow  
  
Girls are ten penny Janet Joy and Jenny Judy Joan and Jackie G  
Hear me now I warn you  
Girls from California break your heart and set you free  
My life  
  
Shame to rely but I swear its the best I can do  
Like a flame like an I with a dot I am not you  
Call me guilty I swear Im a man who can fly deep down  
I keep coming back Ill get back to you  
  
My life nothing was easy till now
