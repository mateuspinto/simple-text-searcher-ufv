Youve got a glow thats not a suntan  
And a new gleam in your eyes  
Oh it must have been one great vacation  
Girl you look so satisfied  
  
Tell me what room was the holiday in  
Was I out of your mind when you turned to him  
What a good time it must have been  
Tell me what room was the holiday in  
  
You said you needed a small vacation  
Just a couple of days all by yourself  
So off you went in a new direction  
And what you found was someone else  
  
So tell me what room was the holiday in  
Was I out of your mind when you turned to him  
What a good time it must have been  
Tell me what room was the holiday in  
  
What room was the holiday in  
Was I out of your mind when you turned to him  
What a good time it must have been  
Tell me what room was the holiday in  
  
Tell me what room was the holiday  
Was I out of your mind when you turned to him  
What a good time it must have been  
Tell me what room was the holiday in
