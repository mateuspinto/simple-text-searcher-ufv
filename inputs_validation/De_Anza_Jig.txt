Oh I can still remember  
Jenny Hernando  
She was my little lovely one  
When I was seventeen  
I remember the day that she  
Gave me her virginity  
And then she gave it to everyone  
In our vicinity  
  
Oh I can still remember  
Julie Tolentino  
The dancing Filipino  
We used to run around  
Her and Flouncin Freddy  
Were going hot and steady  
Now she runs a dyke bar  
The biggest one in town  
  
I can still remember my  
Old friend Todd Squelati  
I watching him snort a  
Milkshake right up his nose  
He slurped it up the left side  
Blew it out the right side  
How he ever kept it down  
I will never know  
  
Of course I still remember  
Ol Flouncin Freddy  
We were pumping gas  
Down at El Sobrante Shell  
His Mustang was his pride and joy  
He liked to dance the cowboy  
Hanging out at Jack In the Box  
But eat at Taco Bell
