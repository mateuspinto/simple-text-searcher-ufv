Distant hands in foreign lands  
Are turning hidden wheels  
Causing things to come about  
Which no one seems to feel  
  
All invisible from where we stand  
The connections come to pass  
And though too strange to comprehend  
They affect us nonetheless yes  
  
Once again a time of change oh  
The change makes music  
And the children will dance  
See the pieces of the picture  
Rearrange themselves  
It feels just like a symphony to me  
With nothing left to chance  
Just look over your shoulder  
Its out of you hands its over for now  
  
Leave behind what you can  
You can always return  
The rhythm remains unbroken  
Unspoken but loud and clear  
Its a slow vibration migration  
  
Mystery muse how I hunger for an answer  
Unsung song how I long to play the changes  
Hidden rhythm havent I  
Always been your dancer  
Sacred secrets of the meaning  
To my dreaming migration
