Freedom Your call is coming  
Im dreaming away  
For what lies hidden  
It needs to be found  
  
Sounds of freedom make me wanna try  
  
When the ghosts are found  
They will lead us to tomorrow  
Sounds of freedom make me wanna try  
  
FreedomVoices forgotten  
I hear them close by  
Ghosts from the past I can see through their eyes  
Are these the ancestors leaving me signs  
  
Sounds of freedom make me wanna try  
  
When the ghosts are found  
They will lead us to tomorrow  
Sounds of freedom make me wanna try  
  
The sounds they are all around  
Forces start moving out  
Taking sides though theres so much  
That I need to know  
And soon it will be shown  
  
Sounds of freedom make me wanna try  
  
When the ghosts are found  
They will lead us to tomorrow  
Sounds of freedom make me wanna try  
  
When the ghosts are found they will lead us to tomorrow  
When the ghosts are found they will lead us to tomorrow  
  
If we could restart how it was before tomorrow
