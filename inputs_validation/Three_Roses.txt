Sitting by the fireside with a book in your hand  
Two lazy dogs sittin watchin your man  
Three roses were bought with you in mind  
Three roses were bought with you in mind  
  
I gotta stop and see what Im on about  
Stop and feel what I want I gotta  
Stop and see what Im on about  
Stop and feel what I want with you  
Ah  
  
Walking through a wonderland I got you by the hand  
Every move we made just as if it were planned  
Three roses were bought with you in mind  
Three roses were bought with you in mind  
  
I gotta stop and see what Im on about  
Stop and feel what I want I gotta  
Stop and see what Im on about  
Stop and feel what I want with you  
Ah
