I cant answer the questions you ask me  
I dont know what to say  
The answers are somewhere lost in the stars  
when the night has turned to day  
But I know if the silence of night could be here  
It would drift through my soul and calm all my fear  
And I could reach out and draw you so near to me  
  
Touch me and warm me and I will lie still  
And all that you ask me to give you I will  
One living moment well have for our own  
A brief flash of time that we spent all alone  
But you ask me for nothing and give what you can  
And were wrapped in a pillow of sleep once again  
And my memory drifts through the universe when we are one  
  
Closely were falling through time  
And the earth will turn in the silence of space  
always in motion yet always in place  
And all things will change yet remain what they are  
And far will be near and near will be far  
And the ages will darken and blend into time  
And all that is poetry will no longer rhyme  
But our moment together is forever sublime  
  
For the time has arrived when we must understand  
That were lost in a void on this sad speck of sand  
And nobody knows where we are no one cares  
And the tears that we shed in the dark no one cares  
And the madmen who plunder this world for their fame  
Have forgotten that no one remembers their name  
But time and the universe are always the same  
  
Closely were falling through time
