While out sailing on the ocean  
While out sailing on the sea  
I bumped into the Saviour  
And He said pardon me  
I said Jesus you look tired  
He said Jesus so do you  
Sit down son  
Cause I got some fat to chew  
  
Chorus  
Everybody needs somebody that they can talk to  
Someone to open up their ears  
And let that trouble through  
Now you dont have to sympathize  
Or care what they may do  
But everybody needs somebody that they can talk to  
  
Well he spoke to me of morality  
Starvation pain and sin  
Matter of fact the whole dang time  
I only got a few words in  
But I wont squack  
Let em talk  
Hell its been a long long time  
And any friend thats been turned down  
Is bound to be a friend of mine  
  
Chorus  
  
Now we sat there for an hour or two  
Just eatin that Gospel pie  
When around the bend come a terrible wind  
And lightning lit the sky  
He said so long son I gotta run  
Appreciate you listening to me  
And I believe I heard him sing these words  
As he skipped out across the sea  
  
Chorus
