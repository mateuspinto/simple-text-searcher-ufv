Let me taste  
Let me feel  
I need to know what you keep inside  
  
No need to speak  
Just let it be  
Carry out this wish for me let nothing interfere  
  
Rise to submission  
Im still beneath in the soil  
  
Discard your clothes  
Let loose your hair  
Were intertwined forever and has always been  
  
Say the word  
And Ill depart  
Upon your lips dwells nothing but the meaning of my cause  
  
And so comes the dark  
Vibrant as ever before  
Flowers already withered  
In this endless winter of souls  
  
Outside in the park  
The days move along  
And nothing ever changes  
  
They have nothing on us  
But weve always knew  
That nothing ever changes  
  
Rise to submission  
Im still beneath in the soil  
This is ours alone  
Feeding off the warmth  
Lured out from the inside  
  
Depending on the life blood  
  
Silently  
Whispering  
Move in me and set me free
