Deep in your mind there is another side  
A morbid truth one cannot hide  
Unimaginable gore was your past time high  
To hear people scream to watch them die  
  
Return back to the burial site  
Face your dreams upon this night  
Severed limbs not far away  
Spirit past you now obey  
  
Images of the forgotten past  
Your first life revealed at last  
Now youll find to your surprise  
All the corpses you left behind  
  
A place you feel youve been to before  
Where life would turn right into gore  
You dig deep down through the years of decay  
The truth is revealed you found your way  
  
Return back to the burial site  
Face your dreams upon this night  
Severed limbs not far away  
Spirit past you now obey  
  
Images of the forgotten past  
Your first life revealed at last  
Now youll find to your surprise  
All the corpses you left behind
