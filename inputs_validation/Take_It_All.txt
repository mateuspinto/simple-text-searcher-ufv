Didnt I give it all  
Tried my best  
Gave you everything I had everything and no less  
Didnt I do it right Did I let you down  
Maybe you got too used to having me round  
Still how can you walk away  
From all my tears  
Its gonna be an empty road without me right here  
But go on and take it take it all with you  
Dont look back at this crumbling fool  
Just take it all with my love take it all with my love  
  
Maybe I should leave to help you see  
Nothing is better than this and this is everything we need  
So is it over Is this really it youre giving up so easily  
I thought you loved me more than this  
  
But go on go on take it take it all with you  
Dont look back at this crumbling fool  
Just take it all with my love take it all with my love  
  
I will change if I must  
Slow it down and bring it home I will adjust  
Oh if only if only you knew  
Everything I do is for you  
  
But go on and take it take it all with you  
Dont look back at this crumbling fool  
Just take it take it all with you  
Dont look back at this crumbling fool  
Just take it all with my love  
Take it all with my love  
Take it all with my love
