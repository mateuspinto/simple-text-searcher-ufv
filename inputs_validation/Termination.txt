Fly blue sky voices keep calling  
Bidding me welcome why maiden land  
Luring me closer forbiden land  
And as Im standing closer  
Those natives step beyond  
Release the mortal patterns  
My mind I post beyond  
Spinning in circles  
Miracles happen  
As lower life life shows me in to my doom  
Spirit will striken  
The end will come soon  
This is termination  
The outcome of your life
