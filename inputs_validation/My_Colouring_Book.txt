For those who fancy coloring books  
And lots of people do  
Heres a new one for you  
A most unusual coloring book  
The kind youll never see  
Crayons ready  
Very well  
Begin to color me  
  
These are the eyes that watched him as he walked away  
Color them grey  
This is the heart that thought he would always be true  
Color it blue  
  
These are the arms that held him and touched him  
Lost him somehow  
Color them empty now  
These are the beads I wore  
Until she came between  
Color them green  
  
This is the room that I sleep in and walk in  
And weep in and hide in  
That nobody nobodys seen  
Oh color it lonely please  
  
This is the man whose love I depended upon  
Color him gone
