Mama taught us how to sing in harmony  
Grandma used to stomp her foot and slap her knee  
I can still hear daddy singin  
Down by the old mill stream  
When uncle Jim played the fiddle  
You could hear it talk you could hear it sing  
  
And it echoed down the mountains  
To those Georgia pines  
Ran through Tennessee just like that old moonshine  
Old Joe Clark Cripple Creek Annie Get Your Gun  
I guess my old time favorite was yhat Fox on the Run  
Like a fox like a fox on the run  
  
Grandpa played the dobro till the break of dawn  
Me I had this guitar and Id strum along  
Carol played the washboard and the tamborine  
Little Mary Beth would always help us sing  
And it echoed down the mountains
