If you want your freedom  
There is nothing planned  
If you really need him  
I will understand  
  
Chorus  
Please believe in love  
I believe there is a God above  
For love  
And Hes coming yes Hes coming  
  
If you want to fly  
Then fly away  
All the cloudy skies  
Belong to yesterday  
  
Chorus  
  
In the shadows the swallow dies  
No one knows the hobo hides  
There is no need to apologize  
  
This is the story of a downtown sundown  
If you climb the mountain  
You will see  
There is no great distance  
Between the Lord and me  
  
Chorus  
  
In the shadows a swallow dies  
No one knows the hobo hides  
There is no need to apologize  
This is the story of a downtown sundown
