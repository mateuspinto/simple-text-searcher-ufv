I spent all my money on a big old fancy car  
For these brighteyed hunnies  
Oh yeah you know who you are  
Keep me up til the sun is high  
Til the birds start calling my name  
Im addicted and I dont know why  
Guess Ive always been this way  
  
All these roads steer me wrong  
But I still drive them all night long all night long  
  
All you young wild girls  
You make a mess of me  
Yeah you young wild girls  
Youll be the death of me the death of me  
All you young wild girls  
No matter what you do No matter what you do  
Yeah you young wild girls  
Ill always come back to you come back to you  
  
I get lost under these lights  
I get lost in the words I say  
Start believing my own lies  
Like everything will be okay  
Oh I still dream of simple life  
Boy meets girl makes her his wife  
But love dont exist  
When you live like this  
That much I know yes I know  
  
All these roads steer me wrong  
But I still drive them all night long all night long  
  
All you young wild girls  
You make a mess of me  
Yeah you young wild girls  
Youll be the death of me the death of me  
All you young wild girls  
No matter what you do No matter what you do  
Yeah you young wild girls  
Ill always come back to you come back to you  
  
You you you you  
You you you you  
Yeah you you you  
You you you you  
  
All you young wild girls  
You make a mess of me  
Yeah you young wild girls  
Youll be the death of me the death of me  
All you young wild girls  
No matter what you do No matter what you do  
Yeah you young wild girls  
Ill always come back to you come back to you
