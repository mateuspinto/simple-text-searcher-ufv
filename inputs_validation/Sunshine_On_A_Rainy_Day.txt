I see you in the darkness  
I see you in light  
I see your light shining in through the night  
Make me feel make me feel  
Like I belong  
Dont leave me Dont leave me here  
All I alone  
Cause Your eyes like summer skies  
Blue words in the ocean clear as in the skkkkyyyy  
CHORUS x4  
Sunshine on a rainy day  
Makes my soul makes my soul  
Trip Trip Trip Away  
You touch me with your spirit  
You touch me with your heart  
You touch me in the darkness  
A feeling starts  
Make you feel make you feel so unreal so unreal  
Like a wind in the desert  
Like a moon on the street  
CHORUS x4  
Instrumental  
Sunshine on a rainy day makes my soul makes my soul trip trip trip away x4
