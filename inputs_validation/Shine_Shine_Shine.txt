And now the day is over  
And the shadows start to grow  
The sun has done us well today  
In flaming crimson he explodes  
And bursts of million colours  
That spill across the sky  
I turn and look at you love  
And i know the reason why  
Such a long time  
Like good wine  
Getting better every day  
Now you know ill never go  
So youll always stay  
  
And our love will keep on shining  
Through the wind and the rain  
And when the day is over  
Our love will shine again  
And as the years fly over  
Im feeling younger every day  
The love that you have given me  
Is more than i can say  
  
Shine shine shine
