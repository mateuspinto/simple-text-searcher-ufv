Wake up Wake up  
Grab a brush and put a little makeup  
Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup  
Whyd you leave the keys upon the table  
Here you go create another fable  
  
You wanted to  
Grab a brush and put a little makeup  
You wanted to  
Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup  
You wanted to  
Whyd you leave the keys upon the table  
You wanted to  
  
I dont think you trust  
In my self righteous suicide  
I cry when angels deserve to die Rrrrrrraaa  
  
Wake up Wake up  
Grab a brush and put a little makeup  
Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup  
Whyd you leave the keys upon the table  
Here you go create another fable  
  
You wanted to  
Grab a brush and put a little makeup  
You wanted to  
Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup  
You wanted to  
Whyd you leave the keys upon the table  
You wanted to  
  
I dont think you trust  
In my selfrighteous suicide  
I cry when angels deserve to die  
In my selfrighteous suicide I cry  
When angels deserve to die  
  
Father Father Father Father  
Fall into your hands I commend my spirit  
Fall into your hands  
Why have you forsaken me  
In your eyes forsaken me  
In your thoughts forsaken me  
In your heart forsaken me oh  
  
Trust in my selfrighteous suicide  
I cry when angels deserve to die  
In my self righteous suicide  
I cry when angels deserve to die
