When ice cold winds of winter  
Chill me to the bone  
An thoughts of summer breezes  
Turn my heart to stone  
Thats when I need a hand to guide me  
When its more than I can bear  
A shoulder I can cry on  
Someone to lead me there  
  
An give me love  
Give me love  
Give me love  
Till the day I die  
Till the day I die  
  
Slowly I awaken  
To the Weavers plan for me  
To drift upon the waters  
Of my own uncertainty  
To look for a companion  
Who will share my destiny  
A guiding hand to understand  
An walk to road with me  
  
An give me love  
Give me love  
Give me love  
Till the day I die  
Till the day I die  
  
I want to be the master of my destiny  
I never want to crawl an beg for no sympathy  
When everything I have is yours  
An all I ask of you  
  
Is give me love  
Give me love  
Give me love  
Till the day I die  
Till the day I die  
  
I never want to be the first  
To show Im down  
But Im never gonna wear the frozen smile of a clown  
When everything I have is yours  
And all I ask of you  
  
Is give me love  
Give me love  
Give me love  
Till the day I die  
Till the day I die  
  
Give me love  
Give me love  
Give me love  
Til the day I die  
Give me love  
Give me love  
Give me love  
Till the day I die  
  
Till the day I die
