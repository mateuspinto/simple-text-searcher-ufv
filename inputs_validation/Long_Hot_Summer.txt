I cant sleep aint no sleep acoming  
Im just lying here thinking bout you  
Im in deep falling deep into the picture  
In my mind of everything were gonna do  
  
Over at the lake and down by the river  
You can feel it start to rise  
Wanna jump in my car go wherever you are  
Cause I need you by my side  
  
Chorus  
Its gonna be a long hot summer we should be together  
With your feet up on the dashboard now  
Singing along with the radio its such a beautiful sound  
But when you say my name in the middle of the day  
I swear I see the stars come out  
When you hold my hand in the back of my mind  
Just waiting on the sun to go down the sun to go down  
  
I wanna see your brown skin shimmer in the sun for the first time  
I try to be the one who knows just what to do to you to get me that smile  
One chance of meeting you were walking by me on the street and I said hi  
And that was the beginning of my heart spinnin like these wheels in my head
tonight  
  
Chorus  
  
The only place that I wanna be is where you are  
Cause anymore than a heartbeat away is just too far  
  
Its gonna be a long hot summer we should be together  
All I really want is more than this moment right now  
Cause when you say my name in the middle of the day  
I swear I see the stars come out  
And when you hold my hand and I look into your eyes  
Oh I swear it looks like youre waiting on the sun to go down the sun to go
down  
  
I swear its like youre waiting on the sun to go down  
Waiting on the sun to go down  
Hey yeah oh Im loving thinking bout you  
I cant sleep Im just lying here thinkin bout you
