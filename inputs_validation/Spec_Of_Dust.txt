In the middle of the night  
Im lying in your bed  
Thinking of you and me in the universe  
  
Stars are moving like the night we met  
The earth is turning like the time we said  
In my mind Im searching for you billion miles away  
  
Why do I miss you so if youre just a spec of dust  
Floating endlessly amongst the billion stars  
  
Knowing that one day we may float apart  
Meeting each other in memories  
  
Why do I love you so if youre just a spec of dust  
Floating endlessly amongst the trillion stars  
Knowing that one day we may float apart  
Meeting each other in universe
