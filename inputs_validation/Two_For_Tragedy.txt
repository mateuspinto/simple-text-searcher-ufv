Sleep Eden sleep  
My fallen son  
Slumber in peace  
  
Cease the pain  
Lifes just in vain  
For us to gain  
Nothing but all the same  
  
No healing hand  
For your disease  
Drinking scorn like water  
Cascading with my tears  
  
Beneath the candle bed  
Two saddened angels in heaven in death  
  
Now let us lie  
Sad we lived sad we die  
Even in your pride  
I never blamed you  
  
A mothers love  
Is a sacrifice  
Together sleeping  
Keeping it all  
  
No sympathy  
No eternity  
One light for each undeserved tear  
  
Beneath the candle bed  
Two souls with everything yet to be said
