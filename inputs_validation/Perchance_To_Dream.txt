Perchance to dream  
Drive into the waters edge yeah  
Splashing all over me  
Turning my world upside down  
Then I see and I start to dream as if for the first time  
Suddenly as calm as can be skies full of wonder tears asunder  
Climb through the cold falling up to meet the road  
Something in my head will explode  
Oh baby dream wont you come and share the world with me  
Time with me  
Tears on gem rocks tear out tender to strike it with  
The loose rock can satisfy the lights of the soft wood  
And then I see and I start to dream marching in new shine  
Stars on my breath scares me the best flickering metal shadows  
Fly through the air falling up to brush the clouds  
Static in my hair Im rushing out  
Oh baby dream wont you come and share the world with me  
Time with me  
And then I see and I start to breath as if for the first time  
Suddenly as calm as can be sky full of wonder tears me under  
Fly through the cold falling up to meet the road  
Something in my head will explode  
Oh baby dream wont you come and share the world with me  
Some time with me  
Oh baby dream wont you come and share the world with me  
Time with me
