Meanwhile down on Biel Street  
Drinking in a Biel Street bar  
Theres a fog rollin off the Mississippi  
Has anybody seen Arkansas  
  
And the deckhands from the toll boats  
Come ashore wearin Mexican shoes  
They headed strait for Graceland  
It was the first thing they wanted to do  
  
Cinco de Mayo in Memphis  
Marchetti singin the blues  
Soul sisters hugging Senoritas  
All sportin Blue suede shoes  
  
Pork pie hats and sombreros  
Hangin on a downtown street  
Swingin pool cues at Pinatas  
Dont that river smell sweet  
  
And they all come to get em some Memphis  
A little somethin for their souls  
Lone riders land up with limousines  
Hey they all came to rock and roll  
  
Cinco de Mayo in Memphis  
Marchetti singin the blues  
Southern belles and Senoritas  
All sportin Blue suede shoes  
  
Cinco de Mayo in Memphis  
Marchetti singin the blues  
Soul sisters hugging Senoritas  
All sportin Blue suede shoes
