Im sick and tired of the damn TV  
Im gonna make my own movie  
I want to star in a late night show  
And all I need is my video  
  
Shock me Make it electric  
Shock me Make it last  
  
Curtain up let the camera roll  
Its automatic its in control  
Got no script baby aint no lines  
Just me and you and a real good time  
  
Oh shock me Make it electric  
Shock me Make it last  
Shock me Gimme thunder n lightning  
Shock me Ooh babe I need it fast  
  
Chorus  
Cause all I want is some  
Action action action not words  
Gimme action action action not words  
  
Cmon and shock me let the cameras roll  
  
Oh Ill be the hero you be the star  
With your wine and your caviar  
No audition a starring roll  
Ill be your Bogart n you be Monroe yeah  
  
Shock me Make it electric  
Shock me Oh bump and grind  
Shock me Make a night to remember  
Shock me Do it one more time  
  
So cut me in on the action  
  
Lights camera sound I need action  
  
Chorus
