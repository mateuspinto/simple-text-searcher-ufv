Im a dweller on the threshold  
And Im waiting at the door  
And Im standing in the darkness  
I dont want to wait no more  
  
I have seen without perceiving  
I have been another man  
Let me pierce the realm of glamor  
So I know just what I am  
  
Im a dweller on the threshold  
And Im waiting at the door  
And Im standing in the darkness  
I dont want to wait no more  
  
Feel the angel of the present  
In the mighty crystal fire  
Lift me up consume my darkness  
Let me travel even higher  
  
Im a dweller on the threshold  
As I cross the burning ground  
Let me go down to the water  
Watch the great illusion drown  
  
Im a dweller on the threshold  
And Im waiting at the door  
And Im standing in the darkness  
I dont want to wait no more  
  
Im gonna turn and face the music  
The music of the spheres  
Lift me up consume my darkness  
When the midnight disappears  
  
I will walk out of the darkness  
And Ill walk into the light  
And Ill sing the song of ages  
And the dawn will end the night  
  
Im a dweller on the threshold  
And Im waiting at the door  
And Im standing in the darkness  
I dont want to wait no more  
  
Im a dweller on the threshold  
And I cross some burning ground  
And Ill go down to the water  
Let the great illusion drown  
  
Im a dweller on the threshold  
And Im waiting at the door  
And Im standing in the darkness  
I dont want to wait no more  
  
Im a dweller on the threshold  
Dweller on the threshold  
Im a dweller on the threshold  
Im a dweller on the threshold
