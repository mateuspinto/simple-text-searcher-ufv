The sister of sunlight  
Comes to my lonely life  
Bearing the crosses I hung  
I hung on my lonely wife  
And the anchor told me  
If I prayed by the river  
That the sweet sound of water  
Would always go with her  
  
All across the havens to the waterfall  
They told me I would meet her there  
Inside those icy walls  
But how on earth in this universe  
Can they forgive me of my pains  
For all across the havens  
I must stumble locked in chains  
  
Then the mother of mercy  
Showed me her stable  
And told me you would be safe  
Safe in her cradle  
And the waterfall opened  
And the water withdrew  
Leaving me standing  
On a road leading through
