I found the bones of all your ghosts  
Locked in the wishing well  
While bird song gourmets dragged empty nets  
I slumbered in my shell  
In mitternacht die menschmaschine  
Kissed me on my eyes  
I rose and left the fireladies  
Glowing lonely in the night  
With all the pornographers  
Burning torches beneath the sea  
  
Chorus  
I want to be a machine  
I want to be a machine  
I want to be a machine  
I want to be a machine  
  
I stole a cathode face from newscasts  
And a crumbling fugue of songs  
From the reservoir of video souls  
In the lakes beneath my tongue  
In flesh of ash and silent movies  
I walked at boulevards again  
A nebula of unfinished creatures  
From the lifetimes of my friends  
I hope your innocence has depraved me  
  
Chorus  
  
Broadcast me scrambled clean  
Or free me from this flesh  
Let the armchair cannibals take their fill  
In every cell across wilderness  
Well trip such a strangled tango  
Well waltz a wonderland affair  
Lets run to meet the tide tomorrow  
Leave all emotion dying there  
In the star cold beyond all of your dreams  
  
Chorus  
Ah
