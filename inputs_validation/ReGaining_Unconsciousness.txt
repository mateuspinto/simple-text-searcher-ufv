First they put away the dealers keep our kids safe and off the street  
Then they put away the prostitutes keep married men cloistered at home  
Then they shooed away the bums then they beat and bashed the queers  
Turned away asylum seekers fed us suspicions and fears  
We didnt raise our voice we didnt make a fuss  
Its funny there was no one left to notice when they came for us  
  
Looks like witches are in season you better fly your flag and be aware  
Of anyone who might fit the description diversity is now our biggest fear  
Now with our conversations tapped and our differences exposed  
How ya supposed to love your neighbor with our minds and curtains closed  
We used to worry bout Big Brother now we got a big father and an even bigger
mother  
  
And you still believe this aristocracy gives a fuck about you  
They put the mock in democracy and you swallowed every hook  
The sad truth is you would rather follow the school into the net  
Cause swimming alone at sea is not the kind of freedom that you actually want  
So go back to your crib and suck on a tit go bask in the warmth of your diaper  
Youre sitting in shit and piss while sucking a huge pacifier a country of
adult infants  
A legion of mental midgets a country of adult infants a country of adult
infants  
All regaining their unconsciousness
