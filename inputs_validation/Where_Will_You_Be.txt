Where will you be when youre not here  
How many lives in this earth time  
You are my soul and this you are  
Two souls intertwined thats what we are  
  
We can we walk hand in hand  
All the life  
Be the one everything to me  
You I am dreaming  
We have lived and known before I feel it  
  
Where will you lie  
  
When will I know  
When you are gone  
Where I be and I will miss you  
We are this love in this life  
Two souls intertwined like once before  
See this meeting hand in hand  
Every life  
Be the one everything to me  
You are my feeling  
  
No need to fear this love of life  
We are the truth of every earth life  
No need to fear this life at all  
We are the sun and everlasting life  
Where will you be hearing this song  
How many lives in this earth time  
You are my soul and this you are  
You are my soul and this you are  
  
Where will you be
