One step nearer the edge  
And you take me so closer  
One step nearer the edge  
If I should fall will you throw me down your line  
Throw me Throw me Throw me  
You see when I fall I really go down  
And its so uneasying to think you are with me all the time  
Yes its so uneasying  
Are you really really with me all the time  
Will you pull me through the next time  
Will you lead me though the next time  
Will You pull me through the next time  
Will you lead me though the next time  
The next time  
The next time  
The next time  
The next time   
And Im one step nearer the edge  
And you take me so much so closer  
If I should fall will you throw me down your line  
Throw me Throw me Throw me  
You see if I fall I really go  
I go down I go down I go down  
Down down down  
repeat  
I go down  
Watch me go  
I go down  
to fade
