A river a mountain to be crossed  
The sunshine in mountains sometimes lost  
Around the south side so cold that we cried  
Were we ever colder on that day a million  
Miles away  
It seemed from all eternity  
  
Move forward was my friends only cry  
In deeper to somewhere we could lie  
And rest for the the day with cold in the way  
Were we ever colder on that day a million  
Miles away  
It seemed from all eternity  
  
The moments seemed lost in all the noise  
A snow storm a stimulating voice  
Of warmth of the sky of warmth when you die  
Were we ever warmer on that day a million  
Miles away  
We seemed from all eternity  
  
The sunshine in mountains sometimes lost  
The river can disregard the cost  
And melt in the sky warmth when you die  
Were we ever warmer on that day a million miles away  
We seemed from all of eternity
