Johnny Thunder lives on water feeds on lightning  
Johnny Thunder dont need no one dont want money  
And all the people of the town  
  
They cant get through to Johnny they will never ever break him down  
Johnny Thunder speaks for no one goes on fighting  
And sweet Helena in bed prays for Johnny  
  
Ba baba ba baba ba  
Ba baba ba baba ba  
  
Thunder and lightning  
  
Ba baba ba baba ba  
Ba baba ba baba ba  
  
Thunder and lightning  
Though everybody tried their best  
Old Johnny vowed that he would never ever end up like the rest  
Johnny Thunder rides the highway moves like lightning  
But sweet Helena just says God bless Johnny  
  
Ba baba ba baba ba  
Ba baba ba baba ba  
  
Thunder and lightning  
  
Ba baba ba baba ba  
Ba baba ba baba ba  
  
Thunder and lightning
