High on a hill was a lonely goatherd

A prince on the bridge of a castle moat heard  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl lay hee hoo  
Men on a road with a load to tote heard  
Lay ee odl lay ee odloo  
  
Men in the midst of a table dhote heard  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl lay hee hoo  
Men drinking beer with the foam afloat heard  
Lay ee odl lay ee odloo  
  
One little girl in a pale pink coat heard  
Lay ee odl lay ee odl lay hee hoo  
She yodeled back to the lonely goatherd  
Lay ee odl lay ee odloo  
  
Soon her Mama with a gleaming gloat heard
