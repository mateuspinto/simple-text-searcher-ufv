Another yaers gone by  
Since we said goodbye  
And I can hardly wait to have you come again  
Ive been living by the phone  
I keep your letters in my pillow case  
So I can hold you close pretend I am with you  
  
Everyday is pale and empty  
When youre not here with me  
I got your memory burnt into my brain  
I count the lonely nights until you touch me again  
My heart is pounding like an oncoming train  
  
I want to have you so bad  
You know its driving me mad  
And I cant hide the way I feel for you  
To feel your hand on my cheek  
To here the words that you speak  
My winter lover turn me red hot and blue  
My winter lover turn me red hot and blue  
  
I need to steal your time  
Play it over in my mind  
Hide your clothes behind the firelight  
Wrap me up inside your arms  
And every kiss will melt my lips apart  
Till the minutes stop and swallow up my heart  
  
When you go back to your world  
Does your head skip to me  
My head is swirling snow on my window pane  
I count the lonely nights until you mm Me again  
I love you just the way a moth loves her flame  
  
I want to have you so bad  
You know its driving me mad  
And I cant hide the way I feel for you  
To feel your hand on my cheek  
To hear the words that you speak  
My winter lover turn me red hot and blue  
My winter lover turn me red hot and blue  
  
 Another day another night  
I wish I may I wish I might  
The first star that I see tonight  
 Another day another night  
The broken watch thats on my counter  
Makes me think Im lost without ya  
 Another day another night  
  
I want to have you so bad  
You know its driving me mad  
And I cant hide the way I feel for you  
To feel your hand on my cheek  
To hear the words that you speak  
My winter lover turn me red hot and blue  
My winter lover turn me red hot and blue
