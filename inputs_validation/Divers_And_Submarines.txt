Well I clung to you  
Like cat hair clings to a woolen shirt  
You needed me like a wedding dress needs dirt  
The more that I wanted the harder I squeezed  
The harder I squeezed the less you could breathe  
And we sunk down to the bottom  
Yeah we sunk down to the bottom of the sea  
Yeah we sunk down to the bottom of the sea  
  
And I cried for you  
Like a widow cries at her lovers grave  
You haunted me through my stinging nights  
And aching days  
The more that you struggled the tighter the knots  
The tighter the knots the lower we got  
  
And we sunk down to the bottom  
Yeah we sunk down to the bottom of the sea  
Yeah we sunk down to the bottom of the sea  
Yeah we sunk down to the bottom of the sea  
Oh no  
Cause I saw divers and submarines  
And I saw divers and submarines  
Oh I saw divers and submarines
