I might be wrong  
I might be wrong  
I could have sworn I saw a light coming on  
  
I used to think  
I used to think  
There was no future left at all  
I used to think  
  
Start again begin again  
Lets go down the waterfall  
Think about the good times and never go back  
Never go back  
  
What would I do  
What would I do  
If I did not have you  
  
Open up let me in  
Lets go down the waterfall  
Have ourselves a good time  
Its nothing at all  
Nothing at all  
Nothing at all
