For years we both have lived on pride dear and we agree that love is gone  
  
Why oh why do we keep tryin a house without love is not a home  
  
The love light in your eyes has faded and Im contented just to roam  
  
We slaved to gain a worthless treasure a house without love is not a home  
  
 steel   
  
No matter where our footsteps wander I know well both be all alone  
  
With the pride that came between us a house without love is not a home  
  
The simple things have gone forever we wanted wealth to call our own  
  
Now weve reached the hour of parting a house without love is not a home
