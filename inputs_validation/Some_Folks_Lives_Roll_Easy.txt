Some folks lives roll easy as a breeze  
Drifting through a summer night  
Heading for a sunny day  
But most folks lives oh they stumble  
  
Lord they fall  
Through no fault of their own  
Most folks never catch their stars  
  
And here I am Lord  
Im knocking at your place of business  
I know I aint got no business here  
But you said if I ever got so low  
I was busted  
You could be trusted  
  
Some folks lives roll easy  
Some folks lives  
Never roll at all  
Oh they just fall  
They just fall  
Some folks lives
