People waiting for some kind of sign from above  
Lost in the shadows of doubt need a message of love  
Nothing is certain in uncertain times  
Hard to see beyond the greed and the crime  
  
Oh the faithful refuse to give up  
Homeless and hungry survive just enough  
Learn to smile through it all  
They are blessed from above  
  
Never stop believin change will come  
Theres a city of hope beyond our fears  
Where miracles happen where truth can be heard  
Dont you wanna go to the city of hope  
Founded on faith connecting us all  
A network of love to answer the call  
Yeah thats where I am from  
The city of hope  
  
On the edge of the world across oceans of blue  
Its a place where a dream has a chance to come true  
Dont be fooled by illusions or falling from grace  
Make your own destiny find your own place  
Where the streets beat the lessons of trouble open play  
  
Never stop believin change will come  
Theres a city of hope beyond our fears  
Where miracles happen where truth can be heard  
Dont you wanna go to the city of hope  
Founded on faith connecting us all  
A network of love to answer the call  
Yeah thats where I am from  
The city of hope  
  
I hear them whisper send in a prayer  
A cry to the spirit where they no longer wonder  
  
Never stop believin change will come  
Theres a city of hope beyond our fears  
Where miracles happen where truth can be heard  
Dont you wanna go to the city of hope  
  
Yeah thats where I am from  
The city of hope
