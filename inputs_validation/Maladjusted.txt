On this glorious occasionof the splendid defeat  
  
I want to start from  
Before the beginning  
Loot wine Be mine and  
Then lets stay out for the night  
Ride via Parkside  
Semiperilous lives  
Jeer the lights in the windows  
Of all safe and stable homes  
But wondering then well what  
Could peace of mind be like  
Anyway do you want to hear  
Our story or not  
As the Fulham Road lights  
Stretch and invite into the night  
From a Stevenage overspill  
Wed kill to live around  
SW6  with someone like you  
Keep thieves hours  
With someone like you  
As long as it slides  
You stalk the house  
In a lowcut blouse   
Oh Christ another stifled  
Friday night  
And the Fulham Road lights  
Stretch and invite into the night  
Well I was fifteen  
What could I know  
When the gulf between  
All the things I need  
And the things I receive  
Is an ancient ocean  
Wide wild lost uncrossed  
Still I maintain theres nothing  
Wrong with you  
You do all that you do  
Because its all you can do  
Well I was fifteen  
Where could I go  
With a soul full of loathing  
For stinging bureaucracy  
Making it anything  
Other than easy  
For working girls like me  
With my hands on my head  
I flop on your bed  
With a head full of dread  
For all Ive ever said  
Maladjusted maladjusted  
Maladjusted maladjusted  
Never to be trusted  
Oh never to be trusted  
Theres nothing wrong with you oh  
Theres nothing wrong with you oh  
Theres nothing wrong with you oh  
Theres nothing wrong with you  
Theres nothing wrong with you
