Black days for humanity  
Suffer the pain the futility  
Select few with immunity  
Not the case for the majority  
Eyes that pierce the world restrained  
Healthy will to reveal contained  
Questions search for truth remains  
What is it you wanna see  
What is it you wanna hear  
Control is all that it can be  
Control is what we all should fear  
What is it to be  
Is it life or authenticity  
Black is truth or is it white  
Kept in the dark cannot see the light  
Words of power start to infect  
Must see through must disconnect  
Word of truth we all elect  
If truth is dead then resurrect  
Green is all that they can see  
Their only link with reality  
Who controls the monopoly  
Exploitation done professionally  
What is it you wanna see  
What is it you wanna hear  
Control is all that it can be  
Control is what we all should fear  
What is it to be  
Is it life or authenticity  
Black is truth or is it white  
Kept in the dark cannot see the light
