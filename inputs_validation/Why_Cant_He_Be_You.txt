He takes me to the places you and I used to go  
He tells me over and over that he loves me so  
He gives me love that I never got from you  
He loves me too his love is true  
Why cant he be you  
He never fails to call and tell me Im on his mind  
And Im lucky to have such a guy I hear it all the time  
And he does all the things that you would never do  
He loves me too his love is true  
Why cant he be you  
Hes not the one who dominates my mind and soul  
And I should love him so cause he loves me I know  
But his kisses leave me cold  
He sends me flowers calls on the hour just to prove his love  
And my friends say when hes around that Im all he speaks of  
And he does all the things that you would never do  
He loves me too his love is true  
Why cant he be you  
Hes not the one who dominates my mind and soul  
And I should love him so cause he loves me I know  
But his kisses leave me cold  
He sends me flowers calls on the hour just to prove his love  
And my friends say when hes around Im all he speaks of  
And he does all the things that you would never do  
He loves me too his love is true  
Why cant he be you
