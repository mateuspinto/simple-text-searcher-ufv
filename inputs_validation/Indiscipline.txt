I do remember one thing  
It took hours and hours but  
By the time I was done with it  
I was so involved I didnt know what to think  
  
I carried it around with me for days and days  
Playing little games  
Like not looking at it for a whole day  
And then looking at it  
  
To see if I still liked it  
I did  
  
I repeat myself when under stress  
I repeat myself when under stress  
I repeat myself when under stress  
I repeat myself when under stress  
  
I repeat  
The more I look at it  
The more I like it  
I do think its good  
  
The fact is  
No matter how closely I study it  
No matter how I take it apart  
No matter how I break it down  
  
It remains consistent  
I wish you were here to see it  
  
I like it
