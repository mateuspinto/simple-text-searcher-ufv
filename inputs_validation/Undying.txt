Wake up baby daddys comin to crack your skull in two  
Hit you like a hammer baby down the play a fool  
  
No to the kicking  
No more to say  
No having just one meaning  
Nothing left to say  
No way  
  
Surface the anger  
Through immortality  
Should you be undying  
You never were undying  
  
Wake up break down daddys comin all you heard is true  
So bite your lip and shut your mouth its no longer up to you  
  
No to the licking  
No more to say  
No leavin you alone  
Nothing more to say  
No way no  
  
Surface the anger  
Immortality  
Should you be undying  
Undying  
  
No for give ness  
No more To say  
No way no  
  
Surface the anger  
Immortality  
You never were undying  
Undying  
Undying never be undying  
You never were undying  
You never seem undying  
How can you be undying
