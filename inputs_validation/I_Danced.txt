  
  
I danced before I had two feet  
  
Sang before I had a tongue  
  
I laughed before I had two eyes  
  
Loved before my heart was young  
  
I swam before I had two hands  
  
and held the distance in my toes  
  
Before I heard the stars I knew  
  
the wild compulsion of the rose  
  
I bore the fruits of many lies  
  
Before I came into this day  
  
I knew before my grave was made  
  
the worms eat only death away  
  
the worms eat only death away  
  
I danced before I had two feet  
  
I danced before I had two feet  
  
I danced before I had two feet  
  
I danced before I had two feet
