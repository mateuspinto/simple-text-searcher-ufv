On the silent wings of freedom  
Where I offer myself midst the balancing of the sun  
On the winds of celestial seasons  
That would carry me on midst the balance of being one  
On the dream of our love eternal  
That will eventually bring our living once more with you  
  
Where we are coming from  
Or where we go  
We only know e come with sound  
  
Where we are coming from  
Or where we go  
We only know we go around and around  
  
On the back of your fortysecond screamdown  
Do you choose to be lost midst the challenge of being one  
On the flight of regardless feelings  
As you hurtle to fear midst the challenge of everyone  
  
On the darkest night so painful  
Do you hunger for love midst the torture of being one  
On the passing light of easing  
Have you seen you inside midst the being of everyone  
To the common goal of freedom  
Where we offer ourselves midst the balancing of the sun  
  
Where we are coming from  
Or where we go  
We only know we come with sound  
  
Where we are coming from  
Or where we go  
We only know we go around and around
