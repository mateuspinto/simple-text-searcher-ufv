White summer  
So far I have gone to see you again  
Hiding your face in the palm of your hands  
Finding solace in the words I do despise  
You snatch at every sound  
And even though you believe that I am shackled within death  
Memories are tainted with paleness  
Crestfallen still  
Those eyes empty like a barren well  
It was the only task I would undertake  
To reap the harvest that was mine  
The seed that had sprung into a florid meadow  
And left me helpless in your embrace  
The bond we never spoke of once stark and enticing  
Now slowly smoldering to dust  
The celestial touch from grey to black  
A fathomless void enclosing  
Unwritten secrets beneath the cobwebs  
I can not endure And so I rose from my sleep  
The moon turned away its face  
Overture of the long black night begins  
Something you said Eerie circles upon the waters  
Until now we have shared the same aura  
My ashes within your hands  
My breath in the sepulchral mound  
You know that your night is my day  
The final spark that blew life into me  
The demon of the fall
