I want a love thats right but right is only half of whats wrong  
I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long  
Now Im stepping out this old brown shoe baby Im in love with you  
Im so glad you came here it wont be the same now Im telling you  
  
You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down  
And when I see your smile replace every thoughtless frown  
Got me escaping from this zoo baby Im in love with you  
Im so glad you came here it wont be the same now when Im with you  
  
If I grow up Ill be a singer wearing rings on every finger  
Not worrying what they or you say Ill live and love and maybe someday  
Who knows baby you may comfort me  
I may appear to be imperfect my love is something you cant reject  
Im changing faster than the weather if you and me should get together  
Who knows baby you may comfort me  
  
That love of your to miss that love is something Id hate  
Ill make an early start Im making sure that Im not late  
For you sweet top lip Im in the queue baby Im in love with you  
Im so glad you came here it wont be the same now when Im with you  
Im so glad you came here it wont be the same now when Im with you
