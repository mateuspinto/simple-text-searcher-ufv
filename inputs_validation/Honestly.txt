Could you love somebody like that  
Could you attract someone like that  
Could you go where people cant see someone like me  
Could you do that  
  
Would you face me  
Make me listen to the truth even if it breaks me  
You can judge me love me  
If youre hating me  
Do it honestly  
  
All I see are Stepfordlike lives  
Needles and knives  
Beautiful lies  
Bringing out the green in your eyes  
A perfect disguise for envy and pride  
  
Face me  
Make me listen to the truth  
Even if it breaks me  
You can judge me love me  
  
If youre hating me  
do it honestly  
  
You can tell me  
You can tell me  
You can tell me  
You can tell me  
You can tell me  
  
Face me  
Make me listen to the truth  
Even if it breaks me  
You can judge me love me  
If youre hating me  
  
Would you face me  
Make me listen to the truth even if it breaks me  
Judge me love me  
If youre hating me  
Do it honestly  
  
You can tell me  
You can tell me  
You can tell me  
You can tell me  
  
Do it honestly  
  
You can tell me  
You can tell me  
You can tell me  
You can tell me
