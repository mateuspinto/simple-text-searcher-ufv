Little by little the night turns around  
Counting the leaves which tremble and turn  
Lotuss lean on each other in union  
Over the hills where a swallow is resting  
Set the controls for the heart of the sun  
  
Over the mountain watching the watcher  
Breaking the darkness waking the grapevine  
Morning to birth is born into shadow  
Love is the shadow that ripens the wine  
Set the controls for the heart of the sun  
The heart of the sun the heart of the sun  
  
Who is the man who arrives at the wall  
Making the shape of his questions at asking  
Thinking the sun will fall in the evening  
Will he remember the lesson of giving  
Set the controls for the heart of the sun  
The heart of the sun the heart of the sun
