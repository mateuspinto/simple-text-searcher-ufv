Im running on a dusty road  
The evil one behind me  
I hear his breath and turn around  
Theres no place left to hide here  
  
Wanna break the chains of fear  
Theres no way back  
Your whisper in my ear  
Your touch will save me again  
  
Youll change my dream  
Youll guide my way to be  
You are the light  
You turn black into white  
  
Youll change my dream  
Youll bring reality  
You shine so bright  
You turn black into white  
  
Ive lost my soul in the game he plays  
No doubt that he wont spare me  
Hunting me trapped in his chase  
Subject to violation  
  
Im afraid to fall asleep  
Whether day and night  
But once Im there in my dreams  
Youll come to save me again  
  
Youll change my dream  
Youll guide my way to be  
You are the light  
You turn black into white  
  
Youll change my dream  
Youll bring reality  
You shine so bright  
You turn black into white  
  
Youll change my dream  
Youll steer my way to be  
You are the light  
You turn black into white  
  
Youll change my dream  
Youll bring reality  
You are the light  
First star I see tonight
