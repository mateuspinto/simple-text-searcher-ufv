Saved by this parade of passion was my company  
Gave my life for next to nothing a sane artillery

Gave my heart like fate was nothing a sane reality  
Is one that wishes never never what is reality  
Show me show me show me

Kiss the boy and then employ a very white disguise  
Who had asked you to consider you are not so fly  
In the city they will snigger ask them why  
  
Saved by this parade of passion was my company  
Gave my life for next to nothing a sane artillery  
Is one that kisses 2 be clever who is the enemy  
Its not me not me no not you not me  
Its not you not me no not you then who
