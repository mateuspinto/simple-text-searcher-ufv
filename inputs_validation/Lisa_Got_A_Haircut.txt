Verse 1  
Lisa got a haircut  
Another one today  
She stuck a pair of scissors up her butt  
And now she cries all day  
  
Chorus  
From a mohawk to a mullet  
From shaved head to a bullet  
She chops off her hair  
But I dont really care  
She had hair down to her underwear  
She even grew a beard  
But most guys werent impressed with that  
They all thought that was weird  
  
Verse 2  
She started changing colour  
A new one everyday  
Last week she had it purple  
All the kids thought that was lame  
  
Chorus  
From a mohawk to a mullet  
From shaved head to a bullet  
She chops off her hair  
But I dont really care  
She had hair down to her underwear  
She even grew a beard  
But most guys werent impressed with that  
They all thought that was weird  
  
Verse 3  
Lisa is a maniak  
She cut off all her hair  
She even had her tounge pierced  
And tatooed ugly stare  
  
Chorus  
From a mohawk to a mullet  
From shaved head to a bullet  
She chops off her hair  
But I dont really care  
She had hair down to her underwear  
She even grew a beard  
But most guys werent impressed with that  
They all thought that was weird  
  
Bridge  
But the boys in the back dont think shes very pretty  
And the guys in the front will always call her witty  
But when youve got a hair cut that really looks that shitty  
Its no doubt theyd probably spit on both your mittys  
  
Chorus  
From a mohawk to a mullet  
From shaved head to a bullet  
She chops off her hair  
But I dont really care  
She had hair down to her underwear  
She even grew a beard  
But most guys werent impressed with that  
They all thought that was weird  
  
They all thought that was weird x3
