Castles in the air  
Dreamers everywhere  
Building castles in the air  
Like dreamers everywhere  
  
If you asked me as a child  
If I knew what I would be  
Today  
I would give you a reply  
Convinced of my destiny  
True to this day  
  
Music music my first love  
Music I love  
Youre all all all All that I dream of  
Labour of my love  
  
If you want to know how it feels  
Look into the eyes of a child  
At play  
I make no excuse for my life  
Cause I believe I believe I believe  
To dream is the way
