In the winter when the cold comes  
And the wind blows with a scornful spite  
And the hard ground feels barren  
And the forest is deathly quiet  
And the whole world lies sleeping  
Theres a gypsy all dressed in white  
Put my hand out ask the question  
Heres the silver do you have the gift of sight  
  
Can you break the spell  
Can you ring the bell  
Can you break the spell  
Its cold black as night  
Ive got a hard heart  
Since weve been apart  
Can you break the spell  
Break it all down tonight  
  
In the springtime when the floods come  
And the earth bursts with the terrible life  
And the sun splash on the windows  
Theres a gypsy and hes all dressed in white  
My heart burns with the question  
Can you break the spell  
Still hot as fire  
  
Can you break the spell  
Can you ring the bell  
Can you break the spell  
Its cold black as night  
Cold black as night
