She cant love me I cant love her  
Cause they say were the wrong color  
Staring gloating laughing looking  
Like weve done something wrong  
Because we show love strong get real come on  
Calling us names too bad to mention  
But we pay them no attention  
For color blind are inner feelings  
If we feel happiness  
And know our loves the best forget their mess
