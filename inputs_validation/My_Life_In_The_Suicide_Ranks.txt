My life my life in the suicide ranks  
My life my life in the suicide ranks  
My life my life in the suicide ranks  
My life my life in the suicide ranks  
My life my life in the suicide ranks  
My life my life in the suicide ranks  
  
I used to call it  
Are you still precious  
Love for your mother  
Wine on the carpet  
All in the breaks of dawn  
Youll find the widest while you came  
That let the dress  
  
My life my life in the suicide ranks  
My life my life in the suicide ranks  
My life my life in the suicide ranks  
Love me like a child no one tells me why  
My life my life in the suicide ranks  
My life my life in the suicide ranks  
  
My life my life in the suicide ranks  
My life my life in the suicide ranks  
  
Whoah thank you for the help but  
Well the high road is the low road  
Tell me what do you think this is  
Who know better all of a talk  
  
 or the crow  
Will you hold me will you shake me  
Will you think youre all alone  
Well you dont look for your health in the color of your skin  
I open up let the darkness come in  
  
My life my life in the suicide ranks  
My life my  ooh  
  
 the suffering
