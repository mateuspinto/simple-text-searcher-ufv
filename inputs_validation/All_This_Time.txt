I remember the first time I held you all night long  
Well were still here now  
But where have all the years gone  
Holding you this way tonight  
Its easy to see why  
  
Chorus  
All this time  
We held on to each other  
We knew we had to be strong  
All this time  
Through the tears and the laughter  
Its still forever after all this time  
  
In the fast movin world  
Love is made and just thrown away  
But weve always kept the promises that we made  
Who would of thought you and me  
Would still be here where we said we would be  
  
Chorus x2
