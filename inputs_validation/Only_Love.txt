You may live alone and close your eyes  
Some folks do  
You may dream a dream thats twice your size  
All night through  
When the morning comes whos to tell your dreams to  
Only you  
  
Chorus  
Only love love only only love  
Will do  
Only love love only only love  
Comes true  
Nothing else you see there nothing else  
Only love only love  
  
I have known a love within my heart  
One or two  
Where one love would end and one would start  
I never knew  
If love should come your way youll learn to say  
I love you I love you  
  
Chorus x 2
