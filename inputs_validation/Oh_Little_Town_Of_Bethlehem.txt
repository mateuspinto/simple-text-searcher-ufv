Oh little town of Bethlehem  
How still we see thee lie  
Above thy deep and dreamless  
Sleep the silent stars go by  
Yet in they dark streets shineth  
The everlasting light  
The hopes and fears of all  
The years are met in thee tonight  
  
For Christ is born of Mary  
And gathered all above  
While mortals sleep  
The angels keep  
Their watch of wondering love  
Oh morning stars together  
Proclaim the Holy birth  
And praises sing  
To God the King  
And peace to men on Earth  
  
How silently how silently  
The wondrous gift is given  
So God imparts to human hearts  
The blessings of his heaven  
No ear may hear his coming  
But in this world of sin  
Where meek souls  
Will receive him still  
The dear Christ enters in  
  
Oh holy child of Bethlehem  
Descend to us we pray  
Cast out our sin and enter in  
Be born in us today  
We hear the christmas angels  
The great glad tidings tell  
O come to us abide with us  
Our Lord Emanuel
