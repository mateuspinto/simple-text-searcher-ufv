Where do we go from here  
Where do we go from here where do we go from here  
Where do we go from here where do we go from here  
  
They boarded up the synagogues Uzis on a street corner  
You cant take a photograph of Uzis on a street corner  
The DJ resigned today they wouldnt let him have his say  
Surface scratched where the needles play Uzis on a street corner  
Where do we go from here  
Terror in Rue de St Denis murder on the periphery  
Someone else in someone elses pocket  
Christ knows I dont know how to stop it  
Poppies at the cenotaph the cynics cant afford to laugh  
I heard in on the telegraph theres Uzis on a street corner  
  
Where do we go from here where do we go from here  
  
The more I see the more I hear the more I find fewer answers  
I close my mind I shout it out but you know its getting harder  
To calm down to reason out to come to terms with what its all about  
Im uptight cant sleep at night I cant pretend everythings all right  
My ideals my sanity they seem to be deserting me  
But to stand up and fight I know we have six million reasons  
  
Theyre burning down the synagogues Uzis on a street corner  
The heralds of the holocaust Uzis on a street corner  
The silence never louder than now how quickly we forgot our vows  
This resurrection we cant allow Uzis on a street corner  
  
Where do we go from here where do we go from here  
  
We buy fresh bagels from the corner store  
Where swastikas are spat from aerosols  
I sit in the bar sipping iced White Russian  
Trying to score but nobodys pushing  
And everyone looks at everyones faces  
Searching for signs and praying for traces of a conscience in residence  
Are we sitting on a barbed wire fence  
Racing the clouds home racing the clouds home  
  
We place our faith in human rights  
In the paper wars that tie the red tape tight  
I know that I would rather be out of this conspiracy  
In the gulags and internment camps frozen faces in nameless ranks  
I know that they would rather be standing here besides me  
Racing the clouds home racing the clouds home  
  
You can shut your eyes you can hide it away its gonna come back another  
day  
Racing the clouds home are we racing the clouds home  
Racing the clouds home
