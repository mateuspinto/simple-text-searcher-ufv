Fools rush in where angels fear to tread  
And so I come to you my love my heart above my head  
Though I see the danger there  
If theres a chance for me then I dont care  
  
Mmm mmm mmm mmm  
  
Fools rush in where wise men never go  
But wise men never fall in love so how are they to know  
When we met I felt my life begin  
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in  
  
Fools rush in where wise men never never never go  
Eh but wise men never fall in love so how are they to know  
Ah when we met girl I felt my life begin  
So open up your heart and let this fool rush in  
  
Just open up your heart and let this fool rush on in  
Just open up your heart because I I I I I I I am coming in  
Open up your heart and let this fool rush in
