Hot cherry on Friday night  
When the sun goes down my spine  
I put an axe in my babys head  
Im gonna end up doing time  
  
She looks so good in red  
American nightmare running scared  
  
She shoulda been hard to get  
She shoulda been hard to kill  
She shoulda been hard to kill hey  
  
I had to split your head  
American nighmare running scared  
  
Im heading down the highway  
Sign has three inverted nines  
If the lord dont get me the devil will  
But not without a fight  
  
Does this highway never fucking ends  
American nightmare running scared  
American nightmare running scared  
  
Im heading down the highway  
Sign has three inverted nines  
If the lord dont get me the devil will  
But not without a fight  
  
This highway never fucking ends  
American nightmare running scared  
Hey American nightmare running scared
