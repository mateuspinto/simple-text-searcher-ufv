Each day through my window  
I watch him as he passes by  
I say to myself What an incredible guy  
To have a love like that  
Must surely be a dream come true  
Out of all the women in the world  
He belongs to only you  
  
But it was just my imagination  
Runnin away with me  
It was just my imagination  
Runnin away with me  
  
Soon well be married  
And raise a family  
A cozy little home out in the country  
With two kids or three  
  
I tell you I can visualize it all  
This couldnt be a dream  
How real it all seems  
  
Ohh but it was just my imagination once again  
Runnin away with me  
Tell you it was just my imagination  
Runnin away with me  
  
Every night on my knees I pray  
Dear Lord hear my plea  
Dont ever let another take his love from me  
Or I will surely surely die  
  
His love is heavenly  
When his arms enfold me  
I hear a tender rhapsody  
But in reality  
He doesnt even know me  
  
Once again  
Runnin away with me  
Ohh just my imagination  
Runnin away with me  
  
It was just my imagination  
Runnin away with me  
It was just my imagination  
Running away with me  
  
Just my imagination  
Runnin away with me
