When the only tool you have is a hammer  
Everything looks like a nail  
And youre living at the Bittersweet Motel  
When the only tool you have is a hammer  
Everything looks like a nail  
And youre living at the Bittersweet Motel  
Halfway between Erie and Pittsburgh  
You put me through hell  
On the highway to the Bittersweet Motel  
Halfway between Erie and Pittsburgh  
You put me through hell  
On the highway to the Bittersweet Motel  
When the only tool you have is a hammer  
Everything looks like a nail  
And youre living at the Bittersweet Motel
