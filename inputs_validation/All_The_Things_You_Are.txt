You are the promised kiss of springtime  
That makes the lonely winter seem long  
You are the breathless hush of evening  
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song  
  
You are the angel glow that lights a star  
The dearest things I know are what you are  
  
Some day my happy arms will hold you  
And some day Ill know that moment divine  
When all the things you are are mine  
  
You are the angel glow that lights a star  
The dearest things I know are what you are  
  
Some day my happy arms will hold you  
And some day Ill know that moment divine  
When all the things you are are mine
