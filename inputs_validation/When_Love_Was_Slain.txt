This world is not my home  
Oh this world is not my home  
My homes been made at heavens throne  
This world is not my home  
This life is not my own  
Oh this life is not my own  
I am His and His alone  
This life is not my own  
  
Chorus  
I was bought when Love was slain  
What I cost to pay deaths wage  
Now ransomed I am freedoms slave  
My Jesus raised me from the grave  
  
Come now and walk with me  
Oh come now and walk with me  
Together we and Lord shall meet  
Come now and walk with me  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Soon Lord very soon  
Oh soon Lord oh very soon  
Youll come take me to be with You  
Soon Lord very soon  
Soon Lord oh very soon
