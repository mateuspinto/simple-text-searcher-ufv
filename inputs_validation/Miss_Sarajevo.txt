Is there a time for keeping a distance  
A time to turn your eyes away  
Is there a time for keeping your head down  
For getting on with your day  
  
Is there a time for Kohl and lipstick  
A time for cutting hair  
Is there a time for high street shopping  
To find the right dress to wear  
  
Here she comes  
Heads turn around  
Here she comes  
To take her crown  
  
Is there a time to walk for cover  
A time for kiss and tell  
Is there a time for different colors  
Different names you find it hard to spell  
  
Is there a time for first communion  
A time for east 17  
Is there a time to turn the mecca  
Is there a time to be a beauty queen  
  
Here she comes  
Beauty plays the crown  
Here she comes  
Surreal in her crown  
  
Dici che il fiume  
trova la via al mare  
E come il fiume  
giungerai a me  
Oltre i confini  
e le terre assetate  
Dici che come fiume  
come fiume  
Lamore giunger  
Lamore  
E non so pi pregare  
E nellamore non so pi sperare  
E quellamore non so pi aspettare  
  
English translation  
You say that the river  
finds the way to the sea  
And as the river  
youll come to me  
Beyond the borders  
and the thirsty lands  
You say that as river  
As river  
Love will come  
Love  
And I cannot pray anymore  
And I cannot hope in love anymore  
And I cannot wait for love anymore  
  
Is there a time for tying ribbons  
A time for Christmas trees  
Is there a time for laying tables  
When the night is set to freeze
