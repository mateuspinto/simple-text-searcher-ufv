Pieces of a hole  
Unrequited not renowned  
Never sought and never found  
Through blood  
Through soul  
  
Now unfamiliar  
Feelings of good being  
Are light thats not worth seeing  
Through blood  
Through soul  
  
Restless and distorted  
Thoughts that underscore my night  
Being wrong and seeing right  
Through blood  
Through soul  
  
Heart beyond repair  
All the edges worn and frayed  
Magnifying love betrayed  
Through blood  
Through soul
