What now my love  
Now that you left me  
How can I live through another day  
Watching my dreams turn into ashes  
And all my hopes into bits of clay  
Once I could see once I could feel  
Now I am numb  
Ive become unreal  
  
I walk the night oh without a goal  
Stripped of my heart my soul  
What now my love  
Now that its over  
I feel the world closing in on me  
Here come the stars  
Tumbling around me  
And theres the sky where the sea should be  
  
What now my love  
Now that youre gone  
Id be a fool to go on and on  
No one would care no one would cry  
If I should live or die  
  
What now my love  
Now there is nothing  
Only my last goodbye  
Only my last goodbye
