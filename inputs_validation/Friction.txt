Verse 1  
Get down with the victim  
We both know you need them  
Youre stuck in the middle  
Of all irrelevance  
And your heart is beating  
Cause you know that you gotta  
Get out of the middle  
And rise to the top now  
  
PreChorus x2  
When youve made it  
Wont ya tell me what to do  
Cause Im playin it all wrong  
  
Chorus  
You cant fight the friction So ease it off  
Cant take the pressure So ease it off  
Dont tell me to be strong Ease it off  
You cant fight the friction  
So ease it off  
  
Verse 2  
And get into the system  
We both know you need one  
The tip of the needle  
Is taking over you  
And your heart is beating  
Cause you know that you gotta  
Get out of the middle  
And rise to the top now  
  
PreChorus x2  
When youve made it  
Wont ya tell me what to do  
Cause Im playin it all wrong  
  
Chorus  
You cant fight the friction So ease it off  
Cant take the pressure So ease it off  
Dont tell me to be strong Ease it off  
You cant fight the friction  
So ease it off  
  
Bridge  
Why cant you let go  
Like a bird in the snow  
This is no place to build your home  
  
Chorus x2  
You cant fight the friction So ease it off  
Cant take the pressure So ease it off  
Dont tell me to be strong Ease it off  
You cant fight the friction  
So ease it off
