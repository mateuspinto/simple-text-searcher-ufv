Breathe on me  
In my brokenness  
Cover me  
With Your holiness  
  
Whisper words of hope  
And let me know  
In all Im going through  
You will carry me and not let go  
And Youll hide my heart in You  
  
All I see  
Is something that is beautiful  
Takes my breath away  
The treasures of  
The Fathers heart are bountiful  
In this Heavenly place  
  
So much love  
Flowing free from You  
Bdoundless grace  
Overwhelming me  
Let me do the work Youve called me to  
And to never walk away  
To live a life that pleases You  
And glorifies You name  
  
And I will look forward to  
This endless day  
I will lift my voice  
In endless praise
