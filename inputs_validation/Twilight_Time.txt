Twilight time to dream awhile  
In veils of deepening blue  
As fantasy strides over colourfull skies  
Of form disappearing from view  
  
In twilight time dream with me awhile  
  
A nightingale plays a dark mellow phrase  
Of notes that are rich and so true  
An aerial display by the firefly brigade  
Dancing to tunes no one knew  
  
In twilight time dream with me awhile  
In twilight time dream with me awhile  
  
Building castles in the air  
Whistling to the wind  
As nature bows down her head  
See what tomorrow brings  
  
In twilight time dream with me awhile  
  
Bats take to wing like puppets on string  
Prancing through cool evening air  
In a sightless glide no reason to hide  
Away from the suns blinding stare  
  
In twilight time dream with me awhile  
In twilight time dream with me awhile
