Death is everywhere  
There are flies on the windscreen  
For a start  
Reminding us  
We could be torn apart  
Tonight  
  
Death is everywhere  
There are lambs for the slaughter  
Waiting to die  
And I can sense  
The hours slipping by  
Tonight  
  
Come here  
Kiss me  
Now  
Come here  
Kiss me  
Now  
  
Death is everywhere  
The more I look  
The more I see  
The more I feel  
A sense of urgency  
Tonight  
  
Come here touch me  
Kiss me touch me  
Now touch me  
touch me  
  
There are flies on the windscreen  
There are lambs for the slaughter  
There are flies on the windscreen  
  
Come here touch me  
Kiss me touch me  
Now touch me  
touch me  
Come here touch me  
Kiss me touch me  
Now touch me  
touch me
