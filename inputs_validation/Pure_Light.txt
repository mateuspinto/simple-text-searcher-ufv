O to see You as You are  
To glimpse the wonderst yet unseen  
Assist my sight unveil my eyes  
To see You  
Lord to know You as You are  
To even dare to speak or stand  
Though marked beloved to fall as dead  
When I see You  
And through grace untold to see You  
With this heart unveiled to know You  
Lord in Your pure light  
How great the glory of Your name  
How small the voice I humbly bring  
Yet with my all I raise a song  
When I see You  
It is the song of loves pure light  
The grace reflected in these eyes  
The overflow of those who know  
They have seen You  
We are disgraced but You graced us  
With the warmth of Your forgiveness  
Now You lead us ever closer  
To the pure light of Your holiness  
And Ill sing of the wonders of Your grace  
Sing of the wonders of Your grace  
Sing of the wonders of Your grace O Lord  
And Ill tell of the glory of Your name  
Tell of the glory of Your name  
Tell of the glory of Your name O Lord
