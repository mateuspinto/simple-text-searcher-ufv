Jesse rides through the night  
Under the Main Street light  
Ridin slow  
  
This ol town aint the same  
Now nobody knows his name  
Times have changed still he rides  
  
Traffic lights keepin time  
Leading the wild and restless  
Through the night  
  
Chorus  
Still they ride on wheels of fire  
They rule the night  
Still they ride the strong will survive  
Chasing thunder  
  
Spinning round in a spell  
Its hard to leave this carousel  
Round and round  
And round and round  
  
Chorus
