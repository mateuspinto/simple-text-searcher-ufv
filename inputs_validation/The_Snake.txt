Join us come and join us  
Join us come and join us  
  
There is a path thats crystal clear  
It guides the wise away from here  
In summers hazy atmosphere  
Or wintertime  
  
The more the merrier they say  
The moors stretch out along the way  
By glow of night by light of day  
Just read the signs  
  
Til we can see the smoke rise in the distance  
Reminding us of home not far behind  
Careering through the path of least resistance  
Were going on a journey of the mind  
  
From the town to the country  
From the country to the town  
  
Come and join us  
Come and join us  
From the valley to the hillside  
From the upside to the down  
  
Join us come and join us  
A rush along a zigzag road  
Surprised the damned by mouth of toad  
A shop where you cannot reload  
  
The way to Hyde the sixtytwo or six two eight  
Will do if you cannot be late  
Sometimes the only choice to make  
In wintertime  
  
We gaze upon the face of the Apollo  
We know that we approach our journeys end  
And still we will be home before tomorrow  
But we will rise before we must descend  
  
From the town to the country  
From the country to the town  
  
Come and join us  
Come and join us  
From the valley to the hillside  
From the upside to the down  
  
Join us come and join us  
From the town to the country  
From the country to the town  
  
Come and join us  
Come and join us  
From the valley to the hillside  
From the upside to the down  
  
Join us come and join us  
We hear the bells we hear the bells  
We hear the bells we hear the bells  
We hear the bells we hear the bells  
Theyre ringing low we hear the bells  
  
Join us we hear the bells  
We hear the bells we hear the bells  
We hear the bells come and join us  
We hear the bells we hear the bells  
Theyre ringing low we hear the bells  
Come to the valley  
  
Join us we hear the bells  
We hear the bells come to the valley  
Come and join us we hear the bells  
We hear the bells come to the valley  
Come and join us we hear the bells  
We hear the bells theyre ringing low  
  
From the town to the country  
From the country to the town  
Come and join us come and join us  
From the valley to the hillside  
From the upside to the down  
  
Join us come and join us  
From the town to the country  
From the country to the town  
  
Join us come and join us  
From the valley to the hillside  
From the upside to the down  
  
Join us come and join us
