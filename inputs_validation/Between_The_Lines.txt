Lovely disguise read between the lines  
You rock the magic plane with no abbreviation  
Three four you sell what you bought  
And there aint no magic pen to get back what you lost  
  
I like it when we talk about love  
  
I like it when we talk about love  
You always were my favorite drug  
Even when we used to take drugs  
  
Even when we used to take  
Even when we used to take  
Even when we used to take  
Even when we used to take  
  
Penguins dont fly  
Crocodile Sunday smile  
Really like to fish but dont like superficial people  
Shoe store heard it all before  
From pearly whites to pearly gates  
What do we have to argue bout  
  
I like it when we talk about love  
I like it when we talk about love  
You always were my favorite drug  
Even when we used to take drugs  
  
Even when we used to take  
Even when we used to take  
Even when we used to take  
Even when we used to take  
  
Leave me all alone before  
Get out the way  
Never did what she was told  
Get out the way  
Seems to play at time of war  
Get out the way  
Less is big and listens more
