Remember everything I told you  
Keep it in your heart like a stone  
And when the winds have blown things round and back again  
What was once your pain will be your home  
  
All around the table the white haired men have gathered  
Spilling their sons blood like table wine  
Remember everything I told you  
Everything in its own time  
  
The music whispers you in urgency  
Hold fast to that languageless connection  
A thread of known that was unknown and unseen seen  
Dangling from inside the fifth direction  
  
Boys around the table mapping out their strategies  
Kings of mountains one day dust  
A lesson learned a loving God and things in their own time  
In nothing more do I trust  
  
But we own nothing nothing is ours  
Not even love so fierce it burns like baby stars  
But this poverty is our greatest gift  
The weightlessness of us as things around begin to shift  
  
Remember everything I told you  
Keep it in your heart like a stone  
And when the winds have blown things round and back again  
What was once your pain will be your home  
  
Everything in its own time  
Everything in its own time
