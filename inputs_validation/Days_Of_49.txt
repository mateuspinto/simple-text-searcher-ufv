Im old Tom Moore from the bummers shore in that good old golden days  
They call me a bummer and a gin shot too but what cares I for praise   
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign  
And all the people say There goes Tom Moore in the days of 49  
In the days of old in the days of gold  
How oft times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold in the days of 49  
  
My comrades they all loved me well a jolly saucy crew  
A few hard cases I will recall though they all were brave and true  
Whatever the pitch they never would flinch they never would fret or whine  
Like good old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of 49  
In the days of old in the days of gold  
How oft times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold in the days of 49  
  
There was New York Jake the butcher boy he was always getting tight  
And every time that hed get full he was spoiling for a fight  
But Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein  
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of 49  
In the days of old in the days of gold  
How oft times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold in the days of 49  
  
There was Poker Bill one of the boys who was always in a game  
Whether he lost or whether he won to him it was always the same  
He would ante up and draw his cards and he would you go a hatful blind  
In the game with death Bill lost his breath in the days of 49  
In the days of old in the days of gold  
How oft times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold in the days of 49  
  
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo I never will forget  
He would roar all day and hed roar all night and I guess hes roaring yet  
One day he fell in a prospect hole in a roaring bad design  
And in that hole he roared out his soul in the days of 49  
In the days of old in the days of gold  
How oft times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold in the days of 49  
  
Of the comrades all that Ive had theres none thats left to boast  
And Im left alone in my misery like some poor wandering ghost  
And I pass by from town to town they call me a rambling sign  
There goes Tom Moore a bummer shore in the days of 49   
In the days of old in the days of gold  
How oft times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold in the days of 49
