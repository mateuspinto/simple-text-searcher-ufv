Playing pool and drinking beer  
Nothin moren the  
Occasional tear  
But this mans life goes on  
And he gets  
Greased all over  
From time to time  
At the strip joint where we met  
He said Hi my name is Ted  
See that one over there  
That ball of thunder  
Every time she goes Vavoom  
I wiggle in my chair  
Can I buy you a beer  
What a guy  
  
Ive had a few myself he said  
But I never quit when Im ahead  
Too many rules and regulations  
Stupid laws designed by fools behind closed doors  
And another thing I wont discuss is religion  
It always causes a fight  
Vavoom  
There she goes again  
How does she do that said Ted  
  
And he told me  
Of those unjustices that  
He had suffered in his life  
His wife and kids  
And boss and dogs  
And neighbors  
Raising cain and causing strife  
They were forever whining  
Bleating howling yapping screeching moaning crying  
Vavoom  
He fed them well  
He keep them warm  
  
Thing about Ted  
He didnt really care  
Nothing much got in his hair  
And the beauty of it was  
That he was right  
He was big as a truck  
And fast as a door  
whats that  
He was always right  
  
The banjo player took a hike  
Whats that song  
I used to like  
Vavoom  
He was big as a truck  
Fast as a door  Ted  
Ted the man our Ted
