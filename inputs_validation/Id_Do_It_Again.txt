A one man band on a one night stand  
As a one man band should be  
The cried for more he replied why sure  
And he played one just for free  
The sounds he laid down the songs he played  
Made the ladies all come to call  
He was born in the back of a Seminole bus  
On the road to Niagara Falls  
  
Id do it again Id do it again  
Id do it again  
  
The one man band philosophical man  
Didnt lie when he said to us  
I seen the high rollers come and go  
Its the holy rollers I trust  
The man said then he was sixteen when  
He retired from the county school  
A wee bit thin with a will to begin  
He was known to be know mans fool  
  
Id do it again Id do it again  
Id do it again  
  
The one man band was a mighty good man  
Cause he played til the break of dawn  
He ups and downs about four more rounds  
And he stayed til the crowd went home  
It seemed to me like he never could be  
Like anything Id ever seen before  
When he stepped from the stage  
With his ax in his hand  
And he run through the backstage door  
  
Id do it again Id do it again  
Id do it again  
  
A one man band on a one night stand  
As a one man band should be  
They cried for more he replied why sure  
And he played one just for free
