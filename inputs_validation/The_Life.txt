It was early one morning  
Playa del Carmen  
Thats when I first met Jose  
He had a 12 foot Schooner  
A 3 foot cooler  
Full of the catch of the day  
And he was wrinkled from grinning  
From all of the sun he had been in  
He was barefoot cerveza in hand  
He said Gracias senor when I paid him too much for  
All of the Snapper he had  
Now I told him my friend it aint nothing  
In the best broken Spanish I knew  
I said I make a good living  
Back home where Im from  
He smiled and said Amigo me too  
  
He said I fish and I play my guitar  
I laugh at the bar with my friends  
I go home to my wife  
I pray every night  
I can do it all over again  
  
Somewhere over Texas  
I thought of my Lexus  
And all the stuff I work so hard for  
And all the things that Ive gathered  
From climbing that ladder  
Didnt make much sense anymore  
They say my nest egg aint ready to hatch yet  
They keep holding my feet to the fire  
They call it paying the price  
So that one day in life  
Ill have what I need to retire  
  
And just fish  
And play my guitar  
And laugh at the bar with my friends  
And go home to my wife  
And pray every night  
I can do it all over again  
  
And to think that I thought for a while there that I had it made  
When the truth is Im really just dying  
To live like Jose  
  
And just fish  
Play my guitar  
Laugh at the bar with my friends  
Go home to my wife  
Pray every night  
I can do it all over again  
  
Wouldnt that be the life  
Wouldnt that be the life
