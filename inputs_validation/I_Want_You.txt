Close your eyes free your mind  
Stay with me tonight  
Lay me down hold me tight  
Say your mine tonight  
With all my heart  
  
Girl I want you  
Dont keep me hanging on  
Stealing moments from your life  
Girl I need you  
To be there in my heart in my heart  
Loves just enough to make it evermore  
  
Broken hearts distant love  
They dont go too far  
You know you gotta hold my hand  
Show me all the wonders of our love  
Way deep inside  
With all my heart  
  
Girl I want you  
Dont keep me hanging on  
Stealing moments from your life  
Girl I need you  
To be there in my heart in my heart  
Loves just enough to make it evermore  
Whoa  
  
Girl I want you  
Dont keep me hanging on  
Stealing moments from your life  
Girl I need you  
To be there in my heart in my heart  
Loves just enough to make it evermore  
  
Girl I want you  
Dont keep me hanging on  
Stealing moments from your life  
Girl I need you  
To be there in my heart well  
Loves just enough to make it evermore
