Gonna leave the city put my troubles behind  
People in the city goin out of their minds  
Goin to the country just to feel like gold  
People in the country really let themselves go  
  
Hey ho one thing I know  
People in the country got one thing for sure  
Hey ho one thing I know  
Every mothers child really lets himself go  
  
Goin to the country and leavin right away  
No time to talk I got to make a getaway  
Gonna leave the city its a crime and a shame  
People in the city are goin insane  
  
Hey ho one thing I know  
Every mothers child really lets himself go  
Hey ho one thing I know  
People in the country really let themselves go  
  
Joining hands  
Making plans  
Come on down  
Look around
