We are traveling in the footsteps  
Of those whove gone before  
But well all be reunited but if we stand reunited  
On a new and sunlit shore then a new world is in store  
  
Oh when the Saints go marching in  
When the Saints go marching in  
O Lord I want to be in that number  
When the Saints go marching in  
  
And when the sun refuses to shine  
And when the sun refuses to shine  
O Lord I want to be in that number  
When the Saints go marching in  
  
When the moon turns red with blood  
When the moon turns red with blood  
O Lord I want to be in that number  
When the Saints go marching in  
  
On that hallelujah day  
On that hallelujah day  
O Lord I want to be in that number  
When the Saints go marching in  
  
O when the trumpet sounds the call  
O when the trumpet sounds the call  
O Lord I want to be in that number  
When the Saints go marching in  
  
Some say this world of trouble  
Is the only one we need  
But Im waiting for that morning  
When the new world is revealed  
  
When the revelation comes  
When the revelation comes  
O Lord I want to be in that number  
When the Saints go marching in  
  
When the rich go out and work  
When the rich go out and work  
O Lord I want to be in that number  
When the Saints go marching in  
  
When the air is pure and clean  
When the air is pure and clean  
O Lord I want to be in that number  
When the Saints go marching in  
  
When we all have food to eat  
When we all have food to eat  
O Lord I want to be in that number  
When the Saints go marching in  
  
When our leaders learn to cry  
When our leaders learn to cry  
O Lord I want to be in that number  
When the Saints go marching in
