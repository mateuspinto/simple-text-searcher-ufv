This is the first day of my last days  
I built it up now I take it apart climbed up real high now fall down  
Real far  
No need for me to stay the last thing left I just threw it away  
I put my faith in god and my trust in you  
Now theres nothing more fucked up I could do  
Wish there was something real wish there was something true  
Wish there was something real in this world full of you  
Im the one without a soul Im the one with this big fucking hole  
No new tale to tell twentysix years on my way to hell  
Gotta listen to your big time hard line bad luck fist fuck  
Dont think youre having all the fun  
You know me I hate everyone  
Wish there was something real wish there was something true  
Wish there was something real in this world full of you  
I want to but I cant turn back  
But I want to
