Stuck inside these four walls  
Sent inside forever  
Never seeing no one  
Nice again like you  
Mama you mama you  
  
If I ever get out of here  
Thought of giving it all away  
To a registered charity  
All I need is a pint a day  
If I ever get outta here  
If we ever get outta of here  
  
Well the rain exploded with a mighty crash  
As we fell into the sun  
And the first one said to the second one there  
I hope youre having fun  
  
Band on the run band on the run  
And the jailer man and sailor Sam  
Were searching every one  
For the band on the run  
Band on the run  
Band on the run  
Band on the run  
  
Well the undertaker drew a heavy sigh  
Seeing no one else had come  
And a bell was ringing in the village square  
For the rabbits on the run  
  
Band on the run  
Band on the run  
And the jailer man and sailor Sam  
Were searching every one  
For the band on the run  
Band on the run  
  
Yeah the band on the run  
Band on the run  
Band on the run  
Band on the run  
  
Well the night was falling as the desert world  
Began to settle down  
In the town theyre searching for us everywhere  
But we never will be found  
  
Band on the run  
Band on the run  
And the county judge who held a grudge  
Will search for evermore  
For the band on the run  
Band on the run  
Band on the run  
Band on the run
