You have a date for half passed eight tonight  
Some distant bell starts chiming nine  
You wanna see her oh you wanna see her oh yeah  
But you wait you wait and wait  
Girl dont come  
  
The time rolls on those minutes fly by  
You wanna go but just you try guy  
You wanna see her oh you wanna see her oh yeah  
But you wait you wait and wait  
Girl dont come  
  
Youve been stood up tears fill your eyes whoa  
You hurt inside you wanna die
