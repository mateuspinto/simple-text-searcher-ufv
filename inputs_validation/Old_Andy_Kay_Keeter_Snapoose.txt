This man kept wishin that the devil would come  
And take his wife and oldest son  
Old Andy Kay Keeter Snapoose  
  
Finally one day the devil he came to take his wife and oldest son  
Old Andy Kay Keeter Snappose  
  
He put her down to take a rest  
She throwed up her arms and hugged him the best  
Old Andy Kay Keeter Snapoose  
  
He took her to the gates of hell she bid her friends and all farewell  
Old Andy Kay Keeter Snapoose  
  
One little devil came rattling a chain  
She picked up a club and beat out his brains  
Old Andy Kay Keeter Snapoose  
  
One little devil peeked over the wall  
And said take her back pappy shell murder us all  
Old Andy Kay Keeter Snapoose
