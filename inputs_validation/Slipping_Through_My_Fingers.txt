Schoolbag in hand she leaves home in the early morning  
Waving goodbye with an absentminded smile  
I watch her go with a surge of that well known sadness  
And I have to sit down for a while  
The feeling that Im losing her forever  
And without really entering her world  
Im glad whenever I can share her laughter  
That funny little girl  
  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
I try to capture every minute  
The feeling in it  
  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
Do I really see whats in her mind  
Each time I think Im close to knowing  
She keeps on growing  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
  
Sleep in our eyes her and me at the breakfast table  
Barely awake I let precious time go by  
Then when shes gone theres that odd melancholy feeling  
And a sense of guilt I cant deny  
What happened to the wonderful adventures  
The places I had planned for us to go  
Well some of that we did but most we didnt  
And why I just dont know  
  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
I try to capture every minute  
The feeling in it  
  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
Do I really see whats in her mind  
Each time I think Im close to knowing  
She keeps on growing  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
  
Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture  
And save it from the funny tricks of time  
Slipping through my fingers  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
Schoolbag in hand she leaves home in the early morning  
Waving goodbye with an absentminded smile
