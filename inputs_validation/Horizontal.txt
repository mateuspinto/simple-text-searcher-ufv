I have been lying under a pillow of dreams  
And feeling moments of swimming in cream  
This is the start of the end goodbye  
Hours of facing my life have damned  
  
You are a good friend  
Friendly as good friends can be  
Your father wants you to live on his knee  
This is the start of the end climb by me  
Red sides and blue sides within remind me  
  
I have been lying under a pillow of dreams  
And feeling moments of swimming in cream  
This is the start of the end goodbye  
Hours of facing my life have damned
