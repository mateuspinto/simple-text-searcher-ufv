Look hes crawling up my wall  
Black and hairy very small  
Now hes up above my head  
Hanging by a little thread  
  
Boris the spider  
Boris the spider  
  
Now hes dropped on to the floor  
Heading for the bedroom door  
Maybe hes as scared as me  
Wheres he gone now I cant see  
  
Boris the spider  
Boris the spider  
  
Creepy crawly  
Creepy crawly  
Creepy creepy crawly crawly  
Creepy creepy crawly crawly  
Creepy creepy crawly crawly  
Creepy creepy crawly crawly  
  
There he is wrapped in a ball  
Doesnt seem to move at all  
Perhaps hes dead Ill just make sure  
Pick this book up off the floor  
  
Boris the spider  
Boris the spider  
  
Creepy crawly  
Creepy crawly  
Creepy creepy crawly crawly  
Creepy creepy crawly crawly  
Creepy creepy crawly crawly  
Creepy creepy crawly crawly  
  
Hes come to a sticky end  
Dont think he will ever mend  
Never more will he crawl round  
Hes embedded in the ground  
  
Boris the spider  
Boris the spider
