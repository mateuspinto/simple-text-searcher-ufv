Such a beautiful sight  
Entered into my life  
The interrest conquerred the fright  
To greet the mother of all life  
  
A pounding on a frozen street  
Where she planted a seed  
The deepest essence of me so deep  
My spirit was free  
  
Oh Im thankin blessed Mary  
For life devine  
Thankin blessed Mary for life devine  
Thankin blessed Mary for life  
  
Temptation messed me around  
She picked me up from the ground  
Taught me to never let go  
Of your Godgiven soul  
  
Sometimes I still lose my mind  was good  
When life is cruel and unkind  
Its when I suffer I learn  
Depending of love will burn  
  
Oh Im thankin blessed Mary  
For life devine  
Thankin blessed Mary for life devine  
Thankin blessed Mary for life  
  
Yes my faith has been renewed  
She guides me  
To turn all life into the true oh oh oh  
Yes my faith has been renewed  
  
Oh Im thankin blessed Mary  
For life devine  
Thankin blessed Mary for life devine  
Thankin blessed Mary for life devine  
Thankin blessed Mary for life  
  
Temptation messed me around  
She picked me up from the ground  
Taught me to never let go  
Of your Godgiven soul
