On the following Friday as I turned out  
The light  
Grandma came and knocked at My  
Door  
Wake up King wake up My dear  
I am gonna show You about the house  
Of Amon  
  
It is time for tea it is time again  
  
Even Your mother is present  
We made her sleep in My rocking  
Chair  
At first I felt really scared but there  
Was no reason to  
As I saw the knife sneaking out from  
Grandmothers dress  
Then it cut a tiny wound in My  
Mothers little hand  
  
It is time for tea it is time again  
  
Blood was running into the tea pot  
Then I heard Them laugh  
A bit of this in a cup of tea is what it  
Takes to set Them free  
You will hear Them telling stories  
From far beyond this earth  
What I saw and what I heard made me  
Want to stay and learn  
  
I really hope this dream will never  
End its hard to describe the kind of  
Feeling that went on in my mind  
A paradise  
  
Hearing Their stories and feeling  
Their warmth  
We laughed with tears in our eyes  
From the first cup of tea to the last  
Drop of blood  
Nothing seemed to matter at all  
Anymore  
My Mother She didnt exist to me  
Oh I felt so heavenly  
  
It is time for tea it is time again
