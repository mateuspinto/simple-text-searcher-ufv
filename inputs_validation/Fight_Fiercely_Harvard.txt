Now we come to that peculiar bit of Americana known as the football fight
song I was reminded not too long ago upon returning from my lesson with the
Scrabble pro at the Harvard club in Boston of the days of my undergraduacy
long ago when there used to be these very long Saturday afternoons in the fall
with nothing to do  the library was closed  just waiting around for the
cocktail parties to begin And on occasions like that some of us used to
wander over to theI believe it was called the stadium to see if anything
might be going on over there And one did come to realize that the football
fight songs that one hears in comparable stadia have a tendency to be somewhat
uncouth and even violent and that it would be refreshing to say the least
to find one that was a bit more genteel And here it is dedicated to my own
alma mater and called Fight Fiercely Harvard  
  
Fight fiercely Harvard fight fight fight  
Demonstrate to them our skill  
Albeit they possess the might  
Nonetheless we have the will  
  
How we will celebrate our victory  
We shall invite the whole team up for tea How jolly  
Hurl that spheroid down the field  
And fight fight fight  
  
Fight fiercely Harvard fight fight fight  
Impress them with our prowess do  
Oh fellas do not let the crimson down  
Be of stout heart and true  
  
Come on chaps fight for Harvards glorious name  
Wont it be peachy if we win the game Oh goody  
Lets try not to injure them  
But fight fight fight  
Lets not be rough though  
Fight fight fight  
And do fight fiercely  
Fight fight fight
