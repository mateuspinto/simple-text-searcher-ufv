When I talk about it  
It carries on  
Reasons only knew  
When I talk about it  
Aries or treasons  
All renew  
  
Big me to talk about it  
I could stand to prove  
If we can get around it  
I know that its true  
  
When I talked about it  
Carried on  
Reasons only knew  
  
But its you I fell into  
  
But its you I fell into  
  
Well I talked about it  
Put it on  
Never was it true  
But its you I fell into
