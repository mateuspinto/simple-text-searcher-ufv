It was early in the fall and a blowin up a squall  
From the trestle you could hear the weirdest moans  
With a mighty lonesome cry came a whistle from the sky  
And it chilled the very marrow in my bones  
  
Then a loud rushing roar like you never heard before  
Turned the blood to icy water in my veins  
As I watched with rising fear something strange was drawing near  
And I saw in the clouds ghost trains  
  
Ghost trains ghost trains what a fearful sight  
The Cannonball and No 9 were racing through the night  
Just as they passed me by I heard the engineer cry  
Giver her coal give her coal shovel it on  
  
You could see the fireman grinnin in the engine that was winnin  
But I knew before the finish theyd be gone  
Well he knew before the finish theyd be gone  
You could see the drivers roll as they shoveled on the coal  
  
And the black smoke came pouring from the stacks  
As they thundered through the sky I am here to testify  
You could hear the wheel a clickin on the tracks  
Through the smoke and the steam you could see the headlights gleam  
  
Now I have no proof but still the fact remains  
You may doubt it but I swear there were cinders in my hair  
When I saw in the clouds ghost trains  
Ghost trains ghost trains  
  
As I watched I saw them fade into the dawn  
As he watched he saw them fade into the dawn
