Its been a long road  
To get from there to here  
Its been a long time  
But my time is finally here  
  
And I can feel a change in the wind right now  
Nothings in my way  
And theyre not gonna hold me down no more  
No theyre not gonna hold me down  
  
Cause Ive got faith of the heart  
Im going where my heart will take me  
Ive got faith to believe  
I can do anything  
Ive got strength of the soul  
And no ones going to bend or break me  
I can reach any star  
Ive got faith  
Ive got faith  
Faith of the heart  
  
Its been a long night  
Trying to find my way  
Been through the darkness  
Now I finally have my day  
  
And I will see my dream come alive at last  
I will touch the sky  
And theyre not gonna hold me down no more  
No theyre not gonna change my mind  
  
Cause Ive got faith of the heart  
Im going where my heart will take me  
Ive got faith to believe  
I can do anything  
Ive got strength of the soul  
And no ones going to bend or break me  
I can reach any star  
Ive got faith  
Faith of the heart  
  
I know the winds so cold  
Ive seen the darkest days  
But now the winds I feel  
Are only winds of change  
Ive been through the fire  
And Ive been through the rain  
But Ill be fine  
  
Cause Ive got faith of the heart  
Im going where my heart will take me  
Ive got faith to believe  
I can do anything  
Ive got strength of the soul  
And no ones going to bend or break me  
I can reach any star  
Cause Ive got faith  
Cause Ive got faith  
Faith of the heart  
  
Faith of the heart  
Im going where my heart will take me  
Ive got faith to believe  
And no ones going to bend or break me  
I can reach any star  
Cause Ive got faith  
Cause Ive got faith  
Faith of the heart  
  
Its been a Long Road
