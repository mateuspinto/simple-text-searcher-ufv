Always been the radios child  
Quicktosmile precious baby  
Search the dial and electrify  
  
Drive a tight little corner back in the mirror  
Radio boys trying on all their moves  
Spare some change and testify  
  
Radio playing in your sleep  
Prophet waiting in your car  
Worlds whispered in the mind of a radio child  
  
Rhymes cheating keeping time  
Eyes stretching across the stars  
Over and over in the life of a radio child  
  
The radios laugh like all their friends  
Telling jokes the old folks know so well  
Like an old guitar plays a lullaby  
  
Radio cradling your dreams  
Prophet waiting in your car  
Worlds whisper in the mind of a radio child  
  
Rhymes chatting keeping time  
Eyes searching across the stars  
Over and over in the life of a radio child  
  
Yeah radio child  
Precious baby precious baby
