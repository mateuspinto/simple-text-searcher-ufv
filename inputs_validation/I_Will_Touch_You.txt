Cagan  
I can count the teardrops hidden from your eyes  
I can hear the sadness that your smile belies  
Thought I heard a whisper  
Did it come from you  
If you say youre ready  
I am ready too  
I will touch you deep inside where love is  
I will touch your sorrow and make it go away  
I can hear the questions running through your mind  
I can feel the answers very close behind  
When your heart is ready  
You will understand  
When youre tired of crying  
You will take my hand  
I will touch you deep inside where love is  
I will touch your sorrow and make it go away
