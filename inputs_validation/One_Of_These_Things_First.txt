I could have been a sailor could have been a cook  
A real live lover could have been a book  
I could have been a signpost could have been a clock  
As simple as a kettle steady as a rock  
I could be  
Here and now  
I would be I should be  
But how  
I could have been  
One of these things first  
I could have been  
One of these things first  
  
I could have been your pillar could have been your door  
I could have stayed beside you could have stayed for more  
Could have been your statue could have been your friend  
A whole long lifetime could have been the end  
I could be yours so true  
I would be I should be through and through  
I could have been  
One of these things first  
I could have been  
One of these things first  
  
I could have been a whistle could have been a flute  
A real live giver could have been a boot  
I could have been a signpost could have been a clock  
As simple as a kettle steady as a rock  
I could be even here  
I would be I should be so near  
I could have been  
One of these things first  
I could have been  
One of these things first
