Hark all ye shepherds come join in our song  
Hark all ye shepherds for Jesus is born  
Lo he is lying born in a manger  
Jesus annointed to be our Savior Alleluia  
  
Hark all ye shepherds arise from your sheep  
Hark all ye shepherds the Christ child asleep  
Mary the mother quietly singing  
From God to man salvation is bringing Alleluia  
  
Angels adore him men bow before him heaven and earth proclaim  
Prophets of old his coming foretold and men ever praise his name  
Come and adore him Jesus our Savior  
He dwells among us now and forever Alleluia
