In the dark of night  
Abusing a portion of light  
While others are sleeping  
And some are escaping  
A serpent spews out fantasy  
Unjustified blasphemy  
That cannot be condoned  
  
It must be strange to not have lived  
So far into existence  
  
This is not a test of power  
This is not a game to be lost or won  
Let justice be done  
  
Chorus  
There will be zero tolerance  
For the creator of hallowed intentions  
There will be zero tolerance  
Fate is your deciding God  
  
Karma comes crashing down  
Leaving a very deep scar  
Exposing a door to the  
Source of a verbal whore  
Machines supply the altar  
Where virtuous lives are sacrificed  
  
It must be strange to not have lived  
So far into existence  
  
This is not a test of power  
This is not a game to be lost or won  
Let justice be done
