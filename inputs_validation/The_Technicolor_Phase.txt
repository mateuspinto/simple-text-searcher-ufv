I am the red in the rose the flowers  
On the blankets on your bedroom floor  
And I am the gray in the ghost that hides  
With your clothes behind your closet door  
  
I am the green in the grass that bends back  
From underneath your feet  
And I am the blue in your back alley view  
Where the horizon and the rooftops meet  
  
If you cut me I suppose I would bleed the colors  
Of the evening stars  
You can go anywhere you wish cause Ill be there wherever you are  
Wherever you are Repeat x2  
  
I will always be your gaze  
When we are lost in the Technicolor phase  
  
I am the black in the book  
The letters on the pages that you memorize  
And I am the orange in the overcast  
Of color that you visualize  
  
I am the white in the walls that soak up  
All the sound when you cannot sleep  
And I am the peach in the starfish on the beach  
That wish the harbor wasnt quite so deep  
  
If you cut me I suppose I would bleed the colors  
Of the evening stars my darling  
You can go anywhere you wish cause Ill be there wherever you are My
darling  
  
Wherever you are Repeat x3
