Nowhere to go  
All night took everything  
Another nice try with Mr Wrong  
Late night TV on my horizon  
National anthem and Im barely hangin on  
  
Just a typical Saturday night  
Feeling like the rest of my life  
  
There was nothing new under the moon  
Same old dance same old tune  
Just wishes on stars that never came true  
Just one more night to get through  
But there was nothing new under the moon till you  
  
Hey what a change  
Hey what a concept  
Heres a true heart waiting mine  
News Flash Whod ever thought you could  
Have the same feeling at the very same time  
  
Look at what your loves doing to me  
I cant believe I used to believe  
There was nothing new under the moon  
Same old dance same old tune  
Just wishes on stars that never came true  
Just one more night to get through  
But there was nothing new under the moon till you  
  
Nothing new under the moon  
Same old dance same old tune  
Just wishes on stars that never came true  
Just one more night to get through  
There was nothing new under the moon till you  
Nothin new under the moon till you  
Nothin new under the moon  
  
Nothin new under the moon till you  
Nothin new under the moon  
  
There was nothing new under the moon till you
