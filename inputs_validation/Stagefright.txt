I said welcome to my show  
Its just ayou and me baby  
We got the whole damn night to go  
  
Youre holding out on me while Im on fire  
If you cant stand the heat then you should try  
Victim of my vices you know you are  
You skate on ice to paradise stairway to the stars  
  
Stagefright all night wont you let go  
All night stagefright on with the show  
  
You come on like a lady dressed to kill  
Never thought you could be caught but you will  
A little understanding a little love  
A headline act around the back is what Im thinkin of  
  
Stagefright all night wont you let go  
All night stagefright on with the show  
Stagefright all night youre dream starts today  
All night stagefright is only a heartbeat away  
  
Youre going for my head youre going down  
Gettin good at being bad youre hangin round  
A fun inspired asylum toys for the boys  
Love on the rocks forgetmenots you got no choice  
  
Stagefright all night oh wont you let go  
All night stagefright get on with the show  
Stagefright all night youre dream starts today  
All night stagefright is only a heartbeat away  
  
Stagefright all night oh wont you let go  
All night stagefright get on with the show
