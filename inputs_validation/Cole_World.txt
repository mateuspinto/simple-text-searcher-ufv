I think its gonna be a hell of a night  
A hell of a night  
So we can do whatever you like  
Hey hey  
  
It took me all day to find some inspiration  
It just hit me like a ton of bricks no renovation  
Problem with the game now there aint no innovation  
I see my shit all in your shit we call that imitation  
And they say thats flattering but I aint flattered at all  
Matter fact yall need to practice that more  
See my man Nate asked me if I gained weight  
I said nah my pockets got fatter thats all  
Money was an issue but now that thats solved  
I ball I ball like Kobe in the fall  
Put trophies on my wall rather trophies on my mantle  
Dog my shows be off the handle take the proceeds go to gamble  
Bet it on black and pray I quadruple my salary  
If I win maybe then I could pay Sallie Mae  
Told her I be dealin with some real life shit  
She be askin when bitch When I feel like it  
  
Chorus  
Cole World Cole Life Cold Blooded  
I be on my shit and look at all the hoes love it  
Got a hundred fifty bitches in the club starin at me  
How that feel Very happy  
Hey  
I got what you need right here  
I got what you need right here  
I got what you need right here  
I got what you need right here  
  
Uh turn up the eight o eights for me  
Back when I was starvin no one made a plate for me  
Now I do it big and thats my day to day story  
I got the type of shit that make a hater say sorry  
Bitch I made this in the crib watchin Belly  
Eatin peanut butter jelly what the fuck the niggas tell me  
They say Im takin long I tell em patience is a virtue  
Im goin all out and bitch I never had a curfew  
See when youre spittin so real  
Suddenly these phony niggas lose they appeal  
Got em feelin like my niggas when they lose they appeal  
Then its back to the cell back to the hell  
At times I watch the news and see they talkin bout diplomacy  
And they aint got a clue my niggas aint got they diplomas see  
Rappers show me love I wonder what it could be  
I think they scared of me and they should be  
  
Chorus
