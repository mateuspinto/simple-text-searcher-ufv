Well I was rollin down the road in some cold blue steel  
I had a blues man in back and a beautician at the wheel  
We going downtown in the middle of the night  
We laughing and Im jokin and we feelin alright  
Oh Im bad Im nationwide  
Yes Im bad Im nationwide  
  
Easin down the highway in a new Cadillac  
I had a fine fox in front I had three more in the back  
They sportin short dresses wearin spikeheel shoes  
They smokin Lucky Strikes and wearing nylons too  
Cause we bad we nationwide  
Yeah we bad we nationwide  
  
Well I was movin down the road in my V8 Ford  
I had a shine on my boots I had my sideburns lowered  
With my New York brim and my gold tooth displayed  
Nobody give me trouble cause they know I got it made  
Im bad Im nationwide  
Well Im bad bad bad bad bad Im nationwide
