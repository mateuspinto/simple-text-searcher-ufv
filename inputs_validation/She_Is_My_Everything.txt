She is my everything  
From her sun tanned shoulders  
Down to the freckles on her wedding ring  
Her feet is so warm  
They can melt the snow in the early spring  
She is my everything  
She goes everywhere  
From Copenhagen to makin eggs and bacon  
Down in Jackson Square  
Id like to drive a Cadillac  
The color of her long black hair  
She goes everywhere  
Kisses that come all the way from China  
Kinda remind her of memories of Spain  
If I get lost you can always find her  
Standing right beside me in the rain  
She uses the Eveready  
Batteries to keep her electrical  
Appliances going steady  
She can do 14 things at once  
And then her phonell ring  
She is my everything  
She knows everybody  
From Muhammad Ali to teaching Bruce Lee  
How to do Karate  
She could lead a parade  
While puttin on her shades in her Masaratti  
She knows everybody  
Kisses that come all the way from China  
Kinda remind her of memories of Spain  
If I get lost you can always find her  
Standing right beside me in the rain  
She is my everything  
When she wakes up in the morning  
Thats when the birdies start to sing  
When I hear her voice  
Ill tell you boys I forget everything  
She is my everything  
She is my everything  
Watch out
