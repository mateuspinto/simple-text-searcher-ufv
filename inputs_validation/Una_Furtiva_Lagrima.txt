Lelisir damoreOne tear that falls so furtively  
  
Una furtiva lagrima  
Neglocchi suoi spunto  
Quelle festose giovani  
Invidiar sembro  
Che piu cercando io vo  
Che piu cercando io vo  
Mama si mama lo vedo lo vedo  
Un solo instante I palpiti  
Del suo bel cor sentir  
I miei sospir confondere  
Per poco a suoi sospir  
I palpiti I palpiti sentir  
Confondere I miei coi suoi sospir  
Cielo si puo morir  
Di piu non chiedo non chiedo  
Ah Cielo si puo si puo morir  
Di piu non chiedo non chiedo  
Si puo morir si puo morir damor

English translation  
One tear that falls so furtively  
From her sweet eyes has just sprung  
As if she envied all the youths  
Who laughingly passed her right by  
What could I want more than this  
She loves me I see it  
One moment just to hear her heart  
Beating so close next to mine  
To hear my sighs like they were hers  
Her sighings as if they were mine  
Heavens please take me now  
All that I wanted is mine now
