Who will search for holy grail  
Past the edge beyond the veil  
Who will come beyond the light  
Far from reach beyond all sight  
  
Who will share this bitter cup  
Let the wild dogs tear them up  
Let the cold winds blow them down  
Drive them deep beneath the ground  
  
Who will live in darkest night  
Dankest gloom and quietest quiet  
Buried deep beneath the ground  
Far from any human sound  
  
Who will search for treasure trove  
Scour the seas and scale the globe  
Past the peaks beyond the heights  
Far most reaches furthest sights  
  
Who will share this bitter cup  
Let the wild dogs tear them up  
Let the cold winds blow them down  
Drive them deep beneath the ground
