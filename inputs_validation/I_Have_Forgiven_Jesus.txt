I was a good kid  
I wouldnt do you no harm  
I was a nice kid  
With a nice paper round  
Forgive me any pain  
I may have brung to you  
With Gods help I know  
Ill always be near to you  
But Jesus hurt me  
When he deserted me but I have forgiven you Jesus  
For all the desire  
You placed in me when theres nothing I can do with this desire  
  
I was a good kid  
Through hail and snow  
Id go just to moon you  
I carried my heart in my hand  
Do you understand do you understand  
  
But Jesus hurt me  
When he deserted me but I have forgiven you Jesus  
For all of the love  
You placed in me when theres no one I can turn to with this love  
  
Monday  humiliation  
Tuesday  suffocation  
Wednesday  condescension  
Thursday  is pathetic  
By Friday life has killed me  
By Friday life has killed me  
Oh pretty one oh pretty one  
  
Why did you give me so much desire  
When there is nowhere I can go to offload this desire  
And why did you give me so much love in a loveless world  
When there is no one I can turn to  
To unlock all this love  
And why did you stick in self deprecating bones and skin  
Jesus do you hate me  
Why did you stick in self deprecating bones and skin  
Do you hate me Do you hate me Do you hate me Do you hate me Do you
hate me
