I carry her with me  
I carry her pride  
Whenever I speak her name  
My soul it comes alive  
  
She taught me to be strong  
She taught me to fight  
And I am who I am today  
Because she raised me right  
  
Chorus  
In a sunburned country  
Her magic and her mystery  
In a sunburned country  
Forever will be home to me  
Oh thats where my heart is truly free  
  
The creeks and the rivers  
The dust and the mud  
All of us understand  
This land gets in your blood  
  
The sight of the blue gums  
And black cockatoos  
White snow Kosciusko  
Red rock Uluru  
  
Chorus  
  
Weve always been humble  
Too scared to be proud  
I think its time that  
We all stand and say  
We love our home out loud  
  
Chorus  
  
I love all the people  
I love all the sounds  
Sleeping under a tin roof  
With a hard rain coming down
