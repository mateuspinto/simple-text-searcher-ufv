The wind is moving  
But I am standing still  
A life of pages  
Waiting to be filled  
A heart thats hopeful  
A head thats full of dreams  
But this becoming  
Is harder than it seems  
Feels like Im  
  
Chorus  
Looking for a reason  
Roaming through the night to find  
My place in this world  
My place in this world  
Not a lot to lean on  
I need Your light to help me find  
My place in this world  
My place in this world  
  
If there are millions  
Down on their knees  
Among the many  
Can you still hear me  
Hear me asking  
Where do I belong  
Is there a vision  
That I can call my own  
Show me Im  
  
Chorus
