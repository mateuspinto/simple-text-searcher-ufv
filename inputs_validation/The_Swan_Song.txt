Winter has come for me cant carry on  
The chains to my life are strong  
But soon theyll be gone  
Ill spread my wings one more time  
  
Is it a dream  
All the ones I have loved calling out my name  
The sun warms my face  
All the days of my life I see them passing me by  
  
In my heart I know I can let go  
In the end I will find some peace inside  
New wings are growing tonight  
  
Is it a dream  
All the ones I have loved calling out my name  
The sun warms my face  
All the days of my life I see them passing me by  
  
As I am soaring Im one with the wind  
I am longing to see you again its been so long  
We will be together again  
  
Is it a dream  
All the ones I have loved calling out my name  
The sun warms my face  
All the days of my life I see them passing me by
