Brother my cup is empty  
And I havent got a penny  
For to buy no more whiskey  
I have to go home  
  
I am the captain of my pain  
Tis the bit the bridle  
The trashing cane  
The stirrup the harness  
The whipping mane  
The pickled eye  
The shrinking brain  
O brother buy me one more drink  
Ill explain the nature of my pain  
Yes let me tell you once again  
I am the captain of my pain  
  
O brother my cup is empty  
And I havent got a penny  
For to buy no more whiskey  
I have to go home  
  
I cannot blame it all on her  
To blame her all would be a lie  
For many a night I lay awake  
And wished that I could watch her die  
To see her accusing finger spurt  
To see flies swarm her hateful eye  
To watch her groaning in the dirt  
To see her clicking tongue crack dry  
O brother buy me one more drink  
One more drink and then goodbye  
And do not mock me when I say  
Lets drink one more before I die  
  
O brother my cup is empty  
And I havent got a penny  
For to buy no more whiskey  
I have to go home  
  
Well Ive been sliding down on rainbows  
Well Ive been swinging from the stars  
Now this wretch in beggars clothing  
Bangs his cup across the bars  
Look this cup of mine is empty  
Seems Ive misplaced my desires  
Seems Im sweeping up the ashes  
Of all my former fires  
So brother be a brother  
And fill this tiny cup of mine  
And please sir make it whiskey  
For I have no head for wine  
  
O brother my cup is empty  
And I havent got a penny  
For to buy no more whiskey  
I have to go home  
  
I counted up my blessings  
And counted only one  
One tiny little blessing  
And now that blessings gone  
So buy me one more drink my brother  
Then Im taking to the road  
Yes Im taking to the rain  
Im taking to the snow  
O my friend my only brother  
Do not let the party grieve  
So throw a dollar onto the bar  
Now kiss my ass and leave  
  
O brother my cup is empty  
And I havent got a penny  
For to buy no more whiskey  
I have to go home
