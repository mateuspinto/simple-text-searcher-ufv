I search for her in the dead of night  
A silhouette lit by candle light  
In a whispered word she is gone  
Familiar stranger without a name  
In a darkened room they all look the same  
Like the sands of time she slips away so far away  
In the mirror you can see her face  
An angel dressed in the blackest lace  
A sip of wine and the game can begin  
Just an image lost in fantasy  
Then you touch her and you cant break free  
Till you see your fate written there in her eyes  
Oh Ariel  
Lost in a distant dream take me home  
Ariel
