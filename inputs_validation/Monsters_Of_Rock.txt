It started many years ago out of the black country  
The seed became the embryo for all on earth to see  
Like stealth the word spread mouth to mouth all corners of the land  
And soon the thing began to grow and get right out of hand  
  
From the concrete jungle  
The smoke the dirt the grime  
Could not contain the hunger  
It grew and grew in time into a  
  
Monster Monster of rock  
They could never bind it  
It vowed to reach the top  
Monster Monster of rock  
They could never bind it  
Impossible to stop  
  
Took the sound across the seas the people stood in awe  
At last the sound had come to them  
That theyd been waiting for  
  
And millions roared and millions cheered  
This spectacle on stage  
And everyone went crazy as it bellowed out in rage  
  
From the concrete jungle  
The smoke the dirt the grime  
Could not contain the hunger  
I grew and grew in time into a  
  
Monster Monster of rock  
They could never bind it  
It vowed to reach the top  
Monster Monster of rock  
They could never bind it  
Impossible to stop  
  
From the concrete jungle  
The smoke the dirt the grime  
Could not contain the hunger  
It grew and grew in time into a  
  
Monster Monster of rock  
They could never bind it  
It vowed to reach the top  
Monster Monster of rock  
They could never bind it  
Impossible to stop
