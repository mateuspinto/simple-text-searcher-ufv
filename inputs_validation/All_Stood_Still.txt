The lights went out The last fuse blew  
The clocks all stopped It cant be true  
The programs wrong What can we do  
The printouts blocked It relied on you  
The turbine cracked up  
The buildings froze up  
The system choked up  
What can we do  
Please remember to mention me  
In tapes you leave behind  
Chorus   
We stood still  
We all stood still  
Still stood still  
Were standing still  
The screen shut down Theres no reply  
The lifts all fall A siren cries  
And the radar fades A pilot sighs  
As the countdowns stall The readout lies  
The turbines cracked up  
The buildings froze up  
The system choked up  
What can we do  
Please remember to mention me  
In tapes you leave behind  
Chorus  
The black box failed The codes got crossed  
And the jails decayed The keys got lost  
Everyone kissed We breathe exhaust  
In the new arcade Of the holocaust  
The turbine cracked up  
The buildings froze up  
The system choked up  
What can we do  
Plese remember to mention me  
In tapes you might leave behind  
Chorus  Repeat 2 times
