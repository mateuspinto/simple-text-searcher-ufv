Youve come to me again my friend  
Ive been waiting so long  
Life seems strange and hard sometimes  
Maybe I wont make it this time  
  
Oh Theyve taken all I have  
But I just need whats left of  
Today and you can wash it all away  
When it all comes down and Im feeling tired and afraid  
Youre always there and seem come when  
Ive nothing left to give away  
  
Now I wait for your winds to come and give me breath for  
Another day and your rain to wash me  
  
I feel the rain coming  
I feel it in my heart take away my pain  
I feel the rain coming  
Wash me down wash me down  
  
Here comes the rain  
Hold me now just for awhile  
  
I feel like a candle flame in the wind  
The dust of my deeds past covers me like a fading lie  
  
I feel the rain coming  
I feel it in my heart wash away my pain  
Wash me down wash me down  
I feel the rain coming  
  
Here comes the rain
