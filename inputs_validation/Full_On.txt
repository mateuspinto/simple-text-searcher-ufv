I hear my heart beatin faster  
I feel it in my bones  
I want it now cause I have ta  
But why noone knows  
Im like the angel on the A train  
My eyes is diamond white  
And from the cradle till your insane  
The life you have to fight  
But noone really knows why theres a spirit in the sky  
Theres escape so long  
He will understand while I take him by the hand  
Why lifes time tunnel is long  
Well it will be alright  
If you stay tonight  
Its where we both belong  
Its gonna be full on  
Its gonna be full on  
Its gonna be full on  
Its gonna be full on  
Its gonna be full on
