Moderate Rock  
  
May day every day my day  
Couldve had a heart attack my heart  
We dont know anything my heart  
We all want something fair my heart  
  
Hey hey hey hey hey  
  
Out of town out of sight is my heart  
Queen of lies today my heart  
One more on the phone my heart  
One more at the door of my heart  
  
Hey hey hey hey hey  
  
Mean heart  
Cold heart  
Cold heart  
Cold heart  
Cold heart  
Cold heart  
Cold heart  
Cold heart  
  
Yeah
