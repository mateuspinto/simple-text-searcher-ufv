I wander through a town  
A town I new so well but it seems so strange  
The wind blows cold  
I remember when I thought your street was paved with gold  
I walked along the street  
A street I walked along many times before  
The things have changed  
Everything I knew was gone or rearranged  
  
Julie dont live here anymore  
She moved away many years before  
How can it be this I cant believe  
Julie dont live here anymore  
  
I walked up to your door  
Last night I saw your face in the window  
But it was different now  
The lonely light where we used to be quite gone  
  
I though about your smile  
Your laughing eyes and the things you said to me  
I felt so sorry for you  
For all the nights we spent hanging around with nothing else to do  
  
Julie dont live here anymore  
She moved away many years before  
How can it be this I cant believe  
Julie dont live here anymore  
  
Julie dont live here anymore  
She moved away many years before  
How can it be this I cant believe  
Julie dont live here anymore  
  
Julie dont live here anymore  
Julie dont live here anymore  
Julie dont live here anymore
