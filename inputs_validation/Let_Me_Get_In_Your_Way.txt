Please  
Let me get in your way  
Call me sad and blue  
All I need is your good lovin  
Just to see me through  
Call me lonely too  
You should never ever make me  
Need you like I do  
Cant you see Im not naggin baby  
This heart of mine is just saggin baby  
Please  
Let me get in your way  
Just have somethin to say to me  
Please

Just have somethin you can say to me  
Im not asking you  
To move a mountain swim a river  
Or walk on the moon  
Call me beggin too  
For a little of the love I need  
So much from you  
Cant you see Im not naggin baby  
This heart of mine is just saggin baby

Just have somethin you can say to me
