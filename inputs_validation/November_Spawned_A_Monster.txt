Sleep on and dream of love  
Because its the closest you will  
Get to love  
Poor twisted child  
So ugly so ugly  
Poor twisted child  
Oh hug me oh hug me  
One November  
Spawned a monster  
In the shape of this child  
Who later cried   
  
But Jesus made me so  
Jesus save me from  
Pity sympathy  
And people discussing me  
A frame of useless limbs  
What can make good  
All the bad thats been done   
  
And if the lights were out  
Could you even bear  
To kiss her full on the mouth  
or anywhere  
  
Oh poor twisted child  
So ugly so ugly  
Poor twisted child  
Oh hug me oh hug me  
One November  
Spawned a monster  
In the shape of this child  
Who must remain  
A hostage to kindness  
And the wheels underneath her  
A hostage to kindness  
And the wheels underneath her  
  
A symbol of where mad mad lovers  
Must pause and draw the line  
So sleep and dream of love  
Because its the closest  
You will get to love  
That November  
Is a time  
Which I must  
Put out of my mind  
  
Oh one fine day  
Let it be soon  
She wont be rich or beautiful  
But shell be walking your streets  
In the clothes that she went out  
And chose for herself
