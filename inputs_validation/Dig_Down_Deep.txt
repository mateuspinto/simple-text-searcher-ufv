You better get up and do it now you better get up my friend and how  
The land that you love the best is asking you to invest  
With a personal request from mr morgenthau  
Dig down deep to buy the bonds that buy the tanks  
Palmers for our fighting yanks dig down deep  
Dig down deep to buy the bonds that keep us free supply the sky the land and
sea  
Dig down deep put your hand on your gismo citizen everybody must do his
part  
Its the easiest piece that the citizen to show the world we finish what we
start  
Dig down deep the boys are giving all for you so the least that you can do  
Is dig down deep
