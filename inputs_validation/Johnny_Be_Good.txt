originally By Chuck Berry  
  
  
  
Way Down Louisiana Close To New Orleans  
  
Way Back Up In The Woods Among The Evergreens  
  
There Stood A Log Cabin Made Of Earth And Wood  
  
Where Lived A Country Boy Name Of Johnny B Goode  
  
He Never Ever Learned To Read Or Write So Well  
  
But He Could Play The Guitar Like Ringing A Bell  
  
  
  
Go Go  
  
Go Johnny Go  
  
Go Go  
  
Johny Be Good  
  
  
  
He Use To Carry His Guitar In A Gunny Sack  
  
And Sit Beneath The Trees By The Railroad Track  
  
Oh The Engineers Used To See Him Sitting In The Shade  
  
Playing To The Rhythm That The Drivers Made  
  
People Passing By Would Stop And Say  
  
Oh My That Little Country Boy Could Play  
  
  
  
Go Go  
  
Go Johnny Go  
  
Go Go  
  
Johny Be Good  
  
  
  
His Mama Told Him Someday He Would Be A Man  
  
And He Would Be The Leader Of A Big Old Band  
  
Many People Coming From Miles Around  
  
To Hear Him Play His Music When The Sun Go Down  
  
Maybe Someday His Name Would Be In Lights  
  
Saying Johnny B Goode Tonight
