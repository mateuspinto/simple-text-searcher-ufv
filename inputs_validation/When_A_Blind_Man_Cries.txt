If youre leaving close the door  
Im not expecting people anymore  
Hear me grieving Im lying on the floor  
Whether Im drunk or dead I really aint too sure  
  
Im a blind man Im a blind man and my world is pale  
When a blind man cries Lord you know there aint no sadder tale  
  
Had a friend once in a room  
had a good time but it ended much too soon  
In a cold month in that room  
we found a reason for the things we had to do  
  
Im a blind man Im a blind man now my room is cold  
When a blind man cries Lord you know he feels it from his soul
