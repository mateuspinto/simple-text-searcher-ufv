I was a fool to say the things I said  
I just lost my head  
Made you cry made you go  
I didnt mean to be so cold  
I had no right mistreating you that way  
And oh how could I know the price Id pay  
Sorry I ever caused you pain  
Sorry I sorry I said those hurtful things  
But baby all that really matters now is  
I wanna get back with you  
Just give me one more try  
I wanna get back with you  
Just stop this hurt inside  
I gotta get back with you  
I been walking down these cold and lonely streets  
I been losing sleep  
Had to prove I was strong  
But every night every night just proved me wrong  
Had to think I had heaven right here in my hand  
And oh just let it slip away like sand  
Oh gimme one chance to make it right  
One more chance one more chance back in your light  
Cause baby all that really matters now is  
I wanna get back with you  
Hold me just like before  
I wanna get back with you  
Taking me somewhere warm  
I gotta get back with you  
Baby Id give my soul  
Just to hold one more time  
Just to look in your eyes  
Cause right now Im half alive  
No matter what I do  
Theres no living without you  
Cant you see baby  
I wanna get back with you  
Just give me one more try  
I wanna get back with you  
Just stop this hurt inside  
I gotta get back with you  
Hold me just like before  
Taking me somewhere warm  
I wanna get back with you babe  
I wanna get back with you baby  
I wanna get back  
I gotta get back with you  
Oh take me back
