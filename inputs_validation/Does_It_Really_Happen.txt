Thats what you say  
Does it really happen to you  
Does that explain  
This is the season for this display  
To take a look  
In time to move together  
  
Chorus  
Time is the measure before its begun  
Slips away like running water  
Live for the pleasure live by the gun  
Heritage for sun and daughter  
Down to the slaughter up for the fun  
Up for anything  
  
Could this be true  
Does it ever happen to you  
And can you prove  
That wheels go round in reason  
You take a step  
In time  
To move together  
  
Chorus  
  
You walk the way  
You take the path  
To be assured  
You draw a graph  
The scale you use  
Is all on black  
Be brave the weight  
Will make the heat  
There is no way  
To takeit back  
  
Chorus
