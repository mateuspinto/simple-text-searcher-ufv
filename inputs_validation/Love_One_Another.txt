I had a dream that I was speaking  
With a prophet from the land of wise  
In a crowd of people from the land of troubled hearts  
I said Weve come here for answers  
A solution to our worlds demise  
He said the journey would be long  
But heres where you start  
  
Chorus  
Love one another  
Love one another  
Work it in to work it out  
There could never be enough  
Love one another  
Love one another  
Cause you know without a doubt  
You can change your world with love  
  
It was a simple conclusion  
But I thought that it was rather profound  
Just a fundamental law that we should all live by  
I took it in to tomorrow  
Yea I walked the earth but I never found  
Any corner of the world  
Where this did not apply  
  
Chorus  
  
And looking out I saw no method to the madness there  
Like in a vision from the Isle of Patmos I was scared  
It was a revelation  
Love is getting rare  
  
The people of the land united  
And in my dream we all agreed  
That we should start again  
And this would be our creed  
  
Chorus
