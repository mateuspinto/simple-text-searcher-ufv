In this promised land  
Fire burnin in our hands  
The choice is ours to make  
Realize your fantasy  
You live the dream  
With every step you take  
Stand tall stand on the edge  
Use the thin end of the wedge  
The will to cast your fate  
Dont turn around too late  
Lose ground if we hesitate  
Burning youth wont wait  
  
Make a move across the rubicon  
Futures knockin at your door  
Take your time  
And choose the road you want  
Opportunity is yours  
  
See it all so clear  
Time is right time is near  
We know now what to do  
All gods children learn  
Which way to turn  
Turning back were through  
We all refuse to lose  
Live life and light the fuse  
Burning youth wont wait
