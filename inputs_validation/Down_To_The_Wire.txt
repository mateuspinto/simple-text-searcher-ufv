Every time you touch her  
Sets your hands on fire  
And everything youve got  
Is all that she requires  
And you hang on hang on hang on  
To the words of a liar  
You can feel it getting  
Down to the wire  
All the hurt you thought was gone  
Has now returned  
And every thing shes laughing at  
Is all you learned  
And you let go let go let go  
cause you know youre getting tired  
Can you feel it getting  
Down to the wire  
Take the time to close your  
Eyes and look around  
Cause anyone who helped you out  
Can let you down  
And look out look out look out  
The voice is now the choir  
Can you feel it getting  
Down to the wire
