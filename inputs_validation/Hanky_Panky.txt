Hey Whats the words to the next verse  
My baby does the hanky panky  
My hanky does my baby baby

My baby does my baby baby  
My baby does the hanky panky  
Oh I dont believe it  
I saw her walking on down the line  
You know I saw her for the very first time  
A pretty little girl standing all alone  
Hey pretty baby can I take you home  
I never saw her never ever saw her  
Oh here we go again  
My baby does the hanky panky  
My baby does the hanky panky

My baby does the hanky panky  
My baby does the hanky panky  
I said my baby she does the hanky panky  
Can you tell me what the hanky panky is  
I saw her walking on down the line  
Yes I did  
You know I saw her for the very first time  
A pretty little girl standing all alone  
Hey pretty baby can I take you home  
I never saw her never ever saw her  
Oh goodness  
I said ah My baby does the hanky panky  
My baby she does the hanky panky now  
My baby does my hanky panky  
My hanky does my panky baby  
My hanky she does the hanky panky  
My baby she does the hanky panky
