Playin easy somewhere shade across my mind  
Thoughts that pass I cannot catch I reach for you and find  
That I have learned how not to get burned now  
Wind in the tree blows even the sea knows  
That I have learned how think I can see now  
Lookin through dreams is not what it seems  
They handed me the bottle and said drink it til its gone  
But now that its half empty Im not sure I can go on  
Thought I had learned how not to get burned now  
Wind in the tree blows even the sea knows  
That I have learned how think I can see now  
Lookin through dreams  
  
I keep rollin I keep rollin  
I keep rollin and I cant stop  
Rollin and I cant stop  
Its drivin me out of my mind  
To the truck stop to the plane hop  
To the boat dock and Im so close  
Boat dock and Im so close  
Give me a little more time  
  
Spin me around turn my head down  
Take me down slow dont let me go  
Spin me around turn my head down  
Take me down slow dont let me go  
Gonna quit you gonna quit you  
Gonna quit you pretty mama  
Quit you hey mama  
You know that I aint got time  
Get behind me get behind me  
Get behind me now bad times  
Oh bad times  
Theres nothin in there you can hide  
Spin me around turn my head down  
Take me down slow dont let me go  
Spin me around turn my head down  
Take me down slow dont let
