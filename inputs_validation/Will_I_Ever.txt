I heard you for so long  
And the promises you made  
Keep me hanging on  
Dont know why  
Ive got to know  
Is this love enough to show it  
Let it go  
Will I ever get to heaven with you  
Will I ever breath the air that you do  
Will I ever touch the angels  
Will we fly  
Will I ever  
Will I ever get to heaven with you  
Another night starts to fall  
And the wind carries me  
When I wanna crawl  
Coz when I look inside  
Theres a fire in me  
That I cant hide who  
Wishin for an angel  
Searchin in my mind  
Getting tired of waiting in me  
Praying
