Crazy Mary from Londonderry  
Lives next door to the cemetery  
How many lovers have you buried  
We would shout running scared  
Along the green and golden paths  
That took us home away from Crazy Mary  
  
In the lamplight burning low  
Dimly through enchanted woods  
She rocks beside the fire  
That was never lit and as we ran on by  
Pretending to be frightened  
Wed shout and laugh at Crazy Mary  
  
She would never answer us  
Smiled through the window softly  
Wild eyed and wild haired but we were sure  
That in the dark of night  
She cursed us soundly casting spells  
And such to run us into donkeys  
Crazy Mary from Londonderry  
  
So it seems that older now  
We stand upon this wind swept moor  
The lonely grave before us testifies  
That Crazy Mary sings and dreams  
Her dreams somewhere but not  
Where little kids can follow after  
  
And on the stone these words dear friend  
Please write me down as one who loved  
The raven haired and laughing lads  
That swore that they would marry me  
And soon their sons came running by  
And here I lie forgotten Crazy Mary  
Crazy Mary from Londonderry
