Caught the train from Warrabrook  
All the way into Hornsby  
But somehow we got stuck  
Next to a fat spastic old lady  
  
She had a stereo  
And a granny pram  
A big fat ugly gut  
And a pink bumbag  
  
Yeah  Yeah  
  
All stations to Central  
Shes been herer since New Castle  
And the Knights are gunna win the comp  
  
Yeah Yeah  
Old Woman on a train  
  
She had some ChocWheatons  
Some plastic tupperware  
She hated all Asians  
Cause theyre not from round here  
  
Yeah  Yeah  
  
All stations to Central  
Shes been herer since New Castle  
And the Knights are gunna win the comp  
  
Yeah Yeah  
Old Woman on a train  
  
All stations to Central  
Shes been herer since New Castle  
And the Knights are gunna win the comp  
  
Yeah Yeah  
Old Woman on a train  
Yeah Yeah Yeah  
Old Woman on a train  
Yeah Yeah  
Old Woman on a train  
Yeah Yeah Yeah  
Old Woman on a train
