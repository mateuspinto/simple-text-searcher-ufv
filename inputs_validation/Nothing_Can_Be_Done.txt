Must I forgive you  
Each time  
And say you dont know what youre doing  
There are no victimless crimes  
I know of  
Out here in these graffiti ruins  
My love  
  
Oh I am not old  
Im told  
But I am not young  
Oh and nothing can be done  
Dont start  
My heart  
Is a smoking gun  
Oh and nothing can be done  
  
I heard you leaving  
Late last night  
I heard you screaming down the mountain  
Like you were running red lights  
Red lights  
You had some trashcanrockband pounding  
  
Oh I am not old  
Im told  
But I am not young  
Oh and nothing can be done  
Dont start  
My heart  
Is a smoking gun  
Oh and nothing can be done  
  
Must I surrender  
With grace  
The things I loved when I was younger  
Sweet embrace  
Must I remember your face  
So well  
What do I do here with this hunger  
  
Oh I am not old  
Im told  
But I am not young  
Oh and nothing can be done  
Dont start  
My heart  
Is a smoking gun  
Oh and nothing can be done  
  
Nothing can be done  
Nothing can be done  
Oh nothing can be done
