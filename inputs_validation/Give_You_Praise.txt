When I think of the things that youve done for me my Lord  
How can I even start to explain the way I feel  
Your love for me is so real  
Takes away my deepest fears  
Now I know that I stand with your power in my life  
  
I need you by my side  
I need you here with me  
Lord you are my life  
Come and set me free  
  
Now that you are in my life  
Everythings completely changed  
I know for sure that things will never be the same  
Now that I have found your love  
Im drawing closer everyday  
For everything youve done in me  
Gonna give you praise  
  
I stand in awe of you  
I stand in awe of you  
I stand in awe of you  
I stand in awe of you  
I stand in awe of you
