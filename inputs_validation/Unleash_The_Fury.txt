Once upon a time  
So many centuries ago  
The blind would lead the blind  
To sell their souls  
To be worshiping the dark  
And to burn for eternity  
With sacrifice of blood  
The fools will bleed  
Unleash the fury  
Free the beast  
You must heed the story  
Told by the priests  
Ring the doomsday bells  
Raising hell  
For this world I sing  
Oh so sad a requiem  
Now there is nothing that can bring  
Bring it back again  
Unleash the fury  
Free the beast  
You must heed the story  
Told by the priests  
Ring the doomsday bells  
Raising hell  
guitar solo  
Unleash the fury  
Free the beast  
You must heed the story  
Told by the priests  
Ring the doomsday bells  
Raising hell  
guitar solo
