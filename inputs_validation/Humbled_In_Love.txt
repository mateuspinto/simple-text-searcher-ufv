Do you remember all of those pledges  
That we pledged in the passionate night  
Ah theyre soiled now theyre torn at the edges  
Like moths on a still yellow light  
No penance serves to renew them  
No massive transfusions of trust  
Why not even revenge can undo them  
So twisted these vows and so crushed  
  
And you say youve been humbled in love  
Cut down in your love  
Forced to kneel in the mud next to me  
Ah but why so bitterly turn from the one  
Who kneels there as deeply as thee  
  
Children have takes these pledges  
They have ferried them out of the past  
Oh beyond all the graves and the hedges  
Where love must go hiding at last  
And here where there is no description  
Oh here in the moment at hand  
No sinner need rise up forgiven  
No victim need limp to the stand  
  
And you say youve been humbled in love  
And look dear heart look at the virgin  
Look how she welcomes him into her gown  
Yes and mark how the strangers cold armour  
Dissolves like a star falling down  
Why trade this vision for desire  
When you may have them both  
You will never see a man this naked  
I will never hold a woman this close  
  
And you say youve been humbled in love
