I asked my father  
I said Father change my name  
The one Im using now its covered up  
With fear and filth and cowardice and shame  
  
Chorus x2  
Yes and lover lover lover  
Lover lover lover lover  
Come back to me  
  
He said I locked you in this body  
I meant it as a kind of trial  
You can use it for a weapon  
Or to make some woman smile  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Then let me start again I cried  
Please let me start again  
I want a face thats fair this time  
I want a spirit that is calm  
  
Chorus x2  
  
I never never turned aside he said  
I never walked away  
It was you who built the temple  
it was you who covered up my face  
  
Chorus x2  
  
And may the spirit of this song  
May it rise up pure and free  
May it be a shield for you  
A shield against the enemy  
  
Chorus x2
