Welcome into this place  
Welcome into this broken vessel  
You desire to abide in the praises of your people  
So we lift our hands and lift our hearts  
As we offer up this praise unto your name  
  
Creation declares your glory  
And the universe declares majesty  
Yet you choose to abide in the praises of your people  
So we lift our hands and we lift our hearts  
As we offer up this praise unto your name
