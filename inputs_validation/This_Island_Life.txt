This teas too strong for me as I await your company  
I had too much sun today  
Ocean waters wash away  
Nothing but the present presenting its presence  
  
This island life  
Separate my right from my wrong  
  
No I am not pagan but my heart has been forsaken  
And the hand of God was on my mind  
It took some time from time to time  
Now in the course I know time itself will go  
  
This island life  
Separates my right from my wrong  
  
You forgot your shoes and I I have sent a message but I  
So many stars in the sky  
Its the truths that will not lie  
Theres a young wild native maiden running mad and barefoot to the sea  
  
Until this island life  
Separates my rights from my wrongs  
  
This island life  
Finally separates my rights from my wrong  
  
This teas too strong for me as I await more company  
I had too much sun today  
Dream of lands lying far away  
Pregnant with the present presenting its presents  
  
This island life  
Separate my right from my wrong  
  
This island life  
Separate my rights from my song  
  
Separate my right from my wrong  
Separate my right from my wrong  
Separate my right from my wrong  
Separate my right from my wrong
