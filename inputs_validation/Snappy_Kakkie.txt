I say Hey Snappy Kakkie  
Do you want to play  
I say Hey Snappy Kakkie  
I said whatcha say  
The water she is nice we can steal away  
Theyll never know were gone til the break o day  
Come on Come on  
  
I say Hey Snappy Kakkie  
Did they talk to you today  
I say Hey Snappy Kakkie  
Did you see it their way  
The moon she is high we must leave tonite  
We must get away we will join the fight  
Come on Come on  
  
I say Hey Snappy Kakkie  
Did our brothers stay  
I say Hey Snappy Kakkie  
Will our sisters pay  
Does it really matter of the friends we lost  
It doesnt really matter cause their souls were lost  
Come on Come on  
  
I say Hey Snappy Kakkie  
Do you want to play  
I say Hey Snappy Kakkie  
I say Hey watcha say  
The water she is nice we can steal away  
Theyll never know were gone til the break o day  
So come on
