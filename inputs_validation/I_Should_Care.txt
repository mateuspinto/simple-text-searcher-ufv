I should care I should go around weeping  
I should care I should go without sleeping  
Strangely enough I sleep well  
Cept for a dream or two  
But then I count my sheep well  
Funny how sheep can lull you to sleep  
  
So I should care I should let it upset me  
I should care but it just doesnt get me  
Maybe I wont find someone as lovely as you  
But I should care and I do  
  
I should care but it just doesnt get me  
Maybe I wont find someone as lovely as you  
But I should care and I do  
  
And I do
