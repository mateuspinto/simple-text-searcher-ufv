There are some fellows soft and mellow  
Sitting in the field and play like hell  
No one knows the way it goes  
But all the songs they play they sound so well  
  
Tonight we go to see the Heavy Metal Hamsters  
It must feel nice to be a Heavy Metal Hamster  
Nothing sets you free like our Heavy Metal Hamsters  
  
A 20th century Fox came by  
A gold tipped cigarette high in his jaws  
Contracts PDs NoseBags TVshows  
And everything with no remorse  
  
Things are settled now for our Heavy Metal Hamsters  
Fame up to your brows oh Heavy Metal Hamster  
A previously unknown lifestyle Heavy Metal Hamster  
  
The sweet taste of success is strong  
And everything inside goes wrong you see  
With coloured furs sunglasses  
Tons of nuts to eat they dont feel free  
  
What is wrong with our Heavy Metal Hamster  
Look what they have done our Heavy Metal Hamsters  
Where is the field to run for our Heavy Metal Hamsters  
Some things are left undone for our Heavy Metal Hamsters
