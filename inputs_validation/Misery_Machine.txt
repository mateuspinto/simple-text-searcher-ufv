Man in the front got a sinister grin careen down highway 666  
We want to go crush the slow as the pitchfork bends the needles grow  
My arms are wheels my legs are wheels my blood is pavement  
Were gonna ride to the abbey of thelema to the abbey of thelema  
blood is pavement  
  
The grill in the front is my sinister grin bugs in my teeth make me  
sick sick sick  
The objects may be larger than they appear in the mirror  
When you ride youre ridden when you ride youre ridden  
I am fueled with the filth and fury Do what I will I will hurry there
