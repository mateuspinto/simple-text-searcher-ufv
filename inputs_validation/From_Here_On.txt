Michael W Smith  
  
You must have felt alone  
Reaching through your doubt  
But I never meant to close you out  
While I was building dreams  
You were building fears  
And I was the cause of all those tears  
But can I start over and break new ground  
I know Ive let you down oh babe  
  
Do you feel the weight of the world  
Heavy on your shoulders  
Well let my love take you down another road  
And lighten up the load  
From here on  
  
Many were the times I failed to follow through  
Of pieces of heaven I promised you  
It wasnt paradise it wasnt even close  
And I hurt the one I love the most  
And sorry could never be good enough  
But I will make it up to you  
  
I know you feel the weight of the world  
Heavy on your shoulders  
Let my love take you down another road  
And lighten up the load  
From here on
