A gorgeous georgian lady is quite a sight to see  
For some splendid beauty tips pay attention listen to me  
  
White is beautiful dear ladies smear your face with paint of lead  
Never mind the lead had made the men who mixed it Ill or dead  
  
Take some silk of red or black cut a circle or a cresent  
Stick it on your face to cover smallpox scars its much more pleasant  
  
Shave your eyebrows clean away take a trap and catch some mice  
Make false eyebrows with the mouse skin stick them on youll look so  
Nice  
  
Next you need a monster wig if you want to look real smashing  
Once your wig has reached the roof then youll be the height of fashion  
  
Decorate your lovely hairpiece use the feathers of a parrot  
Add some ribbon fruit and flowers from your ear then hang a carrot  
  
Make your face look soft and chubby pack your mouth with balls of cork  
Hang your flash teeth in the middle hope you dont choke when you talk  
  
Now you followed my advice last of all you need a fan  
Flutter it oh so demurely then your sure to bag your man
