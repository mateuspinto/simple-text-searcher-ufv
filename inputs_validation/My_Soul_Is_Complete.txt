Father of everlasting grace  
Be my comfort in this broken place  
Ill rest upon the perfect love  
In You in You  
  
Faithful Lord You never change  
When all is lost You remain  
Saviour all my hope is found  
In You in You

My soul is complete in Jesus in Jesus  
Your grace and Your truth

King of glory be lifted high  
Ill worship You Lord with my whole life  
Fill my heart with a joy thats only found  
In You in You  
  
Chorus 2  
My soul is complete in Jesus in Jesus

Have made a way and now Im free  
My soul is complete in Jesus in Jesus  
Your grace and Your truth  
Have made a way and now Im free in You

With hands held high Ill live my life  
To worship You be glorified  
With hands held high Ill live my life  
To worship You be glorified
