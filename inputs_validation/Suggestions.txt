Watching  
From a post up high  
From where you see the ships afar  
From a well trained eye  
The waves all keep on crashing by  
If you are the light post  
Then you own the working class  
But if you want the answers  
You better give a piece of ass  
Give a piece of your ass  
  
Warning  
Post hypnotic suggestions  
Running the ships ashore  
The orange light that follows  
Will soon proclaim itself a God  
If you point your questions  
The fog will surely chew you up  
But if you want the answers  
You better get ready for the fire  
Get ready for the fire  
  
The ships are multiplying day after day sir  
And theyre coming close to the shore sir shore sir  
We need to evacuate the light post  
Its all over  
Its all over
