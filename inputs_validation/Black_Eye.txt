He had a black eye  
He was proud of  
Like some of his friends  
It made him feel somewhere outside  
Of everything and everywhere hed been  
  
Like his brothers  
He emptied himself  
And played it safe  
Like their father  
He wanted to remember  
But he almost always  
Forgot what he was gonna say  
  
Black eye  
Black eye  
  
When he realized  
That this one was here to stay  
He took down  
All the mirrors in the hallway  
And thought only of his younger face  
  
Black eye  
Black eye
