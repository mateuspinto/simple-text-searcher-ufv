The girl from all those songs  
Who made everything feel right  
She came in like an angel into your lonely life  
And filling your world with light  
Oh and everybody told you youre oh so lucky  
  
Curtains part revealing a country scene  
Clothed in green and brown  
Evidence of autumn  
And recent rain  
On a winding lane a byway  
Walking on that road is a certain girl  
In all the world the one  
Guaranteed to move you and turn your head  
When alls been said and done  
  
The girl from all those songs  
Who made everything feel right  
She came in like an angel into your lonely life  
And filling your world with light  
Oh and everybody told you youre oh so lucky  
  
The night is clear but cool  
Ooh maybe dawn is breaking as you turn to find her gone  
Then you see the note  
Ooh you cannot believe it  
And you think youll go insane  
  
But that was many years ago  
And though the pain is dim  
A something still remains  
Though you hardly can recall  
Her face or form  
Her memory lingers on  
Ooh she made everything feel right  
She came in like an angel in like an angel  
Into your lonely life into your life  
And filling your world with light  
Oh and everybody told you youre oh so lucky
