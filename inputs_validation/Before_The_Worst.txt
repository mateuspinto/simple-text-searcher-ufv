Its been a while since the two of us talked  
About a week since the day that you walked  
Knowing things would never be the same  
With your empty heart and mine full of pain  
  
So explain to me how it came to this  
Lets take it back to the night we kissed  
It was Dublin city on a Friday night  
With vodkas and coke I was Guinness all night  
  
We were sitting with our backs against the world  
Saying things that we thought but never heard  
Who would have thought it would end up like this  
  
But everything we talked about is gone  
And the only chance we have of moving on  
Was trying to take it back before it all went wrong  
  
Before the worst  
Before we met  
Before our hearts decided its time to love again  
Before today  
Before too long  
Lets try and take it back before it all went wrong  
  
There was a time that wed stay up all night  
Best friends yeah talking til the daylight  
Took the joys alongside the pain  
With not much to lose but so much to gain  
  
Are you hearing me Cause I dont wanna miss  
That you would drift on memory bliss  
It was Grafton street on a rainy night  
I was down on one knee and you were mine for life  
  
We were thinking we would never be apart  
With your name tattooed across my heart  
Who would have thought it would end up like this  
  
But everything we talked about is gone  
And the only chance we have of moving on  
Was trying to take it back before it all went wrong  
  
Before the worst  
Before we met  
Before our hearts decided its time to love again  
Before today  
Before too long  
Lets try and take it back before it all went wrong  
  
If these clouds dont clear  
Then well rise above it well rise above it  
Heavens gate is so near come walk me through  
Just like we used to just like we used to yeah  
  
Lets take it back before it all went wrong  
  
Before the worst  
Before we met  
Before our hearts decided its time to love again  
Before today  
Before too long
