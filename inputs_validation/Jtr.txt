I drink you up  
For every drop of you is sacred  
Every drop I drink you up  
  
You fill my cup  
The way you laugh  
Eyes of a child  
Lean on me you fill me up  
You make me love  
So unconditionally  
Generous to me you give me love  
And break my heart  
Slip you fall I pick you up and dust you off  
You break my heart  
  
Rain rain rain down on me  
Again and again  
Rain down on me  
  
Take all you want  
And only hope can i you wont deny  
Your love for me my love  
  
No dont cry if its too high  
I lift you up well make it make it  
When I was oh so tired  
You come along to wake me  
Time and time again and again  
With a smile you save me child oh oh oh  
  
Rain rain rain down on me  
Again and again  
Rain down on me  
  
Look we play our cards  
And I question by the grace of what  
We play our cards at all  
Come fill me up oh fill me love when Im empty  
When Im all dried up  
  
No dont cry if its too high  
Ill lift you up well make it make it  
Oh I was so so tired  
You come along to wake me wake me  
Time and time again and again  
With a smile you save me child  
Oh oh oh  
  
Rain rain rain down on me  
Again and again  
Rain down on me  
  
Rain rain down on me
