Echo star is a crossing you  
Trembling noises that come too soon  
Spatial movement which seems to you  
Resonating your mass call few  
  
Hollow talking and hollow girl  
Voicing up from the root of pain  
Never said it was good never said it was me  
Shadow rises and you are here  
  
And then you carve  
You cut it out  
And everything  
Goes back to the beginning  
  
Silence seizes a clotted room  
Dying to shed not a breath too soon  
Darkness rises in all you do  
Standing and drawn across the room  
  
Spatial movements and butterflies  
Shadows scatter without a fight  
There has never been bad there has always been truth  
Rooted whispers of the things you lose  
  
And then you carve  
You cut it out  
And everything  
Goes back to the beginning  
Goes back to the beginning  
  
There has never been bad there has always been truth  
Rooted whispers of the things you lose
