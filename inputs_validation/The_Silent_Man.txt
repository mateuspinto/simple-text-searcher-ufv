A question well served  
Is silence like a fever  
A voice never heard  
Or a message with no receiver  
  
Pray they wont ask  
Behind the stained glass  
Theres always one more mask  
  
Has man been a victim  
Of his woman of his father  
If he elects not to bother  
Will he suffocate their faith  
  
Desperate to fall  
Behind the great wall  
That separates us all  
  
When there is reason tonight Im awake  
When theres no answer arrive the silent man  
If there is balance tonight hes awake  
If they have to suffer there lies the silent man  
  
Sin without deceivers  
A god with no believers  
I could sail by on the winds of silence  
And maybe they wont notice  
But this time I think itd be better if I swim  
  
When there is reason tonight Im awake  
When theres no answer arrive the silent man  
If there is balance tonight hes awake  
If they have to suffer there lies the silent man  
There lies the silent man
