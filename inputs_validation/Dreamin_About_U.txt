If the wind blew every petal from your precious red rose  
Would you be afraid of what youd find inside  
When Im alone in my room  
I cant stop dreaming about you dreaming about you  
When Im alone in my room  
I cant stop dreaming about you dreaming about you  
And every time I do what I need to do  
I cant stop dreaming about you dreaming about you  
  
Revolving around every word that is spoken  
Like the planets around the sun  
I want you  
Your tongue is a great persuader  
Yeah you got me sold  
And when Im alone in my room just watching a rose  
I dream about you I dream about you  
  
When Im alone in my room yeah  
I cant stop dreaming about you  
When Im alone in my room baby baby  
I cant stop dreaming about you dreaming about you  
And every time I do what I need to do  
I cant stop dreaming about you dreaming about you  
  
When my sane twin reigns  
Claiming your aim is to maim my subconscious into being with you  
I dream about you  
Betting on the notion that if my lustier twin prevails  
Like the ruins of Rome Ill lie helpless at your feet  
Yeah when Im alone  
I dream about you I dream about you  
  
I dream about you baby  
When Im alone in my room  
I dream about you my baby  
I dream about you you you  
  
And here we stand  
And here we stand amidst your core you  
Like the petals on this rose I adore you  
The inside The inside  
If the inside is kind  
Kind in a sense that one would come from all  
And the wish that you wish will come true if you call  
But if not you will fall you will fall  
And Ill still be alone Just dreaming about you  
With this ball in my stomach just dreaming about you Dreaming about you
