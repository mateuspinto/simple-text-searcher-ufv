Far I have travelled and much I have seen  
The darkest of mountains with valleys of green  
And vast painted deserts with sunsets on fire  
As they carry me home to the Mull of Kintyre  
Mull of Kintyre  
Oh mist rollin in from the sea  
My desire is always to be here  
Oh Mull of Kintyre  
Sweep through the heather like deer in the glen  
It carries me back to the days I knew then  
And nights when we sang like a heavenly choir  
Of the life and the times of the Mull of Kintyre  
Mull of Kintyre  
Oh mist rollin in from the sea  
My desire is always to be here  
Oh Mull of Kintyre  
Smiles in the sunshine and tears in the rain  
They carry me back where my memories remain  
And flickerin embers grow higher and higher  
As they carry me home to the Mull of Kintyre  
Mull of Kintyre  
Oh mist rollin in from the sea  
My desire is always to be here  
Oh Mull of Kintyre
