Did you ever hover in the distance  
Did you ever swoop down from the sky  
To the bright green rocks all draped with seaweed  
And the deep blue ocean rolling by  
Maybe I will find today  
Maybe I will lose tomorrow  
Gonna rock on to the oceanside  
Did you ever see into the future  
See the big red sun that wont go down  
And the giant moths upon the cliffside  
In the deep red scar that was our town  
Maybe I will find today  
Maybe I will lose tomorrow  
Gonna rock on to the oceanside  
Baby were the king and queen of nothing  
Everybody glows and then theyre numb  
We can make a moment last forever  
Gaze across the ocean to the sun  
Maybe I will find today  
Maybe I will lose tomorrow  
Gonna rock on to the oceanside  
Gonna rock on to the oceanside  
Gonna rock on to the oceanside  
Baby were the king and queen of something  
Everybody goes and then they come
