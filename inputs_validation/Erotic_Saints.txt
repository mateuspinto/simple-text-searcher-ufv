Erotic saints  
Rated are  
Rainbow veins  
And sunlight scars  
Say my name  
Say my name  
  
Keep me dry  
In a cool place  
Get me out  
In a few days  
I will feel so much better  
  
Until we all are grown apart  
We live our lives the way we want  
Until we all are torn apart  
  
Been in for days  
Neon tan  
Asbestos lips  
Will kiss your hand  
Every word you say  
Blow me away  
  
This is it  
Here it comes  
I Think Ill quit  
To use my lungs  
Beta dreams  
Airbrush a tumor  
  
Until we all are torn apart  
Are torn apart
