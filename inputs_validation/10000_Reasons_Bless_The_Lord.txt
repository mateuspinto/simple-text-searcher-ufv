Bless the Lord oh my soul  
Oh my soul  
Worship His Holy name  
Sing like never before  
Oh my soul  
Ill worship Your Holy name  
  
The sun comes up  
Its a new day dawning  
Its time to sing Your song again  
Whatever may pass  
And whatever lies before me  
Let me be singing  
When the evening comes  
  
Bless the Lord oh my soul  
Oh my soul  
Worship His Holy name  
Sing like never before  
Oh my soul  
Ill worship Your Holy name  
  
Youre rich in love  
And Youre slow to anger  
Your name is great  
And Your heart is kind  
For all Your goodness  
I will keep on singing  
Ten thousand reasons  
For my heart to find  
  
Bless the Lord oh my soul  
Oh my soul  
Worship His Holy name  
Sing like never before  
Oh my soul  
Ill worship Your Holy name  
Bless You Lord  
  
And on that day  
When my strength is failing  
The end draws near  
And my time has come  
Still my soul will  
Sing Your praise unending  
Ten thousand years  
And then forevermore  
Forevermore  
  
Bless the Lord oh my soul  
Oh my soul  
Worship His Holy name  
Sing like never before  
Oh my soul  
Ill worship Your Holy name  
  
Bless the Lord oh my soul  
Oh my soul  
Worship His Holy name  
Sing like never before  
Oh my soul  
Ill worship Your Holy name  
Yes Ill worship Your Holy name  
Ill worship Your Holy name  
  
Sing like never before  
Oh my soul  
Ill worship Your Holy name  
Jesus I will worship Your Holy name  
Worship Your Holy name
