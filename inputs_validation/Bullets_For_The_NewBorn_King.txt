No one looks in this place for motive or any hope  
But for the dead shot of an amber glass  
The blue light of a votive  
  
Rain obscured the window  
As the pain was dulled by the grains  
Absolved by spoons in flames  
In fear in time dissolving  
  
Its not for the faint of pulse  
Or anybody false  
Those amateurs who simply shed their skins  
So where are those traitors now we once called patriots  
Just like those saints who seem to revel in their sins  
  
O my eyes were filled with tears that were stinging  
After our assassins work was done  
But bells in hands are only there for the wringing  
And we were bringing bullets for the newborn king  
  
Trumpet sounds lamenting  
Trampling down the blooms of the deceased  
The double agent girl and the fallen priest were heading for the border  
  
Somewhere in the high command there stayed the palest hand  
Who saw the order countermand  
Erased the tape recorder and then they hung him from a window cord  
  
Swallow down that voodoo vial and stay your breath a while  
Before we spill this tale that we had spun  
And now I shall now confide all that I have denied  
Oh Im so sorry for the things Ive done  
  
O my eyes were filled with tears that were stinging  
After our assassins work was done  
But bells in hands bells were only there for the ringing  
And we were bringing bullets for the newborn king
