Well you say youre from the city  
California is your home  
Hey Im a country girl over Oklahoma way  
Oh there are miles and miles between us  
But that dont mean a thing  
When those guitars start to play  
Oh sweet sounds of freedom  
Ringing through the air  
Sending out a message to us all  
We dont have a curtain  
Made of iron or stone  
We are not divided by a wall  
So come on tell me  
Hey hey hey  
From LA to Broadway  
Hey hey hey  
Let the music lift you up  
Hey hey hey  
Whoa everybodys singin  
Hey hey hey  
Let the music lift you up  
When youre feelin low  
Hit that radio  
Let the music lift you  
Let the music lift you  
Up way up way up  
There are books that tell us  
What makes this whole world turn  
And how Heaven holds the star wars  
But theres no explanation  
Lord its still a mystery  
How a song can touch your heart  
So come on tell me  
Hey hey hey  
From LA to Broadway  
Hey hey hey  
Let the music lift you up  
Hey hey hey  
Whoa everybodys singin  
Hey hey hey  
Let the music lift you up  
Let the music lift you  
Let the music lift you  
Up way up way up
