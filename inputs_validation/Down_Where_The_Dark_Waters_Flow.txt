Beneath the moon tonight  
I kneel close to my darlings side  
Her eyes in death forever closed  
My sweet and future bride  
  
Beside some lonely river bank  
Where the weeping willow grow  
Ill ease my aching heart tonight  
Down where the dark waters flow  
  
I planted on her new made grave  
A tender rose with care  
To bloom through all the lonely years  
While she is lying there  
  
Ill place one tender kiss of love  
Upon that budding rose  
And bid my world of cares goodbye  
Down where the dark waters flow
