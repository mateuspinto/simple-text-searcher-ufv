It was all once bright jewels  
And glittering sand  
The oceans have ravaged  
And strangled the land  
Waste fills the temples  
Dead daughters are born  
The presses are empty  
The editors torn  
  
Whose husband was the first to fall  
Who died the worst death of them all  
How many splinters in each separate band  
How many stations in the final hand  
  
Now gather up sea shells  
And write down brave words  
Your prayers are unanswered  
Your idols absurd  
The seaweed and the cobweb  
Have rotted your sword  
Your barricades broken  
Your enemies Lord
