You and me  
We were the last of the line  
Young and free  
We were two of a kind  
  
We ran the streets together  
The night would last forever  
Oh do you remember when  
  
Whatever happened to our wild ways  
The hungry beat of our younger days  
We swore wed never let them get away  
But so long to our wild ways  
  
You and me  
Driving to the ocean at night  
Running free  
Trying to stay ahead of the light  
  
The road ran through the morning  
Time passed without a warning sign  
Oh we were the reckless kind  
  
Whatever happened to our wild ways  
The hungry beat of our younger days  
We swore wed never let them get away  
But so long to our wild ways  
  
Baby we could be free once again  
Ill take you away from this town  
You know I wont let you down  
You know I wont let you down  
  
Whatever happened to our wild ways  
The hungry beat of our younger days  
  
We swore wed never let them get away  
But so long to our wild ways
