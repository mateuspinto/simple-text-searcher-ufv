Father of life draw me closer  
Lord my heart is set on you  
Let me run the race of time  
With you life unfolding mine  
And let the peace of God  
Let it reign  
  
Oh Holy Spirit Lord my comfort  
Strengthen me hold my head up high  
And I stand upon your truth  
Bringing glory unto you  
And let the peace of God  
Let it reign  
  
Chorus  
Oh Lord I hunger for more of you  
Rise up within me let me know your truth  
Oh Holy Spirit saturate my soul  
And let the life of God  
Fill me now  
Let your healing power  
Breathe life and make me whole  
And let the peace of God  
Let it reign  
  
Oh Holy Spirit Lord my comfort  
Strengthen me hold my head up high  
And I stand upon your truth  
Bringing glory unto you  
And let the peace of God  
Let it reign  
  
Repeat chorus twice  
  
And let the life of God  
Fill me now  
Let your healing power  
Breathe life and make me whole  
And the peace of God  
Let it reign  
  
repeat
