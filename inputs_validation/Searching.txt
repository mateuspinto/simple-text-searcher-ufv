Hit the town in the cold of the night  
Looking round for the warmth of the light  
There was fog on the road  
So I guess no one saw me arriving  
  
I was tired and awake for some time  
Then my lights hit a welcoming sign  
It said if youre alone  
You can make this your home  
If you want to oww  
  
Searching searching  
For so long  
Searching  
Searching  
Searching searching  
I just wanted to dance  
Searching  
  
Stepped outta the night  
It was brighter inside  
Someone come and asked me my name  
Taken back by surprise  
When I saw with my eyes  
A girl in a loves disguise  
  
She said stop stop stop  
Get out your heart  
Havent got a lot  
But play the part  
  
Mister stop stop stop  
Get out your heart  
What Ive gots hot stuff  
The night is ours  
  
Coffee glass that had fell from my hand  
Like a child couldnt quite understand  
What was I doin there  
Far away from nowhere on my own  
  
I was tired and awake for some time  
Just the light playing tricks with my mind  
Was she there in a crowd  
Was the music too loud was I dreaming  
  
Searching searching  
For so long  
Searching  
I dont want romance  
I just want my chance searching  
Searching searching  
Yeah  
Searching  
  
Just came by here by chance  
Only wanted to dance  
No news no her no no no one  
Taken back by surprise  
Whats in front of my eyes  
This girl in a loves disguise  
  
She said stop stop stop  
Get out your heart  
Havent got a lot  
But play the part  
  
Mister stop stop stop  
Get out your heart  
What Ive gots hot stuff  
The night is ours
