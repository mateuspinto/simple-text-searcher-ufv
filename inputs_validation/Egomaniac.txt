  
Egomaniac Egomaniac Egomaniac  
Feeling good inside  
Take a look around  
Suck air into your lungs  
And stride across the ground  
You know yourself you made yourself  
Drunken with the glory  
Sober with the force  
Carelessly once more to rule without remorse  
Dazzling like a diamond in the sun  
Egomaniac  
Can you hear them say thy will be done  
Egomaniac yes you could confide  
But theyd never understand the comfort you provide  
The splendor you have planned  
Something strange is happening to you  
Youre on your own can you hear them talking  
Trust is an unknown are they breaking through  
When youre the best who needs the rest  
Dazzling like a diamond in the sun  
Egomaniac  
Can you hear them say thy will be done  
Egomaniac  
Dazzling like a diamond in the sun ego may  
Weary to your bones with ease you domineer  
No challenge left to rise to  
No foeman left to fear  
In your mind you feel them breaking through  
You hardly feel the silence all the puppet chatter gone  
Who cares that no one follows  
So long as you lead on  
Could there be another point of view  
Dazzling like a diamond in the sun  
Egomaniac  
Can you hear them say thy will be done  
Egomaniac  
Dazzling like a diamond  
Dazzling like a diamond
