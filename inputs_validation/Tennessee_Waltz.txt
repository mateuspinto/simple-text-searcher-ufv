I was dancing with my baby  
To that Tennessee Waltz  
When an old friend I happened  
Happened to see  
Well I didnt know I was going to see him  
I introduced him to my baby  
While while they kept on playing  
That friend stole my sweetheart  
Away from me yes he did  
I remember yeah that night  
Of that beautiful Tennessee Waltz  
Oh you know youll never know  
Youll never know just how much Ive lost ooh  
I lost my baby my sweet baby  
While while they kept on playing  
That beautiful Tenne Tennessee Waltz  
Yeah yeah yeah now  
I remember yeah that night  
Of that beautiful Tennesse Waltz  
Oh you know you know you know  
Just how much Ive lost  
Ooh honey I lost too much yeah  
I lost my baby my sweet baby  
While while they kept on playing  
That beautiful wonderful  
That marvelous yeah man that glorious  
That cotton pickin Tenne  
Tennessee Waltz  
I lost my baby my my my my baby
