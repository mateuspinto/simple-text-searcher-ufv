Where do you walk on sunny times  
When the rivers gleam and the buildings shine  
How do you feel when the pollen falls  
And the summer clothes brighten gloomy halls  
  
And theyre all in love  
And theyre all in love  
  
Where do you fit in zip magazine  
Where the past is the hero and the present a queen  
Just tell me right now where do you fit in  
With mud in your eye and a passion for gin  
  
And theyre all in love  
And theyre all in love  
  
Hey goodbye all you punks  
Stay young and stay high  
Hand me my checkbook  
And Ill crawl out to die  
  
But like a woman in childbirth  
Grown ugly in a flash  
Im seen magic and fame  
Now Im recycling trash  
  
And theyre all in love  
And theyre all in love  
And theyre all in love  
And theyre all in love
