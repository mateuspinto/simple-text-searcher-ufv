Hook Pink  
Every time you come to town you pick me up  
Every time you come around you lit me up  
Even though youre not around you know you want me you know  
All I want to do is kick it from tonight  
All I ask is that you stay just one more night  
All I want is to here you say you want me  
  
Benzino  
See aint nobody liver  
Like DC3 Im a survivor  
I stay candid  
Four seat branded  
Front standard  
Dirt bandit with two cannons bleow   
Heres what the plans is  
A good life for me and my manss  
In the studio paid off stanzas  
So in the long run  
Every song done gotta be bananas  
From city streets to corporate suits  
From these gritty beats  
All heat and nothing sweet  
Get a good look Im here to stay  
Benzino gonna show you how the big dogs play

All I want is to here you say you want me  
  
Benzino  
Black ice on the neck and wrist thats Benzino  
Most hated at the top of the list thats Benzino  
Hangman with the gangsta hits thats Benzino  
Top dog that you never forget thats Benzino  
Watch me turn up the thermostat I burn it black  
I want the platinum plaque yall can have the game back  
Price of fame  
More friends more foes new Benz new clothes no sleep no doe  
Hate to see me doin it love the chance to ruin it
