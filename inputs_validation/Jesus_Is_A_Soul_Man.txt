Jesus is a soul man  
Jesus is a soul man  
Jesus is a soul man  
And Im sure sold on Him  
  
Oh they say that Hes a square  
That Jesus He aint nowhere  
I know better He lives in my heart  
Jesus is a soul man  
  
You can find Him in the Bible pages  
Jesus Hes the rock of ages  
He hides me in the cleft of the rock  
Jesus is a soul man

And Im sure sold on Him  
  
He calms the waves when the storm is ragin  
Keep me safe when the Devils ravin  
Hes my staff Hes my sword and my shield  
Jesus is a soul man  
  
Shadrach Meshach Abednego  
The king he said in the fire they must go  
He found out that the fire wouldnt burn em  
They were saved by the soul man  
  
Jesus is a soul man  
Jesus is a soul man  
Jesus is a soul man  
And Im sure sold on Him
