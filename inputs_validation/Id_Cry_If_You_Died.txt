Hell is where you put me  
And hell is where youre going to  
Until the next life  
I say this twisted prayer for you  
May the torment you put out  
Come back around twice multiplied  
Even though you let me go  
Ive got to let you know  
Id cry if you died  
  
The past is where you see me  
The past is what will bring you down  
Destiny a moon eclipsed  
In the shadows all is darkness now  
May the evil in your heart  
Be your one and only friend for life  
You pretend I dont exist  
I have to let you know  
Id cry if you died  
Somewhere special  
Voices form words  
  
And the words have meaning  
So I reach out for someone new  
And I wonder  
  
Will it ever be alright  
then I hear you secret radio  
Signaling that its time to go  
Hell is where you put me  
And hell is where well meet again  
I will be waiting  
  
To repeat a scene that never ends  
Molten pools of mockery  
Reflect a million sleepless nights  
Even though you acted low  
Ive got to let you know  
Id cry if you died
