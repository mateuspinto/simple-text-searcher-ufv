Someone is dancing on my grave  
Sending shivers down my spine  
I hear a laugh it awoke my soul  
The wind takes the leaves  
Where he wants them to go  
His tunes enchant our world  
Our thoughts and leave us frozen  
In this heart of mine its you I find  
Take my hand  
Ill take you to the promised land  
Youre the one  
I hear a laugh it awoke my soul  
The wind takes the leaves  
Where he wants them to go  
His tunes enchant our world  
Our thoughts and leave us frozen  
In this heart of mine its you I find  
Take my hand  
Ill take you to the promised land  
Youre the one  
Nevil whatever you have done  
These tears will fade  
Nevil wherever you have gone  
Please have faith
