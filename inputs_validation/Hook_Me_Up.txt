Hello is there anybody out there  
Im alone hanging by a thread  
Everywhere around the world  
Everybodys waiting for someday  
Calling out around the world  
Maybe someday might be tonight  
  
Chorus  
Hook me up  
Im reaching out for you come on  
Hook me up  
I know you can do it come on take me on  
  
Are you there  
Tell me what youre feeling  
Your fears and all your wildest dreams  
Everyone around the world  
Is feeling just the same way that we are  
Reaching out around the world  
Will someone somewhere throw me a line  
  
Chorus  
  
Save me save me  
Save me save me  
Hello is there anybody out there  
  
Calling out around the world  
Maybe someday might be tonite  
  
Chorus  
  
Hook me up  
Im hanging on the line come on  
Hook me up  
Make me come alive come on take me on  
  
Save me save me  
Save me save me
