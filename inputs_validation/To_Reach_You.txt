I paint a picture of you in my mind  
As I lie awake all through the night  
The anger in my heart had all been gone  
Now the longing starts to cry  
To reach you Ill fly across the sky  
To tell you we belong together  
We were meant to stay forever  
To reach you and touch you  
A cold silence is behind me now  
Id set the pain the doubts the tears outside  
Time must heal the wounds of my heart  
To love you forever is all I desire  
To reach you  
Ill fly across the sky  
To tell you we belong together  
We were meant to stay forever  
To reach you and touch you  
The anger in my heart has long been gone  
to reach you Id fly across the sky  
And tell you we belong together we belong together  
We were meant to stay forever  
To reach you and tell you we belong together  
We were meant to stay for ever  
flying high above  
To reach you
