Your reign on the top was short like leprechauns  
As I crush socalled willies thugs and rapperdons  
Get in that ass quick fast like ramadan  
Its that rap phenomenon DonDadda fuck Poppa  
You got ta call me Francis MH White  
In tanklight totes tote iron  
Was told in shootouts stay low and keep firin  
Keep extra clips for extra shit  
Whos next to flip on that cat with that grip on rap  
The mo shady Tell em Frankie baby  
Aint no telling where I may be  
May see me in DC at Howard Homecoming  
With my man Capone dumbing fucking something  
You should know my steelo  
Went from ten Gs for blow to thirty Gs a show  
To orgies with hoes I never seen before  
So Jesus get off the Notorious  
Penis before I squeeze and bust  
If the beef between us we can settle it  
With the chrome and metal shit  
I make it hot like a kettle get  
Youre delicate you better get who sent ya  
You still pedal shit I got more rides than Great Adventure  
Biggie How are you gonna do it  
  
Kick in the door waving the fourfour  
All you heard was Poppa dont hit me no more  
  
Kick in the door waving the fourfour  
All you heard was Poppa dont hit me no more  
  
Kick in the door waving the fourfour  
All you heard was Poppa dont hit me no more  
  
Kick in the door waving the fourfour  
All you heard was Poppa dont hit me no more  
  
On ya mark get set when I spark ya wet  
Look how dark it get when ya marked with death  
Should I start your breath should I let you die  
In fear you start to cry ask why  
Lyrically Im worser dont front the word sick  
You cursed it but rehearsed it  
I drop unexpectedly like bird shit  
You herbs get stuck quickly for royalties and show money  
Dont forget the publishing I punish em Im done with them  
Son Im surprised you run with them  
I think they got cum in them cause they nothing but dicks  
Trying to blow up like nitro and dynamite sticks  
Mad I smoke hydro rock diamonds thats sick  
Got pay off my flow rhyme with my own click  
Take trips to Cairo laying with yo bitch  
I know you praying you was rich fucking prick  
When I see ya Ima  
  
Kick in the door waving the fourfour  
All you heard was Poppa dont hit me no more  
  
Kick in the door waving the fourfour  
All you heard was Poppa dont hit me no more  
  
Kick in the door waving the fourfour  
All you heard was Poppa dont hit me no more  
  
Kick in the door waving the fourfour  
All you heard was Poppa dont hit me no more  
  
This goes out for those that choose to use  
Disrespectful views on the King of NY  
Fuck that why try throw bleach in your eye  
Now ya Braille in it stash that light shit or scalin it  
Conscience of ya nonsense in eightyeight  
Sold more powder than Johnson and Johnson  
Tote steel like Bronson vigilante  
You want to get on son you need to ask me  
Aint no other king in this rap thing  
They siblings nothing but my children  
One shot they disappearing  
Its ill when MCs used to be on cruddy shit  
Took home Ready to Die listened studied shit  
Now they on some money shit successful out the blue  
They light weight fragilly my nine milly  
Make the white shake thats why my money never funny  
And you still recouping stupid
