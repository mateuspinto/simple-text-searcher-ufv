I became a woman of the world cause I was fed up with the farm  
And I thought pretty clothes and city lights  
Running round both day and night could do no harm  
A party girl I mixed for bout myself into a fix for running wild  
So I wrote my dad and mom asked if I could come back home to have my child  
I received the letter from the folks back home and they said things were fine  
They went on to say that Pete the boy I broke up with was about to lose his
mind  
But I couldnt hardly read the rest the words were being bloted by my tears  
Im feelin so ashamed he loved me then he feels the same he still cares  
So Im going home for Petes sake it was I who broke his heart in the first
place  
If hell try me one more time for then Ive made up my mind  
And in the morning Im going home for Petes sake  
Yes for Petes sake my babys and mine
