Here inside the walls of Troy the Gods weigh my  
Fate from this day do I abstain to a memory of  
Hate to pay for all the blood that spilled  
The many thousands I did kill no walls can  
Contain in the Gods almighty will  
I hear the silent voices I cannot hide  
The Gods leave no choices so we all must die  
Oh Achilles let my arrows fly  
Into the wind where eagles cross the sky  
Today my mortal blood will mix with sand it was  
Foretold I will die by my hand  
Into Hades my soul descend
