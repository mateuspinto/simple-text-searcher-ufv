Red sun rising somewhere through the dense fog  
The portrait of the jaded dawn who had seen it all before  
This day wept on my shoulders  
Still the same as yesterday  
This path seems endless body is numb  
The soul has lost its flame  
Walking in familiar traces to find my way back home  
So there I was  
Within the sobriety of the immortals  
A semblance of supernatural winds passing through  
The garden sighs flowers die  
The gate was closed that day but I was bound to carry on  
She could not see me through the windows  
In dismay strangest twist upon her lips  
Graven face she said my name  
Once inside I heard whispers in the parlour  
The gilded faces grin aware of my final demise  
And I cried I knew she had lied  
Her obsession had died it had died  
When can I take you from this place  
When is the word but a sigh  
When is death our lone beholder  
When do we walk the final steps  
When can we scream instead of whisper  
When is the new beginning  
The end of this sad Madrigal
