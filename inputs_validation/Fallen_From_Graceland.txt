Rsambora  
  
Theres a line that you cross  
When you find out that youre lost  
When your world is closing in  
And it crawls under your skin  
And the hearts always blind  
When its in this state of mind  
Theres a burning light in this town  
For every heart thats broken down tonight  
Here tonight  
Youre stranded out there in the rain  
And you just cant see past the pain tonight  
Youve fallen from graceland  
Fallen from graceland  
When youre too proud to crawl  
It keeps you back against the wall  
You wanna die but you live  
With nothing left to give  
And theres no place to hide  
When youre tangled up inside  
Theres a burning light in this town  
For every heart thats broken down tonight  
Here tonight  
Youre stranded out there in the rain  
But you just cant see past the pain tonight  
Youve fallen from graceland  
And theres no place to hide  
When youre tangled up inside  
Theres a burning light in this town  
For every heart thats broken down tonight  
Here tonight  
Youve stranded out there in the rain  
But you just cant see past the pain tonight  
Youve fallen from graceland  
Fallen youve fallen from graceland tonight  
Fallen fallen fallen fallen from graceland  
And tonight  
Theres a light  
A bright light burning  
For every broken heart in this world tonight  
Deep inside  
Yes theres one light burning  
That will lead you throught the storm tonight  
Its gonna be alright  
Be alright yeah  
Gonna be alright yeah  
Its gonna be alright  
oh its gonna be alright tonight
