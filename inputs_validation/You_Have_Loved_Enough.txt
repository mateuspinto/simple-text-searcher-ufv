I said Id be your lover  
You laughed at what I said  
I lost my job forever  
I was counted with the dead  
  
I swept the marble chambers  
But you sent me down below  
You kept me from believing  
Until you let me know  
  
That I am not the one who loves  
Its love that seizes me  
When hatred with his package comes  
You forbid delivery  
  
And when the hunger for your touch  
Rises from the hunger  
You whisper You have loved enough  
Now let me be the Lover  
  
I swept the marble chambers  
But you sent me down below  
You kept me from believing  
Until you let me know  
  
That I am not the one who loves  
Its love that chooses me  
When hatred with his package comes  
You forbid delivery  
  
And when the hunger for your touch  
Rises from the hunger
