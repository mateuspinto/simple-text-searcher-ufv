Quiet nights n quiet stars  
Quiet chords from my guitar  
Floating on the silence that surrounds us  
Quiet thoughts n quiet dreams  
quiet walks by quiet streams  
Climbing hills where lovers go to watch the world below together  
We will live eternally in this mood of reverie  
Away    from all the earthly cares around us  
My world was dull each minute until I found you in it  
And all at once the happiness I knew  
Became these quiet nights of loving you  
  
  
instrumental break  
  
We will live eternally in this mood of reverie  
Away    from all the earthly cares around us  
My world was dull each minute until I found you in it  
And all at once the happiness I knew  
Became these quiet nights of loving you  
adlib quiet nights ect
