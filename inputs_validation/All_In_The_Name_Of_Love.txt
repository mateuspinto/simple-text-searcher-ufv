Big Jim Butcher was the king of the hill he ran his business with a deadly
will  
His foreman John had a pretty wife the way she looked cut Jim like a knife  
John was weak and his wife was too her name was Kate and she fell in too  
She let Big Jim do what he had to do and John stood by and his life was
through  
  
It was all in the name of love all in the name of love  
You cant change the stars above all in the name of love  
John took a bottle one drink at a time atared off in space as he lost his mind  
Knew who it was on the telephone he saw it all and he felt so alone  
  
One dark morning John stood up like a man he took his shotgun with a steady
hand  
He went to the motel broke the door in he left two holes where two hearts had
been  
He called the preacher and he called the law  
And when they got there it was pretty raw  
He said boys you better come and take me away  
Ive done all I can do in the name of love today
