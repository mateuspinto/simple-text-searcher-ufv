I want to be free like the bluebird flying by me  
Like the waves out on the blue sea  
Your love has to tie me dont try me say goodbye  
  
I want to be free dont say you love me say you like me  
But when I need you beside me  
Stay close enough to guide me confide in me ohohohoh  
  
I want to hold your hand walk along the sand  
Laughin in the sun always havin fun  
Doin all those things without any strings to tie me down  
  
I want to be free like the warm September wind babe  
Say youll always be my friend  babe  
We can make it to the end babe  
Again babe I gotta say  
  
I want to be free  
I want to be free  
I want to be free
