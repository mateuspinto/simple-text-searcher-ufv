Thirty nine my hair should be parted not spiked and green  
My nights should end at ten and not six AM  
But it is and they dont  
I still get excited when the Adolescents play  
Wake up not knowing what I did last night  
Finding out and thinking that was cool not sad  
  
I might be an adult but Im still a minor at heart  
Okay my liver is my senior part  
But thats a part you can trade in  
When your band has been a band longer than the Ramones  
And critics coin you the punk Rolling Stones  
Thats when you know this is for life
