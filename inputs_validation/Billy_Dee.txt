Billy Dee was seventeen when he turned twentyone  
Fooling with some foolish things he couldve left alone  
But he had to try to satisfy a thirst he couldnt name  
Driven towards the darkness by the devil in his veins  
  
All around the honky tonks searching for a sign  
Gettin by on gettin high on women words and wine  
Some folks called him crazy Lord and others called him free  
But we just called us lucky for the love of Billy Dee  
  
Busy goin his own way and speakin his own words  
Facin and forgettin every warnin that he heard  
Makin friends and takin any crazy chance he could  
Gettin busted for the bad times and believin in the good  
  
Billy took a beatin from a world he meant no harm  
The score was written in the scars up on his arm  
Some felt he was payin for the life he tried to lead  
But all we felt was sorry for our good friend Billy Dee  
  
It may be his soul was bigger than a bodys oughta be  
Singin songs and bringin laughter to the likes of you and me  
Cause the world he saw was sadder than the one he hoped to find  
But it wasnt near as lonesome as the one he left behind  
  
Yesterday they found him on the floor of his hotel  
Reachin towards the needle Lord that drove him down to Hell  
Some folks called it suicide others blame the speed  
But we all called it crucified when Billy Dee ODd
