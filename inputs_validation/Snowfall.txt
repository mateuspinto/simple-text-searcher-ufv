I want a snowfall kind of love  
The kind of love that quiets the world  
I want a snowfall kind of love  
Cause Im a snowfall kind of girl  
I want a snowfall kind of love  
That lights up the sky from below  
I want a snowfall kind of love  
That brings people to their window  
Wont you bury me in your quiet love  
Oh bury me in your quiet love  
Bury me in your quiet love  
And we will blow away  
I want a snowfall kind of love  
The kind of love that keeps you in bed all day  
Oh I want to walk through with you  
And watch it all melt away  
Wont you bury me in your quiet love  
Oh bury me in your quiet love  
Bury me in your quiet love  
And we will blow away
