Said the night wind to the little lamb  
Do you see what I see do you see what I see  
Way up in the sky little lamb  
Do you see what I see do you see what I see  
  
A star a star dancing in the night  
With a tail as big as a kite  
With a tail as big as a kite  
  
Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy  
Do you hear what I hear do you hear what I hear  
Ringing through the sky shepherd boy  
Do you hear what I hear do you hear what I hear  
  
A song a song high above the tree  
With a voice as big as the sea  
With a voice as big as the sea  
  
Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king  
Do you know what I know do you know what I know  
In your palace warm mighty king  
Do you know what I know do you know what I know  
  
A Child a Child shivers in the cold  
Let us bring Him silver and gold  
Let us bring Him silver and gold  
  
Said the king to the people everywhere said the king to the people
everywhere  
Listen to what I say listen to what I say  
Pray for peace people everywhere pray for peace people everywhere  
Listen to what I say listen to what I say  
  
The Child the Child sleeping in the night  
He will bring us goodness and light  
He will bring us goodness and light  
  
Do you hear what I hear do you hear what I hear  
Do you hear what I hear do you hear what I hear  
Do you hear what I hear do you hear what I hear
