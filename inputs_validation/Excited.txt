Week by week day by day  
You got me changin in so many ways  
Thinking of you i feel the call  
Somebody get a doctor  
Im starting to fall  
  
I get excited dont you understand  
I get excited cause its part of the plan  
  
Day by day hour by hour  
I get a shiver from your lovin power  
Fire in your eyes just lets me know  
Aint no way i ever let go  
  
I get excited dont you understand  
I get excited cause its part of the plan  
  
Hot love what you bring to me  
I get excited by the novelty  
Hot love like a fever you feed  
Black lace and promise is all that i need  
You bring it on  
  
I love it baby i love it all  
Anytime anytime you call  
Day or night as the world moves on  
Its time for action the talkin is done
