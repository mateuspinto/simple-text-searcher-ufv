My little brother is an insect  
He likes to crawl around his room  
His mother shudders at the sight of him  
His pappy is a businessman  
  
Every move he makes is torture  
He cannot speak words anymore  
Our sister likes to flip him on his back  
And watch little brother squirm  
  
I really like the way you look in  
Your imitation leather shoes  
And I dont want to fake it anymore  
  
He took a trip to California  
Strung out on Hollywood and Vine  
The TinselTowners came from miles around  
That little bugger felt at home  
  
I really like the way you look in  
Your imitation leather shoes  
And I dont want to fake it anymore  
  
My brother paints a pretty picture  
These things are bad as these things get  
Like dreaming bout the Mona Lisa  
And waking up in ruby red  
  
I really like the way you look in  
Your imitation leather shoes  
And I dont want to fake it anymore  
  
I really like the way you look in  
Your imitation leather shoes  
And I dont want to fake it anymore  
Anymore  
Anymore  
Anymore
