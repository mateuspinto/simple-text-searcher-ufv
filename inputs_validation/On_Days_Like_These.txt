On days like these when skies are blue and fields are green  
I look around and think about what might have been  
And then I hear sweet music float around my head  
As I recall the many things we left unsaid  
And its on days like these that I remember  
Singing songs and drinking wine  
While your eyes play games with mine  
  
On days like these I wonder what became of you  
Maybe today you are singing songs with someone new  
Id like to think youre walking by those willow trees  
Remembering the lovely youth on days like these  
And its on days like these that I remember  
Singing songs and drinking wine  
While your eyes play games with mine  
  
On days like these I wonder what became of you  
Maybe today you are singing songs with someone new
