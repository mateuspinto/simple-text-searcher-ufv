Make me fumble  
Make me fall  
Make my heart stop and start  
  
To tremble uncontrollably  
Let my eyes see fear make desire  
Keep those who long apart  
Forbid the kiss  
And leave us innocent  
Of the things some do in the dark  
The things some do in the dark  
The things some do in the dark  
  
Make me remember  
Make me forget  
Make my mind unable  
  
To force the body to do its will  
Let it be right for belief and denial  
To share a space in the heart and leave us only to imagine  
About the things some do in the dark  
The things some do in the dark  
The things some do in the dark  
  
Make me pretend  
Make me expect  
Things can go and come to pass  
  
Without trial or tribulation  
Let this life space and time  
Leave my body with permanent marks  
Faded scars and lines  
But not a single impression  
Of the things some do in the dark  
The things some do in the dark  
The things some do in the dark  
  
Let me be tempted  
Let me be torn  
But make my thoughts pure and not  
  
Morally corrupt in form  
Let us sleep tonight  
Let innocence lie in our dreams and secret hearts  
With burning desire  
A need to know and do  
  
The things some do in the dark  
The things some do in the dark  
The things some do in the dark
