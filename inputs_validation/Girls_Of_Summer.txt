When winter hush turns summer pink  
In half the time it takes to blink  
But it all depends on what choo think  
About the girls of summer  
  
When all you think of all day long  
Is a pretty face inside a song  
With a thought like that you cant go wrong  
About the girls of summer  
  
Oh yeah Do you know what everybodys talking about  
  
Some girls are all about it  
Some girls they love to let it fly  
Some girls cant live without it  
Some girls are born to make you cry  
  
Over and over again  
  
My favorite thing that drives me wild  
Is when a city girl walks a country mile  
For a boy she loves  
God bless the child inside the girls of summer  
  
Oh yeah Do you know what everybodys talking about  
  
Some girls are all about it  
Some girls they love to let it fly  
Some girls cant live without it  
Some girls are born to make you cry  
  
Yeah over and over again  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
They getchoo climbin the walls  
They getchoo caught in their spell  
They getchoo speakin in tongues  
Could this be Heaven or Hell  
To fall in love twice a day  
Is such a sweet price to pay  
  
Sil  vous  plait  
  
The best things about life are free  
The pussy willow up your tree  
To the one who climbs  
Theyll always be the girl yeah  
  
Some girls are all about it  
Some girls they love to let it fly  
Some girls no doubt about it  
Some girls are born to make you cry  
  
Some girls cant live without it  
Some girls got twenty reasons why  
  
Over and over and over and over and over
