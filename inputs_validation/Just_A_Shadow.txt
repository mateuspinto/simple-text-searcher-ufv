Again Im so alone the wine is pouring down  
No one to share with no one to care with  
The only light in my life  
Comes from the candlelight black candles left behind  
  
As Im sitting through the night  
Im so cold and dark inside  
Angel your memory will haunt me till the day I die  
Just a shadow a shadow of a man  
  
Im just a shadow a shadow of a man  
The eyes of statues standing along the nave  
They seem to follow my every move every tear I shed  
I am no longer living but I am still not dead  
  
Im somewhere in between I am of the unseen  
Must we have the other side just to feel alive  
Oh I wonder what would be had we not created me  
Just a shadow a shadow of a man  
  
Im just a shadow a shadow of a man  
The eyes of statues standing along the nave  
They seem to follow my every move  
They drive me insane  
  
Surrounded by darkness in this cold church of thine  
I try to remember all that once was mine  
I dont know what tomorrow will bring  
But if life is so divine how come I suffer so in mine  
  
How come I suffer in mine  
The eyes of statues standing along the nave  
They seem to follow my every move  
They drive me insane  
  
I am no longer of the living but I am still not dead  
Im somewhere in between I am of the unseen  
I lived a lifetime of sorrow and hate up until the other day  
Thats when I left this sick old world behind  
  
Oh how love can make you blind
