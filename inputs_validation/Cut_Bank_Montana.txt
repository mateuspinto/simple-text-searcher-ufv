It was colder than a well diggers ankles in Cutbank Montana  
But my heart was on fire as I saw her step down from the train  
Id been up there forever but her arms were finally around me  
All my icicles melted away at the sound of her name  
  
I held her to me as tightly as I held her letter  
That said I dont love him Im leaving this cold mean man  
As the train pulled away from the platform  
And I put her in the wagon  
With her head on my shoulder God knows I was one happy man  
  
And I went to heaven that night in her arms in my cabin  
In the winter of 94 there burned such a powerful flame  
They still hear her voice in the cabin in Cutbank Montana  
And the icicles all melt away at the sound of her name  
  
Hell rode into town one night on a Wyoming stallion  
His heart full of hate and his eyes full of cold jealousy  
One way or another he said  
partner Im taking back my woman  
With my hand on my gun I said Dont bet your life  
The lady says shes staying with me  
His knife was a flash in the light of the kerosene lantern  
That fell as we tangled and fought in the fire on the floor  
He was a dead man but I have been too since I lost her  
From the fire that burned me so bad as I crawled through the door  
  
But I went to heaven that night in her arms in my little cabin  
In the winter of 94 there burned one hell of a flame  
They still hear her voice in the cabin in Cutbank Montana  
And the icicles all melt away at the sound of her name  
They still hear her voice from the cabin in Cutbank Montana  
And the icicles all just melt away at the sound of her name
