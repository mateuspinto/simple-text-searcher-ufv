Can you imagine what its like seeing life  
From the other side  
Do you imagine darkened light starless night  
You might need a guide  
  
And will the illusion confuse you play with your thoughts  
And alter your mind  
Or become a delusion exclude you  
Change your existence  
For another kind  
  
See what you see for yourself til your heart  
Is open wide  
Wish what you wish for yourself and you find it there  
And you believe it  
And you believe it
