Boy of mine  
As your fortune comes to carry you down the line  
And you watch as the changes unfold  
And you sort among the stories youve been told  
If some pieces of the picture are hard to find  
And the answers to your questions are hard to hold  
  
Take good care of your mother  
When youre making up your mind  
Should one thing or another take you from behind  
Though the world may make you hard and wild  
And determine how your life is styled  
When youve come to feel that youre the only child  
Take good care of your brother  
  
Let the disappointments pass  
Let the laughter fill your glass  
Let your illusions last until they shatter  
Whatever you might hope to find  
Among the thoughts that crowd your mind  
There wont be many that ever really matter  
  
But take good care of your mother  
And remember to be kind  
When the pain of another will serve you to remind  
That there are those who feel themselves exiled  
On whom the fortune never smiled  
And upon whose life the heartache has been piled  
Theyre just looking for another  
Lonely child  
  
And when youve found another soul  
Who sees into your own  
Take good care of each other
