The color blue  
I always felt it like a sigh  
But this is new  
This blue fire inside his eyes  
With feet of snow  
I try in vain  
He makes the northern lights come dance for me again  
  
chorus  
Hes good enough  
Hes sweet enough  
Hes man enough a little touch  
I need so much  
I want so much  
I need to feel that secret touch  
Why cant I break out  
Why wont he reach out for me  
Oh Loneliness  
It comes and it goes  
But lately loneliness loneliness  
It just grows and grows and grows  
Cause here he is living deep inside  
Nowhere nowhere nowhere to hide  
  
chorus
