Now is the glimmering spinning beginning  
Of something Ive prayed for and counted the minutes  
To be in the shadows of sheltering meadows  
Of night here with you in my arms  
  
This is the moment that pauses to hold us  
As you and I move in a background of wonder  
Surrounded by countless enclosures  
Of nocturnal unspoken music of joy  
  
Counting times you have stood at the foot of my ivory tower  
And waited and called out my name by the hour  
And counted on the wings of my heartstrings  
To carry the sound I have counted on pleading  
You see how I need you come down  
  
And now between twilight and midnight I come to you  
Down in my gown of soft moonbeams and starlight  
Bright is the evening the breezes have fenced us  
And nestled against us  
  
Youre here  
And warm  
  
And mine till the time  
When the dawn will awake you  
The morning will shake you  
The highway will take you  
  
But now all the rays of the moon making bouquets  
Will swim through the luster of lingering street lights  
We count on the night to hold everything even  
And count on forgetting that you will be leaving  
And destinies folded and then in the dawn youll be gone  
  
But now as the gardens of softening night time  
Are blossoming slowly around where we are  
You and I come together  
And walk through the dreams of the stars  
  
So here while the song of the deepening evening  
Is singing to me from the light in your eyes  
We can count on each other to move to the beach of tomorrow  
And know where weve been
