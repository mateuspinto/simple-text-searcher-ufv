Twas teatime at the circus King Jimi he was there  
Through hoops he skipped high wires he tripped and all the while the glare  
Of the aching baking spotlight beat down upon his cloak  
And though the crowd clapped furiously they could not see the joke  
  
Twas teatime at the circus though some might not agree  
As jugglers danced and horses pranced and clowns clowned endlessly  
But trunk to tail the elephants quite silent never spoke  
And though the crowd clapped desperately they could not see the joke
