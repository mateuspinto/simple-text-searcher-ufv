Everytime we say goodbye I die a little  
Everytime we say goodbye I wonder why a little  
Why the Gods above me who must be in the know  
Think so little of me they allow you to go  
When youre near theres such an air of spring about it  
I can hear a lark somewhere begin to sing about it  
Theres no love song finer but how strange the change from major to  
minor  
Everytime we say goodbye
