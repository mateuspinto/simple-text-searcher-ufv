Like the weather your heart changes with each season  
Springtime summer fall and winter too  
Though I know Ill never understand the reason  
I still wonder why each season changes you  
  
It was springtime when I found you like a flower  
And our love grew warmer with the summer sun  
In the fall I could see our love was changing  
It broke my heart to see what wintertime had done  
  
Like the weather your heart changes with each season  
Springtime summer fall and winter too  
Though I know Ill never understand the reason  
I still wonder why each season changes you
