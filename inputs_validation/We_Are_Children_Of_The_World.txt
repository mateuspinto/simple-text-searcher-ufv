Tell me now how do you survive  
In your lonely lonely life  
Together we just can do it right  
Together side by side  
The more you give the more you get  
It is not a dream  
Youre getting more  than it seems  
  
Oh baby we we are the children of the world  
children of the world  
Cant you see every boy and every girl  
every boy baby every girl  
We can do we can do we can do it again  
If we have a helping hand  
Baby we we are the children of the world  
  
Tell me now theres a chance of love  
Are you sure you have enough  
Together we just can do it right  
Oh if god is on our side  
Cause we have passion we have pain  
It is not a dream  
Together we will win
