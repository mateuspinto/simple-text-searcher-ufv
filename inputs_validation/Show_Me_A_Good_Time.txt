Chorus  
How did I end up right here with you  
After all the things that I been through  
Its been one of those days  
You tryin forget about  
Take a shot and let it out  
Lets get right  
Now that Im here baby  
Show me a good time  
oh yeah oh yeah  
Show me a good time  
oh yeah oh yeah  
Show me a good  
Show me a good  
Show me a good time  
oh yeah oh yeah  
  
I live for the nights that I cant remember  
With the people that I wont forget  
Spending all the money I just work my ass off  
For the things that I wont regret  
Ive been waiting way too long long long long  
Tellin everybody that I know we about to be on on on on  
I aint tryin look like I lie to these niggas that I came up with  
Thats my team never would I let a woman come between  
What we doing right now  
This our dream Wu Tang Clan niggas want that cream  
Im the Osirus of the shit right now  
Go to god for the hits right now  
Whatever you wanna drink girl pick right now  
If you cant hold your liquor you better quit right now  
  
Chorus  
  
How bout you and all your morals and that outfit that you borrowed  
Make the most out of tonight and worry bout it all tomorrow  
Understand girl we fam girl  
Cant get me right and not do Wayne  
Cash money young money pop champagne  
Presidential suite girl Barrack Hussain  
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg  
People really hate when a backpack rapper get rich  
And start livin that life dawg  
Feels like when you gettin to that paper hip hop hates ya  
They would do it just like I do if they could  
Its in our nature  
Ah young and rich and out of control  
Out in LA blowing clouds of that killer  
I came up in the underground though  
So Im a spend another ten thousand for Dilla  
Call me overrated or created or too jaded  
Because any way you put it bitch I made it yup  
  
Chorus  
  
Show me a good time  
oh yeah oh yeah  
Show me a good time  
oh yeah oh yeah  
Show me a good  
Show me a good  
Show me a good time  
oh yeah oh yeah
