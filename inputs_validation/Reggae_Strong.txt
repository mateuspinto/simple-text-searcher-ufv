Reggae in the bathroom reggae in the bedroom  
Reggae everywhere reggae in jail reggae in church  
Everybody likes it they tried to kill it many years ago  
Killing the prophets of reggae  
Destroying the prophets of reggae  
But somebody said to all the bald heads  
Respect the Rastaman cause hes the only one  
Only one left in Jah creation  
Nobody can stop reggae  
Nobody can stop reggae  
Nobody can stop reggae  
cause reggaes strong  
You can change the style of playing reggae  
You can change the rhythm of playing reggae  
But never ever change the message every time I play it a Babylon  
A wish me fe dead a wish me fe dead  
They tried to destroy it many years ago  
Killing the prophets of reggae  
Killing the prophets of reggae  
But somebody said to all the bald heads  
Nobody can stop reggae  
Nobody can stop reggae  
Nobody can stop reggae  
cause reggaes strong  
Nobody can stop reggae  
Nobody can stop reggae  
Nobody can stop reggae  
cause reggaes strong  
Nobody can stop reggae  
Nobody can stop reggae  
Nobody can stop reggae  
cause reggaes strong
