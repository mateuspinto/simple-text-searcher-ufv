Ill start this off  
Without any words  
I got so high that  
I scratched til I bled  
  
Love myself  
Better than you  
I know its wrong  
So what should I do  
  
The finest day  
That I ever had  
Was when I learned  
To cry on command  
  
Love myself  
Better than you  
I know its wrong  
So what should I do  
  
Im on a plain  
I cant complain  
Im on a plain  
  
My mother died  
Every night  
Its safe to say  
Dont quote me on that  
  
Love myself  
Better than you  
I know its wrong  
So what should I do  
  
The black sheep got  
Blackmailed again  
Forgot to put  
On the zip code  
  
Love myself  
Better than you  
I know its wrong  
So what should I do  
  
Im on a plain  
I cant complain  
Im on a plain  
  
Somewhere I have heard this before  
In a dream my memory has stored  
As defense Im neutered and spayed  
What the hell am I trying to say  
  
It is now time  
To make it unclear  
To write off lines  
That dont make a sense  
  
Love myself  
Better than you  
I know its wrong  
So what should I do  
  
One more special  
Message to go  
And then Im done  
And I can go home  
  
Love myself  
Better than you  
I know its wrong  
So what should I do  
  
Im on a plain  
I cant complain  
Im on a plain  
I cant complain  
Im on a plain  
I cant complain  
Im on a plain  
I cant complain  
Im on aplain  
I cant complain
