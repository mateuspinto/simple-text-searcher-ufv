Oh you said it  
Oh yea  
  
Verse 1  
If I had twenty million dollars in a vault somewhere baby it wouldnt matter
anyway  
Cause the doctor told me that Im dying slowly  
So I guess I got to love you while Im here baby  
Did you know  
  
Bridge  
The news said the sky is falling the globe is warming  
My country warring leaders are lying time is running  
No where to go  
  
Chorus  
I know we just met but baby could u love me quickly quickly  
I want you to love me like you know the world is about to end baby quickly  
  
Verse 2  
You said you didnt even know my name but  
Told me we mind as well make ours the same  
What do you think baby no time  
Think it mind as well be light years away ohhh  
We just better land on the stars before they come crashing down cause I heard
the news say  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus  
  
Yea thats right baby kiss me like the world is quacking  
Do it like the earth is shaking  
You got it baby thats right lovely  
Fill me like our time is sprinting faster running out of time  
  
Chorus
