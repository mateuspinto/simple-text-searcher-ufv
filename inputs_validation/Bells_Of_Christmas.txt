The bells of Christmas go ringalingling  
They toll for the savior and the peace hell bring  
And little children everywhere are caroling  
Cause the presence of the Lord makes their spirits sing  
Oh oh oh oh  
Bells of Christmas  
Bells are ringing  
Oh oh oh oh  
Bells of Christmas  
Children singing  
The bells of Notre Dame cathedral will chime  
And everywhere a princely peace  
And there they light the candles up one at a time  
For the ones they love at Christmastime  
Oh oh oh oh  
Bells of Christmas  
Bells are ringing  
Oh oh oh oh  
Bells of Christmas  
Children singing  
The omnipresent spirit of the world will sing  
That Christ is born  
Oh oh oh  
And people of the world are all rejoicing  
For the baby Jesus born in Nazarene  
The bells of Christmas go ringalingling  
They toll for the savior and the peace hell bring  
And little Children everywhere are caroling  
Cause the presence of the Lord makes their spirits sing  
Oh oh oh oh  
Bells of Christmas  
Bells are ringing  
Oh oh oh oh  
Bells of Christmas  
Children singing  
Oh oh oh oh  
Bells of Christmas  
Bells are ringing  
Oh oh oh oh  
Bells of Christmas  
Children singing  
Ah  
Ah ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah ah  
Oh oh oh oh  
Ah ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah ah
