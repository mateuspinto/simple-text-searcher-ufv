Yeah  
  
Oh sweet Mary child of confusion she runs the hills to cry  
Past the willows or an illusion Lord tell me the reason why  
Tell me why why is it all so hard   
Breathing in the air Breathe in the air  
Anyone to care  
Oh  
  
Alright yeah  
  
Oh sweet Mary in our story have we nothing left to give   
But dont we all know babe if were pressed to that thats the way we live  
Tell me why why is it all so hard   
Breathing in the air Breathing in the air  
Anyone to care oh yeah  
  
Hop now hop now hop now hop now hop now hop now  
Hop now hop now hop now hop now hop now hop now whoa yeah
