Angels on the sideline  
Puzzled and amused  
Why did Father give these humans free will  
Now theyre all confused  
  
Dont these talking monkeys know that Eden has enough to go around  
Plenty in this holy garden silly old monkeys  
Where theres one youre bound to divide it  
Right in two  
  
Angels on the sideline  
Baffled and confused  
Father blessed them all with reason  
And this is what they choose  
Monkey killing monkey killing monkey over pieces of the ground  
  
Silly monkeys give them thumbs  
They forge a blade and where theres one theyre bound to divide it  
Right in two  
Right in two  
  
Monkey killing monkey killing monkey over pieces of the ground  
Silly monkeys give them thumbs they make a club  
And beat their brother down  
How they survive so misguided is a mystery  
Repugnant is a Creature who would squander the ability  
To lift an eye to heaven conscious of his fleeting time here  
  
Cut and divide it all right in two  
Cut and divide it all right in two  
Cut and divide it all right in two  
Cut and divide it all right in two  
  
Fight over the clouds over wind over sky and  
Fight over life over blood over air and light  
Over love over sun over another  
Fight for the time for the one for the rise and  
  
Angels on the sideline again  
Been so long with patience and reason  
Angels on the sideline again  
Wondering when this tug of war will end  
  
Cut and divide it all right in two  
Cut and divide it all right in two  
Cut and divide it all right in two  
Cut and divide it all right in two  
Right in two  
Right in two
