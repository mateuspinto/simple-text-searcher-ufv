When I was a little girl  
I had a rag doll  
Only doll Ive ever owned  
Now I love you just the way I loved that rag doll  
But only now my love has grown  
  
And it gets stronger in every way  
And it gets deeper let me say  
And it gets higher day by day  
  
And do I love you my oh my  
Yeah river deep mountain high  
If I lost you would I cry  
Oh how I love you baby baby baby baby  
  
When you were a young boy  
Did you have a puppy  
That always followed you around  
Well Im gonna be as faithful as that puppy  
No Ill never let you down  
  
Cause it goes on and on like a river flows  
And it gets bigger baby and heaven knows  
And it gets sweeter baby as it grows  
  
And do I love you my oh my  
Yeah river deep mountain high  
If I lost you would I cry  
Oh how I love you baby baby baby baby  
  
I love you baby like a flower loves the spring  
And I love you baby just like Robin loves to sing  
And I love you baby like a school boy loves his pet  
And I love you baby river deep mountain high  
  
Do I love you my oh my oh baby  
River deep mountain high  
If I lost you would I cry  
Oh how I love you baby baby baby baby
