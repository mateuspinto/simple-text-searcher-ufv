All 7 and well watch them fall  
They stand in the way of love  
And we will smoke them all  
With an intellect and a saviorfaire  
No one in the whole universe  
Will ever compare  
  
I am yours now and you are mine  
And together well love through  
All space and time so dont cry  
One day all 7 will die  
  
All 7 and well watch them fall  
They stand in the way of love  
And we will smoke them all  
With an intellect and a savoirfaire  
No one in the whole universe  
Will ever compare  
  
I am yours now and you are mine  
And together well love through  
All space and time so dont cry  
One day all 7 will die  
  
And I saw an angel come down unto me  
In her hand she holds the very key  
Words of compassion words of peace  
And in the distance an armys marching feet 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4  
But behold we will watch them fall  
  
And we lay down on the sand of the sea  
And before us animosity will stand and decree  
That we speak not of love only blasphemy  
And in the distance 6 others will curse me  
But thats alright Thats alright  
4 I will watch them fall 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  
  
All 7 and well watch them fall  
They stand in the way of love  
And we will smoke them all  
With an intellect and a savoirfaire  
No one in the whole universe  
Will ever compare  
  
I am yours now and you are mine  
And together well love through  
All space and time so dont cry  
One day all 7 will die  
  
Just how old  
  
And we will see a plague and a river of blood  
And every evil soul will surely die in spite of  
Their 7 tears but do not fear  
4 in the distance 12 souls from now  
You and me will still be here  we will still be here  
  
There will be a new city with streets of gold  
The young so educated they never grow old  
And a there will be no death 4 with every breath  
The voice of many colors sings a song  
Thats so bold  
Sing it while we watch them fall  
  
All 7 and well watch them fall  
They stand in the way of love  
And we will smoke them all  
With an intellect and a savoirfaire  
No one in the whole universe  
Will ever compare  
  
I am yours now and you are mine  
And together well love through  
All space and time so dont cry  
One day all 7 will die  
  
Just how old Repeat x3
