Tulips lips oh Luskus Delph  
Your baking breath breeds body x  
With silken measures try to gauge  
The inside sweetness of your cave  
  
Peach preserve your simmering jewel  
Hid away like orphans gruel  
Help me find the widows crack  
Make me stick like sealing wax  
  
Almonds eyes my Turkish pearl  
Burn me up sweet oyster girl  
Shove me in your steaming vat  
Make me split like chicken fat
