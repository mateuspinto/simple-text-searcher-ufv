Bless me with that special pain  
That makes a man feel right as rain  
My soulafire feelin so alive in your own way  
  
If you need a reason  
To get some healin  
If your spirits bleedin  
Then get some healin  
  
I need a new religion  
  
Laughin like a true believer  
Laughin hard the true deceiver  
Without a worry in this world no friend of time  
  
Do we get higher  
Ha ha ha higher  
Are we all higher  
In a spiritual void  
  
One for neglecting me  
And two on the way to three  
No I never felt so low I never felt so low as in this void  
  
Bless us all with what we need  
Self indulgent constant greed  
Whats mine is mine is mine you get your own leave me alone  
  
Spiritual void
