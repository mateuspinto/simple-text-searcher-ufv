I am not immortal  
I am just a man  
A powercraving tyrant  
Beyond the shadows in the sand  
  
Men have come to fear me  
Many bow and cry  
Known across the desert  
I am the one who will not die  
  
I have faced the demons of our most desperate moments  
I have been the one to defend our pride  
I have worn the banner of my abandoned brothers  
I will be the first one to give my life  
  
Lost not forgotten  
Reigning against the odds  
Feared and respected living among the gods  
Leading the empire  
Spirit as black as coal  
Lost not forgotten  
King of the deathless soul  
  
An epic novel no ones read  
Pages torn and faded  
The greatest story never told  
  
Behold the kingdom I possess  
Land of wealth and beauty  
Where the streets are paved with gold  
  
Once fearless and brave  
A realm passed away  
The ghosts of yesterday  
  
Lost not forgotten  
Reigning against the odds  
Feared and respected living among the gods  
Leading the empire  
Spirit as black as coal  
Lost not forgotten  
King of the deathless soul  
  
Lost not forgotten  
Reigning against the odds  
Feared and respected living among the gods  
Leading the empire  
Brutal and heartless  
Vanishing further  
Into the darkness  
Lost not forgotten  
King of the deathless soul
