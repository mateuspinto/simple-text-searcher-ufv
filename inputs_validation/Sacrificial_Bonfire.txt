Fire they cried  
So evil must die  
And yields are good  
So men pull back hoods and smile  
The scapegoat blood spilled  
Spittled and grilled it crackled and spat  
And children grew fat on the meat  
Change must be earned  
Sacrificial bonfire must burn  
Burn up the old  
Ring in the new burn up the old ring in the new  
Assembled on high  
Silhouette against the sky  
The smoke prayed and pranced  
And sparks did their dance in the wind  
Disguises wore thin with less and less skin  
And the clothes that were draped  
Was all that told man from ape  
Change must be earned  
Sacrificial bonfire must reign  
Reign over good  
Banish the bad reign over good banish the bad
