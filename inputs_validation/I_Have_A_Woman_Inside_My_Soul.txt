I have a woman inside my soul  
Her eyes sombre and sad  
She waves her hand to try to reach me  
But I cant hear what she says  
  
I wish I knew what she says  
I wish I knew what she wants  
I wish I knew what she says to me  
I wish I knew what she means to me  
  
I see an asphalt road inside my soul  
Its pale even in a warm summers day  
It stretches into the mist and calls me  
But I dont know what it takes  
  
I wish I knew what it takes I wish I knew  
I wish I knew what it gives I wish I knew  
I wish I knew what it says to me I wish I knew  
I wish I knew what it means to me I wish I knew  
  
I see a tombstone inside my soul  
Its old and mossy covered in dead leaves  
It stands with an engraving on it surface  
But I dont know what it reads  
  
I wish I knew what it reads I wish I knew  
I wish I knew what it says I wish I knew  
I wish I knew what it says to me I wish I knew  
I wish I knew what it means to me I wish I knew  
  
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah hey  
  
I feel snow covering inside my soul  
Its hard and shining in shades of grey  
No footsteps ever made their marks  
And I dont know when it melts  
  
I wish I knew when it melts I wish I knew  
I wish I knew when it happens I wish I knew  
I wish I knew if it happens at all I wish I knew  
I wish I knew what it means to me I wish I knew  
  
I hear a stream running inside my soul  
Its cold and clear and carries a tune  
But I dont know what it sings and tells  
I dont know where it goes  
  
I wish I knew what it sings  
I wish I knew where it goes  
I wish I knew what it sings I wish I knew  
I wish I knew where it goes I wish I knew  
I wish I knew what it sings I wish I knew  
  
I wish I knew  
I wish I knew yeah  
I wish I knew  
I wish I knew
