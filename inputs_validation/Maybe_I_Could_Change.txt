Maybe its just those same old things  
Maybe its just a waste of time  
This reminds me so much of the day you said goodbye  
And as you walked away still I would not admit  
you were right you were right  
But then now its a different state of things  
Maybe its more than I can take  
Cause it seems like the worlds against me now  
And I need someone to show me how  
But I still cant admit you were right you were right  
and I was wrong  
Maybe I could change  
Maybe I could change the world  
Maybe I could change myself  
Maybe I could change the world  
Maybe I could have your love  
Ive been holding my hopes so high  
But cant you help me now my arms are so tired  
And maybe they made the world that way  
Maybe its just a waste of time  
Just like me they turn the other way  
And just like me cant bring themselves to say  
Now I know the mistakes that I have made  
And if I try and if its not too late  
Then I can maybe admit you were right  
you were right and I was wrong
