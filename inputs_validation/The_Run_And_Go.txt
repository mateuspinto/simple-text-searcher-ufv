I cant take them on my own my own  
Oh Im not the one you know you know  
I have killed a man and all I know  
Is I am on the run and go  
  
Dont wanna call you in the nighttime  
Dont wanna give you all my pieces  
Dont wanna hand you all my trouble  
Dont wanna give you all my demons  
Youll have to watch me struggle  
From several rooms away  
But tonight Ill need you to stay  
  
Dodododo dodododo  
  
I am up against the wall the wall  
For I hear them coming down the hall  
I have killed a man and all I know  
Is I am on the run and go  
  
Dont wanna call you in the nighttime  
Dont wanna give you all my pieces  
Dont wanna hand you all my trouble  
Dont wanna give you all my demons  
Youll have to watch me struggle  
From several rooms away  
But tonight Ill need you to stay  
  
Dodododo dodododo  
  
Cold nights under siege from accusations  
Cerebral thunder in oneway conversations  
Oohooh oohooh oohoohooh  
  
Dont wanna call you in the nighttime  
Dont wanna give you all my pieces  
Dont wanna hand you all my trouble  
Dont wanna give you all my demons  
Youll have to watch me struggle  
From several rooms away  
But tonight Ill need you to stay  
  
Tonight Ill need you to stay x4
