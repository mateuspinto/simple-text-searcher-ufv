It was a lovely April shower  
It was a most convenient door  
I found a million dollar baby  
In a five and ten cent store  
The rain continued for an hour  
I hung around for three or four  
Around the million dollar baby  
In the five and ten cent store  
  
She was selling china  
And when she made those eyes  
I kept buying china  
Until the crowd got wise  
  
Incidentally  
If you should run into a shower  
Well step inside my cottage door  
And meet the million dollar baby  
From the five and ten cent store  
  
Love comes along like a popular song  
Anytime or anywhere at all  
Rain or sunshine  
Spring or fall  
Say youll never know when it may say hello  
In a very unexpected place  
For example take my case  
  
Repeat
