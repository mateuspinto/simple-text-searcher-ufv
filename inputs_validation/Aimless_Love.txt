Hes just a small fry a bit too gun shy  
To have his heart touched without a glove  
He looks at strangers as potential dangers  
Trying to steal his aimless love  
Love has no mind it cant spell unkind  
Its never seen a heart shaped like a valentine  
For if love knew him itd walk up to him  
And introduce him to an aimless love  
I been out walking kinda pillow talking  
To anyone that has the time for me  
For there are some folks they think that love chokes  
And it ties and keeps them from being free  
Love has no mind it cant spell unkind  
Its never seen a heart shaped like a valentine  
For if love knew you itd walk up to you  
And introduce you to an aimless love  
Do you look at strangers as potential dangers  
Trying to steal your aimless love  
Love has no mind it cant spell unkind  
Its never seen a heart shaped like a valentine  
For if love knew you itd walk up to you  
And introduce you to an aimless love  
And introduce you to an aimless love
