Praise Him in the sanctuary  
Praise Him in the mighty Heavens  
Praise Him  
All the earth praise Him  
  
Praise Him in His awesome power  
Praise His great and holy name  
Praise Him  
The whole world praise Him  
  
From the rising of the sun  
Let His praise be heard  
From the east to the west  
And the north to south  
  
Let everything that has breath  
Praise the Lord forever  
Let everything in my soul  
Praise the Lord
