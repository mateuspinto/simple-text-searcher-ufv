Come with me  
On a journey beneath the skin  
Come with me  
On a journey under the skin  
  
We will look together  
For the Pan within  
Close your eyes  
Breathe slow well begin  
  
Close your eyes  
Breathe slow well begin  
To look together  
For the Pan within  
  
Swing your hips  
Loose your head and let it spin  
Swing your hips  
Loose your head and let it spin  
  
And we will look together for the Pain within  
Close your eyes  
Breathe slow well begin  
Close your eyes  
Breathe slow well begin  
To look together  
For the Pain within  
  
Put your face to my window  
Breathe a night full of treasure  
The wind is delicious  
Sweet and wild with the promise of pleasure  
  
The stars are alive  
And nights like these  
Were born to be  
Sanctified by you and me  
Lovers thieves fools and pretenders  
  
And all we gotta do is surrender  
Come with me on a journey  
Under the skin  
Come with me on a journey under the skin  
And we will look together  
For the Pain within
