I was walking in the park  
Dreaming of a spark  
When I heard the sprinklers whisper  
Shimmer in the haze of summer lawns  
Then I heard the children singing  
They were running through the rainbows  
They were singing a song for you  
Well it seemed to be a song for you  
The one I wanted to write for you  
  
Lavenders blue dilly dilly lavenders green  
When I am King dilly dilly  
You will be Queen  
A penny for your thoughts my dear  
A penny for your thoughts my dear  
I O You For your love  
I O You For your love  
  
Lavenders green dilly dilly lavenders blue  
When you love me dilly dilly I will love you  
A penny for your thoughts my dear  
A penny for your thoughts my dear  
I O You For your love  
I O You For your love  
  
Lavender dreams dilly dilly lavender true  
When you miss me dilly dilly I did miss you  
A penny for your thoughts my dear  
A penny for your thoughts my dear  
I O You for your love  
I O You For your love  
For your love
