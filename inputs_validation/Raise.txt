Raise your voice out into the universe  
Raise your mind beyond the planets and the sun  
Raise where there is need youll find us there  
Raise spread the message everywhere  
The dawning of the ages has just began  
Ooh oh yes raise your voice out into the universe oh yes ooh oh  
Stand stand tall head up high above the traitors call  
We come in numbers seeking peace for one and all  
Our history if nothing else has taught us that were wrong  
When we destroy destroy the place where we belong  
Raise your voice out into the universe  
Raise your mind beyond the planets and the sun  
Raise where there is need youll find us there  
Raise spread the message everywhere  
The dawning of the ages has just began  
Oh yeah yeah oh yeah oh oh yeah oh yeah oh  
Stand stand tall head up high above the traitors call  
We come in numbers seeking peace for one and all  
Our history yeah if nothing else has taught us that were wrong  
When we destroy destroy the place where we belong
