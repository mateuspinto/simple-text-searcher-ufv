Who has dressed you in strange clothes of sand  
Who has taken you far from my land  
Who has said that my sayings were wrong  
And who will say that I stayed much too long  
Clothes of sand have covered your face  
Given you meaning taken my place  
Some make your way on down to sea  
Something has taken you so far from me  
Does it now seem worth all the color of skies  
To see the earth through painted eyes  
To look through panes of shaded glass  
See the stains of winters grass  
Can you now return to from where you came  
Try to burn your changing name  
Or with silver spoons and colored light  
Will you worship moons in winters night  
Clothes of sand have covered your face  
Given you meaning taken my place  
So make your way on down to the sea  
Something has taken you so far from me
