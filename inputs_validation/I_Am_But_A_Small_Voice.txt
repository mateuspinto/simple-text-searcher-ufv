Akoy munting tinig  
May munting pangarap  
Samyo ng bulaklak  
Sa hanging malinis  
  
May ngiti sa araw  
At kung umuulan  
Makapagtampisaw  
Malayang daigdig  
Ng kawalang malay  
  
I am but a small voice  
I am but a small dream  
The fragrance of a flower  
In the unpolluted air  
  
I am but a small voice  
I am but a small dream  
To smile upon the sun  
Be free to dance and sing  
Be free to sing my song to everyone  
  
Come young citizens of the world  
We are one we are one  
Come young citizens of the world  
We are one we are one  
  
We have one hope  
We have one dream  
And with one voice  
We sing  
  
Peace prosperity  
And love for all mankind  
  
Peace prosperity  
And love for all mankind  
  
I am but a small voice  
I am but a small dream  
To smile upon the sun  
Be free to dance and sing  
Be free to sing my song to everyone  
  
Come young citizens of the world  
We are one we are one  
Come young citizens of the world  
We are one we are one  
  
We have one hope  
We have one dream  
And with one voice  
We sing we sing  
  
Peace prosperity  
And love for all mankind  
  
Peace prosperity  
And love for all mankind
