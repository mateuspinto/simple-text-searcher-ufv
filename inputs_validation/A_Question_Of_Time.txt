Ive got to get to you first  
Before they do  
Its just a question of time  
Before they lay their hands on you  
And make you just like the rest  
Ive got to get to you first  
Its just a question of time  
Well now youre only fifteen  
And you look good  
Ill take you under my wing  
Somebody should  
Theyve persuasive ways  
And youll believe what they say  
Its just a question of time  
Its running out for you  
It wont be long until youll do  
Exactly what they want you to  
I can see them now  
Hanging around  
To mess you up  
To strip you down  
And have their fun  
With my little one  
Its just a question of time  
Its running out for you  
It wont be long until youll do  
Exactly what they want you to  
Sometimes I dont blame them  
For wanting you  
You look good  
And they need something to do  
Until I look at you  
And then I condemn them  
I know my kind  
What goes on in our minds  
Its just a question of time  
It should be better  
Its just a question of time  
It should be better with you  
Its just a question of time
