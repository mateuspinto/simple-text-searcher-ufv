Life is an adventure  
Made for an adventurer  
Made just for the boy who can  
Grow up strong and become a man  
  
Nothing will bother you  
You will do what you want to  
Laughes and loves and hopes and dreams  
Action will supply the means  
  
Living for something  
Foregiving nothing  
And youre forgiving nothing  
Cause youre living for something  
  
Fast is fast the sacred cow  
Life is in the here and now  
Got to dream and got to hope  
Broaden your horizon scope  
  
I told you once and I told you twice  
Japanese eat lots of rice  
You can be my assistant  
It could be to you detriment  
  
Ah were believing something  
Conceiving a great wealth  
Conceiving nothing  
Believing in myself  
  
Believing in myself  
Life is an adventure  
Made for an adventurer  
Made just for the boy who can  
  
Grow up strong and become a man
