Mr West Uh yeah uh yeah uh yeah uh yeah  
  
And I heard em say nothin ever promised tomorrow today  
From the Chi like Tim its the Hardaway  
So this is in the name of love like a rob would say  
Before you ask me to get a job today  
Can I at least get a raise on a minimum wage  
And I know the Government administered AIDS  
So I guess we just pray like the minister say  
Allah OAkbar and throw em some hot cars  
Things we seen on the screen are not ours  
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far  
Where Im from the dope boys is the rock stars  
But they cant cop cars without seein cop cars  
I guess they want us all behind bars I know it  
  
Uh and I heard em say nothin ever promised tomorrow today  
And I heard em say Nothin ever promised tomorrow today but well find a
way  
And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe it hurts but it may be the only
way  
  
They say people in your life are seasons  
And anything that happen is for a reason  
And niggas guns a clappin and keep to squeezin  
And Gran keep prayin and keep believin  
And Jesus one day that ya see him  
Till they walk in his footsteps and try to be him  
The devil is alive I feel him breathin  
Claimin money is the key so keep on dreamin  
And put those lottery tickets just to tease us  
My aunt Pam cant put those cigarettes down  
Now my lil cousin smokin those cigarettes now  
His job trying to claim that he too niggerish now  
Is it cause his skin blacker than licorice now  
I cant figure it out Im stickin around  
  
Uh and I heard em say nothin ever promised tomorrow today  
And I heard em say Nothin ever promised tomorrow today but well find a
way  
And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe it hurts but it may be the only
way  
  
Cause every worthless word we got more far away  
And nothings ever promised tomorrow today  
And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe  
It hurts but it may be the only way
