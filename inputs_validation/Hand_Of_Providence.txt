Providence Providence  
See it laying down the cornerstone  
The Hand of Providence its evident  
For we could never make it on our own  
Apportioning the power  
Weighing all that it entails  
Giving us the fulcrum  
And a balance to the scales  
  
Chorus  
Oh the Hand of Providence  
Is guiding us through choices that we make  
Oh the Hand of Providence  
Is reaching out to help us on our way  
  
Providence ever since  
Any thesis ever entered man  
The Hand of Providence  
Has been our best defense  
Tho his ways are sometimes hard to understand  
From the dying of a heartbeat  
To another soul reborn  
From in between and circling  
Our thoughts of love and war  
  
Chorus
