Listen to the blackbird sadly sing  
For you for me  
Look at all the pointless suffering  
Humanity  
I am dreaming of a garden  
And I see the midnight flight  
Of a blackbird through my vision  
To the light  
To the light  
She is standing in the doorway  
With the love light in her eye  
And she beckons me to journey  
Through the night  
Through the night  
Listen to the blackbird sadly sing  
For you for me  
Look at all the pointless suffering  
Humanity  
To the people who are naked  
As they breathe in amber haze  
Wandering endlessly narcotic  
Through the maze  
Through the maze  
To the leaders who are timeless  
As they flaunt their warlike ways  
Flying endlessly oer the wasteland  
Seeking praise  
Seeking praise  
Listen to the blackbird sadly sing  
For you for me  
Look at all the pointless suffering  
Humanity
