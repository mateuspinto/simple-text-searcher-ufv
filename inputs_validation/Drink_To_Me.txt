Drink to me drink to me drink to me drink to me drink to me  
A rose a carnation the lily and an orchid make such a pretty bouquet  
But only the orchid was worthy of you so I threw all the others away  
Then you took the orchid and you breathed on its petals and after a day or two  
The flower still blooms but it scents not the orchids it carries the savor of
you  
Drink to me drink to me drink to me drink to me drink to me  
  
So if youre gonna drink to me drink with your eyes and Ill never cry for
wine  
Or leave a kiss in an empty coffee cup then pass it from your lips to mine  
Cause Ive got a thirst burning way down in my soul and honey from a sugar
tree  
Is not half as sweet as the air that you breathe  
Honey come here and drink to me drink to me drink to me  
Drink to me drink to me drink to me drink to me drink to me
