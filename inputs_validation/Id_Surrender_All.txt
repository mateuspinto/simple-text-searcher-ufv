I wake up to the silence  
In a room where I once heard Good Morning Dear  
I never thought Id miss the early morning smell  
Of hairspray in the air  
All the little things I used to take for granted  
Now I miss them most of all  
Aint it funny how a woman walking out the door  
Can bring a man to crawl  
And Id surrender all  
To bring you back to me  
Give up everything I own  
Get down on my hands and knees  
Just to hear the phone ringing down the hall  
Oh If you would only call Id surrender all  
Now Im staring out the window  
Praying every passing car would bring you home  
So I could take you in my arms  
And give the kind of love  
You should have known  
And Id surrender all  
To bring you back to me  
Give up everything I own  
Get down on my hands and knees  
Just to hear the phone ringing down the hall  
Oh If you would only call Id surrender all  
If you would only call Id surrender all
