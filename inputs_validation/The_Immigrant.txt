Harbors opened their arms to the young searching foreigner  
Come to live in the light of the beacon of liberty  
Planes and open skies billboards would advertise  
Was it anything like that when you arrived  
Dreamboats carry the future to the heart of America  
People were waiting in line for a place by the river  
It was a time when strangers were welcome here  
Music would play they tell me the days were sweet and clear  
It was a sweeter tune and there was so much room that people could come from
everywhere  
Now he arrives with his hopes and his heart set on miracles  
Come to marry his fortune with a hand full of promises  
To find theyve closed the door they dont want him anymore  
Isnt anymore to go around  
Turning away he remembers he once heard  
A legend that spoke of a mystical magical land called America  
There was a time when strangers were welcome here  
Music would play they tell me the days were sweet and clear  
It was a sweeter tune and there was so much room that people could come from
everywhere  
There was a time when strangers were welcome here  
Music would play they tell me the days were sweet and clear  
There was a time when strangers were welcome here  
Music would play they tell me the days were sweet and clear
