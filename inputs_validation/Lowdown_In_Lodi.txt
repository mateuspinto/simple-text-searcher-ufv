Just about a year ago I set out on the road  
Seekin my fame and fortune lookin for a pot of gold  
Things got bad and things got worse I guess you will  
Know the tune  
Oh Lord stuck in Lodi again  
  
Rode in on the Greyhound Ill be walkin out if I go  
I was just passin through must be seven months or more  
Ran out of time and money looks like they took my  
Friends  
Oh Lord Im stuck in Lodi again  
  
The man from the magazine said I was on my way  
Somewhere I lost connections ran out of songs to play  
I came into town a one night stand looks like my plans  
Fell through  
Oh Lord stuck in Lodi again  
  
If I only had a dollar for every song Ive sung  
And every time Ive had to play while people sat there  
Drunk  
You know Id catch the next train back to where I live  
Oh Lord stuck in Lodi again  
Oh Lord Im stuck in Lodi again
