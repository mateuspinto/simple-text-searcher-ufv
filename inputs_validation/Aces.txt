I wish my life was like a John Hughes movie  
Good times and easy on the dark side  
I wish my life was like a John Hughes movie  
Bright lights always looking for a better life  
  
We were looking for each other  
In the bars on the west side  
We were looking for the summer  
When its cold outside  
  
This is gonna be good  
Life is coming up aces  
Everything is coming up aces  
We found a way to make money out of  
Broken boys and difficult girls  
  
Reality is wonderful  
We were waking up  
For the world to begin  
  
Things are so much better now  
I have a good reason to  
Want to get wasted again  
  
We were slumming for a buzz  
In a new place that used to be the old school  
We were happy for the pain of being  
Lame enough to want to look cool  
  
I really think that this is going to be good  
  
Life is coming up aces  
Everything is coming up aces  
We can make a good living out  
Of broken lives and empty hearts  
  
Aint this entertaining watching people fall apart  
  
We were wasting time waiting  
For the world to begin  
  
Things are so much better now  
I have a good reason to  
Wanna get wasted again  
  
Back home white trash  
There isnt any limit to the shame  
These people have  
  
Good people do bad things  
Have sex with an ex in the bathroom  
On their wedding day  
  
Pretty faces with no soul  
  
Everybody needs a chance to  
Win themselves a better life  
  
Everybody wants a better life  
Everybody wants a better life  
Everybody wants a better life  
Everybody wants a better life
