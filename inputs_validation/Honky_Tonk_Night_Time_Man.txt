Little bit of Bakersfield  
Im a honky tonk night time man  
I cant stand no light  
Im a honky tonk night time man  
I cant stand no light  
I get my rest in the day time  
Do my runnin around at night  
  
I had the blues this morning  
Had the blues all day today  
I had the blues this morning  
Had the blues all day today  
Well I wish a tornado  
Come and blow my blues away away  
Thats what I said take em away  
  
Sounds like Roy  
Yeah  
  
And then my heart starts beatin  
When that sun starts sinkin low  
Well my heart starts beatin  
When that sun starts sinkin low  
When the shadows fall  
I know its time for me to go  
  
Billy Powell on piano  
Oh Barry play me some dobro  
Im a honky tonk night time man  
I cant stand no light  
Im a honky tonk night time man  
I cant stand no light  
I get my rest in the day time  
I do my runnin around round at night  
I get my rest in the day time  
Gets that old love sweet stuff at night
