When Im feeling tired  
She pushed food through the door  
And I crawl towards the crack of light  
Sometimes I cant find my way  
Newspapers spread around  
Soaking all that they can  
A cleaning is due again  
A good hosing down  
  
The lady whom I feel maternal love for  
Cannot look me in the eyes  
But I see hers and they are blue  
And they cock and twist and masturbate  
  
I said so  
I said so  
I said so  
Nirvana nirvana nirvana nirvana  
  
Black windows of paint  
I scratched with my nails  
I see others just like me  
Why do they not try to escape  
They bring out the older ones  
They point in my way  
They come with a flash of light  
And take my family away  
  
And very later I have learned to  
Accept some friends of ridicule  
My whole existence is for your amusement  
And that is why Im here with you  
To take you with me  
Youre right  
Nirvana nirvana nirvana nirvana  
Nirvana nirvana nirvana nirvana
