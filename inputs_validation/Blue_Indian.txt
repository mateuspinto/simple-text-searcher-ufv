Oh Pappy left a chair like hes still sittin there  
Once I almost saw him make his move  
Brave Indian who never changes his mood  
In a painting on the wall right there  
  
Oh how long til the morning wakes  
Oh how long til the medicine takes  
  
Oh Sally buffalo in the apartment just below  
Just a bein without a care  
Oh children from my brood they come and bring me food  
Maybe open up a window for air  
  
Oh just now I smell the cornbread bake  
Oh now now now I feel the medicine take  
  
Just like home  
Where the stray dogs go through it all  
Still right here still just here  
Brave little friend  
  
Well we got a party goin on many spirits strong  
Aint preacher just a happy to meet ya  
Half a bottle neath the bed keep our spirits fed  
My hats off to you to you and you  
  
And now our brave friends too dancing circles through the room  
And a broom and a radio and a twistin out a dosedo  
Brand new day the whole worlds goin  
Whole rooms goin so  
  
Just now dont hesitate hesitate  
Oh taste the morning break morning break  
Sweet sweet young honeycomb honeycomb  
On now now now just like home just like home  
  
Oh just like just like home  
Where the stray dogs go  
Oh oh rest my bones  
Like a fresh skipped stone to it all  
  
Still right here still just here  
Still just here brave brave friend
