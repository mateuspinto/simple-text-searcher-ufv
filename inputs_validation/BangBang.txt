Bang bang you shot me down  
Bang bang I hit the ground  
Bang bang that awful sound  
Bang bang my baby shot me down  
  
I was five and you were six  
We rode on horses made of sticks  
I wore black you wore white  
You would always win the fight  
  
Bang bang you shot me down  
Bang bang I hit the ground  
Bang bang that awful sound  
Bang bang my baby shot me down  
  
Seasons came and changed the time  
I grew up I called you mine  
You would always laugh and say  
Remember when we used to play  
  
Bang bang you shot me down  
Bang bang I hit the ground  
Bang bang that awful sound  
Bang bang my baby shot me down  
  
Music played and people sang  
Just for me the church bells rang  
After echoes from a gun  
We both vowed that wed be one  
Now youre gone I dont know why  
Sometimes I cry  
You didnt say goodbye  
You didnt take the time to lie  
  
Bang bang you shot me down  
Bang bang I hit the ground  
Bang bang that awful sound  
Bang bang my baby shot me down
