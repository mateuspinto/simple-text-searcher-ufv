There is person living in my head  
She comes to visit every night in bed  
I fight the demon but it just wont fall  
The voices in my dungeon starting to call  
The spiders dancing on the wall  
Suicide of love we could have had it all  
And it is you you are the ghost behind my eyes  
The ghost that tells me lies  
The princess of the dark has made my mind home  
My haunted head and her wont leave me alone  
She dances on my heart with fire in my soul  
I hate that feeling when Im loosing control  
The spiders dancing on the wall  
Suicide of love we could have had it all  
And it is you you are the ghost behind my eyes  
The ghost that tells me lies  
I wish to god that I could sleep again oh peace again  
And wake up from this nightmare  
Free again  
Free again oh me again  
There is a woman in my head  
She comes to visit every night in bed  
The spiders dancing on the wall  
Suicide of love we could have had it all  
And it is you you are the ghost behind my eyes  
You you are the ghost behind my eyes  
You you are the ghost behind my eyes  
Behind my eyes  
The ghost behind my eyes
