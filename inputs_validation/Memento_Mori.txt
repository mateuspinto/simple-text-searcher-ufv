The fans were whirlin  
Like the blades of a copter  
Liftin into the skies above some foreign land  
Soaked with the bodies of so many friends  
  
Johnny waved  
He was on his way home  
He waved goodbye to his comrades in arms  
And all the twisted things hed seen  
He waved goodbye  
And the blades hit  
Something  
Maybe just fate but the blades hit  
The copter went up in flames  
And johnny never went marchin home  
Johnny never went marchin home  
  
They took his name  
And they carved it on a slab of marble  
With several thousand other names  
All the fallen idols  
The apples of their mothers eye  
Just another name  
  
Meanwhile  
Back on that burning shore  
Johnnys comrades stood speechless  
They looked with uhuhuhuh disbelieving eyes  
As those bits of metal and the embers  
The embers of his eyes  
Fanned out into the air  
Black dust  
Flames  
  
Oh johnny Some day theyll make a movie about you  
And in the making of that movie  
Some mad apocalypse  
It will become even stranger than the simple act  
Just a boy going up up up  
Just a boy going up  
In flames in the smoke  
Just another life  
Just another breath  
And wholl remember  
Oh eternity now  
As eternal as a sheet of marble  
Eternal as a slab on a green hill  
And your name  
And all your fallen brothers  
And all the ones not cut  
All the ones remembered only in the hearts  
A mother a father a brother a sister a lover a son a daughter  
Shall not shall not fade shall not fade  
  
Your ancestors salute you  
And the gods of your ancestors salute you  
Having having been formed by the minds of your ancestors  
The gods of your ancestors salute you  
Having been formed by your ancestors  
The gods of your ancestors salute you  
They draw you in they draw you through  
They draw they draw you through that golden door  
  
Mornin boy come on in boy  
We remember you  
We conceived of you  
We conceived of your breath  
We conceived of the whole human race  
And we conceived it to be a beautiful thing  
Like a tulip bending in the wind  
Sometimes it comes back to us  
In the form of a handful of dust  
Comes back in the form of a smitten child  
Our raped daughters ah the broken bones  
Souls cleaved from hearts  
They come back to us  
And our hands are filled with their rotting tissues  
But we turn not our backs  
We press our lips  
Into their cancer into the dust into the remains of each one  
And that love is there and will greet you will greet you  
Mornin boy come on in boy  
Its eternal love  
  
Well here go ahead run through that flame  
Awww man running through your mind  
You took a cat you took a life you took it by the tail  
And you swirled it around your head  
And you thrashed it you smashed the life out of it  
And you knew that it would be your own  
But you wanted to feel you wanted to feel it die  
Because you know you would feel your own  
You would feel your own  
But youre remembered  
Youre remembered  
Youre remembered dead  
Youre remembered dead  
Youre remembered dead  
We remember  
We remember  
We remember  
Everything  
Everything
