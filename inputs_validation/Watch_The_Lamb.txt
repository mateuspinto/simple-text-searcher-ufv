Walking on the road to Jerusalem  
The time had come to sacrifice again  
My two small sons  
They walked beside me on the road  
The reason that they came was to watch the lamb  
  
Daddy daddy What will see there  
Theres so much that we dont understand  
So I told them of Moses and Father Abraham  
Then I said dear children watch the lamb  
There will be so many in Jerusalem today  
We must be sure the lamb doesnt run away  
And I told them of Moses and Father Abraham  
Then I said dear children watch the lamb  
  
When we reached the city  
I knew something must be wrong  
There were no joyful worshipers  
No joyful worship songs  
I stood there with my children  
in the midst of angry men  
Then I heard the crowd cry out  
Crucify Him  
  
We tried to leave the city but  
we could not get away  
Forced to play in this drama  
a part I did not wish to play  
Why upon this day were men condemned to die  
Why were we standing here Where soon they would pass by  
  
I looked and said even now they come  
The first one cried for mercy  
The people gave him none  
The second one was violentHe was arrogant and loud  
I still can hear his angry voice  
screaming at the crowd  
Then someone said theres Jesus  
I could scarce believe my eyes  
A man so badly beaten  
He barely looked alive  
Blood poured from His body  
From the thorns upon His brow  
Running down the cross Falling to the ground  
  
I watched Him as He struggled  
I watched Him as He fell  
The cross came down upon His back  
The crowd began to yell  
In that moment I felt such agony  
In that moment I felt such loss  
Till a Roman soldier grabbed my arm  
and screamed you carry His cross  
  
At first I tried to resist him  
Then his hand reached for his sword  
So I knelt and took the cross from the Lord  
I placed it on my shoulder  
And started down the street  
The blood that hed been shedding  
was running down my cheek  
  
They led us to Golgotha  
They drove nails deep in His feet and hands  
Yet upon the cross I heard Him pray  
Father forgive them  
  
Oh never have I seen such love in any other eyes  
Into thy hands I commit my spirit  
He prayed and then He died  
  
I stood for what seemed like years  
Id lost all sense of time until  
I felt two tiny hands holding tight to mine  
My children stood there weeping  
I heard the oldest say  
Father please forgive usthe lamb ran away  
  
Daddy daddy What have we seen here  
Theres so much that we dont understand  
So I took them in my arms  
And we turned and faced the cross  
Then I said dear children watch the lamb
