Change the alphabet from A to Z teach the fish to walk the sea  
Tell the stars and moon to shine at noon but dont change your mind about me  
Tell the flowers not to bloom at all put the month of June in fall  
I can see it through as long as you just dont change your mind about me  
Till the day it ends my life depends on your loving me as you do  
And if I should find youve changed your mind my world would be through  
You can tell the tide to stand and wait and teach the sun to come up late  
Do away with spring do anything but dont change your mind about me  
I can see it through as long as you just dont change your mind about me  
Till the day it ends my life depends my world would be through  
You can tell the tide to stand and wait and teach the sun to come up late  
Do away with spring do anything but darling whatever may be  
Please dont change your mind about me
