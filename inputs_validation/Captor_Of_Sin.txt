Harlots of Hell spread your wings  
As I penetrate your soul  
Feel the fire shoot through your body  
As I slip into your throne  
Cast aside do as you will  
I care not how you plead  
Satans child now stalks the earth  
Born from my demon seed  
  
Hot winds of Hell  
Burns in my wake  
Death is what you pray  
Behold captor of sin  
  
Infernal slaves of manipulation  
Captive of my vice  
Abandon God the helpless one  
To relieve you of your plight  
Subversive action will not help  
It will strengthen me  
I see decline in your every move  
Death your final plea  
  
Hot winds of Hell  
Burns in my wake  
Death is what you pray  
Behold captor of sin  
  
Your skin turns to leather  
I ignite your timid blood  
You feel my lethal touch  
As I grasp your weary soul  
Ill take you down into the fire
