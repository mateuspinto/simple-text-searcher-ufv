Please come back to me  
My child  
Things werent meant to be  
Without tears we cry  
Even though we new  
It did strike  
But this aint no dream  
No this is life  
  
And all the colours fade  
Leaving nothing more  
Than a black and white shade on an empty  
Shore a part is gone  
And sure we do long  
But black and white is so much more than nothing  
Oh nothing at all  
  
Please come back to me  
Please come back to me  
My child  
Yes we do control a lot  
Yes we do control too much  
Overwhelmed by disbelieve  
Left in shock  
Still our disbelieve is the  
Remaining lock  
  
And all the colours fade  
Leaving nothing more  
Than a black and white shade on an empty  
Shore a part is gone  
And sure we do long  
But black and white is so much more than nothing  
Oh nothing at all
