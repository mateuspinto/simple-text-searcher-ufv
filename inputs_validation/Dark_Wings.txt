Why was I one of the chosen ones  
Until the fight I could not see  
The magic and the strength of my power  
It was beyond my wildest dreams  
  
Dark wings they are descending  
See shadows gathering around  
One by one they are falling  
Every time they try to strike us down  
  
Dont you die on me  
You havent made your peace  
Live life breathe breathe  
Dont you die on me  
You havent made your peace  
Live life breathe breathe  
  
Dark wings they are descending  
See shadows gathering around  
One by one they are falling  
Every time they try to strike us down  
  
Ah  
  
As they took your soul away  
The night turned into the day  
Blinded by your rays of life  
Gave us the strength we needed  
  
Dark wings they are descending  
See shadows gathering around  
One by one they are falling  
Every time they try to strike us down  
Dark wings they are descending  
See shadows gathering around  
One by one they are falling  
Every time they try to strike us down
