Deep the cellar timbers high  
Both hands point down then up  arms full length  
  
Pointed roof up in the sky  
Bring fingertips together over the head  
  
Drive the nails in straight and true  
Hammer with one fist on the other  
  
Build a house for me and you  
Continue to hammer  
  
Windows shining eyes to see  
Circle hands at eyes and peek in  
  
Doors open wide to welcome me  
Open arms wide  
  
Fire glowing oh so bright  
Warm hands in front of fire then rub hands together  
  
That is home on winters night  
Hug self as if snug and warm
