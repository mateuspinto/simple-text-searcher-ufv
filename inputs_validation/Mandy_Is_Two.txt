Mandy is two  
You ought to see her eyes of cornflower blue  
They really look as it they actually knew  
That shes a big girl now  
  
Mandy is two  
You ought to see how many things she can do  
She knows her alphabet  
And ties her own shoes  
And no one showed her how  
  
If you could see her majesty  
With braids in her hair  
Almost as though her Sunday beau  
Came around and brought her an orchid to wear  
  
Mummy is blue  
Because her little girl is going on three  
But Miss Amanda shes as proud as can be  
Cause shes a big girl now
