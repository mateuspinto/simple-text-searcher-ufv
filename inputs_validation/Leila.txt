She had a look in her eye that could make you melt  
Made me feel better than I ever felt  
But bless her heart she couldnt stay  
I begged her not to go away  
She left my ex best friend out in old Tucson  
Told me she was leavin and would be rollin on  
Now the days just pass on by  
Losin her is the reason why  
Leila Leila your mind will be flying high  
And everything will be alright  
  
You know I love you girl more than I can say  
I still think about you each and every day  
My lonesome old heart still feels the same  
So Leila wont you steal away  
Leila Leila your mind will be flying high  
And everything will be alright  
  
Leila Leila your mind will be flying high  
And everything will be alright
