Did I ever ever told you  
That I miss you every night  
And I cannot find my sleeping girl  
If I cannot hold you tight  
Did I tell you when you left me  
Theres no sun up in the sky  
An I cry so many time girl  
Just like a broken toy  
Oh I cannot stand the pain girl  
It was over I can see  
And now you told me lady  
theres a chance for you and me  
  
Just close your eyes  and stay with me  
There is a place  where I want to be with you  
Just close your eyes  take me in your heart  
I will love you pretty baby if you try a start  
  
Did I ever ever told you  
That I dreamed of you last night  
Is there anything I can do  
cause I want to hold you tight  
Did I tell you I was dying  
When turned away from me  
Took away my sweet sweet heaven  
And I lost my destiny  
Oh I cannot stand the pain girl  
It is over I can see  
And now you told me baby  
Theres a second chance for me
