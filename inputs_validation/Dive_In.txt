I saw a man on the side of the road  
With a sign that read will work for food  
Tried to look busy til the light turned green  
  
I saw a bear on TV and his friends were all drowning  
Cause their homes were turning to water  
  
A strange kinda sad big old bear  
Surely would happily eat me  
Hed tear me to pieces that bear  
  
Wake up sleepy head  
I think the suns a little brighter today  
Smile and watch the icicles melt away and see the water rising  
Summers here to stay and all those summer games will last forever  
Go down to the shore kick off your shoes dive in the empty ocean  
  
Tell me everything will be OK if I just stay on my knees and keep praying  
Believing in something  
Tell me everything is all taken care  
Of by those qualified to take care of it all  
  
Wake up sleepy head  
I think the suns a little brighter today  
Smile and watch the icicles melt away and see the waters rising  
Summers here to stay and that sweet summer breeze will blow forever  
Go down to the shore kick off your shoes dive in the empty ocean  
  
One day do you think well wake up in a world on its way to getting better  
And if so can you tell me  
How  
  
I have been thinking that lately the blood is increasing  
The tourniquets not keeping hold in spite of our twisting  
Though we would like to believe we are  
We are not in control  
Though we would love to believe  
  
Wake up sleepy head  
I think the suns a little brighter today  
Smile and watch the icicles melt away and see the water rising  
Summers here to stay and those sweet summer girls will dance forever  
Go down to the shore kick off your shoes dive in the empty ocean
