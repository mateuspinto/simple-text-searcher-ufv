The hand of God lays high above me  
Ill be good if you really love me  
Let me feel your mighty crunch  
As you rub me out like water fire coal etc  
  
Let it be known today if youve got two hands  
Youre supposed to pray  
Fingers of fire coal and lead  
Fondly love me till Im dead  
  
The hand of God is thick and callous  
Bruised and torn from stones and sticks  
The hand of God has got a ring about the size of Texas  
Made of steel and rust my fingers smear  
  
Let me try on your hand and see if it fits  
Dont worry I wont touch anything unholy with it
