I do not know why I would go  
In front of you and hide my soul  
Cause youre the only one who knows it  
Yeah youre the only one who knows it  
  
And I will hide behind my pride  
Dont know why I think I can lie  
Cause theres a screen on my chest  
Yeah theres a screen on my chest  
  
Chorus x2  
Im standing in front of you  
Im standing in front of you  
Im trying to be so cool  
Everything together trying to be so cool  
  
I cant see past my own nose Im seeing everything in slomo  
Look out below crashing down to the ground just like a vertical locomotive  
Thats a train am I painting the picture thats in my brain  
A train from the sky locomotive my motives are insane  
My flows not great okay I conversate with people  
Who know if I flow on a song Ill get no radio play  
While youre doing fine theres some people and I  
Who have a really tough time getting through this life  
So excuse us while we sing to the sky  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Repeat x3  
Were broken  
Were broken  
Were broken  
Were broken people oh  
Were broken people oh  
  
Repeat x2  
Were broken  
Were broken  
Were broken  
Were broken people oh  
Were broken people oh  
  
Chorus x2  
Im standing in front of you  
Im standing in front of you  
Im trying to be so cool  
Everything together trying to be so cool
