Arkansas land of opportunity  
Arkansas oh what you do to me  
Prettiest place I ever saw  
Was back home in Arkansas  
  
All those boyhood memories  
Lakes and rivers and Backwood trees  
Gentle mountains it reached to the sky  
Oh how I hated to say goodbye to  
  
Arkansas land of opportunity  
Arkansas oh what you do to me  
Prettiest place I ever saw  
Was back home in Arkansas  
  
Dirt roads that lead nowhere  
Except the houses that need repairing  
And front porch people wearing a smile  
And they cover every mile of  
  
Arkansas land of opportunity  
Arkansas oh what you do to me  
Prettiest place I ever saw  
Was back home in Arkansas  
  
I can see my Dad back home  
Working Park County sandy lawn  
Mama callin me from the door  
Oh how I wanna go once more to  
  
Arkansas land of opportunity  
Arkansas oh what you do to me  
Prettiest place I ever saw  
Was back home in Arkansas  
  
Arkansas land of opportunity  
Arkansas oh what you do to me  
Prettiest place I ever saw  
Was back home in Arkansas
