You can say the sun is shining if you really want to  
I can see the moon and it seems so clear  
You can take the road that takes you to the stars now  
I can take a road thatll see me through  
I can take a road thatll see me through  
  
You can take a road that takes you to the stars now  
I can take a road thatll see me through  
I can take a road thatll see me through  
I can take a road thatll see me through
