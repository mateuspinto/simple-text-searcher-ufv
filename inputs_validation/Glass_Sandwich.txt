He stood in line with the rest  
And waited got his chance  
To take his place behind the glass  
And watch the ladies dance  
  
Its the nature of things  
He stepped into the darkened space  
The air was thick and warm  
He drops the coins in one by one  
The scene unfolds before him  
  
He stands looking eye to thigh  
As she looks down from above  
Only to be recognized  
As his former love  
  
Its the nature of things
