Holly up on Poppy  
Canter never stop  
She has escaped from the world  
Where they bake beautiful girls  
Holly up on Poppy  
Trotting to the top  
She talks and banners unfurl  
Their secrets crayoned in swirls  
Everyday I  
Have to pluck up  
Courage to look her in the eyes  
The eyes of storms  
Anyway I  
Love to watch her  
Ride and play the alchemy  
That love performed  
Laughing  
Holly up on Poppy  
Everytime I  
Look at my watch  
Im reminded we are poor  
In hours per day  
Every second  
Spent with her  
s a bulging wallet overstuffed  
With angels pay  
Laughter
