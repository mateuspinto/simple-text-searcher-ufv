Home from work our juliet  
Clears her morning meal  
She dabs her skin with pretty smells  
Concealing to appeal  
I will make my bed  
She said but turned to go  
Can she be late for her cinema show  
  
Romeo locks his basement flat  
And scurries up the stair  
With head held high and floral tie  
A weekend millionaire  
I will make my bed  
With her tonight he cries  
Can he fail armed with his chocolate surprise  
  
Take a little trip back with father tiresias  
Listen to the old one speak of all he has lived through  
I have crossed between the poles for me theres no mystery  
Once a man like the sea I raged  
Once a woman like the earth I gave  
But there is in fact more earth than sea  
  
Take a little trip back with father tiresias

Once a man like the sea I raged  
Once a woman like the earth I gave  
But there is in fact more earth than sea
