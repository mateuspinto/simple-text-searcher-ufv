I spit on the streets in San  
Called the record and company man  
My enthusiasm filled the room  
  
I was young and I was keen  
With the devil in my stream  
As I hollowed at an old blues tune  
  
We cant sign your sign  
Cause were doper than the mole  
That you had on your nose and your clothes  
I should thank you gentleman  
For this life that you brought me  
Now move on down the road  
  
I remember how I used to say  
  
Chorus  
They cant stop me now  
The world is waiting  
Its my turn to stand out in the crowd  
They cant stop me now  
The tide is turning  
Im gonna make you proud  
  
Well nothing was tough  
But I couldnt get enough  
Out this rhythm and blues I crave  
  
I was singing in the parks  
Singing in the clubs  
Then along came agony  
  
All the things he said to me  
And all the things I heard  
I had a point to prove  
  
I will climb this mountain  
With this god given gift  
If its the last thing that I do  
  
And I remember thinking  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Born to ramble  
Born to sing  
In a new world of rock n roll  
Woman in particular  
Feel my heart will cry  
And if I hold my song  
  
Thanks for the faith  
Thanks for the patience  
Thanks for the helping hand  
Thanks for the love  
Thanks for the guidance  
Thanks for the talk and pride  
  
Chorus x2
