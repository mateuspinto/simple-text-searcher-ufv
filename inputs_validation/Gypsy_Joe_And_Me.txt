Dolly Parton  
We might have slept in a rail yard or camped by the river bank  
We fed ourselves from the fruit of the land  
And quenched our thirst with rain  
We never did allow no roots to grow beneath our feet  
Life just had no pattern for Gypsy Joe and me  
All we had was each other and the rags upon our back  
The closest thing to a home we new was some abandoned shack  
But we had all we needed and the rest we didnt need  
Life was free and simple for Gypsy Joe and me  
Now Gypsy was my little dog I found by the road in a ditch  
And so I named him Gypsy cause that name just seemed to fit  
Oh and Joe he was my man the flower of my soul  
Thou he never said he loved me I just always seemed to know  
While standing by the highway thumbin for a ride  
The speeding wheels of a passing car took Gypsys life  
I lost him where I found him and his loss was misery  
Now theres no more Gypsy theres just Joe and me  
Well the winter came and the snow did fall  
And the night was cold and still  
And the rags we wore were not enough  
And Joe he caught the chill  
And he told me how he loved me  
And in my arms he went to sleep  
Now theres no more Gypsy no more Joe theres just me  
While standin here on the edge of this bridge  
Lookin down I see  
The face of Joe and Gypsy lookin back at me  
And somewhere in the distance I can hear them callin me  
Tonight well be together again  
Gypsy Joe and me
