Cerulean sky over dessert fields and sand veils  
And underneath a lioness is stalking narrowing rings  
Feel her coming near she smells the blood her prey is near  
So see her hear her feel her be her  
The lioness is hunting us  
So beautiful and dangerous  
Her embrace is murderous  
Beware of the lioness  
Do you feel her gentle touch  
Her sweet caress hurts just as much  
So take care take care of her  
The lioness will win  
So close you hear her purring  
So close she smells your fear  
Not close enough to lose yourself  
Beware  the lioness is near
