Clouds descending  
Im not policing  
What you think and dream  
I run into your thought from  
Across the room  
Just another trick can I  
Weather this  
Ive got a fever above my waist  
You got a squeeze box on your knee  
I know the truth is in between the  
First and the fortieth drink  
Concertina concertina a chill that bends  
This I swear youre the fiercest calm  
Ive been in the soul quake  
Happened here in a glass world  
Particle by particle she slowly changes  
She likes hanging chinese paper cuts just  
Another fix  
Can I weather this  
I got my fuzz all tipped to play  
I got a dub on your landscape  
Then theres your policy of trancing  
The sauce without the blame too far  
Too far too far it could all get way too cheerful  
Concertina I know the truth lies in  
Between the first and fortieth drink  
Clouds descending
