Haulocost so vast  
While devestation is our homeland  
Light aint all that fast  
Vesuvious erupts our tune  
Igniting all in reach  
Leaving all in purgatory  
Until time decides to teach  
Power Drive  
Power Drive  
Power Drive  
Wilder than a charging beast  
Our methods set on death  
Elements recharge our songs  
No time to catch your breath  
The richtor scale determines  
If our instruments in tune  
Candle light the new volcano  
Power shines the moon  
Laser lights the soul until  
The final curtain drops  
Power Drive  
Power Drive  
Power Drive  
Corpses guard there dynasty  
But power never dies  
See our raging bolts of hell  
And mayhem in your eyes  
Exorcet the boiling oil  
The volume never stops  
Laser lights the soul until  
The final curtains dropped  
Leaving all in purgatory  
Until time decides to teach  
Power Drive  
Power Drive  
Power Drive
