Long ago and far away I dreamed a dream one day  
And now that dream is here beside me  
Long the skies were overcast  
But now the clouds have passed  
Youre here at last  
  
Chills run up and down my spine  
Aladdins lamp is mine  
The dream I dreamed was not denied me  
Just one look and then I knew  
That all I longed for long ago was you  
  
Long the skies were overcast  
But now the clouds have passed  
Youre here at last  
  
Chills run up and down my spine  
Aladdins lamp is mine  
The dream I dreamed was not denied me  
Just one look and then I knew  
That all I longed for long ago was you
