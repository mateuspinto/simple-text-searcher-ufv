Its been seven hours and fifteen days  
Since you took your love away  
I go out every night and sleep all day  
Since you took your love away  
Since you been gone I can do whatever I want  
I can see whomever I choose  
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant  
But nothing  
I said nothing can take away these blues  
  
Cause nothing compares  
Nothing compares to you  
  
Its been so lonely without you here  
Like a bird without a song  
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling  
Tell me baby where did I go wrong  
I could put my arms around every boy I see  
But theyd only remind me of you  
I went to the doctor nguess what he told me  
Guess what he told me  
He said girl you better try to have fun  
No matter what youll do  
But hes a fool  
  
Cause nothing compares  
Nothing compares to you  
  
All the flowers that you planted mama  
In the back yard  
All died when you went away  
I know that living with you baby was sometimes hard  
But Im willing to give it another try  
  
Nothing compares  
Nothing compares to you  
Nothing compares  
Nothing compares to you  
Nothing compares  
Nothing compares to you
