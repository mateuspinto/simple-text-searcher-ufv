Some say that we should not be together  
And that I deserve so much better  
But they are just blind  
I would choose to be with you or simply die  
You would be blind to not see how I feel  
And that my love is strong and real  
  
Baby can you see  
How much you mean to me  
Can you see that I would die for you  
Or are you just blind too  
  
Some people dont see very much  
But they can see I love your every touch  
Every now and then  
I feel your touch upon my skin  
It sends chills down my spine  
Im going to love you till the end of time  
  
Baby can you see  
How much you mean to me  
Can you see that I would die for you  
Or are you just blind too  
  
Those who can see it all  
Can see that it is for you Im going to fall  
You make me feel so happy you make me smile  
You make my whole life worth while  
Sometimes baby we fight  
But its because I love you and its going to be alright  
  
Baby can you see  
How much you mean to me  
Can you see that I would die for you  
Or are you just blind too
