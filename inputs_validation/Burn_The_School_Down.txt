She said  
I lost my best friend last week at school  
He got shot  
Someone thought that he was part of something that  
He was not  
Now Im watching all the cheerleaders show just how sad they are  
When my friend used to come round  
They used to laugh and egg his car  
Now Im gonna do my part as a concerned citizen  
I think we should burn the school down  
And start again  
Burn it  
Till theres nothing left  
Burn it  
Just like all the rest  
Burn it  
Clear up all this mess  
Burn it down  
Education for the nation  
Kids retaliate on each station  
Expectation violation  
Pressure increased in each generation  
Burn the school down  
Burn the school down  
Burn the school down she said  
Burn the school down  
Burn the school down  
Burn the school down start again  
Cause now what I want to know  
Will the eyes inside the back of your mind let it go  
Now all I want to know  
Will the eyes inside the back of your mind let it go  
She says  
I want to feel more comfort in my own skin  
But everyone around me makes me feel like  
Im worth less than them  
Burn the school down  
Burn the school down  
Burn the school down she said  
Burn the school down  
Burn the school down  
Burn the school down start again  
Burn it  
Till theres nothing left  
Burn it  
Just like all the rest  
Burn it  
Clear up all this mess  
Burn it down  
Cause now what I want to know  
Will the eyes inside the back of your mind let it go  
Now all I want to know  
Will the eyes inside the back of your mind let it go  
Now all I want to know  
Will the eyes inside the back of your mind let it go  
Now all I want to know  
Will the eyes inside the back of your mind let it go  
Burn the school down
