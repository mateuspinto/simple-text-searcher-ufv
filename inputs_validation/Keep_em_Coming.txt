 bown   
Keep em coming  
Nose to tail  
Keep em coming  
Love for sale  
Alloy spokes leather trim  
Walnut dash looks good on him  
Twenty four valves set to sing  
Keep em coming  
Furry dice  
Keep em coming  
Well aint that nice  
Auto sunroof heated seat  
Air conditioned naturally  
About as cool as I can be  
Keep em coming  
Keep em coming  
Cruise control  
The motorway  
Its the freedom that I love  
And I want to sail  
I want to sail  
Away away away  
Away away away  
Keep em coming  
Nodding dog  
Keep em coming  
I love that smog  
Longer hoods wider boots  
Sell me one that loops the loop  
Before we all  
Go down the tubes  
Keep em coming  
Knock em out  
Keep em coming  
Cruise control  
The motorway  
Its the freedom that I love  
And I want to sail  
I want to sail  
Away away away  
Away away away
