Uncle Sam is a naughty old man  
He says he wants you but he only wants to use you  
He has a woman named Elizabeth she walk the streets selling her body for  
Glory immorality  
They get drunk from the blood of saints not the kind that are made into  
Statues  
Her brother john drinks wine all day he and his friends trying to take our  
Souls away  
Oh its sad to say but uncle sam is gonna have his day  
They will weep for Elizabeth
