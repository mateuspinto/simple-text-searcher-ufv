Nocturne was released as an instrumental piece However there were lyrics  
Written for it These are those lyrics  
  
When it rains  
I watch the window  
Golden dreams  
Wash down the willow  
Where are my Mardi Gras memories  
Under silver seas  
  
Long cold nights  
Change my reflection  
Unsung songs  
Show my direction  
Where are my make believe victories  
Under silver seas  
  
Ships pass over my head  
Purple and blue yellow and red  
White sails catching the breeze  
Sailing on silver seas  
  
Once I lived  
You might remember  
Born in May  
Died in September  
Where are my carousel fantasies  
Under silver seas
