Intro kung fu sample from 8 Diagram Pole Fighter  
Today Ill talk about kindness  
Justice faith and kindness  
I want you to listen carefully  
Kindness and faith are the foundation  
Without them we cant become good people  
And with justice we know we can lead a good life  
And how can I be a good man then eh  
Well first of all you have to practice honesty  
Uhmm  
Keep your temper never lose control of yourself  
Keep control  
Be patient if you learn to do these things you can master anything  
  
Chorus The Persuasions Gypsy Woman sample  
Out of nowhere there came a caravan  
This was around a campfire light  
A lovely woman in motion  
Her hair was as dark as the night  
  
Method Man  
Cruising on the interstate just follow while I innovate  
Too many try and imitate medallion like a dinner plate  
Front and get ya dinner ate chinchilla for the winter wait  
Im trying to bring the Sexy Back like Timbaland and Timberlake  
Spitting like a calico kush from a Cali hoe  
Tell that joker tally ho put shots in that Denali yo  
RZA you know how we go on them 20s thats how we roll  
And I dont eat berries but eat a Berry like Halle though  
The game criminal my my chain figaro  
My my dames pigeontoed Im still the same nigga though  
Uh kid rock a fitted low still got a wicked flow  
And Im like Barry Bonds on anything that RZA throw  
  
Ghostface Killah  
On anything that RZA throw Ironmans invisible  
I left my chick for cheating on me now that bitch is miserable  
Popping bottles painting hella Wallos on my physical  
We gon have a ball might as well pick a testicle  
  
Purple haze festivals smoke a nigga like a bowl  
Fuck a coma now the state you laying is a vegetable  
You wanna see me Like you aint checkable  
You like a CD I burn you and I wrecked a few  
  
Chorus  
  
Interlude kung fu sample RZA  
Only God has lept into avenged mind  
And can distinguish good from evil  
Hahaha Aiyo Cappa  
  
Cappadonna  
We gotta get more cake together so we could branch out  
Preserve land get a boat and a ranch house  
Call me a dreamer but I hustle for real  
You thought that I fell off but now Im attacking the field  
All in Chicago grinding putting it down  
Crush blocks of MCs I aint playing around  
Yo you heard me on The Bassment giving it to em  
Fake dudes hiding they self but I could see through em  
Diggler what Im trying to live and raise kids  
While you throwing up ya sign Im laying em down kid  
Plus Im back home now doing my thing  
Thirty dollars to Medina just to cop me a ring  
  
Chorus 2X  
  
Outro kung fu sample  
A good friend holds his drink  
Bad company makes bad wine  
Drinking among friends  
Red wine means a good life  
A few drinks bring comfort  
Two drinks are enough  
Money cant buy courage  
Riches mean nothing to us  
Brilliant a display of genius
