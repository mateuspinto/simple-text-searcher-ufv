I drove really fast before I hit the wall  
I was punch drunk spinnin round heading for a fall  
Do or die now got scared so I stalled  
You can have it all  
Your eyes inside the back of my mind  
Stars collide to see who outshines  
Your eyes inside the back of my mind  
Its making me blind  
We can hate  
We can hate each other  
We can be down then fuck one another  
We can hold it up then set it on fire  
Life is sacrifice and you can be a martyr  
But its more than I can stand  
When youre looking down on me  
Cause I cant live up to you that makes me incomplete  
I never wanted anything more  
So Ill just say goodbye and watch you walk out the door  
I want to be all you want me to be  
I want to be all you think that you see  
Would you leave me here when nobody cares  
I tried really hard not to care at all  
Medicate myself  
Xanax alcohol  
My admissions made me feel so small  
You can keep it all  
I can change  
We can change for each other  
We can let go and accept one another  
We can tear it down to the ground and start over  
Life is compromise Repeat x2  
So if I let you down then Ill pick you up again  
In the end  
Suspend confidence in me to come through  
To be who I want to be and to do what I want to do  
Never turn my back on you
