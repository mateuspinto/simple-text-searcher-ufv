I chasing a  
Ilucion this down  
The moon shows me a  
Shortcut to town  
This is strange strange I know  
But what else can we do  
  
Show me all all around  
Not to trip I want hear a sound  
But longer be  be  be bound  
Here we go  
  
Woohhaaohooh  
Is like a dream  
Woohhaaohooh  
Is very extreme  
Woohhaaohooh  
The perfect team  
That you and I are my love  
  
Chorus  
  
Never will clarify the reality  
Is something special but a fantasy  
You know that love is well  
Woooah  
A misstep  tep  
I feel in your heart more more  
A small token of love  
You know that love is well  
Woooah  
A misstep  tep  
  
As in the horror movie to be lame  
I just love these here is the same  
A small and neglect is the end  
No no the end Yeah  
Finds it a new way to say now  
Commenters a way to feel now  
This is live my love your ball  
Back to losing control  
  
Woohhaaohooh  
Is like a dream  
Woohhaaohooh  
Is very extreme  
Woohhaaohooh  
The perfect team  
That you and I are my love  
  
Chorus  
  
Never will clarify the reality  
Is something special but a fantasy  
You know that love is well  
Woooah  
A misstep  tep  
I feel in your heart more more  
A small token of love  
You know that love is well  
Woooah  
A misstep  tep  
  
A misstep tep x8  
  
Now my love  
Loses control  
And  
Back home  
Here we go  
Look the sun  
Everything is fun  
And  
Look the moon  
I wanna know  
  
Chorus  
  
Never will clarify the reality  
Is something special but a fantasy  
You know that love is well  
Woooah  
A misstep  tep  
I feel in your heart more more  
A small token of love  
You know that love is well  
Woooah  
A misstep  tep  
  
You know that love is well  
A misstep  tep  
Wooah
