You make my pants wanna get up and dance  
You make my face wanna grin  
You make my knees kneel down say please  
Honey wont you kiss me again  
  
You make my pants wanna get up and dance  
You make my face wanna grin  
You make my knees kneel down say please  
Honey wont you kiss me again  
  
I was a lost and a lonely man  
I get through life the best I can  
Ever since that day I laid my eye on you  
That day I decided what I had to do  
  
You make my pants wanna get up and dance  
You make my face wanna grin  
You make my knees kneel down say please  
Honey wont you kiss me again  
  
Start the music strike up the band  
I never did the boogie but I bet that I can  
Never met a girl half as sweet as you  
Nobody ever moved that the move you do  
  
You make my pants wanna get up and dance  
You make my face wanna grin  
You make my knees kneel down say please  
Honey wont you kiss me again  
  
Honey wont you kiss me  
Honey wont you kiss me  
Honey wont you kiss me again  
Oh yeah alright
