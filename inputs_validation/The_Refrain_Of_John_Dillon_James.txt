  
Oh John Dillon James was my good time country buddy  
Well we hunted talked and fished his last days away  
He was just a hired farm hand worked old man Walkers land  
Retired on his 68th birthday  
Yeah he wore a size sixteen shoe had skin like alligator  
Lord he could pick up a deer and walk right out of those woods  
Old Dillon had a million tales but he sung me one refrain  
And I recall that song by John Dillon James  
  
One July Monday morning I met him at the fishing hole  
But old Dillon wasnt toting his half pint of tin hide  
His roll your own tobacco string was ahanging from his pocket  
His eyes were red as beets looked like he cried  
And I know he sat on knees cause his overalls were muddy  
But my ten year old mind didnt understand  
He sat down on the bank and wrote this four line refrain  
And I recall that song by John Dillon James  
  
Well I got my ticket for the ride in the sky  
Ive been talking to the man Im gonna fly  
Paid the price down on my knees  
A voice from heaven promised me  
I got my ticket for the ride in the sky  
  
Well it was one year to the day on a July Monday morning  
I waited at the fishing hole but old Dillon he didnt show  
Daddy came down about noon and said  
Son Ive got some news  
Lords rested old Dillons soul  
Yeah and I walked up to his bedside  
Looked down at old big Dillon  
Lord knows that I saw a pair of wings  
That tables set but I felt good for at last I understood  
That refrain sung by John Dillon James  
  
Well I got my ticket for the ride in the sky Lord yall  
Ive been talking to the man Im gonna fly Im gonna fly  
I paid the price down on my knees  
A voice from heaven promised me  
Well I got my ticket for the ride in the sky  
Yeah I got my ticket for the ride in the sky
