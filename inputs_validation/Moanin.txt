Moanin my life slowly away  
Sittin here waitin for the new commin day  
They try to cheer me as I trudge on my way  
Moanin for you  
  
Cant seem to hide it and why should I try  
Good Lord he knows it up there in the sky  
A million heartaches with your last goodbye  
Left me moanin for you  
  
Work these poor fingers way down to the bone  
When things seemed right my whole world went wrong  
Then I found your letter baby sayin so long  
Ive been moanin for you  
  
They find me alone at the close of the day  
Countin each petal from your rose bouquet  
Guess Ill be here till eternity  
Moanin for you  
  
This ole rockin chair I have rocked it apart  
The last spark of flame in my fireplace is dark  
But this old flame thats burnin deep down in my heart  
Keeps me moanin for you  
  
Work these poor fingers way down to the bone  
When things seemed right my whole world went wrong  
Then I found your letter baby sayin so long  
Ive been moanin for you
