You and I we are strangers by one chromosome  
Slave to the hormone body and soul  
In a struggle to be happy and free  
Swimming in a primitive sea  
  
You and I we must dive below the surface  
A world of red neon and ultramarine  
Shining bridges on the ocean floor  
Reaching to the alien shore  
  
For you and me  Sex is not a competition  
For you and me  Sex is not a job description  
For you and me  We agree  
  
You and I we are pressed into these solitudes  
Color and culture language and race  
Just variations on a theme  
Islands in a much larger stream  
  
For you and me  Race is not a competition  
For you and me  Race is not a definition  
For you and me  We agree  
  
Reaching for the alien shore  
  
You and I we reject these narrow attitudes  
We add to each other like a coral reef  
Building bridges on the ocean floor  
Reaching for the alien shore  
  
For you and me  We hold these truths to be selfevident  
For you and me  Wed elect each other president  
For you and me  We might agree  
But thats just us  
  
Reaching for the alien shore
