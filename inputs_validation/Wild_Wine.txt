Wild wine  before your castle  
Wild wine  I am ready  
Arrival is announced  only for the king  
God stand by me  and open your gates  
Wild wine  and totally slow  
Wild wine  so warm and moist  
Wild wine  before your lap  
Wild wine  it has been written  
Deep in the water  you dont cross  
But my desire  laughs at the wings  
Wild wine  like a dove  
Wild wine  so wet and hot  
Wild wine  before this darkness  
Wild wine  healed by the light  
It stays hidden  otherwise we could defend ourselves  
I wait for you  at the end of the night  
Wild wine  only a grape  
Wild wine  and bitter like snow  
I wait for you  at the end of the night
