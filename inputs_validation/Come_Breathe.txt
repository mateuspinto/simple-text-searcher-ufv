I need You Holy Spirit  
Come touch me with Your oil of anointing  
I need You Holy Spirit  
Come touch me once again  
I need You Holy Spirit  
Come touch me with Your oil of anointing  
I need You Holy Spirit  
Come touch me once again  
And as I reach for You  
Unconscious of Your calling  
That with Your touch I need to reach the lost  
Come breathe  
Come breathe  
Come breathe Your breath of life  
Come breathe  
Come breathe  
Come breathe Your breath of life  
I need You Holy Spirit  
Come touch me with Your oil of anointing  
I need You Holy Spirit  
Come touch me once again  
I need You Holy Spirit  
Come touch me with Your oil of anointing  
I need You Holy Spirit  
Come touch me once again  
And as I reach for You  
Unconscious of Your calling  
That with Your touch I need to reach the lost  
Come breathe  
Come breathe  
Come breathe Your breath of life  
Come breathe  
Come breathe  
Come breathe Your breath of life  
And as I reach for You  
Unconscious of Your calling  
That with Your touch I need to reach the lost  
Come breathe  
Come breathe  
Come breathe Your breath of life  
Come breathe  
Come breathe  
Come breathe  
Come breathe  
Come breathe  
Come breathe  
Come breathe  
Come breathe  
Come breathe  
Come breathe  
Come breathe Your breath of life  
Come breathe  
Come breathe  
Come breathe Your breath of life
