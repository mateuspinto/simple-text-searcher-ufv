The heart of the city street was beating  
Light from the neons turned the dark to day  
We were too hot to think of sleeping  
We had to get out before the magic got away  
  
Chorus  
We were running with the night  
Playing in the shadows  
Just you and I til the morning light  
We were running running with the night  
  
You were looking so good girl heads were turning  
You and me on the town ooh we let it all hang out  
The fire was in us we were burning  
We were gonna go all the way and we never had a doubt  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge  
We were so in love you and me  
On the boulevard wild and free  
Giving all we got we laid it down  
Taking every shot we took the town  
  
Chorus  
  
Just you and I we were running  
We were running with the night  
Playing in the shadows  
Just you and I girl it was so right We were running  
Girl so right running with the night  
So right
