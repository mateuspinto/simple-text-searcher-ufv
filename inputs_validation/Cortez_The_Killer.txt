He came dancing across the water  
With his galleons and guns  
Looking for the new world  
In that palace in the sun  
  
On the shore lay Montezuma  
With his coca leaves and pearls  
In his halls he often wondered  
With the secrets of the worlds  
  
And his subjects gathered round him  
Like the leaves around a tree  
In their clothes of many colors  
For the angry gods to see  
  
And the women all were beautiful  
And the men stood straight and strong  
They offered life in sacrifice  
So that others could go on  
  
Hate was just a legend  
And war was never known  
The people worked together  
And they lifted many stones  
  
They carried them to the flat lands  
And they died along the way  
But they built up with their bare hands  
What we still cant do today  
  
And I know shes living there  
And she loves me to this day  
I still cant remember when  
Or how I lost my way  
  
He came dancing across the water  
Cortez Cortez  
What a killer
