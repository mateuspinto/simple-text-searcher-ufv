You are my strength when I am weak  
You are the treasure that I seek  
You are my all in all  
Seeking You as a precious jewel  
Lord to give up Id be a fool  
You are my all in all  
  
Taking my sin my cross my shame  
Rising up again I bless Your name  
You are my all in all  
When I fall down You pick me up  
When I am dry You fill my cup  
You are my all in all  
  
Jesus Lamb of God  
Worthy is Your name  
Jesus Lamb of God  
Worthy is Your name

Taking my sin my cross my shame  
Rising up again I bless Your name

When I fall down You pick me up  
When I get dry You fill my cup  
You are my all in all  
  
Jesus Lamb of God  
Worthy is Your name
