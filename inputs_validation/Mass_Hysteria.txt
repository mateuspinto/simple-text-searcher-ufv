Sing us a song of the century  
  
That sings like american eulogy  
  
The damn of my love and conspiracy  
  
Of forgotten hope and class of 13  
  
Tell me a story into that goodnight  
  
Sing us a song for me  
  
Mass hysteria  
Mass hysteria  
Mass hysteria  
Mass hysteria  
  
Red alert is the color of panic  
Elevated to the point of static  
Beating into the hearts of the fanatics  
And the neighborhoods a loaded gun  
Idle thought leads to fullthrottle screaming  
And welfare is asphyxiating  
Mass confusion is all the new rage  
And its creating a feeding ground  
For the bottom feeders of hysteria  
  
Mass hysteria  
Mass hysteria  
Mass hysteria  
Mass hysteria  
  
True sounds of maniacal laughters  
And the deafmute is misleading the choir  
The punch line is a natural disaster  
And its sung by the unemployed  
Fight fire with a riot  
The class war is hanging on a wire  
Because the martyr is a compulsive liar  
When he said  
its just a bunch of niggers throwing gas into the hysteria  
  
Mass hysteria  
Mass hysteria  
Mass hysteria  
Mass hysteria  
  
Theres a disturbance on the oceanside  
They tapped into the reserve  
The static response is so unclear now  
Mayday this is not a test  
As the neighborhood burns America is falling  
Vigilantes warning you  
Calling Christian and Gloria
