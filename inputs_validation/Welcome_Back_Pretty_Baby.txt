Hello pretty baby  
How did your vacation go   
You know I long to be with you  
Because I really missed you so  
You must have many things to tell me  
But only one I yearn to know  
Shall we dance pretty baby  
And does your love for me remain   
Its been a long hot summer  
With no one to entertain  
Ah its really boss to hold your hand baby  
Dance and talk with you again  
Bye bye for now  
But I shall call you on the phone  
I want to tell you how boss it was  
To have been your chaperone  
And if you choose me for your steady  
Darling youll never walk alone
