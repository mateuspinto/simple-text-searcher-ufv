A dirty wind blows through the sky  
And the autumn leaves cut loose and fly  
Leave me watching  
And wishing I could follow  
Though among the regrets that I cant get by  
There are just one or two  
Unkind things I said to you  
Daddy what was I supposed to do  
I dont know why it was so hard to talk to you  
I guess my anger pulled me through  
  
No sooner had I hit the streets  
When I met the fools that a young fool meets  
All in search of truth and bound for glory  
And listening to our own heartbeats  
We stood around the drum  
Though its fainter now  
The older I become  
Living your life day after day  
Soon all your plans and changes  
Either fail or fade away  
Leaving so much still left to say  
  
But Daddy I want to let you know somehow  
The things you said are so much clearer now  
And I would turn the pages back  
But time will not allow  
The way these days just rip along  
Too fast to last too vast too strong  
  
Somewhere something went wrong  
Or maybe we forgot the song  
Make room for my fortyfives  
Along beside your seventyeights  
Nothing survives  
But the way we live our lives
