Tonight every word will be spoken easy  
All our stories lead on to fortune and fame  
Rack em up and shoot  
But the cue ball is missing  
By tomorrow though well all play different games  
  
Anytime we dance takes us closer to glory  
  
The blue jay flew a little to low down today  
Now that kittycats finally purring out smiles  
Only cry for so long til youre just watering stones  
Go full circles crawling all those last miles  
  
Anytime we dance takes us closer to glory  
Anytime we love brings us closer  
  
Our lips just moved closer than ever  
To naming the feelings weve been made of for all these years  
Cliches are frayed teeth trying to feed a hungry old soul  
Words of love though will bite back all of those tears  
  
Anytime we dance takes us closer to glory  
Anyway we make love  
Anyway we love  
Take us closer to glory  
Anytime we dance
