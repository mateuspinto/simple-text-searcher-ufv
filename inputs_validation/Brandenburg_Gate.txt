I would cut my legs and tits off  
When I think of Boris Karloff and Kinski  
In the dark of the moon  
It made me dream of Nosferatu  
Trapped on the isle of Doctor Moreau  
Oh wouldnt it be lovely  
  
Small town girl  
Small town girl  
Small town girl  
  
I was thinking Peter Lorre  
When things got pretty gory as I  
Crossed to the Brandenburg Gate  
I was feeling snappy perhaps Id been napping  
As I just ate  
A following heart can tear you apart  
On a midnight to eight shift  
A graveyard romance can only give one chance  
As the tombstones weave and breathe  
  
Small town girl  
Small town girl  
  
Feeling happy when my heart got beating  
On a Sunday afternoon  
I dreamt of breezes going through the treeses  
And stars were still illumed  
I have three hearts that I keep apart  
Trying to relate  
To normal feelings and the nighttime reeling  
And some absinthe drunk so late  
  
Small town girl  
My small town girl  
  
The cook got drunk and all the whores they shrunk  
Onto the size of dessert plates  
But me Im happy cause I got my little nappy  
And some opium to set me straight  
Im just a small town girl who wants to give it a whirl  
While my looks still hold me straight  
  
Straight up to illusion and fantasys fusion  
Of reality mixed with drink  
Im just a small town girl whos gonna give life a whirl  
Looking at the Brandenburg Gate  
  
Small town giving it a whirl  
Brandenburg Gate  
Small town girl  
Small town girl
