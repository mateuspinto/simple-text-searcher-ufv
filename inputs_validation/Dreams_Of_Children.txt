I sat alone with the dreams of children  
Weeping willows and tall dark building  
Ive caught a fashion from the dreams of children  
But woke up sweating from this modern nightmare and  
I was alone no one was there  
I was alone no one was there  
I caught a glimpse from the dreams of children  
I got a feeling of optimism  
But woke up to a grey and lonely picture  
The streets below left me feeling dirty and  
I was alone no one was there  
I was alone no one was there  
Somethings gonna crack on your dreams tonight  
You will crack on your dreams tonight  
I fell in love with the dreams of children  
I saw a vision of all the happy days  
Ive caught a fashion from the dreams of children  
But woke up sweating from this modern nightmare and  
I was alone no one was there  
I was alone no one was there  
Somethings gonna crack on your dreams tonight  
You will crack on your dreams tonight  
You will choke on your dreams tonight
