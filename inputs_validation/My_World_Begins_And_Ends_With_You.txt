My world was no more than a dream  
And waitin on a dream can sure get lonely  
Your love just fell right into place  
And filled and empty space to overflowing overflowing  
My world begins with havin a friend when Im feeling blue  
My world would end if ever I heard you say we were through  
Just dont know what Id do  
Cause my world begins and ends with you  
Sometimes I tell little lies to see if your eyes are looking through me  
But you know lyings not my style  
I just need your smile coming to me  
Reassuring me  
My world begins with havin a friend when Im feeling blue  
My world would end if ever I heard you say we were through  
Just dont know what Id do  
Cause my world begins and ends with you
