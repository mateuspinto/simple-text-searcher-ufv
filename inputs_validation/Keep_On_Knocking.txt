She wrote me a letter  
In the early days of December  
Saying she wasn t happy  
Where she was  
Oh that s the bad news yeah  
That is why today I m here  
To take her away from you  
Everytime you treat her badly  
It brings back memories and  
We don t want  
To see her go through  
Hurt again so  
  
Chorus  
Keep on knocking but you  
Can t come in now  
  
She s my mother you know  
If she was a bad mother  
She would have thrown us away  
Long time ago  
Even when things got bad  
She still held onto us all the way  
When she cries we cry too  
When she smiles we smile too  
We were happy all this time  
Until you came along  
Everytime you treat her badly  
It brings back memories and  
We don t want to see her  
Go through hurt again  
  
Chorus till fade
