When I told my baby  
Do what you wanna do  
Well I had no idea  
Just what shed put me through  
  
Every night shes runnin round  
Singin songs in your hometown  
There aint no one to love me  
When the sun goes down  
  
Chorus  
Well shes everybodys sweetheart  
Everybodys sweetheart but mine  
I shoulda kept her barefoot  
Barefoot and pregnant all the time  
I used to be the first in line  
Now Ive fallen way behind  
Shes everybodys sweetheart  
Everybodys sweetheart but mine  
  
All that country club money  
Lord it sure looked good to me yeah it did  
Playin golf with those fat cats  
How much better could life be  
They all think Ive got it made  
They see your face on every page  
Of every magazine  
Across the USA  
  
Chorus  
  
If you see her tell her hi  
And everything will be all right  
Tell her that I love her  
Til the day I die  
  
Chorus  
  
Come on home
