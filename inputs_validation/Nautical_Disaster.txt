I had this dream where I relished the fray and the screaming filled my head
all day  
It was as though I had been spit here  
Settled in  
Into the pocket of a lighthouse on some rocky socket  
Off the coast of France dear  
One afternoon  
Four thousand men died in the water here and five hundred more were thrashing
madly as parasites might in your blood  
Now I was in a lifeboat designed for ten and ten only  
Anything that systematic would get you hated  
Its not a deal not a test nor a love of something fated  
Death  
The selection was quick  
The crew was picked and those left in the water were kicked off our pant leg
and we headed for home  
  
Then the dream ends when the phone rings  
Youre doing alright he said its out there most days and nights  
But only a fool would complain  
Anyway Susan if you like  
Our conversation is as faint as a sound in my memory  
As those fingernails scratching on my hull
