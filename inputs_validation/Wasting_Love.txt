Maybe one day Ill be an honest man  
Up till now Im doing the best I can  
Long roads long days of sunrise to sunset  
Sunrise to sunset  
  
Dream on brothers while you can  
Dream on sister I hope you find the one  
All of our lives covered up quickly  
By the tides of time  
  
Spend your days full of emptiness  
Spend your years full of loneliness  
Wasting love in a desperate caress  
Rolling shadows of night  
  
Dream on brothers while you can  
Dream on sisters I hope you find the one  
All of our lives covered up quickly  
By the tides of time  
  
Sands are flowing and the lines  
Are in your hand  
In your eyes I see the hunger and the  
Desperate cry that tears the night
