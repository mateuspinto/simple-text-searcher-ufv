A ring of haze encircles the unshrouded truth within  
Another seal is broken as the heavens prepare  
To break forth in fulfillment  
  
A blanket of deception is layered on sacred writings  
Which contain the thoughts of the One who is Almighty God  
  
A sword unsheathed is drawn bringing legions of demons to their knees  
By the covenant prepared before the earth itself still  
So many choose to warm themselves beneath deception  
  
A ring of haze encircles the unshrouded truth within  
Another seal is broken as the heavens prepare  
To break forth in fulfillment  
A blanket of deception is layered on sacred writings  
Which contain the thoughts of the One who is Almighty God  
A sword is drawn unsheathed bringing legions of demons to their knees  
By the knowledge of a covenant prepared before the earth itself  
Still so many choose to warm themselves beneath deception  
  
As the end draws near and history closes  
I pray that the winds and the rain of that which is latter  
Will bring clarity and understanding to Your infallible Word  
Let the lack of knowledge that destroys us be lifted in Your name
