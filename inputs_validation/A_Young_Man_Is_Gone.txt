Oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo  
Ah ah ah ah ahhhhh  
  
Now a young mans gone  
But his legend lingers on  
For so much had he to give  
  
But his life is through  
For the story told is true  
For he died just as he lived  
  
For this daring young star  
Met his death while in his car  
No one knows the reason why  
  
Screaming tire flashing fire  
And gone was this young star  
Oh how could they let him die  
  
Still a young man is gone  
Yet his legend lingers on  
For he died without a cause  
  
And they say that hell  
Be known for evermore  
As the Rebel Without A Cause
