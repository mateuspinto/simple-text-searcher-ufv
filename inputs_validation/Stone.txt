ronnie lane  
Once I was a stone many years ago  
Into a pool was thrown many years ago  
Time passed by the pool ran dry excavated was i  
And tempered and beat in a fiery heat  
By the hand of a man whos name was dan  
Dan the blacksmith  
Once I was a sword many years ago  
And my blade was broad many years ago  
Worn with pride into battle Id ride at a warriors side  
And I cut and I killed and was lost in a field  
And I soon did rust corrode to dust  
Oh my  
Once I was a daisy many years ago  
In pastures green and lazy many years ago  
But I was et by a goat who fell in a moat and forgetting to float  
He sunk like a lead and stayed until dead  
But was relieved to find just how kind it all was  
Once I was a grub many years ago  
I lived in muck and mud many years ago  
But on the very first noon I became a cocoon that resembled a prune  
When the good lord was done in the warmth of the sun  
I shed my skins and dried my wings and I flew away  
Once I was a bullfrog had to struggle for survival  
And once I was a carp and lived in waters ornamental  
And once I was a myna bird quoting verses from the bible  
Said pretty boy pretty boy st luke  
Once I was a mule a many years ago  
But my master treat me cruel a many years ago  
By and by I was sick couldnt move to his kick so he took out a stick  
And hit it right cross my back to an almighty crack  
And to his dismay I passed away into the blue  
I was born a human baby many years ago  
I was born unto a lady many years ago  
All our hopes they were piled on the back of a child that turned out to be
wild  
Sent the devil a prayer and caused the parson to swear  
So I took my leave to lie and thieve my way to jail  
Ive been tinker tailor soldier sailor  
Ive known good times and disaster  
But now Ive found a teacher and the teacher has a master  
The master is perfection so hell help us get there faster  
I dont need no proof because thats the truth and Ill drink to that
