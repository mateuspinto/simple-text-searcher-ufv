Faith can move mountains  
Darling you will see  
I can move mountains  
If you have faith in me  
  
Faith can work magic  
This I find with you  
Yours is the magic  
To make my wishes come true  
  
So tell me again you love me  
Kiss me and Ill be strong  
What couldnt I do when I know that you  
Are here to help me along  
  
Yes faith can move mountains  
Darling you will see  
I can move mountains  
If you have faith in me  
  
So tell me again you love me  
Kiss me and Ill be strong  
What couldnt I do when I know that you  
Are here to help me along  
  
Yes faith can move mountains  
Darling you will see  
I can move mountains  
If you have faith in me  
  
Yes I can move mountains  
If you have faith in me
