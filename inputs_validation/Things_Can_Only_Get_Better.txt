Were not scared to lose it all  
Security throw through the wall  
Future dreams we have to realize  
A thousand skeptic hands  
Wont keep us from the things we plan  
Unless were clinging to the things we prize  
  
And do you feel scared I do  
But I wont stop and falter  
And if we threw it all away  
Things can only get better  
Wow wow wow oh wow wow wow oh oh oh oh  
  
Treating today as though it was  
The last the final show  
Get to sixty and feel no regret  
It may take a little time  
A lonely path an uphill climb  
Success or failure will not alter it  
  
And do you feel  
Wow wow wow oh  
And do you feel
