When Im alone I keep replaying the look of love in your eyes  
When I miss home I swear I die every time we said goodbye  
Like a gentle wind you cross my mind  
I lose myself I lose all sense of time  
  
Feel your presence all around me  
On the same frequency  
Its all our love can be  
When we resonate resonate  
  
Even though were miles apart  
I reach for you and there you are  
You bow the strings that move my heart  
Resonate resonate  
  
You come to me youre in my dreams you are my satellite  
You make me feel sweet vibrations we shared endless nights  
Think of me Im never far away  
I hear your voice you call my name  
  
Feel your presence all around me  
On the same frequency  
Its all our love can be  
When we resonate resonate  
  
Even though were miles apart  
I reach for you and there you are  
You bow the strings that move my heart  
Resonate resonate  
  
Feel the distance send a message every night  
Finding each other we share the same desire  
Like a telegraph that leads me to your heart  
I reach out and love is where you are  
  
Feel your presence all around me  
Its all our love can be  
  
Feel your presence all around me  
On the same frequency  
Its all our love can be  
When we resonate resonate  
  
Even though were miles apart  
I reach for you and there you are  
You bow the strings that move my heart  
Resonate resonate
