Verse  
Take me to the place lord  
Where theres nothing else but me and you  
Longing for your presence  
I know that you are calling me to you  
  
Pre chorus  
Here I stand  
And long for your embrace  
Nothing else  
Could ever take your place  
  
Chorus  
Come holy spirit  
Fall in this place  
I need more and more of you  
Fill me again with the power of your spirit  
Lord Im crying out for  
More and more of you  
  
Bridge  
Lord Im crying out for  
More and more of you oh
