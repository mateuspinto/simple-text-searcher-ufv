Time will swallow  
Your precious time  
Like magic create the future  
What makes man so fickle  
Who put the daggers in those eyes  
Was it to learn  
Through dark days of struggle  
Was it to burn  
To burst all our bubbles  
Thunder and rain  
Well the cynical flame will it heat stick and blister  
Thunder and rain  
Evangelistic brother  
Should be banging a tambourine  
Go wash your hands and fingers  
Till your mind is clean  
Was it your fate  
To sleep like a normal  
Time and decay  
No man is immortal  
Thunder and rain  
Boredom and pain lit the cynical flame  
Will it heat stick and blister  
Thunder and rain  
Still try to resist the pessimist  
The pessimist no no  
And these things I find  
In the back of my mind  
Where time lasts forever  
I get all mixed  
Think Im all mankind  
Listen Mr Pessimister  
With your Catholic taste  
Oh listen Mr Pessimister Pessimister  
We do not relate  
Listen Mr Pessimister Pessimister Pessimister  
Mr Pessimister
