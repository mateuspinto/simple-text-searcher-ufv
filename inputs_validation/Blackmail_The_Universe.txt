This is breaking news  
It appears that Air Force One was shot down  
Somewhere over the Middle East this morning  
By a sleeper cell of rogue terrorists firing a Stinger Missile  
The Pilot and all passengers are unaccounted for  
The Presidents whereabouts are presently unknown  
And he is presumed missing  
  
The Vice President Secretary of State  
And principals of the military are assembling  
Our nation stands at Defcon 3  
The greatest crisis will someone come for me  
I red white and blew it  
Unleashed revenge my body is detained  
How could anybody do this  
  
Betrayal I peel away the days  
Medals are useless Uncle Sams forgotten me  
Im not important no one will ever come  
Ill never be found God get me out of this hell  
Nuclear battlefields energized  
Cold wars are heating up again  
The tensions mounting  
  
People lift up your fists in revenge  
The stage is set  
Who will be the first to blink  
We cant go to war  
Remember that Vietnam thing  
Peace at any price  
With a gun to your head bang bang  
  
Weakness runs in your family  
What runs in mine is death  
This is your 5 minute warning  
Burn all your classified documents  
And if cooler heads dont prevail  
First strike from a political dead man  
Appeasement only makes the aggressor more aggressive  
He understands only one language action  
And he respects only one word force  
No sign of them stopping  
No time for back channel communiques  
We need all the help we can get air strikes and invasions  
Retaliate I say  
  
The will of good men can not counter the terrible strain of war  
Blackmail the Universe with the greatest of calamities  
Awaken those sleeping giants in the dust of the ground  
With their skin destroyed unjust to innocence  
Lawful possessor of the worlds last 24 hours  
Terror and ugliness reveal what death really means  
And in hatred you see men as they really are  
If chosen over heaven Earth will have been for them  
All along only another region of hell
