If I should get a look of leavin in my eyes  
Put your arms round me woman and change my mind  
If I ever seem too restless or dissatisfied  
Put your arms round me woman and change my mind  
Dont let me separate your love from mine  
Dont let me leave you I might get the urge some time  
If I do youll know what to do to keep me by your side  
Put your arms round me baby and change my mind  
If the gay life of the barrooms beckons me at night  
Put your arms round me baby and change my mind  
And if a new love ever tempts me that I should search to find  
Put your arms round me woman and change my mind  
Put your arms round me woman and change my mind
