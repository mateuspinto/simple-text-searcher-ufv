Sisotowbell Lane  
Noah is fixing the pump in the rain  
He brings us no shame  
We always knew that he always knew  
Up over the hill  
Jovial neighbors come down when they will  
With stories to tell  
Sometimes they do  
Yes sometimes we do  
We have a rocking chair  
Each of us rocks his share  
Eating muffin buns and berries  
By the steamy kitchen window  
Sometimes we do  
Our tongues turn blue  
  
Sisotowbell Lane  
Anywhere else now would seem very strange  
The seasons are changing  
Everyday in everyway  
Sometimes it is spring  
Sometimes it is not anything  
A poet can sing  
Sometimes we try  
Yes we always try  
We have a rocking chair  
Somedays we rock and stare  
At the woodlands and the grasslands and the badlands cross the river  
Sometimes we do  
We like the view  
  
Sisotowbell Lane  
Go to the city youll come back again  
To wade through the grain  
You always do  
Yes we always do  
Come back to the stars  
Sweet well water and pickling jars  
Well lend you the car  
We always do  
Yes sometimes we do  
We have a rocking chair  
Someone is always there  
Rocking rhythms while theyre waiting with the candle in the window  
Sometimes we do  
We wait for you
