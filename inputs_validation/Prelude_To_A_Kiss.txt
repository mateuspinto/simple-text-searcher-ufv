If you hear  
A song in blue  
Like a flower crying  
For the dew  
That was my heart serenading you  
My prelude to a kiss  
  
If you hear a song that grows  
From my tender sentimental woes  
That was my heart trying to compose  
A prelude to a kiss  
  
Though its just a simple melody  
With nothing fancy  
Nothing much  
You could turn it to a symphony  
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch  
  
Oh how my love song gently cries  
For the tenderness within your eyes  
My love is a prelude that never dies  
A prelude to a kiss  
  
Though its just a simple melody  
With nothing fancy  
Nothing much  
You could turn it to a symphony  
A Shubert tune with a Gershwin touch  
  
Oh how my love song so gently cries  
For the tenderness within your eyes  
My love is a prelude that never dies  
A prelude to a kiss
