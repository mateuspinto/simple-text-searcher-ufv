Wild mountain thyme  to the mcpeake family of belfast  
Oh the summer time is coming  
And the trees are sweetly bloomin  
And the wild mountain thyme  
Grows around the bloomin heather  
Will ye go lassie go and well all go together  
To pluck wild mountain thyme  
All around the bloomin heather  
Will ye go lassie go  
I will build my love a bower by yon pure crystal fountain  
And on it I will pile all the flowers of the mountain  
I will range throug the wild and the deep glen sae dreary  
And return wi my spoils to the bower of my deary  
If my true love she were gone Id surely find another  
Where the wild mountain thyme grows around the bloomin heather  
Oh the summer time is comin and the trees are sweetly bloomin  
And the wild mountain thyme grows around the bloomin heather
