Welcome to a trip  
Into my hurt feelings  
To the center of my soul  
You better bring a light  
To find the house of meanings  
In the labyrinth of yeas or no  
For you life is just like chess  
If you dont make a move  
Youll lose the game like this  
  
Cause you youre walking on the edge  
You you chose the way of love and pain  
You dont you see the bridge  
Ive built for you its just one step to start again  
  
Welcome to a trip  
Into my emotions  
To the language of my heart  
Youre sailing on a river  
That becomes an ocean  
Which you can only cross with love  
For you life is just like chess  
If you dont make a move  
Youll lose the game like this  
  
Cause you youre walking on the edge  
You you chose the way of love and pain  
You dont you see the bridge  
Ive built for you its just one step to start again
