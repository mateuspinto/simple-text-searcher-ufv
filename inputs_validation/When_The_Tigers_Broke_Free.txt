It was just before dawn  
One miserable morning in black 44  
When the forward commander  
Was told to sit tight  
When he asked that his men be withdrawn  
And the generals gave thanks  
As the other ranks  
Held back the enemy tanks for a while  
And the Anzio bridgehead was held for the price  
Of a few hundred ordinary lives  
  
And kind old King George sent mother a note  
When he heard that father was gone  
It was I recall in the form of a scroll  
With gold leaf and all  
And I found it one day  
In a drawer of old photographs hidden away  
And my eyes still grow damp  
To remember  
His majesty signed  
With his own rubber stamp  
  
It was dark all around  
There was frost in the ground  
When the tigers broke free  
And no one survived from the Royal Fusiliers Company Z  
They were all left behind  
Most of them dead  
The rest of them dying  
And thats how the high command  
Took my daddy from me
