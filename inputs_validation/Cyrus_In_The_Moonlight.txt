Oh the hills are full of spirits  
And they walk when night comes round  
And they speak to who they choose to  
When the moon is shining down  
And ramona loves the orchard  
And liza loves the pine  
And cyrus in the moonlight  
Loves the flowing of the wine  
  
Oh cyrus trusts the spirits  
And they fill his life with grace  
Yeah the father of his fathers  
Passed him down the gift of faith  
And one night you might hear it  
Like a wailing from above  
Its just cyrus in the moonlight  
Singing to the one he loves  
  
And the two girls start to dancing  
When they hear that drunken voice  
Thats when cyrus asks the moonlight  
Do I have to make a choice  
tween liza with her red hair  
And ramona with her blues  
And with all these gifts they bring me  
Tell me how can I refuse  
  
Well the hills are full of spirits  
And they walk when night comes round  
And they speak to who they choose to  
When the moon is shining down  
And ramona loves the orchard  
And liza loves the pine  
And cyrus in the moonlight  
Loves the flowing of the wine  
And one night you might hear it  
Like a wailing from above  
Its just cyrus in the moonlight  
Singing to the one he loves
