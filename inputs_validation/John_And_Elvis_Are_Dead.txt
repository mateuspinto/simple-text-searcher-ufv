Close friend of mine as a child fell into a slumber  
No sign of life since 75  
Then one day he just what do you know  
I guess God just called his number  
  
He called me up he called me up and said  
Ive been awake about a week  
Im thinking about asking the doctor  
If he could put me back to sleep  
Then he laughed and said  
Hey all the girls they look the same  
Dont they know just what their mothers  
Paid in blood and tears to change  
  
But the words that made me cry  
The thing he softly said  
It stayed with me it keeps messing with my head  
He said If Jesus Christ is alive and well  
Then how come John and Elvis are dead  
  
Youth beautiful youth  
We walked through the walls until we found the truth  
And said Change it its ugly just change it  
Everyone we used to know  
Must have given up so long ago  
You can see it its written on their faces  
And the inside of their clothes  
  
But the words that made me cry  
Cause I knew just what they meant  
He turned to me and said  
Hey boy if Jesus Christ is alive and well  
Then how come John and Elvis are dead  
  
Tell me if Jesus Christ is alive and well  
Then how come Marvin and Elvis are dead  
  
I said If Jesus Christ is going to save us from ourselves  
How come peace love and Elvis are dead
