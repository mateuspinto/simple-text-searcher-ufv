Thermal count is rising in perpetual writhing  
The primordial ooze and the sanity they lose  
Awakened in the morning to more airpollution warnings  
Still we sleepwalk off to work as our nervous systems jerk  
Pretending not to notice how history has forbode us  
With the greenhouse in effect our environment was wrecked  
Now I can only laugh as I read our epitaph  
We end our lives as moles in the dark of the dawn patrol
