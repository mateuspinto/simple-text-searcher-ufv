Past midnight  
Breathing in the dark  
Same strange friend comes to visit  
Never intend to open the door  
  
You take it to places that no ones ever been  
You let it  
You let it  
Your insides caving in  
You pushed and pulled still wanting some more  
  
This time Ive gone all the way  
Without you  
Theres nothing more I can say  
  
So maybe I took a little too much  
Maybe life didnt want this part of me  
It it helps to know  
I never let you go  
Sure I lost my mind  
But I never really meant to die  
  
Last heartbeats fading in the night  
Only expected darkness  
Surprised to wake and follow the light  
  
The second you let it become a part of you  
Youll never forget it no matter what you do  
You lost it all still wanting some more  
  
This time Ive gone all the way  
Without you  
Theres nothing more I can say  
  
So maybe I took a little too much  
Maybe life didnt want this part of me  
It it helps to know  
I never let you go  
Im sorry that I lost my mind  
  
So baby I took a little too much  
Maybe you sucked the life right out of me  
I should have let you know  
I never meant to go  
Sure I lost my mind  
But I never really meant to die  
  
Never stay forever  
Never stay forever  
Come on  
  
Never stay forever  
Never stay forever  
Come on  
  
So maybe I took a little too much  
Maybe life didnt want this part of me  
If it helps to know  
I never let you go  
Im sorry that I lost my mind  
  
So baby I took a little too much  
Maybe you sucked the life right out of me  
I should have let you know  
I never meant to go  
Sure I lost my mind but I never really meant to die
