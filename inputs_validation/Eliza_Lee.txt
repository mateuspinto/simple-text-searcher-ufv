Oh the smartest packet you can find  
Ah he ah ho are you most done  
Is the fair Rosalind in the Blackwall line  
So the clear the track let the bulgine run  
To my aye rig a jig in the low back car  
Ah he ha ho are you most done  
With Eliza Lee all on my knee  
So clear the track let the bulgine run  
  
The fair Rosalind one bright summers day  
Ah he ah ho are you most done  
Went sailing away far out over the bay  
So the clear the track let the bulgine run  
To my aye rig a jig in the low back car  
Ah he ha ho are you most done  
With Eliza Lee all on my knee  
So clear the track let the bulgine run  
  
The tiller one hand firmly graspd  
Ah he ah ho are you most done  
And Elizas waist by the other was claspd  
So the clear the track let the bulgine run  
To my aye rig a jig in the low back car  
Ah he ha ho are you most done  
With Eliza Lee all on my knee  
So clear the track let the bulgine run  
  
Oh the day was fine the wind was free  
Ah he ah ho are you most done  
And Eliza Lee sat there on my knee  
So the clear the track let the bulgine run  
To my aye rig a jig in the low back car  
Ah he ha ho are you most done  
With Eliza Lee all on my knee  
So clear the track let the bulgine run  
  
Oh Eliza Lee all on my knee  
Ah he ah ho are you most done  
Was as pretty a sight as any could see  
So the clear the track let the bulgine run  
To my aye rig a jig in the low back car  
Ah he ha ho are you most done  
With Eliza Lee all on my knee  
So clear the track let the bulgine run  
  
Oh I said My dear will you be mine  
Ah he ah ho are you most done  
Her answer was sweeter than sweetest of wine  
So the clear the track let the bulgine run  
To my aye rig a jig in the low back car  
Ah he ha ho are you most done  
With Eliza Lee all on my knee  
So clear the track let the bulgine run  
  
Oh the smartest packet you can find  
Ah he ah ho are you most done  
Is the fair Rosalind in the Blackwall line  
So the clear the track let the bulgine run  
To my aye rig a jig in the low back car  
Ah he ha ho are you most done  
With Eliza Lee all on my knee  
So clear the track let the bulgine run
