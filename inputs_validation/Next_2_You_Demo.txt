It doesnt matter if I say youre right even when youre wrong  
Or paint you as a hero or the chicks in every song  
I roll my eyes to heaven I recognize your flaws  
But after all is said and done I just want you more  
  
Some people say I must be blind  
But Ill have you over them any time  
  
Oh I wanna get next 2 you  
Oh I wanna get next 2 you  
I wanna get next 2 you  
  
While searching for perfection I fell foul of your charms  
Ti caro mi amigo I want to leave I cant  
These shoes are getting heavy this cross is hard to bear  
At least a life of misery is something we can share  
  
Some people say I must be blind  
But Ill have you over them any time  
  
Oh I wanna get next 2 you  
Oh I wanna get next 2 you  
Oh I wanna get next 2 you yes I do  
Oh I wanna get next 2 you  
I wanna get next 2 you  
  
Some people say I must be blind  
But Ill have you over them any time  
  
Oh I wanna get next 2 you  
Oh I wanna get next 2 you  
Oh I wanna get next 2 you yes I do
