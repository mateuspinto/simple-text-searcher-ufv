Hey  
Give my heart a break  
You say its you that loves me more  
And then you kick and slam your door  
Hey  
While youre on your way  
I want to thank you for the ride  
And pull the thorn out of my side  
  
And call me your baby  
I kissed away the tears you cried  
And then you go and leave me  
Pissed off and alone  
Its all about your sweet thing  
Or maybe its the devil in your eyes  
Yeah whats it take to make this love survive  
  
Another last goodbye  
Another last goodbye  
  
You crash and burn  
With the pages turned  
In your black book full of names  
And then you throw your frozen heart  
Out in somebody elses flames  
And its a low down dirty dirty shame  
Dont let this love slip through the tracks  
I miss your claw marks on my back  
  
And call me your baby  
I kissed away the tears you cried  
And then you go and leave me  
Pissed off and alone  
Yeah its all about your sweet thing  
Or maybe its the devil in your eyes  
Yeah whats it take to make this love survive  
  
Another last goodbye  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
I believe Ive always been in love with you  
Though we got caught up in the sway  
Never know in where we left  
Been off the hook and out of hand  
Sometimes I feel that love is a crime  
Cause I remember yeah the very first time  
  
You call me your baby  
I kissed away the tears you cried  
And then you go and leave me  
Pissed off and alone  
Yeah its all about your sweet thing  
Or maybe its the devil in your eyes  
Yeah what it takes to make this love survive  
  
Another last goodbye  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Another last goodbye  
Another last goodbye  
Another last goodbye  
Another last goodbye  
Another last goodbye  
Another last goodbye  
Another last goodbye
