Riding with a head full of bodies are red  
And what I said is still stuck in my head  
But misled doing the things I do would make you never wanna come back  
But an all front attack you could never run from that  
Being trapped in this with you  
Somethin that I never wanted to do  
But through it all youve got to see that where I want to be  
Is over the pen again letting it out of me  
In the center of the day in the dream reading all my thoughts  
Getting lost in between realizing one that the way to the sea  
And the killing and again with a head full of screams  
  
I wanna live in another place  
Where no one can say that I live for them  
So I see its not meant to be for me  
I wanna be in the energy not with the enemy  
A place for my head  
  
And the second it starts were gonna be crushed when it all falls apart  
Going in the hollow hoping that you wont know  
The strain it puts to me seeing what youve done  
And consequently Ive run away just hidden again  
Within the boundaries of the nameless  
Dont want me to say this but youre dragging me down  
Lost in the chaos being tossed around  
  
Singing again to myself a head full of hectic  
Hope that some day youll regret this  
Everythings the wrong place the wrong time  
Adding to the panic in my confine  
  
Singing again to myself a head full of hectic  
Hope that some day youll regret this  
Everythings the wrong place the wrong time  
Adding to the panic in my confine  
  
I wanna live in another place  
Where no one can say that I live for them  
So I see its not meant to be for me  
I wanna be in the energy not with the enemy  
A place for my head  
  
You try to take the best of me  
Stay away  
You try to take the best of me  
Stay away  
You try to take the best of me  
Stay away  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away  
You try to take the best of me  
Go away  
  
I wanna live in another place  
Where no one can say that I live for them  
So I see its not meant to be for me  
I wanna be in the energy not with the enemy  
A place for my head  
  
Shut Up Now  
  
Singing again to myself a head full of hectic  
Hope that some day youll regret this  
Everythings the wrong place the wrong time  
Adding to the panic in my confine  
  
Singing again to myself a head full of hectic  
Hope that some day youll regret this  
Everythings the wrong place the wrong time  
Adding to the panic of my confine
