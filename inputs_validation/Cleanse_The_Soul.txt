Body that rests before me  
With every dying breath  
Spellbound and gagged  
I commence your flesh to dirt  
  
Body that lay before me  
In everlasting death  
Entombed in abscess  
To rot and lie stinking in the earth  
  
Empty altar awaits its victim  
Stained glass windows black  
Candles burn the midnight oil  
Incense fills the night  
  
Observing trance awaking state  
Lying still unknowing  
Reciting the passages of time  
Prepare for the impaling  
  
Deaths an art flesh and earth never part  
A power of the mind  
Death shines on the air of silence  
A ritual of endless time  
  
Purged of your dead body  
Sacrificed of your life  
Unearthly ritual sealed in fire  
Enter the kingdom of desire
