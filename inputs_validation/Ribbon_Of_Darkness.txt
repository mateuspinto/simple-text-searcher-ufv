Ribbon of darkness over me  
Since my true love walked out the door  
Tears I never had before  
Ribbon of darkness over me  
  
Clouds aatherin oer my head  
That kill the day and hide the sun  
That shroud the night when day is done  
Ribbon of darkness over me  
  
Rain is falling on the meadow  
Where once my love and I did lie  
Now she is gone from the meadow  
My love goodbye  
  
Ribbon of darkness over me  
Where once the world was young as spring  
Where flowers did bloom and birds did sing  
Ribbon of darkness over me  
  
Here in this cold room lyin  
Dont want to see no one but you  
Lord I wish I could be dyin  
To forget you  
  
Oh how I wish your heart could see  
How mine just aches and breaks all day  
Come on home and take away  
This ribbon of darkness over me
