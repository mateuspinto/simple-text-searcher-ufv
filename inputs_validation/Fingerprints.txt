I feel the fingerprints  
That you left on my heart  
You played a game of love  
And then you said we had to part  
You left me all alone  
And as the teardrops start  
I feel the fingerprints  
Of sorrow on my heart  
  
I know you didnt mean to be unkind  
And hurt me so  
And youve made up your mind  
But I just thought you ought to know  
  
That when the day is through  
I think of only you  
I sit alone and dream  
And think of things we didnt do  
Now I am all alone  
And as the teardrops start  
I feel the fingerprints  
That you left on my heart  
  
And when the day is through  
I think of only you  
I sit alone and dream  
And think of things we didnt do  
Now I am all alone  
And as the teardrops start  
I feel the fingerprints  
That you left on my heart
