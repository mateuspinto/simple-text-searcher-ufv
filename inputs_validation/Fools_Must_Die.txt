Fools must die  
So it shall be  
Take your place in history  
Show your face  
Dont be shy  
The world rejoices  
When fools die  
  
They die they must die  
They die they must die  
Everybody gather round  
Watch them falling to  
The ground  
  
Fools must die  
So it shall pass  
Bow your head  
Raise your glass  
Dont ask when  
Dont ask why  
Ask for mercy  
Cause fools die  
  
They die they must die  
They die they must die  
Everybody gather round  
Watch them stumble to  
The ground  
  
Fools must die  
One by one  
Indulge yourself  
As I have done  
As you are now  
So once was I  
Prepare for death  
Cause fools must die  
  
They die they must die  
They die they must die  
Everybody gather round  
Watch them falling to the ground
