I could go back to every laugh  
But I dont wanna go there anymore  
And I know all the steps up to your door  
But I dont wanna go there anymore  
  
Talk to the wind  
Talk to the sky  
Talk to the man with the reasons why  
And let me know what you find  
  
Ill leave my window open  
Cause Im too tired tonight  
To call your name  
Just know Im right here hoping  
That youll come in with the rain  
  
I could stand up and sing you a song  
But I dont wanna have to go that far  
And I Ive got you down  
I know you by heart  
And you dont even know where I start  
  
Talk to yourself  
Talk to the tears  
Talk to the man who put you here  
And dont wait for the sky to clear  
  
Ill leave my window open  
Cause Im too tired tonight  
To call your name  
Just know Im right here hoping  
That youll come in with the rain  
  
Ive watched you so long  
Screamed your name  
I dont know what else I can say  
  
But Ill leave my window open  
Cause Im too tired tonight  
For all these games  
Just know Im right here hoping  
That youll come in with the rain  
  
I could go back to every laugh  
But I dont wanna go there anymore
