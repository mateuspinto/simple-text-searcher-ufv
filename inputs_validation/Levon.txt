Levon wears his war wound like a crown  
He calls his child Jesuscause he likes the name  
And he sends him in the finest school in town  
  
Levon Levon likes his money  
He makes a lot they say  
Spends his days counting  
In a garage by the motorway  
  
He was born a pauper  
To a pawn on a Christmas Day  
When the New York Times  
Say God is dead and wars begun  
Alvin Tostig Has a son today  
  
And he shall be Levon  
And he shall be a good man  
And he shall be Levon  
In tradition with the family plan  
And he shall be Levon  
And he shall be a good man  
He shall be Levon  
  
Levon sells cartoon balloons in town  
His family business thrives  
Jesus blows up balloons all day  
Sits on the porch swing watching them fly  
And Jesus he wants to go to Venus  
Leave Levon far behind  
Take a balloon and go sailing  
While Levon Levon slowly dies  
  
And he shall be Levon  
And he shall be a good man  
He shall be Levon
