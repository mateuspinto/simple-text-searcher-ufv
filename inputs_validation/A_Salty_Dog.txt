All hands on deck weve run a float  
I heard the Captain cry  
Explore the ship replace the cook  
Let no one leave alive  
Across the straits around the horn  
How far can sailors fly  
A twisted path our tortured course  
And no one left alive  
  
We sailed for parts unknown to man  
Where ships come home to die  
No lofty peak nor fortress bold  
Could match our captains eye  
Upon the seventh seasick day  
We made our port of call  
A sand so white and sea so blue  
No mortal place at all  
  
We fired the guns and burned the mast  
And rowed from ship to shore  
The captain cried we sailors wept  
Our tears were tears of joy  
Now many moons and many Junes  
Have passed since we made land  
A Salty Dog the seamans log  
Your witness my own hand
