And I want to wake up in your  
White white sun  
And I want to wake up in your world  
With no pain  
But Ill just suffer in a hope to die someday  
While you are numb all of the way  
When I hate its  
I know I can feel here  
But when you love you know its not real  
No  
When I hate its  
I know I can feel here  
But when you love you know its not real  
Now I am resigned  
Wicked fuckin worlds  
On its way to Hell  
Livin are dead and  
I hope to join them too  
I know what to do And I do it well  
When I hate its  
I know I can feel here  
But when you love you know its not real  
No  
When I hate its  
I know I can feel here  
But when you love you know its not real  
Shootin myself to love you  
If I loved myself Id been shootin you  
Haa haa haa haa  
Oh yeah  
Shootin myself to love you  
If I loved myself Id been shootin you  
Haa haa haa haa

Shootin myself to love you  
If I loved myself Id been shootin you  
Haa haa haa haa

Shootin myself to love you  
If I loved myself Id been shootin you  
Haa haa haa haa

Shootin myself to love you
