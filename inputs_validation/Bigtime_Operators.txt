Well they told me to come on over  
I made my way to New York  
And they tried to have me deported  
Stop me from getting work  
Blacklisted me all over  
They were vicious and they were mean  
They were big time operators  
Baby on the music business scene  
  
Oh they looked like politicians  
But underneath they were thugs  
And they spread malicious rumors  
Threatened to have me busted for drugs  
They had nothing on me  
Oh man I was really clean  
But they were big time operators  
On the music business scene  
  
They put a bug in my apartment  
To listen in on my calls  
I was looking for some motivation  
I couldnt find any any motivation at all  
They were very desperate people  
Riding in long black limousines  
But they were big time operators  
On the music business scene  
  
They were glorified by the media  
They were heroes who had names  
They said that they would bury me  
If I didnt play their game  
They said I didnt know the score  
And that I was young and green  
They were big game operators  
On the music business scene  
  
Tried to hold me to a phony contract  
I said I didnt agree  
Had to get out of the clutches  
Had to go underground you see  
Now Im living in another country  
But I know exactly just where Ive been  
Stay away from big time operators  
Baby on the music business scene  
  
Well baby big time operators  
On the music business scene  
Oh baby big time operators  
On the music business scene  
Well full of names and places  
Baby you know who I mean
