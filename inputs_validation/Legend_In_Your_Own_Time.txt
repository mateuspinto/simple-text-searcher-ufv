Well I have known you  
Since you were a small boy  
And your mama used to say  
My boy is gonna grow up and be  
Some kind of leader some day  
  
Then youd turn on the radio  
And sing with the singer in the band  
Your mama would say to you  
This isnt exactly what we had planned  
  
But youre a legend in your own time  
A hero in the footlights  
Playing tunes to fit your rhyme  
But a legends only a lonely boy  
When he goes home alone  
  
And though I know you  
Still have the heart of that small boy  
Well you lend it out far too much  
And no one woman loving you  
Can ever feel that shes been really touched  
  
Then you turn on the radio  
And sing with the singer in the band  
Think kind of sadly to yourself  
This isnt exactly what you had planned  
  
But youre a legend in your own time  
A hero in the footlights  
Playing tunes to fit your rhyme  
But a legends only a lonely boy  
When he goes home alone  
  
Well a legends only a lonely boy  
When he goes home alone
