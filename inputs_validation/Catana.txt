Catana what goddess gave you the name  
That has this heart of mine so a flame  
Tell me Catana what heaven gave you your eyes  
What elfin fiddler plays for your sighs  
Fashioned of Venus that is your form and your face  
Two clinging vines for arms hold me in tender embrace  
While the mood poses from lips made of roses  
Each word opposes all else but love  
Catana like a Madonna you Ill adore forevermore  
While the mood poses from lips made of roses  
Each word opposes all else but love  
Catana like a Madonna you Ill adore forevermore
