Out on the plains down near Santa Fe  
I met a cowboy ridin the range one day  
And as he jogged along I heard him singin  
The most peculiar cowboy song  
It was a ditty he learned in the city  
Comma ti yi yi yeah  
Comma ti yippity yi yeah  
  
Now get along get hip little doggies  
Get along better be on your way  
Get along get hip little doggies  
He trucked em on down that old fairway  
Singin his Cow Cow Boogie in the strangest way  
Comma ti yi yi yeah  
Comma ti yippity yi yeah  
  
Chorus x2  
Now singin his cowboy songs  
Hes just too much  
Hes got a knocked out western accent with a dixie  
Touch  
He was raised on local ways  
Hes what you call a swingin half breed  
Singin his Cow Cow Booogie in the strangest way  
Comma ti yi yi yeah  
Comma ti yippity yi yeah
