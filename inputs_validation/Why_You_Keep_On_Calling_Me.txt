Why you keep on callin me  
When you know well never be  
Cause you got someone on the side  
  
Instrumental  
  
I said hey girl  
Did you hear me

Dont try to play me for a fool  
I could never be your fool gonna find someone who really wants me  
  
Why you keep on callin me girl

When you know well never be  
Cause you got someone on the side  
Keep thinking that were gonna be  
So you keep on callin me  
But you got someone on the side

Cause you got someone on the side  
Keep thinking that were gonna be

That you came from above
