When the road is rocky and youre carrying a load  
Wait for the light to shine  
If you find youre friendless on that weary lonesome road  
Wait for the light to shine  
  
Wait for the light to shine  
Wait for the light to shine  
Pull yourself together and keep looking for the sign  
Wait for the light to shine  
  
Dont forget your brother as you travel through this land  
Wait for the light to shine  
He may be in trouble and may need a helping hand  
Wait for the light to shine  
  
Wait for the light to shine  
Wait for the light to shine  
Never give up hope or cast your pearls and pour this wine  
Wait for the light to shine  
  
Dont let trouble fool you and your sin will all be gone  
Wait for the light to shine  
Dont forget its darkness just before the break of dawn  
Wait for the light to shine  
  
Wait for the light to shine  
Wait for the light to shine  
Keep these words on your mind as you walk out narrow line  
Wait for the light to shine
