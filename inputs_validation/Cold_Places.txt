Chorus  
To all my people goin through it on a daily basis  
And it seem like the world is full of cold places  
Keep yo head up fuck what they said cause  
you can do it and the man will get you through it  
I believe that homey I believe that  
If I can picture that Ill bring a picture back  
  
Ice Cube  
They say Gangster gangster Tell me how you do it  
How you get through it and them other niggas blew it  
I keep my eye on the prize then pursue it  
Chase it like a cheetah chuck it out and subdue it  
So selfeducate nigga dont hate  
Cause the game I got is Madden oheight  
Fuck with Cube Im better than YouTube  
Fuck with them dudes them niggas is new school  
The game dont change just the players  
The rhymes dont change just the fuckin rhymesayers  
They make it up as they go along  
But Im goin on 25 years strong  
The shit I say might get you through the day  
Or change your whole life in a major way  
The shit they say might catch you a case  
The shit I say feel like your birthday  
  
Chorus  
  
Ice Cube  
You know what Momma said itd be days like this  
Straight hell on earth but come up out the abyss  
She said Dont let em see you crawl dont let em see you fall  
All they wanna do is laugh when you tear your drawers  
Its a cold world nigga bring a bomber jacket  
If its another hustle out there Ima crack it  
Fuck the new dance Ima learn how to eat  
Get my mind right stay up out these fuckin streets  
They keep callin me  
They keep callin all the lil homies keep fallin  
In them same traps niggas cant figure out  
In the fast lane boy but the bridge is out  
Make my blood boil get yo life spoiled  
Get you in the system get you in the soil  
And your funeral was sponsored by Unocal  
Saw you UVN nigga digital  
  
Chorus  
  
I know its fucked up how they do us  
Pretend they really care but then they Jerry Lewis  
Take that money that was allocated to us  
Put us in some fucked up trailers then sue us  
Watchin Katrina is worser than Ike and Tina  
See New Orleans get bitchslapped by FEMA  
Louisiana got racistass politics  
Free the Jena Six Nigga free the Jena six  
Your honor Osama Obama  
Even yo momma aint fuckin with my comments  
They want us to quit forget  
And not give a shit about these sickass politics  
A lunatic is in the White House  
Make me wanna go do a lick right now  
But theyll make a nigga bow down  
in the penitentiary a billion dollar industry  
  
Chorus  
  
I believe that homey I believe that  
If I can picture that Ill bring a picture back
