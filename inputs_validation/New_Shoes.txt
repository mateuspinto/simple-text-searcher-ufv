From the baby in the womb to the burden in the room  
From the body in the tomb to the man on the moon  
From the bottom of the hill to the top of the hill  
From the hole in your head when you cant sit still  
  
All wrapped up in a cotton bud  
Watch the sun go down and watch it come back up  
Take another sip from the broken cup  
Drippin little tap keeps me woken up  
Oh oh  
  
New shoes old blues  
Walking round the streets of London town singing  
Up on the roof  
If I lose you lose  
You and I could spend our time just lying dreaming  
Of Hollywood  
With these new shoes  
  
From the people in the front to the people in the back  
To the people in the back can you hear the stack  
From the down and the out to the uptown girl  
From the daisy chain to the string of pearls  
  
All wrapped up in a cotton bud  
Watch the sun go down and watch it come back up  
Oh oh  
  
New shoes old blues  
Walking round the streets of London town singing  
Up on the roof  
If I lose you lose  
You and I could spend our time just lying dreaming  
Of Hollywood  
With these new shoes
