May I whisper in your ear  
From my heart so youll clearly hear  
There are people so dear  
Theyre like children  
Naked in a cold world  
Beautiful children  
In an old world  
  
May I take you away  
From the evils of today  
To the dreams of tomorrow  
You know that heaven  
Has no sorrow  
You know that heaven  
Has no tomorrow  
  
Hear the sound of the magic drums  
Hearts are beating for the sun  
Sending evil on the run  
Now watch the wind  
  
Look over yonder  
Here comes some news  
Coming down like lightning  
Straight for me and you  
People of destruction  
Your time is out of date  
People whos living crooked  
Better start getting straight  
  
Ive been through some changes  
A whole lot of rearranges  
Been through some ups and downs  
And whole lot of turn arounds  
I been on the shelf and even killed myself  
1 000 times ago and maybe 1 000  
Times more  
  
She said she comes from ice land  
I told her I was from the west  
She took me to the snow capped mountains  
And then she put me through the test  
We walked across the glacier  
The horses stayed behind  
And as we laid between the  
Frozen vallies we kissed  
For the very first time  
And now were stuck together  
  
It was too long ago  
But it seems like Years ago  
Since I felt the warm hello of the sun  
Lately things seem a little colder  
The wind it seems to get a little bolder  
  
Forget of my name  
Remember it only as a hand shake  
Introduction to my belief which is god  
Ride instead the waves of my interpreture  
Music sound  
Hynotic if you choose  
But truth and life  
Regardless of your questionable timid compromises  
Which I intend to erase  
Which I will erase without hint of reward  
As I am only a messenger  
And you a sheep in process of evolution  
Almost at death with yourself  
And on the staircase of birth  
Soon you may almost forget the smell of your family
