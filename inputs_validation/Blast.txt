Aww shit  
  
Chorus  
Kid Rock back in this motherfucking house  
Feel the effects of my shotgun blast  
Mothers crying from these shotgun blasts  
Feel the effects of my shotgun blast  
People dying from these shotgun blasts  
  
Cause Im rippin flippin crippin like a real one does  
So if your raps wrapped in jack sweep it under the rug  
Cause Ima go above that beyond the calls of my fuckin duty  
Cause all these corney phony emcees now a days dont move me  
So Im a show it proof G so make waves  
I got a full time pay start to dig graves  
Because Im buryin emcees and sharin their ladies  
Now you rolled hoes are carrying my babies  
Grab me it never hurt no one  
A broken home always hurts someone  
Grab me it never hurt no one  
I saw kids get shot dont sell guns  
  
And still I rip it flip it grip it like a real one does  
Rockin shockin on the stage with a hell a steady buzz  
From a 5th of ol Jimmy Beam  
We fryin emcees up just like some motherfucking Jimmy Dean  
Sausage pattys and smoking cabbies like its no thing  
Drinkin more Colts then the 45 king  
Swingin emcees like a cow hands rope  
And if the guns too loud oh boy Im straight slittin throats  
  
Cause thats the way I like to do shit holmes  
Every time I get my gamble on  
Yeah thats the way I like to do shit holmes  
I never stay in one spot i was born to roam  
Feel like I got bank but its not enough friend  
Cause I want more bank see than my grandkids could ever spend  
So if ya need some cheap slut then speak up  
Most hoes know not to ask for cash cause Im a cheap fuck  
  
Chorus
