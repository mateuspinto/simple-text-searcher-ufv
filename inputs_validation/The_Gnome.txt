I want to tell you a story  
About a little man  
If I can  
A gnome named Grimble Crumble  
And little gnomes stay in their homes  
Eating sleeping drinking their wine  
  
He wore a scarlet tunic  
A blue green hood  
It looked quite good  
He had a big adventure  
Amidst the grass  
Fresh air at last  
Wining dining biding his time  
And then one day hooray  
Another way for gnomes to say  
Oooooooooomray  
  
Look at the sky look at the river  
Isnt it good  
Look at the sky look at the river  
Isnt it good  
Winding finding places to go  
And then one day hooray  
Another way for gnomes to say  
Oooooooooomray  
Ooooooooooooooomray
