My mothers love was always inexplicably linked to kickball  
And my brother was an expert from the start  
But I lacked finesse so when put to the test  
I couldnt kick my way right into her heart  
  
Oh yeah  
He tried playing rugby and soccer and football  
He tried kick the can and even martial arts  
But even with fist dedication Ive still got no coordination  
He couldnt kick his way right into her heart  
Oh yeah
