Would it stain  
If the lights fell down on your name  
And each face began to look all the same  
How much is enough  
Did you ever want to just lose touch with everybody you know  
In the morning  
When youve wiped his taste away  
The last of the red and all the records you played  
How much is enough  
Did you ever want to just lose touch with everybody who heard  
Did you ever want to join a collective  
Or throw a party just to make sure you missed it  
Did you ever want to be a collective  
Would you sell out  
To the dealer with the lowest cost  
And you burn every proscenium floor  
How much is enough  
Did you ever want to get in touch with somebody youve hurt  
Offered up some kind of collective  
Where you can never ever be left selected  
Did you ever want to be a collective  
If the lights then fell  
Do you think you could tell  
How much  
If the lights then fell  
Do you think you could tell  
Just how much
