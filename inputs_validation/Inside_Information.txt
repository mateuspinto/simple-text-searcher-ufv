One man to the left  
One man to the right  
One man in the middle  
One man dressed in white  
  
One man in the east  
One man from the west  
One man in the middle  
One man under house arrest  
Step back  
  
Get hooked on the power  
Gotta stay in the game  
be the man of the hour  
Gotta make a name for yourself  
  
And the lady waits so patiently  
She waits for the call  
She knows just what you need  
  
You need inside information  
Information at a very high price  
She gives you inside information  
That can change your whole life overnight  
In a minute  
  
One man to the left  
One man to the right  
One man in the middle  
Caught in the broad daylight  
  
Just a man on the street  
Another face in the crowd  
One man on the beat  
Wants everything that hes not allowed  
  
And the lady waits so patiently  
She waits for the call  
She knows just what you need  
  
You need inside information  
She can get it at a very high price  
A little inside information  
It can change your whole life overnight  
  
With a little inside information  
You get money you get power you get it all  
Yeah but that inside information  
Can leave you waiting for that hammer to fall  
Let it fall  
  
She gets that inside information  
Information at a very high price  
With that inside information  
Its danger with each roll of the dice  
  
You want that inside information  
Take the money take the power take it all  
Take that inside information  
But get ready cause the hammer will fall  
Its gonna fall  
  
Inside information
