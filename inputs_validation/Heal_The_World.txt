Theres a place in your heart  
And I know that it is love  
And this place could be much  
Brighter than tomorrow  
And if you really try  
Youll find theres no need to cry  
In this place youll feel  
Theres no hurt or sorrow  
  
There are ways to get there  
If you care enough for the living  
Make a little space  
Make a better place  
  
Heal the world  
Make it a better place  
For you and for me  
And the entire human race  
There are people dying  
If you care enough for the living  
Make it a better place  
For you and for me  
  
If you want to know why  
Theres love that cannot lie  
Love is strong  
It only cares of joyful giving  
If we try we shall see  
In this bliss we cannot feel  
Fear of dread  
We stop existing and start living  
  
The it feels that always  
Loves enough for us growing  
So make a better world  
Make a better place  
  
Heal the world  
Make it a better place  
For you and for me  
And the entire human race  
There are people dying  
If you care enough for the living  
Make a better place for you and for me  
  
And the dream we were conceived in  
Will reveal a joyful face  
And the world we once believed in  
Will shine again in grace  
Then why do we keep strangling life  
Wound this earth crucify its soul  
Though its plain to see  
This world is heavenly  
Be gods glow  
  
We could fly so high  
Let our spirits never die  
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers  
Create a world with no fear  
Together we cry happy tears  
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares  
  
We could really get there  
If you cared enough for the living  
Make a little space  
To make a better place  
  
Heal the world  
Make it a better place  
For you and for me  
And the entire human race  
There are people dying  
If you care enough for the living  
Make a better place for you and for me  
Heal the world  
Make it a better place  
For you and for me  
And the entire human race  
There are people dying  
If you care enough for the living  
Make a better place for you and for me  
  
Heal the world  
Make it a better place  
For you and for me  
And the entire human race  
There are people dying  
If you care enough for the living  
Make a better place for you and for me  
  
There are people dying  
If you care enough for the living
