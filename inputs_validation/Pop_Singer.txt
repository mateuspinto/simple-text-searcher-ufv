Never wanted to be no pop singer  
Never wanted to write no pop songs  
Never had no weird hair to get my songs over  
Never wanted to hang out after the show  
Pop singer writing of pop songs  
  
Never wanted to have my picture taken  
Now who would want to look into these eyes  
Just want to make it real  good bad or indifferent  
Thats the way that I live and thats the way that Ill die  
As a pop singer of pop songs  
  
Pop singer writing of pop song  
  
Never wanted to be no pop singer  
Never want to write no pop songs  
Never wanted to have a manager over for dinner  
Never wanted to hang out after the show  
  
Pop singer writing pop songs  
Never wanted to be no pop singer of pop songs  
A pop singer  
Never wanted to write no pop songs
