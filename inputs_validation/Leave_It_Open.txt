With my ego in my gut  
My babbling mouth would wash it up  
But now Ive started learning how  
I keep it shut  
  
My door was never locked  
Until one day a trigger come cocking  
But now Ive started learning how  
I keep it shut  
  
Wide eyes would clean and dust  
Things that decay things that rust  
But now Ive started learning how  
I keep em shut  
I keep em shut  
  
Harm is in us  
Harm is in us but power to arm  
Harm is in us  
Harm in us but power to arm  
Harm is in us  
Leave it open  
Harm is in us but power to arm  
  
Narrow mind would persecute it  
Die a little to get to it  
But now Ive started learning how  
I leave it open  
  
I kept it in a cage  
Watched it weeping but I made it stay  
But now Ive started learning how  
I leave it open  
I leave it open  
  
Harm is in us  
Harm in us but power to arm  
Harm is in us  
Harm in us but power to arm  
  
Harm is in us  
Leave it open  
Harm in us but power to arm  
Harm is in us  
Harm in us but power to arm  
Harm is in us  
Leave it open  
Harm in us but power to arm  
Harm is in us

Harm in you and in me  
  
What you letting in  
Tell me what youre letting in  
Say what were gonna let in  
  
We let the weirdness in  
We let the weirdness in  
We let the weirdness in  
We let the weirdness in  
We let the weirdness in
