I got on a city bus and found a vacant seat  
I thought I saw my future bride walking up the street  
I shouted to the driver hey conductor you must slow down  
I think I see her please let me off this bus  
  
Nadine honey is that you  
Oh Nadine Honey is that you  
Seems like every time I see you Darling you got something else to do  
  
I saw her from the corner when she turned and doubled back  
And started walkin toward a coffee colored cadillac  
I was pushin through the crowd to get to where shes at  
And I was campaign shouting like a southern diplomat  
  
Downtown searching for her looking all around  
Saw her getting in a yellow cab heading up town  
I caught a loaded taxi paid up everybodys tab  
With a twenty dollar bill told him catch that yellow cab  
  
She move around like a wave of summer breeze  
Go driver go go catch her balmy breeze  
Moving through the traffic like a mounted cavalier  
Leaning out the taxi window trying to make her hear
