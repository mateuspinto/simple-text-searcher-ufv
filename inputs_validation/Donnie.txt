Donnies got a secret and you know it  
He was yours in the summertime yeah  
About ten years ago  
He promised you to stay forever  
Live with you  
Its so bittersweet now  
When you know what you lost  
  
Donnie was the boy you always wanted by your side  
Donnie was the boy your girlfriends fell for one by one  
Donnie was the boy you always wanted day and night  
But Donnie had a girlfriend tender sexy sweet and  
Blond  
  
Hes always on your mind  
The season changes  
Years went by  
But that chapter of love stays unfinished for you  
  
Keep on dancing through your new life  
Maybe make a move  
Make him see you again  
As the flower you are  
  
Donnie was the boy you always wanted by your side  
Donnie was the boy your girlfriends fell for one by one  
Donnie was the boy you always wanted day and night  
But Donnie had a girlfriend tender sexy sweet and  
Blond  
  
In the summer time yeah  
In the summer time life was easy  
On the beach you had him long ago  
  
In the summer time yeah  
In the summer time life was easy  
On the beach you had him long ago  
  
Donnie was the boy you always wanted by your side
