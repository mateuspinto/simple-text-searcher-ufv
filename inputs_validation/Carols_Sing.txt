Carols sing to the King  
Jesus Christ our Saviour  
Born this day angels say  
In a lowly manger  
He came down to the earth  
Bringing us new birth  
Carols sing to the King  
Jesus Christ our Saviour  
  
Tidings bring Hail the King  
Shepherds did adore Him  
From afar by the star  
Wise men sought and found Him  
Son of God Son of Man  
All in all I see  
Carols raise His name praise  
He shall reign eternally  
Carols sing to the King  
Jesus Christ our Saviour
