You take a mortal man  
And put him in control  
Watch him become a god  
Watch peoples heads aroll  
Aroll a roll  
  
Just like the Pied Piper  
Led rats through the streets  
We dance like marionettes  
Swaying to the symphony  
Of destruction  
  
Acting like a robot  
Its metal brain corrodes  
You try to take its pulse  
Before the head explodes  
Explodes explodes  
  
Just like the Pied Piper  
Led rats through the streets  
We dance like marionettes  
Swaying to the symphony  
  
Just like the Pied Piper  
Led rats through the streets  
We dance like marionettes  
Swaying to the symphony  
Swaying to the symphony  
Of destruction  
  
The earth starts to rumble  
World powers fall  
Awarring for the heavens  
A peaceful man stands tall  
Tall tall  
  
Just like the Pied Piper  
Led rats through the streets  
We dance like marionettes  
Swaying to the symphony  
  
Just like the Pied Piper  
Led rats through the streets  
We dance like marionettes  
Swaying to the symphony  
Swaying to the symphony  
Of destruction
