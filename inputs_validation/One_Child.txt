A seed it grows and somehow becomes a life  
It moves she knows that her Baby has arrived  
Shes so scared but shes so blessed  
She lays down her fear for the hope at her breast for she knows  
  
One million chains could never hold back this moment in time  
One thousand dreams could never dream what this moment truly means  
Heaven and earth they cradle the Infinite Joy born on this night  
For it only takes one Child to forever change the world  
  
He stands beside her hed share her pain if he only knew how  
He whispers I love you as he gently strokes her brow  
Hes so scared but hes so blessed  
Theres a thundering pride pounding deep in his chest  
For he knows  
  
One million chains could never hold back this moment in time  
One thousand dreams could never dream what this moment truly means  
Heaven and earth they cradle the Infinite Joy born on this night  
For it only takes one Child to forever change the world  
  
Christ is born we are blessed  
Every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess  
That we know  
  
One million chains could never hold back this moment in time  
One thousand dreams could never dream what this moment truly means  
Heaven and earth they cradle the Infinite Joy born on this night  
For it only takes one Child whoa  
This is the one Child  
  
This Baby cries and for the first time  
The world hears the voice of God weep  
Mary sings a lullaby  
As the Hope of the nations gently falls asleep  
She knows this is the one Child  
To forever change the world  
This is my Jesus
