A grief came riding  
On the wind  
Up the Solemn river Thames  
I was sittin on the bank with my mouth open  
When I felt it entering  
  
I began thinkin about our wedding day  
And how love was a vow  
I was thinkin about the chamber door  
Only we can enter now  
  
I began thinkin about our ancient friends  
And of kissin them goodbye  
And then the wind blew under Battersea bridge  
And a tear broke from my eye  
  
I started thinkin about London  
How nothing good ever came from this town  
And if the Thames werent so filthy  
I would jump in the river and drown  
  
Dont be afraid  
Come on down  
Im just sittin here  
Thinking loud  
  
A grief came riding on the wind  
Up the river where the bridges crouch  
Blowin people back and forth  
From the marital bed to the psychiatric couch  
  
Blowin people far apart  
Blowin others so they collide  
Blowin some poor bastard right out of the water  
Blowin another one over the side  
  
Hear the ancient iron bridge  
And listen to it groan  
With the weight of a thousand people  
Leavin or returning home  
  
To their failures  
To their bordoms  
To their husbands  
And their wives  
Who are carving them up for dinner  
Before they even arrive  
  
Dont be afraid  
Come on down  
Im just sittin here  
Thinking loud  
  
Now look there just Below the water  
See the saviour of the human race  
with the fishes and the frogs  
Has found his final resting place  
  
Dont be afraid  
Come on down  
Im just sittin here  
Thinking loud
