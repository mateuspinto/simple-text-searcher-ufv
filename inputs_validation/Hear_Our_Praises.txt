May our homes be filled with dancing  
May our streets be filled with joy  
May injustice bow to Jesus  
As the people turn to pray  
  
From the mountains to the valleys  
Hear our praises rise to You  
From the heavens to the nations  
Hear our singing fill the air  
  
May Your light shine in the darkness  
As we walk before the cross  
May Your glory fill the whole earth  
As the water oer seas  
  
From the mountains to the valleys  
Hear our praises rise to You  
From the heavens to the nations  
Hear our singing fill the air  
  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Hallelujah hallelujah  
Hallelujah hallelujah  
Hallelujah hallelujah x3  
  
From the mountains to the valleys  
Hear our praises rise to You  
From the heavens to the nations  
Hear our singing fill the air
