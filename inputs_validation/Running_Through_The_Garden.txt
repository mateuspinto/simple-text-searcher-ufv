Until she herself  
Became the deadliest poison  
As she grew older  
Ooh until she herself  
Became just as fatal  
As was her garden  
  
And so you run toward  
What you know is wrong  
There are too many flowers  
To cut down  
With all the love I have for your life  
For the love I have for your life  
Turn around  
  
Never did I mean to never did I mean to  
Imprison you imprison you  
Here in my garden here in my garden  
Like I am imprisoned like I am imprisoned  
All the love I have for your life  
All the love I have for your life  
Turn around turn around  
  
Until she herself  
Understood her garden  
Leaving her heart broken  
No future at all  
Until she herself  
Became the toxic garden  
Always frightened  
No future at all  
  
And so you run towards  
What you know is wrong  
There are too many flowers  
To cut down  
With all the love I have for your life  
With all the love I have for your life  
Turn around  
  
Never did I mean to never did I mean to  
Imprison you imprison you  
Here in my garden here in my garden  
Like I am imprisoned like I am imprisoned  
All the love I have for your life  
All the love I have for your life  
Turn around turn around  
  
So you run towards  
What you know is wrong  
But there are too many flowers  
To cut down  
With all the love I have for your life  
With all the love I have for your life  
Turn around  
  
Running through the garden  
Im running in brilliant colors  
Im running straight toward straight toward  
What you know is really wrong  
Too many flowers here to cut down  
For the love I have for your life  
Turn around  
  
For the love I have for the love I have  
For the love I have for the love I have  
Turn around
