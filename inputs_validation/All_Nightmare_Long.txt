One two  
  
Luck runs out  
  
Crawl from the wreckage one more time  
Horrific memory twists the mind  
Dark rutted rugged cold and hard to turn  
Path of destruction feel it burn  
  
Still life  
Incarnation  
Still life  
Infamy  
  
Hallucination  
Heresy  
Still you run  
Whats to come  
Whats to be  
  
Cause well hunt you down without mercy  
Hunt you down all nightmare long  
Feel us breathe upon your face  
Feel our shift every move we trace  
  
Hunt you down without mercy  
Hunt you down all nightmare long yeah  
Luck runs  
And you crawl out again  
But your luck runs out  
  
One two  
  
Luck runs out  
  
The light that is not light is here  
To flush you out with your own fear  
You hide you hide  
But will be found  
Release your grip without a sound  
  
Still life  
Immolation  
Still life  
Infamy  
  
Hallucination  
Heresy  
Still you run  
Whats to come  
Whats to be  
  
Cause well hunt you down without mercy  
Hunt you down all nightmare long  
Feel us breathe upon your face  
Feel our shift every move we trace  
  
Hunt you down without mercy  
Hunt you down all nightmare long yeah  
Luck runs  
And you crawl out again  
But your luck runs out  
  
Then you crawl back in  
Into your obsession  
Never to return  
This is your confession  
  
Hunt you down without mercy  
Hunt you down all nightmare long  
Feel us breathe upon your face  
Feel our shift every move we trace  
  
Hunt you down without mercy  
Hunt you down all nightmare long yeah  
Luck runs  
And you crawl out again  
But your luck runs out
