In search of a good life the Pilgrims set sail  
Then all through the new land they blazed their brave trails  
The iron horse speeding down freshlylaid rails  
Brought settlers determined to prosper  
  
From the far corners they made it their home  
The ities and germans the paddies the poles  
Goin down in the dirt comin up with the gold  
Like Bill Fuller the Kennedys and Corleones  
  
Life is so good in the us of A  
Live out you dreams in Amerikay  
If youve gut the guts and the bucks it is said  
Every man is a king in the us of A  
Every man is a king in Amerikay  
  
The pilgrims these days they are called astronauts  
They seek new battlefields on the moon and beyond  
To wage their star wars in the sky byandby  
And to shit on us all from on high  
  
Then when its all over and the world is no more  
When the White House and Kremlin have settled their score  
The stars and stripes flag will fly high proud out there in space  
And thats why we all love the United States  
  
In the land of Republican automatons  
Uncle Sams forces so gungho and bronzed  
Just waiting their orders from Washington  
To fight for your peace and your freedom  
  
Vietnam Nicaragua El Salvador  
How foolish of you not to open your doors  
To the Hersheys Budweisers Mcdonalds and more  
This wonderful life could be yours
