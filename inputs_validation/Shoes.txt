Everything you told me I believed  
You said that I was all that youd ever need  
That I made life worth livin for you  
And no one else could ever fill my shoes  
  
Chorus  
But them shoes dont fit me anymore  
They lost their shape when I lost all that I cared for  
And someone else will fill the shoes that I once wore  
Cause them shoes dont fit me anymore  
When a shoe is new it fits awful tight  
When our love was new everything was right  
When a shoe is old you throw it away  
Our love is like the shoes that you wore yesterday  
  
Repeat chorus
