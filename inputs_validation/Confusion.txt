Wake to face the day  
Grab this life and walk away  
War is never done  
Rub the patch and battle on  
Make it go away  
Please make it go away  
  
Confusion  
All sanity is now beyond me  
Delusion  
All sanity is but a memory  
My life the war that never ends  
  
Leave the battlefield  
Yet its horrors never heal  
Coming home from war  
Pieces dont fit anymore  
Make it go away  
Please make it go away  
  
Confusion  
All sanity is now beyond me  
Delusion  
All sanity is but a memory  
My life the war that never ends  
  
Father please come home  
Shell shocked all Ive known  
Father please come home  
  
Label him a deadwood soldier now  
Cast away and left to roam  
Rapid is the road to sacrifice  
Just takes longer to come home  
Come home  
  
Confusion  
All sanity is now beyond me  
Delusion  
Crossfire ricochets inside me  
Trapped in a memory forever  
My life the war that never ends
