Mama please let me go to the show  
I dig those bad boys playing that rock and roll  
No way son you cant go out tonight  
So I got real upset put up the biggest fight  
  
Chorus  
Mama let me go to the show  
I dig those bad boys playing that rock and roll  
Mama let me go out tonight  
Mama please before I lose my mind  
  
Out the window  
Shimmy down the tree  
I take a look around  
make sure no ones watching me  
I steal the keys and take  
my old mans Chevrolet  
I can hear my Mama scream  
from ten miles away  
  
Chorus  
  
Rock and roll rodeo  
Rock and roll rodeo  
  
Chorus
