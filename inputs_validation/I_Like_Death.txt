Cheese is good  
It makes me smile  
But then I watch it fade away  
And I cry  
And I want to die  
Because I like cheese  
But its not there anymore  
And I realize  
That I like death  
But not as much as cheese  
  
Chorus I like death but not as much as cheese  
I like death but cheese puts me at ease  
I like death but cheese is better  
Oh oh oh oh yeah cheese cheese cheese  
  
I saw you yesterday  
Im so misunderstood  
You dont believe that I like cheese  
As much as I say I do  
You think I like death better  
But your wrong  
Satan told me so  
Satan likes cheese  
We like cheese together  
Me and satan  
Eating cheese  
Feeding each other cheese in the moonlight  
  
Chorus X2  
  
Im not the kind of person you think I am  
Im a very cheesey old man  
I like death but cheese is better  
Oh yeah yeah yeah  
Cheese is the antichrist  
But not as much as me  
Or satan  
Because hes more antichrist than me  
And we like cheese  
  
chorus repeats over and over again and slowly fades intil song ends
