Built from blind faith  
Passed down from selfinduced fantasy  
Turn a page to justify  
Conjuring power  it opens wide  
On seventh day  
is that how its done  
Twisting your eyes to perceive  
all that you want  
To assume from ignorance  
Inflicting wounds with your  
crossturned dagger  
  
Chorus  
Inside crystal mountain  
Evil takes its form  
Inside crystal mountain  
Commandments are reborn  
  
All the traps are set to confine  
All who get in the way of the divine  
In sight and in mind of the hypocrite  
A slave to the curse forever confined  
  
Shatter the myth  
Dont cut yourself  
On your words against  
dreams made of steel  
Stronger any faith  
That inflicts pain and fear  
is that how its done  
Twisting your eyes to perceive  
all that you want  
To assume from ignorance  
Inflicting wounds with your  
crossturned dagger  
  
Chorus
