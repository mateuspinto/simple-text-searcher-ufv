Theres a rose on the bed  
A letter that I wrote what you mean to me  
Words I wished Id said  
Were still in my head now I pray youd see  
  
I dont know how to tell you that I miss you baby  
I struggle with the words sometimes  
But in my heart I know youll find  
  
Chorus  
I know you know  
Our souls will be together till the end of time  
You know I know  
Your love is gonna meet me on the other side  
As sure as the angels come down and take my breath away  
I love youd be the last thing Id ever say  
  
Id ever say  
  
You walked beside me  
You stood by me and got me through my darkest times  
And now I close my eyes  
And visuallize your face for the last time  
  
I didnt know how to tell you that I loved you baby  
I struggle with the words sometimes  
But in my heart I know youll find  
  
Chorus  
I know you know  
Our souls will be together till the end of time  
You know I know  
Your love is gonna meet me on the other side  
As sure as the angels come down and take my breath away  
I love youd be the last thing Id ever say  
  
I never fell in love  
No one ever touched me like this before  
You opened my eyes  
Made me realize something worth living for  
  
Solo guitar and piano  
  
But if fate took you from me before I got to let you know  
Youre the one thing in my life worth dying for  
If the world fell apart  
I know in my heart  
I know would never change  
If the devil himself  
Tried to raise hells bells  
I know it would be in vain  
If the heavens come down  
Let em fall to the ground  
Let em take my breath away  
I love youd be the last thing Id ever say
