Come Thou Fount of every blessing  
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace  
Streams of mercy never ceasing  
Call for songs of loudest praise  
Teach me ever to adore Thee  
May I still Thine goodness prove  
While the hope of endless glory  
Fills my heart with joy and love  
Oh to Grace how great a debtor  
Daily Im constrained to be  
Let Thy goodness like a fetter  
Bind my wandering heart to Thee  
Never let me wander from Thee  
Never leave Thee God I love  
Heres my heart take and seal it  
Seal it for Thy courts above  
Never let me wander from Thee  
Never leave Thee God I love  
Heres my heart take and seal it  
Seal it for Thy courts above
