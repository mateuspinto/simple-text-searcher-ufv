Turn around look at what you see  
in her face the mirror of your dreams  
Make believe Im everywhere hidden in the lines  
written on the pages is the answer to a neverending story neverending story  
  
Reach the stars fly a fantasy  
dream a dream and what you see will be  
Lives that keep their secrets will unfold behind the clouds  
and there upon the rainbow is the answer to a neverending story  
neverending story

Go Show no fear for she may fade away  
In your hand the birth of the new day  
Lives that keep their secrets will unfold behind the clouds  
and there upon the rainbow is the answer to a neverending story  
Neverending story
