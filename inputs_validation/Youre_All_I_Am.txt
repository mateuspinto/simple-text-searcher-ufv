I never knew a man could be so lonely  
That life would treat a man so wrong  
But when the odds were all against me  
You gave me the strength to carry on  
  
You gave me a new start so I will give you my heart  
  
You you are my life youre all I am  
Only you can understand the way I am  
  
You never give me enough of your love  
I need more and more each day  
Honey cant you see the only thing I can be sure of  
Is that something real has come my way  
  
Oh so I believe my heart though sometimes it tears me apart  
  
You you are my life youre all I am  
Baby its you you are my life youre all I am  
Only you can understand the way I am  
  
You know I live my life for you  
  
You are my life youre all I am  
Ooh baby its true you are my life youre all I am  
Only you can understand the way I am
