Verse 1  
Hey girl  
Do you want my number  
That way you can call me  
Everytime I come into town  
And then I will drive up to your house  
And take you out to dinner  
I dont expect nothing at all  
  
Chorus  
But what if we happen to kiss then we touch  
Put a rush on it get it over with  
What if I just know what you like  
And it feels right then its over with  
What if I dont call you back  
Prove you right  
And all this lasts just one night  
Maybe we should slow it down slow slow slow  
  
Verse 2 Drake  
Hey girl

Mini golf or ice cream  
Im not picky youll let me know  
  
Chorus  
But what if we happen to kiss then we touch

And it feels right then its over with  
What if I dont call you back  
Prove you right  
And all this lasts just one night  
Maybe we should slow it down slow slow slow  
  
Chorus
