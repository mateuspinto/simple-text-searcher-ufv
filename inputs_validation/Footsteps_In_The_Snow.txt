Verse 1  
Years ago we met by chance  
Thinking  we D start the greatest love of all  
Both of us were in a trance  
Together we have been so strong  
Through the years I felt a change  
Suspecting We could not keep our love alive  
Soon it all  
Became so strange  
  
Chorus  
You Re gone  
But where I don T know  
Footsteps you left in the snow  
Now I M alone  
But where should I go  
I feel like I miss you so  
  
Verse 2  
I shy away from love these days  
  
Because I need to be alone for now  
We have to go different ways  
Then I may understand my faults  
I M sure that it will take some time  
Until I open up my heart again  
It S so dark  
The sun won T shine  
  
Chorus  
You Re gone  
But where I don T know  
Footsteps you left in the snow  
Now I M alone  
But where should I go  
I feel like I miss you so  
I D like to set off  
And follow your track  
But I know you would never come back  
All that remains  
At the end of the show  
Are footsteps you left in the snow
