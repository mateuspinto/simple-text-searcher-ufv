He bought twofifths of lead free gasoline  
Said the bottle is dusty but my engine is clean  
He bought a nice blue suit with the money he could find  
If his bride didnt like it St Peter wouldnt mind  
  
Now I lie here so outofbreath  
And overopiated  
Maybe I couldnt catch up no but  
Maybe he could have waited  
  
Well the medicine man started seeing red  
You think the snake just dreams up the poison in his head  
Addicted to approval addicted to the air  
It was see if you like it or see you up there
