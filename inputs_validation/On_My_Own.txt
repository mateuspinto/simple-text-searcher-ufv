See all those people on the ground  
Wasting time  
I try to hold it all inside  
But just for tonight  
The top of the world  
Sitting here wishing  
The things Ive become  
That something is missing  
Maybe I  
But what do I know  
  
And now it seems that I have found  
Nothing at all  
I want to hear your voice out loud  
Slow it down slow it down  
Without it all  
Im choking on nothing  
Its clear in my head  
And Im screaming for something  
Knowing nothing is better than knowing at all  
  
On my own  
On my own  
On my own  
On my own  
On my own  
On my own  
  
Without it all  
Im choking on nothing  
Its clear in my head  
And Im screaming for something  
Knowing nothing is better than knowing at all  
  
On my own  
On my own  
On my own  
On my own
