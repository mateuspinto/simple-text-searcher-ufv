Faces change  
But this placell stay the same  
And Ill know  
When Ill go  
  
Yeah  
And Im pickin up another bag  
And I pack another knapsack  
The airports like a stop light to me  
Sittin on red green light go  
Cant see my family  
My family grew into a global trance  
Or fans some may call em  
And its on the stage I stand  
To jam Roxy no wakin up to stop the dream  
I lived the life signed a picture  
Cause no dam could stop the stream  
Or flood gates Im in the fuck trades  
And a pocket fulla culture condoms  
They put you on the podium for first place  
But on the block they judge you on em  
So  
Who got the South in a six pack and a shotgun just for show  
Ill put the white boys back in gold teeth  
Put the hood in mossy oak  
Im the  
Child of a deadbeat so I gotta give the beat some life  
Beat me down with criticism but at least the critics write  
With a broken pen there they go again  
Im a token man Im a rollin jam  
Like a rollin stone Im closin in  
Im goin home Im home again  
Bring it back up in the UK  
With a Dixie flag and a sixteen pack  
Catfish Billy hell you say  
Im just bein blunt homie  
Keep the grass  
  
You changed me  
Into what I am now  
You made me  
It was something I was always gonna be  
It seems these broken dreams dont lie  
And so now my broken wings will fly  
  
Yeah take one look  
Better yet take two  
But if I take that break theres a move you made  
This dude you shape will come take you back  
Back to the roots Ive been  
Without a fuckin pot to pee in  
Or a spot to sleep in  
Hot or cold outside its not the season  
Cause I am not the reason  
That the image youre used to seein  
Is usually being fake so to me the hate is meaningless  
Meaning yes Im different  
Differently made  
And me screamin the A  
Is not the difference in grades  
Its the place I stayed  
Cause the schools were underpaid  
The teachers taught but to me they fought  
A star that was underway  
It was under Wayne it was in my name  
Michael  
MWA  
Atha  
And in trouble I stayed  
Breakin out of this bubble they made  
Played with the dice but I rolled that seven  
And Ill go back to heaven in a Chevrolet  
Fuck the world with a tattooed hand  
Committed to the words I say  
A blood lines not a family tree  
Its a needle in my skin for all to see  
I aint never got a spring break tattoo drunk  
But I drink and take the ink  
  
You changed me  
Into what I am now  
You made me  
It was something I was always gonna be  
It seems these broken dreams dont lie  
And so now my broken wings will fly
