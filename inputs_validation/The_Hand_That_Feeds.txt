Youre keeping in step  
In the line  
Got your chin held high and you feel just fine  
Because you do  
What youre told  
But inside your heart it is black and its hollow and its cold  
  
Just how deep do you believe  
Will you bite the hand that feeds  
Will you chew until it bleeds  
Can you get up off your knees  
Are you brave enough to see  
Do you want to change it  
  
What if this whole crusades  
A charade  
And behind it all theres a price to be paid  
For the blood  
On which we dine  
Justified in the name of the holy and the divine  
  
Just how deep do you believe  
Will you bite the hand that feeds  
Will you chew until it bleeds  
Can you get up off your knees  
Are you brave enough to see  
Do you want to change it  
  
So naive  
To keep holding on to what I want to believe  
I can see  
But I keep holding on and on and on and on  
  
Will you bite the hand that feeds you  
Will you stay down on your knees
