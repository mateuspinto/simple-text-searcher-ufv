Streetlife serenader  
Never sang on stages  
Needs no orchestration  
Melody comes easy  
Midnight masquerader  
Shoppin center heroes  
Child of Eisenhower  
New world celebrator  
Streetlife serenaders  
Have such understanding  
How the words are spoken  
How to make the motions  
Streetlife serenaders  
Have no obligations  
Hold no grand illusions  
Need no stimulation  
Midnight masqueraders  
Workin hard for wages  
Need no vast arrangements  
To do their harmonizing
