Theres a long line of mourners driving down our little street  
Their fancy cars are such a sight to see  
Theyre all of your rich friends who you knew in the city  
And now they finally brought you home to me  
When you left you told me someday youd be returnin  
In a fancy car for all the town to see  
Now everyone is watching you finally got your dream  
Youre riding in a long black limousine  
The papers told of how you lost your life the party and the fatal crash that
night  
The race upon the highway the curve you didnt see  
And now youre in that long black limousine  
Through tear dimmed eyes I watch as you ride by  
A chauffeur at the wheel dressed up so fine  
Ill never love another my heart and all my dreams  
Are with you in that long black limousine
