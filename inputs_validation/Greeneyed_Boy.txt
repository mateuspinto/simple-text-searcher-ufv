Dolly Parton  
I flew off to the wild blue yonder  
Cause I had a dream  
And I had to go  
But Im filled with a sense of wonder  
From the love I shared  
With a greeneyed boy  
Lips as sweet as mountain honey  
A body warm as home made wine  
But he had no dreams  
And no means for money  
But he had me just anytime  
Take me back If just in memory  
Fill my cup again with joy  
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney  
And I still burn for that greeneyed boy  
Now he was pretty  
With chiseled features  
Like the movie stars in the magazines  
My first love and the son of a preacher  
I fantasized me was James Dean  
But the world outside kept pulling at me  
Offered me fame respect and gold  
Designer clothes and a fancy mansion  
Expensive cars so I chose those  
Take me back If just in memory  
Fill my cup again with joy  
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney  
And I still burn for that greeneyed boy  
Take me back If just in memory  
Fill my cup again with joy  
The fire still burns in the old rock chimney  
And I still burn for that greeneyed boy  
Ooh ooh how I love that greeneyed boy  
Ooh ooh ooh and I still miss  
That greeneyed boy  
Do you think about me  
When the nights are long and cold  
Do you ever miss me  
Do you my greeneyed boy
