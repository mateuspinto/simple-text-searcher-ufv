You came to the world  
For love of one like me  
And though I am the worst  
Of sinners grace is all I see  
  
Freedom from those chains  
My brokenness redeemed  
Love and mercy flowing  
Down to life eternally  
  
How could I repay such a debt  
Except with my life  
How could I give anything  
But sacrifice sacrifice of praise  
  
To the King eternal immortal  
Be all the glory forever amen  
To the King eternal immortal  
Be all the glory forever amen  
  
In plenty and in want  
Your strength is all I need  
And deep within these shadow lies  
Your glory never leaves  
  
How could I repay such a debt  
Except with my life  
And how could I give anything  
But sacrifice sacrifice of praise  
  
To the King eternal immortal  
Be all the glory forever amen  
To the King eternal immortal  
Be all the glory forever amen  
  
My praise will go on and on and on  
My praise will go on and on and on  
My praise will go on and on and on  
My praise will go on  
  
Oh my praise will go on and on and on  
My praise will go on and on and on  
My praise will go on and on and on  
And on and on and on and on and on  
And on and on and on and on  
  
To the King eternal immortal  
Be all the glory forever amen  
To the King eternal immortal  
Be all the glory forever amen  
  
To the King eternal immortal  
Be all the glory forever amen  
To the King eternal immortal  
Be all the glory forever amen  
  
I give in all of me  
This is my offering
