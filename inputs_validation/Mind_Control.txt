Unknown are the caverns of the mind  
New realms of affliction lurk inside  
Unbound massive mental energy  
Your last breaths taken from you easily  
  
Incoherence disrupts your rationale  
Involuntary your last confessional  
No sense of being missing segments of time  
Inconsistency is feeding on your mind  
  
Mind control pain unfolds  
I own all your sensations  
Weakening reasoning  
Mesmeric full demolition  
Hypnotized victimized  
Behold the threshold to the web  
Scream souls fear echoes  
Piercing boundaries of death  
  
Penetration of the window to your soul  
Deterioration of the mind no selfcontrol  
Temporary comprehend no memories  
Hollow carcass of a man is all I leave  
  
Execution but a thought in the end  
Slowly erasing your life and what has been  
Passing victims in the land of secrecy  
Cerebral death can come to you in your dreams
