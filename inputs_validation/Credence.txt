Deserted again  
You speak to me through the shadows  
Walking in closed rooms using cold words  
Captured by the night  
The yearning escapes from my embrace  
Strange silhouettes whisper your thoughts scream your sadness  
And they all turned away unable to face more of this death  
Credence in my word  
Written in dust tainted by memories  
I confess my hope recognize my loneliness  
Your laughter weeps the truth  
Push me into corners  
Confirming the epitaph of my soul  
And displaying the once unknown karma
