Now everyday I see you in some other face  
They crack a smile talk a while  
Try to take your place  
My memories serve me far too well  
Its not like at all  
We just broke up  
Its not like at all  
It was yesterday  
But something I just cant explain  
Something  
And no one ever saw your face again  
Just say good bye to the stupid mistakes we made  
My memories serve me far too well  
The years will come and go  
Some of them will change our lives  
Some of us still have nothing to show  
nothing baby  
But memories  
And I just wish to see your face again  
Wont you keep waiting for that day  
I know I know I know  
You hear these words that I say  
You cant always get what you want  
You cant always get what you want
