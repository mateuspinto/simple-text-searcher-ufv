Beautiful child  
Beautiful child  
You are a beautiful child  
And I am a fool once more  
  
You fell in love when I was only ten  
The years disappeared  
Much has gone by since then  
I bite my lip can you send me away  
You touch  
I have no choice  
I have to stay  
Ooh I had to stay  
Ooh I had to stay  
  
Sleepless child  
There is so little time  
Your eyes say yes  
But you dont say yes  
I wish that you were mine  
I wish that you were mine  
  
You say it will be harder in the morning  
I wait for you to say just go  
Your hands held mine so few hours  
I fell into love  
And Im not a child anymore  
  
Im not a child anymore  
Im tall enough  
To reach for the stars  
Im old enough  
To love you from afar  
Too trusting Yes  
But then women usually are  
  
Im not a child anymore  
No Im not a child oh no  
Tall enough to reach for the stars  
I will do  
As Im told  
Even if I never hold you again  
I never hold you again  
  
Sleepless child  
There is so little time  
Your eyes say yes but you dont say yes  
I wish that you were mine x4
