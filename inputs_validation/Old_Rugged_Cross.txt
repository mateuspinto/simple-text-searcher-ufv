On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross the emblem of suffering and shame  
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best  
For a world of lost sinners was slain  
So Ill cherish the old rugged cross till my trophies at last I lay down  
I will cling to the old rugged cross and exchange it some day for a crown  
 piano   
Oh that old rugged cross so despised by the world is a wonderous attraction
for me  
For the dear lamb of God left this glory above to bare it to dark calvary  
So Ill cherish the old rugged cross
