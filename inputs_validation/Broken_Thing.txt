I tried to walk quickly past the waters edge  
Didnt wanna see my own reflection  
But I just stepped off the highest ledge  
And fell into the sea of imperfection  
  
And just like every other time before  
I washed up in pieces on the shore  
  
But you found beauty in this broken thing  
Made angels dance with wounded wings  
I cant imagine anything more beautiful  
  
You took the damaged part of me  
Restored what little dignity was left inside  
This broken thing  
  
Yeah I was wading in deep despair  
Wandering with no sense of direction  
Thinking prayers just vanished in the air  
Cause I got myself in this situation  
  
And just like every other time before  
You made the pieces into so much more  
  
You found beauty in this broken thing  
Made angels dance with wounded wings  
I cant imagine anything more beautiful  
  
You took the damaged part of me  
Restored what little dignity was left inside  
This broken thing  
  
I know Im not worthy of this  
Never ending perfect love  
  
You found beauty in this broken thing  
And I cant imagine anything more beautiful  
  
You found beauty in this broken thing  
Made angels dance with wounded wings  
I cant imagine anything more beautiful  
  
You took the damaged part of me  
Restored what little dignity was left inside  
Was left inside this broken thing  
  
I know Im not worthy of this  
Never ending perfect love  
  
I cant imagine anything more beautiful  
You found beauty in this broken thing  
This broken thing  
  
I know Im not worthy of this love
