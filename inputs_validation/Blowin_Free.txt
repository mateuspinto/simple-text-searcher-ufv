I thought I had a girl  
I know because I seen her  
Her hair was golden brown  
Blowin free like a cornfield  
  
She was far away  
I found it hard to reach her  
She told me you can try  
But its impossible to find her  
  
In my dreams everything was all right  
In your schemes you can only try  
  
I thought I had a girl  
I know because I seen her  
Her hair was golden brown Yea  
Blowin free like a cornfield
