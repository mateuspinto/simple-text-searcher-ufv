Well it was Sunday bloody Sunday  
When they shot the people there  
The cries of thirteen martyrs  
Filled the Free Derry air  
Is there any one amongst you  
Dare to blame it on the kids  
Not a soldier boy was bleeding  
When they nailed the coffin lids  
  
Chorus  
Sunday bloody Sunday  
Bloody Sundays the day  
  
You claim to be majority  
Well you know that its a lie  
Youre really a minority  
On this sweet emerald isle  
When Stormont bans our marches  
Theyve got a lot to learn  
Internment is no answer  
Its those mothers turn to burn  
  
Chorus x2  
  
You anglo pigs and scotties  
Sent to colonize the North  
You wave your bloody Union Jack  
And you know what its worth  
How dare you hold to ransom  
A people proud and free  
Keep Ireland for the Irish  
Put the English back to sea  
  
Chorus  
  
Well its always bloody Sunday  
In the concentration camps  
Keep Falls Road free forever  
From the bloody English hands  
Repatriate to Britain  
All of you who call it home  
Leave Ireland to the Irish  
Not for London or for Rome  
  
Chorus x4
