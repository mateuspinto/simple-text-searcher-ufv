Look I know we been friends for a while now  
But I just feel I can confess to you  
Its gon be hard but alright here it goes  
  
Imagine that the pillow that you cried on was my chest  
And the tissue that you wiped your face with was my hand  
Girl imagine if you needed advice about some other guy  
Im the one that comes to mind  
Not tryna hear you tell nobody that Im just a friend  
Just tryna make sure Im that body that you call your man  
And anytime you need a shoulder its yours night or day  
Well what Im tryna say is  
  
Chorus  
I wanna be the last number you call late at night  
Said I wanna be the first one that you dial when you open your eyes  
Wanna be the one you run to wanna be the one that aint gon hurt you  
I wanna be yeah  
Wanna be yeah  
  
Be the man makin your girls jealous Girl I wanna be  
Be the guy shuttin down all the fellas ooh  
Whatever you need girl its all on me  
Your soldier your friend or your lover ooh

Would it be cool would you mind if I called you my boo my boo  
What if the next whip you was pushin was the one I bought for you  
Can I be the one that meets your Pops and take your mama shoppin  
Be the only one that I wait have you thought about it wait Really

Maybe you should take some time call your girls and talk about it yeah  
Cause I done already made up my mind my mind
