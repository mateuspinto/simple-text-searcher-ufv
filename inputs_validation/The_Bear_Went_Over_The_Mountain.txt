The bear went over the mountain  
The bear went over the mountain  
The bear went over the mountain  
To see what he could see  
  
To see what he could see  
To see what he could see  
  
The other side of the mountain  
The other side of the mountain  
The other side of the mountain  
Was all that he could see  
  
Was all that he could see  
Was all that he could see  
The other side of the mountain  
Was all that he could see
