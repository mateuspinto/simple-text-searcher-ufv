With your love I was complete  
Like a haven safe from harm  
Till the bitter stole the sweet  
I was perfect in your arms  
A precious while I had your smile  
Till it all fell apart with one change of heart  
  
The pain and regret will fade but a fact of love will still remain  
You cant always trust happiness  
Love like a sweet parade till the saddest part when the music fades  
You cant always trust happiness  
  
If a single star I see  
Ever made a wish come true  
It would bring you back to me  
But the best my heart can do  
Is to love again I dont know when  
Still its worth all I fear the heartaches and the tears  
  
Love like a lesson learned when we pass the point of no return  
You cant always trust happiness  
There in loves steady glow hides the power to hurt us so  
You cant always trust happiness
