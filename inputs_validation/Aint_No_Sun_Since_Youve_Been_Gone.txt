Into my life you bought a glowin love  
Like a ray of sunshine from up above ha  
One day out of the clear blue sky  
You darkened my world with the words goodbye  
Thats the day you left me for a stranger yeah baby baby  
When you left my life youve gone an you changed ahbaby Im a tellin you
it Aint no sun since you been goneOoo ooo  
  
theres a big black cloud hanging over my head  
Its a cloud of lonliness and I feel like Im dead Ha  
Aint no flowers bloomin down at the shore  
Since you chose to love me no more  
I guess you know you took my sunshine away from me baby ya did  
Girl ya took the light from my world crushed my dreams and I dont mean maybe
yeah  
  
An imma tellin you there  
Aint no sun since you been gone gone gone gone gone  
  
My future my future was as bright as the sun yes it was  
I aint got no future now that your gone  
Ooooo oooo  
  
Ahh I guess you know you took my sunshine away from me baby took away my
sunshine  
Girl you took the light from my world took away my sunshine  
Crushed my dreams and I dont mean maybe  
  
Aww baby it seems like night in the middle of the day  
Everything around me is faded and grey  
Cold are the days Dark creeps the night  
Never bringing you back into my life  
And there aint no sun since you been gone gone gone gone gone  
  
Aint no sun since you been gone  
Its just a dark lonely world without you girl
