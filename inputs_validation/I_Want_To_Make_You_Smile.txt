I want to make you smile  
When I run too fast slow me down  
When I run to far turn me around  
Sometimes life becomes an endless waste  
Sometimes love cant stand the lonely pace  
Each day goes by much too fast  
Tomorrow soon becomes the past  
Lost in struggle Im making my way  
Not taking time enough to simply say  
I love you forgive me  
I know its been a while  
I love you I wanna stop the world  
And make you smile  
Too many days I forgot to take your time  
To say I love you and thank you for being mine  
Those simple words I sometimes forget to say  
Well be on my lips at the wake of each new day  
I love you   
But you know I love you  
I wanna stop the world and make you smile  
If its not too late to make you smile
