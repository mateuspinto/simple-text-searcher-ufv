Lonely teardrops my pillow never dries  
Lonely teardrops come home come home  
Just say you will just say you will say you will  
My heart is cryin cryin  
  
Lonely teardrops my pillow never dries  
Lonely teardrops come home come home  
Just say you will just say you will yeah baby

Just give me another chance for a romance  
Come on and tell me when do you return  
Cause everyday that you been gone away  
You know my heart does nothin but burn cry  
  
Lonely teardrops my pillow never dries  
Lonely teardrops come home come home  
Just say you will say you will say you will  
Come on come on say it right now baby

Come on say it right now baby  
Say that you will come on come on

Come on come on say that you will  
Come on come on come on say that you will
