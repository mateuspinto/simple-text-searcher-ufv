I was hoping wed make real progress   
But it seems we have lost the power  
Any tiny step of advancement  
Is like a raindrop falling into the ocean   
Were running on the spot  always have  always will  
Were just the next generation of the emotionally crippled  
Though we keep piling up the building blocks  
The structure never seems to get any higher  
Because we keep kicking out the foundations  
And stand useless while our lives fall down  
I believe in life  and I believe in love  
But the world in which I live in  keeps trying to prove me wrong  
  
Out in the pastures we call society  
You cant see further than the bottom of your glass  
Only young but easily shocked  
You get all violent when the boat gets rocked   
  
Just like sheep  little lambs into the slaughter  
Dont fully grasp what exactly is wrong   
Truth is you never cared  still   
You get all violent when the boat gets rocked   
  
Intelligence should be our first weapon  
And stop reveling in rejection  
And follow yourselves not some ageing drain brain  
Whose quite content to go on feeding you garbage  
Were running on the spot  always have  always will  
Were just the next generation of the emotionally crippled
