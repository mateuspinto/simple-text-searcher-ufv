My fathers father was the wisest man i ever knew  
Sixty years of education  
Seven years of school  
Farming kept his body strong  
At night the only books he owned  
Kepted his mind sharp as a tack  
The family bible and the farmers almanac  
  
When to plant  
When to harvest  
How you weed just what you sow  
When to look for rain and who to turn to when it dont  
There was a plan for defrost  
Salvation for the lost  
Words to live and die by front to back  
The family bible and the farmers almanac  
  
One came from his mother  
Handed down the day she died  
The coop sent the other  
Every year at Christmastime  
He knew the seasons to the day  
Knew Paul and peter by first name  
He could answer any question he was asked  
With the family bible and the farmers almanac  
  
When to plant  
When to havest  
How you weed just what you sow  
When to look for rain and who to turn to when it dont  
There was a plan for defrost  
Salvation for the lost  
Words to live and die by front to back  
The family bible and the farmers almanac  
  
He knew the way to get  
Through this life to the next  
While others spoke of faith  
He found the facts  
In the family bible and the farmers almanac  
The family bible and the farmers almanac
