Blue girls come in every size  
Some are wise and some otherwise  
They got pretty blue eyes  
For an hour a man may change  
For an hour her face looks strange  
Looks strange looks strange  
  
Marching to the promised land  
Where the honey flows and takes you by the hand  
Pulls you down on your knees  
While youre down a pool appears  
The face in the water looks up  
And she shakes her head as if to say  
That its the last time youll look like today  
  
Sail away away  
Ripples never come back  
Gone to the other side  
Sail away sail away  
  
The face that launched a thousand ships  
Is sinking fast that happens you know  
The water gets below  
Seems not very long ago  
Lovelier she was than any that I know  
  
Angels never know its time  
To close the book and gracefully decline  
The song has found a tale  
My what a jealous pool she is  
The face in the water looks up  
She shakes her head as if to say  
That the blue girls have all gone away  
  
Sail away away  
Ripples never come back  
Theyve gone to the other side  
Look into the pool  
Ripples never come back  
Dive to the bottom and go to the top  
To see where they have gone  
Oh theyve gone to the other side
