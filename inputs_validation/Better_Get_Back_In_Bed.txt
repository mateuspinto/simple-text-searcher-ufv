Pied Piper  
Id better get back in bed  
Hope Ill see you again  
  
Pied Piper  
Id better get back in bed  
Hope Ill see you again  
  
Pied Piper  
Id better get back in bed  
Hope Ill see you again  
  
Pied Piper  
Ill be running along  
  
Thirty seconds after he was in bed  
He fell back to sleep  
  
The next morning  
He had forgotten all about  
What had happened the night before  
  
But when night time came once again  
His thoughts somehow found their way back  
To remembering the fascinating episode of the night before  
  
He he turned out his bedroom light  
And sat in his favorite chair  
Thoughts danced in his head for a while  
Suppose I went to check and see if my transistor is still down there  
He said I wonder what would happen
