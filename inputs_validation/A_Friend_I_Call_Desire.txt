Desire  
Desire  
Desire  
Desire  
  
You live for love I long for it  
You give for love I take from it  
This friend of mine desire  
This lovers crime desire  
Emotion driving all the time  
A burning need for things not mine  
  
Desire  
Desire  
Desire  
  
You reach for love I walk from it  
You fight for love I run from it  
My enemy desire  
Caressing me desire  
The torch I carried burnt my hand  
I cant control what I cant stand  
  
Desire  
Desire  
Desire  
  
You live for love I lie for it  
You give for love I shy from it  
  
And the pain and the lust  
And the want and the hurt  
And the lies and the fear  
And the urge and the feel  
And the touch and its all  
  
A friend I call desire  
  
You live for love I lie for it  
You live for love I die for it  
  
And the pain and the lies  
And the touch and its all  
  
A friend I call desire
