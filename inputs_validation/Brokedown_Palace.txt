Fare you well my honey  
Fare you well my only true one  
All the birds that were singing  
Have flown except you alone  
  
Going to leave this brokedown palace  
On my hands and my knees I will roll roll roll  
Make myself a bed by the waterside  
In my time in my time I will roll roll roll  
  
In a bed in a bed  
By the waterside I will lay my head  
Listen to the river sing sweet songs  
To rock my soul  
  
River gonna take me  
Sing me sweet and sleepy  
Sing me sweet and sleepy  
All the way back back home  
Its a far gone lullaby  
Sung many years ago  
Mama Mama many worlds Ive come  
Since I first left home  
  
Going home going home  
By the waterside I will rest my bones  
Listen to the river sing sweet songs  
To rock my soul  
  
Going to plant a weeping willow  
On the banks green edge it will grow grow grow  
Sing a lullaby beside the water  
Lovers come and go the river roll roll roll  
  
Fare you well fare you well  
I love you more than words can tell  
Listen to the river sing sweet songs  
To rock my soul
