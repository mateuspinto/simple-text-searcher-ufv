You never heard my song before the music was too loud  
But now I think you hear me well for now we both know how  
No star can light our way in this cloud of dark and fear  
But some day one day  
  
Funny how the pages turn and hold us in between  
A misty castle awaits for you  
And you shall be a Queen you shall be a Queen  
Today the cloud it hangs over us and all is grey  
But some day one day  
  
When I was you and you were me and we were very young  
Together took us nearly there the rest may not be sung  
So still the cloud it hangs over us and were alone  
But some day one day  
Well come home
