Tell me when the time we had slipped away  
Tomorrow turned to yesterday and I dont know how  
Tell me what can stop this river of tears  
Its been building up for years for this moment now  
  
Here I stand arms open wide  
Ive held you close kept you safe  
Till you could fly  
  
Tell me where the road ahead is gonna bend  
And how to harness up the wind and how to say goodbye  
  
Tell me why does following your dreams  
Take you far away from me and I knew that it would  
  
Tell me how to feel the space you left behind  
And how to laugh instead of cry and how to say goodbye  
  
Here I stand arms open wide  
Ive held you close kept you safe  
Till you could fly  
  
Tell me where the road ahead is gonna bend  
And how to harness up the wind and how to say goodbye
