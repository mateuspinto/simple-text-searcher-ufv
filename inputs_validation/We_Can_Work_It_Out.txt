Try to see it my way  
Do I have to keep on talking till I cant go on  
While you see it your way  
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone  
  
We can work it out  
We can work it out  
  
Think of what youre saying  
You can get it wrong and still you think that its alright  
Think of what Im saying  
We can work it out and get it straight or say good night  
  
We can work it out  
We can work it out  
  
Life is very short and theres no time  
For fussing and fighting my friend  
I have always thought that its a crime  
So I will ask you once again  
  
Try to see it my way  
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong  
While you see it your way  
Theres a chance that we may fall apart before too long
