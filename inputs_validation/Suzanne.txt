Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river  
You can hear the boats go by you can spend the night beside her  
And you know that shes half crazy but thats why you wanna be there  
And she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from China  
And just when you mean to tell her that you have no love to give her  
Then she gets you on her wavelength and she lets the river answer  
That youve always been her lover  
  
Chorus  
And you want to travel with her  
And you want to travel blind  
And you know that she will trust you  
For youve touched her perfect body with your mind  
  
And Jesus was a sailor when He walked upon the water  
And He spent a long time watching from His lonely wooden tower  
And when He knew for certain only drowning men could see him  
He said all men will be sailors then until the sea shall free them  
But He Himself was broken long before the sky would open  
Forsaken almost human He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone  
  
Chorus  
And you want to travel with him  
And you want to travel blind  
And you think maybe youll trust him  
For hes touched your perfect body with his mind  
  
Now Suzanne takes your hand and she leads you to the river  
She is wearing rags and feathers from Salvation Army counters  
And the sun pours down like honey on Our Lady of the Harbour  
And she shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers  
There are heroes in the seaweed there are children in the morning  
They are leaning out for love and they will lean that way forever  
While Suzanne holds the mirror  
  
Chorus  
And you want to travel with her  
And you want to travel blind  
And you know that you can trust her  
For shes touched your perfect body with her mind
