It was 929 929 back street big city  
The sun was going down there was music all around  
It felt so right  
  
It was one of those nights one of those nights when  
You feel the world stop turnin you were standing  
There there was music in the air I should have been  
Away but I knew Id have to stay  
  
Chorus  
Last train to London just headin out  
Last train to London just leavin town  
But I really want tonight to last forever  
I really wanna be with you  
Let the music play on down the line tonight  
  
It was one of those nights one of those nights when  
You feel the fire is burnin everybody was there  
Everybody to share it felt so right  
  
There you were on your own lookin like you were  
The only one around I had to be with you  
Nothin else that I could do  
I should have been away but I knew Id have to say  
  
Chorus  
  
Underneath a starry sky time was still but hours  
Must really have rushed by I didnt realize  
But love was in your eyes I really should have  
Gone but love went on and on  
  
Chorus
