Something takes a part of me  
Something lost and never seen  
Every time I start to believe  
Somethings raped and taken from me from me  
Lifes gotta always be messing with me You wanna see the light  
Cant they chill and let me be free So do I  
Cant I take away all this pain You wanna see the light  
I try to every night all in vain in vain  
  
Sometimes I cannot take this place  
Sometimes its my life I cant taste  
Sometimes I cannot feel my face  
Youll never see me fall from grace  
  
Something takes a part of me  
You and I were meant to be  
A cheap fuck for me to lay  
Something takes a part of me  
  
Feeling like a freak on a leash You wanna see the light  
Feeling like I have no release So do I  
How many times have I felt diseased You wanna see the light  
Nothing in my life is free is free  
  
Sometimes I cannot take this place  
Sometimes its my life I cant taste  
Sometimes I cannot feel my face  
Youll never see me fall from grace  
  
Something takes a part of me  
You and I were meant to be  
A cheap fuck for me to lay  
Something takes a part of me

So fight Something on the dum na ema  
Fight sometimes they fight  
So Something on the dum na ema  
Fight somethings they fight  
Fight Something on the dum na ema  
No somethings they fight  
Fight Something on the dum na ema  
Buy somethings they fight  
Something takes a part of me  
You and I were meant to be  
A cheap fuck for me to lay  
Something takes a part of me  
Part of me  
Part of me  
Part of me
