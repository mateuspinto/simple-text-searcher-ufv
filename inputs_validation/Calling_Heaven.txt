Chorus  
Calling heaven  
Seeking mercy  
Tell me theres a place for these  
What of the children who have never felt a love  
Tender as the morning  
Nursing the bruises  
And the scars that never seem to go away  
  
What of the babies who have never left the womb  
Breathing in the lifeline  
Angels in waiting  
Gone before they could be given wings to fly  
  
Chorus  
  
What of the noble who are searching for the truth  
With truest of intentions  
And yet theyre jaded by  
Hypocrisies behind cathedral walls  
  
What of the humble and the meek that knew despair  
And never got their moment  
But sacrificed a life of comfort  
So that others knew no pain  
  
Chorus  
  
What of the ones who call you Lord  
But play the field  
with faithless indecision  
Forgive us father for we truly  
Do not know what we have done  
  
Chorus
