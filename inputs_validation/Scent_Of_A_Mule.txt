Kitty Malone sat on a mule  
Was riding in style  
When suddenly like the sound of a buzzards breaking  
Kitty felt laser beams being fired at her head  
She said I hate laser beams  
And you never done see me askin  
For a UFO  
In Tomahawk County  
  
Well she kicked the mule  
And it walked the path  
And the aliens fired from behind  
Till she stopped the mule  
And she kicked the rump  
And the big old mule took a big old dump  
  
Chorus  
Scent of a mule you better watch out where you go  
Take your laser beams away  
Scent of a mule you better watch out where you go  
You better stop that laser game  
Or youll smell my mule  
  
She felt the fire against her neck  
And it saddened her to feel it burn  
When suddenly like the sound of a breeding Holstein  
Kitty said Stop we aint lookin for fightin  
In Tomahawk County  
  
A little guy from the UFO  
Came on out and said his name was Joe  
She said Come on over for some lemonade  
Just follow me now with the whole brigade  
  
Chorus  
  
They walked into her cabin shack  
They had never seen a southern home  
And they liked it better than their UFO  
They liked it they really liked it  
They said Heres a place of elegance  
Here we shower ourselves in lightness  
  
Chorus
