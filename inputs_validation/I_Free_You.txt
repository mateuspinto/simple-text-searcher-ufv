A serenade is through and all the fireworks fade away  
A gathering is gone so no more holiday  
  
On the run run till were done done away again  
Nothing left left out of breath breath we waste again  
It doesnt really matter no it doesnt anyway  
  
I held on  
To long  
I just cant break through  
I free you oh  
I free you  
  
Your sadder days are best to remember none of this  
Nobody comes around to remind me of what I miss  
  
Written down down on the ground ground away again  
Something wrong wrong now its gone gone to waste again  
It doesnt really matter no it doesnt anyway  
  
I held on  
To long  
I just cant break through  
I free you oh  
I free you  
I free you oh  
I free you  
  
I hear it  
I hear it  
I hear it  
  
A frozen on the tracks before the train I hear it  
The bullet size before the pain I hear it  
Waiting for the flash up in the sky I hear it  
  
I take the fall into the light  
  
I held on  
To long  
I free you oh  
I free you  
I free you oh  
I free you
