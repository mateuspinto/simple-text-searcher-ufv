I was twenty and she was eighteen  
We were just about as wild as we were green  
In the ways of the world  
Shed pick me up in that red rag top  
We were free of the folks and hiding from the cops  
On a summer night  
Running all the red lights  
Wed park way out in a clearing in a grove  
And the night was as hot as a coalburning stove  
We were cooking with gas  
Knew it had to last  
  
Chorus  
In the back of that red rag top  
She said please dont stop  
  
Well the very first time her mother met me  
Her greeneyed girl had been a mothertobe  
For two weeks  
I was out of job and she was in school  
And life was fast and the world was cruel  
We were young and wild  
We decided not to have the child  
So we did what we did and we tried to forget  
And we swore up and down there would be no regrets  
In the morning light  
But on the way home that night  
  
Chorus  
  
We took one more trip around the sun  
But it was all make believe in the end  
And no I cant say where she is today  
I cant remember who I was back then  
  
Well you do what you do and you pay for your sins  
And theres no such thing as what might have been  
Thats a waste of time  
Drive you out of your mind  
I was stopped at a red light just yesterday  
Beside a young girl in a cabriolet  
And her eyes were green  
And I was in an old scene  
  
Chorus  
I was back in that red rag top  
On the day she stopped loving me  
I was back in that red rag top  
On the day she stopped loving me
