Hello tell me you know  
Yeah you figured me out  
Something gave it away  
And it would be such a beautiful moment  
To see the look on your face  
To know that I know that you know now  
  
And baby thats a case of my wishful thinking  
You know nothing  
Cause you and I  
Why we go carrying on for hours on and  
We get along much better  
Than you and your boyfriend  
  
Chorus  
Well all I really wanna do is love you  
A kind much closer than friends use  
But I still cant say it after all weve been through  
And all I really want from you is to feel me  
As the feeling inside keeps building  
And I will find a way to you if it kills me  
If it kills me  
  
Well how long can I go on like this  
Wishing to kiss you  
Before I rightly explode  
This double life I lead isnt healthy for me  
In fact it makes me nervous  
If I get caught I could be risking it all  
  
Baby theres a lot that I miss  
In case Im wrong  
  
Chorus  
  
If I should be so bold  
Id ask you to hold my heart in your hand  
Tell you from the start how Ive longed to be your man  
But I never said a word  
I guess Im gonna miss my chance again  
  
Chorus  
  
If it kills me  
I think it might kill me  
  
And all I really want from you is to feel me  
Its a feeling inside that keeps building  
And I will find a way to you if it kills me  
If it kills me  
If it kills me  
It might kill me
