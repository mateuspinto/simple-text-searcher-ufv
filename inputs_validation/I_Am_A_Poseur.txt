I am a poseur and I dont care  
I like to make people stare  
I am a poseur and I dont care  
I like to make people stare  
  
Exhibition is the name  
Voyeurism is the game  
Stereoscopic is the show  
Viewing time makes it grow  
  
I am a poseur and I dont care  
I like to make people stare  
I am a poseur and I dont care  
I like to make people stare  
  
My facade is just a fake  
Shock horror no escape  
Sensationalism for the feed  
Caricatures are what you breed  
Breed breed breed breed  
  
I am a poseur and I dont care  
I like to make people stare  
I am a poseur and I dont care  
I like to make people stare  
  
Antiart was the start  
Establishments like a laugh  
Yes were very entertaining  
Overtones can be betraying
