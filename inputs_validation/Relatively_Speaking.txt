Relatively speaking you make me who I am  
I need you exactly like the ocean needs the land  
I need you like the sunshine needs the shadows and the night  
I need you the way love needs the savage hurtful fight  
  
Relatively speaking Im nothing without you  
You are where Ive been before you are where Im going to  
You are living out my dreams and you are all my fears  
You evoke my laughter you unleash every tear  
  
The rich ones need the poor ones  
The blind need those with sight  
Sinners need the pure of heart  
The black ones need the white  
  
Relatively speaking the contrast make sit go  
Every action taken is related in the flow  
Stars and losers kings and fools go dancing hand in hand  
Relatively speaking you make me who I am  
  
Relatively speaking the contrast make sit go  
Every action taken is related in the flow  
Stars and losers kings and fools go dancing hand in hand  
Relatively speaking you make me who I am  
Who I am
