I remember romance  
Bubblebaths at night  
Breakfast in the afternoon  
Love by candlelight  
Love by candlelight  
  
I remember romance  
And lying in her arms  
Her hair across my shoulder  
Her breast upon my arm  
Her breast upon my arm  
  
I remember romance  
And laughing at the moon  
Dancing at the rainbows end  
And losing her too soon  
And losing her too soon  
  
I know we both are sorry  
I know we both still care  
Oh how could we have lost it  
A love beyond compare  
A love beyond compare
