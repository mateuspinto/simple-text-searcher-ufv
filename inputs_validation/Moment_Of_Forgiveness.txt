Well I guess that I was lonely  
Thats why I called you on the phone  
Cause in a moment of forgiveness  
I didnt want to be alone  
  
And I guess that I was willin  
More than I ever was before  
Cause in a moment of forgiveness  
I come a knockin at your door  
  
Baby I woke up crying last night  
Just to realize that you were gone  
Has it been two long years without you  
Tell me now  
When are you gonna come home  
  
Guess that I was hoping  
That youd finally understand  
And in a moment of forgiveness  
Youd reach out and take my hand  
  
Now baby I know  
Your not one for bearing witness  
baby I know  
And you told me that  
One wrong move is gonna sell you out  
one wrong move  
And I see that you kept your word  
see that you kept your word  
And made it harder than it had to be  
Wish I could save you the trouble baby  
oh oh oh  
Give you a little piece of mind  
  
Baby I woke up crying last night  
Just to realize that you were gone  
Its been two long years without you  
When are you gonna come home  
  
Guess that I was hoping  
That youd finally understand  
And in a moment of forgiveness  
Youd reach out and take my hand  
  
And in a moment of forgiveness  
Youd reach out and take my hand
