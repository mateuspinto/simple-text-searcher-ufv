I heard the old man tell his tale  
  
Tinker alone within a storm  
And losing hope he clears the leaves beneath a tree  
Seven stones  
Lay on the ground  
Within the seventh house a friend was found  
And the changes of no consequence will pick up the reins from nowhere  
  
Sailors in peril on the sea  
Amongst the waves a rock looms nearer and not yet seen  
They see a gull  
Flying by  
The Captain turns the boat and he asks not why  
And the changes of no consequence will pick up the reins from nowhere  
Nowhere  
  
Despair that tires the world brings the old man laughter  
The laughter of the world only grieves him  
Believe him  
The old mans guide is chance  
  
I heard the old man tell his tale  
  
Farmer who knows not when to sow  
Consults the old man clutching money in his hand  
And with a shrug  
The old man smiled  
Took the money left the farmer wild  
And the changes of no consequence will pick up the reins from nowhere  
Nowhere  
  
Despair that tires the world brings the old man laughter  
The laughter of the world only grieves him believe him  
The old mans guide is chance
