When the rose  
Slaps your face  
Says your pain is a state of grace I think thats right  
Mirror cracks  
Image bleeds  
Hell touch your desires  
But not your needs  
  
I stand at an open window  
I see everything there is to see  
Ive been watching you  
Isnt it true the fool keeps taking you down down  
Taking you  
Ive been watching you  
Isnt it true the world keeps taking you down down  
Taking you  
  
Party ends  
On the floor  
Hear a voice  
Behind the door  
In the dark  
You play his games  
Forget yourself  
Forget your name  
  
I stand at an open window  
I see everything there is to see  
Ive been watching you  
Isnt it true the fool keeps taking you down down  
Taking you  
Ive been watching you  
Isnt it true the world keeps taking you down down  
Taking you  
  
So there you are all dressed in black  
Walk away and dont look back  
But if you must then cast a stone  
The light is on but theres nothing and no one home I think  
  
Cos Ive been watching you  
Isnt it true the fool keeps taking you down down  
Taiking you  
Ive been watching you  
Isnt it true the world keeps taking you down down  
Taking you  
  
I said I Ive been watching you  
Isnt it true the fool keeps taking you down down  
Taking you  
Ive been watching you  
Isnt true the world keeps taking you down down  
Taking you down
