I gave you joy your best of joy  
I am the moonlight you are the spring ours lifes a sacred thing  
You know I always will love you I am forever  
I am the one who came when you fell down  
I was the only one around the only one  
When things would hurt you  
I am forever wasnt it I who said that you are free  
Wonder if it seems so hard to be and things would hurt you  
I am forever I am forever  
We are forever we are forever  
  
I am your friend through thick and thin  
We need each other well never part our love is from the heart  
We never say I dont need you We are forever  
I am the one who said that you are free  
Wonder if it seems so hard to be the only one and nothing would cheer you  
I am forever wasnt it I who carried you around  
When all the walls came tumbling down  
  
When things would hurt you  
I am forever I am forever  
We are forever we are forever  
You are the sun that lights up the sky when things are shady  
Let come what may we do get by I was the only one around the only one  
When things would hurt you  
We are forever I am forever we are forever I am forever  
We are forever we are forever our love is strong  
We are forever we are forever oh right  
I am forever we are forever I am forever we are forever we are forever  
I am forever I am forever
