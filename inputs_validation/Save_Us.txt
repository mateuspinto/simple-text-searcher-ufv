Too late to call for the priest  
He is not here anymore  
We look at the age of the beast  
And weve seen its vast armies form  
Hear our call  
  
Chorus  
Please save us  
Please save us  
  
In permanent madness we live  
No time for life and for love  
To take is the rule not to give  
Insanity comes from below  
To take us all  
  
Chorus  
  
We believe that the phenomena of nature  
Are the expression of infinitive intelligence  
We express our belief that all forms of life  
Are manifestations of spirit  
And thus all men are children of God  
  
Far from down below one comes prepared to take us all  
Waiting for his future and the final call  
  
We stand on the edge of the world  
Just one step more and we fall  
Guide us and please take our hands  
Without you were weak and alone  
Hear our call  
  
Chorus  
  
Now  
  
Save us from the gods of thunder  
Save us from the dogs of war  
Save us from the creeping nightmares  
Save us from the evils course  
Save us from our own ignorance  
Save us from the man in black  
Save us from the desolation  
Save us from the hate attack  
Save us oh please  
Save us please save us  
Save us oh please  
Save us now
