You came on like an angel  
I didnt see the evil in your eyes  
I could see but I was blinded  
Oh believed your lies  
  
You hit we with your promises  
You shot me I fell to the ground  
Your promise of tomorrow  
When I looked you were  
Nowhere to be found  
  
You set me up right from the start  
Stripped me of my dignity  
You got me straight  
Through the heart  
I never did stand a chance  
You got me straight  
Through the heart  
You cut me and left me for dead  
  
You promised me a heaven  
Turned out to be one hell all the time  
The truth that youre pretending  
Was just a chorus of lies  
  
You set me up right from the start  
Strip me of my dignity  
And got me straight  
Through the heart  
I never did stand a chance  
Got me straight through the heart  
You cut me and left me for dead  
You cut me and left me for dead  
  
You came on like an angel  
Just like an angel  
You set me up  
  
You got me straight  
Through the heart  
I never did stand a chance  
Got me straight through the heart  
You cut me you left me  
Straight through the heart  
You never gave me a chance  
Got me straight thought the heart  
Im bleeding youre leaving  
Got me straight through the heart
