Shed my skin since you came in  
Where do you end and I begin  
Awoke my senses yet you stopped time  
You took me to a deeper high  
The essence of my hopes and fears  
Creation of my muddled dreams  
  
Cowboy Style  
With a peaceful smile  
You are from the temple  
Wont you stay a while  
  
Found my voice to have my say  
You take me close to far away  
And now I find and now I feel  
The ordinary is surreal  
Peace and terror all in one  
My future life has just begun  
  
Cowboy style  
With a peaceful smile  
You are from the temple  
Wont you stay a while  
Wont you stay a while  
  
Wont you stay a while  
  
I am frightened Im aroused  
Im enlightened to the now  
  
Cowboy style  
Cowboy style  
  
Cowboy style  
With a peaceful smile  
You are from the temple  
Wont you stay a while
