I am the author dream up your pain  
Drink as did Bacchus rebel just like Cain  
Lord of the city I shall remain  
All pandemonium I shall reign  
Sit in my fortress up on my hill  
Drinking the wine til Ive had my fill  
Building up high my castle walls  
Oh to veil my splendid fall  
  
I present you I present to you  
I present you this crown of worms  
  
Surrounding myself with mysery  
Drawn curtains heavy of my history  
Exquisite I am perfect unity  
On my left hand is false majesty  
I feign affection refute the true story  
Dispute with creation the lie is my glory  
I care for no one my gospel is death  
For me the lights gone only darkness is left  
  
I present you I present to you  
I present you this crown of worms  
  
As black in deed as cold as stone  
A commandment of one as proud as gold  
As neglected in spirit as time is old  
As legion is numbers as legend is told  
I am alone with the agony of truth  
My power of will my judgment and chain  
My end is knowledge and conscience of guilt  
My final confusion hidden from me till Im done
