Verse 1  
Young the boy might go nuts  
Holes in niggas just like donuts  
Creme be crispy these niggas cant hear me  
Must be the wrong size  
Cause these niggas cant fit me  
Never let em play me  
Never let em bullshit me  
If they ever bullshit me

And when the coroner come to get me  
Ima take you pussys with me  
And I aint trustin 12 shots  
No I keep them choppers with me  
And I dont trust you from a

Verse 2  
Stay on it by the way

Where everybody stay

Thats everybody freak  
Baby like a dry cleaner

Then everybody eat  
They went down I went down  
Now everybody cheap  
Or should I say cheaper  
Or maybe ever lower  
You niggas gettin this shit

And Plus I got a sack  
Got the west side crackin

Verse 3  
Turned a brick into a clothing line a boost commercial  
And hes still talkin yo so whos commercial

Got my AR on em still wont cross over  
I gotta half a box left think I need more soda  
Still rain man sosa  
Just brought this thing in its too big for a holster  
They say Im bipolar so indecisive  
So motherfucking what I know some bitches that like it  
The real niggas recite it the real bitches they love it  
Its just he way that I strut it they just like I want em so fuck it  
  
Chorus
