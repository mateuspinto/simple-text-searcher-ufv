No one knows what its like  
To be the bad man  
To be the sad man  
Behind blue eyes  
  
No one knows what its like  
To be hated  
To be fated  
To telling only lies  
  
But my dreams  
They arent as empty  
As my conscience seems to be  
  
I have hours only lonely  
My love is vengeance  
Thats never free  
  
No one knows what its like  
To feel these feelings  
Like I do  
And I blame you  
  
No one bites back as hard  
On their anger  
None of my pain and woe  
Can show through  
  
But my dreams  
They arent as empty  
As my conscience seems to be  
  
I have hours only lonely  
My love is vengeance  
Thats never free  
  
When my fist clenches crack it open  
Before I use it and lose my cool  
When I smile tell me some bad news  
Before I laugh and act like a fool  
  
And if I swallow anything evil  
Put your finger down my throat  
And if I shiver please give me a blanket  
Keep me warm let me wear your coat  
  
No one knows what its like  
To be the bad man  
To be the sad man  
Behind blue eyes
