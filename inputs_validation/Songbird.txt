Talking to the songbird yesterday  
Flew me to a past not far away  
Shes a little pirate in my mind  
Singing songs of love to pass the time  
  
Gonna write a song so she can see  
Give her all the love she gives to me  
Talk of better days that have yet to come  
Never felt this love from anyone  
  
Shes not anyone  
Shes not anyone  
Shes not anyone  
  
A man can never dream these kind of things  
Especially when she came and spread her wings  
Whispered in my ear the things Id like  
Then she flew away into the night  
  
Gonna write a song so she can see  
Give her all the love she gives to me  
Talk of better days that have yet to come  
Never felt this love from anyone  
  
Shes not anyone  
Shes not anyone  
Shes not anyone
