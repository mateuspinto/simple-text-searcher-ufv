Life mama says  
Is bloodletting go  
If I care for nothing  
Sun dont shine and the grass dont grow  
Bloodletting go  
  
Society dictates  
By rules and regulations  
But when things are so tired  
You see things in the wrong light  
Soon there will be no light  
If the sun dont shine  
  
Life mama says  
Is bloodletting go  
If I care for nothing  
Sun dont shine and the grass dont grow  
Bloodletting go  
  
If by chance we both forget  
The passage of space and time between  
Pick up the pieces cold and wet  
And drive them before the light to clean  
Good times bad times  
Pain will come and pain will go  
If I care for nothing  
Sun dont shine  
  
And if by chance we both forget  
The passage of space and time between  
Pick up the pieces cold and wet  
And drive them before the light to clean  
Good times bad times  
Pain will come and pain will go  
If I care for nothing  
Sun dont shine and the grass dont grow  
Bloodletting go
