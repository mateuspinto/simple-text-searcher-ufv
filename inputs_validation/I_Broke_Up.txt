It was not posed  
It messed me up  
It was her recording herself  
Whisper  
What is it worth to me  
Thinking one thought  
The advice to be okay  
Break into childrens hospital  
Cry it out  
dont fuck with me dont fuck with me  
And I broke up  
Without a note  
And I broke up  
Its a mess  
Go go go go go  
Away from here  
Food color poured out all over her shorts mixed with  
Ill make a gate you cannot pass  
Taped to there loinclothes  
A sign that says Why us  
Flip yourself off but erase it when someone sees you  
This this is the worst vacation ever I am going to cut open your  
Forehead with a roofing shingle Ohh Ohh  
And I broke up  
Without a note  
And I broke up  
And I broke up  
Behind your house  
And I broke up
