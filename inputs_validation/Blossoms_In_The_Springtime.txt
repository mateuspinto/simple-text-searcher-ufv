When I see blossoms in the springtime  
I know that sweetheart time is here  
My love that blossoms in the springtime  
Blooms in my heart through all the year  
  
I love the blossoms in the springtime  
Kissed by the sunshine and the rain  
I love to hold you oh my darlin  
When kisses bloom in sweethearts lane  
  
Sometimes a spark of love may smoulder  
Never to flame all winter long  
Then like the blossoms in the springtime  
Burst with the first red robins song  
  
I love the blossoms in the springtime  
Kissed by the sunshine and the rain  
I love to hold you oh my darlin  
When kisses bloom in sweethearts lane
