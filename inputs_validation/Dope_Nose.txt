Debt  
On my head  
Wasting time  
On my own  
  
Sleep  
Rescue me  
Take me back  
To my home  
  
Chorus  
For the times  
That you want to go and  
Bust rhymes real slow  
Ill appear  
Slap you on the face and  
Enjoy the show  
  
Cheese  
Smells so good  
On a burnt  
Piece of lamb  
  
Fag  
Of the year  
Who could beat  
Up your man  
  
Chorus  
  
Ohhhh  
This dope nose  
  
Chorus  
  
Ohhhh  
This dope nose
