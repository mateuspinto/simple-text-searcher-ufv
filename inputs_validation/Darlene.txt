Where do you go when you think about me  
What do I do when I think about you  
  
Skyline  
Passion  
City streets that I adore  
Shadows  
By me grow  
Rent collectors at my door  
  
You got your religion  
I got my addictions  
We got dirty dishes in the sink  
Looking from the window  
Kissing in the kitchen  
Fall so hard that I dont have to think  
  
Darlene  
This is where I want to be  
Wrapped within your arms eternally  
Falling deep under your spell  
High upon the magic that you weave  
  
Mindless  
Game shows  
Flicking through the multiscreen  
Twilight  
Time is slow  
Fall so hard that I could scream  
  
You got your religion  
I got my addictions  
Fall so hard that I dont have to think  
  
Darlene  
This is where I want to be  
Wrapped within your arms eternally  
Falling deep under your spell  
High upon the magic that you weave  
  
All the things that I adore  
Ones Ive chosen to ignore  
Rent collectors at my door  
I cant take it anymore  
  
Where do you go when you think about me  
What do I do when I think about you  
  
You got your religion  
I got my addictions  
We got dirty dishes in the sink  
  
Darlene  
This is where I want to be  
Wrapped within your arms eternally  
Falling deep under your spell  
High upon the magic that you weave  
  
Darlene  
This is where I want to be  
Wrapped within your arms eternally  
Falling deep under your spell  
High upon the magic that you weave
