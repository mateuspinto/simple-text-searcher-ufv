Verse  Violent J  
I walked into the church dressed up as an altar boy  
I seen a preacha he said little boy Imma teach ya  
Put his hand up on my shoulder felt the claw of the beast  
I never thought itd be so fuckin easy murderin a priest  
We went into the confession booth he took off his clothes  
And cut some yay right on his bible top and ooted his nose  
I jammed a butchers knife 12 inches into his gut  
He looked me right into my eyes while I was yankin it up  
Preacha killas  
Hook  
Crooked preacha killas stop it  
Crooked preacha killas I gotta bloody him up  
Crooked preacha killas stop it  
Crooked preacha killas  
Verse  Shaggy 2 Dope  
I walked into the sermen strapped with an iron crowbar  
I beat a nun into a bloody stew in the trunk of my car  
How the fuck she got fake titties and a pussy ring bullshit
