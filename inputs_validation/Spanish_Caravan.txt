Carry me caravan take me away  
Take me to Portugal take me to Spain  
Andalusia with fields full of grain  
I have to see you again and again  
Take me Spanish caravan  
Yes I know you can  
Trade winds find Galleons lost in the sea  
I know where treasure is waiting for me  
Silver and gold in the mountains of Spain  
I have to see you again and again  
Take me Spanish caravan  
Yes I know you can
