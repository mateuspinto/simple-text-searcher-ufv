For as long as I remember  
Ever since I was a child  
Ive had the understanding in my heart  
That there is a Creator a Master of design  
Who hung the moon and every single star  
But the greatest revelation that I could ever know  
He loves me in my weakness  
And calls me His own  
Chorus  
I have a hope and I believe  
My faith is alive my spirit is free  
Though Hes unseen still I know deep within my soul  
There is a God  
In the arms of human nature  
Ive fallen on the way  
Hes heard the desperation of my cry  
Oh one drink of living water can heal the hurt inside  
He fills my cup it never will run dry  
For the price of my redemption is covered by the blood  
And I have been made worthy  
By His gift of love  
Chorus  
Father of Light  
He never changes He never fails  
Giver of grace author of life  
He paid the price so I can say  
I have a hope and I believe  
My faith is alive Hes living in me  
There is a God  
I do believe I do believe  
Chorus  
There is a God  
Hes the way the truth the life  
There is a God  
His name is Jesus
