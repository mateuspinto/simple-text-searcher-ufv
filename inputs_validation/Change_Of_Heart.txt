Here I am  
Just like I said I would be  
Im your friend  
Just like you think it should be  
Did you think I would stand here andlie  
As our moment was passing us by  
Oh I am here  
  
Waiting for your change of heart  
It just takes a beat  
To turn it around  
Yes Im waiting for you change of heart  
At the edge of my seat  
Please turn it around  
  
Days go by  
Leaving me with a hunger  
I could fly  
Back to when we were younger  
When adventures like cars we would ride  
And the years lied ahead still untried  
While I stand here  
  
Waiting for your change of heart  
  
Blind leading blind  
Never hear the laughter  
Search through time  
Nothing reveals the answer  
If its truth that youre looking to find  
It is nowhere outside of your mind  
I bide my time  
  
Waiting for you change of heart
