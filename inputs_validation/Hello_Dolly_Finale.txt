Horace  
Hello Dolly  
Well hello Dolly  
Its so nice to have you here  
Where you belong  
I never knew Dolly  
Without you Dolly  
Life was awfully flat  
And more than that  
Was awfully wrong  
Dolly  
Heres my hat Horace  
Im staying where Im at Horace  
Dolly will never go away  
  
Horace  
Wonderful woman  
  
Both  
Again   
  
Townspeople  
Put on you Sunday clothes  
When you feel dawn and out  
Strut down the street and have your picture took  
Dressed like a dream your spirits seem to turn about  
That Sunday shine is a certain sign  
That you feel as fine as you look  
  
Take the someone whose arms youre in  
Hold onto her tight and spin  
And one two three one two three one two three  
Look  
  
Cornelius  
I held her  
For an instant  
But my arms felt sure and strong  
  
All  
It only takes a moment  
To be loved a whole life long  
  
Men  
Yes it takes a woman  
A dainty woman  
A sweetheart a mistress a wife  
Oh yes It takes a woman  
A fragile woman  
To bring you the sweet things  
In life  
  
All  
Well well hello Dolly  
Well hello Dolly  
It so nice to have you back  
Where you belong  
Youre looking swell Dolly  
We can tell Dolly  
Youre still glowin  
Youre still crowin  
Youre still goin strong  
Youll see the crowd swayin  
For the bands playin  
One of your old favorite songs  
From way back when  
  
Dolly  
Wow wow wow fellas  
Look at the old girl now fellas  
  
Chorus  
Dolly youll never go away  
Dolly youll never go away  
Dolly youll never go away  
Again
