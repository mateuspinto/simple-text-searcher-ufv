Where should I start  
Disjointed heart  
Ive got no commitment  
To my own flesh and blood  
Left all alone  
Far from my home  
No one to hear me to heal my ill heart I  
  
Keep it locked up inside  
Cannot express  
To the point Ive regressed  
If angers a gift then I guess Ive been blessed I  
  
Keep it locked up inside  
Keep my distance from your lies  
  
Its too late to love me now  
You helped me to show me  
Its too late to love me now  
You dont take a word in  
  
Breaking a part of my heart to find release  
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace  
Breaking a part of my heart to find release  
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace  
  
Breaking a part of my heart to find release Break  
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace Me  
Breaking a part of my heart to find release Too  
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace  
  
Keep it locked up inside  
Keep my distance from your lies  
  
Breaking a part of my heart to find release Break  
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace Me  
Breaking a part of my heart to find release Too  
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace  
Breaking a part of my heart to find release  
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace  
Breaking a part of my heart to find release  
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace  
  
Keep my distance  
Keep my distance  
Keep my distance  
Keep my distance  
  
Spit drips from the jaw of the witless witness  
Cryptic colloquialism shifts your midriff  
Dark all I do embark the shadows  
Involved with my thought catalog analogue rap catalog  
Keep my distance and fear resistance hurt by persistence  
The twisted web of tangled lies  
Strangles my hope to waste and numbs the taste  
And Im forced to face these hate crimes  
Against the state of being  
Feeling the weightlessness pressed between the ceiling  
Reeling around room  
Riding a bubble of sound proof  
Its the frequency making you  
ShaShake with every boom  
Involuntary muscle contraction  
Ignoring and drinking musical gas field euphoria  
The sound pounds to make the dead flush  
To have you a head rush with red thoughts and said stuff
