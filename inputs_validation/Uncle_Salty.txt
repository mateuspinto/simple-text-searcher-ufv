Uncle Salty told me stories of a lonely  
Baby with a lonely kind of life to lead  
My mammy was lusted Daddy he was busted  
They left her to be trusted till the orphan bleeds  
But when she cried at night no one came  
And when she cried at night went insane  
  
Uncle Salty told me when she was just a baby  
That shed get by and maybe someday shed see  
But soon she found her mothers love for all the others  
The pushers and the shovers was the life to lead  
But when she cried at night no one came  
And when she cried at night went insane  
  
Oooh its a sunny day outside my window  
Oooh its a sunny day outside my window  
Oooh oh yeah  
Oooh oh yeah yeah yeah  
  
Now shes doin any for money and a penny  
A sailor with a penny or two or three  
Hers is the cunning for men who come arunnin  
They all come for fun and it seems to me  
That when she cried at night no one came  
And when she cried at night went insane  
  
Oooh its a sunny day outside my window Repeat to fade
