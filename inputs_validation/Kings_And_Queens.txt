Long ago in days untold  
Were ruled by lords of greed  
Maidens fared with gold they dared  
To bare their wombs that bleed  
Kings and queens and guillotines  
Taking lives denied  
Starch and parchment laid the laws  
When bishops took the ride  
Only to deceive  
Oh I know I  
Lived this life afore  
Somehow I know now  
Truths I must be sure  
Tossin turnin nightmares burnin  
Dreams of swords in hand  
Sailing ships the Viking spits  
The blood of fathers land  
Only to deceive  
Living times of knights and mares  
Raising swords for maidens fair  
Sneer at death fear only loss of pride  
Living other centuries  
Deja vu or what you please  
Follows true to all who do or die  
Screams of no reply  
They died  
Screams of no reply  
And died  
Died  
Lordy Lordy they died
