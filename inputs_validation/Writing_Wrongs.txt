Did you know the waters turning yellow  
Have you heard the sky was falling down  
Did you see that guy fall out the window  
Did you know the circus was in town  
  
Have you heard about Bill Chambers mother  
She said a womans work is never done  
And oh yes about that yellow water  
Have you noticed the color of the sun  
  
You have a way of making everything you say seem unreal  
Are you aware that the people who care are mostly stainless steel  
  
Well I heard you finally got my letter  
It should have come about this time last year  
And I hope Bill Chambers mothers better  
Oh did the moon just disappear  
  
You have a way of making everything you say seem unreal  
Are you aware that the people who care are mostly stainless steel
