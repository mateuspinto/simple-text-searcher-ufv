Oh my darling Clementine  
She knew that Cody was the man she wanted but she had waited nearly all her
life  
Just one more trip to town to tell the boys goodbye  
Then hed be back to take her for his wife dont you worry Clementine  
Cody saddled up and left his darling then rode to town to celebrate his plan  
He told em this would be his last carousing  
  
Im gonna settle down boys if I can with my darling Clementine  
Someone said it must have been past midnight when Cody had to face a jealous
man  
Another story goes that no one really knows  
But it seems there was a dancehall girl called Nan dont you tell Clementine  
We do know that the shot or two was heard from some back room  
Then there was a silence in the place  
  
Just one more trip to town but all his chips were down  
They found Cody lying on his face softly calling Clementine  
So buddies make a monument to lay down at his head  
Sure you hate to leave your pal behind  
  
Mother help your daughter put her wedding dress away  
Cause Cody wont be riding back this time to his darling Clementine
