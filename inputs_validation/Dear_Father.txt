A childhood innocence was drowned in your tears  
The demons that you fought are feeding your fears  
The poisoned secrets of your life stand revealed  
The truth destroys you its no longer concealed  
  
Dear father forsaken you knew what you were doing  
In silence your violence has left my life in ruin  
Yeah in ruin yeah  
  
You preyed upon my flesh then prayed for my soul  
Belief betrayed by lust the faith that you stole  
Indoctrination by a twisted desire  
The catechism of an evil messiah  
  
Dear father forgive me I know just what Im doing  
In silence this violence will leave your life in ruin  
Yeah in ruin yeah  
  
Preacher of theocracy hiding your hypocrisy  
Under false sanctity holy phoney empathy  
You have taken my life  
Now its your turn to die  
  
Can you sleep at night when you close your eyes  
Do you think of all the pain from your lies  
Or do you deny youre responsible  
For the victims of the sins you devised  
  
What you gonna tell them when they ask you well then  
Is your conscience pure in your heart  
There is no exemption when you seek redemption  
For all the lives that youve torn apart  
  
Your molestations of the cross you defiled  
A man once holy now despised and reviled  
You took possession while confessing my sins  
And now you have to face whatever death brings yeah  
  
Dear father forsaken you knew what you were doing  
In silence your violence has left my life in ruin yeah  
In ruin yeah yeah yeah  
In ruin yeah
