Get the fire as the flame it burns  
Get the wind as it slowly turns  
Get the earth as it circles by  
Get the sky sea creation fly  
  
This point of living  
This point of giving  
This chance of living has got to be known  
  
Get the fire as the flame it burns  
Get the wind as it slowly turns  
Get the earth  
Get the sky  
  
Far away in the depths of Hawkings mind  
To the animal primalistic grind  
You bring me reason a simple fact of life Bring me reason  
You dont say youre sorry

Get the wind as it slowly turns  
Get the earth  
Get the sky  
  
The point of living  
The point of living  
This chance of living  
Far away in the depths of Hawkings mind  
To the animal the primalistic grind
