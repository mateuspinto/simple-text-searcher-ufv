There is a power  
Absolute authority that you possess  
For all who receive him  
Those who will just say yes  
Wake up  
Its time for you to realize just who you are  
Youre no more a stranger  
You are a shinning star  
  
Stand by the power  
The power of his light  
Now is the hour  
For you to stand by the power  
  
Greater stronger that any strength the world can find  
Greater than light  
Shinning from deep inside  
Rejoice Lift your voice for victory already won  
Eternal champions  
Power to overcome  
  
Stand by the power  
The power of his light  
Now is the hour  
For you to stand by the power  
  
Stand by the power power of his light  
Now is the hour for you to stand by  
Stand by stand by the power
