Rich man poor man beggar man thief  
You can fool some people  
But you cant fool me  
Harbor all the hate and greed  
Threaten demise of democracy  
  
Chorus  
Theres a raging storm  
In a troubled sea  
But youre clouding my mind  
With celebrity  
  
There are darker times for me  
Behind smoke and mirrors amputees  
Its a different world  
Now i see the deflowering  
Of the birds and bees  
  
Chorus  
  
You can fight for the right to be  
But ya better not do a bad show on MTV  
  
Rich man poor man beggar man thief  
You can fool some people but you cant fool me  
Smart bombs rock stars suit case queens  
Gods love we deliver out destiny  
  
Chorus  
  
Come on people yea yea yea yea  
  
Chorus  
  
Come on people yea yea yea yea
