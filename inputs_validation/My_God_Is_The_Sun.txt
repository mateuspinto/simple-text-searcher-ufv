Far beyond the desert road  
Where everything ends up  
So good the empty space mental erase  
Forgive forgot  
  
Heal them like fire from a gun  
Kneeling my god is the Sun  
Heal them with fire from above  
Kneeling my god is the Sun  
  
I dont know what time it was  
I dont wear a watch  
So good to be an ant who crawls  
Atop a spinning rock  
  
Heal them like fire from a gun  
Kneeling my god is the Sun  
Heal them with fire from above  
Kneeling my god is the Sun  
  
Heal them like fire from a gun  
Kneeling my god is the Sun  
Healing kneeling  
Godless heathens  
  
Godless heathens always waltz on the sky
