Tears come pourin down my face  
No one knows how I feel  
I wanted to show you all the fellings that are real  
  
Dont look at me like that  
Coz I know I did nothin to you  
Ill show you all the things  
That youve put me through  
  
It is not a compliment  
It is words from my heart  
And thats how they will be  
Chorus  
Everything is just mine  
Every part of my life is too  
Every feelin I feel  
I can not lie  
Coz every time I try I get put through hell  
  
What do you think of me  
And how do you feel bout me  
Why do you hate me  
Coz I know I did nothing to you
