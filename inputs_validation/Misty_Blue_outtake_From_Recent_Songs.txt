Oh but its been such a long long time  
Thought Id got you off my mind  
Looks like I cant just the thought of you  
Turns my whole world a misty blue  
Just the mention of your name  
Fans the flicker to a flame  
I cant forget the things we used to do  
My whole world turns misty blue  
You know I should forget you  
I really should  
And heaven knows that I tried  
But when I told you  
When I said that we were through  
Deep in my heart I lied  
Baby oh what a long long time  
Thought Id get you off my mind  
Oh but I cant just the thought of you  
Turns my world misty blue  
And the very mention of your name  
Fans the flicker to a flame  
I think of things we used to do  
My whole world turns misty blue
