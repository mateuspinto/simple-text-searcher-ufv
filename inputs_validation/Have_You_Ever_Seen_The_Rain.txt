Someone told me long ago  
Theres a calm before the storm  
I know  
Its been comin for some time  
When its over so they say  
Itll rain a sunny day  
I know  
Shinin down like water  
  
Chorus  
I want to know have you ever seen the rain  
I want to know have you ever seen the rain  
Comin down on a sunny day  
  
Yesterday and days before  
Sun is cold and rain is hard  
I know  
Been that way for all my time  
Till forever on it goes  
Through the circle fast and slow  
I know  
It cant stop I wonder  
  
Chorus  
  
Yeah  
  
Chorus
