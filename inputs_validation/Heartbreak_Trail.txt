A cowboy return to the scene of his childhood  
To his sweetheart of long long ago  
But today he returns she was wed to another  
Tells the story of heartbreak and woe  
  
Cowboy ridin  
Sorrow hidin  
Head bowed lonesome and blue  
Church bells ringin  
  
Boy sat singin  
Someone sayin adieu  
Loves old sweet song  
Was never meant to turn out wrong  
  
Even in a cowboys song bout old pal  
I guess we strayed too long  
Yes sir heaven bless her  
Either caress her  
  
As we ride the heartbreak trail  
Loves old sweet song  
Was never meant to turn out wrong
