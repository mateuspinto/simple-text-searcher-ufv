She told the story  
I listened with my eyes closed  
So sad but so true  
She whispered softly  
  
I asked her why she did so  
She knew that I knew  
She was a skater  
The ice was her second home  
  
The countrys finest  
Everyone could see  
She had a plan  
  
To break across the border  
Instead of waiting for  
The powers that be  
  
Cry freedom sweet freedom  
Tell the whole world  
To get ready  
Cry freedom sweet freedom  
Tell the whole world  
That were ready  
  
She said goodnight  
But just as I was leaving  
A black car came into view  
And waiting there  
They could hear me breathing  
They knew that I knew cry freedom  
  
Insane questions  
They asked me what did I know  
So strange they let me go  
But more they try  
The stronger our love grows  
I know that I know cry freedom  
  
Cry freedom sweet freedom
