He came from Kentucky least ways thats what Ive been told  
Me and fate had left that state before his corpse got cold  
Hed been killed for gold hhen California could be sold  
To any fool who had been told bbout the Punkin Center Barn Dance  
  
Mama had the fever and my daddy sold his soul  
To someone called the devil that hed met along lifes road  
Dad would stop to drink a toast and mom was looking like a ghost  
Was gonna beat us to the coast and the Punkin Center Barn Dance  
  
At the Punkin Center Barn Dance thats where everyone would be  
Dancing to Virginias reel and the waltz of Tennessee  
When the roll is called up yonder you can hear the angels sing  
At the Punkin Center Barn Dance God is gold the grass is green  
  
Yeah I left California just before the Grateful Dead  
Told the truth about the gold Id searched for in my head  
Like my Dad Id roamed the land and Mom could never understand  
How Lucifer could bring a man to the Punkin Center Barn Dance  
  
Well times are changin poets say since mom and dad both passed away  
But some things in this life will never change  
The poets write of things to come the earth will melt into the sun  
And you and I will be the ones at the Punkin Center Barn Dance  
  
At the Punkin Center Barn Dance  
At the Punkin Center Barn Dance
