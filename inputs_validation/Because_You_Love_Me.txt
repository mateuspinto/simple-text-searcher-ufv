Because you love me the stars do shine  
Because you love me the world is mine  
Because I love you youll always be  
My everything my only love eternally  
  
Because you love me angels sing  
Because you love me I have everything  
Because you love me my life is complete  
My guiding star I know you are my destiny  
  
Because I love you the church bells ring  
Because I love you I have everything  
Because I love you I want you to be  
My only love for evermore eternally
