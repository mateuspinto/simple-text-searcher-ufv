Look upon me  
I am the beast  
Demonomania Demonomania Demonomania  
My father was a wolf  
Demonomania Demonomania Demonomania  
My mother was a whore  
You check and see  
We arent like other wolves  
Its in the blood  
I wanna be the fucking savior  
Humans are weak  
What else you fucking do  
Humans are weak  
I went to Hell  
Demonomania Demonomania Demonomania  
My father was a wolf  
Demonomania Demonomania Demonomania  
My mother was a whore  
Demonomania Demonomania Demonomania  
My mother was a whore  
Demonomania Demonomania Demonomania  
My father was a wolf
