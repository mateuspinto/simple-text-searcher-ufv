We came down the stairs  
And hardly said a word  
And all through the day  
Thats all we heard  
And we wanted to know  
Where mariners went wrong  
And all through the day  
We played the same song  
  
And I let the wind blow down my leg  
And I let the rain wash over my face  
cause Ive seen love  
Falling in the rain  
Lightening up the sun  
To show you that you  
Are here again  
  
We lived by the door  
And we hardly knew what for  
And all through the day  
Nothing was heard  
But I still want to know  
Where mariners way went wrong  
And all the same year  
They play the same son  
  
Repeat chorus twice
