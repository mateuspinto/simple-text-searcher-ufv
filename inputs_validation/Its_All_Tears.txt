And drown in this love  
Im waiting for you to drown in my love

And drown in this love  
Open your arms and let me show

And drown in this love  
So my love your laughter is finally  
turning into tears  
And youre begging for more though

Ill violate you in the most sensual way  
until you drown in this love  
Im waiting for you to drown in my love  
So open your arms  
Im waiting for you to open your arms  
And drown in this love  
Im waiting for you to drown in my love  
So open your arms  
Im waiting for you to open your arms  
And drown in this love
