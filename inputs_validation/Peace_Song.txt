Now everybodys looking for a little peace of mind  
Were a generation running out of time  
Theres a bomb theres a man  
Theres a gun in his hand yeah  
Nobody smiles at strangers were scared from birth  
Afraid the mans gonna take us for all that were worth  
Strip us of our pride  
Make a strike from inside  
Come on and tell me  
How long will we be victims of fear  
With a man and a gun and the day after fear  
Jesus smile down upon your children  
Smile down upon your family  
  
Even lovers have trouble at hand  
Whats your preference where do you stand  
You get all uptight about it  
Wanna fight about it  
Wanna fight about love  
No no no  
Wanting independence separate but equal  
A lover here another there  
One more for the sequel to the heartache  
How much more can we take  
Wont you tell me  
How long will we be victims of fear  
With a man and a gun and the day after fear  
Jesus smile down upon your children  
Smile down upon your family  
  
Now Im talking about  
Altruism and unification  
We forgotten what that means  
Cynicism in this mighty nation  
And hatred is spitting us right at the seams  
  
Oh but I still believe that good will prevail  
And if we dont ever try  
Its damn sure that well fail  
Lose another day  
The american way  
So come all believers  
Come all races  
Start looking at the souls  
Not at the faces  
And were there  
And were learning to care  
I want to know baby  
How long will we be victims of fear  
With a man and a gun and the day after fear  
Jesus smile down upon your children  
Smile down upon your family  
Jesus smile down upon your children  
Smile down upon your family
