I have a present  
It is a present  
Youll have to learn to find it within you  
If you could learn  
To love it you just might like it  
You cant live without it  
Theres a million open windows  
Passing these opened windows  
Passing these opened windows  
  
Whoah Whoah Whoah x2  
  
There is plenty  
To criticize  
It gets so easy to narrow these eyes  
But these eyes will stay wide  
I will stay young  
Young and dumb inside  
I had just begun  
To forget my lines  
Youre not punk and Im telling everyone  
  
Chorus  
You could save yourself  
You could save us all  
Go on living prove us wrong  
Your leap of faith  
Could be a welltimed smile  
Survival never goes out of style  
  
I have a message save your generation  
Were killing each other by sleeping in  
Finnegan begin again  
This one can be won  
One can become two  
Two can pick and choose  
You could be the first  
  
Chorus  
You could save yourself  
You could save us all  
Go on living prove us wrong  
Your leap of faith  
Could be a welltimed smile  
Survival never goes out of style  
  
You have to learn to learn from your mistakes  
You can afford to lose a little face  
The things you break  
Some cant be replaced  
A simple rule every day be sure you wake  
  
Chorus  
You could save yourself  
You could save us all  
Go on living prove us wrong  
Your leap of faith  
Could be a welltimed smile  
Survival never goes out of  
Survival never goes out of  
Survival never goes out of style
