When summers gone and winters past  
It seems like a neverending way  
And thinking of what I have to say  
It seems like a neverending way  
I am within you now with my sinful cry  
I am within you now one am I  
Perish the love perish your love  
When the sunfilled summer comes to love  
It seems like a neverending way  
It comes to us like a snowwhite dove  
It seems like a neverending way  
I am within you now with my lonely cry  
I am within you now till the time we die  
I am within you now till the time we perish the love  
Perish your love
