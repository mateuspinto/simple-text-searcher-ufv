You were the only thing I had  
How could a good love go so bad  
Somehow I guess I should have known  
That you would leave me here alone  
  
They say you found somebody new  
But that wont change my love for you  
How could you leave me on my own  
You know I hate to sleep alone  
  
Remember how it used to be  
When you were here with me  
You were the only one Ive known  
And how I hate to sleep alone  
  
Someday some way somebody new  
Will make you feel the way that I do  
But I just wish that youd come home  
You know that I hate to sleep alone  
  
But I just wish that youd come home  
You know that I hate to sleep alone
