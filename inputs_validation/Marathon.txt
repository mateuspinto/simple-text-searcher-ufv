Its not how fast you can go  
The force goes into the flow  
If you pick up the beat  
You can forget about the heat  
More than just survival  
More than just a flash  
More than just a dotted line  
More than just a dash  
  
Its a test of ultimate will  
The heartbreak climb uphill  
Got to pick up the pace  
If you want to stay in the race  
More than just blind ambition  
More than just simple greed  
More than just a finish line  
Must feed this burning need  
In the long run  
  
From first to last  
The peak is never passed  
Something always fires the light  
That gets in your eyes  
One moments high  
And glory rolls on by  
Like a streak of lightning  
That flashes and fades  
In the summer sky  
  
Your meters may overload  
You can rest at the side of the road  
You can miss a stride  
But nobody gets a free ride  
More than high performance  
More than just a spark  
More than just the bottom line  
Or a lucky shot in the dark  
In the long run  
  
You can do a lot in a lifetime  
If you dont burn out too fast  
You can make the most of the distance  
First you need endurance  
First youve got to last
