Ive come to wish you an unhappy birthday  
Ive come to wish you an unhappy birthday  
Cause youre evil  
And you lie  
And if you should die  
I may feel slightly sad  
But I wont cry  
  
Loved and lost  
And some may say  
When usually its Nothing  
Surely youre happy  
It should be this way   
I say No Im gonna kill my dog  
And  May the lines sag may the lines sag heavy and deep tonight  
  
Ive come to wish you an unhappy birthday  
Ive come to wish you an unhappy birthday  
Cause youre evil

And if you should die  
I may feel slightly sad  
But I wont cry  
  
Loved and lost  
And some may say  
When usually its Nothing  
Surely youre happy  
It should be this way   
I said No  
And then I shot myself  
So drink drink drink  
And be ill tonight  
  
From the one you left behind  
From the one you left behind  
From the one you left behind  
From the one you left behind  
Behind  
Behind  
Behind  
Behind  
Behind  
Behind  
Oh unhappy birthday  
Behind  
Behind  
Behind
