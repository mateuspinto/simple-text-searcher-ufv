Voice from the mountain  
And a voice from the sea  
Voice in my neighborhood  
And a voice calling me  
Tell me my friend my friend  
Tell me with love  
Where can it end it end this  
Voice from above  
  
The sound on the ocean wave  
And the sound in the tree  
Sound in a country lane  
Say you can be free  
Tell me you crowd you crowd  
Tell me again  
Tell me out loud out loud  
This sound is rain  
  
Tune from the hillside  
And tune full of light  
A flute in the morning  
And a chime in the night  
I know the game again  
I know the score  
I know my name my name  
But this tune is more  
  
Voice from the mountain  
And voice from the sea  
Voice from my neighborhood  
And a voice calling me  
Tell me my friend my friend  
Tell me with love  
Where can it end it end this  
Voice from above
