Sittin in the morning sun  
And watching all the birds passing by  
Oh how sweet they sing  
And oh how much I wish that I could fly  
And I try  
I said I try  
I try  
I really try try try  
But I got to  
Pick myself up  
Dust myself off  
Start all over again Chorus 2x  
Sittin in the midday sun  
And wondering where my meals coming from  
After working so hard  
Not even piece of bread at the yard  
And I said I try  
Oh Lord I try  
I try  
I really try try try  
Sittin in the evening sun  
And watching the same birds passing by  
Sittin and wondering  
And waiting for the time for me to fly  
And I try  
I said I try  
Good Lord I try  
I really try try try  
So long and I just find  
It was just a waste of time  
So long and I just find  
I been been wasting all my time  
Ive got to pick myself up
