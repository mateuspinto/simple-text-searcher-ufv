All along I was searching for my Lenore  
In the words of Mr Edgar Allan Poe  
Now Im sober and Nevermore  
Will the Raven come to bother me at home  
  
Calling you calling you home  
You calling you calling you home  
  
By the door you said you had to go  
Couldnt help me anymore  
This I saw coming long before  
So I kept on staring out the window  
  
Calling you calling you home  
You calling you calling you home  
  
I am a natural entertainer arent we all  
Holding pieces of dying ember  
Im just trying to remember who I can call  
Who can I call  
  
Home calling you calling you  
  
I run a secret propaganda  
Arent we all hiding pieces of broken anger  
Im just trying to remember who I can call  
Can I call  
  
Repeat x2  
Born in a war of opposite attraction  
It isnt or is it a natural conception  
Torn by the arms in the opposite directions  
It isnt or is it a Modernist reaction  
  
Is it like this  
Is it always the same  
When a heartache begins is it like this  
  
Do you like this  
Is it always the same  
Will you come back again  
  
Do you like this  
Is it always the same  
Will you come back again  
Do you like this  
  
Do you like this  
Is it like this  
Is it always the same  
If you change your phone number will you tell me  
  
Is it like this  
Is it always the same  
When a heartache begins is it like this  
  
If you like this  
Will you remember my name  
Will you play it again if you like this
