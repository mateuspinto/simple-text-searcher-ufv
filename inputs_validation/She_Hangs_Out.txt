How old dyou say your sister was sister was sister was  
How old dyou say your sister was sister was sister was  
You know youd better keep an eye on her eye on her eye on her  
Do the ronde ronde ronde do the rond rond  
She hangs out

I heard you taught your sister the shigaling too shigaling too shigaling

Well she can teach you a thing or two a thing or two thing or two  
Do the ronde ronde ronde do the rond rond  
She hangs out

You know you best get down here on the double  
Before she gets her pretty little self in trouble  
Shes so fine so fine
