Stand by everything You said  
Stand by the promises we made  
Let go of everythingIve done  
Ill run into Your open arms  
And all I know  
  
Chorus  
I love You more than life  
I love You more than life  
  
Fall back on everything Youve done  
Fall back on everlasting arms  
When all the world is swept away  
You are all the things I need  
Youre the air I breathe  
  
How can it be  
You were the one on the cross  
Lifted for all our shame  
How can it be  
The scars in Your hands are for me  
You are the king of all
