To be an immortal one must not devour  
To be an immortal we gotta know whats right  
To be an immortal we must hide our power  
To be an immortal we gotta use our might  
  
Its the time to flutter and go fly  
We can do whatever  
We will not lie  
Our faces never break a tear  
Cause our smiles are coming from ear to ear  
So Were watching you  
Yes Were protecting you  
Emergency emergency  
  
To be an immortal one must not devour  
To be an immortal we gotta know whats right  
To be an immortal we must hide our power  
To be an immortal we gotta use our might  
  
Its time to start flying  
 Above the ground through the stars in the twilight sky  
Flying Above the moon go round and round till the sun comes out  
Flying Above the ground through the darkness we will never die  
Flying Above the sun go round and round till the moon comes out  
You are my Immortal you will live forever  
  
Just come and join my side Im letting you in  
  
To be an immortal one must not devour  
To be an immortal we gotta know whats right  
To be an immortal we must hide our power  
To be an immortal we gotta use our might  
  
To be an immortal one must not devour  
To be an immortal we gotta know whats right  
To be an immortal we must hide our power  
To be an immortal we gotta use our might  
  
Immortal immortal immortal oh  
Whoa Oh Whoa  
  
To be an immortal one must not devour  
To be an immortal we gotta know whats right  
To be an immortal we must hide our power  
To be an immortal we gotta use our might  
  
To be an immortal one must not devour  
To be an immortal we gotta know whats right  
To be an immortal we must hide our power  
To be an immortal we gotta use our might
