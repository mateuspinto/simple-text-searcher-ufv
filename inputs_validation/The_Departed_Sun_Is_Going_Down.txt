There I stood with the sun in my eyes  
Dust on my face  
And mouth parched and dry  
Memories are racing  
Flashing scenes through my mind  
I know whats ahead  
Today would be a good day to die  
  
Once I thought I had a golden heart  
Once I thought my dreams would never shatter  
Now I stand here  
Jaded and cold  
Epitaph being carved on my tombstone  
  
I would die for you  would you die with me  
No you cant deny  
Would you catch the bullet that was meant for me  
Blaze across the sky  
  
Sun is going down  
And theres no tomorrow  
Sun is going down  
Going down on me  
Sun is going down  
No more time to borrow  
Dance with the devil  
Sun is going down  
For the lonely hearted  
Sun is going down  
In a blink of an eye  
Sun is going down  
On the departed  
Laugh at the devil  
  
I would die for you  would you die with me  
Caught in a fight  
I was drawn again  
I never thought Id be betrayed  
By my best friend  
He lost his life as he went for mine  
If this is the end  
I want to die with you  
  
Would you catch the bullet that was meant for me  
Blaze across the sky  
  
Sun is going down  
Going down on me  
Sun is going down  
No more time to borrow  
Dance with the devil  
Sun is going down  
For the lonely hearted  
Sun is going down  
In a blink of an eye  
Sun is going down  
On the departed  
Laugh at the devil  
  
I would die for you  would you die with me  
No you cant deny  
Would you catch the bullet that was meant for me  
Blaze across the sky  
  
Sun is going down  
Going down on me  
Sun is going down  
No more time to borrow  
Dance with the devil  
Sun is going down  
For the lonely hearted  
Sun is going down  
In a blink of an eye  
Sun is going down  
On the departed  
Laugh at the devil  
  
Sun is going down  
No more time to borrow  
Sun is going down  
Sun is going down  
Sun is going down  
  
  
I would die for you  would you die with me  
Would you catch the bullet that was meant for me
