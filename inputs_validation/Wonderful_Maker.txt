You spread out the skies  
Over empty space  
Said Let there be light  
To a dark and formless world  
Your light was born  
You spread out Your arms  
Over empty hearts  
Said Let there be light  
To a dark and hopeless world  
Your Son was born  
You made the world  
And saw that it was good  
You sent Your only Son  
For You are good  
What a wonderful Maker  
What a wonderful Savior  
How majestic Your whispers  
And how humble Your love  
With a strength like no other  
And the heart of a Father  
How majestiv Your whispers  
What a wonderful God  
No eyes has fully seen  
How beautiful the cross  
And we have only heard that faintest whispers  
Of how great You are
