I lie awake at night  
Listening to you sleeping  
I hear the darkness breathe  
And the rain against the window  
  
After all this time  
Cynical and jaded  
All the stones are diamonds  
All the blues are faded  
  
Everything Ive been through  
All Ive seen and heard  
Spend so much of my life  
In the spiritual third world  
But you came and brought the rain here  
  
Something waiting to happen  
Something learning to fly  
We can talk without talking  
From inside to inside  
I have waited to feel this  
For the whole of my life  
  
We took ourselves apart  
We talked about our faces  
You said you didnt like yours  
I said I disagree  
  
I keep the pieces separate  
I clutch them in my coat  
A jigsaw of an angel  
I can do when I feel low  
  
From emptiness and dryness  
The famine of our days  
I watch the heavens open  
Wash it all away  
You came and brought the rain here  
  
Something waiting to happen  
Something learning to fly  
On the edge of exploding  
Something wild and alive  
Something waiting to happen  
Any time that you like  
I have waited to feel this  
For the whole of my life
