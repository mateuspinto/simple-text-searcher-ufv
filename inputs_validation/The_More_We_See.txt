Our hearts are breathing in the wonders of Your name  
And were breathing out Your praise  
The more we see we sing  
The circle never ends  
For Your glory never fades  
And surely as the rising sun  
Your love O Lord endures Your love endures forever  
  
From the heights of Your throne  
To the depths of Your heart  
Your majesty surrounds us  
In the power of Your life  
In the grace of Your cross  
Your mercy has found us  
  
Your power we see displayed  
In all that You have made  
In the sky and sea and stars  
And here beneath Your cross  
Your mercy speaks so loud  
Speaking straight into our hearts  
And surely as the rising sun  
Your love O Lord endures Your love endures forever  
  
And the more we see we sing  
Holy is the name of the Lord  
And the more we see we sing  
There is no one like You God  
  
Your majesty surrounds us  
Your mercy Lord has found us  
There is no one like You God
