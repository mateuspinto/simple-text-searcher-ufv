Blue overall  
Overall the rooftops blue birds fly apart  
Blue overall  
Overall the bones that cage this stupid heart  
Got blues drawing crosses on my front door  
Blues abringing buckets round the back  
Blues trying to push me from me white fence  
And tar me a darker bluey black  
For all this time  
I really thought you loved me  
For all this time  
You only rubber gloved me  
Blue overall  
Overall my anvil gives no further sparks  
Blue overall  
Overall my fears swim hammer headed sharks  
Got blues drinking beer out in the kitchen  
Blue dog is barking to be fed  
Got blues spilling wine upon me heartrug  
Theyre holding a party in my head  
For all this time  
I really thought you loved me  
For all this time  
You merely went and shoved me  
I tried to lose myself in labour  
The more I push the mirth  
Im giving birth to a babys turning  
Blue overall  
Feeling blue overall  
All over Im turning blue
