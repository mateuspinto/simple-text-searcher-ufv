Things have been tough  
Without the dumb dumb boys  
I cant seem to speak  
The language  
I remember how they  
Used to stare at the ground  
They looked as if they  
Put the whole world  
Looked as if they put  
The whole world down  
  
The first time I saw  
The dumb dumb boys  
I was fascinated  
They just stood in front  
Of the old drug store  
I was most impressed  
No one else was impressed  
Not at all  
And wed sing  
Dadadadadada  
Dumb dumb day  
Where are you now my  
Dumb dumb boys are you  
Alive or dead  
Have you left me the last  
Of the dumb dumb daze  
Then the sun goes down  
And the boys broke down  
  
People said we were negative  
They said wed take but  
We would never give  
But wed sing dadada  
Dadada dumb dumb day  
Dadadadada dumb  
And hope it would pay  
Dadadada its been  
A dumdumdum day  
A dumb dumb day  
  
Now Im looking for  
The dumb dumb boys  
Where are you now  
When I need your noise  
  
Now Im looking for  
The dumb dumb boys  
The walls close in and  
I need some noise
