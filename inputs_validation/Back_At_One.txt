Its undeniable that we should be together  
Its unbelievable how I used to say that Id fall never  
The basis is need to know if you dont know just how I feel  
Then let me show you now that Im for real  
If all things in time time will reveal  
One  youre like a dream come true  
Two  just want to be with you  
Three  Girl its plain to see that youre the only one for me  
Four  repeat steps one through three  
Five  make you fall in love with me  
  
If ever I believe my work is done then  
Ill start back at one  
So incredible the way things work themselves out  
And all emotional once you know that its all about hey  
And undesirable for us to be apart  
Never would of made it very far  
Cause you know you got the keys to my heart  
  
Say farewell to the dark of night  
I see the coming of the sun  
I feel like a little child whose life has just begun  
You came and breathed new life  
Into this lonely heart of mine  
You threw out the life line just in the nick of time
