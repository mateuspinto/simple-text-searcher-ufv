Well Ive heard lots of people say  
Theyre gonna settle down  
You dont see their faces  
And they dont come around  
Well Im not that way  
I got to move along  
  
I like to drink and to dance all night  
Comes to a fix not afraid to fight  
You got that right  
Said you got that right  
Sure got that right  
  
Seems so long I been out on my own  
Travel light and Im always alone  
Guess I was born with a travelin bone  
When my times up Ill hold my own  
You wont find me in an old folks home  
  
You got that right  
Said you got that right  
Well you got that right  
Sure got that right  
  
I tried everything in my life  
Things I like I try em twice  
You got that right  
You sure got that right  
  
Travelin around the world just singing my song  
I got to go Lord I cant stay long  
Here comes that ol travelin jones once again  
  
I like to drink and to dance all night  
Comes to a fix not afraid to fight  
You got that right  
Said you got that right  
Well you got that right  
Sure got that right
