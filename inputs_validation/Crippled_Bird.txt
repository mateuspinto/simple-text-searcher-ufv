Dolly Parton  
A broken heart like a broken wing  
It must have its time to mend  
I am like a crippled bird  
In hopes one day to fly again  
I loved you so and I was faithful  
I cared more than words could say  
But love is cruel and life is hateful  
Now youve gone and flown away  
Oh to die Twould be a pleasure  
Slow to heal but quick to cry  
Fragile as a sparrows feather  
Crippled bird too blue to fly  
Oh the loss is cold and shameful  
And the grief so deep and sharp  
There is nothing quite as painful  
As a true blue broken heart  
Oh to die Twould be a pleasure  
Slow to heal but quick to cry  
Fragile as a sparrows feather  
Crippled bird too blue to fly  
Fragile as a sparrows feather  
Crippled bird too blue to fly
