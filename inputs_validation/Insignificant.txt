Can you see me up on a building  
From down on the pavement  
Or out in the crowd  
  
Can you see me in the glare of the lamp post  
Cause I am walking a tightrope  
Into the moon  
  
Chorus  
I dont want feel so different  
But I dont want to be insignificant  
And I dont how to see the same things different now  
  
Oh can you see me I am one in a million  
Yeah Im Icarus falling out of the sun  
She sees me falling a line of spotlights and chalk lines  
Through night black as a bedroom  
And white as a lie  
  
Chorus  
  
Diving through the dark while the night turns blue  
And you wear your intentions as I wear my intentions  
So clear  
  
Guitar Bridge  
  
If you see me wading through water  
Or come drowning a river  
Right in front of the world  
  
Hey you can wash your face and hands in the stream of my anger  
Cause its as bright as white paper  
As dark as a girl  
  
Chorus x2
