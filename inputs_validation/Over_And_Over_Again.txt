Over and over say you forgive me for the crazy fool Ive been  
Over and over Ill be sorry over and over again  
Would I be untrue to you dear no no never again  
Thats one lesson Ill remember over and over again  
Back together now and forever ever more will I be true  
Over and over Im gonna prove it over and over to you  
 guitar   
Over and over say you forgive me Ill be faithful to the end  
I will prove I can be trusted over and over again  
Would I be untrue to you dear no no never again  
Over and over over and over over and over over and over  
Over and over over and over over and over over and over
