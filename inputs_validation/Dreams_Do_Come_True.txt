Bill Owens  
Like the morning sun  
His love moved across every inch of my body  
And the heat from the fire burned me up with desire  
I thought Id died and gone to heaven for sure  
This morning when I opened my eyes  
There to my surprise  
Lay that angel I thought had been only a dream  
And so I said a little prayer  
And thanked God that he was there  
Oh this is a dream come true  
Dream do come true  
I know cause I found you  
I never thought they did  
But now I do  
Dreams do come true  
It was love at first sight  
And it was love all night  
And the way he made love to me  
Fulfilled all my fantasies  
Ooo this is a dream come true  
Yes dreams do come true  
I know cause I found you  
I never thought they did  
But youre living proof  
That dreams do come true  
Dreams do come true  
And I am so in love with you
