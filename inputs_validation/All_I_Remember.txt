I was lured by the rocking horse  
Sweets and the bualadh bos  
Fifty wild boys to a room  
Sing lamh lamh eile the dish ran away with the spoon  
Black shoes and stockings for those who say dont  
Blue is the colour outside  
God made the world  
The snake tempted Eve and she died  
Wild Christian brothers sharpening their leathers  
Learn it by heart thats the rule  
All I remember is dreading September and school  
CHORUS  
And they made me for better or worse  
The fool that I am or the wise man Ill be  
And they gave me their blessings or curse  
It wasnt their fault I was me   
Not the one that you see  
The priest in confession condemns my obsession  
With thoughts that I do not invite  
I mumble and stutter  
He slams down the shutter  
Goodnight  Good night to you too Father  
Stainless as steel  
Lord you know how I feel  
Someone shoot me while my soul is clear  
I dont think Ill last  
But my vow to abstain was sincere  
Archconfraternity men to the fight  
Raise up your banners on high  
Searching for grace  
Securing my place  
When I die  
CHORUS  
Oh God he kept a very close eye on me  
Hung round my bed in the darkness he spied on me  
Caught me in the long grass so often he died on me  
Ballrooms of romance in Salthill or Mallow  
I stood like John Wayne by the wall  
Lined up like cattle we waited to do battle and fall  
You cant wine and dine her in an old Morris Minor  
So ask her before its too late  
I danced on girls toes  accepted rejection as my fate  
Drink was my saviour it made me much braver  
But I couldnt hold it too well  
I slipped on the coach and ruined my approach as I fell
