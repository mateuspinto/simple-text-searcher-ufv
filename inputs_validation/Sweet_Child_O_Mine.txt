Shes got a smile that  
It seems to me  
Reminds me of childhood memories  
Where everything  
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky  
Now and then when I see her face  
She takes me away to that special place  
And if Id stare too long  
Id probably break down and cry  
  
Oh oh oh  
Sweet child o mine  
Oh oh oh oh  
Sweet love of mine  
  
Shes got eyes of the bluest skies  
As if they thought of rain  
I hate to look into those eyes  
And see an ounce of pain  
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place  
Where as a child Id hide  
And pray for the thunder  
And the rain  
To quietly pass me by  
  
Oh oh oh  
Sweet child o mine  
Oh oh oh oh  
Sweet love of mine  
  
Oh oh oh oh  
Sweet child o mine  
Oh oh oh oh  
Sweet love of mine  
  
Oh oh oh oh  
Sweet child o mine  
Oh  
Sweet love of mine  
  
Where do we go  
Where do we go now  
Where do we go  
Oh oh  
Where do we go  
Oh  
Where do we go now  
Where do we go  
Oh sweet child  
Where do we go now  
Oh  
Where do we go now  
Oh  
Where do we go  
Oh  
Where do we go now  
Oh  
Where do we go  
Where do we go now  
Where do we go  
Oh  
Where do we go now  
No no no no no no  
Sweet child  
Sweet child of mine
