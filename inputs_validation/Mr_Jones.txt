Mr Jones  
Put a wiggle in your stride  
Loosen up  
I believe hell be alright  
Changing clothes  
Now hes got ventilated slacks  
Bouncing off the walls  
Mr Jones is back  
Bulge out  
And wind your waist  
Tight pants  
Got curly hair  
Drinking cold beer  
From metal cans  
Moonshine  
And HandiWipes  
Mr Jones is back in town  
Its his lucky day  
Hold up your hands and shout  
Jones is on his way  
Pitter pat  
Mr Jones is back in town  
Aces high  
Now his pants are falling down  
He looks so fine  
In those patent leather shoes  
Mr Jones you look tired  
I believe youll be alright  
Sales men  
Conventioneers  
Some rock stars  
With tambourines  
Short skirts  
And skinny legs  
Selling bibles  
And real estate  
Its a big day for Mr Jones  
He is not so square  
Mr Jones will stick around  
Hes everybodys friend  
Fast cars  
And motorbikes  
Im sure glad  
Hes on our side  
The Jones Gang  
Down at the bar  
Watch out this time  
Theyve gone too far  
They call for Mr Jones  
They put him in charge  
Mr Jones will help us out  
Hes a lucky guy  
It is Mr Jones Birthday party  
For another year  
In his hotel room Party favors  
Its a holiday
