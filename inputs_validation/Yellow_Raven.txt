The yellow raven sipped the air  
Of thunder and of rain  
The yellow raven sipped the air  
Gentle eyes kissing the rain  
  
Where do you go fantastic dream bird  
Take me away to somewhere  
Take me away from here  
Where do you go fantastic dream bird  
Answer to my yearning  
Take me away from here  
  
The fire bird began to cry  
When the music died away  
The fire bird began to cry  
And smoke was slowly drifting by  
  
Where do you go fantastic dream bird  
Take me away to somewhere  
Take me away from here  
Where do you go fantastic dream bird  
Answer to my yearning  
Take me away from here
