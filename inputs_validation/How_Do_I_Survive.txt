How do I survive if you break my heart  
Im not strong enough  
Just to smile and make things easy  
I cant put on my brave face anymore  
I always took it for granted  
That I could take whatever you gave me  
I guess you never really know for sure  
Cause there was never a doubt in mind  
How it was meant to be  
So who do I turn to darlin if you should leave  
How do I survive if you break my heart  
How do I survive if you break my heart  
Ive got no excuses  
For bein your fool  
I never thought that it would be forever  
But after so much time together  
Ive come to depend on you  
What else am I supposed to do  
Cause there was never a doubt in mind  
It wouldnt be easy  
But I never realized how much you mean to me ho  
How do I survive if you break my heart  
How do I survive if you break my heart  
But there was never a doubt in mind  
How it was meant to be  
So who do I turn to darlin if you should leave  
How do I survive if you break my heart  
How do I survive if you break my heart  
How do I survive  
How do I survive if you break my heart  
If you break my heart  
How do I survive if you break my heart  
Whooh whooh  
How do I survive if you break my heart  
How do I survive  
How do I survive if you break my heart  
Whooh whooh  
How do I survive if you break my heart
