My love is turning  
Like a wheel of fire she burns her way  
My love is burning  
Shes a light to guide me through the fray  
Galadriel spirit of starlight  
Eagle and dove gave birth to thee  
Galadriel spirit of starlight  
You are my love and earth to me my  
Love and earth to me  
My love is seeing  
Through unabiased eyes she reads the signs  
My love is searching  
For new life somewhere shes bound to find  
Galadriel spirit of starlight  
Eagle and dove give birth to thee  
Galadriel spirit of starlight  
You are my love and earth to me  
My love and earth to me
