Takes a second to say goodbye  
Say goodbye oh oh oh  
It takes a second to say goodbye  
Say goodbye oh oh oh say bye bye  
Where you going to now  
  
Lightning flashes across the sky  
East to west do or die  
Like a thief in the night  
See the world by candlelight  
  
Fall rise and fall rise and  
  
In an apartment on Time Square  
You can assemble them anywhere  
Held to ransom hell to pay  
A revolution everyday  
USSR GDR London New York Peking  
Its the puppets Its the puppets  
Who pull the strings  
  
Fall rise and fall rise and  
  
Say goodbye say goodbye  
Say goodbye say goodbye  
Say goodbye  
  
It takes a second to say goodbye  
Say goodbye oh oh oh  
Push the button and pull the plug  
Say goodbye oh oh oh  
  
Fall rise and fall rise and  
  
And theyre doing the atomic bomb  
Do they know where the dance comes from  
Yes theyre doing the atomic bomb  
They want you to sing along  
Say goodbye say goodbye  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye
