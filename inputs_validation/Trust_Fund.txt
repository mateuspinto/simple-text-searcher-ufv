I know a couple who are in love living in the best of times  
A truer love you will never know  
Right next to a pain theyll never realize  
Sheltered from it in a loving glow  
Young and happy and oh so politically correct  
  
Just get it if you need it now  
Just go buy it if you need it in your life  
Dont you worry if it all runs out  
Dont worry because it never will  
  
I know a young girl living in the shadow of the kind of life that she  
Could never make  
She takes it all and gives it back in love to handsome artists in her  
Native state  
She is the angel of the loser and the disenchanted soul  
  
Just get it if you need it now  
Just buy it if it makes you happy  
Dont you worry if it all runs out  
Dont worry because it never will  
Just get it if you need it now  
I know a couple who are in love living in the best of times
