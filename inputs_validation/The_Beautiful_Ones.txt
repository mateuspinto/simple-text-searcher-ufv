Baby baby baby  
Whats it gonna be  
Baby baby baby  
Is it him or is it me  
Dont make me waste my time  
Dont make me lose my mind baby  
  
Baby baby baby  
Cant you stay with me tonight  
Oh baby baby baby  
Dont my kisses please you right  
You were so hard to find  
The beautiful ones they hurt you  
  
Every time  
Paint a perfect picture  
Bring to life a vision in ones mind  
  
The beautiful ones  
The beautiful ones  
Always smash the picture  
  
Always every time  
If I told you baby  
That I was in love with you  
  
Oh baby baby baby  
If we got married  
Would that be cool  
You make me so confused  
The beautiful ones  
You always seems to lose
