Disease spreading death  
Entire population dies  
Dead before youre born  
Massive suicide  
Vicious game of fear  
Its all extermination now  
Poison in your veins  
Global genocide  
Slaughter governs law  
The apocalypse begins  
Pain becomes the norm  
Seeking homicide  
Beware the coming storm  
That starts illuminating fires  
God is laughing hard  
Man has gone insane  
  
World painted blood  
No sanctuary  
World painted blood  
No sanctuary  
  
Tip the human scale  
Follow revelations plan  
It must come to pass  
Secret shadows lie  
Blue print haunting dreams  
In which manipulation wins  
Speak no hidden fears  
Religion neutralized  
Emerged from the dark  
Sadist mercenary ride  
Realm of this world  
Godless messengers  
Sickless mindless hate  
Becoming evolutions cure  
Planets usher in alignment  
God has died  
  
World painted blood  
No sanctuary  
World painted blood  
No sanctuary  
  
God send death watch it bleed justified  
Manufactured lives born in hell  
Angels fall wings on fire crucified  
Terrorizing man burn the world  
Reflecting eyes sickle swings wave of blood  
Suicidal mind from the start  
Endless pain open wounds slit the throat  
Radiation child seeks the throne  
  
Strafing down demigods certain death  
Coming from the stars lord of all  
Dark rift rise flourish life perish man  
We destroy ourselves cease to live  
Childrens blood feed the dead sea of flesh  
Catastrophic fall rest in hell  
Flaming corpse screaming eyes watch it die  
Walk among the dead pick your grave  
  
Repeat x4  
Like a disease spreading death  
Erasing your existence  
  
Satans hand begins the end  
And frees the world forever  
Gomorrahs dream to live in sin  
Has reached its critical mass  
Man himself has become God  
And laughs at his destruction  
In which we trust a secret government  
Is now in total collapse  
  
Disease spreading death  
Entire population dies  
Dead before youre born  
Massive suicide  
Vicious game of fear  
Its all extermination now  
Poison in your veins  
Global genocide  
Slaughter governs law  
The apocalypse begins  
Pain becomes the norm  
Seeking homicide  
Beware the coming storm  
That starts illuminating fires  
God is laughing hard  
Man has gone insane  
  
World painted blood  
No sanctuary  
World painted blood  
No sanctuary
