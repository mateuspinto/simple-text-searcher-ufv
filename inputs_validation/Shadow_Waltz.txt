In the shadows let me come and sing to you  
Let me dream a song that I can bring to you  
Take me in your arms and let me cling to you  
Let me linger long  
Let me live my song  
  
In the winter let me bring the spring to you  
Let me feel that I mean everything to you  
Loves old song will be new  
In the shadows when I come and sing to you  
  
Shadows on the wall  
I can see them fall  
Here and there  
Everywhere  
Silhouettes in blue  
Dancing in the dew  
Here am I  
Where are you  
  
In the winter let me bring the spring to you  
Let me feel that I mean everything to you  
Loves old song will be new  
In the shadows when I come and sing to you dear  
In the shadows when I come and sing to you
