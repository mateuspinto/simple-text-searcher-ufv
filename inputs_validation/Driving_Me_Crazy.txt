No matter where you go Ill be there  
No matter where you hide Ill find you  
Ill be there looking through the window watching everything you do  
Theres no escaping me  
Ill be like your worst enemy  
Im right behind you every place you run to Ill be there with you  
  
Cause being without you is driving me crazy  
Oh I just dont know what to do  
Yes being without you is driving me crazy  
Cause all I want is you  
And I like it  
  
If all the worlds a stage and we are  
Were only just two crazy players  
Please understand why I just cant go on without you anymore  
Theres no escaping me  
I want you back cant you see  
Im losing all control and cannot guarantee my sanity  
  
Cause being without you is driving me crazy  
And I dont know what to do  
Yes being without you is driving me crazy  
Cause all I want is you  
Being without you is driving me crazy  
I dont know how long Ill last  
Being without you is driving me crazy  
Feel my pulse its going so fast  
  
You youre driving me crazy  
Me Im out of my mind  
You youre making me crazy  
Me Im running out of time  
  
I am your conscience Im your guide  
I know just what you feel inside  
I share your darkest thoughts with you but share no consequences for them  
Theres no escaping me  
Im with you while you sleep  
I hear your lies I hear your truth  
I hear you speak before you do  
  
But being without you is driving me crazy  
And I dont know what to do  
Yes being without you is driving me crazy  
Cause all I want is you  
Being without you is driving me crazy  
I dont know how long Ill last  
Being without you is driving me crazy  
Feel my pulse its going so fast
