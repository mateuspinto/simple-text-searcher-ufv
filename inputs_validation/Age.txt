Yeahhhh baby  
Laugh  
  
beat starts  
  
Ehhh Eh Eh Eh Eh Eh Ehmmm  
Yes  
  
Hey young world  
Its young natasha  
With her big bro young weezy right beside er  
And you now I got er  
Like I got er  
Gunz its yo turn and you are the driver  
And whateva ya lost  
All you do is follow  
The roadsigns lead you to a gold mind  
  
How do I know  
It cause I just moved  
Gotta new crib on Goldmind Avenue  
So thats why I got this rich boy attitude  
You probly see me in the Caddy with some Ds  
On that bitch  
Riding down Goldmind Avenue  
In the lane like lm goin get a Allie Oupe  
Oops that was a coupe  
Pass yo ass like lightnings flash  
Cut the light down now and turn me to a darkchild  
My thoughts fall my eyelids are scattered  
And we are Young Money but age doesnt matter
