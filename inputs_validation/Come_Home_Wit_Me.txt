Did you really wanna come out tonight with me  
Did you just wanna go where everybody else goes  
Now I dont need to read your mind  
To see or hear that you aint mine  
Is it just one of us whos gonna take the last late night bus  
  
Chorus  
Come home  
Come home with me  
Come home with me  
  
Your words will always stump me when  
I just need something right  
I wanna kiss you as the sun comes up  
And turns out Friday night  
I got a good mind to get right down to it  
And forget the way I sweat when youre walking through my eye  
  
Chorus  
  
I know that I should be ashamed  
To see you walk away again  
And Ive heard every excuse before  
But youre just too much for me to lose  
Help me girl  
Stop looking so good  
  
Chorus
