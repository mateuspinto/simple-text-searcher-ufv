Rocket engines burning fuel so fast  
Up into the night sky they blast  
Through the universe the engines whine  
Could it be the end of man and time  
Back on earth the flame of life burns low  
Everywhere is misery and woe  
Pollution kills the air the land and sea  
Man prepares to meet his destiny  
Rocket engines burning fuel so fast  
Up into the night sky so vast  
Burning metal through the atmosphere  
Earth remains in worry hate and fear  
With the hateful battles raging on  
rockets flying to the glowing sun  
Through the empires of eternal void  
Freedom from the final suicide  
  
Freedom fighters sent out to the sun  
escape from brainwashed minds and pollution  
Leave the earth to all its sin and hate  
find another world where freedom waits  
Past the stars in fields of ancient void  
Through the shields of darkness where they find  
Love upon a land a world unknown  
where the sons of freedom make their home  
  
Leave the earth to Satan and his slaves  
leave them to their future in the grave  
Make a home where love is there to stay
