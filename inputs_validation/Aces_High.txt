There goes the siren that warns of the air raid  
Then comes the sound of the guns sending flak  
Out for the scramble weve got to get airborne  
Got to get up for the coming attack  
  
Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines  
Remove all the wheelblocks theres no time to waste  
Gathering speed as we head down the runway  
Gotta get airborne before its too late  
  
Running scrambling flying  
Rolling turning diving going in again  
Running scrambling flying  
Rolling turning diving  
Run live to fly fly to live do or die  
Run live to fly fly to live Aces high  
  
Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers  
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away  
Roll over spin round and come in behind them  
Move to their blindsides and firing again  
  
Bandits at 8 Oclock move in behind us  
Ten ME109s out of the sun  
Ascending and turning our spitfires to face them  
Heading straight for them I press down my guns  
  
Rolling turning diving  
Rolling turning diving going in again  
Run live to fly fly to live do or die  
Run live to fly fly to live  
Aces high
