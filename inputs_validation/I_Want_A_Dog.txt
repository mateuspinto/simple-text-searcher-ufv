I want a dog  
A Chihuahua  
When I get back to my small flat  
I want to hear somebody bark  
Oh oh oh you can get lonely  
  
Dont want a cat  
Scratching its claws all over my  
Habitat  
Giving no love and getting fat  
Oh oh oh you can get lonely  
And a cats no help with that  
  
I want a dog  
To walk in the park  
When it gets dark my dog will bark  
At any passersby  
Oh oh oh you can get lonely  
I want a dog  
  
I want a dog  
A Chihuahua  
When I get back to my small flat  
I want to hear somebody bark  
Oh oh oh you can get lonely  
I want a dog
