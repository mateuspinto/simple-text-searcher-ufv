I always wondered if I could give  
Enough love for a woman to live on  
But as I grow as I learn and live  
I find its best to forget and forgive  
  
I could be dancing on the ocean  
I could be singing to the sea  
But I am poetry in motion  
Im yours  
  
When I was young I was so filled with love  
Jealousy stung but never deep enough  
Cause I feel rain falling from above  
I only thirst for your to share my cup  
  
I could be dancing on the ocean  
I could be singing to the sea  
But I am poetry in motion  
Im yours people Take me
