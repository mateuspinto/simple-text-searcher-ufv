I met my old lover  
On the street last night  
She seemed so glad to see me  
I just smiled  
And we talked about some old times  
And we drank ourselves some beers  
Still crazy after all these years  
Still crazy after all these years  
  
Im not the kind of man  
Who tends to socialize  
I seem to lean on  
Old familiar ways  
And I aint no fool for love songs  
That whisper in my ears  
Still crazy after all these years  
Still crazy after all these years  
  
Four in the morning  
Crapped out  
Yawning  
Longing my life away  
Ill never worry  
Why should l  
Its all gonna fade  
  
Now I sit by my window  
And I watch the cars  
I fear Ill do some damage  
One fine day  
But I would not be convicted  
By a jury of my peers  
Still crazy  
Still crazy  
Still crazy after all these years
