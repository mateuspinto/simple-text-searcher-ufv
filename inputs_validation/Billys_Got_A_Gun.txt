Billys got a gun hes on the run  
Confusion in his mind the blind leads the blind  
Yeah Billys got a gun hes gonna shoot ya down  
Hes got evil in his eyes got a reason to despise  
Theres danger in the air  
  
Can you feel it in the air  
Danger Such a strange emotion  
Can you feel it in the air  
  
Oh he was locked inside a room without a door  
His innocence he suffered for  
In a world of black and white they were wrong and he was right  
Just looking for a clue its a nightmare come true  
Hes going underground to track that danger down  
Oh Billy why you got that gun  
  
Never give him an even break  
Gettin caught is the chance you take  
It could be your last mistake  
You could be so helpless  
As a bird with a broken wing  
Like a sheep in a lions den  
Gonna fall but you wont know when  
  
You hear footsteps in the night see shadows on the wall  
And the ghastly sound of silence as the mist begins to fall  
Then a scream rang out like thunder but the lightning was too late  
  
As the rain came down on the crimson ground  
It was the hand of fate  
And a crowd of people gathered round but Billy couldnt wait
