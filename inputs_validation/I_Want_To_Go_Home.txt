We sailed on the ship John B my grandfather and me around Nassau town we did
roam  
Drinking all night got into a fight well I feel so homesick I wanna go home  
  
So hoist up the John B sail see how the mainsail sets  
Call for the captain ashore let me go home  
  
Let me go home why dont you let me go home  
Well I feel so homesick I wanna go home  
  
The first mate he got drunk broke up the peoples trunk  
Constable had to come and take him away  
  
Sheriff John Stone why dont you leave me alone  
Well I feel so homesick I wanna go home  
  
Then the cook he caught the fits threw out all of my grits  
Then he took and ate up all of my corn  
  
Let me go home why dont you let me go home  
Well this is the worst trip since I have been born  
  
So hoist up the John B sail
