I lived in your shadow  
I drove your car  
You thought I belonged in your four walls  
I was never your bunny  
I was never never your pet  
When you threw me out the window  
I landed on my feet  
Yeah you threw me out the window  
Like a like a like a cat  
  
Hey mister you can never own me  
I only let you hold me like a cat  
And mister you can never know me  
I only let you stroke me like a like a  
  
You thought Id be purring  
Curled up by your fire  
Dont want to be kept for your desire  
You said I should be happy  
But it only made me sad  
And when you could never tame me  
That made you mad  
No you could never tame me  
Like a like a like a cat  
  
Hey mister you can never own me  
I only let you hold me like a cat  
And mister you can never know me  
I only let you stroke me  
  
You rescued me I didnt want to be saved  
I got tired of your missionary position babe  
  
When you threw me out the window  
I landed on my feet  
Yeah you threw me out the window  
Like like a like a cat  
  
Hey mister you can never own me  
I only let you hold me like a cat  
And mister you can never know me  
  
I only let you stroke me like a cat  
And mister you can never know me  
I only let you hold me like a  
  
No you never can own me  
Like a cat  
No you never can own me  
Like a cat  
No you never can own me  
Like a cat
