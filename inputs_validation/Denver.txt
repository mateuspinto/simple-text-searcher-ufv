The bright lights of Denver  
Were shining like diamonds  
Like ten thousand jewels in the sky  
Where its nobodys business  
Where youre goin or where you came from  
And youve judged by the look in your eye  
She saw him that evening in a tavern in town  
In a quiet little out of the way place  
And they smiled at each other  
As he walked through the door  
And they danced with their smiles on their faces  
And they danced with their smiles on their face
