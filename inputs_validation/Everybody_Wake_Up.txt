Everybody wake up  
If your living with your eyes closed  
See the man with the bomb in his hand  
Everybody wake up  
  
Oh baby its not easy sometimes  
But built these walls  
Ever hide and hide behind them  
Seems we not wait and try and make things right  
Oh I feel like Im crazy sometimes  
  
Everybody wake up  
If your living with your eyes closed  
See the man with the bomb in his hand  
Everybody wake up  
  
I remember the words of a misguided fool  
Do unto others as you want them to do  
Not an eye for an eye is the golden rule  
Just leaves a room full of blind men  
  
  
See the pig dressed in his finest fine  
  
As the daylights sucked with fire  
  
Everybody wake up  
Everybody wake up  
Everybody wake up  
Wake up  
  
Everybody wake up  
If your livin with your eyes closed  
See the man with the bun in his hand  
Everybody wake up
