Walking in the darkness  
Like a predator from the wild  
Looking for those who are gasping  
For the last breath to take them away  
Some to a better place  
Some to a place where  
The fires never stop burning  
You can cry for help  
No one is listening  
Cause everyone is deaf  
From the death that is surrounding them  
No angel takes you home  
No angel takes you to heaven  
But the soul taker comes  
And takes your soul away  
His eyes shines wild fire  
And he s here to take you away  
He s the  
  
Chorus  
Soul taker soul taker  
Soul taker takes your soul  
You gotta be ready
