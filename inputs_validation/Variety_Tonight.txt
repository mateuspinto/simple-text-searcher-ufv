If ever you think you miss the thrill of the chase  
Or just get tired of the same old face  
I can be different honey I can be new  
Want someone else I can be that too  
  
Chorus  
Whoaoh gonna make you feel right  
Honey if you want it variety tonight  
Whoaoh gonna make you feel right  
Honey you got it variety tonight  
  
The faces of love have their smiles and frowns  
And every romance has its ups and downs  
There are cases when love has been less than sweet  
Love without hate is a little like light without heat  
  
Chorus  
  
And the fire will fade if you forget it  
Cause love cant live unless you let it  
Whoa you gotta try just a little harder with the passin days  
You got to find some new ways ow  
  
Chorus
