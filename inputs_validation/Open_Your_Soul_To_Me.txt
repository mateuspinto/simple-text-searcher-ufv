Open your soul to me  
Open your soul to me  
Open your soul to me  
If we dont open our souls to each other  
Theres nothing in between us  
  
All the years of living  
All the years of talking  
All the years of sharing the space  
If we dont open our souls to each other  
Theres nothing in between us  
  
I remember your eyes  
Reflecting the skies  
Waiting for the boat to come  
Waiting for the boat  
  
Writing the script of life  
Playing the guessing game  
Hurting from love and fear  
If we dont open our souls to each other  
Theres nothing in between us  
  
Some day when your boat is here  
And youre way out there  
You may remember the summer clouds  
And that I tried to reach you
