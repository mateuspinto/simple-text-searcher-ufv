Like most babies smell like butter  
His smell smelled like no other  
He was born scentless and senseless  
He was born a scentless apprentice  
  
Go away  get away get away get away  
Every wet nurse refused to feed him  
Electrolytes smell like semen  
  
I promise not to sell your perfumed secrets  
There are countless formulas for pressing flowers  
  
I lie in the soll and fertilize mushrooms  
Leaking out gas fumes are made into perfume  
  
You cant fire me because I quit  
Throw me in the fire and I wont throw a fit
