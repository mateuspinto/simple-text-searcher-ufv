Working weeks come to its end  
Party time is here again  
Everyone can come if they want to  
If you want to be with me  
If you want to be with me  
You can come with me if you want to  
  
Exercise your basic right  
We could build a building site  
From the bricks of shame is built the hope  
If you want to be with me  
If you want to be with me  
Even though you may still not want to  
  
Let tomorrow and today  
Bring a life of ecstasy  
Wipe away your tears of confusion  
If you want to be with me  
If you want to be with me  
You can come with me if you want to  
Even though you still may not want to
