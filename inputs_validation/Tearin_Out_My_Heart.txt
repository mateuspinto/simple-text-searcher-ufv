First time I saw your face  
By your side was the place  
That I would wanna be  
Sometimes and I dont know why  
Love can come or it can pass you by  
Now you take all the love you gave to me  
you take it from me  
Youre tearin out my heart  
Oh  
Never thought Id see the day  
You would throw my love away  
And oh its killing me  
One thing youll never know  
How it hurts to let you go  
As you turn and walk away from me  
walk away  
Youre tearin out my heart  
Feel like I been ripped apart  
Youre tearin out my heart  
  
Daybreaks I try to be free  
But your memory is haunting me  
Oh  theres nothing I can do  
All alone in the candlelight  
I see your face again tonight  
And I feel all the emptiness without you  
without you tearin out my heart  
Oh I feel like I been ripped apart  
Tearin out my heart  
Whoa my heart
