Am I the queen up your sleeve  
When you got no ace  
Am I a slap in your face  
Am I the boy in your bed  
When youre feeling down  
Am I your living dead  
  
Would you die for me  
  
It doesnt have to be like this  
No  
Feed you with a kiss  
Oh no  
It doesnt have to be like this  
No  
Feed you with a kiss  
  
Am I the queen up your sleeve  
When you got no ace  
Am I a slap in your face  
Am I a thought in your head  
That I keep away from you  
Cause it frightens me  
  
But you  
Gotta step away from it  
Step away from all of it  
Gotta step away from it  
Step away from all of this shit
