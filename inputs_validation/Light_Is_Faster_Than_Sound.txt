Light is faster than sound  
My head to the ground  
Mind going round  
Faster than sound  
What goes up must go down  
World goes around  
Sun shines around  
Faster than sound  
Suddenly I see your face  
Faster than sound  
Through the emptiness of space  
Faster than sound  
Youre turning my mind all around  
Faster than sound  
Cause life is faster than sound  
Faster than sound  
Faster than sound  
Light is faster than sound  
My head to the ground  
Mind going round  
Faster than sound  
What goes up must go down  
World goes around  
Sun shines around  
Faster than sound  
Whoa suddenly I see your face  
Faster than sound  
Through the emptiness of space  
Faster than sound  
Youre turning my mind all around  
Faster than sound  
Cause life is faster than sound  
Faster than sound  
Faster than sound
