There are strange things happening every day  
I hear music up above my head  
Fill me up with your wonder  
Give me my rapture today  
  
Let me contemplate the presence so divine  
Let me sing all day and never get tired  
Fill me up from your loving cup  
Give me my rapture  
  
Wont you guide me through the dark night of the soul  
That I may better understand your way  
Let me be just and worthy to receive  
All the blessings of the Lord into my life  
  
Let me purify my thoughts and words and deeds  
That I may be a vehicle for thee  
Let me hold to the truth in the darkest hour  
Le me sing to the glory of the Lord  
Give me my rapture today  
  
Let me purify my thoughts and words and deeds  
That I may be a vehicle for thee  
Let me hold to the truth in the darkest hour  
Le me sing to the glory of the Lord  
Give me my rapture today
