Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
October 18th 74 the year I was born  
A young nigga ready for war  
Its in my blood to get the fetty for sure  
I was cursed since birth to get the patties slanging faggats are raw  
And Im the advocate crack head in 86 we started having shit  
Rock it and cook it to cut the baggin is when crackages  
For my cousin making twenty off a note  
But I refused to go broke my whole family slang dope  
And my big sister was a little richer cause she always fucked  
Around with the big pushers  
I watched niggaz break keys in sinks with jackhammers and ginsus  
Throw me money for tennis shoes  
I been a dude since high school with latest clothes and them jewels  
Had me paper chasing I didnt finish school  
I bought a quarter ounce in the ooze  
Got a crew hit the block start hustling like the real niggaz do  
Im walking in the shoes of Phoenix Mitchell  
And Little D Im balling niggaz from my projects I listened to  
I keep it real with my interviews  
I was broke as fuck and sleeping on the floor in the village dude  
Im just a wise G why chronic D smoking finer weed  
Thick as quarter peak I build a dynasty  
So a pistol whip and rob niggaz  
What goes around comes around cause I end up getting shot nigga  
But got love not my hope dont stop I pop bubbly  
Like the whole block locked I live lovely  
And my father was a black gorilla family crack dealer  
With the house on Icula made scratch for realla  
Thats why I say its in my blood cause my father was a thug  
With the Columbian blood flood the block with drugs nigga  
We slang lots of coca with glocks up in the hosta  
La Costra Nostra nigga
