Little months little smokes  
And oblivion in a wool dress  
In a door opens tenderly  
Near a wall where the wind is born  
Near the jolly garden  
Where saints and angels  
Are afraid of the seasons  
The alleys have no names  
They are the hours or the years  
I stroll leisurely  
Dressed in a cement overcoat  
And a hat of black straw  
I dont remember  
If its nice out  
I walk smoking  
And I smoke walking  
Easily  
Every once in a while I tell myself  
Its time to stop  
And I continue walking  
I tell myself  
I have to get some air  
I have to look at the clouds  
And breathe in a lung full  
I have to see the flies fly  
And take a little exercise  
I shouldnt smoke so much  
I tell myself also  
Calculate  
I tell myself again  
I have a headache  
My life is a drop of water on my eyelid  
And Im no longer twenty  
Continue  
The songs are songs  
And the days days  
I no longer have one shred of respect for myself  
But I see no hoodlums  
Who smoke the same cigarettes as me  
And who are just as stupid as me  
Im pretty content  
Without really knowing why  
It doesnt suffice to speak of the sun  
The stars  
The sea and rivers  
Blood eyes hands  
It is necessary quite often  
To speak of other things  
We know that there are very beautiful countries  
With very handsome men  
With no less charming women  
But all that isnt really sufficient  
But dizzying void  
Which rings and bays  
Makes the head bow  
We look and we see  
Again many other things  
Which are always the same  
Innumerable  
Identical  
And over there simply  
Someone goes by  
Simple as hello  
And everything starts all over once again  
I read in the stars the good will of my friends  
In a river I love one hand  
I listen the flowers sing  
There are the goodbyes of birds  
A cry falls like a fruit  
My God my God  
I will be accordingly always the same  
My head in my hands  
And my hands in my head
