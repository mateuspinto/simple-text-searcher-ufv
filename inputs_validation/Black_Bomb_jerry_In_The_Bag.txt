Taking over assisting with my revelation  
Empty spaces as if it was an invitation  
Your invasion exceeding every expectation  
Now I feed from the many mouths of your persuasion  
Resurrection infection as I fade away  
Theres no fear there is nothing left to make me stay  
Fitting in my new skin just tell me what to do  
Im defined I am blind I am a part of you  
Big black bomb attack  
Break down resist us fight back  
Big black bomb attack  
Break down resist us fight back  
Big black bomb attack  
Break down resist us fight back  
Big black bomb attack  
Break down resist us fight back  
Big black bomb attack  
Break down resist us fight back  
Big black bomb attack  
Break down resist us fight back  
Big black bomb attack  
Break down resist us fight back  
Big black bomb attack  
Break down resist us fight back  
Big black bomb attack  
Break down resist us fight back  
Big black bomb attack  
Break down resist us fight back  
Now I am a part of you attack  
Now I am a part of you resist us fight back  
Now I am a part of you attack  
Now I am a part of you resist us fight back
