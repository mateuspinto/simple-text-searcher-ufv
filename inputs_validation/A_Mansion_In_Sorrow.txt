Mansion in sorrow mansion in the dark  
Maybe tomorrow the Devils mark  
  
The gates were locked from the inside  
And Abigail was sure to die  
Then Little One went straight through her body  
And the gates they opened wide  
And Little One went up the stairs to the old oak door  
  
Mansion in sorrow mansion in the dark  
Maybe tomorrow the Devils mark  
  
Solo Mike  
  
Mansion in sorrow mansion in the dark  
Maybe tomorrow the Devils mark  
  
Lightning was striking the trees all around  
Abigail still in shock awoken by the sound  
  
Run better run run better run after Little One  
Run better run run after Little One  
But Little One had gone gone to the beyond  
Mansion in sorrow mansion in the dark  
  
Solo Andy  
  
Suddenly the door was open Where have you been my dear  
Im Brandon Henry and I serve the master here  
  
Through a maze of gloomy hallways and candles black  
Safe from the storm she followed the man with the shaven head  
They went into a room that was like a shrine  
Jewellry and dresses too in cabinets made of glass  
Portraits on the walls 18 in all  
A strong scent of old perfume and then there was THE HAIR  
  
Long black lifeless hair
