Therell be peace in the valley for him how we pray  
  
I was with Red Foley the night he passed away  
  
We was down in Port Wayne Indiana the night the Lord took Red away  
  
And we had to get there a little early cause we had a matinee  
  
And when Red first went on stage it seemed that he moved and talked a little
slow  
  
But of course he went on to do his regular great show  
  
So soon the afternoon show was over with and we all went down the street and
ate  
  
Red said he wasnt very hungry but he came along anyway  
  
And we got done eaten and came back to the last show  
  
But the thing just would be Reds very last well whos to know  
  
And when he went on the stage for his own ten thousandth time  
  
We was all back to the curtains there just shootin the lines  
  
But when he sang Peace In The Valley there was such a quiet still  
  
I know Ill never forget it and anyone that was there never will  
  
Well soon the last show was over with  
  
And I went back to the hotel and Red gave me a call  
  
I told him to come on over I was just starin at the four walls  
  
So he came over to my room he was just next door there  
  
Lit a cigarette and sat down in the chair  
  
And he started talkin bout all the worries that a country music singer has  
  
I said old Red I reckon its not that bad  
  
He said yeah youre workin a lot now and youll have em some day  
  
Your dad had em and I have em I guess its just meant that way  
  
Then he got up and these were the last words he said  
  
Im awful tired now Hank and Ive got to go to bed  
  
And while I layed there with Red just a few steps away  
  
The angels came and took him into the last golden stage  
  
Therell be peace in the valley for him how we pray  
  
I was with Red Foley the night he passed away
