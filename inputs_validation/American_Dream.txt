I beg your pardon momma  
What did you say  
My mind was drifted off on Martinique Bay  
Its not that Im not interested you see  
Augusta Georgia is just no place to be  
  
I think Jamaican in the moonlight  
Sandy beaches drinkin rum every night  
We got no money momma but we can go  
Well split the difference go to Coconut Grove  
  
Keep on talkin momma I cant hear  
Your voice it tickles down inside of my ear  
I feel a tropical vacation this year  
Might be the answer to this hillbilly beer  
  
I think Jamaican in the moonlight  
Sandy beaches drinkin rum every night  
We got no money momma but we can go  
Well split the difference go to Coconut Grove  
  
Voila An American Dream  
Well we can travel girl without any means  
When its as easy as closin your eyes  
And dream Jamaica is a big neon sign  
  
Just keep talkin momma I like that sound  
It goes so easy with that rain fallin down  
I think a tropical vacation this year  
Might be the answer to this hillbilly beer and  
  
Voila An American Dream  
Yeah we can travel girl without any means  
When its as easy as closin your eyes  
And dream Jamaica is a big neon sign  
  
Just think Jamaican in the moonlight  
Sandy beaches drinkin rum every night  
We got no money momma but we can go  
Split the difference go to Coconut Grove
