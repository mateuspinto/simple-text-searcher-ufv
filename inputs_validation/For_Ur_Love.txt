Ill wait for you  
Til you come home  
Here out alone  
I stay all over your love  
  
For your love  
For your love  
For your love  
For your love  
For your love  
For your love  
  
With my pimp cup down  
Nothing lost nothing found  
Is the things that you do  
That makes me love you  
Turn aroud and thump thump  
Thats what I want you to do  
Even when I want you  
I hope you want me too  
  
Ill wait for you  
Til you come home  
Here out alone  
I stay all over your love  
  
For your love  
For your love  
For your love  
For your love  
For your love  
For your love  
  
And know what Ima do now  
Ima keep you around  
I like your teeth when you smile  
And your bootys like wild  
So turn around and thump thump  
Or I jump in your trunk  
I reeli reeli want you  
I hope you want me too  
  
Ill wait for you  
Til you come home  
Here out alone Im here Im here Im here  
I stay all over your love  
  
For your love  
For your love  
For your love  
For your love  
For your love
