Broken the seems burst in a rush  
A cataclysmic horror story pens its lust  
Collision makes a call to change a certain path  
Full disbelief takes its hold  
Delay the wrath  
Delay wrath  
  
This is for the lost  
This is for the fallen  
You will remain in my world until I rest  
  
This unrelenting test  
The sting of memories  
Has chased the shadow dark  
To chase them long enough  
Would end in certain death  
No longer solid ground  
Now grayed the autumn leaf  
A barren road  
  
Upon the pages of our path  
Bringing great calamity  
Contagious this loss will surely ruin  
Theres great calamity ahead  
  
This is for the lost  
This is for the fallen  
For youll remain in my world until I rest  
  
Until I rest  
You will remain
