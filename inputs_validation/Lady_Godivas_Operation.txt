Lady Godiva here dressed so demurely  
Pats the head of another curly haired boy just another toy  
Sick with silence she weeps sincerely  
Saying word that have oh so clearly been said  
So long ago  
Draperies wrapped gently round her shoulder  
Life has made her that much bolder now  
That shes found out how  
Dressed in silk Latin lace and envy  
Pride and joy of the latest penny faire  
Pretty passing care  
Hair today now dipped in the water  
Making love to every poor daughters son  
Isnt it fun  
Now today propping grace with envy  
Lady Godiva peers to see if anyones there  
And hasnt a care  
Doctor is coming the nurse thinks sweetly  
Turning on the machines that neatly pump air  
The body lies bare  
Shaved and hairless what once was screaming  
Now lies silent and almost sleeping  
The brain must have gone away  
Strapped securely to the white table  
Ether caused the body to wither and writhe  
Underneath the white light  
Doctor arrives with knife and baggage  
Sees the growth as just so much cabbage  
That now  
Must be cut away  
Now come the moment of Great Great Decision  
The doctor is making his first incision  
One goes here  one goes there  
The ether tubes leaking says someone whos sloppy  
The patient it seems is not so well sleeping  
The screams echo up the hall  
Dont panic someone give him pentathol instantly  
Doctor removes his blade  
Cagily slow from the brain  
By my count of ten  
The head wont move
