I had a dream I was moving forward  
Floating gently to the sun  
Ive come to see my world rewarded  
A new day has begun  
  
A lost bird caught in mid migration  
Far away to a foreign land  
Offspring of a secret nation  
A new day has begun  
  
Chorus  
I can see the earth below me  
And I can  
Feel it turn  
  
Fog lifts to reveal potential  
For generations prophesied  
Our growth to be exponential  
Our promise finally realized  
  
Chorus  
  
Feel it turn  
Across the sky  
The world it learns  
So must I  
  
Cut steel wired into water  
Fixed link circumnavigate  
Old men see your sons and daughters  
No longer no longer hesitate  
  
ChorusRepeat x2
