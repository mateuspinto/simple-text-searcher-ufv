Fools Die  
The lips of the righteous teaches many  
But fools die for want of wisdom  
The rich mans wealth is in the city  
Vexation of the soul is vanity  
Destruction of the poor is their poverty  
The poor mans wealth is in a holy holy place  
Why do you fight eachother  
Why do you kill your brother  
Then your reward will be the cemetery  
We got to build a better nation  
Clean up clean up Jah creation  
Or there will be no future for you you and me
