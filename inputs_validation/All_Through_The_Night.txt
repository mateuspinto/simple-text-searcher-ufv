Sleep my child and peace attend thee  
All through the night  
Guardian angels God will send thee  
All through the night  
  
Soft the drowsy hours are creeping  
Hill and vale in slumber steeping  
I my loving vigil keeping  
All through the night  
  
While the moon her watch is keeping  
All through the night  
While the weary world is sleeping  
All through the night  
  
Oer thy spirit gently stealing  
Visions of delight revealing  
Breathes a pure and holy feeling  
All through the night
