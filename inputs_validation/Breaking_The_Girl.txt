I am a man  
Cut from the know  
Rarely do friends  
Come and then go  
  
She was a girl  
Soft but estranged  
We were the two  
Our lives rearranged  
  
Feeling so good that day  
A feeling of love that day  
  
Twisting and turning  
Your feelings are burning  
Youre breaking the girl  
She meant you no harm  
  
Think youre so clever  
But now you must sever  
Youre breaking the girl  
He loves no one else  
  
Raised by my dad  
Girl of the day  
He was my man  
That was the way  
  
She was the girl  
Left alone  
Feeling the need  
To make me her home  
  
I dont know what when or why  
The twilight of love had arrived  
  
Twisting and turning  
Your feelings are burning  
Youre breaking the girl  
She meant you no harm  
  
Think youre so clever  
But now you must sever  
Youre breaking the girl  
He loves no one else  
  
Twisting and turning  
Your feelings are burning  
Youre breaking the girl  
She meant you no harm  
  
Think youre so clever  
But now you must sever  
Youre breaking the girl  
He loves no one else
