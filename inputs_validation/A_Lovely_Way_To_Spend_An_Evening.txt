Some like a night at the movies  
Some like a dance or a show  
Some are content with an evening spent  
Home by the radio  
  
Some like to live for the moment  
Some like to just reminisce  
But whenever I have an evening to spend  
Just give me one like this  
  
This is a lovely way to spend an evening  
Cant think of anything Id rather do  
This is a lovely way to spend an evening  
Cant think of anyone as lovely as you  
  
A casual stroll through a garden  
A kiss by a lazy lagoon  
Catching a breath of moonlight  
Humming our favorite tune  
  
This is a lovely way to spend an evening  
I want to save all my nights and spend them with you  
  
Catching a breath of moonlight  
Humming our favorite tune  
  
This is a lovely way to spend an evening  
I want to save all my nights and spend them with you
