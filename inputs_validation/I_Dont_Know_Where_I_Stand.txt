Funny day looking for laughter and finding it there  
Sunny day braiding wild flowers and leaves in my hair  
Picked up a pencil and wrote I love you in my finest hand  
Wanted to send it but I dont know where I stand  
  
Telephone even the sound of your voice is still new  
All alone in California and talking to you  
And feeling too foolish and strange to say the words that I had planned  
I guess its too early cause I dont know where I stand  
  
Crickets call courting their ladies in stardappled green  
Thickets tall until the morning comes up like a dream  
All muted and misty so drowsy now Ill take what sleep I can  
I know that I miss you but I dont know where I stand  
I know that I miss you but I dont know where I stand
