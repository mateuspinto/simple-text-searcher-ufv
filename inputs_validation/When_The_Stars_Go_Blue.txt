Dancin when the stars go blue  
Dancin when the evening fell  
Dancin in your wooden shoes  
In a wedding gown  
  
Dancin out on 7th street  
Dancin through the underground  
Dancin with the marionette  
Are you happy now  
  
Chorus  
Where do you go when youre lonely  
Where do you go when youre blue  
Where do you go when youre lonely  
Ill follow you  
When the stars go blue  
Stars go blue  
Stars go blue  
Stars go blue  
  
Laughin with your pretty mouth  
Laughin with your broken eyes  
Laughin with your lovers tongue  
In a lullaby  
  
Chorus
