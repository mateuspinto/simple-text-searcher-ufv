Your faithfulness never fails  
Your faithfulness everyday  
Youre the same  
  
Unfailing love sets me free  
Unfailing love you lead me  
With your hand  
  
And all I know  
With your arms around me  
Your face is all that I seek  
Your love and grace  
Pick me up and hold me  
You alone are holy  
  
For you alone are great in power  
  
You alone are my strong tower  
And I will lift my heart and soul  
To worship you alone  
  
For you alone are my desire  
You have set my heart on fire  
And I will lift my heart and soul  
To worship you alone  
Worship you alone  
  
And I will follow after you  
For you are my desire  
Oh jesus my heart belongs to you
