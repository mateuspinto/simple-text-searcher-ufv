Whenever I see girls and boys  
Selling lanterns on the streets  
I remember the Child  
In the manger as He sleeps  
  
Wherever there are people  
Giving gifts exchanging cards  
I believe that Christmas  
Is truly in their hearts  
  
Lets light our Christmas trees  
For a bright tomorrow  
Where nations are at peace  
And all are one in God  
  
Lets sing Merry Christmas  
And a happy holiday  
This season may we never forget  
The love we have for Jesus  
Let Him be the One to guide us  
As another new year starts  
And may the spirit of Christmas  
Be always in our hearts  
  
In every prayer and every song  
The community unites  
Celebrating the birth  
Of our Savior Jesus Christ  
  
Let love like that starlight  
On that first Christmas morn  
Lead us back to the manger  
Where Christ the Child was born  
  
So come let us rejoice  
Come and sing a Christmas carol  
With one big joyful voice  
Proclaim the name of the Lord
