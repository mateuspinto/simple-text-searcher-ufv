Go hey lil mama  
I can transform ya  
No I cant dance but I can dance on ya  
Swiss on the beats Chris move ya feet  
And baby I can transform ya him to a me  
I can change you life make it so new  
Make you never want to go back to the old you  
Ciroc and lime give it a lil time  
And she can transform like Optimus Prime  
  
Need a ride I can Range you up  
Money I can change you up  
You can ride your own no longer be the passenger  
Swag low I build you up  
Knees weak Ill stand you up  
Red lips red dress like em like a fire truck  
  
What you need you can have that  
My black card they dont decline that  
See potential in ya  
Let me mold that  
  
Chorus  
I can transform I can transform ya  
I can transform ya

Anything ya want I can get it for ya  
Your my baby girl shoulda know I did it for ya

Bags you got it got it  
Cars you got it got it

Anything you want I can I can get it for ya  
  
See me in the video you can have it really though  
Iced out everything freezing like an Eskimo  
Wanna fly we can go anywhere you wanna go  
Jimmy Choos in Italy Louie V in Tokyo  
  
Something like Pinocchio  
If you lie down Im a grow  
Wanna see me do it big  
I can show you how it goes  
Take you from an amateur to being professional  
I can have you swag surfing  
  
What you need you can have that  
My black card they dont decline that  
See potential in ya  
Let me mold that  
  
Chorus  
  
Shoes you got it got it  
Bags you got it got it  
Cars you got it got it  
Money still got it got it  
I can transform ya I can transform ya  
Anything you want I can I can get it for ya  
  
OK  
I can transform ya like a transformer  
I can turn you from a human to a Carter  
Take you off the bench and turn ya to a starter  
Then take you home and put you on a charger  
Then then my cars transforms to a charter  
And we can fly to wherever you ever thought of  
Hehe I take you to wherever its warmer  
Then I gotta rip off your dress like a warm up  
Hehe but Im just getting warmed up  
So tell your man he better get his voltron up  
I transform her to a Ducati and then I transform me to a Bugatti  
Cos her form puts me in a trance  
I transform smaller and she puts me in her pants  
Swiss on the Beat Chris move ya feet  
Weezy transform a good girl to a freak  
  
I can transform ya  
I can transform ya  
Anything ya want I can get it for ya  
Your my baby girl shoulda know I did it for ya  
I can trans I can trans I can transform ya  
  
Shoes you got it got it  
Bags you got it got it  
Cars you got it got it  
Money still got it got it  
I can transform ya I can transform ya  
Anything you want I can I can get it for ya
