Weve said it all  
A thousand times before  
Been to the wall  
And always found somewhere to turn  
There was always room to learn  
  
Weve reached the end  
And almost closed the door  
And someone went in  
I never can remember who  
All I know is that  
We found the strength to make it through  
  
Chorus  
Love always finds a way  
When the clouds have no silver lining  
He comes through shining  
Love always sees the light  
Through the darkest night  
In a small way  
Love always finds a way  
  
Holding you near  
After the storm has passed  
It becomes clear  
When all our tears have finally dried  
That no matter how  
We fools may try to turn the tide  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
And when those moments  
When the magic seems to fade  
We must remember then  
Thats the time to keep on believing  
And not be afraid  
  
If we both trust  
In what we really feel  
The two of us  
Can hold tomorrow in our hands  
All it takes is just  
The faith to truly understand  
  
Repeat chorus
