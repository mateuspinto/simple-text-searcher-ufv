Love comes and goes  
Destiny unknown  
Leads you to the promised land  
Or leaves you head in hand  
Tears fall like rain  
Coming down once again  
Stranger lost in a distant land  
Language hard to understand  
Seems like years have slipped away  
Still have so much left to say  
And I cant wait to see you  
Chorus When the spirit of love comes to you  
Let it into your heart  
Nows the time to turn away  
From the ghost of yesterday  
When the spirit of love comes to you  
Let it into your heart  
Ill be the one to shelter you  
The spirit of love will guide us through  
Love right or wrong  
Somehow we must carry on  
If only words were spoken true  
If only I could trust in you  
To believe in the dream of what could be  
Hidden clues to the mystery  
Its time to set yourself free  
Chorus  
Let the spirit of love come to you  
Let the spirit of love come to you  
Chorus
