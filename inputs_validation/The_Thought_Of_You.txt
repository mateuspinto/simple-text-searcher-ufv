The thought of you  
Precious and clear  
Drives all the rest  
From out of here  
The thought of you  
Just wont wait  
It rises up  
It elevates  
  
The thought of you  
Heals me again  
Of all the poison  
That lies within  
The thought of you  
Reaches inside  
Takes it away  
Conquers my pride  
  
Just the thought of you  
And time and space and death  
Just dont exist  
Just the thought of you  
And I know  
I need nothing more than this  
  
The thought of you  
Makes me complete  
Wraps all the bandages  
Round my feet  
The thought of you  
Still cracks me up  
Laughs in my face  
Fills up my cup  
  
The thought of you  
Sustains me still  
And evermore  
Oh It always will  
Oh it always will
