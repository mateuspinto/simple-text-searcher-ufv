No more lying friends  
Wanting tragic ends  
Though they do pretend  
They wont go when I go  
  
All those bleeding hearts  
With sorrows to impart  
Were right here from the start  
And they wont go when I go  
  
And Ill go where Ive longed  
To go so long  
Away from tears  
  
Gone from painful cries  
Away from saddened eyes  
Along with them Ill bide  
Because they wont go when I go  
  
Big men feeling small  
Weak ones standing tall  
I will watch them fall  
They wont go when I go  
  
And Ill go where Ive long  
To go so long  
Away from tears  
  
Unclean minds mislead the pure  
The innocent will leave for sure  
For them there is a resting place  
People sinning just for fun  
They will never see the sun  
For they can never show their faces  
There aint no room for the hopeless sinner  
Who will take more then he will give  
He aint hardly gonna give  
  
The greed of man will be  
Far away from me  
And my soul will be free  
They wont go when I go  
  
Since my soul conceived  
All that I believe  
The kingdom I will see  
cause they wont go when I go  
  
When I go  
Where Ill go  
No one can keep me  
From my destiny
