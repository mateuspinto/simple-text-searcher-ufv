Your shirt is stained when you wear your heart on your sleeve  
So you wash it off and pretend that it was never there  
Your face in the mirror doesnt give a reflection  
So you paint one on its the art of imitation  
It tickles you to death knowing you can play the game so well  
But you cant ignore dont know who you are so what  
Your sugar coated guns are loaded  
Afraid of tasting yourself  
So you keep lying never trying  
Say your somebody else  
The bitterness inside your heart  
It shows through in your eyes  
And you cant win in the end  
You take your big guns loading them with your fatal charm  
The fact is you love me nothing can kill me now  
Ive learned the power of deceit the power of the sweet is so true  
Now Im a confection to taste good is all I must do  
Your sugar coated guns are loaded  
Afraid of tasting yourself  
So you keep lying never trying  
Say your somebody else  
Its too easy to get to where you  
Take it dig it every day  
And you cant win in the end  
The bitterness inside your heart  
It shows through in your eyes  
And you cant win in the end
