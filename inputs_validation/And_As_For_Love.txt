That I denied one time too many  
She left me at the break of day  
When I awoke she seemed still spinning in my head  
But she was gone the capsule empty and her body dead  
Was all shed left behind without a last adieu  
Sometimes I wonder if shed left a hundred years ago  
To start anew we need to be strangers from now on  
And as for love we need to be strangers from now on  
  
And I remember when she came into my life  
It didnt count who she was or what I was like  
I never meant to hurt her but she never did  
Her name was love her bodies infinite  
And now she is gone the capsule empty and her body dead  
Sometimes I wonder if shed left a hundred years ago  
To start anew we need to be strangers from now on  
And as for love we need to be strangers from now on
