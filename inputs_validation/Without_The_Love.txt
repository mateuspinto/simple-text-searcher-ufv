You pull my strings and push my soul  
You fool my heart with every note  
You drop a beat and kiss my face  
You make me move then cut the base  
  
And you work so hard to get me just to let me go  
Yeah you put me in the spotlight just to steal the show  
And you try to take me home like youre DiMaggio  
Oh oh oh its such a joke  
  
Why are you singing me love songs  
What good is a love song  
What good is a love song without the love  
Why are you singing me love songs  
What good is a love song  
What good is a love song without the love  
Why are we acting like lovers  
We dont know each other  
Even though we used to rule the world  
Why are you singing me love songs  
What good is a love song  
A love song without the love  
  
Youre so confused its getting old  
You wear your ring but leave me cold  
Youre beautiful but cause me pain  
You played my heart like its a game  
  
And you work so hard to get me just to let me go  
Yeah you put me in the spotlight just to steal the show  
And you try to take me home like youre DiMaggio  
Oh oh oh its criminal  
  
Why are you singing me love songs  
What good is a love song  
What good is a love song without the love  
Why are you singing me love songs  
What good is a love song  
What good is a love song without the love  
Why are we acting like lovers  
We dont know each other  
Even though we used to rule the world  
Why are you singing me love songs  
What good is a love song  
A love song without the love  
  
This is the bend before the break  
When we forget the harmony  
This is how water colors fade  
Into distant memories  
  
Why are you singing me love songs  
What good is a love song  
What good is a love song without the love  
Why are you singing me love songs  
What good is a love song  
What good is a love song without the love  
Why are we acting like lovers  
We dont know each other  
Even though we used to rule the world  
Why are you singing me love songs  
What good is a love song  
A love song without the love  
  
Ooh Without the love  
Ooh Without the love  
Ooh Without the love  
Ooh Without the love
