I think I just recalled a time  
It was not the moon and not the wine  
And though you said you were a friend of mine  
I never felt that way inclined  
Oh the days were hot and the nights were long  
I must have sung a million songs  
But all the words just came out wrong  
On the last day of summer  
  
I tried to walk the line  
Hoped everything would turn out fine  
But I think I fell in love that time  
On the last day  
And then the rain came down and  
Sparkled the signs of the underground  
And the darkness fell all over town  
On the last day  
  
I think I dropped my guard that time  
I was flesh and blood and grit and slime  
And I think I may have lost my mind  
On the last day of summer  
I think I fell in love back there  
It was tooth and nail it was bones and hair  
And youll never never know how much I cared  
On the last day of summer  
  
And though I think I fell that time  
It was not the only fault of mine  
But all I wanted was a sign  
On the last day  
I think you broke my heart that day  
And nothing I could do or say  
Could make the coldness go away  
On the last day  
  
The winter changes everything  
And the raindrops freeze  
On the signs of the underground  
I wonder will you think of me  
When you look up and see  
Theres a full moon over London Town  
  
I think I was away the day  
When you said you were too smart to play  
And youd only beat me anyway  
Its funny how I would have stayed  
And you said you were a friend of mine  
But thats not what I had in mind  
I think I fell in love that time  
On the last day of summer  
  
I tried to walk the line   
Hoped everything would turn out fine
