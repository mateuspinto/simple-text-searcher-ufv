Too many nights of isolation  
Too many echoes in my head  
Too many fires left burning  
In this bed  
Too many thoughts of desperation  
So much pain deep down below  
So mych a slave to my senses  
I cant let go  
From moment to moment  
I live and I die  
This cant go on anymore  
Another day another lie  
From moment to moment  
I stand and I fall  
This cant go on anymore  
Unless we both give it all  
I ask you how can a man keep his distance  
How can he reason with his heart  
How can you hold me so near  
Yet keep me so far  
From moment to moment  
I live and I die  
This cant go on anymore  
Another day another lie  
From moment to moment  
I stand and I fall  
This cant go on anymore  
Unless we both give it all  
Sometimes Id like to break you down  
To see if theres a trace of woman in you that could be found  
But I just keep prayin youll come around  
And live from moment to moment  
I live from moment to moment  
I live from moment to moment  
So much a slave to my senses  
I cant let go  
From moment to moment  
I live and I die  
This cant go on anymore  
Another day another lie  
From moment to moment  
I stand and I fall  
This cant go on anymore  
Unless we both give it all  
You know I want to give it all  
I live from moment to moment  
Everyday of my life  
I live from moment to moment
