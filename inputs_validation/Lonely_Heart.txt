Heart beat pounding so hard it keeps me wide awake at night  
I wait alone in the dark for you to make the moment right  
If I could only show you all that might be lost  
Then you would never wonder what the secret was  
And this is what Id tell you  
  
The lonely heart you see tonight  
Will not give up without a fight  
And Im never gonna let it fade away  
  
Oh you can look in my eyes and see that youre the only one  
I would break down and cry if you became the lonely one  
Id rather play the fool and try to hold a star  
Than never know if you were going to break my heart  
And I can see it shining  
  
No matter what I say to make you understand  
Its all up to you to take the future in your hands  
So please dont keep me waiting
