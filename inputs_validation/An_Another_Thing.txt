Rain for me oh you but called me  
Its my broken heart just where you leave me  
Now I say to you ooooh boy  
  
Weight on my head  
You wont go up oh  
Weight on my head  
Oooh ooh my babe  
  
Stay a minute just to hear you waitin  
And no one confine her  
Sweet and tender wont you go out again  
  
Oh rain on my head  
Wouldnt you  
Rain on my head  
Oh someone take off a  
Weight all alone  
  
Ahh I met a girl recently  
All in a sudden all a suddenly  
Nobody deal for the woe of the world  
Wait all a sudden all a suddenly  
It will all would be all would be over  
  
Wait come on rain on my head  
Water water  
  
Dates  
Many many dates how you all die  
  
Oh rain money  
Grow a war at heart  
And in the fire  
One out of a million  
  
 wait a minute  
Touch your look on me  
Denial denial  
Touch your work with me  
Do not deny  
Rain on my head  
Rain on my head  
Rain on my head  
Rain on my head
