Six super star destroyers landing in the east  
They plan to form a wall then push us to the sea  
We deployed our forces moving to attack  
Those who see their eyes never answer back  
  
Call the high commander  
Tell him of the siege were under  
Were ready to roll were ready to roll  
Were ready to roll get ready to rock  
  
Missile silo doors are opened coordinates are placed  
Six billion tons of power thrown back into their face  
One blinding blast of light after that we see  
Their huge electric eyes staring back at me  
  
Prepare the thunder thruster  
Ultrasonic molecule buster  
Get ready to roll get ready to roll  
Get ready to roll get ready to rock  
  
They went to a hill on the shore and assembled the gun  
To do a thing that before no one had done  
Now we sit and we wait we have nowhere to run  
We see their lights through the night turn the thunder thruster on  
  
With a sonic boom the waves of sound are thrust  
Upon our enemies it shatters them to dust  
No one left to battle ships pools of molten lead  
But our worlds destroyed who knows how many dead  
  
Turn off the thunder thruster  
Dig a hole and put it under  
Never to rock never to rock  
Never to rock never to rock  
Rock rock rock roll
