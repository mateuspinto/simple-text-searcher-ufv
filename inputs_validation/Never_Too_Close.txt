I remember when best friends were jealous lovers  
Lyin warm asleep beneath the covers  
Dreaming of belonging to each other  
And so we tried never too close  
Never too near dyin in time  
And so we cried but that is alright  
We meant no one no harm  
  
I remember when best friends were no mistaken  
Long before that freedom was forsaken  
Learnin bout all the good things  
In the world worth believin  
And so we tried never too close  
Never too near dyin in time  
And so we cried but that is alright  
We meant no one no harm  
  
I remember when jealous lovers would stick together  
When the days were warm and the nights more tender  
When the bonds of truth were not made to measure  
And so we tried never too close  
Never too near dyin in time  
And so we cried but that is alright  
We meant no one no harm  
Try try as you will  
Following dreams never fulfilled  
And so we cried but that is alright  
We meant no one no harm
