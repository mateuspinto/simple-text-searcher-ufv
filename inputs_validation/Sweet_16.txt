Bring me back to an hour ago  
Time stands still as the years go by  
Browneyed girl thats throwing down a bottle of Old English  
Back in the warehouse  
  
Old days are fine but are left so far behind  
From California to Jane Street  
Kids alright alright as theyll ever be  
  
Cause you will always be my  
Well you will always by my  
You will always be my sweet 16  
  
Sleep on the floor on cardboard  
Stab out my heart like a dartboard  
Brownskinned girl I had a dream about a long long time now  
From the Midwest to the beach  
  
Old days are fine but are left so far behind  
From California to Jane Street  
Kids alright alright as theyll ever be  
  
Cause you will always be my  
Well you will always by my  
You will always be my sweet 16
