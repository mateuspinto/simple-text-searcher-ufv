Only you San Damiano  
Lady of the roses own  
Only you San Damiano  
Far from here but close to home  
  
I want you to go same as me  
I want you to know all I see  
  
All corners of the world a message to be heard  
With heart and soul heart and soul  
  
Only you San Damiano  
Lady of the roses own  
Only you San Damiano  
Far from here but close to home  
  
Oh tranquillity all around  
Peace and mystery to be found  
  
Travel the world and still can other places fill  
Your heart and soul heart and soul  
  
Only you San Damiano  
Lady of the roses own  
Only you San Damiano  
Far from here but close to home  
  
Corner of paradise a golden chain has tied us  
Heart and soul heart and soul  
  
Only you San Damiano  
Lady of the Roses own  
Only you San Damiano  
Far from here but close to home
