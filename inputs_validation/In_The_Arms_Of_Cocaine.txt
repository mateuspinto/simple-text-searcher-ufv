Some ladies love diamonds  
Fast cars and freedom  
Trips to the island  
Castles in Spain  
Las Vegas card sharks  
Blues men that blow french harps  
But no strings to her heart  
Just the arms of cocaine  
  
Yeah she likes to run  
With us high riding cowboys  
She says she feels a whole lot  
More at home on the range  
She can handle her feelings  
In most all situations  
She just can not handle  
The arms of cocaine  
  
Hey Im just a rhymer  
Writing down new phrases  
Looking for ladies  
Who know Im subject to change  
Content to believing  
The songs I am singing  
Help her find her feelings  
Help her break the chains of cocaine  
  
Oh my lady is special  
Shes into my kind of music  
She likes Jim Beam and water  
Instead of champange  
I like Levis and leathers  
Making love together  
No more stormy weather  
Since she broke the chains of cocaine  
  
No more stormy weather  
Since she broke the chains of cocaine
