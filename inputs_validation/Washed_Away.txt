Fill me with your joy so new  
So I can show my love for You  
This joy I have is real and true  
For all my sins are washed away  
Yes all my sins are washed away  
  
The pain I felt so deep inside  
The tears I could no longer hide  
Theres joy now cause Youre by my side  
Yes all my sins are washed away  
Yes all my sins are washed away  
  
Washed away  
Gone astray  
  
For all my sins are washed away  
Yes all my sins are washed away
