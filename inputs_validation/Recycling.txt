If you meet a long forgotten friend  
And he takes you in his arms and smiles  
And he tells you long forgotten tales  
And he takes you home for a nightride  
And he begs you please stay here with me  
In the end you agree  
Remember youre just being recycled  
  
So everything you say  
Somebody else said it before you  
And everything you do  
Somebody else just did it like you  
And the man in the lab just grins and says  
Holding up a tiny can with a sperm  
Remember youre just being recycled  
  
Montego bay  
  
The air is oh so thick  
Theres not a single breeze  
The day lies dazed upon the shelf  
Beyond a painted window out on a far horizon  
There stands a steamboat in the sun  
  
I rised my eyes and stared into that paralyzing light  
But god had left the iron skies  
This day will last forever we pushed the final buttons  
And someone disconnected time  
  
We are here in montego bay
