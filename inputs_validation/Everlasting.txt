Just to know the love wee got is  
Everlasting and never ending  
Is all I need to keep on givin

Playing the field hoping  
For someone to come into my world  
Someone not afraid to look into my eyes  
  
And make a connection  
Then you walked in my direction  
And from the moment that we touched  
I knew what we found was  
Everlasting what a feeling  
Just to know the love weve got is

Walking down a one way street

Was looking just to have another one night stand  
But through your devotion  
I surrendered my emotion
