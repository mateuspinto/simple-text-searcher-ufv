Out of the street get on home  
Tail shaking filly running on her own  
They say she got loose on the night  
She was born  
Cranking it up in a school zone  
  
Kick it out kick it out she said  
kick out your motor and drive  
While youre still alive kick it out  
  
Sitting in a bar in a seaside town  
Sweet little love getting high getting down  
Sailors see her running along the beach  
Laugh and jump out of reach  
  
Wild music blowing in her mane  
She needs a bareback rider wont give her  
No pain  
A hard racy game of give and take  
Leaves them dazed half crazed in her wake  
  
Kick it out kick it out she said  
kick out your motor and drive  
While youre still alive kick it out
