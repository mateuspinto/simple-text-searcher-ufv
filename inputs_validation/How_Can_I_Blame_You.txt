Verse 1  
I shouldve known when the cop told me Im goin too fast  
He told me  
Speed like that and its bound to be a hell of a crash  
He told me  
Better late than you dont get there do the math  
Oh you oughta be grateful  
For what you have  
  
PreChorus  
Well what if I refuse to learn  
I see a flame I wanna get burned  
  
Chorus  
How can I blame you  
For showin up at the party  
Lookin through me in that way  
Saw somethin inside of me break  
Saw me wanna make a mistake  
How can I blame you  
For takin over my daydreams  
I wanna scream it Im sorry  
But I cant cause Im long overdue  
Oh I wanna blame it on you  
  
Verse 2  
Whys it hard for a man to be satisfied  
Oh I got one glimpse of the green grass on the other side  
Cause its all been comin to this and goddamn I wont be denied  
Oh Im gonna take one more chance tonight  
  
PreChorus  
Oh what if I refuse to learn  
I see the flame grow I gotta get burned

But I cant cause Im long overdue  
Oh I wanna blame it on you  
  
Bridge  
Did I know my weakness  
Did I mount all my defenses  
Did I tell you to leave me alone  
How can I blame you  
You saw somethin inside of me break  
You saw me wanna make a mistake  
  
Chorus  
How can I blame you
