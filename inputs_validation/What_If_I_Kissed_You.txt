Drake  
What if I kissed you right now  
How would we explain it  
Trying to imagine how it might sound  
If I just yelled out  
What if I kissed you right now  
Would it bring us any closer  
Take a weight off our shoulders  
Take me Im yours  
And I dont really care who knows it  
Can you afford to be open with all these emotions  
If you were a secret how long could you keep it  
Lyrics courtesy of wwwkillerhiphopcom  
Keep it to yourself dont tell nobody else  
Not a problem   
And you just be mine  
And you just be mine  
And you just be mine just just be mine  
  
What if I kissed you right now  
Would it bring us any closer  
Take a weight off of our shoulders  
Tell on me  
I dont mind cause if they ask me about it I wont lie  
Admit that Im yours  
I doont really care who knows it  
Can we afford to be that open with all these emotions  
  
If you were a secret how long could you keep it  
Keep it to yourself dont tell nobody else  
Not a problem   
And you just be mine  
And you just be mine  
And you just be mine just just be mine  
  
What if I kissed you right now  
What if I kissed you right now  
  
And you just be mine  
And you just be mine all mine  
And you just be mine just just be mine  
  
What if I kissed you right now  
Enda
