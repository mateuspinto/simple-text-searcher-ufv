She was reading a book that shed already read  
Just to pass the time  
He just sat there and stared at the TV set  
Like he was barely alive  
And when the local news was over  
They would climb the stairs  
And crawl in bed underneath the covers  
Like neither one was there  
  
Its a long long way  
Across the great divide  
The songs that they once sang  
Now echo far and wide  
They could still get back  
All the love that they have lost  
But only if they both will reach across  
Cause its a long long way to the other side  
Of the great divide  
  
He was up in the attic on the fourth of July  
Cause they flew a flag in the yard  
When he found some old roses she had long ago dried  
Before they drifted apart  
And how the years had slipped right by them  
He didnt understand  
He carried a petal into the kitchen  
And he placed it in her hand  
  
Its a long long way  
Across the great divide  
The songs that they once sang  
Now echo far and wide  
They could still get back  
All the love that they have lost  
But only if they both will reach across  
Cause its a long long way to the other side  
Of the great divide
