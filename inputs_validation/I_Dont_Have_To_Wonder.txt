Drove to the church  
In my suit and tie  
But I just couldnt bring myself  
To go inside  
So I sat alone  
In my truck across the street  
Watched that chauffeur smokin cigarettes  
By that long white limousine  
I could just imagine  
What was goin on in there  
Sunlight streamin through the stained glass  
And those flowers in her hair  
And in less time than it takes a tear to fall  
Those bells rang loud as thunder  
As they opened up the doors  
Now I dont have to wonder anymore  
Laughin and a cryin  
Tossin that bouquet  
And when you got in that limo  
I drove off the other way  
And I still dont know  
Why things happened like they did  
But I parked that old pickup  
On that lonesome river bridge  
I took your ring from my pocket  
And I held it one last time  
Watched that diamond sparkle  
I drew back and I let her fly  
And in less time than it takes to tear to fall  
Oh that old ring went under  
Lord and now its gone for sure  
No and I dont have to wonder anymore  
Well the angels sang like thunder  
As I felt myself go under  
Now I dont have to wonder anymore
