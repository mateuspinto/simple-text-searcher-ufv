Well I just got back from the liquer store  
I bought you some pink champaigne  
Its early afternoon so why dont you  
Come over and model these things  
I forgot to you I stopped at that little  
Loungerie shop in the mall  
And the girls showed me this  
The girls showed me that  
And baby I bought em all  
  
Now you can put on this garter belt  
Wear this hot little dress  
No it doesnt leave much for imagination  
But it shows off your assets  
I can fix us a drink while you slip into these things  
And Ill meet you in the bar at nine  
Yuo make me wanna fantasy  
Ive got a dirty mind  
  
AbYes its true Ive got a dirty mind  
But I saw you enjoy it too all those men giving you the eye  
You women are trying to keep us men turned on all the time  
We hope you never quit cause were enjoying it  
Weve all got dirty minds  
  
Now dont you tell me Im a dirty devil through and through  
Sittin there with your dress hiked up  
All those legs and hose and shoes  
I heard about your last party so dont you be judging me  
You junped up on the table did a slow strip  
Girl your as bad as me  
Repeat3  
I need a night of counseling to get my mind off of these things  
Ive got a dirty nasty rotten normal mind
