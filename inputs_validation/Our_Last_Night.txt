Spoken  
My names Taylor Swift  
This is a cover song Im gonna sing for you  
By one of my favorite bands called Better Than Ezra  
And its the song called Our Last Night  
We were standing in an empty room  
The moonlight was falling  
You were holding my hand when the car pulled up for you  
And I could have spent a life with you  
But those days were over  
You were calling my name when your face faded from view  
And wasnt it you who told me the sun would always chase the day  
And wasnt it you who told me  
Angels fly in the air tonight  
Saying wasnt it just like swimming out on the lake  
And stars collide and the airs alive  
Or was it just like those promises that you made  
On our last night  
I remember waking up with you  
The days doing nothing  
You meant more to me then than I think you ever knew  
But you were gonna be a doctor movie star  
A poet at a Nobel seminar  
I hope the world never tore that out of you  
Cause wasnt it you who told me the sun would always chase the day  
Yeah wasnt it you who told me  
Angels fly in the air tonight  
Saying wasnt it just like swimming out on the lake  
And stars collide and the airs alive  
Or was it just like those promises that you made  
On our last night  
And what ever happened to the things you loved  
And the songs we played and the indian days  
Whatever happened to the things you gave away  
Like Harold and Maude and singing  
I was waving as you drove away  
The sunlight was falling  
You were writing backwards in a dusty window pane  
Angels fly in the air tonight  
And wasnt it just like swimming out on the lake  
Oh oh yeah  
And stars collide and the airs alive  
Or was it just like those promises that you made  
On our last night  
On our last night  
Oh oh oh oh oh
