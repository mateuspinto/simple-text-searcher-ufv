Long distance information  
Give me Memphis Tennessee  
Try to find the party  
Trying to get in touch with me  
She would not leave her number  
But I know who placed the call  
Cos my uncle took the message  
And he wrote it on the wall  
  
Help me information  
Get in touch with my Marie  
Shes the only one whod phone me here  
From Memphis Tennessee  
Her home is on the south side  
Just beyond the ridge  
Just a half a mile  
From the Mississippi Bridge  
  
Help me information  
More than that I cannot add  
Only that I miss her  
And all the fun we had  
We were pulled apart  
Because her mom would not agree  
Help me get in touch with her  
In Memphis Tennessee  
  
The last time I saw Marie  
She was waving me goodbye  
With hurry homedrops on her cheek  
That trickled from her eyes  
Marie is only six years old  
Information please  
Help me get in touch with her  
In Memphis Tennessee
