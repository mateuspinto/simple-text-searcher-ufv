I am only human  
But not everything you say is true  
So then again  
Do my secrets come to an end  
Like the way I see you  
Catching snakes in the sand  
Like the way I saw you  
Catching snakes in the sand  
  
Out on the bridge  
I thought I saw you  
Somewhere between now and never  
So do my secrets come to an end  
Like the way I see you  
Catching snakes in the sand  
Like the way I saw you  
Catching snakes in the sand  
  
Take me home  
Cause theres no other place  
Id rather be  
Take me back home  
Cause theres no other place  
Take me back to where all my secrets end  
The way you were catching snakes in the sand  
  
I am only human  
But not everything you say is true  
So then again  
Do my secrets come to an end  
Like the way I see you  
Catching snakes in the sand  
Like the way I saw you  
Catching snakes in the sand
