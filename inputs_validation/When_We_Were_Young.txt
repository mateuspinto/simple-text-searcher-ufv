We used to never say never  
Used to think wed live forever  
Flying free beneath the sun  
  
Days go running and hiding  
The weeks go slipping and sliding  
Years leave quicker every time they come  
Remember when we were young  
  
Look back to the best of days  
Collecting our yesterdays  
As they build up one by one  
  
Oh how we beg and we borrow  
Say well do it tomorrow  
But tomorrow never seems to come  
  
We used to never say never  
Used to think wed live forever  
Flying free beneath the sun  
  
Days go running and hiding  
The weeks go slipping and sliding  
Years leave quicker every time they come  
Remember when we were young  
  
And we were boys on the beach  
Everything was in reach  
I know its hard to remember  
  
But oh how the years they vanish  
I always wanted to learn Spanish  
And travel round South America  
  
We used to never say never  
Used to think wed live forever  
Flying free beneath the sun  
  
Days go running and hiding  
The weeks go slipping and sliding  
Years leave quicker every time they come  
  
Remember when we were young x3
