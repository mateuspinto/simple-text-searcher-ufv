Ive been here all your life watching your crying game  
You were the heaven in my lonely world  
And he was your sun and your rain  
I was losing you before I ever held you tight  
Before you ever held me in your arms  
And I wont make you blue  
And maybe an everlasting love will do  
  
Ah we got an everlasting love  
So tall so wide so high above the rumble of thunder down below  
Its your love I need its the only show  
And its you want an everlasting dream  
Can take us anywhere are the tears of yesterday  
We killed the pain  we blew away the memories of the tears we cried  
And an everlasting love will never die  
  
Take me out of the cold  
Give me what Ive hungered for  
If its the pleasure of taking my heart that you need  
Then it only makes me love you more  
I was yours before the stars were born and you were mine  
I could have saved you all the pain you knew  
And I wont make you cry  
And maybe an everlasting love can try  
  
Ah we got an everlasting love  
So tall  so wide so high above the rumble of thunder down below  
Its your love I need its the only show  
And its you want an everlasting dream  
Can take us anywhere are the tears are yesterday  
We killed the pain we blew away the memories of the tears we cried  
And an everlasting love will never die  
  
Ah we got an everlasting love  
So tall  so wide so high above the rumble of thunder down below  
Its your love I need its the only show  
And its you want an everlasting dream  
Can take us anywhere are the tears are yesterday  
We killed the pain we blew away the memories of the tears we cried  
And an everlasting love will never die  
  
Ah we got an everlasting love  
So tall  so wide so high above the rumble of thunder down below  
Its your love I need its the only show  
And its you want an everlasting dream  
Can take us anywhere are the tears are yesterday  
We killed the pain we blew away the memories of the tears we cried  
And an everlasting love will never die
