Ive got money to burn  
Ive got life on the avenue  
Ive got nothing to learn  
I just do what I want to do  
Ive got places to go  
Ive got lines on the telephone  
Ive got nothing to show  
For all this time that I spend alone  
But if I wanted someone someone to care  
And if I needed someone  
Would you be there  
I want to look into your eyes  
Chorus  
And get a feel for your love  
where would I be  
Ive got a feel for your love  
where would I be  
Ive got a feel for your love  
where would I go  
I have something to give  
I got a feeling that I never knew  
I have a reason to live  
And all I want is to be with you  
If I gave you my heart  
Would you take what I have for you  
I have fallen so hard  
And I will do what you want me to  
And now Im wanting someone  
Someone to share  
And if you are that someone  
Will you be there  
So when I look into your eyes  
Chorus
