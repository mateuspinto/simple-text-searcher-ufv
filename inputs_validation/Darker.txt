Verse 1 Gucci Mane  
  
Dark tint on my soowoo red charger  
The niggas round me drink lean not water  
I could never hold a job down like my father  
But I could hold a block and push the rock Shawn Carter  
Bitches on my dick cause my skin real darker  
Got a yellow bitch and The Devil Wears Prada  
Got the narcs on me say my car tail got bothered  
Big fish in little pond get swallowed  
Dark weed super dark weed Cali og  
Dark lean super dark lean straight codeine  
Dark meat pretty brown bitch that adore me  
Dark tint on my dark bent on a dark street  
  
Hook  
  
Verse 2 Gucci Mane  
Its a dark night had a gun fight with a dark clique  
Set up by a dark skin bitch she was dumb thick  
Gucci Mane keep pulling up in darkly painted cars  
Dropped the top on your bitch now she looking at the stars  
Diamonds dancing on my wrist you dancing with the star  
Gucci Mane so geeked up he dont care you light or dark ho  
I just paid 300 cause didnt have nowhere to park ho  
If Gucci Mane just bought why the fuck he paint it darker  
That shit was already hard Now he made it harder  
Cali kush just touched down nigga and this pack a lil darker  
Dog food bricks and cocaina them now they look darker  
Dark skin brick Im touching it and with it whipping away from the water
