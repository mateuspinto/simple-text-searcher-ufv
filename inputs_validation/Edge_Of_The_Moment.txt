Blood red sky fades into blue  
Miss your touch in shadows Im waiting  
Sweet memories of holding you near  
In your eyes anticipating uh huh  
  
One embrace and two worlds collide  
Feel the heat of our sweet surrender  
Melt away with me theres nothing else  
Time stands still when we are together  
  
On the edge of a moment  
Return to forever with you  
We made love over lifetimes  
Rapture so rare to be true  
I keep holding onto  
On the edge of the moment  
With you  
  
Letting go of all I knew  
My hearts racing fast  
Not sure where Im going  
Nothing certain theres nothing to lose  
You by my side all that I know is  
  
On the edge of a moment  
Return to forever with you  
We made love over lifetimes  
Rapture so rare to be true  
I keep holding onto  
On the edge of the moment  
With you  
Woah woah woah woah with you  
  
With your sweet love I lose all track of time  
Till I dont know if its day or night  
Before it all fades into the past  
Wanna see how long we can make it last  
Ooh come on closer  
Into my arms  
  
On the edge of a moment  
Return to forever with you  
We made love over lifetimes  
Rapture so rare to be true  
I keep holding onto  
On the edge of the moment  
With you  
Woah oh oh oh with you
