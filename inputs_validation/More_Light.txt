I think the last time I was warm was in my mother  
Now Im listening in the darkness  
but theres nothing on the wire  
Im locked inside the refrigerator  
So while I sit and shiver  
I rub the sticks together  
And if it takes forever  
I will find my way back to the fire  
Heat is not enough  
More light  
Love is strong enough  
More light  
Fa  
More light  
Everybody must be touched  
I think that we dont need another great communicator  
And theres a million extended mixers we are ready to retire  
We all face obsolescence sooner or later  
So while we sit and shiver  
We rub the sticks together  
And if it takes forever  
we will find our way back to the fire
