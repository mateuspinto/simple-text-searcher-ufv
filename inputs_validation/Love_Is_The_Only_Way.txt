Baby baby  
I found you one day  
Lonely bored going nowhere  
You were at a bar  
Drinking from a far  
And looking off into space  
  
I came up to you  
Asked you how do you do  
And we struck up a conversation  
It turned real personal  
And with me became a sensation  
  
Baby baby  
I found in you  
Something oh so true  
I knew at the time  
I wanted you as mine  
I asked you to date  
And you said that would be oh so great  
From there we went somewhere  
And love was in the air  
  
Baby baby  
Over time  
You grew to be mine  
I did not want to lose you  
I did not want to screw you  
I found in you a love so true  
I want to keep it forever  
You and me always together  
  
Baby baby  
One day after some time  
I would ask you a most precious line  
I asked you to marry me  
You said I agree  
And together we went off to be married  
  
Baby baby  
In you I found a love oh so true  
It is pure and white  
Something true in my heart  
In you all my dreams come alive  
You give me joy euphoria and vibe  
With you I gave my heart all the way  
For you baby love is the only way  
  
Love is the only way  
Love is the only way  
Love is the only way  
Believe it true baby  
It is true everyday
