I wake up and I look at the clock  
In the middle of the night my heart stops  
When I see you in the moonlight  
I know why Im in love  
  
Peace will come I promise you  
I wish you success in all you do  
And when I think about the rest  
I know why Im in love  
  
Its hard to find the kind of thing  
Youve searched for all your life  
Someone bright and crazy  
With a little soul inside  
And looking at you fast asleep  
I thank the stars above  
  
And what more can I say  
Ive said it all in different ways  
The bottom line the simple facts are true  
I know why Im in love with you  
I only hope you know I love you too  
  
I kiss you and I melt inside  
What you mean to me I cant describe  
And if seeing is believing  
Youd know why Im in love
