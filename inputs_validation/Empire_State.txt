Written by Lindsey Buckingham  
  
New York open your eyes to me  
Let me be what I want to be  
Tell me tell me its not too late  
  
Big Apple takin a bite of me  
Whole world movin below my feet  
Not like not like we do in L A  
  
New York make me a part of you  
Straight straight through the heart of you  
Tell me tell me its not too late  
  
Flying high on the empire state  
Flying high on the empire state  
  
New York watch me burn ya down  
Straight straight through the heart of town  
Tell me tell me Im not too late  
  
Big Apple takin a bite of me  
Whole world movin below my feet  
Not like not like we do in L A  
  
Flying high on the empire state  
Flying high on the empire state
