Just when you make your way back home  
I find some time to be alone  
I go to see the place once more  
Just like a thousand nights before  
I climb the stage again this night  
Cause the place seems still alive  
When the smoke is going down  
  
This is the place where I belong  
I really love to turn you on  
Ive got your sound still in my ear  
While your traces disappear  
I climb the stage again this night  
Cause the place seems still alive  
When the smoke is going down  
  
I climb the stage again this night  
Cause the place seems still alive  
When the smoke is going down  
When the smoke is going down  
When the smoke is going down
