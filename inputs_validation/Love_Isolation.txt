These are words  
Just for you  
Only words  
But its all I can do  
  
Reasons fade  
As reasons can do  
All I want  
Is to talk with you  
  
You cried with me  
Laughed at me  
Talked to me  
Sheltered me  
Fought by me  
Lied for me  
You lived for me  
  
So call me  
And Ill run to you  
Ask me  
And Id die for you  
  
You were there  
You were always there  
Like a friend  
Like a lifelong friend  
And I love you  
  
I broke your heart  
And you stole mine  
Memories lie  
But theyre all I can find  
  
Call my name  
Sing my song  
Call for me  
Ive been waiting so long  
  
Just call me  
And Ill run to you  
Ask me  
And Id die for you  
  
You were there  
You were always there  
Like a friend  
Like a lifelong friend  
And I miss you
