One day  
Well find the time  
To spend together  
Until then my love  
  
If I had one wish  
It wouldnt be hard to choose  
Seven Sundays in a row  
Cause thats the day  
That I spend with you  
  
Someday soon  
You and I  
Will hold each other  
Once again my love  
  
If I had one wish  
It wouldnt be hard to choose  
Seven Sundays in a row  
Seven Sundays in a row  
Seven Sundays in a row  
Cause thats the day  
That I spend with you  
  
If I had one wish  
It wouldnt be hard to choose
