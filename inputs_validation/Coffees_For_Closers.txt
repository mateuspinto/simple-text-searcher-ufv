I cant explain a thing  
I want everything  
To change and stay the same on top  
Doesnt care about anyone or anything  
Now come together come apart  
Only get lonely when you read the charts  
  
Oh baby when they made me  
They broke the mold  
Girls used to follow me around  
Then I got cold  
  
Chorus  
Throw your cameras in the air  
And wave em like you just dont care  
I will never believe in anything again  
I will never believe in anything again  
Oh change will come  
Oh change will come  
I will never believe in anything again  
We never believe again  
Kick drum beating in my chest again  
Oh we will never believe again  
Preach electric to a microphone stand  
  
Oh Im a mascot for what youve become  
And oh oh I love the mayhem more than the love  
And oh baby when they made me  
They broke the mold  
Girls used to follow me around  
When I got cold  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh throw your cameras in the air  
And wave em cause I just dont care  
Oh throw your cameras in the air  
And wave em cause I just dont care  
  
Chorus  
  
I will never believe in anything again  
I will never believe in anything again  
Oh change will come  
Oh change will come  
I will never believe in anything again  
I will never believe in anything again  
  
We will never believe again  
Kickdrum beating in my chest again  
Oh we will never believe again  
Preach electric to a microphone stand  
We will never believe again  
Kickdrum beating in my chest again  
Oh we will never believe again  
Preach electric to a microphone stand  
We will never believe again  
Kickdrum beating in my chest again  
Oh we will never believe again  
Preach electric to a microphone stand
