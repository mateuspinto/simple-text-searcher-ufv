From the islands to the cities from the ports into the sea  
We are strong we will always be  
Blazing through the wreckage burning all we see  
The life we lead committed to be free  
  
Our union is a fortress  
Together we are bound  
A common bound in freedom and in sound  
So raise your voices high  
  
For miles around to hear  
Let them know we are drawing near  
  
In union we stand  
As they blaze across the land  
In union we make a final stand  
  
A peaceful coexistence is droping out of sight  
So band together together we will fight  
Blasting the resistance marching to the top  
They started this we say when it stops  
  
Strike fear within their hearts  
Strike down those in your way  
Let them know that we live today  
They throw us into flames  
  
Did not hear our cries  
But now from the ashes we arise
