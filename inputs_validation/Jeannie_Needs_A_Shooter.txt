I was born down by the river where the dirty water flows  
And the cold wind cut through me it cut right through my clothes  
And the anger and the yearning like fever in my veins  
Set the fire burning  
  
She came down from Knightstown with her hands hard from the line  
From the first time I laid eyes on her I know that shed be mine  
Her father was a lawman he swore hed shoot me dead  
Cause he knew I wanted Jeannie and Id haver her like I said  
  
Chorus  
Jeannie needs a shooter  
Shooter like me  
Jeannie needs a shooter  
Jeannie needs a shooter  
Shooter on her side  
Jeannie needs a shooter  
  
We met down by the river on the final day in May  
And when I leaned down to kiss her she did not turn away  
I drew out all my money and together we did vow  
To meet that very evening and get away somehow  
  
Chorus  
  
The night was cold and rainy down by the borderline  
I was riding hard to meet her when a shot rang out behind  
As I lay there in the darkness with a pistol by my side  
Jeannie and her father rode off into the night  
Jeannie needs a shooter
