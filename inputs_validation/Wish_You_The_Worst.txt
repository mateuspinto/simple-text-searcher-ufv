I saw you  
At the grocery store  
Oh  
You both looked happy  
Picking out the usual  
Shes a carbon copy  
Of everything you lost  
Of everything Im not  
I guess you just forgot  
How to pick em  
  
If shes the one  
Ive heard about  
Im disappointed  
If shes the reason  
Why you left  
Im not impressed at all  
Well  
This looks like the end  
Yeah  
We can still be friends  
Congratulations  
  
Let me be the first  
To wish you the worst  
Cause I think you  
Deserve each other  
Let me the curse  
That creeps  
Under your skin  
Until your heart  
Caves in  
And you wish  
She was me again  
  
And again  
And again  
And again  
  
Well someone had  
To tell the truth  
And Im always honest  
I read you  
Like an open book  
And its obvious to me  
Shes just  
The one between  
Heading no where fast  
Sure  
Its gonna last forever  
  
Let me be the first  
To wish you the worst  
Cause I think you  
Deserve each other  
Let me the curse  
That creeps  
Under your skin  
Until your heart  
Caves in  
And you wish  
She was me  
  
Let me be the first  
To wish you the worst  
Cause I think you  
Deserve each other  
Let me the curse  
That creeps  
Under your skin  
Until your heart  
Caves in  
And you wish  
She was me again  
  
And again  
And again  
And again  
  
Oh you wish  
You wish  
You wish  
You do
