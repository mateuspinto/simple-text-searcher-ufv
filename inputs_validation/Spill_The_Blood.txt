Come walk with me through endless time  
See what has been and what the future sees  
Share the wisdom of the old world that has passed  
Step in a life thats yet to be born  
  
You spill the blood  
Eternal soul  
  
Ill show you sights that you would not believe  
Experience pleasures thought unobtained  
At one with evil that has ruled before  
Now smell the stench of immortality  
  
You spill the blood  
Eternal soul  
  
Spill your blood let it run on to me  
Take my hand and let go of your life  
Close your eyes and see what is me  
Raise the chalice embrace for evermore  
  
Youve spilt the blood  
I have your soul
