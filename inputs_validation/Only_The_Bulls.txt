Verse 1 Lupe Fiasco  
That right there should make you wanna fan up  
If you a fan that should make you wanna stand up  
If you already standing put your hands up  
Real high man try and touch the banners  
Its the home of the champions  
Hard working turn a home into a mansion  
Need you to put your hands up  
Cause they dont know you gotta make em understand us  
From the floor seats to the nosebleeds  
From the young ones to the ogs  
From the Bob Loves to the Rozays  
And from the mjs to the Joakims  
See the statue outside how this floor team  
Take a picture this a city for the winners  
You aint got horns you gotta dress warm  
It really get chilly in the city in the winter  
Lets go  
  
Hook Fall Out Boy  
Only the Bulls only the Bulls only the Bulls  
Only the one and only Chicago Bulls

Verse 2 Lupe Fiasco  
Fan from Day 1 or from back in the day  91 93 96 98  
And that white when we at home that red when away  
Got my jersey my Jordans Im ready to play  
Ive been  representin the city I was born in  
From the Go so you know that we be going in  
Swear to God I think we about to score again  
And we got that  we got that foul and we got that   
They got that style but we got that   
So we shut that down because we got that D fence  
Never let my city down man I put that on Red Kerr  
Every dunk should make the cover of a magazine  
Feeling flyer than Benny on a trampoline  
  
Hook Fall Out Boy  
Only the Bulls only the Bulls only the Bulls  
Only the one and only Chicago Bulls  
Only the Bulls only the Bulls only the Bulls
