One day as I was walking through my garden I saw a little frog lying on the
ground And I thought he was sick So I picked him up and he wasnt sick at
all He was very sad and he was crying And I said Whats a matter with you
little frog And he looked up at me with a lump in his throat and he said

It aint easy being green  
Having to spend each day the color of the leaves  
When I think I think it would be nicer being red  
Or yellow or gold  
  
You see it aint easy being green  
It seems to blend in with so many other ordinary things  
And then sometimes sometimes people pass over you  
Because youre not standing out like sparkles on the water  
Or like the stars in the sky  
  
But did you know that green is the color of Spring  
And green can be big like an ocean  
And important like a mountain  
And cool and friendlylike  
Or tall and skinny like a tree  
And me  
  
But when green is all there is to be  
It kind of makes you wonder why  
Why wonder wonder why  
Hey Im green and I think itll do fine  
Cause green is just what I wanna be  
Cause green is beautiful baby  
Right on green  
And anyway moneys green
