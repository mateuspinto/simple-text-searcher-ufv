The way you take over the floor  
Your style your grace Im wanting more  
The way you move under the strobe  
Has got me losing all control  
  
I see you from across the room  
Theres nobody in this place but you  
Just take my hand let me take you away  
By the music is going and going  
  
Can I have this dance  
Ive been waiting to get with you all night  
  
All I need is one chance  
So follow me into the spotlight  
  
All I need is one dance with you you you you you you  
All I need is one dance with you you you you you you  
  
So take your time dont be afraid  
I just take your hand and grab my way  
Get close to me I feel the heat  
Boy you bout to drive me insane  
  
I feel your heart beating with mine  
The mood the space the stars align  
So take my hand let me take you away  
By the music is going and going  
  
Can I have this dance  
Ive been waiting to get with you all night  
  
All I need is one chance  
So follow me into the spotlight  
  
All I need is one dance with you you you you you you  
All I need is one dance with you you you you you you

So caught up in the rhythm the way that you moving  
Im so into it I hope the music never stops
