Now and then  
I must admit I wonder if I had the chance  
To vanquish foes with nothing more than just a glance  
How perfect every single day would be  
  
To never wait in driving rain  
For the bus that never came  
Not to be the one to blame  
For anybody elses misery  
  
Now and then  
I contemplate a different way around this day  
With nothing more than simple words so I can say  
Im quite content and happy being me  
  
Walking tall with peace of mind  
To leave no childhood dreams behind  
Arriving home to always find  
Things just as I know they ought to be  
  
Now and then  
I must admit I wonder if I had the chance  
To vanquish foes with nothing more than just a glance  
How perfect every single day would be  
To never wait in driving rain  
For the bus that never came  
Not to be the one to blame  
For anybody elses misery  
  
Now and then  
I wake up when it hits me like a ton of bricks  
I realize its me who has to take the licks  
No angels up there looking after me  
No rainbow with a pot of gold  
No cloak to shield me from the cold  
No pill to stop me growing old  
Dreams fading into stark reality
