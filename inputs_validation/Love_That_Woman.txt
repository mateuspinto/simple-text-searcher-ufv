The way you walk  it drives me mad  
Now the way you talk  it makes me glad  
Love that woman  yes youre everything to me  
Whoa cause youre a friend and lover  
  
Whoa just as sweet as a woman should be  
She knows how to work  and she knows how to play  
She knows how to keep me happy  everyday  
Love that woman yes I need you by my side  
  
Whoa cause you got a way baby  
Whoa a way that keeps me satisfied  
When a no good man  tries to give her a line  
She tells him quick  whoa shes all mine  
  
Love that woman yes your everything to me  
Whoa cause youre a friend and lover  
Just as sweet as good as a woman should be  
  
I love you baby  
I love you baby  
I love that woman  
I love that woman  
I love that woman  
I love that woman
