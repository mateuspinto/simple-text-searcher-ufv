Set the night to music  
Set the night to music  
  
Look at all the stars tonight look at all the moonlight  
Look at us were all alone  
Oh and its just like a dream some romantic fantasy  
Darling come and hold hold me close  
  
We could be making love  
And with the slightest touch  
We could set the night to music  
We could set the night to music  
We could do what we want to do  
Itll only take me and you to  
Set the night to music  
  
Find a rhythm all our own melt into it nice and slow  
Love ourselves away from here  
Your heart beating next to mine perfect love in perfect time  
Watch the world disappear  
  
This moment is ours to take This moment is ours  
And with the love we make  
We could set the night to music  
We could set the night to music  
We could do what we want to do  
Itll only take me and you to  
Set the night to music  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah  
This moment is ours to take This moment is ours  
And with the love we make  
We could set the night to music  
We could set the night to music  
We could do what we want to do  
Itll only take me and you  
  
To set the night set the night  
Set the night to music  
Set the night to music  
We could set the night to music  
We could set the night to music  
We could set the night to music  
Set the night set the night set the night set the night
