There are flowers in the cities some with color some are pale  
You may find them on the sidewalks some are wilted but still for sale  
You can pick forbidden flowers there are ways and there are means  
If you pick forbidden flowers you may shatter someones dream  
 guitar   
There are flowers in the country soft to touch and sweet to smell  
There are dangers in the flowers pick them wisely know them well  
You can pick forbidden flowers  
You may shatter someones dream
