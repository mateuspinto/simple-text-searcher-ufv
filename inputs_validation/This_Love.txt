I was so high I did not recognize  
The fire burning in her eyes  
The chaos that controlled my mind  
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane  
Never to return again  
But always in my heart  
  
Chorus  
This love has taken its toll on me  
She said goodbye too many times before  
And her heart is breaking in front of me  
I have no choice cause I wont say goodbye anymore  
  
I tried my best to feed her appetite  
Keep her coming every night  
So hard to keep her satisfied  
Kept playing love like it was just a game  
Pretending to feel the same  
Then turn around and leave again  
  
Chorus  
  
Ill fix these broken things  
Repair your broken wings  
And make sure everything is alright  
My pressure on your hips  
Sinking my fingertips  
Into every inch of you  
Cause I know thats what you want me to do  
  
Chorus
