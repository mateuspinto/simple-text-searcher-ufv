I spent all my money in a mexican whorehouse  
Across the street from a catholic church  
And then I wiped off my revolver  
And I buttoned up my burgundy shirt  
  
I shot the morning in the back  
With my red wings on  
I told the sun hed better go back down  
And if I can find a book of matches  
Im goin to burn this hotel down  
  
You got to tell me brave captain  
Why are the wicked so strong  
How do the angels get to sleep  
When the devil leaves the porchlight on  
  
Well I dropped thirty grand on the nugget slots  
I had to sell my ass on fremont street  
And the drummer said theres sanctuary  
Over at the Baghdad room  
  
And now its one for the money two for the show  
Three to get ready and go man go  
I said tell me mr siegel  
How do I get out of here  
  
Well willards knocked out on a bottle of heat  
Drivin dangerous curves across the dirty sheets  
He said man you ought to see her  
When her parents are gone  
  
Man you ought to hear her when the sirens on  
You got to tell me brave captain  
Why are the wicked so strong  
How do the angels get to sleep  
When the devil leaves the porchlight on  
  
Dont you know that aint no broken bottle  
That I picked up in my headlights  
On the other side of the nevada line  
Where they live hard die young  
  
And have a good lookin corpse every time  
Well the pitboss said I should keep movin  
This is where you go when you die  
And so I shot a black beauty  
And I kissed her right between the eyes  
  
Well willards knocked out on a bottle of heat  
Drivin dangerous curves across the dirty sheets  
He said man you ought to see her  
When her parents are gone  
Man you ought to hear her when the sirens on  
  
You got to tell me brave captain  
Why are the wicked so strong  
How do the angels get to sleep  
When the devil leaves the porch light on
