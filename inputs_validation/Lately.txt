Lately I have had the strangest feeling  
With no vivid reason here to find  
Yet the thought of losing yous been hanging round my mind  
Far more frequently youre wearing perfume  
With you say no special place to go  
But when I ask will you be coming back soon  
You dont know never know  
Well Im a man of many wishes  
Hope my premonition misses  
But what I really feel my eyes wont let me hide  
Cause they always start to cry  
Cause this time could mean goodbye  
Lately Ive been staring in the mirror  
Very slowly picking me apart  
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart  
Just the other night while you were sleeping  
I vaguely heard you whisper someones name  
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping  
You just say nothings changed  
Well Im a man of many wishes  
I hope my premonition misses  
But what I really feel my eyes wont let me hide  
Cause they always start to cry  
Cause this time could mean goodbye goodbye  
Oh Im a man of many wishes  
I hope my premonition misses  
But what I really feel my eyes wont let me hide  
Cause they always start to cry  
Cause this time could mean goodbye
