He said Im gonna buy this place and burn it down  
Im gonna put it six feet underground  
He said Im gonna buy this place and watch it fall  
Stand here beside me baby in the crumbling walls  
Oh Im gonna buy this place and start a fire  
Stand here until I fill all your hearts desires  
Because Im gonna buy this place and see it burn  
Do back the things it did to you in return  
  
Ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah  
  
He said Im gonna buy a gun and start a war  
If you can tell me something worth fighting for  
Oh and Im gonna buy this place thats what I said  
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head  
  
And honey all the movements youre starting to make  
See me crumble and fall on my face  
And I know the mistakes that I made  
See it all disappear without a trace  
And they call as they beckon you on  
They said start as you mean to go on  
Start as you mean to go on  
  
He said Im gonna buy this place and see it go  
Stand here beside my baby watch the orange glow  
Somell laugh and some just sit and cry  
You just sit down there and you wonder why  
So Im gonna buy a gun and start a war  
If you can tell me something worth fighting for  
And Im gonna buy this place thats what I said  
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head  
Oh to the head  
  
And honey all the movements youre starting to make  
See me crumble and fall on my face  
And I know the mistakes that I made  
See it all disappear without a trace  
And they call as they beckon you on  
They say start as you mean to go on  
As you mean to go on as you mean to go on  
  
So meet me by the bridge meet me by the lane  
When am I gonna see that pretty face again  
Meet me on the road meet me where I said  
Blame it all upon  
A rush of blood to the head
