Have you ever been  
To Electric Ladyland  
The magic carpet waits  
For you  
So dont be late  
I wanna show you  
The different emotions  
I wanna run to  
The sounds and motions heeey  
Electric woman waits for you and me  
So its time we take a ride  
We can cast all of your hangups over the seaside  
While we fly right over the love filled sea  
Look up ahead  
I see the loveland  
Soon youll understand  
Make love make love make love make love  
I wanna show you  
The angels will spread their wings yeah  
I wanna run to  
Good and evil lay side by side  
While electric love penetrates the sky
