Ive been waiting for something to happen  
For a week or a month or a year  
With the blood in the ink of the headlines  
And the sound of the crowd in my ear  
  
You might ask what it takes to remember  
When you know that youve seen it before  
Where a government lies to a people  
And a country is drifting to war  
  
Theres a shadow on the faces  
Of the men who send the guns  
To the wars that are fought in places  
Where their business interests run  
  
On the radio talk shows and TV  
You hear one thing again and again  
How the USA stands for freedom  
And we come to the aid of a friend  
But who are the ones that we call our friends  
These governments killing their own  
Or the people who finally cant take anymore  
And they pick up a gun or a brick or a stone  
  
And there are lives in the balance  
There are people under fire  
There are children at the cannons  
And there is blood on the wire  
  
Theres a shadow on the faces  
Of the men who fan the flames  
Of the wars that are fought in places  
Where we cant even say the names  
  
They sell us the president the same way  
They sell us our clothes and our cars  
They sell us everything from youth to religion  
The same time they sell us our wars  
  
I want to know who the men in the shadows are  
I want to hear somebody asking them why  
They can be counted on to tell us who our enemies are  
But theyre never the ones to fight or to die  
  
And there are lives in the balance  
There are people under fire  
There are children at the cannons  
And there is blood on the wire
