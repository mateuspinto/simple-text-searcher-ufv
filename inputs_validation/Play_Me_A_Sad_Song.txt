Play me a sad song  
Tell me your womans gone  
You know how misery loves company  
Sing it just one more time  
Before I lose my mind  
Tell me how misery loves company  
Loneliness surrounds me  
Emptiness you found me  
I dont think I can go on  
  
Sing me a drinking song  
Tell me you done her wrong  
You know how misery loves company  
Ill put in my last dime  
To hear it one more time  
Willie sing Misery Loves Company  
Loneliness surrounds me  
Emptiness you found me  
I dont think I can go on  
I dont think I can go on  
I dont think I can go on
