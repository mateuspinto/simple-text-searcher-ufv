Call up ring once hang up the phone  
To let me know you made it home  
Dont want nothing to be wrong with parttime lover  
If shes with me Ill blink the lights  
To let you know tonights the night  
For me and you my parttime lover  
  
We are undercover passion on the run  
Chasing love up against the sun  
We are strangers by day lovers by night  
Knowing its so wrong but feeling so right  
  
If Im with friends and we should meet  
Just pass me by dont even speak  
Know the words discreet when parttime lovers  
But if theres some emergency  
Have a male friend to ask for me  
So then she wont peek its really you my parttime lover  
  
We are undercover passion on the run  
Chasing love up against the sun  
We are strangers by day lovers by night  
Knowing its so wrong but feeling so right

Ive got something that I must tell  
Last night someone rang our doorbell  
And it was not you my parttime lover  
And then a man called our exchange  
But didnt want to leave his name  
I guess that two can play the game  
Of parttime lovers  
You and me parttime lovers  
But she and he parttime lovers
