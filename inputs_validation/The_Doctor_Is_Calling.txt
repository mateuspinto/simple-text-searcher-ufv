The doctor is calling  
Somethings gone wrong  
Nowhere do I belong  
I listen to the voices in the dark room  
Somethings going down  
But I cant make a sound  
Looking past the bars of my mind  
The coat of arms falling  
I hear the doctor calling  
The family crest is falling  
I hear the doctor calling  
Always sharing trips  
Remove me from your lips  
Sight and mind still and never go away  
One too many tantrums  
Deviated symptoms  
Better lock the phantom away  
The coat of arms falling  
I hear the doctor calling  
The family crest is falling  
I hear the doctor calling  
I see the chalk line crawling  
I hear the doctor calling me away  
This place is my home  
My mind still runs free  
The doctors prescription  
Less for you and more for me  
The coat of arms falling  
I hear the doctor calling  
The family crest is falling  
I hear the doctor calling  
I see the chalk line crawling  
I hear the doctor calling me away  
A merciful embalming  
I hear the doctor calling me away
