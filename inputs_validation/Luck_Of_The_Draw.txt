You dust the bottles on the bar counter  
Youre writing screenplays on the side  
Three nights a week can keep a girl workin  
Sometimes its good to lose your pride  
These things we do to keep the flame burnin  
And write our fire in the sky  
Another day to see the wheel turnin  
Another avenue to try  
Its in the luck of the draw baby  
The natural law  
Forget those movies you saw little baby  
Its in the luck of the draw  
The natural law  
Flame keep on burnin  
Forget those movies you saw little baby  
Wheel ever turnin  
You turn around and say its last orders  
You fix the ribbon in your hair  
Tomorrows letter by the hall doorway  
Could be the answer to your prayers  
These things we do to keep the flame burnin  
And write our fire in the sky  
Another day to see the wheel turnin  
Another avenue to try  
Its in the luck of the draw baby  
The natural law  
Forget those movies you saw little baby  
Its in the luck of the draw  
The natural law  
Flame keep on burnin  
Forget those movies you saw little baby  
Wheel ever turnin  
These things we do to keep the flame burnin  
And write our fire in the sky  
Another day to see the wheel turnin  
Another avenue to try  
Its in the luck of the draw baby  
The natural law  
Forget those movies you saw little baby  
Its in the luck of the draw  
The natural law  
Flame keep on burnin  
Forget those movies you saw little baby  
Wheel ever turnin  
Its in the luck of the draw  
Flame keep on burnin  
The natural law  
Wheel ever turnin
