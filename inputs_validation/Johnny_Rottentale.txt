Go will i  
Over yonder  
I will see my mother  
And my sister  
And my father  
Oh but my brother is going to hell  
  
Well they hung him  
From the gallow  
As the sun turned  
Red from yellow  
And the crowd they  
Heard him haughty  
And they sighed  
With much relief  
  
The preacher asked him  
For any last words  
My brother spit on  
Onto his clean shirt  
Oh and he smiled  
Without redemption  
Said this is one soul  
God dont need  
  
Well now I loved him  
I will miss him  
As hes burning  
And twisting  
For his heart with  
Dedication  
To the devil  
And his creed  
  
Well as a child we  
Wed call him rotten  
Tell him he was lonely  
And forgotten  
And he revenged our  
Constant cheering  
Oh with his every  
Word and deed  
  
Oh yeah and for my  
Contribution  
To his souls lack  
Of retribution  
Oh well I ask the  
Lords forgiveness  
On my very bended knee
