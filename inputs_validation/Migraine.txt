Am I the only one I know  
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat  
Shadows will scream that Im alone  
  
III Ive got a migraine  
And my pain will range from up down and sideways  
Thank God its Friday cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays  
Cause Sundays are my suicide days  
  
I dont know why they always seem so dismal  
Thunderstorms clouds snow and a slight drizzle  
Whether its the weather or the letters by my bed  
Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head  
Let it be said what the headache represents  
Its me defending in suspense  
Its me suspended in a defenseless test  
Being tested by a ruthless examiner  
Thats represented best by my depressing thoughts  
I do not have writers block my writer just hates the clock  
It will not let me sleep I guess Ill sleep when Im dead  
And sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head  
  
Am I the only one I know  
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat  
Shadows will scream that Im alone  
But I know weve made it this far kid  
  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
I am not as fine as I seem  
Pardon me for yelling and telling you green gardens  
Are not whats growing in my psyche its a different me  
A difficult beast feasting on burnt down trees  
Freeze frame please let me paint a mental picture portrait  
Something you wont forget its all about my forehead  
And how it is a door that holds back contents  
That makes Pandoras box contents look nonviolent  
Behind my eyelids are islands of violence  
My mind shipwrecked this is the only land my mind could find  
I did not know it was such a violent island  
Full of tidal waves suicidal crazed lions  
Theyre trying to eat me blood running down their chin  
And I know that I can fight or I can let the lion win  
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find  
Cause sometimes to stay alive you gotta kill your mind  
  
Am I the only one I know  
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat  
Shadows will scream that Im alone  
But I know weve made it this far kid  
  
And I will say that we should take a day to break away  
From all the pain our brain has made the game is not played alone  
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it  
And keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone  
  
And I will say that we should take a day to break away  
From all the pain our brain has made the game is not played alone  
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it  
And keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone  
  
Am I the only one I know  
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat  
Shadows will scream that Im alone  
But I know weve made it this far kid  
  
Made it this far  
Made it this fa
