Like this Ive never seen a woman baby  
That looks quite the way you do  
The way you shake that thing now honey  
Cant take my eyes off you  
  
The way you work it honey  
It brings me to my knees  
You give me what Im looking for  
Ill give you what you need  
And I said  
  
Chorus  
I got the one thing you want  
Get it all night long  
You got the one thing I need  
When your body talks  
I hear it talking to me  
Say get it all night long  
Woman why cant you see  
Youre my one thing  
  
I got a world of trouble baby  
Its going on inside my head  
Playing your game got me half insane  
Trying to make sense of every word you said  
  
Stop beating around the bush  
Youre just wasting time  
Lets get down to the business honey  
And lay it one the line  
And I said  
  
Chorus  
  
Tell me the news  
Lets hear your story  
You think you got nothing to lose  
You better use it up  
Before it gets old baby  
And becomes yesterdays news  
  
Chorus
