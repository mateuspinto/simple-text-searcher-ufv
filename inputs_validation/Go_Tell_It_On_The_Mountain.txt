CHORUS  
Go tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and everywhere  
Go tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born  
  
CHORUS repeat  
  
While shepherds kept their watchin  
Oer silent flocks by night  
Behold throughout the heavens  
There shone a holy light  
  
CHORUS repeat  
  
Down in a lowly manger  
The humble Christ was born  
And brought us Gods salvation  
That blessed Christmas morn  
  
CHORUS repeat 5X
