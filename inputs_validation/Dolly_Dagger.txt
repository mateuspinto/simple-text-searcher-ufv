Here comes Dolly Dagger  
Her love so heavy gonna make you stagger  
Dolly Dagger  
She drinks the blood from a jagged edge  
Ah drink up baby  
  
Been ridin broomsticks since she was fifteen  
Blow out all the other witches on the scene  
She got a bull whip just as long as your life  
Her tong can even scratch the soul out of the devils wife  
  
Well i seen her in action at the players choice  
Turn all the love men into donut boys  
Hey red hot momma youd better step aside  
This chicks gonna turn you to a block of ice  
Look out

Her love so heavy gonna make you stagger baby  
Dolly Dagger  
She drinks the blood from a jagged edge  
Right on  
Drink up baby  
Hey  
  
Yeah look at old burnt out superman  
Tryin to shoot his dust on the sun  
Captain comic is the man on the run  
On the words of love  
Do they ever touch dolly brown  
Better get in some highway and clear outta town  
  
Here comes Dolly Dagger  
Her loves so heavy gonna make you stagger  
Dolly Dagger  
She aint satisfied til she get what shes after  
She drinks the blood from the jagged edge  
Look out baby here comes your master  
Alright

Dolly heavy mama  
Get it on get it on get it on
