A young man from a small town  
With a very large imagination  
Lay alone in his room with his radio on  
Looking for another station  
When the static from the mouthpiece  
Gave way to the sound below  
James Dean went out to Hollywood  
And put his picture in a Picture Show  
James Dean went out to Hollywood  
And put his picture in a Picture Show  
  
Chorus  
And its oh Daddy get off of your knees  
Mamma whyd you have to go  
Your darling Jim is out a limb  
I put my picture in a Picture Show  
Whoa ho Put my picture in a Picture Show  
  
Hamburgers cheeseburgers  
Wilbur and Orville Wright  
John Garfield in the afternoon  
Montgomery Clift at night  
When the static hit the mouthpiece  
Gave way to the sound below  
James Dean went out to Hollywood  
And put his picture in a picture show  
  
Chorus  
  
A Mocca man in a wigwam sitting on a Reservation  
With a big black hole in the belly of his soul  
Waiting on an explanation  
While the white man sits on his fat can  
And takes pictures of the Navajo  
Every time he clicks his Kodak pics  
He steals a little bit of soul  
Every time he clicks his Kodak pics  
He steals a little bit of soul  
  
Chorus  
  
Yie Hi Put my picture in a picture show  
Here we go  
A young man from a small town  
With a very large imagination
