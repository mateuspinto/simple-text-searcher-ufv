Sometimes a girl  
Will come and go  
You reach for love  
But life wont let ya know  
That in the end  
Youll still be loving her  
But then shes gone  
Youre all alone  
  
Sign of pain  
Is on my face well  
My heart beat stops  
But I wont take the blame no no  
I gave her all the love I had within  
My love was strong  
Something went wrong no no  
  
It takes a fool to learn  
Yes sir  
That love dont love nobody  
Love love love love love love  
It takes a fool to learn  
Yes it does girl  
That love dont love no one  
That love dont love no one  
It takes a fool to learn  
Stop to think about it well  
That love dont love nobody  
Oh Oh no  
It takes a fool to learn  
When youre down and out shout about it  
That love dont love no more  
Tell the world oh babe  
No more  
  
Oh babe  
It takes a fool to learn  
Gotta be more careful about myself  
That love dont love nobody  
It takes a fool to learn  
Whoa baby took me a long time to learn to learn well  
  
That love dont love no one  
It takes a fool to learn  
I was a fool you were a fool  
That love dont love nobody  
Now we got love we need love  
It takes a fool to learn
