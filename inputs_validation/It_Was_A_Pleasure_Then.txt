It was a pleasure then  
Could you just be here again  
To know what there was to see  
When all the Sunday people  
Where so quiet in the dark  
Afraid to be better the next day  
La la la   
  
It was a pleasure then  
When we could sit and stare again  
Until the stars feel  
through the cloudy trees  
Onto the grass  
Stars to smile with us  
Until they too had tears in their eyes  
Tell us this and tell of how much  
we must not agree  
  
It was a pleasure then  
To see the dying days again  
In the horror of the night  
Never never never never never lise  
Keep it secret  
For to hide somewhere at last  
As long as we could see  
The sky confessed this crime  
Of futile tasting hate romance  
Above our shattered minds  
It was a pleasure It was a pleasure  
La la la
