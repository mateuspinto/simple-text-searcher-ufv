Clenching my teeth tight  
My head is like a sponge  
Give it to me free  
I want to get ripped off  
And drown in the airwaves  
Another fatal wreck  
On the information highway  
So go ahead and kill yourselves  
It all amuses me  
For Ill be damned to spend my life in hell  
Another wise ingrate  
Bring me blood and pain  
Of a strangers fate  
Give it all away  
Give it to me now  
Im desensitized  
I want to watch the bomb  
Blow the masses high  
I want to get ripped off  
And drown in the airwaves  
Another fatal wreck  
On the information highway  
So go ahead and kill yourselves  
It all amuses me  
For Ill be damned to spend my life in hell  
Another wise ingrate  
Bring me blood and pain  
Of a strangers fate  
Give it all away  
I want to get ripped off  
And drown in the airwaves  
Another fatal wreck  
On the information highway  
So go ahead and kill yourselves  
It all amuses me  
For Ill be damned to spend my life in hell  
Another wise ingrate
