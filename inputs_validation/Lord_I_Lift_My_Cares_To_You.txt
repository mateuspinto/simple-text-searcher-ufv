Lord I lift my cares to Thee  
Weary is my soul  
Lord my strength my comfort be  
In my time of sorrow  
  
Keep me from errant ways O Lord  
Guide me with Thy decrees  
Let grace and life be my reward  
For living faithfully  
  
Lord I lift my life to Thee  
Help me to be true  
Teach me Lord that I might be  
Justified through You  
  
My heart is set upon Your Law  
It is the light I see  
I run with joy in Your commands  
For You have set me free  
  
Set me free
