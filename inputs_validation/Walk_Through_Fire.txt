Wake a little woozy feeling shitty  
Overdone overtired  
Walking like you lose just shitty  
Wherever you go  
  
Are you happy with the congregation  
Do you find that you always need more  
Are you wishing on a constellation  
Do you find that your throats always sore  
  
You know what they needed  
You know what they like  
You got them believing  
That all of its right  
  
One moment one man  
One time does the best he can  
One push and one desire  
One time to walk through fire  
  
Got an itty bitty shitty over  
Now start the fire  
Just enough pity left to start  
What you dont want to know  
  
Are you happy with your contribution  
Do you find that you always want more  
Are you praying for the revolution  
Looking forward to your day in court  
  
You know what they needed  
You know what they like  
You got them believing  
That all of its right  
  
One moment one man  
One time does the best he can  
One push and one desire  
One time to walk through fire  
  
One moment one man  
One time does the best he can  
One push and one desire  
One time to walk through fire  
  
You know what they needed  
You know what they like  
You got them believing all  
  
One moment one man  
One time does the best he can  
One push and one desire  
One time to walk through fire  
  
One moment one man  
One time does the best he can  
One push and one desire  
One time to walk through fire
