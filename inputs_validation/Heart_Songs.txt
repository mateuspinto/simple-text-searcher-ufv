Gordon Lightfoot  
Sang a song  
About a boat  
That sank in the lake  
At the break  
Of the morning  
A Cat named Stevens  
Found a faith  
He could believe in  
And Joan Baez  
I never listened  
To too much jazz  
But hippie songs  
Could be heard  
In our pad  
Eddie Rabbitt sang  
About how much  
He loved a rainy night  
Abba Devo Benatar  
Were there day  
John Lennon died  
Mr Springsteen said  
He had a hungry heart  
Grover Washington  
Was happy on the day  
He topped the charts  
These are the songs  
  
Chorus  
These are my heart songs  
They never feel wrong  
And when I wake  
For goodness sake  
These are the songs  
I keep singin  
  
Quiet Riot got me started  
With the bangin on my head  
Iron Maiden Judas Priest  
And Slayer  
Taught me how to shred  
I gotta admit though  
Sometimes  
I would listen  
To the radio  
Debbie Gibson  
Tell me that you think  
Were all alone  
Michael Jacksons  
In the mirror  
Ive gotta have faith  
If I wanna see clear  
Never gonna give you up  
Wish me love  
Or wishing well  
It takes two to make  
A thing go right  
If the Fresh Prince  
Starts a fight  
Dont you worry  
For too long  
Cause you know  
These are the songs  
  
Chorus  
  
Back in 1991  
I wasnt havin any fun  
Till my roommate said  
Come on and put  
A brand new record on  
Had a baby on it  
He was naked on it  
Then I heard the chords  
That broke the chains  
I had upon me  
Got together with my bros  
In some rehearsal studios  
Then we played  
Our first rock show  
And watched the fan base  
Start to grow  
Signed the deal that gave  
The dough to make  
A record of our own  
The song come  
On the radio  
Now people go  
This is the song  
  
Chorus  
  
Repeat x4  
These are the songs  
I keep singing
