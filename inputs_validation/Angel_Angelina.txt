Angel oh my angel Angelina  
Heaven must be wonderin where you are  
Mornin finds me prayin please let me keep her  
Each night finds me wishin on a star  
That always oh always Angelina  
Youll be stayin right here in my arms  
  
Sweetest of the sweet those ruby lips  
No other has that touch ooh those fingertips  
Bluest of the blue those sparklin eyes  
Like had in glove we fit you know youre just my size  
You and all your special ways and means  
Oh I love you Angelina  
  
Angel oh my angel Angelina  
Heaven must be wonderin where you are  
Mornin finds me prayin please let me keep her  
Each night finds me wishin on a star  
That always oh always Angelina  
Youll be stayin right here in my arms  
  
Youll be stayin right here in my arms
