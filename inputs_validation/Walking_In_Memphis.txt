Put on my blue suede shoes and I  
Boarded the plane  
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues  
In the middle of the pouring rain  
W C Handy  
Wont you look down over me  
Yeah I got a first class ticket  
But Im as blue as a boy can be  
  
Then Im walking in Memphis  
I was walking with my feet 10 feet off of Beale  
Walking in Memphis  
But do I really feel the way I feel  
  
Saw the ghost of Elvis  
On Union Avenue  
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland  
Then I watched him walk right through  
Now security did not see him  
They just hovered round his tomb  
But theres a pretty little thing  
Waiting for the king  
Down in the jungle room  
  
When I was walking in Memphis  
I was walking with my feet 10 feet off of Beale  
Walking in Memphis  
Do I really feel the way I feel  
  
Now theyve got catfish on the table  
Theyve got gospel in the air  
The Reverend Green hed be glad to see you  
When you havent got a prayer  
  
Boy you got a prayer in Memphis  
  
Muriel plays piano  
Every Friday at the Hollywood  
And they brought me down to see her  
And they asked me if I would  
Do a little number  
So I sang with all my might  
She said Tell me are you a Christian child  
And I said Maam I am tonight  
  
Walking in Memphis  
I was walking with my feet 10 feet off of Beale  
Walking in Memphis  
But do I really feel the way I feel  
  
Walking in Memphis  
I was walking with my feet 10 feet off of Beale  
Walking in Memphis  
Do I really feel the way I feel  
  
Put on my blue suede shoes and I  
Boarded the plane  
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues  
In the middle of the pouring rain  
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues  
In the middle of the pouring rain
