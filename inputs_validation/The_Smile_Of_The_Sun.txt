No more feel no more heal  
No more light meets my eyes  
Is it night is it day  
Im alone paralyzed  
  
Everybody is waiting for the one  
Everyone will freeze to death alone  
  
The smile of the sun  
Was stolen  someone  
Has taken away  
The heart of all day  
The smile of the sun  
Is gone and no one  
But you drives away  
The pain of the grey  
Is anybody out there  
Somebody help me  
  
Got to breathe got to move  
Got to get back my life  
Heres no hope heres no joy  
In this world full of strife  
Gone away gone astray  
All I once believed in  
Its my soul its my heart  
It beats slower and dies  
  
Everybody is waiting for the one  
Everyone will freeze to death alone  
  
The smile of the sun  
Was stolen  someone  
Has taken away  
The heart of all day  
The smile of the sun  
Is gone and no one  
But you drives away  
The pain of the grey  
Is anybody out there waiting  
Anybody out there for me  
The smile of the sun  
Was stolen  
Somebody help me  
  
The smile of the sun  
Is gone and no one  
But you drives away  
The pain of the grey  
  
The smile of the sun  
Was stolen  someone  
Has taken away  
The heart of all day  
The smile of the sun  
Is gone and no one  
But you drives away  
The pain of the grey  
Is anybody out there waiting  
Anybody out there for me  
Is anybody out there searching  
Anybody out there call me  
The smile of the sun  
Was stolen  
Somebody help me
