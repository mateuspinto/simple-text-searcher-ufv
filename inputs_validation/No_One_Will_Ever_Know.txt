No one will ever know my heart is breaking  
Although a million teardrops start to fall  
Ill try myself to sleep and wake up smiling  
I miss you but no one will ever know  
  
Ill tell them we grew tired of each other  
And realized our dreams could never be  
  
Ill even make believe I never loved you  
Then no one will ever know the truth but me  
  
Ill tell them we grew tired of each other  
And realized our dreams could never be  
  
Ill even make believe I never loved you  
Then no one will ever know the truth but me
