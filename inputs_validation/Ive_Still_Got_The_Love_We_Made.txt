You know I cant find the letters you wrote to me in school  
And that shoebox full of photographs got lost in my last move  
I gave away that old twin bed where you and I first laid  
But after all this time Ive still got the love we made  
And that old beat up car we dated in finally turned to rust  
And the first rose that you gave me oh it finally turned to dust  
But all those tender nights we shared are never gonna fade  
  
Cause after all this time Ive still got the love we made  
Ive got every feeling we felt when touched  
Cause even though fell apart I kept a part of us  
Ive held on to every time we held each other tight  
And promised that no matter  
What wed never say goodbye  
I dont have one souvenir  
Of us Id meant to save but right here in my heart  
Ive still got the love we made  
Oh right here in my heart  
Ive still got the love we made
