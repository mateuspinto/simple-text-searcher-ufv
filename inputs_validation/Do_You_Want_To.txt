Hey baby I want to know one thing  
Do you want me as much as I want you  
Say you do  
  
Never should have kissed you  
Never made that call  
I told myself  
In love I shouldnt fall  
Wouldve been a pleasure just to know your name  
Oh look at me silly me now Im back in love again  
And theres nothing you can tell me  
Nothing you can do  
I just hope that youre in love with me  
The way that Im in love with you  
  
Chorus x2  
Do you want to  
Like I want to be in love with you  
Say you do  
Do you want to  
Like I want  
I want to make love to you  
Say you do  
Never understand it  
Love that takes control  
Oh I asked myself  
Girl should you let it go  
That would be to crazy  
Love without you  
Hate to think  
Happily that you wont be around  
Now theres nothing you can tell me  
Nothing you can say  
Promise me youll stay with me  
Until my dying day
