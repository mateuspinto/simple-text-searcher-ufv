Like a bird thats lost in maiden flight  
Im alone and oh so blue tonight  
Like a piece of driftwood on the sea  
May you never be alone like me  
  
I believed the lies you told to me  
When you whispered dear Ill worship thee  
Now here I am all alone and blue  
All because I love no one but you  
  
I have left my friends I left my home  
When you promised to be mine alone  
Now youre gone our love could never be  
May you never be alone like me  
  
In the bible gods own words do say  
For every wrong some day youll have to pay  
Ill pray the lord to set me free  
May you never be alone like me  
  
Goodbye little darling  
  
Goodbye little darling were parting  
Parting dont always mean goodbye  
Although we have to part youre always in my heart  
Goodbye little darling goodbye  
  
Goodbye little darling Ill miss you  
Miss you like the stars would miss the sky  
I hate to see you go Im going to miss you so  
Good bye little darling goodbye  
  
Goodbye little darling I love you  
Ill love you till the day I die  
Will you dream a dream of me where ever you may be  
Goodbye little darling goodbye
