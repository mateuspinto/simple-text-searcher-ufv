I saw you gather all your hopes  
With all your dreams  
I waved just like a shooting star  
That once had waved to me  
  
I am a love in mid air  
I think about it I dont care  
Into the fire of despair  
Just like a train that goes nowhere  
  
But you can rain on me  
Yea you can rain rain on me  
  
There was a time I got it wrong  
Is shakes my memory  
And all the time I had it all  
Its just I couldnt see  
  
I am a robber in the dark  
Singing about a broken heart  
Answering whistles in the air  
Waiting for someone else to care  
  
But you can rain on me  
Yea you can rain on me  
When the rain came tumbling down  
And both your feet were on the ground oh  
Running fast and free oh yea  
  
Well maybe times going to wear you out  
Or maybe youre going to come around or  
Well just yea  
  
Well maybe times going to wear you out  
Or maybe youre going to come around or  
Well just wait and see oh yea  
  
Repeat x2  
But you can rain on me  
Yea you can rain on me
