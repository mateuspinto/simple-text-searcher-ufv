I see the clouds that move across the sky  
I see the wind that moves the clouds away  
It moves the clouds over by the building  
I pick the building that I want to live in  
  
I smell the pine trees and the peaches in the woods  
I see the pine cones that fall by the highway  
Thats the highway that goes to the building  
I pick the building that I want to live in  
  
Its over there its over there  
My building has every convenience  
Its gonna make life easy for me  
Its gonna be easy to get things done  
I will relax alone with my loved ones  
  
Loved ones loved ones visit the building  
Take the highway park and come up and see me  
Ill be working working but if you come visit  
Ill put down what Im doing my friends are important  
  
Dont you worry bout me  
I wouldnt worry about me  
Dont you worry bout me  
Dont you worry bout me  
  
I see the states across this big nation  
I see the laws made in Washington DC  
I think of the ones I consider my favorites  
I think of the people that are working for me  
  
Some civil servants are just like my loved ones  
They work so hard and they try to be strong  
Im a lucky guy to live in my building  
They own the buildings to help them along  
  
Its over there its over there  
My building has every convenience  
Its gonna make life easy for me  
Its gonna be easy to get things done  
I will relax along with my loved ones  
  
Loved ones loved ones visit the building  
Take the highway park and come up and see me  
Ill be working working but if you come visit  
Ill put down what Im doing my friends are important  
  
I wouldnt worry bout  
I wouldnt worry about me  
Dont you worry bout me  
Dont you worry bout me
