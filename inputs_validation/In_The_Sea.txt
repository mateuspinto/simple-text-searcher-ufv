In the sea  
The fish have learned to fly  
On a moonlit night  
On wings of silver  
As the enchanted stars  
Sail serenely by  
Do they know  
Where do unicorns go  
Where winged horses fly  
Narwhals lost at sea  
And never seen again  
Go  
Go and ask the magpie  
Where do unicorns go  
In the trees  
The birds have learned to speak  
Many colored  
They keep their secrets  
In a parade of clouds  
Playing hide and seek  
Do they know  
Where do unicorns go  
Where winged horses fly  
Narwhals lost at sea  
And never seen again  
Does myth  
And mystery lie  
Where the unicorns go
