Check check  
One two one two  
When shit gets hard  
Ima protect you  
  
Now a days seems like death is the way  
Its like the value of life goes down every day  
They pushin rocks in this park  
Where your children play  
But ima be right here  
For you come wit me  
Singin  
  
Ooooooooh  
Ima protect you  
When its cold outside babe  
Ohh ohh ohh  
Ima protect  
With everything that I  
  
You cant tell where the darkness begins or it ends  
You cant trust yourself let alone your friends  
Got the devil at your door  
And he wana get in  
But ima be that one  
On which you can depend  
Singin  
  
Oooooooooooh  
Ima protect you  
When its cold outside babe  
Ohh ohh ohh  
Ima protect you  
With everything that I  
  
The lady of a love just cant get a pass  
Cus hate got tittys and a big old ass  
Sayin come roll with me  
And well have a blast  
But ima stay right here  
Devoted instead of pass  
  
Oooooooooooh  
Ima protect you  
When its cold outside babe  
Ohh ohh ohh  
Ima protect you  
With everything that I  
  
Tryna pull your arm down and give you the blues  
You see that every damn day and every night in the news  
The whole damn world  
Has got issues  
But through the storm and the rain  
Ima be there for you  
Singin  
  
Ooooooooooohhh  
Ima protect you  
When its cold outside babe  
Ohh ohh ohh  
Ima protect you
