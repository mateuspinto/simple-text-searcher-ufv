Kings of earth on a course unknown  
Bearing gifts from afar  
Hoping praying  
Following yonder star  
  
Silhouette of a caravan  
Painted against the sky  
Wise men searching  
For the Holy Child  
  
One king held the frankincense  
One king held the myrrh  
One king held the purest gold  
And one king held the hope of the world  
  
A star hangs over Bethlehem  
A journey ends in the night  
Three kings trembling  
Behold the glorious sight  
  
Heavens treasure Emmanuel  
Drawing men to bow down  
Tiny baby born to wear a crown  
  
One king held the frankincense  
One king held the myrrh  
One king held the purest gold  
And one king held the hope of the world  
  
God rest ye merry gentlemen  
Let nothing you dismay  
Remember Christ our savior  
Was born on Christmas day  
To save us all from Satans power  
When we were gone astray  
Oh Tiny Baby born to wear a crown  
  
One king held the frankincense  
One king held the myrrh  
One king held the purest gold  
And one king held the hope of the world  
  
One king held the frankincense  
One king held the myrrh  
One king held the purest gold  
And one king held the hope of the world  
  
One king held the purest gold  
One king held the hope of the world
