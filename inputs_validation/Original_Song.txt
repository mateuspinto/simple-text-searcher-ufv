When Im alone I try to remember all of the things I want I get  
Depressed but dont give me handouts everyone loves a trier I would  
Love to be lucky as you in with the rich survivors wouldnt complain if  
I was a rich man everyone can can an you want it an you need it an  
You love it we sing the original song gimme more we sing the original  
Song gimme more we sing the original song gimme more we sing please  
Give it to me give it to me when Im alone I talk to myself and  
Dont get the wrong impression dont have the cash but I got the pride  
I never lay down and die I see the pictures I know the adverts everyone  
Else got lucky I got the bad deal looking around me everyone can can
