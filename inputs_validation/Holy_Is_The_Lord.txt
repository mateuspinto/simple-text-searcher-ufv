I can see the angels gathering  
Round the Throne to bring an offering  
Of praise to the King of all Kings  
Its Jesus  
I can hear their voices singing loud  
Bringing anthems in a glorious cloud  
Of praise to the King of all Kings  
Its Jesus  
Nations will join and men confess  
Declaring Your holy righteousness  
Giving their hearts their lives their all  
To the King of Glory  
Mountains declare and oceans roar  
All of creation stands in awe  
Join with them now in one accord  
Holy is the Lord  
All of the angels stand and sing  
The anthem of heaven loudly rings  
Hear them proclaim this offering  
Holy is the Lord  
Holy is the Lord  
Holy is the Lord
