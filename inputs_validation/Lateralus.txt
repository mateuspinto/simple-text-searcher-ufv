Black then white are all I see in my infancy  
Red and yellow then came to be reaching out to me  
Lets me see  
As below so above and beyond I imagine  
Drawn beyond the lines of reason  
Push the envelope Watch it bend  
  
Over thinking over analyzing separates the body from the mind  
Withering my intuition missing opportunities and I must  
Feed my will to feel my moment drawing way outside the lines  
  
Black then white are all I see in my infancy  
Red and yellow then came to be reaching out to me  
Lets me see there is so much more  
And beckons me to look through to these infinite possibilities  
As below so above and beyond I imagine  
Drawn outside the lines of reason  
Push the envelope Watch it bend  
  
Over thinking over analyzing separates the body from the mind  
Withering my intuition leaving all these opportunities behind  
  
Feed my will to feel this moment urging me to cross the line  
Reaching out to embrace the random  
Reaching out to embrace whatever may come  
  
I embrace my desire to  
Feel the rhythm to feel connected  
Enough to step aside and weep like a widow  
To feel inspired to fathom the power  
To witness the beauty to bathe in the fountain  
To swing on the spiral  
Of our divinity and still be a human  
  
With my feet upon the ground I lose myself  
Between the sounds and open wide to suck it in  
I feel it move across my skin  
Im reaching up and reaching out  
Im reaching for the random or what ever will bewilder me  
And following our will and wind we may just go where no ones been  
Well ride the spiral to the end and may just go where no ones been  
  
Spiral out Keep going going
