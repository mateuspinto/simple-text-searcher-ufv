Down the street you can hear her scream  
YOURE A DISGRACE  
As she slams the door in his drunken face  
And now he stands outside  
And all the neighbours start to gossip and drool  
  
He cries oh girl you must be mad  
What happened to the seet love you and me had  
Against the door he leans and starts A scene  
And his tears fall and burn the garden green  
  
And so castles made of sand  
Fall in the sea eventually  
  
A little indian brave who before he was ten  
Played war games in the woods with his indian friends  
And he built A dream that when he grew up  
He would be A fearless warrior indian chief  
  
Many moons passed and the dream grew strong until tomorrow  
He would sing his first war song  
And fight his first battle but something went wrong  
Surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night  
  
And so castles made of sand  
Melts into the sea eventually  
  
There was A young girl whose heart was A frown  
Because she was crippled for life and couldnt speak A sound  
And she wished and prayed she would stop living  
So she decided to die  
She drew her wheel chair to the edge of the shore  
And to her legs she smiled  
YOU WONT HURT ME NO MORE  
But then A sight shed never seen made her jump and say  
LOOK A GOLDEN WINGED SHIP IS PASSING MY WAY  
And it really didnt have to stop  
It just kept on going  
  
And so castles made of sand  
Slips into the sea eventually
