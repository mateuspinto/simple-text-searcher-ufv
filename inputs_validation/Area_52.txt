Message came from outer space  
Future of the human race  
Help is not gonna hide its face  
Let it go shed your skin  
Children never sleep again  
  
You want me for passenger  
Take me as your prisoner  
I want to be an alien  
Take me please oh alien  
I wanna be an alien  
Take me oh oh  
  
Your instruments cant stop our ships  
Soon youll be up in a fix  
The rest will all rule the nest  
Let it go have your day  
Spacemen take your cans away  
  
I wanna be your passenger  
Take me as your prisoner  
I wanna be an alien  
Take me please oh alien  
I wanna be an alien  
Take me please oh alien  
  
You must taste our violent fuzz  
Your wars are of no use to us  
You cannot fix what never was  
Let it go have your day  
The media is on its way  
  
I wanna be your passenger  
Take me as your prisoner  
I wanna be an alien  
Take me please oh alien  
I wanna be an alien  
Take me please oh alien
