How do you feel  
Now theyve swapped that good old carthorse for a car  
How do you feel  
Now hes handed in his sword and taken a dart  
Are your tiny hands starting to warm  
Does your battered heart feel less torn  
  
Enter perfect couple he owns all the keys  
He shows her white knuckle she shows bleeding knees  
As long as he agrees  
  
How do you feel  
Now theyve swapped your concrete cell for a padded one  
How do you feel  
Now every single dream you had is gone  
Does this decay bring you to life  
Well I think it probably might  
Enter perfect couple he owns all the keys  
He shows her white knuckle she shows bleeding knees  
Enter perfect couple he owns all the keys  
The blood pours from her knees  
  
You and your big ideas again  
Tell me how do you feel
