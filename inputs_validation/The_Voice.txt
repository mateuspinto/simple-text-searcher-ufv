Wont you take me back to school  
I need to learn the golden rule  
Wont you lay it on the line  
I need to hear it just one more time  
  
Oh wont you tell me again  
Oh can you feel it  
Oh wont you tell me again tonight  
  
Each and every heart it seems  
Is bounded by a world of dreams  
Each and every rising sun  
Is greeted by a lonely one  
  
Oh wont you tell me again  
Oh can you feel it  
Oh wont you tell me again tonight  
  
Cause out on the ocean of life my love  
There a so many storms we must rise above  
Can you hear the spirit calling as its carried across the waves  
Youre already falling its calling you back to face the music  
And the song that is coming through  
Youre already falling the one that its calling is you  
  
My a promise take a vow  
And trust your feelings it easy now  
Understand The Voice within  
And feel a change already beginning  
  
Oh wont you tell me again  
Oh can you feel it  
Oh wont you tell me again tonight Tonight  
  
Oh wont you tell me again  
Oh can you feel it  
Oh wont you tell me again tonight  
  
And how many words have I got to say  
And how many times will it be this way  
With your arms around the future and your back up against the past  
Youre already falling its calling you on to face the music  
And the song that is coming through  
Youre already falling the one that its calling is you  
  
Each and every heart it seems  
Is bounded by a world of dreams  
Each and every rising sun  
Is greeted by a lonely lonely one  
  
Wont you tell me again  
Oh can you feel it  
Oh wont you tell me again tonight
