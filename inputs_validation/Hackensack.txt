I used to know you when we were young  
You were in all my dreams  
We sat together in period one  
Fridays at 8 15  
Now I see face in the strangest places  
Movies and magazines  
I saw you talkin to Christopher Walken  
On my tv screen  
  
I will wait for you  
As long as I need to  
And if you ever get back to Hackensack  
Ill be here for you  
  
I used to work in a record store  
Now I work for my dad  
Scraping the paint off of hard wood floors  
The hours are pretty bad  
Sometimes I wonder where you are  
Probably in L A  
That seems to be where everybody else ends up these days  
  
I will wait for you  
As long as I need to  
And if you ever get back to Hackensack  
Ill be here for you  
  
I will wait for you  
As long as I need to  
And if you ever get back to Hackensack  
Ill be here for you  
If you ever get back to Hackensack  
Ill be here for you
