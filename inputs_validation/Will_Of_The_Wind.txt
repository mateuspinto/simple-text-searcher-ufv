The voices in the wind  
Will take you home again  
The journey home has just begun by friend  
  
The magic in your eyes  
Was more than I surmised  
And I surrender time and time again  
  
To the will of the wind  
The will of the wind child  
The wind in the wind chimes  
Takes you home again  
  
The will of the wind  
The will of the wind child  
The wind in the wind chimes  
Takes you home again  
  
The will of the wind
