Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy do you hear what I hear  
Ringing through the night shepherd boy do you hear what I hear  
A song a song high above the trees with a voice as big as the sea  
With a voice as big as the sea  
Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king do you know what I know  
In your palace warm mighty king do you know what I know  
A child a child shivers in the cold let us bring him silver and gold  
Let us bring him silver and gold  
Said the king to the people everywhere listen to what I say  
Pray for peace people everywhere listen to what I say  
A child a child sleeping in the night he will bring us goodness and light  
He will bring us goodness and light
