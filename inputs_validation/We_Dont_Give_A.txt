Sick motherfuckers  
Go head throw up nigga  
Yea yea OK I know you  
I know I know  
  
If you wanna have smaller digits  
The kid was never a playa hata or baller bigit  
Every week pay em all a visit  
I bring Pamela Lee to the Ps so we all can dig it  
I popped enough alcohol so we all could swig it  
Guns stand them up they be as tall as midgets  
Ok Ill rap a little faster  
But do I really sound like I turned from a rapper to a pastor  
Im like you except I date supermodels  
The cars that I drive the state troopers follow  
We get the same parties probably  
My stones look like sunshine yours probably cloudy  
And I dont front for nothin  
I likes I gets I want for nothin  
Im givin ya straight answers  
And Id rather be dead than livin wit hate cancer  
  
Chorus  
Say wha you wanna say talk wha you wanna talk  
We dont give a fuck  
Look how you wanna look grill if you wanna grill  
We dont give a fuck  
Act how you wanna act front if you wanna front  
We dont give a fuck  
Live how you wanna live cry if you wanna die  
We dont give a fuck  
  
I just used to post on the corner roast marijuana  
Id be on the coast of Tawanna  
Bitches who look close to Madonna  
Dosie cabanna toast by a   
I posed to be wanna of those dudes ridin in Testaroastas upon ya  
Not the  but Im gonna I keep toastin the armor  
For niggas who supposed to be drama  
I mostly just wanna get fed garlic toast and lasagna  
Get head while Ill roast in a sauna  
FABOLOUS how can you hate that  
And I hit the  wit the scandals  
Cause its all bullshit my attorneys can handle  
Ya insides be burnin like candles  
Rippin down posters turnin the channels  
You wanna end up on the ern on the mantle nigga yea  
  
Chorus  
  
I look at these brothers and laugh  
Jealous niggas dont hate havin just others that have  
I still got love for the av  
Come through to give ya niggas girls baby mothers my math  
I speak on others behalf only hate makin money  
And gotta give the government half  
You know this brother live last  
And not even Mike seen Jordans in the colors I have  
I used to run from under covers like Shaft  
That was until this young playa got shoved into the draft  
Now Im covered in ice like Bruce Lees body  
Niggas is scared to lose these hotties  
Talk if you wanna talk grill if you wanna grill  
We dont give a fuck nigga  
Front if you wanna front try if you wanna die  
If you live its luck nigga  
  
Chorus
