In your white lace  
And your wedding bells  
You look the picture  
Of contented new wealth  
  
But from the onlooking fool  
Who believed your lies  
I wish this grave would open up  
And swallow me alive  
  
For the bitterest pill  
Is hard to swallow  
The love I gave hangs  
In sad colored mocking shadows  
  
When the wheel of fortune broke  
You fell to me  
Out of gray skies  
To change my misery  
  
The vacant spot  
Your beating heart took its place  
But now I watch smoke  
Leave my lips and fill an empty room  
  
For the bitterest pill  
Is hard to swallow  
The love I gave hangs  
In sad colored mocking shadows  
  
The bitterest pill  
Is mine to take  
If I took if for a hundred years  
I couldnt feel any more hate  
  
The bitterest pill  
Is mine to take  
If I took if for a hundred years  
I couldnt feel any more hate  
  
Now autumns breeze blows  
Summers leaves through my life  
Twisted and broken dawn  
No days with sunlight  
  
The dying spark  
You left your mark on me  
The promise of your kiss  
But with someone else  
  
For the bitterest pill  
Is mine to swallow  
The love I gave hangs  
In sad colored mocking shadows  
  
The bitterest pill  
Is mine to take  
If I took if for a hundred years  
I couldnt feel anymore ill  
  
The bitterest pill  
Is mine to take  
If I took if for a hundred years  
I couldnt feel anymore ill  
  
The bitterest pill  
Is mine to take  
If I took if for a hundred years  
I couldnt feel anymore ill  
  
The bitterest pill  
Is mine to take  
If I took if for a hundred years  
I couldnt feel anymore ill
