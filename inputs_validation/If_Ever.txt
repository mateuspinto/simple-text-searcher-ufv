Id sing you a song without a word  
Still you would hear my tune  
Id give you a day without a time  
So it wont end too soon  
  
Anything I would do  
And that really is my point of view  
If ever my darling in my life  
I ever had a chance to love you  
  
Id build you a world made of the dream  
That dances on your head  
Take a rainbow with colours bright  
To hang over your head  
  
Anything I would do  
And that really is my point of view  
If ever my darling in my life  
I ever had a chance to love you  
  
Fates been waiting for the right time  
To put us in each others arms  
But why should we sit and waste time  
To start right now would do no harm  
  
Give me a sign and I will show you  
The magic of when I speak  
Open your heart let me come in  
My love is yours to keep  
  
Anything I would do  
And that really is my point of view  
If ever my darling in my life  
I ever had a chance to love you  
  
If I ever had a chance to love you  
If I ever had a chance to love you
