Im sitting here lonely like a broken man  
I serve my time doin the best I can  
Walls and bars they surround me  
But I dont want no sympathy  
  
No baby no baby  
All I need is some tender lovin  
To keep me sane in this burning oven  
And when my time is up youll be my reefer  
  
Life gets worse on Gods green earth  
Be my reefer got to keep smokin that thing  
No no no no no no  
No no no no no no no  
  
I said now baby baby let me smoke it smoke it  
Makes me feel good feel good yes I feel good ah  
Yes I feel alright feel alright yes I feel alright feel alright  
Yes I feel alright ah  
Oh  
  
Ice cold water is runnin through my veins  
They try and drag me back to work again  
Pain and blisters on my mind and hands  
I work all day making up burlap bags  
  
The oats theyre feeding me are driving me wild  
I feel unhappy like a new born child  
Now when my time is up you wait and see  
These walls and bars wont keep that stuff from me  
  
No no baby  
Wont keep that stuff from me  
No no no no no no no no no no  
No no no no no no no  
  
I need you right now mama  
I need you right now baby  
Right by my side honey  
All night long  
  
Make me feel alright  
Yes all yes all yes all alright  
  
You better come on up and get down with me  
Ill make you feel real good just you wait and see  
  
Make me feel alright yes I feel alright  
Yes all yes all yes alright
