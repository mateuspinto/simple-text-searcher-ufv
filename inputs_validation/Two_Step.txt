Say my love I came to you with best intentions  
You laid down and gave to me just what Im seeking  
Love you drive me to distraction  
  
Hey my love do you believe that we might last a thousand years  
Or more if not for this  
Our flesh and blood  
It ties you and me right up  
Tie me down  
  
Celebrate we will  
Because life is short but sweet for certain  
Were climbing two by two  
To be sure these days continue  
These things we cannot change  
  
Hey my love you came to me like wine comes to this mouth  
Grown tired of water all the time  
You quench my heart and you quench my mind  
  
Celebrate we will  
Because life is short but  
Sweet for certain  
Were climbing two by two  
To be sure these days continue  
The things we cannot  
Celebrate you and me climbing two by two to be sure  
These days continue things we cannot change  
  
Oh my love I came to you  
With best intentions  
You laid down and gave to me  
Just what Im seeking  
  
Celebrate we will  
Because life is short  
But sweet for certain  
Were climbing two by two  
To be sure these days continue  
Things we cannot change  
Things we cannot change
