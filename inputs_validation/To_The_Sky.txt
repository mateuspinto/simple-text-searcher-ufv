Shipwreck in a sea of faces  
Theres a dreamy world up there  
Dear friends in higher places  
Carry me away from here  
  
Travel light let the sun eclipse you  
Cause your flight is about to leave  
And theres more to this brave adventure  
Than youd ever believe  
  
Birdseye view awake the stars cause theyre all around you  
Wide eyes will always brighten the blue  
Chase your dreams and remember me sweet bravery  
Cause after all those wings will take you up so high  
So bid the forest floor goodbye as you race the wind  
And take to the sky you take to the sky  
  
On the heels of war and wonder  
Theres a stormy world up there  
You cant whisper above the thunder  
But you can fly anywhere  
  
Purple burst of paper birds  
This picture paints a thousand words  
So take a breath of myth and mystery  
And dont look back  
  
Birdseye view awake the stars cause theyre all around you  
Wide eyes will always brighten the blue  
Chase your dreams and remember me sweet bravery  
Cause after all those wings will take you up so high  
So bid the forest floor goodbye as you race the wind  
And take to the sky you take to the sky  
  
Theres a realm above the trees  
Where the lost are finally found  
Touch your feathers to the breeze  
And leave the ground  
  
Birdseye view awake the stars cause theyre all around you  
Wide eyes will always brighten the blue  
Chase your dreams and remember me sweet bravery  
Cause after all those wings will take you up so high  
So bid the forest floor goodbye as you race the wind  
And take to the sky  
You take to the sky  
You take to the sky
