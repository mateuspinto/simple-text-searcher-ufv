You are sunlight and i moon  
Joined by the gods of fortune  
Midnight and high noon  
Sharing the sky  
We have been blessed you and i  
  
You are here like a mystery  
Im from a world thats so different  
From all that you are  
How in the light of one night  
Did we come so far  
  
Outside day starts to dawn  
  
Your moon still floats on high  
  
The birds awake  
  
The stars shine too  
  
My hands still shake  
  
I reach for you  
  
And we meet in the sky  
  
You are sunlight and i moon  
Joined here  
Brightning the sky  
With the flame  
Of love  
  
Made of  
Sunlight  
Moonlight  
  
Tomorrow will be the full moon  
I can bring friends to bless our room  
With paper unicorns and perfume  
If you want me to  
  
Unicorns sure
