It happened all so fast heavy with sleep my eyes closed  
The next thing I remember was crawling out from the car and  
Seeing you lying there  
Holding your head kissing you for the last time  
The taste of blood on my lips  
Your clothes torn apart perfumed with gas  
It seems like it was yesterday when the rain poured down  
I can still hear your screams as if it was happening all over again  
Saturday December 4th that night would become a grave  
That would crush my heart  
Joy and laughter exchanged for grief and silence  
Searching for so long to find you and the moment  
You were ripped from me  
Laying here on this empty shelf never to be read again  
In these pages lie every memory of you  
The wind blew your heart over my eyes and I slept for days  
Praying not to awake but these dreams can only last so long  
Facing the day looking through these tears  
Ill always look back and remember that night as you lay there  
Looking over that casket seeing your face times of past rushing  
Touching your cold hand wishing it would touch me back  
You look so pretty lying there just like the first day we met  
It feels so real like old times but its nothing its nothing  
I can taste the stale air on my tongue and death lights up the sky  
Hope finds itself an end stopping at my thoughts  
Pictures of you help bring back the tears  
Walking in the present but living in the past  
How much longer will I embrace sorrow  
From the moment you entered my life  
My whole outlook on love would change  
You brought out a happiness I didnt even know I had  
And now youve gone leaving without a goodbye  
That glass heart that rested in my chest has fallen and shattered  
Here on lord is the remains of a broken heart  
For I have faith you can give me joy and life again  
Death has fallen but love covers me  
Heaven is now home to my angel of love
