Puff Daddy  
Cats hate me cause I mastered this  
PD the one who brought class to this  
I brought a brand new 6 just to blast my disc  
Pockets fool of chips with the glass on the wrist  
Got a mashion in the Hamptons that niggas would kill for but Im never  
really home I live on the billboards  
Cause I remained da most famous Entertiner  
Yacht by the dock jetplane in the hanger  
Haters all hating and the ladies all waiting  
Thats how I stay winning  
You the hottest in the nation  
Getting my bounce on  
Dipped in Sean John  
Chilling in Justins and spilling the Sean Don  
I roll in the Rolls on cruisecontrol  
If you know what I know then you can go where I go  
Got a whole a lot of dough and money in escrow  
Having fun spending ones and watching my sons grow  
Like my nigga Bust said Give Me Some Mo  
We in the record store or you can catch us on tour  
Bad Boy 99 goin shine once more  
Making sure everybody know the time once more

Madd Rapper  
Yo I want to live in the lap of lux with a maid who does windows cooks  
cleans and fucks  
Bust long nuts king sized deluxe  
20 room mashion chauffer with a tux  
See all I want to do is make a little trick money dinner and a flick money  
wet my dick money  
Make a few hit
