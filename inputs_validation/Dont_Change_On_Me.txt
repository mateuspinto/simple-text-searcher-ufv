Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away  
Now it looks as though theyre here to stay  
Oh I believe in yesterday  
Suddenly Im not half the man I used to be  
Theres a shadow hanging over me  
Oh yesterday came suddenly  
Why she had to go I dont know  
She wouldnt say  
I said something wrong  
Now I long for yesterday  
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play  
Now I need a place to hide away  
Oh I believe in yesterday  
Why she had to go I dont know  
She wouldnt say  
I said something wrong  
Now I long for yesterday  
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play  
Now I need a place to hide away  
Oh I believe in yesterday
