The one you love  
The one you care for  
Has told you everything  
You ever lived for  
The one you love  
Just walked into your life  
She said hold me and keep me warm  
Hold me for ever and keep me from harm  
Hold me and keep me warm  
Hold me for ever in your loving arms  
cause I love you  
And I need you  
And I want you here for evermore  
Im just so crazy about you  
The one you love  
The one you prayed for  
Brought you an angel  
And the angel stayed for  
The light of love just  
Walked into your life  
She said hold me and keep me warm  
Hold me for ever and keep me from harm  
Hold me and keep me warm  
Hold me for ever in your loving arms  
cause I love you  
And I need you  
And I want you here for evermore  
Im just so crazy about you  
The only one you ever lost your heart for  
The one you cried a million times for  
Your only dream has walked into your life  
She said hold me and keep me warm  
Hold me for ever and keep me from harm  
Hold me and keep me warm  
Hold me for ever in your loving arms  
cause I love you  
And I need you  
And I want you here for evermore  
Im just so crazy about you
