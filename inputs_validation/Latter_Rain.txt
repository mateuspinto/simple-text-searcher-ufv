This is the hour the time has come  
His Spirit calls He calls us on  
To make this land holy for the Lord  
  
This is the time to seize the day  
We rise in faith the promise comes  
To make this land holy to the Lord  
  
These are the days of the latter rain  
Days of power days of grace  
This is the time the fire will fall  
To make this land holy  
To make this land holy to the Lord  
  
This is the time our finest hour  
Of battles fought and victories won  
To make this land holy to the Lord  
  
And from this time our future calls  
The promise sure the rain will fall  
We see this land holy to the Lord
