Its been nice to hold your hand  
As we shifted through this twisted abandon  
I would like to think that you will know your way  
We have dodged the ropes of rain  
Well the cats and dogs well they love to play  
On the handsome fella with umbrella  
Who once saved you your day  
  
And I will ask you to open my door from your side  
From the inside after you drive  
Because I wanna stay wet for a little bit longer  
Thats why  
  
I warm the engine compartment up  
While I stand here and think it up  
But its a little too early to bury the worries  
Til this wish is my command  
  
And I wonder wonder which one of us  
Is gonna state the obvious  
And I wonder if you already know  
That I gotta let you go  
  
I know this aint the way I planned it  
I guess I aint the great romantic  
And Im not doubling back now  
No doubling back  
Doubling back now  
  
Well before I catch you complaining that it hardly rains at all  
Let me stop to lock the top  
For fear of it falling hard  
By the eyes were ears and the arms are  
Scars of where the war was waged on words that we heard as a joke  
How did it drown our love  
  
Oh lord  
When it rains its sure to pour  
But when I look in your eyes  
I fear I wont see surprise  
That Im not doubling back cause  
I wonder wonder which one of us  
Is gonna state the obvious  
And then I wonder if you already know  
That I gotta let you go  
  
I know this aint the way I planned it  
I guess I aint the great romantic  
And Im not doubling back now  
No doubling back now  
Doubling back now  
No doubling back now  
Doubling back now  
No doubling back now  
Doubling back now  
No doubling back now  
Doubling back now  
No doubling back now  
Doubling back now  
No doubling back now  
No turning around now  
No going back now  
No
