Sometimes I get so weird  
I even freak myself out  
I laugh myself to sleep  
Its my lullaby  
Sometimes I drive so fast  
Just to feel the danger  
I want to scream  
It makes me feel alive  
  
Is it enough to love  
Is it enough to breathe  
Somebody rip my heart out  
And leave me here to bleed  
Is it enough to die  
Somebody save my life  
Id rather be anything but ordinary please  
  
To walk within the lines  
Would make my life so boring  
I want to know that I  
Have been to the extreme  
So knock me off my feet  
Come on now give it to me  
Anything to make me feel alive  
  
Is it enough to love  
Is it enough to breath  
Somebody rip my heart out  
And leave me here to bleed  
Is it enough to die  
Somebody save my life  
Id rather be anything but ordinary please  
Id rather be anything but ordinary please  
  
Let down your defenses  
Use no common sense  
If you look you will see  
That this world is a beautiful  
Accident turbulent succulent  
Opulent permanent no way  
I want to taste it  
Dont want to waste it away  
  
Sometimes I get so weird  
I even freak myself out  
I laugh my self to sleep  
Its my lullaby  
  
Is it enough  
Is it enough  
Is it enough to breath  
Somebody rip my heart out  
And leave me here to bleed  
Is it enough to die  
Somebody save my life  
Id rather be anything but ordinary please  
  
Is it enough  
Is it enough to die  
Somebody save my life  
Id rather be anything but ordinary please  
Id rather be anything but ordinary please
