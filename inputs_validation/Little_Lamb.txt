Little lamb little lamb  
My birthday is here at last  
Little lamb little lamb  
My birthday goes by so fast  
Little bear little bear  
You sit on my right right there  
Little hen little hen  
What game should we play and when  
Little cat little cat  
Oh why do you look so blue  
Did somebody paint you like that  
Or is your birthday too  
Little fish little fish  
Do you think Ill get my wish  
Little lamb little lamb  
I wonder how old I am  
I wonder how old I am  
Little lamb
