You rest your mind  
Flying to the home that you knew  
You made you past  
Trying to get home in as few but  
All the time  
Your mind is just aching for  
All the time  
You cant stop but faking it  
All the time  
Your mind is just breaking your heart  
You rest you heart  
Oh listen to me  
You can be bout anywhere  
You can take you mind anyplace because  
Your minds open the rest is up to you  
You can dream bout any dream  
You can take safaris right up into the skys open  
The rest is up to you  
You can do it  
You can dream it all  
Sing it in your heart  
Dont have to be lonely  
You can do it  
You can feel it all  
Breakin in your heart  
Dont have to be lonely  
You can do it  
You can leave it all  
Make another start  
You can be bout anywhere  
You can take you mind anyplace because  
Your minds open the rest is up to you  
You can dream bout any dream  
You can take safaris right up into the skys open  
The rest is up to you  
Might wind up just anywhere  
Might wind up just anywhere  
Might wind up just anywhere
