You have lived such a gentle life upon this earth  
that I am stunned by your sight  
If I could give but a token of the love you have  
then I might not be this lonely tonight  
  
Let them have their smug and their cool confined by fashion and peer  
I love you for your courage in this frightened atmosphere  
I love you for your courage in this frightened atmosphere  
  
Oh there are so few brave ones like you Need I explain  
Never wondering what to do what to venture what to gain  
  
And you have loved in a total way from flesh to soul  
You speak without coy without pose  
Your eyes can see that the emperor has lost his clothes  
And whats more youll tell the whole world what he stole  
  
Let them have their fad and their fix confined by fashion and peer  
I love you for your courage in this frightened atmosphere  
I love you for your courage in this frightened atmosphere
