As blue shadows fall  
Across the canyon wall  
The cattle are quiet and still  
Dusty sore and tired  
I build myself a fire  
As a full moon  
Peaks over the hills  
  
A blanket for my bed  
A saddle for my head  
Ill sleep  
But in my dreams Ill stray  
Back across the miles  
To where my darlin smiles  
In memories of old Santa Fe  
  
Adios mi corinyo  
She told me that day  
As I kissed her softly  
And then rode away  
Now I lie beneath the stars  
Without her in my arms  
So lonesome  
And so far away  
But each night  
I go back there  
In my dreams  
And in my prayers  
And in memories of old Santa Fe  
  
Adios mi corinyo  
She told me that day  
As I kissed her softly  
And then rode away  
  
Shes waitin  
There I know  
But for now  
All I can hold  
Are my memories  
Of old Sata Fe
