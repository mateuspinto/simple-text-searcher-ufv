O Lord You are my God  
I will exalt Thee  
I will praise Thy Name  
O Lord You are my God  
I will exalt Thee  
I will praise Thy Name  
  
In perfect faithfulness is Thy plan  
Revealed in wonders unto man  
All will honor  
All revere Thy holy Name  
  
You are a refuge for the poor  
You are the shelter in the storm  
In your shadow  
Is the song of evil stilled  
  
And on Thy mountain shall we dine  
The finest food Lord the finest wine  
Such a banquet  
You have offered unto us  
  
And on Thy mountain is the shroud  
Dispelled by You Lord as a cloud  
Death is conquered  
We are saved from our disgrace  
  
And at the end time Judgment Day  
All true believers they will say  
We have trusted  
Our salvation is through God
