Well the House of Cash just burned down  
All the way to the cold hard ground  
The doctors came from all over town  
To see the memories scattered all around  
  
Then the stars came out by the light of day  
And they heard their old friend passed away  
That yard looked like a funeral hall  
Without the pies and casseroles  
  
Chorus  
Well its goodbye Johnny goodbye June  
Goodbye fancy living room  
Well no one sleeps in Cashs bed  
Except the man in black and the woman he wed  
And the ring of fire comes full circle  
And the ring of fire comes all the way around  
  
And if those ashes in the pool could talk  
To the anchor man out on the walk  
Id bet theyd be happy to announce  
Therell be no yard sale now  
  
Chorus  
  
And the ring of fire comes full circle  
And the ring of fire comes all the way around
