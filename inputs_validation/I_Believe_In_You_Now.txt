Once upon a time  
I was faithless strutting blind  
Through the valley of the lost  
So now you find it rather strange  
When you hear me claim the name  
Of the one who bears the cross and I say  
  
Chorus  
I believe in You now  
A new light is showing me how  
I used to walk in the shadows of doubt  
But I believe in you now  
  
Will there ever come a day  
When you follow in the way  
Of the truth that sets you free  
To where the thunder of a voice  
And the echo of a choice  
Will bring you to your knees  
No longer running through the night  
A conversion to the light  
Giving way to disbelief and you say  
  
Chorus
