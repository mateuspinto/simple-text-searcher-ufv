Words are flowing out like  
Endless rain into a paper cup  
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe  
Pools of sorrow waves of joy  
Are drifting through my opened mind  
Possessing and caressing me  
  
Jai Guru Deva Om  
Nothings gonna change my world  
Nothings gonna change my world  
Nothings gonna change my world  
Nothings gonna change my world  
  
Images of broken light which  
Dance before me like a million eyes  
They call me on and on across the universe  
Thoughts meander like a  
Restless wind inside a letter box  
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe  
  
Jai Guru Deva Om  
Nothings gonna change my world  
Nothings gonna change my world  
Nothings gonna change my world  
Nothings gonna change my world  
  
Sounds of laughter shades of life  
Are ringing through my opened ears  
Inciting and inviting me  
Limitless undying love which  
Shines around me like a million suns  
It calls me on and on across the universe  
  
Jai Guru Deva  
Jai Guru Deva  
Jai Guru Deva  
Nothings gonna change my world  
Nothings gonna change my world  
Nothings gonna change my world  
Nothings gonna change my world
