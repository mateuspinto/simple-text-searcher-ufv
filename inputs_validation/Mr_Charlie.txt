I take a little powder take a little salt put it in my shotgun I go walkin  
Jubba jubba wolly bully looking high looking low  
Gonna scare you up and shoot ya Mister Charlie told me so  
  
I wont even take your life wont even take a limb  
Just unload my shotgun take a little skin  
Jubba jubba wolly bully looking high looking low  
Gonna scare you up and shoot ya Mister Charlie told me so  
  
Well you take my silver dollar take those silver dimes  
Fix it up together in some alligator wine  
I can hear the drums voodoo all night long  
Mister Charlie tells me I cant do nothing wrong  
Jubba jubba wolly bully looking high looking low  
Gonna scare you up and shoot ya Mister Charlie told me so  
  
Now Mister Charlie told me wont you like to know  
Give you little warning before I let you go  
Jubba jubba wolly bully looking high looking low  
Gonna scare you up and shoot ya Mister Charlie told me so  
Gonna scare you up and shoot ya Mister Charlie Mister Charlie told me so
