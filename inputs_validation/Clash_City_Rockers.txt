An I want to move the town to the Clash city rockers  
You need a little jump of electrical shockers  
You better leave town if you only want to knock us  
Nothing stands the pressure of the Clash city rockers  
  
You see the rate they come down the escalator  
Now listen to the tube train accelerator  
Then you realize that you got to have a purpose  
Or this place is gonna knock you out sooner or later  
  
So dont complain about your useless employment  
Jack it in forever tonight  
Or shut your mouth and pretend you enjoy it  
Think of all the money youve got  
  
An I want to liquefy everybody gone dry  
Or plug into the aerials that poke up in the sky  
Or burn down the suburbs with the halfclosed eyes  
You wont succeed unless you try  
  
You owe me a move say the bells of St Groove  
Come on and show me say the bells of Old Bowie  
When I am fitter say the bells of Gary Glitter  
No one but you and I say the bells of Prince FarI  
No one but you and I say the bells of Prince FarI  
  
An I want to move the town to the Clash city rockers  
You need a little jump of electrical shockers  
You better leave town if you only want to knock us  
Nothing stands the pressure of the Clash city rockers  
Rock rock Clash city rockers
