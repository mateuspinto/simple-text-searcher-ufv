I woke up this morning all cotton mouthed from drinking  
Wonderin how Id made it through the day  
  
Wild eyed and crazy all burnt out from thinkin  
Wonderin how the hell Is gonna say  
  
Goodbye marie  oh goodbye Marie  
Out the window theres a lonesome highway callin me  
It was fun Marie  I gotta run Marie  
If I cannot keep your love  
At least Ill have your memory  
  
Wakin up beside you in the Tijuana mornin  
With that ocean breeze to keep us cool  
  
Three weeks of lovin  21 nights of heaven  
I stayed just long enough to be your fool  
  
Goodbye Marie  oh goodbye Marie  
Out the window theres a lonesome highway callin me  
It was fun Marie  I gotta run Marie  
If I cannot keep your love  
At least Ill have your memory  
  
Por favor pour me One more tequila  
I need all the courage I can find  
  
This time tomorrow Ill be back in Houston  
Thinkin about the girl I left behind
