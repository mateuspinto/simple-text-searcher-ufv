Fiyero  
Eleka nahmen nahmen  
Ah tum ah tum eleka nahmen  
Eleka nahmen nahmen  
Ah tum ah tum eleka nahmen  
  
Let his flesh not be torn  
Let his blood leave no stain  
Though they beat him  
Let him feel no pain  
Let his bones never break  
And however they try  
To destroy him  
Let him never die  
Let him never die  
  
Eleka nahmen nahmen  
Ah tum ah tum eleka nahmen  
Eleka nahmen nahmen  
Ah tum ah tum eleka eleka  
  
What good is this chanting  
I dont even know what Im reading  
I dont even know which trick I ought to try  
Fiyero where are you  
Already dead or bleeding  
One more disaster I can add to my  
Generous supply  
  
No good deed goes unpunished  
No act of charity goes unresented  
No good deed goes unpunished  
Thats my new creed  
My road of good intentions  
Led where such roads always lead  
No good deed  
Goes unpunished

Fiyero  
  
One question haunts and hurts  
Too much too much to mention  
Was I really seeking good  
Or just seeking attention  
Is that all good deeds are  
When looked at with an icecold eye  
If thats all good deeds are  
Maybe thats the reason why  
  
No good deed goes unpunished  
All helpful urges should be circumvented  
No good deed goes unpunished  
Sure I meant well  
Well look at what wellmeant did  
All right enough so be it  
So be it then  
Let all Oz be agreed  
Im wicked through and through  
Since I can not succeed  
Fiyero saving you  
I promise no good deed  
Will I attempt to do again  
Ever again  
No good deed  
Will I do again
