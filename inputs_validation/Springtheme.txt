Good morning my love  
The skies are clearing up today  
Can I kiss you on the boob like I did yesterday  
  
You let me in you let me sin  
You made me cry you got me high  
  
Can I touch you in the nude  
You lookin really good in bed  
How come you aint talkin like we was yesterday  
  
You let me in you let me sin  
You made me cry you got me high  
  
Wake up little wakeup  
Got somethin to say  
Dont move a muscle  
Im gettin dressed and I cant stay  
  
Ohh you let me in you let me sin  
You made me cry you got me high  
  
You let me in you got me high  
Got me high got me high high high  
Good morning love  
Good morning my love
