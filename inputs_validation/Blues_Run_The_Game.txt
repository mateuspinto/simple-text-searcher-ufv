Blues Run the Game Lyrics  
Written by Jackson C Frank  
  
Catch a boat to England baby  
Maybe to Spain  
Wherever I have gone  
Wherever Ive been and gone  
Wherever I have gone  
The blues have run the game  
  
Send out for whisky baby  
Send out for gin  
Me and room service honey  
Me and room service babe  
Me and room service  
Well were living a life of sin  
  
When I aint drinking baby  
You are on my mind  
When I aint sleeping honey  
When I aint sleeping Mama  
When I aint sleeping  
Well you know youll find me crying  
  
Catch a boat to England baby  
Maybe to Spain  
Wherever I have gone  
Wherever Ive been and gone  
Wherever I have gone  
The blues have run the game  
  
Living is a gamble baby  
Lovings much the same  
Wherever I have played  
Wherever I throw those dice  
Wherever I have played  
The blues have run the game  
  
Maybe when Im older baby  
Someplace down the line  
Ill wake up older  
So much older Mama  
Wake up older  
And Ill just stop all my trying  
  
Catch a boat to England baby  
Maybe to Spain  
Wherever I have gone  
Wherever Ive been and gone  
Wherever I have gone  
The blues theyre all the same
