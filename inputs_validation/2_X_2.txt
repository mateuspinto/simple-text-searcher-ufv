One by one they followed the sun  
One by one until there were none  
Two by two to their lovers they flew  
Two by two into the foggy dew  
Three by three they danced on the sea  
Four by four they danced on the shore  
Five by five they tried to survive  
Six by six they were playing with tricks  
  
How many paths did they try and fail  
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail  
How much poison did they inhale  
How many black cats crossed their trail  
Seven by seven they headed for heaven  
Eight by eight they got to the gate  
Nine by nine they drank the wine  
Ten by ten they drank again  
  
How many tomorrows have are they given away  
How many compared to yesterday  
How many more without any reward  
How many more can they afford  
Two by two they stepped into the ark  
Two by two they step in the dark  
Three by three theyre turning the key  
Four by four they turn it some more  
One by one they follow the sun  
Two by two to another rendezvous
