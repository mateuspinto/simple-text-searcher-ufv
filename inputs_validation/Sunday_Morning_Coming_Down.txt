Well I woke up Sunday morning  
With no way to hold my head that didnt hurt  
And the beer I had for breakfast  
Wasnt bad so I had one more for dessert  
Then I fumbled through my closet  
For my clothes and found my cleanest dirty shirt  
And I shaved my face and combed my hair  
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day  
  
Id smoked my brain the night before on cigarettes and songs  
That Id been pickin  
But I lit my first and watched a small kid cussin at a can  
That he was kickin  
Then I crossed the empty street and caught the Sunday smell  
Of someone fryinchickin  
And it took me back to somethin that I had lost somehow  
Somewhere along the way  
  
Chorus  
On the Sunday morning sidewalk wishin Lord that I was stoned  
Cause there is something in a Sunday makes a body feel alone  
And there is nothing short of dien half a lonesome as the sound  
On the sleepin city sidewalks Sunday morning coming down  
  
In the park I saw a daddy  
With w laughin little girl who he was swingin  
And I stopped beside a Sunday school  
And listened to a song that they were singin  
Then I headed back for home and somewhere far away  
A lonely bell was ringin  
And it echoed through the canyons like the disappearing dreams  
Of yesterday  
  
Chorus  
On the Sunday morning sidewalk wishing Lord that I was stoned  
Cause there is something in a Sunday make a body feel alone  
And there is nothing short of dien half a lonesome as the sound  
On the sleepin city sidewalks Sunday morning coming do
