instrumental intro  
Oh my darling will you come to me  
Shaking now just like a willow tree  
So tell me whats the story  
This track well ride to glory  
Coming home  
Pretty karla and her russian clothes  
Clapboard house and a different nose  
Love keeps a candle burning  
These steel wheels are turning  
Back for home  
Come in out of the rain  
Come out of the night  
Out on the midnight train  
Midnight train  
Come out of the light  
Come out of the rain  
Riding the midnight train  
Midnight train  
Moscow lights well they dim and glow  
The taste is sweeter than its driven snow  
So tell me whats the story  
This track to ride to glory  
Coming home  
Come out of the rain come out of the lights  
Out on the midnight train midnight train  
Come out of the lights come out in the rain  
Riding the midnight train midnight train  
instrumental  
Oh my darling will you come to me  
Shaking now just like a willow tree  
Come out of the lights come out in the rain  
Riding the midnight train midnight train  
Out of the rain live again riding the midnight train midnight train  
Come of the lights into the rain riding the midnight train midnight train  
One little strange come back again  
instrumental fade out
