Where are all the tricks that people play  
When theyre afraid to say  
I want you to hold on to me  
If I let you go again tonight  
Whose arms will keep me warm  
And take me where I want to be  
But if I lose and then surrender all I know  
What would I do if you decided to let go  
Hopelessly Id stand there with everything all gone  
My head down in my hands  
Just wondering why  
  
CHORUS  
This heart belongs to me  
And I know what I believe  
But now it longs to be  
Only with you  
  
Where are all the words I sometimes say  
When Im afraid to ask  
I want you to hold on to me  
Anyway you want to let me know  
Youre sharing my belief  
Of wanting to hold on to me  
I tell the truth and risk you running from my life  
So much to lose and yet  
You know how hard I try  
Hopelessly Id stand there with everything all gone  
My head down in my hands  
Just wondering why  
  
CHORUS  
  
My love it goes only to one  
This heart belongs to me  
MY love it goes only to one  
This heart belongs to me  
My love  
My love  
This heart belongs to me  
My love my love  
This heart belongs to me
