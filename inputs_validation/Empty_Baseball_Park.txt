Why should I hate you  
After all its been so long  
Since I lived in town  
Let it go for now  
  
Have a drink at your favorite bar til dark  
Stumble into empty baseball park  
Strike one and strike two  
I guess were both out  
  
Stumble past the record store end up at the movies  
Try and think of something else but nothins comin to me  
  
Stumble past the record store end up at the movies  
Try and think of something else but nothins comin to me  
  
You do this to me  
You do this and I oblige  
And I fight  
  
Why should I miss you  
After all its been so long  
Since I felt your kiss  
How did it come to this  
  
Stumble past the record store end up at the movies  
Try and think of something else but nothins comin to me  
  
Stumble past the record store end up at the movies  
Try and think of something else but nothins comin to me  
  
I let you do this to me  
I must be crazy  
I must be crazy  
I must be crazy  
I must be  
I must be  
I must be
