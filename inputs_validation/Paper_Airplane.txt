Ive put it all behind me  
Nothin left to do or doubt  
Some may say  
  
But every silver linin  
Always seems to have a cloud  
That comes my way  
  
Anticipated pleasure  
Or unexpected pain  
No choice I feel  
  
Love is hard to measure  
Hidden in the rain  
Thats why youll find me  
  
Here all alone and still wonderin why  
Waitin inside for the cold to get colder  
And here where its clear that Ive wasted my time  
Hopin to fly cause its almost over now  
  
People come together  
People go their own way  
Love conquers few  
  
And Ill do whatever  
Ill say what I need to say  
Just not for you  
  
How many days should I smile with a frown  
Cause youre not around with the sun on your shoulders  
And how many nights must I wake up alone  
And know in my soul that its almost over now  
  
Love is like a paper airplane  
Flyin in the folded dent  
Ridin high dippin low  
But innocence is fair game  
Im hopin I can hold it in  
Our love will die I know
