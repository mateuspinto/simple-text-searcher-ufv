I went out on the town with a friend last weekend  
His ex girlfriends friend was there alone  
She bought a couple rounds and I got the feeling she could really handle
alcohol  
  
Another one down and headed off the deep end  
The more we drank the less that we had on  
  
And it turns out shes got everything I want but all rolled into one  
She smokes a little home grown drinks a little Cuervo  
Still a little down home there was never a doubt  
Shes got a fast car hotter than a dance bar  
Looking like a rock star shell be the talk of the town  
You know shes got everything I want but all rolled into one  
Gotta get me some  
  
God all mighty look at that body  
Looks just like a sticker on a new Ferrari  
Shes a scene from a Baywatch rerun  
Hotter then a barrel on a squeeze machine gun  
  
Well she can get it lower then a Maserati  
Never seen somebody move that way  
Everywhere she goes theres an instant party  
Everybody wants to know her name  
  
And it turns out shes got everything I want but all rolled into one  
She smokes a little home grown drinks a little Cuervo  
Still a little down home there was never a doubt  
Shes got a fast car hotter then a dance bar  
Looking like a rock star and she likes to go out and  
  
She likes to get her hands up  
Anything to stand on  
Anything to dance on  
Shed be swinging around  
Under the hot lights underneath the spot light  
Keep it going all night  
Shell be the talk of the town  
  
You know shes got everything I want but all rolled into one  
Gotta get me some
