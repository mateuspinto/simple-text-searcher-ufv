To the ground  
Set it all ablaze  
This distancing within our midst  
A hungered conquest to devour  an obsession  your obsession  
The cost is all  
We circumvent this power that was so slowly bled from us  
Such arrogance and failure  
These crimes now lead to your numbered days  
Bulldoze their pedestals  
Ignite their fortress  
To the ground we begin again  
Out drawn out numbered  
To the ground we begin again  
Bulldoze their pedestals  
Ignite their fortress  
To the ground without hesitation  
Bulldoze their pedestals  
Ignite their fortress  
To the ground we begin again  
To the ground  
No question
