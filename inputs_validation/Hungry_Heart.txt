Got a wife and kids in Baltimore Jack  
I went out for a ride and I never went back  
Like a river that dont know where its flowing  
I took a wrong turn and I just kept going  
  
Everybodys got a hungry heart  
Everybodys got a hungry heart  
Lay down your money and you play your part  
Everybodys got a hungry heart  
  
I met her in a Kingstown bar  
We fell in love I knew it had to end  
We took what we had and we ripped it apart  
Now here I am down in Kingstown again  
  
Everybodys got a hungry heart  
Everybodys got a hungry heart  
Lay down your money and you play your part  
Everybodys got a hungry heart  
  
Everybody needs a place to rest  
Everybody wants to have a home  
Dont make no difference what nobody says  
Aint nobody like to be alone  
  
Everybodys got a hungry heart  
Everybodys got a hungry heart  
Lay down your money and you play your part  
Everybodys got a hungry heart
