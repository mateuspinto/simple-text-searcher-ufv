Ah ah ah ah  
  
We come from the land of the ice and snow  
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow  
The hammer of the gods will drive our ships to new lands  
To fight the horde singing and crying  
Valhalla I am coming  
  
On we sweep with treshing oars  
Our only goal will be the western shore  
  
Ah ah ah ah  
  
We come from the land of the ice and snow  
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow  
How soft your fields so green  
We calmed the tides of war  
Can whisper tales of gore  
We are your overlords  
  
On we sweep with treshing oars  
Our only goal will be the western shore
