Well I got my mail late last night  
A letter from a girl who found the time to write  
To her lonesome boy somewhere in the night  
She sent me a railroad ticket too  
To take me to her loving arms  
And the big steel rail  
Gonna carry me home to the one I love  
  
Well I been up tight most every night  
Walking along the streets of this old town  
Not a friend to tell my troubles to  
My good old car she done broke down  
Cause I drove it into the ground  
And the big steel rail gonna carry me home to the one I love  
  
Well look over yonder across the plain  
The big drive wheels apounding along the ground  
Gonna get on board and Ill be homeward bound  
Now I aint had a home cooked meal  
And Lord I need one now  
And the big steel rail gonna carry me home to the one I love  
  
Well I been out here many a long days  
I havent found a place that I could call my own  
Not a two bit bed to lay my body on  
I been stood up I been shook down  
I bin dragged into the sand  
And the big steel rail gonna carry me home to the one I love  
  
Now here I am with my head in the sand  
Walking on the broad highway will you give a ride  
To a lonesome boy who missed the train last night  
I went in town for one last round  
And I gambled my ticket away  
And the big steel rail wont carry me home to the one I love
