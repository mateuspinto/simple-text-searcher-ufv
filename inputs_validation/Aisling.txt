See the bright new moon is rising  
Above the land of black and green  
Hear the rebels voices calling  
I will not die till you bury me  
The aunt upstairs in the bed she is calling  
Why has he forsaken me  
Faded pictures in the hallway  
Which one of them brown ghosts is he  
Bless the wind that shakes the barley  
Curse the spade and curse the plough  
Ive counted years and weeks and days  
And I wish to God I was with you now  
Fare thee well me blackhaired diamond  
Fare thee well me own Aisling  
At night fond dreams of you still haunt me  
Far across the grey north sea  
And the wind it blows from the North and South  
To the East And to the West  
I will be like the wind my love  
For I will know no rest till I return to thee  
1 2 3 telegraph poles  
Standing on the cold black road  
The night is fading into morning  
Give us a drop of your sweet poitin  
The rain was lashing  the sun was rising  
The wind was howling through the trees  
The madness from the mountains crawling  
When I saw you first my own Aisling  
Bless the wind that shakes the barley  
Curse the spade and curse the plough  
Ive counted years and weeks and days  
And I wish to God I was with you now  
Fare thee well my black haired diamond  
Fare thee well my own Aisling  
At night fond dreams of you still haunt me  
Far across the grey north sea
