Nobody knows the way I feel  
This morning this morning  
Nobody knows the way I feel  
This morning this morning  
  
If Id only had my way  
The graveyard would be the place  
My man would lay  
Nobody knows the way I feel this morning  
  
I feel like I could scream and cry  
This morning this morning  
I feel like I could scream and cry  
This morning this morning  
  
I feel like I could scream and cry  
Im true out on it or Id rather die  
Nobody knows the way I feel this morning  
  
I even hate to hear your name  
This morning this morning  
I even hate to hear your name  
This morning this morning  
  
I even hate to hear your name  
I could kill you and take a brown eyed express train  
Nobody knows the way I feel this morning
