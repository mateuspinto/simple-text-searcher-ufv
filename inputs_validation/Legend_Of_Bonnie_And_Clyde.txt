Bonnie was a waitress in a small cafe  
Clyde Barrow was the rounder that took her away  
They both robbed and killed until both loved and died  
So goes the legend of Bonnie and Clyde  
The poem that she wrote of the life that they led  
Told of the lawmen left dying or dead  
Some say that Clyde made her life a shame  
But the legend made Bonnie the head of the game  
The rampage grew wilder with each passing day  
Their odds growing smaller with each getaway  
The end getting closer the harder they fought  
With blood on their hands they were bound to get caught  
  
They drove back from town on one bright summer day  
When a man they befriended stepped out in the way  
With no thought of dying they both took his side  
But the death lay there waiting for Bonnie and Clyde  
Now two years of running was ended that day  
For robbing and killing they both had to pay  
Well always remember how they lived and died  
So goes the legend of Bonnie and Clyde Bonnie and Clyde Bonnie and Clyde
