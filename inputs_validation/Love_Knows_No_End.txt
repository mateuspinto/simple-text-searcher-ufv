I lift my eyes to see Your face  
I know my help is in Your Name  
In everything  
Held by hands  
Of mercy  
  
And I will run and not grow weary  
I will rise in God my strength  
My heart will trust  
For all my hope  
Is Christ alone  
  
Now my soul sings  
Your love it knows no end  
Your love it knows no end  
Your love it knows no end  
  
I will love for You have loved  
I will forgive as You forgive  
Your love prevails  
You fill my life  
With hope again  
  
Now my soul sings  
Your love it knows no end  
Your love it knows no end  
Your love it knows no end  
X2  
  
You reign forever  
You reign forever  
You are the light unto this world  
X3  
  
Now my soul sings  
Your love it knows no end  
Your love it knows no end  
Your love it knows no end  
X3
