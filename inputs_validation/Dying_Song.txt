Ive seen you breathe life into the weakest of hearts  
And heard you scream out loud the sweetest poem  
Echoing across the ocean reminding me why I still try  
To hold onto whatever is left of you and I  
  
Shedding skin to a dying song  
We hum along to the evening sun til we are no more  
Little deaths to a dying song  
Sound a lot like life  
  
Ive seen these dreams being crushed by a single thought  
And felt the envy of sadness engulf all warmth  
Barely alive under ice by exchanging sighs  
With tomorrow quivering in the loneliest light  
  
Shedding skin to a dying song  
We hum along to the evening sun til we are no more  
Little deaths to a dying song  
Sound a lot like life and love  
Life and love with you  
  
Crawl back into bed tomorrows trembling at the sight of you and I  
  
Shedding skin to a dying song  
We hum along to the evening sun til we are no more  
Little deaths to a dying song  
Sound a lot like life and love  
Life and love  
Life and love dying song  
Life and love a dying song  
With you a dying song  
With you dying song  
With you dying song  
With you a dying song
