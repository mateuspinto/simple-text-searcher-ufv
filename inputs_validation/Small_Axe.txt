Why boasteth thyself  
Oh evil men  
Playing smart  
And not being clever  
I said youre working iniquity  
To achieve vanity if aso aso  
But the goodness of Jah Jah  
Idureth forever  
  
So if you are the big tree  
We are the small axe  
Ready to cut you down well sharp  
To cut you down  
  
These are the words  
Of my master keep on tellin me  
No weak heart  
Shall prosper  
And whosoever diggeth a pit  
Shall fall in it fall in it  
And whosoever diggeth a pit  
Shall fall in it fall in it  
  
If you are the big tree let me tell you that  
We are the small axe sharp and ready  
Ready to cut you down well sharp  
To cut you down  
  
to cut you down  
to cut you down  
These are the words  
Of my master tellin me that  
No weak heart  
Shall prosper  
And whosoever diggeth a pit  
Shall fall in it uh bury in it  
And whosoever diggeth a pit  
Shall bury in it uh bury in it  
  
If you are the big big tree  
We are the small axe  
Ready to cut you down well sharp  
To cut you down  
If you are the big big tree let me tell you that  
We are the small axe  
Ready to cut you down well sharp  
To cut you down  
Sharpened
