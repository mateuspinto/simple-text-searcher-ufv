Well I took a fifth and I poured me a shot  
And I thought about all the things that I havent got  
And I drank that down and I poured me some more  
Kept drinking and pouring till I felt the floor  
  
I got drunk and I fell down  
I got drunk and I fell down  
  
Another slow day in this damn town  
Keep asking yourself why am I still hangin around  
You spend half your time just staring into a beer  
What you need you know you cant find here  
  
I got drunk and I fell down  
I got drunk and I fell down  
  
Well I took a fifth and I poured me a shot  
And I thought about all the things that I havent got  
And I drank that down and I poured me some more  
Kept drinking and pouring till I felt the floor  
  
I got drunk and I fell down  
I got drunk and I fell down  
  
I got drunk and I fell down  
I got drunk and I fell down
