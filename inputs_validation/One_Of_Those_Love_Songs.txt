When youre far from me theres a melody  
That always brings me closer to you  
Our own symphony just for you and me  
And I hope they play it real soon  
Everytime I wish that we were dancing slow  
Thats when I hear our song on the radio I know  
  
This is one of those love songs  
That you hear in the middle of the night  
Makes me want to be with you wherever you are tonight  
And whoevers listening just hold your lover tight  
Cause this is one of those love songs  
One of those love songs  
  
As the days turned into years we had our share of tears  
But they never seem to last long  
Cause the sadness disappears  
Everytime I hear our favorite love song  
Now the candles burn as I lay here in my bed  
As the melody keeps playin over and over in my head  
  
This is one of those love songs  
That you hear in the middle of the night  
Makes me want to be with you wherever you are tonight  
And whoevers listening just hold you lover tight  
Cause this is one of those love songs  
  
That you never want to end  
And you hope the DJ plays again  
And again  
  
This is one of those love songs  
That you hear in the middle of the night  
Makes me want to be with you wherever you are tonight  
And whoevers listening just hold your lover tight  
Cause this is one of those love songs  
One of those love songs
