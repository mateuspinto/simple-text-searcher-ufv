I saw a vision  
Little boy  
You covered up your own insights  
But I may have held your hand  
Or seen the ghost you tried to fight  
  
Oh a vision  
Little boy  
You strayed down to find the clowns  
Oh and when I wrote these lines for you  
Not not one of them was found  
  
Blame the circus and the clowns  
Before you blame yourself  
Cause when your greatest needs go unforgiven  
And your gifts go unreceived  
  
Little boy  
Man of need  
Who could know that the road would fall  
Not me not one of us  
That surrounds your golden walls  
  
So now blame the circus and the clowns  
Before you blame yourself  
Cause all your greatest needs go unforgiven  
All your gifts go unreceived  
  
Who could know of the fall  
Who could slow the speed  
Who could hold your hand  
We all laughed and thought you were so free  
  
Vision boy  
Man of need  
Oh do the monkeys get you down  
Oh they promise you the dance of life  
Complete with laughters crown  
  
Little boy  
Man of need  
Did you find the freak show and a crowd  
I said cut the canvas on the tent  
Oh we were all innocent  
  
Blame the circus and the clowns  
Before you blame yourself  
When your greatest needs go unforgiven  
And your gifts go unreceived  
Oh your greatest needs go unforgiven  
And your gifts they go unreceived  
  
Little boy  
Man of need
