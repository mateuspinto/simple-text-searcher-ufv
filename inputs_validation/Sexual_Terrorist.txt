What does a woman need from a man   
Notches on her belt   
But any way to understand  
What isnt known but only felt  
  
Well its a strange world were living in  
Sometimes it feels like a war  
Well its a strange world not giving in  
Who are we doing it for   
Who are we doing it for   
  
Why take it lying down   
Who told you life was fair   
Just leave yourself in the lost and found  
It doesnt matter where  
  
But its a strange world and its alright  
Sometimes it feels like a war  
Well its a strange world but not tonight  
Who are we doing it for   
Who are we doing it for   
  
Sexual terrorist  
Sometimes I feel like the enemy  
Sexual terrorist  
Who do you pretend to be doing it for  
Doing it for   
  
What does a woman need from a man   
Notches on her belt   
But any way to understand  
What isnt known but only felt  
  
Well its a strange world were living in  
Sometimes it feels like a war  
No change there not giving in  
Who are we doing it for   
Who are we doing it for   
Who are we doing it for   
  
Oh sexual terrorist  
Sometimes I feel like the enemy  
Sexual terrorist  
Sometimes I feel like the enemy  
  
Sexual terrorist  
Sometimes I feel like the enemy  
Sexual terrorist  
Sometimes I feel like the enemy  
  
Oh sexual terrorist  
Who are we doing it for   
Sexual terrorist  
Who are we doing it for   
  
Sexual terrorist  
Who are we doing it for   
Sexual terrorist  
Who are we doing it for
