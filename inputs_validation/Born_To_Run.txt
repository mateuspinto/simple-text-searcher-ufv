The quiet sadness of the people of the North  
Echoes silently around the cold grey places  
Ecstasies undared  
Tremble upon the edge of the tightly respectably unfulfilled  
Who drink to excess in order to forget what never happened  
  
Brave faces  
Well dressed ordered minds on suicides edge  
Reflected in the rainskimmed slate grey battleship grey hardship grey  
  
Blue grey  
  
And further South and homeless  
Here I am  
Globally altered and dishevelled  
Oh darling Ive done it all  
An antithesis of sorts  
And yet bound together and hopelessly in love  
With the inevitable loss  
And the end  
How can we run from ourselves  
  
Pete A is a nice place to go What were those chords again
