In my heyday  
Young girls wrote to me  
Everybody seemed to have time to devote to me  
Everyone I saw all swore they knew me  
Once upon a song  
Main attraction couldnt buy a seat  
The celebrity celebrities would die to meet  
Ive had every accolade bestowed on me  
And so you see  
  
If I never sing another song  
It shouldnt bother me  
Ive had my share of fame  
You know my name  
  
If I never sing another song  
Or take another bow  
I should get by but Im not sure how  
  
Always posing but you love it all  
Though you have to learn to act like youre above it all  
Everything I did the world applauded  
Once upon a star  
  
Framed citations hang on every wall  
Got a scrapbook full of quotes I cant recall at all  
There were times I felt the world belonged to me  
And so you see  
  
If I never sing another song  
It shouldnt bother me  
Ive had my share of fame  
You know my name  
  
If I never sing another song  
Or take another bow  
I should get by but Im not sure how  
But Im not sure how  
But Im not sure how
