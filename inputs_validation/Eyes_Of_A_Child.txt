Listen hear the sound  
The child awakes  
Wonder all around  
The child awakes  
Now in his life he never must be lost  
No thoughts must deceive him  
In life he must trust  
With the eyes of a child  
You must come out and see  
That your worlds spinning round  
And through life you will be  
A small part of a hope  
Of a love that exists  
In the eyes of a child you will see  
Earth falls far away  
New life awaits  
Time it has no day  
New life awaits  
Here is your dream  
And now how does it feel  
No words will go with you  
And now what is real  
With the eyes of a child  
You must come out and see  
That your worlds spinning round  
And through life you will be  
A small part of a hope  
Of a love that exists  
In the eyes of a child you will see
