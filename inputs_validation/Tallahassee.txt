When you see land  
Out of the window of a train  
Kinda green and grassy  
How in the world can you complain  
Beneath a moon  
You ought to see the way it shines  
Bright beyond compare  
The way it shines upon the pines  
When you hear blue jays chirping high and sassy  
And catch one sniff of southern cooking  
Hanging on the evening air  
Suppers waiting on the table  
When you see folks  
Having their after dinner chats  
All polite and classy  
Gentlemen all remove their hats  
And every smile  
Perfect harmony and peace  
Bids you stay and rest  
Hand the porter your valise  
Get off that train  
Sit down and rest your chassis  
Youre in Tallahassee  
The Cap8ital City of Florida and  
The Southland at its best  
But Dixie at its very best
