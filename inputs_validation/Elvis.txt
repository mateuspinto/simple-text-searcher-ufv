Platinum and felt acrylics  
Skim the paper for the critics  
Babys printing Elvis lyrics  
On the copper bar  
  
Late Motel lounge is singin  
Spotlight on the band thats swingin  
Chateau Marmont memories fading  
Hope is very far  
  
Elvis where are you when I need you most  
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost  
Pick me up and make a toast  
Champagne in the air  
  
Tipping back his head relaxing  
Thank you very much and Im laughing  
All my chantilly lace catchin  
Baby on the chandelier  
  
Sweeping scents and blue hydrangia  
Summer hail and summer stranger  
Baby hes in constant danger  
Help is very far  
  
You look like a Florida Native  
Are you I said at the rate of  
Slow molasses from the State of  
Vermont with the Southern drawl  
  
Elvis where are you when I need you most  
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost  
Pick me up and make a toast  
Champagne in the air  
  
Tipping back his head relaxing  
Thank you very much and Im laughing  
All my chantilly lace is catchin  
On the chandelier  
  
He said he come to welcome warn me  
Gesture diamond to adorn me  
Come to be and see the one and only  
For my final year  
Well thank you  
  
Elvis where are you when I need you most  
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost  
Pick me up and make a toast  
Champagne in the air  
  
Tipping back his head relaxing  
Thank you very much an Im laughing  
All my chantilly lace is catchin  
On that chandelier  
  
Its catchin on that chandelier x2  
  
Where are you when I need you most
