How many times  
Do we tire of all the little battles  
Threaten to call it quits  
Tempted to cut and run  
How many times  
Do we weather out the stormy evenings  
Long to slam the front door  
Drive away into the setting sun  
  
Chorus x2  
Keep going on till dawn  
How many times must another line be drawn  
We could be down and gone  
But we hold on  
  
How many times  
Do we chaff against the repetition  
Straining against the faith  
Measured out in coffee breaks  
How many times  
Do we swallow our ambition  
Long to give up the same old way  
Find another road to take  
  
Chorus  
  
Keep holding on so long  
Cause theres a chance that we might not be so wrong  
We could be down and gone  
But we hold on  
  
How many times  
Do we wonder if its even worth it  
Theres got to be some other way  
Way to get me through the day  
  
Chorus x2
