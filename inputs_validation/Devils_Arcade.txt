Remember the morning we dug up your gun  
The worms in the barrel the hanging sun  
Those first nervous evenings of perfume and gin  
The lost smell on your breath as I helped you get it in  
The rush of your lips the feel of your name  
The beat in your heart the devils arcade  
  
You said Heroes are needed so heroes get made  
Somebody made a bet somebody paid  
The cool desert morning and nothing to save  
Just metal and plastic where your body caved  
The slow games of poker with Lieutenant Ray  
In the ward with the blue walls a sea with no name  
Where you lie adrift with the heroes of the devils arcade  
  
You sleep and you dream your buddies Charlie and James  
And wake with a thick desert dust on your skin  
  
Voice says dont worry Im here  
Just whisper the word tomorrow in my ear  
House on a quiet street a home for the brave  
A glorious kingdom with the sun on your face  
  
Rising from a long night as dark as the grave  
On a thin chain of next moments and something like faith  
On a morning to order a breakfast to make  
A bed draped in sunshine a body that waits  
For the touch of your fingers the end of the day  
  
The beat of your heart the beat of your heart  
The beat of your heart the beat of your heart  
The beat of your heart the beat of her heart  
The beat of your heart the slow burning away  
Of the bitter fires of the devils arcade  
  
Terris Song Begins  
  
Well they built the Titanic to be one of a kind but many ships have ruled the
seas  
They built the Eiffel Tower to stand alone but they could build another if
they please  
Taj Mahal the pyramids of Egypt are unique I suppose  
But when they built you brother they broke the mold  
  
Now the world is filled with many wonders under the passing sun  
And sometimes something comes along and you know its for sure the only one  
The Mona Lisa the David the Sistine Chapel Jesus Mary and Joe  
And when they built you brother they broke the mold  
  
When they built you brother they turned dust into gold  
When they built you brother they broke the mold  
  
They say you cant take it with you but I think that theyre wrong  
Cause all I know is I woke up this morning and something big was gone  
Gone into that dark ether where youre still young and hard and cold  
Just like when they built you brother they broke the mold  
  
Now your death is upon us and well return your ashes to the earth  
And I know youll take comfort in knowing youve been roundly blessed and
cursed  
But love is a power greater than death just like the songs and stories told  
And when she built you brother she broke the mold  
  
That attitudes a power stronger than death alive and burning her stone cold  
When they built you brother
