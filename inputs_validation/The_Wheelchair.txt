What you did to my mother trying to kill me inside of her  
Miriam she died alright but Im still alive  
I was the sister of your fathers in another life  
The father you never knew who saved me years ago  
  
And now Im looking at his son  
A man and his wheelchair living in the past  
No room for life only the dark  
  
I was so close to the end I will never forget the coffin and nails  
But little Abigail is back again  
So young and beautiful while you are living in the past  
A past so dark there is no room for life itself  
And all I see when Im looking at you  
Is where evil always lived and ruled  
  
You almost killed me and now you must pay  
A man and his wheelchair living in the past  
No room for life only the dark  
  
Do you even know who the Hell it is  
You are keeping in the crypt Do you  
Fear and twisted hate then the feeling of being betrayed  
Overwhelmed him  
That child is part of ME  
  
He had to get up get up and out of the wheelchair  
But without his cane Oh he didnt stand a chance  
The cane was in her hand she used it to push him back  
Push him in the chest she was ready for attack  
Then a quick blow to his wrist four five across his back  
One last one hit him in the neck  
  
I cant believe youre still alive  
My God she screamed Ill teach you how to die  
This should light up your worthless little life  
Open up your eyes  
Then she lit the torch  
  
His eyes were burning pain she wanted to hear him scream  
And this was not a dream  
Abigail was out of control  
She was laughing at his every scream  
This was no more the clean revenge it should have been  
  
Abigail was feeling like the ruler of Hell  
The joy of causing pain  
The wheelchair was really on fire  
In the middle of dying Jonathans charred body was  
Falling down
