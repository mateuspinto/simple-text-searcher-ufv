With the fire from the fireworks up above me  
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain at hand  
You run for cover in the Temple of Love  
You run for another but still the same  
For the wind will blow my name across this land  
In the Temple of Love you hide together  
Believing pain and fear outside  
But someone near you rides the weather  
And the tears he cried will rain on  
Walls as wide as lovers eyes  
  
In the Temple of Love Shine like thunder  
In the Temple of Love Cry like rain  
In the Temple of Love Hear my calling  
In the Temple of Love Hear my name  
  
And the devil in a black dress watches over  
My guardian angel walks away  
Life is short and love is always over in the morning  
Black wind come carry me far away  
With the sunlight died and night above me  
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain inside  
You run for cover in the Temple of Love  
You run for another its all the same  
For the wind will blow and throw your walls aside  
  
With the fire from the fireworks up above  
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain  
You run for cover in the Temple of Love  
Shine like thunder cry like rain  
And the Temple of Love grows old and strong  
But the wind blows stronger cold and long  
And the Temple of Love will fall before this  
Black wind calls my name to you no more  
  
In the black sky thunder sweeping under  
Ground and over water sounds of  
Crying weeping will not save your  
Faith for bricks and dreams for mortar  
All your prayers must seem as nothing  
Ninetysix below the wave when  
Stone is dust and only air remains  
  
In the Temple of Love Shine like thunder  
In the Temple of Love Cry like rain  
In the Temple of Love Hear the calling  
And the Temple of Love is falling  
Down  
  
In the Temple of Love Shine like thunder  
In the Temple of Love Cry like rain  
In the Temple of Love Hear my calling  
In the Temple of Love Hear my name  
  
In the black sky thunder sweeping under  
Ground and over water sounds of  
Crying weeping will not save your  
Faith for bricks and dreams for mortar  
All your prayers must seem as nothing  
Ninetysix below the wave when  
Stone is dust and air remains the  
Only haven you can trust and the  
Devil in a black dress watches over  
My guardian angel walks away  
With a gun for a lover and a shot for the pain  
You run for cover in the Temple of Love  
I shine like thunder cry like rain  
And the Temple of Love grows old and strong  
But the wind blows stronger cold and long  
And the Temple of Love will fall before this  
Black wind calls my name to you no more  
  
In the Temple of Love you hide together  
Believing pain and fear outside  
But someone near you rides the weather  
And the tears he cried will rain on  
Walls as wide as lovers eyes  
  
In the Temple of Love Shine like thunder  
In the Temple of Love Cry like rain  
In the Temple of Love Hear the calling  
And the Temple of Love is falling  
Down
