Start spreadin the news Im leavin today  
I want to be a part of it  
New York New York  
These vagabond shoes are longing to stray  
Right through the very heart of it  
New York New York  
  
I want to wake up in a city that never sleeps  
And find Im king of the hill  
Top of the heap  
  
These little town blues are melting away  
Ill make a brand new start of it  
In old New York  
If I can make it there Ill make it anywhere  
Its up to you New York New York  
  
New York New York  
I want to wake up in a city that never sleeps  
And find Im A number one top of the list  
King of the hill A number one  
  
These little town blues are melting away  
Ill make a brand new start of it  
In old New York  
If I can make it there Ill make it anywhere
