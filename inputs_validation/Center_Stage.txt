Laughing in a crown of jewels  
Numbness from a sceptors wound  
Toss and Turn I spin and learn  
Catch yourself before you burn  
A jokers dance before the king  
Jangling beads a silver ring  
Close your eyes and bare the sound  
Jumping up falling down  
  
Falling falling falling falling down  
Look yourself in the eye before you drown  
  
Royal rebels discover you  
Trust you turn there is no truth  
And circle circle why are you scared  
Why a smile instead of tears  
Im gulping smoke to fade away  
Figures floating down to lay  
Meet the joker and the thief  
The king and queen but no relief  
  
Falling Falling Falling Falling down  
Look yourself in the eye before you drown  
  
the king is in the Falling Falling Falling Falling down  
Counting house Look yourself in the eye before you drown  
Counting out his  
Money  
  
the queen is in Falling Falling Falling Falling down  
Her parlour eating Look yourself in the eye before you drown  
Bread and honey  
  
Mary had a little lamb  
  
I cross myself before I die  
The leaping man he asks me why  
well your rhythm is off I reply  
Now you must dance the dance  
That you imply  
Your actions will follow you full circle round  
Your actions will follow you full circle round  
Your actions will follow you full circle round  
Your actions will follow you full circle round  
The higher the leap I said
