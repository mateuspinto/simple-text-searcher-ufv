Feat Barry Manilow  
  
Baby when I met you there was peace unknown  
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb  
I was soft inside  
There was something going on  
You do something to me that I cant explain  
Hold me closer and I feel no pain  
Every beat of my heart  
We got something going on  
Tender love is blind  
It requires a dedication  
All this love we feel needs no conversation  
We can ride it together ah ha  
Making love with each other ah ha  
  
Islands in the stream  
That is what we are  
No one in between  
How can we be wrong  
Sail away with me  
To another world  
And we rely on each other ah ha  
From one lover to another ah ha  
  
I cant live without you if the love was gone  
Everything is nothing when you got no one  
And you walk in the night  
Slowly losing sight of the real thing  
But that wont happen to us and we got no doubt  
Too deep in love and we got no way out  
And the message is clear  
This could be the year for the real thing  
No more will you cry  
Baby I will hurt you never  
We start and end as one  
In love forever  
We can ride it together ah ha  
Making love with each other ah ha  
  
Islands in the stream  
That is what we are  
No one in between  
How can we be wrong  
Sail away with me  
To another world  
And we rely on each other ah ha  
From one lover to another ah ha
