So I found myself in the sun oh yeah  
A hell of a place to end a run oh yeah  
California Im fine  
Somebody check my brain  
Californias all right  
Somebody check my brain  
Check my brain  
  
I walk these streets I creep and I fall oh yeah  
When she sang I answered the call oh yeah  
California Im fine somebody check my brain  
Californias all right somebody check my brain  
Ah tears have filled my bones  
Ah years expended gone  
  
Guitar  
  
I hung my guns and put em away oh yeah  
The trick of the trade and by the way oh yeah  
California Im fine somebody check my brain  
Californias all right somebody check my brain  
  
Ah tears have filled my bones  
Ah years expended gone  
  
Ah tears have filled my bones  
Ah years expended gone  
  
Check my brain check my brain
