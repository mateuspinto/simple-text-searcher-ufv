I have know this preacherman  
For a long time he was a good man  
I have known this judge  
For a long time he was a good man  
I have known this teacher  
For a long time he was a good man too  
But because of the drugs  
Theyve been taking secretly  
Them are in loony houses today  
  
We cannot stand aside and look  
While the nation is going down the drain  
While the nation is going down the drain  
  
Up with hope down with dope  
Up with hope down with dope  
Up with hope down with dope  
We cannot stand aside and look  
While the nation is going down the drain  
We really really cannot stand aside and look while the nation is going down
the drain  
Oh Yo  
  
I am telling you now  
Cocaine no good for you  
Liquor no good for you  
You go sniffling them glue  
No good for you  
They give it to you and say its the sense of knowledge  
  
But I known Ive been around  
For a while  
  
I cannot stand aside  
And look while the nation  
And look while the nation  
Is going down the drain  
Oh yo yo yo  
  
Up with hope down with dope
