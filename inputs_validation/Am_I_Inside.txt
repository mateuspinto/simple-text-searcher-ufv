Loneliness it shadows me quicker than darkness  
Crawls to the surface of my skin visibly surrounded by it  
Black is all I feel so this is how it feels to be free  
Surrounded by empty souls artificial courage used  
And because so once was mine  
I walk this maze alone  
Black is all I feel so this is how it feels to be free  
The mans beside himself mans below himself  
Mans behind himself Am I inside myself  
Chaos and hate shadow me pain it fills me up  
  
Only one thing makes me feel missing better half of me  
Black is all I feel so this is how it feels to be free  
The mans beside himself mans below himself  
Mans behind himself Am I inside myself  
Chaos and hate shadow me hate it fills me up  
Only one thing makes me feel missing better half of me  
Black is all I feel so this is how it feels to be free  
The mans beside himself mans below himself  
Mans behind himself Am I inside myself
