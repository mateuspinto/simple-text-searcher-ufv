Its the Messiah  
  
It must have been something  
Being born in a manger  
With the sheep from the fields  
And stars shining over your head  
It must have been something  
Seeing three wise men  
On their knees before a newborn  
With their eyes all aglow  
Cause in their hearts they know  
Chorus  
Its the Messiah  
Hes come at last  
Its the Messiah  
Hes come at last  
It must have been something  
Speaking the word of your Father  
With the promise of life  
And peace forever  
It must have been something  
Walking the streets of Jerusalem  
With the sins of the world  
On the innocence of a lamb  
But soon everyone will know  
Chorus  
Its the Messiah  
Hes come at last  
Its the Messiah  
Hes with us at last  
Its the Messiah  
Hes come at last  
Its the Messiah  
Hes with us at last
