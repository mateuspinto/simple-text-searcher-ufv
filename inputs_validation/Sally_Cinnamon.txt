Until Sally I was never happy  
I needed so much more  
Rain clouds oh they used to chase me  
Down they would pour  
Join my tears  
Allay my fears  
Sent to me from heaven  
Sally cinnamon  
You are my world  
  
I pop pop pop blow blow bubble gum  
You taste of cherryade  
There is something here you must show me  
From what you are made  
Sugar and spice  
And all things nice  
  
Sent to me from heaven  
Sally cinnamon  
You are my world  
  
Your eyes are gazing back from  
Every little piece of glass  
You seem to smile from every place  
Sally cinnamon  
You are my world  
  
Then I put the letter back in  
The place where it was found  
Its a pocket in a jacket  
On a train in town  
  
Sent to her from heaven  
Sally cinnamon  
Your her world
