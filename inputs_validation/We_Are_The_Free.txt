Intro  
Oh oh oh oh  
  
Verse 1  
Were the forgiven  
Singing redemptions song  
Theres a fire that burns inside  
A fire that burns inside  
Nothing can stop us  
Well be running through the night  
With a fire that burns inside  
A fire that burns inside  
  
Chorus  
We are the free  
The freedom generation  
Singing of mercy  
You are the one who set us all in motion  
Yours is the glory  
Theres a fire in our hearts and it burns for you  
Its never gonna fade away  
We are the free  
And yours is the glory  
Oh Oh Oh Oh  
  
Verse 2  
We are the risen  
Were living alive in you  
And our passion will not die  
No our passion will not die  
Nothing can stop us  
Well keep running through the night  
And our passion will not die  
No our passion will not die

Up from the grave you rose again  
Up from the grave you rose  
And we will Rise up Rise up  
Into the world that you so loved  
Into the world we go  
And we will Rise up Rise up
