Sacrilege and blasphemy set the stage today  
The more insatiable the sex the more swelled our tongues became  
As prehistoric as this seems this is now today  
Talkin about no vision talkin about no dream  
The harlot puddles for her lies from where she speaks  
I look above and see entrails in the sky  
This one aint over until the fat lady dies  
One man rules the earth and rides a seven headed beast  
Ten Diadems to crown them all  
World religion at his feet  
Dreams are told of dreams of old this day would surely come  
So run my child and hide your face  
Once youve been marked youre finished one  
Youve become one  
Youre mine  
Youre one  
I saw a new earth today I saw a former pass away  
I saw a new earth today I saw a former pass away  
Vengeance is mine  
Vengeance is mine  
The Netherworld and Sheol and never satisfied  
So the eyes of man are never satisfied  
I saw a new earth today I saw a former pass away
