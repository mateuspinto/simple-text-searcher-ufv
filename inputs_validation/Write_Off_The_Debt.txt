Write off the debt  
Me say write off the debt  
Me say write off the debt  
And stop the third world a fret  
I say the Im put on too much interest  
Certain man pon the streets cant even buy a little vest  
I said the east and the west them just a build up dem chest  
Certain man in the third world cant even digest a little food  
But no bother take them man deh as no fool  
cause you know say dem teach and go a good school  
Me say lord a god a mercy dem learn up all the rules  
So no bother patronize dem cause all dem need is the tools  
Me say over the millennium me say what a bomb  
Me say a whole heap of right  
Me say a whole heap of wrong  
I say its time to come together and sing we own song  
And make the shooting and all the killing and the fighting  
Have fe done  
I say the im wipe off the lump sum  
You know say me bredren that would a handsome  
So come on fe me posse lets rehearse up this song  
And hope say dem man yah dont take too long  
Me say write off the debt  
Me say write off the debt  
And stop the third world a fret  
Picture a world with no more hurt and pain  
Picture a world where we are all the same  
Maybe not in mind but in spirit  
Must do the right thing to ease the pain  
Yes me breden that would a wicked
