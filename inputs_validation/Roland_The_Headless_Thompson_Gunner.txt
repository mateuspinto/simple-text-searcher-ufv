Roland was a warrior from the Land of the Midnight Sun  
With a Thompson gun for hire fighting to be done  
The deal was made in Denmark on a dark and stormy day  
So he set out for Biafra to join the bloody fray  
  
Through sixtysix and seven they fought the Congo war  
With their fingers on their triggers kneedeep in gore  
For days and nights they battled the Bantu to their knees  
They killed to earn their living and to help out the Congolese  
  
Roland the Thompson gunner  
  
His comrades fought beside him  Van Owen and the rest  
But of all the Thompson gunners Roland was the best  
So the CIA decided they wanted Roland dead  
That sonofabitch Van Owen blew off Rolands head  
  
Roland the headless Thompson gunner  
Norways bravest son  
Time time time  
For another peaceful war  
But time stands still for Roland  
Til he evens up the score  
They can still see his headless body stalking through the night  
In the muzzle flash of Rolands Thompson gun  
In the muzzle flash of Rolands Thompson gun  
  
Roland searched the continent for the man whod done him in  
He found him in Mombassa in a barroom drinking gin  
Roland aimed his Thompson gun  he didnt say a word  
But he blew Van Owens body from there to Johannesburg  
  
Roland the headless Thompson gunner  
The eternal Thompson gunner  
still wandering through the night  
Now its ten years later but he still keeps up the fight  
In Ireland in Lebanon in Palestine and Berkeley  
Patty Hearst heard the burst of Rolands Thompson gun and bought it
