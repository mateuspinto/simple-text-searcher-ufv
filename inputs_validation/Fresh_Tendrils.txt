Long time coming  
It seemed to take me through  
Long time coming  
Many served the few  
And long to taste the shame  
That bows down before you  
  
Long time coming  
It seemed to get me by  
Long time coming  
It seemed to satisfy  
You longed to taste the shame  
That everybody tries  
  
Shame shame  
Throw yourself away  
Give me little bits of  
More than I can take  
If it sits upon your tongue  
Or naked in your eyes  
Give me little bits of  
More than I can try  
  
Long time coming  
It seemed to take me through  
Long time coming  
Many served the few  
And long to taste the shame  
That bows down before you  
  
Shame shame  
Throw yourself away  
Give me little bits of  
More than I can take  
If it sits upon your tongue  
Or naked in your eyes  
Give me little bits of  
More than I can try
