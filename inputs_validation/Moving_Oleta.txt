Moving Oleta was the hardest thing hed done  
The nurses saw an old woman cryin  
But he saw the love of his life  
She dont know where she is  
But she knows this isnt home  
Love is a hard hard road  
  
He met her in the summer of 37  
in a brush arbor down on the Rush Creek shore  
He loved her black hair and the mischief in her smile  
But she won him with her eyes  
  
All the years and children gone  
he still sees her the same  
Love is a hard hard road  
  
He woke up each morning and drove into town  
He stayed all day till her dinner came  
Then he took her to a room leaned on her wheelchair like a walker  
Covered her with a quilt shed made  
Only God and a couple of nurses helped the old man shoulder the load  
Love is a hard hard road  
  
He said They tell me this is all thats left  
Say this hell on Earth is best  
I lost all those reasons and I still dont understand  
He cursed his body old and weak  
Tears of failure burned his cheeks  
He said Oh dont you know I prayed to die before this day  
Love is a hard hard road  
  
Theres a shadow much darker than the valley of death  
When you fear the reaper night not come today  
The line em up in LazEBoys out in the sunroom  
The TV keeps the quiet away  
She cant recall his name and shes the only love hes known  
Love is a hard hard road  
Love is a hard hard road  
Moving Oleta was the hardest thing hed done
