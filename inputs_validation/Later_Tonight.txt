Chorus  
You wait till later  
Till later tonight  
You wait till later till later  
Till later tonight  
  
That boy never cast a look in your direction  
Never tried to hook for your affection  
Dresses like the mod of your invention tall and proud  
He is the head boy of the school of thought  
That plays in your intentions night and day  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Cause tonight always comes
