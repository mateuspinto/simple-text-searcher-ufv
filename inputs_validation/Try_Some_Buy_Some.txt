Way back in time  
Someone said try some  
I tried some  
Now buy some I bought some  
Oh Oh Oh  
After a while  
When I had tried them  
Denied them  
I opened my eyes and  
I saw you  
  
Not a thing did I have  
Not a thing did I see  
Till I called on your love  
And your love came to me  
  
OH OH OH OH OH OH  
  
Through my life  
Ive seen gray sky  
Met big fry  
Seen them die to get high  
Oh Oh Oh  
And when it seemed that I would  
Always be lonely  
I opened my eyes and I saw you  
  
Not a thing did I feel  
Not a thing did I know  
Till I called on your love  
And your love sure did grow  
  
OH OH OH OH OH OH  
  
Wont you try some  
Baby wont you buy some  
  
Wont you try some  
Baby wont you buy some
