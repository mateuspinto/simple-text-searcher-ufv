The whiteness of confusion  
Is unfolding from my mind  
I stare around in wonder  
Have I left my life behind  
  
I catch the scent of ambergris  
And turn my head surprised  
My gaze is caught and held and I  
Am helpless mesmerized  
  
Panacea liquid grace  
Oh let me touch your fragile face  
Enchantment falls around me  
And I know I cannot leave  
Heres a meaning for my life  
  
A shelter from the storm  
Pacify my troubles with  
Her body soft and warm  
Naked in our unity  
A smile for every tear  
  
Gentle hands that promise me  
Comfort through the years  
Yet I know I must be gone  
Before the light of dawn  
  
Panacea passion pure  
I cant resist your gentle lure  
My heart will lie beside you  
And my wandering body grieves
