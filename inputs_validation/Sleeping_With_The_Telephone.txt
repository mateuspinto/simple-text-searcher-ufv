I knew who he was when I took his name  
But somehow knowing is just not the same late at night  
He knows the danger but he does what he does  
He calls it duty but I call it love so here I am  
While hes gone to some foreign land  
  
And I cry cos Im all alone  
And the nights get so cold and long  
And I try not to think he wont come home  
But Im sleeping with the telephone  
  
The yellow ribbon on my neighbours gate  
He laughs and leaves with his gun and his blue uniform  
And I pray god keeps him safe from harm  
  
And I cry cos Im all alone  
And the nights get so cold and long  
And I try not to think he wont come home  
But Im sleeping with the telephone  
  
I lose him in my darkest dreams  
And my blood runs cold and my heart skips a beat  
So I get up I cant take any more  
Sometimes I hate how much I love him  
But every day I love him more  
  
And I try not to think he wont come home  
But Im sleeping with the telephone  
  
Something awakes me from where he should be  
I reach for him the telephone rings
