Its just another day in paradise  
As you stumble to your bed  
Youd give anything to silence  
Those voices ringing in your head  
You thought you could find happiness  
Just over that green hill  
You thought you would be satisfied  
But you never will  
Learn to be still  
  
We are like sheep without a shepherd  
We dont know how to be alone  
So we wander round this desert  
And wind up following the wrong gods home  
But the flock cries out for another  
And they keep answering that bell  
And one more starryeyed messiah  
Meets a violent farewell  
Learn to be still  
Learn to be still  
  
Now the flowers in your garden  
They dont smell so sweet  
Maybe youve forgotten  
The heaven lying at your feet  
  
There are so many contradictions  
In all these messages we send  
We keep asking  
How do I get out of here  
Where do I fit in  
Though the world is torn and shaken  
Even if your heart is breakin  
Its waiting for you to awaken  
And someday you will  
Learn to be still  
Learn to be still  
  
You just keep on runnin  
Keep on runnin
