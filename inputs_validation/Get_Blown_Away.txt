And when she blows the candle flame to smoke  
She says a prayer for all of those who live in houses and in homes  
And Monday shell go down town standing naked in the road  
You may know what I am  
But who I am you dont know  
  
Shell run across the mustard dust sand  
Scream down the wind  
And the sea is in a cold  
Like when in holiday homes  
And houses like sweet confectionery  
And sandcastles and drinking wine  
Hungry dinners perfectly timed  
  
And mother and father glowing young  
Happy to be each other together  
When she blows the candle out  
She goes to bed and lies and drags through her head  
The day that went way of every day  
But tomorrow shell fly a plane  
Over the fields where the houses arent built yet  
  
She smiled sweetly across the room  
Through the lunch time smoke  
And I loved her for a second  
And discarded the queen and I know  
How sweetness turns sour  
And leaves they turn to brown  
And then to earth and dust  
And settle in this town  
You get blown away  
  
repeat 1st half  
She smiled sweetly across the lunch time smoke  
And I loved her for a second and discarded the queen and I know  
When men are being little boys again  
And women cruel step mothers of old  
And this is the invention  
The adventure of my own  
I get blown away
