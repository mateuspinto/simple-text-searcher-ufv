Breathe your smoke into my lungs  
In the back of the car with you I stare into the sun  
Still not too old to die young  
The lovers hold on to everything  
And others hold on to anything  
  
I chased your love around a figure 8  
I need you more than I can take  
You promised forever and a day  
And then you take it all away  
And then you take it all away  
  
Place a kiss on my cheekbone  
Then you vanish me  
Im buried in the snow  
But something tells me Im not alone  
But lovers hold on to everything  
And others hold on to anything  
  
I chased your love around a figure 8  
I need you more than I can take  
You promised forever and a day  
And then you take it all away  
  
So Lovers hold on to everything  
And others hold to anything  
So Lovers hold on to everything  
And others hold to anything  
  
I chased your love around a figure 8  
I need you more than I can take  
You promised forever and a day  
And then you take it all away  
  
I chased your love around a figure 8  
I need you more than I can take  
You promised forever and a day  
And then you take it all away  
And then you take it all away
