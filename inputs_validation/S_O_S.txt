Where are those happy days they seem so hard to find  
I tried to reach for you but you have closed your mind  
Whatever happened to our love  
I wish I understood  
It used to be so nice it used to be so good  
  
So when youre near me darling cant you hear me  
S O S  
The love you gave me nothing else can save me  
S O S  
When youre gone  
How can I even try to go on  
When youre gone  
Though I try how can I carry on  
  
You seem so far away though you are standing near  
You made me feel alive but something died I fear  
I really tried to make it out  
I wish I understood  
What happened to our love it used to be so good  
  
So when youre near me darling cant you hear me  
S O S  
The love you gave me nothing else can save me  
S O S  
When youre gone  
How can I even try to go on  
When youre gone  
Though I try how can I carry on  
  
So when youre near me darling cant you hear me  
S O S  
And the love you gave me nothing else can save me  
S O S  
When youre gone  
How can I even try to go on  
When youre gone  
Though I try how can I carry on  
When youre gone  
How can I even try to go on  
When youre gone  
Though I try how can I carry on
