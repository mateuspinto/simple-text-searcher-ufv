Its a constant struggle getting up that hill  
Theres a change of guard every day  
When youre clinging onto a driftwood boat  
You pray a great white whale might come your way  
  
No freeway traffic in the frozen North  
Just a chain link fence full of birds  
And when the harpoons loaded in the cannon bay  
Youll be rolling through the pages lost for words  
  
Hey Ahab can you tell me where  
I can catch a ride out of here  
Hey Ahab hoist that sail  
You gotta stand up straight  
When you ride that whale  
  
In a crumbling city we were trapped for days  
With a broken sun above the clouds  
Caught like Jonah forty fathoms down  
And a sign on the wall says Hope Allowed  
  
All the cryptic symbols carved on bone  
A far cry from a tattooed rose  
And when the boys in the rigging catch the wind  
Well all weigh anchor and its westward ho  
  
Hey Ahab can you tell me where  
I can catch a ride out of here  
Hey Ahab hoist that sail  
You gotta stand up straight  
When you ride that whale  
  
Hey Ahab can you tell me where  
I can catch a ride out of here  
Hey Ahab hoist that sail  
You gotta stand up straight  
When you ride that whale  
  
Hey Ahab can you tell me where  
I can catch a ride out of here  
Hey Ahab hoist that sail  
You gotta stand up straight  
When you ride that whale
