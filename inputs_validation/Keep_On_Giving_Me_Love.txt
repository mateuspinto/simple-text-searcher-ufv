Oh you told me you were burned by holy water  
And the priest forgot the words  
He was trying to say  
It seems your best friend  
Is your own reflection  
And no promise of love  
Is gonna make you want to stay  
  
I dont mind  
You can think it over slow  
And tell me what you find  
Im marking time  
If you got love to give  
Baby I dont mind  
  
Keep on giving me loving  
Keep on giving me loving  
Keep on giving me loving  
Keep on giving me love  
  
You got fox eyes  
They burn like a sunrise  
You got a walk that makes a mans blood turn to wine  
You bought and sold me  
For you lover  
As long as you feed me good baby I dont mind  
  
I dont mind  
You can think it over slow  
And tell me what you find  
Im marking time  
If you got love to give  
Baby I dont mind  
  
Keep on giving me loving  
Keep on giving me loving  
Keep on giving me loving  
Keep on giving me love  
  
So you told me you were burned by holy water  
And the priest forgot the words  
He was trying to say  
It seems your best friend  
Is your own reflection  
And no promise of love  
Is gonna make you want to stay  
  
I dont mind  
You can think it over slow  
And tell me what you find  
Im marking time  
If you got love to give  
Baby I dont mind  
  
Keep on giving me loving  
Keep on giving me loving  
Keep on giving me loving  
Keep on giving me love
