When I survey the wondrous cross  
On which the Prince of Glory died  
My richest gain I count but loss  
And pour contempt on all my pride  
  
See from His head His hands His feet  
Sorrow and love flow mingled down  
Did eer such love and sorrow meet  
Or thorns compose so rich a crown  
  
Oh the wonderful cross  
Oh the wonderful cross  
Bids me come and die and find  
That I may truly live  
  
Oh the wonderful cross  
Oh the wonderful cross  
All who gather here  
By grace draw near  
And bless your name  
  
Were the whole realm of nature mine  
That were an offering far too small  
Love so amazing so divine  
Demands my soul my life my all  
  
Oh the wonderful cross  
Oh the wonderful cross  
Bids me come and die and find  
That I may truly live  
  
Oh the wonderful cross  
Oh the wonderful cross  
All who gather here  
By grace draw near  
And bless your name
