The promise of heaven pushed us right back to hell  
Turned three sevens into three sixes again  
And you laughed at my face when I told you how much it hurts  
And said  
  
Disarm me with your loneliness just like always before  
Deceive me out of my emptiness telling me how you love  
  
You keep on tempting me to go on whatever the cost  
To witness the prettiest flower in bloom wither to dust  
So Ill break all the rules in this endless game once called Love for you  
  
Disarm me with your loneliness just like always before and  
Deceive me out of my emptiness telling me how you love  
Me with all your heart no more  
  
Disarm me with your loneliness just like always before  
  
Disarm me with your loneliness just like always before  
Deceive me out of my emptiness telling me how you love me with all your heart
no more
