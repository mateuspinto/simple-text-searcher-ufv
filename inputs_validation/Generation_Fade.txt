It was a movement of the people like many times before  
Who stood up for peace and sat down for war  
They ran from the ways the old school ways  
Fight those different kill to be saved  
  
These theories came straight from their minds  
Their hearts left trembling deep down inside  
Well I know now know I know  now know what lies beneath  
  
These feelings may change as we all walk this way  
The youth steal the ship as this generation fades  
These feelings may change as we all walk this way  
The youth steal the ship as this generation fades  
  
Lets move to the middle embrace one and all  
See the beauty through the skin of the Aboriginal  
If your friend has fear then help him to heal  
Show him the difference gives this world appeal  
  
Well we are so lucky today  
The earth as our playground  its culture to amaze  
Well I know now know I know now know what lies beneath  
  
These feelings may change as we all walk this way  
The youth steal the ship as this generation fades  
These feelings may change as we all walk this way  
The youth steal the ship as this generation fades  
  
These feelings may change as we all walk this way  
The youth steal the ship as this generation fades  
These feelings may change as we all walk this way  
The youth steal the ship as this generation fades
