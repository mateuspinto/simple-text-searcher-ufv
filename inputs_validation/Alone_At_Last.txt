Alone at last in a hideaway far away  
From all the worries in the world  
We share each other  
While the suns going down  
Not another soul around  
Alone at last  
You and I  
  
Sunshine plenty of space and time heady wine  
For thirsty souls like yours and mine  
We come together  
Like the sea and the sand  
In a very private wonderland  
Alone at last  
You and I  
Wave goodbye  
To the crowded nights  
And city lights we left behind  
We love the dreams we share  
And dare to live the dream  
  
The sea in her serenity silently  
Casts a spell on you and me  
We share each other  
While the suns going down  
Not another soul around  
Alone at last  
Alone at last  
You and I  
  
We share each other  
While the suns going down  
Not another soul around  
Alone at last  
Alone at last  
You and I
