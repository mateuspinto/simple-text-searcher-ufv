You want to think I have a problem  
Well think again it lies within you  
You act so rude and immature  
Well ill act the same I wont acknowledge you  
But yet you still want to run your mouth  
Why even waste the time  
I despise your whole existence  
And thats the bottom line  
  
Your a waste of time  
Dont waste my time  
  
chorus x2  
No need for adolescent gossip  
Fact is that you need to grow up  
Dont concern yourself with my life  
Because I could care less what you do  
  
And you say hello to my face  
Ingrates and sellouts to our backs  
Its no miscommunication  
Guts is something that you lack  
Your a jealous bitter waste of time  
There is no need to pretend  
I dont owe you thing  
Your not my friend  
  
Your a  
  
Waste of time  
Dont waste my time  
  
chorus  
  
You wonder why I feel like this  
Come on open up your eyes  
Your outcries are so pathetic  
That is why I say  
  
Your a waste of time dont waste my time  
  
chorus  
  
Repeat x4  
I could care less what you do  
  
Repeat x7  
Your just a waste of time  
  
Your just a waste of my time
