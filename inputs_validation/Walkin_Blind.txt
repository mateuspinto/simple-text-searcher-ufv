I walk it up  
I walk it down  
I know not what I do  
  
Your love is a sword  
Made of folded gold  
In the shape of my heart  
  
I walk it up  
Walkin blind  
Walkin blind  
  
All I heard was him  
All I saw were eyes  
By the world begun  
  
I walk it down  
Walkin blind  
Walkin blind  
  
Angel falling angel blessed  
Sister how fair is your love  
I know not what I do  
  
Walkin blind  
Walkin blind  
  
From the face of love to love  
From the face of love to love
