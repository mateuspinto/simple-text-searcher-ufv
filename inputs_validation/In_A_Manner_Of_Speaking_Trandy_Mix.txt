In a manner of speaking  
I just want to say  
That I could never forget the way  
You told me everything  
By saying nothing  
In a manner of speaking  
I dont understand  
How love in silence becomes reprimand  
But the way I feel about you  
Is beyond words  
Oh give me the words  
Give me the words  
That tell me nothing  
Oh give me the words  
Give me the words  
That tell me everything  
In a manner of speaking  
Semantics wont do  
In this life that we live  
We only make do  
And the way that we feel  
Might have to be sacrificed  
So in a manner of speaking  
I just want to say  
That like you I should find a way  
To tell you everything  
By saying nothing  
Oh give me the words  
Give me the words  
That tell me nothing  
Oh give me the words  
Give me the words  
Give me the words  
Give me the words  
Give me the words
