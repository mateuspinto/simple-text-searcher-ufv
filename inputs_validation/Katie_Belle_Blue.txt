There is no deeper blue  
In the ocean that lies  
As deep as the blue  
Of your laughing eyes  
No sweeter sound  
Than your gentle sigh  
No heart was ever so pure  
  
Dream pretty dreams  
Touch beautiful things  
Let all the skies surround you  
Swim with the swans  
And believe that upon  
Some glorious dawn  
Love will find you  
  
Come some day  
Im bound away  
Wind and wings on the water  
Whatever may  
You must stay  
And remain my beautiful daughter  
  
There is no deeper blue  
In the ocean that lies  
As deep as the blue  
Of your laughing eyes  
No sweeter sound  
Than your gentle sigh  
No heart was ever so pure  
  
Good night Katie Belle good night
