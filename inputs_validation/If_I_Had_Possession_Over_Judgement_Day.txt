If I had possession over judgement day  
If I had possession over judgement day  
Lord the little woman Im lovin wouldnt have no right to pray  
And I went to the mountain far as my eyes could see  
And I went to the mountain far as my eyes could see  
Man got my woman and the a lonesome blues got me  
And I rolled and I tumbled and I cried the whole night long  
And I rolled and I tumbled and I cried the whole night long  
Boy I woke up this mornin my biscuit roller gone  
Had to fold my arms and I slowly walked away  
I didnt like the way she done  
Had to fold my arms and I slowly walked away  
And I said in my mind yo trouble gon come someday  
And now run here baby set down on my knee  
Oh now run here baby set down on my knee  
I wanna tell you all about the way they treated me
