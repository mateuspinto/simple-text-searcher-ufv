Has anybody here  
Seen my old friend Abraham  
Can you tell me  
Where he has gone  
Cos he freed a lot of people  
But it seems the good die young  
I just turned around  
And he was gone  
Has anybody here  
Seen my old friend Martin  
Can you tell me  
Where he has gone  
Cos he freed a lot of people  
But it seems the good die young  
I just looked around  
And he was gone  
Has anybody here  
Seen my old friend John  
Can you tell me  
Where he has gone  
Cos he freed a lot of people  
But it seems the good die young  
I just looked around  
And he was gone  
I just looked around  
And he was gone
