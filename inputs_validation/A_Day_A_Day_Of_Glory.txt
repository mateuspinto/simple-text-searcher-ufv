A day a day of glory  
A day that ends our woe  
A day that tells of triumph  
Against our vanquishd foe  
Yield summers brightest sunrise  
To this December morn  
Life up your gates ye Princes  
And let the Child be born  
  
With Gloria in excelsis  
Archangels tell their mirth  
With Kyrie eleyson  
Men answer upon the earth  
And angels swell the triumph  
And mortals raise the horn  
Life up you gates ye Princes  
And let the Child be born  
  
He comes His throne the manger
