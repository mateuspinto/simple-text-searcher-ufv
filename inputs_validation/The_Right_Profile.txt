Say where did I see this guy  
In Red River  
Or a Place In The Sun  
Maybe the Misfits  
Or From Here to Eternity  
  
Everybody say Is he all right  
And everybody say Whats he like  
Everybody say He sure look funny  
ThatsMontgomery Clift honey  
  
New York New York New York 42nd Street  
Hustlers rustle and pimps pimp the beat  
Monty Clift is recognized at dawn  
He aint got no shoes and his clothes are torn  
  
I see a car smashed at night  
Cut the applause and dim the light  
Montys face is broken on a wheel  
Is he alive Can he still feel  
  
Nembutol numbs it all  
But I prefer alcohol  
  
He said go out and get me my old movie stills  
Go out and get me another roll of pills  
There I go again shaking but I aint got the chills  
  
ARRRGHHHGORRA BUH BHUH DO ARRRRGGGGHHHHNNNN
