You know he cant be tested  
He cant be read or found  
Urban gray takes breath away  
He wants to push his pedal to the ground  
And the nights whats right  
Puts him at the wheel  
Well I eat danger  
Any stranger is all right  
Feel hot to go like jimmy O  
Dodging flying objects at the show  
And the lights make me fight  
In detroit 442  
Maybe baby I could ride with you  
This towns a concrete factory and dad and mom look just like me  
Im on the plant assembly line  
Too late now  
Too far behind  
You said you wanna hang around  
No one really cares where you go  
Take your time  
Things never change  
In detroit 442 maybe baby I could ride with you  
One more to market one more piggie and they all they all look just like me
yeah
