More than oxygen I need your love  
More than lifegiving food the hungry dream of  
More than an eloquent word depends on the tongue  
More than a passionate song needs to be sung  
  
More than a word could ever say  
More than a song could ever convey  
I need you more than all of these things  
Father I need you more  
  
More than magnet and steel are drawn to unite  
More than poets love words to rhyme as they write  
More than comforting warmth of sun in spring  
More than the eagle loves wind under its wings  
  
More than a word could ever say  
More than a song could ever convey  
I love you more than all of these things  
Father I love you more  
  
More than a blazing fire on a winters night  
More than the tall evergreens reach for the light  
More than the pounding waves long for the shore  
More than these gifts You give I love You more
