And my answers often left to feelin  
Like youre hangin out to dry  
And my reasons have left you wondering why  
Life has this question looming over me  
Since the day you took fly  
And if you come back there will be good times  
I see your face when Im staring out the window  
Beaming down in the moonlight  
Winter is colder life sought you by my side  
All I have is this photo whom youre  
Smiling to remind me of my words  
In my rights if you come back there would be good times  
And my answers often left to feelin

Now all Ive is this photo whom youre  
Smiling to remind me of my words  
In my rights if you come back there would be good times
