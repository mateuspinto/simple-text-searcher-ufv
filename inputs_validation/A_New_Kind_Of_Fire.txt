A new kind of fire burning inside  
Wonderful feelings I just cant hide  
Life is worth living  
Love can inspire such a new kind of fire  
  
Silent sweet surrender  
A broken heart remembers the first time  
Last moments sweet and tender  
Cold and dying embers when love dies  
  
In the quiet of the mist  
When two lovers kissed the very last time  
But were right here tonight  
Its love at first sight and were doing alright  
  
A new kind of fire burning inside  
Wonderful feelings I just cant hide  
Life is worth living  
Love can inspire such a new kind of fire  
  
Mexican morning we danced until dawn  
In the moonlight  
In blue Acapulco nobody that we know  
Is just right  
No thought of tomorrow  
And sorrow is clear out of sight  
But right here tonight  
Love is alright  
And were lost in the light  
  
A new kind of fire burning inside  
Wonderful feelings I just cant hide  
Life is worth living  
Love can inspire such a new kind of fire  
  
A new kind of fire burning inside  
Wonderful feelings I just cant hide  
Life is worth living  
Love can inspire such a new kind of fire  
  
A new kind of fire burning inside  
Wonderful feelings I just cant hide  
Life is worth living  
Love can inspire such a new kind of fire  
  
A new kind of fire burning inside  
Wonderful feelings I just cant hide  
Life is worth living  
Love can inspire such a new kind of fire  
A new kind of fire burning inside
