Im up and I can take what you give  
And Im here but I dont want you to live with me  
Cause all I want is a taste for free  
  
Im down and I will drag you along and around  
Until you burst into song and unwind  
And leave your new life behind for a while  
  
Cause I can see through the lines  
Cause I can see through the lines  
  
Im down and I will drag you along and around  
Until you burst into song and unwind  
And leave your new life behind for a while  
  
Im out and I will stay here alone and without  
Someone controlled by the phone and TV  
Cause what its doing to me is fine  
  
Cause I can see through the lines  
Cause I can see through the lines  
  
Oh oh  
Step into space  
Oh oh  
Alter my place  
Oh oh  
That someone else made  
Why I have stayed  
Into things I could be  
Or if I could see  
Into fog that surrounds  
And pins me to the ground  
  
I can see through the lines  
I can see through the lines  
I can see through the lines  
I can see through the lines
