Oh the snowflakes fell in silence  
Over Belleau Wood that night  
For a Christmas truce had been declared  
By both sides of the fight  
As we lay there in our trenches  
The silence broke in two  
By a German soldier singing  
A song that we all knew  
Though I did not know the language  
The song was Silent Night  
Then I heard my buddy whisper  
All is calm and all is bright  
Then the fear and doubt surrounded me  
Cause Id die if I was wrong  
But I stood up on my trench  
And I began to sing along  
Then across the frozen battlefield  
Anothers voice joined in  
Until one by one each man became  
A singer of the hymn  
Then I thought that I was dreaming  
For right there in my sight  
Stood the German soldier  
Neath the falling flakes of white  
And he raised his hand and smiled at me  
As if he seemed to say  
Heres hoping we both live  
To see us find a better way  
Then the devils clock struck midnight  
And the skies lit up again  
And the battlefield where heaven stood  
Was blown to hell again  
But for just one fleeting moment  
The answer seemed so clear  
Heavens not beyond the clouds  
Its just beyond the fear  
No heavens not beyond the clouds  
Its for us to find it here
