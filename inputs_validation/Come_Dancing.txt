They put a parking lot on a piece of land  
Where the supermarket used to stand  
Before that they put up a bowling alley  
On the site that used to be the local palais  
Thats where the big bands used to come and play  
My sister went there on a Saturday  
Come dancing  
All her boyfriends used to come and call  
Why not come dancing its only natural  
  
Another Saturday another date  
She would be ready but shed always make him wait  
In the hallway in anticipation  
He didnt know the night would end up in frustration  
Hed end up blowing all his wages for the week  
All for a cuddle and a peck on the cheek  
Come dancing  
Thats how they did it when I was just a kid  
And when they said come dancing  
My sister always did  
  
My sister should have come in at midnight  
And my mum would always sit up and wait  
It always ended up in a big row  
When my sister used to get her own way  
Out of my window I could see them in the moonlight  
Two silhouettes saying goodnight by the garden gate  
  
The day they knocked down the palais  
My sister stood and cried  
The day they knocked down the palais  
Part of my childhood died just died  
  
Now Im grown up and playing in a band  
And theres a car park where the palais used to stand  
My sisters married and she lives on an estate  
Her daughters go out now its her turn to wait  
She knows they get away with things she never could  
But if I asked her I wonder if she would  
Come dancing  
Come on sister have yourself a ball  
Dont be afraid to come dancing  
Its only natural  
  
Come dancing  
Just like the palais on a Saturday  
And all her friends will come dancing  
Where the big bands used to play
