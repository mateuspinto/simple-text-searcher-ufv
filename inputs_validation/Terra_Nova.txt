Oh end this day show me the ocean  
When shall I see the sea  
May this day set me in motion  
I ought to be on my way  
  
We were there  
We were sailing on the Terra Nova  
Sailing for the setting sun  
Sailing for the new horizon  
May this day show me an ocean  
I ought to be on my way  
  
Ought to be on my way right now  
Stepping on the boat  
With a lump in my throat  
On my way right now  
  
I got a letter from a dear friend of mine  
The story of a spiritual awakening  
She spoke of her love returning in kind  
She let me know that shed be waiting  
And I should be on my way by now  
Walking across the floor  
Reaching for the door on my way by now  
  
But here I sit  
Country fool that I am  
My elbow on my knee  
And my chin in my hand  
My mind in the gutter  
And my eye on the street  
Holed up in a cave of concrete  
And I ought to be on my way right now  
Packing my things  
While the telephone rings  
On my way right now  
  
I miss my lovely mother  
And I love my lonely father  
I know I owe my brothers one thing  
And another I hear my sister singing  
And I ought to be on my way right now  
Moving across the land  
With my heart in my hand  
On my way by now  
Ought to be on my way by now  
  
Oh end this day  
Set me in motion  
Ought to be on my way  
  
Out to the west  
Of Lamberts Cove  
Theres a sail out in the sun  
And Im on board  
Though very small  
Ive come home to stop yearning  
Burn off the haze  
Around the shore  
Turn off the crazy way I feel  
Ill stay away from you no more  
Ive come home to stop yearning
