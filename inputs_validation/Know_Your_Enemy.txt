Huh  
Hey yo so check this out  
Yeah  
Know your enemy  
Come on  
  
Born with insight and a raised fist  
A witness to the slit wrist thats with  
As we move into 92  
Still in a room without a view  
Ya got to know  
Ya got to know  
That when I say go go go  
Amp up and amplify  
Defy  
Im a brother with a furious mind  
Action must be taken  
We dont need the key  
Well break in  
  
Something must be done  
About vengeance a badge and a gun  
Cause Ill rip the mike rip the stage rip the system  
I was born to rage against em  
  
Fist in ya face in the place  
And Ill drop the style clearly  
Know your enemyKnow your enemy

Word is born  
Fight the war fuck the norm  
Now I got no patience  
So sick of complacence  
With the D the E the F the I the A the N the C the E  
Mind of a revolutionary  
So clear the lane  
The finger to the land of the chains  
What The land of the free  
Whoever told you that is your enemy  
  
Now something must be done  
About vengeance a badge and a gun  
Cause Ill rip the mike rip the stage rip the system  
I was born to rage against em  
  
Now action must be taken  
We dont need the key  
Well break in

Sick of sick of sick of sick of you  
Time has come to pay  
Know your enemy

Yes I know my enemies  
Theyre the teachers who taught me to fight me  
Compromise conformity assimilation submission  
Ignorance hypocrisy brutality the elite  
All of which are American dreams
