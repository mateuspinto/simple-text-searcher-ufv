Father I love Your ways  
You came in Your mercy and died in my place  
All I can do is bow  
Because of Your goodness and Your sovereign grace  
That You sweep me away sweep me away in Your love  
Where nothing else matters  
Sweep me away sweep me away in Your love  
Where nothing else matters  
Tears rolling down my face  
Because of Your love and Your sweet embrace  
The peace that just overflows  
Its here that I know You have been waiting to  
Sweep me away sweep me away in Your love  
Where nothing else matters  
Sweep me away sweep me away in Your love
