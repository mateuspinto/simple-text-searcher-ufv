Como esta amigo  
For the death of those we dont go  
Shall we kneel and say a prayer  
They will never know we care  
Shall we keep the fires burning  
Shall we keep the flames alight  
Should we try to remember  
What is wrong and what is right  
  
No more tears no more tears  
If we live for a hundred years  
Amigos no more tears  
  
And if we do forget them  
and the sacrifice they made  
Will the wickedness and sadness  
come to visit us again  
Shall we dance the dance in sunlight  
Shall we drink the wine of peace  
Shall our tears be of joy  
Shall we keep at bay the beast  
  
Inside the scream is silent  
Inside it must remain  
No victory and no vanquished  
Only horror only pain
