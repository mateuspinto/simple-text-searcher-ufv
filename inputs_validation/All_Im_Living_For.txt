Here I am waiting for You  
Here I am reaching out to You  
I will run into Your arms again  
And I m longing for Your touch once again  
  
Take my life everything All I am  
An offering for you  
Cause you re all I m living for  
  
Here I am waiting on You  
Here I am reaching out for You  
I will run into Your arms again  
And I m longing for Your touch once again  
  
Chorus  
Take my life everything All I am  
An offering for you  
Cause you re all I m living for  
Take my heart all of me  
I m laying it down to worship You my God  
Cause You re all I m living for  
  
I will run into Your open arms  
To your love that washes away my fears  
I am found deep in this mystery  
Cause You re all I m living for  
  
repeat chorus  
  
Cause You re all  
You re All I m living for  
Jesus You re all  
All I m living for
