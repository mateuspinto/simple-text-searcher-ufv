There is no turning back  
From this unending path of mine  
Serpentine and black  
It stands before my eyes  
To hell and back  
It will lead me once more  
Its all I have as I stumble in  
Out of grace  
  
I walk through the gardens  
Of dying light  
And cross all the rivers  
Deep and dark as the night  
Searching for a reason  
Why time wouldve passed us by  
  
With every step I take  
The less I know myself  
And every vow I break on my way towards your heart  
Countless times Ive prayed  
For forgiveness  
But Gods just laughed at my face  
And this path remains  
Leading me into solitude arms  
  
I see through the darkness  
My way back home  
The journey seems endless  
But Ill carry on  
The shadows will rise  
And they will fall  
And our night drowns in dawn  
  
Amidst all the tears theres a smile  
That all angels will greet with an envious song  
One look into strangers eyes  
And I know where I belong  
  
I walk through the gardens  
Of dying light  
And cross all the rivers  
Deep and dark as the night  
Searching for a reason  
Why time wouldve passed us by  
  
Oh I see through the darkness  
My way back home  
The journey seems endless  
But Ill carry on  
The shadows will rise  
And they will fall  
And our night drowns in dawn
