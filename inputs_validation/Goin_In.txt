Put me in a cell feed down Flo Rida hey  
To the sky put your hands on rock  
Plus nobody telling please that the club is mi casa  
So they wanna freak on the way you call papa  
Gotta make them sing high notes like Oprah  
When the ego I got four Leo  
Even the DJ wanna rep Puerto Rico

Whatever that he say better listen up people
