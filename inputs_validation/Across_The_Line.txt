In this desert  
In darkness  
Lying with the gun across his chest  
Pretending  
Hes heartless  
As the fire flashes in the sky  
He was fragile  
And frozen  
When the bullet took away his friend  
And now hes somehow  
More broken  
  
Hes pulling his weapon to his side  
Loading it full of his goodbyes  
Holding an enemy across the line  
Hes pulling his weapon to his side  
Loading it full of his goodbyes  
Holding an enemy across the line  
  
Sweating  
And shaking  
Lying with her hands across her chest  
She wakes with  
Her cravings  
As the fire flashes in her eye  
She was fragile  
And frozen  
When the needle took away her friend  
And now shes somehow  
More broken  
  
Shes pulling her weapon to her side  
Loading it full of her goodbyes  
Holding an enemy across the line  
Shes pulling her weapon to her side  
Loading it full of her goodbyes  
Holding an enemy across the line  
  
With every battle hes chosing  
With every fight hes losing  
His enemys not far behind  
With every promise shes broken  
With every lie shes spoken  
Her enemys not far behind  
  
Its your time  
Its your time  
Its your time  
Its  your  time  
  
Hes pulling his weapon to his side  
Loading it full of his goodbyes  
Holding an enemy across the line  
  
Shes pulling her weapon to her side  
Loading it full of her goodbyes  
Holding an enemy across the line  
  
With every battle hes chosing  
With every fight hes losing  
His enemys not far behind  
With every promise shes broken  
With every lie shes spoken  
Her enemys not far behind
