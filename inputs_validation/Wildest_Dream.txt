Two different worlds collide  
Somehow come together  
Caught in the moment  
Blind with desire  
The way I want of you  
I should have known better  
Moving way too fast  
Jumping through the fire  
  
I cant regret you  
Somewhere we went wrong  
I wont forget you  
Long after youve gone  
  
Oh youre still in my wildest dream  
Getting the best of me  
The way you used to do  
Tell me do  
Do you still think of me  
The way I could make you feel  
When love was all we knew  
In my wildest dream yeah  
  
We had our time to shine  
Before we started fading  
Could not see eye to eye  
Pretending nothings wrong  
We open up our eyes and asked when love was gone  
I still think about you  
And how youve been  
Getting by without you  
But still you come again  
  
Oh youre still in my wildest dream  
Getting the best of me  
The way you used to do  
Tell me do  
Do you still think of me  
The way I could make you feel  
When love was all we knew  
In my wildest dream  
  
And on a bed of roses  
Under the pale moonlight  
I wait for sweet surrender  
Until another night  
  
Oh youre still in my wildest dream  
Getting the best of me  
The way you used to do  
Oh tell me do  
Do you still think of me  
The way I could make you feel  
When love was all we knew  
In your wildest dream  
  
Cant get you off my mind  
In my wildest dream  
Cant get you off my mind  
Oh oh in your wildest dream  
Ooh in your wildest dream yeah  
Oh oh oh
