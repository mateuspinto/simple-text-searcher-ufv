Mother and Stan dont blame yourself for Rose  
She was out there playing in the road  
Better to let her know not to forget  
All that schooling goes right through their heads  
  
They take back all  
And when you give them loving  
Fall you to your knees  
Then give back nothing  
But looking through love  
You know theres something so real  
  
Father and Son youre in this one so deep  
I could always lull myself to sleep  
But I will cry to let you always know  
All my life I need your time to grow
