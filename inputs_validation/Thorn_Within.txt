Forgive me father  
For I have sinned  
Find me guilty of the life I feel within  
  
When Im branded  
This mark of shame  
Should I look down disgraced  
Or straight ahead  
And know that you must blame  
  
I am I am the secret  
I am I am the sin  
I am I am the guilty  
And I I am the thorn within  
  
Forgive me father  
For I have sinned  
Find me guilty when true guilt is from within  
  
So point your fingers  
Point right at me  
For I am shadows and will follow you  
One and the same are we  
  
I am I am the secret  
I am I am the sin  
I am I am the guilty  
And I I am the thorn within  
  
I do your time  
I take your fall  
Im branded guilty  
For us all  
  
So point your fingers  
Point right at me  
For I am shadows and will follow you  
One and the same are we  
  
I am I am your secrets  
I am I am your sin  
I am I am your guilty  
And II am the thorn within  
I am the thorn within  
I am the thorn within  
I am the thorn within  
I am the thorn within  
I am the thorn within
