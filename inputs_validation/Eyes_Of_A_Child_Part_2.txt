Im gonna sit and watch the web  
That you will build this day  
Will it be a thread of love you weave  
Is yours too short away  
Then everything will be as you will see in the light  
  
In the eyes of the child  
You must come out and see  
That your worlds spinning round  
And through life you will be  
A small part  
Of a hope  
Of a love  
That exists  
In the eyes of a child you will see  
  
In the eyes of the child  
You must come out and see
