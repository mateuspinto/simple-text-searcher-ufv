Theres a reason why  
You can look up every night  
And every star in heavens in its place  
Theres a reason why  
  
The full moon pulls the tide  
And the waves roll into a shore that always waits  
And just like that  
  
Baby you belong  
Baby you belong  
Nothins ever been so meant to be  
Or ever felt so right to me  
  
Every single part of me believes  
Baby you belong in my life  
Oh baby you belong by my side  
There really is no mystery  
  
I think anyone can see  
That baby you belong  
With me  
  
Theres a voice inside  
And I heard it promise me  
When you came along  
Id know you by heart  
  
Like a familiar song  
Every word is telling me  
That the time has finally come  
Now here you are  
And I know for sure  
  
Baby you belong in my life  
Baby you belong by my side  
Nothins ever been so meant to be  
Or ever felt so right to me  
  
Every single part of me believes  
Baby you belong in my life  
Oh baby you belong by my side  
There really is no mystery  
  
I think anyone can see  
That baby you belong  
  
Like the sun belongs up in the morning sky  
For at least another million reasons why  
  
Baby you belong  
Baby you belong  
Nothins ever been so meant to be  
Or ever felt so right to me  
  
Baby you belong in my life  
Oh baby you belong by my side  
Nothins ever been so meant to be  
Every single part of me believes  
  
Baby you belong in my life  
Oh baby baby baby you belong by my side  
There really is no mystery  
I think anyone can see  
  
That baby you belong  
With me  
  
Baby you belong with me
