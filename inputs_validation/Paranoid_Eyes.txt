Button your lip Dont let the shield slip  
Take a fresh grip on your bullet proof mask  
And if they try to break down your disguise with their questions  
You can hide hide hide  
Ill tell you what Ill give you three blacks and play you for five  
Ta You was unlucky there son  
Time gentleman  
Behind paranoid eyes  
  
You put on our brave face and slip over the road for a jar  
Fixing your grin as you casually lean on the bar  
Laughing too loud at the rest of the world  
With the boys in the crowd  
You hide hide hide  
Behind petrified eyes  
  
You believed in their stories of fame fortune and glory  
Now youre lost in a haze of alcohol soft middle age  
The pie in the sky turned out to be miles too high  
And you hide hide hide  
Behind brown and mild eyes
