High on a balcony  
Right where we used to be  
This city dancing  
Like a sparkling sea  
I wanna catch a wave  
I wanna swim to shore  
Walk on that same beach  
Like I did before  
  
I really want the sun  
Want the sun to rise  
I really want  
To end the night  
I really wanna feel  
Wanna feel your love  
I wanna feel your love  
  
I think of our old friends  
I count my enemies  
I hear you tell me how  
I dont know love  
I wanna feel your love  
I wanna lay right down  
Wish I was swimming  
In the sound of love  
  
I really want the night  
Want the night to end  
I really want  
The sun to rise  
I really wanna feel  
Wanna feel your love  
I wanna feel your love  
  
And now the night is still  
The mansion on the hill  
The children sleeping  
In their endless dreams  
I wanna feel your love  
I wanna feel your love  
I wanna feel your love  
Feel your love  
Feel your love  
  
I wanna feel your love  
I wanna feel your love  
I wanna feel your love  
Feel your love  
Feel your love
