Love and maple syrup goes together  
Like the sticky winds of winter when they meet  
When lonely lovers come to rest  
Beneath the trees they do their best  
But still they cant be free  
Looking for the world to be  
Anything but what they see  
Longing to be understood  
By the heart that shapes the wood  
  
If you go into the forest gaze up through the leaves  
And see the sky thats almost wild  
You must learn to understand  
What makes the forest greet the man  
Like a mothers only child  
  
In the north when when winters claw  
Relaxes now to keep the laws of nature in control  
People come and stand in line  
To rob the forest of her wine  
But they dont feel the cold  
  
Looking for the world to be  
Anything but what they see  
Longing to be understood  
By the heart that shapes the wood  
  
Love and maple syrup goes together  
Like the sticky winds of winter when they meet  
When lonely lovers come to rest  
Beneath the trees they do their best  
But still they cant be free  
  
Love and maple syrup shine like  
Embers warm like thoughts divine  
They tell us it is spring  
Love and maple syrup stir  
The thoughts of people into words  
Of songs that they can sing  
  
Looking for the world to be  
Anything but what they see  
Longing to be understood  
By the heart that shapes the wood
