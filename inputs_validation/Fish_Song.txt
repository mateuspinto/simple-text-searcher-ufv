Sat here by this stony brook until the Grey day turned to dust  
When up swam a fish with a childrens book thought that I was lost  
He was on his way to the salmon hop thats where they go to breed  
Saw me sitting on this log and thought Id like to read  
  
Chorus  
The night was cloudy but the moon he found a hole  
Said that he felt bad for me cause I had no place to go  
  
Why arent you at the harvest ball with some sweet young gal  
You just sit like a bump on the log and call that fish your pal  
  
Well I told him I was an orphan lived here all alone  
But many people have often tried to catch and take me home  
They never caught me  
  
Thought that I was a hiding call this log my home  
But the fish and the moon and a sweet young gal  
All want me for their own  
  
Chorus  
  
So I met that gal at the harvest ball she took me to her room  
While I slept in childrens dreams the fish ran away with the moon  
The fish ran away with the moon  
The fish ran away with the moon
