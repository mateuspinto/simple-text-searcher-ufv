If blood will flow when flesh and steel are one  
Drying in the color of the evening sun  
Tomorrows rain will wash the stains away  
But something in our minds will always stay  
  
Perhaps this final act was meant  
To clinch a lifetimes argument  
That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could  
  
For all those born beneath an angry star  
Lest we forget how fragile we are  
  
On and on the rain will fall  
Like tears from a star  
Like tears from a star  
On and on the rain will say  
How fragile we are  
How fragile we are  
  
On and on the rain will fall  
Like tears from a star  
Like tears from a star  
On and on the rain will say  
How fragile we are  
How fragile we are  
How fragile we are  
How fragile we are
