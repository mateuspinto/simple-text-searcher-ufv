Riding along on a carousel trying to catch up to you  
Riding along on a carousel will I catch up to you  
  
Horses chasing cause theyre racing  
So they aint so far  
  
On a carousel on a carousel  
  
Nearer and nearer by changing horses still so far away  
People fighting for their places just get in my way  
Soon youll leave and then Ill lose you  
Still were going round  
  
On a carousel on a carousel  
round and round and round and round  
round and round and round and round with you  
Up down up down up down too  
  
As she leaves she drops the presents that she won before  
Pulling ducks out of the water got the highest score  
Nows my chance and I must take it a case of doordie  
  
On a carousel on a carousel  
round and round and round and round  
round and round and round and round with you  
Up down up down up down too  
  
Riding along on a carousel trying to catch up to you  
Riding along on a carousel will I catch up to you  
  
Now we take our ride together  
No more chasing her  
  
On a carousel on a carousel
