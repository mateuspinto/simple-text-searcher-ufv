JUNGLE  
Here I go  
Down below  
The sun is goin down  
A Jungle comes alive  
The beast is waking up  
To take another life  
  
I cant sleep  
In too deep  
The man with nothing left  
Without a place to hide  
Will take a final breath  
And tumble in the night  
Yeah  
  
Someones safe at home  
Someone dies alone  
Someones fallen prey  
Yeah  
  
Some will take their fill  
Like lions to the kill  
Livin day to day  
Whoa  
The Jungle  
  
Mothers mourn  
Fathers groan  
The child takes a hit  
And then he starts to cry  
A mother never hears  
Her babys last goodbye  
Yeah  
  
Someones safe at home  
Someone dies alone  
Someones fallen prey  
Yeah  
  
Some will take their fill  
Like lions to the kill  
Livin day to day  
Whoa  
The Jungle  
  
The sun is coming up  
A city comes alive  
The lamb will never see  
A Jungle in the sky  
Yeah  
  
Someones safe at home  
Someone dies alone  
Someones falling prey  
Yeah  
  
Some will take their fill  
Like lions to the kill  
Livin day to day  
Yeah  
  
Someone dies alone  
Someones safe at home  
All is flesh and bone  
Whoa  
The Jungle
