Every second counts  
When I am with you  
I think you are a pig  
You should be in a zoo  
I guess I shouldve known  
Id end up on my own  
Every second counts when I am with you  
Every second counts  
  
Every little counts  
When I am with you  
You make me feel so good  
I never felt so new  
I saw you long ago  
Though you never let it show  
Every little counts when I am with you  
  
Every little counts when I am with you  
  
Every second counts  
When I am with you  
Even though youre stupid  
I still follow you  
The smile upon your face  
It always stays in place  
Every second counts when I am with you  
  
Every second counts when I am with you  
Every second
