WARBUCKS  
  
Ive made me a fortune  
That fortune made ten  
Been headlined  
And profiled  
Again and again  
But something was missing  
I never quite knew  
That something was someone  
But who  
  
My speeches are greeted  
With thunderous acclaim  
At two universities  
Bearing my name  
Yes something was missing  
Each timeI got through  
That something was someone  
But who  
  
Who could that someone be  
How could she make it known  
Who would need me for me  
Need me for me alone  
The world was my oyster  
But where was the pearl  
Who dreamed I could find it  
Yes something was missing  
But dreams can come true  
That something  
Is no one  
But you  
  
Who would need me for me  
Need me for me alone  
The world was my oyster  
But where was the pearl  
Whod dream I would find it  
In one little girl  
Yes something was missing  
But dreams do come true  
That something is no one but you
