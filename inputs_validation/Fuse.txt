Spoken  
Of course you know what a fuse is  
Its a long piece of cord impregnated with gun powder  
When you strike a match and light it  
It burns fitfully spiraling to its end  
At which there is a little surprise  
  
Krypton short suit mcs youll be ripped on  
You fell off and its my lyric sheet you just slipped on  
Get gone spit on mics made in Hong Kong  
Rock on sing songs mightier than King Kong  
A Donkey you think you want me or want this  
Want some hold your reputation for Ransom  
With these here handsomely crafted tactics  
To break a snake and see like a cheap profilactic  
Galactic space now yeah that grabs attention  
Crack heads nodded like a pest cant even mention  
Right a pat traps gas tracks in sections  
Kid steps this he need witness protection  
  
Trying to see while I  
If you see it  
Ill be here  
Trying to see while I  
If you see it  
Ill be here  
  
It was the junkyard crooked letter CIentific  
Duck us the ruckus Ill bring stings your eardrum  
Hear one lalala loose frind me fearsome  
Opposing troops on my home front shall be gone  
Testing the eighthundred eighteenth battalion  
Shallow the one whos run like rebels  
Enola gay rhymes kicked the notch up a level  
In intensity send back the tax that you sent to me  
Blow up your spot with grenades that were meant for me  
Mp3 versus R33 mcs Swiss change your gear putting shrapnel in the breeze  
Were mcs with enemy companies with my hand full of lyrics talking bout you
want these  
Please dont even speak the name of channels and low gadget mic shit put it
down like pens  
For my friends and my fam let them dodge it around this mic shot through the
back of an mcs hand  
With the strength that he had a bridge you dont want that close body fields
in hand to hand combat  
Battle cats its like the sectional speech warfare words slash cords  
Come deford shots get rid dont question my intention when your butt gets
kicked  
  
Trying to to see while I  
If you see it  
Ill be here  
Tech broke italic syllabalic attacks  
Trying to see while I  
If you see it  
Ill be here  
You want these mcs lyrically back smacks  
  
Why wait I didnt look down myself  
Why wait I didnt look down myself  
Why wait I didnt look down myself  
Why wait I didnt look down myself  
Why wait I didnt look down myself  
Why wait I didnt look down myself  
Why wait I didnt look down myself  
Why wait I didnt look down myself  
  
Trying to to see while I  
If you see it  
Ill be here  
Tech broke italic syllabalic attacks  
Trying to see while I  
If you see it  
Ill be here  
You want these mcs lyrically back smacks
