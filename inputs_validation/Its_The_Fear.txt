It waits for the day I will let it out  
To give it a reason to give its might  
  
I fear who I am becoming  
I feel that I am losing the struggle within  
I can no longer restrain it  
my strength it is fading  
I have to give in  
  
Chorus  
Its the fear  
Fear of the dark  
Its growing inside of me  
that one day will come to life  
Have to save  
To save my beloved  
there is no escape  
because my faith is horror and doom  
  
Hold down your head now  
just let me pass by  
Dont feed my fear  
if you dont want it out  
  
I fear who I am becoming  
I feel that I am losing all beauty within  
I can no longer restrain it  
my strength is fading  
I have to give in  
  
Chorus  
  
Long ago it came to me  
and ever since that day  
infected with its rage  
but it ends today  
  
Chorus
