Im the man on the mountain come on up  
Im the plowman in the valley with a face full of mud  
Yes Im fumbling and I know my car dont start  
Yes Im stumbling and I know I play a bad guitar  
  
Give me little drink from your loving cup  
Just one drink and Ill fall down drunk  
  
Im the man who walks the hillside in the sweet summer sun  
Im the man that brings you roses when you aint got none  
Well I can run and jump and fish but I wont fight  
You if you want to push and pull with me all night  
  
Give me little drink from you loving cup  
Just one drink and Ill fall down drunk  
  
I feel so humble with you tonight  
Just sitting in front of the fire  
See your face dancing in the flame  
Feel your mouth kissing me again  
What a beautiful buzz what a beautiful buzz  
What a beautiful buzz what a beautiful buzz  
Oh what a beautiful buzz what a beautiful buzz  
  
Yes I am nitty gritty and my shirts all torn  
But I would love to spill the beans with you till dawn  
  
Give me little drink from your loving cup  
Just one drink and Ill fall down drunk
