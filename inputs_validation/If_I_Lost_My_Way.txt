If I lost my way  
Would you stand with me  
Would you love me still  
And care for what I need  
If I lost my way  
  
If I lost my faith  
To face up to the test  
Would I let you down  
Would you love me less  
If I lost my way  
  
Tell me Im afraid without good reasons  
Say that Im a fool to feel this way  
Could it be the me that you believed in  
Is all you really need to make you stay  
If I lost my way  
If I lost my way  
  
If I lost my dreams  
Could I keep your trust  
Promise that our love  
Would not turn to dust  
If I lost my way  
  
Tell me Im afraid without good reasons  
Say that Im a fool to feel this way  
Could it be the me that you believed in  
Is all you really need to make you stay  
If I lost my way  
Would you stand with me  
Would you love me still  
And care for what I need  
If I lost my way  
  
If I lost my way  
If I lost my way  
If I lost my way
