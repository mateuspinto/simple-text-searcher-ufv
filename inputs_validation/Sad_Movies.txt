Sad movies always make me cry  
Sad movies always make me cry  
He said he had to work so I went to the show alone  
They turned down the lights and turned the projector on  
And just as the news of the world started to begin  
I saw my darling and my best friend walking in  
  
Although I was sitting right there they didnt see me  
And so they both sat right down in the front of me  
And when he kissed her lips then I almost died  
And in the middle of the color cartoon I started to cry  
  
Oh sad movies always make me cry  
Sad movies always make me cry  
Sad movies always make me cry  
Sad movies always make me cry  
  
And so I got on up and slowly I walked on home  
And Mama saw the tears and said Baby what is wrong  
And so just to keep from telling her a lie  
I just said Sad movies makes me cry  
  
Oh sad movies always make me cry  
Sad movies always make me cry  
Sad movies always make me cry  
Sad movies always make me cry
