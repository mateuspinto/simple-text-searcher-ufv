You threw out the past  
When you threw out what was mine  
Throughout the years  
It was hard to make it last  
  
Anodyne  
No sign of reconciliation  
Its a quarter past the end  
Full moon from on high  
  
Across the board we lose again  
Anodyne  
Anodyne  
Tossed it out for me to find  
  
Without a word youre out the door  
Without a reason anymore  
Two fingers on the trigger  
Can break the heart of any day  
  
Foolish to believe  
It would turn out okay  
Anodyne  
Anodyne  
  
Tossed it out for me to find  
Without a word youre out the door  
Without a reason anymore
