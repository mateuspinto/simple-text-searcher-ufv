Say my name  
So I will know youre back youre here again  
For a while  
Oh let us share  
The memories that only we can share  
Together  
  
Tell me about  
The days before I was born  
How we were as children  
These colors come alive  
In your heart and in your mind  
I cross the borders of time  
Leaving today behind to be with you again  
  
We breath the air  
Do you remember how you used to touch my hand  
Youre not aware  
Your hands keep still  
You just dont know that I am here  
  
It hurts too much  
A pray now that soon you release  
To where you belong  
  
You touch my hand  
These colors come alive  
In your heart and in your mind  
I cross the borders of time  
Leaving today behind to be with you again  
  
Please say my name  
Remember who I am  
You will find me in the world of yesterday  
You drift away again  
To far from where I am  
When you ask me who I am  
  
Say my name  
These colors come alive  
In your heart and in your mind  
I cross the borders of time  
Leaving today behind to be with you again  
  
Say my name
