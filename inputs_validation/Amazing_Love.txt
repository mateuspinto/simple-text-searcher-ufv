My steps were wandering  
My lips were hungry  
My heart was thundering  
For something more than all those things  
  
My words were crying out  
My faith was darkened out  
My life lost without  
This one amazing love  
  
Washing over me like rain  
Conquering the fear and pain  
My broken path was not in vain  
Glory Hallelujah glory Hallelujah  
Glory Hallelujah glory Hallelujah  
  
Washing over me like rain  
Taking all the fear and pain  
My broken path was not in vain  
Glory Hallelujah glory Hallelujah  
  
I lift my blinded eyes  
Towards the souls denied  
And saw the One who died  
For one amazing love  
Hallelujah  
  
One amazing love  
Just one amazing love  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Just one amazing love  
Just one amazing love
