Of Egyptian Kings we know oh so many things  
Cause the archaeologists have dug their tombs  
Now were here to show how to treat a dead pharaoh  
Make a mummy that can decorate you room  
  
First your dead kings lain on a table where his brain  
Is pull out with a wire through his nose  
Then his guts and lungs stomach liver must be bunged  
In four jars so they do not decompose  
  
Pour out salt to dry on the body let it lie  
There for forty days until it mummifies  
In the bandage wrap up the body leave a gap  
For the mouth and pop in artificial eyes  
  
In the coffin cold lay out prayers in little scrolls  
That will guard him on his journey far ahead  
Pack his tomb with wealth Which hell need for his health  
If he makes it to the country of the dead  
  
Now youve done your job there are villains who will rob  
So our mummy and its coffin we defend  
Build a pyramid high so it points up to the sky  
Place your dead king deep inside and thats the end
