We have come from the ashes of the burning away  
Pouring blood in the fire on the altar of pain  
Led into temptation now the black gods align  
Here there is no salvation and your blood is my wine  
  
Heres a world that is waiting between the living and the dead  
Here the flesh and its pleasure are eternally wed  
All is all for the taking for a life of a lie  
At the end of the breaking Ill be watching you die  
  
Crawl to the silence renounce and deny  
The stars and the numbers foretold of this time  
To the words and the wisdom too the promise of lies  
By their anger and fury the strong will survive
