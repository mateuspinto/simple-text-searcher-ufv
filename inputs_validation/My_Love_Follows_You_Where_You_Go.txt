More wishes than a thousand hearts can count for you  
More smiles than a merrygoround  
The sweetest ending to a bedtime story told  
My love follows you where you go  
  
More laughter than a kindergarten out to play  
One Sunday morning song that says it all  
More summer than the California beach can hold  
My love follows you where you go  
  
Future like a promise  
Your city of gold  
Stubborn in your bones and  
Jesus in your soul  
Seeing you stand there  
Starin at the unknown  
I wont pretend that its not killin me  
Watchin you walk away slow  
  
Take forgiveness take a prayer take the deepest breath  
And take the answers in your heart  
When you wake up and the world is cruel and cold  
My love follows you where you go  
  
Future like a promise  
Your city of gold  
Stubborn in your bones and  
Jesus in your soul  
Seeing you stand there  
Starin at the unknown  
I wont pretend that its not killin me  
Watchin you walk away slow  
  
More freedom than a field of flowers in the day  
More beauty than a mornin after rain  
Up the steepest hill a dark and crooked road  
My love follows you where you go  
  
Future like a promise  
Your city of gold  
Stubborn in your bones and  
Jesus in your soul  
Seeing you stand there  
Starin at the unknown  
I wont pretend that its not killin me  
Watchin you walk away slow
