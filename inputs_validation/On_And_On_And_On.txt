I was at a party  
And this feller said to me  
Something bad is happening  
Im sure you do agree  
People care for nothing  
No respect for human rights  
Evil times are coming  
We are in for darker nights  
I said who are you  
To talk about impending doom  
He got kinda wary  
As he looked around the room  
He said Im a minister  
A big shot in the state  
I said I just cant  
Believe it boy  
I think its great  
Brother can you tell me  
What is right and what is wrong  
He said keep on rocking baby  
Til the night is gone  
  
On and on and on  
Keep on rocking baby  
Til the night is gone  
  
Over in the corner  
I could see this other guy  
He was kinda flirty  
He was giving me the eye  
So I took advantage  
Of the fact that Im a star  
Shook my hair and took  
A casual stroll up to the bar  
And as sure as hell  
This guy was coming up to me  
He said who am I and  
Who are you and who are we  
Whats our situation do  
We have some time for us  
I said I was not exactly  
Waiting for the bus  
He said if youre going  
Somewhere can I come along  
I said keep on rocking baby  
Til the night is gone  
  
On and on and on  
Keep on rocking baby  
Til the night is gone
