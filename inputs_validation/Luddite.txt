Verse 1  
We were weavers highly skilled  
To things were mechanised  
Craft and artisanship killed  
A threat to all our lives  
  
Verse 2  
Machines meant the workforce shrunk  
You think youd see us settle  
When bosses said Lets junk each punk  
And replace you With heavy metal  
  
Chorus  
Luddite Luddite Luddite Luddite Luddites  
The working man was sacrificed  
Luddite Luddite Luddite Luddite Luddites  
Turned us in to anarchists  
  
Verse 3  
Industrial reolution  
Our old life over thrown  
So we came up with a solution  
A revolution of our own  
  
Verse 4  
Met in the hills and planned to smash  
Their weaving machines of gloom  
Hear that sweet music as we bash  
A wop bam a loom ahh A wop bam boom  
  
Chorus  
Luddite Luddite Luddite Luddite Luddites  
Industrial weaving its a stitch up  
Luddite Luddite Luddite Luddite Luddites  
Break the device and smash my swtich up  
  
Verse 5  
We named our movement after ned ludd  
A folk hero who myth proclaimed  
Once reacted in a fit of rage  
By smashing up some knitting frames  
  
Verse 6  
So we formed the new luddite army  
Started to riot  
It all went barmy  
  
Verse 7  
Laws were passed to shake our wills  
Sent solders armed with guns  
All though we tried to break things still  
We fought the law but the law won  
  
Verse 8  
Trial and punisments were seen  
Its clear we lost the fight  
But thanks to our rage against the machine  
Now carries the name  
Luddite  
  
Chorus  
Luddite Luddite Luddite Luddite Luddites  
This band struggles carries on  
Luddite Luddite Luddite Luddite Luddites  
Wont rest to machines are all gone
