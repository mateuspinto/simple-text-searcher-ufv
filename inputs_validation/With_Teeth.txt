She comes along  
She gets inside  
Shes better than anything youve tried  
Its her kiss  
The black seal  
It runs deeper than you can dare to dream it could be  
  
With teeth  
With teeth  
With teeth  
With teeth  
  
Wave goodbye  
To what you were  
The rules have changed  
The lines begin to blur  
  
She makes you hard  
She comes on strong  
Youve finally found  
The place where you belong  
  
With teeth  
With teeth  
With teeth  
With teeth  
  
I cannot go through this again
