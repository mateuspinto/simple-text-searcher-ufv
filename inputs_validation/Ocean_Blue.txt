Taking some time in the still  
Memories lead me far away  
The sun is dancing on the sea  
I thank the gods for today  
  
Ocean blue  
Blue my sky  
Spell of you  
Colours my mind  
Floating in time  
Thinking of you  
Ocean blue  
  
Giving in to my questions  
The silence shows me the way  
Making my mark on tomorrow  
Doing nothing today  
  
Ocean blue  
Blue my sky  
Spell of you  
Colours my mind  
Floating in time  
Thinking of you  
Ocean blue  
  
Living and dreaming always believing  
Living and dreaming always believing  
  
Ocean blue  
Blue my sky  
Spell of you  
Colours my mind  
Floating in time  
Thinking of you  
Ocean blue
