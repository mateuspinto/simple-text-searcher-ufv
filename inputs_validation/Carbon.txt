carbon made found her at the  
End of a chain time to race  
She said race the downhill  
Behind crystalline irises  
Loons can drive  
Where the world bleeds white  
Just keep your eyes on her  
Keep  
Dont look away  
Keep your eyes on her horizon  
Bear claw free fall  
A gunners view black and blue  
Shred in ribbons of lithium  
Blow by blow  
Her mind cut in sheets  
Layers deep now unravelling  
Just keep your eyes on her  
Get me Neil on the line  
No I cant hold  
Have him read snow glass apples  
Where nothing is what it seems  
Little sis you must crack this  
He says to me  
you must go in again carbon  
Made only wants to be unmade  
Blade to ice its  
Double diamond time  
And keep your eyes on her  
On her eyes on her horizon
