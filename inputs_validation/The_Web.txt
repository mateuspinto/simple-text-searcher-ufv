The rain auditions at my window  
Its symphony echoes in my womb  
My gaze scans the walls of this apartment  
To rectify the confines of my tomb  
  
Im the cyclops in the tenement  
Im the soul without the cause  
Crying midst my rubber plants ignoring beckoning doors  
Clippings from ancient newspapers lie scattered cross the floor  
Stained by the wine from a shattered glass  
Meaningless words  
Yellowed by time  
Faded photos exposing pain  
Celluloid leeches bleeding my mind  
Christ youve finished playing hangman  
Youve cast the fateful dice  
Advice advice advice me this shroud will not suffice  
And thus begins the web  
  
Attempting to discard these clinging memories  
I only serve to wallow in our past  
I fabricate the weave with my excuses  
Its strands I hope and pray shall last  
Oh please do last  
Oh please do last  
  
The fly trap needs the insects  
Ivy caresses the wall  
Needles make love to the junkies  
The sirens seduce with their call  
Confidence has deserted me with you it has forsaken me  
Confused and rejected despised and alone I kiss isolation on its fevered
brow  
Security clutching me  
Obscurity threatening me  
Christ your reasons were so obvious as my friends have qualified  
I only laughed away your tears but even jesters cry  
But even jesters cry  
  
I realize I hold the key to freedom  
Oh I cannot let my life be ruled by threads  
The time has come to make decisions  
The changes have to be made  
  
I realize I hold the key to freedom  
I cannot let my life be ruled by threads  
The time has come to make decisions  
The changes have to be made  
  
Now I leave you  
The past does have its say  
Youre all but forgotten  
A mote in my heart  
Decisions have been made  
Theyve been made  
  
Decisions have been made  
Ive conquered my fears all my fears  
The flaming shroud the flaming shroud  
Thus ends the web the web the web the web the web
