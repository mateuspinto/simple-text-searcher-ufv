Feel on baby  
Feel on baby  
Feel on baby  
Feel on baby  
Feel on baby  
Feel on baby  
Feel on baby  
  
When I travel coast to coast  
Youre the hook up I miss the most  
In the motel youre the ghost  
Other women dont come close  
  
Feel on baby  
Feel on baby  
Feel on baby  
Feel on baby  
  
From the first time such a crush  
Such excitement such a rush  
In the kitchen in the car  
In the ditch on the dirty floor  
  
Feel on baby  
Feel on baby  
Feel on baby  
  
Feel on baby  
Feel on baby  
Feel on baby  
Feel on baby  
Feel on baby  
Feel on baby  
  
Wanderlust and love disease  
Taken over and strangled me  
Cure my body make me whole  
Feed my body feed my soul  
  
Feel on baby  
Got to feel on  
Got to feel on  
Feel on feel on  
Got to feel on  
Got to feel on  
Got to feel on  
  
Got to feel on  
Got to feel on  
Feel on baby  
Baby baby baby baby
