twas just a garden in the rain  
Close to a little leafy lane  
A touch of color neath skies of gray  
  
The raindrops kissed the flower beds  
The blossoms raised their thirsty heads  
A perfumed Thank you they seemed to say  
  
Surely here was charm beyond compare  to view  
Maybe it was just that I was there  with you  
  
twas just a garden in the rain  
But then the sun came out again  
And sent us happily on our way  
  
instrumental  
  
twas just a garden in the rain  
But then that sun came out again  
And sent us happily on our way
