People never change  
They seem to stay the same  
They wear different clothes  
But play the same games  
  
Many different ways  
To say the same thing  
Searching for the right words  
The ones that would make you stay  
  
Exchanging the way things were  
For they way that they should be  
Yeah  
And choosing theses words  
Is saying to her  
The things that she never heard  
But always deserved  
  
I figured what it is all about  
Its you that I could never live without  
Your everything  
The air that I breathe  
Stupid not to know it all along  
And everything I ever did was wrong  
Sadly its too late for sorry  
  
Oh Im not even really sure  
Who made this mess  
And who threw what punch  
But I could not care less  
All I know is that Im here  
And you are not oh  
Once I put this wasted pride aside  
Nothings all I got oh  
  
Exchanging the way things were  
For they way that they should be yeah  
  
And choosing theses words  
Is saying to her  
The things that she never heard  
But always deserved  
  
I figured what it is all about  
Its you that I could never live without  
Your everything  
The air that I breathe  
Stupid not to know it all along  
And everything I ever did was wrong  
Sadly its too late for sorry  
  
Oh  
Somebody make it stop  
Yeah  
And pick me up  
And just dust me off oh  
The rainy day flood  
Will drowned all this love  
Trapped at the bottom now  
Please dig me up  
  
I figured what it is all about  
Its you that I could never live without  
Your everything  
The air that I breathe  
Stupid not to know it all along  
And everything I ever did was wrong  
Sadly its too late for sorry  
  
I figured what it is all about  
Its you that I could never live without  
Your everything  
The air that I breathe  
Stupid not to know it all along  
And everything I ever did was wrong  
Sadly its too late for sorry
