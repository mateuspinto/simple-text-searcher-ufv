I know a fat girl she wears a orange skirt  
You give her twenty dollars and you can do work  
Shell take food stamps and a travellers check  
Because her hair and her face and her lifes a wreck  
She wears a bright blond wig some high heeled pumps  
Shes down in the dumps so shes sellin her rump  
Shes a hot little momma and she works every day  
If you want to pay to play heres where she stays  
Shes at the  
  
Chorus  
Bristol Hotel Room 515  
The Bristol Hotel Where that at Jamaica Queens  
  
I seen her standin there slutty as could be  
Offering the putty for a ittybitty fee  
Every red light shell come over to your ride  
Or shes standin in the doorway tellin you to come inside  
The Bristol Hotel cause it aint no thing  
And her meat tastes better than Burger King  
Japanese executives in threepiece suits  
Glasses all foggy when they come in the place  
The girlies in the Bristol theyre all in cahoots  
He fell asleep and got robbed and cold chumped his face at the  
  
Chorus  
  
Party people check the story cause the story is ill  
Its the story of two men one Harold one Bill  
They went inside the Bristol on a Saturday night  
Harold was cool but Bill felt uptight  
The girlies made attempts but Harold played it cool  
Never ever rush thats the golden rule  
I been comin to the Bristols ten years of my life  
Ayo what the hell Yo man thats my wife

Chorus  
  
You see a Bristol girl is a one of a kind  
And if you know her good enough she wont make you stand on line  
Shell let you inside make you pay for the ride  
Take off her pants and then it smells like somebody died  
You say What the heck because you already paid  
Not knowin that the guy that went before you had AIDS  
Bang bang boogie she was so amusin  
Next week youre at the clinic gettin blood transfusions  
At the
