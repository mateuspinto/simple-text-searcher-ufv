Cover my eyes  
The light falls on her face  
Dangerous lines  
Dangerous colors and shapes  
Ferocious designs  
Connected and ready to play  
Buttoned up tight  
Crimson and Halloweenwhite  
  
Shes like the girl in the movie when the Spitfire falls  
Like the girl in the picture that he couldnt afford  
Shes like the girl with the smile in the hospital ward  
Like the girl in the novel in the wind on the moors  
  
Pain and heaven  
Pain and heaven  
  
The meaning of life  
A hair falls out of place  
Cover my eyes  
Dangerous colors and shapes  
And when she moves  
Cover my eyes  
  
She like the girl on the TV with the red guitar  
Like the girl with the dealer at the end of the bar  
Shes like the girl with the smile in the dream in the dark  
Like the girl overtaking in the open car  
  
Pain and heaven  
Pain and heaven
