Anytime anytime anytime anytime you want me  
Come on back come on home  
Ran away and left me alone in this empty place  
Anywhere I go whoa whoa all I see is your sweet face  
Though my pain keeps on growing  
Theres one thing baby you should be knowing  
Anytime you want me come on back  
Anytime you want me come on back  
Anytime you want me come on back whoa yeah  
Tried to make you happy the very best I could  
Anything you wanted whoa whoa just like a good man should  
Even though you did me wrong  
Ill be waiting no matter how long  
Anytime you want me Ill be here  
Anytime you want me I promise Ill be here baby  
Anytime you want me Ill be by your side whoa yeah  
Said Ill forgive you for everything in the past  
All I need is one more chance I know I know it will last  
Now you heard my story know just whats on my mind  
Tired of being lonely whoa whoa Ive had my share of crying  
Without you I cant go on  
Ill be waiting no matter how long  
Anytime you want me anytime you want me  
Anytime you want me anytime you need me  
Anytime you want me anytime you want me now  
Oh oh oh anytime you want me
