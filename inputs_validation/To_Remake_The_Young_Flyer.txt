To remake the young flyer  
Yes we must define his high desire  
Stand erect and not detect  
The anythings that we could not admire  
  
From a long line of high men  
Number one is that the one to send  
To restore all the trial  
This and then the national pride so proud  
  
A question to the lunatic  
Does your day seem like night  
Does your world go to heaven  
  
Gallant men dash forth  
He takes his place  
He ends the laughter of the slaughter daughters  
Takes his softness from his hand and goes  
  
To remake the young flyer  
Yes we must define his high desire
