Sugar cube drop into a yellow cup  
What makes the world just waking up  
Resolve  
Dissolve  
Who knows where on earth its going to stop  
I cant hear you cause were breaking up  
Dissolve  
  
And the stones in the track make work for the mechanic  
The birds all fly from the branches in a panic  
And a backfire echoes down the hillside  
As the last headline report dies  
Dissolve  
  
Ice is melting at the distant Pole  
The gin and tonic glasses overflow  
Dissolve  
The precious little else that I could say  
Your stupid tears of laughter washed away  
Dissolve  
  
While the poisonous light pours from the picture palace  
And it flickers on tries so hard to be scandalous  
A child keeps beating on a toy drum  
And the tablets dropped on your tongue  
Dissolve  
  
So salute me in moving frame  
I might not be there when you look again  
The mourning border card behind the clock  
The hour that he passed unwound and stopped  
Dissolve
