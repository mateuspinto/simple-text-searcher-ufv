I am just a girl  
One among the others nothing much to say  
Plain and simple girl  
Not a special type in any way  
Just one look and you will surely see  
That the true Miss Nobody is me  
Its an evil world  
That has only made me a girl  
  
I am just a girl  
Not the kind of woman men would like to meet  
Just another girl  
No one ever looks at in the street  
But today I cant believe its true  
When you smiled and whispered I love you  
Darling I could see  
I was meant to be your girl  
  
Its a funny feeling when you get to love someone  
And thinking that hell never look your way  
But then he says he loves you and life has just begun  
Its so much more than any words can say  
  
I am just a girl  
Not the kind of woman men would like to meet  
Just another girl  
No one ever looks at in the street  
But today I cant believe its true  
When you smiled and whispered I love you  
Darling I could see  
I was meant to be your girl  
  
La la la la la  
  
But today I cant believe its true  
When you smiled and whispered I love you  
Darling I could see  
I was meant to be your girl
