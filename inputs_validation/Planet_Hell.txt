Denying the lying  
A million children fighting  
For lives in strife  
For hope beyond the horizon  
  
A dead world  
A dark path  
Not even crossroads to choose from  
All the blood red  
Carpets before me  
Behold this fair creation of God  
  
My only wish to leave behind  
All the days of the Earth  
This everyday hell of my kingdom come  
  
The 1st rock thrown again  
Welcome to hell little Saint  
Mother Gaia in slaughter  
Welcome to paradise Soldier  
  
My 1st cry never ending  
All life is to fear for life  
You fool you wanderer  
You challenged the gods and lost  
  
Save yourself a penny for the ferryman  
Save yourself and let them suffer  
In hope  
In love  
This world aint ready for The Ark  
Save yourself a penny for the ferryman  
Save yourself and let them suffer  
In hope  
In love  
Mankind works in mysterious ways  
  
Save yourself a penny for the ferryman
