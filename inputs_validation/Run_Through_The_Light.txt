I asked my love to give me shelter  
And all she offered me were dreams  
Of all the moments spent together  
That move like never ending streams  
  
Run to the light  
Everything is alright  
Run thro the light of day  
You run to the light of night  
  
And every movement made together  
Till every thought was just the same  
And all the pieces fit forever  
In the game  
  
Welcome to the light  
Now everything is okay  
Run thro the light of night  
You run to the light of day
