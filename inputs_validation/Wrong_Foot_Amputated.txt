Wrong foot amputated  
Wrong foot amputated  
He got the wrong foot amputated  
The doctor had compassion he tried to cure my disease  
I was sweating on the way to the op room gave me sedatives to put me at ease  
They put me on a gurney in a hospital gown  
They gave me anesthetic and they set my legs down  
You wont fell a thing is what the doctor told me  
Were gonna whack it off whack it off whack it off whack it off  
Hey man you must be kidding me take a look  
He got the wrong foot amputated  
Hey you should have cut the other knee take a bow  
He got the wrong foot amputated  
Hey that leg was mine you mean to tell me that this stuff happens all the
time  
Hey this aint my day
