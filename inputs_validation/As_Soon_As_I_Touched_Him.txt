He came to me like a bright idea  
Shining like the sun  
And the way his eyes burned into mine  
I knew he must be the one  
Oh he drew me in like a magnet does  
So I couldnt pull away  
But the kind of lovin that I gave to him  
Im not ashamed to say  
Oh as soon as I touched him  
Soon as I touched him I felt like a woman  
And the feelin made me close my eyes  
Soon as I touched I was born again  
An I heard myself cryin like a new born baby cries  
He told me what I meant to him  
Swore that I was sent to him  
All my lovin went to him  
Now hes gone oh hes gone  
Now I hide myself from the light of day  
So no one else can see  
A part of him that I cant forget  
Thats growin deep inside of me  
Oh as soon as I touched him  
Soon as I touched him I felt like a woman  
And the feelin made me close my eyes  
Soon as I touched I was born again  
An I heard myself cryin like our new born baby cries  
Soon as I touched him  
As soon as I touched him I felt like a woman  
And the feelin made me close my eyes  
Soon as I touched him  
As soon as I touched him
