Refrain  
Biscuits in the oven gonna watch em rise  
Biscuits in the oven gonna watch em rise  
Biscuits in the oven gonna watch em rise  
Right before my very eyes  
  
When they get ready gonna jump and shout  
  
Roll my eyes and bug them outhey hey  
  
Gonna clap my hands and stomp my feet  
Right before the very next beat  
  
Refrain  
  
Gonna look both ways when I cross the street  
Gonna take my time when the light turns green
