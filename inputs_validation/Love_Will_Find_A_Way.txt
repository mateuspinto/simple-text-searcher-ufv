You want to get close to me  
The feeling so clear  
But I need some time to see  
Vision through my tear  
You want to get next to me  
I need your intrusion  
I dont need to be  
Blinded by confusion  
  
Here is my heart  
Waiting for you  
Here is my soul  
I eat at chez nous  
  
Love will find a way  
If you want it to  
Love will find a way  
Love will find a way for me and you  
  
Love will find a way  
Love will find a way  
Love will find a way  
Love will find a way  
  
So you want to get over me  
And thats how you feel  
Everything you want to be  
Seems so unreal  
I want to be all of you  
And thats the confusion  
Its so hard for me  
To draw a conclusion  
  
Here is my heart  
Waiting for you  
Here is my soul  
I eat at chez nous  
  
Love will find a way  
If you want it to  
Love will find a way  
Love will find a way  
  
Love will find a way  
If you want it to  
Love will find a way  
Love will find a way  
  
Love will find a way  
I believe that theres a way  
If you want it to  
Will love find a way  
Love will find a way  
Will love find a way  
Love will find a way
