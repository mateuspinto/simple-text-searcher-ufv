That girl sitting over there is defined as the worlds finest Paramount
Pyramid  
  
I met this  
Beekeeper seeks Ruth  
That kind of timing just isnt happening  
Not today not on any day  
The flying party is here  
But the constellation is right  
For a lovely flight  
A special strategy for the warlocks to her  
And his magical flute will sing you the truth  
Beekeeper seeks Ruth  
Flying party is here  
Zookeeper keeps her  
Beekeeper seeks Ruth  
Zookeeper keeps her  
  
Hello James the sun loves you  
Get your fear in gear  
The flying party is here  
Goodbye Im flying  
To meet brother monkey  
The timing just isnt happening not today not on any day  
Beekeeper seeks Ruth  
Zookeeper keeps her  
Zookeeper zookeeper zookeeper  
The flying party is here  
Flying party is here  
Ohoh  
Flying party is here  
My  prevalent battleshipped
