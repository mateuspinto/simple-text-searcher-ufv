Well I was thumbin from Montgomery  
Had my guitar on my back  
When a stranger stopped beside  
Me in an antique cadillac  
He was dressed like nineteen fifty  
Half drunk and hollow eyed  
He said its a long walk to Nashville son would you like a ride  
  
I sat down in the front seat he turned on the radio  
And them sad old songs coming out of them speakers  
Was solid country gold  
  
Then I noticed the stranger was ghost white pale  
When he asked me for a light  
And I knew there was something strange about this ride  
  
Chorus  
  
He said Drifter can you make folks cry when you play and sing  
Have you paid your dues can you moan the blues  
Can you bend them guitar strings  
He said Boy can you make folks feel what you feel inside  
cause if yourr big star bound let me warn ya its a long hard ride   
  
Then he cried just south of Nashville  
And he turned that car around  
He said This is where you get off boy  
Because Im going back to Alabam  
As I stepped out of that cadillac  
I said mister many thanks  
He said you dont have to call me mister mister  
The whole world called me hank  
  
Chorus 2x  
  
If youre big star bound let me warn ya  
Its a long hard ride
