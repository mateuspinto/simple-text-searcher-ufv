You aint got no kind of feeling inside  
I got something that will sure nuff set your stuff on fire  
You refuse to put anything before your pride  
I got something that will knock all your pride aside  
  
Tell me something good tell me tell me tell me  
Tell me that you love me  
Tell me something good tell me tell me tell me  
Tell me that you like it yeah  
  
Got no time is what youre known to say  
Ill make you wish there were 48 hours to each day  
Problem is you aint been loved like you should  
What I got to give will sure nuff do you good
