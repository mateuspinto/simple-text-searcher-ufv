We push back the gates we open the door  
Together we come to meet with you Lord  
Yes we push back the gates we open the door  
Together we come oh to meet with you Lord  
  
Here we are at the threshold of glory  
Every eye now focused on you  
The heart in my chest beats wildly  
As each step bring us closer to you  
  
Magnificent one  
Merciful judge  
We rejoice and sing  
In the favor of our God
