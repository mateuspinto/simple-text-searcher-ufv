Rap lyrics  
We have to give all the glory to the King of Kings  
And give honor and praise for long life and blessings now raise your hands up
wave them up in the sky and glorify the lord for hes the source of my life  
  
You are the source of my life  
And hope my life and hope is in you  
  
I will live and not die  
In Your presence satisfy  
X3  
  
You are the source of my life  
And hope of my life and hope is in you  
  
I will live and not die  
In Your presence satisfy  
X3  
  
You are the source of my life  
And hope and lover of my soul  
My future holder  
Day for sustainer  
Pass Redeemer  
  
For ever and ever and ever  
Por siempre  
  
With long life  
You will satisfy me  
You will satisfy me

You are the sustainer  
Your are the air I breath
