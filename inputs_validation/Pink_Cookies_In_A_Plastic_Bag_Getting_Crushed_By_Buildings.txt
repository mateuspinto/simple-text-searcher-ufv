Chorus  
Pink cookies in a plastic bag getting crushed by buildings  
Pink cookies in a plastic bag getting crushed by buildings  
  
Ill take 30 electric chairs  
And put em in a classroom  
30 MCs  
And setem free from their doom  
Just like a tomahawk cuts through the wind  
When we begin  
The wheel of fortune it spins  
Holdin  
The rhythm like elastic  
Moldin  
Your whole body like plastic  
So why try to deny what ya already know ya love  
Up above  
Cause the mania  
Hysteria  
In the streets  
While ya lovers getting merrier  
In the sheets  
I met this lady named  
Sweet young thing and  
She gave me that feeling  
That sunshine bring in  
Hordable  
Sportable  
Totally affordable  
Silky smooth  
Voice was real audible  
I said your cool as Ice Cuba  
She said your that Public Enemy  
I seen on the tuba  
No  
Im like your Uncle baby  
The style of your beautiful face  
Drives me crazy  
Well can we do ya so Heavy ah D  
She said You tried to play me  
Like Big Daddy  
I said I know your Tribe  
I Called and reQuested  
For you to be manifested  
She said You know the Same Gang and my Flava Unit too  
I said You only knew the certain things I wanna do do you  
Rub ya down with warm IceT  
Make ya feel Bran Nubian  
Instantly  
Boogie Down  
And check this Production  
Gimme them lips  
They look good for suction  
She said Sweet tease  
Cool with a little almond joy  
On the side  
Just doin the fly  
You like pound cake  
Comin to my house  
Turn on the lights  
And see me on the couch  
I said Do the jingle  
And your from around the way  
I like your earrings  
Ls  
But anyway  
Your granddaddy is  
Here to spread cheer  
Something nice and smooth  
With my tongue in your ear  
Give me a snack  
Some Salt And Pepper on a burger  
Ice Cube T  
Or if you prefer the  
Taste of honey Kid  
Ride in my Capri and  
Thats the joint  
They got the real clear CD in  
She said Stars couldnt get me in a car  
I dont know what type of man ya are  
You might know karate  
Do me and get away  
I got a glimpse of your license plate  
NWA  
  
Chorus x2  
  
She was Chubby and  
Ready to Rock  
Naughty By Nature and  
Part of my private stock and  
Riding in the relax  
Frame of mind and  
Hammer timing  
Incredible  
So edible  
And unforgettable  
Soft like a QTip  
Id love to get with you  
Cause Im the type of guy that got props do  
Feel it in mo and more  
When I get ready for a showcase  
Put together well  
I go deep  
And have an oil well  
Show and tell  
I said YoYo  
Youre so intelligent  
And elegant  
I nI never Run to be D  
With another MC  
I got what I want  
Right in front of me  
I know a kid named K  
Hes a MD  
Last time I heard  
Yo was getting real friendly  
Belly to belly and  
Chest to chest  
Thigh by thigh  
Leg by leg and  
I guess  
Aint no way to get ya out  
Your so caught up SEXUAL  sort  
Of a freaky situation  
With a peppermint twist  
Ricky or Mike is next on the list  
Nastified and allfunkified  
Comeon  
Comeon  
Comeon  
Ride  
Can you hear  
Never fear  
Whatcha hear  
What ya hear  
Is it clear  
Understand  
And love ya big dear  
And I will appear  
My dear  
With a beer  
And bags full of cheer  
And waterbed  
Yeah  
Cause I rumble and groan  
She said You got to be bad to  
Make the moanie moan  
Aint no reason to front  
On the way your life shown  
Booya  
How Im jumpin your bones  
Like a Grand  
Master in a Flash  
Put out your cigarette  
And rest your tired ash  
All I wanna do  
Is make woopie  
Your my pink cookie  
Not a wookie  
When you take it off  
Id love a lookie  
Cause Ima mix it up toss style  
Peace out  
You got the sexual profile
