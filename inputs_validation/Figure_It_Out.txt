Im happy you came to me first  
Before the bubble burst  
Im happy you answered my calls  
Im bouncing off the walls  
Impossible to be tamed  
Her need celophane  
Im happy you like to play games  
Why did you run away  
  
We could spend some time together  
What he had hell never know  
Your boyfriend gives you no respect  
And I can see your getting it  
So lets figure it out lets go  
  
Im happy youre so impulsive  
Means that your passionate  
Im happy youre moving so fast  
But will it ever last  
I know you wanna break free  
From this monotony  
Im happy youre coming with me  
But by choice its gotta be  
  
We can spend some time together  
What he has hell never know  
Your boyfriend gives you no respect  
And I can see your getting it  
  
So figure it out lets go  
  
Im happy youre changing your speed  
Slow down and lay with me  
On bottom but always discrete  
Kneel down and kiss her feet  
Im happy your going too far  
Full strength before we start  
Sometimes you make it so hard  
Scream loud as we come apart  
  
We can spend some time together  
What he had hell never know  
Your boyfriend gives you no respect  
And I can see your getting it  
So figure it out lets go  
  
We can spend some time together  
What he has hell never know  
Your boyfriend gives you no respect  
And I can see your getting it  
So figure it out lets go  
Figure it out lets go  
Figure it out lets go  
Figure it out lets  
Go
