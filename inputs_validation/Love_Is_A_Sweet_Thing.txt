He was sitting on a corner with a bottle of beer  
And the same shopping cart hed been pushing for years  
A big smile on his face  
Like the first day of spring  
All the people looked the other way but they heard him sing  
And he sang  
  
Love  
Love is a sweet thing  
He sang love  
Love is a sweet thing  
  
She shot out of Texas  
Like a bullet from a gun  
With a van full of hippies and a band on the run  
She didnt want to be famous  
She just wanted to play  
In old dive bars and pool halls she got up on stage  
And she sang  
  
Love  
Love is a sweet thing  
Oh yes it is  
She sang love  
Love is a sweet sweet thing  
  
Its everywhere you look  
If you look hard enough  
Its really not hard to see  
Yeah once you put your arms around it  
You can never get too much  
Love is a sweet sweet thing  
  
Its in the smile of a stranger  
In the eyes of a child  
On the corner of a crowded street  
Its everywhere around us  
Its always growing wild  
Love is a sweet sweet thing  
  
Love  
Love is a sweet thing  
I sang love love love  
Love is a sweet thing  
Love  
Love is a sweet thing  
Oh yes it is  
  
I sang love love love  
Love is a sweet sweet thing  
Oh baby  
Love  
Love is a sweet thing  
I sang love  
Love is a sweet sweet thing
