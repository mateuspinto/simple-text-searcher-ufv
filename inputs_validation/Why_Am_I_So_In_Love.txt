Chris Brown  
You know what Im thinkin  
You know that its you  
But some things need perfection  
Unlike you  
  
Chris Brown and Rihanna  
So why am I so in love  
Your the best thing in my life and always will be  
  
Rihanna  
Im so glad your mine  
You mean the world to me  
  
Chris Brown  
Your like a summers day  
  
Both  
I asked for your love  
You gave it to me  
I needed your trust  
The same as can be  
  
Rihanna  
I thought I would lose you  
But I knew I was wrong  
  
Chris brown  
So why did it have to happen  
When you sing this song  
  
Both  
I know my mistakes  
So light as a dove  
I learn from them all  
Why am I so in love  
  
Rihanna  
Coz I need to know  
Whats in my heart  
  
Chris Brown  
Like a love  
In my love chart  
  
Chorus  
Both  
I asked for your love  
You gave it to me  
I needed your trust  
The same as can be  
Repeat chorus  
  
Both  
My love is strong  
Why am I so in love
