Never made it as a wise man  
I couldnt cut it as  
A poor man stealing  
Tired of living like a blind man  
Im sick of sight without  
A sense of feeling  
And this is how you remind me  
  
This is how you remind me  
Of what I really am  
This is how you remind me  
Of what I really am  
  
Its not like you to say sorry  
I was waiting on a different story  
This time Im mistaken  
For handing you  
A heart worth breaking  
And Ive been wrong  
Ive been down  
Into the bottom of every bottle  
These five words in my head  
Scream  
Are we having fun yet  
  
Yeah yeah yeah no no  
Yeah yeah yeah no no  
  
Its not like you didnt know that  
I said I love you and  
I swear I still do  
And it must have been so bad  
Cause living with him must have  
Damn near killed you  
  
And this is how you remind me  
Of what I really am  
This is how you remind me  
Of what I really am  
  
Its not like you to say sorry  
I was waiting on a different story  
This time Im mistaken  
For handing you  
A heart worth breaking  
And Ive been wrong  
Ive been down  
Into the bottom of every bottle  
These five words in my head  
Scream  
Are we having fun yet  
  
Yeah yeah yet no no  
Yeah yeah yeah no no  
Yeah yeah yeah no no  
Yeah yeah yeah no no  
  
Never made it as a wise man  
I couldnt cut it as  
A poor man stealing  
And this is how you remind me  
This is how you remind me  
  
This is how you remind me  
Of what I really am  
This is how you remind me  
Of what I really am  
  
Its not like you to say sorry  
I was waiting on a different story  
This time Im mistaken  
For handing you  
A heart worth breaking  
And Ive been wrong  
Ive been down

These five words in my head  
Scream  
Are we having fun yet
