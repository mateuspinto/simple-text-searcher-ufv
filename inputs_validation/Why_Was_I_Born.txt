Why was I born Why am I livin  
What do I get What am I givin  
Why do I want a thing I darent hope for  
What can I hope for I wish I knew  
  
Why do I try to draw you near me  
Why do I cry You never hear me  
Im a poor fool but what can I do  
Why was I born to love you  
  
Why was I born Why am I livin  
What do I get What am I givin  
Why do I want a thing I darent hope for  
What can I hope for I wish I knew
