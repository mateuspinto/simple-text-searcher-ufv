When I see my baby  
When I see my little girl  
When I see my woman  
Im gonna tell her about the lonely hours I just spent  
And say the thing we got going hope it never ends  
Well Im gonna tell that little girl a thing or two  
  
Do it right baby  
Do it right baby  
Ahhh haaa  
Outta sight baby  
Ahhhha ha  
Do it right baby  
Do it right baby  
Ahhh haaa  
  
When I see my baby  
When I look in her pretty eyes  
When I get with my darling baby  
I say my heart will start to beat like a couple of drums  
Shell get my temperature to rise to bout a hundred and one  
  
Yeah  
Do it right baby  
Do it right baby  
Ahhh haaa  
Outta sight baby  
Ahhhha ha  
Do it right baby  
Do it right baby  
Ahhh haaa  
  
A whole day away from your woman  
A separation from your girl can really mess your mind  
And can you dig this one thing  
Well its lucky Im working from nine to five  
I have to live with my doctors just to keep me alive  
Keep on tellin a thing or two  
  
Do it right baby  
Do it right baby  
Ahhh haaa  
Outta sight baby  
Ahhhha ha  
Do it right baby  
Do it right baby  
Ahhh haaa
