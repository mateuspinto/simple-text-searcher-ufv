They call me Mr Knowitall  
I will not compromise  
I will not be told what to do  
I shall not step aside  
  
They call me Mr Knowitall  
I have no time to waste  
My mouth it spews pure intellect  
And Ive such elegant taste  
  
They call me Mr Knowitall  
I sup the aged wine  
Oh I could tell such wonderous tales  
If I should find the time  
  
I must be Mr Knowitall  
For ideas they come in bounds  
I am Mr Knowitall  
So spread the word around  
They call me Mr Knowitall  
  
I am so eloquent  
Perfection is my middle name  
And whatever rhymes with eloquent
