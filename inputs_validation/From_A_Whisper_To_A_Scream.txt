Oh its not easy to resist temptation  
Walking around looking like a figment of somebody elses imagination  
Taking evry word she says just like an open invitation  
But the power of persuasion is no match for anticipation  
  
Like a finger running down a seam  
From a whisper to a scream  
So I whisper and I scream  
But dont get me wrong  
Please dont leave me waitin too long  
Waitin too long  
Waitin too long  
Waitin too long  
Hey  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Oh if the customers like it then theyll keep on paying  
If they keep on drinking then theyll end up staying  
I heard someone say where have we met before  
But the one over the eight seem less like one or more like four  
  
Like a finger running down a seam  
From a whisper to a scream  
So I whisper and I scream  
But dont get me wrong  
Please dont leave me waitin too long  
Waitin too long  
Waitin too long  
Waitin too long  
Hey
