I don know why I love her like I do  
All the changes you put me through  
Take my money my cigarettes  
I haven seen the worst of it yet  
I wanna know that youll tell me  
I love to stay  
Take me to the river drop me in the water  
Take me to the river dip me in the water  
I don know why you treat me so bad  
Think of all the things we could have had  
Love is an ocean that I cant forget  
My sweet sixteen I would never regret  
  
I wanna know that youll tell me  
I love to stay  
Take me to the river drop me in the water  
Push me in the river dip me in the water  
Washing me down washing me  
Hug me squeeze me love me tease me  
Till I cant till I cant till I cant take no more of it  
  
I don know why I love you like I do  
All the troubles you put me through  
Sixteen candles there on my wall  
And here am I the biggest fool of them all  
  
I wanna know that youll tell me  
I love to stay  
Take me to the river and drop me in the water  
Dip me in the river drop me in the water
