Where can you find pleasure search the world for treasure learn science
technology  
Where can you begin to make your dreams all come true on the land or on the
sea  
Where can you learn to fly play in sports or skindive study oceanography  
Sign up for the big band or sit in the grandstand when your team and others
meet  
  
Chorus  
In the navy you can sail the seven seas  
In the navy you can put your mind at ease  
In the navy come on now people make a stand  
In the navy cant you see we need a hand  
In the navy come protect the mother land  
In the navy come on and join your fellow man  
In the navy come on people make a stand  
Inthe navy in the navy  
  
They want you They want you They want you as a new recruit  
  
If you like adventure dont you wait to enter the recruiting office fast  
Dont you hesitate there is no need to wait theyre signing up new seamen

Maybe you are too young to sign up today but dont you worry bout a thing  
For Im sure there will always be a good navy protecting the land and sea  
  
Chorus  
  
They want you They want you They want you as a new recruit X2  
  
 But but Im afraid of water  
 Hey Hey look men

They want you  oh my goodness  
They want you  what am I gonna do on a submarine  
They want you They want you  
In the navy  
  
Chorus
