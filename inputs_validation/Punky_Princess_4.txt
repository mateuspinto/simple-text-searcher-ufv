I saw you at the mall  
Trying on the clothes  
In that little blue stall  
I was watching your feet  
Then a piece of cheese hit the floor  
Ohhh yeah Floor  
ChorusIm just a punk princess  
Trying to make it through this life  
Trying to make everything alright  
But all I can picture is the cheese  
Ooh yeah cheese  
Why must you make me hurt so much  
Why must you eat so much cheese at lunch  
Why dont you just die and leave me here like I was  
DIE DIE DIE DIE Die like the Japs at Hiroshima when the atom  
Bomb hit their face and then they died  
chorus  
Actually dont die because thats mean  
And because MTV will break their contract with me  
So dont die  
Pleash  
Pleash is a word invented in Spain  
Pleash was invented to symbolize the pain  
The pain that youve put me through  
The pain that Ive gained  
But if you die it will all go away  
All go away  
All go away  
But actually dont die pleash because I kinda like you a little still  
But not a lot just a speck  
Like the cheese thats left after Ive raided through the fridge  
Why must you remind me of cheese  
I love cheese but not you  
I only love you a little  
Only a speck  
chorus  
chorus  
chorus
