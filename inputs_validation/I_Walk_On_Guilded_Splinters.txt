Some people think they jive me  
But I know they must be crazy  
Dont see their misfortune  
I guess theyre just too lazy  
Je suie le grand zombie  
My yellow belt of choisen  
Aint afraid of no tomcat  
Fill my brains with poison  
  
Walk through the fire  
Fly through the smoke  
See my enemy  
At the end of their rope  
Walk on pins and neeedles  
See what they can do  
Walk on guilded splinters  
With the King of the Zulu  
  
Walk to me get it come come  
Walk on guilded splinters  
Walk to me get it come come  
Walk on guilded splinters  
Till I burn up  
Till I burn up  
Till I burn up  
Till I burn up  
  
I roll out my coffin  
Drink poison in my chalice  
Pride begins to fade  
And you all feel my malice  
Put grisgris on your doorstep  
And soon you be in the gutter  
Melt your heart like butter  
Ananand I can make you stutter  
  
Walk to me get it come come  
Walk on guilded splinters  
Walk to me get it come come  
Walk on guilded splinters  
Till I burn up  
Till I burn up  
Till I burn up  
Till I burn up
