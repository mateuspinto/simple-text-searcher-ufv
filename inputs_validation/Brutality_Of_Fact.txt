Last of the trouble has followed through  
This  your potential to  
Ive seen your lifeline go out to you  
Sidestepping our convention  
  
But you always managed to find a way  
To avoid what the negative people say  
The sun will shine on a brighter day  
Stick to your own potential  
  
Failing hardly seems to bother you  
Winning was a compliment to failure  
  
A waking Earth is calling you  
Drive all night you cant sit still  
Here comes the torment that eats inside  
 those who wish you well  
  
The callings strong but how can you hear  
Receivers dead the transmissions clear  
The Moon will rise in your finest hour  
Lighting our potential  
  
Caught in perversion of our Human life  
Fall in confusion born of sacrifice  
  
But you always managed to find a way  
To avoid what the negative people say  
The sun will shine on a brighter day  
When you stick to your own potential  
Failing hardly seems to bother you  
Winning was a compliment to failure  
Failure  
  
Instrumental  
  
Failing hardly seems to bother you  
Winning was a compliment to failure  
Failure  
  
Spoken  
 to make a life Beckon it  
Bodies of great beauty could not surrender  
Their rationality fading in   
The security of sensation  
  
A historic harlequin  harks a mild  
The spirit of radio mortgage  
Holding their pre selection  
In the brutality of fact
