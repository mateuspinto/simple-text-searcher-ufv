When I saw you in the Garden  
Sweet lilac in your hair  
The sunlight seemed to surround you  
And bless the morning air  
I wondered what your name was  
And if you would dance with me  
I heard you cry for mercy  
But my eyes they could not see  
  
Cause the time is right for love  
The time is right for love  
You can pray to the Lord above  
But the time is right for love  
  
So much for all your sweet words  
All that you said you would do  
Remember all my love songs  
They were promises to you  
But I dont hold it against you  
I know youre not to blame  
So draw your circle around me  
And well put all your lovers to shame  
  
Cause the time is right for love  
The time is right for love  
You can pray to the Lord above  
But the time is right for love  
  
Cause the time is right for love  
The time is right for love  
You can pray to the Lord above  
But the time is right for love
