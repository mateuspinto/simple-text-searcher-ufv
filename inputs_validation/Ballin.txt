Like a star slipping out of place  
Sliding from the sky  
Tumbling through space  
When you touch my hand  
I swear I feel like Im ballin  
Ballin Ballin Ballin Ballin  
Yeh ballin  
Ballin Ballin Ballin Ballin  
Like a wheel  
Whirling round and round  
Rolling down a hill rollin down a hill  
Spinning on the ground rollin down a hill  
Your kissing makes me dizzy yeh  
In the head ooh yeh  
And Im ballin  
Im ballin  
  
I love this game coz this game love me back  
Im pushing a lac smoking sacs like a mad mac  
Bringing me back banging the 8track track  
The Dramatics and Battle Cat and Snoop like that  
Big stars in big cars we pull up at the big clubs and sit at the big bars  
Sippin champagne with a bowl of cavier  
Hell yea you are yeah you are  
Say it say it cause they all deny it  
Player play it cause you cant deny it  
As fly as it get as fly as I spit you know its the shit  
Its so gangsta gangsta bitch  
Switch back to the old school old fools know  
This here thing we do so original  
I got to have it lavish  
Is how we establish  
On the real love one it feels good to have  
  
Like a rose flipping down the street  
Looking oh so sweet lookin oh so sweet  
Bumping to the beat bumping to the beat  
These streets they keep me busy yeh  
Makin bread  
And Im ballin  
Ballin Ballin Ballin Ballin  
Yeh ballin

Working for myself  
Cause it thrills me so  
I keep women on my line  
Cause they know  
That Im ballin  
Ballin Ballin Ballin Ballin

Now you can cruise if you choose but I prefer to do the chacha  
And once my small kitchen throw

Pimp pimp parade my nigga get your bang on  
Cause my uncles about to get their sang on  
And all round the world my nigga its the same song  
And when its time for your callin fallin wit no stallin  
Keep it ballin  
  
He starts to mill  
Just rollin true his town  
Stacking dollar bills stacking dollar bills  
Raising dogg pound he be raising the dog pound  
Because hes loved  
Loved in every city  
Thats why hes ballin  
Ballin Ballin Ballin Ballin

They say time brings change and change brings time
