Step into the misty mountains  
With your hair like ambered honey  
To feeling warm and breezes  
Let me sweetly  
  
Let me hear your sweet sweet laughter  
And your loving conversation  
And your innocent solution  
  
Give me love love love love love love love love  
Be my lifelong passion  
Give me love love love  
Make my lifelong passion  
Sail away  
Sail away  
Sail away  
Sail away  
  
You feel the warm and breezes  
You give me hands of warmth  
Give me one f your hands  
Let me hear your sweet sweet laughter  
Give me one of your hands  
Let me kiss your lips of silver  
Let me kiss your lips of silver  
  
Give me love love love love love love love love  
Be my lifelong passion  
Give me love love love  
Make my lifelong passion  
Give me love love love love love love love love  
Be my lifelong passion  
Give me love love love  
Make my lifelong passion  
Sail away  
Sail away  
Sail away  
Sail away  
  
Give me love love love  
Make my lifelong passion  
  
Loving conversation  
Loving conversation  
Innocent solution  
Make my lifelong passion
