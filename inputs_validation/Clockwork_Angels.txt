High above the city square  
Globes of light float in midair  
Higher still against the night  
Clockwork angels bathed in light  
  
You promise every treasure to the foolish and the wise  
Goddesses of mystery spirits in disguise  
Every pleasure we bow and close our eyes  
Clockwork angels promise every prize  
  
Clockwork angels spread their arms and sing  
Synchronized and graceful they move like living things  
Goddesses of Light of Sea and Sky and Land  
Clockwork angels the people raise their hands  As if to fly  
  
All around the city square  
Power shimmers in the air  
People gazing up with love  
To those angels high above  
  
Celestial machinery  move through your commands  
Goddesses of mystery so delicate and so grand  
Moved to worship we bow and close our eyes  
Clockwork angels promise every prize  
  
Lean not upon your own understanding  
Ignorance is well and truly blessed  
Trust in perfect love and perfect planning  
Everything will turn out for the best  
  
Stars aglow like scattered sparks  
Span the sky in clockwork arcs  
Hint at more than we can see  
Spiritual machinery
