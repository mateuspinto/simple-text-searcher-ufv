Been waiting here a long long time pain and trouble on my mind  
You came along and made me see oh you lifted me  
Shot up everything that our money could buy over and over tryin to find out  
why  
I was a sinkin ship on a stormy sea oh I found love  
I found love in a babys smile I found love in an old mans eye  
I found love in a lovers kiss ooh I found love  
All my friends thought I was cryin its strange to see a good man going  
down  
I gave all I had to give and you came along taught me how to live  
I want to thank you each and every day thank you baby for showin me the  
way  
I was a sinkin ship on a stormy sea oh I found love love love I found  
love
