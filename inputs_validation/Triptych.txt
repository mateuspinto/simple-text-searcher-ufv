Here the soil is barren  
Here nothing grows  
But crosses  
They know not what they do  
You your forgiveness  
Falls as dew  
Nailed upon a wooden frame  
Twisted yet unbroken  
Open mounted a silent choir  
Understood unspoken  
Never was there heard a sound  
Until the heavens opened  
Now the tide is turning  
To otherwordly yearning  
Through the suns eclipse seems final  
Surely he will rise again
