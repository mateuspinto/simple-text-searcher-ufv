You can haunt any house by yourself  
Be a man or a mouse by yourself  
You can act like a king on a thrown  
There are lots of things that you can do alone  
  
But it takes two to tango two to tango  
Two to really get the feeling of romance  
Two to tango two to tango do the dance of love  
You can sail on a ship by yourself  
  
Take a nap or nip by yourself  
You can get into debt on your own  
There are lots of things that you can do alone  
But it takes unknown  
  
You can get very old by yourself  
Catch a fish or a cold by yourself  
Dig a ditch or strike it rich all by yourself  
There are lots of things that you can do alone  
  
But it takes  
  
You can fight like a champ by yourself  
You can lick any stamp by yourself  
You can be very brave on the phone  
There are lots of things that you can do alone  
  
But it takes unknown  
It Takes two I say two  
Darling it always takes two  
Im with you
