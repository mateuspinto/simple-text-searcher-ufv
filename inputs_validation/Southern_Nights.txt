Southern nights  
have you ever felt a southern night  
Free as a breeze  
not to mention the trees  
Whistling tunes that you know and love so  
  
Southern nights  
just as good even when closed your eyes  
I apologize to anyone who can truly say  
That he has found a better way  
  
Southern skies  
have you ever noticed southern skies  
Its precious beauty lies just beyond the eye  
It goes running through your soul  
Like the stories told of old  
Old man  
he and his dog that walked the old land  
Evry flower touched his cold hand  
As he slowly walked by  
weeping willows  
Would cry for joy  
Joy  
  
Feel so good  
feel so good  
its frigthning  
Wish I could  
stop this world from fighting  
La da da da da da la da da da da da da da da  
  
Mysteries  
like this and many others in the trees  
Blow in the night  
in the southern skies  
  
Southern nights  
they feel so good its frightning     
Wish I could stop this world from fighting  
La da da da da da la da da da da da  
da da da da da da da da da da da
