Chorus  
I want to be the minority  
I dont need your authority  
Down with the moral majority  
Cause I want to be the minority  
  
I pledge allegiance to the underworld  
One nation under dog  
There of which I stand alone  
A face in the crowd  
Unsung against the mold  
Without a doubt  
Singled out  
The only way I know  
  
Chorus  
  
Stepped out of the line  
Like a sheep runs from the herd  
Marching out of time  
To my own beat now  
The only way I know  
One light one mind  
Flashing in the dark  
Blinded by the silence of a thousand broken hearts  
For crying out loud she screamed unto me  
A free for all  
Fuck em all  
Youre on your own side  
  
Chorus  
  
One light one mind  
Flashing in the dark  
Blinded by the silence of a thousand broken hearts  
For crying out loud she screamed unto me  
A free for all  
Fuck em all  
Youre on your own side  
  
Chorus
