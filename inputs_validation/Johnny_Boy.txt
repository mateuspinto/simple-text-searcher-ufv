He stays home from work this time  
He never really told his wife  
He never really told a lie but this time he decides that its alright  
Its alright  
No one really knows his mind and no one knows behind his eyes  
The man deserves a medal  
But hes never really won a prize before  
He goes to lock the door  
  
He is falling  
And though he knows its not  
The world looks down and frowns  
  
Get up Johnny boy get up Johnny boy  
Get up cause the world has left you lying on the ground  
Youre my pride and joy youre my pride and joy  
Get up Johnny boy because we all need you now  
  
We all need you now  
  
Someone said where you going  
Someone said to you goodbye  
They deflect the disrespect when they say that they blame it on the times  
They blame it on the time  
We all know youre qualified to fix a chair and love your wife  
They all know youre qualified but they lie when they blame it on the times  
And we blame it on the times  
  
Oh he is falling  
And though he knows its not  
The world looks down and frowns  
  
Get up Johnny boy get up Johnny boy  
Get up cause the world as left you lying on the ground  
Youre my pride and joy youre my pride and joy  
Get up Johnny boy because we all need you now  
  
We all need you now  
  
I will carry all your names and I will carry all your shame  
And I will carry all your names and I will carry all your shame  
And I will carry all your names and I will carry all your shame  
  
Get up Johnny boy get up Johnny boy  
Get up cause the world as left you lying on the ground  
Youre my pride and joy youre my pride and joy  
Get up Johnny boy because we all need you now  
Get up Johnny boy get up Johnny boy  
Get up cause the world as left you lying on the ground  
Youre my pride and joy youre my pride and joy  
Get up Johnny boy because we all need you now
