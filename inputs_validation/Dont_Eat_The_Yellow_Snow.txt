Dreamed I was an Eskimo  
Frozen wind began to blow  
Under my boots n around my toe  
Frost had bit the ground below  
It was a hundred degrees below zero  
  
And my mama cried  
And my mama cried  
Nanook anono  
Nanook anono  
Dont be a naughty Eskimo  
Save your money dont go to the show  
  
Well I turned around and I said oh oh oh  
Well I turned around and I said oh oh oh  
Well I turned around and I said ho ho  
And the northern lights commenced to glow  
And she said with a tear in her eye  
Watch out where the huskies go and dont you eat that yellow snow  
Watch out where the huskies go and dont you eat that yellow snow
