Way on down to Southern Alabama  
With the guitars jamming  
Thats where were headed  
Straight up to Butte Montana  
  
Singin Lord I was born a ramblin man  
California to Oregon  
Even New York City  
Got one or two hillbillies  
Ready to hit the road  
  
Its a brother and a sister kind of thing  
Raise up your hands if you all wanna hang with  
Me and my gang  
We live to ride we ride to live  
  
Me and my gang  
Jump on that train  
Grab hold of them reins  
Were gonna rock this thing  
  
Cock this thing  
Me and my gang yeah  
Yeah me and my gang  
  
We got hippies gypsies freaks and geeks  
High class women in daisy duke denim  
Bangin on gongs and singing our songs  
Dude named Elrock jammin on an IPod  
  
Beer and bonfires  
Wide open throttle Coors in a bottle  
Its all for one and one for all yall  
  
Its a brother and a sister kind of thing  
Raise up your hands if you all wanna hang with  
Me and my gang  
We live to ride we ride to live  
Me and my gang  
  
Jump on that train  
Grab hold of them reins  
Were gonna rock this thing  
Cock this thing  
Me and my gang yeah woo  
  
Its a brother and a sister kind of thing  
Raise up your hands if you all wanna hang  
With me and my gang  
We live to ride we ride to live  
  
Me and my gang  
Jump on that train  
Grab hold of them reins  
Were gonna rock this thing  
  
Cock this thing

Jump on that train
