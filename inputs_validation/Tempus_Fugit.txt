Born in the night  
She would run like a leopard  
That freaks at the sight  
Of a mind close beside herself  
And the nearer I came  
How the country would change  
She was using the landscape  
To hide herself  
  
More in the mind  
Than the body this feeling  
A sense at the end  
Of a circular line  
That is drawn at an angle  
I see when Im with you  
To navigate waters and finally answer toyes  
  
If you were there you would want to be near me  
Innocence you could hold all the materials  
And though nothing would really be living  
It would shock Your fall into landing light  
In the north sky time flies fast to the morning  
The cold of the dawn it meant nothing to us  
You were keeping your best situation  
An answer toyes  
  
Yes Yes And the moment I see you  
Yes Yes Its so good to be near you  
Yes Yes And the feeling you give me  
Yes Yes Makes me want to be with you  
Yes Yes From the moment you tell me  yes  
  
If you could see all the roads I have travelled  
Towards some unusable last equilibrium  
Run like an athlete and die like a dead beaten speedfreak  
An answer to all of your answers toyes  
  
In the north sky time flies faster than morning  
The cold of the dawn it meant nothing to us  
You were keeping your best situation  
An answer to Yes  
  
Yes Yes And the moment I see you  
Yes Yes Its so good to be near you  
Yes Yes And the feeling you give me  
Yes Yes Makes me want to be with you  
Yes Yes If we wait for an answer  
Yes Yes Will the silence be broken  
Yes Yes Should we wait for an answer  
Yes Yes Do we leave it unspoken  
  
Yes Yes Yes Yes
