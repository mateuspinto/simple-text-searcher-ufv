I told you about strawberry fields  
You know the place where nothing is real  
Well heres another place you can go  
Where everything flows  
  
Looking through the bentbacked tulips  
To see how the other half live  
Looking through a glass onion  
  
I told you about the walrus and me man  
You know were as close as can be man  
Well heres another clue for you all  
The walrus was Paul  
  
Standing on the cast iron shore yeah  
Lady Madonna trying to make ends meet yeah  
Looking through the glass onion  
  
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah  
Looking through the glass onion  
  
I told you about the fool on the hill  
I tell you man hes living there still  
Well heres another place you can be  
Listen to me  
  
Fixing a hole in the ocean  
Trying to make a dovetail joint yeah  
Looking through a glass onion
