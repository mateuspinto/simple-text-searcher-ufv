I reached out my arms and I touched you with soft words I whispered your name  
I had your love on the tip of my fingers but that was as close as I came  
My eyes held a vision of sweet lips yeelding beneath my command  
I had your love on the tips of my fingers but I let it slip right through my
hands  
  
But I let it slip right through my hands  
Somebody took you when I wasnt looking I shouldve known right from the start  
Its a long long way from the tip of my fingers to the love hidden deep in
your heart To the love hidden deep in your heart  
  
Somebody took you
