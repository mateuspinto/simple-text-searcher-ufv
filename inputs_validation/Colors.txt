English Translation  
While worrying about the illusion  
Reflected in the mirror  
Everything speeds up without notice  
When they say Im free to go wherever  
The guides for my incomplete desire  
All turn grey  
The swaying flames  
Are painting my dreams tonight  
The tip of your brush  
Isnt dried up yet  
If you cant see a blue sky open up your blue umbrella  
Isnt that great The canvas is yours  
A white flag is only raised when one has given up  
But now let it be crimson  
Like the beckoning matador  
Under the discoloring fluorescent light  
On the black and white of a chessboard  
We met by chance  
There was a time when wed lost our way and held each other close  
Its been a month since then Do you remember  
I would have been happy just to have watched  
The orange sunset next to you  
But the mouth words is the origin of catastrophe  
Black clothes are only worn when  
Praying for the deceased  
The mark of rouge leaves behind deep red purposely  
If you say you can only paint  
Dreamless pictures  
How many times must  
I paint over the canvas  
A white flag is only raised  
When youve given up  
Im a color you dont know now
