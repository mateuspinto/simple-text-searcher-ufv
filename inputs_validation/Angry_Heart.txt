I still remember how it used to be  
I thought the only thing  
That mattered was me  
You always told me it was just insane  
  
To feel such joy  
While others feel pain  
Theres no way to change this angry heart  
Cause when love goes  
  
It will tear you apart  
And its been this way since time began  
Its a desperate search for a promised land  
And the years slip by like so much sand  
  
So many people who are dying to live  
It tortures my heart  
Theyve got so much to give  
I never saw it as a battle before  
  
To win the fight  
There has to be more  
And theres no way to change this angry heart  
Cause all these fears  
  
Will tear you apart  
And its been this way since time began  
Its an endless journey its the fate of man  
To live each day and never understand  
  
And its been this way since time began  
Its a desperate search for a master plan  
And the years slip by like water through your hands
