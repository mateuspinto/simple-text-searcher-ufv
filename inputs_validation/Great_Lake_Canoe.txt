Paddlin down the michigan  
Catchin all the fish I can  
Breathin holy air in my canoe  
Groovin down superior  
Takin taboos easier  
Talkin with the lord in my canoe  
Send me no pillows I can dream on  
Ive seen all the nightmares I can bear to see  
Gotta find the river to your kingdom in my canoe  
Many moons on erie lake  
Not a bottle of beer to break  
Heaven knows I try best I can do  
Maybe lake ontario  
Gonna take me where I hope  
Got to find the lord in my canoe  
Paddlin down the michigan  
Catchin all the fish I can  
Breathin holy air in my canoe  
Send me no willows I can weep on  
Ive done all the crying I can bear to do  
Lookin for the tributary to your kingdom  
In my canoe
