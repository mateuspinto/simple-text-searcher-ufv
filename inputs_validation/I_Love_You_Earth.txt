I love you earth you are beautiful  
I love the way you are  
I know I never said it to you  
But I want to say it now  
I love you I love you I love you earth  
I love you I love you I love you now  
  
I love you earth you are beautiful  
I love the way you shine  
I love your valleys I love your mornings  
In fact I love you evry day  
I know I never said it to you  
Why Id never know  
Over blue mountains over green fields  
I want to scream about it now  
  
I love you I love you I love you earth  
I love you I love you I love you now  
  
You are our meeting point of infinity  
You are our turning point in eternity  
  
I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you earth  
I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you now  
I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you earth  
I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you now
