Oh baby mystic lady  
You do own my night  
Put my dogs to fright  
Yea yea yea yea yea  
Sliding riding sorceress  
In your dungarees  
Got me on my knees  
The people in your life are cruel  
Keep on riding that hard road  
The lovers in your life are few  
You keep on riding that hard road  
Baby baby baby  
Oh baby baby baby  
Pleasant crescent moon  
Fills my heart with pain  
Fills my toes with rain  
Oh bobby you got a hobby  
With the learned ones  
Like a setting sun  
The people in your life are cruel  
Keep on riding that hard road  
The lovers in your life are few  
You keep on riding that hard road  
Baby baby baby  
Oh baby baby baby
