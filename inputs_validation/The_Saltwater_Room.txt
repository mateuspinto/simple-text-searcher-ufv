I opened my eyes last night  
And saw you in the low light  
Walking down by the bay  
On the shore  
Staring up at the stars that arent there anymore  
I was feeling the night grow old  
And you were looking so cold  
So like an introvert  
I drew my over shirt  
Around my arms and began to shiver violently before  
You happened to look  
And see the tunnels all around me  
Running into the dark  
Underground  
All the subways around create a great sound  
To my motion fatigue  
Farewell  
With your ear to a seashell  
You can hear the waves in underwater caves  
As if you actually were inside a saltwater room  
  
Time together isnt never quite enough  
When you and I are alone Ive never felt so at home  
What will it take to make or break this hint of love  
Only time only time  
  
Can you believe that the crew has gone  
And wouldnt let me sign on  
All my islands have sunk  
In the deep  
And I can hardly relax or even oversleep  
But I feel more with your hand  
In mine  
When we walk on the shore line  
I guess well never know why sparrows love the snow  
Well turn off all of the lights and set this ballroom aglow  
  
So tell me darling do you wish wed fall in love  
Yeah all the time all the time  
Time together isnt never quite enough  
When you and I are alone Ive never felt so at home  
What will it take to make or break this hint of love  
Only time only time  
When were apart whatever are you thinking of  
If this is what I call home why does it feel so alone  
So tell me darling do you wish wed fall in love  
All the time all the time  
  
Time together isnt never quite enough  
When were apart whatever are you thinking of  
What will it take to make or break this hint of love  
So tell me darling do you wish wed fall in love  
All the time  
All the time
