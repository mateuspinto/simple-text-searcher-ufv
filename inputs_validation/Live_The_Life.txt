Preach the Gospel to all the world  
And if necessary use words St Francis of Assisi  
  
Were passengers aboard the train  
Silent little lambs amidst the pain  
Thats no longer good enough  
And when its time to speak our faith  
We use a language no one can explain  
Thats no longer good enough  
  
And God knows its a shame  
As we look to pass the flame  
We are not the worthy bearers of his name  
  
Chorus  
For the world to know the truth  
There can be no greater proof  
Than to live the life live the life  
Theres no love thats quite as pure  
Theres no pain we cant endure  
If we live the life live the life  
Be a light for all to see  
For every act of love will set you free  
  
Theres something beautiful and bold  
The power of a million human souls  
Come together as one  
And each in turn goes out to lead  
Another by his word his love his deed  
Now the circle is done  
  
It all comes back to One  
For it is He and He alone  
Who has lived the only perfect life weve known  
  
Chorus
