Verse 1  
In Britains Georgian times  
There were so many crimes  
No time to hang each crook guilty of a felony  
Cos theres no room to jail you  
Theyd send you to Australia  
To live in our newfangled penal colony  
Think that sounds like heaven  
In 1787 it wasnt that kind of once in a lifetime trip  
First fleet took the journey  
Months at sea so churny  
Over 40 died while they were on the ship  
  
Chorus  
Those that lived were plucky  
Plucky plucky plucky  
Crammed on board with rats and vermin cockroaches in bed  
Stench inside was sicky  
Yucky yucky icky  
Lice not very nice cant get them out of my head  
  
Verse 2  
Landed Bay of Botany  
Convicts life was rotteny  
Needed food and shelter but everything failed  
Threes too strong for felling  
Stagnant water smelling  
A real step back in time in New South Wales  
Soil too poor for budding  
Huts washed up by flooding  
Plans for building houses came to sticky ends  
The best of all their labours  
Attacked by local neighbours  
And that is when your neighbours dont become good friends  
  
Chorus  
Situation tricky  
Tricky tricky tricky  
Then a second fleet of ships was due aground  
Some thought this was lucky  
But illness had strucky  
Half were dead or Ill  
Fever was spinning around  
  
Verse 3  
After seven years  
Convict record clears  
Just one catch  
You got to pay your own way back  
No wages meant no money  
No choice but whats funny  
Many stayed became farmers and made a stack  
Original arrivers  
Proved hardy survivors  
Sydney turned into a place youd choose to go  
Think that theyd be fairer  
To convicts who were sent there  
No way they built prisons even more remote  
  
Verse 4  
Port Arthur was one of the jails  
Where every escape attempt fails  
Was one man who nearly got through  
Billy Hunt dressed as a kangaroo  
  
Chorus  
Inmates life still sucky  
Sucky sucky sucky  
Life behind bars was not very nice  
Hideous and messy  
Who would ever guessy  
This hellhole would become a  
Holiday paradise
