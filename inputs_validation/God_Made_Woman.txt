It never ceases to blow my mind  
It does it to me every time  
Standin here lookin at you  
It makes me wonder what He was up to  
Was He thinking about me when He thought about you  
  
Chorus  
When God made woman  
He mustve been proud  
Yeah he mustve been crying or laughing out loud  
It must have felt like the first time  
Gettin kissed by the sun  
When God made woman  
  
It must have been the most beautiful day  
Lookin down on all creation  
He took a river that winds and turns  
Took a fire that breathes and burns  
And put it all in place  
In the most perfect way  
  
Chorus x2  
  
God made woman
