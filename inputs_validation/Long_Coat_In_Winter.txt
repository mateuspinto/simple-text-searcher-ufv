Grow into me like a vine through a sidewalk  
Struggling to reach for the sky  
Grow into me like the veins on my forehead  
that stand out whenever I cry  
  
Oh I will wrap my arms around you like a long coat in winter  
Oh will you stay with me on thinning ice and trust me to lead  
Will you be everything I need  
  
Climb next to me up the trail up the mountain  
Even though times running out  
Night falls around theres no light in the distance  
Only my shadows of doubt  
  
Oh I will wrap my arms around you like a long coat in winter  
Oh will you stay with me on thinning ice and trust me to lead  
Will you be everything I need  
  
Will you be everything I need
