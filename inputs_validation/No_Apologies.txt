The general offered  
No apologies  
He said The soldiers erred in judgment  
They should have hired a hooker  
No apologies  
to the outraged Japanese  
No Sorry little girl  
The pigs just took her  
Tire skids and teethmarks  
What happened to this place  
Lawyers and loan sharks  
Are laying America to waste  
  
Freddie said that Juan thinks I think  
Hes the devil  
What a lofty title  
For such a petty little tyrant  
Bigger beasts abound  
And they kick this world around  
At this crazy speed  
With violence and greed  
Tire skids and teethmarks  
What happened to this place  
Lawyers and loan sharks  
Are laying America to waste  
  
So what makes a man a man  
In these tough times  
As drug lords buy up the banks  
And warlords radiate the oceans  
Ecosystems fail  
Snakes and snails and puppy tails  
Are wagging in the womb  
Beneath the trampled moon  
Tire skids and teethmarks  
What happened to this place  
Lawyers and loan sharks  
Are laying America to waste  
  
The general offered  
No apologies
