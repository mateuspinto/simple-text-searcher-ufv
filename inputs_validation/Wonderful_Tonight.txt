Stars hang suspended  
Above a floating yellow moon  
Two hearts were blended  
While angels sang a lovers tune  
  
And so we kissed  
Not knowing if our hearts could pay the price  
But heaven welcomed us to paradise  
Blessing our love  
  
Then came the sunrise  
Fading the moon and stars from sight  
Recalling always  
Our wonderland by night  
  
Stars hang suspended  
  
Above a floating yellow moon  
Two hearts were blended  
While angels sang a lovers tune  
  
And so we kissed  
Not knowing if our hearts could pay the price  
But heaven welcomed us to paradise  
Blessing our love  
  
Then came the sunrise  
Fading the moon and stars from sight  
Recalling always  
Our wonderland by night
