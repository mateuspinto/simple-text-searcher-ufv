Sweet in winter sweet in rain  
Shake well before use she said  
You never touch me anymore this way  
Connector in  
Receiver out  
You let me in through the back door  
Ride the sainted rhythms on the midnight train to romford  
Ride the sainted rhythms  
  
Sweet in winter sweet in rain  
Shake well before use she said  
You never touch me anymore this way  
  
Oh no  
  
Connector connector connector connector  
Youre a connector connector connector connector  
  
Im so dirty  
And the light blinds my eyes  
Youre oh so dirty  
And the light it blinds my eyes  
Here comes christ on crutches  
  
Call me wet trampoline she said today  
Well I was too busy with my hand  
Shake well before use she said  
But you never touch me anymore  
I was busy listening for phone sex  
Coming through the back door  
In skintight trunks  
And we all went mental and danced  
  
I get my kicks on channel six  
To the offpeak electricity  
And the light blinds my eyes  
And I feel dirty  
And the light blinds my eyes  
And I feel so shaken in my faith  
Here comes christ on crutches  
And here comes another god  
Here comes another god  
Like a buffalo thunder  
  
With a smell of sugar  
And a velvet tongue  
And designer voodoo  
And I got phone sex to see me through the emptiness in my 501s  
Freezedried with a new religion  
And my teeth stuffed back in my head  
  
I get my kicks on channel six  
I  
I get my kicks on channel six  
  
The light it burns my eyes  
And I feel so dirty feel so dirty  
Here comes christ on crutches christ on crutches  
  
I will not be confused  
Will not be confused  
They left me confused  
I will not be confusedwith another man  
This pressure of opinions  
Lighten up  
Listen to your eyes you said  
But all I could see was doris day  
In a big screen satellite  
Disappearing down the tube hole on farringdon street  
With whiplash willy the motor psycho  
  
And the light it burns my eyes  
And the light it burns my eyes  
Get my kicks on channel six  
I get my kicks on channel six
