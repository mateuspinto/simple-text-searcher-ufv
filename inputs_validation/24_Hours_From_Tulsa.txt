Dearest darlin I had to write to say  
That I wont be home anymore  
For somethin happened to me as I was driving home  
And Im not the same anymore  
  
Oh I was only 24 hours from Tulsa  
Oh only one day away from your arms  
And I saw a welcoming light  
And stopped to rest for the night  
  
And that is when I saw him as I pulled in outside  
Of the small motel he was there  
And so I walked up to him asked where I could get something  
To eat and he showed me where  
  
Oh I was only 24 hours from Tulsa  
Oh only one day away from your arms  
He took me to a cafe  
And he asked me if I would stay I said okay  
  
Oh I was only 24 hours from Tulsa  
Oh only one day away from your arms  
The jukebox started to play  
And nighttime turned into day  
  
As we were dancing closely all of a sudden  
I lost control as he held me tight  
And then he kissed me caressed me  
Told me hed die before he would let me out of his arms  
  
Oh I was only 24 hours from Tulsa  
Oh only one day away from your arms  
I hate to do this to you  
But I found somebody new what can I do  
  
And I can never never never go home again
