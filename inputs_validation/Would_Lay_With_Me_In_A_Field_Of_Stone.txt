Would you lay with me  
In a field of stone  
If my needs were strong  
Would you lay with me  
  
Should my lips grow dry  
Would you wet them dear  
In the midnight hour  
Should my lips grow dry  
  
Would you go away  
To another land  
Walk a thousand miles  
Through the burning sand  
  
Wipe the blood away  
From my dying hand  
If I give myself to you  
  
Will you bathe with me  
In the stream of life  
When the moon is full  
Will you bathe with me  
  
Will you love me now  
When Im down and out  
In my time of trial  
Will you stand by me  
  
Would you go away  
To another land  
Walk a thousand miles  
Through the burning sand  
  
Wipe the blood away  
From my dying hand  
If I give myself to you  
  
Would you lay with me  
In a field of stone  
If my needs were strong  
Would you lay with me
