Better bring another bottle with you baby  
If you really want to party then lets make it swing  
Right into the morning  
Better bring another bottle with you baby  
Cause I really want to make this little bell ring  
Ding dong ding  
  
I feel cold and I want to get you by my side  
I feel bold and I want to show you how this man can ride  
Better bring another bottle with you baby  
If you really want to party then lets make it swing  
Right into the morning  
  
Better bring another bottle with you baby  
Cause I really want to make this little bell ring  
Ding dong ding  
  
I feel smooth and I really want to live it up  
If we groove then I promise you that we wont even stop  
Better bring another bottle with you baby  
I get the feeling that you want to take off and fly  
High high well if my ceiling isnt high enough  
Well burn up the sky  
  
I feel smooth and I really want to live it up

Better bring another bottle with you baby  
I get the feeling that you want to take off and fly  
High high well if my ceiling isnt high enough  
Well burn up the sky  
  
Better bring another bottle with you baby  
Better try to bring another bottle now  
Better bring another bottle baby  
Better bring another bottle with you now
