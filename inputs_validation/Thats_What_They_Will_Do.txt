Chorus  
Thats what your friends will do  
Thats what they will do  
  
They will come with great pretense  
To gain your confidence  
Theyll take you round the bend  
And fry you in the end  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
They will look right inna you eyes  
And tell you the wickedest lies  
Make you promises  
But never accomplishes  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
They will dress up inna you clothes  
  
And punch you inna you nose  
Dress up inna you shoes  
And still carry false news  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
They will know that you in jail  
And never try to get you bail  
And know that you in trouble  
And try to make it double  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
They will steal you only goat  
And then them cutting throat  
If you ever robbed  
Woulda come back for you car
