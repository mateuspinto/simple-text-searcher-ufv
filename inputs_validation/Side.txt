Well I believe theres something watching over you  
Theyre watching every single thing you say  
And when you die theyll set you down and take you through  
Youll realize one day  
  
That the grass is always greener on the other side  
The neighbors got a new car that you want to drive  
And when time is running out you want to stay alive  
  
We all live under the same sky  
We all will live we all will die  
There is no wrong  
There is no right  
The circle only has one side  
  
We all try hard to live our lives in harmony  
For fear of falling swiftly overboard  
But life is both a major and minor key  
Just open up the chord  
  
But the grass is always greener on the other side  
The neighbours got a new car that you want to drive  
And when time is running out you want to stay alive  
  
We all live under the same sky  
We all will live  
We all will die  
There is no wrong  
There is no right  
The circle only has one side
