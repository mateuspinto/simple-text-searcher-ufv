Without truth  
We lose  
Yet we want to spare the feelings of those we love  
Dont cry  
Weve all lied  
But there is always room for forgiveness my friend  
  
Chorus  
So dont treat me bad just be glad I am strong  
I know where I belong  
And soon you will see we are blessed and complete  
Theres a place here for you with me  
  
Shine  
Youre fine  
See I will always have a smile for you my love  
And still  
We will  
Be ok and along the way well learn a thing or two  
  
Chorus x7
