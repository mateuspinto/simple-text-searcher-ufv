Kool Keith  
Well Im first to rock Moe Luvs the disc jock  
By my side and wit the mix  
Clyde scratches mathces all cuts combine  
The faster master more quicker than the grand  
Peep his hand going back and forth  
North wit the fader smooth  
Peeking this watch where the needle can groove  
And move and lose it trying to bite  
His fingers are  as I ride the skills  
Of a champ the vamp blow watts in the amp  
And stamp your brain as I ride and glide and hide  
Moe Luv is on the mix tonight Moe Luv  
  
Ok now Moe is on the mixer  
So get ready cuz heres another twister  
About the way he gets the crowd to move  
And groove and dance to the things he do  
And prove the way he sway and lift and shape  
And rock hard all night hes on and on  
Swiftly slicing cuts are nice and smooth like rice and  
Beans another cut rises  
Moe surprises more than one  
2 3 4 5 the jam packed crowd  
Of biters and writers  
Accumulating reciters observing  
Cuts from the master as I move faster  
Pass the wack DJs  
Going on flowing on smooth and sailing on  
Moe Luv is on the mix tonight Moe Luv
