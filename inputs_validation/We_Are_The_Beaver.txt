The US is the eagle Russia is the bear  
Australia is the kangaroo cause theyre kind of weird down there  
Yeah India is the tiger that stands so proud and tall  
But Canada is the greatest of them all  
  
We are the beaver were furry and were free  
Yeah we are the beaver we got two big front teeth  
Yeah we are the beaver we can chew right through small trees  
We are the beaver we are the beaver we are the beaver  
  
You might think a rodent is a pretty lame choice  
For a national animal but dont you listen to that voice  
No cause all them birds and predators just take from the land  
But the beaver always gives a dam  
  
We are the beaver we got cute little webbed feet  
Yeah we are the beaver its bark we like to eat  
Yeah we are the beaver a nickel we complete  
Yeah we are the beaver we are the beaver we are the beaver  
  
The eagle flies the sky above and swoops down on its prey  
The big bear will maul anyone who dares gets in its way  
The tiger is the greatest of the hunters today  
But the beaver it can build dams Yeah  
The beaver it can build dams dams dams  
  
We are the beaver we slap our tails when dangers nearby  
We are the beaver we got waterproof hides  
Yeah we are the beaver we got big bums and beady eyes  
We are the beaver we are the beaver we are the beaver  
  
We are the beaver our name is often used as a double entedre  
We are the beaver cause in Canada both French and English belong  
Yeah we are the beaver and the subject of this song is  
We are the beaver we are the beaver we are the beaver  
I cant hear you  
We are the beaver we are the beaver we are the beaver  
Are you getting the point  
We are the beaver we are the beaver  
We are the beaver
