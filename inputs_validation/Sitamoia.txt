Hey mister can i shine your shoes  
Hey mister can i sing the blues  
Hey mister do you think its gonna snow  
Hey mister my heart belongs to glasgow  
  
Hey mister can i ask a question or two  
Hey mister what are we supposed to do  
  
Children abandoned and left to america  
Children forsaken in ethiopia  
Hey mister so you think its gonna snow  
What about the children though
