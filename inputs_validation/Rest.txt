Hey can you hear me  
Im calling your name  
Hello or is this goodbye  
The gleam in your eyes  
It troubles my brain  
Will I see it again  
So I can rest my head  
  
Angel angel Dancing away  
As all of my thoughts get rearranged  
Angel angel Turning away  
Just when thing seem  
To have changed  
So I can rest my head  
  
Hey can you hear me  
Im calling your name  
Hello or is this goodbye  
The gleam in your eyes  
It troubles my brain  
Will I see it again  
So I can rest my head
