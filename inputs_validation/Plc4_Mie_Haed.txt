I want to be in another place  
I hate when you say you dont understand  
I want to be in the energy right with the enemy a place for my head  
  
I watch how the moon sits in the sky on a dark night  
Shining with the light from the sun  
The sun doesnt give light to the moon  
Assuming the moons gonna owe it one  
And makes think of how you act to me you do favors that rapidly  
You just turn around and start asking me about things you want back from me  
Im sick of the tension sick of the hunger  
Sick of you acting like I owe you this  
Find another place to feed your greed  
While I find a place to rest Im sick of the tension sick of the hunger  
Sick of you acting like I owe you this find another place to feed your greed  
While I find a place to rest  
  
I want to be in another place I hate when you say you dont understand  
I want to be in the energy right with the enemy a place for my head  
I want to I want to I want to I want to  
  
Two Two Three Three Ya Ya Ya  
Gimme energon to keep me calm  
You and your mom keep on the drom  
Used to be a team passed that baton  
But you flop that bod as you drop that bomb  
Take it to the john in your babylon  
Flushed down with the sound that you carry on  
I dont really give a dang you pissed on my lawn  
Took a dump like a punk now the battles on  
  
So sick of you stressin  
Sick of you fessin  
Sick of you actin like I owe you some  
Find another place to feed your face  
If you dont we gonna bump get it up get crunk  
  
Sick of you stressin

I want to be in another place I hate when you say you dont understand  
I want to be in the energy right with the enemy a place for my head  
You try to get the best of me go away go away go away  
you try to take the best of me go away repeat to end
