I know that hearts were loving  
Long before I was here  
And Im not the first to ever cry  
In my bed or in my beer  
There were songs before there was radio  
Of love that stays  
And love that goes  
They were writing melancholy tunes  
And tearful words that rhyme  
  
Chorus  
Before my time  
Before my time  
  
There were songs in old dusty books  
Of love thats always been  
Sweet lovers in their glory  
Who are now gone with the wind  
Old fashioned love words spoken  
Then keep coming back around again  
Nothings changed except the name  
Their love burned just like mine  
  
Chorus  
  
And in the dim of yesterday  
I can clearly see  
That flesh and blood  
Cried out to someone  
As it does in me  
And there was some old song that said  
I love you til I die  
  
Chorus  
  
But what the old time masters had  
Is what I feel for you  
Love is love and doesnt change  
In a century or two  
If someway they had seen and knew  
How it would be for me and you  
Theyd wish for love like yours  
And they would wish for love like mine  
  
Chorus
