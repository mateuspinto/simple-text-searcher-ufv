Dee Money Verse 1  
I relate to niggaz and they relate to me  
Real niggas do real things thats how it supposed to be  
Cut from the same clothes make the same shirt  
Probably had the same glock and got the same worth  
Ill whack ya ass and skip to da NO  
And lay low in the projects with my kinfolk  
AK47 with the shoulder strap Set it off had it sounded  
Like the Nolia clap Got 2 strikes nigga dodgin the  
POPOs This real life leave ya brains in da thresh hole  
I a street nigga mayne pimpin aint easy leave da block

Its my style They jockin my slang  
Im a real street nigga  
We aint the same nigga Im grown nigga  
So play wit your own kids Im a street nigga  
I was born in da streetz kid One white girl left  
Save the last dance My partner said you want it  
Well this your last chance Funny how a Murder can get you 50 years

Judge gettin mo money then a stripper dawg  
Play the game how it go nigga running niggsz quicker then a  
Kitchen sink dirty south nigga on my way 2 da bank
