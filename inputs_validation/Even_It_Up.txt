Im the one who can please you  
Aint that what you said  
You seemed so alone  
I guess I was easily led  
  
I showed you my love  
But I guess that it went to your head  
When you were hungry  
I brought you your breakfast in bed  
  
Even it up even it up even it up  
Even it up even it up even it up  
A good man pays his debt  
But you aint paid yours yet  
Even it  
Even it up  
  
I took you down over the tracks when  
You wanted some sin  
I brought you satin and herbs from  
The places I been  
Now something tells me youre  
Going to use me again  
You think you can lay down the how and  
The where and the when  
  
Even it up even it up even it up  
Even it up even it up even it up  
I dont want to bum it all  
But this ax she got to fall  
Even it  
Even it up
