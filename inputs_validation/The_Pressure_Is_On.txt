I got someone at home dont know whats going on  
  
Thinks I love her and her alone and the pressure is on  
  
Ive got a new love you see she does new minds to me  
  
We sneak our love yous on the phone and the pressure is on  
  
And it puts pressure on a man if he ever lets his heart call his hand  
  
He aint no rolling stone but the pressure is on  
  
 fiddle  organ   
  
Feel like your ten thousand feet down under the sea  
  
And its crushing all your bones and the pressure is on  
  
The trains I ride in my dreams run on the pressure of the steam  
  
Lord I could pull one a mile long cause the pressure is on  
  
Lord I could pull one a mile long cause the pressure is on  
  
The pressure is on the pressure at home
