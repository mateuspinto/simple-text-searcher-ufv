The door it opened slowly  
My father he came in  
I was nine years old  
And he stood so tall above me  
His blue eyes they were shining  
And his voice was very cold  
He said Ive had a vision  
And you know Im strong and holy  
I must do what Ive been told  
So he started up the mountain  
I was running he was walking  
And his axe was made of gold  
  
Well the trees they got much smaller  
The lake a ladys mirror  
We stopped to drink some wine  
Then he threw the bottle over  
Broke a minute later  
And he put his hand on mine  
Thought I saw an eagle  
But it might have been a vulture  
I never could decide  
Then my father built an altar  
He looked once behind his shoulder  
He knew I would not hide  
  
You who build these altars now  
To sacrifice these children  
You must not do it anymore  
A scheme is not a vision  
And you never have been tempted  
By a demon or a god  
You who stand above them now  
Your hatchets blunt and bloody  
You were not there before  
When I lay upon a mountain  
And my fathers hand was trembling  
With the beauty of the word  
  
And if you call me brother now  
Forgive me if I inquire  
just according to whose plan  
When it all comes down to dust  
I will kill you if I must  
I will help you if I can  
When it all comes down to dust  
I will help you if I must  
I will kill you if I can  
And mercy on our uniform  
Man of peace or man of war  
The peacock spreads his fan
