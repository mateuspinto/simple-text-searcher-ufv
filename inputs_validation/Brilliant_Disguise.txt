Bruce Springsteen  
  
I hold you in my arms  
Theres a band playing  
What are those words whispered baby  
Just as you turn away  
  
Well I saw you last night  
Out on the edge of town  
I wanna read your mind and know just what I got in this  
New thing I found  
  
So tell me what I see  
When I look into your eyes  
Is that you baby  
Or just a brilliant disguise  
  
I heard someone call your name  
Underneath my willow  
I saw something tucked in shame  
Underneath your pillow  
  
Well I tried so hard baby  
But I just cant see  
What a woman like you  
Is doing with me  
  
So tell me who I see  
When I look into your eyes  
Is that you baby  
Or just a brilliant disguise  
  
Now look at me baby  
Struggling to do everything right  
And then it all falls apart  
When out go the lights  
  
Im just a lonely pilgrim  
I walk this world in wealth  
I wanna know its you I dont trust  
Cause I damn sure dont trust myself  
  
Now you play the lovin woman  
I play the faithful man  
Just dont look too close  
Into the palm of my hand  
  
When we stood at the altar  
The gypsy swore our future looked right  
But in the wee wee hours maybe baby  
The gypsy lied  
  
So when you look at me  
You better look hard and look twice  
Is that me baby  
Or just a brilliant disguise  
  
Tonight our bed is cold  
Im lost in the darkness of our love  
God have mercy on a man  
Who doubts what hes sure of
