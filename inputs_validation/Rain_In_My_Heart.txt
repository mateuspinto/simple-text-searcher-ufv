If I have to cry if I have to kill  
If I have to die oh baby I will  
As long you stay baby by my side  
If I have to beg if I have to steal  
If I have to swim through oceans I will  
As long you stay baby by my side  
I miss you forever forever my love  
  
Oh baby why does it always rain in my heart  
My sweet baby  
Oh my lady I cant live without you oh no  
Oh baby why does it always rain in my heart  
Tell me baby  
Oh my lady Im lonely and Im blue  
  
If I have to climb on the greatest hill  
If I have to fall oh baby I will  
As long you stay baby by my side  
If I have to lose everything just for you  
If I have to fight oh baby Ill do  
As long you stay baby by my side  
I love you forever forever my love
