Hey hey pretty baby  
Baby you sure is fine  
Hey hey pretty baby  
Baby you sure is fine  
Every time I look at you  
You drive me out of my mind  
  
She got big blue eyes  
Want her here by my side  
She got big blues eyes  
Want her here by my side  
Hey hey pretty baby  
Let me be your little guide  
  
She got ruby lips  
Boy she sure got pretty hips  
She got ruby lips  
Boy she sure got pretty hips  
And when she walks down the street  
All the cats go flippity flip  
  
She got big blue eyes  
Want her here by my side  
She got big blues eyes  
Want her here by my side  
Hey hey pretty baby  
Let me be your little guide  
  
Hey hey pretty baby  
Baby you sure is fine  
Hey hey pretty baby  
Baby you sure is fine  
Every time I look at you  
You drive me out of my mind  
  
Hey hey pretty baby  
Baby you sure is fine  
Hey hey pretty baby
