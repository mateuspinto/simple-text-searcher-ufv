The words played on around our heads  
Perhaps we went too far  
Well soldier on until the end again  
  
This clutching hand around my hand  
So pitiful and frail  
Makes bleeding hearts begin to beat again  
  
We stand in a different light  
Thats cast upon this gigolo and gigolette  
We stand with a different frame around us now  
But when we talk we talk in time  
We shine with profiles so strong and so clear  
And when we move we move in time  
Wont fade like pictures that come back again  
  
Your propaganda touched my soul  
Those thin and cherished words  
A willing victim for the kill again  
  
We stand in a different light  
Thats cast upon this gigolo and gigolette  
We stand with a different frame around us now  
But when we talk we talk in time  
We shine with profiles so strong and so clear  
And when we move we move in time  
Wont fade like pictures that come back again  
  
We stand in a different light  
Thats cast upon this gigolo and gigolette  
We stand with a different frame around us now  
But when we talk we talk in time  
We shine with profiles so strong and so clear  
And when we move we move in time  
Wont fade like pictures that come back again
