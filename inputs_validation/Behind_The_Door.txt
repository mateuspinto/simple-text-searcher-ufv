Behind the door of every house  
In every street in every town  
A story is unfolding  
A story is unfolding of love and hate  
The most of us wait of hopes and fears  
Of smiles and tears of dreams  
That lies a moldering  
  
Behind the door of every house  
In every street in every town  
The stage is set for playing  
The stage is set for playing  
And I call crime and punch your mime  
Sweet romance a rich will dance  
Characters are playing  
  
Behind the door of every house  
In every street in every town  
The people are a waiting  
The people are a waiting  
To bare and die the years go by  
The wedding spree the cruelty  
And still they go on mating  
  
And to the one the only one  
Remember when the need of man  
Is greater again  
The prayers take off ascending  
All filled of love to the one above  
Asking for asking for asking for asking for  
A happy ending a happy ending a happy ending
