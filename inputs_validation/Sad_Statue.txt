Conquest to the lover and your love to the fire  
Romances evolving in the absolute  
Forgiveness is the  
The ultimate sacrifice  
Eloquence belongs  
To the conqueror  
Two picture of time and space are rearranged  
In this little piece of typical tragedy  
  
Justified Candy  
Brandy for the nerves  
Eloquence belongs  
To the conqueror  
  
You and me will all go down in history  
With a sad Statue of Liberty  
And a Generation that didnt agree  
  
You and me will all go down in history  
With a sad Statue of Liberty  
And a Generation that didnt agree  
  
I forgot to let  
I forgot to let you know that  
Justified Candy  
Brandy for the nerves  
Eloquence belongs  
To the conqueror  
  
Conquest to the lover  
And your love to the fire  
Romances evolving in the absolute  
  
Forgiveness is thee  
The ultimate sacrifice  
Eloquence belongs  
To the conqueror  
  
You and me will all go down in history  
With a sad Statue of Liberty  
And a Generation that didnt agree  
  
You and me will all go down in history  
With a sad Statue of Liberty  
And a Generation that didnt agree  
  
Generation  
What is in us that turns a deaf ear to the cries of human suffering  
WHOA  
SUFFERING NOW  
  
You and me will all go down in history  
With a sad Statue of Liberty  
And a Generation that didnt agree  
  
You and me will all go down in history  
With a sad Statue of Liberty  
And a Generation that didnt agree
