Am I to believe  
That a God would give his son  
Am I to believe  
That the world was brought with love  
Am I to believe  
That a stranger died for me  
Am I to believe  
That a saviour set me free  
  
cause I have felt the could rain  
Run down my face  
Ive seen the sun rise up  
As the night turns to day  
Ive heard the laughter  
As the children play  
But above all  
I juat live to say that  
  
Yeah oh yeah  
I believe in the God love  
Yeah oh yeah  
I believe in the risen son  
  
Am I to believe  
That the sick shall overcome  
Am I to believe  
That my freedom has been won  
  
I blieve in you
