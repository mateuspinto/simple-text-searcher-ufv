Verse 1  
My funny valentine  
Sweet comic valentine  
You make me smile with my heart  
Your looks are laughable  
Unphotographable  
Yet your my favourite work of art  
  
Bridge  
Is your figure less than Greek  
Is your mouth a little weak  
When you open it to speak  
Are you smart  
  
Chorus  
But dont change your hair for me  
Not if you care for me  
Stay little valentine stay  
Each day is valentines day
