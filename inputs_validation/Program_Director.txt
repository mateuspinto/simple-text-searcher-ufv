Program director on the radio wont play my record until the caller tell him
so  
Program director on the radio wont play no music until the caller tell him so  
  
This one time I flip call the radio  
Man play the record that I been loving so  
I sing with the singer  
Dance to the flow  
I hear my request coming out the stereo  
At one time there was a rhythm on my stereo  
Pick up the phone line  
Send my jam down the radio  
  
Program director on the radio wont play my record until the caller tell him
so  
Program director on the radio wont play no music until the caller tell him so  
  
So call up call up I wanna hear the performance  
Catch a wave on the air today  
Call up call up bring a rhythm and a chorus  
I want to hear it on the air today  
  
One time on the stereo  
You could move to a past time from the radio  
A rhythm I could groove to  
  
Program director on the radio wont play my record until the caller tell him
so  
Program director on the radio wont play no music until the caller tell him so  
  
So call up call up I wanna hear the performance  
Catch a wave on the air today  
Call up call up bring a rhythm and a chorus  
I want to hear it on the air today  
  
It takes me home  
Take me home  
I listen to the music the music will take me home  
  
Shake the floor move the room with the bass line  
Pay my respect to drummy as he keep time  
Crank the volume now the song is all mine  
Come sound system make the rhythm climb  
  
Program director on the radio wont play my record until the caller tell him
so  
Program director on the radio wont play no music until the caller tell him so
