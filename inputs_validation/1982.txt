Operator please connect me with 1982  
I need to make apologies for what I didnt do  
I sure do need to tell her that Ive thought the whole thing through  
And now its clear that she is what I should have held on to  
  
Chorus  
They say hindsights twentytwenty  
But Im nearly goin blind  
From starin at her photograph and wishing she was mine  
Its that same ole lost love story  
Its sad but its true  
There was a time when she was mine in 1982  
  
Postman can you sell me a special kind of stamp  
One to send a letter from this crazy lonely man  
Back into the wasted years of my living past  
I need to tell her now I know how long my love will last  
  
Chorus  
  
Losin my mind goin back in time to 1982
