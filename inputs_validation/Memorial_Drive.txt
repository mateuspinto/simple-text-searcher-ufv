Cellar full of diamonds turret full of gold  
All for a mermaids locket too much to hold  
Drink the seals blood from the ocean  
Drink the whole ocean dry  
Steal the moonshine from the nighttime  
Steal the sun from the sky  
  
Blackskinned warrior Zulu Queen  
Sold for a silver dollar shipped across the sea  
Worked like a Mexican donkey  
Used like a hole in the ground  
Branded her skin like she didnt feel a thing  
Crying without a sound
