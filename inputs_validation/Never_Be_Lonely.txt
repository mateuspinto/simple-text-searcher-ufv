Got you by my side  
Ill never be lonely  
Got you by my side  
Ill never be afraid  
Never be lonely anymore  
Turn away the fools from my door  
Always want to be your one and only  
Never be lonely  
  
Spent a lot of time  
Waitin to find you  
Spent a lot of time  
All on my own  
Couldve gone a thousand different ways  
Watching my nights turn to days  
Always want to be your one and only  
Never be lonely  
  
Here in the middle of now or never  
Finally found where I belong  
I could go on like this forever  
Looking at you looking at you  
  
Wasnt I the one  
Love never came to  
Wasnt I the one  
So misunderstood  
All because my heart wasnt sure  
Never felt a love like this before  
Always want to be your one and only  
Never be lonely  
  
Here in the middle of now or never  
Finally found where I belong  
I could go on like this forever  
Looking at you looking at you  
  
Got me by your side  
Never be lonely  
Got me by your side  
Never be afraid  
And I will not let you down  
Keeping both feet on the ground  
Always want to be your one and only  
Never be lonely  
  
Never be lonely  
Never be lonely  
Never be lonely  
Never be lonely  
Never be lonely
