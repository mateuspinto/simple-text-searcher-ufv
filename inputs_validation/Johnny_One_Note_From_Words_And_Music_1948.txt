Johnny could only sing one note  
And the note he sang was this  
Ahh  
  
Poor Johnny one note sang out with gusto  
And just overlorded the place  
Poor Johnny one note yelled willy nilly  
Until he was blue in the face  
For holding one note was his ace  
  
Couldnt hear the brass  
Couldnt hear the drum  
He was in a class by himself by gum  
  
Poor Johnny one note got in Aida  
Indeed a great chance to be brave  
He took his one note howled like the north wind  
Brought forth wind that made critics rave  
While Verdi turned round in his grave  
  
Couldnt hear the flute  
Or the big trombone  
Every one was mute Johnny stood alone  
  
Cats and dogs stopped yapping  
Lions in the zoo all were jealous of Johnnys big trill  
Thunder claps stopped clapping  
Traffic ceased its roar and they tell us Niagara stood still  
  
He stopped the train whistles boat whistles  
Steam whistles cop whistles  
All whistles bowed to his skill  
Ahh  
  
Sing Johnny one note sing out with gusto  
And just overlord all the crowd  
So sing Johnny one note out loud  
Sing Johnny one note  
Sing Johnny one note out loud
