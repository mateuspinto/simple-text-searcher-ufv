I have seen where the wolf has slept by the silver stream  
I can tell by the mark he left you were in his dream  
Ah child of countless trees ah child of boundless seas  
  
What you are and what youre meant to be  
Speaks his name though you were born to me  
Born to me Cassidy  
  
Lost now on the country miles in his Cadillac  
I can tell by the way you smile he is rolling back  
Come wash the nighttime clean come grow the scorched ground green  
  
Blow the horn and tap the tambourine  
Close the gap of the dark years in between  
You and me Cassidy  
  
Quick beats in an icy heart catch colt draws a coffin cart  
There he goes and now here she starts hear her cry  
  
Flight of the seabirds  
Scattered like lost words  
Wield to the storm and fly  
Fare thee well now let your life proceed by its own design  
Nothing to tell now let the words be yours Im done with mine  
Fare thee well now let your life proceed by its own design  
Nothing to tell now let the words be yours Im done with mine
