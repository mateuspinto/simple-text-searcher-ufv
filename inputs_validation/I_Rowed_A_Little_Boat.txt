You know I rowed a little boat  
Five miles cross the pond  
You know I rowed a little boat  
bout five miles cross the pond  
I throwed my things in the little boat  
It rolled me right along  
  
  
It was thunderin and lightenin  
But it rolled me right along  
It was thunderin it was lightenin  
Oh yeah it rolled me right along  
There were thousands of people  
They didnt have no place to go mmm  
  
  
Little children they were screamin  
And cryin Oh yeah  
The wind was howlin  
They didnt have no place to go mmm  
There were thousands o people  
Theys goin from door to door mmm  
  
  
My little boat kept rollin  
It kept on rollin  
You know it rolled me right along  
Mmmmmm Kept on rollin  
Kept on rollin Kept on rollin  
Kept on rollin Rollin
