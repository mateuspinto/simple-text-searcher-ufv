Howling winds keep screaming round  
And the rain comes pouring down  
Doors are locked and bolted now  
As the thing crawls into town  
  
Straight out of hell  
One of a kind  
Stalking his victim  
Dont look behind you  
  
Nightcrawler  
Beware the beast in black  
Nightcrawler  
You know hes coming back  
Night Crawler  
  
Sanctuary is being sought  
Whispered prayers a last resort  
Homing in its cry distorts  
Terror struck they know theyre caught  
  
Straight out of hell  
One of a kind  
Stalking his victim  
Dont look behind you  
  
Nightcrawler  
Beware the beast in black  
Nightcrawler  
You know hes coming back  
Night Crawler  
  
As night is falling  
The end is drawing near  
Theyll hear  
Their last rites echo on the wind  
  
Huddled in the cellar  
Fear caught in their eyes  
Daring not to move or breathe  
As the creature cries  
Fingernails start scratching  
On the outside wall  
Clawing at the windows  
Come to me it calls  
Atmospheres electric  
As it now descend the stairs  
  
Hiding in the darkness  
Is so futile from its glare  
Death comes in an instant  
As they hoped it would  
Souls ascend to heaven  
While it feasts on flesh and blood
