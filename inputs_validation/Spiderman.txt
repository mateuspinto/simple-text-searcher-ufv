Spiderman Spiderman does whatever a spider can  
Spins a web any size catches thieves just like flies  
Look out here comes the Spiderman  
  
Is he strong Listen bud hes got radioactive blood  
Can he swing from a thread Take a look overhead  
Hey there There goes the Spiderman  
  
In the chill of the night At the scene of a crime  
Like a streak of light he arrives just in time  
  
Spiderman Spiderman friendly neighborhood Spiderman  
Wealth and fame he ignores action is his reward  
Look out here comes the Spiderman  
  
Spiderman Spiderman friendly neighborhood Spiderman  
Wealth and fame he ignores action is his reward  
To him lifes a great big bang up whenever theres a hang up  
Youll find the Spiderman
