Verse 1  
Bitterness and burden  
Curses rest on thee  
Solitaire and sorrow  
All eternity  
Save the Earth and claim perfection  
Deem the mass and blame rejection  
Hold the pose fein perception  
Grudges break your back  
  
PreChorus  
All you bear  
All you carry  
All you bear  
Place it right on  
Right on me  
  
Chorus  
Die as you suffer in vain  
Own all the grief and the pain  
Die as you hold up the skies  
Atlas rise  
How does it feel on your own  
Bound by the world all alone  
Crushed under heavy skies  
Atlas rise  
  
Verse 2  
Crucify and witness  
Circling the sun  
Bastardized in ruin  
What have you become  
Blame the world and blame your maker  
Wish em to the undertaker  
Crown yourself the other savior  
So you carry on  
  
PreChorus  
All you bear  
All you carry  
All you bear  
Place it right on  
Right on me  
  
Chorus  
Die as you suffer in vain  
Own all the grief and the pain  
Die as you hold up the skies  
Atlas rise  
How does it feel on your own  
Bound by the world all alone  
Crushed under heavy skies  
Crushed under heavy skies  
Atlas rise

Verse 3  
Masquerade as maker  
Heavy is the crown  
Beaten down and broken  
Drama wears you down  
Overload the martyr stumbles  
Hit the ground and Heaven crumbles  
All alone the fear shall humble  
Swallow all your pride  
  
PreChorus  
All you bear  
All you carry  
All you bear  
Place it right on  
Right on me  
  
Chorus  
Die as you suffer in vain  
Own all the grief and the pain  
Die as you hold up the skies  
Atlas rise  
How does it feel on your own  
Bound by the world all alone  
Crushed under heavy skies  
Crushed under heavy skies  
Atlas rise
