Chorus  
  
Sometimes Alleluia  
Sometimes Praise The Lord  
Sometimes Gently Singing  
Our Hearts In One Accord  
  
Oh let us lift our voices  
Look toward the sky and start to sing  
Oh let us now return His love  
Just let our voices ring  
Oh let us feel His presence  
Let the sound of praises fill the air  
Oh let us sing the song of Jesus love  
To people everywhere  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh let our joy be unconfined  
Let us sing with freedom unrestrained  
Lets take this feeling that were feeling now  
Outside these walls and let it rain  
Oh let the Spirit overflow  
As we are filled from head to toe  
We love you Father Son and Holy Ghost  
And we want this world to know  
  
Chorus
