Verse 1  
Oh Oh Oh Oh  
All of the nations of the earth now rejoice  
All of the people of God sing his praise  
Everything that hath breath shout for joy  
Everything that is beautiful  
Belongs to you  
  
PreChorus  
All the earth is the Lords  
Everything is yours  
Everything is yours  
You are excellent

How excellent is your name  
How excellent is your name  
How excellent is your name  
All of the earth say

All the earth is yours  
Everything is yours  
You have created  
All things and made it good

All the earth is yours  
Everything is yours
