Talk about love  
How it makes life complete  
You can talk all you want  
Make it sound good and sweet  
But the words have an empty ring  
And they dont really mean a thing  
Without love you are not to be found  
You are not to be found  
  
Chorus  
For love is surrender  
You must surrender if you care  
You must surrender if you dare  
  
Shout about love  
Then the wars will all end  
You can shout were all brothers  
And even pretend  
But you cant cover up the past  
Just pretending will never last  
Without love you are nothing at all  
You are nothing at all huh  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Dare
