Opportunities are available in all walks of life in Australia  
So if youre young and if youre healthy  
Why not get a boat and come to Australia  
  
Australia the chance of a lifetime  
Australia you get what you work for  
Nobody has to be any better than what they want to be  
Australia no class distinction  
Australia no drug addiction  
Nobodys got a chip on their shoulder  
Well surf like they do in the USA  
Well fly down to Sydney for our holiday  
On sunny Christmas Day  
Australia Australia  
No one hesitates at life or beats around the bush in Australia  
So if youre young and if youre healthy  
Why not get a boat and come to Australia

Everyone walks around with a perpetual smile across their face  
Australia shalalala shalalala

Everyone gets around and nobody can ever get you down  
Well surf like they do in the USA  
Well fly down to Sydney for our holiday  
On sunny Christmas Day
