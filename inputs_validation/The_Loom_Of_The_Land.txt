It was the dirty end of winter  
Along the loom of the land  
When I walked with sweet sally  
Hand upon hand  
  
And the wind it bit bitter  
For a boy of no means  
With no shoes on his feet  
And a knife in his jeans  
  
Along the loom of the land  
The mission bells peeled  
From the tower at saint marys  
Down to reprobate fields  
  
And I saw that the world  
Was all blessed and bright  
And sally breathed softly  
In the majestic night  
  
O baby please dont cry  
And try to keep  
Your little hand upon my shoulder  
Now go to sleep  
  
The elms and the poplars  
Were turning their backs  
Past the rumbling station  
We followed the tracks  
  
We found an untrodden path  
And followed it down  
The moon in the sky  
Like a dislodged crown  
  
My hands they burned  
In the folds of her coat  
Breathing milky white air  
From deep in her throat  
  
O baby please dont cry  
And try to keep  
Your little head upon my shoulder  
Now go to sleep  
  
I told sally in whispers  
Ill never bring you harm  
Her breast it was small  
And warm in my palm  
  
I told her the moon  
Was a magical thing  
That it shone gold in winter  
And silver in spring  
  
And we walked and walked  
Across the endless sands  
Just me and my sally  
Along the loom of the land  
  
O baby please dont cry  
And try to keep  
Your little head upon my shoulder  
Now go to sleep
