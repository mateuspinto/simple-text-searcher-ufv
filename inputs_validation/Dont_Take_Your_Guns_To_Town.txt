A young cowboy named Billy Joe grew restless on the farm  
A boy filled with wonderlust who really meant no harm  
He changed his clothes and shined his boots  
And combed his dark hair down  
And his mother cried as he walked out  
  
Dont take your guns to town son  
Leave your guns at home Bill  
Dont take your guns to town  
  
He laughed and kissed his mom  
And said your Billy Joes a man  
I can shoot as quick and straight as anybody can  
But I wouldnt shoot without a cause  
Id gun nobody down  
But she cried again as he rode away  
  
Dont take your guns to town son  
Leave your guns at home Bill  
Dont take your guns to town  
  
He sang a song as on he rode  
His guns hung at his hips  
He rode into a cattle town  
A smile upon his lips  
He stopped and walked into a bar  
And laid his money down  
But his mothers words echoed again  
  
Dont take your guns to town son  
Leave your guns at home Bill  
Dont take your guns to town  
  
He drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hand  
And tried to tell himself he had at last he had become a man  
A dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down  
And he heard again his mothers words  
  
Dont take your guns to town son  
Leave your guns at home Bill  
Dont take your guns to town  
  
Filled with rage then  
Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw  
But the stranger drew his gun and fired  
Before he even saw  
As Billy Joe fell to the floor  
The crowd all gathered round  
And wondered at his final words  
  
Dont take your guns to town son  
Leave your guns at home Bill  
Dont take your guns to town
