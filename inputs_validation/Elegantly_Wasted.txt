Look at all that shines  
Babys down on the world and she knows it  
If your spirits running  
Why dont we make it rain like we used to  
We run  
We hide  
We wait and we want  
The good life  
Aw sure  
Youre right  
This aint the good life  
Ah Elegantly wasted  
Ah Elegantly wasted  
  
Look at all the crimes  
Babys down on the world cause she owns it  
Making up her life  
Nothing more nothing less makes it voodoo  
  
We run  
We hide  
We wait and we want  
The good life  
Aw sure  
Youre right  
This aint the good life  
  
Ah Elegantly wasted  
Ah Elegantly wasted  
  
Well look at all that shines  
Babys down on the world and she knows it  
If your spirits fine  
Why dont we make it rain like we used to  
We run  
We hide  
We want  
The good life  
Aw sure  
Youre right  
This aint the good life  
  
Ah Elegantly wasted you could be right  
You could be certain  
You could be right  
Ah Elegantly wasted  
Ah Elegantly wasted you could be right  
You could be certain  
You could be right  
Ah Elegantly wasted feels like feels like  
  
Elegantly wasted you could be right  
Elegantly wasted you could be certain  
Elegantly wasted you could be right  
Feels right feels right
