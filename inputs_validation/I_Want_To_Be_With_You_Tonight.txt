I hope you know what Im thinking  
I hope you can read my mind  
I hope you dont mind me saying  
I wanna be with you tonight  
Was it just my imagination  
Or a come on look from you  
Did your eyes ask me to question  
Or did I misinterpret you  
I dont know the man at your table  
But I wish you tell him goodbye  
And the looks in your eyes keep saying  
I wanna be with you tonight  
I hope you know what Im thinking  
I hope you can read my mind  
I hope you dont mind me saying  
I wanna be with you tonight  
As he turned you around the dance floor  
Our eyes continue to meet  
As he folds his arms around you  
You heart gets closer to me  
Both of us may be strangers  
But looks are hard to disguise  
And the looks in your eyes keep saying  
I wanna be with you tonight  
I hope you know what Im thinking  
I hope you can read my mind  
I hope you dont mind me saying  
I wanna be with you tonight  
I hope you know what Im thinking  
I hope you can read my mind  
I hope you dont mind me saying  
I wanna be with you tonight  
I hope you know what Im thinking  
I hope you can read my mind  
I hope you dont mind me saying  
I wanna be with you tonight
