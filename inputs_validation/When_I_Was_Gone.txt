When I was gone  
I heard you was fuckin on whoever  
Love you again I can never

Had me pull a hammer on a nigga On a nigga  
Thass why you dont love these hoes

I was in jail wit all niggas  
You was waiting to exhale fucking wit all niggas  
My momma said I should accept yo apology  
But fuck that thats just reverse psychology  
I dont love you no more and I think you a ho  
You let a nigga go too long without no sto  
For all my niggas doing time I know how it get  
Yo homies disappear and yo bitch turn into a flip  
  
Once upon a time I thought I found love but then she played me  
I was gone came back now my baby having a baby  
I know you was cheatin I was outta town eatin  
But real players we dont get mad we get even  
But this is why I lost feelings cause if these hoes aint fully flippin  
Then they cartwheeling  
  
When I was gone  
I heard you was fuckin on whoever
