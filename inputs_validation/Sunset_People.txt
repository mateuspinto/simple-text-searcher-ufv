Late night flight LAX  
Limousine and youre all set  
For sunset for sunset  
  
Riot house a penthouse suite  
The streets alive below your feet  
On sunset on sunset  
  
Rainbow girl whiskey man  
Spotting every star they can  
On sunset on sunset  
  
Rock an roll every night  
Underneath them neon signs  
On sunset on sunset  
  
Sunset people doin it right night after night  
Sunset people night after night doin it right  
Sunset people doin it right night after night  
Sunset people doin it right night after night  
Holdin on to the last breath of life  
On sunset on sunset  
  
Smooth haired guys thumbing rides  
Linin up from side to side  
On sunset on sunset  
  
In between pretty girls  
Still sixteen but know the world  
On sunset on sunset  
  
Foreign cars full of stars  
Tinted glass to hide the scars  
From sunset from sunset  
  
Billboard signs on the strip  
Glamorize the latest hits  
On sunset on sunset  
  
Sunset people doin it right night after night  
Sunset people night after night doin it right  
Sunset people doin it right night after night  
Sunset people doin it right night after night  
Holdin on to the last breath of life  
On sunset on sunset  
  
Friday night the weekend crowd  
Moves on in to get on down  
On sunset on sunset  
  
Life is hot life is fast  
People try to make it last  
On sunset on sunset  
  
Sunset people doin it right night after night  
Sunset people night after night doin it right  
Sunset people doin it right night after night  
Sunset people night after night doin it right  
Sunset people doin it right night after night  
Sunset people night after night doin it right  
Sunset people doin it right night after night
