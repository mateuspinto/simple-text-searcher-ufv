Well there is no such thing as you  
It doesnt matter what you do  
The more you try to qualify  
The more it all will pass you by  
Some people like to make life a little tougher than it is  
Some people like to make life a little tougher than it is  
  
Well the more you try to shave the cat  
The more the thing will bite and scratch  
Its best I think to leave its fur  
And to listen to its silky purr  
Some people like to make life a little tougher than it is  
Some people like to make life a little tougher than it is  
  
Well there is no such thing as you  
It doesnt matter what you do  
The more you try to qualify  
The more it all will pass you by  
Some people like to make life a little tougher than it is  
Some people like to make life a little tougher than it is  
Some people like to make life a little tougher than it is
