Just like jack the ripper just like mojo hand  
Just like billy Sunday in a shotgun ragtime band  
Just like New York city just like Jericho  
Pace the halls and climb the walls and get out when they blow  
  
Did you say your name was ramblin rose  
Ramble on baby settle down easy  
Ramble on rose  
  
Just like Jack and Jill mama told the jailer  
One hear up and one cool down leave nothin for the tailor  
Just like Jack and Jill papa told the jailer  
One go up and one go down do yourself a favor  
  
Did you say your name was ramblin rose  
Ramble on baby settle down easy  
Ramble on rose  
  
Im gonna to sing you a hundred verses in ragtime  
I know this song it aint never gonna end  
Im gonna march you up and down along the county line  
Take you to the leader of a band  
  
Just like crazy Otto just like wolfman jack  
Sittin plush with a royal flush aces back to back  
Just like Mary Shelly just like Frankenstein  
Clank your chains and count your change and try to walk the line  
  
Did you say your name was ramblin rose  
Ramble on baby settle down easy  
Ramble on rose  
  
Im gonna to sing you a hundred verses in ragtime  
I know this song it aint never gonna end  
Im gonna march you up and down along the county line  
Take you to the leader of a band  
  
Goodbye mama and papa  
Goodbye Jack and Jill  
The grass aint greener  
The wine aint sweeter  
Either side of the hill  
  
Did you say your name was ramblin rose  
Ramble on baby settle down easy  
Ramble on rose
