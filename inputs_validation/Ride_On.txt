Dewey Bunnell and Adam Schlesinger  
  
Ride on into the driving rain  
Once more follow the trail  
Long gone into the setting sun  
Ride on you must not fail  
  
Speak out carry the message forth  
Make time use every day  
Reach out to every shining star  
Ride on follow the way  
  
And if your journey should end in the promised land  
Make sure to speak with a voice loud and true  
Shalalalala shalalalala shalalalala  
Ride on  
  
Ride on into the driving rain  
Once more seek out the fire  
Reach out to every shining star  
Ride on you must not tire  
  
And if your journey should end will you understand  
What you have learned and what youve been through  
Shalalalala shalalalala shalalalala  
Shalalalala shalalalala shalalalala  
Ride on ride on ride on ride on ride on ride on
