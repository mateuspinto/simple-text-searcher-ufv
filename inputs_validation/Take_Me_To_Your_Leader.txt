What if your brain  
Unexpectedly and suddenly  
Picked out things to flip around  
And view a lot differently  
What if blue sky  
All of a sudden turned a purple hue  
We would shit a brick the size of all of it  
  
What if  
What if I was just daydreaming  
What if I lived in a pear  
What if my watch read 420 every hour every day  
You can bet your dollar Id be happy  
I forgot to remember  
I forgot to remember my pain  
  
Take me to your leader  
Or die by the fly guy  
What if mothballs  
Hangin around too close to microwaves  
Suddenly woke up and said  
Take me to your leader  
Or die by fly guy  
Hell push ya out  
No wings attached  
Just do as I say no mistake  
Hell blow away  
  
What if I was daydreaming  
What if I lived in a pear  
What if I had a mustard drenched cucumber  
Tied to my leg and I  
Did not want my pants to get dirty  
What if this what if that  
Go I forgot to remember  
I forgot to remember my pain Take me to your leader  
Or die by the fly guy  
  
I forgot to remember my pain  
My pain  
Forgot to inject my cocaine  
Forgot to apply my rogaine  
Forgot to remember my pain  
  
I never think I never thought  
Oh maybe Im insane  
I think I like being  
Way the fuck out of my brain  
  
I forgot to remember  
I forgot to remember my pain  
Take me to your leader  
Or die by the fly guy
