Childhood days in a simmer haze  
Give us a kiss  
In the blue you whisper into the music  
And the feel underneath the foam bush  
Give us a kiss  
Hold me over passing down  
Pass the blood factory and the town  
Come on give us a kiss  
One that will sip sip sip  
Before you slip slip slip away  
  
Yeah Im still hanging out in your blue tunes  
In your sizzling shoes in my dreams  
Give us a kiss  
One little sip sip sip  
Before I catch catch catch  
Ill find Ill be a good girl  
And it burns  
Kiss  
  
You want me to burn away  
You want me to burn away  
You want me to burn away  
If you want me to burn away
