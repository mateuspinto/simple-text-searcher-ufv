Shes got the devil in her heart  
But her eyes they tantalize  
Shes gonna tear your heart apart  
Oh her lips they really thrill me  
  
Ill take my chances  
For romance is  
So important to me  
Shell never hurt me  
She wont desert me  
Shes an angel sent to me  
  
Shes got the devil in her heart  
No no this I cant believe  
Shes gonna tear your heart apart  
No no nay will she deceive  
  
I cant believe that shell ever ever go  
Not when she hugs and says she loves me so  
Shell never hurt me  
She wont desert me  
Listen cant you see  
  
Shes got the devil in her heart  
Oh no no no this I cant believe  
Shes gonna tear your heart apart  
No no nay will she deceive  
  
Dont take chances if your romance is  
So important to you  
Shell never hurt me  
She wont desert me  
Shes an angel sent to me  
  
Shes got the devil in her heart  
Oh no no no no this I cant believe  
Shes gonna tear your heart apart  
No no nay will she deceive  
  
Shes got the devil in her heart  
No shes an angel sent to me  
Shes got the devil in her heart  
No shes an angel sent to me
