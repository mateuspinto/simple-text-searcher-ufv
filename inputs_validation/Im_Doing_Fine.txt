How can I forget the night we met  
I can still remember what you wore  
I had the strangest feeling like wed met before  
Maybe it was something that you said  
How can I forget the night we met  
  
How can I forget when we first touched  
Never thought that I would want someone so much  
I looked in your eyes and then I knew for sure  
You would be my love forevermore  
As you slept I kept thinking of the night we met  
  
Memories come and go like a dream lost in the night  
But I remember everything about you  
How you came and changed my life  
  
And how can I forget those wedding bells  
You looked like an angel I remember well  
How we danced all night and never touched the ground  
How can I forget the night we met  
  
Memories come and go like a dream lost in the night  
But I remember everything about you  
How you came and changed my life  
  
How can I forget your greatest gift  
I swore I saw your eyes when I first looked at his  
And when you cried the tears were falling from my eyes  
As I held our baby held on to his first breath  
How can I forget the first night that we met  
And how can I forget that night  
How can I forget the night we met
