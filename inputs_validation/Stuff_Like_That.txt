Walked in the joint  
They were lined up back to back  
Anything you can name no shame  
Uh uh an stuff like that  
Do it do it do it do it  
  
What makes you feel like doin stuff like that  
What makes you feel like doin stuff like that  
  
Before my eyes was the promise of paradise  
Is she real can she feel is she a dream  
If you know what I mean  
Cause she was built out of stuff like that  
Do it do it  
  
Stuff like that  
Do it do it  
Stuff like that  
Do it do it  
Stuff like that  
  
I knew I was captured  
By the rhythm of the magic flute  
Pulling and urging me  
To taste the forbidden fruit  
  
And though I felt naive  
I did not want to leave fever was in the air  
And all of us sudden and I didnt care  
And no reason why I just had to testify  
  
What makes you feel like doin stuff like that  
What makes you feel like doin stuff like that  
What makes you feel like doin stuff like that  
What makes you feel like doin stuff like that  
Do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it  
  
I knew I was captured  
By the rhythm of the magic flute  
Pulling and urging me  
To taste the forbidden fruit  
  
And though I felt naive  
I did want to play fever was in the air  
And all of us sudden and I didnt care  
And no reason why I just had to testify  
  
What makes you feel like doin stuff like that  
What makes you feel like doin stuff like that  
What makes you feel like doin stuff like that

I cant tell you what I saw  
Made you one was it against the law  
It was not how you could you go  
Thought exactly how low  
  
What makes you feel like doin stuff like that  
What makes you feel like doin stuff like that  
  
All of a sudden I didnt care  
And no reason why had to testify  
  
What makes you feel like doin stuff like that
