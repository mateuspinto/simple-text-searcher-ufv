Why dont we stop fooling ourselves  
The game is over  
Over  
Over  
  
No good times no bad times  
Theres no times at all  
Just The New York Times  
Sitting on the windowsill  
Near the flowers  
  
We might as well be apart  
It hardly matters  
We sleep separately  
  
And drop a smile passing in the hall  
But theres no laughs left  
Cause we laughed them all  
And we laughed them all  
In a very short time  
  
Time  
Is tapping on my forehead  
Hanging from my mirror  
Rattling the teacups  
  
And I wonder  
How long can I delay  
Were just a habit  
Like saccharin  
  
And Im habitually feelin kinda blue  
  
But each time I try on  
The thought of leaving you  
I stop  
I stop and think it over
