One look one kiss  
Just a few words  
Showed me such kindness  
Your eyes really see me  
Not for what Ive been  
But for who I am and what I could be  
  
Chorus  
How did you know I was waiting  
How did you know you were saving me  
Oh what a gift to leave it all behind  
Lonely has known me for the last time  
  
This love is forever  
It wont be taken  
For granted not ever  
  
Chorus
