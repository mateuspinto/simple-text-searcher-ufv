The shoulder that I leaned on was carved out of stone  
But when Im done freezing I want to be alone  
  
Never want my hand cut off  
Never want a hacking cough  
Never need a cliffside push  
Never turn my brain to mush  
  
Always give me what I lack  
Always take the best parts back  
Always recognize your fate  
Always just a moment late  
  
Left is where I always turn  
Left is how Im forced to learn  
Left the route my walking takes  
Left alone with my mistakes  
  
Up against the person who  
Up til now I never knew  
Up from hell the answer blew  
Up or down its up to you  
  
Drop me off the Chinese wall  
And peel my fingers off the rim  
I come unglued while in midair and land to reform  
Limb by limb  
  
And I am taken far away  
  
Lingering slowly melting away  
Tossed with the salad and baled with the hay  
Pooling the water that drips from above  
Trampled by lambs pecked by the dove
