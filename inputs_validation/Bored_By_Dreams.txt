Things are never what they seem  
Play a part most of the time  
What is yours cannot be mine  
And Im bored by dreams  
  
Bored by dreams  
I cant say the words I mean  
Make myself go through the line  
Does the payment fit the crime  
If Im bored by dreams   
  
Take me through the steps my love  
Shall we dance again   
I was older then  
Now we are the same  
  
Lasse des raves  
Rave qui brille dans le noir  
Brillera bien tu peux le croire  
Toujours dire la v
