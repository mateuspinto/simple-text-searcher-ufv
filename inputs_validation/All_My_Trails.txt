Hush little baby dont you cry  
You know your mother was born to die  
All my trials Lord soon be over  
Too late my brothers too late  
But never mind  
All my trials Lord soon be over  
  
The river of Jordan is chilly and cold  
It chills the body but it warms the soul  
All my trials Lord soon be over  
  
Ive got a little book with pages three  
And every page spells liberty  
All my trials Lord soon be over  
Too late my brothers too late  
But never mind  
All my trials Lord soon be over  
  
If living were a thing that money could buy  
You know the rich would live  
And the poor would die  
All my trials Lord soon be over  
  
There grows a tree in Paradise  
The Christians call it the tree of life  
All my trials Lord soon be over  
Too late my brothers too late  
But never mind  
All my trials Lord soon be over
