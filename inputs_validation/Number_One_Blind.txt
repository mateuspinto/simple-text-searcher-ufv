Be my blind  
Be it all the time  
Be it night or day  
Take my sun away away  
Levolor which of us is blind  
Levolor left me in the dark  
Levolor I cant see a thing but you  
Is it morning  
Blind me please I am on my hands and knees  
I can only pray  
Take my sun away away  
Levolor which of us is blind  
Levolor left me in the dark  
Levolor I cant see a thing but you  
Is it morning  
It is time  
It is time ohoh  
Levolor which of us is blind  
Levolor left me in the dark  
Levolor I cant see a thing but you  
Is it morning  
Levolor which of us is blind  
Levolor left me in the dark  
Levolor I cant see a thing but you  
Is it morning  
Levolor Levolor Levolor Levolor
