My love comes and when it does  
Its a crazy kind of  
Selective affection  
My love flows like a wise guys tie  
In the zanniest of directions  
My love protection my love erection  
You better get some of my infection  
My love can beabigger than  
The hoover dam  
My love can hide behind  
A grain of sand  
My love for life is fueled by  
The love for my man  
I love his mother and  
The silly mystic man  
Some people think hes bad  
They say he doesnt laugh  
And ask my dad  
  
My love is death to apartheid rule  
My love is deepest depth the ocean blues  
  
My love is the Zulu groove  
My love is keep it or move  
My love is a laughin boozed  
My love is the pussy juice  
My love cant be refused  
My love is gettin my food  
My love my love  
  
My love began from love  
My love for an unknown grubby bum  
My love for the baby suckin on his thumb  
My love for the best set of buns  
My love for the feel of the drums  
My love for a butter knuckle hands  
My love for the swedes in the bad  
My love for the legs that I spin  
My love for the fat mingy  
My love my love  
My love is my gross inner self  
My love is my dick in my head  
My love is my gross inner self  
My love is my dick in my head
