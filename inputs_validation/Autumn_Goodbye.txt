Chorus  
I never promised you a happy ending  
You never said you wouldnt make me cry  
But summer love will keep us warm long after  
Our autumn goodbye autumn goodbye autumn goodbye  
  
Thinking of you  
And the love of our lives  
In the sweet summertime  
so sad but true so true so true  
We must leave it behind in our heart in our mind  
From April through September  
Bittersweet was the love that we shared dont forget I remember  
  
ChorusRepeat x2  
  
Memories can make they can make  
But my heart has a place for the smile on your face  
And maybe someday someday  
We can be more than friends love will find us again  
Red leaves and blue tomorrows  
Time will give back the love that we shared on the time that we borrowed  
  
ChorusRepeat x2  
  
From April through September  
Bittersweet was the love that we shared dont forget I remember  
  
ChorusRepeat x2  
  
We leave behind the sum my time our hearts our minds  
They will remind we wont forget  
The day we met  
The day we cried ooh  
Autumn goodbye  
  
Chorus
