If youre dreamin son dont you rise  
I never get lost so deep into us  
I wont give up until you give in but I know you must realize  
  
Chorus  
I could be good for you you could be good for me too yeah  
I could be good for you you could be good for me too  
  
Everyone knows but they dont know why  
How much will a smile you satisfy  
Stars gonna shine the way that you feel  
So there is no reason I wonder why  
  
Chorus x3
