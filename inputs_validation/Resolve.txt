Something that I felt today something that I had  
Swingin from the chandoleres hanging on your word  
I remember watchin you once upon a time  
Dancing from across the room in another life  
  
A little bit of resolve is what I need now  
Pin me down show me how  
A little bit of resolve is what I need now  
Pin me down show me how  
  
Lookin back to find my way never sing so hard  
Yesterdays belated rest changing of the gods  
I would never change a thing even if I could  
All the songs we used to sing everything was gone  
  
A little bit of resolve is what I need now  
Pin me down show me how  
A little bit of resolve is what I need now  
Pin me down show me how  
  
One more Louvre that youre not here  
Its gone and passed you by  
Happened to you happened to you  
One more tear that you wont hear  
Thats gone and passed you by  
Happened to you happened to you  
  
A little bit of resolve is what I need now  
Pin me down show me how  
A little bit of resolve is what I need now  
Pin me down show me how  
  
A little bit of resolve  
One more Louvre that youre not here  
Its gone and passed you by A little bit of resolve  
A little bit of resolve  
One more Louvre that youre not here  
Its gone and passed you by A little bit of resolve
