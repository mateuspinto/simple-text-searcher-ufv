I Wanted So to tell that old man Oh so many things  
Like the corn was 10 feet tall that he had planted in the sping  
And the books hed ordered came in in the mail just yesterday  
But he never said a word and life slowly slipped away  
  
I Wanted So to tell him just how much he meant to me  
I Wanted So to thank him for what he taught me that I could be  
I wanted him to know that his grandchildren all were there  
And that his four year old grandson said Papa I said a prayer  
  
I wanted to apologize for always being on the go  
For never having enough time to talk about the things that he needed so  
I Wanted So to tell him Pop your loved ones all are here  
But he just lay there with his eyes closed and I think he shed a knowing
tear  
  
Yes I Wanted So to tell that old man Oh so many things  
Like the corn was 10 feet tall that he had planted in the sping  
And the books hed ordered came in in the mail just yesterday  
But he never said a word and life just slowly slipped away
