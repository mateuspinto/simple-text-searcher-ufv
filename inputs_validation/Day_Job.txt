Maybe you collect or maybe you pay whether  
Still got to work that eight hour day  
Whether you like that job or not  
Youd better keep it on ice while youre lining up your long shot  
  
Which is to say hey hey keep your day job  
Dont give it away keep your day job whatever they say  
Keep your day job till your night job pays  
  
Steady boys starting that eight day hour  
Never underrate that paycheck power  
By now you know that the face on your dollar  
Got a thumb on its nose and a hand on your collar  
With a chance to say hey hey keep your day job  
  
Daddy may drive a v8 vette  
Mama may bathe in champagne yet  
God bless the child thats got his own stash  
Nine to five and a place to crash  
Which is to say  
Sunday comes forget about work ring that bell for whatever its worth  
If you ask me like I know you wont  
Ill tell you what to do what I know that you wont
