When I look at the letter that you wrote to me  
Its you that Im thinking of  
As I read the lines that to me were so sweet  
I remember our faded love  
  
Chorus  
I miss you darlin more and more every day  
As heaven would miss the stars above  
With every heartbeat I still think of you  
And remember our faded love  
  
As I think of the past and all the pleasure we had  
As I watch the mating of a dove  
And it was in the springtime that we said goodbye  
I remember our faded love  
  
Chorus
