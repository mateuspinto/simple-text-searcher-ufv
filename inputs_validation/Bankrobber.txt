My daddy was a bank robber  
But he never hurt nobody  
He just loved to live that way  
And he loved to steal your money  
  
Some is rich and some is poor  
Thats the way the world is  
But I dont believe in lying back  
Sayin how bad your luck is  
  
So we came to jazz it up  
We never loved a shovel  
Break your back to earn your pay  
An dont forget to grovel  
  
The old man spoke up in a bar  
Said I never been in prison  
A lifetime serving one machine  
Is ten times worse than prison  
  
Imagine if all the boys in jail  
Could get out now together  
Whadda you think theyd want to say to us  
While we was being clever  
  
Someday youll meet your rocking chair  
Cause thats where were spinning  
Theres no point to want to comb your hair  
When its grey and thinning  
  
Run rabbit run  
Strike out boys for the hills  
I can find that hole in the wall  
And I know that they never will
