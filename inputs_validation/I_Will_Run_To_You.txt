Your eye is on the sparrow  
And Your hand it comforts me  
From the ends of the Earth to the depth of my heart  
Let Your mercy and strength be seen  
  
You call me to Your purpose  
As angels understand  
For Your glory may You draw all men  
As Your love and grace demand  
  
And I will run to You  
To Your words of truth  
Not by might not by power  
But by the spirit of God  
Yes I will run the race  
Till I see Your face  
Oh let me live in the glory of Your grace
