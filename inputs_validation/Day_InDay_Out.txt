Day in day out  
The same old hoodoo follows me about  
The same old pounding in my heart whenever I think of you  
And darling I think of you  
Day in and day out  
  
Day out day in  
I neednt tell you how my days begin  
When I awake I awaken with a tingle  
One possibility in view  
That possibility of maybe seeing you  
  
Come rain come shine  
I meet you and to me the day is fine  
Then I kiss your lips  
And the pounding becomes  
The oceans roar  
A thousand drums  
Cant you see its love  
Can there be any doubt  
When there it is  
Day in day out
