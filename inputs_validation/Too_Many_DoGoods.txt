We got too many do goods and not enough hard working men  
We got too many hands out and not enough lendin a hand  
We got too many thinkers looking for the answer in the wind  
Hey we got too many do goods and not enough hard working men  
We got poets and prophets and some folks are readin the stars  
If wed look a little closer to home we might find who we are  
We got all kinds of sermons in booklets and pamphlets on sin  
Hey we got too many do goods and not enough hard working men  
We got too many do goods  
We got clubs and committees who know all about wrong and right  
Oh but Ive seen some children who starved plumb to death on advice  
I appreciate your sympathy and I believe in missionary work  
But a little bit of bendin down and pickin up your brother wouldnt hurt  
We got too many do goods
