My coffees cold my papers old  
My heart is sold to melancholia  
My clothes are torn my shoes are worn  
My heart is born to melancholia  
  
A strange surprise what I despise in other guys is here in me  
They lose their girl they lose their world  
And then they cry for all to see  
Ive never felt so bad the fires drive me mad  
  
The sheets are gray left since the day she went away I lost all power  
The dust is thick the dog is sick the kids have picked most of the flowers  
  
The sun is shining but not for me  
The sun is shining but not for me  
Ive never felt so bad the fires drive me mad  
  
The sheets are gray left since the day she went away I lost all power  
The dog is sick the dust is thick the kids have picked most of the flowers
