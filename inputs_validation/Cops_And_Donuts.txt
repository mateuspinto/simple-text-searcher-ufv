When I was on the freeway doing 70 all drunk  
A copper pulled me over and I thought that I was sunk  
He came up to my car I thought up a little trick  
I took a donut jelly filled and put it on a stick  
He came up to my window and shouted to get out  
So I quickly took the donut and I shoved it in his mouth  
So I drove away he shouted for some more  
So I threw it out the window and he ate it off the floor  
  
Cops and donuts  
Cops love donuts  
Cops love donuts  
Cops and donuts
