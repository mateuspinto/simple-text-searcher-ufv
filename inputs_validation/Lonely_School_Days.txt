I saw you when you came in this morning  
All chummy with somebody new  
And I was all alone this morning  
In sorrrow still loving you  
I know it shows Im broken hearted  
This feelin just wont go away  
Ive been so lonesome since we parted  
And Ill be blue again in school today  
Lonely school days do I have when you  
Come to school with someone new  
In my deepest sorrow over losing you  
Lonely school days keep me blue  
I saw you eating in the lunch room  
Right where we used to sit and dine  
With someone snugged up close beside you  
Enjoying pleasures that were mine  
You talk to them along the hallways  
You walk with them to classes too  
You leave and go with them of evenings  
And I go home alone and blue
