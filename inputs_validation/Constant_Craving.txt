Even through the darkest phase  
Be it thick or thin  
Always someone marches brave  
Here beneath my skin  
  
And Constant constant craving craving  
Has always always been  
  
Maybe a great magnet pulls  
All souls towards truth  
Or maybe it is life itself  
Leads wisdom to its youth  
  
Constant constant craving craving  
Has always always been  
  
Craving  
Aha constant craving  
Has always been  
Has always been  
  
Constant constant craving craving  
Has always always been  
Constant constant craving craving  
Has always always been  
  
Craving  
Aha constant craving  
Has always been  
Has always been  
Has always been  
Has always been  
Has always been  
Has always been  
Has always been  
Has always been
