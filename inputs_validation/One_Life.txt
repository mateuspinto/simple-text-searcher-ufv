One life is like one prayer one love to share  
One thought one dream One world one meaning  
A man thats lost everything holds his faith in his heart  
Speaks to god of broken dreams  
Never wondering why when nothings heard one prayer  
  
A woman cries in frustration her man holds it inside  
They forgot what got them here  
The vows they promised to stand by one love  
  
One life is like one prayer one love to share  
One thought one dream  
One world one meaning  
  
It dont cost much for you to get to heaven  
You just got to say your prayers  
If you want to stand with your saviors  
You better learn how to bow your head  
Now bend your knees and bruise the earth and pray  
  
Heed the cries of the war child  
Mothers hold them to their breasts  
Fathers fight an enemy and fear breeds unto itself one world  
  
One life is like one prayer one love to share  
One thought one dream  
One world one meaning  
One life one
