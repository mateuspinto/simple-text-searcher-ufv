Walk on the water  
Swim with the life tide  
Clear away the storm clouds  
Oh  
  
You got to  
Roll with the punches  
Shelter from the weather  
Have no fear of the darkness  
Sooner or later oh  
Sooner or later oh  
Well be walkin on air  
  
Live for the moment  
cause life is worth living  
Love will surround you  
Sooner or later oh  
Sooner or later oh  
Well be walkin on air  
Well be walkin on air  
  
Love is out there waiting for you  
Wearing no disguise  
Nothing left behind closed doors  
Its right before your eyes  
So take a walk in the sunshine  
Send a message on your online  
Then you can do it in your own time  
Sooner or later oh  
Sooner or later oh  
Well be walkin on air  
Walkin on air  
Well be walkin on air  
  
Walk on the water  
Shelter from the weather  
Clear away the storm clouds  
Sooner or later oh  
Sooner or later oh  
Sooner or later oh  
Sooner or later oh  
Well be walkin on air  
Walkin on air  
Well be walkin on air
