I dont like to be alone in the night  
And I dont like to hear Im wrong when Im right  
And I dont like to have the rain on my shoe  
But I do love you but I do love you  
I dont like to see the sky painted gray  
And I dont like when nothings going my way  
And I dont like to be the one with the blues  
But I do love you but I do love you  
Love everything about the way youre loving me  
The way you lay your head  
Upon my shoulder when you sleep  
And I love to kiss you in the rain  
I love everything you do oh I do  
I dont like to turn the radio on  
Just to find I missed my favorite song  
And I dont like to be the last with the news  
But I do love you but I do love you  
Love everything about the way youre loving me  
The way you lay your head  
Upon my shoulder when you sleep  
And I love to kiss you in the rain  
I love everything you do oh I do  
And I dont like to be alone in the night  
And I dont like to hear Im wrong when Im right  
And I dont like to have the rain on my shoes  
But I do love you but I do love you  
But I do love you but I do love you
