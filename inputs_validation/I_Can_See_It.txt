Ah okay  
The hills are alive  
And its pretty frightening  
The sun goes down  
  
The moon comes out  
The people gather round and we all begin to shout  
Ech mud  
You better not cry  
  
You better not shout  
You better not pout  
Im telling you why  
Santa claus is dead  
  
Theres a song I must sing  
Its a well known song  
But the tune is bitter  
And it doesnt take long to learn I can learn  
That pretty little world that beams so bright  
That pretty little world that seems delightful cambered  
Let me learnlet me learn  
  
For I can see it shining somewhere  
Bright lights somewhere invite me to compare and learn  
And Im ready I can hear it silent singing  
Inside my ear I hear them all singing of love  
  
Who knows maybe all the visions that I see  
May be waiting just for me to say  
Take me there and make me see it make me feel it  
I know it so I know that it really may be  
Let me learn
