Yeah they said you called me maybe yesterday  
I dont even have the strength to pick up the phone  
You wouldnt even know me since you went away  
The Prozac doesnt do it for me anymore  
Yeah you ought to take your medication every day  
Be a good dog live life in a wonderful way  
  
Tell me why you want to be blind  
I dont want to be normal like you  
I know now every day  
I get closer to the place inside  
Where I can be normal too  
  
I heard those stupid people talk about you again  
I just have to laugh to keep from hurting bad  
Their simple minds just cannot seem to understand  
You are neurotic and depressed  
It doesnt mean that youre sad  
  
You walk around oblivious to everything  
You wear that party dress black mascara  
Like youre queen for the day  
I will never be normal like you  
You walk around oblivious to everyone  
I see you walking slow and simple underneath the big black sun  
  
Tell me why you want to be blind  
I dont want to be normal like you  
I know now every day  
I get closer to the place inside  
Where I can be complacent  
I get closer to the place inside  
  
Where I can be sedated  
Yes I get closer to the place inside  
Where I can be normal too I can be normal too  
I can be normal like you
