This is my song  
Oh God of all the nations  
A song of peace  
For lands afar and mine  
  
This is my home  
The country where my heart is  
Here are my hopes  
My dreams my holy shrine  
  
But other hearts  
In other lands are beating  
With hopes and dreams  
As true and high as mine  
  
My countries skies  
Are bluer than the ocean  
And sunlight beams  
On clover leaf and pine  
  
But other lands  
Have sunlight too and clover  
And skies are everywhere  
As blue as mine  
  
Oh hear my song  
Oh God of all the nations  
A song of peace  
For their land and for mine
