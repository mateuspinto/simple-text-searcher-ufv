When Im alone in my room  
Sometimes I stare at the wall  
And in the back of my mind  
I hear my conscience call  
Telling me I need a girl whos as sweet as a dove  
For the first time in my life I see I need love  
There I was giggling about the games  
That I had played with many hearts and Im not saying no names  
Then the thought occurred Tear drops made my eyes burn  
As I said to myself Look what youve done to her  
I can feel it inside I cant explain how it feels  
All I know is that Ill never dish another raw deal  
Playing make believe pretending that Im true  
Holding in my laugh as I say that I love you  
Saying amore kissing you on the ear  
Whispering I love you and Ill always be near  
Although I often reminisce I cant believe that Ive found  
A desire for true love floating around  
Inside my soul because my soul is cold  
One half of me deserves to be this way till Im old  
But the other half needs affection and joy  
And the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy  
I need love  
  
I need love  
  
Romance sheer delight how sweet  
Ive got to find me a girl to make my life complete  
You can scratch my back well get cozy and huddle  
Ill lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle  
Give you a rose pull out your chair before we eat  
Kiss you on the cheek and say Ooh girl youre so sweet  
Its De Ja Vu whenever Im with you  
I can go on forever telling you what Ill do  
But where you at Youre neither here nor there  
I swear I cant find you anywhere  
Damn sure you aint in my closet or under my rug  
This love search is really making me bugged  
And if you know who you are why dont you make yourself seen  
Take a chance with my love and youll find out what I mean  
Fantasies can run but they cant hide  
And when I find you Ima pour all my love inside  
I need love  
  
I need love  
  
I wanna kiss you hold you never scold you just love you  
Suck on your neck caress you and rub you  
Grind mold and never be alone  
If youre not standing next to me youre on the phone  
Cant you hear it in my voice I need love bad  
Ive got money but loves something I never had  
I need your ruby red lips sweet face and all  
I love you more than a man whos ten feet tall  
I watch the sun rise in your eyes  
Were so in love when we hug we become paralyzed  
Our bodies explode in extacy unreal  
Youre as soft as a pillow and Im as hard as steel  
Its like a dream land I cant lie Ive never been there  
Maybe this is an experience that me and you can share  
Clean and unsoiled yet sweaty and wet  
I swear to you this is something Ill never forget  
I need love  
  
I need love  
  
See what I mean Ive changed Im no longer  
A playboy on the run I need something thats stronger  
Friendship trust honor respect admiration  
This whole experience has been such a revelation  
Its taught me love and how to be a real man  
To always be considerate and do all I can  
Protect you youre my lady and you mean so much  
My body tingles all over with the slightest touch  
Of your hand and understand Ill be frozen in time  
Till we meet face to face and you tell me youre mine  
If I find you girl I swear Ill be a good man  
Im not gonna leave it in destinys hand  
I cant sit and wait for my princess to arrive  
I gotta struggle and fight to keep my dream alive  
Id search the whole world for that special girl  
And when I finally find you watch our love unfurl  
I need love  
  
I need love  
  
Girl listen to me  
When I be sitting in my room all alone staring at the wall  
Fantasies they go through my mind  
And Ive come to realize that I need true love  
And if you want to give it to me girl make yourself seen  
Ill be waiting I love you
