Verse 1 Wiz Khalifa  
Woke up feeling like a star  
Get it in no matter where we are  
She in love with me press buttons up in my car  
My weed smoke hella potent  
Riding and the sunroof open  
Blowing smoke out what they know about  
Being bosses taking losses  
Pay the cost to fuck that bitch who got that poke out  
My money aint slow got more trees to roll  
Got a son I love to death I gotta see him grow  
Probably the best youve seen but I be on the low  
Stacking up rolling marijuana acting up  
Bitch with me she be bad as fuck  
Bitches love it niggas mad at us  
Getting money thats accurate  
Say they want it but they cant adjust  
Taylor Gang roll a plane

Keep OG Kush up in my lungswhoa  
Your hoe will come with usay  
Cause she know we brought the drugsay  
And she looking for some loveay  
But lets keep that on the hushwhoa  
Its hard to find some trust  
Some say its hard to fuck with us  
Thats cause we be on different shit  
Bitch i might pour six up in my Crush
