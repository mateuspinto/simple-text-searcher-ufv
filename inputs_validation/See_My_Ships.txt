See my ships  
They are sailing  
In and out of the harbor  
Will they go together  
Or must they stay apart  
Yes I know its in my heart  
Surely you see whats inside of me  
Jesus is coming soon  
I can hear Gabriel  
Blow his trumpet tune  
This I know  
This I know  
Our Lord is coming soon  
Mercy mercy me  
Marvin Gaye he was shot  
By his father  
O my Father  
Have mercy on me  
Cold kane o my cheap thrill  
O my shame for Cain  
And the devil  
Momma I need water  
Im thirsty  
Surely you see  
Whats inside of me
