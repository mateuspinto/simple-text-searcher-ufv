Stranded at the drive in  
Branded a fool  
What will they say  
Monday at school  
  
Sandy cant you see Im a misery  
We made a start now were apart  
theres nothing left for me  
Love has flown all alone  
I sit I wonder whyyy Oh why  
You left me oh Sandy  
Oh Sandy Baby  
Someday when my high school is done  
Somehow someway our two worlds will be one  
And heaven forever and ever we will be  
Oh see please say youll stay Oh Sandy  
Oh sandy you hurt me real bad call me back coz baby you gotta believe me
when I say Im helpless without you  
Love has flown all alone  
I sit I wonder whyyy oh why  
You left me oh sandy  
Oh sandy baby  
Someday when my high school is done  
Somehow Someday our two worlds will be one  
Heaven forever and ever we will be  
Oh see please say youll stay oh sandyyyyyyy oh sandy
