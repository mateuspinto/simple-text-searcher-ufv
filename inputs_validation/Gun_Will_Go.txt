We got butter  
We got butter  
  
Gonna go  
Gonna go  
  
One thing for sure keep you a vault  
Keep a nice crib fly away Keep to the point  
Keep niggas outta your face who snakes  
Keep bitches in their place keep the mac in a special place  
  
Keep movin for papes  
Keep cool  
Keep doin what you doin  
Keep it fly keep me in the crates  
  
Rekwon  
Cause I will erase shit on a real note yous a waste  
Its right here for you I will lace you  
Rip you embrace you  
Put a nice w up on your face  
Word to mother you can get chase  
It s nothing to taste  
Blood on a thug  
If he gotta go  
All I know is  
We be giving grapes  
  
This is a place from where we make tapes  
We make them everywhere stealing all  
We be making base  
Youll be making pace  
These little niggas they be making shapes  
Our shit is art yours is trace  
  
This is the way that we roll in the street  
You know when we roll we be packing the heat  
Gonna go Gonna go Gonna go Gonna go Gonna go Gonna go  
  
Method Man  
This is poverty island man these animals dont run  
Slums where the ambulance dont come  
Who got the best base fiends waiting to smoke some  
Approach son  
Ask him where he getting that coke from  
My dudes hug blocks like samurai shogun  
Cause no v and no ones Equalin no fun  
Who wanna treat they know huh  
Body to go numb  
A woman need funds plus her hair and her toes done  
It is what it is though  
You Fuck with the kid flow  
  
You make it harder to dough the harder the get go  
Harder to pimp flow harder when it snow  
The pinky and the wrist glow  
Cause here we live fo  
Get guap and get low  
But first off you gotta get the work off  
To get from the curse boss  
Yeah See Im the shit  
Them dirt on the fifth know  
Hustling from the get go  
The motto is get mo  
  
Chorus  
This is the way that we roll in the street  
You know when we roll we be packing the heat  
Gonna go gonna go gonna go gonna go gonna go  
  
Gza  
We was quiet flashy brothers  
Strapped all along with the dirty 38 long  
12 hour shift gate took case in state  
you think he wont hold his weight  
put the money on the plate and watch it get scraped  
  
We get ape up in that club  
Off that juice and hen  
And its an no win situation  
Fucking with them  
  
You mean like Ewen at the front of the rim  
Finger roll a dutch  
Million dollar stage is touched  
Techs gauges bust  
  
Trust no one  
The lone shogun  
Rugged tim boots stompa  
Damaging lyrical mass destruction launcher  
  
Nothing can calm the quakage  
When I break kid  
Peace to my brothers up north  
Doing state bids  
  
This is the way we be rollin in the street  
You know when we roll that we be packing the heat  
Gonna go gonna go gonna go gonna go gonna go  
  
This is the way we be rollin in the club  
You know when we roll that we be packing 32 slugs  
Gonna go gonna go gonna go gonna go gonna go
