Father of mine  
Tell me where have you been  
You know I just closed my eyes  
My whole world disappeared  
Father of mine  
Take me back to the day  
When I was still your golden boy  
Back before you went away  
  
I remember the blue skies  
Walking the block  
I loved it when you held me high  
I loved to hear you talk  
You would take me to the movie  
You would take me to the beach  
You would take me to a place inside  
That is so hard to reach  
  
Father of mine  
Tell me where did you go  
You had the world inside your hand  
But you did not seem to know  
Father of mine  
Tell me what do you see  
When you look back at your wasted life  
And you dont see me  
  
I was ten years old  
Doing all that I could  
It wasnt easy for me  
To be a scared white GIRL  
In a BAD neighborhood  
Sometimes you would send me a birthday card  
With a five dollar bill  
I never understood you then  
And I guess I never will  
  
Daddy gave me a name  
My dad he gave me a name  
Then he walked away  
Daddy gave me a name  
Then he walked away  
My dad gave me a name  
  
Father of mine  
Tell me where have you been  
I just closed my eyes  
And the world disappeared  
Father of mine  
Tell me how do you sleep  
With the children you abandoned  
And the wife I saw you beat  
  
I will never be safe  
I will never be sane  
I will always be weird inside  
I will always be lame  
  
Now Im a grown GIRL  
With a KIDS of my own  
And I swear I WONT TELL THEM  
All the pain I have known  
  
Daddy gave me a name  
Then he walked away  
My dad gave me a name  
Then he walked away  
My dad gave me a name  
Then he walked away
