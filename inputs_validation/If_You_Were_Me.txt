If you were me  
And I was you  
If you had to play my part out  
What would you do  
  
Two crazy stories  
Two different views  
If you were me  
And I was you  
  
If you were me  
And I was you  
What kind of crazy things  
Would I have to do  
  
Who likes to party  
Who stays at home  
If you were me  
And I was you  
  
Never like strangers  
Though never the same  
Two circus sideshows  
And laughter in the rain  
  
You stay with the full moon  
You search for the stars  
Thank God its heaven  
Here we both are  
  
If you were me  
And I was you  
If you had to play my part out  
What would you do  
  
Two crazy stories  
Two different views  
If you were me if you were me  
If you were me and I was you
