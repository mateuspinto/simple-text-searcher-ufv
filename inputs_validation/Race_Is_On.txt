Well I feel tears wellin up cold and deep inside like my hearts sprung a big
break  
And a stab of loneliness sharp and painful that I may never shake  
Now you might say that I was takin it hard that he wrote me off with a call  
But dont you wager that Ill hide the sorrow when I may break right down and
bawl  
Now the race is on and here comes pride up the backstretch  
Heartaches are going to the inside  
My tears are holdin back theyre tryin not to fall  
My hearts out of the runnin true love scratched for anothers sake  
The race is on and it looks like heartaches and the winner loses all  
 guitar  steel   
One day I ventured in love never once suspectin what the final result would
be  
How I lived in fear of waking up each morning and findin that youre gone
from me  
Cause theres ache and pain in my heart for today was the one that I hated to
face  
Somebody new came up to win him and I came out in second place  
Now the race is on
