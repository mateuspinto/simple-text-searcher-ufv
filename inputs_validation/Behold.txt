Behold  
Words and music by Ray Boltz  
Behold the cross that Jesus bore  
Behold the crown of thorns He wore  
Behold the price that Jesus paid  
The glorious sacrifice that He made  
chorus  
Behold oh behold  
Jesus Christ the Lord  
Behold He is the one  
That we adore  
Behold the tomb where Jesus lay  
Behold the stone  
Its been rolled away  
Behold His resurrection power  
He lives again He lives this hour  
chorus  
Behold a world in slumber lies  
And then thunder fills the skies  
An angel shouts  
A trumpet sounds  
The saints of God are glory bound  
chorus  
And we adore You Lord  
And we adore Your name  
And we lift up our hearts in praise
