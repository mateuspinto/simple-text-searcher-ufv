Well I spent all my money at the record store  
Bought a copy of Revolver and some Gang of Four  
Singles Going Steady  
Billie Holliday  
They had it all on vinyl  
And I was blown away  
  
Then I walked around the corner to my favorite bar  
I do a lot more walkin since I wrecked my car  
They all know my name here  
I feel right at home  
I just might spend the night here  
Since I know youre not alone  
  
And then they play that song I love  
And I feel like I just cant loose  
I feel like I should call you up  
But Ill stay here all night  
Till I get it right  
  
Well I wrote you a letter but I tore it up  
Then I wrote another letter and I tore it up  
Stare up at the ball game  
On the TV screen  
If you care to find me  
Youll know where Ill be  
  
And then they play that song I love  
And I feel like I just cant loose  
I feel like I should call you up  
But Ill stay here all night  
Till I get it right  
  
Im down  
Im down  
Im down  
Im down  
  
And then they play that song I love  
And I feel like I just cant loose  
I feel like I should call you up  
But Ill stay here all night  
Till I get it right  
  
And then they play that song I hate  
And I feel like I just cant win  
Im breakin down  
The room begins to spin  
Ill stay here all night  
Till I get it right
