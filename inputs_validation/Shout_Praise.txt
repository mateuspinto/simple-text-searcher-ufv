Praise Him sun and moon praise Him shining stars  
All created things made at His command  
Governments and kings nations of the earth  
Gather young and old to worship  
Let everything that has breath  
  
Shout praise to His name  
To the name above all names  
Sing glory hallelujah  
Hallelujah to His name  
King Jesus Jesus be praised  
  
Underneath our feet theres a shaking  
As the church awakes to its calling  
Hope is rising strong freedoms coming  
Heaven and earth unite in worship  
Let everything that has breath  
  
Shout praise to His name  
To the name above all names  
Sing glory hallelujah  
Hallelujah to His name  
King Jesus Jesus be praised  
  
What you want what you know  
Weve got to make His kingdom grow  
What you want what you know  
Weve got to make His kingdom grow  
  
The King is coming King is coming  
Let everything that has breath praise Him  
The King is coming King is coming  
Let everything that has breath praise Him

Let everything that has breath praise Him
