In 1814 we took a little trip  
Along with colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississippi  
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans  
And we fought the bloody British in the town of New Orleans  
  
We fired our guns and the British kept a comin  
There wasnt bout as many as there was awhile ago  
We fired once more and they began to runnin  
On down the Mississippi to the gulf of Mexico  
  
Oh we looked down the river and we seen the british come  
There must have been a hundred of em beatin on a drum  
They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring  
We stood behind our cotton bales and didnt say a thing  
  
Old hickory said we could take em by surprise  
If we didnt fire our muskets till we looked em in the eyes  
We held our fire till we seen their faces well  
Then we opened up our squirrel guns and gave em a little well we  
  
Fired our guns and the British kept a comin  
There wasnt bout as many as there was awhile ago  
We fired once more and they began to runnin  
On down the Mississippi to the gulf of Mexico  
  
We fired our cannons till the barrels melted down  
Then we grabbed an alligator and we fired another round  
We filled his head with cannonballs and powdered his behind  
And when we touched the powder off the gator lost his mind  
  
We fired our guns and the British kept a comin  
There wasnt bout as many as there was awhile ago  
We fired once more and they began to runnin  
On down the Mississippi to the gulf of Mexico  
  
We fired our guns and the British kept a comin  
There wasnt bout as many as there was awhile ago  
We fired once more and they began to runnin  
On down the Mississippi to the gulf of Mexico
