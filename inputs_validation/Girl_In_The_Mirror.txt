Theres a girl in the mirror  
I wonder who she is  
Sometimes I think I know her  
Sometimes I really wish I did  
  
Theres a story in her eyes  
Lullabies and goodbyes  
When shes looking back at me  
I can tell her heart is broken easily  
  
Cause the girl in my mirror  
Is crying out tonight  
And theres nothing I can tell her  
To make her feel alright  
  
Oh the girl in my mirror  
Is crying cause of you  
And I wish there was something  
Something I could do  
  
If I could  
I would tell her  
Not to be afraid  
The pain that shes feeling  
  
The sense of loneliness will fade  
So dry your tears and rest assured  
Love will find you like before  
When shes looking back at me  
I know nothing really works that easily  
  
Cause the girl in my mirror  
Is crying in tonight  
And theres nothing I can tell her  
To make her feel alright  
  
Oh the girl in my mirror  
Is crying cause of you  
And I wish there was something  
I wish there was something  
Oh I wish there was something  
I could do  
  
I cant believe its what I see  
That the girl in the mirror  
The girl in the mirror  
Is me  
  
I cant believe what I see no  
The girl in my mirror  
The girl in my mirror is me  
Ohh is me  
  
Cause the girl in my mirror  
Is crying out tonight  
And theres nothing I can tell her  
To make her feel alright  
  
Oh the girl in my mirror  
Is crying cause of you  
I wish there was something  
I wish there was something  
Oh I wish there was something  
I could do
