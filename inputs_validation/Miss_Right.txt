Hello good evening  
  
Came in here shut the world out  
Nothing to get into nothing to bein bout  
Just grab a little bite quite a little night  
By no means looking for Miss Right  
But hello good evening  
  
Clearly she was out with her girls alone That I could tell  
Beautiful barely any makeup on So natural  
The kind that make you wanna put the games away  
Think about the future but first Ill say  
Hello good evening  
  
Oh Miss Right Miss Right  
What are you doing here  
Oh Miss Right wasnt expecting you tonight  
Oh Miss Right Miss Right  
How about we disappear  
Said if you got no plans baby if you got time  
Come and be the rest of my life  
Oh Miss Right yeah  
  
But aint it amazing  
Spend forever looking all the time wasting  
Soon as I throw my hands up and say I quit  
Turn the corner and there my future sits  
Hello good evening
