Look at me dreaming of you  
All I could hope is to have you  
To have you walking with me  
Laughing so in love we two  
Almost drunkenly  
I did imbibe of this  
Fantasy of you and me  
  
Was I a fool to think  
The way you looked at me  
I swear you did  
But you looked away too quick  
Was I a fool was I a fool to think  
That you would take me home  
As if I was yours  
Was I a fool to think at all  
  
Ive grown tired of love  
You are the trouble with me  
I watch you walk right by  
I smile you do not notice me  
Treat me recklessly  
All you do is toss me pennies out  
But the silence in me is screaming  
Wont you come and get me  
  
Was I a fool to think  
The way you looked at me  
I swear you did  
But you looked away too quick  
Was I a fool was I a fool to think  
That you would take me home  
As if I was yours  
Was I a fool to think at all  
  
Was I a fool to think  
The way you looked at me  
I swear you did  
But you looked away too quick  
Was I a fool was I a fool to think  
That you would take me home  
As if I was yours  
Was I a fool to think at all  
  
You make a mess of me here  
I dance a thousand steps for you  
If you say yes to me  
Ill be whatever gets you through  
  
You make a mess of me here was I a fool  
I dance a thousand steps for you was I a fool  
Was I a fool was I a fool to think  
Am I a fool am I a fool for you
