Eyes are feeling heavy  
But they never seem to close  
The fan blades on the ceiling spin  
But the air is never cold  
And even though youre next to me  
I still feel so alone  
I just cant give you anything  
For you to call your own  
  
And I can feel you breathing  
And its keeping me awake  
Can you feel it beating  
My heart sinking like a wave  
  
Something Ive been keeping locked away  
Behind my lips  
I can feel it breaking free  
With each and every kiss  
I couldnt bear to hurt you  
But its all so different now  
Things that I was sure of then  
Now filled me up with doubt  
  
And I can feel you breathing  
And its keeping me awake  
Can you feel it beating  
My heart sinking like a wave  
  
I can feel you breathing  
Its keeping me awake  
Could you stop my heart  
Its always beating  
Sinking like a wave  
  
How am I suppose to feel about the things Ive done  
I dont know if I should stay or turn around and run  
I know that I hurt you  
Things will never be the same  
The only love I ever knew I threw it all away  
  
And I can feel you breathing  
And its keeping me awake  
Can you feel it beating  
My heart sinking like a wave  
  
I can feel you breathing  
Its keeping me awake  
Could you stop my heart  
Its always breathing  
Sinking like a wave
