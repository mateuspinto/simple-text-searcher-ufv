Well I wake up in the morning  
Look at my clock  
Its way past noon time  
Now Im late for work  
  
Tell me tell me  
What have I done wrong  
Aint nothing go right with me  
Must be Ive been smoking too long  
  
Well I go to find me some breakfast  
But I aint got no food  
Take me a shower  
But the water dont feel no good  
  
Tell me  
  
Ive got opium in my chimney  
No other life to choose  
Nightmare made of hash dreams  
Got the devil in my shoes  
  
Tell me  
  
Well when Im smoking  
Put my worries on a shelf  
Dont think about nothin  
Try not to see myself  
  
Tell me  
  
Well in this blues Im singin  
Theres a lesson to be learned  
Dont go around smokin  
Unless you want to get burned  
  
Tell me
