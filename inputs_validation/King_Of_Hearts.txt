She was just 19 but in here eyes she was old enough to know  
We were caught between two city streets like a bad dream  
We could barely survive in the world outside where the writins on the wall  
Still she lets me know we just cant let go and she takes my heart away  
  
When she tells me I want it I go crazy I need it  
When she touches I feel it right there in her eyes  
Im the King of Hearts livin in a fantasy  
The King of Hearts when shes layin next to me  
Shinin like a jewel tonight love is gonna rule tonight  
Yeah Im gonna be the only one to be King of Hearts  
  
Like a neon light the shadows flash across my empty room  
We could leave tonight and save ourselves from a bad scene  
When we walk on by with our heads up high all the faces turn our way  
Yeah its in their eyes and they realize we can make our getaway  
  
When she tells me I want it I go crazy I need it  
When she touches I feel it right there in her eyes  
Im the King of Hearts livin in a fantasy  
The King of Hearts when shes layin next to me  
Shinin like a jewel tonight love is gonna rule tonight  
Yeah Im gonna be the only one to be King of Hearts
