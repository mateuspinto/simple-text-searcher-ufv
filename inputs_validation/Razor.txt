Wake up its time  
We need to find a better place to hide  
Make up your mind  
I need to know I need to know tonight  
  
Sweet and divine  
Razor of mine  
Sweet and divine  
Razor blade shine  
  
Patience my dear  
We could spend a lifetime waiting here  
Maybe this time  
I hope I get the chance to say goodbye  
  
Sweet and divine  
Razor of mine  
Sweet and divine  
Razor of mine  
  
Day after day  
Cutting away  
Day after day  
But anyway  
  
Wake up its time  
We need to find a better place to hide  
Make up your mind  
I need to know I need to know tonight  
  
Sweet and divine  
Razor blade shine
