Tea time Monday night I was waiting  
passing time  
Then from the hallway I saw Mother  
in her nightgown  
Swaying up the stairs up the stairs it  
seemed so unreal  
I knew Grandma had sent THEM  
again the invisible friends  
  
A little later in the middle of tea we  
came close to ecstasy  
THEY were telling tales from  
beyond when Grandma rose  
  
She opened the door and there was  
Missy  
Seeing Mother in Grandmothers  
chair she went into tears  
  
Missy was screaming  
What have You done what have you  
done to My Ma crying louder now  
We better get rid of her Shes too  
young anyway it was Grandma who  
spoke  
  
Bye bye Missy be gone forever  
The beautiful fireplace in the kitchen  
will do  
  
I saw Missy struggling in Grandma  
wrinkled hands  
Oh No let me be Oh No Please No  
Grandma Please  
Aagh Grandma Youre hurting me  
Dont touch me or Ill break it Ive got  
the tea pot Ill do it anyway  
I saw liquid spreading the bloody tea  
all over the floor  
Now I heard THEIR voices some  
kind of demon growls  
DIE  SHE BROKE AMON  AMON  DIE  
  
THEY dropped THEIR tea cups  
Grandma stood still  
forced by invisible hands Missy went  
down the stairs  
As I waved her goodbye Missy was  
sobbing away  
  
Will I ever see her again Bye bye  
Missy dont be afraid
