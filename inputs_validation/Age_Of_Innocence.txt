I cant be compromising in my thoughts no more  
I cant prevent the times my anger fills my heart  
I cant be sympathizing with a new lost cause  
I feel Ive lost my patience with the world and all  
  
And all the politicians and their hollow promises  
And all the lies deceit and shame that goes with it  
The working man pays everything for their mistakes  
And with his life too if there was to be a war  
  
Chorus  
So we can only get one chance can we take it  
And we only got one life cant exchange it  
Can we hold on to what we have dont replace it  
The age of innocence is fading like an old dream  
  
A life of petty crime gets punished with a holiday  
The victims mind are scarred for life most everyday  
Assailants know just how much further they can go  
They know the laws are soft conviction chances low  
  
Chorus  
  
You cant protect yourselves even in your own home  
For fear of vigilante cries the victims wipe their eyes  
So now the criminal they launch right in our face  
Judicial system lets them do it a disgrace  
  
Despondent public worries where it will all end  
We cant protect ourselves our kids from the crime trend  
We cannot even warn each other of evil in our midst  
They have more rights than us you cannot call that just  
  
Chorus
