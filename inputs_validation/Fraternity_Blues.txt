I decided to improve my social station  
I joined a fraternity organisation  
Tucked in my shirt  
Signed on the line  
Right away they said about to improve my mind  
The car I drove  
The books I read  
The food I ate  
The booze I drank  
The girls I took out  
My breath  
  
Said Kid we dont much like the way you walk  
And you gonna have to change the way you talk  
They said your dress is kind of sludge  
And your attitude is mighty grudge  
Said you got to learn to bubble  
You got to bubble with enthusiasm I started bubble  
Most important thing you cant forget  
Is learning the entire Greek alphabet  
I never did really understand  
That thats gonna make me anymore a man  
But I learned it  
I can whip through that Sonofabeta backwards in five seconds  
Then they hit me with some pretty bad news  
Concerning the payment of monthly dues  
I never did know where that money went  
I never was sure it was well spent  
But I paid it  
Im no trouble causer and besides I figured thats life  
If you want good friends it gonna cost you  
  
Well finally got to be party time  
I got a great big old jug of wine  
I went back to the house in about an hour  
When the boys were drinking whiskey sours  
Brandy Alexanders  
Frozen daquires  
Reciting the Greek alphabet to one another  
  
I could see I was gonna have to do my very best  
To get myself out of that fraternity mess  
I stood right there outside the door  
And I chugged that wine like never before  
Walked inside and bubbled  
All over a couple of their dates  
  
So now everythings back to normal again  
But there is still lots of room for improvement my friend  
Cause that fraternity stuff is too much for me  
Next time Im gonna join a sorority  
Really get me something to bubble about
