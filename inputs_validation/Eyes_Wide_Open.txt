Here it comes here comes another day  
Another decision on the way  
Well here it comes here comes a covered display  
Of preferences to make  
Well here it comes here comes a knock on the door  
Open it for an opportunity  
Well here it comes here comes another day  
For memories to be made  
  
Eyes wide open  
Eyes wide open all the time  
  
n there it was it was a perfect take  
And were you asleep or awake  
There it was it was a perfect time  
To speak your mind  
n there it was it was a chance of a lifetime  
It flew right by and what did you do  
Well there it was it was another day  
For memories to be made  
  
Eyes wide open  
Eyes wide open all the time  
Ive got my eyes wide open  
Eyes wide open all the time  
Because you never know  
What you might see
