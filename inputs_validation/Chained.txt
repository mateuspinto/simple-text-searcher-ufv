Are Sambora  
  
Hey whats this feeling  
Ive never been down this far before  
I was scared of believing  
That love would never find my door  
I was chained  
Chained  
Chained to my broken dreams  
I never knew I was supposed to be  
Waiting for someone to come and rescue me  
Rescue me  
Rescue me  
Hey am I dreaming  
I never woke up from night before  
Unaware I was bleeding  
Slowly dying like the sun  
Going down once more  
I was chained  
Chained  
Chained to my broken dreams  
I never knew just where my life would lead  
Hoping that someone would come and rescue me  
Rescue me  
Rescue me  
Rescue me  
Alone in the darkness  
Til saw the light  
Shining from your eyes  
Now it burns inside and it keeps me alive  
Lord Ive been chained  
Ive been chained yeah  
Was chained  
Chained  
Chained to these broken dreams  
I never knew who supposed to be  
Hoping that someone would come and rescue me  
Ive been chained  
Chained  
Ive been chained to these broken dreams  
I never knew just where my life would lead  
Waiting for you to come and rescue me  
Hoping that someone would come and  
Rescue me  
Rescue me  
Rescue me  
Ooh yeah  
Rescue me
