I found her diary underneath a tree  
And started reading about me  
The words shes written took me by surpise  
Youd never read them in her eyes  
They said that she had found the love she waited for  
Wouldnt you know it she wouldnt show it  
  
When she confronted with the writing there  
Simply pretended not to care  
I passed it off as just in keeping with  
Her total disconcerting air  
And though she tried to hide  
The love that she denied  
Wouldnt you know it she wouldnt show it  
  
And as I go through my life I will give to her my wife  
All the sweet things that I can find  
  
I found her diary underneath a tree  
And started reading about me  
The words began stick and tears to flow  
Her meaning now was clear to see  
The love shed waited for was someone else not me  
Wouldnt you know it she wouldnt show it  
  
And as I go through my life I will wish for her his wife  
All the sweet things that she can find  
All the sweet things they can find
