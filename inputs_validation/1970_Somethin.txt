1970 Somethin nigga i dont sweat the date my moms was late  
So i had to plan my escape out the skins  
In this world the fly girls tangeray and hennesey  
Untill i call earl 10 months in this gut wut the fuck  
I wish moms would hurry up so i can get buck wild  
Juvenile with the mics n shit New York New York ready for the likes of this  
Then came the worst date May 21st 219 was when my moma water burst  
No spouse in the house so she rolled herself  
To the hospital to see if she could get a little help  
Umbilicle cords wrapped around my neck  
Im seein my death and i aint even took my first step  
I made it out im bringin mad joy  
The docter looked and said hes gonna be BAD BOY

I remmember back in time before all the homies died before all the dollars
and nines i knew that i was  
Goin somewhere let me take you back in time before i even got the rhyme
before i had nickels and  
Dimes i knew that i was goin somewhere

Would pac be alive if u let pac drive  
Swear to god to reverse it i give my left eye  
With the right i visualized the king of bedstuy  
Checkin his daughter tianna into junior high  
If i was in brooklyn and BI was still alivein 2006 it might sound like
this  
NY 718 212 with sues rendevouz  
Its like moulin rouge  
High fashion up town air force ones  
And vasquez puerto ricans with fat asses  
Lace dutch masters we dump ashes on models and S classes  
For you bastards catch a cab to manhattan  
With that broadway actin u hype that belly shit  
Would u get u capped and wrapped in plastic  
Tell the captain S Roge was happennin  
Out here nor speak no evil inside the magnum

Now im 13 smokin blunts makin green  
On the drug scene fuck the football team  
Risk it rupt ur spleens by the age of 16  
Hearin the coach scream make my lifetime dream  
I mean i wanna blow up stack my doe up  
So school i didnt show up and fucked my flow up  
Mom said that i should grow up and check myself  
Before i wreck myself disrespect myself  
Put the drugs on the shelf naww i couldnt see it  
Scarface king of New York i wanna be it  
Rap was secondary money was neccessary  
Untill i got encarcerated kinda scary  
See 74 march 8 set me straight not able to move behind a great steel gate  
Time to contemplate damn were did i fail  
All the money i stacked was all the money for bail
