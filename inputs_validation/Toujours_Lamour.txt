She took all the pleasure and none of the pain  
All of the credit and none of the blame  
I came home to an empty flat  
Shed left me a note and taken the cat  
  
The cord that they knotted to keep us apart  
Could never be broken it was tied to my heart  
She grew thin and I grew fat  
She left me and that was that  
  
Im thinking of renting a villa in France  
A French girl has offered to give me a chance  
Or maybe Ill take an excursion to Spain  
And buy a revolver and blow out my brains
