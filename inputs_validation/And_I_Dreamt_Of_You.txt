I see thy love in the distance  
Breathless gasping for air for in thy dreams you where  
Awakening to the bleakness in my room  
As my eyes begin to blear reality sets and starts the fear  
For do dreams come true or do I die alone  
Waiting like the petals of a wilting flower fall off  
Until there is non and the once beautiful flowers dies naked  
With no one to clothe it  
Will I hold you in the grave or will the grave hold me  
The numbing dreams never end the swallows wings still amongst  
The idle wind  
My colored world turns to grayscale  
Recollecting the memories eyes covered hazel  
Contradiction of thy thoughts standing calm love not lost  
Searching till I find my princess whose passionate eyes cut right through me  
For what is life if love only exists in thy thoughts  
What is romance if it is all fiction  
Nothing but a portrait left empty a passing cloud of hurt  
By to meet my love in the flesh is to find my whole heart  
Your heart breaks though me your love is the key  
Longing for my hearts door  
To what day till I see sunrays shine upon your face  
I dream of you the way you look  
The beating of love in your heart  
Your wolds are like the flowing of a spring knowing thy love  
Waits for me until eternitys end  
Is this poetry or is this loves sickness  
Engulfing my every being  
Take the heart from you and the blood ceases from me  
I see what you hear  
Breathe taking the closest thing to me and my savior  
Falling in love to a person I have never met but knowing she has salvations
fragrance  
By Gods grace this love will be free and able to fly away above  
The earth to a point of exhaustion  
But your breath will keep me alive  
Words are pointless for this love is speechless  
Preparing fro the curtains close  
Laying their clutching hands so tight I can feel your heart  
Telling me it will be all right  
Ascension to heaven wehre this love can not only walk  
But it runs through the endless fields of joy  
Where love neither ends nor begins but flows everlasting  
This was thy dream this daybreak and will by thy prayer  
That I will rest sleepless till the sun rises on that day  
And butterflies sing with us as we write love symphony  
The pages of life fill the story of our love in a time long ago  
Where fairy tales come true  
And you and I my love will live happily ever after  
I love you
