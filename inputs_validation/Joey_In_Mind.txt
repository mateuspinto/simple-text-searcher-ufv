When joey first came the light seemed to rise  
Thought it came in the night and left with her eyes  
And I wish that her face would return once again  
Just one day to remind me of saturdays gain  
  
As I sit in her city in fog and in steam  
Everythings blurred for blurred is my dream  
So Ill leave for my terrace and tea laced with rum  
And wait for the day when joey will come  
  
And come all the dreams that never did try  
To live on a memory or float on a sigh  
Together well sit in the saturday rain  
And dream of joey or mary jane
