Nighttime sharpens heightens each sensation  
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination  
Silently the senses abandon their defences  
Helpless to resist the notes I write  
For I compose the music of the night  
  
Slowly gently night unfurls its splendor  
Grasp it sense it tremulous and tender  
Hearing is believing music is deceiving  
Hard as lightening soft as candlelight  
Dare you trust the music of the night  
  
Close your eyes start a journey through a strange new world  
Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before  
Close your eyes and let music set you free  
Only then can you belong to me  
  
Floating floating falling falling sweet intoxication  
Touch me touch me trust me trust me savour each sensation  
Let the dream begin let your darker side give in  
To the power of the music of the night  
The power of the music of the night  
  
You alone can make my song take flight  
Help me make the music of the night
