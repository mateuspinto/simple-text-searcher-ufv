An American landed on Erins green isle  
He gazed at Killarney with rapturous smile  
How can I buy it he said to his guide  
Ill tell you how with a smile he replied  
  
How can you buy all the stars in the skies  
How can you buy two blue Irish eyes  
How can you purchase a fond mothers sighs  
How can you buy Killarney  
  
Nature bestowed all her gifts with a smile  
The emerald the shamrock the Blarney  
When you can buy all these wonderful things  
Then you can buy Killarney  
  
Nature bestowed all her gifts with a smile  
The emerald the shamrock the Blarney  
When you can buy all these wonderful things  
Then you can buy Killarney
