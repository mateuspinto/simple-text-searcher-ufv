In and out of darkness in and out of sleep  
Trying to keep my hands upon the wheel  
Never saw the corner in the driving rain  
I never saw her step into the street  
  
Dreaming while you sleep  
Dreaming while you sleep  
Memories to keep  
Dreaming while you sleep  
  
I can never understand what went through my mind  
I didnt stop to see what I had done  
I had to keep on driving deep into the night  
The miles between would somehow put it right  
  
Dreaming while you sleep  
Dreaming while you sleep  
Memories to keep  
Dreaming while you sleep  
  
All my life you lie silently there  
All my life in a world so unfair  
All my life and only Ill know why  
And it will live inside of me  
I will never be free all my life  
Trapped in her memory all my life  
Till the day that you open your eyes  
Please open your eyes  
  
Dreaming while you sleep  
Dreaming while you sleep  
  
Heard it on the radio saw it on TV  
But could I take my secret to the grave  
If I had another chance would I do the same  
  
Dreaming while you sleep  
Dreaming while you sleep  
Dreaming while you sleep  
Are you dreaming while you sleep   
  
All my life Ill be haunted by  
All my life just one moment in time  
All my life until the day I die  
And it will live inside of me  
I will never be free all my life  
Trapped in her memory all my life  
Till the day that you open your eyes  
  
All of my life you lie silently there  
All my life in a world so unfair  
All my life and only I know why  
And it will live inside of me  
I will never be free all my live  
Trapped in her memory all my life  
Till the day that you open your eyes
