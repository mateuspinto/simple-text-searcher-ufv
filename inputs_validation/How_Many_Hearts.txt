How many hearts  
Does it take to break  
All of the bonds  
That young lovers make  
Hoping to find  
The next golden egg  
One that will shine  
Through the rest of time  
  
How many roads  
Must there need to be  
Hoping inside  
You could mean to me  
Open your mouth  
Build your sermon there  
Give me more time  
Do the best I can  
  
Hopelessly hoping our plan will wake up  
Hoping it all will be fine  
Holding our candles through weather or not  
Love be the enemy now  
Now for the rest of time  
  
A long time ago  
There was only me  
And there was no  
Rings eternally  
Wont be the same  
No one there to blame  
No longer care  
  
And you are and you are a new age  
  
Hopelessly hoping our plan will wake up  
Hoping it all will be fine  
Holding our candles through weather or not  
Love be the enemy now  
Now for the rest of time  
  
And you are and you are a new age
