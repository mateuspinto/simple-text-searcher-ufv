If you could feel what I could feel  
Well then youd know His love is real  
If you could hear what I could hear  
Well then youd know the King is near  
  
The resurrection is here to stay  
And Hes coming back again  
The resurrection is here to stay  
And Hes coming back again  
To reclaim all His souls and set us free  
The resurrection is here to say  
That Hes coming back again  
  
Look what Hes done to me  
Now I am living in another space and time  
He walked on the righteous path  
To keep us from Satans wrath  
We are not alone  
And were going home  
  
The resurrection is here to say  
That Hes coming back again  
To reclaim all His souls and set us free  
The resurrection is here to say  
  
That He is coming back again  
To reclaim all His souls and set us free  
The resurrection is here to say  
That Hes coming back again  
  
To reclaim all His souls reclaim all His souls  
Reclaim all His souls reclaim all His souls Repeat x 3
