Fish that dont drown  
Life in a bubble jungle  
I wouldnt frown  
Not short another chuckle  
Snake in the ground  
But I was in there for you  
Now leaving town  
Life in a bubble jungle  
  
Seeing you believing  
Us adhering  
Were the power struck  
  
Believing then kneeling  
Appeasing  
The power struggle  
  
Were left with no arms  
Right in the power struggle  
Were left with no arms  
Right in the power struggle  
  
Wearing a crown  
Life in a bubble jungle  
Chasing a clown  
Not short another chuckle  
Snake in the ground  
But I was waiting for you  
Now we have found  
Life in a bubble jungle  
  
Seeing you believing  
Us adhering  
Were the power struck  
  
Believing then keeling  
Appeasing  
The power struggle  
  
Were left with no arms  
Right in the power struggle  
Were left with no arms  
Right in the power struggle  
Left with no arms  
In the power struggle  
Left with no arms  
In the power struggle  
  
May I remind you  
May I remind you  
May I remind you  
  
May I remind you  
May I remind you  
May I remind you  
  
May I remind you  
May I remind you  
May I remind you  
May I remind you  
May I remind you  
May I remind you  
Your life is in a bubble jungle  
  
Seeing you believing  
Us adhering  
Were the power struck  
Believing then keeling  
Appeasing  
The power struggle  
  
Were left with no arms  
Right in the power struggle  
Were left with no arms  
Right in the power struggle  
Left with no arms  
In the power struggle  
Left with no arms  
Right here in the power struggle
