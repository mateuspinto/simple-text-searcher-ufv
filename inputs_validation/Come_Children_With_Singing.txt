Come children with singing with sweet voices ringing  
Come kneel to the Babe that in Bethlehem lies  
While angels achoir with pinions of fire  
Are filling with music the listening skies  
  
Repeat the dear story how veiling His glory  
The Hope of the Ages came down to the earth  
Oh worship Him lowly the lofty and holy  
Our Star of the Morning shone out at His birth  
  
See Mary enfold Him while shepherds behold Him  
And sages are bent at His beautiful feet  
Come haste to adore Him and bowing before Him  
The Lord who redeems you in reverence greet  
  
This wonderful Stranger His couch is a manger  
His cradle is made with the cattle in stall  
Yet God of creation in blest incarnation  
He stoops to our nature to ransom us all
