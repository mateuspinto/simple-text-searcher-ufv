If you see her and she mentions my name  
Tell her the times have but I have not changed  
All my friends know that I still feel the same  
If you see her and she mentions my name  
  
If you see her ask her for me  
If the dreamer in her ever set her free  
Does she know now what the words I sing mean  
If you see her would you ask her for me  
  
Chorus  
Everything I told her then was true  
Everything was true at the time  
But time has a way of changing everything  
The truth has a way of changing all the time  
  
If you see her and she mentions my name  
Tell her for me that she was not to blame  
Theres no reason now for her to feel ashamed  
If you see her and she mentions my name  
  
Chorus  
  
If you see her and she mentions my name  
Tell her the times have but I have not changed  
All my friends know that I still feel the same  
If you see her and she mentions my name
