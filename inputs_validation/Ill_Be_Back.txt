You know if you break my heart Ill go  
But Ill be back again  
Cause I told you once before goodbye  
But I came back again  
  
I love you so oh  
Im the one who wants you  
Yes Im the one who wants you  
Oh ho oh ho oh  
  
You could find better things to do  
Than to break my heart again  
This time I will try to show that Im  
Not trying to pretend  
  
I thought that you would realize  
That if I run away from you  
That you would want me to  
But I got a big surprise  
Oh ho oh ho oh  
  
You could find better things to do  
Than to break my heart again  
This time I will try to show that Im  
Not trying to pretend  
  
I want to go  
But I hate to leave you  
You know I hate to leave you  
Oh ho oh ho  
  
You if you break my heart Ill go  
But Ill be back again
