Please dont tear this world asunder  
Please take back  
This fear were under  
I demand a better future  
  
Or I might just stop wanting you  
I might just stop wanting you  
Please make sure we get tomorrow  
All this pain and all the sorrow  
  
I demand a better future  
Or I might just stop needing you  
I might just stop needing you  
Give my children sunny smile  
  
Give them moon and cloudless sky  
I demand a better future  
Or I might just stop loving you  
Loving you loving you  
  
When we talk we talk to you  
When we walk we walk to you  
From factory to field  
How many tears must fall  
  
Down there below  
Nothing is moving  
Oh  
I might just stop wanting you  
  
I might just stop needing you  
I might just stop loving you  
I demand a better future  
I demand a better future  
  
I demand a better future  
For I might just stop loving you  
Loving you loving you  
I demand a better future  
  
I demand a better future  
I demand a better future  
For I might just stop loving you loving you loving you  
I demand a better future
