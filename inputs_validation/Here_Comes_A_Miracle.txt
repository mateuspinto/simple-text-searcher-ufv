Here Comes A Miracle  
Words and Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
They followed Him on dusty roads  
Wherever He would lead  
Multitudes would gather  
As He healed each disease  
With eyes of wonder they would watch  
As He would stop to pray  
And when He spoke the word of faith  
You could hear them say  
Chorus  
Here comes a miracle  
Here comes a miracle  
Cant you feel it in the air  
That look is on His face  
His glory is in this place  
And I know a miracle is near  
The lame could walk  
The deaf could hear  
Blinded eyes could see  
And those who had been  
Bound for years  
Were suddenly set free  
They came in desperation  
The hurting and the poor  
But when they saw Him  
Through the crowd  
They knew what was in store  
Chorus  
And still today we follow Him  
We claim His Word is true  
And nothing is impossible  
What He says He will do  
And though this world may doubt us  
And though they laugh and stare  
Someday all men will see the Truth  
When we see Him in the air  
Chorus  
Here comes a miracle
