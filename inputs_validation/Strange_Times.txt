Long time ago  
Back in the mist of time  
Back when the crystal waters flowed  
There was a world  
So strange and so beautiful  
All life would flourish and would grow  
Years went by time just fell away  
Love was worshiped like the sun  
But as we arrive at the house  
Of the water sign  
Were living in strange times  
Strange times  
Strange times  
What do we need  
What do we hunger for  
Who holds the secrets who will know  
Temples of greed  
In ruins on the river bed  
Wastelands that lived before the snow  
Time stands still  
As we race through the universe  
On our way to the sun  
And as we arrive at the house  
Of the water sign  
Were living in strange times  
Strange times  
Strange times  
Its you and I forever  
We wont be afraid  
Even if the stars are falling down  
Down down down down  
Falling down  
Time stands still  
As we race through the universe  
On our way to the sun  
And as we arrive at the house  
Of the water sign  
Were living in strange times  
Strange times strange times  
Strange times strange times  
Strange times strange times  
Strange times strange times  
Strange times strange times  
Strange times strange times
