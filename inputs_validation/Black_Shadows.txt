The night is dark the wind is high  
Now the Black Shadows come creeping by  
Making a strange dreadful moaning cry  
Ooooooo Ooooooo  
Ooooooo Ooooooo  
Ooooooo  
  
A witch perhaps will pull your hair  
Maybe a ghost will give you a scare  
But of the Shadows you must beware  
Ooooooo Ooooooo  
Ooooooo Ooooooo  
Ooooooo  
  
A JackoLantern stares at you  
Around the corner you hear a Boo  
Will those Black Shadows come after you  
Ooooooo Ooooooo  
Ooooooo Ooooooo  
Ooooooo  
  
Now if a Shadow deep and black  
Should try to grab you and then attack  
You must run quickly and dont look back  
Ooooooo Ooooooo  
Ooooooo Ooooooo  
Ooooooo  
  
The night is dark the wind is high  
Now the Black Shadows come creeping by  
Making a strange dreadful moaning cry  
Ooooooo Ooooooo  
Ooooooo Ooooooo  
Boooooo
