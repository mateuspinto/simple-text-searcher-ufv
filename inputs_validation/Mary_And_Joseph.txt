Mary was the first of three  
Long black hair and sugar sweet  
Daddys eyes and Mommas crooked smile  
  
She was barely seventeen  
Got a job keepin dishes clean  
Planned to stay in this city for a while  
For a while  
  
Joseph ran a lumber yard  
About a mile from Olive park  
Quiet boy he never had much to say  
  
It was love right from the start  
He bought a ring and won Marys heart  
Had hopes for a home and kids someday  
Kids someday  
  
The angel scared her half to death  
She wouldve screamed but she lost her breath  
On a midnight there in the middle of May  
  
He said Oh Mary dont be afraid  
Youll bear a son that the Lord has made  
Name him Jesus Hell light the way  
  
She packed the clothes he made the plans  
They had to go to Bethlehem  
But there was nowhere left to stay  
  
So in a barn she gave birth  
To the King of Kings the Lord of Earth  
Just a little bitty thing sleeping on the hay  
Sleeping on the hay  
  
The storys too long to tell  
But He walked on water and lived through hell  
Killed on a cross and rose from the grave  
  
We got a King they got a Son  
Mary and Joseph were the only ones  
There on that very first Christmas day  
There on that very first Christmas day
