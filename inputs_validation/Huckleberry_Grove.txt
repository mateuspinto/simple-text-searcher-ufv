Shirley was a lady whose teeth were made of gold  
She danced before the music and everything it told  
  
Huckleberry Grove  
Where the music plays into tomorrow night  
Huckleberry Grove  
Only fools would need to argue or to fight  
  
Shirley had eight children and each of them were told  
You got joy for singing burning in your soul  
  
Huckleberry Grove  
Where the idiots cant ease you of your mind  
Huckleberry Grove  
Take a free train leave your luggage far behind  
  
Oh she sings shangrila  
Oh she sings shangrila  
  
Shirley was a lady who mostly stayed at home  
But she went out dancing down Huckleberry Grove  
  
Huckleberry Grove  
Where the music plays into tomorrow night  
Huckleberry Grove  
Youll be groovin on the best days of your life  
Huckleberry Grove  
Where the musics guaranteed to blow your mind  
Huckleberry Grove  
Leave your luggage get a free train get behind  
  
Oh she sings shangrila  
Oh she sings shangrila
