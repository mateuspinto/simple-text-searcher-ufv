Roxanne you dont have to put on the red light  
Those days are over  
You dont have to sell your body to the night  
Roxanne you dont have to wear that dress tonight  
Walk the streets for money  
You dont care if its wrong or if its right  
  
Roxanne you dont have to put on the red light  
Roxanne you dont have to put on the red light  
Put on the red light put on the red light  
Put on the red light put on the red light  
Put on the red light oh  
  
I loved you since I knew ya  
I wouldnt talk down to ya  
I have to tell you just how I feel  
I wont share you with another boy  
I know my mind is made up  
So put away your make up  
Told you once I wont tell you again its a bad way  
  
Roxanne you dont have to put on the red light  
Roxanne you dont have to put on the red light  
You dont have to put on the red light  
Put on the red light put on the red light
