So the sun shines on his funeral  
Just the same as on a birth  
The way it shines on everything  
That happens here on Earth  
It rolls across the western sky  
And back into the sea  
And spends the days last rays upon  
This fuckedup family so long old pal  
  
The last time I saw Alice  
She was leaving Santa Fe  
With a bunch of roundeyed Buddhists  
In a killer Chevrolet  
Said they turned her out of Texas yeah  
She burned them down back home  
Now shes wild with expectation  
On the edge of the unknown  
  
Singing oh its enough to be on your way  
Its enough just to cover ground  
Its enough to be moving on  
Home build it behind your eyes  
Carry it in your heart  
Safe among your own  
  
They brought her back on a Friday night  
Same day I was born  
We sent her up the smokestack yes  
And back into the storm  
She blew up over the San Juan Mountains  
She spent herself at last  
The threat of heavy weather  
That was what she knew best  
  
Oh its enough to be on your way  
Its enough to cover ground  
Its enough to be moving on  
Home build it behind your eyes  
Carry it in your heart  
Safe among your own  
  
It woke me up on a Sunday  
An hour before the sun  
It had me watching the headlights  
Out on highway 591  
Till I stepped into my trousers  
Till I pulled my big boots on  
I walked out on the Mesa  
And I stumbled on this song  
  
Oh its enough to be on your way  
Its enough just to cover ground  
Its enough to be moving on  
Home build it behind your eyes  
Carry it in your heart  
Safe among your own  
So long old gal
