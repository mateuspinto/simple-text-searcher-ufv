The way out  
Is the way in  
The way out  
Is the way in  
  
Out of touch  
With the weather and the wind direction  
With the sunrise  
And the phases of the moon  
Out of touch  
With life in the land of the loving  
With the living night  
And the darkness at high noon  
  
You can never break the chain  
There is never love without pain  
A gentle hand a secret touch on the heart  
  
Out of sync  
With the rhythm of my own reactions  
With the things that last  
And the things that come apart  
Out of sync  
With love in the land of the living  
A gentle hand a secret touch on the heart  
  
A healing hand a secret touch on the heart  
  
There is never love without pain  
Life is a power that remains
