People are strange when youre a stranger  
Faces look ugly when youre alone  
Women seem wicked when youre unwanted  
Streets are uneven when youre down  
When youre strange  
Faces come out of the rain  
When youre strange  
No one remembers your name  
When youre strange  
When youre strange  
When youre strange  
People are strange when youre a stranger  
Faces look ugly when youre alone  
Women seem wicked when youre unwanted  
Streets are uneven when youre down  
When youre strange  
Faces come out of the rain  
When youre strange  
No one remembers your name  
When youre strange  
When youre strange  
When youre strange  
When youre strange  
Faces come out of the rain  
When youre strange  
No one remembers your name  
When youre strange  
When youre strange  
When youre strange
