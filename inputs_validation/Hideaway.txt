You know I gotta go  
Got to find a place  
Get away  
From the human race  
  
Find a place where the air is clear  
On a sunny day sunny day  
I got to find  
A Hideaway hideaway  
  
Hideaway  
Hideaway  
Hideaway  
Hideaway  
  
You know I gotta leave  
Got to find a place any place  
Get away  
From the city pace city pace  
  
I gotta go out where the air is fresh and clear  
On a sunny day sunny day  
And I got to find  
A hideway yeah yeah
