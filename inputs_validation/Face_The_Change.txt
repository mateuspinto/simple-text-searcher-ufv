Turns back to front turns hate to love  
The simple things that mean a lot  
Turns rock to sand turns ice to snow  
Thats you and me about to grow  
  
Chorus  
Change the face of a magazine  
Face the change of a million years  
Stare in shock at what you saw  
Take a breath and lock the door  
Tell your children what to do  
Mistakes and all they still love you  
Change the pace of a magazine  
Face the change of a million years  
  
Turns rough to smooth turns dont to do  
To reminisce turns me to you  
Turns war to peace turns greed to need  
The consequence of visionaries  
  
Chorus  
  
Turns back to front turns hate to love  
The simple things that mean a lot  
Turns rock to sand turns ice to snow  
Thats you and me about to grow  
  
Chorus
