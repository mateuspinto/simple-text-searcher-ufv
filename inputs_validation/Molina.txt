Chorus  
Moli I I I na where you goin to   
Moli I I I na where you goin to   
  
Shes daughter to the mayor  
Messin with the sheriff  
Drivin in a blue car  
She dont see no red light  
  
Chorus  
  
Shes comin in the mornin  
Lookin a disaster  
Drivin in the prowl car  
Spent the night in jail  
  
Chorus  
  
Sheriff gonna go far  
Drivin to the state house  
If she makes a million  
Papa can retire  
  
Chorus  
  
repeat to fade
