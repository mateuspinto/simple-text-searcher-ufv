Go away from my world  
Let me dream alone  
And you see it never worked from the start  
All I got for all of my love was a broken heart  
Go away from my world  
And let me dream alone  
Ill dry my eyes and comb my hair  
And Ill pretend youre never there  
Now youre gone the breezes blow so sadly  
You never could understand the love I wanted so badly  
Go away from my world  
And let me walk all alone  
All alone in my room  
All alone and so sad  
I can dream of how I wanted us to be  
Dreams I have the kind I knew could ever be  
Go away from my world
