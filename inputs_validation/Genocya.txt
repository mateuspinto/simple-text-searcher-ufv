Im your destructive pride  
Your homegrown goddamn genocide  
The standard behind which you hide  
Im at your door right by your side so  
  
Go high  
Go higher  
Go high  
Go higher  
  
Im the hate the jealousy  
I can magnify the agony  
The selfdestructive qualities  
So wont you come and go with me and  
  
Go high  
Go higher  
Go high  
Go higher  
  
My lack of tolerance nice as you please  
My interference put them down at their knees  
  
I am your hopeless despondent  
Your derelict hole  
I am your genocide  
The mass inflicted cyanide  
  
I am your illness your ailment  
The hole in your soul  
I am your genocide  
The mass inflicted cyanide  
  
My lack of tolerance nice as you please  
My interference put them down at their knees  
  
I am your hopeless despondent  
Your derelict hole  
I am your genocide  
The mass inflicted cyanide  
  
I am your illness the ailment  
The hole in your soul  
I am your genocide  
The mass inflicted cyanide  
  
Go high  
Go higher  
Go high  
Go higher  
Go high  
Go higher  
Go high  
Go higher
