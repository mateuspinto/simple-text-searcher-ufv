Claustrophobic  
Crawl out of this skin  
Hard explosive  
Reaching for that pin  
  
Feel thy name extermination  
Desecrating hail of fire  
  
So we cross that line  
Into the crypt  
Total eclipse  
Suffer unto my apocalypse  
  
Deadly vision  
Prophecy revealed  
Death magnetic  
Pulling closer still  
  
Feel thy name annihilation  
Desolating hail of fire  
  
So we cross that line  
Into the crypt  
Total eclipse  
Suffer unto my apocalypse  
  
My apocalypse go  
  
Crushing metal ripping skin  
Tossing body mannequin  
Spilling blood bleeding gas  
  
Mangle flesh snapping spine  
Dripping bloody valentine  
Shattered face spitting glass  
  
Split apart  
Split apart  
Split apart  
Split  
Spit it out  
  
What makes me drift a litter bit closer  
Dead man takes the steering wheel  
What makes me know its time to cross over  
Words you repeat until I feel  
  
See through the skin the bones they all rattle  
Future and past they disagree  
Flesh falls away the bones they all shatter  
I start to see the end in me  
  
See the end in me  
  
Claustrophobic  
Climb out of this skin  
Hard explosive  
Waiting for that pin  
  
Violate annihilate  
A loser to my eyes  
Obliterate exterminate  
At last accept deny  
  
Feel thy name as hell awakens  
Destiny inhale the fire  
  
But we cross that line  
Into the crypt  
Total eclipse  
Suffer unto my apocalypse  
  
Tyrants awaken my apocalypse  
Demon awaken my apocalypse  
Heaven awaken my apocalypse  
Suffer forever my apocalypse
