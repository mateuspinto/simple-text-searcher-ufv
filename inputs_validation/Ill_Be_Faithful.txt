I would be your water when your thirsty mouth was dry  
I would be your sunshine when clouds are in the sky  
I would stand that close beside you  
And be your only friend  
And I have promised love forever  
There will be no end  
  
Ooh hoo Ill be faithful  
Ooh hoo Ill be true too  
Ooh hoo Ill be faithful yes I will now  
Ooh hoo oh my true to you  
  
Now I would be your music if you would like a song  
I would sleep beside you when the winters cold and long  
I would be the pole to guide you never would I bend  
And I have promised love forever  
There will be no end  
  
Ooh hoo Ill be faithful oh yeah  
Ooh hoo Ill be true too mmm  
Ooh hoo Ill be faithful oh yeah  
Ooh hoo oh my true to you ooh hoo  
  
I have promised love forever  
There will be no end  
  
Ooh hoo Ill be faithful oh yeah  
Ooh hoo Ill be true too  
Ooh hoo Ill be faithful yes I will  
Ooh hoo oh my true to you
