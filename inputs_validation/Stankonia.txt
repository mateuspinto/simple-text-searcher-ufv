intro  
What does love look like  
Love looks like you  
What does love love feel like  
Love feels like this  
What does love smell like  
Love smells like us  
  
andre 3000  
You make me understand  
What it means to be in love once again  
Why must we fly so low  
Are we fraid of heights do kites get lost in the tow  
  
chorus  
Stank love stank love stank love stank love  
  
sleepy brown  
Let me show your mind a new freaky side of love  
Open up you flower please let me taste your love  
Honeysuckle sweet cant stop till I get ever drip drop on my tongue  
Hitting every spot of you what you gonna do  
Your body is the rhythm of the boom in the room  
Up and down it seems to go  
Oh my god I think Im bout to explode  
  
Chorus  
  
big rube  
My fingertips scan flesh so supple  
No longer a couple like two in one skin  
Where do you end and where do I begin  
Both brains become one mind sensually  
Every nerve becoming its own individual entity  
With its own lusts its own needs to serve  
Longing for the love of all the other nevers  
As they writhe and twist in satisfaction  
In the burning chill of please we bathe  
Engulfing encompassing like a cataclysmic shockwave  
Of an impact so deep but not one of destruction  
But of creation elation in the remaking  
No taking in the relation no taking in the relation  
Just giving of ther persona making lover after making love  
Till aint nothing but stankonia  
  
Chorus
