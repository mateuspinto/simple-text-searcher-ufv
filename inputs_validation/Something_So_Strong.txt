Love can make you weep it can make you run for cover  
Roots that spread so deep bring life to frozen ground  
  
Something so strong could carry us away  
Something so strong could carry us today  
  
Turning in my sleep love can leave you cold  
The taste of jealousy is like a lust for gold  
  
Something so strong could carry us away  
Something so strong could carry us today  
  
Ive been feeling so much older  
Frame me and hang me on the wall  
Ive seen you fall into the same trap  
This thing is happening to us all  
  
Something so strong could carry us away  
Something so strong could carry us today  
  
Something so strong  
Something so strong  
Something so strong  
Something something so strong
