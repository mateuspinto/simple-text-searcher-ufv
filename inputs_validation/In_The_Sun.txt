I picture you in the sun  
Wondering what went wrong  
And falling down on your knees  
Asking for sympathy  
And being caught in between  
All you wish for and all you seem  
And trying to find anything  
You can feel that you can believe in  
  
May gods love be with you  always Repeat x1  
  
I know I would apologize  
If I could see your eyes  
cause when you showed me myself you know  
I became someone else  
But I was caught in between  
All you wish for and all you need  
I picture you fast asleep  
A nightmare comes  
You cant keep awake  
  
May gods love be with you always Repeat x3  
May gods love be with you  
  
Cause if I find  if I find my own way  
How much will I find if I find if I find my own way Repeat x2  
How much will I find Repeat x2  
You yeah you  
Ill find you you you oh Repeat x3  
  
Oh I dont know anymore  
What its for  
Im not even sure  
If there is anyone  
Who is in the sun  
Will you help me to understand  
cause Ive been caught in between  
All I wish for and all I seem  
Or maybe youre not even sure  
What its for  
Anymore than me  
  
May gods love be with you  
Always  
May gods love be with you Repeat x1  
Be with you
