I can remember when this was the future  
Where it was gonna be at back then  
Why dont we turn the whole bloody lot down  
And make a new start all over again  
  
I can recall Utopian thinking  
Bold mission statements and tightening of belts  
Demolition of familiar landmarks  
Promises made and deals that were dealt  
  
This used to be the future  
Where it was at back then  
Lets turn the whole bloody lot down  
And start all over again  
  
But that future was exciting  
Science fiction made fact  
Now all we have to look forward to  
Is a sort of suicide pact  
  
Was it the dear old future  
That created the problems we face  
How do we deal with the fallout  
Of the age we used to call space  
  
I can remember planning for leisure  
Living in peace and freedom from fear  
Science that promised to make us a new world  
Religion and prejudice disappear  
  
I can remember when this was the future  
Where it was gonna be at back then  
Now religion and nuclear energy have united  
To threaten oh God Amen  
  
This used to be the future  
Where it was at back then  
Now religion and nuclear energy have united  
Oh God Amen  
  
Was it the dear old future  
That created the problems we face  
How do we deal with the fallout  
Of the age we used to call space  
  
This used to be the future  
Where it was at back then  
Lets turn the whole bloody lot down  
And start all over again  
  
Amen
