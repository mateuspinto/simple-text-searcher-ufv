Chorus  
How long how long  
How wide how wide  
Is the love of Christ  
How deep how deep  
How high how high  
Is the love of Christ  
  
It would take ten thousand lifetimes  
To comprehend a love with no beginning  
A love that knows no end  
  
Chorus  
  
More than any heart could measure or ever hold  
His love could fill the oceans  
Til they overflowed  
  
Chorus  
  
Higher than the mountains  
Deeper than the ocean  
Farther than the reach of the sky  
Wider than the heavens  
Longer than forever  
Greater is the love of Christ  
  
Chorus
