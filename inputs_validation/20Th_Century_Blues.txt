Why is it that civilized humanity  
Can make the world so wrong   
In this hurlyburly of insanity  
Our dreams cannot last long  
  
Weve reached a deadline  
A press headline  
Every sorrow  
Blues value  
Is news value  
Tomorrow  
  
Blues  
Twentieth century blues  
Are getting me down  
Blues  
Escape those weary  
Twentieth century blues  
  
Why  
If theres a God in the sky  
Why shouldnt He grin  
High  
Above this dreary  
Twentieth century din   
  
In this strange illusion  
Chaos and confusion  
People seem to lose their way  
What is there to strive for  
Love or keep alive for  
Say Hey hey  
Call it a day   
  
Blues  
Nothing to win or to lose  
Its getting me down  
Blues  
Escape those weary  
Twentieth century blues  
  
Weve reached a deadline  
A press headline  
Every sorrow  
Blues value  
Is news value  
Tomorrow  
  
Blues  
Nothing to win or to lose  
Its getting me down  
Blues  
Escape those dreary  
Twentieth century  
Blues
