There once was a note pure and easy  
Playing so free like a breath rippling by  
The note is eternal I hear it it sees me  
Forever we blend it forever we die  
  
I listened and I heard music in a word  
And words when you played your guitar  
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering  
And a child flew past me riding in a star  
  
As people assemble  
Civilization is trying to find a new way to die  
But killing is really merely scene changer  
All men are bored with other mens lies  
  
I listened and I heard music in a word  
And words when you played your guitar  
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering  
And a child flew past me riding in a star  
  
Gas on the hillside oil in the teacup  
Watch all the chords of life lose their joy  
Distortion becomes somehow pure in its wildness  
The note that began all can also destroy  
  
We all know success when we all find our own dreams  
And our love is enough to knock down any walls  
And the futures been seen as men try to realize  
The simple secret of the note in us all  
  
I listened and I heard music in a word  
And words when you played your guitar  
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering  
And a child flew past me riding in a star  
  
There once was a note pure and easy  
Playing so free like a breath rippling by  
  
There once was a note listen x 18
