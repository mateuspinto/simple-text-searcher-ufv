Until All Have Been Served  
Words by Ray Boltz Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
Brother and sisters sharing communion  
Holding the bread of life in their hands  
In just a few hours theyd be going home  
Serving the Lord in faraway lands  
When someone said  
Has everyone been served  
This is what was heard  
Chorus  
No no not everyone has been served  
No no we need to  
Take them to his word  
How can they know him  
When theyve never heard  
No no not everyone has been served  
With tears in their eyes  
They prayed for the cities  
Where millions of people suffer each day  
They live and they die  
Never knowing why  
No one is there to show them the way  
And the Father says  
Has everyone been served  
For so long He has heard  
Chorus repeat  
We are the light and we know the truth  
Can we forget what were called to do  
No no not until all have been served  
No no we need to  
Take them to his word  
In every nation let this cry be heard  
No no not until all have been served  
No no not until all have been served  
No no we need to  
Take them to his word  
In every nation let this cry be heard  
No no not until all have been served
