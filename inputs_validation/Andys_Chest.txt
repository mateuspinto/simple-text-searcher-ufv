If I could be anything in the world that flew  
I would be a bat and come swooping after you  
And if the last time you were here things were a bit askew  
Well you know what happens after dark  
When rattlesnakes loose their skins and their hearts  
And all the missionaries loose their bark  
All the trees are calling after you  
And all the venom snipers after you  
Are all the mountains boulder after you  
  
If I could be anything of the things in this world that bite  
Instead of being a tethered ocelot on a leash  
Id rather be your kite  
And be tied to the end of your string  
And flying in the air babe at night  
Because you know what they say about honey bears  
When you shave off all their baby hair  
Youve got a hairy minded big bare bear  
And all the bells are rolling out for you  
And stones are all erupting out for you  
And all the cheap bloodsuckers are flying after you  
  
Yesterday Daisy Mae and Biff were grooving down the street  
And just like in a movie her hands became her feet  
Her belly button was her mouth  
Which meant she tasted what shed speak  
But the funny thing is what happened to her nose  
It grew until it reached all of her toes  
Now when people say her feet smell they mean her nose  
And curtains laced with diamonds dear for you  
And kingdoms Christian sailors soldiers dear for you  
And melting ice cap mountains dear for you  
And knights in flaming silver robes for you  
And bats that with a kiss turn prince for you  
Swoop swoop oh baby rock rock
