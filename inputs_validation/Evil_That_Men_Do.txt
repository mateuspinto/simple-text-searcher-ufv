You asked I came so behold the Queen  
Lets add a little sense to the scene  
Im living positive not out here knocked up  
But the lines are so dangerous I ought to be locked up  
  
This rhyme doesnt require prime time  
Im just sharing thoughts of mine  
Back again cause I knew you wanted it  
From the Latifah with the Queen in front of it  
  
Dropping bombs youre up in arms youre puzzled  
The lines will flow like fluid while you guzzle  
The sip I drop you on a BDPproduced track  
From KRS to be exact  
  
Its a Flavor Unit quest that today has me speaking  
Cause its knowledge Im seeking  
Enough about myself I think its time that I tell you  
About the evil that men do  
  
Situations reality what a concept  
Nothing ever seems to stay in step  
So today here is a message to my sisters and brothers  
Here are some things I want to cover  
  
A woman strives for a better life but who the hell cares  
Because shes living on welfare  
The government cant come up with a decent housing plan  
So shes in no mans land  
Its a sucker who tells you youre equal  
  
KRSOne You dont need him Johannasburgs crying for freedom  
  
Queen Latifah We the people hold these truths to be selfevident  
  
KRSOne  
But theres no response from the president  
  
Queen Latifah  
Someones living the good life taxfree  
Except for a girl cant find a way to be crack free  
And thats just part of the message  
I thought I had to send you about the evil that men do  
  
Tell me dont you think its a shame  
When someone can put a quarter in a video game  
But when a homeless person approaches you on the street  
You cant treat him the same  
  
Its time to teach the def the dumb the blind  
That blackonblack crime only shackles and binds  
You to a doom a fate worse than death  
But theres still time left  
  
Stop putting your conscience on cease  
And bring about some type of peace  
Not only in your heart but also in your mind  
It will benefit all mankind  
Then there will be one thing that will never stop  
And its the evil that men do
