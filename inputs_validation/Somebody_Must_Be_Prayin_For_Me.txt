She left Oklahoma for California  
Sunglasses on the brim of her hat  
Smoke was pourin from that old Cadillac  
But she wasnt turnin back  
Just outside of Blackstaff  
Motor blew on her Coupe Deville  
Just in time she saw a sign  
There was a Texaco waitin at the bottom of the hill  
  
And she said somebody must be prayin for me  
Somebody out there must be prayin for me  
Must be angels I cant see  
Somebody must be prayin for me yeah  
  
A boy bout twenty climbed out of a truck  
All covered in grease and dirt  
She said Hey Charles but he just laughed  
And said Im wearin my daddys shirt  
He stood there lost in her eyes  
And she got lost in his  
As the years roll by she would sigh  
Every time they kiss  
  
And shed say somebody must be prayin for me  
Somebody out there must be prayin for me  
Must be angels I cant see  
Somebody must be prayin for me  
  
Sometimes she stares out the window  
And wonders about her Hollywood dreams  
But when she tucks her kids in bed  
She softly whispers as they fall asleep  
  
Somebody must be prayin for me  
Somebody out there must be prayin for me  
Aint it funny how you always find  
Just what you need  
Somebody must be prayin for me  
Somebody must be prayin for me  
Prayin for me yeah
