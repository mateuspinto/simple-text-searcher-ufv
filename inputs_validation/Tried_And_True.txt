At the dawn I woke I was alone rising  
I called you on the force of time and space calling  
And as she came to me I fell back down realizing  
Oh that its cool for you to love me now Im everything  
  
Everything cause tried and true I see the light in you  
Oh han you dig in my soul could you smell my whole life  
  
You bent the edge eclipsed and turned around aligning  
And though the dark sparked rays of violet light blinding  
I went about the job of sowing thoughts and feelings  
Oh some were good some bad I felt the cries of healing  
  
Cause tried and true I see the light in you  
Oh can you dig in my soul could you smell my whole life  
  
Rise my Dawn youve been awake too long  
Let me rest in time while I blow your mind  
  
At the dawn I woke I was alone rising I got ya  
I called you on the force of time and space calling see them  
And as she came to me I fell back down realizing creation  
that its cool for you to love me now Im everything I am  
  
Everythingcause tried and true I see the light in you  
Can you dig in my soul could you smell my whole life
