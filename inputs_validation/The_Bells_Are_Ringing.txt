The Bells Are Ringing  
Words by Ray Boltz Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
The high priest would move  
Through the temple  
With bells around the bottom of his skirt  
And as he prepared an offering there  
The sound of the bells could be heard  
Now there in the Holy of Holies  
A sinful priest surely would die  
But the sound of the bells sent a message  
To all those who waited outside  
chorus  
The bells are ringing Hes alive  
Oh yes the sacrifice is worthy  
A sound that cannot be denied  
The price has been paid  
And as our hands are being raised  
Let His holy name be praised  
Tell every nation every tribe  
The bells are ringing Hes alive  
Now Jesus was born the Messiah  
A man sent to save other men  
And scripture proclaims  
He is the high priest  
Who offered Himself for our sins  
And cold was the tomb  
Where they laid Him  
And there only silence was found  
But on the third day  
The stone rolled away  
And the whole world  
Woke up to the sound  
chorus  
Open up your heart and listen  
Tell me what do you hear  
Its the sound of salvation  
Ringing Hes alive  
And theres no need to fear  
chorus repeat  
In every nation in every tribe  
The bells are ringing Hes alive
