Before you slip into unconsciousness  
Id like to have another kiss  
Another flashing chance at bliss  
Another kiss another kiss  
  
The days are bright and filled with pain  
Enclose me in your gentle rain  
The time you ran was too insane  
Well meet again well meet again  
  
Oh tell me where your freedom lies  
The streets are fields that never die  
Deliver me from reasons why  
Youd rather cry Id rather fly  
  
The crystal ship is being filled  
A thousand girls a thousand thrills  
A million ways to spend your time  
When we get back Ill drop a line
