My love the days are colder  
So let me take your hand  
And lead you through a snow white land  
Oh oh  
Oh oh  
  
My love the year is older  
So let me hold you tight  
And wile away this winter night  
Oh oh  
  
I see the firelight in your eyes  
Come kiss me now before it dies  
Well find a winter world of love  
Cause love is warmer in December  
My darlin stay here in my arms  
Till summer comes along  
And in our winter world of love  
You see we always will remember  
That as the snow lay on the ground  
We found our winter world of love  
  
Because the nights are longer  
Well have the time to say such tender things  
Before each day  
Oh oh  
Oh oh  
  
And then when love is stronger  
Perhaps youll give your heart  
And promise that well never part oh no  
  
And at the end of every year  
Ill be so glad to have you near  
Well find a winter world of love  
Cause love is warmer in December  
My darlin stay here in my arms  
Till summer comes along  
And in our winter world of love  
You see we always will remember  
That as the snow lay on the ground  
We found our winter world of love
