Grooving around in a trench coat  
With the satin on trail  
Seems to be all around in tin and lead pail we pale  
Jiving on down to the beach  
To see the blue and the gray  
Seems to be all and its rosyits a beautiful day  
  
Will you please keep on the track  
cause I almost want you back  
cause I know what you are  
You are a gigolo aunt youre a gigolo aunt  
Yes I know what you are  
You are a gigolo aunt youre a gigolo aunt  
  
Heading down with the light the dust in your way  
She was angrier than than her watershell male  
Life to this love to me  heading me down to me  
Thunderbird shale  
Seems to be all and its rosy  its a beautiful day  
Will you please keep on the track  
cause I almost want you back  
cause I know what you are  
You are a gigolo aunt  
  
Grooving on down in a knapsack superlative day  
Some wish she move and just as she can move jiving away  
She made the scene should have beensuperlative day  
Everythings all and its rosy its a beautiful day  
Will you please keep on the track  
cause I almost want you back  
cause I know what you are  
You are a gigolo aunt
