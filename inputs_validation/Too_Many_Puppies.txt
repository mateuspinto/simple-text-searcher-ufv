Too many puppies are being shot in the dark  
Too many puppies are trained not to bark  
At the sight of blood that must be spilled so that we may maintain  
Our oil fields  
Too many puppies  
Too many puppies  
Too many puppies are taught to heal  
Too many puppies are trained to kill  
On the command of men wearing money belts that buy mistresses  
Sleek animal pelts  
Too many puppies  
Too many puppies  
Too many puppies  
Too many puppies  
Too many puppies with guns in their hands  
Too many puppies in foreign lands  
Are dressed up sharp in suits of green and placed upon the war machine  
Too many puppies are just like me  
Too many puppies are afraid to see  
The visions of the past brought to life again  
Too many puppies too many dead men
