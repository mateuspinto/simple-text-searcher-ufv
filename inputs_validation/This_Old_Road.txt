Look at that old photograph  
Is it really you  
Smiling like a baby full of dreams  
Smiling aint so easy now  
Some are coming true  
Nothings simple as it seems  
  
But I guess you count your blessings with the problems  
That youre dealing with today  
Like the changing of the seasons  
Aint you come a long way Aint you come a long way  
Aint you come a long way down  
This old road  
  
Looking at a looking glass  
Running out of time  
On a face you used to know  
Traces of a future lost  
In between the lines  
One more rainbow for the road  
  
Thinking of the faces in the windows  
That you passed along the way  
Or the last thing you believed in  
Aint you come long way Aint you come a long way  
Aint you come a long way down  
This old road  
  
Say you tried to chase the sun down  
And you let it slip away  
And the holy night is falling  
Aint you come long way Aint you come a long way  
Aint you come a long way down  
This old road  
  
Look at that old photograph  
Is it really you
