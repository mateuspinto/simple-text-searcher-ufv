Youre here  
In my heart  
Youre the light  
That guides me through the dark  
  
You walk beside me  
The night seems cold  
Each time I fall  
Your arms are there to hold  
  
Chorus  
You walk beside me  
Giving strength Ive never known  
I am not alone  
You walk beside me  
  
Youre here  
In my mind  
I talk to you  
And all my fears unwind  
I know Im loved for who I am  
You make me wanna be the best I can  
  
Chorus  
  
And I rely on your patience  
When I face the unknown  
And because of you  
I am not alone  
  
In the sun in the rain  
Through the good times and the pain  
I reach out for your hand  
I know that you understand  
  
Chorus
