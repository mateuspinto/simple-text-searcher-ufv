On to the lands we must go to warn all  
Said the Snake to the Eagle and the Lion  
Beg them to repent so they might be saved  
From the fury and the anger that shall claim them  
  
And so they set sail across the land ans seas alike  
In a quest to avoid the setting of the sun  
  
Gods rage is true  
He urges you  
To awake   
  
Thou has stolen betrayed  
And worshiped pagan gods  
Thou must awake thy lost faith to be saved  
  
And so spoke the propets  
As the mob has gathered round  
They said their empire would soon crumble  
And fall down  
  
Thou art our our brothers hear our call this day  
We come not to see your end  
But to revive we pray  
  
Gods rage is true  
He urges you  
To awake   
  
Where did these three come from  
Asked the crowd anxiously  
Furious and confused at the same time  
Surely these people are lying or jesting  
Either way they are here to cause harm   
  
You just be on your way said the mob as a  
Warning or else all hell will break loose  
Its all a matter of choice said the Eagle  
Though they really didnt  
Have much to chooseFrom
