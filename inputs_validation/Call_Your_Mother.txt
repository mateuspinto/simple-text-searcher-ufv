When you get a chance  
Would you please call your mother  
And thank her for the good years that we had  
Gently break the news that you dont love me  
And give my best regards to your good old dad  
  
I always liked your family  
We got along just splendidly  
Though your brother  
Kind of rubbed me the wrong way  
I remember that your eyes turned green  
When they crowned your sister County Queen  
Though she couldnt hold a candle  
To your beauty any day  
  
When you get a chance  
Would you please call your mother  
And thank her for the good years that we had  
Gently break the news that you dont love me  
And give my best regards to your good old dad  
  
Back when we could laugh and play  
On family reunion day  
Didnt we all look funny  
In our 1950s clothes  
Your daddy wore that greasy stuff  
Your brother drank more than enough  
Your mom wore penny loafers  
With runners in her hose  
  
When you get a chance  
Would you please call your mother  
And thank her for the good years that we had  
O gently break the news that you dont love me  
And give my best regards to your good old dad  
  
When you get a chance  
Would you please call your mother  
And give my best regards to your good old dad
