Hey now take a mip mack mop and a brim bram broom  
And klim klam clean up the rim ram room  
Cause your bim bam babys coming home tonight  
Get my slim slam slippers and my easy chair  
  
Run you flim flam fingers through my greasy hair  
Then kiss me baby let me hold you tight  
Been north and south and east and west  
But even a honey bee needs some rest  
  
When I get my jacket and my trousers pressed  
Ill follow the swallow right back to my nest  
Dont you wim wam worry if my train is late  
On the shim sham shuttle on a frim fram freight  
  
Cause your bim bam baby is coming home tonight
