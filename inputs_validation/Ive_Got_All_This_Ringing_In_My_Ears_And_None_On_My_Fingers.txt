Youre a canary  
Im a coal mine  
Cause sorrow is just all the rage  
Take one for the team  
You all know what I mean  
  
And Im so sorry  
But not really  
Tell the boys where to find my body  
New York eyes  
Chicago thighs  
Pushed up the window to kiss you off  
  
The truth hurts worse than anything I could bring myself to do to you  
The truth hurts worse than anything I could bring myself to do to you  
  
Do you remember the way I held your hand  
Under the lamp post and ran home this way  
So many times I can close my eyes  
  
The truth hurts worse than anything I could bring myself to do to you  
The truth hurts worse than anything I could bring myself to do to you  
  
The truth hurts worse than anything I could bring myself to do  
The truth hurts worse than anything I could bring myself to do to you  
The truth  
The truth
