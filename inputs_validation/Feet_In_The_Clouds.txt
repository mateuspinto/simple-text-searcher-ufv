Teacher said I had my head in the clouds  
They directed I suspected disconnected hat in my way  
  
On the street I had my feet on the ground  
Stood corrected well protected resurrected had it my way  
  
Ive got my feet in the clouds got my head on the ground  
I know that Im not a square as long as their not around  
But I find it very very very very very very hard  
Yes I find it very very very very very very hard  
  
Love is fab its like a stab in the heart  
My hidden treasure made to measure for my pleasure I had it my way  
  
Ive got my feet in the clouds got my head on the ground  
I know that Im not a square as long as their not around  
But I find it very very very very very very hard  
Oh I find it very very very very very very hard  
Yes I find it very very very very very very hard  
  
Ive got my feet in the clouds got my head on the ground  
I know that Im not a square as long as their not around  
But I find it so hard I find it so hard
