Oh my baby hold me there is only you and me  
Oh I cannot wait forever  no I cannot wait forever  
Tell me theres a heaven and there is a destiny  
Oh I cannot wait forever  so I cannot wait forever  
I will tell you baby oh my love is real  
Cant you feel it lady  feeling what I feel  
  
I will follow you  oh every time and every minute  
I will follow you  see my love is true  
I will follow you  every time and every minute  
All I want to do  is making love to you  
  
Theres no me without you why an angel breaks my heart  
Oh I cannot wait forever  no I cannot wait forever  
Please send me a rainbow and well try a brand new start  
Oh I cannot wait forever  so I cannot wait forever  
And beyond my tears girl  I will see your smile  
Baby I cant wait  or wait a while  
  
I will follow you
