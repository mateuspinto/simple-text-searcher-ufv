I was a fool for what I thought was love  
And I tried my best to keep up what we had  
We had a vision no I had a vision  
And now Ive to see that the vision is dead  
One of us is winterhearted  
One of us is cold as ice  
One of us is breaking hearts  
And its not me not me  
One of us is winterhearted  
One of us is cold as ice  
One of us is breaking hearts  
Its not me not me  
I was romantic so silly and blind  
I told the world that true love had a name  
But all that is left now  
Is pity and shame  
One of us is winterhearted  
One of us is cold as ice  
One of us is breaking hearts  
Its not me not me  
One of us is winterhearted  
One of us is cold as ice  
One of us is breaking hearts  
Its not me not me  
One of us is winterhearted  
One of us is cold as ice  
One of us is breaking hearts  
And its not me not me  
One of us is winterhearted  
One of us is cold as ice  
One of us is breaking hearts  
Its not me not me  
One of us is winterhearted  
One of us is cold as ice  
One of us is breaking hearts  
Its not me not me
