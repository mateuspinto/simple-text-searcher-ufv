Oh cherry  
I found you wanting  
Like everyone  
Always trying  
Happy lying  
cause Im no stranger  
To the ways of the world  
I felt like crying  
I felt like dying  
We took a coffee  
You took it so strong  
Shaded from the neon  
I could still see your eyes  
  
Oh cherry  
Oh cherry baby  
Oh cherry  
Oh cherry baby  
Oh cherry  
Oh cherry baby  
Oh cherry  
Oh cherry baby  
  
Found in the gutter  
With a knife in her back  
Letter said sorry  
Please dont worry  
  
She had a lover  
With danger in his eyes  
I tried to tell her  
But she had the wildest heart
