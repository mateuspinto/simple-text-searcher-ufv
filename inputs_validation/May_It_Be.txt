May it be an evening star  
Shines down upon you  
May it be when darkness falls  
Your heart will be true  
You walk a lonely road  
Oh How far you are from home  
  
Mornie utulie Darkness has come  
Believe and you will find your way  
Mornie alantie Darkness has fallen  
A promise lives within you now  
  
May it be the shadows call  
Will fly away  
May it be your journey on  
To light the day  
When the night is overcome  
You may rise to find the sun  
  
Mornie utulie Darkness has come  
Believe and you will find your way  
Mornie alantie Darkness has fallen  
A promise lives within you now  
  
A promise lives within you now
