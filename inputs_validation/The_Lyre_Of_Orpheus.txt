Orpheus sat gloomy in his garden shed  
Wondering what to do  
With a lump of wood a piece of wire  
And a little pot of glue  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
He sawed at the wood with half a heart  
And glued it top to bottom  
He strung a wire in between  
He was feeling something rotten  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
Orpheus looked at his instrument  
And he gave the wire a pluck  
He heard a sound so beautiful  
He gasped and said O my God  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
He rushed inside to tell his wife  
He went racing down the halls  
Eurydice was still asleep in bed  
Like a sack of cannonballs  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
Look what Ive made cried Orpheus  
And he plucked a gentle note  
Eurydices eyes popped from their sockets  
And her tongue burst through her throat  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
O God what have I done he said  
As her blood pooled in the sheets  
But in his heart he felt a bliss  
With which nothing could compete  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
Orpheus went leaping through the fields  
Strumming as hard as he did please  
Birdies detonated in the sky  
Bunnies dashed their brains out on the trees  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
Orpheus strummed till his fingers bled  
He hit a G minor 7  
He woke up God from a deep deep sleep  
God was a major player in heaven  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
God picked up a giant hammer  
And He threw it with an thunderous yell  
It smashed down hard on Orpheus head  
And knocked him down a well  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
The well went down very deep  
Very deep went down the well  
The well went down so very deep  
Well the well went down to hell  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
Poor Orpheus woke up with a start  
All amongst the rotting dead  
His lyre tacked safe under his arm  
His brains all down his head  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
Eurydice appeared brindled in blood  
And she said to Orpheus  
If you play that fucking thing down here  
Ill stick it up your orifice  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
This lyre lark is for the birds said Orpheus  
Its enough to send you bats  
Lets stay down here Eurydice dear  
And well have a bunch of screaming brats  
O Mamma O Mamma  
  
Orpheus picked up his lyre for the last time  
He was on a real low down bummer  
And stared deep into the abyss and said  
This one is for Mamma  
  
O Mamma O Mamma  
O Mamma O Mamma
