You are my autoharp  
I push every button on your body  
I push the a minor the e flat the f major  
And especially the see sharp seven  
You are my autoharp  
I play every string in your mind  
And even when I play them very loud  
They keep in tune  
But how will they sound soon  
You are my autoharp  
I bought you in a pawnshop in Virginia  
You were cheap but in good condition  
Longing for someone to take you on an exotic trip  
You are my autoharp  
I carried you all over the world  
In my hard case called the heart  
Youre the reason for my blood to keep running  
Through my veins every album again
