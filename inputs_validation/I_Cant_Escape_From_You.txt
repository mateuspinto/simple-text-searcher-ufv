Ive tried and tried to run and hide  
To find a life thats new  
But where I go I always know  
I cant escape from you  
  
A jug of wine to numb my mind  
But what good does it do  
The jug runs dry and still I cry  
I cant escape from you  
  
These wasted tears are souvenirs  
Of a love I thought was true  
Your memory is chained to me  
I cant escape from you  
  
There is no end I cant pretend  
That dreams will soon come true  
A slave too long to a heart of stone  
I cant escape from you
