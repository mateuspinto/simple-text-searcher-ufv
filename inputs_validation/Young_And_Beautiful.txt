Ive seen the world done it all  
Had my cake now  
Diamonds brilliant in BelAir now  
Hot summer nights mid July  
When you and I were forever wild  
The crazy days city lights  
The way youd play with me like a child  
  
Will you still love me  
When Im no longer young and beautiful  
Will you still love me  
When Ive got nothing but my aching soul  
I know you will I know you will  
I know that you will  
Will you still love me when Im no longer beautiful  
  
Ive seen the world lit it up  
As my stage now  
Changeling angels in a new age now  
Hot summer days rock n roll  
The way you play for me at your show  
And all the ways I got to know  
Your pretty face and electric soul  
  
Will you still love me  
When Im no longer young and beautiful  
Will you still love me  
When Ive got nothing but my aching soul  
I know you will I know you will  
I know that you will  
Will you still love me when Im no longer beautiful  
  
Dear lord when I get to heaven  
Please let me bring my man  
When he comes tell me that youll let him  
Father tell me if you can  
All that grace all that body  
All that face makes me wanna party  
Hes my sun he makes me shine like diamonds  
  
Will you still love me  
When Im no longer young and beautiful  
Will you still love me  
When Ive got nothing but my aching soul  
I know you will I know you will  
I know that you will  
Will you still love me when Im no longer beautiful  
Will you still love me when Im no longer beautiful  
Will you still love me when Im not young and beautiful
