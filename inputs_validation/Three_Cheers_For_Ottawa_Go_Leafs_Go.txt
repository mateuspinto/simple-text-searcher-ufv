Heres a little story  
about a hockey team  
who may just win the stanley cup  
but only in there dreams  
The team is from ottawa  
the senators is there name  
soon to be inducted in the golfing hall of fame  
they say theyll beat our leafers  
HA now theres a funny joke  
cause every year at playoff time  
the senators always choke  
  
So 3 cheers for ottawa  
a real team they are nottawa  
they can give all that they gottawa  
but the stanley cup will never go to Ottawa  
  
Ottawa has their Parlament  
and MPs in the news  
and its kinda like their hockey team  
they talk a lot but dont produce  
there not the brightest either  
I really have to say  
when the capital of our country  
spells Canada with a K hey thats kanada  
  
Oh 3 cheers for Ottawa  
they think they got a shottawa  
they must be smokin pottawa  
cuz the stanley cup will never go 2 ottawa  
  
u better press your flood pants  
its that time once again  
2 here that familar ottawa senators saying  
T off is at 10  
so get ready for the crying  
take out your hankerchief  
youre about to get your ass kicked  
by the toronto maple leafs  
  
Oooh 3 cheers 4 ottawa  
a lesson theyll be taughtawa  
Hossa and Havlattawa  
youll soon be golfing alotawa  
  
What the hell else rhymes with Ottawa  
not a whole heck of alotawa  
there the team we already forgotawa  
cuz the Stanley cup will never go to Ottawaaaaaaaa
