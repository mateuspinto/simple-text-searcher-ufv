Maybe different but remember  
Winters warm where you and I  
Kissing whiskey by the fire  
With the snow outside  
And when the summer comes  
In the river  
Swims at midnight  
Shiver cold  
Touch the bottom  
Starry night  
With muddy toes  
  
Stay or leave  
I want you not to go  
But you should  
It was good as good goes  
Stay or leave  
I want you not to go  
But you did  
  
Wake up naked drinking coffee  
Making plans to change the world  
While the world is changing us  
It was good good love  
You used to laugh under the covers  
Maybe not so often now  
But the way I used to laugh with you  
Was loud and hard  
  
Stay or leave  
I want you not to go  
But you should  
It was good as good goes  
Stay or leave  
I want you not to go  
But you did  
  
So what to do  
With the rest of the days afternoon hey  
Isnt it strange how we change  
Everything we did  
Did I do all that I should  
  
That I coulda done  
Remember we used to dance  
And everyone wanted to be  
You and me  
I want to be too  
What day is this  
Besides the day you left me  
What day is this  
Besides the day you went  
  
So what to do  
With the rest of the days afternoon hey  
Well isnt it strange how we change  
Everything we did  
Did I do all that I could  
  
Remember we used to dance  
And everyone wanted to be you and me  
I want to be too  
What day is this  
Besides the day you went babe  
What day is this
