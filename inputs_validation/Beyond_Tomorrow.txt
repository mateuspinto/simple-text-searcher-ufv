In the waking spring  
Softly you would bring  
Your eager dreams to my bed  
All through the joys of summer  
Love became the harvest  
We would share  
  
Beyond tomorrow  
Like golden sunrise  
Our love is the dawn of forever  
  
Beyond tomorrow  
The gift of lovers  
Waits bright and free  
For you and me  
My love  
  
When the birds have flown  
And we stood alone  
Against the chill of the sky  
Slowly the birth of courage  
Brought us love we knew  
Would never die
