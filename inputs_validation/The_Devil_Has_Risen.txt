Hell strikes on solid ground  
Give us the strength to hold our home  
Open the wrath again  
Withstood the fight before  
Been told to leave it all  
Go where I do not know  
We will stare down the eyes of fire  
  
Like stone we battled the winds  
Beat down and strangled the rains  
We stood to fight till the end  
But mother has breached our defense  
  
Keep rising  
The devil is rising  
We lost it all  
The devil is rising  
  
It only took five days for the man to come for me  
I know our faith is strong and belief is all we need  
It was those lonely nights that tried our hearts  
It was those lonely nights that tore us apart  
  
And then our faith grew dim  
It was our solemn sin  
  
Forsaken in the eyes of fire  
We lost it allin the eyes of fire
