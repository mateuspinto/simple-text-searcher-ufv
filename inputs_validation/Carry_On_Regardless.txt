Carry on regardless in spite of the music business scam  
Carry on regardless in spite of all the petty minded little women and men  
Carry on regardless when everybody dont give a damn  
  
Carry on and start all over again in spite of all the TV trash  
Carry on regardless in spite of all the media rehash  
And the white wash the brain wash and all the white trash  
  
Carry on regardless baby baby baby baby baby baby when your on a roll  
Carry on regardless just to satisfy your soul  
  
Carry on up the Khyber carry on carry on Dick  
Carry on up the Khyber Pass wont you carry on carry on Dick  
Carry on you got to make it last  
Carry on you gotta make it stick  
  
Carry on baby when when youre on a roll  
Carry on baby baby baby baby baby  
Got to satisfy your soul  
  
Carry on up the Khyber Pass carry on doctor carry on nurse  
Carry on regardless carry on doctor carry on nurse  
Carry on till you get what your after  
Carry on till it cant get much worse  
  
Carry on regardless  
Carry on up carry on up carry on up  
Carry on up carry on up carry on up  
Carry on do the dog carry on do the crazy pup alright  
Carry on forever  
Carry on until you make it stick
