Who can blame you though your hearts untrue  
When you say its my fault anyway  
You turn your head from the tears Ive shed  
Though your heart is untrue who can blame you  
You justify yourself in your love for someone else  
When you say I never loved you anyway  
Your vows were made in vain although my love still remains  
Though you broke my heart in two who can blame you  
Who can blame you though your hearts untrue  
When you say its my fault anyway  
You turn your head from the tears Ive shed  
Though your heart is untrue who can blame you  
In a heart of rusty steel you kept your love affair concealed  
Til the day she was asking you to stay  
You turned your head from the tears Ive shed  
Though you broke a heart in two who can blame you  
Who can blame you though your hearts untrue  
When you say its my fault anyway  
You turn your head from the tears Ive shed  
Though your heart is untrue who can blame you  
Who can blame you though your hearts untrue  
When you say its my fault anyway  
You turn your head from the tears Ive shed  
Though your heart is untrue who can blame you  
You turn your head from the tears Ive shed  
Though your heart is untrue who can blame you
