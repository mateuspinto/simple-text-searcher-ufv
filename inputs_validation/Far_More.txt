Mansions hill and acres  
Women drinks and caterers  
I would toast until the break of dawn  
Swimming pools and strippers  
Conversation six figures  
Never crossed my mind to call home  
  
Chorus  
Theres a note on the bathroom mirror  
Telling me that youve had enough  
  
It took you leaving me  
For my blind eyes to see that you mean  
  
Repeat x8  
Far more  
  
Than this planet to me  
Than the air I breath  
From here to overseas  
Girl youre all I need  
Than the mountains and trees  
You mean more than the birds and the bees  
Honey take it from me  
You are all I need  
  
Hanging out with friends  
Never calling to check in  
Neglecting you in every way  
Taking the home front for granted  
What was straight is now slanted  
And I dont know what to do about this letter  
  
Chorus  
  
It took you leaving me  
For my blind eyes to see that you mean  
  
Repeat x8  
Far More  
  
More than this planet to me  
More than the air I breath  
From here to overseas  
Girl youre all I need  
Than the mountains and trees  
You mean more than the birds and the bees  
Honey take it from me  
You are all I need  
  
Repeat x8  
Far more  
  
Ever since youve been gone  
I realize girl just what it is I had at home  
Oh Baby you mean far more  
Than this planet to me  
Than this air I breath  
Nothing can compare to your love for me  
To your love for me  
To your love for me  
To your love for me
