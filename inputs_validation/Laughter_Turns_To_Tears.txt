Makeup on your shoulder silence in the air  
Tonight those telltale signs are everywhere  
As you lay beside her talkin in your dreams  
The game is up and laughter turns to tears  
  
Every time you phone her with a dumb excuse  
She starts to think that shes outgrown her use  
Youll be home by midnight workin late it seems  
The penny drops and laughter turns to tears  
  
Do you think shes crazy  
Dont you think she knows  
Do you think shes taken in  
Dont you think it shows  
  
When laughter turns to tears  
Laughter turns to tears  
  
You can send her roses say shes lookin great  
You can talk of love but it may be too late  
You may think shes jokin as her laughter teems  
But with tears  
And laughter turns to screams  
  
Now it wont be easy  
Finding words to say  
How you really feel inside  
You take the game away  
  
When laughter turns to tears  
Laughter turns to tears  
  
One day its gonna shake you up  
Take you by surprise  
Someday its gonna wake you up  
Tears in your eyes  
  
When laughter turns to tears  
Laughter turns to tears  
Laughter turns to tears
