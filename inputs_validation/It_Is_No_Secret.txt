Chorus  
It is no secret what god can do  
What hes done for others hell do for you  
With arms wide open hell pardon you  
It is no secret what god can do  
  
The chimes of time ring out the news  
Another day is through  
Someone slipped and fell  
Was that someone you  
You may have longed for added strength  
Your courage to renew  
Do not be disheartened  
For I bring hope to you  
  
Chorus  
  
There is no night for in his light  
You never walk alone  
Always feel at home  
Wherever you may go  
There is no power can conquer you  
While god is on your side  
Take him at his promise  
Dont run away and hide  
  
Chorus
