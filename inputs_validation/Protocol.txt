Who are these ones who would lead us now  
To the sound of a thousand guns  
Whod storm the gates of hell itself  
To the tune of a single drum  
  
Where are the girls of the neighborhood bars  
Whose loves were lost at sea  
In the hills of France and on German soil  
From Saigon to Wounded Knee  
  
Who come from long lines of soldiers  
Whose duty was fulfilled  
In the words of a warriors will  
And protocol  
  
Where are the boys in their coats of blue  
Who flew when their eyes were blind  
Was God in town for the Roman games  
Was he there when the deals were signed  
  
Who are the kings in their coats of mail  
Who road by the cross to die  
Did they all go down into worthiness  
Is it wrong for a king to cry  
And who are these ones who would have us now  
Whose presence in concealed  
Whose nature is revealed  
In a time bomb  
  
Last of all you old sea dogs  
Who travel after whale  
Youd storm the gates of hell itself  
For the taste of a mermaids tail  
Who come from long lines of skippers  
Whose duty was fulfilled  
In the words of a warriors will  
And protocol
