A night to remember  
You changed all my life  
And we reached the sky  
Maybe I should run and hide  
And forget the time we had  
But how can I just forget  
That we ever met before  
Im gonna move any mountains  
If you want me to do  
Im gonna prove I can move any mountains  
As long as I am with you  
  
We shared a night to remember  
And we reached the sky  
Just a night to remember  
Ive got you and you changed all my life  
You changed all my life  
  
I know what I have been through  
What I felt so deep inside  
So real it is destiny  
To be with you every night  
Im gonna move any mountains  
If you want me to do  
Im gonna prove I can move any mountains  
As long as I am with you  
  
We shared a night to remember  
And we reached the sky  
Just a night to remember  
Ive got you and you changed all my life  
You changed all my life  
  
I found the love of my lifetime  
We shared a night to remember  
We reached the sky
