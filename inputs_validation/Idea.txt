I been thinking sitting on a pole  
Im getting sick of doing what Im told  
Just me and the mirror and my brain  
But that was when I got an idea  
Came like a gun and shot in my ear  
Dont you think its time you got up and stood alone  
  
Fifteen years I lay down on the ground  
I couldnt feel any noise or hear any sound  
Fifteen million years I spent down the line  
But that was when I got an idea  
Came like a gun and shot in my ear  
Dont you think its time you got up and stood alone  
Get up and stand alone  
  
That was when I got an idea  
Came like a gun and shot in my ear  
Dont you think its time you got up and stood alone  
Get up and stand alone  
  
Thats when I got an idea Repeat x2
