Color me once color me twice  
Everything gonna turn out nice  
Everlasting arms you gotta  
Keep me from these false alarms  
Alarm alarm I see you sad  
Maybe I see you Im glad  
Maybe maybe the fire of her desire  
Patience patience said the man  
Patience patience I cant understand  
Patience like a man and a wife I got patience  
On my neck like a cold cold knife  
I say Jack be nimble Jack fall dead  
Jack bend over and give Jilly head  
Oh you gotta help my body heal my soul  
Dead men working a sinner a saint  
Mixing up a pail of paint  
Painted the house black as night  
When the sun came up the house was white  
Gotta go on gotta go on  
We gotta go on you gotta go on  
You gotta go on go on go on  
Try and live life like I couldnt
