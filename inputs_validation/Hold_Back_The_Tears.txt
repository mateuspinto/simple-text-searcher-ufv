Hello my old friend  
Its good to see you smiling  
Youve been around so long you must be strong  
And single life really has its fine points  
Like friends to help you out when things go wrong  
  
Hold back the tears  
That youve been cryin  
Push off the fears  
When they come around  
  
Hold back the tears  
And keep on trying  
Just around the next corner  
May be waiting your true love  
  
Two lying fools  
And then four cryin eyes  
Counting on one another to survive  
Crazy love must surely have this pain  
If getting up means going down again  
  
Hold back the tears  
That youve been cryin  
Push off the fears  
When they come around  
  
Hold back the tears  
And keep on trying  
Just around the next corner  
May be waiting your true love
