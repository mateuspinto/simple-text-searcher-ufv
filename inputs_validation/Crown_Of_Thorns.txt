Youve always shared the light  
Although you could clearly see the sacrifice  
Preaching wrong from right  
Prosecution was the story of your life  
The blood money paid  
A kiss betrayed  
To be crucified  
And for thirty silver pieces  
For our sins he died  
To wear the crown of thorns  
It was his destiny  
And now the curtain is drawn  
And I can see the moment of some kind of truth  
They nailed you to the cross  
Although you walked the righteous path since your birth  
The blood money paid  
A kiss betrayed  
In this final hour  
To be crucified  
And for thirty silver pieces  
For our sins he died  
To wear the crown of thorns  
It was his destiny  
guitar solo  
To be crucified  
And for thirty silver pieces  
For our sins he died  
To wear the crown of thorns  
It was his destiny  
To be crucified  
It was his destiny
