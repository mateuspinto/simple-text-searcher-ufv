She sits alone  
In the abandont corner of her room oh her room  
Lost her life her lovely past ooo ooo ooo ooo  
She used to love feel and have compation  
But now Her life has lead nowhere nowherehold 4 count  
Chorus  
She feels attached  
And cant come loose  
Like strings holding on  
She cant let go  
She begs and pleads  
As she tries to relase  
And falls to her knees hold 4 counts  
  
Whats holding her back  
No one has know  
Maybe her shadow  
The shadow of doom  
She is miserable each day each week  
While tears begin to run down her cheeks  
Hoping for her day to come hold 4 counts  
For her to pry loose  
The day has not begun o when  
Chorus  
She feels attached  
And cant come loose  
Like strings holding on  
She cant let go  
She begs and pleads  
As she tries to relase  
And falls to her kneeeees  
Oh Oh hold last oh 4 counts  
  
Stings Strings  
They hold her back  
No one has notcied  
Or cared  
No one knows  
Whats she is really like  
Deep down inside  
Oh Whats there to hide  
  
She is nervous frightened scared and weak  
She must peer or peak from that  
Corner of the room  
Open her eyes and face doom hold doom 4 counts  
  
Slower  
Maybe she has maybe she did  
She woke up one day and saw the light  
Her love and compasion had all faded away  
As she ran through her shadow and began to  
Beg and plead as she fell to her knees and finally  
She broke loose
