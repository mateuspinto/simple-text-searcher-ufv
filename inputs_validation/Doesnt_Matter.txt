Procrastination the small conversation  
The tensions beginning to build up inside  
No one elses point of view  
Has ever been to what you think is right  
thats why no body is your friend  
But theyll always become  
One someday as she follows me  
Is now business that you run  
wondering what went wrong  
Wondering just how long the road ahead will be  
Joy has compromised  
Dying on the Is crossing the ts  
one out of one  
Its a relization of peoples reflection  
Of what you believe  
anyone who now looks back  
Be ready to die  
The fought will change  
so please dont get me wrong  
We share our common goals  
Inside of me sees how you are  
So go one with the show  
wondering what went wrong  
Wondering just how long the road ahead will be  
Joy has compromised  
Dying on the Is crossing the ts  
see where it gets us  
Well see where we hang out  
But nothing can keep me from this way  
Look at the sins and banged up poverty  
Like which you remain in  
I wont buy what your selling  
I feel my eye repairing  
Always makes a chance  
To be seen
