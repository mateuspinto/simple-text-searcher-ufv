In a weapons producing nation under Jesus  
In the fabled crucible of the free world  
Camera crews search for clues amid the detritus  
And entertainment shapes the land  
The way the hammer shapes the hand  
  
Gleaming faces in the checkout counter at the Church of Fame  
The lucky winners cheer Casino Nation  
All those not on TV only have themselves to blame  
And dont quite seem to understand  
The way the hammer shapes the hand  
  
Out beyond the ethernet the spectrum spreads  
DC to daylight the cowboy mogul rides  
Never worry where the gold for all this glorys gonna come from  
Get along dogies its coming out of your hides  
  
The intentional cultivation of a criminal class  
The future lit by brightly burning bridges  
Justice fully clothed to hide the heart of glass  
That shatters in a thousand Ruby Ridges  
And everywhere the good prepare for perpetual war  
And let their weapons shape the plan  
The way the hammer shapes the hand
