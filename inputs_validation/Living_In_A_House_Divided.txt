Look at us the picture of happiness  
Not so long ago Ah not so very long ago  
The pride of all our friends  
The perfect couple were we  
Is this how it will end  
Just a sad sad story  
  
Chorus  
Living in a house divided  
With a love thats so onesided  
Theres no chance at all  
The walls have got to fall  
Tumbling down  
  
Look at us the King and Queen of emptiness  
Living inside our castle of loneliness  
Unable to make amends  
Such perfect strangers are we  
Is this how it will end  
Just a sad story  
  
Chorus
