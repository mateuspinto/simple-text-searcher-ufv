When my baby moved out and the blues moved in  
There wasnt nothin I could do  
But mosey around with my head in my hands  
Lord what am I comin to  
I just keep moanin  
Moaoanin the blues  
  
I wrote a nice long letter  
Sayin mama please come home  
Your dadaddy is lononesome  
And all I am do is moan  
I been lovin that gal for so doggone long  
I cant afford to lose her now  
I thought I was right but I must of been wrong  
Cause my head is startin to bow  
And now Im moanin  
Moaoanin the blues  
  
If you want a good gal to stay around  
You gotta treat her nice and kind  
If you do her wrong shell leave this town  
And youll almost lose your mind  
Then youll moanin moaoanin the blues  
  
Aw baby baby baby  
Honey baby please come home  
Your dadaddy is lononesome and all I do is moan  
I promise you baby that Ill be good  
And Ill never be bad no more  
Im sittin here waitin for you right now  
To walk through that front door  
Then Ill stop moanin moaoanin the blues
