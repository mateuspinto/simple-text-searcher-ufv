Great is the Lord

By His power we trust  
In His love  
Great is the Lord  
He is faithful and true  
By His mercy He proves  
He is love

Now lift up your voice

Great is the Lord

By His power we trust  
In His love  
Great is the Lord  
He is faithful and true  
By His mercy He proves  
He is love
