Today tomorrow seems so far away and the wait in vain  
So safe in the blinding light of love unchained in yesterdays grave  
  
The truth that could set souls free  
Is buried within sweet pandemonium  
Concealed by disbelief  
The riddle stays veiled in sweet pandemonium  
  
Afraid that everything remains unchanged in this fragile dream  
Ashamed of the shattered remains of promises made  
  
Drained by the anger and grief  
Fazed by the envy and greed  
The secret cries for a release  
The lucidity hidden deep in sweet pandemonium
