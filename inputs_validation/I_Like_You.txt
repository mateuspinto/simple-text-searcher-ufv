Something in you caused me to  
Take a new tact with you  
You were going through something  
I had just about scraped through  
Why do you think I let you get away  
With the things you say to me  
Could it be I like you  
Its so shameful of me  
I like you  
  
No one I ever knew or have spoken to  
Resembles you  
This is good or bad all depending on  
My general mood  
Why do you think I let you get away  
With all the things you say to me  
Could it be I like you  
Its so shameful of me  
I like you  
  
Magistrates who spend their lives  
Hiding their mistakes  
They look at you and I and  
Envy makes them cry  
Envy makes them cry  
  
Forces of containment  
They shove their fat faces into mine  
You and I just smile  
Because were thinking the same lines  
Why do you think I let you get away  
With all the things you say to me  
Could it be I like you  
Its so shameful of me  
I like you  
  
Youre not right in the head and nor am I  
And this why  
Youre not right in the head and nor am I  
And this why  
This is why I like you I like you I like you  
This is why I like you I like you I like you  
Because youre not right in the head and nor am I  
And this is why  
Youre not right in the head and nor am I  
And this is why  
This is why I like you I like you I like you I like you  
This is why I like you I like you I like you I like you  
This is why I like you I like you
