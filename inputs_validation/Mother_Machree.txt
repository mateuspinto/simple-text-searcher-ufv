Theres a spot in me heart which no colleen may own  
Theres a depth in me soul never sounded or known  
Theres a place in my memory my life that you fill  
No other can take it no one ever will  
  
Chorus  
Sure I love the dear silver that shines in your hair  
And the brow thats all furrowed and wrinkled with care  
I kiss the dear fingers so toilworn for me  
Oh God bless you and keep you Mother Machree  
  
Every sorrow or care in the dear days gone by  
Was made bright by the light of she smile in your eye  
Like a candle thats set in a window at night  
Your fond love has cheered me and guided me right  
  
Chorus
