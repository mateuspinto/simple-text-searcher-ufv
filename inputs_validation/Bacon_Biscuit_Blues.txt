Put your biscuits in the oven  
Honey put your buns in bed  
I wanna come inside your kitchen  
Wanna taste your shortening bread  
  
I want to jump into your skillet  
Honey tickle your home fries  
I gotta hambone working fill it  
Wont you try it on for size  
  
Uh uh uh uh uh  
Baby ask me no questions  
Ill tell you no lies  
Put your biscuits in the oven  
Honey watch my dumplin  
  
Rise up  early in the morning  
Rise up  late at night  
Rise up  gotta get me a warning  
Rise up  gonna whet your appetite  
  
Gonna shake and bake you honey

I wanna sop up all your gravy  
From your deep dish apple pie  
  
So open up your menu  
I wanna slice your honey dew

And if you ask me no questions  
And tell me no lies

Rise up  late late late at night  
Rise up  giving me no warning  
Rise up  gonna wet your appetite
