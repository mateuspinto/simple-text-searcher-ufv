You took our lives away  
To increase your self esteem  
An underlie in the public eye  
Your dubbed insane if and when you try to  
Speak your mind  
In your own way  
Ignore the past and  
  
Speak free  
You smashed glass eyes just to say  
it all is all that I need  
What you see  
Is a reflection of my choice  
And what it means to me  
Trapped in your cell  
  
A mindless plot against own eyes  
To simplify your hell  
Just ease my pain
