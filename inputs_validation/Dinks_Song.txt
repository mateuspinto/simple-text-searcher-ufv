If I had wings like Noahs dove  
Id fly the river to the one I love  
Fare thee well my honey fare thee well  
I had a man who was long and tall  
Moved his body like a cannon ball  
Fare thee well my honey fare thee well  
  
Member one evening it was drizzling rain  
And in my heart I felt an aching pain  
Fare thee well my honey fare thee well  
  
Once I wore my apron low  
Been akeep you away from my door  
Fare thee well my honey fare thee well  
  
Now my apron is up to my chin  
You pass my door but you never come in  
Fare thee well my honey fare thee well  
  
Muddy river runs muddy n wild  
You cant care the bloody for my unborn child  
Fare thee well my honey fare thee well  
  
Number nine train ain done no harm  
Number nine train take my poor baby home  
Fare thee well my honey fare thee well  
  
Fastest man I ever saw  
Skid Missouri on the way to Arkansas  
Fare thee well my honey fare thee well
