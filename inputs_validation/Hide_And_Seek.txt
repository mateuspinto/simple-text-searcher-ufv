There was a time when there was nothing at all  
  
Nothing at all  
Just a distant hum  
There was a being and he lived on his own  
He had nd one to talk to and nothing to do  
He drew up the plans  
Learnt to work with his hands  
  
A million years passed by and his work was done  
And his words where these  
Hope you find it in everything  
  
Everything that you see  
  
Hope you find it in everything  
  
Everything that you see  
  
Hope you find it  
Hope you find it  
  
Hope you find me in you  
So she had built her  
Elaborate home with its ups and  
Its downs  
Its rain and its sun  
She decided that her work  
It was done  
Time to have fun  
  
And found a game to play  
Then as part of the game  
  
She completely forgot  
Where shed hidden herself  
And she spent the rest of her time  
Trying to find the parts  
  
Hope you find it in everything  
Everything that you see  
  
There was a time when there was nothing at all  
  
Nothing at all  
Just a distant hum
