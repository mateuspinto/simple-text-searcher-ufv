Everybodys searching for something  
Something that they can call their own  
Wishing hoping waiting for empty skieds to open up  
But they dont  
Whats up with all the obsession  
Whats in and whats out  
Thats what its about  
Still we dream of better  
Fearing nothings gonna ever be right yeah  
All along dont you know that you cant break free  
Take a look and see whats your reality  
Chorus  
Upside down spining round and round  
Happiness may not be what it seems  
Inside out alone whithout a doubt  
Is your heart until he sats you free  
From all of this reality  
Oh you know the world is so crazy  
Itll chew you up spit you out  
Leave you feeling empty inside  
Filling your head with little white lies  
Jesus is the only reason that my heart is free to say  
You could dream a thousand dreams and have a million things  
But nothing could replace the love that jesus gave  
Talk shows ecstasy horoscopes dvds pop culture magazines chat rooms
MTV  
Protein diets internet the story isnt over yet the psychic network really
cares  
WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE  
Chorus
