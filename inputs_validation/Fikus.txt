Fikus dreamed a dream for me  
It cost me nothing it was free  
He dreamed of walking in the sand  
Of blossoms forming in his hand  
  
Of kitchen cake and cedar shakes  
Of waterfalls and yellow snakes  
Of earthen dams and hydrofoils  
Of watching water til it boils  
  
Of holding forth from singing words  
Of flying south with flocks of birds  
None of this was charged to me  
For as I said it was for free
