The Christmas tree is decorated all the shoppings done  
Stockings line the fireplace one by one  
All the presents look so pretty tied with brightly colored bows  
All these things help make this season still everybody knows  
Christmas needs love to be Christmas  
Christmas needs hearts for a joy  
Carolers singing silver bells ringing and laughter for each girl and boy  
Christmas needs love to be Christmas  
Its all that we all need more of year in year out Im left with no doubt  
The greatest of all gifts is love  
Christmas needs love to be Christmas  
Christmas needs hearts for a joy  
Carolers singing silver bells ringing and laughter for each girl and boy  
Christmas needs love to be Christmas  
Its all that we all need more of year in year out Im left with no doubt  
The greatest of all gifts is love
