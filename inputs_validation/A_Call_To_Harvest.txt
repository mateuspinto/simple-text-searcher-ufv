Up away to the harvest field  
Gather in the golden yield  
Gird your armor and faithful be  
For the Master calleth thee  
  
Refrain  
Thrust your sickle in the harvest time is here  
Labor with your might the judgment day is near  
Thrust your sickle in the grain is falling fast  
Haste ere harvest time is past  
  
Always take with you faiths bright shield  
And your sickle bravely wield  
Stand against cunning foes you see  
For the Master calleth thee  
  
Keep uplifted the word of truth  
Spreading light to hopeful youth  
Bowed to Him must be every knee  
For the Master calleth thee  
  
Take with you holy peace and love  
Lift despairing souls above  
Toil to make sinful mortals free  
For the Master calleth thee
