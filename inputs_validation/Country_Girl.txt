She was a country girl from Clebourne Texas  
In a big city and she like my necklace  
So we started talking while we took a ride  
In a big pickup truck and my hat was to the side  
She was a country girl from the class of 96  
A big booty with some big ol country tits  
A country name with some country attitude  
Say yes maam but at times shes kinda rude  
A daddys girl so I had to watch my ass  
6 three Mr Hill would whoop my ass  
We cant kick it Im a city kid  
Imagine what would happen if he knew what we did  
What we did  
  
Chorus  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
  
She likes country livin and acoustic guitars  
And Kenny Chesney and country bars  
And Cadillacs and I couldnt relate  
Im just a concrete kid on a country date  
And her dad hated me oh I knew it  
He didnt like my tattoos pierced ears and black music  
We still cowtippin and trippin  
With that brush papa shirt lit back cause she was pimpin  
She was a country girl home cookin and grubbin  
Aint used to my style big limos and clubbin  
A city kid and Im doin my thang  
I like an old country girl this is how I sing  
  
Chorus  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
  
A country girl cut off jeans and lolly pops  
Tequila shots tube tops and liquor stops  
A country girl with them country ways  
Livin big city nights  
But them country days  
A country girl dont understand thuggin  
A country girl tractors and beer chuggin  
A country girl pigtails and carefree  
No direct dish just channel 3  
Come on this the only channel you have  
  
Chorus  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a different world  
I fell in love with a country girl  
A city kid in a differenty world  
  
Country Girls taste like chicken
