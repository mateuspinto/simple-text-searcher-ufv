Come with me  
Into the trees  
Well lay on the grass  
And let the hours pass  
Take my hand  
Come back to the land  
Lets get away  
Just for one day  
Let me see you  
Stripped down to the bone  
Let me see you  
Stripped down to the bone  
Metropolis  
Has nothing on this  
Youre breathing in fumes  
I taste when we kiss  
Take my hand  
Come back to the land  
Where everythings ours  
For a few hours  
Let me see you  
Stripped down to the bone  
Let me see you  
Stripped down to the bone  
Let me hear you  
Make decisions  
Without your television  
Let me hear you speaking  
Just for me  
Let me see you  
Stripped down to the bone  
Let me hear you speaking  
Just for me  
Let me see you  
Stripped down to the bone  
Let me hear you crying  
Just for me
