She drove her mothers car twas a 2cv  
I was most impressed by her casual dress  
I was most impressed  
Inside her rented room colored deepest blue  
I suppose we found some kind of happiness  
To fill the emptiness  
We were simply wasting precious time  
Hiding from the cruelest summer sky  
She took her mothers car to get away from me  
Heaven knows that i I can sympathize  
Oh I can sympathize  
For we were never close if the truth were told  
All we ever shared was a taste in clothes  
Oh we were never close  
We were simply losing everything  
Underneath the cruelest london sun  
We were simply wasting precious time  
We were simply wasting precious time  
We were simply wasting precious time
