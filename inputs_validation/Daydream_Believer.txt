Oh I could hide neath the wings  
Of the bluebird as she sings  
The six oclock alarm would never ring  
But it rings and I rise  
Wipe the sleep out of my eyes  
The shavin razors cold and it stings  
  
Cheer up sleepy jean  
Oh what can it mean  
To a daydream believer  
And a homecoming queen  
  
You once thought of me  
As a white knight on a steed  
Now you know how happy I can be  
Oh and our good times start and end  
Without dollar one to spend  
But how much baby do we really need  
  
Cheer up sleepy jean  
Oh what can it mean  
To a daydream believer  
And a homecoming queen  
Cheer up sleepy jean  
Oh what can it mean  
To a daydream believer  
And a homecoming queen  
  
Cheer up sleepy jean  
Oh what can it mean  
To a daydream believer  
And a homecoming queen  
Repeat and fade
