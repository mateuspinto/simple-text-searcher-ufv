He was there when I started  
In Knoxville Tennessee  
Hope none for patty and loveless  
November of ninetythree  
  
Full of friends mom and uncle Butch  
And the crowd was really small  
Hed say I was a scared kid  
If this bus could talk  
  
Some nights wed dance with the devil  
Some nights wed pray to the Lord  
Between vibrant passes and margarita glasses  
He was never really bored  
  
We were starry eyed dreamers  
Bouncing off the wall  
And all the stories he could tell  
If this bus could talk  
  
Hed sing of pool halls in Texas  
And have a corn dog in county fair  
Girls that we made cry  
Some crowds that didnt care  
  
And Bobby road us down in Bama  
He kept rocking through it all  
All the stories he could tell  
If this bus could talk  
  
Late night conversations  
Full of drunk philosophy  
On politics and religion football and family  
  
The lovers that we missed  
And the lovers that we lost  
All the secrets he could share  
If this bus could talk  
  
Hed seen Virginia Beach  
Caught in a hurricane  
He roads I wish I never met  
But he aint naming names  
  
We learned the code of the road at the grizzly roads  
When we had a bone  
All the stories he could serve  
If this bus could talk  
  
Many years of summers  
And I hope it never ends  
Been down so many highways  
Full of twists and turns and bends  
  
We caught lightning in a bottle  
Somehow we survived it all  
All the stories he could tell  
If this bus could talk  
  
As I leave the stage  
Still high from your applause  
Hed tell you that I love you  
If this bus could talk  
If this bus could talk  
If this bus could talk  
If this bus could talk
