If you see him tell him I wish him well how am I doing well sometimes  
Its hard to tell I still miss him more than ever but please dont say a
word  
If you see him if you see him  
  
If you see her tell her Im doing fine and if you want to say that I think  
Of her from time to time ask her if she ever wonders where we both went
wrong  
If you see her if you see her I still want her  
  
And I still need him so  
  
I dont know why we let each other go  
  
If you see her tell her the lights still on for her  
  
Nothings changed deep down the fire still burns for him and even if  
It takes forever say Ill still be here if you see him  
  
If you see her  
  
If you see him  
  
If you see her
