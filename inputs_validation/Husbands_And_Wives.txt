Two broken hearts lonely looking houses  
Where nobody lives  
Two people each having so much pride inside  
Neither side forgives  
  
Angry words spoken in haste  
Such a waste of two lives  
Its my belief  
Pride is the chief cause in the decline  
In the number of husbands and wives  
  
Chorus  
A woman and a man  
A man and a woman  
Some can and some cant and some cant  
  
Two broken hearts lonely looking houses  
Where nobody lives  
Two people each having so much pride inside  
Neither side forgives  
  
Angry words spoken in haste  
Such a waste of two lives  
Its my belief  
Pride is the chief cause in the decline  
In the number of husbands and wives  
  
Chorus
