Verse 1  
Im not concerned with people  
Who prey on the wealth of their fellow man oh yea  
Cause they only want to know you enroll you  
Only for the things ya had  
I just think its so sad  
  
Hook  
Get dem haters out your circle  
Smile in your face but all they wanna do is bring ya down  
See them try to mess to hurt you  
And work you  
Anything to bring ya down  
  
Verse 2  
They keep evil thoughts in their hearts what you dont know  
You cant let them knock your hustle  
Not letting them know how much you struggle  
They turn green with envy when your on top  
And dem heart is full with strife  
Their by gonna try to take your life  
  
Hook  
  
Bridge  
Ya know they talk about ya and they tell the lies  
Dont be fooled you betta recognize  
They not there for you  
They dont care for you  
Trust me cause I know its true  
Ya see they smile in your face and make ya think they down  
Then they turn against you when your not around  
Its just jealousy and dishonesty  
So hold on to your sanity
