I was backstage  
Couldnt believe my luck was in  
I saw him approach  
Wearing a most approachable grin  
When he said hello  
I was surprised he spoke so politely  
I said Id liked his show  
Well he just smiled  
I guess it happens nightly  
And so  
I fell in love  
  
We went to his room  
He had a video camera  
I was so nervous  
I had to try hard not to stammer  
He said  
Im glad you liked the show  
That crowd was dope out there tonight alright  
You want to see some more  
Well be my guest  
You can have a private performance  
Id fallen in love  
  
I didnt ask why  
Though he seemed like such a regular guy  
He said we could be  
Secret lovers  
Just him and me  
Then he joked  
Hey man  
Your name isnt Stan is it  
We should be together  
And he was passionate  
I guess I would rate  
Him a nine out of ten  
By then  
Id fallen in love  
  
When I asked  
Why have I heard so much  
About him being charged  
With homophobia and stuff  
He just shrugged  
  
Next morning we woke  
He couldnt have been a nicer bloke  
Over breakfast made jokes  
About Dre and his homies and folks  
Neither of us asked if or when  
We would see each other again  
But I thought that was cool  
cause I was already late for school  
By then  
Id fallen in love
