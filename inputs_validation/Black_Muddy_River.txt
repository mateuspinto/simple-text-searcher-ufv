When the last rose of summer pricks my finger  
And the hot sun chills me to the bone  
When I cant hear the song for the singer  
And I cant tell my pillow from a stone  
I will walk alone by the black muddy river  
And sing me a song of my own  
I will walk alone by the black muddy river  
And sing me a song of my own  
  
When the last bolt of sunshine hits the mountain  
And the stars start to splatter in the sky  
When the moon hits the southwest horizon  
With the scream of an eagle on the fly  
I will walk alone by the black muddy river  
And listen to the ripples as they moan  
I will walk alone by the black muddy river  
And sing me a song of my own  
  
Black muddy river roll on forever  
I dont care how deep or wide if youve got another side  
Roll muddy river roll muddy river black muddy river roll  
  
When it seems like the night will last forever  
And theres nothing left to do but count the years  
When the strings of my heart begin to sever  
And stones fall from my eyes instead of tears  
I will walk alone by the black muddy river  
And dream me a dream of my own  
I will walk alone by the black muddy river  
And sing me a song of my own sing me a song of my own
