I never saw it happen  
I never saw the flame  
I never new how much there was  
To lose and gain  
But when the sun was taken  
You never shone so bright  
And from a place wed long forgotten  
The blind were given sight  
If theres one thing I must do  
Its to say I love you to  
Its the one thing Im so sure of  
chorus  
If I hold you now from my point of view  
Will you show me how to be close to you  
If the dawn should break and youre  
Far away  
Can you ever know what I need to say  
I can see how much I was taking it all  
For granted  
Among the silent victims  
Only the wind would moan  
And for a time I felt us touch  
The great unknown  
For that eternal moment  
Oh what a price to pay  
With nothing left but all we have  
We slowly walked away  
If theres one thing I must do  
Its to say I love you too  
Its the one thing Im so sure of  
  
chorus  
So give life to your dreams  
For there lies your survival  
And cast your heart beyond those  
Faded scenes  
And Ill bring you through that storm  
Yes Ill bring you back  
  
chorus  
News from nowhere  
News from nowhere  
News from nowhere
