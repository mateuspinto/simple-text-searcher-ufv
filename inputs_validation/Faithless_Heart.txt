At times the women deep inside me  
Wanders far from home  
And in my mind I live a life  
That chills me to the bone  
A heart running for arms out of reach  
But who is the stranger my longing seeks  
I dont know  
But it scares me through and through  
Cause Ive a man at home  
Who needs me to be true  
  
Oh faithless heart  
Be far away from me  
Playin games inside my head  
That no one else can see  
Oh faithless heart  
You tempt me to the core  
But you cant have a hold on me  
So dont come around anymore  
  
God you know the feelings here  
Can wipe my world away  
Ravaging the promises  
A stronger heart once made  
So hold me Im falling so fast  
And tell me that the fighting inside will pass  
As I walk away  
And find the strength to choose  
The man who waits for me  
With a heart thats true  
  
Oh faithless heart  
Be far away from me  
Playin games inside my head  
That only I can see  
Oh faithless heart  
You tempt me to the core  
But you cant have a hold on me  
So dont come around anymore  
  
Faithless heart  
  
Oh faithless heart  
Be far away from me  
Playin games inside my head  
That nobody else can see  
Oh faithless heart  
You tempt me to the core  
But you cant have a hold on me  
So dont come around anymore  
Oh you cant have a hold on me  
So dont come around
