A lie for a lie but a truth for the truth  
  
Church of women is made out of milk  
which their love turns to butter er er  
Church of women will have you give praise  
with a laugh bark and stutter er er  
Like us men like us men they are nothing like us men  
Men have gargoyles round their hearts  
Im on my knees but dancing  
  
Want to worship at the church of women  
Breathe em in until my head goes spinning around  
Want to worship at the church  
Let me worship at the church of women  
  
Church of women is making donations of loving and giving ing ing  
Church of women performing that miracle raising the living ing ing  
Like us men like us men will they ever like us men  
Men have thorns around their minds  
Im on my mountain preaching  
  
Want to worship at the church of women  
Breathe em in until my head goes spinning around  
Want to worship at the church  
Let me worship at the church of women  
  
Lie for a lie but a truth for the truth  
Give em back their house the walls the doors the floors and roof  
And stop tryin to diet on the wafers and wine and submit were in control  
Now lets put things right  
Lets multiply the loves and kisses  
Til we have enough to love and eat forever  
  
Want to worship at the church of women  
I want to worship at the church of women now  
Breathe em in until my head goes spinning around  
Ill breathe em in until my head goes spinning round  
Want to worship at the church  
Let me worship at the church of women  
Want to worship at the church of women  
Repeat X3 and fade
