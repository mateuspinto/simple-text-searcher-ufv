Its Christmas time and time for a carol  
Time to sing about the little King  
To fill the bowl and roll out the barrel  
Have ourselves a fling  
  
We greet a friend or welcome a stranger  
Let him sing or cheer him on his way  
And celebrate the child in the manger  
Born on Christmas day  
  
Good cheer for you and for me  
With pleasure and glee to share  
Oh were so happy to be together  
On Yuletide square  
  
It looks like snow  
And falls like snow  
Take a moment  
Take a look around and say  
As snowflakes fall  
Merry Christmas to one and all
