Our love is like a new car smell  
Sooner or later it all goes to hell  
Somebody farts or spills some taco bell  
Our love is like a new car smell  
Our love is like a barbeque ignition  
You know that button you push lights the propane emission  
It works for a month then the spark goes missing  
Our love is like a barbeque ignition  
Our love is like a video game  
That you play alot and then it gets lame  
Then a new one comes out thats better but the same  
Our love is like a video game  
Our love  
Our love is like a surgical procedure  
Its painful and invasive your insurance wont cover  
And when its done you walk funny forever  
Our love is like a surgical procedure  
Our love is like a Meatloaf song  
It has its moments but its way too long  
Like a bat outta hell it all goes wrong  
Our love is like a Meatloaf song  
Our love is like Keanu Reeves  
Whos made some really bad movies  
Thats all time you cant retrieve  
Our love is like Keanu Reeves  
Our love
