note this is Skold not Marilyn Manson It is one of the demos that was
stolen from him that he was recording as a followup to his 1996 album
entitled Skold  
  
Rewrite the consitution  
Lets justify the revolution  
The end is here  
  
If youre a part of the institution  
Youre not a part of the solution  
Bow down to fear  
  
I I I am the president  
I I the emperor  
I I I am the king of the world  
  
The only good god is a dead god  
The only god good for me  
The only good god is a dead god baby  
The only damn god I need  
  
Dont draw your own conclusion  
Submit to the grand illusion  
Get on your knees  
  
There will be no absolution  
No final step of evolution  
The end is near  
  
I I I am the president  
I I the emperor  
I I I am the king of the world  
  
The only good god is a dead god  
The only god good for me  
The only good god is a dead god baby  
The only damn god I need  
  
The only good god is a dead god  
The only god good for me  
The only good god is a dead god baby  
The only damn god I need  
  
Your world means nothing to me  
Your saviors a fool still in your dreams  
And when youre wrapped in your blame  
Fullfill your own prophecy  
No skin off my teeth  
  
The only good god is a dead god  
The only god good for me  
The only good god is a dead god baby  
The only damn god I need  
  
The only good god is a dead god  
The only god good for me  
The only good god is a dead god baby  
The only fucking god I need  
  
I killed your king of deceit  
Chaos come onto me  
I am free  
And when youre ultimately  
Consumed by your own fucking greed  
You will see
