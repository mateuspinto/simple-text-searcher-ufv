Break break shake away break breakaway  
Now Im free to do what I want to do  
  
Time will not wait for me time is my destiny  
Why change the part of me that has to be free  
The love that passed me by I found no reason why  
  
But now each day is filled with the love that very same love  
That passed me by and that is why  
I can breakaway from that lonely life  
And I can do what I want to do  
And breakaway from that empty life and my world is new  
  
When I laid down on my bed I heard voices in my head  
Telling me now hey its only a dream  
The more I thought of it I had been out of it  
And heres the answer I found instead  
Baby baby found out it was in my head baby baby  
Baby baby found out it was my head baby baby  
Baby baby found out it was in my head baby baby  
  
And I can breakaway to the better life  
Where the shackles never hold me down  
Im gonna make a way for each happy day  
As my life turns around  
  
Come on were free to breakaway oh boy you jump for joy  
Now wont you come on when you breakaway  
Youre free to breakaways breakaway  
Come on youre free to breakaway breakaway  
Now wont you come on breakaway  
Youre free to breakaways breakaway  
  
Feel the vibrations in all the sensations breakaway
