Im always a flop at a topnotch affair  
But Ive still got my health so what do I care  
My best ring alas is a glass solitaire  
But I still got my health so what do I care  
  
By fashion and foppery Im never discussed  
Attending the opry my box would be a bust  
I never shall have that Park Avenue aire  
But Im in such health why should I care  
  
The hip that I shake doesnt make people stare  
But I got such health what do I care  
The sight of my props never stops a thoroughfare  
But I still got my health so what do I care  
  
Your face is your fortune so some wise men spoke  
My face is my fortune thats why Im totally broke  
My ship aint come in but I grin while I bear  
cause I got my vitamins  
A B C D E F G H  
I still have my  
Got no diamonds got no wealth  
I got no men but I got my health
