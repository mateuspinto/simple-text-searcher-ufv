Late afternoon dreaming hotel  
We just had the quarrel that sent you away  
I was looking for you are you gone gone  
  
Called you on the phone another dimension  
Well you never returned oh you know what I mean  
I went looking for you are you gone gone  
  
Down by the ocean it was so dismal  
Women all standing with shock on their faces  
Sad description oh I was looking for you  
  
Everyone was singing girl is washed up  
On Redondo beach and everyone is so sad  
I was looking for you are you gone gone  
  
Pretty little girl everyone cried  
She was the victim of sweet suicide  
I went looking for you are you gone gone  
  
Down by the ocean it was so dismal  
Women all standing with shock on their faces  
Sad description oh I was just looking for you  
  
Desk clerk told me girl was washed up  
Was small an angel with apple blonde hair now  
I went looking for you are you gone gone  
  
Picked up my key didnt reply  
Went to my room started to cry  
You were small an angel are you gone gone  
  
Down by the ocean it was so dismal  
I was just standing with shock on my face  
The Hearse pulled away and the girl that had died it was you  
  
Youll never return into my arms cause you were gone gone  
Never return into my arms cause you were gone gone  
Gone gone  
Gone gone  
Goodbye
