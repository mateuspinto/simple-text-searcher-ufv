Verse 1  
Shapes  
Of things before my eyes  
Just teach me to despise  
Will time make man more wise  
  
Verse 2  
  
Here  
Within my lonely frame  
My eyes just hurt my brain  
But will they seem the same  
  
Chorus  
Come tomorrow  
Will I be older  
Come tomorrow  
May be a soldier  
Come tomorrow  
Will I be bolder  
Than today  
  
Verse 3  
  
Now  
The trees are almost green  
But will they still be seen  
Where time and tide have been  
  
Verse 4  
  
Fallen  
Into your passing hands  
Please dont destroy these lands  
Dont make them desert sands  
  
repeat chorus  
  
Guitar solo  
  
Verse 5  
  
Soon  
I hope that I will find  
Loves deep within my mind  
That wont disgrace my kind
