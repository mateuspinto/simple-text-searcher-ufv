I woke this morning in a different disguise  
And I was crying crying  
You said it doesnt matter it doesnt matter  
It really doesnt matter at all  
I caught the mirror as I opened your letter  
I was lying lying  
I said it doesnt matter it doesnt matter  
It really doesnt matter at all  
Another shipwreck another heartbreak  
Another shipwreck I understand that  
I may never see home again  
Another shipwreck another heartbreak  
Another shipwreck I understand that  
I may never see home again  
Scared to lose you but knowing the magic  
It was dying dying  
I said it doesnt matter it doesnt matter  
It really doesnt matter at all  
I hear you every day I meet you at night  
I see you crying crying  
You say it doesnt matter it doesnt matter  
It really doesnt matter at all  
Another shipwreck another heartbreak  
Another shipwreck I understand that  
I may never see home again  
Another shipwreck another earthquake  
Another shipwreck I understand  
Its time to admit  
Despite our endeavors  
Cant find whatever we lost  
Another shipwreck another heartbreak  
Another shipwreck I understand that  
I may never see home again  
Another shipwreck another heartbreak  
Another shipwreck I understand that  
I may never see home again  
Another shipwreck another heartbreak  
Another shipwreck I understand that  
I may never see home  
I may never see home  
I may never see home again  
I woke this morning in a different disguise  
Another shipwreck  
I cracked a mirror as I opened your letter  
Another shipwreck  
Scared to lose you but knowing the magic  
Another shipwreck  
I hear you every day I meet you at night  
Another shipwreck  
Shipwreck  
Shipwreck
