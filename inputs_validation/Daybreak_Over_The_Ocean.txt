Bring back  
Wont you bring back  
Bring back my baby  
  
Daybreak over the ocean  
Moonlight still on the sea  
Will the waves gentle motion  
Bring my babe my baby back to me  
  
And the stardust sprinkles the morning  
Venus fades from my side  
Will my love be returning  
Like the sun to brighten up my life  
  
And as day breaks over the ocean  
Moonlight still on the sea  
I pray the waves gentle motion  
Will bring my baby to me  
  
Bring back  
Wont you bring back  
Bring back  
Bring my baby back  
Bring back  
Wont you bring back  
Bring back my baby  
  
Darlin if you could only  
Hear this song in my heart  
Then you know why you need never feel lonely  
Well soon be together never to depart  
And as long as there is an ocean  
Long as stars are to shine  
Baby you will always have my devotion  
Ill love you pretty baby  
Till the end of time  
  
And as day breaks over the ocean  
Moonlight still on the sea  
I pray the waves gentle motion  
Will bring my baby to me  
  
And as day breaks over the ocean  
Moonlight still on the sea  
I pray the waves gentle motion  
Will bring my baby to me  
  
Darlin if you should ever  
Wonder what you should do  
Baby you should know Ill love you forever  
Maybe little darlin  
That will see you through  
  
And as the sun sets over the ocean over the ocean  
And the world fades from view  
Baby always know our love and devotion  
Will brighten up the night  
We will make it through  
Because I love you  
  
Bring back  
Wont you bring back  
Bring back  
Bring my baby back  
Bring back  
Wont you bring back  
Bring back my baby  
Please my baby  
  
Bring back  
Wont you bring back  
Bring back  
Bring my baby back  
Bring back  
Wont you bring back  
Bring back my baby  
Please my baby
