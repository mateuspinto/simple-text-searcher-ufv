Oh blessed Lamb once slain  
Will reign for evermore  
His hands once bound now save  
Our God will never fail  
  
He is Lord  
He is Lord  
Sings my soul  
He is the Lord  
And He lives  
Yes He lives  
Im alive  
Cause Jesus lives  
  
Tis at the cross of Christ  
Where earth and heaven meet  
Where sin is overcome  
To God the victory  
  
And now  
Let the earth resound with praise  
For our Saviour God He reigns  
He is high and lifted up  
Arise  
For the King of glory waits  
He is coming back again  
He is coming back again
