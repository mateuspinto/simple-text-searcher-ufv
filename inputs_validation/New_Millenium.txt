A single star behind me  
A red sky burns ahead  
A lonely light below me  
Awake among the dead  
An overwhelming feeling  
Leaves me numb and strange  
A sense of new beginning  
I sense a wind of change  
  
Out with the old useless  
People so cold ruthless  
Welcome in a new millenium  
How many times must I  
Live out theis nightmare I  
Cant wait until a new millenium  
  
Ive got this feeling  
The tide is turning now baby  
Funny feeling  
Everythings gonna be alright now  
  
Living out a constant deja vu  
Keep your head up  
Please be patient we will get to you  
Keep your head up  
Just have some faith and you can see it through  
Keep your head up  
But faith dont pay the rent thats overdue  
Keep your head up  
All thats glittering is turning blue  
Keep your head up  
What they want from me aint gotta clue  
Keep your head up  
Swallow pride before it swallows you  
Keep your head up  
Dont dare bite the hands thats starving you  
Keep your head up  
  
How can you keep your head  
And not go insane  
When the only light at the end  
Of the tunnel is another train  
  
The lies ten feet tall  
Have broken my fall  
Welcome you all new millenium  
Its well overdue  
And I cant wait to  
Welcome in a new millenium  
  
Ive got this feeling  
The tide is turning now baby  
Funny feeling  
Everythings gonna be alright now
