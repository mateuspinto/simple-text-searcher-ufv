Well I wonder  
Do you hear me when you sleep   
I hoarsely cry  
Oh  
  
Well I wonder  
Do you see me when we pass   
I half die  
Oh  
  
Please keep me in mind  
Please keep me in mind  
  
Gasping  but somehow still alive  
This is the fierce last stand of all I am  
  
Gasping  dying  but somehow still alive  
This is the final stand of all I am  
  
Please keep me in mind  
  
Well I wonder  
Well I wonder  
Please keep me in mind  
Keep me in mind  
Keep me in mind
