Has it been so long  
Do you think we know  
Do you think we care  
Die for the here and now  
Do you remember why  
Do you remember how  
  
Face out  
Stick your chest out  
Stomach in  
Thats right  
  
Do you really know  
Where the harems go  
In the desert snow Hail  
An oasis dream doesnt really seem  
To mean a thing when youre out cold  
  
So hands up  
Put your guards up  
Feet down  
Up down  
Forward march  
Left right  
Cold cold  
I feel cold
