People saving whales  
And giving your thanks to our seas  
My respect to the ones in the forest  
Standing up for our old trees  
Them giving food to the hungry  
Giving hope to the needy  
Giving life to a baby giving care for free  
Cause there is freedom around us  
We have everything we need and I will care for you  
Cause you care for me  
And we all have opinions some of them get through  
But theres better people with more good to do good to do  
What I have could be a message  
Or just some words from my heart  
My respect to the ones making changes  
For all the lives theyll give their all  
Like giving food to the hungry  
Giving hope to the needy  
Giving life to a baby giving care for free  
Cause there is freedom around us  
We have everything we need and I will care for you  
Cause you cared for me  
And we all have opinions some of them get through  
But theres better people with more good to do good to do  
When our world keeps spinning round and round it goes  
Mother Nature keeps spreading its disease  
And our children keep growing up with  
What they know through what we teach and what they see  
And so only a question of the time we have  
And the lives that our children need  
As they can only keep growing up with  
What they know through what we teach and what they see  
Like giving food to the hungry  
Giving hope to the needy  
Giving life to a baby giving care for free  
Cause there is freedom around us  
We have everything we need and I will care for you  
Cause you care for me  
We all have opinions some of them get through  
But theres better people with more good to do good to do  
Oh good to do
