Well its a marvelous night for a moondance  
With the stars up above in your eyes  
A fantabulous night to make romance  
Neath the cover of October skies  
  
And all the leaves on the trees are falling  
To the sound of the breezes that blow  
And Im trying to please to the calling  
Of your heartstrings that play soft and low  
  
And all the nights magic seems to whisper and hush  
And all the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush  
  
Can I just have one a more moondance with you my love  
Can I just make some more romance with ayou my love  
  
Well I want to make love to you tonight  
I cant wait till the morning has come  
And I know now the time is just right  
And straight into my arms you will run  
  
And when you come my heart will be waiting  
To make sure youre never alone  
There and then all my dreams will come true dear  
There and then I will make you my own  
  
And everytime I touch you you just tremble inside  
And I know how much you want me that you cant hide  
  
Can I just have one a more moondance with you my love  
Can I just make some more romance with ayou my love  
  
Well its a marvelous night for a moondance  
With the stars up above in your eyes  
A fantabulous night to make romance  
Neath the cover of October skies  
  
And all the leaves on the trees are falling  
To the sound of the breezes that blow  
And Im trying to please to the calling  
Of your heartstrings that play soft and low  
  
And all the nights magic seems to whisper and hush  
And all the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush  
  
One more moondance with you in the moonlight  
Cant I just have one more dance with you my love
