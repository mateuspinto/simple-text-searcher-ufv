  
Well I was born in old Kentucky  
In them hills where folks are lucky  
From a coal miners daughter right to a coal miners wife  
  
Well the mountain folks love the mountains  
White lightning flowed like the fountains  
On a Sunday morning you can hear all the good folks singin  
  
Chorus  
Its Gods country in these hills he walks  
And in the middle of the night you can hear him talk  
Its the closest place to heaven that I know  
If you wanna get to heaven get your road map out  
Its called the bible if you have one doubt  
I guess my friends you must be on the wrong route  
  
Well I miss the old camp meeting time and dinner on the ground  
What I miss most is everything like all the country sounds  
Like the lonesome sound of the whippoorwill sang me to sleep every night  
And the whistle of the old freight train before daylight  
  
Chorus  
  
And my old Kentucky homes far away
