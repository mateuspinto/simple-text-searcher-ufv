Its carbon and monoxide  
The Ole Detroit perfume  
And it hangs on the highways  
In the morning  
And it lays you down by noon  
Oh Papa Hobo  
You can see that Im dressed like a schoolboy  
But I feel like a clown  
Its a natural reaction I learned  
In this basketball town  
  
Sweep up  
I been sweeping up the tips Ive made  
I been living on Gatorade  
Planning my getaway  
Detroit Detroit  
Got a hell of a hockey team  
Got a lefthanded way  
Of making a man sign up on that  
Automotive dream oh yeah  
Oh Papa Papa Hobo  
Could you slip me a ride  
Well its just after breakfast  
Im in the road  
And the weatherman lied
