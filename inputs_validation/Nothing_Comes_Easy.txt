Fussing and fighting alone with our friends  
Holding our breath and hoping it never will end  
Its been a long long haul  
We would be ducking and diving a rise then a fall  
Pretending the ups and the downs didnt matter at all  
And we got it almost right  
Well there were hundreds and hundreds of mumbling miles  
Always a personal reason to cop or to smile  
Now theres a green light  
We came and we went we went then we came  
Slowly but surely we learnt that it wasnt a game  
But it was good clean fun  
We were just second hand cars along with the rest  
Holding our own and hanging on in with the best  
Nothing comes easy  
Drinking and thinking what wed rather do  
Nothing of any real interest is coming on through  
Maybe were all right now  
But in the end does it matter matter at all  
Scratching a living and having one hell of a ball  
Nothing comes easy
