Here is a story that is bound to amuse ya  
about a fine young couple startin out in life  
A dedicated husband and a real fine worker  
who lived for his children and his beautiful wife  
But one night in Dallas at a computer convention  
he got so loaded he could hardly stand  
Woke up with a heavy head and a strange girl beside him  
returned home a worried guilty man  
But inside his coat his wife found a note  
It said Thanks for the good time Can I see you again  
She asked him Why oh why Tears rollin down her eyes  
would you give it all up for a moment of glory glory  
  
Packed up all her bags and returned to her mother  
Two small children clinging to her dress  
Hurt and disillusioned but never down hearted  
she picked up the pieces of her broken life  
And meanwhile back in Boston the culprit lie thinkin  
trying to find the answer in a bottle of wine  
Fired from his job and missing his children  
he didnt care one way if he lived or died  
Oh what a crying shame nobody else to blame  
for one night of pleasure he had given her pain  
Oh how it was so hard to climb so far to give it all up  
for a moment of glory glory  
  
As the months rolled by and accusations fly  
the bloodsuckin lawyers know theyre in for a kill  
The gold war begins shes takin off her rings  
Close friends take sides while the waters are still  
  
Phone rang twice in his stone cold appartment  
it was his little boy Johnny and his sister Beth  
They said Daddy we miss you would you talk to Mommy  
a line of communication he had sadly missed  
She said Now dont get me wrong this is where you belong  
I said Goodbye children we can work it all out  
But dont you ever forget how this family has bled  
cause you give it all up for a moment of glory glory  
  
Wont you give it all up  
you give it all up  
Wont you give it all up  
you give it all up
