Have you ever fed a lover with just your hands  
Close your eyes and trust it just trust it  
Have you ever thrown a fist full of glitter in the air  
Have you ever looked fear in the face  
And said I just dont care  
  
Its only half past the point of no return  
The tip of the ice burg  
The sun before the burn  
The thunder before lightning  
The breathe before the phrase  
Have you ever felt this way  
  
Have you ever hated yourself for staring at the phone  
Youre whole life waiting on the ring to prove youre not alone  
Have you ever been touch so gently you had to cry  
Have you ever invited a stranger to come inside  
  
Its only half past the point of oblivion  
The hourglass on the table  
The walk before the run  
The breathe before the kiss  
And the fear before the flames  
Have you ever felt this way  
  
La La La La La La La La  
  
There you are sitting in the garden  
Clutching my coffee  
Calling me sugar  
You called me sugar  
  
Have you ever wished for an endless night  
Lasso the moon and the stars and pulled that rope tight  
Have you ever held your breathe and asked yourself will it ever get better
than tonight  
Tonight
