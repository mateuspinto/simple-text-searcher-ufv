Well my baby used to stay out all night long she made me cry she done me wrong  
Come home each morning tellin me them same old lies  
But now table has turned and its her turn to cry  
Because I used to love her but its all over now  
  
Oh yes I used to love her but its all over now  
Well she started runnin round with every man in town  
Spending all my money playin a high class game  
She would never change no matter how I tried  
  
But the table has turned and its her turn to cry  
Because I used to love her  
I used to wake up in the morning get my breakfast in bed  
When I was worried she would ease my achin head  
  
Now shes here and there with every guy in town  
Still tryin to take me for that same old clown  
Because I used to love her
