Met myself a comin county welfare line  
I was feelin strung out hung out on the line  
Saw myself a goin down to war in June  
All I want all I want is to write myself a tune  
  
Chorus  
Wrote a song for everyone  
Wrote a song for truth  
Wrote a song For everyone  
And I couldnt even talk to you  
  
Got myself arrested wound me up in jail  
Richmond bout to blow up communication failed  
If you see the answer nows the time to say  
All I want all I want is to get you down and pray  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Saw the people standin thousand years in chains  
Somebody said its different now look its just the same  
Pharoahs spin the message round and round the truth  
They could have saved a million people how can I tell you  
  
Chorus x2
