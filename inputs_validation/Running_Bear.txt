On the banks of the river stood Running Bear  
Young Indian brave  
On the other side of the river stood his lovely Indian maid  
Little White Dove was her name  
Such a lovely sight to see  
But their tribes fought with each other  
So their love could never be  
  
Chorus  
Running Bear loved Little White Dove  
With a love as big as the sky  
Running Bear loved Little White Dove  
With a love that wouldnt die  
  
He couldnt swim the raging river  
Cause the river was too wide  
He couldnt reach his Little White Dove  
Waiting on the other side  
In the moonlight he could see her  
Blowing kisses across the waves  
Her little heart was beating faster  
Waiting there for her brave  
  
Chorus  
  
Running Bear dove in the water  
Little White Dove did the same  
And they swam out to each other  
Through the swirling stream they came  
As their hands touched and their lips met  
The ragging river pulled them down  
Now theyll always be together in that happy hunting ground
