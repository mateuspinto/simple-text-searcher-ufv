Grab a six pack for the way home  
Its only twenty five minutes alone  
At a chance to listen to what you see fit  
Put your tail between your legs and you split  
Was never one for luck  
On a pay rise or a girl you got stuck  
Never bother with FM radio  
Pop a compilation tape and well go  
But every dick that comes from the hills  
Is gonna innundate you still  
Never one to let something go  
To make you hate or cuss at folks you dont know  
As his girlfriend takes the last mushroom slice  
You hope they never make their movie on time  
Was never one for luck  
On a pay rise or a girl you got stuck  
Never bother with FM radio  
Pop a compilation tape and well go  
But every dick that comes from the hills  
Is gonna innundate you still  
Nineteen to twenty two  
Just Nik Jaimme red wine and you  
Into the Datsun and go  
To another Massappeals show  
Was never one for luck  
On a pay rise or a girl you got stuck  
Never bother with FM radio  
Pop a compilation tape and well go  
But every dick that comes from the hills  
Is gonna innundate you still
