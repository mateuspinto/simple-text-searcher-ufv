Empty words falling on ears  
Which have never heard  
Hollow lies comin from  
Lost hungup and lonely guys  
Through the night make a sight  
Other rider looks so true  
Sinnin spinnin tales of Lucy Blue  
  
Piercing smile filling her face  
For a while  
Closin door leaving the heart open  
And wounded more  
Gone away lonely day  
Turning grey with no clue  
Faking making tales of Lucy Blue  
Oh oh oh  
  
Restless night longing for love  
Beneath the neon light  
Desperate hands reachin for someone  
Wholl understand  
Stroll around through the town  
Lost and found when its due  
Sellin tellin tales of Lucy Blue  
  
Yeah Lucy Blue one or two  
Just for you hey yeah  
Tales of Lucy Blue
