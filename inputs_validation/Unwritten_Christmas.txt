Unwritten Law  
Remember when I was ten  
Lookin forward to Christmas again  
Everything I enjoy  
Like the family Christmas tree and the toys  
And Id wake up early morning  
While mom and dad still snored in bed  
So I crept down the steps  
Couldnt wait to see what Santa had left now  
  
Chorus  
I could not wait for Christmas day  
Wait for Christmas day now  
  
Unwritten Law  
Dont want to wait gettin late  
March up stairs to give my parents a shake  
Get out of bed sleepy heads  
Christmas doesnt start till you are awake  
As we gather around the tree  
I open everything they gave to me  
So I stay end up late  
Why cant it be Christmas everyday now  
  
Chorus  
I could not wait for Christmas day  
Wait for Christmas day now  
But I but I will have to wait for Christmas  
I will hafta wait for Christmas  
I will always wait for Christmas day  
  
Sum 41  
Now wake up Christmas morning guess what I saw  
Its Unwritten Law and Sum 41 rock it raw  
With the message for kids sayin they should be nice  
Not naughty cause Santa knows karate hes on the cross Vader  
Hip hop hoorayder  got wade on the beats  
Like AC Slater if you good like Wally  
Or bad like the Beev only Santa know the score  
Come Christmas eve  
  
Chorus  
But I but I will have to wait for Christmas  
I will have to wait for Christmas  
I will always wait for Christmas  
Day now yeah I could not wait for Christmas day
