I live for You  
All of my days belong to You  
You draw me to  
Your tenderness You make me new  
Into the secret place I will run  
Where my heart can be free in the  
Grace that I found in You  
Unto You  
Be all Glory and Praise  
How my heart seeks Your Face  
As Im waiting on You  
Only You  
Are my strength and my tower  
Fill my life with Your Power  
As I stand here in awe of You  
I stand here in awe of You
