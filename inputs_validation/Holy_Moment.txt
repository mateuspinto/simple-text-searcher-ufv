As we come today  
We remind ourselves of what we do  
That these songs are not just songs  
But signs of love for you  
This is a holy moment now  
Something of heaven touches earth  
Voices of angels all resound  
We join their song  
Come come come  
Let us worship God  
With our hands held high  
And our hearts bowed down  
We will run run run  
Through your gates o God  
With a shout of love with a shout of love  
Lord with confidence  
We come before your throne of grace  
Not that we deserve to come  
But you have paid the way  
You are the holy king of all  
Heaven and earth are in your hands  
All of the angels sing your song  
We join them now  
Chorus
