Little Joe run for the border  
Leave your home  
Go where the reptiles roam  
On the side of the border that is your home  
  
Little Joe eyes of your lover look back on you  
As you run for cover  
Though stick and fire and may break your bones  
Theres a light in the tunnel that leads you home  
  
Little Joe just like your father  
Your eyes will water your guts will splatter  
Though sticks and fire sticks and fire  
Wont break your bones it is a lie  
  
Little Joe run for the border  
Leave your mother and father  
Go to where the reptiles roam  
Theyre waiting for you Little Joe
