The dark is filled with dreams  
So many dreams which one is mine  
One must be right for me  
Which dream of all the dreams  
  
When theres a dream for every star  
And there are oh so many stars  
So many stars  
The wind is filled with songs  
  
So many songs which one is mine  
One must be right for me  
Which song of all the songs  
When theres a song for every star  
  
And there are oh so many stars so many stars  
Along the countless days the endless nights  
That I have searched so many eyes  
So many hearts so many smiles  
  
Which one to choose which way to go how can I tell  
How will I know out of oh  
So many stars so many stars  
  
Yes the wind is filled with songs so many songs  
Which one is mine one must be right for me  
Which song of all the songs  
When theres a song for every star  
  
And there are oh so many stars so many stars  
Along the countless days the endless nights  
That I have searched so many eyes  
So many hearts so many smiles  
  
Which one to choose which way to go how can I tell  
How will I know out of oh so many stars  
So many stars so many stars oh so many stars  
  
So many stars oh there are so many stars  
So many stars lots and lots of stars oh so many so many  
Oh so many stars many  
So many many so many stars stars
