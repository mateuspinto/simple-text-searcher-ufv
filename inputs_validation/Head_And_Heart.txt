Theres just no way to say how much I love you  
You never make me cry and thats just fine  
Ive only got my fear to burn above me  
You know we all get scared from time to time  
  
Love me with your head and heart  
Love me from the place it starts  
Love me with your head and heart  
Love me like a child  
  
Theres just no way to play the things Im feelin  
No way to tell you all the things you mean  
Every day I only feel like stealin  
Away to where I know I can be free  
  
Love me with your head and heart  
Love me from the place it starts  
Love me with your head and heart  
Love me when Im wild  
  
Laying down the ways to say I need you  
Scared of lookin tall and feeling small  
Running through the days I have beside you  
Scared of being wrong and thats it all  
  
Love me with your head and heart  
Love me from the place it starts  
Love me with your head and heart  
Love me like a child  
  
Love me with your head and heart  
Love me from the place it starts  
Love me with your head and heart  
Love me like a child
