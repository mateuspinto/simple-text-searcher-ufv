The death of the Omega pilots the war machine  
We shall destroy the earth  
Rebuild it  
None shall inherit it  
Blood turned into fire  
Made to drink like wine  
Pile up the countless corpses and on them we shall dine  
  
We praise you war machine  
Youve come to set us free  
Run us through your jaws  
Carry us off in your claws  
  
Cut away body from soul  
A slave freed from his master  
Closing the spirits eye to embrace this earthly tie  
  
666 The number of man brought upon by man  
  
The earth it shall burn bright tonight in our eyes  
The earth it shall burn right into our eye on this very night  
Praise the war machine  
Burn tonight
