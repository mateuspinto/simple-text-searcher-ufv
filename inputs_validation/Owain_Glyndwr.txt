Im a welsh noble I mobilised Wales against the English  
Fought King Henry Four because Wales abhorred English rule  
But my uprising it went a bit wrong and this song tells the surprising tale  
  
Owain Glyndwr  
Welsh hero of the hour  
It all began cause my neighbour a vindictive man  
Baron Grey De Ruthen was spreading untrue things bout me  
  
Said I was a rebel who planned to repel Englands king  
Not really true but more than a few were convinced  
So I decided to take up the mantle was given the handle of Prince  
Of Wales  
  
You dont have to be Welsh to feel Welsh pride  
Even kingsman Henry Hotspur ended up on my side  
We claimed Welsh ground then in Hereford rain meant  
The king nearly drowned washed away in his tent  
So partly thanks to Welsh weather  
I was crowned think Im gunna dance now  
  
I had great plans for new government new law and churches  
But Henry the Fourth had dried off and revenge was his game  
We were defeated he blocked supplies to Wales  
Our crops failed and starvation came  
  
Owain Glyndwr  
My family sent to the tower  
As Welsh towns fell and we all know that never ends well  
So I disappeared but my name is revered throughout Wales  
  
Owain Glyndwr  
Father of the fight for Welsh power  
Welsh legend holds that should Wales ever need someone bold  
Ill rise up to help them Im due Im six hundred years old  
  
Henffych well iare arwr mawr Cymru  
Owain Glyndwr
