This is tonight and it rains like in a French black and white movie of the
50s I feel like a character in it whos just lost it all who is alone with
his raincoat and a face showing a yet unknown way out of it Steamy hot summer
night street makes me laugh I enjoy waiting for a taxi and I hope its not
gonna be here until Ive had enough of this pleasant situation  
  
Movie is on  
There comes a lady through the night  
She stops in front of me  
And asks me for a light  
  
To win some time  
To introduce myself  
I pretend not to know  
In which pocket I got my matches  
  
Movie is on  
There comes a lady through the night  
She stops in front of me  
And asks me for a light  
  
She is walking on but not too far  
She disappears behind a door  
Some cats down there inside a club  
The Sixties play guitar  
  
Movie is on  
There came a lady through the night  
She stopped in front of me  
And asked me for a light  
  
I enjoy the rain and my wet hair  
Feel slightly stupid  
But got to follow her  
The club is empty  
I am standing near the door  
She is the only dancer  
On the biggest floor  
  
Quel est votre nom
