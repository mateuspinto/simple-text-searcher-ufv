Sitting alone in the doghouse  
Thinking of you all the time  
Sighing crying  
Sitting alone in the doghouse  
Thinking of you all the time  
Sighing crying  
  
Dark lady  
  
Sitting alone by my window  
Counting the stars of the night  
Waiting hating  
Sitting alone by my window  
Counting the stars of the night  
Waiting hating  
  
Dark lady  
  
Sitting and watching the sunrise  
Darkness is filling my eyes  
Sighing crying  
Sitting and watching the sunrise  
Darkness is filling my eyes  
Sighing crying  
  
Dark Lady
