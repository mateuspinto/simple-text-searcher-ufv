Shes old enough  
She knows enough  
Shes thrown up  
So throw her  
Out to me  
And Ill treat her like she was mine  
My belief  
You got your way and Ill get mine  
  
And I cant eat  
I cant sleep  
I want to thank you for coming  
And why do we always laugh  
While were in this discussion  
  
Should have known enough  
Never grown enough  
Alone enough  
To know my  
  
Where would be  
The path I wanted to try  
If it fairs to be  
Good for me than Id rather die  
  
And I cant eat  
I cant sleep  
I want to thank you for coming  
And why do we always laugh  
While were in this discussion  
  
Black words always lead to something  
Bury her cause her time was cut thin  
All the while you just stood and stared  
Never cared to help we just got carried away  
  
Lately it seems like my dreams have started to die  
It occurred to me on the inside I guess so have I  
  
And I cant eat  
I cant sleep  
I want to thank you for coming  
And why do we always laugh  
While were in the last ones coming  
  
Standing here with my two feet  
Enjoy it now cause it wont be  
Some way  
Some how  
The things that keep me alive  
Arent livin here anymore
