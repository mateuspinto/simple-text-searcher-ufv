She can light a fire under me  
Give me all the courage that I need  
She can see a side I just cant see she can  
  
She can make me smile when I wanna cry  
Find a way to change my state of mind  
She can always reach through my disguise she can  
  
When my world gets crazy and I just cant cope  
She throws her arms around me and gives me hope  
When I got the desire but I got no plans  
I need someone to understand oh only she can  
  
She can take the chill out of winter nights  
Take away the wrong from whats not right  
She can make the darkest hour look bright she can  
  
When I really need to make a stand  
But I dont believe in who I am  
When I really want to but I just cant she can  
  
When my world gets crazy and I just cant cope  
She throws her arms around me and gives me hope  
When I got the desire but I got no plans  
I need someone to understand oh only she can  
  
I try to do for her what she does for me  
Cause I want our love to grow  
Im gonna hold on tightly only a fool would let her go  
  
Cause when my world gets crazy and I just cant cope  
She throws her arms around me and gives me hope  
When I got the desire but I got no plans  
I need someone to understand oh only she can  
  
Yes she can  
Only she can  
Yes she can  
Oh yes she can unverified
