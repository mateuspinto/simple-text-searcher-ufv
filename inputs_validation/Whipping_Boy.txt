Since then I never feel helpless recess this mess if you do  
And I find that even time well spent gets bent if you need it to  
And we do  
Well by now Ive showed you how much I believe in the here and now and I wish  
That you knew  
  
Lay all you want on me  
Lay all you want on me  
Lay all you want on me  
Ill be your whipping boy  
  
You spilled your purse onto my bed  
Searching for something for your head  
Since then you never come clean I mean  
You wish you only could  
  
Lay all you want on me  
Lay all you want on me  
Lay all you want on me  
Ill be your whipping boy  
  
I can get up  
  
And I find that even time well spent gets bent if you need it to  
And we do  
And we do  
Lay all you want on me  
Lay all you want on me  
Lay all you want on me  
Ill be your whipping boy
