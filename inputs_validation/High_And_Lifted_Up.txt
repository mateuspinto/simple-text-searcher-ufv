Lord of all the earth  
And all of heaven  
I come and seek Your face  
Worship You with all I have within me  
Humbled by Your grace  
  
Every heart every nation  
Every tribe all creation  
Will bow before Your presence and sing  
  
You are high and lifted up  
You are high and lifted up  
And my soul sings hallelujah  
To the Lamb  
The Lamb of God  
  
Lord of righteousness  
You come in glory  
Bright and morning star  
All my days Ill worship and adore You  
Healer of my heart  
  
Every prayer every cry  
You alone satisfy  
We will lift Your praise  
Again and again  
  
Majesty  
Majesty  
Jesus Lamb of God  
Majesty  
Majesty  
Holy are You Lord
