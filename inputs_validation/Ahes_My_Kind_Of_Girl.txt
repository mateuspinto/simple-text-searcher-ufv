Look at her face its a wonderful face  
And it means something special to me  
Look at the way that she smiles when she sees me  
How lucky can one fellow be  
  
Shes just my kind of girl she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine  
Shes just my kind of girl without her Im blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do what could I do  
  
And when we go for a walk in the park  
And she holds me and squeezes my hand  
Well go on walking for hours and talking  
About all the things that we plan  
  
Shes just my kind of girl she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine  
Shes just my kind of girl without her Im blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do what could I do
