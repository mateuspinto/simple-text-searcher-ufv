Take it from me dont be a dobadder up  
Dobadder up do bother to put your foot up  
That ladder that leads you to that place  
Below and every day you lose other you  
Feel sadder you get madder so use the other  
Step ladder you climb the other way  
Scrapping and fighting scratching and fighting  
Cheating and acting selfish makes your heart  
Like a part of the hardest heart so selfish  
Take it from me dont you be a dobadder up  
A dobadder up a dobadder up just step up for that  
Step ladder and climb the other way  
Larry What the hell does all this nonsense talk mean
