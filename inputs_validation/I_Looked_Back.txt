You looked back to see if I looked back  
And I looked back to see if you looked back  
To see if I looked back to see  
If you were lookin at me  
I looked back to see if you looked back  
When you looked back I felt my heart strings snap  
And heard a thunder clap  
And saw the lightning striking at me  
Then I stood still an you stood still  
The world stood still my heart stood still  
And O the thrill that suddenly we knew  
The very very moment     
I looked back to see if you looked back  
And you looked back to see if I looked back  
To see if you looked back to see  
If I was lookin at you  
  
Then I stood still an you stood still  
The world stood still my heart stood still  
And O the thrill that suddenly we knew  
The very very moment     
I looked back to see if you looked back  
And you looked back to see if I looked back  
To see if you looked back to see  
If I was lookin at you  
    to see if you were lookin at me   
To see if I was lookin at you lookin at me  
Lookin at you    lookin at me
