I hear the girls scream soon as we arrivin  
You can ask Ibn we be straight mackin  
Yall work at ibm hotels they be in  
Ooh la la tres bien magnifique any street  
  
If you talkin bout marriage you mean multimillion heiress  
  
Father is the black Bruce Wayne only shorty in preschool rockin two chains  
  
Tryna hand feed us tell the niggas to anty up  
We not off no more pearlies in a show fur  
So pick your auntie up I gotta run to that pole
