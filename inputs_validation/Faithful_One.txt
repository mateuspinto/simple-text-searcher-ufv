I find no hope within to call my own  
For I am frail of heart my strength is gone  
But deep within my soul is rising up a song  
Here in the comfort of the faithful one  
  
I walk a narrow road through valleys deep  
In search of higher ground on mountains steep  
And though with feet unsure I still keep pressing on  
For I am guided by the faithful one  
  
Faithful faithful to the end  
My true and precious friend  
You have been faithful  
Faithful so faithful to me  
  
I see your wounded hands I touch your side  
With thorns upon your brow you bled and died  
But theres an empty tomb a love for all who come  
And give their hearts to you the faithful one  
  
Faithful faithful to the end  
My true and precious friend  
You have been faithful  
Faithful so faithful to me  
  
And when the day is dawned and when the race is run  
I will bow down before Gods only Son  
And I will lift my hands in praise for all youve done  
And I will worship you my faithful one
