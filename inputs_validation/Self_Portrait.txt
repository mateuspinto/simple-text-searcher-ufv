Paint me a picture  
And hand it on the wall  
Colour it darkly  
The lines must start to crawl  
Down down down  
  
Spin me around and around  
Draw me away  
To the night from the day  
Leave not a trace to be found  
Down down  
  
Nothing is real  
But the way that I feel  
And I feel like going  
Down down  
  
Paint me a picture  
Of eyes that never see  
With flasks of lightning  
That burn for only me  
Hey hey hey  
  
Theres only the devil to pay  
Im ready to go  
Pull me down from below  
Give me a place I can lay  
Hey hey  
  
Nothing is real  
But the way that I feel  
And I feel like going down Refrain  
Down down
