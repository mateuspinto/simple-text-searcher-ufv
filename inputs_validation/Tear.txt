This is my time  
This is my tear  
I can see clearly now  
That this is not a place  
For playing solitaire  
Tell me where you want me  
This is my time  
This is my tear  
  
Comin on strong  
Baudelaire  
Seems to me like  
All the world gets high  
When you take a dare  
Let it rise before you  
This is my crime  
  
Chorus  
All in all Im  
Loving every rise and fall  
The sun will make and I will take  
Breath to be sure of this  
In the end  
All will be forgiven when  
Surrender rises high and I  
Gave what I came to give  
Say it now because you never know  
  
Devil may cry devil may care  
Distillers got a scream  
And now I know just why  
When shes movin air  
Can you feel the voltage  
This is my time  
California skies  
Got room to spare  
This is my time  
  
Chorus  
  
Take it outside  
Take it out there  
Seems to me like  
All the world gets high  
When you take a dare  
In the final moment  
This is my time  
  
Chorus
