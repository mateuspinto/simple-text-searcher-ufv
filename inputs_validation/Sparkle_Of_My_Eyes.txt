UB40  Sparkle Of My Eyes  
Many a girl has caught my eye Verse 1  
Many a girl and that aint no lie  
But girl to me you top them all  
So beautiful with no effort at all  
Sparkle of my eyes sparkle of my eyes Chorus  
Sparkle of my eyes sparkle of my eyes  
Girl in you eyes I see the stars Verse 2  
Warm as the sun in spring you are  
A certain delight I feel in your touch  
And when you smile I love it so much  
Sparkle of my eyes sparkle of my eyes Chorus  
Sparkle of my eyes sparkle of my eyes

Gentle to me and so very kind Verse 3  
Never saying no youre good for my mind  
You ask me why your so special to me  
Look in these eyes girl and then you will see
