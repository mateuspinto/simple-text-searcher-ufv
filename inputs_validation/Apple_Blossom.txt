Hey little apple blossom  
What seems to be the problem  
All the ones you tell your troubles to  
They dont really care for you  
  
Come and tell me what youre thinking  
Cause just when the boat is sinking  
A little light is blinking  
And I will come and rescue you  
  
Lots of girls walk around in tears  
But thats not for you  
Youve been looking all around for years  
For someone to tell your troubles to  
  
Come and sit with me and talk awhile  
Let me see your pretty little smile  
Put your troubles in a little pile  
And I will sort them out for you  
Ill fall in love with you  
I think Ill marry you
