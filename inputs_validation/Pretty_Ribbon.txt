Pretty ribbon  
Tying up a little love  
Sending it along to  
Someone that Im thinking of  
Someone very special  
Pretty ribbon  
Open it and you will find  
Something that I hope will  
Always keep me on your mind  
Even though youre far away  
One little thought in a present can say  
Just how much you mean to me  
I hope it makes your day  
Pretty ribbon  
Hoping that youll always be  
Close to what I send you  
Part of what I send is me  
Even though youre far away  
One little thought in a present can say  
Just how much you mean to me  
I hope it makes your day  
Pretty ribbon  
Tying up a little love  
Sending it along to  
Someone that Im thinking of
