I remember the days of just keeping time  
Of hanging around in sleepy towns forever  
Back roads empty for miles  
  
Well you cant have a dream and cut it to fit  
But when I saw you I knew wed go together  
Like a wink and a smile  
  
Leave your old jalopy  
Buy the railroad track  
Well get a hip double dip tip toppy  
Two seat Pontiac  
  
So you can rev her up dont go slow  
Its only green lights and alright  
Lets go together with a wink and a smile  
  
Give me a wink and a smile  
We go together like a wink and a smile  
  
Now my heart is music such a simple song  
Sing it again the notes never end  
This is where I belong  
  
Just the sound of your voice  
The light in your eyes  
Were so far away from yesterday  
Together with a wink and a smile  
  
We go together like a wink and a smile
