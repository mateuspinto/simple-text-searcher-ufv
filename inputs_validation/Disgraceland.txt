I want to tell you a story happened long ago  
About a redneck boy down from Tupelo  
I got the slick black hair I played a rock guitar  
I liked to shake my hips man then i went too far  
  
He ate his weight in country ham  
Killed on pills and woke in Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
  
I had a lot of girls yeah I had a lot of guns  
When they found me dead ow the whole world was stunned  
Went to the pearly gates said Im the hippest thing  
And Peter said Well son we already got ourselves a king  
  
He lived on southern deepfried spam  
Killed on pills and woke in Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
  
He finished his short life sweaty and bloated and stoned  
AHeyHey  
He ruled his domain and he died on the throne  
No YesMen no colonel he went all alone  
  
Hey man that looks like me down there on the floor  
  
I heard the devil cry real loud and clear  
You were the big man there hejust a sideman here  
Well I know your face and Ive heard your name  
Looks like heavens loss gonna be my gain  
Ive got plans for you man  
  
He ate his weight in country ham  
Killed on pills and woke in Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland
