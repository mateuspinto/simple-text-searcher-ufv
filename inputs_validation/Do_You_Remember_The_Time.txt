Do you remember the time your heart was moved to tears  
Can you look back on the moment after all these years  
On the moment love broke through and heaven seemed so near  
Do you remember the time your heart was moved to tears  
  
Do you remember the day you first let Jesus in  
How he gently and tenderely washed away your sin  
Dont you know that He still cares the way He did back then  
Do you remember the day you first let Jesus in  
  
Keep holdin on  
Never letting go  
Were not far  
from the end of the road  
  
Keep holdin on  
Never letting go  
Were not far  
from the end of the road  
  
In a moment love broke through heaven and heaven seemed so near  
Do you remember the moment your heart was moved to tears  
Do you remember the time your heart was moved to tears
