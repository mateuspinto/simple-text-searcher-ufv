Who is the you that no one else can see  
In your heart a lonely one afraid to be  
Lost again need a friend  
  
You hide your soul to keep the hurt inside  
All alone your tears call out into the night  
Is He there does He care  
  
Chorus  
Yes I know your name  
Every prayer you pray  
Im the One Who brought you to this place  
The Voice Who sings to you  
The Hand that clings to you  
Oh My child Ive always known your name known your name  
  
I hold you close to me close to heart  
And this kind of love will find you anywhere you are  
Never fear I am here  
  
Chorus
