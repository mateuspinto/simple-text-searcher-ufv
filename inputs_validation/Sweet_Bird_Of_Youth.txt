The Sweet Bird Of Youth  
Nat King Cole  
The sweet bird of youth soon flies away  
And nothing can make him stay  
The sweet bird of youth soothes us his sound  
To waste precious time is wrong  
So come to my arms  
Were young but well learn  
That lips unkissed like moments missed  
Can never return  
How sad is the truthtry though we may  
The sweet bird of youth flies away  
The sweet bird of youth flies away
