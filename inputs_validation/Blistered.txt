Ive got great big blisters on my bloodshot  
Eyes from looking at that long legged woman up ahead  
What she does simply walking down the sidewalk of the city  
Makes me think about a stray cat getting fed  
  
hes got a whole lotta motion in her sole I know  
But her sole aint the place she lets it show  
  
She got a body oh yeah she got a motion oh yeah  
Lord Im blistered oh oh yeah  
She done tore my sole apart put big blisters on my heart  
What a mighty crazy cooking way to go  
  
Ive got great big blisters on my fingertips  
From reaching in my pocket book and picking out the bills  
And I got tiny white blisters in my throat  
From trying to ease my nervous tension taking all them pat and pills  
  
And ever since she started running around from bar to bar  
I just cant eat a bite or keep my stomach settled down  
  
She got a body oh yeah she got a motion oh yeah  
She done got me oh yeah  
She done tore my sole apart put big blisters on my heart  
What a mighty crazy cooking way to go  
  
She got a body oh yeah she got a motion oh yeah  
Oh Im blistered oh oh yeah  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah  
Blistered blistered
