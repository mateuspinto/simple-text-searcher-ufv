In the streets the children screamed  
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed  
And not a word was spoken  
The church bells all were broken  
The three men I admired most  
The Father Son and The Holy Ghost  
They took the last train for the coast  
The day the music died  
They were singing Bye bye Miss American Pie  
I drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry  
Them good ol boys were drinkin whiskey and rye  
Singing Thisll be the day that I die thisll be the day that I die  
And the three men I admired most  
The Father Son and The Holy Ghost  
They took the last train for the coast  
The day the music died
