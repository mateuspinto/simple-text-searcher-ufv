Well why dont you love me like you used to do  
How come you treat me like a worn out shoe  
My hairs still curly and my eyes are still blue  
Why dont you love me like you used to do  
  
Aint had no lovin like a huggin and a kissin  
In a long long while  
We dont get nearer or further or closer  
Than a country mile  
  
Why dont you spark me like you used to do  
And say sweet nothins like you used to coo  
Im the same old trouble that youve always been through  
So why dont you love me like you used to do  
  
Well why dont you be just like you used to be  
How come you find so many faults with me  
Somebodys changed so let me give you a clue  
Why dont you love me like you used to do  
  
Aint had no lovin like a huggin and a kissin  
In a long long while  
We dont get nearer or further or closer  
Than a country mile  
  
Why dont you say the things you used to say  
What makes you treat me like a piece of clay  
My hairs still curly and my eyes are still blue  
Why dont you love me like you used to do
