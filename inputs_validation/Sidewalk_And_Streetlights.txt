Homicide on the edge of town and no one said it be easy  
Sure has its ups and downs and Garfield is laughing  
Sitting in a dark room making love with Sylvannia  
No so called friends around cigarettes and champagne  
Gonna make me a big star oh havent you heard yet  
Dont know how its going to go too young to tell  
And if its just my name well hell I can change it  
And if its for the fame I guess I better grab it fast  
But its just a dangerous game that youre playing oow  
And you play it so well so lets play it again  
  
Sidewalks and Streetlights sure make a pretty picture  
Strangers in the night are you going my way  
You can drop me off at the corner I can walk the rest of the way  
Its not that far to the nearest star  
And if its for the money hey why cant I have it  
And if its for the glory I guess I better grab it fast  
But its just a dangerous game that youre playing oow  
And you play it so well so lets play it again oow  
Lets play it again
