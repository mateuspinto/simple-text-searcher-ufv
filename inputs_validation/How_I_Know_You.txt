I grew up in your hometown at least began to grow  
I hadnt got to my first shave before the body blow  
Egyptians in the courtyard my family in chains  
You witnessed our abduction which possibly Explains  
  
How I know you  
How I know you  
  
Before that fateful morning my family enjoyed  
A privileged existence for my father was employed  
As advisor to the king no less which surely rings a Bell  
For as you are his daughter you probably can tell  
  
How I know you  
How I know you  
  
Enough of reminiscence and such happy memories  
The reason why I know you well is really none of These  
Its just you reek of royalty you ooze uncommon Grace  
Id know you were a princess in any time and place  
  
Yes I know you  
How I know you  
Yes I know you  
How I know you
