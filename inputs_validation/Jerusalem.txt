Jerusalem Jerusalem  
He was born the King Solomon  
He was a wise and had a thousand wives  
He was a righteous and feeling judge  
He was the king and the father of the people  
Jerusalem Jerusalem  
Jerusalem Jerusalem  
Two young women came with a child  
Claiming Im the mother of this child  
He said Bring me a sword  
Divide the baby in two  
Oh in two  
Jerusalem Jerusalem  
Jerusalem Jerusalem  
The real mother cried Dont  
The other one said Divide  
Everybody knew who was really true  
Jerusalem Jerusalem  
Jerusalem Jerusalem  
How can the people divide a little child   
How can the people divide such a little heart   
Jerusalem Jerusalem
