Run run run run run run run run  
Run run run run run run run run  
You better make your face up in  
Your favorite disguise  
With your button down lips and your  
Roller blind eyes  
With your empty smile  
And your hungry heart  
Feel the bile rising from your guilty past  
With your nerves in tatters  
When the conch shell shatters  
And the hammers batter  
Down your door  
Youd better run  
  
Run run run run run run run run  
Run run run run run run run run  
You better run all day  
And run all night  
Keep your dirty feelings  
Deep inside  
And if youre taking your girlfriend  
Out tonight  
Youd better park the car  
Well out of sight  
Cause if they catch you in the back seat  
Trying to pick her locks  
Theyre gonna send you back to mother  
In a cardboard box  
You better run  
  
Hey open up  
Hammer hammer
