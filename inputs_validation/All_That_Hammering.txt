I used to think joy was the break between sorrow  
Like peace was the break between wars  
Im still partly new now but mostly older  
And I can not say Im so sure  
Chorus  
I never trusted happiness as far as I could throw it  
Always preparing for the worst cause I would know it  
All of that hammering in the dark like a new noah working on his ark  
On his ark  
I may look back at today and feel foolish  
My old view was right all along  
I will rush in where no angels are walking  
And fight for the right to be wrong  
Chorus  
cause I never trusted happiness as far as I could throw it  
Always preparing for the worst cause I would know it  
Of that hammering in the dark like a new noah working on his ark  
On his ark  
Between my potential and the deep blue sea  
Theres a rock and a diamond either side of me  
Between our potential and the break of day  
There is nothing at all in our way  
Nothing in our way
