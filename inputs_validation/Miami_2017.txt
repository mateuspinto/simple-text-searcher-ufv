Ive seen the lights go out on broadway  
I saw the empire state laid low  
And life went on beyond the palaces  
They all bought cadillacs  
Left there long ago  
  
We held a concert out in brooklyn  
To watch the island bridges blow  
It turned our power down  
And drove us underground  
But we went right on with the show  
  
Ive seen the lights go out on broadway  
I saw the ruins at life end  
You know we almost didnt notice it  
We see it all the time  
On 42nd street  
  
It burned the churches up in harlem  
Like in that spanish civil war  
The flames were everywhere  
And no one really cared  
It always burned up there before  
  
Ive seen the rats lie down on broadway  
And I watched the miami skyline fall  
The folks were waving at the battery  
The union went on strike  
They never settled it out  
  
They sent a carrier out from norfolk  
And picked the yankees up for free  
They said the queens could stay  
And threw the crowns away  
And sent manhattan out to sea  
  
She knows those lights right on broadway  
That was so many years ago  
Before we all lived in florida  
Before the mafia  
Took over mexico  
  
There are too many who remember  
They say a handful still survive  
To tell the world about  
The way the lights went out  
To keep the memory alive
