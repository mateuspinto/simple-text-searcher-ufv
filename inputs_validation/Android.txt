Hey old man in womans shoes  
I wonder if he knows I think hes crazy  
When he was young did he have dreams  
Of wearing womans shoes and being crazy  
  
It makes me wonder when I grow to be that age  
Will I be walking down the street begging for your spare change  
  
Or will I grow that old  
Will I still be around  
The way I carry on Ill end up  
Six feet underground  
And waste away  
  
When the old man was in school  
Did the golden rule make him go crazy  
Or did he hide away from hopes  
Behind a smile and smoking dope  
Its crazy  
  
It seems so frightening  
Time passes by like lightning  
Before you know it youre struck down  
I always waste my time on my chemical emotions  
It keeps my head spinning around
