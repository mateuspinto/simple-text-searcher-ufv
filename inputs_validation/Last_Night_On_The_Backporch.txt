Theres a girl Im wild about every time I take her out  
I hurry I scurry I worry so  
And we always can be found where theres no one else around  
If I lost her what a blow I love her ohwooh  
Yes I love her in the morning and I love her at night  
I love her yes I love her when the stars are shining bright  
I love her in the springtime and I love her in the fall  
But last night on the backporch I love her best of all  
Oh I love her in the morning and I love her at night  
First time that I dug this chick it was true love at first sight  
I love her in the springtime and I love her in the fall  
But last time gave her my frat pin then I loved her best of all  
Oh I love her in the springtime and I love her in the fall  
But last night Maw went shopping and then I loved her best of all
