Under the gaze of the angels  
A spectacle like hes never seen  
Spinning lights and faces  
Demon music and gypsy queens  
  
The glint of iron wheels  
Bodies spin in a clockwork dance  
The smell of flint and steel  
A wheel of fate a game of chance  
  
How I prayed just to get away  
To carry me anywhere  
Sometimes the angels punish us  
By answering our prayers  
By answering our prayers  
  
A face of naked evil  
Turns the young boys blood to ice  
The deadly confrontation  
Such a dangerous device  
  
The glint of iron wheels  
Bodies spin in a clockwork dance  
The smell of flint and steel  
A wheel of fate a game of chance  
  
Shout to warn the crowd  
Accusations ringing loud  
A ticking box in the hand of the innocent  
The angry crowd moves toward him with bad intent  
  
How I prayed just to get away  
To carry me anywhere  
Sometimes the angels punish us  
By answering our prayers  
By answering our prayers  
  
The glint of iron wheels  
Bodies spin in a clockwork dance  
The smell of flint and steel  
A wheel of fate a game of chance
