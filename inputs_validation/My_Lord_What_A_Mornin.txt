My Lord what a mornin  
My Lord what a mornin  
My Lord what a mornin  
When the stars begin to fall  
When the stars begin to fall  
  
My Lord what a mornin  
My Lord what a mornin  
My Lord what a mornin  
When the stars begin to fall  
When the stars begin to fall  
  
No more grief and pain for me  
I heard from Heaven today  
Yes my Lords gonna set me free  
I heard from Him today  
  
My Lord what a mornin  
My Lord what a mornin  
Oh my Lord what a mornin  
When the stars begin to fall  
When the stars begin to fall  
  
On my way to the promised land  
I heard from Him today  
Gods gonna give me His right hand  
I heard from Heaven today  
  
My Lord what a mornin  
My Lord what a mornin  
Oh my Lord what a mornin  
When the stars begin to fall  
When the stars begin to fall
