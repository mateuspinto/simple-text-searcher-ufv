I could cry salty tears  
Where have I been all these years  
Little wow tell me now  
How long has this been goin on  
There were chills up my spine  
And some thrills I cant define  
Listen sweet I repeat  
How long has this been goin on  
Oh I feel that I could melt  
Into heaven Im hurled  
I know how Columbus felt  
Finding another world  
Kiss me once then once more  
What a dunce I was before  
What a break for heavens sake  
How long has this been goin on
