What about sunrise  
What about rain  
What about all the things that you said  
We were to gain  
What about killing fields  
Is there a time  
What about all the things  
That you said were yours and mine  
  
Did you ever stop to notice  
All the blood weve shed before  
Did you ever stop to notice  
This crying Earth these weeping shores  
  
Ah ooh  
Ah ooh  
  
What have we done to the world  
Look what weve done  
What about all the peace  
That you pledge your only son  
  
What about flowering fields  
Is there a time  
What about all the dreams  
That you said was yours and mine  
  
Did you ever stop to notice  
All the children dead from war  
Did you ever stop to notice  
This crying earth these weeping shores  
  
Ah ooh  
Ah ooh  
  
I used to dream  
I used to glance beyond the stars  
Now I dont know where we are  
Although I know weve drifted far  
  
Ah ooh  
Ah ooh  
Ah ooh  
Ah ooh  
  
Hey what about yesterday  
What about us  
What about the seas  
What about us  
The heavens are falling down  
What about us  
I cant even breathe  
What about us  
  
What about apathy  
What about us  
Burnt despite our pleas  
What about us  
What about the holy land  
What about it  
Torn apart by creed  
What about us  
  
Where did we go wrong  
ooo ooo  
Someone tell me why  
What about us  
  
What about babies  
What about it  
What about the days  
What about us  
What about all their joy  
Do we give a damn
