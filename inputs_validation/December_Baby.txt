The colored lights they brightly shine  
Unlike your eyes avoiding mine  
The snow is folding sheet upon sheet  
Our hands not holding as we cross the street  
  
Chorus  
You have had your fill your fill of me  
You have had your fill your fill of me  
  
I wore the dress I thought you loved  
But my boots are filling with snow you shoved  
Off of the car we climb into  
You finished first I must catch up to you  
  
Chorus  
  
How can I catch up when I dont dont want to  
How can I catch up when I still want you  
  
Chorus  
  
December baby you are my  
December baby you are my  
December baby you are my  
December baby you are mine
