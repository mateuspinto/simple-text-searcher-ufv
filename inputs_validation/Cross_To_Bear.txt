  
  
  
  
You ran away with your conscience dear  
  
There was a red flag waving in my ear saying  
  
Stay away youve got something to fear  
  
Well why did I not choose to hear  
  
Well I am through with suffering  
  
Gonna make better choices I dont need no wedding ring  
  
I can sing I can dance  
  
But I cant make thus feeling cease  
  
Cause deep in my soul you left a permanent crease and  
  
  
We all got our cross to bear  
  
Our Star of David our dreadlocked hair  
  
And oh yeah baby I still care  
  
And if you need some help  
  
You know Ill always be there  
  
  
Well its been a strange year  
  
Youve been a very bad dog  
  
As my fire went out  
  
Youd put on another log  
  
But it was worth never having any peace  
  
And deep in my soul you left a permanent crease and  
  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
  
Some nights I thought Id cry forever  
  
Id wish him away and then Id turn into a beggar  
  
But it was worth always scraping my knees  
  
And deep in my soul you left a permanent crease  
  
  
I wear my heart like a wrinkle on my sleeve  
  
  
And Ive got the aching love that only you can relieve  
  
But Im not afraid to go down with a sinking friend  
  
Im gonna live out my dreams even if they kill me in the end  
  
  
Repeat chorus
