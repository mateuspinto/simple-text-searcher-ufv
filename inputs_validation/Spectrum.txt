Momentum seems to carry them  
But only for a moment  
A face that hides a thousand secrets  
Never seems to smile  
A feeling of uncertainty  
No hand to rock the cradle  
But we can hear a whispering inside  
  
Spectrum shifting  
Colours form  
The picture is changing  
Crystal calling  
Diamonds fall  
A time for creating  
Spectrum shifting  
Colours form  
The future is waiting  
  
Illusion holds a mystery  
But nothing lasts forever  
A searching for a hidden magic  
Waiting to be found  
A haunting sense of emptiness  
They hear the sound of silence  
But we can hear a whispering inside  
  
Spectrum shifting
