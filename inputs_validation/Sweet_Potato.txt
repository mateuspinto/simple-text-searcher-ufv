She cooks you sweet potato you dont like aubergine  
She knows to boil the kettle when you hum bars from grease  
She senses you are lonely but still she cant be sure  
And so she stands and waits stands anticipating  
  
How can she become the psychic that she longs to be to understand you  
How can she become the psychic that she longs to be to understand you  
  
He brushes thoroughly  
He knows she likes fresh breath  
He rushes to the station  
He waits atop the steps  
Hes brought with him a mars bar  
She will not buy nestle  
And later hell perform  
A lovelorn serenade a trade  
  
How can he become the psychic that he longs to be to understand you  
How can he become the psychic that he longs to be to understand you  
  
So give her information to help her fill her holes  
Give an ounce of power so he does not feel controlled  
Help her to acknowledge the pain that you are in  
Give to him a glimpse of that beneath your skin  
  
Now my inner dialogue is heaving with detest  
I am a martyr and a victim and I need to be caressed  
I hate that you negate me Im a ghost at beck and call  
Im failing and placating berate myself for staying  
  
Im a fool  
Im a fool  
  
He greets his stranger meekly a thing that she accepts  
She sees him waiting often with chocolate on the steps  
He senses she is lonely shes glad they finally met  
They take each others hands walk into the sunset  
  
Do you like sweet potato
