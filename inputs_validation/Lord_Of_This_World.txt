Youre searching for your mind dont know where to start  
Cant find the key to fit the lock on your heart  
You think you know but you are never quite sure  
Your soul is ill but you will not find a cure  
  
Your world was made for you by someone above  
But you chose evil ways instead of love  
You made me master of the world where you exist  
The soul I took from you was not even missed  
  
Lord of this world  
Evil possessor  
Lord of this world  
Hes your confessor now

You think youre innocent youve nothing to fear  
You dont know me you say but isnt it clear  
You turn to me in all your wordly greed and pride  
But will you turn to me when its your turn to die
