Id like to stay with you for a while but I have promises to keep  
I could be happy here with you but Im a so wild oat to reap  
My strength tells me my weakness shows you make me think of coats and ties  
Of babies home security and jobs that last from nine to five  
I could conjure up the constant state of happiness  
But I know that I am just another man  
And in knowing that I know that Ill get more or less what I can get  
So Ill do what I can  
  
I have many steps to take reckless steps I cannot share  
A mountain waits for me to climb and I must climb because its there  
I could conjure up  
  
But if you should not let me go and if you want me as I am  
And for a while Ill be a God instead of just another man mmm
