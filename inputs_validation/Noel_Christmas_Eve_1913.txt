A frosty Christmas Eve when the stars where shining  
I traveled for the home where westward falls the hill  
And for many many a village in the darkness of the valley  
distant music reached me peels of bells were ringing  
  
Then spread my thoughts to olden times to that first of Christmases  
when shepherds who were watching heard music in the fields  
And they sat there and they marveled and they knew they could not tell  
whether it were angels or the bright stars a singing  
  
But to me heard a far it was starry music  
the singing of the angels the comfort of our Lord  
Words of old that come a traveling by the riches of the times  
and I softly listened as I stood upon the hill  
And I softly listened as I stood upon the hill
