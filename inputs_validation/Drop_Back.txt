You hold my life in your hands  
You build me as if I were a king  
Your heart does not understand  
I give you my everything  
Oh the night that started with wine  
Is ending just like it was a dream  
I held her glove in my hand  
I gave her my everything  
Drop back  
She said to me go back  
Drop back  
I fail to see why I  
Should drop back  
I held the cards in my hand  
They fooled me just a pack of lies  
It seems they wrecked all my plans  
  
God knows how I really tried  
Oh that night that started with wine  
Its ending just like it was a dream  
I hold her glove in my hand  
I gave her my everything  
Drop back  
She said to me go back  
Drop back  
I fail to see why I  
Should drop back  
Drop back  
She said to me go back  
Drop back  
I fail to see why I  
Should drop back
