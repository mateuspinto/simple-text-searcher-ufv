Do you know about a day  
Thats not so very far away  
Everywhere theres orange and black  
And chills are running up your back  
  
Jackolanterns and ghosts and bats  
Witches and goblins and big black cats  
Spooky spooks come out to play  
On the thirtyfirst Halloween Day  
  
Lets pick a costume we can wear  
And all the neighbors we will scare  
When at their door we trick or treat  
And they will give us something sweet  
  
Jackolanterns and ghosts and bats  
Witches and goblins and big black cats  
Spooky spooks come out to play  
On the thirtyfirst Halloween Day  
  
Today is a super busy day at school but in between trickortreating
throughout the building visiting the haunted hallway complete with a
graveyard and celebrating at a huge party in the gym this afternoon well
find some time to squeeze in music therapy  
  
Though my feelings toward Halloween are lukewarm at best I am trying my best
to get into the spirit for the sake of those who enjoy this spooktacular day
Tonight Zach my husband and I are going to attend a Halloween party dressed
as a certain singing duo any guesses Hint if only I had an autoharp my
costume would be perfect
