When I was young  
  
I took my feelings just for fun  
I never knew how long I stay with someone  
Never really care to know  
Now times are changing  
Been through every high and low  
And falling into all affections  
But thing that is true  
Its the best thing I share with you  
  
Love is forever  
Forever in your arms  
And all I need is to hold  
Hold you like no one before  
And never let you go  
Love is forever  
  
Then I met you  
And I was feeling so alive baby  
A joy like this Ive never seen before  
In the best years of my life  
Gone all the bad times  
Never knowing where to go  
Wandring around in darkness  
Now my days are bright  
Cause youre the sunlight in my life  
  
Love is forever
