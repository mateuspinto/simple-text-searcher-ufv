It s 3 A M And you re still wide awake  
Wonderin how much more your broken heart can take  
All he left you with is shattered dreams  
I know it s hard to see right now it s not as bad as it seems  
  
You ll live to love another day  
Happiness is on it s way  
Hold on it won t be long  
I know the pain you re living in  
Sometimes you gotta lose to win  
It s ok don t you worry baby  
We all live to love another day  
  
I know you said you lost your faith in love  
But it s not written in the stars above  
I wouldn t tell you anything but the truth  
Cause I ve been where you are and I m living proof  
  
You ll live to love another day  
Happiness is on it s way  
Hold on it won t be long  
I know the pain you re living in  
Sometimes you gotta lose to win  
It s ok don t you worry baby  
We all live to love another day  
  
What s here right now didn t come to stay  
The sun s gonna rise again and the clouds will roll away  
Believe me when I say  
  
You ll live to love another day  
Happiness is on it s way  
Hold on hold on  
I know the pain you re living in  
Sometimes you gotta lose to win  
It s ok don t you worry baby  
We all live to love another day  
  
Don t you worry baby cause we all live to love another day
