Last night an angel came to me  
I was cryin alone  
My heart was bleeding  
Last night an angel came to me  
I was cryin alone  
My mind was dying  
God have mercy  
  
Stop them destroying me  
An angel came to me  
To save my life  
Listen to his voice  
Please hear his soul  
This angel came to me  
To save me  
Last night an angel came to me  
I was doing wrong  
I was doing wrong  
Last night an angel came to me  
I was sleepin wrong  
I was sleepin wrong  
  
God have mercy  
Stop them destroying me  
An angel came to me  
To forgive me  
Listen to his prayers  
Please feel his love  
This angel came to me  
God saved me  
An angel came to me  
To fulfill his prophecy  
He listened to my prayers  
Please feel my love  
This angel came to me  
I recognised him  
I recognised him

An angel  
An angel came to me
