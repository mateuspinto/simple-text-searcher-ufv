In the cool of the evening they used to gather  
Neath the stars in the meadow circling an old oak tree  
At the times appointed By the seasons  
Of the earth and the phases of the moon  
In the center stood a woman  
Equal with the others and respected for her worth  
One of the many we call the witches  
The healers and the teachers of the wisdom of the earth  
And the people grew through the knowledge she gave them  
Herbs to heal their bodies spells to make their spirits whole  
Cant ya hear them chanting healing incantations  
Calling forth the wise ones celebrating in dance and song  
 Isis Astarte Diana Hecate Demeter Kali Inanna  
There were those who came to power through domination  
And they bonded in the worship of a dead man on a cross  
They sought control of the common people  
By demanding allegiance to the church of Rome  
And the Pope declared an inquisition  
It was war against the women whose powers they feared  
In this holocaust against The Nature People  
Nine million European women died  
And the tale is told of those who by the hundreds  
Holding together chose their death in the sea  
While chanting the praises of the Mother Goddess  
A refusal of betrayal women were dying to be free  
 Isis Astarte Diana Hecate Demeter Kali Inanna  
Now the earth is a witch and the men still burn her  
Stripping her down with mining and the poisons of their wars  
Still to us the earth is a healer a teacher a mother  
A weaver of a web of light that keeps us all alive  
She gives us the vision to see through the chaos  
She gives us the courage it is our will to survive
