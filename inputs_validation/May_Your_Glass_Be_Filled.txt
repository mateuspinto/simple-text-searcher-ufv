May your family share laughter  
Your songs always play  
May your wishes come true  
Even those left unprayed  
Hand on my shoulder  
Gentle cloud on the hill  
May your hearts doors be open  
Forever and ever may your glass it be filled  
  
Like a wheel to the river  
A mothers moon and sun  
Dreams against the wind  
Oh and lifetimes undone  
Over and over  
And over again  
I was made stronger  
Forever and ever knowing you as my friend  
  
On the streams of tomorrow  
Blessed days out swim sorrows  
As we float on reawaked dreams  
  
On the streams of tomorrow  
Blessed days out swim sorrows  
As we float on reawaked dreams  
  
May your family share laughter  
Your songs always play  
May your wishes come true  
Even those left unprayed  
Hand on my shoulder  
Gentle cloud on the hill  
May your hearts doors be open  
Forever and ever may your glass be filled
