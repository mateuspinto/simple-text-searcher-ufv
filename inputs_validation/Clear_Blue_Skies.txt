I got you  
I got you  
I got you  
I got you and clear blue skies  
Never cold  
Never snow  
Nobody nobody  
Ever knows  
I got you  
I got you  
I got you  
I got you and clear blue skies  
I see you and  
I see you and  
I see you and  
I see you and clear blue skies  
Keep me warm  
Summer time  
Nobody nobody  
Be so kind  
I got you  
I got you  
I got you  
I got you and clear blue skies
