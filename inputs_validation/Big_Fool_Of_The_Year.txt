All the big fools in town got together  
Every hopeless lovin heart I know was there  
We all sat around and told our own best story  
Then they made me the big fool of the year  
  
Oh they gave to me a little golden statue  
Of the torch that I carried for you dear  
They said no one else could even come close to me  
And that I was the big fool of the year  
  
Ill put mine up beside  
Any foolish love in town  
Cause theres none can hold a light  
To this torch I carried round  
  
I cant say Im to proud of the honor  
But then I guess I do deserve it dear  
For to love you after all youve made me suffer  
Surely makes me the big fool of the year  
  
Yes youve made me the big fool of the year
