Come back proud canadians  
To before you had TV  
No hockey night in canada  
There was no CBC  
  
In 1812 madison was mad  
He was the president you know  
Well he thought hed tell the british where they ought to go  
He thought hed invade canada  
He thought that he was tough  
Instead we went to washington  
And burned down all his stuff  
  
And the white house burned burned burned  
And were the ones that did it  
It burned burned burned  
While the president ran and cried  
It burned burned burned  
And things were very historical  
And the Americans ran and cried like a bunch of little babies WaWaWa  
In the war of 1812  
  
Those hilbilies from kentucky  
Dressed in green and red  
Left home to fight in canada  
But they returned home dead  
Its the only war the yankies lost except for veitnam  
And also the alomo and the bay of ham  
The looser was america  
The winner was ourselfs  
So join right in and gloat about the war of 1812  
  
And the white house burned burned burned  
And were the ones that did it  
It burned burned burned  
While the president ran and cried  
It burned burned burned  
And things were very historical  
And the Americans ran and cried like a bunch of little babies WaWaWa  
In the war of 1812  
  
In 1812 we were just sitting around  
Minding our own business  
Putting crops into the ground  
We heard the soilders coming  
And we didnt like that sound  
So we took a boat to washington and burned it to the ground  
  
Oh we fired our guns but the yankies kept on a coming  
There wasnt quite as many as there was a while ago  
We fired once more and the yankies started running  
Down the mississippi to the gulf of mexico  
They ran through the snow  
And they ran through the forest  
They ran through the bushes where the beavers wouldnt go  
They ran so fast they forgot to take theyre culture  
Back to america and gulf and mexico  
  
So if you go to washington  
Its building clean and nice  
Bring a pack of matches  
And well burn the white house twice  
  
And the white house burned burned burned  
But the americans wont admit it  
It burned burned burned  
It burned and burned and burned  
It burned burned burned  
I bet that made them mad  
And the Americans ran and cried like a bunch of little babies WaWaWa  
In the war of 1812
