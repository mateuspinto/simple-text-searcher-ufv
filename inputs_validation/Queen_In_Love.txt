They all were there the court was full  
The king beside his queen  
His love was cold the fool will dance  
for her till end of time  
  
The queen is in love  
The queen is in love  
  
She couldnt help her burning heart  
And now hes burning too  
Their love was blind  
They will dance until the end of time  
  
Queen is in love  
Queen is in love  
  
The furious king now has learned  
He sentenced them to burn  
Forever one  
They are joined in death eternally  
  
Queen is in love  
Queen is in love
