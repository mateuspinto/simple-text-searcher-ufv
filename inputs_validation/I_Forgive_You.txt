I forgive you I forgive me  
Now when do I start to feel again  
I forgive you I forgive me  
Now when do I start to feel again  
  
Cause the lights are on  
But Im never home  
But Ill be back with a brand new attitude  
Cause I forgive you  
  
Chorus  
I forgive you  
We were just a couple of kids  
Trying to figure out how to live  
Doing it our way  
No shame no blame  
Cause the damage is done  
And I forgive you  
I forgive you  
We were busy living the dream  
Never noticed the glass ceiling falling on us  
No shame no blame  
Cause the damage is done  
And I forgive you  
  
I forgive you I forgive me  
Now do I start to feel again  
If I hate you what does that do  
So I breathe in and I count to 10  
  
Cause the lights are on  
And Im coming home  
Yes I am back  
With a new heart in my hand  
Cause I forgive you  
  
Chorus  
  
I forgive you  
For every time that I cried  
Over some stupid thing you did to hurt me  
Thats alright yeah I forgive you  
  
I forgive you  
We were just a couple of kids  
Trying to figure out how to live  
Doing it our way  
No shame no blame  
Cause the damage is done  
And I forgive you  
  
Chorus
