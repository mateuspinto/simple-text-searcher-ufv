Spirit come and change the atmosphere  
Convict all open hearts here  
The anthems that the angels sing  
The worship of the king of kings  
  
For Jesus reigns  
Over all he reigns  
  
We exalt your name  
High above the heavens  
We exalt your name  
All of creation sings praise  
  
For Jesus reigns  
Over all he reigns yeah  
  
Your presence fills and satisfies  
Tears down the walls we hide behind  
Oh god of every aching heart  
We long for you in light and dark  
  
For jesus reigns  
Over all he reigns  
  
We exalt your name  
High above the heavens  
We exalt your name  
All of creation sings praise  
All of creation sings praise  
  
For Jesus reigns  
Over all he reigns  
For Jesus reigns

High above the heavens  
We exalt your name  
All of creation sings praise  
All of creation sings praise
