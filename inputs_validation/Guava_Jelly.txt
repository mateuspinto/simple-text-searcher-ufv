You say you love me  
I say I love you  
So why dont you stop your cryin  
Dry your weeping eyes  
You know I love you  
Baby here I am  
Come rub it on my belly  
Like Guava Jelly  
Baby here I am  
Come rub it on my belly  
Like Guava Jelly  
You say you need me  
I say I need you too  
So why dont you stop your cryin  
Dry your weeping eyes  
You know I love you  
Baby here I am  
Come rub it on my belly  
Like Guava Jelly  
Baby here I am  
Come rub it on my belly  
Like Guava Jelly  
Ooh rub it baby repeated to  
Background voices  
Ooh Rub it over me  
Chorus in background  
Keep rubbin on my belly X2  
Rub it Rub Rub it  
Ooh rub it on my belly  
Keep rubbin on my belly fade
