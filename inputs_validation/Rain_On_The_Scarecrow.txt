Scarecrow on a wooden cross blackbird in the barn  
Four hundred empty acres that used to be my farm  
I grew up like my daddy did my grandpa cleared this land  
When I was five I walked the fence while grandpa held my hand  
  
Chorus  
Rain on the scarecrow blood on the plow  
This land fed a nation this land made me proud  
And son Im just sorry theres no legacy for you now  
Rain on the scarecrow blood on the plow  
Rain on the scarecrow blood on the plow  
  
The crops we grew last summer werent enough to pay the loans  
Couldnt buy the seed to plant this spring and the farmers bank foreclosed  
Called my old friend schepman up to auction off the land  
He said john its just my job and I hope you understand  
Hey calling it your job ol hoss sure dont make it right  
But if you want me to Ill say a prayer for your soul tonight  
And grandmas on the front porch swing with a  
Bible in her hand Sometimes I hear her singing take me to the promised land  
When you take away a mans dignity he cant work his fields and cows  
  
Therell be blood on the scarecrow blood on the plow  
Blood on the scarecrow blood on the plow  
  
Well theres ninetyseven crosses planted in the courthouse yard  
Ninetyseven families who lost ninetyseven farms  
I think about my grandpa and my neighbors and my name and some nights  
I feel like dying like that scarecrow in the rain  
  
Chorus  
  
Rain on the scarecrow blood on the plow  
This land fed a nation this land made me so proud  
And son Im just sorry theyre just memories for you now  
Rain on the scarecrow blood on the plow  
Rain on the scarecrow blood on the plow
