Hear whats written on the wind  
We come to kill and kill again  
Our arrows fall like hail  
Trample on the dead  Ride through the  
Gate of clouds  stand on the open step  
  
Run beserk  spreading fear and pain  
Black shield and weapons black our chain  
None can harm us  not their fire   
Iron or steel  for we have the  
Will to power  with power we will  
Kill  
  
Kill with power  die die  
Kill with power  die die  
  
To the war god Odin you will pray  
And the curse of weapons shall  
Remain On the blood of all our  
Fathers  on their weapons we now  
Swear to avenge  not lament  
Give the False ones death  
  
Kill with power  die die  
Kill with power  die die
