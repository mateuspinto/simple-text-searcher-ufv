Took my gal to the picture show just the other day  
But when I tried to hold her hand  
Heres what she had to e say  
  
Chorus  
No not now no not now no not now no not now  
No not now but maybe next week some how  
  
Walked my gal home to the door and asked her for a kiss  
But she quickly turned away and then she told me this  
  
Chorus  
  
I asked my gal to marry me reckon what she said  
She said I wouldnt marry you if all the rest were dead  
  
Chorus  
  
But she went and changed her mind how I regret that day  
Cause every since I married her heres all that she can say  
You guessed it  
  
Chorus  
  
I stayed out too late last night on a little spree  
And when I asked her to let me in heres all she said to me  
heres what she said  
  
Chorus
