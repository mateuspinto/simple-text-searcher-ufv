How do I love you well let me see  
I love you like a lyric love a melody  
Baby completely wrapped up in you  
How do I need you well cant you tell  
I need you like a penny needs a wishing well  
Baby completely wrapped up in you  
  
Chorus  
Every now and then when the world  
That were living in is crazy  
You gladly hold me and carry me through  
No one in the world has ever done  
What you do for me and Id be  
Sad and lonely if there were no you  
  
How do I love you well count the ways  
There aint a number high enough to end this phrase  
Baby completely wrapped up in you  
  
Chorus  
  
How do I love you well dont you know  
I love you about as deep as any love can grow  
Baby completely wrapped up in you
