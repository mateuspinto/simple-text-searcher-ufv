High vibration go on  
to the sun oh let my heart dreaming  
past a mortal as me  
Where can I be  
  
Wish the sun to stand still  
Reaching out to touch our own being  
Past a mortal as we  
Here we can be  
We can be here  
be here now  
Here we can be  
  
AWAKEN SUNS HIGH STREAM through AWAKEN  
GENTLE STRONG DREAMS BEGIN HERE AWAKEN  
MASS  MASS  
TOUCH STARSONGAGELESS TOUCHING  
  
Workings of man  
set to ply out historical life  
Reregaining the flower of the fruit of his tree  
All awakening all restoring you  
  
Workings of man crying out from the fires set aflame  
By his blindness to see that the warmth of his being  
is promised for his seeing his reaching so clearly  
  
Workings of man  
driven far from the path  
Rereleased in inhibitions  
So that all is left for you  
all is left for you  
all is left for you  
all this left for you now  
  
Master of things Master of light  
Songs cast alight on you All pure chance  
Hark through dark ties As exists cross divided  
That tunnel us out of sane existence In all encircling mode  
In challenge as direct Oh closely guided plan  
As eyes see young stars assemble Awaken in our heart  
  
Master of soul Master of time  
Set to touch Setting sail  
All impenetrable youth Over all of our lands  
Ask away And as we look  
That thought be contact Forever closer  
With all thats clear Shall we now bid  
Be honest with yourself Farewell farewell  
theres no doubt no doubt  
  
High vibration go on  
to the sun oh let my heart dreaming  
past a mortal as me  
Where can I be  
  
Wish the sun to stand still  
Reaching out to touch our own being  
Past a mortal as we  
Here we can be  
We can be here  
  
Like the time I ran away  
and turned around  
and you were standing close to me  
  
Like the time I ran away  
and turned around  
and you were standing close to me
