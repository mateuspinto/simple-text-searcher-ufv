Japanese bonus track  
I paid the piper with my song  
For all the times Ive done you wrong  
I watched the devil get his due  
And I knew that was for you  
It breaks my heart  
Our time has passed by telling lies  
I fall apart  
Like broken glass on shattered ice  
We gave up our love within  
To keep ourselves from giving in  
I know my world will always turn  
When you burn youll live and learn  
Like an intruder in your arms  
I never meant to do you harm  
I know my song it will remain  
All the same I feel the pain
