You know we get to ducking when we see them lights  
I catch a charge and beat it  
I pop a 30 codeine got me leaning  
Yeah yeah you know the strong dont quit  
Yeah you know my shooters dont miss  
Steady double cup in the fifth ice  
Me and my niggas be young black and rich wassup  
I got my feet up in the two seater  
Niggas stay looking but dont wanna see us  
So to the haters and true believers
