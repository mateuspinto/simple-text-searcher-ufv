Daddy was a soldier he taught me about freedom  
Peace and all the great things that we take  
Advantage of  
Once I fed the homeless Ill never forget  
I look upon thier faces as I treated them with  
Respect  
And  
  
This is my Vietnam  
Im at war  
Life keeps on dropping bombs  
And I keep score  
  
Momma was a lunitic she liked to push my buttons  
  
She said I wasnt good enough but I guess I  
Wasnt trying  
Never like school that much they tried to teach  
Me better  
But I just wasnt hearing it because I thought I  
Was already pretty clever  
And  
  
This is my Vietnam  
Im at war  
They keeps on dropping bombs  
And I keep score  
  
This is my Vietnam  
Im at war  
They keep on dropping bombs  
And I keep score  
  
What do you expect from me  
What am I not giving you  
What could I do for you to make me ok in your  
Eyes  
  
This is my Vietnam  
Im at war  
They keep on dropping bombs  
And I keep score  
  
This is my Vietnam  
Im at war  
Life keeps on dropping bombs  
And I keep score  
  
This is my Vietnam  
This is my Vietnam
