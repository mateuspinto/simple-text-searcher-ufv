A still small voice will speak to you one day  
A still small voice will call to you and say  
I am the earth the sky the brightest star on high  
The tallest tree the smallest drop of dew  
  
A still small voice one day will say to you  
The still small voice from every voice apart  
Will whisper in the language of your heart  
 I am the night the day the blessing and the way  
  
The dream that keeps a lonely heart aglow  
Once you have heard the word a still small voice will say  
Your heart will answer  
Yes I know
