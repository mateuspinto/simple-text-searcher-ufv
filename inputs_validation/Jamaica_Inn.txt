Can you patch my jeans Peggy Ann   
Just a little stitch to mend the hole  
He has torn  
If you can  
  
Maybe I got too set in my ways  
He says she reminds him of me  
When we first met  
In those early days  
  
The sexiest thing is trust  
I wake up to find  
The pirates have come  
Typing up along your coast  
How was I to know  
The pirates have come  
Between Rebeccas  
Beneath your firmaments  
I have worshiped  
In the Jamaica Inn  
In the Jamaica Inn  
  
With the gales  
My little boat was tossed  
How was I to know  
That youd sent her  
With a lantern  
To bring me in  
  
Are you positive this is a friend  
The captain grimaced  
Those are cliffs of rock ahead  
If Im not mistaken
