Unto you I whisper  
The wildest dreams  
  
In the coldness of night  
  
Shrouded in crystals  
Through a frosty dusk  
Souls of the full moon awaits  
Their shadows ablaze  
  
We are all bending  
Our tired leaves over your empty shell  
In the sign of true esteem  
Are you beloved lord  
Sighing deep under these waterfalls  
  
The birds of the sun  
Separates these dark clouds  
While the winds of winter sleeps gently around  
I am sworn to the oath  
To breathe  
  
At the waters I dwell  
The waves are still whispering  
Ancient lullabies  
I die  
While our mystic brothers still seek  
  
Under your command I will obey  
In my vision  
You are the embodiment of pure freedom  
But through my eyes you are made of stone
