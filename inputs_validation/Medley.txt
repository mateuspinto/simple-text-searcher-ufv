As I was walking down the road  
A feeling fine and larky oh  
A recruiting sergeant came up to me  
Says he youd look fine in khaki oh  
  
For the King he is in need of men  
Come read this proclamation oh  
A life in Flanders for you then  
Would be a fine vacation now  
  
That maybe so says I to him  
But tell me sergeant dearieoh  
If I had a pack stuck upon my back  
Would I look fine and cheerie oh  
  
For theyd have you train and drill until  
They had you one of Frenchies oh  
It may be warm in Flanders  
But its draughty in the trenches oh  
  
The sergeant smiled and winked his eye  
His smile was most provoking oh  
He twiddled and twirled his wee moustache  
Says he I know youre only joking oh  
  
For the sandbags are so warm and high  
The wind you wont feel blowing oh  
Well I winked at a cailin passing by  
Says I what if its snowing oh  
  
Come rain or hail or wind or snow  
Im not going out to Flanders oh  
Theres fighting in Dublin to be done  
Let your Sergeants and your Commanders go  
  
Let Englishmen fight English wars  
Its nearly time they started oh  
I saluted the Sergeant a very good night  
And there and then we parted oh  
  
As I went down to Galway Town  
To seek for recreation on the 17th of August  
Me mind being elevated  
There were passengers assembled  
  
With their tickets at the station  
And me eyes began to dazzle  
And they off to see the races  
  
With me wack fol the do fol  
The diddle idle day  
  
There were passengers from Limerick  
And passengers from Nenagh  
The boys of Connemara  
And the Clare unmarried maiden  
  
There were people from Cork City  
Who were loyal true and faithful  
Who brought home the Fenian prisoners  
From dying in foreign nations  
  
With me wack fol the do fol  
The diddle idle day  
  
And its there youll see the pipers  
And the fiddlers competing  
And the sporting wheel of fortune  
And the four and twenty quarters  
  
And theres others without scruple  
Pelting wattles at poor Maggie  
And her father well contented  
And he gazing at his daughter  
  
With me wack fol the do fol  
The diddle idle day  
  
And its there youll see  
The jockeys and  
They mounted on so stably  
The pink the blue the orange and green  
  
The colours of our nation  
The time it came for starting  
All the horses seemed impatient  
Their feet they hardly touched the ground  
The speed was so amazing  
  
With me wack fol the do fol  
The diddle idle day  
  
There was half a million people there  
Of all dominations  
The Catholic the Protestant the Jew  
The Presbyterian  
  
Yet no animosity  
Not matter what persuasion  
But failte hospitality  
Inducing fresh acquaintance  
  
With me wack fol the do fol  
The diddle idle day
