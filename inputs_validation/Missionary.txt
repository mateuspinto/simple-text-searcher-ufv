The bells ring out above my room  
And announcement of our loss  
And in the act three men decide  
An indefinite epilogue  
My letters have all gone  
A journey thats unsure  
A message that was rich  
A hand that was poor  
Oh have me breath and let me go  
Cause I dont want you to know  
Cause I dont want you to know  
Oh I dont want you want you want you  
My own description may have failed  
Torn from pictures that were saved  
Along with images from words  
That were saved and not erased  
The shelves arranged above my head  
A memory of my fears  
Blankets hold the smell of life  
And soak the many years  
Oh have me breath and let me go  
Cause I dont want you to know  
Cause I dont want you to know  
Oh I dont want you want you want you  
Oh missionary are you here  
Sun doesnt burn when the water comes  
But water doesnt come like the English rain  
They bury their heads for self defense  
A marked improvement through diligence  
We are alone against our sins  
Alone against our sins  
Alone against our sins  
Vacant rooms that are full of men  
That sit on the stools awaiting time  
Discussion leads to little sense  
They bury their heads for self defense  
We are alone against our sins  
Alone against our sins  
Alone against our sins
