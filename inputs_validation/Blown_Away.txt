When it extends itself to the point of breaking  
And deep inside you know your demons waking  
Blow it away  
In color red and redder break tomorrow  
As mother turns her back in broken sorrow  
Blow it away  
When you are all thats left  
  
Chorus  
Embrace your enemies embrace your fear  
Embrace what you disobey  
Kill what complicates you hold it near  
Blow it away  
  
Complicated overrated leaning on the reason of one  
In quiet desperation you are clinging to the safety of the gun  
In light the dark becomes illuminated fear  
In white the black becomes what you are holding near  
And deep inside your guts are turning  
Churning to the tune what youve become  
  
Chorus
