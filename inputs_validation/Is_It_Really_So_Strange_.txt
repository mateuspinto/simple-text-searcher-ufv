I left the North  
I traveled South  
I found a tiny house  
And I cant help the way I feel  
Oh yes you can kick me  
  
And you can punch me  
And you can break my face  
But you wont change the way I feel  
Cause I love you  
Oh  
  
And is it really so strange   
Oh is it really so strange   
Oh is it really so really so strange   
I say NO you say YES  
and you will change your mind  
  
I left the South  
I traveled North  
I got confused  I killed a horse  
I cant help the way I feel  
Oh yes you can punch me  
  
And you can butt me  
And you can break my spine  
But you wont change the way I feel  
Cause I love you  
Oh   
  
And is it really so strange   
Oh is it really so strange   
Oh is it really so really so strange   
I say NO you say YES  
But you will change your mind  
  
I left the North again  
I traveled South again  
And I got confused  I killed a nun  
I CANT HELP THE WAY I FEEL  
I CANT HELP THE WAY I FEEL  
I CANT HELP THE WAY I FEEL  
I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell  
  
Why is the last mile the hardest mile   
My throat was dry with the sun in my eyes  
And I realized I realized  
I could never  
I could never never never go back home again
