There is a land that I can go to  
When I have time to rest  
All the people I love are there  
And those who love me best  
  
Chorus  
Then I heard the wind  
Calling from over the sea  
Saying Ireland Ireland  
When will you be free  
Ireland Ireland  
When will you be free  
  
This land I go to when Im tired  
And need to see and walk in green  
The people who can laugh and drink  
And see things others have not seen  
  
Chorus  
  
There is another side to this pure land  
A side of blood and guilt and pain  
A side of enemy and friend  
And sorrow at the hearth side stain  
  
Chorus  
  
There is a land that I can go to  
When I have time to rest  
All the people I love are there  
And those who love me best  
  
Chorus  
  
Ireland Ireland  
When will you be free  
Ireland Ireland  
When will you be free
