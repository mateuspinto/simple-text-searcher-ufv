You seem to be inevitable to me  
Like a memory of the future  
I was and will be with you  
  
Over and over again  
I keep tasting that sweet Madeleine  
Looking back of my life now Im in  
Asking if not later then when  
  
Its taking me all of my life  
Its taking me all of my life to find you  
Its taking me all of my life  
Its taking me all of my life to find you  
Youyouyouyou  
  
You unlock the past  
So many scenes moving fast  
At last the right conclusion  
Or at least a sweet illusion  
  
Over and over again  
I keep tasting that sweet Madeleine  
Looking back of my life now Im in  
Asking if not later then when  
  
Its taking me all of my life  
Its taking me all of my life to find you  
Its taking me all of my life  
Its taking me all of my life to find you  
  
You seem to be a perfect memory  
Of the future reminding me  
How life is meant to be  
  
Over and over again  
I keep tasting that sweet Madeleine  
Looking back of my life now Im in  
Asking if not later then when  
  
Its taking me all of my life  
Its taking me all of my life to find you  
Its taking me all of my life  
Its taking me all of my life to find you  
  
Its taking me all of my life  
Its taking me all of my life to find you  
Its taking me all of my life  
Its taking me all of my life to find you  
  
Its taking me all of my life
