The time I like is the rush hour cause I like the rush  
The pushing of the people I like it all so much  
Such a mass of motion do not know where it goes  
I move with the movement and I have the touch  
  
Im waiting for ignition Im looking for a spark  
Any chance collision and I light up in the dark  
There you stand before me all that fur and all that hair  
Oh do I dare I have the touch  
  
Wanting contact  
Im wanting contact  
Im wanting contact with you  
Shake those hands shake those hands  
Give me the thing I understand  
Shake those hands shake those hands  
Shake those hands shake those hands  
  
Any social occasion its hello how do you do  
All those introductions I never miss my cue  
So before a question so before a doubt  
My hand moves out and I have the touch  
  
Wanting contact  
Im wanting contact  
Im wanting contact with you  
Shake those hands shake those hands  
Give me the thing I understand  
Shake those hands shake those hands  
  
Pull my chin stroke my hair scratch my nose hug my knees  
Try drink food cigarette tension will not ease  
I tap my fingers fold my arms breathe in deep cross my legs  
Shrug my shoulders stretch my back  but nothing seems to please  
  
I need contact  
I need contact  
Nothing seems to please  
I need contact
