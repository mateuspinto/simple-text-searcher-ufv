Come come let us return to the Lord  
Come come let us return to the Lord  
In brokenness of heart we consecrate our lives singing  
Come come let us return to the Lord  
  
With a rending of the heart  
With the bowing of a knee  
Oh we are returning  
With a prayer and with a fast  
With a song in minor key  
Lord we are repenting  
  
Even now even now  
With all of our hearts  
You may turn You may leave a blessing behind  
  
In Your mercy You will come  
In Your mercy You will come  
Surely as the rising sun  
Surely as the rising sun
