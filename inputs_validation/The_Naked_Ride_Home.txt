Just take off your clothes and Ill drive you home I said  
Knowing she never could pass on a dare  
And knowing it sounded more desperate than reckless or bold  
I just put it out there cold too far gone to care  
  
My eyes on the road she slid herself down in the seat  
And a vision of paradise swung into view  
Across those five lanes not one driver glanced over to see  
The beauty known only to me and a big rig or two  
  
On that freeway the light was receding  
Her beauty a sight so misleading  
I failed to hear the heart that was beating alone  
On the naked ride home  
  
With the trace of a smile and that defiant look in her eye  
She hurtled through space in a world of her own  
And turning aside my caress spoke of all that shed not yet done  
As if I was the doubting one who would have to be shown  
  
On that freeway the light was receding  
Her beauty a sight so misleading  
I failed to hear the heart that was beating alone  
On the naked ride home  
  
She gathered her clothes  
And ran through the yard in the dark  
Up onto the porch like a flash and inside  
Then one room at a time  
I watched every light in our house come on  
Like the truth that would eventually dawn  
Forcing me to decide  
  
But on that freeway the light was receding  
Her beauty a sight so misleading  
I failed to hear the heart that was beating alone  
On the naked ride home
