Another day another reminder that your not here with me  
I watch the snowflakes falling from the sky then I get lost in memories  
The time we tried to build a snowman the time we tried to count the stars  
Its crazy how we didnt know that wed ever be apart  
  
Chorus  
I can hear the music playing  
See the lights upon the tree  
I can feel the joy in every soul  
But for me its incomplete  
And I try my best to play the part  
But no matter what I do  
No it just dont feel like Christmas without you  
  
Another tear another regret boy that your so far away  
Can it be that it was only last year we shared that Christmas day  
Remember when we took the sleigh ride remember singing by the fire  
Theres to much thats in the daylight I keep reliving you and I  
  
Chorus  
  
Time to try to build a snowman the time we try to count the stars  
Its crazy how we didnt know that wed ever be apart  
  
I can hear the music playing  
See the lights upon the tree  
I can feel the joy in every soul but for me its incomplete  
And I try my best to play the part  
But no matter what I do  
No it just dont feel like Christmas no it just dont feel like Christmas
without you  
  
See I tried but it jut aint right without you
