Paint me a picture of two lovers show me the lovers torn apart  
  
You made me fall in love with you the dance of lovers takes two  
Somehow the music stopped and so did our love  
  
I tried to put the pieces together and I got a grip on my life  
They say theres one born every minute who has all for a lifetime  
What good is a lifetime if I cant be with you  
  
I just want to hold you just want to touch you just let me love you  
When I see your face my heart cries out for you  
I guess that fools never learn how to fall out of love  
  
I do admit I really miss you there are some things time cannot change  
And I would be a liar baby if I told you I didnt care  
cause it makes a difference baby when youre not there  
  
I just want to hold you just want to touch you just let me love you  
When I see your face my heart my heart goes crazy baby  
Its whats calling your name  
  
I just want to hold you just want to touch you I just want to hold you  
When I see your face my heart cries out for you  
I guess that fools never learn how to fall out of love
