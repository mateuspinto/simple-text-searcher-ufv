Te lucis ante terminum  
Rerum creator poscimus  
Ut solita clementia  
Sis praesul ad custodiam  
  
Before the ending of the day  
Creator of the world we pray  
That with thy wonted favour thou  
Would be our guard and keeper now  
  
Keep me as the apple of an eye  
Hide me under the shadow of thy wings  
Keep me as the apple of an eye  
Hide me hide me hide me  
  
The heaven soars with voices above  
The skies resound the power of your love  
The stars shine out your glorious light  
  
Shine through our gloom and take us on high  
  
Keep me as the apple of an eye  
Hide me under the shadow of thy wings  
Keep me as the apple of an eye  
Hide me hide me hide me  
  
Sancto Spiritu  
Rerum creator  
Sancto Spiritu  
Sancto Sancto Spiritu  
  
Te Lucis ante terminum
