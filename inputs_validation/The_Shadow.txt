Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde  
A real nice guy with a na na na na nasty side  
In trouble  
He tried to hide from himself  
Good gawd sad man  
Couldnt face up to the yin and the yang  
Everybody  
  
All of us got a shadow  
Who knows what lurks in the hearts of men  
The shadow knows  
We become what we do not what we pretend  
  
Between the intention and the expression  
Between the emotion and the response  
Falls the shadow  
  
Guitar  
Sometimes I fail to follow through  
On things that I want to do  
And other times I find myself doing the very things I hate  
  
Reverend Jimmy and Tammy Belle  
Big time pumpers with a story to sell  
Wait a minute  
Their fingers pointing at you  
Pay attention listen up  
Dont try to deny it or cover it up  
Everybody  
All of us got a shadow
