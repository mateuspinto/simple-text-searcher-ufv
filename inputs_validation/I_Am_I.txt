Beating with life you promised life  
Security happiness  
Unfortunate son cornered  
Cowering in the pit of  
Circling panes of glass that  
Surround and reveal the ever present It  
  
It is my move my every look  
Interpreting gestures  
Informing other  
Whats undercover and  
Lurking beneath my mask  
Of this years featured model  
Is this too much  
Close your eyes  
Care to look inside I am I  
  
What may appear  
Might easily be explained  
But given the situation  
Of info saturation  
What you feel can never go away  
  
Steering perception I am  
Inviting contradiction I am  
Its my insistence  
You keep your distance  
From the glare behind my stare  
So this is the way  
The game is played  
You can leave now  
But I think youll stay I am I
