I wrote a love song for the wrong girl  
I guess I had to go through hell with her  
Just to get to you  
  
People talk bad about what they dont know  
People talk bad when they cant see the truth  
Like the way my heart goes crazy when  
You walk in the room  
  
You are the sad girl who lost her rocket  
I had a dream about you about a year  
Before we fell in love  
  
You are still dragging the dream behind you  
It is all that you can see  
Even though it isnt real it looks so big  
That you cant see me  
  
You are my everything every day  
You ruin me for anybody else  
You make all the old things new  
With the sound of your voice  
And the easy way you move  
  
You are my everything every day  
You ruin me in all the right ways  
When I break down  
You make me feel strong  
When I lose my music  
You help me find a new song  
When I get my magic in a bottle  
I will spend it all to heal your world  
I will build a rocket for the girl  
  
Someday  
So please stop pushing me away  
  
You got to let go of the pain  
Baby you got to let go of the way things used to be  
  
This life gets dark sometimes  
Good things can be hard to see  
Now Im good for you  
You are perfect for me  
  
You are my everything everyday  
You ruin me for anybody else  
You make everything seem new  
With the sound of your voice  
And the easy way you move  
  
You are my everything every day  
You ruin me in all the right ways  
When I break down  
You make me feel strong  
When I lose my music  
You help me find a new song  
  
When I get my magic in a bottle  
I will spend it all to heal your world  
I will build a rocket for the girl  
I will build a rocket for the girl  
  
I will build a rocket for the girl  
I will build a rocket for the girl  
I will build a rocket for the girl  
  
Someday  
  
Someday
