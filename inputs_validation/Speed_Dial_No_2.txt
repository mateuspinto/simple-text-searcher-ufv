I dont need you anymore  
Im okay and I am sure

Yeah Im okay Im reassured  
  
And I dont need you not today  
I promise Ill call I promise Ill say

And if you ever need me Ill reciprocate  
  
Your shoulders in my pocket  
Speed dial No Two

Can you ask can you be clear  
Yes you need me I appear  
Now you are me I am here  
  
Your shoulders in your pocket  
Speed dial No Two  
Call it when you need me  
See you when I do

Call me when you need me  
Just call me when you need me  
  
Call me when you need me
