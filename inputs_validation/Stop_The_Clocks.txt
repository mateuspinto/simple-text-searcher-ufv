Stop the clocks and turn the world around  
Let your love lay me down  
And when the night is over  
Therell be no sound  
  
Lock the box and leave it all behind  
On the backseat of my mind  
And when the night is over  
Where will I rise  
  
What if Im already dead  
How would I know  
What if Im already dead  
How would I know  
  
Lost inside my head behind the wall  
Do they hear me when I call  
And when the night is over  
Where will I fall  
  
And when the fight is over  
Where will I fall  
  
What if Im already dead  
How would I know  
But if Im already dead  
How would I know  
  
Stop the clocks and turn the world around  
Let your love lay me down  
And when the night is over  
Therell be no sound  
And now the night is over  
Therell be no sound  
And now my fight is over  
Therell be no sound
