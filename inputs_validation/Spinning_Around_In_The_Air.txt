Let me give praise to your sparkling eyes  
And your coloured hair  
Let me spend ages on poetic phrases  
To show I care  
Let me go grazing on dappled green pastures  
Where youre the mare  
Let me rephrase that  
I think theres a better line there  
Spinning around in the air  
  
Let me donate something to a kids charity  
Of your choice  
For you I would willingly be a worse traitor  
Than William Joyce  
If I could sing I would sing you a song  
In Sam Cookes voice  
Let me rephrase that  
I think theres a better line there  
Spinning around in the air  
  
Are you happy now  
Say yeah yeah yeah  
Are you really happy now  
Say yeah yeah yeah  
Tell me where it hurts  
It hurts there and there and there  
Adverbs and nouns  
Juicy and round  
Spinning around in the air  
  
Are you happy now  
Say yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Are you really happy now  
Say yeah yeah yeah  
Tell me where it hurts  
It hurts there and there and there  
Adverbs and nouns  
Juicy and round  
Spinning around in the air  
  
Madam Onassis took Aris old glasses  
And put them on  
She said I see ships and she started to quip  
About old Boston  
I climbed over her just to climb upon you  
What did I do wrong  
Let me rephrase that  
I think theres a better line there  
Spinning around in the air
