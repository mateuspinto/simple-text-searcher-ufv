Ive been sitting here for many days now  
Theyve been looking for me for many days too  
From where I m sitting  
I can see their angry faces  
It s only a matter of time  
They ll be on to me  
The sirens helicopters and tings  
The bloodhounds are on my tail Oh God  
Just in minutes  
They ll be tearing me apart  
If I don t do now  
What Ive been doing all my life  
I ll be runningall my life  
  
Chorus  
I m the running man  
The fugitive  
  
Seeking political asylum is not easy down here FONT
