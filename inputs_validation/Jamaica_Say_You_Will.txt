Jamaica was the lovely one I played her well  
As we lay in the tall grass where the shadows fell  
Hiding from the children so they would not tell  
We would stay there till her sister rang the evening bell  
  
Jamaica say you will  
Help me find a way to fill these empty hours  
Say you will come again tomorrow  
  
The daughter of a captain on the rolling seas  
She would stare across the water from the trees  
Last time he was home he held her on his knees  
And said the next time they would sail away just where they pleased  
  
Jamaica say you will  
Help me find a way to fill these lifeless sails  
And stay until my ships can find the sea  
  
Jamaica was a sweet young one I loved her true  
She was a comfort and a mercy through and through  
Hiding from this world together next thing I knew  
We had brought her things down to the bay  what could I do  
  
Jamaica say you will  
Help me find a way to fill these sails  
And we will sail until our waters have run dry
