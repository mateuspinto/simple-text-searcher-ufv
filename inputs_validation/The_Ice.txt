I press on the elastic sheet Im breathing through the slice  
Are they worms or are they serpents  bubbles through the ice  
The source was quite invisible the everpresent voice  
While skating both legs tracing different shapes I made my choice  
  
Mimicking the image in whose radiance at bask  
Im tied to him or him to me with anything you ask  
None the less reluctantly reflections tumble in  
I slide with all the other on the wrong side of the skin  
  
Hes falling on the ice it cracks  
Will he plunge in and join me here  
He meets my eyes to my surprise  
He laughs in full light of my frown  
My double wants to pull me down  
  
Slipping on the friction slide my skin peels to the bone  
The flesh I leave behind is something that is not my own  
I beg my mirror image for a moment with my soul  
Hes bleeding back time to attack its me whos in control  
  
But every move I make hes got a hand up just in time  
Hes throwing several punches and hes blocking most of mine  
Defeated now I sulk and squirm in pollen and frozen mice  
Waiting calculating till next he ventures on the ice
