there used to be a time that i believed  
the soft pouring rain was just the pouring rain it wasnt me  
but every new light that wasnt shiny and bright  
well suspend the storms and the clouds in sight  
  
of an endless summer  
an endless summer  
an endless summer to be home  
  
let me go wasting time  
let me go waste my time  
  
once there was a chance that i believed you  
a kiss was just a kiss  
no matter how i missed you  
shine a light on me  
say a prayer for the relief  
  
from an endless summer  
an endless summer  
an endless summer to be home  
  
did we go on too long  
did we listen too close  
to a youth built strong  
with things children shouldnt know  
  
and the fall out from your third degrees  
of broken chairs and of pedigrees  
where the sons kill sons and the daughters stay wise  
cause when we rule everybody dies  
  
in an endless summer  
an endless summer  
an endless summer to be home  
  
let me go wasting time  
let me go waste my time  
let me go wasting time  
let me go waste my time  
  
now you can disagree  
with how i choose to live  
but freedom isnt free  
unless you learn how to give  
  
to the summer summer summer yeah  
summer summer summer yeah  
summer summer summer yeah  
summer summer summer yeah
