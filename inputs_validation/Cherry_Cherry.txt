Cherry Cherry  
Rozanda was her real name  
But Cherry was her chosen one  
Everybody said that shed soon be dead  
But Cherry replied At least I had some fun Oh yes  
  
Her eyes were like a pool of 24 karat diamonds  
I was the last in a long line of foolish men who dived in  
  
Chorus  
Cherry Cherry  
I think about you every rising sun  
Whoa Cherry Cherry  
Wherever you are I hope Ure havin fun Oh yes  
  
Tuesday was my big game  
North vs Central in basketball  
Underneath their long coats  
Cherry and the girls wore camisoles  
Every time North would run the hoop  
Cherry would flash em and they would fall  
But not as hard as I fell  
When Cherry gave me her number and told me 2 call you should call me  
  
Using all the money her boyfriend Wilbur gave her shed buy  
Anything I wanted thats why my babys so fly  
  
Chorus  
  
Do do do do do  
Me and Cherry got married  
And tried our best 2 keep it on the down low the down low  
  
I was combing her hair  
The day that Wilbur called and cussed her on the phone  
He beat her up real bad and figured I was gonna leave her  
Instead I bought a 45 and set out 2 relieve her Take him out  
If he was taken out then he could never harm another  
No sooner than I got there I was met by Cherrys mother cryin  
  
Cherry Cherry  
Every night I ask the Lord why Oh why  
Cherry Cherry  
Another victim of a suicide Why oh why  
Why  
  
Cherry Cherry  
I think about you every rising sun  
Whoa Cherry Cherry  
Wherever you are I hope Ure havin fun  
I hope Ure having fun baby  
  
Cherry Cherry  
Id give anything 2 kiss you  
Cherry Cherry  
I guess I just miss you  
Cherry
