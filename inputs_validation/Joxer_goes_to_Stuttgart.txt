It was in the year of 88 in the lovely month of June  
When the gadflies were swarming and dogs howling at the moon  
With rosary beads and sandwiches for Stuttgart we began  
Joxer packed his German phrasebook and jumpleads for the van  
  
Some of the lads had never been away from home before  
Twas the first time Whacker put his foot outside of Inchicore  
Before we left for Europe we knew wed need a plan  
So we all agreed that Joxer was the man to drive the van  
  
In Germany the autobahn twas like the Long Mile Road  
There was every make of car and van all carrying the full load  
Ford Transits and Hiaces and an old Bedford from Tralee  
With the engine overheating from longhauling duty free  
  
There was fans from Ballyfermot Ballybough and Ballymun  
On the journey of a lifetime and the crack was ninetyone  
Joxer met a Germans daughter on the banks of the river Rhine  
And he told her shed be welcome in Ballyfermot any time  
  
As soon as we found Stuttgart we got the wagons in a ring  
Sean Og got out the banjo and Peter played the mandolin  
There was fans there from everywhere attracted by the sound  
At the first Fleadh Ceoil in Europe and Joxer passed the flagon round  
  
But the session it ended when wed finished all the stout  
The air mattresses inflated and the sleeping bags rolled out  
As one by one we fell asleep Joxer had a dream  
He dreamt himself and Jack Charlton sat down to pick the team  
  
Joxer dreamt they both agreed on Packie Bonner straightaway  
And that Moran Whelan and McGrath were certainly to play  
But tempers they began to rise and patience wearing thin  
Jack wanted Cascarino but Joxer wanted Quinn  
  
The dream turned into a nightmare Joxer stuck the head on Jack  
Who wanted to bring Johnny Giles and Eamon Dunphy back  
The cock crew in the morning it crew both loud and shrill  
Joxer woke up in his sleeping bag many miles from Arbour Hill  
  
The next morning none of the experts gave us the slightest chance  
They said the English team would lead us on a merry dance  
With their Union Jacks all them English fans for victory they were set  
Until Ray Houghton got the ball and he stuck it in the net  
  
What happened next is history brought tears to many eyes  
That day will be the highlight of many peoples lives  
Joxer climbed right over the top and the last time he was seen  
Was arm in arm with Jack Charlton singing Revenge for Skibereen  
  
Now Whackers back in Inchicore hes living with his mam  
And Jack Charlton has been proclaimed an honorary Irishman  
Do you remember that Germans daughter on the banks of the river Rhine  
Well didnt she show up in Ballyfermot last week and
