Told that I was supposed to fail  
I wouldnt amount to much of nothin  
Yes I pray  
There was days I wondered if you really loved me  
But baby you feel pain  
Mama was sane when I felt like runnin away  
I couldnt take it  
Im so hinted angry with all of the world  
I couldnt keep friends just wishin youd come back and see  
My difficult times being an adolescent  
And like so many just like me without a shoulder to lean  
  
I needed you  
When I needed a father figure  
I needed you  
To stop me from makinthe wrong decisions  
At seventeen when the cold of the world got my back up against the wall  
I need I needed you  
With the hope of being sometihng special in life  
And what happens when the one that they depend on the most  
I need I needed you  
Is never there  
  
Told that I was supposed to fail  
I wouldnt amount to much of nothin

I needed you  
When I needed a father figure  
I needed you  
To stop me from makin the wrong decisions  
At seventeen when the cold of the world had my back up against the wall  
When temptation was calling me didnt know which way to go  
I needed you  
I need I needed you  
I needed you  
I need I need you  
Seventeen when the cold of the world had my back up against the wall  
When temptation was calling me didnt know which way to go  
  
Mama had no financial help  
And thoughts of breakin the law came  
Seein her tryna hold down two jobs was tearin up on me had a way had a
way  
All my friends was gettin in it  
It came time for me to get that dough  
Wrong or right I had to go for what I know  
  
I needed you  
When I needed a father figure  
I needed you  
To stop me from makin the wrong decisions  
At seventeen when the cold of the world had my back up against the wall  
When temptation was calling me didnt know which way to go  
I needed you  
I need I needed you  
I needed you  
I need I need you  
Seventeen when the cold of the world had my back up against the wall  
When temptation was calling me didnt know which way to go  
  
An Lord I pray  
Give me strength to forgive them and not hold all the Ive hate I got  
Even though the pains from this was too heavy  
Lord I pray  
Show my younger brothers growin up without a father how to turn what they
have less into a legacy  
Lord I pray  
  
From the knowledge I aint get  
God you gave me  
And temptations was callin me didnt know which way to go  
  
I needed you  
When I needed a father figure  
I needed you  
To stop me from makin the wrong decisions  
At seventeen when the cold of the world had my back up against the wall  
When temptation was calling me didnt know which way to go
