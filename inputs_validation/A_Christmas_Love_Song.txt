All I want for Christmas is you  
Your the gift thats made my dreams all come true  
All I need for Christmas is here  
Finding every sweet surprise wrapped up in your eyes  
Waiting there for me underneath the tree  
Well the spend the day exchanging kisses  
Smile and say What a Christmas this is  
Long before the snowflakes appear  
Without bells or mistletoe or the tinsel silver glow  
You just look at me and Oh  
Christmas is here  
  
We will smile and say What a Christmas  
This is  
Long before the snowflakes appear  
Without bells or mistletoe  
Or the tinsel silver glow  
You just have to look at me and Oh  
Christmas is here
