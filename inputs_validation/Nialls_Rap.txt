In West Philadelphia I was born and raised  
On the playground is where I spent most of my days  
Chillin out maxin relaxin all cool  
And all shootin some bball outside of the school  
  
When a couple of guys who where up to no good  
Started makin trouble in my neighborhood  
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared  
And said Youre movin with your auntie and uncle in bell air
