You talk about your woman  
I wish you could see mine  
You talk about your woman  
I wish you could see mine  
Every time she starts to lovin  
She brings eyesight to the blind  
  
You know her daddy gave her magic  
I can tell by the way she walks  
You know her daddy gave her magic  
I can tell by the way she walks  
Every time we start shakin  
The dumb begin to talk  
  
Shes got the power to heal you never fear  
Shes got the power to heal you never fear  
Just a word from her lips  
And the deaf begin to hear
