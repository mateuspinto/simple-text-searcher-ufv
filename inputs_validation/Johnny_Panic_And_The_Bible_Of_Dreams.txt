I dream of heaven  
I dream of heaven  
I dream of heaven yeah  
  
High time we made a stand and shook up the views of the common man  
And the love train rides from coast to coast  
DJs the man we love the most  
Could you be could you be squeaky clean  
And smash any hope of democracy  
As the headline says youre free to choose  
Theres egg on your face and mud on your shoes  
One of these days theyre gonna call it the blues

I get excited by the news of today  
What seems unstable may be able to stay  
Johnny Panic  
Johnny Panic and The Bible Of Dreams  
  
I dream of heaven yeah  
  
I spy tears in their eyes  
They look to the skies for some kind of divine intervention  
Food goes to waste  
So nice to eat so nice to taste  
Politician Grannie with your high ideals  
Have you no idea how the Majority feels   
So without love and a promise land  
Were fools to the rules of a government plan  
Kick out the style Bring back the jam  
Bring back the jam  
  
My flame is heart My baby do as she please  
What good is living when you live in disease  
Johnny Panic  
Johnny Panic and The Bible Of Dreams  
  
I dream of heaven its a heavenly place  
Why fall in love when you can fall from grace  
With Johnny Panic  
Johnny Panic and The Bible Of Dreams  
  
I dream of heaven  
I dream of heaven  
I dream of heaven yeah
