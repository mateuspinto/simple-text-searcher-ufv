I have been ringing your doorbell  
But you left me standing in the hall  
And you make love by the numbers  
That doesnt mean theres any love at all  
Now there you go with a big explanation  
Why do you waste your time  
And there you go under estimation  
Of the thoughts that cross my mind  
This is your promise that you put up for sale  
Its done like a picture from a fairy tale  
But still theres a difference let me show it to you  
This is crapola this is shinola  
I see youre still in the headlines  
You pegged the latest trend again this week  
Im not impressed by the outfit  
Or your revolutionary chic  
And here it comes  
I see you forming the words youre performing the exercise  
And here it comes  
Its the feeling that I heard the same speech a hundred times  
This is the jabber of a chimpanzee  
The motion of your mouth looks much the same to me  
The differentiation might be hard to see  
But this is crapola this is shinola  
Everyones talking few of them know  
The rest are pretending they put on a show  
And if theres a message I guess this is it  
Truth isnt easy the easy parts shit  
And here it comes  
Now Im forming the words Im performing the exercise  
And here it comes  
Its the feeling that Ive made the same speech a million times  
These are your leaders come on take a look  
Theyll lie and cheat and steal then sell the rights to the book  
And these are your neighbors who have swung to the right  
But you dont have to worry just as long as youre white  
And my generation is just waiting to die  
Well swallow anything if it would just get us high  
I dont know whos a bigger fool  
But one thing I know  
This is crapola this is shinola
