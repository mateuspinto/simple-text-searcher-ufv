As a young man I went riding out on the western plain  
In the state of North Dakota I met my Nellie Kane  
I met my Nellie Kane  
  
She was living in a lonely cabin with a son by another man  
Five years she had waited for him as long as a woman can  
As long as a woman can  
  
I dont know what changed my mind  
Til then I was the rambling kind  
The kind of love I cant explain  
That I had for Nellie Kane  
  
She hired me on to work that day to help her till the land  
In the afternoon we planted seeds in the evening we held hands  
In the evening we held hands  
  
Her blue eyes told me everything a man could want to know  
It was then I realized that I would never go  
That I would never go  
  
Now many years have gone by and her son has grown up tall  
I became a father to him and she became my all  
She became my all
