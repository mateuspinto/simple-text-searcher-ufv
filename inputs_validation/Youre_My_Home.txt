When you look into my eyes  
And you see the crazy gypsy in my soul  
It always comes as a surprise  
When I feel my withered roots begin to grow  
  
Well I never had a place  
That I could call my very own  
But thats all right my love  
Cause youre my home  
  
When you touch my weary head  
And you tell me everything will be all right  
You say use my body for your bed  
And my love will keep you warm throughout the night  
  
Well Ill never be a stranger  
And Ill never be alone  
Wherever were together  
Thats my home  
  
Home could be the Pennsylvania turnpike  
Indianas early morning dew  
High up in the hills of California  
Home is just another word for you  
  
Well I never had a place that I could call my very own  
But thats all right my love cause youre my home  
  
If I travel all my life  
And I never get stop and settle down  
Long as I have you by my side  
Theres a roof above and good walls all around  
Youre my castle youre my cabin  
And my instant pleasure dome  
I need you in my house  
Cause youre my home  
Youre my home
