Sweet 17 in summertime  
Drunk on elderberry wine  
Laughing in the cornfields  
And taking our sweet time  
  
The world was ours together  
And all the things we had  
Were cast up in the future baby  
How could things turn out bad  
  
Now I aint waiting for  
Those days to return  
You showed me what love was  
I had such a lot to learn  
  
Hey baby  
I never knew a love so fine When you were mine  
Sweet darling  
When you were mine When you were mine  
  
7 Days a week  
365 a year  
We tripped the wild fantastic edge  
The truth was always clear  
  
They could never tame our wild hearts  
Or stop us making love  
We were so inseparable  
We could never get enough  
  
And it seems like only yesterday  
You made my world turn  
And these days I think about ya  
The fire still burns  
  
Hey baby  
I never knew a better time When you were mine  
Sweet darling  
When you were mine When you were mine  
  
Alright  
Everything we had was so complete  
And all our young hearts wanted was to be swept off our feet  
Yeah  
  
When you were mine  
In summertime  
I know theres no sense in looking back  
But everytime I think of it baby  
  
I just have to laugh  
Yeah well maybe just sometimes  
On my own  
Looking at my watch and thinking how times flown  
  
Come back baby  
Like summer time  
And we can break a bottle of that elderberry wine  
Hey baby  
  
I never knew a better time When you were mine  
Sweet darling yeah  
When you were mine When you were mine  
Hey darling  
  
Come back to me one more time When you were mine  
Sweet darling  
When you were mine When you were mine  
Everything was good  
  
Everything was fine  
When you were mine When you were mine  
When you were mine baby When you were mine  
Come back just like summertime  
  
In the summertime
