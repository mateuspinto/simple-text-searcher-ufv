Your a roxette  
Undeniable  
Unobtainable  
Is what you are  
In a word  
Indestructible  
Your a cannonball  
Your a star  
  
Gettin wild  
Gettin free  
Gettin touched  
Cant you see  
Gettin first gallantry  
Get your hands off of me  
  
Chorus  
Hallucinate  
Its in your head  
Hallucinate  
In every word you say  
Hallucination  
Hallucinate  
Its more than you can take  
  
Its the way you act  
Its the way you feel  
In your Cadillac  
In your car  
Cause the sheer you wear  
Anything you dare  
Like a superstar  
Is what you are  
  
Let it loose  
Let it go  
Be the last to know  
Get it back  
Get on track  
Be the first to crow  
  
Chorus  
  
Gettin wild  
Gettin free  
Gettin touched  
Cant you say  
Gettin first gallantry  
Get your hands off of me  
  
Chorus  
  
Hallucinate  
Its in your head  
Hallucinate  
In every word you say  
Hallucination  
Hallucinate  
Hallucinate  
Its more than you can take  
  
Hallucinate  
Hallucination  
Hallucinate  
Hallucination  
Hallucinate  
Hallucination  
Hallucinate  
Hallucination
