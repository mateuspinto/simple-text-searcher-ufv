Hello Im Johnny Cash  
One night I had a backstage pass  
To a Willie Nelson show  
There were wackoes and weirdoes and dingbats and dodoes  
And athletes and movie stars and David Allan Coe  
There was leather and lace and every minority race  
With a backstage pass to the Willie Nelson show  
Kristofferson got an offer for a movie  
Promoters closed another deal or two  
Waylon got a call from his son Shooter  
And he went home the minute he was through  
I moved with the mob at intermission  
To the green room where you see who you can see  
There were hasbeens and wouldbes and neverweres  
Paupers punks and millionaires and me  
And there were wackoes and weirdoes and dingbats and dodoes  
And athletes and movie stars and David Allan Coe  
There was leather and lace and every minority race  
With a backstage pass to the Willie Nelson show  
Hells Angels blocked the traffic to the building  
In order for the beer truck to come through  
And waitin in the wings to sing with Willie  
Were hopeful stars of flickering magnitude  
There was a singer Willie knew back in the fifties  
Who once paid him fifty dollars for a song  
There were women who once did and some who still would  
I heard one ask Did Connie come along  
And there were wackoes and weirdoes and dingbats and dodoes  
And athletes and movie stars and David Allan Coe  
Leather and lace and every minority race  
With a backstage pass to the Willie Nelson show  
I wish you couldve been there  
But maybe you were
