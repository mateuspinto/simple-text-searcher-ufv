I am a lonely visitor  
I came to late to cause a stir  
Though I campaigned all my life  
Towards that goal  
I hardly slept the night you wept  
Our secrets safe and still well kept  
Where even Richard Nixon has got soul  
Even Richard Nixon has got  
Soul  
  
Traffic cops are all color blind  
People steal from their own kind  
Evening comes to early for a stroll  
Down neon streets the streaker streaks  
The speaker speaks  
But the truth still leaks  
Where even Richard Nixon has got soul  
Even Richard Nixon has got it  
Soul  
  
The podium rocks in the crowded waves  
The speaker talks of the beautiful saves  
That went down long before  
He played this role  
For the hotel queens and the magazines  
Test tube genes and slot machines  
Where even Richard Nixon got soul  
Even Richard Nixon has got it  
Soul  
  
Hospitals have made him cry  
But theres always a free way in his eye  
Though his beach just got  
Too crowded for his stroll  
Roads stretch out like healthy veins  
And wild gift horses strain the reins  
Where even Richard Nixon has got soul  
Even Richard Nixon has got  
Soul  
  
I am a lonely visitor  
I came to late to cause a stir  
Though I campaigned all my life  
Towards that goal
