Oh my love  
If I had my way then all your dreams  
Would come true  
Oh my love  
All your dreams and all the world  
Just for you  
Oh my love  
If I had my way  
This for you  
  
Spread yourself across my lips  
And I spoon you in  
The sweetest thing in all the world  
Oh I want more  
There is no place Id rather be than here with you  
Under the sun the pouring rain all the sky for you  
  
Oh my love  
If I had my way  
This for you  
Oh my love  
Make your belly full  
And all your dreams to come true
