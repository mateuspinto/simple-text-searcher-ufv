Listen baby  
  
You need direction love and affection  
Someone to be there a man that truly cares  
Put your trust in me and I will set you free  
I know of a better place  
And I happen to be going that way  
  
Chorus x 2  
Take a ride with me baby  
On a highway that leads to love  
Come with me sail free under the sky way  
Just both of us  
  
Relax enjoy the ride  
Cause soon we will be there  
Leave troubles way behind  
Cause joy is waiting there  
So hold on to my hand  
Picture us on a island  
Making love on the pouring rain  
You and me will be like cast away  
  
Chorus  
  
Soon well reach our destiny  
Once were there well know were free  
Your body screaming as we lay  
Girl our love take us away  
  
Chorus
