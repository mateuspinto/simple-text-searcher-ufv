Follow me down  
Swallow it down  
A little bit of something instigating your frown  
The moon on the town the blood on your gown  
Youre always picturesque  
Stomp the haunted mood in your crown  
I used to think about it then I  
Chose the word indulgence now I  
Just need some more to stand my own  
Why I live this way  
Who knows  
Why I live this way  
He knows  
Is this damnation  
Or a beginning  
Ill take B  
Is this damnation  
Or a beginning  
Ill take B  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
So once again the thought into my  
And visualize the blood as the life  
Is to bend the wheel of my own kind  
I wish youd see the hope in my eye  
All in all sublime on this side  
Then again youd have to leave this life  
 Behind  
Why I live this way  
Who knows  
Why I live this way  
He knows  
Is this damnation  
Or a beginning  
Ill take B  
Is this damnation  
Or a beginning  
Ill take B
