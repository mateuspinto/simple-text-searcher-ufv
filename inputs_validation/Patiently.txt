Patiently  
You slipped away from me  
Its not alright  
You couldnt put up no fight  
  
But patiently  
The well ran dry  
You needed more water  
You needed more  
  
But patiently  
You slipped away from me  
Oh God I want you back  
Oh God I miss you my friend  
Oh so patiently  
  
Patiently  
I went home that night  
And I sat down to write  
But I couldnt think of anything to write that night  
  
Patiently you took it all with you  
The sun the moon the stars  
Are nothin without you  
But patiently  
  
You slipped away  
Oh God we want you back  
Oh God we miss you our friend  
Oh so patiently  
  
You fell into silence  
I hate all this silence  
It leaves me patient  
And this patience has breeded such violence  
Oh I hate all this violence  
Oh God we miss you our friend  
But so patiently  
  
I will never forget it  
As long as I live  
The feel that went through the bar  
Youre not there  
  
Pick up the phone  
They told me you were gone  
I wish I wish I was dreaming  
But Im wide awake  
  
When we got to her house  
Everybody was there  
Amazes me how you can bring us all together  
Patience you leave me here  
  
How can you expect me to thrive  
Patiently oh I wait fot you  
Theres not life unless youre alive  
This patience this patience this patience  
  
Is silence  
This patience this silence oh this silence  
We love you our friend wait so patiently
