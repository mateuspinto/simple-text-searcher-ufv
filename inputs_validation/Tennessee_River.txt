I was born across the river in the mountains where I call home  
Lord times were good there dont know why i ever roamed  
  
Chorus  
Oh Tennessee river and a mountain man we get together anytime we can  
Oh Tennessee river and a mountain man we play together in mother natures  
  
Band  
  
Me and my womans done made our plans on the Tennessee river walkin hand in  
Hand  
Gonna raise a family lord settle down where peace and love can still be  
Found  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh Tennessee river  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh Tennessee river
