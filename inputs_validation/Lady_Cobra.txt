Well I met girl named Lady Cobra  
Her black heart beats screams sinning clover  
She gives me chills and fever blisters  
Shes serving spells and voodoo shakes  
  
She just wants to get me high  
Stick a needle in my eye  
Reeks like a loss to temptation  
Living on my inner demons  
  
I dont wanna suicide  
I dont want this to end  
I just wanna be your friend  
  
Cuddle up with me real tight  
Talk to me by candlelight  
Do you wanna play a game of twister  
Like a dirty old man with a babysitter  
  
I dont wanna suicide  
I dont want this to end  
I just wanna be your friend  
  
I dont wanna make you cry  
Cross my heart and hope to die  
Drawin blood and lonely stars  
Drink and kiss for cheap guitars  
  
I dont wanna suicide  
I dont want this to end  
I just wanna be your friend  
Ah your friend
