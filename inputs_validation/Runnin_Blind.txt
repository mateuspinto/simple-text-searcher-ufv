First you say one thing then you say another  
I dont know the difference were you lyin to me baby  
But it seems to me you got yourself in a bind  
  
Always on the road playin your guitar  
Leaving me at home for cryin out loud  
Wish you could see babe that youre runnin blind yeah  
  
Change is comin no more runnin  
Change is comin no more runnin  
  
Well its time for you to play all that you can say  
Is Get out of my way Dont be in the way  
Always hear you screamin  
I know youre just dreamin of leavin it all behind  
  
Hands keep goin up and down  
Eyes are turnin around and around  
Your goin crazy and nobody minds  
  
Change is comin no more runnin  
Change is comin no more runnin  
Change is comin no more runnin  
Change is comin no more runnin  
  
Oooooo You cant go on runnin blind  
  
Change is comin no more runnin  
Change is comin no more runnin  
Change is comin no more runnin  
Change is comin no more runnin
