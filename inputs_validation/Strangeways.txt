Strangeways  
Strange strange  
  
I was born into confusion  
My mother said to me  
When you become a man youll understand  
But its still a mystery  
And if you want to get ahead  
Get some decent clothes  
The only way to make it  
Dress the part  
That gets right up my nose  
  
And I think to myself in this river of doubt  
This is something I can do without  
But strangeways is what I got  
  
The indians are coming Isaw it on tv  
Theyre 20000 strong  
But they always get depleted by the cavalry  
Salvation is at hand  
Its guaranteed  
Just send a donation straight to God  
1800 toll free  
  
And I think to myself in this academy of fear  
Where am I going what am I doing here  
But strangeways is all I got  
  
Have you seen the headlines  
Princess engaged  
3 million out of work  
But thats on the 2nd page  
The alien has landed  
Finger in his ear  
Cant hear a word I am saying  
But that aint such a bad idea  
  
And I think to myself in this cradle of lust  
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust  
But strangeways is all you get
