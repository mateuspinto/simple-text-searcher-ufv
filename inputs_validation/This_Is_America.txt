This Is America  
Words by Ray Boltz Music by Steve Millikan and Ray Boltz  
Wherever I roam  
This is my home  
Chorus  
This is America  
This is the land I love  
Sweet liberty  
Land of the free  
Home of the brave  
And when the day is through  
Give me the red the white and the blue  
Wherever I roam  
This is my home  
This is America  
There are some things  
Id like to show you  
In this country that I love  
Like the rivers and the valleys  
And the mountains high above  
The faith of a common people  
Who are not ashamed to say  
We still believe In God We Trust  
In the usa  
Chorus  
America America  
God shed His grace on thee  
And crown thy good with brotherhood  
From sea to shining sea  
Chorus repeat
