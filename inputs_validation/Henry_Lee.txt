Get down get down little henry lee  
And stay all night with me  
You wont find a girl in this damn world  
That will compare with me  
And the wind did howl and the wind did blow  
La la la la la  
La la la la lee  
A little bird lit down on henry lee  
I cant get down and I wont get down  
And stay all night with thee  
For the girl I have in that merry green land  
I love far better than thee  
And the wind did howl and the wind did blow  
La la la la la  
La la la la lee  
A little bird lit down on henry lee  
She leaned herself against a fence  
Just for a kiss or two  
And with a little penknife held in her hand  
She plugged him through and through  
And the wind did roar and the wind did moan  
La la la la la  
La la la la lee  
A little bird lit down on henry lee  
Come take him by his lillywhite hands  
Come take him by his feet  
And throw him in this deep deep well  
Which is more than one hundred feet  
And the wind did howl and the wind did blow  
La la la la la  
La la la la lee  
A little bird lit down on henry lee  
Lie there lie there little henry lee  
Till the flesh drops from your bones  
For the girl you have in that merry green land  
Can wait forever for you to come home  
And the wind did howl and the wind did moan  
La la la la la  
La la la la lee  
A little bird lit down on henry lee
