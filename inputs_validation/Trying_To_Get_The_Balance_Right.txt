We dont always live in harmony  
And often there are times when we are enemies  
I fight with you and you fight with me  
Trying to get the balance right  
Sometimes we cause each other pain  
Sometimes our wills are not the same  
And often we tire of the strain  
Trying to get the balance right  
Chorus  
Like a circus pair  
Hight up in the air  
Working on their act  
We need that kind of pact  
High above the ring  
Watch them balancing  
See how they unite  
We too can get it right  
We dont always seem to get along  
And one of us often acts too strong  
Sometimes we find were goin wrong  
Trying to get the balance right  
Chorus  
We dont always live in harmony  
And often there are times when we are enemies  
But I love you and you love me  
When we get the balance right  
When we get the balance right  
We can get the balance right
