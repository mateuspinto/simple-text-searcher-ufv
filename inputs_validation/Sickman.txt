What the hell am I  
Thousand eyes a fly  
Lucky then Id be  
In one day deceased  
  
Sickman sickman sickman  
I can feel the wheel but I cant steer  
When my thoughts become my biggest fear  
Ah whats the difference Ill die  
  
In this sick world of mine  
What the hell am I  
Leper from inside  
Inside wall of peace  
  
Dirty and diseased  
Sickman sickman sickman sickman  
I can see the end is getting near  
I wont rest until my head is clear  
  
Ah whats the difference Ill die  
In this sick world of mine  
Can you see the end  
Choke on me my friend  
  
Must to drown these thoughts  
Purity over rot  
Yeah though I walk through the valley of rape and despair  
With head high and eyes alert  
  
I tread on a plane of many  
We who are of good nature and intention  
But cannot touch on the dark  
Recesses of memory  
  
And pain learned so come walk  
With me feel the pain  
And release it  
What the hell am I  
  
Worn eroded pride  
Saddened 10 miles wide  
Im gonna let it slide  
Sickman sickman sickman sickman  
  
I can feel the wheel but I cant steer  
When my thoughts become my biggest fear  
Ah whats the difference Ill die  
In this sick world of mine  
  
Ahh etc etc
