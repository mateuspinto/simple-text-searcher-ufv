Goodbye is a dangerous game to play  
It breaks your heart and tears your life away  
You say its over and thats the end  
With no last kiss and no kind words like friends  
  
But Im gonna wait my time  
I will stand in line  
And it will work out fine  
And our love will grow  
Because I know  
Baby yes I know  
  
Everything that comes around goes around  
And everything that goes around comes around someday  
Everything that comes around goes around  
And everything that goes around comes around someday  
  
Dyou think about me now and then  
And wonder were you wrong and what might have been  
And seasons come and seasons go  
And what goes up comes down and baby soon youll know  
  
Im gonna wait my time  
I will stand in line  
And it will turn out fine  
And our love will grow  
Because I know  
Baby yes I know  
  
Everything that comes around goes around  
Everything that goes around comes around someday  
Everything that comes around goes around  
Everything that goes around comes around someday  
  
So you can go and leave me now  
You see it dont make any difference  
Go on and leave me now  
Cause youll be back sometime in my life  
There may be some other ones  
And you might think some better ones  
  
But if I wait my time  
If I stand in line  
It will turn out fine  
And our love will grow  
Because I know  
Baby yes I know  
  
Everything that comes around goes around  
And everything that goes around comes around someday  
Everything that comes around goes around  
Everything that goes around comes around someday  
  
Everything that comes around everything goes around Im gonna be here  
Babe  
Everything that goes around comes around someday  
Everything that comes around goes around  
Everything that goes around comes around someday  
  
So let it turn around  
  
Everything that comes around goes around  
Everything that goes around everything comes around someday someday  
Everything that comes around goes around ohohaaah  
Everything that goes around comes around someday yeah
