Legendary hearts  
Tearing up apart  
With stories of their love  
Their great transcendent loves  
While we stand here and fight  
And lose another night  
Of legendary love  
  
Legendary loves  
Haunt me in my sleep  
Promises to keep  
I never should have made  
I cant live up to this  
Im good for just a kiss  
Not legendary love  
  
Romeo oh Romeo wherefore art thou Romeo  
Hes in a car or at a bar  
Or churning his blood with an impure drug  
Hes in the past and seemingly lost forever  
  
He worked hard at being good  
But his basic soul was stained not pure  
And when he took his bow  
No audience was clapping  
  
Legendary hearts  
Tear us all apart  
Make our emotions bleed  
Crying out in need  
No legendary love  
Is coming from above  
Its in this room right now  
  
And youve got to fight  
To make whats right  
Youve got to fight  
To make whats right  
Youve got to fight  
To make whats right  
Youve got to fight to keep your legendary love
