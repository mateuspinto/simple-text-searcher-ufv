Im gonna tell you a story bout Mary Lou  
You know the kind of woman make a fool of you  
She make a young man itch  
She man an old man faint  
The way she took my money was a crying shame  
Mary Lou she took my watch and chain  
Mary Lou she took my diamond ring  
Mary Lou she took the keys to my cadillac car  
Jumped in my kitty and drove off far  
  
Left me stranded in Kalamazoo  
Making her fortune off a fool like you  
She married a rich man  
Had a dozen kids  
Drove that cat until he flipped his lid  
  
Come back into town about a week ago  
Told me she was sorry that she hurt me so  
I had a fiftyfive Ford and a two dollar bill  
The way she looked at that man gave me a chill  
Mary Lou
