Seeing you walk right by me  
Makes me think you really love me  
Tell me why is this going on  
If you love me then please tell me  
Is this unordinary  
Is this extrordinary  
Just please Tell me Dont go  
Seeing the same places everyday  
Let me go somewhere that I never been before  
This is just more  
Of my  
  
Chorus  
Everyday life  
Seeing you everyday  
Going to band on Mondays  
With no limit anyomre  
But nothing more than my  
Everyday life  
Partyin on Wednesday nights  
Going to my car on Friday mornings  
Like an everyday story  
  
Just go by the sound of my drummer drumming  
And the sounds of the guitars slamming  
Just You should know  
Sweetly walking to my locker  
Open it up to find a note  
Heres what he wrote  
Girl I know you want me  
If you do come and get me  
Be at the park by sundown  
When nobody else is around  
Be there if you want me   
Signed no name  
By the look in my eyes  
I could tell it was him  
He stared at me with a grin  
  
Chorus  
This is my everyday life  
Going through my pages  
Through the good and the bad times  
Why are you sayin to me  
This aint your everyday life girl  
Your everyday life is you and me  
My everyday life  
  
Why go thorugh the pain  
When the love and sorrows just gonna drain  
Now this is my everyday life
