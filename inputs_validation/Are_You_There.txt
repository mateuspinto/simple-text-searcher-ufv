The day we lost our voice with little choice I cant explain  
An act of agony  
And someone told me too that its true when you call aloud  
Its only destiny  
Or is it mystery  
But then we came around and sang our song and acted proud  
And posed for memory  
  
We made a cry to the underground  
Are you there  
I looked and saw that they were still around  
But do you care  
  
I drank a little bit so underlit to see it now  
The show was never seen  
And all the time I lost is never lost  
Its only thumbing through eternity  
  
We made a cry to the underground  
Are you there  
I looked and saw that they were still around  
But do you care  
  
Who are you going to see  
What are you going to be  
  
You made a cry to the underground  
Are you there  
I looked and saw that they were still around  
But do you care  
  
Are you there are you there  
Are you there are you there  
Are you there are you there  
Are you there are you there  
Are you there are you there  
Are you there are you there
