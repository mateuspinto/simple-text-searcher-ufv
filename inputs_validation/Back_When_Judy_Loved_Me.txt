There was backstreets of Birmingham  
Taking my clothes and my food and a trash can  
Sleeping in alleys at night making love to a bottle of wine  
Cause you know life is to succeed  
But that was back when Judy loved me  
Somewhere in yesterday seems a million miles away  
  
Back in the days Judy used to beg me to take her away  
But I was too young and livin was fun  
I didnt know how time would change me  
Life slid by me too fast the fun didnt last  
Its too late to get back to the days when Judy loved me  
  
Riding a freight train goin nowhere  
Dont use mirrors anymore they show my grey hair  
Giving my place in the welfare line  
Trading my soup for a bottle of wine  
Cause you know life is to succeed  
But that was back when Judy loved me  
  
Somewhere in yesterday seems a million miles away  
Back in the days Judy used to beg me to take her away  
But I was too young and livin was fun  
I didnt know how time would change me  
  
Life slid by me too fast the fun didnt last  
Its too late to get back to the days when Judy loved me  
Back when Judy loved me  
Back when Judy loved me
