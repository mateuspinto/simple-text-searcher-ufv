I took you for granted  
So many years  
I gave you no hope  
Broken promises and tears  
But when I was down  
It was you who was there  
To pick up the pieces and show me you care  
  
Forever together  
Til death do we part  
Forsaking all others  
Ill give you my heart  
Through good times and bad times  
Wherever we are  
Forever together  
In each others arms  
  
You seem to know  
What we had all along  
And you had the love  
And the faith to go on  
It took some time but now I realize  
That I see it all when I look in your eyes  
  
Forever together  
Til death do we part  
Forsaking all others  
I give you my heart  
Through good times and bad times  
Wherever we are  
Forever together  
In each others arms  
Forever together  
In each others arms
