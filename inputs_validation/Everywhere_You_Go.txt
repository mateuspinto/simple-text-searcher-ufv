Everywhere you go sunshine follows you  
Everywhere you go skies are always blue  
Children love you they seem to know  
You bring roses out of the snow  
The whole world says hello  
Everywhere you go  
  
Cheeks like the roses  
Teeth like the pearl  
Eyes with the heavens blue  
  
You made me love you  
Im in a whirl  
  
You wonderful marvelous beautiful girl  
  
Everywhere you go sunshine follows you  
Everywhere you go skies are always blue  
Children love you they seem to know  
You bring roses out of the snow  
The whole world says hello  
Everywhere you go  
  
Children love you they seem to know  
  
You bring roses out of the snow  
The whole world says hello  
Everywhere you go  
  
The whole world says hello  
  
Hello  
  
Everywhere you go  
  
Everywhere you go
