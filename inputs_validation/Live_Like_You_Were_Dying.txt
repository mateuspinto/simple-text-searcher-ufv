He said  
I was in my early forties  
With a lot of life before me  
And a moment came that stopped me on a dime  
I spent most of the next days  
Looking at the xrays  
Talkin bout the options  
And talkin bout sweet time  
I asked him  
When it sank in  
That this might really be the real end  
Hows it hit you  
When you get that kind of news  
Man whatd you do  
  
He said  
I went skydiving  
I went Rocky Mountain climbing  
I went 27 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu  
And I loved deeper  
And I spoke sweeter  
And I gave forgiveness Id been denying  
And he said  
Someday I hope you get the chance  
To live like you were dying  
  
He said  
I was finally the husband  
That most of the time I wasnt  
And I became a friend a friend would like to have  
And all of a sudden going fishin  
Wasnt such an imposition  
And I went three times that year I lost my dad  
I finally read the Good Book and I  
Took a good long hard look  
At what Id do if I could do it all again  
And then  
  
I went skydiving  
I went Rocky Mountain climbing  
I went 27 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu  
And I loved deeper  
And I spoke sweeter  
And I gave forgiveness Id been denying  
And he said  
Someday I hope you get the chance  
To live like you were dying  
Like tomorrow was a gift  
And youve got eternity  
To think about  
What youd do with it  
What could you do with it  
What did I do with it  
What would I do with it  
  
Skydiving  
I went Rocky mountain climbing  
I went 27 seconds on a bull named Fumanchu  
And I loved deeper  
And I spoke sweeter  
And I watched an eagle as it was flying  
And he said  
Someday I hope you get the chance  
To live like you were dying  
To live like you were dying  
To live like you were dying
