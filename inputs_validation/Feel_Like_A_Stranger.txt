Inside youre burnin I can see clear through  
Your eyes tell more than you mean them to  
Lit up and flashin like the reds and blues  
Out there on the neon avenue  
Well I feel like a stranger feel like a stranger  
  
Well the musics thunderin restless and hot  
You keep firin me glances across the room  
And I cant stop wonderin just what you got  
Get the feeling Im going to find out real soon  
But I feel like a stranger feel like a stranger  
So lets get on with the show lets go  
  
Yes and the wheels its smokin round midnight  
You show me a look that says lets go  
Yes and it feels about like running a red light  
Now there aint no point in looking behind us no  
Still I feel like a stranger feel like a stranger  
You know its gonna get stranger lets get on with the show  
  
If this were love now how would I know How would I know  
Feel like a stranger  
Gonna be a long long crazy crazy night  
Silky silky crazy crazy night
