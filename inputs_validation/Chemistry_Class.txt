She throws back her hair hands and she shows you her mouth  
The breath that I waste trying to ruin your life  
Beautys on a budget but you take it on the chin  
Cause you have to do your duty taking orders from the kingpin  
  
Chorus  
Youve got a chemistry class I want a piece of your mind  
You dont know what you started when you mixed it up with mine  
Are you ready for the final solution Oh Oh  
  
They chopped you up in butchers school  
Threw you out of the academy of garbage  
Youll be a joker all your life  
A student at the comedy college  
People pleasing people pleasing people like you  
Youve been around so long but you still dont know what to do  
  
Chorus  
  
Sparks are flying from electrical pylons  
Snakes and ladders running up and down her nylons  
Ready to experiment youre ready to be burned  
If it wasnt for some accidents then some would never ever learn  
  
Chorus
