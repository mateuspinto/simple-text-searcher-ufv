Verse 1  
I found my life in between shots and getting high  
The cage I was in fell away when she asked me to dance again yeah  
I found my life in between a first kiss and a last goodbye  
The dust settled down now I can see through the crowd  
  
PreChorus  
Im loving the colour white  
Surrounding your colored eyes  
Though she is the kryptonite  
She stays in my crib tonight  
I light her like dynamite  
Load her like gigabyte  
Turn out the fucking lights  
I wanna see you bright  
  
Chorus  
I wanna see you bright  
I wanna see you bright  
I wanna see you bright  
I wanna see you  
  
Verse 2  
For the love in my mind love for the bass  
She likes getting high just for the day  
Shes different in night she knows what I say  
Free of the flash dirt on your shoes I dont know you  
  
PreChorus  
Im loving the colour white  
Surrounding your coloured eyes  
Though she is the kryptonite  
She stays in my crib tonight  
I light her like dynamite  
Load her like gigabyte  
Turn out the fucking lights  
I wanna see you bright  
  
Chorus  
I wanna see you bright  
I wanna see you bright  
I wanna see you bright  
I wanna see you bright  
  
Bridge  
I found my life in between shots and getting high  
The cage I was in fell away when she asked me to dance again  
  
Chorus  
I wanna see you bright  
I wanna see you bright  
I wanna see you bright  
I wanna see you bright  
I wanna see you bright  
I wanna see you bright  
I wanna see you bright  
I wanna see you
