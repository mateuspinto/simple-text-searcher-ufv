Its such a clever innocence with which you do your sorcery  
As if somehow the years just bow and let that young girl go free  
I thought I was a child until you turned and smiled  
I thought I knew where I was going until I heard your laughter flowing  
And came upon the wisdom in your eyes  
Surprise  
  
Ive spent my whole life running round  
Chasing songs from town to town  
Thinking Id be free so long as I never let love slow me down  
So lonely and so wild until you turned and smiled  
By now I should have long been gone  
But here I am still looking on  
As if I didnt know which way to run  
  
Its such a clever innocence with which you show myself to me  
As if you know how it feels to never be who you wanted to be  
I thought I was a child until you turned and smiled  
I thought that I was free but Im just one more prisoner of time  
Alone within the boundaries of my mind  
I thought I was a child
