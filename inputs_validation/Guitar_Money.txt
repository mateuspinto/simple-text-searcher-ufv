I had a nine to five day job at kentucky fried  
Trying to make the payments on a pick up truck and double wide  
Mamma always said son  
Use a little common sense  
So I took her at a whirl and  
Decided I could suck them in  
I had an ol les paul pulled out from under the bed  
And the number of a drummer knew somebody in the grateful dead  
And I got him on the line and he talked awhile  
Then he said Im glad you called  
We need a guitar player and a man that can sing it all  
I started making me some guitar money  
Guitar money  
  
I sure do like it when the people start screaming turn it up  
Turn it up  
Guitar money  
Guitar money  
Oh it aint no wonder old elvis quit driving that truck  
We met a man in atlanta  
He said he would sign us up today  
He was a big movie maker shaker maker record radio might play  
Yeah maybe I will and maybe I wont  
Make it to the hall of fame  
But either way it goes youll never hear me complain  
Yeaah and Im making guitar money

Crank it up

Turn it turn it turn it turn it turn it way up
