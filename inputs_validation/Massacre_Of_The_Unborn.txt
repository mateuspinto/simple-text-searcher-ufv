No survive  
Unborn child  
Cut to piece  
Left without a name  
Unwanted because of the problem of humanity  
Unspeakable crime  
Silent war is the name of the game  
Millions are dying in actions of death and pain  
Misguided mothers make this happen  
Sometimes for a financial situation  
Or a sexual mistake  
CHORUS  
Massacre of the unborn  
Massacre of the unborn  
Massacre of the unborn child  
Innocent blood cries in vain  
Defenseless lives are slaughtered everyday  
They should make a law against this insanity  
Unborn corpses are growing in extreme quantity  
Premature stage  
Slowly destroyed by the human race  
Tortured by tyrants  
Unjustly demise  
Infant children  
Are left to die  
Just innocence lives they slay  
There is no chance to escape  
Murdering in the matter of this case  
A merciless torture to take  
No one will live because they wont survive  
Theres infants dying  
Cant you see  
That they will not have a chance  
Of growing up in this life  
CHORUS  
Massacre of the unborn  
Massacre of the unborn  
Massacre of the unborn child
