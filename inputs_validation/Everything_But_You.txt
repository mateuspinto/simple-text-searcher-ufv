You left me a horse from Texas  
A house with installments due  
A letter with lots of xs  
Everything but you  
  
You left me some beans from Boston  
A bicycle built for two  
A memory to get lost in  
Everything but you  
  
Each day was so gay and so daring  
I loved every breathtaking minute  
For how could I know I was sharing  
A kiss without a future in it  
  
You left me a dream to room with  
A coffee pot from Peru  
A knife and fork to spoon with  
Everything but you
