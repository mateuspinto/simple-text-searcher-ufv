Stone shaker is looking fine  
Shes a heartbreaker every time  
She never seems to realize  
That someday shell be crying too Oo  
  
She is A sharp shooter thats moving fast  
A slight cruiser loaded with gas  
Slowing down to make a pass  
You think its gonna hit you  
So why not take a chance  
  
Cause this is Hot Street Burnin It Up  
Just feel the night beat yeah Fun on the run  
Cause this is Hot Street Ready or not  
Because the fantasy will never stop  
On Hot Street  Oo  
  
A street walker when theres time to spare  
Big spenders holding their share  
A heart of gold but no one cares No one seems to care  
Within their eyes  
  
Some young lovers are laughing loud  
And theres some old suckers trying to get down  
The evening spins around and round Spins around and round  
Yes people of the night smoking through the dark  
  
Cause this is Hot Street Burnin It Up  
Just feel the night beat yeah Fun on the run  
Cause this is Hot Street Ready or not  
Because the fantasy will never stop  
On Hot Street  Oo  
  
All night mover Just trying to put a little fun in their lives  
Winners losers You see them standing on the corner in the neon light  Aow  
Tonight Oo Yeah yeah  Oo  
  
Some feeling you cant explain  
Its such a hard feeling lying in beds flame  
The evening starts to fall again Starts to fall again  
Its time to come alive  
So why not take a chance  
  
Cause this is Hot Street Burnin It Up  
Just feel the night beat yeah Fun on the run  
Cause this is Hot Street Ready or not  
Because the fantasy will never stop  
On Hot Street  Oo  
Cause this is Hot Street Burnin It Up  
Just feel the night beat yeah Fun on the run  
Cause this is Hot Street Ready or not  
Because the fantasy will never stop  
On Hot Street  Oo
