My Jesus my Savior  
Lord there is none like You  
All of my days I want to praise  
The wonders of Your mighty love  
  
My comfort my shelter  
Tower of refuge and strength  
Let every breath all that I am  
Never cease to worship You  
  
Shout to the Lord all the earth let us sing  
Power and majesty praise to the King  
Mountains bow down and the seas will roar  
At the sound of Your name  
I sing for joy at the work of Your hands  
Forever Ill love You forever Ill stand  
Nothing compares to the promise I have in You
