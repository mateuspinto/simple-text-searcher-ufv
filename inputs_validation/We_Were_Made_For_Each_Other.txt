By Carole Bayer and George Fischoff  
I wanted you from the first day I saw you  
The first day I looked into your eyes  
Thats when I knew that I would adore you  
It was no surprise  
  
We were made for each other  
As the stars were made for the sky  
We were made for each other  
No other love have I  
  
You took my hand Was then you had known it  
Was that when you started loving me  
Was it the way I smiled that had shown it  
Was that the day you could see  
  
We were made for each other  
As the stars were made for the sky  
We were made for each other  
No other love have I  
  
We were made for each other  
As the stars were made for the sky  
We were made for each other  
No other love have I
