You are so far You are so far  
Oh like the star Oh like a star  
Oh I feel inside I miss you tonight  
Do anything to make your mine  
  
A lonely night A lonely night  
The stars shine bright The stars shine bright  
I have an idea to have you near  
Here just by my side  
  
Send me a little SMS to my heart  
Send me a little SMS like I do  
Oh baby I will never tearing apart  
Cause my heart is missing you  
  
Send me an S send me an M  
Send me an SMS to my heart  
Send me an S send me an M  
Send me an SMS and we try a start  
Hey little girl Hey little girl  
Its a lonely world Its a lonely world  
Hear my SOS babe I confess  
Cannot live without your love  
Im lost in space Im lost in space  
Want to see your face Wanna see your face  
Wherever you be send some words to me  
Send a message to my heart
