Dont go near the water  
Dont you think its sad  
Whats happened to the water  
Our waters going bad  
Oceans rivers lakes and streams  
Have all been touched by man  
Poison flowing out to sea  
Now threatens life on land  
  
Dont go near the water  
Aint it sad  
Whats happened to the water  
Its going bad  
  
Dont go near the water  
Dont go near the water  
  
Toothpaste and soap will make our oceans a bubble bath  
So thats a modern ecological aftermath  
Beginning with me  
Beginning with you  
  
Dont go near the water  
To do it any wrong  
To be cool with the water  
Is the message of this song  
Lets all help the water  
Right away  
Do what we can and ought to  
Lets start today
