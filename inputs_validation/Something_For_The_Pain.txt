Something for the pain  
Inside me  
That will never die  
The pain inside me  
That will never die  
  
My heart bleeds  
Look at you  
Hiding  
All the things  
To endure me  
  
I need you  
Here with me  
Breathing  
Wanting you  
To believe me  
  
Something for the pain  
Inside me  
That will never die  
The pain inside me  
That will never die  
  
I see you  
In all of these faces  
Blush with shame  
When I think of you  
  
And your pale skin  
I sell my soul for you  
  
Hush Hush  
Never enough  
Never enough  
  
The pain inside me  
That will never die  
Something for the pain  
Inside me  
That will never die
