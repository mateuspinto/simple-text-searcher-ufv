By the window  
Since time began  
Watch the wind blow  
Sculpting sand  
All in letters bound in string  
Life is slowly unraveling  
  
Burning castle  
Turning down  
Mr Prince has lost her crown  
All in letters bound in string  
Time is slowly unraveling  
  
She sells  
Empty sea shells  
Lost in the ocean  
Through the window  
We can see  
Sand and biscuits  
Cups of tea  
All in letters bound in string  
Life is slowly unraveling  
  
All in letters bound in string  
Life is slowly unraveling  
She sells  
Empty sea shells  
She sells  
Empty sea shells
