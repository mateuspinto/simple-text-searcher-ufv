Well you can act like a monkey  
Shake your hands do the limbo till you cant stand  
Well you can mash your potato hippy hippy shake  
But the beats still wild and your feet still ache  
I say its just another name for rock and roll everybody everybody sing  
Its just another name for rock and roll rock and roll  
Well you can do the duck walk your dog  
Down the street loop the loop to a swingin beat  
You can twist and shout and do the stomp  
A chase a chicken on a pony romp but  
Its just another name for rock and roll everybody everybody sing  
Its just another name for rock and roll rock and roll  
Well they all try to shake it another way  
But they rock they roll just the same  
They only call it by another name  
And I dont care what they say  
Down in the jungle where the tree tops are steep  
They get the fever for a bongo beat they do the ubangie stomp  
The safari hop do the monkey until they drop  
But its just another name for rock and roll everybody everybody sing  
Its just another name for rock and roll everybody everybody sing  
Its just another name for rock and roll everybody everybody sing
