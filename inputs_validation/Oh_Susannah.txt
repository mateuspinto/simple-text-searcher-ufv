Well I come from Alabama with my banjo on my knee  
And Im bound for Louisiana my own true love for to see  
It did rain all night the day I left the weather was bone dry  
The sun was so hot I froze myself Suzanne dont you go on and cry  
I said oh Susannah now dont you cry for me  
As I come from Alabama with this banjo on my knee  
  
Well I had myself a dream the other night when everything was still  
I dreamed that I saw my girl Suzanne she was coming around the hill  
Now the buckwheat cake was in her mouth a tear was in her eye  
I said that I come from Dixie land Suzanne dont you break down and cry  
I said oh Susannah now dont you cry for me  
As I come from Alabama with this banjo on my knee
