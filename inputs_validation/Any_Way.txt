Setting out what a child my steps ahead of my mind  
Not a doubt til You knocked me off my paradigm  
Simple me only trying to see You in the stained glass  
I walked right past the unexpected  
Anyway You wanna show me  
All Your glory  
Anywhere You choose to speak  
Tell Your story  
In the low or lofty places  
Strangers faces  
Anywhere  
Any way  
Doubt that I would have found You there in Bethlehem  
No surprise You changed the world through fishermen  
Good to know You would go so far to finally get through  
Thats just like You and so unlike me  
Anyway You wanna show me  
All Your glory  
Anywhere You choose to speak  
Tell Your story  
In the low or lofty places  
Strangers faces  
Anywhere  
Any way  
In the alley on the rooftop  
At the end of a rocky road You dont stop  
On a mountain in a rainstorm  
In the eyes of a mother with her newborn  
In the back pew at the altar  
At the well where You gave the woman water  
In the chaos in the holy  
In the darkness anywhere a heart beats  
Anywhere a heart beats  
Anyway You wanna show me  
All Your glory  
Anywhere You choose to speak  
Tell Your story  
In the low or lofty places  
Strangers faces  
Anywhere  
Any way  
Anyway You wanna show me  
All Your glory  
Anywhere You choose to speak  
Tell Your story  
In the low or lofty places  
Strangers faces  
Anywhere  
Any way
