I was visited by the power and the glory  
I was visited by a majestic hymn  
Great bolts of lightning lighting up the sky  
Electricity flowing through my veins  
  
I was captured by a larger moment  
I was seized by divinitys hot breath  
Gorged like a lion on experience  
Powerful from life  
  
I wanted all of it all of it all of it  
All of it  
Not just some of it all of it all of it  
All of it  
  
I saw a man turn into a bird  
I saw a bird turn into a tiger  
I saw a man hang from a cliff by the tips of his toes  
In the jungles of the Amazon  
  
I saw a man put a redhot needle through his eye  
Turn into a crow and fly through the trees  
Swallow hot coals and breathe out flames  
And I wanted this to happen to me  
  
I wanted all of it all of it all of it  
All of it  
All of it all of it all of it  
Not some of it  
  
We saw the moon vanish into his pocket  
We saw the stars disappear from sight  
We saw him walk across water into the sun  
While bathed in eternal light  
  
We spewed out questions waiting for answers  
Creating legends religions and myths  
Books stories movies and plays  
All trying to explain this  
  
I wanted all of it oh all of it  
All of it  
All of it oh all of it  
Not some of it  
  
I saw a great man turn into a little child  
The cancer reduce him to dust  
His voice growing weak as he fought for his life  
With a bravery few men know  
  
I saw isotopes introduced into his lungs  
Trying to stop the cancerous spread  
And it made me think of Leda And The Swan  
And gold being made from lead  
  
The same power that burned Hiroshima  
Causing three legged babies and death  
Shrunk to the size of a nickel  
To help him regain his breath  
  
And I was struck by the power and the glory  
I was visited by a majestic Him  
Great bolts of lightning lighting up the sky  
As the radiation flowed through him  
  
I wanted all of it not just some of it all of it  
He wanted all of it  
All of it all of it all of it  
He wanted all of it not some of it
