Theyre gonna put me in the movies  
Theyre gonna make a big star out of me  
Well make a film about a man thats sad and lonely  
And all I gotta do is act naturally  
  
Well Ill bet you Im gonna be a big star  
Might win an Oscar you can never tell  
The movies gonna make me a big star  
Cause I can play the part so well  
  
Well I hope you come and see me in the movies  
Then I know that you will plainly see  
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time  
And all I gotta do is act naturally  
  
Well make the scene about a man thats sad and lonely  
And beggin down upon his bended knee  
Ill play the part but I wont need rehearsal  
All I gotta do is act naturally  
  
Well Ill bet you Im gonna be a big star  
Might win an Oscar you can never tell  
The movies gonna make me a big star  
Cause I can play the part so well  
  
Well I hope you come and see me in the movies  
Then I know that you will plainly see  
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time  
And all I gotta do is act naturally
