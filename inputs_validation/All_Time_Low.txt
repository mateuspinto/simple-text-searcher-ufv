Black heart sun rides the sky  
Now your eyes are running dry  
Oh like the space around me  
I take my spot in time  
  
Who knows who is both your best friend and brother  
When everyones deserted you  
Whod shoot first and ask questions later  
If anybodys messed with you  
Pretty soon well all be tumblin like a barrel  
Thrown from the top of the waterfall well  
Im drowning in piranhas in the river  
Man what a drag man  
  
Black heart sun rides the sky  
Now your wells are runnin dry  
Like the space around me  
I take my spot in time  
  
Who knows who is both your best friend and brother  
When everyones deserted you  
Whod shoot first and ask questions later  
If anybodys messed with you  
Pretty soon well all be tumblin like a barrel  
Thrown from the top of the waterfall well  
Im drowning in piranhas in the river  
Man what a drag  
Man what a drag  
Man what a drag  
  
I was talkin to my teacher  
Said I didnt have a clue  
I think my principles are reachin  
An all time low  
  
I saw my lady in the streetlight  
She was walkin with her man  
They were headed for the fire  
That was burnin in the sand  
I think my principles are reachin  
An all time low  
  
I think my principles are reachin  
An all time all time low  
  
All time low  
All time low  
All time low  
All time low
