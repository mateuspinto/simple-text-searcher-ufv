Well I woke this morning with a pain in my neck  
A pain in my heart and a pain in my chest  
I went to the good doctor and the good doctor said  
You gotta slow down your life or youre gonna be dead  
Cut out the struggle and strife  
It only complicates your life  
  
Well I cut down women I cut out booze  
I stopped ironing my shirts cleaning my shoes  
I stopped going to work reading the news  
Im sitting twiddling my thumbs cause I got nothing to do  
Minimal exercise  
To help uncomplicate my life  
Gotta stand and face it life is so complicated  
Ladi dah di dahdah ladi dah di dah dah  
Got to get away from the complicated life son  
Life is overated life is complicated  
Must alleviate this complicated life  
  
Like old Mother Hubbard  
I got nothin in the cupboard  
Got no dinner and I got no supper  
Holes in my shoes I got holes in my socks  
I cant go to work cause I cant get a job  
The bills are rising sky high  
Its such a complicated life  
Gotta stand and face it  
Life is so complicated
