Liberty or death what we so proudly hail  
Once you provoke her rattling of her tail  
Never begins it never but once engaged  
Never surrenders showing the fangs of rage  
Dont tread on me  
  
So be it  
Threaten no more  
To secure peace is to prepare for war  
So be it  
Settle the score  
Touch me again for the words that youll hear evermore  
Dont tread on me  
  
Love it or leave it she with the deadly bite  
Quick is the blue tongue forked as lighting strike  
Shining with brightness always on surveillance  
The eyes they never close emblem of vigilance  
Dont tread on me  
  
So be it  
Threaten no more  
To secure peace is to prepare for war  
So be it  
Settle the score  
Touch me again for the words that youll hear evermore  
  
Dont tread on me  
So be it  
Threaten no more  
To secure peace is to prepare for war  
Liberty or death what we so proudly hail  
Once you provoke her rattling on her tail  
  
So be it  
Threaten no more  
To secure peace is to prepare for war  
So be it  
Settle the score  
Touch me again for the words that youll hear evermore  
Dont tread on me
