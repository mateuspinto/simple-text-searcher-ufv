Well theres something in us living  
Theres something you should know  
There was a time for us to fall  
Now its time to grow  
But you know its not the way  
That I intended it to be  
Crossing hearts and killing souls  
And trying to get down to whats real  
  
All I ever wanted was to make this house a home  
I let go of sinking sand wont you help me find a stone  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted  
Was to make this house a home  
  
All I needed was your hand to hold  
I spent so much time alone  
I needed your direction  
But we realigned my broken bones  
Well theyre running from a lifeless state  
Somehow we lost our hold  
All we have with us is change  
Left over from what started out as gold  
  
All I ever wanted was to make this house a home  
I let go of sinking sand  wont you help me find a stone  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted  
Was to make this house a home  
  
This is what I give to you  
Its flesh and blood  
Its body and soul  
Wont you take whats left of who I am  
And try to see it whole  
  
Im holding you responsible for every word I say  
If you feel the brokenness  
Wont you try and look the other way  
I never meant to be so low  
I only wanted you to see  
That time was healing someone else  
But its tearing apart the very heart of me  
  
This is what I give to you  
Its flesh and blood  
Its body and soul  
Wont you take whats left of who I am  
And try to see it whole  
  
All I ever wanted was to make this house a home  
I let go of sinking sand  wont you help me find a stone  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted  
Was to make this house a home  
So make this house a home  
Make this house a home  
Make this house a home
