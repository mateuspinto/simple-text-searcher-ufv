INTRO  
Ooh  
  
I never dream  
Cause I always thought that dreaming was for kids  
Just a childish thing  
  
And I could swear  
Love is just a game that children play  
And no more than a game  
  
CHORUS  
Till I met you  
I never knew what love was  
Till I met you  
This feeling seems to grow more everyday  
I love you more each day  
  
I believe you  
I believe in every word that you say  
I love you all the way  
  
Now I could swear  
Love is not a game that children play  
So tell me that you stay  
  
CHORUS  
Till I met you  
I never knew what love was  
Till I met you  
This feeling seems to grow more everyday  
I love you more each day  
Each day  
  
BRIDGE  
You and I should be together  
Cant you see  
Cant you see  
  
CHORUS  
Till I met you  
I never knew what love was  
Till I met you  
This feeling seems to grow more everyday  
I love you more each day  
Each day  
  
Till I met you  
Oh I never knew what love was  
Till I met you  
This feeling seems to grow more everyday  
I love you more each day  
Each day  
  
Till I met you  
Till I met you
