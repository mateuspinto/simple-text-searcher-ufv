You left me for the bright lights of the town  
A country boy set out to see the world  
Remember when those city lights shine down  
That big old moon shines on your Kentucky girl  
I swear I love you by the moon above you  
How bright is it shinin in your world  
Some mornings when you wake up all alone  
Just come on home to your blue Kentucky girl  
 banjo   
Dont wait to bring great riches home to me  
I need no diamond rings or fancy pearls  
Just bring yourself youre all Ill ever need  
Thats good enough for this blue Kentucky girl  
I swear I love you by stars
