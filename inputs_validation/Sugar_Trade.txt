Now back when this earth  
Was a silver blue jewel  
And back when your grandfathers  
Father was young  
Men of these shores  
Made and gave up their lives  
Pulling up fish from the sea  
  
While down in the African slavery trade  
Stealing young men to cut sugar cane  
Rum to New Bedford  
And codfish from Maine  
They were building a wall  
That will always remain  
  
Oh the crown and the cross  
The musket and chain  
The white mans religion  
The family name  
Two hundred years later  
And who is to blame  
The captain or the cargo  
Or the juice of the sugar cane  
  
The dory man he knows  
When the riptides will run  
He sets out his nets  
And he sits in the sun  
He thinks of his family  
And drinks of his rum  
And he waits for the codfish to come  
  
Its the same god damned ocean  
That keeps them alive  
It will swallow you up  
It will let you survive  
It will heal you and steal you  
And take you away  
Like a note in a bottle  
With nothing to say  
  
Now back when this earth  
Was a silver blue jewel  
And back when your grandfathers  
Father was young  
Men of these shores  
Made and gave up their lives  
Pulling up fish from the sea
