Young man up on the hillside  
Teaching new ways  
Each word winning them over  
Each heart a kindled flame  
Old men watch from the outside  
Guarding their prey  
Threatened by the voice of the paragon  
Leading their lambs away  
Leading them far away  
  
Chorus  
Nobody knew His secret ambition  
Nobody knew His claim to fame  
He broke the old rules steeped in tradition  
He tore the holy veil away  
Questioning those in powerful position  
Running to those who called His name  
But nobody knew His secret ambition  
Was to give His life away  
  
His rage shaking the temple  
His word to the wise  
His hand healing on the seventh day  
His love wearing no disguise  
Some say Death to the radical  
Hes way out of line  
Some say Praise be the miracle  
God sends a blessed sign  
A blessed sign for troubled times  
  
Chorus
