Do you enjoy your sight inside  
  
Disconnect and let me drift  
Until my upside down is right side in  
Society must let the artist go  
To wander off into the nebula  
  
Chorus  
Wander off into your nebula see your nectarine of multiplicity  
Cum like orgasmatron on overdrive  
Wander in off to your nebula  
Your tangerine of electricity is ripe and on a vine  
So pick your prize  
  
In little black book do I confide  
  
Upon return I conjure what was seen  
I let it pulse and boil within my limbs  
I lay my pencil to the porous page  
And let my lunatic indulge itself  
  
Chorus  
  
Disconnect and let me drift  
Until my upside down is right side in  
Society must let the artist go  
To wander off into the nebula  
  
Chorus
