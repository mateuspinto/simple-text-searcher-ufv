There is fiction in the space between  
The lines on your page of memories  
Write it down but it doesnt mean  
Youre not just telling stories  
There is fiction in the space between  
You and me  
  
There is fiction in the space between  
You and reality  
You will do and say anything  
To make your everyday life  
Seem less mundane  
There is fiction in the space between  
You and me  
  
Theres a science fiction in the space between  
You and me  
A fabrication of a grand scheme  
Where I am the scary monster  
I eat the city and as I leave the scene  
In my spaceship I am laughing  
In your remembrance of your bad dream  
Theres no one but you standing  
  
Leave the pity and the blame  
For the ones who do not speak  
You write the words to get respect and compassion  
And for posterity  
You write the words and make believe  
There is truth in the space between  
  
There is fiction in the space between  
You and everybody  
Give us all what we need  
Give us one more sad sordid story  
But in the fiction of the space between  
Sometimes a lie is the best thing  
Sometimes a lie is the best thing
