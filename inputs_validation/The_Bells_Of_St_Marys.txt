The Bells of St Marys  
Ah hear they are calling  
The young loves the true loves  
Who come from the sea  
  
And so my beloved  
When red leaves are falling  
The love bells shall ring out ring out  
For you and me  
  
The Bells of St Marys  
Ah hear they are calling  
The young loves the true loves  
Who come from the sea  
  
And so my beloved  
When red leaves are falling  
The love bells shall ring out ring out  
For you and me
