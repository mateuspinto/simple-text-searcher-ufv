Ready aim fire  
No one fuckin around standing in the line  
You gotta feel it right between the eyes  
Time is runnin out time to do it right now  
My oh my every things gonna be fine  
My oh my fat fucking lie  
Let yourself go let me test your fate  
Make your head roll make your legs shake  
Dance to the sound of heartache  
My oh my every things gonna be fine  
My oh my fat fucking lie oh  
Fat fucking lie get on your bikes and ride  
My oh my every things gonna be fine  
My oh my fat fucking lie fat fucking lie
