Fear is dark but my love is a lantern  
Shining up like coins in a fountain  
Hope is a tree sitting on a mountain where the grass dont grow  
Theres a sad old sea but my love is an island  
Wild and free like the hills in the highlands  
Hope is a breeze that brings me back to dry land  
Where the flowers grow  
  
Love is a baby born  
Love is the last unicorn  
Love is the only song ill sing  
  
Hate is a poison  
Love is a remedy  
Singing out like the sweetest of melodies  
Hope is a ghost in the deepest of memories  
Stronger than ten of me  
Fear is the enemy  
In the dark and it creeps like a shark  
In the coldest sea  
In the deepest part but  
Hope is the beat in the oldest heart  
A hand in a hand and a brand new start  
  
Love is a fireside  
Warm on the coldest of nights  
Love is the only song Ill sing  
Love is the truest of words  
Love is the last winter birds  
Love is the only song Ill sing  
  
Oh Ill sing  
Til I cant sing no more  
Oh Ill sing  
Til my throat is sore
