When Im walking beside her  
People tell me Im lucky  
Yes I know Im a lucky guy  
I remember the first time  
  
I was lonely without her  
Cant stop thinking about her now  
Every little thing she does  
She does for me  
  
And you know the things she does  
She does for me  
  
When Im with her Im happy  
Just to know that she loves me  
Yes I know that she loves me now  
There is one thing Im sure of  
  
I will love her forever  
Cause I know love will never die  
Every little thing she does  
She does for me  
  
And you know the things she does  
She does for me  
  
Every little thing she does  
She does for me  
And you know the things she does  
She does for me  
  
When Im with her Im happy  
Just to know that she loves me  
Yes I know that she loves me now  
There is one thing Im sure of  
  
I will love her forever  
Cause I know love will never die  
Every little thing she does  
She does for me  
  
And you know the things she does  
She does for me  
  
Every little thing  
Every little thing  
Every little thing  
Every little thing
