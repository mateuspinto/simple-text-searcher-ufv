Time is runnin out of control ooh  
Help all my dreams come true  
Time is runnin out of control ooh  
You make my dreams come true  
  
Here comes the night  
Gone are the days yeah  
When we could just sit here and talk for hours  
Didnt have much to say  
  
Time is runnin out of control ooh  
Help my dreams come true  
Time is runnin out of control ooh  
You make my dreams come true  
  
Now everything seems so serious  
We all had our fun in the sun  
We all want to take too much out of life  
Fooling ourselves in the long run  
  
Time is runnin out of control ooh  
Help my dreams come true  
Time is runnin out of control ooh  
You make my dreams come true  
  
Tryin to beat the clock  
It never stops tickin the time away  
Tryin to beat the clock it  
Never stops never stops night or day  
  
Time is runnin out of control ooh  
And my dreams come true  
Time is runnin out of control ooh  
You make my dreams come true
