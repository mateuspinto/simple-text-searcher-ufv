Dolly Parton  
Many years you have lingered around my cabin door  
Oh hard times come again no more  
Oh hard times come again no more  
Oh hush a bye hard times go ye away  
Cause my hungry baby wants a Gingerbread Cake  
Not a cow in the barn yard no money to spend  
Not an egg in the hayloft no little red hen  
So hush a bye baby dont cry no more  
Your mama cant give you what youre crying for  
Theres a wolf at the door with an angry  
Cold hungry stare he keeps howling of hard times  
And the cupboard is bare  
Oh hush a bye hard times go ye to rest  
Cause my ragged baby wants a new ruffled dress  
And she wants some new shoes with buckles to wear  
And she wants some silver bows for her golden hair  
So hush a bye baby dont cry no more  
Your mama cant give you what youre crying for  
Theres a wolf at the door with an angry  
Cold hungry stare he keeps howling of hard times  
And the cupboard is bare  
So hush a bye baby dont cry no more  
Your mama cant give you what youre crying for  
Theres a wolf at the door with an angry  
Cold hungry stare he keeps howling of hard times  
And the cupboard is bare  
Hush a bye hard times go ye away  
I dont intend to be treated this way  
So hush a bye baby  
Hush a bye hard times  
Hush a bye baby  
Dont cry no more  
Hush a bye hard times  
Hush a bye baby  
Hush a bye hard times  
Come ye no more  
Many years you have lingered around my cabin door  
Hush a bye hard times  
Come ye no more  
Hush a bye baby  
Hush a bye hard times  
Hush a bye baby  
Dont cry no more  
Hush a bye hard times  
Hush a bye baby  
Hush a bye hard times  
Come ye no more
