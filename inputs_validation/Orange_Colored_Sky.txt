I was walking along minding my business  
When out of the orange colored sky  
Flash bam alacazam Wonderful you came by  
  
I was humming a tune drinking in sunshine  
When out of that orange colored view  
Wham bam alacazam I got a look at you  
  
Oh one look and I yelled timber  
Watch out for flying glass  
Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out  
I went into a spin and I started to shout  
Ive been hit This is it this is it  
  
I was walking along minding my business  
When love came and hit me in the eye  
Wham bam alacazam  
Out of the orange colored sky  
  
Oh one look and I yelled timber  
Watch out for flying glass  
Cause the ceiling fell in and the bottom fell out  
I went into a spin and I started to shout  
Ive been hit This is it this is it  
  
I was walking along minding my business  
When love came and hit me in the eye  
Wham bam alacazam  
Out of the orange colored purple striped pretty green polka dot sky  
Flash bam alacazaaam  
And good bye good bye
