Desmond has his barrow in the market place  
Molly is the singer in a band  
Desmond says to Molly Girl I like your face  
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand  
Obladi oblada life goes on brah  
Lala how the life goes on  
Obladi oblada life goes on brah  
Lala how the life goes on  
  
Desmond takes a trolley to the jewelry store  
Buys a twenty carat golden ring  
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door  
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing  
Obladi oblada life goes on brah  
Lala how the life goes on  
Obladi oblada life goes on brah  
Lala how the life goes on  
  
In a couple of years they have built a home sweet home  
With a couple of kids running in the yard  
Of Desmond and Molly Jones Ha ha ha ha ha  
  
Happy ever after in the market place  
Desmond lets the children lend a hand  
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face  
And in the evening she still sings it with the band  
Obladi oblada life goes on brah  
Lala how the life goes on  
Obladi oblada life goes on brah  
Lala how the life goes on  
  
In a couple of years they have built a home sweet home  
With a couple of kids running in the yard  
Of Desmond and Molly Jones  
Happy ever after in the market place  
Molly lets the children lend a hand  
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face  
And in the evening shes a singer with the band  
Obladi oblada life goes on brah  
Lala how the life goes on  
Obladi oblada life goes on brah  
Lala how the life goes on
