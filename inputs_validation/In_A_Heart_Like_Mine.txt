In a heart like mine  
With a steady beat  
Just the right rhythm makes you feel complete  
And the rhythms right with you and I  
And love starts pounding in a heart like mine  
  
Put a quart or two  
With a melody  
Bring in a little chill bump harmony  
Then let it build  
Til the feelings right  
And love starts playing in heart like mine  
  
In a heart like mine  
In a love like this  
Theres a sympony in a single kiss  
Bring on the fiddles and the violins  
And listen to the way they shine  
I could live on the music til the end of time  
With a love like yours and a heart like mine  
  
In a heart like mine  
Thres poetry  
In truth emotion and honesty  
So when the soul is there  
And the words all rhyme  
Love starts singing in a heart like mine  
  
In a heart like mine  
In a love like this  
Theres a symphony in a single kiss  
Bring on the fiddles and the violins  
And listen to the way they shine  
I could live on the music til the end of time  
With a love like yours and a heart like mine  
  
In a heart like mine  
In a love like this  
Theres a sympony in a single kiss  
Bring on the fiddles and the violins  
And listen to the way they shine  
I could live on the music til the end of time  
With a love like yours and a heart like mine  
  
I could live on the music til the end of time  
With a love like yours and a heart like mine
