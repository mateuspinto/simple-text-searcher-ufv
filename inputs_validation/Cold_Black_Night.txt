It was a cold black night and the rain was falling down  
Cold black night and the rain was fallin down  
I went out lookin for my girl  
I knew she wasnt nowhere around  
She left me early that morning with a suitcase in her hand  
She left me early that morning yes with a suitcase in her hand  
And she took off on a train this mornin  
And she was meetin some other man yes  
She used to treat me real good and I wonder why I  
Didnt treat her right  
Yes ah you know I wonder why I didnt treat her right  
And now all I can do is walk those streets both day and night
