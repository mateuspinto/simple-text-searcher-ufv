I want to drive away  
In the night headlights call my name  
  
I Ill never be be what you see inside  
You say Im not alone but I am petrified  
You say that you are close is close the closest star  
You just feel twice as far you just feel twice as far  
  
And Ill fall  
And Ill break  
And Ill fake  
All I wanna  
  
And Ill fall down  
And Ill break down  
And Ill fake you out  
All I wanna  
  
Im so afraid  
Of what you have to say  
Cause I am quiet now  
And silence gives you space  
  
Ill never be be what you see inside  
You say Im not alone but I am petrified  
You say that you are close is close the closest star  
You just feel twice as far you just feel twice as far  
  
And Ill fall  
And Ill break  
And Ill fake  
All I wanna  
  
And Ill fall down  
And Ill break down  
And Ill fake you out  
All I wanna  
  
Its the same game today as it always is  
I dont give these places fake my name explaining this  
And the wrists of my mind have the bleeding lines  
That remind me of all the times  
I have committed  
Dirty dirty crimes that are perfectly formfitted  
To what Ive done and what Im doing  
Im brewing and losing and spewing infusing  
And believe me thats what all the kids are doing  
What kids are doing are killing themselves  
They feel they have no control of their prisoners cell  
And if youre one of them then youre one of me  
And you would do almost anything just to feel free  
Am I right Of course I am  
Convince me otherwise would take all night  
Before you walk away theres one more thing I want to say  
Our brains are sick but thats okay  
  
And Ill fall  
And Ill break  
And Ill fake  
All I wanna  
  
All I wanna  
Yeah and Ill fall down  
And Ill break down  
And Ill fake you out  
All I wanna  
Yeah and Ill fall down  
And Ill break down  
And Ill fake you out  
All I wanna  
  
Im so afraid  
Of what you have to say  
Cause I am quiet now  
And silence gives you space
