Find your self discover God  
And the truth you cant deny I shall never die  
Together we shall fly  
You will find your God the only one  
You are his begotten son  
  
Beyond the mystic sky  
I know that I can fly  
And my soul shall follow the path  
I paved wlone with love  
  
You know the only thing I want is to love  
How can I lie within you now  
God of darkness God of light  
In my soul day or night  
I ride the shadows yet live in light and cry  
If a man could pass through the paradise in a dream  
And has a flower presented to him as a pledge  
Thus his soul had been here Nathaniel Hawthorne  
As I awaken from slumber my mind filled with sights unreal  
  
My only wish is to see you lie  
To make your soul forever fly  
You will fly beyond the mystic sky  
You will lie again with the lord Allah
