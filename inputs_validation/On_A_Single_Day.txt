A list of exports from Cork Harbour  
On a single day  
The fourteenth of September Eighteen FortySeven  
Ran as follows  
  
147 barrels of pork  
986 casks of ham  
27 sacks of bacon

380 sacks of barley  
187 head of cattle  
296 head of sheep and  
4 338 barrels of miscellaneous provisions  
On a single day  
The ships sailed out from Cork Harbour  
With their bellies in the water  
On a single day in County Galway  
The great majority of the poor located there  
  
Were in a state of starvation  
Many hourly expecting death to relieve their suffering  
  
On a single day  
The Lady Mayoress held a ball  
At the Mansion House in Dublin  
In the presence of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland  
Dancing continued until the early hours  
And refreshments of the most varied and sumptuous  
Nature  
Were supplied with inexhaustible profusion  
On a single day  
On a single day  
  
Its about time this little country of ours had a bit  
Of peace
