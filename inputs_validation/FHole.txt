I wrote her name on a bar mat  
She had a peculiar bonnet  
But a youngish damsel figure  
With her tongue tied to a trigger  
She seemed a total killer  
Her face all filled with filler  
Her face a painting palette  
I stomached all her habits  
Sipped her snow balls poshly like a judge  
But left her lipstick traces on her mug  
We watched each other closely  
She looks like Bela Lugosi  
She asked me for a ride home  
I felt around for my comb  
And in the bar room mirror  
I combed right through her figure  
She wiggled through the car park  
Into the pit of my heart  
Sat herself beside me in my van  
A ring on every finger of her hand  
She lived down by the river  
A flat the council give her  
Wallpaper very scenic  
Her outlook very beatnik  
We watched the close and weather  
Then through the door he entered  
Short sleeves and arms of iron  
And me with just my tie on  
She said the lodgers used to this by now  
Id handled all the bull but not the cow  
Behind her velvet sofa  
I found myself back sober  
She kept an old acoustic  
She never ever used it  
A gift for me with a capo  
A six string with an fhole  
We made the strangest couple  
A Laurel and Hardy double  
I learnt to play her favorite country songs  
With one or two chords always going wrong
