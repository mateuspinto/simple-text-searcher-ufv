Since I lost you  
I cant get through the day  
Without at least one big boohoo  
The pain wont go away  
What am I gonna do  
Man from Mars  
This time you went too far  
  
I fall apart  
Everytime I think of you  
Swallowed by the dark  
There is no center to my life now  
No grace in my heart  
Man from Mars  
This time you went too far  
  
I call and call  
The silence is so full of sounds  
Youre in them all  
I hear you in the water  
And the wiring in the walls  
Man from Mars  
This time you went too far
