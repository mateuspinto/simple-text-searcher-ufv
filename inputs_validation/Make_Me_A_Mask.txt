Make me a mask  
That I can wear  
Till day is done  
  
The wind in the trees  
The falling leaves  
The worlds spinning  
  
Make me a mask  
So I can laugh  
Till night time comes  
  
No more can I stay  
How long must I play  
This game of winning  
  
If I had known this was only a dream  
I would have awakened from this sleep  
  
Make me a mask  
So I can last  
Till the right time comes  
  
A tear in my eye  
To light I fly  
An end is beginning
