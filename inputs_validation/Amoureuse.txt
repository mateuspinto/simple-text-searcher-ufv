Strands of light on our bedroom floor  
Change the night through an open door  
Im awake but this is not my home  
For the first time Im not alone  
Reaching out I touch anothers skin  
Breathing out as hes breathing in  
Deep inside I feel my soul aflame  
Can my life ever be the same  
I should have told him  
That Id do anything if I could hold him  
For just another day for just another day  
His love is something I will not forget  
When I am far away when I am far away  
I feel the rainfall of another planet  
Another planet  
Close together in the afterglow  
I remember how his loving flowed  
Turned the key into another world  
Made a woman of a simple girl  
Daylight comes as we both know it must  
Soon my fantasy will turn to dust  
But I would give him anything he asked  
If my first love could be my last  
I should have told him  
That Id do anything if I could hold him  
For just another day for just another day  
His love is something I will not regret  
When I am far away when I am far away  
I feel the rainfall of another planet  
Another planet
