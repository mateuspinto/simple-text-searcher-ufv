We were watchin tvwatchintv  
In tiananmen square  
Lost my baby there  
My yellow rose  
And her bloodstained clothes  
She was a short order pastry chef  
In a dim sum dive on the yangtze tideway  
She had shiny hair  
She was the daughter of an engineer  
Wont you shed a tear  
For my yellow rose  
My yellow rose  
And her bloodstained clothes  
She had perfect breasts  
She had high hopes  
She had almond eyes  
She had yellow thighs  
She was a student of philosophy  
Wont you grieve with me  
For my yellow rose  
Shed a tear  
For her bloodstained clothes  
She had shiny hair  
She had perfect breasts  
She had high hopes  
She had almond eyes  
She had yellow thighs  
She was the daughter of an engineer  
So get out your pistols  
Get out your stones  
Get out your knives  
Cut them to the bone  
They are the lackeys of the grocers machine  
They built the dark satanic mills  
That manufacture hell on earth  
They bought the front row seats on calvary  
They are irrelevant to me  
And I grieve for my sister  
People of china  
Do not forget do not forget  
The children who died for you  
Long live the republic  
Did we do anything after this  
Ive a feeling we did  
We were watchin tvwatchin tv

She wore a white bandanna that said  
Freedom now  
She thought the great wall of china  
Would come tumbling down  
She was a student  
Her father was an engineer  
Wont you shed a tear  
For my yellow rose  
My yellow rose  
And her bloodstained clothes  
Her grandpa fought old chiang kaishek  
That nogood lowdown dirty rat  
Who used to order his troops  
To fire on the women and children  
Imagine that imagine that  
And in the spring of 48  
Mao tsetung got quite irate  
And he kicked that old dictator chiang  
Out of the state of china  
Chiang kaishek came down in formosa  
And they armed the island of quemoy  
And the shells were flying across the china sea  
And they turned formosa into a shoe factory  
Called taiwan  
And she is different from cromagnon man  
Shes different from anne boleyn  
She is different from the rosenbergs  
And from the unknown jew  
She is different from the unknown nicaraguan  
Half superstar half victim  
Shes a victor star conceptually new  
And she is different from the dodo  
And from the kankanbono  
She is different from the aztec  
And from the cherokee  
Shes everybodys sister  
Shes symbolic of our failure  
Shes the one in fifty million  
Who can help us to be free  
Because she died on tv
