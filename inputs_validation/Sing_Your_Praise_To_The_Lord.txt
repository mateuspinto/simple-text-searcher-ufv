Sing your praise to the Lord  
Come on everybody  
Stand up and sing one more  
Hallelujah  
Give your praise to the Lord  
I can never tell you  
Just how much good that its  
Gonna do ya  
  
Just to sing anew  
The song your heart first learned to sing when he  
First gave his life to you  
The life goes on and so must the song  
You gotta sing again  
The song born in your soul when you  
First gave your heart to him  
Sing his praises once more  
  
Sing your praise to the Lord  
Come on everybody  
Stand up and sing one more  
Hallelujah  
Give your praise to the Lord  
I can never tell you  
Just how much good that its  
Gonna do ya  
  
Just to sing aloud  
The song that someone is dying to hear  
Down in the maddning crowd  
As you once were before your heard the song  
You gotta let them know  
The truth is a life to shine upon the way  
So maybe they can go  
Sing his praises once more  
  
Sing your praise to the Lord  
Come on everybody  
Stand up and sing one more  
Hallelujah  
Give your praise to the Lord  
I can never tell you  
Just how much good that its  
Gonna do ya  
  
Just to let the name of the Lord  
Be praise both for now and evermore  
Praise him all ye servants  
  
Give him praise to the Lord  
Come on everybody  
Stand up and sing one more  
Hallelujah  
Give your praise to the Lord  
I can never tell you  
Just how much good that its  
Gonna do ya  
  
Just to sing sing sing  
Come on sing sing sing
