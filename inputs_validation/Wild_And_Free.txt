A fire burns for freedom  
The smell of decent is I  
I am standing for the truth  
Too long has been denied  
The data of changing is rising

Unchained wings let angels fly  
  
Chorus  
I see fields forever  
Growing wild and free  
I see marijuana trees blowing in our breeze  
I see fields forever growing wild and free

A war is there is a message  
In the wind for every race  
Peace and love we saw  
So let us grow is good for the

Deny the tree of life  
Stand hypocrisy for so many lies  
Corporation greed can only see  
Survive by planting weed

Crucified savior to save your face  
Demonized nature our saving grace  
We got to put to good use  
What the lord has gave  
Fruits of the tree herbs of the  
  
Chorus
