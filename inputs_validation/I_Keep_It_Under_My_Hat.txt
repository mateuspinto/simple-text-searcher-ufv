It looks a little weathered so it looks good on me  
But since youve left Im wearin this old hat differently  
Pain wind rain and sun it keeps out all but one  
  
So I keep the brim pulled down  
Whenever those teardrops come around  
So nobody else can see  
Just what your memory does to me  
I know I cant hide  
But baby Ive still got my pride  
When your memory comes back  
I keep it under my hat  
  
Last night I thought Id go out  
I dont know where my head was at  
I had to turn around  
Go back and get my hat  
And I was glad I did  
When I saw you with him  
  
I kept the brim pulled down  
Whenever those teardrops came around  
So nobody else could see  
Just what your memory does to me  
I know I cant hide  
But baby Ive still got my pride  
When your memory comes back  
I keep it under my hat  
  
When your memory comes back  
I keep it under my hat
