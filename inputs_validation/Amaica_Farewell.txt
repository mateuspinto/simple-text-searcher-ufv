Lord Burgess  
  
Down the way where the nights are gay  
And the sun shines daily on the mountain top  
I took a trip on a sailing ship  
But when I reached Jamaica I made her stop  
  
Now Im sad to say  
Im on my way on my way  
I wont be back for many a day  
My heart is down  
My head is turning around  
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town  
  
Sounds of laughter everywhere  
And the dancing girls sway to and fro  
I must declare my heart is there  
Though I have been from Maine to Mexico  
  
Still Im sad to say  
Im on my way on my way  
I wont be back for many a day  
My heart is down  
My head is turning around  
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town  
  
Down at the market you can hear  
Ladies cry out while on their heads they bear  
Ackev rice salt fish are nice  
Oh the rum is fine anytime of year  
  
Now Im sad to say  
Im on my way on my way  
I wont be back for many a day  
My heart is down  
My head is turning around  
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town  
  
Down the way where the nights are gay  
And the sun shines daily on the mountaintop  
I took a trip on a sailing ship  
But when I reached Jamaica I made her stop  
  
Now Im sad to say  
Im on my way on my way  
I wont be back for many a day  
My heart is down  
My head is turning around  
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town  
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town  
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town
