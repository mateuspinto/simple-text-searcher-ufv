I remember LA  
Seems a lifetime ago  
We were stars on Sunset Boulevard  
What a movie we made  
  
There were days in the sun  
That have stayed forever young  
Nights when passion was invincible  
We thought love would never die  
  
Chorus  
  
There were moments in that lifetime  
That my heart still replays  
There were minutes there were hours there were days  
There are moments I still love you that same way  
When I remember LA  
  
I remember goodbye  
I watched your plane out of sight  
Love was over time to close the book  
Still I go back for one last look  
  
Chorus
