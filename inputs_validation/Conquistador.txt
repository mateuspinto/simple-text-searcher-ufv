Conquistador your stallion stands in need of company  
And like some angels haloed brow  
You reek of purity  
I see your armor plated breast  
Has long since lost its sheen  
And in your death mask face  
There are no signs which can be seen  
And though I hoped for something to find  
I could see no maze to unwind  
Conquistador a vulture sits upon your silver sheath  
And in your rusty scabbard now the sand has taken seed  
And though your jewelencrusted blade  
Has not been plundered still  
The sea has washed across your face  
And taken of its fill  
And though I hoped for something to find  
I could see no maze to unwind  
Conquistador there is no time I must pay my respect  
And though I came to jeer at you  
I leave now with regret  
And as the gloom begins to fall  
I see there is no aureole  
Though you came with sword held high  
You did not conquer only die  
And though I hoped for something to find  
I could see no maze to unwind  
And though I hoped for something to find  
I could see no maze to unwind
