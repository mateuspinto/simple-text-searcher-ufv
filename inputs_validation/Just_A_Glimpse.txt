I dont have to fully know  
Just how far Your love can go  
To sing of Your love for me

How Your mercy never ends

And all I can do is worship  
All I can do is worship You Lord yeah  
And I dont have to clearly see  
How amazing grace can be  
To sing of Your grace for me  
And I dont have to fully grasp  
The measure of Your holiness  
Oh to sing holy holy holy holy  
And all I need is  
All I really need is  
Just a glimpse of You
