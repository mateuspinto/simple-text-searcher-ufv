In the valley where the loons and lovers play  
Lived two children who were born on Saturday  
  
One was dark one was fair  
Fathered by the hawk mothered by the mare  
Stranger children you will never see  
  
Brothers of the forest and the sea  
One was land one was air  
and they kept the fires burning there  
  
In a golden vessel and silver vase  
Kept them burning in the strange enchanted place  
Kept them burning to the sky  
For they knew someday the sun would die
