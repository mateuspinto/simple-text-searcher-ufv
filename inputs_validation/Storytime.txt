It was the night before  
When all through the world  
No words no dreams  
Then one day  
A writer by a fire  
Imagined all of Gaia  
Took a journey into a childmans heart  
  
A painter on the shore  
Imagined all the world  
Within a snowflake on his palm  
Unframed by poetry  
A canvas of awe  
Planet Earth falling back into the stars  
  
I am the voice of Neverneverland  
The innocence the dreams of every man  
I am the empty crib of Peter Pan  
A silent kite against the blue blue sky  
Every chimney every moonlit sight  
I am the story that will read you real  
Every memory that you hold dear  
  
I am the journey  
I am the destination  
I am the home  
The tale that reads you  
A way to taste the night  
The elusive high  
Follow the madness  
Alice you know once did  
  
Imaginarium a dream emporium  
Caress the tales  
And they will read you real  
A storytellers game  
Lips that intoxicate  
The core of all life is a  
Limitless chest of tales  
  
I am the voice of Neverneverland  
The innocence the dreams of every man  
I am the empty crib of Peter Pan  
A silent kite against the blue blue sky  
Every chimney every moonlit sight  
I am the story that will read you real  
Every memory that you hold dear  
  
I am the voice of Neverneverland  
The innocence the dreams from every man  
Searching heavens for another earth  
  
I am the voice of Neverneverland  
The innocence the dreams of every man  
I am the empty crib of Peter Pan  
A silent kite against the blue blue sky  
Every chimney every moonlit sight  
I am the story that will read you real  
Every memory that you hold dear  
  
I am the voice of Neverneverland  
The innocence the dreams of every man  
I am the empty crib of Peter Pan  
A silent kite against the blue blue sky  
Every chimney every moonlit sight  
I am the story that will read you real  
Every memory that you hold dear
