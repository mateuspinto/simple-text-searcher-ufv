Oh baby dont you want a man like me  
Oh baby dont you want a man like me  
Think about your future  
Forget about your used to be  
Just a little bit of rock  
Just a taste or two of roll  
Ill give you sweet inspiration  
Till it satisfies your soul  
Oh baby dont you want a man like me  
Let me serve you pretty baby  
Serve you until youre free  
Let me serve you in the morning  
Let me serve you in the afternoon  
I want to love you pretty mama  
Underneath the silvery moon  
Oh baby dont you want a man like me  
Let me serve you pretty baby  
Think about what could be  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
