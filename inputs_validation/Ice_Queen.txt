When leaves have fallen  
And skies turned to grey  
The night keeps on closing in on the day  
A nightingale sings his song of farewell  
You better hide for her freezing hell  
  
On cold wings shes coming  
You better keep moving  
For warmth youll be longing nightingale  
Come on just feel it  
Dont you see it  
You better believe  
  
When she embraces  
Your heart turns to stone  
She comes at night when you are all alone  
And when she whispers  
Your blood shall run cold  
You better hide before she finds you  
  
Whenever she is raging  
She takes a life away  
Havent you seen  
Havent you seen  
The ruins on our world  
  
Whenever she is raging  
She takes a life away  
Havent you seen  
Havent you seen  
The ruins on our world  
  
She covers the earth with a breathtaking cloak  
The sun awakes and melts it away  
The world now opens its eyes and sees  
The dawning of the new day  
  
On cold wings shes coming  
You better keep moving  
For warmth youll be longing nightingale  
Come on just feel it  
Dont you see it  
You better believe  
  
Whenever she is raging  
She takes a life away  
Havent you seen  
Havent you seen  
The ruins on our world  
  
Whenever she is raging  
She takes a life away  
Havent you seen  
Havent you seen  
The ruins on our world
