Hello Seattle I am a mountaineer  
In the hills and highlands  
I fall asleep in hospital parking lots  
And awake in your mouth  
  
Hello Seattle I am a mantaray  
Deep beneath the blue waves  
Ill crawl the sandy bottom of Puget Sound  
And construct my summer home  
  
Hello Seattle I am the crescent moon  
Shining down on your face  
I will disguise myself as a sleeping pill  
And descend inside of you  
  
Hello Seattle I am a cold seahorse  
Feeling warm in your sand  
I sing about the tide and the ocean surf  
Rolling in the evening breeze  
  
Hello Seattle I am an albatross  
On the docks and your boats  
I sail above your inlets and interstates  
Through the rain and open wind  
  
Hello Seattle I am an old lighthouse  
Throwing beams of bright lights  
Red in the morning blue in the evening sun  
Taking heed from everyone  
  
Hello Seattle I am a mountaineer  
In the hills and highlands  
I fall asleep in hospital parking lots  
  
Take me above your light  
Carry me through the night  
Hold me secure in flight  
Sing me to sleep tonight  
  
Take me above your light  
Carry me through the night  
Hold me secure in flight  
Sing me to sleep tonight
