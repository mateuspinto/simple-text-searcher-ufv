When it all comes down the line  
And the lights they turn to greed  
And you race off with your tyres screaming  
Rolling thunder  
And the people choke with poison  
Children cry in fear  
But youve got your fast bullet  
One way ticket outta here  
  
Chorus  
Fall on your knees today  
And pray the world will mend its ways  
Get to your feet again  
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain  
  
In the cities in the streets  
Theres a tension you can feel  
Breaking strain is fast approaching  
Guns and riots  
Politicians gamble and lie to save their skins  
And the press get fed the scapegoats  
Public enema number one  
  
Chorus  
  
A million network slaves  
In an advertising new age  
I dont need a crystal ball to sell ya  
Your children have more brains  
Than your drug infested remains  
California dreaming as the earth dies screaming  
  
Chorus
