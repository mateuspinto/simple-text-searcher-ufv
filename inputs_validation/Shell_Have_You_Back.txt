Once upon a lonely time  
She swore shed never let you down  
You held her tight without a care in mind  
While she did her runnin round  
At first you wouldnt face the truth  
You loved her too much to let go  
And though the story had to end  
You want to be her fool again  
Friend theres somethin you should know  
  
Shell have you back  
Back to drinkin in no time  
Back to walkin on your knees  
Boy open up your eyes and see the light  
Some things just arent meant to be  
I understand how she can get to you  
Cause shes made more than one man blind  
So try and face the cold hard fact  
She would gladly have you back  
Back to drinkin in no time  
  
It just dont make no sense to me  
To play a game youll never win  
You ask me here for my advice  
You say she wouldnt break you twice  
Friend you better think again  
  
Shell have you back  
Back to drinkin in no time  
Back to walkin on your knees  
Boy open up your eyes and see the light  
Some things just arent meant to be  
I understand how she can get to you  
Cause shes made more than one man blind  
So try and face the cold hard fact  
She would gladly have you back  
Back to drinkin in no time  
  
So try and face the cold hard fact  
She would gladly have you back  
Back to drinkin in no time
