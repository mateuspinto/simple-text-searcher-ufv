Oh I think I landed in a world I hadnt seen  
When Im feeling ordinary when I dont know what I mean  
Oh I think I landed where there are miracles at work  
For the thirst and for the hunger come the conference of birds  
  
Saying its true its not what it seems  
Leave your broken windows open  
And in the light just streams  
  
And you get a head  
A head full of dreams  
You can see the change you want to  
Be what you want to be  
  
When you get a head  
A head full of dreams  
Into a life Ive just been spoken  
With a head full a head full of dreams  
  
Oh I think I landed where there are miracles at work  
When you got me open handed  
When you got me lost for words  
  
I sing oh oh  
A head full of dreams oh  
A head full of dreams oh  
  
Into life Ive just been spoken  
With a head full a head full of dreams
