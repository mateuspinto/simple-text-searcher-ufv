Verse 1  
Flicker yes flicker  
There it is a little less faint  
A little more of your flame  
Feel it warm your skin  
Part of you trapped within  
  
PreChorus  
Shed a little light on this  
Help me see  
Shed a little light on this  
Underneath the scarring from his defiling  
Underneath the pain  
Chorus  
Heroines  
They are not born they are made  
A phoenix forms her ashes rise  
Expose their hell  
Break Satans spell  
Fire purifies  
Its redemption time  
  
Verse 2  
Flicker yes flicker  
When neighbours and friends  
Only give you their burning silence  
Even with torches raised  
Part of you cant feel safe  
  
PreChorus  
Shed a little light on this  
Help me see  
Shed a little light on this please  
Shed a little light on this  
And on those who excuse this act of violence  
Choosing you to play  
  
Chorus  
Heroines  
They are not born they are made  
A phoenix forms her ashes rise  
Expose their hell  
Break Satans spell  
Fire purifies  
Its redemption time  
  
Outro  
Shed a little light on this  
Shed a little light on this
