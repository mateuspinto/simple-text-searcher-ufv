Try to hear my voice  
You can leave now its your choice  
  
Maybe if I fall asleep I wont breathe right  
Maybe if I leave tonight I wont come back  
  
I said it before I wont say it again  
Love is a game to you its not pretend  
Maybe if I fall asleep I wont breathe right  
  
Can nobody hear me  
Ive got a lot thats on my mind  
I cannot breathe  
Can you hear it too  
  
You kiss and you kiss  
And you love and you love  
Youve got a history list and the rest is above  
And if youre warm then you cant relate to me  
From the floor to the floor  
And the sky to the sky  
Youve got to love and adore and the rest is a lie  
And if youre warm then you cant relate to me  
  
I said it before I wont say it again  
Love is a game to you lets not pretend  
Maybe if I fall asleep I wont breathe right right right  
  
Can nobody hear me  
Ive got a lot thats on my mind  
I cannot breathe  
Can you hear it too  
  
Leave your shoes at the door baby  
I am all you adore lately  
Come with me and we will run away  
  
Can nobody hear me  
Ive got a lot thats on my mind  
I cannot breathe  
Can you hear it too  
Can nobody hear me  
Ive got a lot thats on my mind  
I cannot breathe  
Can you hear it too
