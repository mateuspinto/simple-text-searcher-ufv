Been too long  
  
I miss you darling  
I miss you so hard  
  
I miss you darling  
I miss you so hard  
  
Miss you so hard  
Now  
Miss you darling  
Come back baby  
And dont break my heart  
How it goes  
  
And now Im alone lying down  
Looking up at the stars  
Stars  
Relivin the  
Relivin the times we shared when the moon the stars and the music was all  
  
Been way too long  
Been way too long baby  
Way too long  
Been way too long baby  
Way too long  
I cant wait too long baby  
Way too long  
I cant wait too long baby  
Way too long  
I cant wait too long baby  
Way too long  
I cant wait too long baby  
Way too long  
I cant wait too long baby  
Way too long  
I cant wait too long baby  
  
Baby you know that I  
Cant wait forever  
Awoke in the night again  
We were together  
Windows of darkness are  
All I can see through  
Searching the shadows  
Hoping to see you  
Baby you know that I  
Cant wait forever  
Awoke in the night again  
We were together  
Baby you know that I
