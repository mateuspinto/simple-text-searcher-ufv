So you crashed the plane  
And theres hell to pay  
Im making it plain  
I love you anyway  
  
You made a fool  
Out of me today  
Im breaking the rule  
I love you anyway  
  
You threw the blame  
What a role to play  
My storys the same  
I love you anyway  
  
You dealt the blow  
And you burst the ball  
Im letting you know  
I love you most of all  
  
Magic we chase only to find  
It comes from a place higher than mind  
Higher than dust but only just  
It hangs on the cusp  
  
I can hear you scream  
Like a branded slave  
Its only a dream  
I love you anyway  
  
Youve got a war to wage  
Chief to obey  
Foe to engage  
I love you anyway  
  
You hunker down  
Feeling small  
Judging the clown  
I love you most of all  
  
I picture you with the eye of my mind  
A portrait in blue unravaged by time  
Beauty undimmed and through your pale skin  
The beauty within  
  
So you beat the child  
Sent him away  
Beauty defiled  
I love you anyway  
  
You tricked the King  
Cut him where he lay  
Unthinkable thing  
I love you anyway  
  
You held the jewel  
And you let it fall  
Prince of a fool  
I love you most of all  
  
Over the wind under the hill  
wing upon wing love over will  
When the big me meets the big you  
The things we will do  
  
Ill make the time  
If you name the day  
Trouble or shine  
I love you anyway  
  
I think of you  
As child of clay  
Whatever you do  
I love yo anyway
