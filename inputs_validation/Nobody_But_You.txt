Everybody knows that Im just a Joe that likes to hang around  
Talking about my problems bringing other people down  
Well this may be so but not long ago I was sitting on the top of the world  
Sure is strange how things can turn themselves around  
  
When Im in need of a little bit of consultation used to call on my Uncle
John  
Took a trip down to West Virginia found him dead and gone  
And as some sort of silly little consolation they gave me a ticket back  
What you gonna do with folks like that  
  
You can talk about bands of angels  
And they think you come with your soul in your hands to set their children
free  
But you talk about little bit of understanding things that happen day to day  
Some of you folks sure enough have been good to me  
  
You come on talking about angel bands  
And they think you come with your soul in your hands just to set their
children free  
But you talk about little bit of understanding things that happen day to day  
Someone has been good to me  
  
Nobody but you nobody but you nobody but you nobody but you  
Nobody but you nobody but you nobody but you nobody but you  
Nobody but you say nobody nobody nobody nobody nobody but you
