God save our gracious Queen  
Long live our noble Queen  
God save the Queen  
  
Send her victorious  
Happy and glorious  
Long to reign over us  
God save the Queen  
  
Long may she reign  
  
O Lord our God arise  
Scatter the evil lies  
And make them fall  
  
Confound their politics  
Frustrate their empty tricks  
On thee our hopes we fix  
God save the Queen  
  
Long may she reign  
God save the Queen  
  
My country dissipates  
Sweet land of liberty  
On thee I see  
  
Land where my fathers died  
Land of the  cry  
From every mountainside  
Let freedom reign  
  
Let freedom reign  
Let freedom reign  
Let freedom reign  
Let freedom reign
