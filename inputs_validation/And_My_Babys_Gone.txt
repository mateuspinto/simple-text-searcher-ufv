Were not in love  
Anymore  
Im like a rich man  
Gone poor  
All my treasures are stolen  
Yeah all my treasures are stolen  
My baby  
My baby  
My baby  
My baby  
Yeah my baby is gone  
Without your heart  
Anymore  
Im like a room  
With no door  
Now when I walk and crawl  
Now when I walk and crawl  
But my baby  
Yeah my baby  
But my baby  
My baby  
My baby is gone  
Were not in love  
Anymore  
Im like a rich man  
Gone poor  
All my treasures are stolen  
Yeah all my treasures are stolen  
Oh my baby  
Yeah my baby  
Oh my baby  
Yeah my baby  
My baby  
My baby  
Oh oh my baby  
Oh my baby  
My baby  
My baby is gone  
Oh yeah
