I fold your letter  
All lies all cold  
I fold my memories  
My life my soul  
I fold compassion  
And vengeance bleeds through  
I fold forgiveness  
And wait for you  
Do you hear me  
Can you hear me fall  
Do you feel me  
Can you feel at all  
I hear you calling  
I hear you calling  
I fold all reason  
Screaming your name  
I fold Your heart and  
Feed on your pain  
I hear you calling  
I hear you calling  
Can you feel  
Can you feel
