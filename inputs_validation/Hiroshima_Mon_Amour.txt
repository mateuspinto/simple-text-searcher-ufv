Somehow we drifted off too far  
Communicate like distant stars  
Splintered voices down the phone  
The sunlit dust the smell of roses drifts oh no  
Someone waits behind the door  
Hiroshima mon amour  
  
Riding intercity trains  
Dressed in European grey  
Riding out to echo beach  
A million memories in the trees and sands oh no  
How can I ever let them go  
Hiroshima mon amour  
  
Meet beneath the autumn lake  
Where only echoes penetrate  
Walk through Polaroids of the past  
Futures fused like shattered glass the suns so low  
Turns our silhouettes to gold  
Hiroshima mon amour
