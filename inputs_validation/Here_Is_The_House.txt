Here is the house  
Where it all happens  
Those tender moments  
Under this roof  
Body and soul come together  
As we come closer together  
And is it happens  
It happens here in this house  
  
And I feel your warmth  
And it feels like home  
And theres someone  
Calling on the telephone  
Lets stay home  
Its cold outside  
And I have so much  
To confide to you  
  
With or without words  
Ill confide everything  
  
Here is the house  
Where it all happens  
Those tender moments  
Under this roof  
Body and soul come together  
As we come closer together  
And as it happens  
It happens here in this house  
  
So we stay at home  
And Im by your side  
And you know  
Whats going on inside  
Inside my heart  
Inside this house  
And I just want to  
Let it out for you  
  
And I feel your warmth  
And it feels like home  
And I feel your warmth  
And it feels like home  
  
Here is the house  
Where it all happens  
Those tender moments  
Under this roof  
Body and soul come together  
As we come closer together
