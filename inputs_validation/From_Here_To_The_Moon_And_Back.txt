I could hold out my arms say I love you this much  
I could tell you how long I will long for your touch  
How much and how far would I go to prove  
The depth and the breadth of my love for you  
From here to the moon and back  
Who else in this world will love you like that  
Love everlasting I promise you that  
From here to the moon and back  
From here to the moon and back  
  
I want you to know you can always depend  
On promises made and love without end  
No need to wonder how faithful Ill be  
Now and on into eternity  
  
From here to the moon and back  
Who else in this world will love you like that  
Forever and always Ill be where youre at  
From here to the moon and back  
From here to the moon and back  
  
I would blow you a kiss from the star where I sat  
I would call out your name to echo through the vast  
Thank heaven for you and to God tip my hat  
From here to the moon and back  
And Ill spend forever just proving that fact  
From here to the moon and back
