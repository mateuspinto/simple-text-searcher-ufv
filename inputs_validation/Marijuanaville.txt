Rollin my home grown Smokin a big bong  
Look at that Ganja covered with oil  
Using my tweezers Got pot in the freezer  
Made a new pipe out of aluminium foil  
Wasted away again in Marijuana Ville  
Searching for my roach clip on a rope  
On a rope On a rope On a rope  
Some people Claim that theres a woman to blame  
But I know that its all this damn dope  
Dont know the reason Satyed here all season  
Maybe that Tyestick was a way bit too strong  
But I got a real beauty A columbian doobie  
And soon Ill be up on my way along  
Wasted away again in Marijuana Ville  
Searching for my roach clip on a rope  
On a rope On a rope On a rope  
Some people Claim that theres a woman to blame  
But I know that its all this damn dope  
I blew out my bong pipe Ran out of budlight  
But I found some stash I had hidden at home  
Put it into a blender And soon it will render  
These little fudge brownies that help me get stoned  
  
Wasted away again in Marijuana Ville  
Searching for my roach clip on a rope  
On a rope On a rope On a rope  
Some people Claim that theres a woman to blame  
But I know that its all this damn dope  
Yes Some people Claim  
sing it like bob dyllon I sound like Dyllon when Im stoned  
But I know that its all this damn dope
