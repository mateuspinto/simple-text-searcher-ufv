They headed southward from San Francisco  
To be with chuckles and the others  
With electric in the air and peroxide in their hair  
They looked like golden brothers  
  
They drove a Datsun an automatic  
The radio blaring static  
He made a face into the light and burst out laughing at the sight  
The hysteria ensuing would dominate the night  
  
From all the candy the seats were sticky  
As they were drawn into the grapevine  
Then introduce yourself came on as they barreled through the fog  
The demon puffing madly on a mentholated log  
  
They were tired they were sleepy  
So they parked behind the Roxy  
Adam left to use the phone so he sat there all alone  
When Adams voice come beaming through on the radio  
He started laughing
