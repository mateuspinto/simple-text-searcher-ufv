Im a ticking time bomb  
Waiting to blow my top  
No one would ever know  
Not til I grew up  
  
No one would believe it  
He was such a normal guy  
Shake their heads and wonder why  
  
Martians fell from the sky  
What would that do to god  
Would we put the weapons down  
Or aim it up at the sky  
  
No one would believe it  
Except the fucking nut jobs  
They laugh and cry we told you so  
  
Baby when I get home  
I want to believe in Jesus  
Hammer in the final nail  
Help me pick up the pieces  
  
When everything starts to fall  
So fast that it terrifies you  
When will you hit the wall  
Are you gonna learn to fly  
  
No one would believe it  
Except for all the people  
Watching as you fly away  
  
Baby when I get home  
I want to pick up the pieces  
Hammer in the final nail  
And lean me up against Jesus  
  
Baby when I get home  
I want to pick up the pieces  
Hammer in the final nail  
I want to believe in Jesus
