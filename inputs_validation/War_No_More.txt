Light is in the air right now  
Two thousand and two rebel music  
The saga continues  
Listen children  
  
Whats the problem in Manhattan  
Every ten men they look like Bin Laden  
So I have problems when I go to the airport  
First thing they do they want to ask me for my passport  
The said Wyclef we love the Fugees the score  
But did anybody give you any strange package to bring on board  
I was like no  
Here comes your national guards  
This look like a scene from the movie Star Wars  
One foot in one foot out standing in the airplane  
Im on tour  
Im on my way to Japan  
First class dark shades  
Let the fuschia out bed  
I want to sleep but keep my eyes on the cock pit  
Why just think they stay target the pilot  
We gonna take over the plane  
Like the Los Angeles riot  
  
Riot  
Riot  
The Middle East  
The Middle East  
The street pack more heat than the Middle East  
The Middle East  
The Middle East  
When will the violence sleep in the Middle East  
The Middle East  
The street pack more heat than the Middle East  
The Middle East  
The Middle East  
When will the violence  
Say peace  
Say peace  
  
We dont want no war no more  
Let me hear the streets  
Peace oh peace  
We dont want no war no more  
Let me hear the Middle East now  
Peace now peace oh peace oh peace  
We dont want no war no more  
Let me hear the USA say peace  
Say peace  
Lord peace  
We dont want no war no more  
We dont want no war no more  
We dont want no war no more  
We dont want no war no more  
We dont want no war no more  
We dont want no war no more  
We dont want no war no more  
Ay peace  
Oh peace  
We dont want no war no more  
No no let me hear you say  
Peace peace  
Say peace say peace  
We dont want no war no more  
No no no no  
Say peace oh peace  
We dont want no war no more  
No more riots  
Riots
