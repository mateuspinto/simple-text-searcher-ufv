Somebody bigger than the Earth is round  
Bigger than the saddest frown  
Bigger than the brightest smile  
And longer than the longest mile  
  
Somebody bigger than the biggest fight  
And darker than the darkest night  
Bigger than the biggest gun  
Cause hes the only shining sun seemon  
  
Who made the mountains  
Who made the trees  
Who made the rivers that flow out to the seas  
And who hung the moon in the starry starry starry sky  
  
Chorus  
Somebody bigger  
I know I know hes bigger than you and I  
My God is bigger  
Somebody bigger  
Hes bigger hes bigger than you  
Hes bigger than you  
My God is my God is oh  
  
Now who made the flowers bloom in the spring yeah  
And who writes the songs for the robins to sing uh  
And who sends the rain when the Earth is dry  
I know I know I know  
Somebody bigger yeah  
Than you and I  
Somebody bigger than you and I  
Bigger than you and I  
  
He lights the way when road is alone  
Keeps me company with love to guide you  
He walks beside you just like he walks with me  
  
When I am weary and filled with despair  
Who gives me courage to go on and on and on from there  
And who gives me faith  
I will never never never never never doubt  
Somebody bigger yeah  
Somebody bigger than me and you  
Bigger than you and I  
Somebody bigger  
My Lord is bigger than you  
Bigger than you and I  
  
He lights the way when the road is long  
Keeps you company with love to guide you  
He walks beside you just like he walks with me  
  
Somebody bigger than you and I  
Bigger than the open sky  
Bigger than the tallest tree  
Bigger than the deepest sea  
Somebody deeper than the desert sands  
Bigger than the tallest man  
And phatter than the phattest phat  
Bigger than the Shaq attack  
  
Chorus
