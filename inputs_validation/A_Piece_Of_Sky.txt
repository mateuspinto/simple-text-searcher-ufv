No piece of sky  
For you Jimmy lad  
They always blame him  
They knew Jimmy was bad  
  
His own fault entirely  
To die without sound  
Thats how it is  
One staring at the ground  
  
And he wears his isolation  
As a widow wears a shroud  
They hammered him with discipline  
Screaming out loud  
  
As they did with Jesus  
With hammer and with nails  
Now the cell is quiet  
And the moonlight is pale  
  
No piece of sky  
For you Jimmy lad  
They always blame him  
They knew Jimmy was bad  
  
Tis own fault entirely  
To die without sound  
Thats how it is  
One staring at the ground  
  
Hes standing on the bedside chair  
The moonlight fills his cell  
No one ever peeked  
In jimmys private hell  
  
His only friend a makeshift rope  
His only key his only hope  
His neck breaks so easily  
And he doesnt make a sound  
  
No piece of sky  
For you Jimmy lad  
They always blame him  
They knew Jimmy was bad  
  
His own fault entirely  
To die without sound  
Thats how it is  
One staring at the ground  
  
His only friend a makeshift rope  
His only key his only hope  
His neck breaks so easily  
And he doesnt make a sound  
  
No piece of sky  
No piece of sky
