A thousand stars fill the summer sky  
tonight my love the beach belongs to you and I  
And here we are lying in the sand  
I hear the sound of music when you touch my hand  
  
Just like the waves crashing on the shore  
the echo of our love will last forevermore  
Tonight my love hold me tight my love  
as our hearts compose a summer symphony  
  
The symphony of a summer night  
The echo of our love will last forevermore  
  
But when morning comes and you go away  
Ill close my eyes and Ill still hear the music play  
The symphony of a summer night  
will last until the end of time  
The symphony of a summer night
