Close your eyes come with me  
And we soon will be  
In the wonderful world  
Of the young  
  
Hearts remain seventeen  
Dreams are evergreen  
In the wonderful world  
Of the young  
  
Fools may deny it  
Wise men know the truth  
They have discovered  
That love is youth  
  
Take this heart that I give  
And well always live  
In the wonderful world  
Of the young  
  
In the wonderful world  
Of the young mmmm  
In the wonderful world  
Of the young  
  
Fools may deny it  
Wise men know the truth  
They have discovered  
That love is youth  
  
Take this heart that I give  
And well always live  
In the wonderful world  
Of the young
