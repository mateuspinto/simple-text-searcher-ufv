Countin the cows every day  
By jimmy buffett  
1975  
Oh Im just a cowboy an old hired hand  
Never seen nothin majestic or grand  
I just received a great big tax return  
Now Im off to las vegas with money to burn  
  
Its been a while since I last left this town  
Bought a new suit and Im nevada bound  
Gonna make it gonna break it Ive been there before  
Nothins gone wrong this towns such a bore  
  
Chorus  
Aw the train leaves at seven all go to heaven  
Nothin here to make me stay  
Cause that las vegas glitter sure beats kitty litter  
Countin the cows every day  
  
Chorus  
Yeah the train leaves at seven on up to heaven  
Nothin here to make me stay  
Cause that las vegas glitter sure beats kitty litter  
Countin the cows every day  
And countin the cows every day
