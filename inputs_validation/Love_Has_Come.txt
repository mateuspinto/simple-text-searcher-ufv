Hurry now wake up your eyes  
Time for little ones to see  
Daddys got a big surprise  
Hiding there beneath the Christmas tree  
How they are like the child in me  
See the wonder in their eyes  
Like a fairytale come true  
One more time I realize  
All the love our lives found in you  
  
Love has come  
For the world to know  
As the wise men knew  
Such a long time ago  
And I believe that angels sang  
That hope had begun  
When the god of glory  
Who is full of mercy  
Sent his son  
  
If I could have a special dream  
Coming true on Christmas morn  
I would want the world to see  
How his father smiled when Christ was born  
The greatest gift the world has known  
So come on kids look high and low  
For all the toys youve dreamed to find  
But I believe youll never know  
A greater joy than Jesus love inside  
  
You gotta know  
Know  
Love has come  
For the world to know  
As the wise men knew  
Such a long time ago  
And I believe that angels sang  
That hope had begun  
When the god of glory  
Who is full of mercy  
Yes the god of glory  
Sent his son  
  
Dont you know that  
Love has come  
For the world to know know  
As the wise men knew  
Such a long time ago  
And I believe that angels sang  
That hope had begun  
When the god of glory  
Who is full of mercy  
Yes the god of glory  
Sent his son  
  
Love has come  
For the world to know  
As the wise men knew  
Such a long time ago  
And I believe that angels sang  
That hope had begun  
When the god of glory  
Who is full of mercy  
Yes the god of glory  
Sent his son  
  
Dont you know  
Love has come  
For the world to know  
As the wise men knew  
Such a long time ago  
And I believe that angels sang  
That hope had begun  
When the god of glory  
Who is full of mercy  
Yes the god of glory  
Sent his son

Love has come  
For the world to know  
As the wise men knew  
Such a long time ago
