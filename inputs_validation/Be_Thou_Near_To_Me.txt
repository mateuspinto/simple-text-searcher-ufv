Oh Lord I come with heart here open  
For in my hour of darkness I may be  
Seeking the joy of love unspoken  
Oh Lord be Thou near to me  
  
And the holy voices sing Hallelu  
Ever will Thy reign be  
As I wander through this life  
Oh Lord be Thou near to me  
  
Though in this burden of my making  
Yet in the shadows still a light I see  
Maker whose love is not forsaken  
Oh Lord be Thou near to me  
  
And the holy voices sing Hallelu  
Ever will Thy reign be  
As I wander through this life  
Oh Lord be Thou near to me  
  
And the holy voices sing Hallelu  
Ever will Thy reign be  
As I wander through this life  
Oh Lord be Thou near to me  
Oh Lord be Thou near to me
