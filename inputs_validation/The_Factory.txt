Early in the morning I feel a chill  
The factory whistle blows loud and shrill  
Id kill my wife or shed kill me  
But we gotta go to work in the factory  
Six days a week at the factory  
Up early in the morning at the factory

Kickin asbestos in the factory  
Punchin out Chryslers in the factory  
Breathin that plastic in the factory
