When years seem like days to me  
No time on my hands  
I run away to a place in me  
To a faraway land  
  
When home seems so far from me  
Heavens lights look dim  
Its just as far as my deepest heart  
Where my hearts Father lives  
  
His quiet voice speaking in silence everyday  
If I will only listen to the words He has to say  
Ill walk in His Spirit see Him in my face  
I will live cause He will live in my place  
  
When life seems so hard to bear  
When shadows look real  
The circumstance is your Fathers care  
Go by faith not what you feel  
  
If you have been running too  
Stop now in your tracks  
Turn again to the one in you  
Put your burden on His back  
  
His quiet voice speaking in silence everyday  
If I will only listen to the words He has to say  
Ill walk in His Spirit see Him in your face  
I will live cause He will live in my place  
  
When years seem like days to me  
No time on my hands  
I run away to a place in me  
To a faraway land
