I want to climb up in the sky with you  
To seize the stars and put them on your head  
I want to take you down  
Where the sun begins  
A journey on the clouds once again  
I wonder if I will ever see your face again  
And the rest of my opinion is of no importance  
Guess I have made a choice  
For us  
We are lost  
In this world  
We are lost  
In this time  
We are lost  
We decide  
We are lost  
We are lost lost in our own world  
It doesnt even matter if you like it or not  
We are lost lost in our own world  
It doesnt even matter if youre happy or not  
We are lost lost in are own world  
It doesnt even matter if you like it or not  
We are lost lost in our own world  
It doesnt even matter if youre happy or not
