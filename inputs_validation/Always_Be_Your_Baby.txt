You were my first love  
Always there for me  
You taught me how me to walk and how to dream  
God gave me your eyes  
But it was you who showed me how to see  
Now I can stand on my own  
But I know youll never let go  
  
Ill always be your baby  
No matter how the years fly by  
The way you loved me  
Made me who I am in this world  
Im a woman now  
Not a little girl  
Wherever this life takes me  
Ill always be your baby  
  
You are my hero  
And that will never change  
You still can dry my tears with just your smile  
The one Ive leaned on  
From my first steps  
To walking down the aisle  
Now theres another man in my life  
But I know by the look in your eyes  
  
Ill always be your baby  
No matter how the years fly by  
The way you loved me  
Made me who I am in this world  
Im a woman now  
Not a little girl  
Wherever this life takes me  
Ill always be your baby  
  
Your faith your love and all that you believe  
Have come to be the strongest part of me  
  
And I will always be your baby  
No matter how the years fly by  
The way you loved me  
Made me who I am in this world  
Im a woman now  
Not a little girl  
Wherever this life takes me  
Ill always be your baby
