Found a way to rid myself clean of pain  
And the fever thats been haunting me  
Has gone away  
  
Looking through my window  
I seem to recognize  
All the people passing by  
But I am alone  
And far from home  
And nobody knows me  
  
Never heard me say goodbye  
Never shall I speak to anyone again  
All days are in darkness  
And Im biding my time  
Once I am sure of my task I will rise again
