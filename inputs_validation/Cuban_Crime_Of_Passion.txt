Well now Billy Voltaire was a Piano player up from Miami way  
He used to play in the bars he could should like the stars  
And the Ladys would pay and pay  
Well one night he did wind up  
Playin in Havana town  
And nobody knew least Billy Voltaire that these were his final sounds  
  
He met up with Marita a dancer in from the coast  
Half woman half child she drove him half wild  
He loved that lady the most  
Well one night he did find her  
In the arms of Shrimper Dan  
So Billy pulled out a knife took poor Dannys life  
And then he turned his own cold hand  
  
Chorus  
Its just a Cuban crime of passion  
Messy and old fashioned  
Yeah thats what the papers did say  
Its just a Cuban crime of passion  
Anjejo and knives a slashin  
Yeah but thats what the people like to read about  
Up in America up in America  
  
Well they never found Marita  
Some people say she got ill  
Billy Voltaire had no one to claim him  
He was buried on paupers hill  
And no one talks about em no more  
It happned just a week ago  
But people get by and people get high  
In the tropics they come in they go  
  
Chorus  
  
Up in America
