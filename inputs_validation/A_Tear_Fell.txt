A fool am I a fool am I in love  
  
A tear fell when I saw you  
In the arms of someone new  
A tear fell when you left me  
All alone and feeling blue  
A tear fell when you told me  
That your love was not for me  
I didnt miss the teardrops  
But I missed you constantly  
A fool am I a fool am I in love  
  
The teardrops that you stepped on  
As you danced across the floor  
Were crushed like my poor heart was  
When you walked out of my door  
  
That the flame in your heart died  
Darlin have I lost you  
Like these teardrops from my eyes  
A fool am I a fool am I in love
