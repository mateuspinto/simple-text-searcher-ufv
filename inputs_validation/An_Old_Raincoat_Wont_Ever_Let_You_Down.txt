Did you ever stand and shiver  
while looking at a freezing river  
Have you froze to the bone  
with just a coat to keep you warm  
to keep you from a howlin wind  
to keep you from a howlin wind  
Now listen  
  
Have you perished in the drizzling rain  
Tried to light  a lift but all in vain  
With your sock on your head  
and that old coat on your back  
to keep you from the drizzlin rain  
oh to keep you from the drizzlin rain  
Goodbye  
  
One more time  
  
Did you sleep in a graveyard when it snowed  
Laid your head on a   
With the Times on your face  
and that old coat on your back  
That kept you from awithering away good God  
It just kept you from awithering away  
  
I know  
  
And did you ride a lift on a steam train  
Now listen  
Had the misfortune not to pay your fare  
Thrown off the next stop  
Thrown in the doorway of a shop  
With that coat to keep you from the wind  
Oh that old school coat to keep you from the wind  
And that aint all  
  
Have you had some good friends on the road with ya  
whod stand by you through thick and thin  
Heres to Kevin and Ben Susie and Len  
And that coat which never lets you down  
It never never never lets you down  
It never never never lets you down  
That old coat which never lets you down  
That old coat which never lets you down  
Kept me from the drizzlin rain  
And oh kept me from the drizzlin rain
