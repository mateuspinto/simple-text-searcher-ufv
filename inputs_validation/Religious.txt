I love lookin at you  
In the way God intended us  
Im talkin nothing but about a smile  
I love the sweat when we make love  
And you hear me singin  
  
Cause if its a touch you just ask  
Then Im glad I came  
All I can say is Hallelujah  
Hallelujah Hallelujah pretty baby  
You got me religious  
You got me religious  
You got me religious  
And all I can say  
Is Hallelujah  
Hallelujah Hallelujah pretty baby  
You got me religious  
You got me religious  
You got me religious  
  
I love being with you  
Cause I easily work door in you  
Your voice in my head is something like a choir of angels  
Easy like Sunday morning  
Your body makes me go  
Cause being around you is a blessing  
Thank God I can  
And all I can say is  
Hallelujah Hallelujah pretty baby  
You got me religious  
You got me religious  
You got me religious  
And all I can say  
Is Hallelujah  
Hallelujah Hallelujah pretty baby  
You got me religious  
You got me religious  
You got me religious  
  
When I see you in the morning  
Breakfast in the bed  
When you smile at me  
Youre in my head  
All I can see baby is your love  
All that I can see baby is your love  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
You got me religious  
You got me religious  
You got me religious  
I said that all I can say  
Is Hallelujah  
Hallelujah Hallelujah pretty baby  
You got me religious  
You got me religious  
You got me religious  
How fucking stupid bitch about makin love makin love
