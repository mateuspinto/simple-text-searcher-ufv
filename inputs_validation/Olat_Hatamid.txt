Judge of the earth who wilt arraign the nations at thy judgment seat with
life and favor bless again thy people prostrate at thy feet  
And mayest thou our morning prayer receive O lord as though it were the
offering that was wont to be brought day by day continually  
O thou whose mercy faiteth not to us thy heavenly grace accord  
Deal kindly with thy peoples lot and grant them life our king and lord  
Let thou the mark of life appear upon their brow from year to year as when
were daily want to be the offerings brought continually
