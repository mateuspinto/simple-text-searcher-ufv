Dashing through the snow  
In a one horse open sleigh  
Oer the fields we go  
Laughing all the way  
Bells on bobtails ring  
Making spirits bright  
What fun it is to ride and sing  
A sleighing song tonight  
Jingle bells jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh  
Jingle bells jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh  
Bells on bobtails ring  
Making spirits bright  
What fun it is to ride and sing  
A sleighing song tonight  
Jingle bells jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh  
Jingle bells jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh
