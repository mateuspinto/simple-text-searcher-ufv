Give me five minutes more only five minutes more  
Let me stay let me stay in your arms  
  
Here am I begging for only five minutes more  
Only five minutes more of your charms  
  
All week long I dreamed about our Saturday date  
Dont you know that Sunday morning you can sleep late  
  
Give me five minutes more Here am I begging for only five minutes more  
Let me stay let me stay  
Let me stay let me stay stay in your arms
