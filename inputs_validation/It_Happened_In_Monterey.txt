It happened in Monterey a long time ago  
I met her in Monterey in ol Mexico  
Stars an steel guitars and luscious lips as red as wine  
Broke somebodys heart and Im afraid that it was mine  
  
It happened in Monterey without thinkin twice  
I left her an threw away the key to Paradise  
My indiscreet heart longs for a sweetheart  
That I left in ol Monterey

I left her an threw away the key to Paradise  
My indiscreet heart longs for a sweetheart  
That I left in ol Monterey
