Deep in the back of my mind is an unrealized sound  
Every feeling I get from the street says it soon could be found  
When I hear the cold lies of the pusher I know it exists  
Its confirmed in the eyes of the kids emphasized with their fists  
  
But the high has to rise from the low  
Like volcanoes explode through the snow  
The mosquitos sting brings a dream  
But the poisons derange  
  
The music must change  
For were chewing a bone  
We soared like the sparrow hawk flied  
Then we dropped like a stone  
Like the tide and the waves  
Growing slowly in range  
Crushing mountains as old as the Earth  
So the music must change  
  
Sometimes at night I wake up and my bodys like ice  
The sound of the running wild stallion the noise of the mice  
And I wondered if then I could hear into all of your dreams  
I realize now it was really the sound of your screams  
  
But death always leads into life  
But the street fighter swallows the knife  
Am I so crazy to feel that its here prearranged  
  
The music must change  
Its gets higher and higher  
Smoldering like leaves in the 1  
Then it bursts into fire  
Its rhythm grows strong  
Its so new and so strange  
Like bells in the clouds then again  
The music must change  
  
But is this song so different  
Am I doing it all again  
It may have been done before  
But then musics an open door  
  
Deep in the back of my is an unrealized sound  
Every feeling I get from the street says it soon could be found  
When I hear the cold lies of the pusher I know it exists  
Its confirmed in the eyes of the kids emphasized with their fists  
  
But the high has to rise from the low  
Like volcanoes explode through the snow  
The mosquitos sting brings a dream  
But the poisons derange  
  
The music must change  
For were chewing a bone  
We soared like the sparrow hawk flied  
Then we dropped like a stone  
Like the tide and the waves  
Growing slowly in range  
Crushing mountains as old as the Earth  
So the music must change
