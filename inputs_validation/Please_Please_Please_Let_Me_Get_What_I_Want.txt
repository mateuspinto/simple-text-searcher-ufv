Good times for a change  
See the luck Ive had  
Can make a good man  
Turn bad  
  
So please please please  
Let me let me let me  
Let me get what I want  
This time  
  
Havent had a dream in a long time  
See the life Ive had  
Can make a good man bad  
  
So for once in my life  
Let me get what I want  
Lord knows it would be the first time  
Lord knows it would be the first time
