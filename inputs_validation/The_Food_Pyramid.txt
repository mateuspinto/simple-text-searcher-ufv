From Clone High  
  
The ancient pharohs were not to bright they say  
But they made one contribution that I live by to this day  
Its the food pyramid and its approved by the USDA  
  
Oh grains are the foundation so please take my advice  
Have five to eleven servings of bread cereal or rice  
Three to five of vegitables and four of fruits is best  
Thier antioxidents and fiber help you to digest  
Three servings of yogurt milk and cheese  
Will help your bones and subsidise the cattle industry  
A body needs to grow  
And growing takes proteins  
Thats why meat can be a tasty treat like fish or human beings  
And when you eat your sweets make sure you try  
To limit your servings or youll DIE  
  
EVERYBODY  
  
My body is a pyramid thats made of healthy food  
So do what we say  
yeah  
Eat right every day  
food  
I love you
