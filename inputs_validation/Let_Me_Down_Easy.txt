Is love behind me  
Though I need you to satisfy me  
Destiny will prove to divide me  
For youre a part of me  
I feel the love within you  
Your beauty lies deep within you  
Touching me when you feel the need to  
Become as one with me  
  
Chorus  
So let me down easy  
If ever you were to leave  
My love let me down easy  
For all I know is you  
  
Take you for granted  
That could never never be  
An advantage  
All this love and free from demanding  
You have always felt the need to be pleased  
And you stay close beside me  
Though our minds are free for deciding  
The life to lead and desiring  
To see what they can see  
  
Oooh  
Let me down easy  
If ever you were to leave  
My love let me down easy  
Ooohhh  
  
Ah Spending time time with you  
Counting the days of my life  
Oh hoping that that with me  
You will stay  
  
Chorus  
  
Being around you  
Lovely things I feel are about you  
Being strong until Im without you  
For youre the strength in me  
And you give me inspiration  
Realizing that it has taken  
More love and more love makin  
To fulfill my every need  
  
So for me  
Let me down easy  
If ever you were to leave  
My love let me down easy  
  
If ever you were to leave  
My love let me down  
Oh easy  
  
If ever you were to leave  
My loove let me down let me down let me down  
Easy baby  
  
Ohho Let me down hey down down down down  
Easy  
Hey if ever if ever ever ever you were to leave me
