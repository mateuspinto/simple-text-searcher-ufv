Every time is like the first time tenderly  
Loving yous like breathing spring  
Seasons change but your heart beats constantly  
Count my blessings every day as you love me  
As the sunset disappears across the northern sky  
You look for forever in my eyes  
All I can say long as I have a voice  
Ill thank God above that I was your first choice  
  
If I should die before I wake  
Ill go into the night whispering your name  
If lying in your arms is the last thing that I do  
At least I know that Ill be loved by you  
In about a hundred years from now  
When all of my love letters are found  
And someone reads these words Ive written only meant for you  
Theyll know how forever came true  
  
If I should die before I wake  
Ill go into the night whispering your name  
If lying in your arms is the last thing that I do  
At least I know that Ill be loved by you  
In about a hundred years from now  
When all of my love letters are found  
And someone reads these words Ive written only meant for you  
Theyll know how forever came true  
  
Let the years roll on by  
These are the best times of my life  
Ill just smile when my days are through  
Knowing that Ive been loved by you  
At least I know that Ive been loved by you
