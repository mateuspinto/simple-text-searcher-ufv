You used to stand on the tables  
You used to shoot out the lights  
You used to stop trucks on aisle 19  
In your blue leopard tights  
You got the vote of your high school  
Most likely to exceed  
But not likely to ever get enough  
Enough of what you need  
Enough of the night  
Enough of the night  
And now the carnival lights come down  
The sounds of laughter recede  
You sit and drink in this cardboard town  
The fast lane gone to seed  
You used to laugh about the damage done  
But there was no way to know  
How little distance you had actually come  
And how far youd have to go  
Its tough to do baby its tough to make it  
When the heart is naked  
Its tough for you baby its tough for me too  
Without all this pain to see through  
Now I want to see you smile  
You know how its just been awhile  
Dont allow another night to close  
On your empty cup youve had enough of those  
Enough of the night  
Enough of the night  
You used to count on the miracles  
The old shot in the dark  
You used to wait for the setting sun  
To help you hit your mark  
You used to stand on the tables  
You used to shoot out the lights  
You dressed right out of the fables baby  
Like the Arabian Nights  
But you were never the princess  
More like the queen of the thieves  
And my heart was never more than one of the many  
A queen receives  
Its tough to do baby its tough to make it  
When the heart is naked  
Its tough for you baby its tough for me too  
Without this disdain to see through  
Now I want to see you smile  
You know how its just been awhile  
Dont allow another heart to pass  
Beyond your reach say baby not so fast hey baby not so fast  
Youve had enough of the night  
To fill the street with tears  
Youve had enough of those empty hours  
To last a thousand years  
Enough of the night  
Enough of the tears  
Enough of the night  
Enough of the tears  
Enough of the night  
Enough of tears  
She got enough of the night  
She had enough of the tears baby  
She had enough of night  
She got enough of had enough of the night  
She got enough of bop bop baby  
You got enough of night  
You had enough of tears bop bop bop  
She got enough of
