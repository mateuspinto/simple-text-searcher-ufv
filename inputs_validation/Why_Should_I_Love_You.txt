This chapter says  
Put it out of your mind  
Give it time  
  
The fine purple  
The purest gold  
The red of the Sacred Heart  
The gray of a ghost  
The L of the lips are open  
To the O of the host  
The V of the velvet  
  
Of all of the people in the world  
Why should I love you  
Theres just something bout you  
Theres just something bout you  
Of all the people in the world  
Why should I love you  
  
Have you ever seen a picture  
Of Jesus laughing  
Mmm do you think  
He had a beautiful smile  
A smile that healed  
  
Of all the people in the world  
Why should I love you  
Theres just something bout you  
Theres just something bout you  
Of all the people in the world  
Why should I love you  
Of all the people in the world  
Why should I love you  
  
The fine purple  
The purest gold  
The red of the Sacred Heart  
The gray of a ghost  
The L of the lips are open  
The O of the host  
The V of the velvet  
The E of my eye  
The eye in wonder  
The eye that sees  
The I that loves you  
  
Of all the people in the world  
Why should I love you
