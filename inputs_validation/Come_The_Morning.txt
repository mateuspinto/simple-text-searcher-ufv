I sit upon the bed in my rented room and watch  
The broken shadows from the street lights playing tag upon the wall  
Down the street a neon light is reaching out to mock the night  
And all the little fears that darkness brings  
  
The smoke of my last cigarette still hangs upon the air and yet  
I reach to light another from the pack thats nearly gone  
And the dawn seems a million miles away but all the while  
  
Down in the trainyard the graveyard shift had just come on  
And turned their ragged collars against the drizzling rain  
Back and forth the yard engine goes about the pulling out  
The railroad cars that soon will be making up the train  
Thats gonna be come the morning  
  
I wonder if I ever cross the mind of someone  
That I might have learned to love  
Had I ever chose to try  
Or did she fail to think about me in the lonely nights without me  
Was she the last to care if I should live or die  
  
Ive been a nameless ghost that rides the empty wave of memory  
In the dark deserted closets of the mind of someone else  
And now Im a ghost unto myself but still I know  
  
And now I cross the room and stand before the open window  
And reach out to touch the rain thats slowly falling on my hand  
The pavement hot and cold below looks back at me and seems to know  
It ends without a tear without a smile  
  
And in those last brief seconds could it be I was mistaken  
Or did I hear a voice somewhere that softly called my name  
Or was it just a whistle of a train for all the while  
  
Down in the trainyard the graveyard shift had just gone home  
To hang their clothes to dry them bar their doors against the rain  
The yard engine breathe a sigh Then pulls a last grey coal car by  
Then moves aside to look with pride Upon the new born train  
That I wont take come the morning  
  
I wonder if I ever cross the mind of someone  
That I might have learned to love  
Had I ever chose to try  
Or did she fail to think about me in the lonely nights without me  
Was she the last to care if I should live or die
