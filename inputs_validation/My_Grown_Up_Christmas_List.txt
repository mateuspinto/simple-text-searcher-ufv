Do you remember me  
I sat upon your knee  
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies  
Well Im all grown up now  
And still need help somehow  
Im not a child but my heart still can dream  
  
So heres my lifelong wish  
My grown up Christmas list  
Not for myself but for a world in need  
No more lives torn apart  
That wars would never start  
And time would heal all hearts  
And everyone would have a friend  
And right would always win  
And love would never end no  
This is my grown up Christmas list  
  
As children we believe  
The grandest sight to see  
Was something lovely wrapped beneath the tree  
But Heaven only knows  
That packages and bows  
Can never heal a heartached human soul  
  
No more lives torn apart  
That wars would never start  
And time would heal all hearts  
And everyone would have a friend  
And right would always win  
And love would never end no  
This is my grown up Christmas list  
  
What is this illusion called the innocence of youth  
Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth  
  
No more lives torn apart  
That wars would never start  
And time would heal all hearts  
And everyone would have a friend  
And right would always win  
And love would never end no  
This is my grown up Christmas list  
This is my only lifelong wish  
This is my grown up Christmas list
