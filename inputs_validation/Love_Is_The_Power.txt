Tell me how long can we go on this way  
Just to be strong  
We talk through the night  
But never reach the other side  
We fill our lives  
With endless words an aimless search  
  
When all that we need we hold within our hearts  
When will we find our way out of the dark  
  
Chorus  
We know that  
Love is the power love is the key  
Love is the reason reason to believe  
Love is the answerwhen we will see  
Love is the power love is the power we need  
  
Look at our lives  
Look at this world weve made  
We close our eyes and oh the price we pay  
We reach for the sky  
But never get beyond our pride  
  
Fighting like fools  
This faithless game is such a shame  
  
When all that we need we hold within our hands  
Oh when will we find the faith to understand  
  
Chorus  
  
All that we need we hold within our hands  
Oh when will we find the faith to understand  
  
Chorus
