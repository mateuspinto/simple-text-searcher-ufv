Yesterday we lost our lives tomorrow we were born  
Fortunes smiled upon us sacrifice the Argus  
All that he might help us see  
  
Magna eyes that track for miles looking for disease  
Puzzled by the mountains tricked by the sea  
and the argus is practiced compassion  
with an eye on you as one is on me  
will the god eye grant his forgiveness  
and allow he thats lived a reason to see  
Counting days and building walls bells ring sos to warn  
All the sings that guide us chosen by the Argus  
Tell me has chosen you  
  
Led by form we shed our soul  
Trusting like a child  
See the dark face that saved us  
Drink from his empty eyes  
  
and the argus is practiced compassion  
with an eye on you as one is on me  
will the god eye grant his forgiveness  
letting droplets of light erupt from the sea  
  
Lying in beds of garlic and orchid he closes an eye which closes another  
And in sleep he dreams of watching and looking and feather clouds dancing  
He curls up his lid and sleeps  
  
Swirling with visions on mans confusion  
All of the work done just to appease him  
The Argus he cries though love has its place in the sun  
Its only mans fear that carries him on
