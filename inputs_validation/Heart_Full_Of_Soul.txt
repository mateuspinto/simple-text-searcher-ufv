Sick at heart and lonely deep in dark despair  
When you want her only tell me where is she where  
And if she says to you that she dont love me  
Just give her my message tell her of my plea  
And I know if I could have her back again I would never make her sad  
I got a heart full of soul I got a heart full of soul  
Shes been gone such a long time longer than I can bear  
But if she says she wants me tell her Ill be there  
  
And I know if I could have her back again I would never make her sad  
I got a heart full of soul I got a heart full of soul  
Sick at heart and lonely deep in dark despair  
When you want her only tell me where is she where  
And if she says to you that she dont love me  
Just give her my message tell her of my plea  
And I know if I could have her back again I would never make her sad  
I got a heart full of soul I got a heart full of soul  
I got a heart full of soul
