Written by Scott Krippayne John Lemonis Tony Wood  
A simple offering is all that we bring  
We give our lives claim You as King  
We are Your servants and before You we bow  
With every breath we make this vow  
Chorus  
We will live to worship give You praise  
With all our hearts for all our days  
Father we want to do what You created us to  
We will live to worship You  
Our every moment is a gift of Your grace  
We are all Yours now and always  
More than just words oh Lord the cry of our hearts  
Is to let our lives speak of how great You are  
Chorus  
You are worthy You are holy  
You alone are deserving  
You are holy You are worthy  
You alone are deserving  
Chorus
