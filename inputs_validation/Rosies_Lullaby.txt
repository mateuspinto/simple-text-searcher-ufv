She walked by the ocean  
And waited for a star  
To carry her away  
  
Feelin so small  
At the bottom of the world  
Lookin up to God  
  
She tries to take deep breaths  
To smell the salty sea  
As it moves over her feet  
  
The water pulls so strong  
And no one is around  
And the moon is looking down  
  
Sayin  
Rosie come with me  
Close your eyes and dream  
  
The big ships are rollin  
And lightin up the night  
And she calls out but they just her pass by  
  
The waves are crashin  
But not making a sound  
Just mouthing along  
  
Sayin  
Rosie come with me  
Close your eyes and dream  
Close your eyes and dream  
Close your eyes and dream
