Long afloat on shipless oceans  
I did all my best to smile  
Til your singing eyes and fingers  
Drew me loving to your isle  
  
And you sang Sail to me sail to me let me enfold you  
Here I am here I am waiting to hold you  
  
Did I dream you dreamed about me  
Were you hare when I was fox  
Now my foolish boat is leaning  
Broken lovelorn on your rocks  
  
For you sing Touch me not touch me not come back tomorrow  
Oh my heart oh my heart shies from the sorrow  
  
Im as puzzled as The Oyster alt as a newborn child  
Im as troubled as the tide  
Should I stand amid the breakers  
Or should I lie with death my bride  
Hear me sing Swim to me swim to me let me enfold you  
Oh my heart oh my heart is waiting to hold you
