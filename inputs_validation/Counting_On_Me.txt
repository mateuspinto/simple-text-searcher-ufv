Why cant you ever back down  
Why cant you just shut your face  
Oh God the feelings I feel  
Would get me thrown in a cage  
Youre the one whos always screaming at me  
Im the one that keeps your lives so care free  
What the fuck more do you want me to be  
Why must you do this to me  
  
Run away I cant stay  
Lead the way make them pay  
  
Counting on me  
Always hoping Ill be  
There for all of your problems  
And in turn youre never there for me  
You sucked the life out of me  
You hate everything you see  
I cant take this anymore  
I always stay when I should leave  
  
You see the pain in my face  
While you keep putting me down  
Inside the rage starts to build  
You push me I wont go down  
Youre the one whos always screaming at me  
Im the one that keeps your lives so care free  
What the fuck more do you want me to be  
Why must you do this to me  
  
Run away I cant stay  
Lead the way make them pay  
  
Counting on me  
Always hoping Ill be  
There for all of your problems  
And in turn youre never there for me  
You sucked the life out of me  
You hate everything you see  
I cant take this anymore  
I always stay when I should leave  
  
Could it really be the day today  
Could this really make the problems go away  
Im going to hurt just not in time  
  
Right now  
Im taking all I can now  
Right now  
Youve torn us all apart  
Right now  
There is nothing you can do to stop me  
Right now right now right now right now  
Right now right now right now right now  
Right  
  
Counting on me  
Always hoping Ill be  
There for all of your problems  
And in turn youre never there for me  
You sucked the life out of me  
You hate everything you see  
I cant take this anymore  
I always stay when I should leave  
  
Counting on me  
Always hoping Ill be  
There for all of your problems  
And in turn youre never there for me  
You sucked the life out of me  
You hate everything you see  
I cant take this anymore  
I always stay when I should leave
