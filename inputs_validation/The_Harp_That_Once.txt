The harp that once  to oombayga and family  
  
The harp that once through taras halls  
The soul of music shed  
Now hangs as mute on taras walls  
As if that soul were fled  
So sleeps the pride of former days  
So glorys thrill is oer  
And the hearts that once beat high for praise  
Now feel that pulse no more  
No more to chiefs and ladies bright  
The harp of tara swells  
The chord alone that breaks at night  
Its tale of ruin tells  
Thus freedom now so seldom wakes  
The only throb she gives  
Is when some heart indignant breaks  
To show that still she lives
