I wish I could tell you  
But the words would come out wrong  
Oh if you only knew  
The way I felt for so long  
I know that were worlds apart  
But I just dont seem to care  
These feelings in my heart  
Only with you I want to share  
  
The first time I caught a glimpse of you  
Then my thoughts were only of you  
  
I hope that when time goes by  
You will think the same about me  
Many nights awake I lie  
I only wish that you could see  
I know that were only friends  
I hope this feeling never ends  
If I could only hold you  
Its the only thing I want to do  
  
The first time I caught a glimpse of you  
Then my thoughts were only of you
