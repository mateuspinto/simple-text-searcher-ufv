Ive been thinkin bout  
Thinkin bout sex  
Always hungry for somethin  
That I havent had yet  
Well maybe baby you got somethin to lose  
Well I got somethin  
I got somethin for you  
  
My way your way  
Anything goes tonight  
My way your way  
Anything goes  
  
Panties round your knees  
With your ass in debris  
Doing that grind  
With a push and a squeeze  
Tied up tied down  
Up against the wall  
Be my rubbermade baby  
And we can do it all  
  
My way your way  
Anything goes tonight
