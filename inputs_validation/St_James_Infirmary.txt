It was down by old Joes barroom on the corner of the square  
They were serving drinks as usual and the usual crowd was there  
On my left stood Big Joe McKennedy and his eyes were bloodshot red  
And he turned his face to the people these were the very words he said  
  
I was down to St James infirmary I saw my baby there  
She was stretched out on a long white table  
So cool so sweet and so fair  
  
Let her go let her go God bless her  
Wherever she may be  
She may search this whole wide world over  
Never find a sweeter man as me  
  
When I die please bury me in my high top Stetson hat  
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch chain  
The gangll know I died standing pat  
  
Let her go let her go God bless her  
Wherever she may be  
She may search this wide world over  
Never find a sweeter man as me  
  
I want six crapshooters to be my pallbearers  
Three pretty women to sing a song  
Stick a jazz band on my hearse wagon  
Raise hell as I stroll along  
  
Let her go Let her go  
God bless her  
Wherever she may be  
She may search this whole wide  
World over  
Shell never find a sweeter  
Man as me
