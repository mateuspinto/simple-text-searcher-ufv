He came from the East  
They called him a beast  
This king of terror insane  
Neutron Ronnie the people would whisper his name  
  
Dangerous and mad  
A torch in his hand  
Spread fire by the light of the moon  
Ooh pyrotechnical wizard of doom  
  
Oh no here comes Ronnie  
Ah the bombers insane  
Ah till he dies itll burn in his eyes  
  
A phantom so cool  
A midnight would rule  
And molotov cocktail would rain  
Babies screamin  
And house would go up in flames  
  
When next Ronnie goes nobody knows  
But inside hims where Lucifer hides  
Ooh hes the boy with the bombs at his side  
  
Ooh no here comes Ronnie ah the boy with the flame  
Ah his life has been burning inside  
Oh no no here comes Ronnie  
Ah the bombers insane  
Ah till he dies the burning in his eyes  
  
Oh no here comes Ronnie  
Ah the boy with the flame  
Ah his life has been burning inside  
Oh no no here comes Ronnie  
Ah the bombers insane  
As till he dies the burning in his eyes
