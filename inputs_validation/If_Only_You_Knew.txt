I can lift you with my heart  
Give you meaning every day  
Cannot live without your truth  
  
And be the true me  
To be the true you  
  
Pick the flowers from your floor  
Put them in your arms for you my love  
Realize my life and more  
  
Say you will n then  
  
Take me home  
Make me clear  
It feels so much better  
Take me home  
To this heart of hearts  
  
If only you knew  
You caught me when I was falling  
Yes you caught me when I was falling fast  
  
And only you knew  
You answered me when I was calling you  
You saw me when I was dreaming you  
Into my life  
  
Everyone who looks at you  
Sees the loving in your every move  
Youre the healing of the soul  
  
To be the true you  
To be the true me  
  
I will be your strength all time  
Ever wishing you this love and more  
Forever be your guiding song  
  
Say you will and then  
  
Take me home  
Make me clear  
To feel so much better  
In this life  
In your heart of hearts  
  
If only you knew  
How you caught me when I was falling  
Yes you caught me when I was falling fast  
  
And only you knew  
You answered me when I was calling you  
You saw me when I was dreaming you  
Into my life  
  
When I feel the hurt in so many peoples lives  
I take a deep breath and think of your smile your eyes  
  
When I hear the sadness of this earth time  
Then I take a deep breath and know that you understand  
That you understand  
  
And only you knew  
How you caught me when I was falling fast  
Caught me when I was falling fast  
  
If only you knew  
How you answered me when I was calling you  
You saw me when I was dreaming you  
  
If only you knew  
Yes you caught me when I was falling fast  
You caught me when I was falling  
Into your life
