By your heart strings Im hanging from a dream  
Gently swinging in the warm autumn breeze  
  
Come look at the scars smother a heart opening up  
Look at the scars smother a heart opening up no more  
  
Tip toeing along a strand of your hair suspended between  
These thoughts and actions miles above reality  
  
Come look at the scars smother a heart opening up  
Look at the scars smother a heart opening up  
  
Come look at the scars smother a heart opening up  
Look at the scars smother a heart opening up  
  
Look at the scars smother a heart opening up  
Look at the scars smother a heart opening up  
  
Look at the scars smother a heart opening up  
Look at the scars smother a heart opening up  
  
Opening up opening up opening up opening up  
Look at the scars you open me up open me up  
Smother a heart opening up opening up  
Look at the scars you open me up opening up open me up
