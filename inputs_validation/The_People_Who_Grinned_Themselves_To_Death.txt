They smiled so much and waved their flags  
As she saluted to the military band  
Most of the people failed to see  
She had a broken bottle in the other hand  
And she took them by surprise  
When she took them by the throat  
And said My friend youre not allowed to vote  
But they shook it all off  
With a nervous laugh and cough  
Next time she said Ill let those people choke  
  
The people who grinned themselves to death  
Smiled so much they failed to take a breath  
And even when their kids were starving  
They all thought the queen was charming  
  
She polished all upon the wall  
And ran her hands right through her hair  
So if the lady took the time to call  
All the houses on the street would not compare  
  
And she thought it really funny  
That she hadnt any money  
But those she looked up to they had  
But they shook it all off  
With a nervous laugh and cough  
And when they took her riches it was sad  
  
The people who grinned themselves to death  
Smiled so much they failed to take a breath  
And even when their kids were starving  
They all thought the queen was charming
