If I could  
Id protect you from the sadness in your eyes  
Give you courage in a world of compromise  
Yes I would  
  
If I could  
I would teach you all the things Ive never learned  
And Id help you cross the bridges that Ive burned  
Yes I would  
  
If I could  
I would try to shield your innocence from time  
But the part of life I gave you isnt mine  
Ive watched you grow so I could let you go  
  
If I could  
I would help you make it through the hungry years  
But I know that I could never cry your tears  
But I would If I could  
  
Yes If I live  
In a time and place where you dont want to be  
You dont have to walk along this road with me  
My yesterday wont have to be your way  
  
If I knew  
I would try to change the world I brought you to  
And there isnt very much that I could do  
But I would If I could  
  
Oh baby  
Daddy wants to protect you  
And help my baby through the hungriest  
Cause your part of me  
And if you ever ever need  
Said a shoulder to cry on  
Or just someone to talk to  
Ill be there Ill be there  
  
I didnt change your world  
But I would if I could  
  
Oh darling I love you baby
