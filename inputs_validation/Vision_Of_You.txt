Time moves a summer wind  
I can see your face again  
Was it such a tragedy  
Being you being me  
  
Smoke clears the picture fades  
But I stay back in yesterday  
All the strangers come and go  
All of them will never know  
  
Chorus  
Nobodys touch feels like your touch  
Nobody gets to me that much  
Nobodys kiss moves me inside  
And I have no place left to hide  
Tell me what can I do  
I have a vision of you  
Tell me what can I do  
With this vision of you  
  
Did I walk Did you run  
Whats the way to love someone  
Oh my darling did we know  
What it meant when we let go  
  
Chorus  
  
With this vision of you  
  
How can a candle ever burn so bright  
Casting a shadow on my life  
I am blinded by your light  
Even without you  
  
Chorus  
  
With this vision of you  
Tell me what can I do  
I have a vision of you  
Tell me what can I do  
With this vision of you
