First the tide rushes in  
Plants a kiss on the shore  
Then rolls out to sea  
And the sea is very still once more  
So I rush to your side  
Like the oncoming tide  
With one burning thought  Will your arms open wide  
At last were face to face  
And as we kiss through an embrace  
I can tell I can feel you are love your are real  
Really mine in the rain  
In the dark in the sun  
Like the tide at its ebb  
Im at peace in the web of your arms
