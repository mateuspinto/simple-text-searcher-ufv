I never who wouldve thought baby  
Thought Id be missing you baby  
Without you I need you baby  
By me why me

Ja Rule  
Love what your body does to me  
On me asking me off that ecstasy  
Reminiscing how we used to smoke and freak  
Fuck then fall asleep locking for a week  
Now we barely even talk and walk the block  
Kiss and cuddle up girl we losing touch  
Whats a man to do but go crazy babe  
I know you mad but you dont really hate me babe  
Its deeper than that now  
  
Chorus 1  
Baby if we got together again  
Sugar Ima be your very best friend  
I would love you unconditionally  
Youre never gonna let me go baby  
  
Promise I will be by your side  
Ill be everything you need to get by  
What I broke you know we finally mend  
Baby if we got together again  
  
Nate  
Sometimes I close my eyes and just pretend  
What if I had a chance to do it all again  
Sometimes for happiness we hesitate  
Just like the game I need the love wont wait  
And if I had another best friend  
What if I had someone on whom I could depend  
Someone who makes me feel like you used to  
Tell me baby what would you do

Ja Rule  
Why would you want to go through the pain  
The loving another name  
The truth is nobody can love you like I can  
Its a damn shame  
We cant even get along  
We used to get it on whered it all go wrong  
I admit the flesh is weak  
But the game is strong  
We go my way your way baby we moving on  
Its true goin miss you  
Who wouldve thought Id be without you  
  
Mariah Carey Ja Rule  
I never thought baby theres nothing to lose  
Thought Id be you know my souls so cold  
Without you and my love is pain  
By me spit it one more time  
I never thought my baby  
Thought Id be pride and joy  
Without you Ima make you mine  
By me no doubt whoa
