The sky is falling  
Human race that we run  
It left me crawling  
Staring straight at the sun  
Only a moment I notice  
Every dog has his day  
I paid attention  
Cost me so much to today  
  
For so long  
I saw only wrong  
But now to remind  
Its a waste of time  
  
Close your eyes and see the skies are falling  
  
I wanted something  
Nothing blank I dont know  
Its all deflecting  
Stones are easy to throw  
Only a moment I notice  
Hours days left behind  
Of wasted useless  
Selfless none of a kind  
  
For so long  
I saw only wrong  
But now to remind  
Not to go back to the low  
That has drained my life so low  
That has drained my life so low  
That has drained my life so low  
  
Close your eyes and see the skies are falling
