I watched out the window  
As you drove away  
But we got so much history baby  
Too much good love to throw away  
  
I know I can be a headstrong man  
Got a jealous streak a country mile wide  
Its just that Im so damn scared of losing you  
As youre fading out of sight  
  
Ooh ooh I dont why I do this every time  
Ooh ooh run the other way from a heart like mine  
  
Im doing the same things  
I saw my father do  
Cause I was just a kid in the corner  
Watching words as they turned black and blue  
  
Im the son of a son of a headstrong man  
So defensive so full of foolish pride  
But I just will not lose you baby  
And Im starting to realize  
  
Ooh ooh I think I know why I do this every time  
Ooh ooh run the other way from a heart like mine  
  
I know the love that we got is good  
Can I be a better man yeah I know I could  
Standing here in the middle of this moonlit road  
I know just what I have to do  
  
Ooh ooh Im runnin to ya fast as I can tonight  
Ooh ooh gotta show you what its like gotta show you what its like  
To be loved so loved by a heart like mine  
Gonna wrap my arms around you as strong as young desire  
Cause for you its all beating in a heart like mine
