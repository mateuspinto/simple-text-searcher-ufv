Feel Im goin back to Massachusetts  
Somethings telling me I must go home  
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts  
The day I left her standing on her own  
  
Tried to hitch a ride to San Francisco  
Gotta do the things I wanna do  
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts  
They brought me back to see my way with you  
  
Talk about the life in Massachusetts  
Speak about the people I have seen  
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts  
And Massachusetts is one place I have seen  
  
I will remember Massachusetts
