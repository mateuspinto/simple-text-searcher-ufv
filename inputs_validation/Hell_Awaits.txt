Existing on damnations edge  
The priest had never known  
To witness such a violent show  
Of power overthrown  
  
Angels fighting aimlessly  
Still dying by the sword  
Our legions killing all in sight  
To get the one called Lord  
  
The Gates of Hell lie waiting as you see  
Theres no price to pay just follow me  
I can take your lost soul from the grave  
Jesus knows your soul can not be saved  
  
Crucify the so called Lord  
He soon shall fall to me  
Your souls are damned your God has fell  
To slave for me eternally  
Hell awaits  
  
The Reaper guards the darkened Gates  
That Satan calls his home  
Demons feed the furnace where  
The Dead are free to roam  
  
Lonely children of the night  
Theres seven ways to go  
Each leading to the burning hole  
The Lucifer controls  
  
Priests of Hades seek the sacred star  
Satan sees the answer lies not far  
Zombies screaming souls cry out to you  
Satanic laws prevail your life is through  
  
Pray to the moon when it is round  
Death with you shall then abound  
What you seek for cant be found  
In sea or sky or underground  
  
Now I have you deep inside my everlasting grasp  
The seven bloody Gates of Hell  
Is where youll live your last  
  
Warriors from Hells Domain  
Will bring you to your Death  
The flames of Hades burning strong  
Your soul shall never rest  
  
The Gates of Hell lie waiting as you see  
Theres no price to pay just follow me  
I can take your lost soul from the grave  
Jesus knows your soul can not be saved  
  
Sacrifice the lives of all I know they  
Soon shall die  
Their souls are damned to rot in Hell  
and keep the fire growing deep inside  
Hell awaits
