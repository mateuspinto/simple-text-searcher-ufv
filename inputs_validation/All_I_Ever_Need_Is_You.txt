Sometimes when Im down and all alone  
Just like a child without a home  
The love you give me keeps me hangin on  
Oh honey all I ever need is you  
Youre my first love youre my last  
Youre my future youre my past  
And loving you is all I ask honey  
All I ever need is you  
Winters come and they go and we watch the melting snow  
Sure as summer follows spring all the things you do  
Give me a reason to build my world around you  
Some men follow rainbows I am told  
Some men search for silver some for gold  
I have found my treasure in your soul honey  
All I ever need is you  
Without love Id never find the way  
Through ups and downs of every single day  
I wont sleep at night until you say my honey  
All I ever need is you
