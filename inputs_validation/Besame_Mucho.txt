One time in South America  
Met a boy in Colombia  
Couldnt understand a word he said  
So he took my hand instead  
It was late as we ignored the time  
Now I cant get this stranger off my mind  
I think about him when I wear this dress  
I still smell him in my hair  
  
Was it that him making you sweat  
Was it the beat of the drum on my heart and my chest  
  
Eres muy bonita y sed  
No puedo esperar a verte otra vez  
I cant wait till I see you again  
Besame mucho princesa  
And then we dance  
  
He said besame mucho  
He kisses my head and we dance  
  
It was time for me to say goodbye  
Couldnt stand to look him in the eye  
Wouldve kissed him if I had the time  
Couldve have sworn it was on his mind  
Was it his lips the way he moves his ways  
Hands on my hips  
Oh just a look of desire on his face  
  
Eres muy bonita y sed  
No puedo esperar a verte otra vez  
I cant wait till I see you again  
Besame mucho princesa  
And then we dance  
  
He said besame mucho  
He kisses my head  
And then I  
I close my eyes  
For a moment in time  
In the blink of the night  
I submit the crown  
He was young until it found  
When I turned around  
But I swear I can still hear him now  
  
Eres muy bonita y sed  
No puedo esperar a verte otra vez  
I cant wait till I see you again  
Besame mucho princesa  
And then we dance  
  
He said besame mucho  
He kisses my head and then we dance  
We dance  
Eres muy bonita y sed
