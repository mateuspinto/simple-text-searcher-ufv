Unruly boys  
Who will not grow up  
Must be taken in hand  
Unruly girls  
Who will not settle down  
They must be taken in hand  
  
A crack on the head  
Is what you get for not asking  
And a crack on the head  
Is what you get for asking  
  
Unruly boys  
Who will not grow up  
Must be taken in hand  
Unruly girls  
Who will not settle down  
They must be taken in hand  
  
A crack on the head  
Is what you get for not asking  
And a crack on the head  
Is what you get for asking  
  
Noa crack on the head  
Is what you get for not asking  
And a crack on the head  
Is what you get for asking  
  
A crack on the head  
Is just what you get  
Why Because of who you are  
And a crack on the head  
Is just what you get  
Why Because of what you are  
A crack on the head  
Because of   
Those things you said  
Things you said  
The things you did

Who will not grow  
Must be taken in hand  
Unruly girls  
Who will not grow  
They must be taken in hand
