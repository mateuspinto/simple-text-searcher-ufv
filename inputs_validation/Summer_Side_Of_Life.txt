He came down through fields of green  
On the summer side of life  
His love was ripe  
  
There was no illusions  
On the summer side of life  
Only tenderness  
  
And if you saw him now  
Youd wonder why he would cry  
The whole day long  
  
There was young girls everywhere  
On the summer side of life  
They talked all night  
  
To the young men that they knew  
On the summer side of life  
Goin off to fight  
  
And if you saw them now  
Youd wonder why they would cry  
The whole day long  
  
He came down through fields of green  
On the summer side of life  
He prayed all night  
  
Then he walked into a house  
Where love had been misplaced  
His chance to waste  
  
And if you saw him now  
Youd wonder why he would cry  
The whole day long  
  
And if you saw him now  
Youd wonder why  
And if you saw him now  
Youd wonder why  
And if you saw him now  
Youd wonder why
