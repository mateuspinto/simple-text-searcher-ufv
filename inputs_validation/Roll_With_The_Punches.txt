Johnny never knew what hit him  
When he first met Julia  
He used to be so wild and free  
Time treats everybody like a fool  
You gotta roll with the punches  
The sun is sinkin low  
You gotta roll with the punches  
Honey we aint never goin home  
Johnny had a 57 Chevy  
With fouronthefloor and a 429  
We used to take it out to Wild Horse Pike  
Run it out to the end of the line  
You gotta roll with the punches  
The sun is sinkin low  
You gotta roll with the punches  
Honey we aint never goin home
