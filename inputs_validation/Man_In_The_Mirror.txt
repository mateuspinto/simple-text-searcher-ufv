Im gonna make a change  
For once in my life  
Its gonna feel real good  
Gonna make a diference  
Gonna make it right  
  
As I turn up the collar on  
My favorite winter coat  
This wind is blowing my mind  
I see the kids in the streets  
With not enought to eat  
Who am I to be blind  
Pretending not to see their needs  
  
A summer disregard a broken bottle top  
And a one man soul  
They follow each other on the wind ya know  
Cause they got nowhere to go  
Thats why I want you to know  
  
Im starting with the man in the mirror  
Im asking him to change his ways  
And no message could have been any clearer  
If you wanna make the world a better place  
Take a look at yourself and then make a change  
Na na na na na na na na na nah
