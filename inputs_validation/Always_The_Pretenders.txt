Maybe we forced the deal delivered some kind of blow  
Maybe we broke the seal cracks began to show  
Maybe we crossed the line got everything off the ground  
Maybe we lit the fuse a habit hard to lose  
  
All I can remember all I can recall is you  
Telling me theres been an accident  
Always the pretenders always thought that love would do  
Every day I miss your innocence  
  
Maybe we ran the lights somehow we caused the scene  
Maybe we learned to fight as part of a routine  
Maybe we jumped the wall suddenly tipped the scale  
Maybe we tried too hard so afraid to fail  
  
All I can remember all I can recall is you  
Telling me theres been an accident  
Always the pretenders always thought that love would do  
Every day I miss your innocence  
  
Somethings lost for what its worth  
You and me this is our church  
There is still some love round here  
  
All I can remember all I can recall is you  
Telling me theres been an accident  
Always the pretenders always thought that love would do  
Every day I miss your innocence
