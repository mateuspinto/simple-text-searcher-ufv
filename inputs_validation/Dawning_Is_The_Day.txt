Rise let us see you  
Dawning is the day  
Miss misty meadow  
You will find your way  
Wake up in the morning to yourself  
And leave this crazy life behind you  
Listen were trying to find you  
Flow to the sea  
You know where to go  
But still we are free  
No one tells the wind which way to blow  
Wake up in the morning to yourself  
Open your eyes and start to be you  
Listen we think we can see you  
Baby theres no price upon your head  
Sing it shout it  
Now the angry words have all been said  
Do it dont doubt it  
So rise let us see you  
Dawning is the day  
Miss misty meadow  
You will find your way  
Wake up in the morning to yourself  
Open your head and look around you  
Listen we think we have found you  
Listen we think we have found you  
Listen we think we have found you  
Listen we think we have found you  
Listen we think we have found you  
Listen we think we have found you  
Listen we think we can see you
