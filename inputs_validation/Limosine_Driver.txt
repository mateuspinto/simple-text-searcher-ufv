Limousine driver  
Big cadillac car  
Rich and famous  
No matter who you are you are  
I seen a rock n roll rider  
I seen a cinema star  
  
Chorus  
Wont you roll down the road  
Roll down the road roll down the  
Roll down the road with me  
Want you to roll down the road  
Roll down the road roll down the  
Roll down the road with me  
  
Deep into the night  
Blue velvet push  
Cut glass crystal  
I mean it means so much  
Long cool fingeroos  
Soft tenderloin touch  
  
Chorus  
  
City sidewalk shining wet with rain  
Run through the run through one more again  
Run through the jungle  
Fetch a ladys glove  
Kicking off a bundle  
Go on and give it a shove  
Speak up dont mumble  
Who do you love
