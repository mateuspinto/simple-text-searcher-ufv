Thank you very much  
Weve got a request for a fast one  
We dont usually do rock and roll numbers  
But I dont know but about a verse of this one  
But Ill do it It goes like this  
  
Well I got a gal named bony moronie  
Well shes got a neck like a stick of macaroni  
You outta see her rock and rollin with her blue jeans on  
Makin love underneath the silvery moon  
  
I love her and she loves me  
And both as happy as we can be  
Makin love underneath the apple tree  
  
Well I got a gal named bony moronie  
Yeah Shes got a leg like a stick of macaroni  
You outta see her rock and rollin with her blue jeans on  
Makin love under the silvery moon  
  
I love her and she loves me  
Makin love underneath the apple tree  
  
Makin love underneath the apple tree  
Makin love underneath the apple tree  
Makin love underneath the apple tree
