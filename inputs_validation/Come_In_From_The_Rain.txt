I had troubles aplenty  
My pockets were empty  
From livin out on the sidewalk  
Footsteps takin me nowhere  
But where can you go when you dont know  
What it is youre lookin for  
Just as I was a desperate man  
You made the sun start to shine  
You saidbaby come in from the rain  
You could see down the stitches and patches  
That were holdin me together  
So with stolen faces hand in hand  
We made footsteps together for musicland  
Used to be I had troubles aplenty  
My pockets were empty yeah  
From the bad life on the back streets  
But when your footsteps are takin you nowhere  
Where can you go and what can you do  
When you dont know what youre lookin for  
Hey just as I reached the real world  
You made the sun start to shine  
You saidbaby come in out of the rain  
Oh yeah I said you made the sun start to shine  
Oh baby come in from the rain
