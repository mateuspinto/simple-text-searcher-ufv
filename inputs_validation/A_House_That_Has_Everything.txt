I can see you now living like a queen  
In a house that has everything everything but love  
Crystal chandeliers chauffeured limousines  
Yes youll really have everything everything but love  
I see diamonds sables sapphires and pearls  
And as the picture clears  
Poor little rich girl sitting all alone  
Counting her treasures in tears  
Better just a shack where two people care  
Than a house that has everything everything but love  
I see diamonds sables sapphires and pearls  
And as the picture clears  
Poor little rich girl sitting all alone  
Counting her treasures in tears  
Better just a shack where two people care  
Than a house that has everything everything but love  
Than a house that has everything everything but love
