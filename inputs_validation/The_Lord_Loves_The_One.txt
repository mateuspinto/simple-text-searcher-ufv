The lord loves the one that loves  
The lord  
And the law says if you dont give  
Then you dont get loving  
  
Now the lord helps those that help  
Themselves  
And the law says whatever you do  
Is going to come right back on you  
  
We all making out  
Like we own this whole world  
While the leaders of nations  
Theyre acting like big girls  
With no thoughts for their god  
Who provides us with all  
But when death comes to claim them  
Who will stand  
And who will fall  
  
The lord loves the one that loves  
The lord  
And the law says if you dont give  
Then you dont get loving  
  
Now the lord helps those that help  
Themselves  
And the law says whatever you do  
Is going to come right back on you  
  
We all move around  
With objectives in mind  
To become rich or famous  
With our reputations signed  
But the few that can reach  
To this coveted slot  
Dont escape old age creeping  
Through their bodies  
Like a rot  
  
While the lord loves the one that loves  
The lord  
And the law says if you dont give  
Then you dont get loving  
Now the lord helps those that help  
Themselves  
And the law says whatever you do  
Is going to come right back on you
