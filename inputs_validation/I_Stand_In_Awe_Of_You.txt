You are beautiful beyond description  
Too marvelous for words  
Too wonderful for comprehension  
Like nothing ever seen or heard  
Who can grasp you infinite wisdom  
Who can fathom the depth of your love  
You are beautiful beyond description  
Majesty enthroned above  
  
And I stand I stand in awe of you  
I stand I stand in awe of you  
Holy God to whom all praise is due  
I stand in awe of you
