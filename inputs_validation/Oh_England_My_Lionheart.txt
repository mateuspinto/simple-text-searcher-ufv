Oh England my Lionheart  
Im in your garden fading fast in your arms  
The soldiers soften the war is over  
The air raid shelters are blooming clover  
Flapping umbrellas fill the lanes  
My London Bridge in rain again  
  
Oh England my Lionheart  
Peter Pan steals the kids in Kensington Park  
You read me Shakespeare on the rolling Thames  
That old river poet that never ever ends  
Our thumping hearts hold the ravens in  
And keep the tower from tumbling  
  
Oh England my Lionheart  
Oh England my Lionheart  
Oh England my Lionheart  
I dont want to go  
  
Oh England my Lionheart  
Dropped from my black Spitfire to my funeral barge  
Give me one kiss in appleblossom  
Give me one wish and Id be wassailing  
In the orchard my English rose  
Or with my shepherd wholl bring me home  
  
Oh England my Lionheart  
Oh England my Lionheart  
Oh England my Lionheart  
I dont want to go  
Oh England my Lionheart  
Oh England my Lionheart  
Oh England my Lionheart  
I dont want to go
