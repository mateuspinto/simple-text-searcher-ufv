Oh in the morning  
Feel like the sun  
Coming up on daytime  
Shine on every one  
Coming up on darkness  
Warm me in your arms  
Let me know another lonely night  
Has come and gone  
  
Oh happy river flowing  
Gently unto me  
Softly bring me music  
Listen to you sing  
Swiftly running river flowing  
Well at last be free  
Oh happy waterwheel  
Roll gently over me  
  
Oh in the evening  
Feel alone at last  
All of the things that the daytime brings  
Roll gently in the past  
There is nothing left to see  
Except the stars and moon  
To let me know another lonely day  
Is coming soon  
  
Oh in the morning  
Feel like the sun  
Coming up on daytime  
Shine on everyone  
Coming up on darkness  
Warm me in your arms  
Let me know another lonely night  
Has come and gone
