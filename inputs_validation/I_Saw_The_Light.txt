I saw the light I saw the light  
No more darkness no more night  
Now Im so happy no sorrow in sight  
Praise the Lord I saw the light  
  
I wandered so aimless my heart filled with sin  
I wouldnt let my dear Savior in  
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night  
Praise the Lord I saw the light  
  
I saw the light I saw the light  
No more darkness no more night  
Now Im so happy no sorrow in sight  
Praise the Lord I saw the light  
  
Just like a blind man I wandered alone  
Worries and fears I claimed for my own  
Then like the blind man that God gave back his sight  
Praise the Lord I saw the light  
  
I saw the light I saw the light  
No more darkness no more night  
Now Im so happy no sorrow in sight  
Praise the Lord I saw the light  
  
I was a fool to wander and stray  
Straight is the gate and narrow the way  
Now I have traded the wrong for the right  
Praise the Lord I saw the light  
  
I saw the light I saw the light  
No more darkness no more night  
Now Im so happy no sorrow in sight  
Praise the Lord I saw the light
