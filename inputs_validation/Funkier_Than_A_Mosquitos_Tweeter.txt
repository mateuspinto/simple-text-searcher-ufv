Youre nothing but a dirty dirty old man  
You do your thinking with a one track mind  
Keep talkin about heaven glory but  
On your face is a different story  
Clean up your rap your storys getting dusty  
Wash out your mouth  
Your lies are getting rusty  
Cant believe nothing you say  
cause Im around and I see what you do  
You know youre funky as a mosquitos tweeter  
You gotta mouth like a herd of boll weevils  
Same old game same old thing  
You never changed  
Always rappin bout the same old thing  
  
I got something to tell ya  
I got something to tell you baby  
But you aint hip to baby  
Blowin minds is a thing of the past  
You blew your chance thats why you never last  
You want to be a graduate mother  
But in reality just another brother  
You think you slick but could  
Stand a lot of greasing  
The things you do aint never really pleasin  
Cant believe nothin you say  
Cause Im around and I see what you do  
You know you funky as a mosquitos tweeter  
You got a mouth like a herd of boll weevils  
Same old game same old thing  
Always rappin bout the same old thing  
You beautiful beautiful  
Beautiful beautiful  
  
Brought yourself a pot of baked stew  
Nothin worse than an educated fool  
Talkin sex is your favorite conversation  
But peace and love is a famous generation  
Whats in your head has really started  
Showing your conversation gettin kinda boring  
Cant believe nothin you say  
Cause Im around and I see what you do  
You know you funky as a mosquitos tweeter  
You got a mouth like a herd of boll weevils  
Same old game same old game  
Same old thing you never change  
Same old game same old thing  
Always rappin bout the same old thing
