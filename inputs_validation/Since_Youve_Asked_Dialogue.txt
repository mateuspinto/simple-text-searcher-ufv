What Ill give you since you asked is all my time together  
Take the rugged sunny days the warm and rocky weather  
Take the roads that I have walked along  
Looking for tomorrows time peace of mind  
  
As my life spills into yours changing with the hours  
Filling up the world with time turning time to flowers  
I can show you all the songs  
That I never sang to one man before  
  
We have seen a million stones lying by the water  
You have climbed the hills with me to the mountain shelter  
Taken off the days one by one  
Setting them to breathe in the sun  
  
Take the lilies and the lace from the days of childhood  
All the willow winding paths leading up and outward  
This is what I give  
This is what I ask you for nothing more
