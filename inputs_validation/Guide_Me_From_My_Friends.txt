Jah Jah guide me from my friends cause I know  
I know my enemies  
Everytime I know  
I know my enemies  
They will come and  
Sit round your table  
Wanting to kill you like  
Cain kill Abel  
Only trying to find an easy way  
That they can try to eliminate you  
Jah Jah guide me from my friends cause I know  
I know my enemies  
Everytime I know my enemies  
Anytime you see your friend there  
The first thing you see  
Is him teeth yes  
But if you could see the inner part  
Then we gonna know the sucker have got a wicked heart  
May Jah Jah guide me from my friends cause I know everyday  
I know my enemies  
Said I know my enemies  
Oh Jah Jah guide me from my friends cause I know  
I know my enemies  
Long time I been watching them I know  
I know my enemies  
Your enemies stay far from you  
And they dont  
They dont want to see you  
While your friends will come  
With a smiling face  
And it dont mean another shoes lace  
So Jah Jah guide me from my friends cause I know my enemies  
Everyday I know  
Oh my enemies  
Jah Jah guide me from my friends  
I know I know I know them I know them
