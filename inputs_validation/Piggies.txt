Piggy met baby in a disco bar  
Baby said what a cute little piggy you are  
When he took one look at her rocket tits  
He smiled real wide and said Baby youre it  
Piggy said baby wont you come with me  
My little place is three steps away  
Piggy gonna take us both to paradise  
He said Come on little baby wont you please be nice  
So Piggy and Baby sauntered into his crib  
Said here it is baby this is where I live  
Wont you take a load off can I fix you a drink  
Baby turned real slowly and said Piggy you stink  
Piggy said baby do you have a smoke  
Baby said no she was tryin to quit  
Piggy was speechless for a couple of beats  
When his jaw dropped open and he said shit  
Now Piggy and Baby had some swingin times  
And though piggy was stupid  
Baby sure didnt mind  
Baby said lets go straight to the stars  
And Piggy said  
huh  whatever  
Baby and Piggy took a walk in the park  
It seems that Piggy was in kind of a fix  
He owed seven bills to a couple of sharks  
Who were gettin kind of itchy in their fingertips  
So they figured it was best to clear out for a while  
Piggy had lots of friends or so he would boast  
And his little piggy habit was kind of out of control  
So they packed up his Lincoln and head for the coast  
Baby started smokin again on the way  
Piggys little habit was making him sweat  
So they stopped off in Vegas for a couple of days  
To scam some cash up and make a few bets  
They went and shacked up in a place on the strip  
Piggy made some calls and Baby got sick  
Baby turned to Piggy with a desperate plea  
cmon Piggy you know what we need  
But the problem you see was that they were broke as shit  
So Piggy asked Baby if shed turn a few tricks  
She argued at first but she finally agreed  
With a couple of shiners she hit the street  
Now Piggy felt good and piggy felt mean  
And Piggy was high on his self esteem  
So he pulled out his piece in front of a cop  
But the cop said Fuck you and Piggy got popped
