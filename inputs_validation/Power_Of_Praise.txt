What can move a man to dance  
When he doesnt hear a band  
What can move a broken heart to sing  
What can make a weary sinner  
Fall down on his knees  
What can make the halls of Heaven ring  
What can lift my lowest thoughts  
To the very throne of God  
And what can lift my eyes from earthly things  
  
Chorus  
Its the power of praise  
The power of praise  
When led by Gods spirit  
Its a mighty refrain  
It flows with a force  
That carries a current of change  
The power of praise  
  
Praise can give my soul a fire  
When my passions been consumed  
Praise can give my spirits song a voice  
Praise can fill my mind with peace  
When doubts have overcome  
Praise can fill my longing to rejoice  
Praise can turn my sorrow  
To a holy celebration  
Praise can turn my weeping  
Into tears of joy
