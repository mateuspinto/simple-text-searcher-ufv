Tears streaming down her heart is broken  
Because her life is hurting so am I  
He wears a frown his dreams are choking  
And because he stands alone his dreams will die  
  
So humbly I come to you and say  
As I sound aloud the warfare of today  
Hear me I pray  
  
What about the children  
To ignore is so easy  
So many innocent children  
Would choose the wrong way  
  
So what about the children  
Remember when we were children  
And if not for those who loved us  
And who cared enough to show us  
Where would we be today  
  
Sir where is your son Where lies his refuge  
And if he cant come to you then where can he run  
Such a foolish girl yet still shes your daughter  
And if you will just reminisce your days of young  
  
You see its not where youve been  
Nor what youve done because I know a friend  
Who specializes in great outcomes  
See his love overcomes  
  
And what about the children  
To ignore is so easy  
So many innocent children  
Would choose the wrong way  
  
Yes what about the children  
Remember when we were children  
And if not for those who loved us  
And who cared enough to show us  
Where would we be today  
  
What about the children  
Dont just turn and walk away  
What about the children  
They need our love and our help today  
  
Yes what about the children  
Remember when we were children  
And if not for those who loved us  
And who cared enough to show us  
Where would we be today  
  
Where would we be today  
Where would we be today  
What about the children
