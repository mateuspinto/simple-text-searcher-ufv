The morning came as memories faded with the night  
Another day began without you  
Each time I have this feeling  
I find myself believing  
You will soon come home to my arms  
Its not the case I told myself a million times  
The sweet embraces that we knew then  
Are written in the pages  
That first love story gave me  
Reason to be strong and carry on  
Everything is so different now  
Inside the freedom that love allows  
Ive got on reason to regret anymore  
Love is water for hearts to grow  
Though its over for us I know  
Ill always treasure what we learned as one and shared together  
Its nice to know I have a place to call my own  
Returning to my sweet sweet home  
Sometimes when romance comes its easy to believe  
That perfect love appears to take you ooh  
Till where your dreams had come true  
Theres just one happened with you  
Till we saw the light and let it go  
All I need is for you to know  
When you loved me you gave me hope  
Ill keep those memories inside of my heart  
If you see that you need a friend  
I will be there until the end  
Now I continue on like this until the future brings me  
Someone to fill the space I only have for now  
Its all Ive got my sweet sweet home  
Everything is so different now  
Inside the freedom that love allows  
Ive got no reason to regret anymore  
Love is water for hearts to grow  
Though its over for us I know  
Ill always treasure hat we learned as one and shared together  
Its nice to know I have a place to call my own  
Returning to my sweet sweet home 3X  
My sweet my sweet sweet home
