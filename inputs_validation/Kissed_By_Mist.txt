The forest seemed to swallow us  
Your hand was holding tight  
We walked together several miles  
And fading was the light  
So softly then I heard a voice  
You seemed to hear it too  
Then walked on resolutely like  
It wasnt meant for you  
  
But when it came again I stopped  
The voice among the trees  
Came flowing sweetly louder now  
In tones designed to please  
Again you pulled upon my arm  
You have to listen now  
And as you spoke a chill went through me  
Freezing me somehow  
  
The woodland folk and forest creatures living in this glade  
Have asked me to bring people here for this I am well payed  
The silent song will capture you enrapture you and then  
Youll grow roots and bark and leaves and Ill bring back more men  
  
But why I asked not quite aware of what was going on  
I saw your movements move urgently but words were drowned in song  
You are different though she said you have something to say  
It was a big mistake to take you here lets run away   
  
I tried to run but couldnt my head was bathed in sound  
And I looked down and saw my legs two feet beneath the ground  
My toes were roots my fingers twigs my skin was scaley bark  
And as into an oak I changed I watched you in the dark  
Completing your transaction with the nebulous green crowd  
Of tiny dancing forest people singing very loud  
  
A celebration for a tree and then I understood  
My initial feelings in this melancholy wood  
I know I felt the change in you when we finally kissed  
I looked but you were surrounded by a tapestry of mist  
  
I picture you as wind blows through our leaves and over land  
Every tree that stands with me for money changing hands
