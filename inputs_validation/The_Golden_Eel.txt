Sitting alone in the den watching the eel  
Help me find my way home watching the eel  
Burrows its head in the sand daylight has come  
There shall be rest in a while daylight has come  
  
I can not repeal the words of the golden eel  
  
Who can explain all these thoughts racking my mind  
An endless barrage of shit racking my mind  
The eel offered his help I cant understand  
Speaking its truth from the bank now I can see  
  
I can not repeal the words of the golden eel  
I can not repeal the words of the golden eel  
  
I can not repeal the words of the golden eel  
I can not reveal the words of the golden eel  
  
I can not repeal the words of the golden eel  
I can not reveal the words of the golden eel
