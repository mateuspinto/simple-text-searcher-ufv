I was a high steppin proud man one time king of the sidewalk fed all the
girls a line  
You came along and love laid a heavy hand on me  
High steppin proud man went down to his knees  
For a while I enjoyed just bein under your thumb  
But after a while the nerve of love grew numb  
Then I knew my heart was changing cryin out long and loud  
To once again become a man high steppin proud  
High steppin proud man down on my knees  
Beckon to your every wish and your every need  
Oh I know it wont be long before I break those vows  
And once again become a man high steppin proud  
 12str guitar   
Theres a lot of things in life Im glad I didnt miss  
And your good good love rates mighty high on the list  
But my restless spirit and a weddin band dont get along somehow  
Especially since I long to be high steppin proud  
High steppin proud man
