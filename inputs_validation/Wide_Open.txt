I used to stand in my doorstep  
I used to dance in the rain  
I used to cast out wishes  
That never came back again  
I used to sit in my garden  
With pretty maids in a row  
Silver bells and cockle shells  
Waiting to see where were goin  
  
Wide open for anything  
Anything love would bring  
Wide open for anything  
Anything and everything  
  
Same old scenery  
Made me real confused  
Tired of the same old feeling  
Of being lost and used  
I follow lonely footprints  
To see where they would lead  
Dreaming that they would take me  
Where I want to be  
  
Wide open for anything  
Anything love would bring  
Wide open for anything  
Anything and everything  
  
An air of confidence  
Is now in my stride  
I swing my shoulders gently  
My hips from side to side  
Now I live in the moment  
Where there are no regrets  
Now I keep my head up  
With nothing to forget  
  
Wide open for anything  
Anything love would bring  
Wide open for anything  
Anything and everything
