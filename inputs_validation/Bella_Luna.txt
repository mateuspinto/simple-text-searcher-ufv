Mystery the moon  
A hole in the sky  
A supernatural nightlight  
So full but often right  
A pair of eyes a closin one  
A chosen child of golden sun  
A marble dog that chases cars  
To farthest reaches of the beach and far beyond into the swimming sea of stars  
  
A cosmic fish they love to kiss  
Theyre giving birth to constellation  
No riffs and oh no reservation  
If they should fall you get a wish or dedication  
May I suggest you get the best  
For nothing less than you and I  
Lets take a chance as this romance is rising over before we lose the lighting  
Oh bella bella please  
Bella you beautiful luna  
Oh bella do you do  
Do do do do do  
  
You are an illuminated anchor  
Of leads to infinite number  
Crashing waves and breaking thunder  
Tiding the evenflows of hunger  
Youre dancing naked there for me  
You expose all memory  
You make the most of boundary  
Youre the ghost of royalty imposing love  
You are the queen and king combining everything  
Into twining like a ring around the finger of a girl  
Im just a singer youre the world  
All I can bring ya  
Is the language of a lover  
Bella luna my beautiful beautiful moon  
How you swoon me like no other  
  
May I suggest you get the best  
Of your wish may I insist  
That no contest for little you or smaller I  
A larger chance happened all them they lie  
On the rise on the brink of our lives  
Bella please  
Bella you beautiful luna  
Oh bella do you do  
Bella luna my beautiful beautiful moon  
How you swoon me like no other oh oh oh
