From wi push di club door  
Bombs away party like a holiday  
Jersey out but mi no play dis is not di NBA  
Mi mix weed wid Craven A  
Orange juice and Tanqueray  
A no foreign mi get it from  
No a so Jamaica stay  
Pon a sunny summer day  
Gal dash weh like apple J  
Dem sexy lingerie  
Show tatoos of all array  
Drawers nuh holy like di Pope  
We deh a di Vatican a pray  
Louie V and Donna Kay  
Dem gal yah change a brand a day  
  
Thats just di way we roll  
High grade wid Craven A we roll  
Not with John with Fay we roll  
Three bottles of Baba roots a day  
Baba roots a day  
Thats just di way we roll  
High grade wid Craven A we roll  
Not with John with Fay we roll  
Three bottles of Baba roots a day  
Dats how we roll  
  
How we roll pon di end crazy  
Like Spragga Benz  
Smokin with some other friends  
Meditation pon a realms  
Tune in like GSM Wayne pon Irie FM

Man we wid di line a spend  
Cause a family time a spend  
Guinness and weed after weed  
Like how after nine and ten  
Kall milk and china dem

Mek we get di party on  
And go inna di punch line again  
  
Thats just di way we roll

Not with John with Fay we roll  
Three bottles of Baba roots a day

Three bottles of Baba roots a day  
Dats how we roll  
  
Dancehall have mi charm  
Mi love it from mi born  
When everybody gone  
Me embedded in the lawn  
Mi and Roach and Corleon  
Get some girls and party on  
But di Police Jeep no gone  
So Cell Block dont beat no corn  
Keep yuh calm keep di piece  
Under yuh arm like roll on  
Be religious  
Like di Bible or di holy Koran  
Dancehall nice again  
Mek di flavour float on  
Cause di show must go on  
And so on  
  
Thats just di way we roll  
High grade wid Craven A we roll  
Not with John with Fay we roll  
Three bottles of Baba roots a day  
Baba roots a day  
Thats just di way we roll  
High grade wid Craven A we roll  
Not with John with Fay we roll  
Three bottles of Baba roots a day  
Dats how we roll
