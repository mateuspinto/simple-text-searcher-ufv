He called her on the road  
From a lonely cold hotel room  
Just to hear her say I love you one more time  
But when he heard the sound  
Of the kids laughing in the background  
He had to wipe away a tear from his eye  
A little voice came on the phone  
Said daddy when you coming home  
He said the first thing that came to his mind  
  
Chorus  
Im already there  
Take a look around  
Im the sunshine in your hair  
Im the shadow on the ground  
Im the whisper in the wind  
Im your imaginary friend  
And I know Im in your prayers  
Oh Im already there  
  
She got back on the phone  
Said I really miss you darling  
Dont worry about the kids theyll be alright  
Wish I was in your arms  
Lying right there beside you  
But I know that Ill be in your dreams tonight  
And Ill gently kiss your lips  
Touch you with my fingertips  
So turn out the light and close your eyes  
  
Chorus  
Im already there  
Dont make a sound  
Im the beat in your heart  
Im the moonlight shining down  
Im the whisper in the wind  
And Ill be there until the end  
Can you feel the love that we share  
Oh Im already there  
  
We may be a thousand miles apart  
But Ill be with you wherever you are  
  
Chorus  
Im already there  
Take a look around  
Im the sunshine in your hair  
Im the shadow on the ground  
Im the whisper in the wind  
And Ill be there until the end  
Can you feel the love that we share  
Oh Im already there  
Oh Im already  
There
