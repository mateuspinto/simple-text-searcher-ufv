See the moon roll across the stars  
See the seasons turn like a heart  
Your fathers days are lost to you  
This is your time here to do what you will do  
  
Your life is now your life is now your life is now  
In this undiscovered moment  
Lift your head up above the crowd  
We could shake this world  
If you would only show us how  
Your life is now  
  
Would you teach your children to tell the truth  
Would you take the high road if you could choose  
Do you believe youre a victim of a great compromise  
Cause I believe you could change your mind and change our lives  
  
Your life is now your life is now your life is now  
In this undiscovered moment  
Lift your head up above the crowd  
We could shake this world  
If you would only show us how  
Your life is now  
  
Would you teach your children to tell the truth  
This is your time here to do what you will do  
  
Your life is now your life is now your life is now  
In this undiscovered moment  
Lift your head up above the crowd  
We could shake this world  
If you would only show us how  
Your life is now  
  
Your life is now your life is now your life is now  
In this undiscovered moment  
Lift your head up above the crowd  
We could shake this world  
If you would only show us how  
Your life is now
