Colors of the sun  
Flashing on the water top  
Echo on the land  
  
Picking for a coin  
Many other tiny worlds  
Singing past my hand  
  
Awake to understand you are not dreaming  
It is not seaming just to be this way  
Dying men draw numbers in the air  
Dream to conquer little bits of time  
Scuffle with the crowd to get their share  
And fall behind their little bits of time  
  
Voices in the air  
Sympathetic harmony  
Coming from the trees  
  
Hanging at my door  
Many shiny surfaces  
Clinging in the breeze  
  
Oh leave me where I am I am not losing  
If I am choosing not to plan my life  
Disillusioned savior search the sky  
Wanting to just to show someone the way  
Asking all the people passing by  
Doesnt anybody want the way  
  
I say goodbye to Joseph and Maria  
They think I see another sky  
And from my fallen window I still see them  
Ill never free them from the sky
