While riding on a train goin west  
I fell asleep for to take my rest  
I dreamed a dream that made me sad  
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had  
  
With halfdamp eyes I stared to the room  
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon  
Where we together weathered many a storm  
Laughin and singin till the early hours of the morn  
  
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung  
Our words were told our songs were sung  
Where we longed for nothin and were quite satisfied  
Talkin and ajokin about the world outside  
  
With haunted hearts through the heat and cold  
We never thought we could ever get old  
We thought we could sit forever in fun  
But our chances really was a million to one  
  
As easy it was to tell black from white  
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right  
And our choices were few and the thought never hit  
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter and split  
  
How many a year has passed and gone  
And many a gamble has been lost and won  
And many a road taken by many a friend  
And each one Ive never seen again  
  
I wish I wish I wish in vain  
That we could sit simply in that room again  
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat  
Id give it all gladly if our lives could be like that
