I used to do it for the love a long time ago  
And all I ever wanted was love  
I used to love without fear a long time ago  
And all I ever wanted was love  
Then somebody came around and tried to hurt me  
Tried to make me feel like I was unworthy  
Took a pure love and tried to make it dirty  
Truth was they never did deserve me  
No  
  
I had to lose myself so I could love you better  
I had to lose myself had to lose myself so I could  
Love you better  
Had to lose myself had to lose myself  
So I could love you better  
Had to lose myself in love  
And thats just the way it is  
  
Couldnt tell me I was love when I needed it  
When all I ever wanted was love  
Should a told me just me because  
Im worth receiving it  
But all I ever wanted was love  
Theres is something awkward about the selflessness it  
Takes to  
Give love and the good that it makes you  
True love can never really forsake you  
But it took a little while just for me to see  
  
I had to lose myself so I could love you better  
I had to lose myself had to lose myself so I could  
Love you better  
Had to lose myself had to lose myself  
So I could love you better  
Had to lose myself in love  
And thats just the way it is  
  
I had a paralyzing fear of facing failure  
And I couldnt love you perfectly with fear in my head  
So I peerlessly had to face the danger  
So I could come back and love you whole instead  
All of your soul I said  
So I could make it better  
  
I had to lose myself so I could love you better  
I had to lose myself had to lose myself so I could  
Love you better  
Had to lose myself had to lose myself  
So I could love you better  
Had to lose myself in love  
And thats just the way it is  
  
beSec  
And so it goes that I never meant to hurt you  
Couldnt stay but I never meant to desert you  
Whole lot a things I just had to work through  
Time to heal and restore myself worth too  
Confrontation of my fears and anxiety  
Cried a whole lot years I suffered quietly  
And though it may have taken years I can finally  
Tell you that you were always on my mind  
  
I had to lose myself so I could make it better  
I had to lose myself had to lose myself so I could  
Make it better  
Had to lose myself had to lose myself  
So I could make it better  
Had to lose myself in love  
And that was just the way  
  
Takes strength to absorb all the abuse I did  
Great love to absorb all the misuse I did  
Hey baby its not an excuse I give  
And Id do it all again because for you I live  
  
Takes strength to absorb all the abuse I did  
Great love to absorb all the abuse I did  
Hey baby its not an excuse I give  
And Id do it all again because for you I live  
  
I had to lose myself so I could make it better  
I had to lose myself had to lose myself so I could  
Make it better  
Had to lose myself had to lose myself  
So I could make it better  
Had to lose myself in love  
And that was just the way  
And that was just the way it is
