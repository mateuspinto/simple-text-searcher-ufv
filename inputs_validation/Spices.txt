Odors in the evening mist  
Spices that you cant resist  
Curl around and resound  
Through caverns that the breeze has kissed  
  
Drawn inside you hear a tone  
As each foot hits a stepping stone  
The music soothes and calms your mood  
But suddenly youre not alone  
  
A single cloud within a storm  
Descends and leaves behind a form  
Someone that you knew appears in front of you  
A womans figure raincloudborn  
  
She blinks but doesnt see you yet  
She shivers and is soaking wet  
You cross the sand and take her hand  
A lifetime passed since last you met  
  
Centuries now fall away  
expand the years  Since yesterday  
When you were young and in the sun  
You let your woman slip away  
  
You take the hands that you have missed  
And kiss the lips you havent kissed  
For many years  
Taste the tears  
  
Spices that you cant resist
