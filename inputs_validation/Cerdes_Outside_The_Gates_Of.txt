Outside the gates of Cerdes sits the twopronged unicorn  
Who plays at relaxation time a rhinestone flugelhorn  
Whilst mermaids lace carnations into wreaths for ailing whales  
And Neptune dances hornpipes while Salome sheds her veils  
  
Phallus Phil tries peddling his pewter painted pot  
But Sousa Sam can only hear the screams of Peep the sot  
Who only sips his creme de menthe from terra cotta cups  
And exhales menthol scented breath whilst spewing verbiage up  
  
Down technical blind alleys live the wraiths of former dreams  
And Greeps who often crossed them are no longer what they seem  
And even Christian Scientists can but display marble plaques  
Which only retell legends whilst my eyes reach out for facts  
  
Yeah my eyes reach out for facts
