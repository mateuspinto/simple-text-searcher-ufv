Yeah Yo  
You were that foundation  
Never gonna be another one no  
I followed so taken  
So conditioned I could never let go  
Then sorrow then sickness  
Then the shock when you flip it on me  
So hollow so vicious  
So afraid I couldnt let myself see  
That I could never be held  
Back up no Ill hold myself  
Check the rep yep you know my rail  
Forget the rest let them know my hell  
Damn Im back yep my soul aint sell  
Kept respect up the vets stay their  
Let the rest be to tell they tale  
That I was there saying  
  
Chorus  
And these promises broken  
Deep feeble  
Each word gets lost in the echo  
So one last lie I can see through  
This time I finally let you  
Go go go  
  
Test my will test my heart  
Let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up  
Yall go hard I go smart  
Hows it working out for yall in the back huh  
Ive seen that frustration  
Big cross theyre lost but dont know  
And Ive come back unshaken  
Let down Ive lived and let go  
So you can let it be known  
I dont hold back I hold my own  
I cant be mad I cant be calm  
I cant sing flat it aint my tone  
I cant fall back I came too far  
Hold myself up and love my scars  
Let the bells ring wherever they are  
Cause I was there saying  
  
Chorus  
  
No you can tell em all now  
I dont back up I dont back down  
I dont fold up and I dont bow  
I dont roll over dont know how  
I dont care where the enemies are  
Cant be stopped all I know go hard  
Wont forget how I got this far  
And every time saying  
  
Chorus
