The keys to death and hell  
The ailing kingdom doomed to fail  
The bonds of sin and heart will break  
The pilgrims course will take  
  
Quelling the devils might  
And ready for eternal fight  
Aching limbs and fainting soul  
Holy battles take their toll  
  
Liberty and hope divine  
Changing the water into wine  
So to you we bid farewell  
Kingdom of heaven to hell  
  
Chorus  
Spirit holy life eternal  
Raise me up take me home  
Pilgrim sunrise pagan sunset  
Onward journey begun  
  
To courage find and gracious will  
Deliver good from ill  
Clean the water clean our guilt  
With us do what you will  
  
Then will my judge appear  
Bear no false angel that I hear  
For only then I will confess  
To my eternal hell  
  
Now give us our holy sign  
Changing the water into wine  
So to you we bid farewell  
Kingdom of heaven to hell  
  
Chorus  
  
Now give us our holy sign  
Changing the water into wine  
So to you we bid farewell  
Kingdom of heaven to hell  
  
Chorus
