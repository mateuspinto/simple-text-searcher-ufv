Give me just a little more time  
Maybe we will  
Find the words that will change our minds  
Oh give me just a little more time  
  
Give me just a little more time  
I dont want to  
Leave the weight in this place behind  
Oh give me just a little more time  
Give me just a little more time  
  
Ghosts white in the moonlight  
and the car breathes smoke in the middle of the night  
All tangled up in the telephone lines and dry eyes  
  
When you hold me close  
Pretend like you dont want to let me go  
And take the long way home  
Soft as the radio  
  
Give me just a little more time  
Maybe we will  
Find the words that will change our minds  
Oh give me just a little more time  
Give me just a little more time  
  
Give me just a little more time  
I dont want to  
Leave the weight in this place behind  
Oh give me just a little more time  
Give me just a little more time  
  
My god how scarred we are  
To feel so little in somebodys arms  
Smokestacks burnin up the boulevard  
And we break apart  
Its the easy part  
  
Kiss me once good night  
Your skin is glass in the dashboard lights  
And we make up our minds  
Two for the last time  
  
I have never been  
Never been somebody to hold on to  
I have never been  
Never been somebody to hold on to  
I have never been  
Never been somebody to hold on to  
I have never been  
Never been somebody to hold on to  
  
But if you give me more time  
Give me more time  
If you could give me more time  
Give me more time  
  
Cause I have never been  
Never been somebody to hold on to  
Give me more time  
I have never been  
Never been somebody to hold on to  
Give me more time  
  
I have never been  
Never been somebody to hold on to  
Give me more time
