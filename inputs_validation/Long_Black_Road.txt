They used to tell me boy you aint goin nowhere  
With your cheap guitar and your big long hair  
You gotta realize all your responsibilities  
You gotta get out to work and face reality  
  
You gotta get up in the morning take your heavy load  
And you gotta keep goin down the long black road  
  
So I drifted for a while down the road to ruin  
I couldnt find my way I didnt know what I was doin  
I saw a lot of people coming back the other way  
So I kept on goin when I heard them say  
  
You gotta get up in the morning take your heavy load  
And you gotta keep goin down the long black road  
  
I made a lot of money I was makin quite a mess  
But they all told me money wouldnt bring me happiness  
You gotta work like a man in a real mans life  
Youre gonna have to take all the trouble and strife  
  
You gotta get up in the morning take your heavy load  
And you gotta keep goin down the long black road
