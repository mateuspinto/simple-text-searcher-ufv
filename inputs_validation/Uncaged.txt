Gonna drift to the great wide open  
Gonna set my spirit free  
Wont stop till I reach the ocean  
Gonna break these chains holding me  
Uncaged  
  
Gonna swim in the coldest river  
Gonna drink from a mountain spring  
Deep in the land of the great wide open  
And let the water roll all over me  
Uncaged  
  
I wanna swim in the sunshine  
And everyday find a way to face my fears  
I wanna get in the wind  
  
Gonna take every chance Im given  
Feel the wind through the open plains  
Freedom is a gift get givin  
Go chase that sunset highway down  
You gotta get uncaged
