Take my picture off the wall  
It dont matter to me at all  
Said I was headed for a fall  
But you wanted me to crawl  
  
Give back my TV  
It dont mean that much to me  
While youre giving back my things  
Give me back the key to my heart  
  
Chorus  
Give back the key to my heart  
Give back the key to my heart  
And let my love flow like a river  
Straight into your heart dear  
  
Well you say I was the one  
To blame for the wrong thats been done  
Well you got a friend named cocaine  
And to me he is to blame  
  
He has drained life from your face  
He has taken my place  
While youre alone in San Antone  
Give me back the key to my heart  
  
Chorus
