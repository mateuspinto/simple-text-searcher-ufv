I remember yet before we met  
When every night and day  
I had to live the life of a lonely one  
And I remember meeting you  
Discovering love could be so true  
When shared by two stead of only one  
  
When you said you loved me  
We could not be parted  
Said I built my world around you  
And Im truly glad I found you  
  
Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever  
I never felt so good before  
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever  
Yes it has you know it has  
  
Each night I pray well never part  
Because the love within my heart  
Grows stronger from day to day  
Best I try hard I try  
To reassure and satisfy  
You know Id be lost if you went away  
  
Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever  
Yes it has I know it has  
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever  
  
Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever  
I never felt so good before  
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever  
Yes it has you know it has  
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever  
Dont you know my baby there  
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever
