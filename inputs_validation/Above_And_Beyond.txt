Woman in a million to me  
Ive never loved so much  
Is it any wonder Im alive  
No one ever knows what makes a  
Virtue or a vice  
Let it be the spell Im under  
These naked eyes  
Let it be the rain and thunder comes  
  
I go above and beyond the sun  
Some love never dies  
Story of our lives oh  
Swear by the stars above  
And late at night I pray to myself  
That you and I got everything we need  
Id give it all for you and me  
  
Love is the earth and the wind  
And the fire and the soul  
Love is above and beyond any eye to behold  
Love is the key and the cause  
And its makin us whole  
  
Made me a little crazy but I  
Soon realize my fate  
Every little touch Im paralized  
No one ever knows what makes  
An angel in disguise  
Let me be the one to taste you  
Those naked eyes  
No pity if the city ever crumbles down  
  
I go above and beyond the sun  
Some love never dies  
Story of our lives oh  
Swear by the stars above  
And late at night I pray to myself  
That you and I got everything we need  
Id give it all for you and me  
  
Love is the earth and the wind  
And the fire and we share  
Love is the force and the edge  
And its ready for those who dare  
Love is above and beyond  
And Im taking you there  
And baby Ill take you there  
  
I go above and beyond the sun  
Some love never dies  
Story of our lives ohh  
Swear by the stars above  
And late at night I pray to myself  
That you and I got everything we need  
Id give it all for you and me  
  
Love is the earth and the wind  
And the fire and the soul  
Love is the key and the cause  
And its making us whole  
Love is the force and the edge  
And its yours if you dare  
Love is above and beyond  
And Im taking you there  
Baby Ill take you there  
  
I go above and beyond the sun  
Some love never dies  
Story of our lives oh  
Swear by the stars above  
And late at night I pray to myself  
That you and I got everything we need  
Id give it all for you and me
