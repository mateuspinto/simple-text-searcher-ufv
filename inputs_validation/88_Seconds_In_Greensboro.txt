88 seconds  
Is all it takes  
88 seconds  
Dont make mistakes  
  
Weve seen you  
We can see you  
  
In red and blue  
In black and white  
Under crystal skies  
In full daylight  
  
You know it  
God you know it  
  
88seconds  
Is all it takes  
In 88 seconds  
We dont make mistakes  
  
We know you  
Oh yes we have known you  
  
Times are changing  
But not in our street  
Once we played there  
Like the good times  
  
You know it  
God you know it  
  
Theyre heading for  
A shallow grave  
With a big black cross  
By a tall white house  
To a place down south  
We wont forget  
To be stabbed in the back  
By a man they met  
  
In 88 seconds  
In greensboro  
88 seconds  
In greensboro  
  
88seconds  
In greensboro  
Is all we take
