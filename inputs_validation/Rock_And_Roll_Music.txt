Rock And Roll Music  
Chuck Berry  
Just let me hear some of that rocknroll music  
Any old way you choose it  
Its got a backbeat you cant lose it  
Any old time you use it  
Its gotta be rock  roll music  
If you want to dance with me  
If you want to dance with me  
I have no kick against modern jazz  
Unless they try to play it too darn fast  
And change the beauty of the melody  
Until it sounds just like a symphony  
Thats why I go for that rocknroll music  
Any old way you choose it  
Its got a backbeat you cant lose it  
Any old time you use it  
Its gotta be rock roll music  
If you want to dance with me  
If you want to dance with me  
I took my loved one over cross the tracks  
So she could her my man a whalin sax  
I must admit they have a rockin band  
Man they were goin like a hurricane  
Thats why I go for that rocknroll music  
Any old way you choose it  
Its got a backbeat you cant lose it  
Any old time you use it  
Its gotta be rock roll music  
If you want to dance with me  
If you want to dance with me  
Way down South they gave a jubilee  
Them country folks they had a jamboree  
Theyre drinkin home brew from a wooden cup  
The folks dancin got all shook up  
And started playin that rock n roll music  
Any old way you choose it  
Its got a backbeat you cant lose it  
Any old time you use it  
Its gotta be rock roll music  
If you want to dance with me  
If you want to dance with me  
Dont care to hear em play the tango  
Im in no mood to dig a mambo  
Its way too early for the Congo  
So keep a rockin that piano  
So I can hear some of that rock n roll music  
Any old way you choose it  
Its got a backbeat you cant lose it  
Any old time you use it  
Its gotta be rock roll music  
If you want to dance with me  
If you want to dance with me
