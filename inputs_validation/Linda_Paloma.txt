At the moment the music began  
And you heard the guitar player starting to sing  
You were filled with the beauty that ran  
Through what you were imagining  
  
Dreaming of scenes from those songs of love  
I was the endless sky  
And you were my Mexican dove  
  
Now the music that played in your ears  
Grows a little bit fainter each day  
And you find yourself looking through tears  
At the love you feel slipping away  
  
Though its not the kind  
Of love you might hope to find  
If tears could release the heart  
From the shadows preferred by the mind  
  
Like a wind that comes up in the night  
Caressing your face while you sleep  
Love will fill your eyes with the sight  
Of a world you cant hope to keep  
  
Dreaming on after that moments gone  
The light in your lovers eyes  
Disappears with the light of the dawn  
  
But the morning brings  
Strength to your restless wings  
And some other lover sings  
To the suns bright corona  
  
I know all about these things  
Linda Paloma  
Fly away  
Linda Paloma
