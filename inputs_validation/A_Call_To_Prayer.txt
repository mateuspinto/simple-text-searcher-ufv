Softly the evening vespers  
Hallow the closing day  
Sweetly the Savior whispers  
Come to the throne and pray  
  
Refrain  
Softly I hear Him calling  
Calling at close of day  
Sweetly His tones are falling  
Come to the throne and pray  
  
Come ere the shadows lengthen  
Bring Him thy burdened heart  
Come where His grace may strengthen  
Come from thy cares apart  
  
Smiles of His love await thee  
Lighting His lovely face  
Just to behold His beauty  
Dwell in the secret place  
  
Boldly we may approach Him  
Mercy and grace to own  
Tempted like us He bid us  
Come to the Fathers throne
