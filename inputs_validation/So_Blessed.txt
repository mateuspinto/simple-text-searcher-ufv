Lying beside you  
This joy is so deep  
I reach out and touch you  
Tenderly  
  
Looking inside you  
My world is complete  
I struggled to find you  
Now Im free  
  
Precious love  
Burning so deeply  
Shining completely  
For you  
  
Chorus  
So blessed  
Amazingly  
Touching you now  
Awakens me  
You are my heart  
My everything  
Feeling you now  
Is all I need  
  
Adrift in a moment  
So sacred and pure  
Alive for you only  
I am yours  
  
As you touch me so sweetly  
And you whisper my name  
I feel how you love me  
We are the same  
  
Precious one  
Dont ever leave me  
Forever need me  
This way  
  
Chorus  
  
Stay with me  
Beyond the end  
I treasure you  
You made me whole again  
  
Chorus
