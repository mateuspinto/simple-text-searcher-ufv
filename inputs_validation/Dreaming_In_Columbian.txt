Worlds apart separation from my mind  
Just close my eyes to bring me there  
I fall apart the pieces are so hard to find  
A puzzle piece is torn in half  
  
The absence of color surrounds a broken dream  
Call my eyes to take me there  
One by one I watch as the pieces disappear  
My friends become the ones I hate  
This house of cards it wont withstand the wind  
I shut my eyes to escape  
  
All my whites have turned to black  
Every time I close my eyes dream in Columbian  
All my bugs are comin back  
Crawlin on my face they speak in  
Columbian  
  
Worlds apart a separation from my soul  
Worlds apart the separation is now whole  
I watch the pieces fall apart  
I try to make a brand new start  
Im fallin in Im fallin out  
Im fallin up Im fallin back  
Im fallin down an fallin round an askin why
