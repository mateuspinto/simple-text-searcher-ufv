Nothing can be done against the truth  
No matter how we remain in denial  
Wasting time replacing time with each and every excuse  
But that will only work a little while  
Coping with despair  
Knowing youre not there  
Ashamed to just admit Ive been a fool  
So I blame it on the sun  
Run away from everyone  
Hoping to escape this ridicule  
Trapped in misery  
Wrapped so miserably  
And his deception I wear it like a skin  
  
Dying to maintain  
While I keep trying to explain  
A heart that never loved me to begin with  
Oh Im such a mess  
I have no choice but to confess  
That I have been desperately trying to belong  
Lying to myself and everybody else  
Refusing to admit my right was wrong  
  
And then he came Selah  
And it means praise and meditation  
And then he came Selah  
And it means did you think about that  
  
And then he came Selah  
And it means praise and meditation  
And then he came Selah  
And it means that you see  
  
How beautiful his fruits still in denial of its roots  
My guilty heart behaves so foolishly  
This treason from within that reasons with my sin  
Wont be happy till it sees the death of me  
Selfishly addicted to a life that I depicted  
Conflicted cause its not reality  
All thats left of me  
Oh I beg you desperately  
Cause me to agree for what I know is best for me  
Please save me from myself  
I need to save me from myself  
Please save me from myself  
Please save me from myself so I can hear you  
  
The choices that I make have been nothing but mistakes  
What a waste of useless space  
Should I die before I wake  
And all of my religion  
Ive fortified this prison  
Obligated to obey that the mans bad decision  
Please save me from myself  
I need you to save me from myself  
Please save me from myself  
Please save me from myself so I can hear you  
  
And then he came Selah  
And it means praise and meditation  
And then he came Selah  
And it means did you think about that  
And he came Selah  
And it means meditation  
And then he came Selah  
And it means that its you  
  
And then it came  
And then he came and he came and he came  
And then he  
And then he came
