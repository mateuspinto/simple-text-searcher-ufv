Theres a fog upon LA  
And my friends have lost their way  
Well be over soon they said  
Now theyve lost themselves instead  
  
Please dont be long  
Please dont you be very long  
Please dont be long  
For I may be asleep  
  
Now it only goes to show  
And I told them where to go  
Ask a policeman on the street  
Theres so many there to meet  
  
Please dont be long  
Please dont you be very long  
Please dont be long  
For I may be asleep  
  
Now its past my bed I know  
And Id really like to go  
Soon will be the breath of day  
Sitting here in Blue Jay Way  
  
Please dont be long  
Please dont you be very long  
Please dont be long  
For I may be asleep  
  
Please dont be long  
Please dont you be very long  
Please dont be long  
  
Please dont be long  
Please dont you be very long  
Please dont be long  
  
Please dont be long  
Please dont you be very long  
Please dont be long  
  
Dont be long dont be long dont be long  
Dont be long dont be long dont be long
