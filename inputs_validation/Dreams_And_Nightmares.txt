We pull up and we shoot then we park the car and at it  
Watch me pull up with no roof thats cause I walk the dog and pet it Im like

Shoot you in your head then just walk off like I didnt  
Let my money talk so much put my jawbone outta business

Riding round with the volume down with the windows up and the choppers down  
Soon as we get to yo block its the fucking other way around  
My bitch say Im too wild she dont even know why she stay around  
I get home and I dick her down now she talking bout exchange the vows  
If these bullets was paint balls I could fuck around and I could paint a house  
You could tell I pimpin the way I hit the blunt with my pinky out  
I bring Wine to Amy House we smoke it out and we drank it out and talk about
these pussy niggas that aint about what Wayne about  
Im hanging out a mussane without a brain is outta his mind  
I pull over I push a button it change like Optimus Prime  
Speaking of change its a shame how these lames dropping them dimes  
We aim at your grape knock it off now you just Vines  
Blood Gang red rain on these niggas hot if you dry  
My gang top of the line yelling out Squad Take it outside  
Imma tax player imma Axe player getting in through the back wayer Red

Fed up with the Fed shit and Fedex lost my package  
My white girls say Yeah nigga my white homies act blackish  
Aint tall enough for the NBA I aint big enough for the NFL
