The church bell rings  
An old drunk sings  
A young girl hocks her wedding ring  
Down on Rain Street  
  
Down the alley the icewagon flew  
Picked up a stiff that was turning blue  
The local kids were sniffin glue  
Not much else for a kid to do  
Down Rain Street  
  
Father McGreer buys an ice cold beer  
And a short for Father Loyola  
Father Joes got the clap again  
Hes drinking CocaCola  
Down on Rain Street  
  
Bless me Father I have sinned  
I got pissed and I got pinned  
And God cant help the shape Im in  
Down on Rain Street  
  
Theres a Tesco on the sacred ground  
Where I pulled her knickers down  
While Judas took his measly price  
And St Anthony gazed in awe at Christ  
Down on Rain Street  
  
I gave my love a goodnight kiss  
I tried to take a late night piss  
But the toiled moved so again I missed  
Down Rain Street  
  
I sat on the floor and watched TV  
Thanking Christ for the BBC  
A stupid fucking place to be  
Down Rain Street  
  
I took my Eileen by the hand  
Walk with me was her command  
I dreamt we were walking on the strand  
Down Rain Street  
  
That night Rain Street went on for miles  
That night on Rain Street somebody smiled
