I heard you sing a rebel song  
Sung it loud and all alone  
We cant afford the things you save  
We cant afford the warranty  
  
Well I see you walking in the glare  
Down the county road we share  
Our southern blood my heresy  
Damn that ol confederacy  
  
It took a  
Long time to  
Become the thing  
I am to you  
And you wont  
Tear it apart  
Without a fight  
Without a heart  
  
Im sorry for what youve learned  
learned  
When you feel the tables turn  
To run so hard in your race  
race  
Now you found who set the pace  
  
The landed aristocracy  
Exploiting all your enmity  
All your daddies fought in vain  
Leave you with the mark of Cain  
  
It took a  
Long time to  
Become the thing  
I am to you  
And you wont  
Tear it apart  
Without a fight  
Without a heart  
  
It took a  
Long time to  
Become you  
Become you  
  
The center holds so they say  
it never held too well for me  
It never held too well for me  
the center holds so they say  
I wont stop short for common ground  
that vilifies the trodden down  
That vilifies the trodden down  
i wont stop  
  
The center held the bonded slave  
For the sake of industry  
ah  
The center held the bloody hand  
Of the executioner man  
ah  
  
It took a  
Long time to  
Become the thing  
I am to you  
And you wont  
Tear it apart  
Without a fight  
Without a heart  
  
It took a  
Long time to  
Become you  
Become you  
  
It took a  
Long time to  
Become you  
Become you
