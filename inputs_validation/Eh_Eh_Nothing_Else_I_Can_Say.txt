Boy weve had a real good time and  
I wish you the best on your way eh  
I didnt mean to hurt you  
I never thought wed fall out of place eh eh  
  
I have something that I love longlong  
But my friends keep on telling me that somethings wrong  
Then I met someone  
And eh theres nothing else I can say  
  
Chorus  
Eh eh Theres nothing else I can say  
Eh eh I wish you never looked at me that way  
Eh eh Theres nothing else I can say  
Eh eh  
  
Not that I dont care about you  
Just that things got so complica eh eh  
I met somebody cute and funny  
Got each other and thats money eh eh  
  
I have something that I love longlong  
But my friends keep on telling me that somethings wrong  
Then I met someone  
And eh theres nothing else I can say  
  
Chorus

But my friends keep on telling me that somethings wrong  
Then I met someone  
And eh theres nothing else I can say
