Cloudy  
The sky is gray and white and cloudy  
Sometimes I think its hanging down on me  
And its a hitchhike a hundred miles  
Im a ragamuffin child  
Pointed fingerpainted smile  
I left my shadow waiting down the road for me a while  
  
Cloudy  
My thoughts are scattered and theyre cloudy  
They have no borders no boundaries  
They echo and they swell  
From Tolstoy to Tinker Bell  
Down from Berkeley to Carmel  
Got some pictures in my pocket and a lot of time to kill  
  
Hey sunshine  
I havent seen you in a long time  
Why dont you show your face and bend my mind  
These clouds stick to the sky  
Like floating questions why  
And they linger there to die  
They dont know where they are going and my friend neither do I  
  
Cloudy  
Cloudy
