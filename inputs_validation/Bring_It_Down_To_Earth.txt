Ultramagnetic mcs  
I remember the first time I ever seen ultramagnetic at Latin quarter  
  
Kool Keith  
Yeah  
Its time to come out and give the people something they can understand  
Something not too complicated cated  
You know what we goin do  
We goin bring it down to earth earth  
  
Chorus x4  
Bring it down to earth I dont understand  
  
Kool Keith  
Mega bomb ignite super reflection  
Power ignites the fourth horseman turbo  
I kick styles like data computer reading  
Miles away to beam star trek  
Moving my style up optimus level 4  
I get it warp speed youse on my space tour  
Get with the elements eloquent spacecraft  
Change my gamma flow onethreeeightseven  
Twentyohninesix cereal silver seven  
I got the skills to rap so what you want spock  
Style like captain kirk gamma ray one block  
Particle leading out rock the way intercourse  
Damaging animals a lady with menopause  
Rising at one speed altitude x be  
We need some gas or fuel yo come in major  
Im just a level or pinch Im hitting new york  
Flying with ced I see the other world  
I need some gas yo Jim I gotta come down  
Perimeters reading we might crash  
  
Chorus  
  
Kool Keith  
I know you out there and yall understand  
But Ima let Ced get on and tell yall what its really like  
Its not so complicated  
But connect with me and yall follow me right on through  
  
Ced Gee  
Yo  
Ultra power flowing get ready for centron  
React with the digital kicks like loose bombs  
High tech Cspects hit data brain checks  
Sounding like john  times up brain test
