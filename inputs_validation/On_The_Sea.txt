No fog clear in the moonlight  
The stars shine so bright nows the time  
I close my eyes  
Soft wind touch my face  
Cool sand upon the place where I once kissed you  
And held you close  
  
Now I will reach for the stars  
Because  
Oh my love thats where you are  
  
Though the storms of black night rage on  
I still see your face  
I still feel your lips on mine  
And though my heart feels all alone without you  
  
I still hear you sing to me  
I still hear your voice on the sea  
  
Waves crash break the silence  
Gulls cry their song of lament  
I walk on through the stormy night  
The air cries flash of anger  
  
Dark night enshrouds the stranger  
All alone  
Without you  
  
Now I will reach for the stars  
Because  
Oh my love thats where you are  
  
No fog clear in the moonlight  
The stars shine so bright nows the time  
I close my eyes  
Cool sand upon the place where I once kissed you  
And held you close  
  
Now I will reach for the stars  
Because  
Oh my love thats where you are
