Im as big as they come when Im over the phone Im as clean as they come
when Im fixing my zone on my own Clock my clone lock my home cool it I
dont pretend to be gentle because I fool it I tackle the Jekyll on his
mission to crack and I be squeezing his throat and Im beating him back We
gotta go for attack before he gets far blow up the death star and kill the
copycat Now to the next episode when we are back on the road and we are
racing time and we are cracking the code It aint the new players mode that
makes it worth while We walk the extra mile

I broke the fall and covered you all so whats that I make the call for
bouncing the ball you got that Mr Jekyll or Hyde well I gotta decide which
one Ill get you screaming like a bitch in case you want some Im seconds
behind behind my own pair of mind you see I gotta catch up if I want to be
found in me Holding my brain that looks like going insane I feel like Dorian
Grey and Im out of the frame  
  
  
  
Make a false move bitch I make you fall like Niagara Falls big and hairy
balls hear my calls break the dolls Mr Hyde breaking out from my fucked up
mentality read the news tomorrow another lyrical fatality Lurking in the
shadows I wait for my pray to come Striking from the darkness I invite you
all to get some Tall dark and handsome I hold your kids for ransom Psycho
motherfucker Ill be famous like the Hansons London after dark feel me
breathing down your neck sending chills down your spine hear my microphone
check one time two time three times Here it comes Your life is nothing now
dust you off like bread crumbs
