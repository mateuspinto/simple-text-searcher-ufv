In Your Name  
Words and music by Ray Boltz  
In Your name we come into your presence  
In Your name we breathe and live  
In Your name we find salvation  
That you so freely give  
Chorus  
If we love a little more in Your name  
And we care a little more in Your name  
And we share a little more in Your name  
Then this world is gonna be changed  
In Your name weve heard the message  
In Your name weve heard the call  
In Your name as those before us  
We rise up to give you all  
Chorus repeat 2x  
In Your name in Your name in Your name  
I know this world is gonna be changed
