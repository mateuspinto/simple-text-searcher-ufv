Shelly I do  
When I first saw shelly  
I swear I almost cry  
I felt as though wed been together  
For all of our lives  
Shouldering my worst afflictions  
And reminiscing times we never had  
She said that she remembered me  
From some strange dream shed had  
She cut me to the quick  
And I just feel about and laughed  
I said  
When I hold you  shelly  
I just pray that you and me  
Will never end  
And I do  you know  
I love you you know  
Shelly I do  
When I first saw shelly  
I swear I almost cry  
I felt as though wed been together  
For all of our lives  
And I do  you know  
I love you you know  
Shelly I do  
When I hold you  shelly  
I just pray that you and me  
Will never end
