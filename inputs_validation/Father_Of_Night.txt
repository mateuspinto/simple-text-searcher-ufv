Father of night Father of day  
Father who taketh the darkness away  
Father who teacheth the bird to fly  
Builder of rainbows up in the sky  
Father of loneliness and pain  
Father of love and Father of rain  
  
Father of day Father of night  
Father of black Father of white  
Father who build the mountain so high  
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky  
Father of time Father of dreams  
Father who turneth the rivers and streams  
  
Father of grain Father of wheat  
Father of cold and Father of heat  
Father of air and Father of trees  
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories  
Father of minutes Father of days  
Father of whom we most solemnly praise
