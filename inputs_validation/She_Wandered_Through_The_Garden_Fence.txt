She wandered through the garden fence  
And said Ive brought at great expense  
A potion guaranteed to bring  
Relief from all your suffering  
And though I said You dont exist  
She grasped me firmly by the wrist  
And threw me down upon my back  
And strapped me to her torture rack  
  
And without further argument  
I found my mind was also bent  
Upon a course so devious  
It only made my torment worse  
  
She said I see you cannot speak  
Is it your voice that is too weak  
Is it your tongue that is to blame  
Maybe you cannot speak for shame  
Or has your brain been idle too  
And now it will not think for you  
I hastened to make my reply  
But found that I could only lie  
  
And like a fool I believed myself  
And thought I was somebody else  
But she could see what I was then  
And left me on my own again
