Hold me hold me  
Never let me go  
Until youve told me told me  
What I want to know  
And just hold me hold me  
Make me tell you Im in love with you  
Hold me tight never let me go  
Thrill me thrill me  
Walk me down the lane where shadows will be will be  
Hiding lovers just the same as well be well be  
When you make me tell you I love you  
Will you take me in your arms  
They told me Be sensible with your new love  
Dont be fooled thinking this is the last youll find  
But they never stood in the dark with you love  
When you take me in your arms  
and drive me slowly out of my mind  
Kiss me kiss me and when you do  
I know that you will miss me miss me  
If we ever say adieu so kiss me kiss me  
Make me tell you Im in love with you
