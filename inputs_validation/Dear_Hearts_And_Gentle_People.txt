I love the dear heart and gentle people  
Who live in my home town  
Because the dear heart and gentle people will never ever let you down  
They read the good book from Friday till Monday  
Thats how the weekends go  
I have a dream house Ill build there someday  
With picket fence and rambling rose  
Bridge  
I feel so welcome each time that I return  
My heart swells up just like a cloud  
I love the dear heart and gentle people who live and love in
