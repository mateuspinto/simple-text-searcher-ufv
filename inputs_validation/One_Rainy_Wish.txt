Golden rose the color of the dream I had  
Not too long ago  
A misty blue and the lilac too  
A never to grow old  
  
A there you were under the tree of song  
Sleeping so peacefully  
In your hand a flower played  
A waiting there for me  
  
I have never  
Laid eyes on you  
Not like a before  
This timeless day  
A but you woke and ya ha  
Oh ya smiled my name  
And you stole  
My heart away  
A stole my heart away little girl yeah  
All right   
  
Golden rose the color of the dream I had  
Not too long ago  
Misty blue and lilac too  
A never to grow old  
  
Golden rose the color of the dream I had  
Misty blue and lilac too  
Golden rose the color of the dream I had  
Misty blue and lilac too  
Gold and rose gold are rose gold and rose  
  
Its only a dream  
Id love to tell somebody about this dream  
The sky was filled with a thousand stars  
While the sun kissed the mountains blue  
And eleven moons played across rainbows  
Above me and you  
Gold and rose the color of the velvet walls surround us
