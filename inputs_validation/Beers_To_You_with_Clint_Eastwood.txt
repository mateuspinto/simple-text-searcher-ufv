Ray When Uncle Sam called us up  
We hit that Eastern Sand  
Fought like Hell for three long years  
In that South Asian Land  
Clint We met a few foreign ladies  
Drank a lot of Lukewarm beer  
Ray spoken oh I remember  
But tonight in this old Tuscan bar  
Ray You know what Its so damn good to see you here  
Chorus  
Both Beers to you old Amigo For all the good times  
And heres to all the women that weve been through  
Lets set Em up my compadre  
Ray Barstool to barstool  
Clint Shoulder to shoulder  
All right Beers to you  
Clint Ray you remember back in Phoenix  
When we walked into that fight  
Ray Uh huh  
Clint we whipped them local boys aww did we  
Then we bought em drinks all night  
Ray And when my lovin wife left for points unknown  
You were there to fill my glass  
And it proved to me A womans love can fade  
With the taste of Coors  
And good friends always last  
Chorus  
Both Beers to you old Amigo For all the good times  
And heres to all the women that weve been through  
Lets set Em up my compadre  
Ray Barstool to barstool  
Clint Shoulder to shoulder  
All right Beers to you  
Clint Hey Ray lets have one more  
Ray Alright Clint its my turn to buy  
Clint In that case lets have two  
Ray I just remembered I got a date two barstools down  
Clint You mean that little Redhead  
Ray Mmhmm  
Chorus  
Both Beers to you old Amigo For all the good times  
And heres to all the women that weve been through  
Lets set Em up my compadre  
Ray Barstool to barstool  
Clint Shoulder to shoulder  
All right Beers to you
