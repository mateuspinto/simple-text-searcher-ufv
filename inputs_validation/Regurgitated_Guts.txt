Suicidal preacher hangs himself  
Unfaithful servant goes straight to hell  
When he returns your life will end  
Down from the skies maggots descend  
Least expecting his horrible face  
Your decayed guts you soon will taste  
Unholy feeling grows deep inside  
Choking on your guts you open wide  
  
Regurgutated guts  
Satisfy his needs  
Regurgutated guts  
Now youre gonna bleed  
  
Visions of death are growing clear  
Life as a corpse is what you fear  
Searching through the graves to be set free  
From the curse of the priest thats come to be  
So unaware of whats to come  
Your guts are his when he is done  
Reaching for your cross to end this pain  
Your life and blood he will have drained  
  
Regurgutated guts  
Satisfy his needs  
Regurgutated guts  
Now youre gonna bleed  
  
In his trance  
Your eyes they bleed  
Your guts come forth  
For his own need
