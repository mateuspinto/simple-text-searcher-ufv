Across the wet November night  
The church is bright with candlelight  
And waiting Evensong 2x  
A single bell with plaintive strokes  
Pleads louder than the stirring oaks  
The leafless lanes along 2x  
  
It calls the choirboys from their tea  
And villagers the two or three  
Damp down the kitchen fire 2x  
Let out the cat and up the lane  
Go paddling through the gentle rain  
Of misty Oxfordshire 2x  
  
On country morning sharp and clear  
The penitent in faith draw near  
And kneeling here below 2x  
Partake the heavenly banquet spread  
Of sacramental Wine and Bread  
And Jesus presence know 2x  
  
And must that plaintive bell in vain  
Plead loud along the dripping lane  
And must the building fall 2x  
Not while we love the church and live  
And of our charity will give  
Our much our more our all 2x
