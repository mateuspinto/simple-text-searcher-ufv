Why do I kid myself  
Why do I scream for pleasure  
Its four in the morning should know better  
But she can weave a spell  
Want it to last forever  
Making me feel like somebody special  
  
Cant carry on this way just go to sleep  
Before it gets too late just go to sleep  
Doing damage to my brain  
Well here we go again  
  
Though I look everywhere  
I never seem to find it  
Always a shadow around a corner  
Drown it in alcohol  
Stuck in the elevator  
Hard to remember in the morning  
  
Cant carry on this way just go to sleep  
Before it gets too late just go to sleep  
Doing damage to my brain  
Well here we go again  
  
Tell you about myself  
If youre in the mood to listen  
Baby you dont know who youre kissing  
This is a lonely world  
You are a strange companion  
When you get what you wanted  
You want to leave  
  
Honestly I want to free myself  
From the burden of inaction  
Honestly I want to raise myself  
To any plane I can imagine  
  
Cant carry on this way just go to sleep  
Before it gets too late just go to sleep  
Doing damage to my brain  
Well here we go again
