Is my living in vain  
Is my giving in vain  
Is my singing in vain  
Is my praying in vain  
  
No of course not  
  
Its not all in vain  
Because up the road is eternal gain  
  
Am I wasting my time  
Can the clock be rewind  
Have I let my light shine  
Have I made ninety nine  
  
No of course not  
No of course not  
No of course not  
No of course not  
  
Its not all in vain  
Because up the road is eternal gain  
  
No of course not  
No of course not  
No of course not  
No of course not  
  
Its not all in vain  
Because up the road is eternal gain
