In troubled times  
Its hard to get straight answers  
Between the lines  
That border wrong or right  
The homeland cries  
It struggles with confusion  
But this feelin still remains  
Like shelter from the rain  
  
We live of faith  
In the hands of those who guide us  
And tear the page  
On the fear we left behind  
We set the pace  
For every born survivor  
Dont turn the other way  
When I need to hear you say  
  
Allies with our backs against the wall  
I will answer when you call  
And take on the odds  
For what we believe is true  
Allies in a world of too much choice  
I only need your voice  
To tell me you care  
Ill be anywhere for you allies  
  
We search our hearts  
To justify the reason  
And draw the line  
To meet somewhere halfway  
If faith is blind  
Through darkness it will guide us  
Cause the spirit still remains  
With the keepers of the flame  
  
Allies with our backs against the wall  
I will answer when you call  
And take on the odds  
For what we believe is true  
Allies in a world of too much choice  
I only need your voice  
To tell me you care  
Ill be anywhere for you allies  
  
Allies with our backs against the wall  
I will answer when you call  
And take on the odds  
For what we believe is true  
Allies in a world of too much choice  
I only need your voice  
To tell me you care  
Ill be anywhere for you allies
