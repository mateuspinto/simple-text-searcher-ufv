Im waiting for the night to fall  
I know that it will save us all  
When everythings dark  
Keeps us from the stark reality  
Im waiting for the night to fall  
When everything is bearable  
And there in the still  
All that you feel is tranquillity  
There is a star in the sky  
Guiding my way with its light  
And in the glow of the moon  
Know my deliverance will come soon  
Im waiting for the night to fall  
I know that it will save us all  
When everythings dark  
Keeps us from the stark reality  
Im waiting for the night to fall  
When everything is bearable  
And there in the still  
All that you feel is tranquillity  
There is a sound in the calm  
Someone is coming to harm  
I press my hands to my ears  
Its easier here just to forget fear  
And when I squinted  
The world seemed rosetinted  
And angels appeared to descend  
To my surprise  
With halfclosed eyes  
Things looked even better  
Than when they were open  
Been waiting for the night to fall  
I knew that it would save us all  
Now everythings dark  
Keeps us from the stark reality  
Been waiting for the night to fall  
Now everything is bearable  
And here in the still  
All that you feel is tranquility
