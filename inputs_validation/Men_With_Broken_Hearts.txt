Youll meet many just like me upon lifes busy street  
With shoulders stooped and heads bowed low and eyes that stare in defeat  
For souls that live within the past where sorrow plays all parts  
For a living death is all thats left for men with brokens hearts  
You have no right to be the judge to criticize and condemn  
Just think but for the grace of God it would be you instead of him  
One careless step a thoughtless deed and then the misery starts  
And to those who weep death comes cheap these men with broken hearts  
  
Humble you should be when they come passing by  
For its written that the greatest of men never get to big to cry  
Some lose faith in love and life when sorrow shoots her darts  
With hope all gone they walk alone these men with broken hearts  
Youve never walked in that mans shoes or saw things through his eyes  
Or stood and watched with helpless hands while the heart inside you dies  
  
Some were paupers some were kings some were masters of the arts  
But in their shame theyre all the same these men with broken hearts  
Life sometimes can be so cruel that a heart will pray for death  
God why must these living dead know pain with every breath  
So help your brother along the road no matter where he starts  
For the God that made you made them too These men with broken hearts
