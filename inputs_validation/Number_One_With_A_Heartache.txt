Twinkle twinkle super star fame and fortune took you far  
Everybody envies you youre number one  
Night and day your records play but ever since she went away  
Life aint no fun  
The songs you write about her keep coming back without her  
The king of the charts is the king of broken hearts  
  
Chorus  
Number one with a heart ache  
Hear the man singing on the radio  
With every play his heart is breaking  
Number one with a heart ache  
Sing your song while the whole world sings along  
Your love is gone but the music goes on  
  
Gee it was a long hard climb and it took a lot of time  
Time away from her when you shouldve been there  
Birthdays on the telephone Christmases she spent alone  
I wasnt fair  
It took so long to make it the girl just couldnt take it  
Now that its made was it worth the price you paid  
  
Number one with a heart ache  
Hear the man singing on the radio  
With every play his heart is breaking  
Number one with a heart ache  
Sing your song while the whole world sings along  
Your love is gone but the music goes on  
  
Number one with a heart ache  
Hear the man singing on the radio  
With every play his heart is breaking  
Number one with a heart ache  
Sing your song while the whole world sings along  
Your love is gone but the music goes on
