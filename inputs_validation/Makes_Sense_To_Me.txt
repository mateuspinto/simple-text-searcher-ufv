I was talking to a homeless drunk about religion  
He said Its all I got but it aint much  
Cause the way I feel these days  
Id rather have a gun than a crutch  
  
Well that makes sense to me  
It makes sense to me I must confess  
That makes sense to me  
It makes sense to me I must confess  
  
Listen to a little girl she was a runaway  
She said My daddy treated me like a slave  
Soiled me in my momma bed when I was just 15  
Thats why I had to lay him in his grave  
  
Well that makes sense to me  
It makes sense to me I must confess  
That makes sense to me  
It makes sense to me I must confess  
  
Talking to a black man from Atlanta  
He said The time has come to take whats mine  
And if I must bust a few heads to achieve justice  
My righteous cause will well explain the crime  
  
Well that makes sense to me  
It makes sense to me I must confess  
That makes sense to me  
It makes sense to me I must confess  
  
Well that makes sense to me  
It makes sense to me I must confess  
That makes sense to me  
It makes sense to me I must confess
