Hear the pounding army of the night  
The call of metal summons us tonight  
And gather we on this site  
To behold the power and the might  
We wear leather we wear spikes we rule the night  
  
Off with the lights hear the screams  
See the banging heads awaken to their dreams  
The sound of metal so loud it cracks the beams  
Played by warriors called the Metal Kings  
  
A heros welcome for those who heed the call  
We are together we are all  
With hands high fists fill the air  
Against the world we stand  
Hands high forever well be there  
Gloves of Metal rule tonight Yea  
  
A heros welcome for those who heed the call  
We are together we are all  
With hands high fists fill the air  
Against the world we stand  
Hands high forever well be there  
Gloves of Metal rule tonight  
  
Leather Metal Spikes and Chains  
Gloves of Metal raised to show the brave  
Into the darkness march the armies of the night  
Bound by metal we live the fight  
We wear leather we wear spikes we rule the night  
With hands high fists fill the air  
Against the world we stand  
With hands high forever well be there  
Gloves of Metal rule tonight
