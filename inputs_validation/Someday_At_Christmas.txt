Someday at Christmas men wont be boys  
Playing with bombs like kids play with toys  
One warm December our hearts will see  
A world where men are free  
  
Someday at Christmas therell be no wars  
When we have learned what Christmas is for  
When we have found what lifes really worth  
Therell be peace on earth  
  
Someday all our dreams will come to be  
Someday in a world where men are free  
Maybe not in time for you and me  
But someday at Christmas time  
  
Someday at Christmas well see a land  
No hungry children and no empty hand  
One happy morning people will share  
Our world where people care  
  
Someday at Christmas therell be no tears  
All men are equal and no men have fears  
One shining moment my heart ran away  
From our world today  
  
Someday all our dreams will come to be  
Someday in a world where men are free  
Maybe not in time for you and me  
But someday at Christmas time  
  
Someday at Christmas man will not fail  
Take hope because your love will prevail  
Someday a new world that we can start  
With hope in every heart  
  
Someday all our dreams will come to be  
Someday in a world where men are free  
Maybe not in time for you and me  
But someday at Christmas time  
Someday at Christmas time
