Sun go east sun go west  
Sun go east sun go west  
  
You used to say love and be loved all the time  
Til you discovered feelings were a failure sign  
When it rains it rains so hard  
The tears begin to show  
Now its raining in my heart  
I want the world to know  
  
Life will never be the same as it was again  
Life will never be the same as it was again  
Through my anger and my joy my tears and pain  
Life will never be the same as it was again  
  
Beneath the sea of Hollywood where Frances used to reign  
They trade their deepest wishes for a part in someones game  
Spirits die alone at night  
For life they cannot hold  
I would rather dance with you  
Than have a medal to show  
  
Life will never be the same as it was again  
Life will never be the same as it was again  
Through my anger and my joy my tears and pain  
Life will never be the same as it was again  
  
Sun go east sun go west  
Will I wear a medal again  
Sun go east sun go west  
We can dance and bring on the rain  
  
Now I say love for love not a space in time  
The strangest things can shatter kings and take away whats mine  
When its raining in my heart  
I want the world to know  
I would rather dance with you  
Than have a medal to show  
  
Life will never be the same as it was again  
Life will never be the same as it was again  
Through my anger and my joy my tears and pain  
Life will never be the same as it was again  
  
We are just everyday people not a theatre company  
Everyone wants to join us theres no fear in us you see  
Its me for you and you for me  
  
Sun go east sun go west  
Will I wear a medal again  
Sun go east sun go west  
We can dance and bring on the rain
