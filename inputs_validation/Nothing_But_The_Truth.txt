It seems as clear as yesterday  
We saw it in a dream  
But dream became insanity  
An awful gaping scream  
  
So sad to see such emptiness  
So sad to see such tears  
And heaped up leaves of bitterness  
Turned mouldy down the years  
  
Nothing but the truth  
Common words in use  
Hard to find excuse  
Harder than the truth  
  
Like Icarus we flew too high  
We flew too near the sun  
They caught us in that awful glare  
Our hapless throats were strung  
But just before the final stroke  
They took us victims of the rope  
And cast us far beyond the deep  
To lie in never ending sleep  
  
It seems as clear as yesterday  
They cast us in the deep  
We lie in darkest night for good  
Never ending sleep  
  
A never ending bitter gloom  
Whose darkness seldom clears  
A God forsaken emptiness  
Which fills our hearts with tears
