Should I have a taste of this  
Start and crush your nails  
And start all over again  
Could this all just be a dream  
If I should fall to stormy weather  
Wake Me Wake Me  
yeah  
Maybe this time I can do it all wrong  
Without my foot in my mouth  
Without that blind in my sight  
Could this all just be a dream  
If i should fall to stormy weather  
Wake Me Wake Me  
yeah  
2x  
oh oh  
Too scared to lose the one  
I tried so hard for  
Too scared to lose the one  
I never had  
2x
