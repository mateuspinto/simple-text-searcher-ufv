Perhaps love is like a resting place  
A shelter from the storm  
It exists to give you comfort  
It is there to keep you warm  
And in those times of trouble  
When you are most alone  
The memory of love will bring you home  
  
Perhaps love is like a window  
Perhaps an open door  
It invites you to come closer  
It wants to show you more  
And even if you lose yourself  
And dont know what to do  
The memory of love will see you through  
  
Oh love to some is like a cloud  
To some as strong as steel  
For some a way of living  
For some a way to feel  
And some say love is holding on  
And some say letting go  
And some say love is everything  
And some say they dont know  
  
Perhaps love is like the ocean  
Full of conflict full of pain  
Like a fire when its cold outside  
Or thunder when it rains  
If I should live forever  
And all my dreams come true  
My memories of love will be of you
