Here is a story about a sinner  
He used to be a winner who enjoyed a life of prominence and position  
But the pressures at the office and his socialite engagements  
And his selfish wifes fanatical ambition  
It turned him to the booze  
And he got mixed up with a floosie  
And she led him to a life of indecision  
The floosie made him spend his dole  
She left him lying on Skid Row  
A drunken lag in some Salvation Army Mission  
Its such a shame  
  
Oh demon alcohol  
Sad memories I cannot recall  
Who thought I would say  
Damn it all and blow it all  
Oh demon alcohol  
Memories I cannot recall  
Who thought I would fall a slave to demon alcohol  
  
Barley wine pink gin  
Hell drink anything  
Port Pernod or tequila  
Rum scotch vodka on the rocks  
As long as all his troubles disappeared  
But he messed up his life and he beat up his wife  
And the floosies gone and found another sucker  
Shes gonna turn him on to drink  
Shes gonna lead him to the brink  
And when his moneys gone  
Shell leave him in the gutter  
Its such a shame  
  
Oh demon alcohol  
Sad memories I cannot recall  
Who thought I would fall  
A slave to demon alcohol
