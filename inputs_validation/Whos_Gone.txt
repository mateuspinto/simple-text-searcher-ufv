Robo who Robo gone Robo what Robo one  
Robo where Robo never Robo why Robo clever  
Robo hi Robo ho in the sky Robo no  
  
Robo who Robo gone Robo what Robo one  
Robo where Robo never Robo why Robo clever  
Robo hi Robo ho in the sky Robo no  
  
Waiting for the Robo  
Im a universal hobo  
Im a skinny little creature  
Will he turn into a feature  
Only visiting the planet  
That Im pushing to a circle  
Only Robo makes me rub it all   
The walls where it begun   
  
Visiting your planet  
For a few thousand days  
Nothing to hide  
No reason to stay  
Breathless at the end of my run  
It all ends where it begun

Whatever makes me run  
Has anybody ever seen the end  
Here is where it begun  
  
Visiting your planet  
For a few thousand days  
Nothing to hide  
No reason to stay  
Breathless at the end of my run  
It all ends where it begun
