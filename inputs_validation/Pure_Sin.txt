I can barely see your sneakers  
You say I got to keep my head down  
Youre painting my portrait  
In a red velvet gown  
  
How do you see me  
As demure and discreet  
But do you know what Ill do  
Do you know what Ill do  
When I go out on the street  
  
Pure sin pure sin  
The kind you wont mind  
The kind there could be trouble in  
  
I can barely see your sneakers  
You know they look pretty rough  
Well I bet when you get loaded  
You can get pretty tough  
  
You pass me the caviar  
Say Hey baby do you want something to eat  
But do you know what Ill do  
Do you know what Ill do  
When I go out on the street  
  
Pure sin pure sin  
The kind you wont mind  
The kind there could be trouble in  
  
I can barely see your sneakers  
Youre dripping paint all over the place  
Why not get right to the point  
And splash it right on my face  
  
How do you see me  
As silly and sweet  
But do you know what Ill do  
When I go out on the street  
  
Pure sin pure sin  
The kind you wont mind  
The kind there could be trouble in
