Nothing is for certain  
Thats what the showman said  
First you must open the curtain  
And stand em on their heads  
There can be no inhibitions  
No prima donna ways  
If you want to pass the audition  
And times is tough these days  
Remember when Mr Barnum  
Presented Jenny Lind  
They named a candy after her  
A circus after him  
End of my story  
The rest is history  
She in all of her glory  
He lived quietly  
He needed her she needed him  
As sure as the skies above  
In a way it was for them  
A lesson in love a lesson in love  
You look like the moon glow  
That follows me home  
Always makes me turn around  
Wont leave me alone  
First to come are the midgets  
A monkey and a kid  
Followed by those two onearmed jugglers  
The ego and the id  
Songs of the season  
Apples of the sun  
There is no rhyme or reason  
Just a time for each and every one  
Hang on Mr Barnum  
Hang on Jenny Lind  
We will meet you in streets of gold  
Where eternity begins  
We will let it all hangout  
Go hand in glove  
Life was meant to live and learn  
A lesson in love a lesson in love
