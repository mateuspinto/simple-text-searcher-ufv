You wanna play you wanna stay you wanna have it all  
You started messing with my head until I hit a wall  
Maybe I shoulda known maybe I shoulda known  
That you would walk you would walk out the door  
  
Hey  
  
Said we were done you met someone and rubbed it in my face  
Cut to the punch she broke your heart and then she ran away  
I guess you shoulda known I guess you shoulda known  
That I would talk I would talk  
  
But even if the stars and moon collide  
I never want you back into my life  
You can take your words and all your lies  
Oh oh oh I really dont care  
Even if the stars and moon collide  
I never want you back into my life  
You can take your words and all your lies  
Oh oh oh I really dont care  
Oh oh oh I really dont care  
  
I cant believe I ever stayed up writing songs about you  
You dont deserve to know the way I used to think about you  
Oh no not anymore oh no not anymore  
You had your shot had your shot but you let go  
  
Now if we meet out on the street I wont be running scared  
Ill walk right up to you and put one finger in the air  
And make you understand and make you understand  
You had your chance had your chance  
  
But even if the stars and moon collide  
I never want you back into my life  
You can take your words and all your lies  
Oh oh oh I really dont care  
But even if the stars and moon collide  
I never want you back into my life  
You can take your words and all your lies  
Oh oh oh I really dont care  
Oh oh oh I really dont care  
  
But even if the stars and moon collide  
I never want you back into my life  
You can take your words and all your lies  
Oh oh oh I really dont care  
Even if the stars and moon collide  
I never want you back into my life  
You can take your words and all your lies  
Oh oh oh I really dont care  
Oh oh oh I really dont care
