Is this is not a pretty tale  
Is this not a riddle  
A bow shoots arrows through the air  
A bow drags notes from a fiddle  
But who is the beau of a young girls heart  
That a king may send to battle  
Is this not a pretty tale  
Is this not a riddle  
If red is the breast of soldiers tunic hung with a silver medal  
And red is the thorn that protects the rose  
A deeper red than the petal  
How deep is the red our redeemer bled  
The debt of our sins to settle  
How deep is the red  
How deep is the red  
How deep is the red our redeemer bled  
How deep is the red  
How deep is the red  
How deep is the red  
How deep is the red  
How deep is the red our redeemer bled  
How deep is the red  
How deep is the red  
How deep is the red  
How deep is the red  
Is this is not a pretty tale  
Is this not a riddle  
A bow shoots arrows through the air  
A bow drags notes from a fiddle  
But who is the beau of a young girls heart  
How deep is the red  
How deep is the red  
How deep is the red
