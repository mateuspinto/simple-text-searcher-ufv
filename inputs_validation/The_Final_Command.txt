Screams of terror across the sea  
Begging for mercy in their one final plea  
Soldiers prepare to fight to the death  
Fighting and killing to their very last breath  
Blitzkrieg tactics of the German command  
Born with the power of God in his hand  
He makes his move to conquer the land  
Turning all hopes of life to sand  
  
Chorus  
Machine gun fire blood level higher  
Visions of torture and terror to all  
Ready for battle awaiting the final command  
  
Hiding in darkness from enemies unseen  
Awaiting our victory ending his dream  
Cursed are the souls who defy his will  
All of which are tortured and ruthlessly killed  
Blitzkrieg tactics of the German command  
Born with the power of God in his hand  
Shocking the world with his mass devastation  
He puts all his power in the trust of one nation  
  
Chorus  
  
At the crack of dawn they storm again  
Hunting fighting and killing all men  
The end is near our time now short  
Our kingdoms have fallen as a result of his sport  
Blitzkrieg tactics of the German command  
Born with the power of God in his hand  
Withdrawn from fighting he now takes his leave  
Seeking out goals that cant be conceived  
  
Chorus
