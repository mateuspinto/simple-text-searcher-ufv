You missed the winter and it followed you back home  
Where sun kissed the crimson footsteps in the melting snow  
We are doing our best to disown the golden mean  
By these acts of cruelty in the name of beauty to be free  
  
The acoustic funeral for love in limbo  
Were dancing with tags on our toes  
I saved my last breath for your window  
To write you this song for the acoustic funeral  
  
On the verge of a vow to kill all reason locking that door  
To a nightmare within a nightmare we are bound to adore  
Let the pleasure in the shape of a heart lie to me  
And finally confirm all fears to be so real  
Be so real  
  
The acoustic funeral for love in limbo  
Were dancing with tags on our toes  
I saved my last breath for your window  
To write you this song for the acoustic funeral  
  
Underneath the ice so thin I am turning blue Im turning blue  
The one last thing I know to be real is the shadow of you  
Killing love with a kiss  
  
The acoustic funeral for love in limbo  
Were dancing with tags on our toes  
I saved my last breath for your window  
To write you this song  
  
The acoustic funeral for love in limbo  
The acoustic funeral for love in limbo  
Were dancing with tags on our toes  
Were dancing with tags on our toes  
I saved my last breath for your window  
To write you this song for the acoustic funeral  
  
Lest we have to fall  
For the acoustic funeral  
  
Killing love with a kiss
