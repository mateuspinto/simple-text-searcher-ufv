Oh so long for this night I prayed  
That a star would guide you my way  
To share with me this special day  
Where a ribbon in the sky for our love  
  
If allowed may I touch your hand  
And if pleased may I once again  
So that you too will understand  
Theres a ribbon in the sky for our love  
  
This is not a coincidence  
And far more than a lucky chance  
But what is that was always meant  
Is our ribbon in the sky for our love love  
  
We cant lose with God on our side  
Well find strength in each tear we cry  
From now on it will be you and I  
And our ribbon in the sky  
Ribbon in the sky  
A ribbon in the sky for our love  
  
Theres a ribbon in the sky for our love
