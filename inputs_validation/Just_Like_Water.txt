Moving down the streams of my lifetime  
Pools of fascination in my sleep  
Cooling off the fire of my longing  
Warming up my cold with in his heat  
Melting down the walls of inhibition  
Evaporating all of my fears  
Baptizing me to complete submission  
Desolving my condition with his tears  
  
Its just like the water  
I aint felt this way in years  
Its just like the waters the water  
I aint felt this way in years  
  
Coursing through my senses hes prevailing  
Floating through the space of my design  
Drowning me i find my inside sailing  
Drinking in the mainstream of his mind  
Filling up the cup of my emotions  
Spilling over into all I do  
If only I could get lost in his ocean  
Surviving on the thought of loving you  
  
Its just like the water  
I aint felt this way in years in years  
Its just like the water the water  
I aint felt this way in years  
  
Bathing in the fountain of his essence  
He causes my expression to remain  
Humbled on the mountain by his presence  
Washing my intentions with his name  
Sealing all the floodgates of his passion  
Saving all his liquid for his own  
Moisturizing me to satisfaction  
In my imagination oh no  
Hes pouring out his soul to me for hours and hours  
Drawing out my nature with his hands  
Yearning Im so thirsty for his power  
Burning to be worthy of his land  
  
Its just like the water  
I aint felt this way in years in years  
Its just like the waters the water  
I aint felt this way in years  
  
Cleaning me hes purging me and moving me around  
Hes bathing and hes cleaning me and moving me around  
Around and around and around and around  
Washing me cleaning me moving me around  
Hes purging me hes been cleaning me and moving me around  
And around and around
