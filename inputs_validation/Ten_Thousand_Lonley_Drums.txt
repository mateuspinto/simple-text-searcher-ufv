Youre breaking my paradise  
Hearing an echo cry  
Dont be fool for stealing hearts  
Dreamland at your fate  
You never find your way  
Dont be fool for tears of love  
All precious memories you had through the years  
All they are passing one by one  
You kill the memories  
Wave off the pain and tears  
Baby together we are strong  
  
10000 lonely drums  
Are playing in my heart  
10000 drums of dreaming fell apart  
10000 drums are playing just for you  
10000 drums are saying Im missing you  
  
Oh my drums  
Theyre playing in your mind  
Thinking of endless lovers  
Some too hard  
Oh my drums  
I never let you go  
They give the mimbick of a lonely drum  
  
Like a hero will smile again  
If you will play this game  
Dont be a thief for stealin hearts  
Like all the thousend smiles  
It takes a little while  
Dont be fool for tears I love  
Welcome to paradise  
If you will realise  
Then passing one by one  
You kill the memories  
Wave off the pain and fears  
Baby together we are strong
