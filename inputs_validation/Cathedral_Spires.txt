They have blown away the daylight hours we had  
Left a legacy a deadly aftermath  
We cannot exist in godforsaken lands  
As we spiral down into oblivion  
Breathing the fumes of fires that they ignite  
Losing ground and we are all just losing sight  
We shall never see another setting sun  
Time to rise up and ascend the end has come  
  
No more willpower  
Choked by hell fire  
Darkness above  
Blackening out the sun  
Gripped by steel claws  
Corrosion eating us  
  
So before were all devoured  
Time to rise up and retire  
In cathedral spires  
Watching as the world expires  
From up amongst the clouds  
In cathedral spires  
  
No names  
No graves  
No prayers  
Can save us  
  
Ashes to dust  
Doomsdays upon us now  
  
It cannot be stopped  
Genocide all is lost  
  
Oh Were so tired  
Time to rise up and conspire  
In cathedral spires  
Watching as our world expires  
From up above the clouds  
In cathedral spires  
  
Jaws of corruption  
Swallow us as one  
Consuming every nation  
Evoke resistance getting none  
Complete disintegration  
No good to defend  
There can be but one outcome  
We are no more  ascend  
  
Vaporized fury  
Offers no sanctuary  
  
Oh Were so tired  
Time to rise up and retire  
In cathedral spires  
Watching as the world expires  
From up amongst the clouds  
In cathedral  
In cathedral spires  
  
Oh Were so tired  
Watching the world expire  
Time that we retire  
Up in cathedral spires  
  
Oh Were so tired  
Watching the world expire  
Time that we retire  
Up in cathedral spires  
  
Oh Were so tired  
Watching the world expire  
Time that we retire  
Up in cathedral spires  
  
Oh Were so tired  
Watching the world expire  
Time that we retire  
Up in cathedral spires
