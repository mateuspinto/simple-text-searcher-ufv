Some day my pain  
Some day my pain  
Will mark you  
  
Harness your blame  
Harness your blame  
And walk through  
  
With the wild wolves around you  
In the morning Ill call you  
Send it farther on  
  
Solace my game  
Solace my game  
It stars you  
  
Swing wide your crane  
Swing wide your crane  
And run me through  
  
And the storys all over you  
In the morning Ill call you  
Cant you find a clue when  
Your eyes are all painted Sinatra blue  
  
What might have been lost  
What might have been lost  
What might have been lost  
What might have been lost  
What might have been lost  
Dont bother me  
What might have been lost  
Dont bother me  
What might have been lost  
What might have been lost  
  
Someday my pain  
Someday my pain  
Someday my pain  
Someday my pain
