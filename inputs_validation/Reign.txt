I am the lightning i am the heat  
I am the rain rain oh rain oh reign all day  
I am the rain  
Im gonna reign this way again  
I am the rain  
  
I am the spy  
Before the blade  
I am the raindrop out I see I cause  
The ripples that becoming the crashing waves  
I am the rain rain oh rain oh reign all day  
I am the rain  
  
You thought a different day had come  
A day you thought the earth was done  
And if you could have said it all  
I know you would have said it all  
You thought a different day had come  
A day you thought the earth was done  
And if you could have said it all  
I know you would have said it all  
  
I am the rain  
Im gonna reign this way again reign this way again  
I am the rain rain oh rain oh reign all day  
  
You thought a different day had come  
A day you thought the earth was done  
I am the rain  
And if you could have said it all  
I know you would have said it all  
I am the rain
