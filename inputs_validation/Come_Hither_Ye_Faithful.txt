Come hither ye faithful  
Triumphantly sing  
Come see in the manger  
The angels dread King  
  
Refrain  
To Bethlehem hasten with joyful accord  
O come ye come hither O come ye come hither  
O come ye come hither to worship the Lord  
  
True Son of the Father  
He comes from the skies  
To be born of a virgin  
He doth not despise  
  
Refrain  
To Bethlehem hasten with joyful accord  
O come ye come hither O come ye come hither  
O come ye come hither to worship the Lord  
  
Hark hark to the angels  
All singing in Heavn  
To God in the highest  
All glory be given  
  
Refrain  
To Bethlehem hasten with joyful accord  
O come ye come hither O come ye come hither  
O come ye come hither to worship the Lord  
  
To Thee then O Jesu this day of Thy birth  
Be glory and honor through heaven and earth  
True Godhead incarnate Omnipotent Word  
O come let us hasten O come let us hasten  
O come let us hasten to worship the Lord
