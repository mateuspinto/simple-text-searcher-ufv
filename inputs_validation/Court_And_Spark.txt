Love came to my door  
With a sleeping roll  
And a madmans soul  
He thought for sure Id seen him  
Dancing up a river in the dark  
Looking for a woman  
To court and spark  
  
He was playing on the sidewalk  
For passing change  
When something strange happened  
Glory train passed through him  
So he buried the coins he made  
In Peoples Park  
And went looking for a woman  
To court and spark  
  
It seemed like he read my mind  
He saw me mistrusting him  
And still acting kind  
He saw how I worried sometimes  
I worry sometimes  
  
All the guilty people he said  
Theyve all seen the stain  
On their daily bread  
On their christian names  
I cleared myself  
I sacrificed my blues  
And you could complete me  
Id complete you  
  
His eyes were the color of the sand  
And the sea  
And the more he talked to me  
The more he reached me  
But I couldnt let go of LA  
City of the fallen angels
