Who is that upon the stairs  
Acting like he dont know where  
And who is laying down all the cards  
And giving me the wrong things to say  
And like a wheel on the table  
  
Hes a Cain to my Abel  
Oh its my shadow  
A confessor to my dreams casting ribbons round my feet  
Oh into my day  
  
Its my shadow  
Making eyes until the sun lights the daytime as she comes  
Oh into my day  
  
Happy in the time when I would have been there to see you  
Happy in the time when I would have been there at all  
Happy when the night is gone and I believe you  
Happy when the night is gone and I need a call  
  
Who is chasing in the wind all the letters never sent  
And who is dusting down the stars and giving me the wrong moves to make  
And like a wheel on the table hes a Cain to my Abel  
Dancing upon the floor its my shadow  
Making eyes until the sun blinds the daytime as she comes  
Oh into my day  
  
Its my shadow  
Like a willow to my stream casting heaven round my feet  
Oh into my day  
  
When you find that things are getting wild is that  
The hardest smile that you can ever feel  
When you find that things are getting wild is that  
The hardest smile that you can ever feel  
Paralyzed until the sun lights the daytime as she comes  
And if my shadow comes a creeping  
Then Ill always find me sleeping in the sun  
  
When you find that things are getting wild is that  
The hardest smile that you can ever feel  
When you find that things are getting wild is that  
The hardest smile that you can ever feel  
When you find that things are getting wild is that  
The hardest smile that you can ever feel  
When you find that things are getting wild is that  
The hardest smile that you can ever feel  
When you find that things are getting wild is that  
The hardest smile that you can ever feel  
When you find that things are getting wild is that  
The hardest smile that you can ever feel  
When you find that things are getting wild is that  
The hardest smile that you can ever feel
