Beth I hear you calling  
But I cant come home right now  
Me and the boys are playing  
And we just cant find the sound  
  
Just a few more hours  
And Ill be right home to you  
I think I hear them calling  
Oh Beth what can I do  
Beth what can I do  
  
You say you feel so empty  
That our house just aint our home  
Im always somewhere else  
And youre always there alone  
  
Just a few more hours  
And Ill be right home to you  
I think I hear them calling  
Oh Beth what can I do  
Beth what can I do  
  
Beth I know youre lonely  
And I hope youll be alright  
Cause me and the boys will be playing all night
