The blond in the bleachers  
She flips her hair for you  
Above the loudspeakers  
You start to fall  
She follows you home  
But you miss living alone  
You can still hear sweet mysteries  
Calling you  
The bands and the roadies  
Lovin em and leavin em  
Its pleasure to try em  
Its trouble to keep em  
Cause it seems like youve gotta give up  
Such a piece of your soul  
When you give up the chase  
Feeling it hot and cold  
Youre in rock n roll  
Its the nature of the race  
Its the unknown child  
So sweet and wild  
Its youth  
Its too good to waste  
  
She tapes her regrets  
To the microphone stand  
She says You cant hold the hand  
Of a rock n roll man  
Very long  
Or count on your plans  
With a rock n roll man  
Very long  
Compete with the fans  
For your rock n roll man  
For very long  
The girls and the bands  
And the rock n roll man
