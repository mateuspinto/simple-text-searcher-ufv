His old man was a rebel yeller  
Bad boy to the bone hed say  
Cant trust a colored feller  
And hed judge em by the tone of their skin  
And he was raised to think like his dad  
Narrow mind full of hate  
On the road to nowhere fast  
Until the grace of god got in the way  
Then he saw the light and hit his knees and cried and said a prayer  
And rose up a brand new man and left the old one right there  
  
Chorus  
Heres to the strong  
Thanks to the brave  
Dont give up hope  
Some people change  
Against all odds  
Against the grain  
Love finds a way  
Some people change  
  
She was born with her mothers habit  
Guess you could say its in her blood  
She hates it that shes gotta have it  
She fills her glass up  
And shed love to kill that bottle  
But all she could think about is a  
A better life a second chance  
And everyone shes lettin down  
  
She throws that bottle down  
  
Chorus  
  
Thank god for those who make it  
Let them be the love  
  
Some people change  
  
Chorus
