One early morning as I was walking  
I met a woman we started talking  
I took her home to get a few nips  
But all I had was a mint julep  
  
I dont remember just how I started  
I only know that we should have parted  
I stole a kiss and then another  
I didnt mean to take it further  
  
One mint julep was the cause of it all  
The lights were burning low there in the parlor  
When through the kitchen door up popped her father  
He said I saw you when you kissed my daughter  
Better wed her right now or face a slaughter  
  
I didnt know just what I was doing  
I had to marry of face ruin  
  
A mint julep a mint julep  
A mint julep a mint julep  
One mint julep was the cause of it all  
  
Now I dont want to bore you with my troubles  
But from now on Ill be thinking double  
Im through with flirting and drinking whiskey  
I got six extra children from agetting frisky  
  
A mint julep a mint julep  
A mint julep a mint julep  
One mint julep was the cause of it all
