My daddy told me always be strong son  
Dont you ever cry  
You find the pretty girls and then you love them  
And then you say goodbye  
I never dreamed that you would leave me  
But now youre gone  
I never dreamed that I would miss you  
Woman wont you come back home  
  
I never dreamed that you could hurt me  
And leave me blue  
Ive had a thousand maybe more  
But never one like you  
I never dreamed I could feel so empty  
But now Im down  
I never dreamed that I would beg you  
But woman I need you now  
  
It seems to me I took your love for granted  
It feels to me this time I was wrong so wrong  
Oh Lord how I feel so lonely  
I said woman wont you come back home  
  
I tried to do what my daddy told me  
But I think he knew  
Someday I would find  
One woman like you  
I never dreamed it could feel so good Lord  
That two could be one  
I never knew about sweet love  
So woman wont you come back home  
Oh baby wont you come back home
