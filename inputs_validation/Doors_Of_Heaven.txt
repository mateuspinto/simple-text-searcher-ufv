Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
If all the doors were closed in heaven  
Where would all the angels go  
Would they just fly around forever  
Or would they come down here below  
If the pearly gates were closed this morning  
Would there be angels here tonight  
And would they live their lives among us  
And share the darkness with their light  
If all the doors were close in heaven  
Theyd have to close the road to hell  
Wed all be stuck here with each other  
There would be nowhere else to dwell  
If the pearly gates were closed this morning  
And everyone there had to leave  
And death was nothing but a moment  
Beyond the breaths you took to breathe  
If all the doors were closed in heaven  
Who would dare abuse a child  
Or let a little kid go hungry  
Or not return a simple smile  
If the pearly gates were closed this morning  
And the host of heaven was on the street  
I wonder if theyd look much different  
From the likes of you and me  
So I hope they close the doors to heaven  
And all the angels up above  
Come and build a home among us  
Remind us what it is to love  
If the pearly gates were closed this morning  
Would there be angels here tonight  
And would they live their lives among us  
And share the darkness with their light
