Other arms have held me before your time  
Other lips have thrilled me before your time  
Other eyes have seen the light you see in my eyes tonight  
Oh but darling that was long before your time  
Other hearts have been broken before your time  
Unkind words were spoken before your time  
Other ears have heard me say the things I say to you today  
But darling that was long before your time  
Before you came along I sang this same old song before  
The melody was born when we walk right to loves door  
The words I love you came but I just couldnt sing that line  
Oh but darling that was long before your time  
Before you came along
