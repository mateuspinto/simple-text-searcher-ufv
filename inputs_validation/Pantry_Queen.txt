Your wind blows  
Your mind falls down  
Just give me  
The time to drown  
  
Your wind blows  
Your mind falls down  
Just give me  
The time to drown  
  
The boys are  
Digging the ground  
But I cant stop spinning around  
  
One day you will let me be  
What I wanted you to be  
  
The boys are  
Stopping the ground  
From taking  
Those things we found  
Someday you will let me see  
All of the things we used to see  
  
Someday you will let me be  
All of the things we used to be  
Someday you will let me be  
The champ you wanted her to see
