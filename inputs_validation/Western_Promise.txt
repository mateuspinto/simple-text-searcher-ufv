Hai  
Oh mystical East on old postcards  
Your childhood dreams and energies  
Your temples gardens old world charm  
An ancient culture torn and scarred  
This is my Western promise  
Oh mystical East youve lost your way  
Your rising sun shall rise again  
My Western world gives out her hand  
A victors help to your fallen land  
This is my Western promise  
Hai  
Mystical East all taxicabs  
All ultraneon sign of the times  
Your Buddha Zen and Christian man  
All minions to messiah Pepsi can  
This is my Western promise
