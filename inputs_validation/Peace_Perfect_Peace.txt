We cry for peace perfect peace  
Lord we cry for love in this neighborhood  
I tell you no water can put out this fire  
Only the lord can save us  
We cry for peace in South Africa  
Let me tell you we cry for peace in South Africa  
We cry for peace perfect peace  
Lord we cry for love in this neighborhood  
Let me tell you no water can put out this fire  
Only the lord can save us  
We cry for peace in South Africa  
Let me tell you we cry for peace in South Africa
