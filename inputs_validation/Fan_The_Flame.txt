Once a wiseman said to me  
This advice I give you free  
A woman is made of fantasy  
So fan the flame  
  
Always keep her hopes up high  
Make her laugh dont make her cry and dont let her love die  
So fan the flame  
A woman needs love and affection and little things mean a lot  
Little things mean a lot  
  
And when she has an emotional baby  
Thats why you got to fan the flame to keep it burning hot  
Make her feel shes ten feet tall even though she short and small  
So fan the flame  
  
Her love is your reality let her go and you will see just how lonely life can
be  
So fan the flame  
A woman needs love and praising so give her them each day  
Tell her you love her its added protection  
Thats why you got to fan the flame to keep it burning hot  
  
Once a wiseman said to me  
This advice I give you free  
A woman is made of fantasy  
So fan the flame
