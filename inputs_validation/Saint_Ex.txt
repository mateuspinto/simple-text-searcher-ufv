Sometimes they see you just now they dont  
Maybe this is a lucky day or a penny on the way home  
Sit between the clouds for cover raindrops hide in the sea  
Olly olly oxen free  
  
The bliss of anonymity phonography of the heart  
A well executed smile the Wind Sand and the Stars  
Words living in translation flowers under glass  
Oh the future slipping past  
  
Save me slowly tame me  
Dont apologize with philosophy  
Come closer tame me  
Dont you recognize we are not enemies  
  
Lamplighters and Counters kings and drunks and clowns  
Saddle up the planet ride to the heart of town  
Snakes do swallow elephants children all wear crowns  
If I knew I knew you I never would have shot you down  
  
Save me slowly tame me  
Dont apologize with philosophy  
Come closer tame me  
Dont you recognize we are not enemies  
  
Save me slowly tame me  
Dont apologize with philosophy  
Come closer tame me  
Dont you recognize we are not enemies
