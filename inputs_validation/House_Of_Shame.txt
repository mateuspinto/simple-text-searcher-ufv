First you say you needed me  
Then you give me sympathy  
They say good girls never win  
Something good in giving in  
How do I get through to you  
You must be made of stone  
  
Just when I was safe and sound  
Love you built a wall around  
You take a hard line attitude  
Time to send me back to school  
Or take me take me to your  
  
House of shame  
Easy on your body when you got no name  
Hold me like you know me  
Im a falling star  
Catch me if you can  
Show me the way inside  
  
You can knock on any door  
I know what Im looking for  
Red light hit and run  
Time to turn the engine on  
Pretty girl lives all alone  
I must be going home  
  
Hot as hell and cold as ice  
Everything I sacrifice  
I got to pick up on what you do  
I just cant get over you  
You take me take me to your  
  
House of shame  
Easy on your body when you got no name  
Hold me like you know me  
Im a falling star  
Catch me if you can  
Show me the way inside  
  
Tell me what you really want from life  
Loving you darling  
You got me infatuated  
Good love is not for sale  
I nearly gave myself away  
  
Pretty girl lives all alone  
Take me to your take me to your  
House of shame  
Easy on your body when you got no name  
Hold me like you know me  
Im a falling star  
Catch me if you can  
Show me the way inside
