Theres a snake coming out of the darkness  
Parade from paradise  
End the need for Eden  
Chase the dreams of merchandise  
There is tic toc in atomic  
Leaders make a deal  
The cosmic is largely comic  
A con they couldnt conceal  
There is no safe seat at the feast  
Take your best stab at the beast  
The night is turning thin  
The saint is turning to sin  
Raise the art to resistance  
Danger dare to be grand  
Pride reduced to humble pie  
Diamonds down to sand  
Take heart from earth and weather  
The brightness of new birth  
Take heart from the harvest  
Shave the harvest from the earth  
There is no safe seat at the feast  
Take your best stab at the beast  
The night is turning thin  
The saint is turning to sin  
Reasoning is partly insane  
Image just an eyeless game  
The night is turning thin  
The saint is turning to sin  
Miracles will have their claimers  
More will bow to Rome  
He and she are in the house  
But theres only me at home  
Rose is a rose of splendor  
Posed to respond in the end  
Lonely things like nights I find  
End finer with a friend  
I hear in the rate of her heart  
A tear in the heat of the art  
The night is turning thin  
The saint is turning to sin  
There is no safe seat at the feast  
Take your best stab at the beast  
The night turns thin  
The saint turns to sin
