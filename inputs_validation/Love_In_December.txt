We had a million of days  
I know that our time has run out  
Youre my everlasting groove  
Forget the past for the time to come  
In all our thoughts and will meet again  
Never leave me out here in the cold I say  
For my never ending dream  
  
Love in December  
I will always remember  
A summer with passion  
A fatal attraction  
Colours are fading  
Like the leaves in November  
Whats left of the magic  
  
We had a million of days  
I know that our time has run out  
Youre my everlasting groove  
Forget the past for the time to come  
In all our thoughts and we will meet again  
Never leave me out here in the cold I say  
For my never ending dream  
  
Love in December  
I will always remember  
A summer with passion  
A fatal attraction  
Colours are fading  
Like the leaves in November  
Whats left of the magic  
We felt in the springtime  
  
Cause theres a place in the world  
I know where I rather would be  
In the fairy tales of love  
Where everything has a happy end  
A world my friend  
In fantasialand  
We will be together all the time my dear  
In the fairytales of love  
  
Love in December  
I will always remember  
A summer with passion  
Fatal attraction  
Colours are fading  
Like the leaves in November  
Whats left of the magic  
We felt in the springtime  
  
For a moment a touch you feel  
Like a vision of an angel  
As our love undecided disappears forever  
Always longing to have you NEAR  
Fell the power and the passion  
Feel me slipping from your hands  
Please break my fall  
  
Love in December  
I will always remember  
A summer with passion  
A fatal attraction  
Colours are fading  
Like the leaves in November  
Whats left of the magic  
We felt in the springtime
