It could all be so simple  
But youd rather make it hard  
Loving you is like a battle  
And we both end up with scars  
Tell me who I have to be  
To get some reciprocity  
No one loves you more than me  
And no one ever will  
  
Is this just a silly game  
That forces you to act this way  
Forces you to scream my name  
Then pretend that you cant stay  
Tell me who I have to be  
To get some reciprocity  
No one loves you more than me  
And no one ever will  
  
No matter how I think we grow  
You always seem to let me know  
It aint workin It aint workin No it aint workin  
And when I try to walk away  
Youd hurt yourself to make me stay  
This is crazy this is crazy This is crazy uhhuh  
  
I keep letting you back in  
How can I explain myself  
As painful as this thing has been  
I just cant be with no one else  
See I know what weve got to do  
You let go and Ill let go too  
Cause no ones hurt me more than you  
And no one ever will  
  
No matter how I think we grow  
You always seem to let me know  
It aint workin It aint workin It aint workin  
And when I try to walk away  
Youd hurt yourself to make me stay  
This is crazy this is crazy  
  
Care for me care for me  
I know you care for me  
  
There for me there for me  
Said youd be there for me  
  
Cry for me cry for me  
You said youd die for me  
  
Give to me give to me  
Why wont you live for me
