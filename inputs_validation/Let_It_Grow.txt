Morning comes she follows the path to the river shore  
Lightly sung her song is the latch on the mornings door  
See the sun sparkle in the reeds silver beads pass into the sea  
  
She comes from a town where they call her the woodcutters daughter  
Shes brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water and  
She bears it away with a love that the river has taught her  
  
Let it flow greatly grow wide and clear  
Round and round the cut of the plow in the furrowed field  
Seasons round the bushels of corn and the barley meal  
Broken ground open and beckoning to the spring  
Black dirt live again  
The plowman is broad as the back of the land he is sowing  
As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing  
That the work of his day measures more than the planting and growing  
  
Let it grow let it grow greatly yield  
What shall we say shall we call it by a name  
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin  
Water bright as the sky from which it came  
And the name is on the earth that takes it in  
We will not speak but stand inside the rain  
And listen to the thunder shouting i am i am i am i am  
  
Nothin more the love of the women work of men  
Seasons round creatures great and small up and down as we rise and fall
