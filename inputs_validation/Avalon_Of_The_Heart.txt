On down by Avalon  
Avalon of the heart  
On down by Avalon  
Gonna make a brand new start  
  
Oh the Holy Grail  
Baby behind the sun  
Oh the Holy Grail  
Down by Avalon  
  
Well I came upon  
The enchanted veil  
Down by the viaducts of my dreams  
Down by Camelot hangs the tale  
In the ancient vale  
  
Oh the Avalon sunset  
Avalon of the heart  
Me and my lady  
Goin down by Avalon  
  
Well I came upon  
The enchanted vale  
Down by the viaducts of my dreams  
Near Camelot hangs the tale  
Of the enchanted vale  
  
In the upper room  
There the cup does stand  
In the upper room  
Down by Avalon  
  
Goin down by Avalon  
Oh my Avalon of the heart  
Goin down by Avalon  
Gonna make a brand new start  
  
Oh down by Avalon  
Oh baby behind the sun  
Goin down by Avalon  
Well the journeys just begun  
  
Oh down by Avalon  
Sweet Avalon of the heart  
Goin down by Avalon  
Gonna make a brand new start
