Like a rare piece of crystal  
Like a fine china cup  
I kept your memory all safely locked up  
Afraid I could never love somebody new  
I was trying to save what I had left of you  
  
Then he broke your memory last night  
I felt it shatter inside  
I guess he held me a little too right  
He broke your memory last night  
  
The moment he touched me with his gentle hands  
Your memory crumbled like a house built on sand  
He swept all the pieces of your love away  
And then gave me his love to put in its place  
  
Cause he broke your memory last night  
I felt it shatter inside  
I guess he held me a little too right  
He broke your memory last night  
He broke your memory last night
