Lost in day to day  
Turned another way  
With a laugh a kind hello  
Some small talk with those I know  
I forget that Im not over you  
For a while  
  
A wave an easy grin  
A smile to put them in  
With other lives to listen to  
And some work Ive got to do  
I forget that Im not over you  
For a while  
  
Days go by with no empty feeling  
Until I remember youre gone  
  
People say to me you need company  
When you have some time to spend  
Drop around and meet a friend  
They forget that Im not over you  
For a while  
They forget that Im not over you  
For a while
