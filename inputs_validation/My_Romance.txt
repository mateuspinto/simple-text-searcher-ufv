Look at the way the flowers bloom for you  
They want to show you their beauty Lord  
Running waters dance  
You and I romance  
  
Chorus  
  
Unto You be all the glory x2  
  
Bridge  
  
Angels dance around You  
The earth it sings about You  
Open up the heavens Lord  
Let your kingdom come to earth  
  
My praises all surround You  
My soul cant dance without You  
Open up the heavens Lord  
Let your kingdom come to earth
