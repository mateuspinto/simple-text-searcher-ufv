You had all of me you wanted more  
Would you have married me if I were poor  
Yes if I was your treasury  
Youd have found a time to treasure me  
  
How come you cant see  
All that you need  
Is right here with me  
  
Up Until the end  
All this pretend  
Wasnt for free  
  
Hold me like your money  
Tell me that you want me  
Spend your love on me  
Spend your love on me  
Now you have your money  
Spend it til theres nothing  
Spend your love on me  
Spend your love on me  
  
If we opened up a joint account  
Would it put an end to all your doubt  
Frankly if my name was Benjamin  
We wouldnt be in the mess were in  
  
You played with my heart  
till death do we part  
Thats what you said  
Now you have your fast cars  
Women and bars  
Its gone to your head  
  
Hold me like your money  
Tell me that you want me  
Spend your love on me  
Spend your love on me  
Love me like your money  
Spend it til theres nothing  
Spend your love on me  
Spend your love on me  
  
Spend your love on me  
  
I want you to take me  
Like you took your money  
Take me in your arms  
Until your last breath  
  
I want you to hold me  
Like you hold your money  
Hold on to it  
Till theres nothing left  
  
Love spent  
Feeling love spent  
Yeah Im love spent  
Wondering where the love went  
Love spent  
Yeah Im love spent  
Really love spent  
Wondering where it all went  
  
I want you to take me  
Like you took your money  
Take me in your arms  
Until your last breath  
  
I want you to hold me  
Like you hold your money  
Hold me in your arms  
Until theres nothing left nothing left nothing left  
  
Love spent  
Feeling love spent  
Yeah Im love spent  
Wondering where the love went  
Love spent  
Yeah Im love spent  
Really love spent  
Wondering where it all went  
  
I want you to take me  
Like you took your money  
Take me in your arms  
Until your last breath  
  
I want you to hold me  
Like you hold your money  
Hold me in your arms  
Until theres nothing left nothing left nothing left
