The evening breeze caressed the trees tenderly  
The trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly  
Then you and I came wandering by  
And lost in a sigh were we  
The shore was kissed by sea and mist tenderly  
  
I cant forget how two hearts met breathlessly  
Your arms opened wide and closed me inside  
You took my lips you took my love so tenderly  
  
Your arms opened wide and closed me inside  
You took my lips you took my love so tenderly
