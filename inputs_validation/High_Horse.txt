Get up on your high horse woman  
Get up on your high horse now  
And get up on your high horse woman  
Ill make it up to you somehow  
  
Moonlit shadow she starts a trippin firelight  
Jumpin the trees lyin across the right of way  
Silvery mornin it glistens down the valley  
But she dont stop til we ride the night away  
  
Get up on your high horse woman  
Get up on your high horse now  
Get up on your high horse woman  
Ill make it up to you somehow  
  
Blonde braids tangle at the misty break of mornin  
Catchin light through a dusty window pane  
Lost in lust in denial of the warnin  
She digs her heels in this stallions flank again  
  
Get up on your high horse woman  
Get up on your high horse now  
Get up on your high horse woman  
Ill make it up to you somehow  
  
Get up on your high horse woman  
You paid the price you get to play  
Get up on your high horse woman  
Youre gonna ride to the break of day  
  
To the break of day  
To the break of day  
To the break of day  
  
Get up on your high horse woman  
Get up on your high horse now  
Get up on your high horse woman  
Ill make it up to you somehow  
  
Get up on your high horse woman  
You paid the price you get to play  
Get up on your high horse woman  
Youre gonna ride to the break of day
