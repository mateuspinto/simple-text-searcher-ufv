You might believe and still you feel the chase has just begun  
That you must reach that horizon before the setting of the sun  
You chase the light in front of you nightfall close behind  
If you stop to catch your breath you know what you will find  
  
Chorus  
Dont slow down dont touch the ground  
You know what you will find  
That old grey man in tattered clothes following behind  
  
No time to stop dont go to sleep prepare to pay the cost  
The hours and minutes are passing by another day is lost  
Impatience is a virtue catch me if you can  
The seconds have been ticking by since your life began
