In the twilight glow I see you  
Blue eyes cryin in the rain  
When we kissed goodbye and parted  
I knew wed never meet again  
Love is like a dying ember  
And only memories remain  
  
And through the ages I remember  
Blue eyes cryin in the rain  
Blue eyes cryin in the rain  
  
Someday when we meet up yonder  
Well stroll hand in hand again  
In a land that knows no parting  
Blue eyes cryin in the rain  
Love is like a dying ember  
And only memories remain  
  
And through the ages I remember  
Blue eyes cryin in the rain  
Blue eyes cryin in the rain
