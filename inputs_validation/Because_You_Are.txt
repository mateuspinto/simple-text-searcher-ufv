Infinite beauty humbly and faint  
In a mortal and breakable body You came  
To rescue our souls from the debts they were in  
Because of in spite of to cover my sins  
  
Master and servant together in one  
Come to redeem what our hearts had undone  
Saviour of all come to gather his kin  
Because of in spite of to cover my sins  
  
Holy unbreakable infinite God  
Ever unchanging in all that You are  
Light of the world and the sun and the stars  
You are I am and I am because You are  
  
Shepherd and pastured a wandering sheep  
Gave up His life so our own we could keep  
Soldier in battle for souls He might win  
Because of in spite of to cover my sins  
  
Holy unbreakable infinite God  
Ever unchanging in all that You are  
Light of the world and the sun and the stars  
You are I am and I am because You are  
  
Humbly forsaking His heavenly seat  
Beaten bloodied and washing my feet  
Opened our eyes to what loving it means  
The blood on my hands is what washes me clean  
  
Holy unbreakable infinite God  
Ever unchanging in all that You are  
Light of the world and the sun and the stars  
You are I am and I am because You are  
  
Holy unbreakable infinite God  
Ever unchanging in all that You are  
Light of the world and the sun and the stars  
You are I am and I am  
You are I am and I am because You are
