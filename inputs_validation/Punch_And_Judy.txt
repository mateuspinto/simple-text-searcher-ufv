Gather round  
Punch and Judy  
Did it truly  
And were married in a haste  
In love maybe  
Using the baby  
As a kind of romance paste  
Shes grown fatter  
Her hair cut shorter  
Looks much older than nineteen  
Hes a drinker  
Not a thinker  
Baby spoiled his couldhavebeen  
This must be makebelieve  
This must be makebelieve  
This must be makebelieve  
Cause who do we know dear who acts like that  
Punch and Judy  
Punch and Judy  
In a semi  
On a brand new council plot  
Sunday lunchtime  
BeerforPunch time  
While his dinners far from hot  
She grows tired  
Cab is hired  
She goes round to see her friend  
He comes back late  
Fool is irate  
We will see his temper bend  
This must be makebelieve  
This must be makebelieve  
This must be makebelieve  
Cause who do we know dear who acts like that  
Punch and Judy  
In a quandary  
Shes walked out and he is mad  
Now hes grown up  
Cant smash home up  
Retribution must be had  
Punch and Judy  
Had a baby  
Who brought them to married bliss  
Mr Punch  
Has drunken hunch  
That he must punish kid for this  
This must be makebelieve  
This must be makebelieve  
This must be makebelieve  
Cause who do we know dear who acts like that  
Punch and Judy
