She is waiting to kiss my hand  
But she will wait for my command  
My chains and collar brought her to her knees  
She now is free to please  
  
Woman be my slave  
Thats your reason to live  
Woman be my slave  
The greatest gift I can give  
Woman be my slave  
  
Before her surrender she had no life  
Now shes a slave not a wife  
Her only sorrow is for women who live with lies  
Shes taken off her disguise  
  
Woman be my slave  
Thats your reason to live  
Woman be my slave  
The greatest gift I can give  
Woman be my slave  
  
Your body belongs to me  
  
Woman come here  
Remove your garments  
Kneel before me  
Please me  
  
Woman be my slave  
Thats your reason to live  
Woman be my slave  
The greatest gift I can give  
Woman be my slave
