Oh I love to dance  
Under an alien sun  
Along the dunes with you I kiss you in the sand  
We give so that we live  
Beside the sleepy snakes  
They dream of you and me when will they ever end  
For a million years they dream  
For a million years they dream  
And the fog conceals and hides and eats our souls  
Before they open up their eyes again  
How far well be  
Remember me  
  
Wont stop loving you although it seems to be  
Our time is running out Im leaving you behind  
No matter what they say wed never meet again  
Our love is bigger than our lives  
And we know that yesterday  
The moon was brown  
And that today it is black  
And that tomorrow it is red  
And we know that when we go to the sun  
The moon comes along  
Hello there  
And the cows in the pasture graze  
And we know that we know what we know  
Is it truth
