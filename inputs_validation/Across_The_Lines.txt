Across the lines  
Who would dare to go  
Under the bridge  
Over the tracks  
That separates whites from blacks  
  
Choose sides  
Or run for your life  
Tonight the riots begin  
On the back streets of America  
They kill the dream of America  
  
Little black girl gets assaulted  
Aint no reason why  
Newspaper prints the story  
And racist tempers fly  
Next day it starts a riot  
Knives and guns are drawn  
Two black boys get killed  
One white boy goes blind  
  
Little black girl gets assaulted  
Dont no one know her name  
Lots of people hurt and angry  
Shes the one to blame
