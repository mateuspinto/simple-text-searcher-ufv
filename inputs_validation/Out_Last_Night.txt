We went out last night  
Like we swore we wouldnt do  
Drank to much beer last night  
A lot more than we wanted to  
There were girls from Argentina and Arkansas  
Maine Alabama and Panama  
All mixed together and having a ball  
  
Yeah we went out last night  
One thing started leadin to another  
Out last night  
Hittin on everybody and their mother  
There were two karaoke girls drunk on a dare  
Singing I Got You Babe by Sonny and Cher  
Yeah life was good everywhere  
We went out last night  
  
Well you know Im a music man  
I grew up in East Tennessee  
But last night I was everything  
When I got a few drinks in me  
I was a doctor a lawyer a senators son  
Brad Pitts brother and a man on the run  
Anything I thought would get the job done  
  
Yeah we went out last night  
One thing started leadin to another  
Out last night  
Hittin on everybody and their mother  
There were people doin body shots up on the bar  
Jimmy in a fist fight out by the car  
Everybody was some kind of star  
When we went out last night  
  
Well the fact that Im still breathing  
Means that I must have survived  
And that Ill live to go out with  
My friends again tonight  
  
Oh we went out last night  
One thing started leadin to another  
Out last night  
Everybody started lovin on each other  
They were dancin on the tables howlin at the moon  
Pairing off together and pretty soon  
There was not a soul in sight  
When we went out last night
