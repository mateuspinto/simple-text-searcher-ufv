Bee girl youre gonna die  
You dont want to be famous you want to be shy  
Do your dances alone in your room  
Becoming a star will become your doom  
  
Bee girl be a girl  
Bee girl be a girl  
You know time is long and life is short  
Begin to live while you still can  
  
Believe in nothing believe me  
Those who can be trusted can change their mind  
The anxious is the present  
Unwrap your gifts take your time  
  
Everything you imagined  
Neednt be stuck in your mind  
Bee girl be a girl  
Bee girl be a girl  
Thank you
