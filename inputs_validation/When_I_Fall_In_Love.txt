When I fall in love it will be forever  
Or Ill never fall in love  
In a restless world like this is  
Love is ended before its begun  
And too many moonlight kisses  
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun  
  
When I give my heart it will be completely  
Or Ill never give my heart  
And the moment I can feel  
That you feel that way too  
Is when I fall in love with you  
  
And the moment I can feel  
That you feel that way too  
Is when I fall in love with you
