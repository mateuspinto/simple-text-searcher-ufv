Some would say there is trouble in my home  
Even when I am alone  
Some would say there is always someone home  
Even though I might be gone  
  
Speak to me my friend I know youre there  
Speak to me my friend speak to me speak to me  
  
I can always feel its there creeping one step behind me  
Cold hands in the night I know that its watching me  
The poltergeist living in my home  
Could be a friend or foe  
The poltergeist living in my home  
Could be a friend for life or a foe until the night I die  
  
Speak to me my friend let me hear your tongue  
Speak to me my friend speak to me speak to me  
  
Speak to me my friend I know youre there  
Speak to me my friend speak to me speak to me  
  
My guests can never tell when its creeping up to touch them  
They will never ever know our game  
Until they feel it and scream  
  
The poltergeist living in my home  
Could be a friend or foe  
The poltergeist living in my home  
Could be a friend for life or a foe until the night I die  
  
Speak to me my friend we are one and the same  
Now that youre living here welcome home  
Welcome home  
You can stay forever
