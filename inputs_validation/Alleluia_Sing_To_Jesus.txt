Alleluia Sing to Jesus His the scepter his the throne  
Alleluia His the triumph His the victory alone  
Hark The songs of peaceful Zion thunder like a mighty flood  
Jesus out of every nation hath redeemed us by his blood  
  
Alleluia Not as orphans are we left in sorrow now  
Alleluia He is near us faith believes nor questions how  
Though the cloud from sight received him when the forty days were oer  
Shall our hearts forget his promise I am with you evermore  
  
Alleluia Bread of heaven here on earth our food and stay  
Alleluia Here the sinful flee to thee from day to day  
Intercessor Friend of sinners earths Redeemer plead for me  
Where the songs of all the sinless sweep across the crystal sea  
  
Alleluia King eternal thee the Lord of Lords we own  
Alleluia Born of Mary earth thy footstool heaven thy throne  
Thou within the veil hast entered robed in flesh our great High Priest  
Thou on earth both Priest and Victim in the Eucharistic Feast
