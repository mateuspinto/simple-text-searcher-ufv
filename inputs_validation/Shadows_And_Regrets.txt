Im back back in town  
And everything has changed  
I feel feel let down  
The faces stay the same  
I see see shadows  
Of who we used to be  
When I drive drive so slow  
Through this memory  
  
When we were only kids  
And we were best of friends  
And we hoped for the best  
And let go of the rest  
  
I heard heard myself  
Say things I take back  
If I could could retell  
And make these stories last  
I see see shadows  
Of who well always be  
When I drive drive these roads  
That made our memories  
  
When we were only kids  
And we were best of friends  
And we hoped for the best  
And let go from the rest  
The shadows and regrets  
We let go of the rest  
  
Everything has changed everything has changed  
The faces stay the same faces stay the same  
Everything has changed everything has changed  
The faces stay the same  
  
And we were only kids  
And our time couldnt end  
And how tall did we stand  
With the world in my hands  
  
And we were only kids  
And we were best of friends  
And we hoped for the best  
And let go of the rest  
The shadows and regrets  
We let go of the rest  
The shadows and regrets  
We let go of the rest
