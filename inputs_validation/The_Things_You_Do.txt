Colour my world all black and blue  
The hell you dish out  
Comes back threefold to you  
Inside your riddled rotten core  
I hope you get what you deserve  
Worse and even more  
Even more  
Even more  
  
Chorus  
How can you do the things you do  
You make Satan look like Christ  
I swear its true  
How could you do the things you do  
How could you do  
The things you do  
  
The Rolling Stones once sang a tune  
Singing words of sympathy  
Yet none were sung for you  
If the lord of darkness seen you comin his way  
Hed get on his knees  
And look to Jesus  
Start to pray  
Start to pray  
  
Chorus  
  
More  
Even more  
Even more  
  
Chorus
