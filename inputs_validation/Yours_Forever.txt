Here we are in the grays of winter  
Here we are just me and you  
Hold my hand  
Lets face tomorrow  
Tomorrow still holds out its hands to you  
  
This precious time weve only borrowed  
The autumn winds have blown on through  
A quiet thought will tell our story  
Tomorrow still holds out its hands to you  
Yes tomorrow still holds out its hands to you  
  
Here some wings  
There yours forever  
And heres some dreams  
That will come true  
Take these tears to wash away your sorrows  
Tomorrow still holds out its hands to you  
Yes tomorrow still holds out its to you  
Yes tomorrow still holds out its hands to you
