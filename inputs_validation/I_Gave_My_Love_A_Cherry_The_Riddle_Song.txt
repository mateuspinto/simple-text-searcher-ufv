I gave my love a cherry  
That had no stone  
I gave my love a chicken  
That had no bone  
I told my love a story  
That had no end  
I gave my love a baby  
With no crying  
How can there be a cherry  
That has no stone  
And how can there be a chicken  
That has no bone  
And how can there be a story  
That has no end  
And how can there be a baby  
With no crying  
  
A cherry when its blooming  
It has no stone  
A chicken when its pippin  
It has no bone  
The story that I love you  
It has no end  
A baby when its sleeping  
Its no crying
