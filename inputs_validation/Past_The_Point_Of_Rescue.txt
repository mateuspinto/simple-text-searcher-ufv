Last night I dreamed you were back again  
Larger than life again holding me tight again  
Placing those same kisses on my brow  
Sweeter than ever now lord I remember how  
Couldnt get enough of kissing  
Do you know how much Im missing  
No you dont but I do  
Days like a slow train trickle by  
Even the words that I write refuse to fly  
All that I can hear is your song haunting me  
Cant get the melody out of my head you see  
Distractions Ive been using  
Do you know how much Im losing  
No you dont but I do  
But I do and I wonder if Im past the point of rescue  
An is no word from you at all the best that you can do  
Never meant to push or shove you  
Do you know how much I love you  
No you dont but I do
