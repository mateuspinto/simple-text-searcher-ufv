Mother Russia how are you sleeping  
Middle winter cold winds blow  
From the trees the snowflakes drifting  
Swirling round like ghosts in the snow  
  
Mother Russia poetry majestic  
Tells the time of a great empire  
Turning round the old man ponders  
Reminiscing an age gone by  
  
Mother Russia  
Dance of the czars  
Hold up your heads  
Be proud of what you are  
Now it has come  
Freedom at last  
Turning the tides of history  
And your past  
  
Mother Russia  
Dance of the czars  
Hold up your heads  
Remember who you are  
Can you release  
The anger the grief  
Can you be happy  
Now your people are free
