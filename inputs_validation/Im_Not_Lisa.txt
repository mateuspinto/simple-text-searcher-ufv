Im not Lisa  
My name is Julie  
Lisa left you  
Years ago  
  
My eyes are not blue  
But mine wont leave you  
Till the sunlight  
Has touched your face  
  
She was your morning light  
Her smile told of no night  
Your love for her grew  
With each rising sun  
  
And then one winter day  
His hand laid her away  
She left you here  
Drowning in your tears  
Here where youve stayed for years  
Crying
