I bring truth and understanding  
I bring wit and wisdom fair  
Precious gifts beyond compare  
We can build a world of wonder  
I can make you all aware  
I will find you food and shelter  
Show you fire to keep you warm  
Through the endless winter storms  
You can live in grace and comfort  
In the world that you transform   
  
The people were delighted  
Coming forth to claim their prize  
They ran to build their cities  
And converse among the wise  
But one day the streets fell silent  
Yet they knew not what was wrong  
The urge to build these fine things  
Seemed not to be so strong  
The wise men were consulted  
And the Bridge of Death was crossed  
In quest of Dionysus  
To find out what they had lost
