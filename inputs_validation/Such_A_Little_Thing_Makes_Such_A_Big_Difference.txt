Such a little thing  
Such a little thing  
But the difference it made was grave  
There you go  
Wielding a bicycle chain  
Oh why wont you change  
Change and be nicer  
  
Such a little thing  
A gentle tone of kindness  
Or written words on paper  
Can you write  
  
How I love all of  
The very simple things of life  
Gods good air  
How I love all of  
The very simple things of life  
  
Such a little thing  
A fumbling politeness  
The difference saved me  
Wielding a bicycle chain  
Why wont you change  
I will not change  
And I will not be nice  
Most people keep their brains  
Between their legs  
dont you find  
  
Leave me alone  I was only singing  
Leave me alone because  
I was only singing  
Leave me alone  I was only singing  
Leave me alone  
You have just proved again  
Most people keep their brains  
Between their legs
