Paying dues and learning vices  
  
When the big guns start to shooting  
With the bullets of deception honey  
With a smile upon your face  
Youre going from second hand to almost new

But I say I find it far too tall tall tall tall tall

And maybe all the tulips  
In Amsterdam

But I say I find it far too tall tall tall tall tall
