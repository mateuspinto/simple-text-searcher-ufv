Look at the sky as you walk through life  
So that tears wont overflow your heart  
As you remember the spring day so bright  
On this lonely lonely night  
  
Look at the sky when you walk through life  
See how the stars blow away your tears flow  
As you remember the summer day so bright  
On this lonely lonely night  
  
Happiness may seem just out of sight  
Beyond the clouds try as we might  
  
Look at the sky when you walk through life  
So that tears wont overflow your heart  
As we cry our way down the street  
On this lonely lonely night  
  
As you remember autumn day so bright  
On this lonely lonely night  
  
Sadness is something we find out too soon  
There in the stars and the shadow of the moon  
  
Look at the sky when you walk through life  
So that tears wont overflow your heart  
As we cry in our winter days  
On this lonely lonely night  
On this lonely lonely night  
  
Look at the sky when you walk through life  
On this lonely night
