Like a bird on the wire  
Like a drunk in a midnight choir  
I have tried in my way to be free  
Like a worm on a hook  
Like a knight from some old fashioned book  
I have saved all my ribbons for thee  
If I if I have been unkind  
I hope that you can just let it go by  
If I if I have been untrue  
I hope you know it was never to you  
  
Like a baby stillborn  
Like a beast with his horn  
I have torn everyone who reached out for me  
But I swear by this song  
And by all that I have done wrong  
I will make it all up to thee  
I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch  
He said to me You must not ask for so much  
And a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door  
She cried to me Hey why not ask for more  
  
Oh like a bird on the wire  
Like a drunk in a midnight choir have tried in my way to be free
