I will drink the cup  
The poison overflowing  
I will lift you up  
Watch over where youre going  
The first one in  
The last one gone  
Ill be the rock  
To stand upon  
For you for you  
  
My spirit aches  
And I cant stop this river flowing  
In fear I take  
Each labored breath I draw in knowing  
That this could be my life  
My final hour  
But faith and hope and love  
Give me the power  
For you for you  
  
Yay though I walk through the valley  
of the shadow of death  
I will fear no evil  
for you are with me  
you are with me  
  
Ill be your salvation  
Though the storm surrounding  
There are no conditions  
Lay my body down  
In the wake abandon  
Willing sacrifice  
Ill walk through the canyon  
Bring the shadows light  
For you for you  
  
I will drink the cup  
The poison overflowing  
I will lift you up  
Watch over where youre going  
The first one in  
The last one gone  
Ill be the rock to stand upon  
The first one in  
The last one gone  
Ill be the rock to stand upon  
For you  
For you  
For you  
For you
