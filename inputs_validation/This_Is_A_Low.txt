And into the sea goes pretty England and me  
Around the bay of Biscay and back for tea  
Hit traffic on the dogger bank  
Up the Thames to find a taxi rank  
Sail on by with the tide and go to sleep  
And the radio says  
  
Chorus  
This is a low  
But it wont hurt you  
When you are alone it will be there with you  
Finding ways to stay solo  
  
On the tyne forth and cramity  
Theres a low in the high forties  
And Saturdays locked away on the pier  
Not fast enough dear  
And on the malin head black pool looks blue and red  
And the queen shes gone round the bend  
Jumped off lands end  
And the radio says  
  
Chorus  
  
This is a low  
But it wont hurt you  
When you are alone it will be there with you  
This is a low  
But it wont hurt you  
When you are alone it will be there with you  
Finding ways to stay solo
