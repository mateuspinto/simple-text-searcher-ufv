When you sleep where do your fingers go  
what do your fingers know  
what do your fingers show  
where do your fingers go yea  
  
when you sleep do they trembleon the edge of the bed  
or do you fold them neatly by your head  
do they clench like claws against your own skin  
when youre living your day all over again  
  
When you sleep where do your fingers go  
what do your fingers know  
what do your fingers show  
where do your fingers go yea  
  
when you sleep do they trembleon the edge of the bed  
or do you fold them neatly by your head  
do they clench like claws against your own skin  
when youre living your day all over again  
  
do they play guitar in a latin bar  
are they strangers or lovers do they drive your car  
are they swimming submissivly sex acts of life  
or just cutting through jello with a very sharp knife  
now Zeus was a womanizer  
always on the lake  
but Hera usually punished her  
that Zeus was one to take  
  
when you sleeeeeeeeeeeeep  
where do your fingers go  
  
Are they pulling out weeds form the dusty soil  
are they never rewarded fruits of the toil  
are they scratching their nails on the chalk boards of death  
only seeking attention when everyone in the room has left  
  
When you sleep where do your fingers go  
what do your fingers know  
what do your fingers show  
where do your fingers go yea  
  
when you sleep do they trembleon the edge of the bed  
or do you fold them neatly by your head
