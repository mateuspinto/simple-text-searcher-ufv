He watches witches weaving wonders  
Seeing the future past and present  
Of messages the universe sends  
Inside their crystal balls of thunder  
They summon through the sphere  
A child so fair so virgin pure  
They summon me my slave  
Bring her to their lure  
The beauty and the beast  
The beauty and the beast  
But I can see the blood on your sins  
She calls christ in churches crimson  
Ive got to take her  Leave her  Take her  
Tell me the price if I deliver  
By one a slave of flesh  
In vain wasting their breath  
They guide me through the lake  
They summon his return  
The beauty and the beast  
The beauty and the beast  
They cast countless conjurations  
He didnt sign the pact the fact is  
Their screams of failure fade to whispers  
Trying to heal their mental blisters  
A child so fair so golden pure  
They didnt realise  
They summon through the sphere  
This was the demons cure  
The beauty and the beast  
The beauty and the beast
