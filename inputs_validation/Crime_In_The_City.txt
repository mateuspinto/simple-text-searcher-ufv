Well the cop made the showdown  
He was sure he was right  
He had all of the lowdown  
From the bank heist last night  
His best friend was the robber  
And his wife was a thief  
All the children were killers  
They couldnt get no relief  
The bungalow was surrounded  
When a voice loud and clear  
Said Come on out with your hands up  
Or well blow you out of here  
There was a face in the window  
The TV cameras rolled  
Then they cut to the announcer  
And the story was told  
  
The artist looked at the producer  
The producer sat back  
He said What we have got here  
Is a perfect track  
But we dont have a vocal  
And we dont have a song  
If we could get these things accomplished  
Nothin else could go wrong  
So he balanced the ashtray  
As he picked up the phone  
And said Send me a songwriter  
Whos drifted far from home  
And make sure that hes hungry  
Make sure hes alone  
Send me a cheeseburger  
And a new Rolling Stone  
Yeah  
  
Theres still crime in the city  
Said the cop on the beat  
I dont know if I can stop it  
I feel like meat on the street  
They paint my car like a target  
I take my orders from fools  
Meanwhile some kid blows my head off  
Well I play by their rules  
Thats why Im doin it my way  
I took the law in my hands  
  
So here I am in the alleyway  
A wad of cash in my pants  
I get paid by a ten year old  
He says he looks up to me  
Theres still crime in the city  
But its good to be free  
Yeah  
  
Now I come from a family  
That has a broken home  
Sometimes I talk to Daddy  
On the telephone  
When he says that he loves me  
I know that he does  
But I wish I could see him  
I wish I knew where he was  
But thats the way all my friends are  
Except maybe one or two  
Wish I could see him this weekend  
Wish I could walk in his shoes  
But now Im doin my own thing  
Sometimes Im good then Im bad  
Although my home has been broken  
Its the best home I ever had  
Yeah  
  
Well I keep gettin younger  
My lifes been funny that way  
Before I ever learned to talk  
I forgot what to say  
I sassed back to my mom  
I sassed back to my teacher  
I got thrown out of Bible school  
For sassin back at the preacher  
Then I grew up to be a fireman  
Put out every fire in town  
Put out anything smokin  
But when I put the hose down  
The judge sent me to prison  
He gave me life without parole  
Wish I never put the hose down  
Wish I never got old
