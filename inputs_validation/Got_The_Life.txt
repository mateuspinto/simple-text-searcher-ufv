Hate something sometime someway something kick off the for me  
Something inside  
Ill never ever follow  
So give me something that is for real  
Ill never ever follow  
  
Get your boogie on  
  
Hate something someway each day dealing with no forgiveness  
Why This shit inside  
Now everyone will follow  
So give me nothing just feel  
And now this shit will follow  
  
God begs me the more I see the light who wants to see  
God told me Ive already got the light oh I say  
God begs me the more I see the light who wants to see  
God told me Ive already got the light oh I say  
  
Each day I can feel it swallow inside something they took from me  
I dont feel your deathly ways  
Each day I feel so hollow inside I was beating me  
You will never see so come dance with me  
  
Dance with me  
Rumbiddieboo  
Rum bum dee dumb dee bum diddie doo  
Lie  
  
God begs me the more I see the light who wants to see  
God told me Ive already got the light oh I say  
God begs me the more I see the light who wants to see  
God told me Ive already got the light oh I say  
  
Got the life  
  
Got the life
