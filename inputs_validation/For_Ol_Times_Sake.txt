Before you go walk out on me  
Take a look around tell me what you see  
Here I stand like an open book  
Is there something here you might have overlooked  
  
Cause it would be a shame if you should leave  
And find that freedom aint what you thought it would be  
  
The years we had were not all bad  
In fact I know the good outweighed the bad  
Now you say that youve grown tired  
You want to be by yourself awhile  
  
It would be a shame if you should go  
And find that freedom was a long time ago  
  
I know that you cant stand the chains that bind you  
They just keep on drivin us apart  
And you could go where I could never find you  
But could you go far enough to get away from your heart  
  
So one more time for ol times sake  
Come and lay your head upon my chest  
Please dont throw this moment away  
We can forget the bad and take the best  
  
If you dont have nothing left to say  
Let me hold you one more time for ol times sake  
  
And if you dont have nothing left to say  
Let me hold you one more time for ol times sake
