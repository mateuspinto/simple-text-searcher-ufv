Hi kids Welcome to The Uncle Bobo Show  
Are you ready to sing  
Come on lets go  
Billy and his family  
Went on a holiday  
They went down to Florida  
To laugh and dance and play  
Bill went in for a swim  
He didnt see the harm  
But when he came back out again  
He was short an arm  
  
Cause Rippy The Gator went chomp chomp chomp  
Rippy The Gator went chomp chomp chomp  
Passing the time By ending childrens lives  
Down in the bottom of the swamp swamp swamp  
  
Billy and his father  
Went out to play some catch  
But Billy missed the pass  
Because his arm was unattached  
The ball flew past his shoulder  
And it rolled into the swamp  
When he went wading after it  
His leg became a stump  
  
Cause Rippy The Gator went chomp chomp chomp  
Rippy The Gator went chomp chomp chomp  
Passing the time By ending childrens lives  
Down in the bottom of the swamp swamp swamp  
  
Billy and his father  
Joined a threelegged race  
They were tearing up the field  
No one could keep the pace  
But Billy tripped and did a flip  
And landed in the muck  
He was running out of limbs  
And also out of luck  
  
Cause Rippy The Gator went chomp chomp chomp  
Rippy The Gator went CHOMP chomp chomp  
Passing the time By ending childrens lives  
Down in the bottom of the swamp swamp swamp  
  
Billy was all dirty  
He really had to wash  
But he couldnt use a towel  
Cause his limbs had been gnawed off  
He went into the water  
To get all clean and bright  
But when he was finished  
He was only half his height  
  
Cause Rippy The Gator went chomp chomp chomp  
Rippy The Gator went chomp chomp chomp  
Passing the time By ending childrens lives  
Down in the bottom of the swamp swamp swamp  
  
Billys father rolled his wheelchair  
Up upon a hill  
He wanted to take Bill  
Where he would not get killed  
But he left him on a slope  
And into a swamp he rolled  
They dragged out his head  
But there was nothing down below  
  
Cause Rippy The Gator went chomp chomp chomp  
Rippy The Gator went chomp chomp chomp  
Passing the time By ending childrens lives  
Down in the bottom of the swamp swamp swamp  
Passing the time by ending childrens lives  
Down in the bottom of the swamp  
Down in the swamp
