I guess its cause and effect  
Your heart and mine  
The way that we connect  
Keeps blowing my mind  
There you go again it never ends  
What you do to me  
  
Chorus  
That I have seen the light of day  
Love is finally going my way  
Is it too good to be true  
Give me one more kiss one more touch  
Baby I just cant get enough of you  
This time too good is true  
  
All of a sudden  
Im not who I used to be  
I had my heart locked  
But you held the key  
And you find a way everday  
To show me even more  
  
Chorus  
  
Some people say were too good to be true  
But they dont get to be loved by you  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh this time too good is true  
Yes it is yeah
