Near to you near to you  
Even though youre far away  
So near to you always near to you  
As near as April is to may  
Cant you feel me there in my favourite chair  
Staring at the fireplace  
Oh so near to you always near to you  
Even now it seems were face to face  
But it is just if though I was standing before you  
Telling you how much I adore you  
If Im really dear to you near to you  
We may be far apart and yet  
If Im in your heart really in your heart  
How near to you can I get  
2x  
Oh so near to you always near to you  
As near as April is to may  
Cant you feel me there in my favourite chair  
Staring at the fireplace  
Oh so near to you always near to you  
Even now it seems were face to face  
But it is just if though I was standing before you  
Telling you how much I adore you  
If Im really dear to you near to you  
We may be far apart and yet  
If Im in your heart really in your heart  
How near to you can I get  
How near to you can I get  
How near to you can I get
