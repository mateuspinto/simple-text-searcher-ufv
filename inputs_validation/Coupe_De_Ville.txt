I got a Coupe De Ville  
I got a bed in the house  
Where you once lived  
  
I had a few cheap thrills  
But they cost me a lot more  
Than I could give  
  
I got a right in this crazy world  
To live my life like anyone else  
How long can I carry this monkey around  
All by myself  
  
If I cant have you  
I dont want nothin else  
If I cant have you  
I dont want nothin else  
  
Well I hit the wall  
Woke up this mornin  
And I hit the wall  
  
Yeah I hit the wall  
Woke up this mornin  
And I hit the wall  
  
I got a right in this crazy world  
To live my life like anyone else  
How long can I carry this monkey around  
All by myself  
  
If I cant have you  
I dont want nothin else  
If I cant have you  
I dont want nothin else
