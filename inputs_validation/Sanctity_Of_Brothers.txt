A west side run through  
One string away from taking the lead  
We stalked the streets at night  
To live to feel to breath  
  
Bring back those days of gold  
Where the torch was ours to bare  
A troubled youth to some  
To us our crown to wear  
  
I see a time  
A sanctity of brothers  
We knew another world  
We knew another world  
  
We knew another  
  
A west side horror  
A torch burned out  
Before his own time  
We close our eyes at night  
To hurt to heal to breath  
  
Bring back those days of gold  
Where the torch was ours to bare  
A troubled youth to some  
To us our crown to wear  
  
I see a time  
A sanctity of brothers  
We knew another world  
We knew another world  
  
Bring us back to the day  
Bring us back to our age of innocence  
Our time to live forever  
Our worlds will meet again  
  
Worlds
