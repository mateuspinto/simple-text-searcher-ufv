Thought that Id be happy  
Gonna be so happy living life alone  
And never sharing anything  
  
Thought that I was finished  
Thought that I was complete  
Thought that I was whole  
Instead of being half of something  
  
Thought that I was growing growing older  
Wiser understanding why  
This world hold nothing for my spirit  
Thought that I was destined  
  
Destined to be nothing  
Destined to be nothing in this world  
And then I met you  
  
I met you  
  
Thought that God had failed me  
Thought my prayers were useless  
Thought that he would never give  
The chance for me to praise him  
  
Thought the book was written  
Thought the game had ended  
Thought the song was sung  
And I could never sing another  
  
Thought my faith was misplaced  
Thought my back was broken  
  
Broken by a weight that I  
Was never fit to carry  
Thought I knew this city  
Thought I knew all about it  
And then one night I went to Morningside  
And you were waiting  
Then I met you
