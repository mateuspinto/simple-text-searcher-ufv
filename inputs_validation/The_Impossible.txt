We were two little people wrapped up in this big old world  
Drifting round in space out of place just a boy and girl  
Then you took my hand and made me a part of you  
And I looked in your heart  
And saw all my dreams come true  
  
You did the impossible  
You rescued my love  
You did the impossible  
See I had almost given up  
  
And now I love ya like summer time love ya like cherry wine  
Love ya like free money like a preacher loves Sunday  
Love ya like freeze pop love ya like a milk shake  
Love ya like a high school girl on a first date  
Love ya like shootin stars love ya like a muscle car  
Love ya like were destined  
Love ya like my lover and best friend  
Yeah you did the impossible  
  
Tonight Im gonna need all your attention  
close the door  
I wanna do things I probably shouldnt mention  
Like a bird Im gon hum  
Those three words I love you I love you I love you  
Freeze the time let the world go by  
If youre mine say you love me you love me you love me  
Boy take my hand and make me a part of you and the love that  
You gave me has pulled me through  
  
You did the impossible  
You rescued my love  
You did the impossible  
See I had almost given up  
  
And now I love ya like Sunsets bubble baths on the jet  
Love ya like koolaid Louis Millionaire shades  
Love ya like sugar daddys love ya like a pimp caddy  
Love ya like a holiday Duncan Hines yellow cane  
Love ya like its five am and Im off work  
Love ya like Louboutin Heels and a Mini Skirt  
Love ya like an asher cut pink and white engagement ring  
Love ya like layin in bed bumpin Jodeci  
  
And Im forever your lady  
Layin in bed bumpin Jodeci  
And Im forever your lady  
Layin in bed bumpin Jodeci  
  
And Im forever your lady  
I love you like the sunsets in the evening  
Layin in bed bumpin Jodeci  
Like the shooting stars  
And Im forever your lady  
Yeah I love you  
Layin in the bed bumpin Jodeci  
Oh You did the Impossible  
  
Id almost given up  
  
The impossible
