Ooh Baby hmmm  
Listen up to what I got to say  
I found true love and its here to stay  
Chapel bells are gonna ring in me  
I met an angel on Christmas day  
Twentyfourth of December  
It was a cold and snowing night  
I still can remember Gazing at the stars and the moonlight  
Fell asleep on a sofabed  
Dreams of Christmas in my head  
But I woke up to my surprise  
There he was right in front of my eyes  
Listen up to what I got to say  
I found true love and its here to stay  
Chapel bells are gonna ring in me  
I met an angel on Christmas day  
I was stuffing the stockings  
And hanging tincel on the tree  
When I heard him knocking  
I opened the door in time to see  
Carollers sing Silver Bells  
I saw his face thats when I fell  
He was there bent on one knee  
Santa sent him just for me  
Listen up to what I got to say  
I found true love and its here to stay  
Chapel bells are gonna ring in me  
I met an angel on a Christmas day  
Yeah yeah  
And I know this love will grow  
When flowers bloom in early spring  
Ill be his bride  
Ill wear his ring  
So if your looking for an angel who  
Is gonna make your every dream come true  
Just write a letter saying Santa hey  
Ill need an angel next Christmas day  
Yeah  
Yeah yeah baby  
Ooh  
Ding ding dong ding  
Listen up what I got to say hey  
I found true love and its here to stay  
Chapel bells are gonna ring and ring in me  
I met an angel on a Christmas day
