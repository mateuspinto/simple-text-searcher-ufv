As I rode ashore from my schooner close by  
A girl on the beach sir I chanced to espy  
Her hair it was red and her bonnet was blue  
Her place of abode was in Harbour LeCou  
Oh boldly I asked her to walk on the sand  
She smiled like an angel and held out her hand  
So I buttoned me guernsey and hoved way me chew  
In the dark rolling waters of Harbour LeCou  
  
My ship she lay anchored far out on the tide  
As I stroll along with that maid at my side  
I told her I loved her I said Ill be true  
And I winked at the moon over Harbour LeCou  
As we walked on the sands at the close of the day  
I thought of my wife who was home in Torbay  
I knew that shed kill me if she only knew  
I was courting this lassie in Harbour LeCou  
  
As we passed a log cabin that stood on the shore  
I met an old comrade Id sailed with before  
He treated me kindly saying Jack how are you  
Its seldom I see you in Harbour LeCou  
And as I was parting this maiden in tow  
He broke up my party with one single blow  
He said regards to your missus  
And your wee kiddies too  
I remember her well shes from Harbour LeCou  
  
I looked at this damsel astanding long side  
Her jaw it just dropped and her mouth opened wide  
And then like a shecat upon me she flew  
And I fled from the furies of Harbour LeCou  
  
So come all you young sailors who walk on the shore  
Beware of old comrades you sailed with before  
Beware of the maidens with the bonnets of blue  
And the pretty young damsels of Harbour LeCou  
And the pretty young damsels of Harbour LeCou
