Magic is the moonlight  
On this lovers dream night  
As I see the moonlight  
Shining in your eyes  
  
Cant resist their power  
In this moon lit hour  
Love being any flower  
This is paradise  
  
Living in the splendor  
Of your kiss so tender  
Makes my heart surrender  
To your love divine  
  
Magic is the moonlight  
More than any dream night  
Magic is the moonlight  
For it made you mine  
  
Living in the splendor  
Of your kiss so tender  
Makes my heart surrender  
To your love divine  
  
Magic is the moonlight  
More than any dream night  
Magic is the moonlight  
For it made you mine  
  
Magic is the moonlight  
For it made you mine
