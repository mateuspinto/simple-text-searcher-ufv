Golden Earth Girl Female Animal  
Sings To The Wind Resting At Sunset  
In A Mossy Nest  
Sensing Moonlight In The Air  
Moonlight In The Air  
  
Good Clear Water Friend Of Wilderness  
Sees In The Pool Her Own Reflection  
In Another Woeld  
Someone Over There Is Counting  
  
Fish In A Sunbeam  
In Eggshell Seas  
Fish In A Sunbeam  
Eggshell Finish  
  
Natures Lover Climbs The Primrose Hill  
Smiles At The Sky Watching The Sunset  
From A Mossy Nest  
As She Falls Asleep Shes Counting   
  
Fosh In A Sunbeam  
In Eggshell Seas  
Fish In A Sunbeam  
Eggshell Finish
