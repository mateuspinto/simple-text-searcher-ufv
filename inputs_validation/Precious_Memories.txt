Precious memories unseen angels  
Sent from somewhere to my soul  
How they linger ever near me  
And the sacred scenes unfold  
  
Precious memories how they linger  
How they ever flood my soul  
In the stillness of the midnight  
Precious sacred scenes unfold  
  
Precious father loving mother  
Fly across the lonely years  
And old home scenes of my childhood  
In fond memory appear  
  
In the stillness of the midnight  
Echoes from the past I hear  
Oldtime singing gladness bringing  
From that lovely land somewhere  
  
I remember mother praying  
Father too on bended knee  
Sun is sinking shadows falling  
But their prayers still follow me well  
  
As I travel on lifes pathway  
Know not what the years may hold  
As I ponder hope grows fonder  
Precious memories flood my soul
