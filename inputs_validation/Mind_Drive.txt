And the test of song  
It will comfort you

On this night of nights  
They will make it through  
  
Through the eyes of child  
And the wish you are  
As the thought that comes  
From a distant star  
  
Whatever thoughts you have  
Can become a new dream  
For the perfect stance  
Take you there and back again  
  
And you believe you are  
Independently whole  
Waiting for the signs whole home  
Reaching for the far side show  
  
Whole  
Dancing for the moon  
Dancing for the light

Dancing for the hour earth  
Dancing for the light

Each and every night  
  
With her wings of hope  
They will cover you  
They will make it right

Close around your soul  
It will count for you  
It will make you whole

And the song of songs  
It will make you move

And so it comes to this now  
When you walk into the bliss that  
Holds down the fire  
As pleasure will divide divine  
  
So close so let your heart enter  
Succumb and let your heart enter this So come and let  
  
So close and let yourself lose control  
Heaven help the love that you send  
Heaven has the love you send  
Really Breathe

When tense it will come to you Wait as it will come to you  
Fear of the future response Feel it as a future response  
You get the heaven you like  
You get to heaven  
You get the heaven you need  
You get to heaven now
