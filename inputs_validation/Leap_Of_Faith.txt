After my baby quit me  
I wouldnt even go outside  
When my friends tried to fix me up  
I crawl under my bed and hide  
I knew I was never gonna change my look  
Till I got my Incomprehensible up to try  
And when I went ahead and spread my wings  
I found out that I could fly  
Sometime all it takes is a leap of faith  
Leap of faith  
Sometimes all it takes is a leap of faith  
Leap of faith  
I had no way of knowing  
What would come from our first kiss  
It scares me now to think about  
The good love that I might have missed  
I was just tryin to find some help  
Tryin to see myself as a survivor  
I had to rise up from the ashes of love  
And jump back into the fire  
Sometime all it takes is a leap of faith oh yeah  
Leap of faith  
Sometimes all it takes is a leap of faith  
Leap of faith  
Sometimes you gotto believe  
Before you see the proof  
You can wait a lifetime  
For one moment of truth  
Sometimes all it takes is a leap of faith  
Yeah oh yeah  
You gotto believe  
Before you see the proof  
You can wait a lifetime  
For one moment of truth  
Oh yeah sometimes all it takes is a leap of faith  
Sometimes all it takes  
Leap of faith  
Sometimes all it takes  
Leap of faith  
Sometimes all it takes is a leap of faith oh yes it does  
Leap of faith  
Sometimes all it takes is a leap of faith  
Leap of faith  
Oh sometimes all it takes  
Leap of faith  
Sometimes all it takes is a leap of faith oh yeah  
Leap of faith  
Sometimes all it takes is a leap of faith oh yes it does  
Sometimes all it takes is a leap of faith
