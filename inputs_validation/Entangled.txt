When youre asleep they may show you  
Aerial views of the ground  
Freudian slumber empty of sound  
  
Over the rooftops and houses  
Lost as it tries to be seen  
Fields of incentive covered with green  
  
Mesmerized children are playing  
Meant to be seen but not heard  
Stop me from dreaming  
Dont be absurd  
  
Well if we can help you we will  
Youre looking tired and ill  
As I count backwards  
Your eyes become heavier still  
Sleep wont you allow yourself fall  
Nothing can hurt you at all  
With your consent  
I can experiment further still  
  
Madrigal music is playing  
Voices can faintly be heard  
Please leave this patient undisturbed  
  
Sentenced to drift far away now  
Nothing is quite what it seems  
Sometimes entangled in your own dreams  
  
Well if we can help you we will  
Soon as youre tired and ill  
With your consent  
We can experiment further still  
  
Well thanks to our kindness and skill  
Youll have no trouble until  
You catch your breath  
And the nurse will present you the bill
