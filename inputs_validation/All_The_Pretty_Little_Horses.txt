Hushaby don you cry  
Go to sleepy little baby  
  
When you awake you shall have cake  
And all the pretty little horses  
Blacks and Bays Dapples and Grays  
Coach and a six a little horses  
  
So hushaby etc  
  
Way down yonda down in the medder  
Theres a poor little lambie  
Bees an the butterflies peckin out his eyes  
Poor lambie cried fo his mammy  
  
But hushaby etc
