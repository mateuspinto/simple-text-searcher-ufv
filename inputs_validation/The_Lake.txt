It is Sunday morning well right before dawn  
A little girl is dancing on the mansion porch  
She calls out a name God give him the sea  
Im here from the darkest deep  
And hear my name  
  
Down by the lake theres the shadow of grief  
Dancing hand in hand with the Devil  
  
Watching from the bridge the one near by the lake  
Why sister Margaret No need the hate  
Yes we all know light your seventh cross  
Oh please do it my dear  
While youre lost  
  
Down by the lake  
Dancing hand in hand  
  
And the nun has been seen  
I want your cross  
Now come and play  
Sister Margaret  
  
Follow pry the nun wont give in  
She catched us along  
Scared as Hell the little girl is screaming  
When sister Margaret disappeared in the lake  
  
Down by the lake theres the shadow of happiness  
Dancing hand in hand with the Devil
