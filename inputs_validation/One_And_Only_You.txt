It took one look  
And forever laid out in front of me  
One smile and I died  
Only to be revived by you  
  
There I was  
Thought I had everything figured out  
Goes to show just how much I know  
Bout the way life plays out  
  
Chorus  
I take one step away  
Then I find myself coming back to you  
My one and only one and only you Ooh  
  
Now I know  
That I know not a thing at all  
Except the fact that I am yours  
And that you are mine  
  
Ooh  
They told me that this wouldnt be easy  
And no  
Im not one to complain  
  
Chorusx2  
I take one step away  
When I find myself coming back to you  
My one and only one and only you Ooh
