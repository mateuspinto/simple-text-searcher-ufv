Youve done it all youve broken every code  
And pulled the Rebel to the floor  
You spoilt the game no matter what you say  
For only metal  what a bore  
Blue eyes blue eyes how come you tell so many lies  
  
Come up and see me make me smile  
Or do what you want run on wild  
Come up and see me make me smile  
Or do what you want run on wild

You gotta know how to pony  
Like Mony Baronie  
Mashed potato  
Do the alligator  
Put your hand on your hip  
Let your backbone slip  
Do the Watusi  
Like your Aunt Lucy  
  
Na na na na na

Put your hand on your hip  
Let your backbone slip  
Do the Watusi  
Like your Aunt Lucy

Jump back in that alley babe  
Put your hand on your hip  
Let your backbone slip
