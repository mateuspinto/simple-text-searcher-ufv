Mary sweet Mary your heart overflows  
Deep in the night child a babe is born  
Sacred and holy blameless and pure  
Mary sweet Mary tonight your child is born  
Mary sweet Mary so strong yet so frail  
Carried a baby sent to save the world  
Wise men still seek Him and find in Him  
Peace  
Mary sweet Mary tonight your King is born  
Bridge  
All of the angels danced as heaven sang  
All of the earth stood so still and so peacefully  
Mary sweet Mary Gods precious child  
Blessed redemption is found in His eyes  
All creatures great and small  
He came for all  
Mary sweet Mary tonight your Saviors born     
Mary sweet Mary tonight our Savior is born
