Melissa I knew I just had to kiss ya  
Heaven knows what I had in mind  
When my eyes went blind  
And you had to take me home  
Because I could not find my way  
  
Mimi you make my glasses steamy  
Heaven knows that Ill take a chance  
On a girl from france  
Just so long as we dont have to dance till dawn  
  
Maybe baby Im not so smart  
But I know Im not your brother  
And the way you affect me  
You neednt suspect me  
Of falling in love with another  
  
Daisy your old man thinks Im crazy  
Heaven knows I used to go insane  
When I heard your name  
I knew what I was doin  
When I had my brain removed  
  
Maybe baby Im not so smart  
I never claimed to be a thinker  
But you gotta respect me  
Cause the way you affect me  
Ill never have to be a drinker  
  
Bessie my dreams of you are messy  
Heaven knows I used to lie awake  
And try to make my heart stop pounding  
Long enough to take my rest
