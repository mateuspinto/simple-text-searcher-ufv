Believe it or not everyone have things that they hide  
Believe it or not everyone keep most things inside  
Believe it or not everyone believes in something above  
Believe it or not everyone needs to feel loved  
Feel loved  
But know that we wont until we figure out  
  
Could someone deliver us and send us some kind of sign  
So close to giving up cause faith is so hard to find  
You know that you wont until we figure out  
  
Ive seen it a lot every time the world turns upside down  
Believe it or not most of us feel like were losing ground  
Believe it or not everyone hates admitting fear  
Believe it or not most of us want to know why were here  
Why were here  
But we know that we wont until we figure out  
  
Could someone deliver us and send us some kind of sign  
So close to giving up cause faith is so hard to find  
Someone deliver us and send us some kind of sign  
So close to giving up cause faith is so hard to find  
But you dont and you wont until we figure out  
  
Most of us have nothing to complain about  
Most of us have things we could live without  
Everyone needs advice on how to get along  
You know we wont until we figure out  
  
Believe it or not everyone

Believe it or not everyone have things that they hide  
Believe it or not everyone keep most things inside  
Believe it or not everyone believes in something above  
Believe it or not everyone needs to feel loved  
Feel loved  
But you know we wont until we figure out
