Rolling down a backwoods Tennessee bighway  
One arm on the wheel  
Holding my lover with the other  
A sweet soft southern thrill  
Worked hard all week  
Got a little jingle  
On a Tennessee Saturday night  
Couldnt feel better  
Im together with my dixieland delight  
  
Spend my dollar  
Parked in a holler neath the mountain moonlight  
Holdin her up tight  
Make a little lovin  
A little turtle dovin on a Mason Dixon night  
Its my life  
Oh so right  
My dixieland delight  
  
Whitetail buck deer munchin on clover  
Redtailed hawk sitting on a limb  
Chubby ol groundhog  
Croakin bullfrog  
Free as a feeling in the wind  
Home grown country girl  
Gonna give me a whirl  
On a Tennessee Saturday night  
Lucky as a seven  
Livin in Heaven  
With my dixieland delight  
  
Spend my dollar  
Parked in a holler neath the mountain moonlight  
Holdin her up tight  
Make a little lovin  
A little turtle dovin on a Mason Dixon night  
Its my life  
Oh so right  
My dixieland delight  
  
Spend my dollar  
Parked in a holler neath the mountain moonlight  
Holdin her up tight  
Make a little lovin  
A little turtle dovin on a Mason Dixon night  
Its my life  
Oh so right  
My dixieland delight  
  
Rolling down a backwoods Tennessee bighway  
One arm on the wheel
