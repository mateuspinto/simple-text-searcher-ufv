If my heart is overwhelmed  
And I cannot hear your voice  
I hold on to what is true  
Though I cannot see  
  
If the storms of life they come  
And the road ahead gets steep  
I will lift these hands in faith  
I will believe  
  
Ill remind myself  
Of all that youve done  
And the life I have  
Because of your son  
  
Love came down and rescued me  
Love came down and set me free  
I am yours  
Lord Im forever yours  
Mountains high or valley low  
I sing out and remind my soul  
I am yours  
I am forever yours  
  
When my heart is filled with hope  
Every promise comes my way  
When I feel your hands of grace  
Rest upon me  
  
Staying desperate for you god  
Staying humble at your feet  
I will lift these hands in praise  
I will believe  
  
Ill remind myself  
Of all that youve done  
And the life I have  
Because of your son  
  
Love came down and rescued me  
Love came down and set me free  
I am yours  
I am forever yours  
Mountains high or valley low  
I sing out and remind my soul  
I am yours  
I am forever yours  
  
I am yours  
I am yours  
All my days  
Jesus I am yours  
  
I am yours  
I am yours  
All my days  
Jesus I am yours  
  
Love came down and rescued me  
Love came down and set me free  
I am yours  
I am forever yours  
Mountains high or valley low  
I sing out and remind my soul  
I am yours  
I am forever yours  
  
Love came down and rescued me  
Love came down and set me free  
I am yours  
I am forever yours  
Mountains high or valley low  
I sing out and remind my soul  
I am yours  
I am forever yours  
  
Yeah I am yours Im yours I am yours  
Jesus I am yours
