Oh baby its been so long  
Ive waited so long  
And now that I have you  
I want you to come come come  
  
Spirits move me every time Im near you  
Whirling like a cyclone in my mind  
Oh sweet Peter angel of my lifetime  
Answer to all answers I can find  
  
Baby I want you come come come into my arms  
Let me know the wonder of all of you  
Baby I want you no no no and hold on fast  
Could this be your magic at last  
  
Baby take me high upon a hillside  
High up where the stallion meets the sun  
I could love you build my world around you  
Never leave you till my life is done  
  
Baby I want you come come come into my arms  
Let me know the wonder of all of you  
Baby I want you no no no hold on fast  
Could it be your magic at last

Now come and hold on fast  
Could this be your magic at last  
Could it be magic  
  
Come come come into my arms  
Could this be your magic at last  
Could it be magic  
  
Come come come into my arms  
Let me know the wonder of all of you all of you  
Baby I want you now now oh now  
Oh come and hold on fast
