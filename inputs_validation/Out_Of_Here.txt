Hanging out and shooting out all of the lights  
I toss and toss its after dark  
Is this real or just a dream some fantasy  
And is this real or emptiness  
  
Were getting out of here  
As fast as we can  
Oh were getting out of here  
As fast as we can  
  
She still stand beside my parts and in this world  
Its getting sicker all the time  
Say that victim a victim made society  
Chop her ankle and bring it back to her family yeah  
  
Were getting out of here  
As fast as we can  
Oh were getting out of here  
As fast as we can  
  
Dusty highway  
Wait await and see  
West of passion  
Oh turn back to me  
Oh come back to me oh  
  
Nuclear alarmament disarmament  
We are going straight to hell  
Kill for problem kill for pride and kill for fun  
Democracy has just begun yeah  
  
Were getting out of here  
As fast as we can  
Oh were getting out of here  
As fast as we can  
  
Well never passes with open  
Pass through this way again  
The night is gladly or somewhat so it seems  
Is this real or just a dream Yeah  
  
Oh  
Oh
