Well All Right  
Petty Alison Holly Mauldin  
  
Well all right so Im being foolish  
Well all right let people know  
About the dreams and wishes you wish  
In the night when the lights are low  
  
Well all right well all right  
Well live and love with all our might  
Well all right well all right  
Our lifetime love will be all right  
  
Well all right so Im going steady  
Its all right when people say  
That those foolish kids cant be ready  
For the love that comes their way  
  
Well all right well all right  
Well live and love with all our might  
Well all right well all right  
Our lifetime love will be all right  
Repeat last verse
