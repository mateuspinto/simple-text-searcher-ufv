I see a rainbow in the sky  
So many colors and the light  
I see the world and I see all the people  
How theyre running all the time  
  
I see your shadow over me  
Then in my ears I hear a symphony  
I see the world and I see all the people  
What they are doing what they need  
  
They need a million and a billion  
And your money too  
They need a million and a billion  
And your money too  
  
I feel fine though I realize  
That I dont need the million  
They are all poor  
  
I feel fine though I have eyes  
To see my world and all it skits on ice  
  
I feel fine though I realize  
That I dont need the million  
They are all poor  
  
I feel fine though I have eyes  
To see my world and all it skits on ice
