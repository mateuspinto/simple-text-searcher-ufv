Hey  
I heard the dandelions roar in Piccadilly Circus  
I heard the dandelions roar in Piccadilly Circus  
Take a packet of seeds  
Take yourself out to play  
I want to see River of Orchids where we had a motorway  
  
Push your car from the road  
Push your car from the road  
  
Just like a mad dog youre chasing your tail in a circle  
Just like a mad dog youre chasing your tail in a circle  
Its all in your back yard  
Youve the whole world at your feet  
I said the grass is always greener when it bursts up through concrete  
  
Push your car from the road  
Push your car from the road  
  
River of Orchids winding our way  
Want to walk into London on my hands one day  
River of Orchids the road overgrows  
Want to walk into London smelling like a Peckham beggar rose  
  
Just like a mad dog youre chasing your tail in a circle  
Just like a mad dog youre chasing your tail in a circle  
Its all in your back yard  
Youve the whole world at your feet  
I said the grass is always greener when it bursts up through concrete  
  
I had a dream where the car is reduced to a fossil  
I had a dream where the car is reduced to a fossil  
Take a packet of seeds  
Get yourself out to play  
I want to see River of Orchids where we had a motorway  
  
Push your car  
Its all in your back yard  
Push your car  
Take a packet of seeds  
  
River of Orchids winding my way  
Want to walk into London on my hands one day  
River of Orchids the road overgrows  
Want to walk into London smelling like a Peckham rose  
River of Orchids  
I heard the Dandelions  
River of Orchids  
Just like a mad dog  
River of Orchids  
I had a dream  
River of Orchids  
I heard the Dandelions
