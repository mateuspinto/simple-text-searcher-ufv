I remember Johnny  hey  
Johnny come lately  
I remember her shoes like a ballerina  
A girl called Johnny who  
  
Changed her name when she  
Discovered her choice was to  
Change or to be changed  
I remember a girl called Johnny  
  
Black as hell and white as a ghost  
Dont talk about life or death  
She said Ive had enough of both  
A girl called Johnny who was not scared  
  
Theyd have torn her to pieces but  
Who would dare  
I remember a girl called Johnny  
The train came to town boy she got on it  
  
With no looking back with not a word  
If she said goodbye well I never heard  
But the noise goes on  
The noise the jazz  
  
And the truth is in somebody elses hands  
And the house that a girl called johnny built  
Is now just ashes and sand
