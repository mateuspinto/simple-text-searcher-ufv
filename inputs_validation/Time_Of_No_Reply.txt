Summer was gone and the heat died down  
And Autumn reached for her golden crown  
I looked behind as I heard a sigh  
But this was the time of no reply  
  
The sun went down and the crowd went home  
I was left by the roadside all alone  
I turned to speak as they went by  
But this was the time of no reply  
  
The time of no reply is calling me to stay  
There is no hello and no goodbye  
To leave there is no way  
  
The trees on the hill had nothing to say  
They would keep their dreams till another day  
So they stood and thought and wondered why  
For this was the time of no reply  
  
Time goes by from year to year  
And no one asks why I am standing here  
But I have my answer as I look to the sky  
This is the time of no reply  
  
The time of no reply is calling me to stay  
Theres no hello and no goodbye  
To leave there is no way  
  
Summer was gone and the heat died down  
And Autumn reached for her golden crown  
I looked behind as I heard a sigh  
But this was the time of no reply
