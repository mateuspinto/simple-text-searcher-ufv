In this everchanging world  
Where things become unfurled  
And tethered  
Like a lioness in her pride  
I was gonna stay by your side  
Forever  
  
As a planet keeps her moon  
Your love I had assumed  
And taken  
And if this love cant come to pass  
Then I would be alas  
Forsaken  
  
Chorus  
The drama of the chase  
The look upon your face  
Make up your mind  
It would be a waste  
If you didnt love me  
It would be the drama of all time  
  
If Im not good enough for you  
What else could I do  
I could change  
You know they say like wine  
You get better with passin time  
How strange   
I wish that in your eyes  
You saw me like the others  
See me  
I could never say enough  
Darlin just how much I  
Wish youd keep me  
  
Chorus  
Drama drama of all time  
Its been ten long years  
Since I fell in love so dear  
Its got to be the drama of all time  
Called you on the telephone  
And wondered if you were alone  
Its got to be the drama of all time  
When I called you back it was busy  
What was that  
Its a drama drama of all time  
Who were you with last night  
Busy busy you must be busier  
Than a onelegged man in a kick fight  
Got to be the drama of all time  
Drama drama of all time
