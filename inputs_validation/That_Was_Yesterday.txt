I thought I knew you well  
But all this time I could never tell  
I let you get away  
Haunts me every night and every day  
  
You were the only one  
The only friend I counted on  
How could I watch you walk away  
Id give anything to have you here today  
  
But now I stand alone with my pride  
And dream that youre still by my side  
  
But that was yesterday  
I had the world in my hands  
But its not the end of my world  
Just a slight change of plans  
That was yesterday  
But today life goes on  
No more hiding in yesterday  
Cause yesterdays gone ooooh  
  
Love my love I gave it all  
Thought I saw the light when I heard you call  
Life that we both could share  
Has deserted me left me in despair  
  
But now I stand alone with my pride  
Fighting back the tears I never let myself cry  
  
But that was yesterday  
Love was torn from my hands  
But its not the end of my world  
Just a little hard to understand  
That was yesterday  
But today life goes on  
You wont find me in yesterdays world  
Now yesterdays gone  
Goodbye yesterday  
Now its over and done  
Still I hope somewhere deep in your heart  
Yesterday will live on ooooh
