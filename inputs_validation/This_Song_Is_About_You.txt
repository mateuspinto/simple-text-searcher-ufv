This is my confessional  
Pen and paper Im gonna right this down  
Saying things you never thought  
That were on my mind  
Let the truth pour out  
Cause Im tired of the games  
I wont lie no Im not ok  
You were wrong youre to blame  
Now the world knows your name  
  
So here you go  
You finally get a song about you on the radio  
Are you happy now that you broke me down  
Now I curse the day that I met you  
I hope you know this song is about you  
This is no mistake yes I meant to  
I hope you know this song is about you about you  
  
This song is about you yeah  
Seem Im feeling better now  
I like the way our heads lifting off my chest  
Should have done months ago  
If I knew back ten it would feel like this  
Cause you done all the games  
I wont lie no Im not ok  
You were wrong youre the blame  
Now the world knows your name  
  
So here you go  
You finally get a song about you on the radio  
Are you happy now that you broke me down  
Now I curse the day that I met you  
I hope you know this song is about you  
This is no mistake yes I meant to  
I hope you know this song is about you about you  
  
When you hear this play  
I hope you feel the same way that I felt that day  
That you let me yeah you left me  
This is my confession  
This is my confessional  
Pen and paper round gonna right this down  
  
So here you go  
You finally get a song about you on the radio  
Are you happy now that you broke me down  
Now I curse the day that I met you  
I hope you know this song is about you  
This is no mistake yes I meant to  
I hope you know this song is about you about you  
About you about you about you  
This song is about you yeah  
This song is about you  
This song is about you oh
