Crimson flames tied through my ears  
Rollin high and mighty traps  
Pounced with fire on flaming roads  
Using ideas as my maps  
Well meet on edges soon said I  
Proud neath heated brow  
Ah but I was so much older then  
Im younger than that now  
  
Halfwracked prejudice leaped forth  
Rip down all hate I screamed  
Lies that life is black and white  
Spoke from my skull I dreamed  
Romantic facts of musketeers  
Foundationed deep somehow  
Ah but I was so much older then  
Im younger than that now  
  
In a soldiers stance I aimed my hand  
At the mongrel dogs who teach  
Fearing not that Id become my enemy  
In the instant that I preach  
My pathway led by confusion boats  
Mutiny from stern to bow  
Ah but I was so much older then  
Im younger than that now  
  
Yes my guard stood hard when abstract threats  
Too noble to neglect  
Deceived me into thinking  
I had something to protect  
Good and bad I define these terms  
Quite clear no doubt somehow  
Ah but I was so much older then  
Im younger than that now
