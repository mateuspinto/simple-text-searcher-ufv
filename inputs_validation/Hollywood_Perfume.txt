I went out on the balcony in the middle of the night  
The hotel was dark except for just one light  
Television burning in the other room  
I couldnt sleep so I put on some of your  
Hollywood perfume  
  
I went out on the balcony and looked across the way  
Some guy was shadow boxing he looked like sugar ray  
I was feeling dizzy  began to swoon  
Was it his punch or was it just your  
Hollywood perfume  
  
I feel like a fugitive escaped from my life  
Seeking refuge in the sensual heat  
These paperthin walls make me party to calls  
Of love wafting through the room  
The night jasmine bloom  
Of your Hollywood perfume  
  
I went out on the balcony to clear my head  
I was burning up in my queensized bed  
Down on the strip beneath the billboard moon  
Teenaged girls look for love in the  
Neon sex and doom  
Of your Hollywood perfume  
  
I went out on the balcony with your photograph  
I dropped it in the pool and that made me laugh  
You like your tan but you dont like to swim  
Meanwhile I feel like Im drowning in  
Neon sex and doom  
The night jasmine bloom  
Of your Hollywood perfume
