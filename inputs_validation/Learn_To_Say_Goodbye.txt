When I close my eyes I can see your face  
Tho I try I cant believe that you are gone  
Theres a part of you thats a part of me  
And no matter where I go it comes along  
Reminding me of all the good times  
And of course some of the bad  
But then again some of those hard times  
Were the best we ever had  
  
How can I learn to say goodbye  
To the only life I ever knew  
Learn to say goodbye to you  
How can I learn to say goodbye  
Tell me how do you expect me to  
Say goodbye to you  
  
When I needed you you were always there  
You were more than love to me you were a friend  
They say that time is all that matters  
And to live it while it lasts  
But I cant stop from reminiscing  
Or stop living in the past  
  
How can I learn to say goodbye  
To the only life I ever knew  
Learn to say goodbye to you  
How can I learn to say goodbye  
Tell me how do you expect me to  
Say goodbye to you  
  
How can I learn to say goodbye  
To the only life I ever knew  
Say goodbye to you  
How can I learn to say goodbye  
Tell me how do you expect me to  
Say goodbye to you
