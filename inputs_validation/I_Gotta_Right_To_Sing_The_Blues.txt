I gotta right to sing the blues I gotta right to feel lowdown  
I gotta right t hang around down around the river     
  
A certain gal in this ol town keeps draggin my poor heart around  
All I see for me is misery     
  
I gotta right to sing the blues I gotta right to moan and sigh  
I gotta right to sit and cry down around the river     
  
I kno the deep blue sea will soon be callin me  
It must be love say what you choose  
I gotta right to sing the blues doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo  
  
Hes gotta right to sing the blues I gotta right to sing the blues  
Hes gotta right to moan and sigh I gotta right t moan and sigh  
Hes gotta right to sit an cry sit an cryin down along the river  
  
I kno the deep blue sea will soon be callin me  
It must be love say what you choose  
I gotta right to sing the blues    the blues  
I gotta right the right tonight tonight  
I gotta right to sing the blues doo doo doo doo doo wah
