The paintings of Marjorie Minkin  
Have exploded into the world  
The dynamic influctuous paintings  
Always seem to fit perfectly  
Into that empty space on your wall  
The texture of a Minkin painting  
Is so vividly intransient  
That it seems to reach out  
Into the room and grab you  
The colors have been described as  
Quote More vibrant than any  
sunset Unquote  
Fellow artists are often amazed  
By Minkins work  
  
Sometimes the edge of a painting  
Will grab me  
Sometimes a corner  
And it will attempt to wrap me up  
Often succeeding  
And suffucate me  
And then spit me out  
  
Who would you say is the single  
Main influence of Minkins work  
  
The Ubiquitous Smokey  
  
Marjories paintings are influenced  
By her rautical philosphy of art  
  
Some would say art is from within  
You know a spiritual thing  
I dont buy that crap  
Not for a single second  
I would have to say  
Art is from without  
A painting is like life  
Not your life not my life  
In fact not life at all  
  
Who do you consider to be  
Your main influence  
  
That would definitely be  
Our family cat  
The Ubiquitous Smokey  
  
Minkins own mother  
Has been an encouraging supporting
