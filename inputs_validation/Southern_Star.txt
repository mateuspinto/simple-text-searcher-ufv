Oh southern star how I wish you would shine  
And show me the way to get home  
Well Im bluecollar branded and stuck in a mill  
Hard work is a way of life for me  
  
Well Im too young to live like Im over the hill  
And too old to be wild and free  
My heart is onward bound Im rolling with the feeling and I cant slow down  
I need a guiding light shining down to lead me through the night  
  
Oh southern star how I wish you would shine  
And show me the way to get home  
Oh hey my DJ friend would you play me one more song  
And let my mind just go and drift away  
  
Now we all have a dream and a place where we belong  
Somewhere we can go and escape  
My heart is onward bound Im rolling with the feeling and I cant slow down  
I need a guiding light shining down to lead me through the night  
  
Oh southern star how I wish you would shine  
And show me the way to get home  
Oh southern star how I wish you would shine  
And show me the way to get home
