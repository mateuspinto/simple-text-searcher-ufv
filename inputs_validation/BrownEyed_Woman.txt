Gone are the days when the ox fall down  
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around  
Gone are the days when the ladies said Please  
Gentle Jack Jones wont you come to me  
  
Chorus  
Browneyed women and red grenadine  
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean  
Sound of the thunder with the rain pouring down  
And it looks like the old mans getting on  
  
1929 when he stepped to the bar drank to the dregs of the whiskey jar  
1930 when the wall caved in he made his way selling redeyed gin  
  
Chorus  
  
Delilah Jones was the mother of twins  
Two times over and the rest were sins  
Raised eight boys only I turned bad  
Didnt get the lickins that the other ones had  
  
Chorus  
  
Tumble down shack in Big Foot county  
Snowed so hard that the roof caved in  
Delilah Jones went to meet her God  
And the old man never was the same again  
  
Daddy made whiskey and he made it well  
Cost two dollars and it burned like hell  
I cut hickory just to fire the still  
Drink down a bottle and be ready to kill  
  
Chorus  
  
Gone are the days when the ox fall down  
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around  
Gone are the days when the ladies said Please  
Gentle Jack Jones wont you come to me  
  
Browneyed women and red grenadine  
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean  
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin down
