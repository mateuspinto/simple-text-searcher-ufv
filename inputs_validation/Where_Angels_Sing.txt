This song was dedicated to Valeria M  
Meet me downtown on the corner  
Ill be waiting in a big yellow cab  
Dont bring a suitcase  
You wont need a thing  
Therell be no worries  
Where angels sing  
I got my ticket in my hand  
Oh the price is paid in full  
No man can stop me  
Their words wont sting you  
No dreams will haunt you  
Where angels sing  
I get so weary  
On this troubled road  
Unlock these chains  
And gently rock me home  
Beyond the clouds and the rain  
Where angels sing  
Where angels sing  
Where lies cant hurt you  
The flesh desert me  
No in or out  
No loss or doubt  
No living with or doing without  
Where money aint the power king  
And kindness is the most precious thing  
Where angels sing  
Oh where angels sing  
Where time means nothing  
No hustle  
No one rushing  
No dark of night  
No hate or spite  
No wrong or right  
No day or night  
No towns or no cities  
Theres no pain no pity  
Where hunger is no longer  
And a good man just gets stronger  
Where angels sing  
Where angels sing  
Where angels sing  
Where angels sing  
Where angels sing  
Where angels sing
