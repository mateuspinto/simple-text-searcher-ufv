I feel for you but when did you  
Believe you were alone  
You say that spiders crawled inside  
And made themselves a home  
Where light once was  
  
Petrified of who you are and  
Who you have become  
You will hide from everyone  
Denying you need someone  
To exterminate your bones  
  
Chorus  
Friend please remove your hands from  
Over your eyes for me  
I know you want to leave but  
Friend please dont take your life away from me  
End Chorus  
  
Living like a ghost you walk  
By everyone you know  
You say that youre fine but  
You have lost your sway a glow  
So I stopped by to let you know  
  
Chorus  
  
Would you let me know your plans tonight  
Cause I just wont let go till we both see the light  
And I have nothing else left to say  
But I will listen to you all day  
Yes I will  
  
Friend please remove your hands from  
Over your eyes for me  
I know you want to leave but  
Friend please dont take your life away from me
