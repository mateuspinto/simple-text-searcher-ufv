I am the head you are the heart  
I am the dead you are the start  
I am the wind you are the rain  
  
Will you beg for mercy will you kneel and pray  
What will make the nightmares go away judgement day  
Will you stop pretending everythings ok  
As you drag your bones another perfect day  
  
Go  
I am the dead you are the heart  
I am the dead you are the start  
I am the wind you are the rain  
Ive always sinned you feel the pain  
  
Will you take my sorrow  
Will you call my name  
Will you be tomorrow  
Know the pain  
  
Im your shadow curtain call I keep the hounds at bay  
The air you breath is what I choose today  
Right behind you catch your fall stumble left of light  
No pax Romana now forever night
