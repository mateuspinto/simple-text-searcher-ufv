You make me dizzy  
Running circles in my head  
One of these days Ill chase you down  
Well look whos going crazy now  
Were face to face my friend  
Better get out  
Better get out  
  
You know you make me breakout  
Make me breakout  
  
I dont wanna look like that  
I dont wanna look like that  
  
You know you make me breakout  
Make me breakout  
  
I dont wanna look like that  
I dont wanna look like that  
Know you make me breakout  
  
You can see this on my face  
Its all for you  
The more and more I take I break right through  
Therapy still scares me  
Putting me on my back again  
I may be crazy little frayed around the ends  
One of these days Ill phase you out  
  
Burn it in the blast off  
Burn it in the blast off  
Watch me crawl away  
Try to get out  
Try to get out  
  
You know you make me breakout  
Make me breakout  
  
I dont wanna look like that  
I dont wanna look like that  
  
You know you make me breakout  
Make me breakout  
  
I dont wanna look like that  
I dont wanna look like that  
I dont wanna look like that  
  
Breakout  
Go go go  
  
You know you make me breakout  
Make me breakout  
  
I dont wanna look like that  
I dont wanna look like that  
Know you make me breakout
