Doesnt it ever stay  
Must it always fade away  
Couldnt love ever be  
Something tangible and real  
Farewell fair weather friend  
Abandonment returns to taunt me again  
  
I only wanted you to stay  
Linger and mean the words you said  
Foolishly I romanticized  
Someone was saving my life  
For the first time  
I only wanted you to be there when I  
Opened up my eyes  
  
I was caught in your masquerade  
Wish Id stayed beneath my veil  
But it just seemed so easy to  
Open up myself to you  
Once more into the wind  
The embers scatter  
And the chill settles in  
  
I only wanted you to stay  
Linger and mean the words you said  
Foolishly I romanticized  
Someone was saving my life  
For the first time  
I only wanted you to be there when I  
Opened up my eyes  
  
Oh  
I only wanted you to stay  
Linger and mean the words you said  
Foolishly I romanticized  
Someone was saving my life  
For the first time  
I only wanted you to be  
The one to get me through that night  
  
I only wanted you  
To be there when I  
Opened up my eyes  
Oh  
Doesnt it ever stay  
I only wanted you to  
Stay
