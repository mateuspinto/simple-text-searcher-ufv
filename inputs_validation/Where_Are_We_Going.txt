Restraints were hoisted on at such an early age  
Straps were tightened in the class  
Scripts by the school sage  
Putting out the spark  
Left us in the dark  
  
Possibilities shut right down  
The cleaver of the uniform was handed down  
Treated like a clown  
  
Where are we going  
Where are we going  
What are we doing  
What are we doing  
Throwing it away like that  
What are you doing  
Throwing is away  
All that potential  
All that potential  
Trickling away like that  
  
We will refuse to be your clones or  
Work in someones scheme  
Let a person find themselves not be part  
Of a machine that worships power and wealth  
We need our sanity  
A day will come when everyone will have  
Their due respect  
Hate will no longer be a twisted form of love  
  
Where are we going  
What are we doing  
Throwing it away like that  
What are you doing  
All that potential  
Trickling away like that  
  
Tell me where are we going  
What are we doing  
Throwing it away like that  
What are you doing  
All that potential  
Trickling away like that
