Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
  
Sitting down on a country fence post  
Sitting down watchin trucks roll by  
Sitting down under the light of day now  
You know that I wont tell you no lies  
  
Ive been here for an hour or so  
And nothing much is going down  
I dont care much anyway  
Because you know Ive been around  
  
Here on the edge of the green fields growing  
And the sunlight warming all around  
And the blowing of the early mist in the morning  
You know that I dont hear a sound  
  
Till once in a while when a truck rolls by  
Carrying a overload  
I dont wanna go nowhere right now  
I feel like my future sold  
  
Stand on the good land children  
You know that it wont do you in  
I must have been here one time before  
But I wonder where the hell Ive been  
  
Early in the morning when the sun comes up  
And Im walkin all around the field  
Thinkin to myself about the city life scenes  
And man you know they aint for real  
  
All you got to do is stick your foot in your mouth  
And tell it where you want to go  
End up talkin to yourself some time  
Alone along a country road  
  
Stand on the good land children  
I feel like Im bound to stay  
And do the same this morning  
Like I went and did yesterday  
  
Stand on the good land children  
You know that it wont do you in  
I must have been here one time before  
But I wonder where the hell Ive been
