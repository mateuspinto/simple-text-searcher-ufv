When the grey skies turn to blue  
And the dark clouds blow away  
In the morning of a new life  
When the sun comes shining through  
When the grey skies turn to blue  
In the morning of a new life  
When the sun comes shining through  
When the grey skies turn to blue  
Meet me on a bright and windy day  
When the breeze has blown  
The gray skies far away  
High upon a hillside  
When the sun comes shining through  
And the grey skies turn to blue  
When the grey skies turn to blue  
When the grey skies turn to blue
