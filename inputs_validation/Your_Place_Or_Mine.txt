If you want the sun  
Then Ill be there to make it shine  
Wherever you are going  
  
I am the one  
Cant you see my arms are open wide  
Desire keeps on growing  
  
No need for questions  
I can see it in your eyes  
I only need one answer  
Where will you spend the night  
  
Is it gonna be  
Your place or mine  
Were gonna have a real good time my love  
Together we can make it  
Your place or mine  
My love is the lasting kind so you  
Better come and take it  
  
Do you feel the sun  
Do you feel what I am feelin now  
Were meant to be together  
  
You are the one  
With you I want to share my life  
From now until forever  
  
No need for questions  
I can see it in your eyes  
I only need one answer  
Where will we spend our lives  
  
Is it gonna be  
Your place or mine  
Were gonna have a real good time my love  
Together we can make it  
Your place or mine  
My love is the lasting kind so you  
Better come and take it  
  
Is it gonna be  
Your place or mine  
Were gonna have a real good time my love  
Together we can make it  
Your place or mine  
My love is the lasting kind so you  
Better come and take it
