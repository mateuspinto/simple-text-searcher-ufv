Mother take that ride  
You got in my mind  
Tell em what you found  
Write it down  
  
What you have is enough  
What you want with so much stuff  
What you need is a hug  
From a passenger you love  
One you love  
One you love  
One you love  
One you love  
  
Write a book  
Change your name  
Run a thousand miles away  
Bite the hook  
Change your game  
In the end its all the same  
Happy ever after  
Dancing with disaster  
Hold me close and listen to the song  
Why did we wait so long  
Oh why did we wait so long  
  
Once upon a cold and starless night  
Saw a vision or a trick of light  
We know theres nothing wrong  
Days are short nights are long  
Answer me this question then Im gone  
Oh why did we wait so long  
Oh why did we wait so long  
  
Oh why did we wait so long  
Oh why did we wait so long  
Oh why did we wait so long
