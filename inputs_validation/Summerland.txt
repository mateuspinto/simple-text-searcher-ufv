Lets just drive your car  
We could drive all day  
Lets just get the hell away from here  
  
For I am sick again  
Just plain sick to death  
Of the sound of my own voice  
We could leave behind  
Another wasted year  
Just get some cheap red wine  
  
And just go flying  
We could do the things  
All the things you wanted to  
No one cares about us anyway  
I think I lost my smile  
I think you lost yours too  
We have lost the power to make each other laugh  
  
Lets just leave this place  
And go to Summerland  
Just a name on the map  
Sounds like heaven to me  
  
We could find a town  
Be just how we want to be  
No one here really cares about us anyway  
We could find a place  
Make it what we want it to be  
No one really gives a fuck about us anyway  
We could live  
Live just like we want to live  
No one here really cares about us anyway  
We could be  
  
Everything we want to be  
We could get lost in the Fall  
Glimmer Sparkle and Fade  
The Sparkle and Fade  
Fall Glimmer Sparkle and Fade  
  
Forget about our jobs at the record store  
Forget about all the losers that we know  
Forget about all the memories that keep you down  
Forget about them  
  
We could lose them in the  
Sparkle and Fade  
We could leave them behind  
In the Sparkle and Fade  
Yeah Sparkle and Fade  
Fall Glimmer Sparkle and Fade
