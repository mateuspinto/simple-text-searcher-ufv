Bathe in another mans grave  
In time well follow  
Save all your thoughts for these days  
Dont steal just borrow  
Well a high wire is a dangerous game  
But a hard act to follow  
If I fly high like a moth to a flame  
Would your eyes be the size of sorrow  
Pain I can understand pain  
Sometimes you just swallow  
Say we can make it okay  
Dont steal just borrow  
Well the high wire is a dangerous game  
But a hard act to follow  
If I fly high like a moth to a flame  
Would your eyes be the size of sorrow  
Well the high wire is a dangerous game  
But a hard act to follow  
If I fly high like a moth to a flame  
Would your eyes be the size of sorrow  
High wire is a dangerous game  
But a hard act to follow  
If I fly high like a moth to a flame  
Would your eyes be the size of sorrow  
High wire high wire high wire  
Would your eyes be the size of sorrow  
High wire high wire high wire
