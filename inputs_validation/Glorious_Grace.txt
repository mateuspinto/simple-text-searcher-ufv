Let us praise the One who chose us  
Let us thank the One who knows us  
Set apart blameless in His sight  
Through the Son we have faith we have life  
To the praise of His glorious grace  
May the God of our Lord the Almighty Father  
Give you wisdom and peace His comforting spirit  
That you may know His hope  
You may know His riches  
And you may know His mighty strength  
To the praise of His glorious grace  
To the praise of His glorious grace  
Grace and peace to you through Jesus  
Our deliverer receives us  
Our hearts created for His word  
Our salvation was spoken and we heard  
To the praise of His glorious grace  
May the God of our Lord the Almighty Father  
Give you wisdom and peace His comforting spirit  
That you may know His hope  
But you may know His riches  
You may know His mighty strength  
To the praise of His glorious grace  
To the praise of His glorious grace  
Amen  
Amen  
Amen  
Amen
