Came to see him for  
You only might find  
Gone take my lay  
For you and I will find  
Fronting my face  
I cannot ever find  
Places I care for  
Nothing in my mind  
Bring me not far enough  
All lurking youll find  
Placing not far  
Youre every single mind  
So fine can only  
For you and me will find  
Basis all for me  
Can you leave my mind  
Bracing my fall  
My every single place  
Your love travelled far  
Some laying with my fates  
Place some never far  
Youre everything away  
You say Im a love  
And be mine every way  
  
Inside  
  
Under the sand  
Through the land  
Find all I can  
And form a clan  
That teaches to laugh  
Tears the past  
Laughs at the rest  
Teach the best  
Defeats the rest  
Forms the test  
We passed all the tests  
  
Evil in my mind
