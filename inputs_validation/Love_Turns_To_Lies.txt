I could have stood to watch you walk away  
And put it down to your uncertain ways  
Or maybe baby youve had a change of heart  
Maybe want to make a brand new start  
Crazy though what I say may seem  
I could have learned to mend these broken dreams  
You could have pushed I would have gently fell  
I could have played the graceful one so well  
Whats that you say  
You were gonna leave me anyway  
Any fool can see see what youve done to me  
When your love turns to lies  
The actor played the part of sweet desire  
And tiptoed out upon the highest wire  
The truth to tell upon a rope too thin  
And so the fall of treachery begins  
But oh to see the starlets smiling face  
So eagerly awaits to take the place  
I tried to fall in a clean and graceful way  
You could have said I would have given way  
And I see him smile the way that I smiled  
And I hear him laugh the way that I did  
But I hear him screaming and I hear him cry  
And I see him falling  
When your love turns to lies  
Whats that you say  
You were gonna leave me anyway  
Any fool can see see what youve done to me  
When your love turns to lies
