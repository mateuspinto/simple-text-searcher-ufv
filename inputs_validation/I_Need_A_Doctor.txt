In the morning  
Radio jingles  
Drive me mental  
Turning my blood into water yeah  
  
Hear the shallow   
Conversation  
From the station  
Sugar cube a generation yeah  
  
But aah would you take me home  
Aah  would you know what to do   
When we got there  
Aah  may I use your phone  
I need my mother  
  
So Educate me  
Radio ego  
I will follow  
But what will I find tomorrow well  
  
But aah would you take me home  
Aah to the little white hospital   
In my head  
Aah  may I use your phone  
I need my mother  
  
But aah would you take me home  
Aah would you know what to do   
When we got there  
Aah  may I use your phone  
I need a doctor
