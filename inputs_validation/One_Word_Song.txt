When Im feelin lonely  
And Im far away from home  
I just sing out your name  
Like a one word song  
  
In a moment of weakness  
When I need to be strong  
I just sing out your name  
Like a one word song  
  
And the thought of you  
Brings a soulful melody  
And passion and trust  
And a healing harmony  
  
When I count my blessings  
There is one that stands alone  
And I sing out your name  
Like a one word song  
  
And the thought of you  
Brings a soulful melody  
And passion and trust  
And a healing harmony  
  
And when I lose my way  
I get back where I belong  
When I sing out your name  
Like a one word song  
  
Yeah I sing out your name  
Like a one word song
