I see the people working  
And see it working for them  
And so I want to join in  
But then I find it hurts me  
  
Some say that knowledge is something sat in your lap  
Some say that knowledge is something that you never have  
  
I see the people happy  
So can it happen for me  
Cause when I am unhappy  
Theres nothing that can move me  
  
Some say that knowledge is something that you never have  
Some say that knowledge is something sat in your lap  
Some say that heaven is hell  
Some say that hell is heaven  
  
I must admit just when I think Im king  
I just begin  
Just when I think Im king I must admit  
I just begin  
Just when I think Im king  
I just begin  
  
Ive been doing it for years  
My goal is moving near  
It says Look Im over here  
Then it up and disappears  
  
Some say that knowledge is something sat in your lap  
Some say that knowledge is hohohoho  
  
I want to be a lawyer  
I want to be a scholar  
But I really cant be bothered  
Ooh just gimme it quick gimme it gimme gimme gimme gimme  
  
Some say that knowledge is ho ho ho  
Some say that knowledge is ho ho ho  
Some say that heaven is hell  
Some say that hell is heaven  
  
I must admit just when I think Im king  
I just begin  
Just when I think Im king I must admit  
I just begin  
Just when I think everythings going great  
I just begin  
Hey I get the break  
Hey Im gonna take it all  
I just begin  
When Im king  
 just begin  
  
In my dome of ivory  
A home of activity  
I want the answers quickly  
But I dont have no energy  
  
I hold a cup of wisdom  
But there is nothing within  
My cup she never overfloweth  
And tis I that moan and groaneth  
  
Some grey and white matter  
Give me the karma mama  
Im coming up the ladder  
A jet to Mecca  
Im coming up the ladder  
Tibet or Jeddah  
Up the ladder  
To Salisbury  
A monastery  
The longest journey  
Across the desert  
Across the weather  
Across the elements  
Across the water
