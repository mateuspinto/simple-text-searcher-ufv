Will you and your friend come around  
Are you and your friend gonna get on down  
Will you and your friend come around  
Or are you and your friend gonna let me down  
  
If you talk to one another  
Im a hungry man  
Let me know one way or the other  
So I can make my plans  
  
Will you and your friend come around  
Or are you and your friend gonna get on down  
Will you and your friend come around  
Or are you and your friend gonna get on down  
  
I relive the situation  
Still see it in my mind  
You got my imagination  
Working overtime
