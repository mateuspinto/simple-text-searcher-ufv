I can see you in the distance  
And youre heading for a fall  
Sinking deeper by the minute  
Youre about to lose it all  
  
You better change  
Before the sun goes down  
You better leave  
Before you are the last in town  
You better raise  
Your fortresses or tear them down  
  
Tear them down  
Tear them down  
Theres an angel on your shoulder  
And a devil at your feet  
And that door you see before you  
Could be poison tasting sweet  
You better change  
Before the sun goes down  
You better leave  
Before you are the last in town  
You better raise  
Your fortresses or tear them down  
  
Tear them down  
Tear them down  
I can see you in the distance  
And youre heading for a fall  
Sinking deeper by the minute  
Youre about to lose it all  
  
You better change  
Before the sun goes down  
You better leave  
Before you are the last in town  
You better raise  
Your fortresses or tear them down  
  
Tear them down  
You gotta tear them down  
Tear them down  
You better tear them down  
Tear them down
