Six lanes tail lights  
Red ants marchin into the night  
They disappear to the left and right again  
Another supper  
From a sack  
A ninety nine cent heart attack  
I got a poundin head and an achin back  
And the camels buried in a big straw stack  
  
Chorus  
Im gonna live where the green grass grows  
Watch my corn pop up in rows  
Every night be tucked in close to you  
Raise our kids where the good Lords blessed  
Point our rockin chairs towards the west  
And plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows  
Where the green grass grows  
  
Well Im from  
A map dot  
A stop sign on a blacktop  
I caught the first bus I could hop from there  
But all o this glitter is gettin dark  
Theres concrete glowin in the city park  
I dont know who my neighbors are  
And theres bars on the corner and bars on my heart  
  
Im gonna live where the green grass grows  
Watch my corn pop up in rows  
Every night be tucked in close to you  
Raise our kids where the good Lords blessed  
Point our rockin chairs towards the west  
And plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows  
Where the green grass grows  
  
Im gonna live where the green grass grows  
Watch my corn pop up in rows  
Every night be tucked in close to you  
Raise our kids where the good Lords blessed  
Point our rockin chairs towards the west  
And plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows  
Whoa where the green grass grows
