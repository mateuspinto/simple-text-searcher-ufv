She said my son I beg of you  
I have a wish that must come true  
The last thing you can do  
For mama  
  
Please promise me that you will stay  
And take my place while Im away  
And give the children love each day  
I had to cry what could I say  
  
How hard I tried to find the words  
I prayed she would not see me cry  
So much to say that should be heard  
But only time to say goodbye to mama  
  
They say in time that you will forget  
Yet still today my eyes are wet  
I tell myself to smile for Mama  
  
Now soon therell be another spring  
And I will start remembering  
The way she loved to hear us sing  
Her favourite song Ave Maria  
  
Ave Maria  
  
The children all have grown up now  
I kept my promise to mama  
I cannot guide them anymore  
Ive done my best all for mama  
  
Ave Maria  
  
Still this seems so very small  
For all  
She did for me
