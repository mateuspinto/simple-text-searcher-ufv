Do you see what I see  
Truth is an offense  
You silence for your confidence  
Do you hear what I hear  
Doors are slamming shut  
Limit your imagination keep you where they must  
Do you feel what I feel  
Bittering distress  
Who decides what you express  
Do you take what I take  
Endurance is the word  
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd  
  
Doesnt matter what you see  
Or intuit what you read  
You can do it your own way  
If its done just how I say  
  
Independence limited  
Freedom of choice  
Choice is mad for you my friend  
Freedom of speech  
Speech is words that they will bend  
Freedom with their exception  
  
Do you fear what I fear  
Living properly  
Truths to you are lies to me  
Do you choose what I choose  
More alternatives  
Energy derives from both the plus and negative  
Do you need what I need  
Boundaries overthrown  
Look inside to each his own  
Do you trust what I trust  
Me myself and I  
Penetrate the smoke screen I see through the selfish lie  
  
Doesnt matter what you see  
Or intuit what you read  
You can do it your own way  
If its done just how I say  
  
Independence limited  
Freedom of choice  
Choice is mad for you my friend  
Freedom of speech  
Speech is words that they will bend  
Freedom with their exception  
  
Do you know what I know  
Your money end your wealth  
Your silence just to hear your self  
Do you want what I want  
Desire not a thing  
I hunger after independence lengthen freedoms ring  
  
Doesnt matter what you see  
Or intuit what you read  
You can do it your own way  
If its done just how I say  
  
Independence limited  
Freedom of choice  
Choice is mad for you my friend  
Freedom of speech  
Speech is words that they will bend  
Freedom no longer frees you  
  
Doesnt matter what you see  
Or intuit what you read  
You can do it your own way  
If its done just how I say
