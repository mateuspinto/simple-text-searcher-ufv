Send me no wine  
To make an invitation  
Leave me no time  
In your imagination  
Only to find  
Words in your mind  
Theyre gonna make you leave your  
Leave your heart behind  
  
Send me send me no wine  
To send my love away  
Send me send me no wine  
To send my love away  
  
Once in my life  
I need no conversation  
All of my time  
Ill spend in fascination  
Give me my love  
With you in my life  
If only everybody  
Found the answer in love  
  
Send me send me no wine  
To send my love away  
Send me send me no wine  
To send my love away
