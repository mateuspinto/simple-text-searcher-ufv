The flag that I once planted as a king I abandoned  
And now I reclaim this banner by God my sword and my name  
In a truce sealed by blood within this metal skin and all that I own  
Blood bone and courage in my veins and the heart that pumps it  
  
Drink from the chalice and be reborn  
And the land with me it will change and transform  
  
A fighting man sworn to the quest it is the doom of man that they forget  
I have awoken the dragon and all around me the mist of his breath  
Good and evil there never is one without the other his brother  
Always there where I least expect it it will burn me to cinders  
  
The futures taken root in the present son  
Dont look into my heart least of all your own  
  
No man who is false can win in combat against the truth  
When he lies he murders some part of the world we must find what was lost  
Hearth and home wife and child were not for me I was not yet done  
I never knew how empty my soul was until it was refilled  
  
Mad distemper strikes both beggars and Kings  
The Necromancers hard teachings of war and quest  
  
I am given the right to bear arms and power to meet justice  
I have lived through others for far too long  
And carried my guilt my causes my sins  
I hope in the hereafter when I owe no more to the future  
That I can be just a man
