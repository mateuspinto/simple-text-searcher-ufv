Busted flat in Baton Rouge headin for the trains  
Feelin nearly faded as my jeans  
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained  
Took us all the way to New Orleans  
Took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana  
And was blowin sad while Bobby sang the blues  
With them windshield wipers slappin time and  
Bobby clappin hands we finally sang up every song  
That driver knew  
  
Freedoms just another word for nothin left to lose  
And nothin aint worth nothin but its free  
Feelin good was easy Lord when Bobby sang the blues  
And buddy that was good enough for me  
Good enough for me and my Bobby Mcgee  
  
From the coalmines of Kentucky to the California sun  
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul  
Standin right beside me through everythin I done  
And every night she kept me from the cold  
Then somewhere near Salinas Lord I let her slip away  
She was lookin for the home I hope shell find  
Well Id trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday  
Holdin Bobbys body close to mine  
  
Freedoms just another word for nothin left to lose  
And nothin left was all she left to me  
Feelin good was easy Lord when Bobby sang the blues  
And buddy that was good enough for me  
Good enough for me and Bobby Mcgee
