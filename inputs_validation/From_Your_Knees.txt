He tore down the work of 17 years brick by brick  
And stone by stone  
No hammer was swingin cause cheatin and drinkin  
Dont need no help wreckin a home  
Ah but when he came back through the dust and the rubble  
Of what he had once called his life  
He dropped to his knees in sheer disbelief of the total destruction inside  
  
There were empty closets and empty drawers  
And a tear stained note on the kitchen floor  
And burning memories in the fireplace  
He waited too late to say he was wrong  
His house was still standing but his home was gone  
Brother you would not believe  
What you can see from your knees  
  
Right then and there in an old sinners prayer  
He told things hed kept in the dark  
There was no use in lying cause the man who was listening  
Could see every room in his heart  
Ah he took empty whisky bottles little black book and all  
To the fire she left on the grate  
Ah sometimes a man will change on his own  
But sometimes I tell you it takes  
  
Empty closets and empty drawers  
And a tear stained note on the kitchen floor  
And burning memories in the fireplace  
He waited to late to say he was wrong  
His house was still standing hed fight for his home  
Brother you would not believe oh you would not believe  
What you can see from your knees
