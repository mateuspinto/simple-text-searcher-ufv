Country music singers have always been a real close family  
But lately some of my kinfolks have disowned a few others and me  
I guess its because I kind of changed my direction  
Lord I guess I went and broke their family tradition  
  
They get on me and want to know Hank why do you drink  
Hank why do you roll smoke  
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote  
Over and over everybody makes my predictions  
So if I get stoned Im just carrying on an old family tradition  
  
I am very proud of my daddys name  
All though his kind of music and mine aint exactly the same  
Stop and think it over Put yourself in my position  
If I get stoned and sing all night long its a family tradition  
  
So dont ask me Hank why do you drink  
Hank why do you roll smoke  
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote  
If Im down in a honkytonk some ole slicks trying to give me friction  
I said leave me alone Im singing all night long its a family tradition  
  
Lord I have loved some ladies and I have loved Jim Beam  
And they both tried to kill me in 1973  
When that doctor asked me son how did you get in this condition  
I said hey sawbones Im just carrying on an ole family tradition  
  
So dont ask me Hank why do you drink  
Hank why do roll smoke  
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote  
Stop and think it over try and put yourself in my unique position  
If I get stoned and sing all night long its a family tradition
