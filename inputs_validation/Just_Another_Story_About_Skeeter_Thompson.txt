So we were in Amsterdam  
And we were staying at this guy  
Tosss house  
Good friend of ours  
Uhh  
Its kinda in the middle of the city  
We were just finished with our  
Second European tour  
And everything was going pretty good  
Skeeter he met this girl that lived  
Next door to Tosss  
And within a couple of weeks he started  
Living with her you know  
And I guess she had a lot of money or something  
Cause she was constantly buying him clothes  
And getting him lots of stuff and loading him  
With money you know  
He was constantly going to the coffee shop  
Always getting the best herb and the best  
Hash you know  
He was in good shape  
She was really good looking she was  
Really cool  
I I dont think hed ever met her before  
But she had you know other boyfriends I suppose  
So Im sitting on the couch you know in  
Tosss apartment  
And Im reading you know maximum rock and  
Roll or flip side  
One of those punk things  
And I heard Skeeter come in  
And he came in and he had all these really  
Nice clothes on  
She bought him all this stuff  
She like bought him cologne  
He was really really smelling good you know  
He looked good too  
You know he came in and put his herb  
On the table and whatever  
Im just reading my little punk magazine  
Not really paying attention  
And then he says uh he says hey dave  
And I look up  
And hes standing there with his dick  
In his hand  
And hes kinda got it like lifted up so  
Hes looking at the head of his dick  
He kinda pointed it at me  
I didnt know what to think  
He said does that look like pus to you  
I said no I think its lint
