Midnight our sons and daughters  
Cut down taken from us  
Hear their heartbeat  
We hear their heartbeat  
  
In the wind we hear their laughter  
In the rain we see their tears  
Hear their heartbeat  
We hear their heartbeat  
  
Night hangs like a prisoner  
Stretched over black and blue  
Hear their heartbeat  
We hear their heartbeat  
  
In the trees our sons stand naked  
Through the walls our daughters cry  
See their tears in the rainfall
