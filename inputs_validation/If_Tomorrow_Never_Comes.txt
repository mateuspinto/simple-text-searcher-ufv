Sometimes late at night  
I lie awake and watch her sleeping  
Shes lost in peaceful dreams  
So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark  
And the thought crosses my mind  
If I never wake up in the morning  
Would she ever doubt the way I feel  
About her in my heart  
If tomorrow never comes  
Will she know how much I loved her  
Did I try in every way  
To show her every day  
That shes my only one  
If my time on earth were through  
And she must face the world without me  
Is the love I gave her in the past  
Gonna be enough to last  
If tomorrow never comes  
Cause Ive lost loved ones in my life  
Who never knew how much I loved them  
Now I live with the regret  
That my true feelings for them never were revealed  
So I made a promise to myself  
To say each day how much she means to me  
And avoid that circumstance  
Where theres no second chance  
To tell her how I feel  
If tomorrow never comes  
Will she know how much I loved her  
Did I try in every way  
To show her every day  
That shes my only one  
If my time on earth were through  
And she must face the world without me  
Is the love I gave her in the past  
Gonna be enough to last  
If tomorrow never comes  
So tell that someone that you love  
Just what youre thinking of  
If tomorrow never comes
