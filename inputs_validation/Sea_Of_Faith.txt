Say sayonara darling  
This time goodbye  
No bon voyage  
Its time to fly  
I can see the breakdown coming  
Like a twisted wreck  
Lets save ourselves the sorrow  
Before we hit the deck  
  
From the high plains  
To the border  
All across the land  
From the flying of the flag  
To lovers kissing hands  
  
You can cover me in roses  
Put nickles on my eyes  
There be no tomorrows  
No more goodbyes  
Sea of faith  
Where did she go  
Little diamonds  
How you shine and glow  
Looking at the future I dont know  
I am just here to watch the river flow  
  
A street full of whispers  
Rings like a chinese gong  
A room full of would bes  
Whose lives have gone wrong  
  
The blues dont exist now  
Just to cleanse your soul  
They were made to wake you up  
Not to dig a hole  
  
You can cover me in roses  
Put nickles on my eyes  
There be no tomorrows  
No more goodbyes  
Sea of faith  
Where did she go  
Little diamonds  
How you shine and glow  
Looking at the future I dont know  
I am just here to watch the river flow  
  
Solo  
  
Say sayonara darling  
This time goodbye  
No bon voyage  
Its time to fly  
I can see the breakdown coming  
Like a twisted wreck  
Lets save ourselves the sorrow  
Before we hit the deck  
  
Its something of a tragedy  
It would make you weep  
When you kiss your love goodnight  
Now I see why lovers leap  
You can cover me in roses  
Put nickles on my eyes  
There be no tomorrows  
No more goodbyes  
Sea of faith  
Where did she go  
Little diamonds  
How you shine and glow  
Looking at the future  
I dont know  
I am just here to watch  
The river flow  
  
Little diamonds  
How you shine and glow  
Looking at the future  
I dont know  
I am just here to watch  
The river flow  
  
Little diamonds  
How you shine and glow
