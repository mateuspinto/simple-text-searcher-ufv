Ha ha ha ha  
  
Everybody here in this small town  
Looks used and abused at bay  
Everybody heres looking outside in  
Seems like nothing ever changes  
  
Everybody they just want to have a good time  
Everybody they just want to forget  
Everybody wants to feel like they did  
When the sky looked blue  
And the world was perfect  
  
I dont care  
I just want to die pretty  
I just want to get lost in the motion  
I just want to get lost in my beautiful self  
I just want to get lost in the city  
I dont want to live forever  
I just want to die a beautiful death  
  
Ha ha ha ha  
  
Ugh  
Yeah I got to get the hell out of this town  
Everybodys looking upsidedown  
Everybody here is looking for the same thing  
When it seems like nothing ever changes  
Everybody they just want to find a slow ride  
Everybody they just want to get by  
  
Everybody wants to feel like they did  
When the sky looked high  
And the world was simple  
  
I dont care  
I just want to die pretty  
I just want to get lost in the motion  
I just want to get lost in my beautiful self  
I just want to get lost in the city  
I dont want to live forever  
I want to die a beautiful death  
  
I want to die a beautiful death  
I just want to die a beautiful death  
I just want to die a beautiful death  
I just want to die pretty  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
I just want to die pretty  
Oh oh  
I just want to die pretty  
Oh oh  
Sometimes I just want to die  
  
I just want to get lost in the moment  
I just want to get lost inside the city tonight  
I just want to get lost inside myself  
I dont care about nothing  
  
I just want to get lost in the motion  
I just want to get lost in my beautiful self  
I just want to get lost in the city  
I dont want to live forever  
I want to die a beautiful death  
  
I want to die a beautiful death  
Yes I want to die a beautiful death  
I just want to die a beautiful death  
I just want to die pretty  
  
Oh yeah
