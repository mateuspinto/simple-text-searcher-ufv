I got fat knees  
From crawlin so fast  
I got sore lips  
From kissin your ass  
I know I dont want  
Anymore part of you  
I got brain pain  
You make me so mad  
I got black eyes  
From fightin your dad  
I know I dont want  
Anymore part of you  
Get out get out  
Get out and walk  
Stop blowing kisses  
Across the hall  
Dont write me letters  
And please dont call  
Gimme me a break  
Get out and walk  
I got slipped discs  
With you on my back  
I got ulcers  
From swallowing crap  
I know I dont want  
Anymore part of you  
Get out get out  
Get out and walk  
Stop blowing kisses  
Across the hall  
Dont write me letters  
And please dont call  
Gimme me a break  
Get out and walk  
Get out get out  
Get out and walk  
Stop blowing kisses  
Across the hall  
Dont write me letters  
And please dont call  
Gimme me a break  
Get out and walk
