They passed me by all of those great romances  
You were I felt robbing me of my rightful chances  
My picture clear everything seemed so easy  
And so I dealt you the blow  
One of us had to go  
Now its different I want you to know  
  
One of us is crying  
One of us is lying  
In her lonely bed  
Staring at the ceiling  
Wishing she was somewhere else instead  
One of us is lonely  
One of us is only  
Waiting for a call  
Sorry for herself feeling stupid feeling small  
Wishing she had never left at all  
  
I saw myself as a concealed attraction  
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action  
Just like a child stubborn and misconceiving  
Thats how I started the show  
One of us had to go  
Now Ive changed and I want you to know  
  
One of us is crying  
One of us is lying  
In her lonely bed  
Staring at the ceiling  
Wishing she was somewhere else instead  
One of us is lonely  
One of us is only  
Waiting for a call  
Sorry for herself feeling stupid feeling small  
Wishing she had never left at all  
Never left at all  
  
Staring at the ceiling  
Wishing she was somewhere else instead  
One of us is lonely  
One of us is only  
Waiting for a call
