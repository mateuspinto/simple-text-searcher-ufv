Holding on to you like broken glass  
Every touch cuts deeper than the last  
I know I should leave  
But it feels so good to bleed  
  
Poison kisses lock us in this cage  
Our lives got twisted in this masquerade  
I cant seem to shake this incurable need  
This endless addiction I feed  
  
Angels on fire  
They fall from the sky  
Heaven and hell will be burning tonight  
Covered in ashes I cry out your name  
And out of the flames  
We will rise again  
  
Run in to the shadows where we hide  
Bodies tender as our worlds collide  
Nothing is sacred and everythings wrong  
But you and I keep holding on  
  
Angels on fire  
They fall from the sky  
Heaven and hell will be burning tonight  
Covered in ashes I cry out your name  
And out of the flames  
We will rise again  
  
No temptation is my sin  
Not my darkest deepest whim  
  
Angels on fire  
They fall from the sky  
Heaven and hell will be burning tonight  
Covered in ashes I cry out your name  
And out of the flames  
We will rise  
Angels on fire  
They fall from the sky  
Heaven and hell will be burning tonight  
Covered in ashes I cry out your name  
And out of the flames  
We will rise again  
We will rise again  
We will rise
