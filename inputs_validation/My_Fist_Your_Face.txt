Wake up baby what you in for  
Start the day upon your knees  
What you pissin in the wind for  
You musta snorted too much bleas  
East house pinball wizard  
Full tilt bozo plague  
Second floor trekkie  
Makin warp speed out the door  
Julio Afrokeluchie  
He the only one who stayed  
Countin up the days  
  
Please no more  
My fist your face  
Thats for sure  
  
Hey Betty Boop you got me droolin  
Im buzzing round your hive tonight  
You play the hooky stead of schoolin  
Son of a bitch put out the light  
Thirteen year old hookers  
Take a sack right trough the bars  
You wonder why the mans outside the door  
Junior achivers got the old bull by the horns  
  
Back in the saddle gets you sore  
My fist your face  
Thats for sure  
East house pinball wizard  
Full tilt bozo plague  
Second floor trekkie  
Makin warp speed out the door  
Julio Afrokeluchie  
He the only one who stayed  
Countin up the days  
  
Please no more  
My fist your face  
Thats for sure  
  
Please no more  
My fist your face  
Thats for sure
