Carry on my wayward son  
For therell be peace when you are done  
Lay your weary head to rest  
Dont you cry no more  
  
Once I rose above the noise and confusion  
Just to get a glimpse beyond the illusion  
I was soaring ever higher but I flew too high  
Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man  
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man  
I hear the voices when Im dreamin I can hear them say  
  
Carry on my wayward son  
For therell be peace when you are done  
Lay your weary head to rest  
Dont you cry no more  
  
Masquerading as a man with a reason  
My charade is the event of the season  
And if I claim to be a wise man it surely means that I dont know  
On a stormy sea of moving emotion  
Tossed about Im like a ship on the ocean  
I set a course for winds of fortune but I hear the voices say  
  
Carry on my wayward son  
For therell be peace when you are done  
Lay your weary head to rest  
Dont you cry no more  
  
Carry on you will always remember  
Carry on nothing equals the splendor  
Now your lifes no longer empty  
Surely heaven waits for you  
  
Carry on my wayward son  
For therell be peace when you are done  
Lay your weary head to rest  
Dont you cry no more
