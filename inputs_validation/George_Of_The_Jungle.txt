George George George of the jungle  
Strong as he can be  
Ahhh  
Watch out for that tree  
  
George George George of the jungle  
Lives a life thats free  
Ahhh  
Watch out for that tree  
  
When he gets in scrapes  
When he makes his escapes  
With the help of his friend  
An ape named Ape  
  
Then away hell schlep  
On his elephant Shep  
While Fella and Ursula  
Stay in step with  
  
George George George of the jungle  
Friend to you and me  
Ahhh  
Watch out for that tree  
Watch out for that Ahhh Oooh tree  
George George George of the Jungle  
Friend to you and me
