Nothing can be permanent  
Nothing set in stone  
Never try to fool yourself  
That you are not alone  
Know your place dont chance your arm  
Your secrets are all known  
Never cross the great divide  
Each to his own  
Dont misunderstand me dont be hurt dont take offence  
But what I am about to tell you makes a lot of sense  
Ive been more than happy with you loved you as you are  
But being happy only takes a restless heart so far  
Be thankful for the past but know those times wont come again  
I found you quite diverting even tender now and then  
Remember I will always be the first to sing your praise  
But I must close the book on our adolescent days  
Nothing can be permanent  
Nothing set in stone  
Never try to fool yourself  
That you are not alone  
Know your place dont chance your arm  
Your secrets are all known  
Never cross the great divide  
Each to his own  
Did you really think wed never drift apart  
That wed decay together in some endless heart to heart  
Did you never realise that we are not the same  
We are made what we are made  you are not to blame  
Nothing can be permanent  
Nothing set in stone  
Never try to fool yourself  
That you are not alone  
Know your place dont chance your arm  
Your secrets are all known  
Never cross the great divide  
Each to his own
