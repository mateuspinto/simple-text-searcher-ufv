How great the wonder of the heaven  
And the timeless beauty of the night  
How great then how great  
The Creator  
  
And its stars like priceless jewels  
Far beyond the reach of kings  
Bow down for the shepherd  
Guiding him home  
  
But how many eyes are closed  
To the wonder of this night  
Like pearls hidden deep  
Beneath the dark stream of desires  
  
But like dreams vanished with the call to prayer  
And the dawn extinguishes night  
Here too are signs  
God is the Light God is the Light  
  
How great the beauty of the earth  
And the creatures who dwell on her  
How great then how great  
The Creator  
  
As its mountains pierce the clouds  
High above the lives of man  
Weeping rivers  
For thousands of years  
  
But how may hearts are closed  
To the wonders of this sight  
Like birds in a cage  
Asleep with closed wings  
  
But like works stops with the call to prayer  
And the birds recite  
Here too are signs  
God is the Light God is the Light  
  
How great the works of man  
And the things he makes  
How great then how great  
The Creator  
  
Though he strives to reach the heavens  
He can barely survive  
The wars of the world  
He lives in  
  
Yet how many times hes tried  
Himself to immortalize  
Like his parents before him  
In the garden of Eden  
  
But like the sun sets with the call to prayer  
And surrenders to the night  
Here to are signs  
God is the Light Everlasting  
God is the Light Everlasting  
God is the Light Everlasting
