Old red wine well past its prime  
May have to finish it after crossing the line  
Dusty old wine two thousand a time  
An inch of black mud always left behind  
They say you turned in while the sun still shined  
That gorgeous girl with you was highly primed  
She said shed take you way down or way up  
She might break your heart she might crack you up  
Old red wine not worth a dime  
Gonna have to drink it with you some other time  
Expensive old wine forty years lying  
Mice chewed the labels dont know what were buying  
Back home in California they got wine for the meek  
Theres a Bowl and a Fillmore the Cow and the Greek  
You sniffed at the cork chose low on the list  
As you dashed to the lights and gazed through the mist  
Old red wine well past its prime  
Gonna have to drink it with you some other time  
Just let it breathe  
Oh let it breathe  
Breathe life breathe life  
Let it breathe  
Oh let it breathe  
Let it breathe
