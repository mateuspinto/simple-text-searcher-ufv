Its not important for you to know my name   
Nor I to know yours  
If we communicate for two minutes only  
It will be enough  
For knowing that someone in this world  
Feels as desperate as me   
And what you give is what you get  
  
It doesnt matter if we never meet again  
What we have said will always remain  
If we get through for two minutes only  
It will be a start  
For knowing that someone in this life  
Loves with a passion called hate  
And what you give is what you get  
  
If I never ever see you   
If I never ever see you   
If I never ever see you  again  
  
And what you give is what you get
