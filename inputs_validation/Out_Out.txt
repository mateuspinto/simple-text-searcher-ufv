Had enough of this  
Out Out Out Out  
I seen a crazy dog crazy dog  
In the flowers in the wood crazy dog  
Ive seen a crazy dog crazy dog  
Crash through flowers in the big wood  
Do not know why it is that everywhere I go  
Im seeing tall trees tall trees  
They cover me  
All around me  
As theyre standing up all around me  
With their big leaves small leaves  
They cover me  
Ive had enough  
I want out out out out  
  
Gotta do something cant do nothing  
Cause I know these people they dont know me at all  
I want to hold you in my arms  
I want out I want out out out  
I want out I want out out out  
  
When Im home I look around me in a room  
I see the white walls stone walls so solid  
And in the lonely night watch the disappearing light  
On white walls stone walls swear theyre moving in  
  
Gotta do something cant do nothing  
Cause I know these people they dont know me at all  
I want to hold you in my arms again  
I want to hold you in my arms  
I want out I want out out out  
I want out I want out out out  
Out out out Hey Hey Hey out out  
Out out out Ho Ho Ho Ho  
  
Come out of the night  
I want out I want out  
Come out of the shadow  
Out of fear out of fear and pain  
Into the warming sun  
Into the warming sun  
I will be with you again will be with you  
Out of the shadow out of fear and pain  
I will be I will be I will be I will be  
I will be with you again  
Out Out out out  
Drain away the blood out of darkness  
Out of shadow out of the night  
Out of all the pain Im going  
Ho Ho Ho Ho out out  
Out Out out out out Hey Hey
