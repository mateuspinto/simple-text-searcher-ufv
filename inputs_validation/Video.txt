Video eo eo eo eo eo eo  
The satellites that search the night they twinkle like a star  
They send their love from up above down to my vtr  
The world is at my fingers under control  
  
Ahhhumm video eo eo uh ho  
Play it one more time  
Video eh oh got the world on my tv  
  
I see that rock and roll and all those old time movies  
They beam across the sky together in electric dreams  
I just sit here on my end Ill have it all  
  
Ahhhumm video eo eo uh ho  
Play it one more time  
Video eh oh got the world on video  
  
I see the shadows in the twilight as they dance la la la  
Video madness comes upon me like a trance in the dark  
So I just stay right here and the world is okay okay okay  
  
Ahhhumm video eo eo uh ho  
Play it one more time  
Video eh oh got the world on video oh oh oh oh oh  
  
And look at me now Im burning up the steely wires  
Look at me now Im burning up the steely wires  
Look at me now now now now now
