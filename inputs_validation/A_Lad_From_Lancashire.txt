No matter where I go London Paris Mexico  
Anywhere on Earth they know my place of birth  
I met a girl from London when she sat on Blackpool Pier  
She said she could tell Im a Lad from Lancashire  
She said Are you a nudist So I blushed and said No fear  
Im covered up like a Lad from Lancashire  
  
North or South when I open my mouth they know that Im not Dutch  
They can tell I come from Lancashire but they cant tell me much  
I whispered Ill be nudist if youll be the same my dear  
She said No fear with a Lad from Lancashire  
A widow nice and young and gay said Come to tea my dear  
Ive something nice for a Lad from Lancashire  
We sat down on the sofa and I felt her creeping near  
I said Hee Hee take care Im a Lad from Lancashire  
  
North and South when I open my mouth they know that Im not Dutch  
They can tell I come from Lancashire but they cant tell me much  
The widow started kissing me and tickling my ear  
I tickled her like a Lad from Lancashire  
I went with Jane down Lovers Lane she whispered in her ear  
Now do your best for a Lad from Lancashire  
She said to me when on my knee You cant do that there ere  
I said Hey Hey I can Im the Lad from Lancashire  
  
North and South when I open my mouth they know that Im not Dutch  
They can tell I come from Lancashire but they cant tell me much  
That night when Jane got home again her Ma said You look queer  
Ill bet thas been with that Lad from Lancashire
