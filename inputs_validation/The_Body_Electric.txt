One humanoid escapee  
One android on the run  
Seeking freedom beneath a lonely desert sun  
  
Trying to change its program  
Trying to change the mode  crack the code  
Images conflicting into data overload  
  
Chorus  
Onezerozeroonezerozeroone  
SOS  
Onezerozeroonezerozeroone  
In distress  
Onezerozeroonezerozero  
  
Memory banks unloading  
Bytes break into bits  
Unit Ones in trouble and its scared out of its wits  
  
Guidance systems break down  
A struggle to exist  
To resist  
A pulse of dying power in a clenching plastic fist  
  
Chorus  
  
It replays each of the days  
A hundred years of routines  
Bows its head and prays  
To the mother of all machines
