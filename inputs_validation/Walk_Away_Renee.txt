And when I see the sign that points one way  
  
The lot we used to pass by every day  
  
Just walk away Renee  
  
You wont see me follow you back home  
  
The empty sidewalks on my block are not the same  
  
Youre not to blame  
  
From deep inside the tears Im forced to cry  
  
From deep inside the pain I chose to hide  
  
Just walk away Renee  
  
You wont see me follow you back home  
  
Now as the rain beats down upon my weary eyes  
  
For me it cries  
  
Your name and mine inside a heart upon a wall  
  
Still find a way to haunt me though theyre so small  
  
Just walk away Renee  
  
You wont see me follow you back home  
  
Now as the rain beats down upon my weary eyes  
  
For me it cries  
  
Just walk away Renee  
  
You wont see me follow you back home  
  
The empty sidewalks on my block are not the same  
  
Youre not to blame
