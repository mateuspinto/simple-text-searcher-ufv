Spoken  
I was born and raised down in Alabama  
On a farm way back up in the woods  
I was so ragged that folks used to call me Patches  
Papa used to tease me about it  
Of course deep down inside he was hurt  
Cause he done all he could  
  
Sang  
Papa was a great old man  
I can see him with a shovel in his hand  
See education he never had  
He did wonders when the time got bad  
The little money from the crops he raised  
Barely paid the bills he made  
So life had kicked him down to the ground  
When he tried to get up  
Life would kick him back down  
One day papa called me to his dyin bed  
Put his hands on my shoulders  
Then with a tears he said  
Patches Im depending on you son  
To pull the family through  
My son its all left up to you  
  
Spoken  
Two days later papa passed away  
And I became a man that day  
So I told mama I was gonna quit school  
She said that was daddys strictest rule  
  
Sang  
So every morning fore I went to school  
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too  
Sometimes I felt that I couldnt go on  
I wanted to leave just run away from home  
But I always remembered what my daddy said  
With tears in his eyes on his dyin bed  
He said Patches Im depending on you son  
To pull the family through  
My son its all left up to you  
  
Spoken  
Then one day a strong rain came  
And washed all the crops away  
And at the age of thirteen I thought I was carrying  
The weight of the whole world on my shoulders  
But you know mama she knew what I was going through  
  
Sang  
Everyday I had to work the fields  
Cause thats the only way we got our meals  
You see I was the oldest of a family  
And everybody else depended on me  
Every night I heard my mama pray  
Lord give him the strength to make another day  
Though years have passed and all the kids are grown  
And amgels took my mama to a brand new home  
Lord knows people that I shed a tear  
My daddys voice kept atinging in my ears  
Sayin Patches Im depending on you son  
To pull the family through  
My son its all left up to you  
  
Patches Im depending on you son  
Im depending on you son  
To pull the family through  
My son its all left up to you
