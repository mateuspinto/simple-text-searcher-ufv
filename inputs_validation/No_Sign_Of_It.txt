Its a long wait at the gate  
Just to glimpse your fate  
Just to see whether it all works out  
Its a long road a heavy load  
You gotta really want to go  
And just let the others walk around  
You now  
  
Up and down again  
But this time its different  
It took some waiting to straighten  
Out the bend  
In and out of luck  
Yeah at times it was difficult  
I got a new life baby It takes some getting used to but  
  
Chorus  
No sign of any rain  
My skies are clear today  
I keep bracing for that hit  
But theres not sign of it  
No obstacles in sight  
My skies are clear tonight My skies are full of light  
I keep thinking I might see that cloud arrive  
Oh but theres no sign of it  
No sign of it  
  
And as I look around its all new ground  
The leaves on the trees touch down  
But Im above weightless as a dream  
Its been a long road a heavy load  
I just simply had to go  
Had to get here hard as its been  
  
In and out of luck  
Yeah at times it was difficult  
I got a new life baby it takes some getting  
Used to but  
  
Repeat Chorus
