Tell me Jesus are you angry  
One more sheep has just gone astray  
A hardening of hearts turning to stone  
Wandering off so far from home  
  
So many children losing time  
Walk in darkness looking for a sign  
Chasing their rainbows future looks so bright  
Slowly were losing sight of the light  
  
Who cares who cares who cares  
Tell me who cares who cares  
  
Who cares who cares who cares  
Tell me who cares who cares  
  
All alone out in the cold  
Cant look back am I growing old  
I chose a path and is this my fate  
Am I finding out the truth too late  
  
Who cares who cares who cares  
Tell me who cares who cares  
  
Who cares who cares who cares  
Tell me who cares who cares  
  
Here I am a naked man  
Nothing to hide with empty hands  
Remember me well I am the one  
Who lost his way your prodigal son  
  
Can anybody anybody  
Anybody any luck  
Anybody any luck  
  
Am I ever gonna change  
Will I always stay the same  
I say one thing an I do the other  
Same old song goes on forever  
Ever gonna change  
I just take it dead I know  
My will is weak but my bless is strong  
Loose I seem to that yearn of gold
