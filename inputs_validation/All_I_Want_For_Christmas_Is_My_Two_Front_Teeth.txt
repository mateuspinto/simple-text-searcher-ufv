All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth  
My two front teeth my two front teeth  
Gee if I could only have my two front teeth  
Then I could wish you Merry Christmas  
  
It seems so long since I could say  
Sister Susie sitting on a thistle  
Gosh oh gee how happy Id be  
If I could only whistle  
  
All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth  
My two front teeth my two front teeth  
Gee if I could only have my two front teeth  
Then I could wish you Merry Christmas  
  
All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth  
My two front teeth my two front teeth  
Gee if I could only have my two front teeth  
Then I could wish you Merry Christmas  
  
It seems so long since I could say  
Sister Susie sitting on a thistle  
Gosh oh gee how happy Id be  
If I could only whistle  
  
All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth  
Two front teeth two front teeth  
Gee if I could only have my two front teeth  
Then I could wish you Merry Christmas  
  
It seems so long since I could say  
Sister Susie sitting on a thistle  
Gosh oh gee how happy Id be  
If I could only whistle  
  
All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth  
Two front teeth my two front teeth  
Gee if I could only have my two front teeth  
Then I could wish you Merry Christmas
