Our mother who art of the universe  
Hallow be thy name  
Thy wisdom reign thy will is done  
As it is to be  
  
You gave us life and protection  
And see us through our confusion  
Teach us love and freedom  
As it is to be  
  
For thy is our wisdom and power  
Glory forever  
For thy is our wisdom and power  
Glory forever  
  
For thy is our wisdom and power  
Glory forever  
For thy is our wisdom and power  
Glory forever  
For thy is our wisdom and power  
Glory
