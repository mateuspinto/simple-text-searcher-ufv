Got a woman that loves me  
And I love her so  
But shes all dressed up now  
With nowhere to go  
  
All our old hangouts  
Are boarded up and closed  
Or bein bought by somebody  
Nobody knows  
  
But things aint that bad  
We still got the kids  
Were goin out to the movies  
Right after this  
  
Goin back to school  
Savin up my tuition  
Gonna rewrite all the rules  
On the old blackboard  
  
Cause it seems things today  
There aint no magic in em  
They dont cut the grade  
Like they used to  
  
Depression blues  
Nowhere to go  
Bein bought by somebody  
Nobody knows  
  
Is there anybody out there  
With a voice loud and clear  
Gonna sing all the words  
We all want to hear  
  
Depression blues  
Nowhere to go  
Bein bought by somebody  
Nobody knows
