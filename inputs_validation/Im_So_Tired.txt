Im so tired I havent slept a wink  
Im so tired my mind is on the blink  
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink  
No no no  
  
Im so tired I dont know what to do  
Im so tired my mind is set on you  
I wonder should I call you but I know what you would do  
  
Youd say Im putting you on  
But its no joke its doing me harm  
You know I cant sleep I cant stop my brain  
You know its three weeks Im going insane  
You know Id give you everything Ive got  
For a little peace of mind  
  
Im so tired Im feeling so upset  
Although Im so tired Ill have another cigarette  
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh  
He was such a stupid get  
  
Youd say Im putting you on  
But its no joke its doing me harm  
You know I cant sleep I cant stop my brain  
You know its three weeks Im going insane  
You know Id give you everything Ive got  
For a little peace of mind  
  
Id give you everything Ive got  
For a little peace of mind  
  
Id give you everything Ive got  
For a little peace of mind
