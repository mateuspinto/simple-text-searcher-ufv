Black days of winter all were through  
The blossoms came and they brought you  
Clouds left the sky I knew the reason why  
They made way for you  
And the blossom and the blossom  
  
The seasons cycle turned again  
An April shower now and then  
Trees came alive bees left their hive  
They came out to see you  
And the blossom and the blossom  
  
People were laughing smiling with the sun  
They knew that summer had begun  
  
The days grew warm the nights grew long  
Spring turned to summer and was gone  
It seemed so fine the cider and the wine  
But I knew youd go  
With the blossom with the blossom  
  
When spring returns Ill look again  
To find another blossom friend  
Until I do find something new  
Ill just think of you  
And the blossom and the blossom  
Ill just think of you and the blossom
