They seek us in this unquiet zone  
They chase us on from hole to hole  
They hunt us down like carrion crows  
They search us out like frightened moles  
This surely is a dreadful war  
An awful waste of guts and gore  
An awful waste of human life  
This senseless bloody bitter strife  
We huddled close against the ground  
Scared to make the slightest sound  
And all around the great guns boom  
The constant march of pending doom
