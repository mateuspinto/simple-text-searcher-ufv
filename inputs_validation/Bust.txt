Ghosts and goblins run amock  
In the caverns of rhine  
Slinging petty corruption  
The seventh sign  
  
Chorus  
Yeah  
Give to you and I do what it takes  
To give it to you  
Bust Bust  
  
Big Boi  
Step into the realms Os space where nobody goes  
Only the baddest motherfuckers are the ones that are chose  
Some of the coolest individuals on the planet we said  
Best believe that we can buck or give a damn if we cared  
No collision supervision but my family is here  
Now my mama taught my niggas that was under the stairs  
One of those who chauffeured life and then was unprepared  
But my hunger is the thought that no wonder it cant be smothered  
Or buttered up buttercup melt your sauce  
You a Chucky Cheese bouncer chumpin off the boss  
What Im trying to tell you now is that youre softer that soft  
And Im sick as a cough did I mention its raw  
Your predicaments flaw  
Flaw means fucked up and serving out the oven not fried slow roast  
No coast tuck your tail and hide  
You scared  
  
Chorus  
  
Killer Mike  
I officially do it with duns on tour  
We lock down traps push caps galore  
My wiz cook work til it scale like fish  
My old earth even known to handle biz  
I serve whipped out of whips whip out cash  
Usually keep a G packed under the dash  
Try to test my gangsta I bring harm  
Im as slick as Freeway Rick and Nicholas Barnes  
My uptown Nikes hold caps and cheddar  
My waistline hold a 4pound Baretta  
Ill shoe lace your face just to learn you better  
My ox so sharp it cut through leather  
My rap name Killer my street name Skunk  
I mastered the music that was born in the Bronx  
I switch my slang spit from my mouth  
Im still all coast my coast the South  
  
Chorus
