In 1950 when I was born  
Papa couldnt afford to buy us much  
He said be proud of what you are  
Theres something special bout people like us  
  
People like us  
Who will answer the telephone  
People like us  
Growing as big as a house  
People like us  
Gonna make it because  
  
We dont want freedom  
We dont want justice  
We just want someone to love  
Someone to loveu  
I was called upon in the third grade class  
I gave my answer and it caused a fuss  
Im not the same as evryone else  
And times were hard for people like us  
  
People like us  
Who will answer the telephone  
People like us  
Growing as big as a house  
People like us  
Gonna make it because  
  
What good is freedom  
God laughs at people like us  
I see it coming  
Like coming down from above  
  
The clouds roll by and the moon comes up  
How long must we live in the heat of the sun  
Millions of people are waitin on love  
And this is a song about people like us  
  
People like us  
Who answer the telephone  
People like us  
Growing big as a house  
People like us  
Gonna make it because  
We dont want freedom  
We dont want justice  
We just want someone to love  
  
Someone to love  
Someone to love  
Someone to love
