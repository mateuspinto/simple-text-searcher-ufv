In the dead of night  
A shimmerin light  
Gleam of a blade  
And the devil was paid  
When the axe comes down  
A chilling sound  
Steel hits the head  
Another rabbits dead  
Im a rabbit slayer  
A guitar player  
With a nasty habit  
  
Kill the rabbit  
Ahhhaahooohhh  
Be very very quiet  
Im lookin for rabbits  
  
Im a mean mistreater  
A rabbit feaster  
And I predict  
A bloody Easter  
A scurrying shadow  
And the shadow was this rabbit  
And the night air echoes  
Kill the rabbit  
Kill the rabbit  
Kill the rabbit  
Kill the rabbit  
Kill the rabbit  
Kill the rabbit  
Kill the rabbit  
Ohhhh And there wont be any more rabbits around  
No more Roger Rabbit  
No more Peter Rabbit  
And no more Playboy Bunny Rabbits  
Ah ha ha ha ha  
Be very very careful
