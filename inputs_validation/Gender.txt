I wish I was infinite and given my way  
Id be so fucking cool  
When im feeling the rush  
I look at you through different eyes  
I never knew my thoughts televise what you think  
Im the twin inside you  
  
Its hard to believe what you say  
Uaccepting what youve tried to show us  
And nothing can fix whats incomplete  
Cant get to us never get to us  
  
Refreshing memories of times weve known  
Constantly stumbling over reason where do these words go  
Now so true covering no one esle but you  
Stepping up to freak the day  
Devour every modern day  
  
Fell awake in my dizziness  
Im blinding  
I wish I was obedient  
Arent I something  
Ill never be rational  
Im finding my way to everyone in this velvet sky of mine  
  
  
Boredom does nothing for me  
So why does it follow  
Walking with the deadbeats down the street  
I want everything  
  
Ill be your idol  
Be your maker  
Your everything  
Your dirty dream designer  
Be your everything
