Stuck here at a Holiday Inn near Austin Texas  
Seen all the road that I want to see  
God I hate the snow they even canceled the show  
Makes me long for where I really want to be  
  
Oh I wish I was there tonight on Jost Van Dyke  
Sipping on some Foxys Firewater rum  
Or kickin back with Ivan  
With all my friends down in the islands  
Wouldnt take much for me to up and run  
To another life somewhere in the sun  
  
Got cold fajitas and only one channel on the TV  
Andy and Barney on Nick at night  
Seen an ad for Mexico God I really want to go  
Anywhere out of mind and out of sight  
  
Oh I wish I was there tonight on Jost Van Dyke  
Sipping on some Foxys Firewater rum  
Or kickin back with Ivan  
With all my friends down in the islands  
Wouldnt take much for me to up and run  
To another life somewhere in the sun  
  
Heres a toast to you on the coast and the sailors out at sea  
Drink your ales hoist your sails  
Ride the winds and think of me cause  
  
Oh I wish I was there tonight on Jost Van Dyke  
Sipping on some Foxys Firewater rum  
Or kickin back with Ivan  
With all my friends down in the islands  
Wouldnt take much for me to up and run  
To another life somewhere in the sun  
  
Somewhere in the sun
