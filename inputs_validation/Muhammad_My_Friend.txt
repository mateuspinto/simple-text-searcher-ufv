Muhammad my friend  
Its time to tell the world  
We both know it was a girl  
Back in Bethlehem  
And on that fateful day  
When she was crucified  
She wore Shiseido Red  
And we drank tea by her side  
  
Sweet sweet  
Used to be so sweet to me  
  
Muhammad my friend  
Im getting very scared  
Teach me how to love  
My brothers who dont know the law  
And what about the deal  
On the flying trapeze  
Got a peanut butter hand  
But honey do drop in  
At the Dew Drop Inn  
  
Sweet sweet  
Between the boys and the bees  
  
Moses I know  
I know youve seen the fire  
But youve never seen fire  
Until youve seen Pele blow  
And Ive never seen light  
But I sure have seen gold  
And Gladys save a place for me on your grapevine  
Till I get my own TV show  
Ashre ashre ashre ashre  
And if I lose my Cracker Jacks at the tidal wave  
I got a place in the Popes rubber robe  
  
Muhammad my friend  
Its time to tell the world  
We both know it was a girl  
Back in Bethlehem
