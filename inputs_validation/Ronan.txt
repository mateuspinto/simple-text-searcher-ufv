I remember your bare feet down the hallway  
I remember your little laugh  
Race cars on the kitchen floor  
Plastic dinosaurs I love you to the moon and back  
  
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine like we had our own secret club  
I remember you dancing before bed time then jumping on me waking me up  
I can still feel you hold my hand  
Little man from even that moment I knew  
You fought it hard like an army guy  
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you  
  
Come on baby with me  
Were gonna fly away from here  
You were my best four years  
  
I remember the drive home when the blind hope  
Turned to crying and screaming Why  
Flowers piled up in the worst way  
No one knows what to say about a beautiful boy who died  
  
And its about to be Halloween  
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here  
  
I remember the last day when I kissed your face  
I whispered in your ear  
  
Come on baby with me  
Were gonna fly away from here  
Out of this curtained room in this hospital  
Well just disappear  
Come on baby with me  
Were gonna fly away from here  
You were my best four years  
  
What if Im standing in your closet trying to talk to you  
What if I kept the hand me downs you wont grow into  
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through  
But what if the miracle was even getting one moment with you  
  
Come on baby with me  
Were gonna fly away from here  
Come on baby with me  
Were gonna fly away from here  
You were my best four years  
  
I remember your bare feet down the hallway  
I love you to the moon and back
