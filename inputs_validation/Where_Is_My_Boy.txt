Where is my boy  
I saw you come out of a scene  
Maybe in some kind of dream  
Something that never comes  
  
Time that I take  
See over in arms Ill raise  
Ill race in to find you  
Ill race in to find you  
  
Time stands  
I open your eyes to my world  
I see you come out of it all  
Unharmed and unscathed  
And shouting oh  
  
Come on in  
In houses I live in  
And changes youre making  
To the state of affairs  
  
Calling where is my boy  
I have seen you so often  
I cry where is my boy  
Oh have you all forgotten  
  
And in some kind of dream  
Have I seen you before  
Oh have I seen you before  
Oh where is my boy  
  
So come all the way  
Changing your number  
Changing the house where you live  
Change your lines  
  
Have I seen you before  
In some kind of a dream  
In a place youve forgotten  
A place Ive forgotten  
  
So where is my boy  
When I kneel in your arms  
I flew awry  
Where is my boy  
  
Have I seen you before  
In some kind of a dream  
Have I seen you before  
In some kind of a dream  
  
In my hands youll fall  
Open in as it seems  
Have I seen you before  
  
Oh baby your arms and your legs are shattered  
Where is my boy  
Where is my boy  
  
I said where is my boy  
Have you seen me before  
When I look in your eyes  
Tell me he had to go  
  
Said I seen you before  
In some kind of dream  
Seems Ive seen you before  
In some kind of a dream  
  
I say where is the boy  
Have I seen you before  
Yeah I saw you before  
In some kind of a dream  
  
I say where was my head  
When I needed it most  
Oh I stayed here before  
Yes I stay in the place I know
