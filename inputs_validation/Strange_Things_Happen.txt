Oh I see you out late at night  
You dont treat your baby right  
Theres strange things happenin everyday  
  
The love that you refuse  
Some other man can use  
Strange things are happenin everyday  
  
Everyday everyday  
Everyday everyday  
Theres strange things happenin everyday  
  
The love that you refuse  
Some other man can use  
Strange things are happenin everyday  
  
The way you never miss the water  
Until your well runs dry  
Strange things are happenin everyday  
  
I wont be satisfied  
Till I see teardrops in your eyes  
Strange things are happenin everyday  
  
Yes everyday everyday  
Everyday everyday  
Theres strange things happenin everyday  
  
I wont be satisfied  
Till I see teardrops in your eyes  
Strange things are happenin everyday  
  
Oh well you thought I was a fool  
But I got blues for you  
Strange things are happenin everyday  
  
I found this someone new  
And Im feelin through you  
Strange things are happenin everyday  
  
Everyday everyday  
Everyday everyday  
Theres strange things happenin everyday  
  
Found this someone new  
And Im feelin through you  
Strange things are happenin everyday  
  
Yes strange things are happenin happenin everyday
