I look to You my God  
And lift my eyes to see  
Incline my ear to You  
Your voice I long to hear  
  
Jesus here I stand  
Reaching out my hands  
Waiting for Your voice  
Jesus I need You more  
  
Jesus I want to hear Your voice  
Jesus I want to know You more  
  
Speak to me Lord  
Speak to me Lord  
Speak to me Lord  
I want to hear Your voice  
  
My heart cries out  
My soul cries out  
My heart cries out for You  
My heart cries out  
My soul cries out for more  
My heart cries out for You
