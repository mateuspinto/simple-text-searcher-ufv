I love my dog as much as I love you  
But you may fade my dog will always come through  
  
All he asks from me is the food to give him strength  
All he ever needs is love and that he knows hell get  
  
So I love my dog as much as I love you  
But you may fade my dog will always come through  
  
All the pay I need comes shining through his eyes  
I dont need no cold water to make me realize that  
  
I love my dog as much as I love you  
But you may fade my dog will always come through  
  
Na na na na na na nana  
  
I love my dog as much as I love you  
But you may fade my dog will always come through  
  
Na na na na na na nana  
  
I love my dog baby I love my dog Na na na  
I love my dog baby I love my dog Na na na
