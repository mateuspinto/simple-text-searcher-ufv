Hello friend where you been so long  
Time goes by so easy it sleeps away  
Just like a shadow at the end of the day  
  
Hello friend how are things for you these days  
Some guy from waybackwhen he mentioned your name  
Did he ever get back to you  
Ah you know I told him to  
  
Sometimes I turn and I swear I hear you call  
And I often wonder how we lost what we knew  
Seems it gone in the wind washed away in the rain  
And the years go by and by  
  
The bridges you burned long sinced turned into ashes  
When there were no reasons now the river runs dry  
Seems it gone in the wind washed away in the rain  
And the years go by and by  
Where you been so long
