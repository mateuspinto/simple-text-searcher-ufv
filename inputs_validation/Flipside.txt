Verse 1  
I tried to get high but you wanted me low  
Good things are happening but happening slow  
Its some kind of mystery from long ago  
  
I finally know who Im supposed to be  
My mind was locked but I found the key  
Hope it dont all slip away from me  
PreChorus  
Hard times fun lines  
Moments pass by and I cry  
Rewind step behind  
Its hard to find the flipside  
  
Chorus  
I cant stand when you tell me to get back  
If were all free then why does it seem we cant just be  
  
Verse 2  
You saw your reflection all over the news  
Your temperatures well past a hundred and two  
Put the guns away or well all gonna lose  
  
PreChorus  
Stand by or take flight  
Eat or throw your piece pie  
Walk on or be mine  
Moments fly by and I cry  
  
Chorus  
I cant stand when you tell me to get back  
If were all free then why does it seem we cant just be  
I cant stand when you tell me to get back  
If were all free then why does it seem we cant just be
