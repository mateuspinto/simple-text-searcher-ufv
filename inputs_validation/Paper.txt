Hold the paper up to the light  
some rays pass right through  
Expose yourself out there for a minute  
some rays pass right through  
  
Take a little rest when the rays pass through  
Take a little time off when the rays pass through  
  
Go ahead and mess it upGo ahead and tie it up  
In a long distance telephone call  
  
Hold on to that paper  
Hold on to that paper  
Hold on because its been taken care of  
Hold on to that paper  
  
See if you can fit it on the paper  
See if you can get it on the paper  
See if you can fit it on the paper  
See if you can get it on the paper  
  
Had a love affair but it was only paper  
some rays they pass right through  
Had a lot of fun could have been a lot better  
some rays they pass right through  
  
Take a little consideration take every combination  
Take a few weeks off make it tighter tighter  
But it was never it was never written down  
Still might be a chance that it might work out if you  
  
Hold on to that paper  
Hold on to that paper  
Hold on because itll be taken care of  
Hold on to that paper  
  
Dont think I can fit it on the paper  
Dont think I can get it on the paper  
Go ahead and rip up rip up the paper  
Go ahead and tear up tear up the paper
