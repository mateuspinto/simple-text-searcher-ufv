In the quiet silent seconds I  
I turned off the light switch and I  
I came down to meet you in the  
Half light the moon left while a  
A cluster of night jars sang some  
Songs out of tune  
A mantle of bright light shone  
Down from the room  
  
Come down in time  
I still hear him say  
So clear in my ear  
Like it was today  
Come down in time  
Was the message he gave  
Come down in time and ill  
Meet you half way  
  
Well I dont know if I should have  
Heard him as yet but a  
True love like his is a  
A hard love to get and Ive  
Walked most all the way and I  
I aint heard him call and Im  
Getting to thinking  
If hes coming at all  
  
Come down in time  
I still hear him say  
So clear in my ear  
Like it was today  
Come down in time  
Was the message he gave  
Come down in time and ill  
Meet you half way  
  
There are men and men and  
Some hold you tight while  
Some leave you counting the  
Stars in the night
