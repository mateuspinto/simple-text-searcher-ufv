Six by six from wall to wall  
Shutters on the windows no light at all  
Damp on the floor you got damp in the bed  
Theyre trying to get you crazy get you out of your head  
They feed you scraps and they feed you lies  
To lower your defenses no compromise  
Theres nothing you can do the day can be long  
You mind is working overtime your bodys not too strong  
  
Hold on hold on hold on  
Hold on hold on hold on  
  
They put you in a box so you cant get heard  
Let your spirit stay unbroken may you not be deterred  
Hold on you have gambled with your own life  
You faced the night alone  
While the builders of the cages  
Sleep with bullets bars and stone  
They do not see the road to freedom  
That you build with flesh and bone  
  
They take you out the light burns your eyes  
To the talking room its not surprise  
Loaded questions from clean white coats  
Their eyes are all as hidden as their Hippocratic Oath  
They tell you how to behave behave as their guest  
You want to resist them you do your best  
They take you to your limits they take you beyond  
For all that they are doing theres no way to respond  
  
Hold on hold on  
They put you in a box so you cant get heard  
Let your spirit stay unbroken may you not be deterred  
Hold on you have gambled with your own life  
You face the night alone  
While the builders of the cages  
Sleep with bullets bars and stone  
They do not see the road to freedom  
That you build with flesh and bone  
  
Though you may disappear youre not forgotten here  
And I will say to you I will do what I can do  
  
You may disappear youre not forgotten here  
And I will say you you I will do what I can do  
And I will do what I can do  
I will do what I can do
