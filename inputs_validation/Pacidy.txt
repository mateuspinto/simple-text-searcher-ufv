Pacidy my love  
Glowing ember of evening  
Your eyes are frozen with guilt  
I read my fate on your cheeks  
The smoldering coals of a passion  
Once a meadow of hope  
  
Days of minstrels and bright steeds  
Autumn nights and silk sheets  
Your tender battle shadow on me  
Scented lavender kisses soft and warm  
The union of strength in a love against life  
Love against life  
  
Pacidy my love  
Your touch so limp was once frenzied  
Your argon lips were once sweet  
A life has slipped through my hands  
My spirits sift in a stale sigh  
Did love exist as a dream  
  
Mother fawn of a pine wood  
Shepherdess of my grief  
Veils a freedom not for me  
Far beyond the steep ridge where blizzards  
Blast the spirit of man the frailest of beasts  
Frailest of beasts  
  
Where blizzards  
Blast the spirit of man the frailest of beasts  
Frailest of beasts  
  
Where blizzards  
Blast the spirit of man the frailest of beasts  
Frailest of beasts
