I wake up fine and dandy but then by the time I find it handy  
To rip my heart apart and start planning my crash landing  
I go up to the ceiling  
Then I feel my soul start leaving like an old mans hair receding  
Im pleading please oh please on my knees repeatedly asking  
Why its got to be like this is this living free  
I dont want to be the one be the one who has the suns blood on my hands  
Ill tell the moon take this weapon forged in darkness  
Some see a pen I see a harpoon  
Ill stay awake Cause the darks not taking prisoners tonight  
Why am I not scared in the morning I dont hear those voices calling  
I must have kicked them out I must have kicked them out  
I swear I heard demons yelling those crazy words they were spelling  
They told me I was gone they told me I was gone  
But Ill tell them  
Why wont you let me go  
Do I threaten all your plans Im insignificant  
Please tell them you have no plans for me  
I will set my soul on fire what have I become  
On the eve of a day thats forgotten and fake  
As the trees they await and clouds anticipate  
The start of a day when we put on our face  
A mask that portrays that we dont need grace  
On the eve of a day that is bigger than us  
But we open our eyes cause were told that we must  
And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead  
Desperately yelling theres something we need  
Im not free I asked forgiveness three times  
Same amount that I denied I threetime mvped this crime  
Im afraid to tell you who I adore wont tell you what Im sing towards  
Metaphorically Im a whore and thats denial number four
