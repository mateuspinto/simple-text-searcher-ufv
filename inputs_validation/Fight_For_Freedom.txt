Theres a sound heard across the land  
Its heard across the sea  
Youll only hear it if you listen with your hearts  
And one day hope to be free  
To hear the sound of freedom many gave their lives  
They fought for you and me  
Those memories will always live in silence  
And now its our time to be free  
Where the eagles fly  I will soon be there  
If you want to  come along with me my friend  
Say the words and youll be free  
From the mountains to the sea  
Well fight for freedom again  
Scream out loud for all the world to hear  
From sea to shining sea   
Let freedom ring and every man be king  
To live as one through the years  
Now is the time we all must stand together  
So raise your hands show them we are strong  
Side by side the fight goes on forever  
Marching to the battle with this song
