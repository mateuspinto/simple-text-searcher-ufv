Well I spied a berry bush as I was strolling home one day  
And somehow it brought back the bygone days  
Of when you and I were berry picking many years ago  
In a little county not so far away  
  
How well I do remember the day when we first met  
It leaves a picture in my mind I never can forget  
  
Chorus  
We were picking berries at Old Aunt Marys  
When I picked a blushing bride  
As we strolled home together I just wondered whether  
I could win you forever if I tried  
Then at loves suggestion I popped the question  
And asked you to be mine  
By your kisses I knew youd picked me and Id picked you  
At berry picking time  
  
Chorus  
  
Well how sweet you were that day in your simple gingham gown  
To me you were as lovely as a Queen  
When from underneath your bonnet popped a pair of golden curls  
And the bluest eyes that I have ever seen  
Your lips were red as cherries the taste was twice as sweet  
It only took one kiss to make my happiness complete  
  
Chorus
