In the backroom of the Elmaco casino  
Under the portrait of Doris Day  
You and I and a pair of cnotes  
Soft candy betting hard eight our date  
  
Not quite how you laid it out for me  
When we split up that night that night  
Comin out of the sunset marquee  
Before you left to deal the fine white  
  
Is this how youve pictured me  
Is this how you thought it would be  
We got right with the usual mutual problem  
That got right between you and me  
I told you the girl would be trouble  
I said she was going to break us  
Leave us lost in the rust and the rubble
