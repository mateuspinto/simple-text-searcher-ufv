We heard the fireworks Rushed out to watch the sky Happy go lucky Fourth of
July  
How can you live in the Northeast How can you live in the South How can you
build on the banks of a river when the flood water pours from the mouth How
can you be a Christian How can you be a Jew How can you be a Muslim a
Buddhist a Hindu  
How can you  
Weak as the winter sun we enter life on earth Names and religion come just
after date of birth Then everybody gets a tongue to speak and everyone hears
an inner voice A day at the end of the week to wonder and rejoice  
If the answer is infinite light why do we sleep in the dark  
How can you live in the Northeast How can live in the South How can you
build on the banks of a river when the flood water pours from the mouth How
can you tattoo your body Why do you cover your head How can you eat from a
rice bowl the holy man only breaks bread  
We watched the fireworks til they were fireflies Followed a path of stars
over the endless skies  
How can you live in the Northeast How can you live in the South How can you
build on the banks of a river when the flood water pours from the mouth  
Ive been given all I wanted Only three generations off the boat I have
harvested and Ive planted I am wearing my fathers old coat
