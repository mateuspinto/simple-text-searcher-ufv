I shouldve known better than to look in your eyes  
Cause thats what got me thinking of the love we had shared  
Your spell lives on forever Oh you captured my heart  
How could I forget you or the love we had made  
Seems like only yesterday when I held you in my arms  
And you would softly whisper Ill never leave  
  
Chorus  
Cry forever cry for the dreams we had  
Where did our love go do you ever think of me  
Cry forever cry for the dreams well never share  
You made me love you hen you turned your back upon me now  
Oh I remember lying side by side  
Your heart gently beating softly with mine  
Your face just like an angel smiling up at me  
The hunger and the passion when wed set our love free  
Now the clock is slowly ticking in this empty room  
The images are haunting like a candle through the gloom  
Cry forever  
I dreamed about you last night and the vision was so clear  
Of you and I together with no pain lies or tears  
I woke up late this morning with you still on my mind  
I could swear that you were with me I was back there in time  
Pictures in the night cant sustain the light of day  
I need someone to hold me wholl never fade away  
Cry forever  
Do you ever think of me at all
