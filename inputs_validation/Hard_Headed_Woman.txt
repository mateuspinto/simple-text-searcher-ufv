Well a hard headed woman  
A soft hearted man  
Been the cause of trouble  
Ever since the world began  
Oh yeah ever since the world began  
A hard headed woman been  
A thorn in the side of man  
  
Now Adam told to Eve  
Listen here to me  
Dont you let me catch you  
Messing round that apple tree  
Oh yeah ever since the world began  
A hard headed woman been  
A thorn in the side of man  
  
Now Samson told Delilah  
Loud and clear  
Keep your cotton picking fingers  
Out my curly hair  
Oh yeah ever since the world began  
A hard headed woman been  
A thorn in the side of man  
  
I heard about a king  
Who was doing swell  
Till he started playing  
With that evil Jezebel  
Oh yeah ever since the world began  
A hard headed woman been a thorn in the side of man  
  
I got a woman  
A head like a rock  
If she ever went away  
Id cry around the clock  
Oh yeah ever since the world began  
A hard headed woman been  
A thorn in the side of man
