Hey over there  
Please forgive me  
If Im comin on too strong  
Hate to stare  
But youre winnin  
And theyre playin my favorite song  
So come here  
A little closer  
Wanna whisper in your ear  
Make it clear  
A little question  
Wanna know just how you feel  
  
If I said my heart was beating loud  
If we could escape the crowd somehow  
If I said I want your body now  
Would you hold it against me  
Cause you feel like paradise  
And I need a vacation tonight  
So if I said I want your body now  
Would you hold it against me  
  
Hey you might think  
That Im crazy  
But you know Im just your type  
I might be  
Little hazy  
But you just cannot deny  
Theres a spark  
In between us  
When were dancin on the floor  
I want more  
Wanna see it  
So Im askin you tonight  
  
If I said my heart was beating loud  
If we could escape the crowd somehow  
If I said I want your body now  
Would you hold it against me  
Cause you feel like paradise  
And I need a vacation tonight  
So if I said I want your body now  
Would you hold it against me  
  
If I said I want your body  
Would you hold it against me  
Yeah uhhuh oh  
  
Give me somethin good  
Dont wanna wait  
I want it now  
Pop it like a hood  
And show me how you work it out  
  
Alright  
If I said my heart was beating loud  
If I said I want your body now  
Would you hold it against me  
  
If I said my heart was beating loud  
If we could escape the crowd somehow  
If I said I want your body now  
Would you hold it against me  
Cause you feel like paradise  
And I need a vacation tonight  
So if I said I want your body now  
Would you hold it against me
