A cloud hangs over  
This city by the sea  
I watch the ships pass and wonder if she might be  
Out there and sober as a well for loneliness  
Please do persist girl its time we met and made a mess  
  
I picture your face in the back of my eyes  
A fire in the attic a proof of the prize  
Anna Molly Anna Molly Anna Molly  
Doo doo doo doo do  
Doo doo doo doo do  
  
A cloud hangs over  
And mutes my happiness  
A thousand ships couldnt sail me back from distress  
Wish you were here  
Im a wounded satellite  
I need you now put me back together make me right  
  
I picture your face in the back of my eyes  
A fire in the attic a proof of the prize  
Anna Molly Anna Molly Anna Molly  
Ill call out your name  
Up into the air  
Not one of the others  
Could ever compare  
Anna Molly Anna Molly  
  
Wait there is a light  
There is a fire illuminated attic  
Fate or something better I could care less  
Just stay with me a while  
Wait there is a light there is a fire defragmenting the attic  
Fate or something better I could care less  
Just stay with me a while  
  
I picture your face in the back of my eyes  
A fire in the attic a proof of the prize  
Anna Molly Anna Molly Anna Molly  
Ill call out your name  
Up into the air  
Not one of the others  
Could ever compare  
Anna Molly Anna Molly  
Anna Molly wait there is a light there is a fire defragmenting the attic  
Anna Molly fate or something better I could care less just stay with me a
while  
  
Doo doo doo doo do do  
Doo doo doo doo do do
