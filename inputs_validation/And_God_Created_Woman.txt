In a deep sleep I fell  
And the music starts 2 swell  
One of my ribs He took and it shall be  
Bone of my bones bone of my bones  
And God created woman  
And we were naked and did not care  
Theres a time 2 take and a time 2 share  
2 in love all around and all aware  
Flesh of my flesh flesh of my flesh  
And God created woman  
  
Temptation sweet and so much sweet and so much  
Surely die if neither one of us shall ye touch shall ye touch  
Then again we could die from the rush rush  
Heart of my heart heart of my heart  
And God created woman woman  
  
Woman  
Mymymymymymy woman  
  
In my darkest hour I find  
Many serpents who have lied lied  
Given half the chance still Id run 2 your side run 2 your side  
Love of my love love of my love  
And God created woman woman  
  
And if I never see you again  
Its alright 4 I am guilty of no sin  
They can have you Ill have your love in the end  
Soul of my soul soul of my soul  
And God created woman  
  
God created woman  
God created woman woman  
Flesh of my flesh  
God created woman soul  
God created God created woman  
God created God created woman  
God created woman
