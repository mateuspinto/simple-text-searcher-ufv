Venus sheds her skin of gold  
Sacrifice her life  
Washes out the demon sleep  
That hides between her eyes  
Walking watching wandering out  
Of soul she must pursue in death  
Will she reach you  
Flytrap  
Flytrap  
Flytrap  
Flytrap  
Venus takes the lightning  
And her hair becomes a flame  
With a guise of innocents  
Who learn her unknown game  
Dancing raining sorcery  
Hes caught between her heat all year  
Shes pleased to meet you  
Flytrap  
Flytrap  
Flytrap  
Flytrap  
Flytrap  demon child  
Flytrap  virgins wild  
Flytrap  angels death  
Flytrap  theres nothing left  
Born without mortal care  
Joyous of flight  
Pleasing to the eye  
Deadly delight  
Venus arguementor  
Torturing my aged soul  
Fighting through the ashes  
Give me back my skin of gold  
Walking Watching Wondering  
The soul she has persued in life  
Will she teach you  
Flytrap  
Flytrap  
Flytrap  
Flytrap
