Down down Down down The star is screaming  
Beneath the lies Lie lie Tschay tschay tschay  
sound of Waters blowing into the microphone  
light screaming from Waters  
Careful careful careful with that axe Eugene  
very loud and prolonged scream  
another very loud and prolonged scream  
Waters blowing into the microphone  
light screaming from Waters  
The stars are screaming loud  
Tsch  
Tsch  
Tsch  
low groaning sound from Waters
