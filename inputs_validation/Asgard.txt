Norsemen hearts belong to you  
Ancient God of war  
You have created a sacred world  
In asgard is your throne  
Time has come to praise the God  
Crazy beings were living here  
In superstitious fear  
Angry Gods would ever cause  
Pestilence or war  
Time has come to praise it has come  
Do it over and over again  
Praise him for the upcoming war  
You wont feel astray  
Hes got power in his hand  
So cry aloud his name  
Odin used to overlook  
From the exalted throne  
Gazed towards south and west  
The goal of all the hopes  
Time has come to praise it has come  
Do it over and over again  
Praise him for the upcoming war  
You wont feel astray  
Hes got power in his hand  
So cry aloud his name  
  
Asgard protects the warriors  
Asgard shelter of Gods  
  
Evil grew among the Gods  
Holy Sagrad fault  
Noone praise it started now  
The twilight of the Gods  
Time has come to praise it has come  
Do it over and over again  
Praise him for the upcoming war  
You wont feel astray  
Hes got power in his hand  
So cry aloud his name  
  
Asgard protects the warriors  
Asgard shelter of Gods
