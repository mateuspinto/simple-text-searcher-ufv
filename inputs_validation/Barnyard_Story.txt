Chicken in the farmyard theres an oven in your bin  
Youre growing old with sorrow youre growing fat with sin  
I was living in the graveyard I was hanging from the wall  
I was living in the desert I was trying not to fall  
  
Once I stood upon Olympus then the heavens opened wide  
I beheld that flaming chariot and I saw the sacred bride  
Now and then my life seems truer now and then my thoughts seem pure  
All in all my thoughts are fewer  maybe death will be my cure
