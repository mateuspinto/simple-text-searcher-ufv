Yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Its 3 am I cant sleep  
Too late to call this is not like me  
But Im still lifted from the tattoo on the small of your back  
The angle of your chin when you were looking back  
See god youre beautiful and Im still coming down  
Id like a onenight stand but you had to stick around  
But Im still floating on the perfume you left on my sheets  
I havent changed a thing since you abandoned me  
Tonight I stare out the window  
Knowing Ill never again be alone  
Last night you changed my life  
And I was stuck in the moment that you kissed me the first time  
Last night you saved my life with your love  
Saved my life  
Last night you saved my life  
Your fingernails running down my spine  
All day I hear your voice like velvet in my mind  
Its like I knew you all my life even though we just met  
My children in your eyes something you dont expect  
I had to stop myself from calling all day long  
Im glad you called me first I wanted to be strong  
But you were laughing because I answered after just one ring  
I tried to play it off  
But you knew everything  
Last night you changed my life  
And I was stuck in the moment that you kissed me the first time  
Last night you saved my life with your love  
Saved my life saved my life  
Last night you saved my life with your love  
Last night you saved my life saved my life  
Last night you saved my life  
Ohh yeah  
I stare at the sky looking for the morning sun  
Cant wait to tell you youre the only one  
Last night you saved my life  
And I was stuck in the moment you kissed me the first time  
Last night you saved my life with your love  
Saved my life saved my life  
Last night you changed my life
