This is the end of a beautiful friendship  
It ended a moment ago  
This is the end of a beautiful friendship  
I know  
Cause your eyes told me so  
  
Weve always been  
Like sister and brother  
Until tonight  
When we looked at each other  
  
That was the end of a beautiful friendship  
And just the beginning of love  
  
That was the end of a beautiful friendship  
And just the beginning of love
