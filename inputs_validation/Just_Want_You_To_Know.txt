Looking at your picture from when we first met  
You gave me a smile that I could never forget  
And nothing I could do could protect me from you that night  
  
Wrapped around your finger always on my mind  
The days would blend cause we stayed up all night  
Yeah you and I were everything everything to me  
  
Chorus  
I just want you to know that Ive been fighting to let you go  
Some days I make it through and then theres nights that never end  
I wish that I could believe that theres a day youll come back to me  
But still I have to say I would do it all again  
Just want you to know  
  
All the doors are closing Im tryin to move ahead  
And deep inside I wish its me instead  
My dreams are empty from the day the day you slipped away  
  
I just want you to know that Ive been fighting to let you go  
Some days I make it through and then theres nights that never end  
I wish that I could believe that theres a day youll come back to me  
But still I have to say I would do it all again  
Just want you to know  
  
That since I lost you I lost myself  
No I cant fake it theres no one else  
  
Chorus x2
