Theres a little mountain church in my thoughts of yesterday  
Where friends and family gathered for the Lord  
Where an ol fashioned preacher taught the straight and narrow way  
For what few coins the congregation could afford  
Dressed in all our Sunday best we sat on pews of solid oak  
And I remember how our voices filled the air  
How Mama sounded like an angel on those high soprano notes  
And When the Roll is Called Up Yonder Ill Be There  
Looking back now that little mountain church house  
Has become my lifes cornerstone  
It was there in that little mountain church house  
I first heard the words I based my life upon  
At the all day Sunday singing with dinner on the ground  
Many were the souls that were revived  
While the brothers and the sisters whove gone on to Gloryland  
Slept in peace in the maple grove nearby
