I am a dull and simple lad  
Can not tell water from champagne  
And I have never met the queen  
And I wish I could have all that he has got  
I wish I could be like David Watts  
  
Fafafafafafafafa  
Fafafafafafafafa  
  
And when I lie on my pillow at night  
I dream I could fight like David Watts  
Lead the school team to victory  
And take my exams and pass the lot  
  
wish I could be  
Wish I could be like David Watts  
wish I could be  
Wish I could be like David Watts  
wish I could be  
Conduct my life like David Watts  
wish I could be  
  
  
I wish I could be like David Watts  
  
Fafafafafafafafa  
Fafafafafafafafa  
  
He is the head boy at the school  
He is the captain of the team  
He is so gay and fancy free  
And I wish all his money belonged to me  
I wish I could be like David Watts  
  
Fafafafafafafafa  
Fafafafafafafafa  
  
And all the girls in the neighborhood  
Try to go out with David Watts  
They try their best but cant succeed  
For he is of pure and noble breed  
  
Wish I could be like  
Wish I could be like  
Wish I could be like  
  
Fafafafafafafafa  
Fafafafafafafafa  
repeat
