Ooooh  
Run away the past will bite again  
Ooooh  
No matter where you dwell  
You  
Here again a captive of the howl  
You  
Welcome back to hell  
  
Faithful as the full moon is rising  
Beauty and the Beast are colliding  
  
Sharpened edge touch liquid flame  
Deepened seed soaks angers reign  
Arching back shapeshift derange  
Father how I watched you change  
  
Am I savage  
Scratching at the door  
Am I savage  
I dont recognize you anymore  
  
Ooooh  
Tooth is fang twisting under skin  
Ooooh  
Foul tongue black breath  
Change  
Snap inside the Beast about complete  
Change  
Soon infects the rest  
  
Faithful as the full moon is rising  
Beauty and the Beast are colliding  
  
Sharpened edge touch liquid flame  
Deepened seed soaks angers reign  
Arching back shapeshift derange  
Father how I watched you change  
  
Am I savage  
Howling at the door  
Am I savage  
I dont recognize you anymore  
Anymore  
  
Ooooh  
Inheritance the past has bit again  
Ooooh  
The next heir of anarchy  
Feel  
Stretching skin so far beyond belief  
I feel  
The ever changing you in me  
  
Am I savage  
Scratching at the door  
Am I savage  
Howling evermore  
Am I savage  
I dont recognize me anymore  
Anymore  
  
Anymore ha ha ha  
Am I savage
