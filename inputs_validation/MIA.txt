Intro  
  
Hook Wiz Khalifa  
I be overseas I be in LA  
I be in the South trappin hard all day  
Im from Pittsburgh but I be in the Bay  
I be in New York I be MIA  
I be in Chitown where they quick to spray  
I be in Detroit where they gettin paid  
I be overseas I be in LA  
I be in New York I be MIA  
  
Verse 1 Wiz Khalifa  
If you know me you know Im bout my bread  
I count a hundred million dollars fore I go to bed  
Im smoking OG Im drinking champagne  
Im standing on the couch just throwing up my damn gang  
Im out in A town bout to go to Mansion  
My jewelry on so all my dogs is ready for the action  
Im in my old school my niggas ridin new  
Im in the Fountain Bleu like what you tryin to do  
I brought the whole thing so thats what Imma smoke  
I spent the whole thing Im never going broke  
Im rocking gold chains Im drinking til I croak  
Smokin til I choke my watch need a vote  
  
Hook  
  
Verse 2 Juicy J  
On vacation weed in rotation  
Relaxation trippy nation  
Chasing bands model chicks  
Look like Sports Illustrated  
Im getting high as a plane  
With no final destination  
On that gin on that Hen  
And that lean intoxication  
Rocking dollars rocking gold  
Money tall like Manute Bol  
In a presidential suite  
With some playmates in a fold  
Niggas out here chasing ass  
When they should be chasing cash  
I be smoking til its gone  
Juicy J dont waste no gas  
With her legs lift up  
I thought it was a stick up  
Shouldve seen them hoes that pick up  
Bands hard to lift up  
Yellow diamonds look like a bumble bee  
They call me the money tree  
All these bands on me I can throw a jamboree
