I just want to set the world afire  
Red flash clouds choking out the morning sky  
They said itd never come we knew it was a lie  
All forms of life die now the humans all succumb  
Time to kiss your ass goodbye the end has just begun  
Distorted figures walk the street its 1999  
Weeds once underneath the feet have grown to vines  
Bodies melted like a candle a land without a face  
No time to change your fate no time left its too late  
The arsenal of Megadeth cant be rid of they said  
And if it comes the living will envy the dead  
Racing for power and all come in last  
No winning first stone cast  
This falsehood worldly peace  
Its treaties soon will cease  
No one will be left to prove that humans existed  
Maybe soon the children will be born open fisted  
We all live on one planet and it will all go up in smoke  
Too bad they couldnt see this lethal energy  
And now the final scene a global darkening  
Dig deep the piles of rubble and ruin  
Towering overhead both far and wide  
Theres unknown tools for World War III  
Einstein said Well use rocks on the other side  
No survivors set the world afire
