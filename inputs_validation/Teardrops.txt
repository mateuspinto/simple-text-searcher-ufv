Teardrops running down your face  
Teardrops running down your face  
Diamonds of water and salt from your body  
Coming down to meet my kisses  
  
Teardrops running down your face  
Teardrops running down your face  
Staining your skin and my skin and beginning  
The stories that you cant begin  
  
The way I feel could be despised  
But its a vision that I prize  
Teardrops  
Teardrops  
  
Im not trying to make you feel pain  
Or joy to make the tears flow  
But when they roll unashamed  
They move me so  
  
Teardrops running down your face  
Teardrops running down your face  
Let me let me brush them with my fingers  
Comfort you and say its alright  
  
Its so strong this way I feel  
Sometimes I want to beg or steal  
Teardrops  
Teardrops
