Running in the human race  
round in circles  
No sense of time and space  
Or who we are  
Let me pour some water in your wine  
Lets talk about the future  
We should have better things on our minds anyway  
No time for words  
No time for wars  
Its high time we work it out  
No time for fighting  
No time for tears  
Somebody tell me what its all about  
We could be making the best of the night  
But all we do is scream and shout  
Time out  for love  
Lovers on a battlefield  
A house divided  
Eyes that pierce like maked steel  
Through the heart  
Come lay your wounded body down  
And talk about the future  
Throw your weapons to the ground  
Before its too late  
No time for words  
No time for wars  
Its high time we work it out  
No time for fighting  
No time for tears  
Somebody tell me what its all about  
We could be making the best of the night  
But all we do is scream and shout  
Time out  for love  
No time for words  
No time for wars  
Its high time we work it out  
No time for fighting  
No time for tears  
Somebody tell me what its all about  
We could be making the best of the night  
But all we do is scream and shout  
Time out  for love
