Try to remember those ancient evenings  
When all we had was just enough  
Now the pretender knows why the king is screaming  
The grief was finally just too much  
  
Im going to ride with the idol  
Like a creature on display  
Tied to the bottom of a cage  
Ride with the idol  
But it wont turn out the same  
I know they wont blow out the flame  
  
Over my shoulder I know theyre waiting  
Their dirty hands are everywhere  
And as they get closer all the pretense is fading  
The face beneath the skin is bare  
  
So now I ride with the idol  
Like a creature on display  
Tied to the bottom of a cage oh yeah  
Ride with the idol  
But it wont turn out the same  
I know they wont blow out the flame  
  
I can never learn to say no  
Wont they ever let me go  
  
guitar interlude  
  
Im going to ride with the idol  
Like a creature on display  
Tied to the bottom of a cage Oh yeah yeah  
Ride with the idol  
But it wont turn out the same  
I know they wont blow out the flame  
Ride with the idol  
Like a creature on display  
Tied to the bottom of a cage Oh yeah yeah  
Ride with the idol  
But it wont turn out the same  
I know they wont blow out the flame fade
