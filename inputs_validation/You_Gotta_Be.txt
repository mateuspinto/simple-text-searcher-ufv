Listen as your day unfolds  
Challenge what the future holds  
Try and keep your head up to the sky  
  
Lovers they may cause you tears  
Go ahead release your fears  
Stand up and be counted  
Dont be ashamed to cry  
  
You gotta be  
You gotta be bad you gotta be bold  
You gotta be wiser you gotta be hard  
You gotta be tough you gotta be stronger  
  
You gotta be cool you gotta be calm  
You gotta stay together

Herald what your mother said  
Readin the books your father read  
Try to solve the puzzles in your own sweet time  
  
Some may have more cash than you  
Others take a different view

Time ask no questions it goes on without you  
Leaving you behind if you cant stand the pace  
  
The world keeps on spinning  
You cant stop it if you try to  
The best part is danger staring you in the face
