Everyone is searching for the  
Meaning of our life  
Reading bout the hell and heaven  
Believing all those lies  
  
Look upon yourself  
Imagine you are two  
Power lies within this is true  
  
Cant you see its clear like a mirror  
Its all within what youre searching for  
  
Magic mirror magic mirror  
Magic mirror magic mirror  
  
Now your eyes are open  
and you know you were a fool  
You always had the power  
But you never broke the rules  
  
Look upon yourself  
Imagine you are two  
Power lies within this is true  
  
Cant you see its clear like a mirror  
Its all within what youre searching for  
  
Magic mirror magic mirror  
Magic mirror magic mirror  
  
Once again I say  
The strength that we are all searching for  
High and low we all looked in vain  
Cant you see its clear like a mirror  
Its all within what youre searching for  
  
Magic mirror Magic mirror  
Magic mirror Magic mirror
