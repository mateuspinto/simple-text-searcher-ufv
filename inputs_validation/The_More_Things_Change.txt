Woke up this morning on the wrong side of bed  
I got this feeling like a trains running through my head  
Turned on my radio to the same old song  
Some big mouth talking trying to tell us where the world went wrong  
  
But all this talk of peace and love  
Its only for the news  
Cause everytime you trust someone  
You end up getting screwed  
  
The more things change  
The more they stay the same  
Everyones your brother till you turn the other way  
The more things change  
The more they stay the same  
All we needs a miracle to take us all away from the pain  
  
Came to this morning i was feeling mighty used  
Picked up the telephone but all i gots a major attitude  
Turned on the tv to the same old news  
Everybody thinks they got the answer to the same old blues  
  
Like a hot smokin pistol on a saturday night  
You gotta go for the throat  
You gotta fight for your life  
  
The more things change  
The more they stay the same  
Everyones your brother till you turn the other way  
The more things change  
The more they stay the same  
All we needs a miracle to take us all away from the pain  
Take me away  
  
Like a hot smokin pistol on a saturday night  
You gotta go for the throat  
You gotta fight for your life  
  
The more things change  
The more they stay the same  
Everyones your brother till you turn the other way  
The more things change  
The more they stay the same  
All we needs a miracle to take us all away  
  
The more things change  
The more they stay the same  
Everyones your brother till you turn the other way  
The more things change  
The more they stay the same  
All we needs a miracle  
  
The more things change  
The more things change  
The more things change  
The more things change  
The more things change  
The more things change  
The more things change
