Theres a pale winter moon in the sky coming through my window  
And the park is laid out like a bed below  
Its a cold dark night and my heart melts like the snow  
And the bells of New York City tell me not to go  
  
Its always this time of year that my thoughts undo me  
With the ghosts of many lifetimes all abound  
But from these mad heights I can always hear the sound  
Of the bells of New York City singing all around  
  
Stay with me stay with me  
Refuge from these broken dreams  
Wait right here oh wait with me  
On silent snow filled streets  
  
Sing to me one song for joy and one for redemption  
And whatever is in between that I call mine  
With the street lamp light to illuminate the gray  
And the bells of New York City calling me to stay  
The bells of New York City calling me to stay
