Down In The Depths  
by Cole Porter  
  
With a million neon rainbows burning below me  
And a million blazing taxis raising a roar  
Here I sit above the town  
In my petpaillated gown  
Down in the depths  
of the ninetieth floor  
While the crowds in all the nightclubs punish the parquet  
And the bars are packed with couples calling for more  
Im deserted and depressed  
In my regaleagle nest  
Down in the depths  
of the ninetieth floor  
When the only one you wanted wants another  
Whats the use of swank and cash in the bank galore  
Why even the janitors wife  
Has a perfectly good love life  
And here I am facing tomorrow  
Alone in my sorrow  
Down in the depths  
of the ninetieth floor
