They say everything can be replaced  
Yet every distance is not near  
So I remember every face  
Of every man who put me here  
  
I see the light come shining  
From the west unto the east  
Any day now any day now  
I shall be released  
  
They say every man needs protection  
They say every man must fall  
Yet I swear I see my reflection  
Some place too high above this wall  
  
Now yonder standing me in this lonely crowd  
A man who swears hes not to blame  
ALl day long I hear his voice shouting so loud  
Crying out that he was framed  
  
I see the light come shining  
From the west unto the east  
Any day now any day now  
I shall be released
