I thought that my first love would be my wife  
But in junior high she moved away from here  
And I thought Johnny would always be my best friend  
I havent talked to him in fifteen years  
Back when I had those fights with my old man  
I never thought hed be an old man  
  
And I didnt know all those years ago  
How the years would go flying by  
Thought I knew it all  
But I was wrong  
And I didnt know I didnt know it at the time  
  
I never thought good jobs were hard to find  
Til I let my pride cost me one  
I never thought my whole life would change  
Til I heard the doctor say I had a son  
I never really thought that I was lost  
Til I heard my dying mother sing Old Rugged Cross  
  
And I didnt know all those years ago  
How the years would go flying by  
Thought I knew it all  
But I was wrong  
And I didnt know I didnt know it at the time  
  
Oh I thought I knew it all  
Oh but I was wrong  
And I didnt know I didnt know it at the time  
  
I didnt know didnt know didnt know  
I didnt know  
Oh I didnt know
