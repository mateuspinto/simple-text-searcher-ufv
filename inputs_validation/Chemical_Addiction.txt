I was only 15 standout on the Ave  
Youre chasing a bad dream a luxury I never had  
Living my life in the box or sleepin in the trash  
Taking girls for the things I need like booze drugs and ass  
Get stoned daily survival in the war zone  
Yeah our teens meant everything alright  
Half rack smoking out till its all black  
Death trap watch me going blind oh  
I dont care what you say I  
Or what you do  
Chemical addiction is  
Getting rid of you  
So high colors turn to sound  
Goodbye let us in and well lay you in the ground  
Chosen on the floor take another drag  
Bought a bunch of valiums from skinny broadway bag  
I dont know much about heroin but I I wanna try  
Just about everything once before I die  
Get stoned daily survival in the war zone  
Yeah our teens meant everything alright  
Half rack smoking out till its all black  
Death trap watch me going blind oh  
I dont care what you say I  
Or what you do  
Chemical addiction is  
Getting rid of you  
So high colors turn to sound  
Goodbye let us in and well lay you in the ground  
Now Jerry do me like this  
Get stoned daily survival in the war zone  
Yeah our teens meant everything alright  
Half rack smoking out till its all black  
Death trap watch me going blind oh
