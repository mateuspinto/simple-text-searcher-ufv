Show your friends that you and me  
Belong to the same world  
Turned on to the same word

Living all your life at ease

A look down lifes hallways doorways  
To lead you there

Scatter good seed in the fields  
Lifes ours for the making  
Eternitys waiting waiting

Show your friends that you and me  
Belong to the same world  
Turned on to the same word  
Have you heard
