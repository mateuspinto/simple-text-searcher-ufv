Sometimes I wanna quit this song and become an accountant now  
But Im no good at math and besides the dollar is down  
Plant palm trees on Lake Michigan before it gets cold  
I gotta feel the wind chill again before I get old  
  
I wanna scream I love you from the top of my lungs  
But Im afraid that someone else will hear me  
You can only blame your problems on my world for so long  
Before it all becomes the same old song  
As soon as we hit the hospital I know were gonna leave this town  
And get new passports and get get get get get out now  
  
All the yes men said no comment  
My mouth got going wrong way and all the calls started to roll in  
Like the time my dad caught me a horseshoe crab  
And I asked him if throwing it back into the sea would bring our luck back  
  
I wanna scream I love you from the top of my lungs  
But Im afraid that someone else will hear me  
You can only blame your problems on my world for so long  
Before it all becomes the same old song  
As soon as we hit the hospital I know were gonna leave this town  
And get new passports get out now  
  
Tell that boy I leave you alone  
Like a storm I ll turn my love  
Suprah and the profit are both in the business of souls  
  
I wanna scream I love you from the top of my lungs  
But Im afraid that someone else will hear me  
Whoa I wanna scream I love you from the top of my lungs  
But Im afraid that someone else will hear me  
You can only blame your problems on my world for so long  
Before it all becomes the same old song  
As soon as we hit the hospital I know were gonna leave this town  
I know were gonna leave this town  
And get new passports and get get get get get out  
Get get get get get out now
