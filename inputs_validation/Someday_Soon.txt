Someday soon someday soon  
Seasons were made for the change  
You will be there  
Just like the night to the day without a care  
The dark goes before the dawn  
Open up your eyes  
  
Someday soon  
Ooh therell be a better day  
And someday soon  
Yes its not too far away  
  
Someday soon  
Ooh yeah with open skies  
And someday soon  
All we can do is try  
  
The cloudiest day comes around  
You will be there  
All of the feelins youve found without a care  
So my friends you take a look  
Dont you look too far  
  
Someday soon  
Ooh yeah with open skies  
And someday soon  
All we can do is try  
  
Someday someday someday soon  
someday someday soon  
Someday someday soon  
Someday soon  
Someday soon  
Someday soon
