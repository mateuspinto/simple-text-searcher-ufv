They knew all along  
Theyre not dumb they were so wrong  
Shes not always fun  
Hate it now call when Im done  
  
Pieces fell in place  
Puzzles suck laugh in my face  
Turn and swing the pace  
Ill give this keep the good waist  
  
Head is on  
I want out  
Im alone and Im an easy target  
Metronome  
I want out  
Im alone and Im an easy target  
  
Crazy TV dreams might be true  
Not what it seems  
Food and cavities chewing words  
Tear at the seams  
He dont feel so good dont feel bad  
Not that he should  
I dont feel so good dont feel bad  
Not that I should  
  
Did you ever listen  
Get out
