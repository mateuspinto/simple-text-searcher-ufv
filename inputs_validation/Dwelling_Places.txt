Lovely are Your dwelling places  
Thirsty I come after You  
Jesus my joy my reward Your loves restoring my soul  
Now Im Yours and You are mine  
And from my heart a song will rise  
  
Chorus  
I love You I love You I love You x3  
And my heart will follow wholly after You  
  
Jesus theres none besides you  
Righteous ruler of the earth  
Nations will come and bow down  
Name above all names I sing You praises  
And all I can say to you is
