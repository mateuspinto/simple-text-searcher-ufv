Coming down again coming down again  
Coming down again coming down again  
  
Share your thoughts theres nothing you can hide  
She was dying to survive  
I was caught oh taken for a ride  
She was showing no surprise  
  
Coming down again coming down again  
Where are all my friends coming down again  
  
Coming down again coming down again  
On the ground again coming down again  
  
Slipped my tongue in someone elses pie  
Tasting better evry time  
She turned green and tried to make me cry  
Being hungry it aint no crime  
  
Coming down again coming down again  
All my times been spent coming down again
