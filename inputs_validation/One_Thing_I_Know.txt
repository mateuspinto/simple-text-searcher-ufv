Something in your eyes I see  
Reminds me of what used to be  
When I was still uncertain of the truth  
Sleepless nights that turned to days  
Alone inside an endless space  
Counting on someone to see me through  
  
And if theres one thing I know  
Its that you were never left alone  
Cause you can always on Jesus name  
And if theres one thing I pray  
  
Its that Jesus helps you find a way  
To make a change and listen to your heart  
God will take away your pain  
If you choose to let it go  
If theres one thing I know  
  
How can I convince your heart  
His light can find you in the dark  
And only He can make your blind eyes see  
  
For if we speak of lost things found  
Or lives that have been turned around  
Then tell me who knows better child than me  
  
And if theres one thing I know  
Its that you were never left alone  
Cause you can always on Jesus name  
And if theres one thing I pray  
  
Its that Jesus helps you find a way  
To make a change and listen to your heart  
God will take away your pain  
If you choose to let it go  
If theres one thing I know  
  
I would never state my life on any lesser thing  
Then the cross of Christ where  
He gave His life to ease my suffering  
  
And if theres one thing I know  
Its that you were never left alone  
Cause you can always on Jesus name  
And if theres one thing I pray  
  
Its that Jesus helps you find a way  
To make a change and listen to your heart  
God will take away your pain  
If you choose to let it go  
If theres one thing I know
