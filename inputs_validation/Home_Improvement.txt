The walls that surround us are slowly crumblin down  
But the heart of this foundation is still on solid ground  
Just need some renovation and a lot of TLC  
And a long night of lovin is all that we both need  
  
So roll the shades down  
Lock the doors up tight turn on the codeaphone  
If the door bell rings  
Well just stay in bed and pretend nobodys home  
Let the neighbors think we moved away or forgot to pay the rent  
There aint nothing wrong with this old house  
It just needs a little home improvement  
  
Every day we go our separate ways  
To make our dreams come true  
But it aint worth the sacrifice  
If were giving up me and you  
We gotta hold on tighter than tight  
To the lies that make us strong  
And get back to the roots  
That made this house a home  
  
So roll the shades down  
Lock the doors up tight turn on the codeaphone  
If the door bell rings  
Well just stay in bed and pretend nobodys home  
Let the neighbors think we moved away or forgot to pay the rent  
There aint nothing wrong with this old house  
It just needs a little home improvement  
  
So roll the shades down  
Lock the doors up tight turn on the codeaphone  
If the door bell rings  
Well just stay in bed and pretend nobodys home  
Let the neighbors think we moved away or forgot to pay the rent  
There aint nothing wrong with this old house  
It just needs a little home improvement
