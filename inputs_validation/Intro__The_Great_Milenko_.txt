Pumpkin put some music on I feel like dancin  
Hold on suga Im fixin to right now 3 6 4 awright now come over here  
Woman lets get this shindig started woo Cmon everybody  
Now what in the hell is wrong with this juke machine   
  
Be warned my children six will visit followed by the crumbling of time  
Itself Before the coming of Shangra La a dark Carnival will sweep across  
The land as a shadow plagued with destruction A parade of freaks  
Jugglers and death This wretched nightmare is led by six faces Three have  
Come three have gone The fourth emerges now He walks among  
Us as a shadow void of light powered by your own darkness strengthened by  
Your own wickedry A horrid reflection of your very own deep desires cast  
And reflected back upon yourself Brothers and Sisters The time has come  
For the Necromaster The unleashing of the fourth jokers card The arrival  
Of The Great Milenko Milenko Milenko   
  
This damn thing Maryanne what in the hell is wrong with this music box  
Dont mind that old thing honey it does that all the time
