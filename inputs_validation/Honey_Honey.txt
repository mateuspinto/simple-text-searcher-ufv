When I got misery oh my where are you honey  
Honey oh honey honey where can you be  
Whisperin when the lights are low to each  
Teardrop on my pillow  
Honey honey honey honey where are you  
I crossed the scalds in dessert just to be where  
You are  
I want you need you love you but still were apart  
When I want to hold you oh my where are you  
Honey honey my honey honey where can you be  
  
When I want to hold you oh my where are you  
Honey honey my honey honey where can you be
