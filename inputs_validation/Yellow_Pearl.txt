We all must beware of the yellow pearl  
The Yellow Pearl control attack attack attack attack  
Yellow Pearl  
It is foolish to venture into strange enchanted places  
If they arent the places you want to be  
Attack attack attack attack attack attack attack  
Is what we lack  
We will arise  
We will control  
We will command  
We will patrol  
It is foolish under the guise of love and liberty  
That we should capitalize and rob and fell  
The poor for the socialistic tree  
We will arise  
We will control  
Attack attack attack attack attack attack attack  
Is what we lack  
Thats what you lack  
We shall arise  
They will arise  
We shall control  
They will control  
We shall command  
They will command  
We shall patrol  
They will patrol  
We must fight back  
We will arise  
They will arise  
We will control  
We are now living in a situation  
Where that self same situation depends on the Yellow Pearl  
Attack attack attack attack attack attack attack  
Is what we lack  
We will arise  
They will arise  
We will control  
They will control  
We will command  
They shall command  
We will patrol  
They will patrol  
Arise  
Yellow Pearls upon us now  
We must fight back  
We will arise  
They will arise  
We will control  
Attack attack attack attack attack attack attack  
Is what we lack  
Is what we lack  
Dont trust in Liberty  
To save your soul  
It is genocide to let liberty lose control  
Control  
We must decide  
Control  
We the Yellow Pearl we will control
