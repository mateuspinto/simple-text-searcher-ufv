I hear footsteps slowly walking  
As they gently walk across a lonely floor  
And a voice is softly saying  
Darling this will be goodbye for ever more  
  
Chorus  
  
There goes my reason for living  
There goes the one of my dreams  
There goes my only possession  
There goes my everything  
  
As my memory turns back the pages  
I can see the happy years we had before  
Now the love that kept this old heart beating  
Has been shattered by the closing of the door
