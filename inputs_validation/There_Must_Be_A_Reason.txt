There must be a reason for raindrops to fall  
There must be a reason why mountains are tall  
And why are the stars in the sky  
There must be a reason why  
There must be a reason for rivers to flow  
For beautiful trees and flowers to grow  
And why have the birds wings to fly  
There must be a reason why  
The changes from season to season  
The dawning that brings the new day  
These wonders mist all have a reason  
It was intended that way  
There must be a reason for falling in love  
It must have been planned up in Heaven above  
And why are we so much in love you and I  
There must be a reason why  
The changes from season to season  
The dawning that brings the new day  
These wonders mist all have a reason  
It was intended that way  
There must be a reason for falling in love  
It must have been planned up in Heaven above  
And why are we so much in love you and I  
There must be a reason why  
There must be a reason why
