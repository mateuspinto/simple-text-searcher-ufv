Cast away on a desert island  
Me and poor Crusoe are sharing the same fate  
Cast away on a desert island  
With Great Britain written on its name plate  
With my umbrella I go walking  
Through all the sands on a building site  
Across the shopping malls and motorways  
Birds from Heathrow fill the  
Night with people flying to escape  
Friday comforts me and says its pay day  
Cast away on a desert island  
The game and coconuts is plentiful  
You pick em right off of a supermarket shelf  
And all the maneaters are parked away  
Down in garages  
While their selfish owners drinking to escape  
Lord of flies with cocktails in his conch shell  
Dont rescue me no  
This is my home sweet home dear  
Dont rescue me no  
I am far from alone here  
Cast away on a desert island  
Me and one nation are sharing the same fate  
Cast away on a desert island  
With Great Britain written on its name plate  
Cast away on a desert island
