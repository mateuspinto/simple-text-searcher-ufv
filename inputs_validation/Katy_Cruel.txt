When i first came to town  
They called me the roving jewel  
Now theyve changed their tune  
They call me katy cruel  
Oh diddle day oh diddle lie o day  
  
  
Oh that i was where i would be  
Then i would be where i am not  
Here i am where i must be  
Go where i would i can not  
Oh diddle day oh diddle lie o day  
  
  
When i first came to town  
They brought me the bottles plenty  
Now theyve changed their tune  
They bring me the bottles empty  
Oh diddle day oh diddle lie o day  
  
  
Chorus  
  
  
I know who i love  
And i know who does love me  
I know where im going  
And i know whose going with me  
Oh diddle day oh diddle lie o day  
  
  
Chorus  
  
  
Down the road i go  
And through the boggy mire  
Straight way cross the field  
And to my hearts desire  
Oh diddle day oh diddle lie o day  
  
  
Chorus
