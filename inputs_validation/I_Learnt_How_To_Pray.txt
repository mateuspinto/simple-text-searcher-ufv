Shes been good to me  
And her aim is plain  
With an open mind  
And a tender way  
As she looks through boxes of secondhand clothes  
Shes a first class person as her best friend knows  
Shes been good to me  
Helped me not to lie  
Listens to my words  
And the truth she finds  
As I fell in love with my very best friend  
I didnt realise that our friendship would end  
I learnt how to pray  
Every night  
To relieve the pain  
Deep inside  
  
I was serious with a furrowed brow  
I just fell in love what do I do now  
As I fell in love with my very best friend  
I didnt realise that our friendship would end  
  
It didnt work for us the lesson I learnt  
The fire was lit and I got burnt  
And I fell in love with my very best friend  
I didnt realise that our friendship would end
