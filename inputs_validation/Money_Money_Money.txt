Don t tell me love makes the world go round  
That is how it used to be  
So many years ago yeah  
These days we re living in  
Everything needs a dollar  
These days we re living in  
Everything needs some money  
You can t get no love without the dollar  
You can t get no justice without the dollar  
So everything is  
  
Chorus  
Money money money  
  
Judge dread I know I ve done something wrong here  
And today you re here  
To put me away forever  
But before you bring that hammer down  
Look what I have in my hand  
Yeah the wheels of justice  
They turn so slow  
But with this we can make them turn faster  
Than a rocket in my favour  
Doesnt matter what they say  
Ive done here today  
Just look the other way  
Like you always do  
When you see  
  
Chorus till fade
