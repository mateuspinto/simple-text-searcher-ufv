She dreams of nineteen sixtynine  
Before the soldiers came  
The life was cheap on bread and wine  
And sharing meant no shame  
She is awakened by the screams  
Of rockets flying from nearby  
And scared she clings onto her dreams  
To beat the fear that she might die  
  
And who will have won  
When the soldiers have gone  
From the Lebanon  
The Lebanon  
  
Before he leaves the camp he stops  
He scans the world outside  
And where there used to be some shops  
Is where the snipers sometimes hide  
He left his home the week before  
He thought hed be like the police  
But now he finds he is at war  
Werent we supposed to keep the peace  
  
And who will have won  
When the soldiers have gone  
From the Lebanon  
The Lebanon  
The Lebanon  
From the Lebanon  
  
I must be dreaming  
It cant be true  
I must be dreaming  
It cant be true  
  
And who will have won  
When the soldiers have gone  
From the Lebanon  
The Lebanon  
The Lebanon  
From the Lebanon
