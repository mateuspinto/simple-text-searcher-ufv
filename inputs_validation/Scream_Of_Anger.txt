I wont live to see tomorrow  
There wont be another prayer  
None of them will ever sorrow  
Those whove sentenced me to death  
  
Ive been waiting here for ages  
For the hangman to appear the hangman to appear  
Soon the priest will read some pages  
From the Bible for my fear  
  
I see a place  
An evil place  
Coming my way  
What can I do  
Where can I run  
Gonna die anyway  
Things are getting clearer  
This is the price I have to pay  
Oh no  
  
I feel like screaming out my anger  
There is so much left here to do  
When it happened I was younger  
And my destiny was you  
  
I see a place  
An evil place  
Coming my way  
What can I do  
Where can I run  
Gonna die anyway  
Things are getting clearer  
This is the price I have to pay  
  
And what can I do about leaving you  
We were only halfway through  
And what can I say there was no other way  
They wouldnt let me stay
