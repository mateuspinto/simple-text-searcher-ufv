I remember the first war the way the sky burned  
The faces of angels destroyed  
I saw a third of Heavens legion banished  
And the creation of hell  
I stood with my brothers and watched Lucifer fall  
But now my brothers arent my brothers  
  
Turned away by a misrepresentation  
Stained glass and white washed tombs  
The hearts of those who spoke to you  
Were never homes the God they tried to show you  
They spoke out of prejudice and ritualism  
They themselves were lost angels fold their wings  
And they fold their wings  
And weep along with us watching you shun Christs sacrifice  
Shunning sacrifice  
And they fold their wings  
And weep along with us watching you shun  
  
Shun
