Space monkey space monkey  
What you doing out there  
Why its dark as a dungeon way up in the air  
Come gather round me you little monkeys and a story Ill tell  
About a brave young primate outer space knew him well  
He was born at the top of a big old tree  
Way back in 1953  
He could swing through the jungle and hang by his toes  
Till they took him to russia cause they could I suppose  
They dressed him up in a spacesuit and it started to snow  
Shot him off in a rocket where no man would go  
Space monkey space monkey  
What you doing out there  
Why its dark as a dungeon way up in the air  
Therell be no one to greet you when you get back home  
No hammer or sickle youll be on your own  
He had plenty of cuban bananas and loads of spam  
But he found great difficulty trying to open the can  
One day he slipped on a banana peel and the ship lost control  
It spun out of orbit and shot out the black hole  
Its been four decades now thats nine monkey years  
Thats a long time for a space monkey to confront all his fears  
Space monkey space monkey  
What you doing out there  
Why its dark as a dungeon way up in the air  
Therell be no one to greet you when you get back home  
No hammer or sickle youll be all on your own  
Space monkey space monkey  
Its time to get real  
The space race is over how does it feel  
Cold wars had a heatwave iron curtains torn down  
Theyve rolled up the carpet in space monkey town  
Now leningrad is petersburg and petersburgs hell  
For a cardcarrying monkey with a story to tell  
The space monkey was reportedly last sighted about  
A half a block off of red square  
In a karaoke bar having a few drinks with some of his friends  
There was the dog that flew sputnik  
And a blind redheaded one legged parrot  
Who had done some minor research for dow chemical  
They were drinking american vodka  
Imported all the way from paducah kentucky  
And reportedly had their arms around each others  
Shoulders singing  
those were the days my friend we thought theyd never end  
Space monkey space monkey  
Theres nothing to do  
But its better than living in a communist zoo  
Therell be no one to greet you when you get back home  
No hammer or sickle youll be all on you own
