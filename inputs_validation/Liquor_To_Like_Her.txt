It takes a whole lot of liquor  
To like her  
Thats why I drink all the time  
It takes a whole lot of liquor  
To like her  
But when Im liquored up  
I like her just fine  
  
She wants to tell me where to go  
Tell me what to do  
Tell me what to eat  
And how loud I can chew  
She even wants to tell me  
What thoughts I oughta think  
It used to drive me crazy  
Till it drove me to drink  
  
It takes a whole lot of liquor  
To like her  
Thats why I drink all the time  
It takes a whole lot of liquor  
To like her  
But when Im liquored up  
I like her just fine  
  
Well shes such a pretty thing  
Youd think shes heaven sent  
Shes the quarrelsome kind  
Loves an argument  
She could yell all day  
She can scream all night  
I just sit there smilin  
As high as a kite  
  
It takes a whole lot of liquor  
To like her  
Thats why I drinking all the time  
It takes a whole lot of liquor  
To like her  
But when Im liquored up  
I like her just fine  
  
This drinking buddy of mine  
Said he met a girl  
Said she was the meanest  
Woman in the world  
I saw her pretty picture  
I said man your poking fun  
Then the day I met her  
I said pour me one  
  
It takes a whole lot of liquor  
To like her  
Thats why I drink all the time  
It takes a whole lot of liquor  
To like her  
But when Im liquored up  
I like her just fine  
  
You may look down your nose at me  
Think Im an old sorry  
Son of a bean  
The only way Im giving up  
My drinking glass is if I can  
Find a way to get her off my back  
  
Spoken Your wifes on the phone  
  
Little brown jug upon my lips  
Your saving our love  
With every sip  
  
It takes a whole lot of liquor  
To like her  
Thats why I drink all the time  
It takes a whole lot of liquor  
To like her  
But when Im liquored up  
I like her just fine  
  
Every time I get sober  
She drives me out of my mind  
It takes a whole lot of liquor  
To like her  
But when Im liquored up  
I like her just fine  
  
But when Im liquored up  
I like her just fine  
  
But when Im liquored up  
Hell I love her
