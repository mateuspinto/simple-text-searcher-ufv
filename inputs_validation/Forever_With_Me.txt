Looking over the horizon night breaks into dawn  
I get a little misty eyed knowing youve gone on  
Ive come to realize just how much your presence meant to me  
I also realize that now youre finally free  
Ill always love you for the special times we shared  
All the times you let me know just how much you cared for me  
Ill always love you you were a friend that I could totally depend on  
I love you and youre forever with me  
The will of the father had to be fulfilled  
I feel your spirit your voice still gives me chills  
The anointing is still touching today  
I wrote this with a smile and tears of joy just to say  
Ill always love you for the special times we shared  
All the times you let me know just how much you cared for me  
Ill always love you you were a friend that I could totally depend on  
I love you youre forever with me  
We used to sing together cry together and laugh together  
You said it didnt matter for God would always take care  
You taught me how to give again when giving seemed to be too hard  
The benefits of your love were my reward  
And I love you for the special times we shared  
All the times you showed me how much you care for me  
Ill always love you you were a friend that I could totally depend on  
I love you youre forever with me  
I love you yeah youre forever with me  
I love you oh youre forever with me I love youre forever with me  
I could always depend on you I love you youre forever with me  
I love you Im gonna miss you youre forever here with me
