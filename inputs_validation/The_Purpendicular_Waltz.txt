Put your money down  
Take your choice  
Thats the way it is  
Every time with these boys  
And you sense no shame  
And you feel no disgrace  
Somebody wins  
Somebody loses  
Its a dirty dirty race  
Oh my life  
Its a dogs life  
  
One empty Monday  
Out of the blue  
Took a good luck turn  
Started something new  
Out of the gutter  
Out of the rain  
Out of my head  
And Im feeling no pain  
Oh my life  
feeling no pain  
Take the strain  
Its a dogs life  
  
Ducking in the shadows  
Diving in the dark  
Rolling with the punches  
Striking at the heart  
Touching all the senses  
Breaking those taboos  
Bursting at the seams  
Blowing all my fuses  
  
The turning of a page  
The burning of a book  
If youre talking out of turn  
Its just the way you look  
  
When the time is right  
But the shape is wrong  
And you find yourself  
Where you dont belong  
Back to reality  
Back on the line  
Back into this and youll feel no pain  
You wanna do it one more time  
We can do it once again  
Oh my life  
Its a dogs life
