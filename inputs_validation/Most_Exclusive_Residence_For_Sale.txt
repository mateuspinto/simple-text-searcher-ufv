It was the biggest house in the neighborhood  
He went and bought this house when he made good  
Ten bedrooms and a swimming pool  
Where he entertained all the people that he knew  
But he hit the hard times and had to sell out  
Most exclusive residence for sale  
He went and spent all the money that he had  
Because he had a heart and not a head  
He spent it all on girls and fancy jewelry  
Then he found himself in front of a judge and jury  
And the judge said to pay up our you must sell out  
Most exclusive residence for sale  
He had to tell all the servants to go away  
Couldnt even afford to pay their way  
He took to the bottle and drunk himself down  
Then he soaked away all the troubles and let them drown  
Then he saw a notice on the wall  
Most exclusive residence for sale  
Most exclusive residence for sale  
Lalalalalalalalalala
