Ride ride ride ride up from hell  
  
Armed with magic sons of demons and men  
This song of greeting written for your tragic end  
So long our stride the world doth tremble with fear  
Black winds blow where we ride near  
Maim and kill them take the women and children  
  
Hot pitch and chain take to the air  
Our ramming blades lay their ships hold bare  
Steel meets steel axes broadsword and shield  
Their heads ride our spears and bodies cover the fields  
Maim and kill them take the women and children  
  
Fallen brother as I hold closed your side  
I fear this wound your last  
Mighty earth now doth drink your blood  
And I remember days long past  
Your sacrifice so great rest now take thy sleep  
For you shall not awake let revenge be sweet  
For when we march your sword rides with me  
For when we march your sword rides with me  
For when we march your sword rides with me  
For when we march your sword rides with me  
  
You who killed my brother and all who take your side  
This be your last hour Let your steel be tried  
Now turn to face me upon the timeless plane  
Kill me if you can  
  
Death is life  
  
By the full moon they rise from their graves  
Through seas of blood fighting with hell bent rage  
Swear the creed of unity by the circle of blood  
We are one we know not fear Born to fight not run  
Maim and kill them take the women and children
