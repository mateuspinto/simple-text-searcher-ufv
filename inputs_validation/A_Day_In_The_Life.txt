I read the news today oh boy  
About a lucky man who made the grave  
And though the news was rather sad  
Well I just had to laugh  
I saw the photograph  
He blew his mind out in a car  
He didnt notice that the lights had changed  
A crowd of people stood and stared  
Theyd seen his face before  
Nobody was really sure  
If he was from the House of Lords  
  
I saw a film today oh boy  
The English Army had just won the war  
A crowd of people turned away  
but I just had to look  
Having read the book  
Id love to turn you on  
  
Woke up fell out of bed  
Dragged a comb across my head  
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup  
And looking up I noticed I was late  
Found my coat and grabbed my hat  
Made the bus in second splat  
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke  
and Somebody spoke and I went into a dream  
  
I read the news today oh boy  
Four thousand holes in Blackburn Lancashire  
And though the holes were rather small  
They had to count them all  
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall  
Id love to turn you on
