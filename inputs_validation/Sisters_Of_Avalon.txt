Felt someone calling me into the howling of the wind  
I heard the reflection of a sound echoing through my skin   
And a distant drum rumbling under ground gently guides me on   
Through my wild heart   
Whispering to me the Sisters Of Avalon  
Sisters Of AvalonSisters Of Avalon  
  
She is awakening in dark swells and mystery  
Unbridled night mares powerful and running free  
You could still hear her cries reverberating through the trees  
For the trampled flowers the daughters of Eve the Sisters of Avalon  
Sisters Of AvalonSisters Of Avalon  
  
They brought her in in a new white dress  
But the stain left an ache on her mothers breast  
Now all thats left are the ghostly steps from a distant corridor  
  
And a distant drum rumbling under ground gently guides me on   
Through my wild heart   
Whispering to me the Sisters Of Avalon  
Sisters Of Avalon  
Come on sisterscome on sister
