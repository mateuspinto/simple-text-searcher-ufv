Travelin Light is the only way to fly  
Travelin Light just you and I  
Way on down to ecstasy  
Way on down and our own way  
Travelin Light is the only way to fly  
  
Travelin Light and you can catch the wind  
Travelin Light better let your mind pretend  
Get on down to paradise  
Maybe once now maybe twice  
Travelin Light is the only way to fly  
  
Get on down to paradise  
Maybe once now maybe twice  
Travelin Light is the only way to fly
