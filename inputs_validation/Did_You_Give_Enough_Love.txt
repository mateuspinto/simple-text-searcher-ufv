You say you still dont know the reason  
Why I walked away  
I know you thought you were so good to me  
I didnt see it that way  
My loves not something you can buy and sell  
Like pearls on a string  
And if you want to know where we went wrong  
You ought to stop and think  
  
Did you give enough love Did you show that you cared  
When I needed understanding were you really there  
Whenever I was down did you try to pick me up  
Maybe you should ask yourself  
Did you give enough love  
  
Good intentions you know I had  
Right from the start  
But if you wonder why we didnt last  
Just look inside your heart  
  
Did you give enough love Did you show that you cared  
When I needed understanding were you really there  
Whenever I was down did you try to pick me up  
Maybe you should ask yourself  
Did you give enough love  
  
Did you give enough time when I was alone  
When I needed you there to make me feel I belonged  
You just dont know what you did to me  
I just had to be free  
  
Did ya did ya did ya give enough  
Did ya did ya did ya give enough  
  
Did you give enough love Did you show that you cared  
When I needed understanding were you really there  
Whenever I was down did you try to pick me up  
Maybe you should ask yourself  
Did you give enough love
