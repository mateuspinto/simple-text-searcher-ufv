Do you remember our place where we used to meet  
Down by the sea  
And all the crazy plans we made  
And the promises we swore to keep  
I was young and so were you  
But we both could feel our love was true  
There was nothing in this world  
That we couldnt do Oh  
  
Ill go back in time to when you were mine  
I would trade my life for one more summer with you  
Ill erase my mind if I could rewind  
I would trade my life for one more summer with you  
  
Do you remember all the songs that you used to play  
And I used to write and all the fantasies we had  
Of becoming stars over a night  
Now I am here and I am proud of  
What Ive acheved on my own  
But succes can not replace ou and without you  
Im no one  
  
Ill go back  
  
I found my love when I was seventeen  
And you you were on fire the queen of my heart  
And we we were on fire fire invincible tearm  
And we promised we would never part  
But then one day in the beginning of fall  
When the rain pushed the summer away  
I went back to our place and you were gone  
They told me that you left that same day  
  
Oh Oh  
  
Ill go back
