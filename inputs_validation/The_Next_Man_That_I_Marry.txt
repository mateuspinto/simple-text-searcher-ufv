The last face that I looked on  
Cant recall too much about  
The image of it left me  
Each time the lights went out  
The last mind that I wandered  
I remember how I ran  
Just to find the road had ended  
Just where it began  
  
The next man that I marry  
There aint nothin he wont do  
Most likely love me too much  
  
The next hands that I hide in  
Will be warm and dry as smoke  
Just as satisfied to hold me  
As to dust my winter coat  
The next soul that I sleep in  
Will be soft as summer rain  
And when I need more lovin  
Hell love me once again  
  
The next man that I marry  
There aint nothin he wont do  
Most likely love me too much  
  
The next man that I marry  
There aint nothin he wont do  
Most likely love me too much  
Just like you
