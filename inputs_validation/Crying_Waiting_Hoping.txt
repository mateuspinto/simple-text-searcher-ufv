Crying waiting hoping youll come back  
I just cant seem to get you off my mind  
Crying waiting hoping youll come back  
Youre the one I love I think about you all the time  
  
Crying do do do do tear keep a falling all night long  
Waiting do do do do it seems so useless I know its wrong  
Keep a crying waiting hoping youll come back  
Maybe someday soon itll change and youll be mine
