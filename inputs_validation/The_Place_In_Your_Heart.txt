Lost in a feeling  
And this distance between us  
I start believing  
These days were drifting apart  
Were leading separate lives  
Separately missing each other  
Its time that we face the light  
We cant go on pretending this way  
  
I want to get back to the place in your heart  
When we knew with a kiss  
How we felt from the start  
Can we still make it real  
As we lie in the dark  
Am I still there  
In the place in your heart  
  
When was the last time  
We were lost in the moment  
Seems like we cant find  
Oh the love that we used to share  
If I could take you there  
Could we surrender together  
Somewhere to begin again  
Oh it hurts just to go this way  
Yeah  
  
I want to get back to the place in your heart  
When we knew with a kiss  
How we felt from the start  
Can we still make it real  
As we lie in the dark  
Somewhere theres love  
Weve come this far  
Reach out your hand and Ill find where you are  
Am I still there  
In the place in your heart  
  
Times that I let you down  
You could have just walked away  
Yes I need your forgiveness now  
Dont say its too late yes  
  
I want to get back to the place in your heart  
When we knew with a kiss  
How we felt from the start  
Can we still make it real  
As we lie in the dark  
Somewhere theres love  
Weve come this far  
Reach out your hand and Ill find where you are  
Am I still there  
In the place in your heart  
  
Oh let me take you there  
Save a place for me baby  
Save a place in your heart  
Aw let me take you there  
Leaving
