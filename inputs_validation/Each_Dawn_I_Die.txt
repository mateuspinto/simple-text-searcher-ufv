Passing through the storm   
Led by demons  walk between the  
World of men and gods   
Cast no shadows  draw no light  
I rape the priestess on pagans night  
  
I taste the serpents poison  
On the lips of the one I love  
She brings this gift of witchcraft  
I wear the catskin gloves  
  
Apples of youth when I wrought  
Mischief hung in a tree to rot  
In the sun   
Reborn in the middle of the  
Final orgy  a gift of slavery  
To the chosen one  
  
Suicide Suicide dont you know  
Me  call to the Master  he will  
Come  He will bring our  
Resurrection  cloacked in darkness   
He has won  
  
Smoke of my sacrifice   
Journey to the Isle of the  
Blessed   
Grant my soul your glory  
At night time  Im your guest  
Only I know why   
  
Each dawn I die  
  
Smoke of my sacrifice   
Journey to the Isle of the  
Blessed   
Grant my soul your glory  
At night time  Im your guest  
Only I know why
