Chorus  
Love of money is the root of all evil  
Love of money is the root of all evil  
Love of money is the work of the devil  
Love of money  
She began running for the border and her life  
Like the wind straight into the terror of the night  
And she survived bargaining her body for their gold  
In the end all she had to sell them was her soul  
Thats the way it goes  
Chorus  
Love of money is the root of all evil  
Love of money is the root of all evil  
Love of money is the work of the devil  
Love of money  
We began reaching for the future like a dream  
In a land where everything was free  
Wordly men turned their profits into war  
No one knows who were really fighting for  
Chorus  
Love of money is the root of all evil  
Love of money is the root of all evil  
Love of money is the work of the devil  
Love of money  
Chorus  
Love of money is the root of all evil  
Love of money is the root of all evil  
Love of money is the work of the devil  
Love of money
