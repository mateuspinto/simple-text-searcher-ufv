Going back to Alabama  
  
Going back to Alabama  
Now that Ive learned the thing too  
Life with me aint been so easy  
But Ive got some living yet to do  
  
Cos a man who walks by the side of the road  
Can turn himself around  
He can pick himself fast just himself fast  
And start all over again my friend  
  
Some days I didnt wanna wake up in the morning  
My family and friends were all down on me  
I tried to tell em where I was going  
But they never saw the man I saw in me  
  
Some folks called me a dreamer  
Other folks left and called me a fool  
All I ever wanted to be was a winner  
cos I know a winner can never lose  
  
Cos a man who walks
