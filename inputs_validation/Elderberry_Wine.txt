Theres a fly in the window  
A dog in the yard  
And a year since I saw you  
Theres a trunk in the corner  
I keep all my letters  
My bills and demands I keep too  
  
Well I cant help thinking  
About the times  
You were a wife of mine  
You aimed to please me  
Cooked blackeyed peasme  
Made elderberry wine  
  
Chorus  
Drunk all the time  
Feeling fine on elderberry wine  
Those were the days  
Wed lay in the haze  
Forget depressive times  
How can I ever get it together  
Without a wife in line  
To pick the crop and get me hot  
On elderberry wine  
  
Round a tree in the summer  
A fire in the fall  
Flat out when they couldnt stand  
The bottle went round  
Like a woman down south  
Passed on from hand to hand  
  
Chorus
