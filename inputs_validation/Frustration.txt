Frustration  
In my lexicon of hate  
I see you with your portraiture  
Does he love you  
Does he love you too  
  
The brush strokes  
Kiss your breasts and toes  
I cry icicles in my stein  
The heartbeats flutter  
With an abnormal rhythm  
  
The pain shoots through my body  
A sword between my thighs  
I wish that I could kill you  
But I too love your eyes  
  
Youre feeling less whore but you stimulate  
The hatred smolders in your eyes  
Id drop to my knees in a second  
To salivate in your thighs  
  
But all I do is fall over  
I dont have the strength I once had  
In you and your prickless lover  
And his easel in his eyes  
  
I feel the pain creep up my leg  
Blood runs from my nose  
I puke my guts out at your feet  
Youre more man than I  
To be dead to have no feeling  
To be dry and spermless like a girl  
I want so much to hurt you  
I want so much to hurt you  
I want so much to hurt you  
Marry me  
I want you as my wife  
  
Spermless like a girl  
More man than I  
More man than I

All I do is fall over

I want you so much to hurt you  
I want so much to hurt you  
I want so much to hurt you  
I want you as a wife

Puking my guts at your feet
