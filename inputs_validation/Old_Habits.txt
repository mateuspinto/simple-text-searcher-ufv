Well I kicked the habit of smoking back sometime ago  
And I tried the hard stuff but I had to let all that go  
But the toughest thing I ever gave up was today  
Cause Old Habits Like You are hard to break  
  
I chew lifesavers to help me get off ciggarates  
But you know for your love I aint found no lifesavers yet  
And Ive grown cold Turkey cause theres not even on kiss ad day  
And Old habits like you are hard to break  
  
Old habits like you are hard to break  
Love with someone new is so hard to make  
I had grown so use to your love and all of your ways  
  
And Old Habits Like You are hard to breakbla
