Innocence no answer  
To your breaking heart  
If the situation  
Sometimes falls apart  
  
Then in this ecstasy  
Your charms are frozen  
No emotion falling through your arms  
Morning daydream time still growing shorter  
  
Take me over lead me to the water  
To the rhythm of love  
The rhythm of love  
The rhythm of love  
  
Why should I escort you  
To your secret needs  
Climbing up your ladder  
I keep falling down  
  
Anyway will do  
Anyone will do  
When you dance to your darkest tune  
Surrounded  
  
As you crawl around the room  
Night time fever burning till youre higher  
Take me over lead me through the fire  
The rhythm of love  
  
To the rhythm of love  
The rhythm of love  
To the rhythm of love  
Morning daydream midnight fever  
  
Morning daydream midnight fever  
Inhibitions keep you from your point of view  
Information needing to confuse  
In this situation I have found you  
  
In the rhythm of  
Morning daydream midnight fever  
Morning daydream midnight fever  
Rhythm of love  
  
Rhythm of love  
To the rhythm of love  
Rhythm of love
