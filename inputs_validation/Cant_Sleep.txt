I woke the other day  
And saw my world has changed  
The past is over but tomorrows wishful thinking  
I cant hold onto whats been done  
I cant grab onto whats to come  
And Im just wishing I could stop but  
  
Life goes on  
Come of age  
Cant hold on  
Turn the page  
  
Time rolls on  
Wipe these eyes  
Yesterday laughs  
Tomorrow cries  
  
Memories are bittersweet  
The good times we cant repeat  
Those days are gone and we can never get them back  
Now we must move ahead  
Despite our fear and dread  
Were all just wishing we could stop but  
  
Life goes on  
Come of age  
Cant hold on  
Turn the page  
  
Time rolls on  
Wipe your eyes  
Yesterday laughs  
Tomorrow cries  
  
With all our joys and fears  
Wrapped in forgotten years  
The past is laughing as today just slips away  
Time tears down what weve made  
And sets another stage  
And Im just wishing we could stop  
  
Life goes on  
Come of age  
Cant hold on  
Turn the page  
  
Time rolls on  
Wipe these eyes  
Yesterday laughs  
Tomorrow cries
