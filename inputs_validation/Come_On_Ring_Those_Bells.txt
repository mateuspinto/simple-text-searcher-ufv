Everybody likes to take a holiday  
Everybody likes to take a rest  
Spending time together with the family  
Sharing lots of love and happiness  
  
Come on ring those bells  
Light the Christmas tree  
Jesus is the king  
Born for you and me  
Come on ring those bells  
Everybody sing  
Jesus we remember  
Its your birthday  
  
Celebrations come because of something new  
Celebrations we love to recall  
Mary had a baby born in Bethleham  
The greatest celebration of them all  
  
Come on ring those bells  
Light the Christmas tree  
Lord is the King  
Born for you and me  
Come on ring those bells  
Everybody sing  
O lord we remember  
This your birthday
