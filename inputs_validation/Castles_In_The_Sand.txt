Mm  
On the beach where young lovers meet  
You can see them there as they sit and build  
Castles in the sand  
  
Heavenly shes so heavenly  
When she smiles at you  
And she helps you build castles in the sand  
  
The time comes when you stop pretending  
For all dreams must come to an ending  
Remember what happens to castles of sand  
The sea will wash them away  
Oh  
  
And the beach where they used to meet  
By the sand and sea waves have washed away  
Castles in the sand  
Castles in the sand  
Where did they go  
Castles in the sand  
Tell me where did they go  
Castles in the sand  
I wanna know where did they go
