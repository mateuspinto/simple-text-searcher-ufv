Chorus  
Mr Recordman do you know who I am  
Mr Recordman do you really think I can  
  
Ive takin a likin to your game  
I think we all we feel the same  
Is this a dream or is it real  
You say you want to cut a deal  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont need much time to think about  
Im sure that you have got the clout  
I only hope that youre my friend  
And stand by me until the end  
  
Chorus  
  
Sell a lotta records n tour round the world  
Make a lotta money n meet lotsa girls  
Mr Recordman do you really think I can  
  
It sound like music to my ears  
Ive dreamed of this for many years  
  
Sell a lotta records n tour round the world  
Make a lotta money n meet lotsa girls  
Have a lot of fun and hang with my bros  
Cause these boys and this band is all that I know  
  
If not for the money and not for the show  
Are you here for me or here for the dough  
Mr Recordman do you really give a damn
