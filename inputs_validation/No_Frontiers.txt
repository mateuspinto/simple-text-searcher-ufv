If life is a river and your heart is a boat  
And just like a water baby baby born to float  
And if life is a wild wind that blows way on high  
And your heart is Amelia dying to fly  
  
Heaven knows no frontiers  
And Ive seen heaven in your eyes  
And if life is a bar room in which we must wait  
Round the man with his fingers on the ivory gates  
  
Where we sing until dawn of our fears and our fates  
And we stack all the deadmen in self addressed crates  
In your eyes faint as the singing of a lark  
That somehow this black night  
  
Feels warmer for the spark  
Warmer for the spark  
To hold us til the day  
When fear will lose its grip  
  
And heaven has its way  
Heaven knows no frontiers  
And Ive seen heaven in your eyes  
If your life is a rough bed of brambles and nails  
  
And your spirits a slave to mans whips and mans jails  
Where you thirst and you hunger for justice and right  
Then your heart is a pure flame of mans constant night  
In your eyes faint as the singing of a lark  
  
That somehow this black night  
Feels warmer for the spark  
Warmer for the spark  
To hold us til the day when fear will lose its grip  
  
And heaven has its way  
And heaven has its way  
When all will harmonise  
And know its in our hearts  
  
The dream will realise  
Heaven knows no frontiers  
And Ive seen heaven in your eyes  
Heaven knows no frontiers  
And Ive seen heaven in your eyes
