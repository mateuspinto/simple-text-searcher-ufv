I was scrapin bottom  
Gropin in the dark  
It takes a crusty punk to really beat  
The mean streets of Medicine Park  
So I shifted left for out of town  
Then I clicked my heels and I doubled down to  
  
Blues Beach  
Im frying  
Sizzlin in the merciful rays  
And its the long sad Sunday  
Of the early resigned  
  
I went to Central Station  
To catch that early bus  
They were gassed and runnin every which way  
But unhappily not for us  
Here comes Trina the child bride  
I said hey pretty girl can I cop a ride to  
  
Blues Beach  
Its rainin  
Im chillin at the Manatee Bar  
Well its a stone soul picnic  
For the early resigned  
  
We could rent a paranymphic glider  
My hypothetical friend  
And we could sail  
Til the bending end  
  
Grab Big Dog a blanket  
Angel of my heart  
Things may get a whole lot worse  
Before suddenly falling apart  
Give your roommate Yvonne a ring  
Cause if she still wants in I gotta pull some strings  
  
On Blues Beach  
Im dying  
Freezin in the merciful rays  
And its the long sad Sunday  
Of the early resigned
