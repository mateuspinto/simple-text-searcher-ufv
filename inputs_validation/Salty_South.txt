Mister pull up a chair  
I got time for tears  
Tell me all the stories that you never did  
Of the salty south  
The Seminoles held out  
While Geronimo died in a lonely jail  
  
A thousand tides and  
A thousand waves  
Takin it all away  
  
Itll come back in  
Well be gone by then  
And its a miracle we ever learned to live  
  
Drain that land  
For a better plan  
Sugarcane and the civil man  
But now the ringin dead them pines  
Planted in that time  
We gonna keep on killin till they get it right  
  
A thousand tides and  
A thousand waves  
Takin it all away  
  
Itll come back in  
Well be gone by then oh  
And its a miracle we ever learned to live  
  
I remember the wind  
As it was settlin  
And every sun goin down was a picture then  
But we look back at em framed  
They all look the same  
Theres no sense of time no sense of pain  
  
A thousand tides and  
A thousand waves  
Takin it all away  
  
And itll come back in  
Well be gone by then oh  
And its a miracle we ever learned to give
