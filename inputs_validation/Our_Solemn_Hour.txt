I speak to you for the first time as Prime Minister in a solemn hour for the
life of our country of our empire of our allies and above all of the
cause of Freedom  
  
Sanctus Espiritus redeem us from our solemn hour  
Sanctus Espiritus insanity is all around us  
Sanctus Espiritus Sanctus Espiritus Sanctus Espiritus  
  
In my darkest hours I could not foresee  
That the tide could turn so fast to this degree  
Cant believe my eyes  
How can you be so blind  
Is the heart of stone no empathy inside  
Time keeps on slipping away and we havent learned  
So in the end now what have we gained  
  
Sanctus Espiritus redeem us from our solemn hour  
Sanctus Espiritus insanity is all around us  
Sanctus Espiritus is this what we deserve  
Can we break free from chains of neverending agony  
  
Are they themselves to blame the misery the pain  
Didnt we let go allowed it let it grow  
If we cant restrain the beast which dwells inside  
It will find its way somehow somewhere in time  
Will we remember all of the suffering  
Cause if we fail it will be in vain  
  
Sanctus Espiritus redeem us from our solemn hour  
Sanctus Espiritus insanity is all around us  
Sanctus Espiritus is this what we deserve  
Can we break free from chains of neverending agony  
  
A tremendous battle is raging in France and Flanders The Germans by a
remarkable combination of air bombing and heavily armored tanks have broken
through the French defenses north of the Maginot Line and strong columns of
their armored vehicles are ravaging the open country which for the first day
or two was without defenders They have penetrated deeply and spread alarm and
confusion in their track  
  
Sanctus Espiritus redeem us from our solemn hour  
Sanctus Espiritus insanity is all around us  
Sanctus Espiritus is this what we deserve  
Can we break free from chains of neverending agony  
  
Sanctus Espiritus redeem us from our solemn hour Solem hour  
Sanctus Espiritus insanity is all around us All around us  
Sanctus Espiritus is this what we deserve  
Can we break free from chains of neverending agony
