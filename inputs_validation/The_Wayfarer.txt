I went into the wilderness with Uncle Walt  
I discovered the wild  
Learning to suck all the experience  
Seeing the world through cradles bars  
  
The wild blessed me with an errant mind  
Showing the way for the ultimate lore  
I went around the world beyond the wild  
Finding my home from an ocean shore  
  
Wayfarer heart lander  
What if I only had  
One more night to live  
  
Home is where the way is  
My road goes on forever  
One more voyage to go  
  
Dead to the world  
Alive for the journey
