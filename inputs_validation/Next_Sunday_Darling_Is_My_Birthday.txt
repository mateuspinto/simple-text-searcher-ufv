Next Sunday darling is my birthday  
A day that should be free from care  
Best wishes and congratulations  
But only sorrow fills the air  
  
While friends are singing happy birthday  
Therell be smile upon my face  
But when theyre gone the smile will vanish  
A broken heart will take its place  
  
Another year has come and gone now  
The plans I made have gone a stray  
The day that should be filled with laughter  
Will only be another day  
  
The little house we planned together  
Is empty now without you dear  
But in my dreams youre there beside me  
So let me dream that you are here
