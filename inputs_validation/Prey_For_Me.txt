How come whats wrong with you  
Darling faces are some we found  
Lets do what devils do  
Hiding in shadows noones around  
Why cant I torture you  
Giving pain you take it away  
The little things you do  
Simply I love your evil ways  
Your ways your ways your ways  
  
Prey for me  
I think I owe you an apology  
Somehow you bring the violence out in me  
Im just a shell of what I used to be  
Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me  
  
This time it follows you  
Nothings left your dead on the ground  
How can I covet you  
Give you hell and you cant be found  
My soul infested you  
Blackened thoughts they run through your head  
The little things you do  
Simply I wish you were dead  
Were dead were dead were dead  
  
Prey for me  
I think I owe you an apology  
Somehow you bring the violence out in me  
Im just a shell of what I used to be  
Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me  
  
Prey for me I think I owe you an apology  
Prey for me somehow you bring the violence out in me  
Prey for me Im just a shell of what I used to be  
Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me  
  
Goodbye so long  
Wish I could stay but everything is all wrong  
Goodbye so long  
Wish I could stay but everything is all wrong  
Everything is all wrong  
Too wrong wrong too wrong  
  
Prey for me  
I think I owe you an apology  
Somehow you bring the violence out in me  
Im just a shell of what I used to be  
Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me  
  
Prey for me I think I owe you an apology  
Prey for me somehow you bring the violence out in me  
Prey for me Im just a shell of what I used to be  
Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me
