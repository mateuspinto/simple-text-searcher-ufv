Whatever happened to good time Sally  
I dont see her round no more  
She used to be all over me  
It aint like that no more  
Sally had the best game there was in town  
Now the good girl just cant be found  
Whatever happened to good time Sally  
I dont see her round no more  
  
The heat is on everybody has gone underground  
The heat is on everybody hiding out just like Jesse James  
My old home town  
Lord it dont seem the same  
  
Well I walked in this place I was just lookin for a game  
Everybody here wanted to know my name  
I said hush hush up your mouth Ill introduce my own self  
To this house  
I was born in the back woods I was raised up like a slave  
Having me a good time now is all I crave  
I spotted me a barroom queen skin tight blue jeans  
That same old midnight show  
I took her to the side and I said I wont be satisfied  
Until you tell me everything you know  
  
Whatever happened to big time Buddy  
I dont see him round no more  
I heard tell that they got him in jail  
But I dont know what they got him for  
They caught him with an airplane  
Talkin bout some cocaine  
Nobody knows for sure  
Whatever happened to good time Buddy  
I dont see hem round no more  
  
The heat is on everybody has gone underground  
The heat is on everybody hiding out just like Jesse James  
My old home town  
Lord it dont seem the same
