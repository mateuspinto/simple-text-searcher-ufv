Its a loaded dice that you throw this time  
If you turn the Ace itll turn out fine  
When you spin the wheel and you get your call  
South of the line well the loser gets it all  
  
One too many days one too many nights  
You cried too many tears had too many fights  
And you know its a bad time Bad time to lose  
  
Every face you see has the staring eyes  
Every passing glance makes you realize  
And you know its a bad time Bad time to lose  
  
God knows theres no good time  
  
Too many days and too many nights  
You cried too many tears had too many fights  
And you know its a bad time Bad time to lose  
Yeah yeah Bad time to lose  
Bad time to lose Bad time to lose
