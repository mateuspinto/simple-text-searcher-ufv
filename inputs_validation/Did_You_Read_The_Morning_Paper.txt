Did you read the morning paper  
Did you see the front headline  
Did you read the morning paper  
Baby let me lend you mine  
  
There on the front page was a picture  
Of a crowd as they watched a parade passing by  
And through the haze of last nights sleep  
Something familiar caught my eye  
  
There was a couple looking so much in love yes  
They had a front line view  
And as I pulled the paper closer  
I realized standing next to her it was you  
  
Did you read the morning paper  
Did you see the front headline  
Did you read the morning paper  
Baby let me lend you mine  
  
Now I know why youve been working late each night  
And no longer have desire to ever hold me tight  
And your busy busy schedule was all a lie  
Oh even the dream with a bonus oh just another alibi  
  
Did you read the morning paper  
Did you see the front headline  
Did you read the morning paper  
Baby let me lend you mine  
  
Did you get the news today  
Did you read the morning paper  
Isnt the picture very clear  
Where do we go from here  
  
Did you read the morning paper  
Did you see the front headlines  
Did you read the morning paper  
Baby let me lend you mine  
  
Oh what now  
Did you read the morning paper  
Did you get the news today
