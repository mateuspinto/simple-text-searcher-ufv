Went for a walk down the Old Kings Road  
To see if anybody was there  
But there was nobody home at 3 Bywater Street  
And they had sold Cadogan Square  
And I remember myself in my tie dye sweater  
And my hipster corduroy flares  
As I knocked on doors  
And walked down oneway streets that led nowhere  
  
Ah did ya ever think it wouldnt last forever  
Did ya ever think that it would get this bad  
Did ya ever think that everything would get so crazy  
  
Now the Chelsea Drug Store needs a fix  
Its in a state of ill repair  
And my Cuban heels are hurting my feet  
Just to add to my despair  
Ladidahs drove Mini cars in the summertime  
In the summertime  
Now theyre towed away for parking on a double yellow line  
And they cant pay the fine  
Did you ever think  
Did you ever think wed all believe the hype  
Did you ever think  
Did you ever think the classes all would revert back to type  
Did you ever think  
Did you ever think the system ever really got it right  
Oh baby  
  
They filled us full of false illusions and promiscuity  
And they led us down that classless road to mediocrity  
As we walked down that alley way of hope  
We thought wed found the motherload  
But we were led like lambs to that promise land  
With all the debts that we would owe  
Once trendies posed for tourist pictures in the summertime  
In the summertime  
Not content with taking Polaroids they purchased all the property that they
could find  
And Ive just sold mine Did you ever  
  
Did ya ever think that this green and pleasant land  
Did ya ever think  
Would end up in the bottom of some garbage can  
Did ya ever think  
A dustbin full of promises and halfhearted plans  
Oh baby  
  
Did ya did ya did ya ever think  
Did you ever think  
In the summertime  
  
Now miseries and groaners moan and reminisce about the good old times and
whine whine whine  
Did ya ever think  
Did ya ever think when things were really fab  
Did ya ever think  
That wed be looking through a dustbin for a dogend to drag  
Did ya ever think  
And sleep on park benches wrapped in plastic bags  
Oh baby  
  
Did ya ever think that it would get this crazy  
Did ya ever think  
Did ya ever think that it would get this way  
Did ya ever think  
Did ya ever think that we would pay the price for being lazy
