Thinking out of line just to make the sun shine  
Anyway I can be like you  
Fighting with the truth  
Trying to hide a fool in a fantasy  
Im dreaming lay me down and take me now  
Our Lady of the skies  
  
Hiding in the sun like a loaded gun reality  
Aiming high at my dream  
But I can get along  
She makes me strong anyway  
Im dreaming and there is no other way  
Our Lady of the skies  
  
Flying in the sky with a bunch of high fidelity  
I can hear your song  
Offer me a ring just to show me your sincerity  
Im dreaming let me go  
Our Lady of the skies
