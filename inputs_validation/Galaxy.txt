Well here I am Im sitting alone again  
Im staring up at the sky  
Which at this lonely moment is my only friend  
And suddenly as I gazed upon the night  
Well I notice the stars  
They began to shake and dance and burst  
And fall into the darkness  
They exploded down I knew what I had to do  
I ran up to the top of the hill  
And I took a hold for you  
You were the sweetest star that fell  
And yes I held onto it close to the numbness in my heart  
And then I kissed a star yes I did  
I wrapped it up inside of a golden bow  
And then I ran away just to find you  
Cause this was your gift your gift oh shit  
A star that I kissed  
Oh the galaxy that lives inside your eyes  
Was in need I said it was in need  
Of a of a brand new shining light  
I said I wished to the dark sky above  
That all I had was to be captured  
And willingly turned over to you  
I know you better now and at this I smile  
I simply gave to you the symbol of what you are to me  
You are the star that shines  
And explodes with light and I love and embrace  
Love and embrace all that I can  
You better take this blindness and stay away from me  
And let me bask inside of your golden seam  
I never knew such simple astronomy  
I never knew it could come to me and not by the ways of the heart  
And call on me to be one of those strangely dressed wise men  
Who follow the stars to their love  
You are such a perfect star to wish upon  
Well I love you and God and Im hopeful  
Of what this lonely night may lead me to  
So I said god Im hopeful  
Of what this lonely lonely night  
Will lead me tonight  
Oh well well Im hopeful that this lonely night  
Well it shines so right Im hopeful  
Im hopeful of all good things to come about  
Im wishing upon you now yeah Im wishing upon you now  
Free me and let me indulge my view  
Oh most beautiful you keeper of starlight  
Take on me oh oh oh well here I am  
Im sitting all by myself again  
I stare up at the sky  
Which at this moment is my only friend  
Say well suddenly as I gazed upon the night  
Well I notice the stars  
They began to shake and burst  
Oh it looks like they want to fight no  
They were dancing they were romancing  
Oh they were falling in love  
They falling in love all over  
Falling in love all over  
Falling in love falling in love falling in love  
I say falling in love falling in love all over  
Falling in love is my best friend  
Falling in love all over all over again
