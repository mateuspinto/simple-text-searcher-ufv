I open the door see a baby  
Blue eyes filled with a spark  
Shes wearing her dress and  
All I can see is gold  
And I see her I call her she hears me  
And all there is to know  
Is hidden from everybody  
Except the both of us  
It was a good life  
You were the king of your mind  
Oh so excited  
To be a little child again  
I feel alright  
Tadadadadamdadadam  
I feel alright  
Tadadadadamdadadam  
And there she is playing  
And laughing and singing out loud  
And as I will gather  
I think I might getting older  
It was a good life  
You were the king of your mind  
Oh so excited  
To be a little child again  
I feel alright  
Tadadadadamdadadam  
I feel alright  
Tadadadadamdadadam
