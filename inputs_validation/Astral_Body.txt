Into this world were thrown  
A lifeform without a home  
Clowns in a circus called the material world  
Gods without immortality nothing to lose  
Nothing to gain nothing to keep  
Shepherds of dreams we are what we are  
  
Lovers losers loners leapers liars  
The meaning of life and I want to touch  
Your astral body   
We are what we are  
Oh were so full of light dont let it die  
And I want to touch your astral body   
  
And if I put pennies on your eyes or pyramids  
On your grave mysteries mountain high  
The day I have to go  
But before I leave I just want to feel love   
I want to touch somebody else than me  
  
We are what we are
