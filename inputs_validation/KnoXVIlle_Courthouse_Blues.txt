Im sittin in Knoxville Courthouse  
Aint got a thing to do  
I dont wanna go to the movies  
Couldnt if I wanted to Im on trial for lovin you  
  
Now this all started in a honky tonk  
Just the other side of town  
A girl come in took a stool by me  
Ordered gin and drank it down  
  
She lit up a cigarette and turned around  
Well she said my name is Jeannie  
And asked me what was mine  
I answered Hank and I walked  
To the jukebox droppin a dime  
  
I looked at her short dress low neck line  
Well we danced for five or ten minutes  
And I held her close to me  
  
Kissed her lips and squeezed her hips  
And judged about twentythree  
Whispered in my ears I said Yes siree  
  
Now the scene is a little motel  
Out on the state highway  
And theres a room for two  
Love is about to take place  
  
And a state trooper breaks down the door  
Shines a flash light in my face  
I said What the hell is this  
And another man and woman come in  
  
And the girl Im with starts cryin and screamin  
And she runs over to them  
Said Thank God youre here  
He tried to hurt me mama  
  
I said now you dont mean  
The cop says Son the girl is seventeen  
So thats why Im in Knoxville courthouse  
And the judge passed sentence on me  
  
And its ten long years for statutory rape  
In the state penitentiary  
Lord I cant believe this is happened to me  
  
So when next time you give a girl the eye  
She gives you that certain smile  
Just remember under that womans breast  
May beat the heart of a child  
  
Dont you let yourself be the one  
To help a mixed up kids go wild  
This story happened a lot thats true  
But you better hope and pray it never happens to you
