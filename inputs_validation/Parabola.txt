We barely remember who or what came before this precious moment  
We are choosing to be here right now Hold on stay inside  
This holy reality this holy experience  
Choosing to be here in  
  
This body This body holding me Be my reminder here that I am not alone in  
This body this body holding me feeling eternal  
All this pain is an illusion  
  
Alive I  
  
In this holy reality in this holy experience Choosing to be here in  
  
This body This body holding me Be my reminder here that I am not alone in  
This body this body holding me feeling eternal  
All this pain is an illusion  
  
Twirling round with this familiar parable  
Spinning weaving round each new experience  
Recognize this as a holy gift and celebrate this chance to be alive and
breathing  
  
This body holding me reminds me of my own mortality  
Embrace this moment Remember We are eternal  
All this pain is an illusion
