Oh angel sent from up above  
You know you make my world light up  
When I was down when I was hurt  
You came to lift me up  
  
Life is a drink and loves a drug  
Oh now I think I must be miles up  
When I was a river dried up  
You came to rain a flood  
  
And said drink from me drink from me  
When I was so thirsty  
Pour on a symphony now I just cant get enough  
  
Put your wings on me wings on me  
When I was so heavy  
Pour on a symphony when Im low low low low  
  
I oh I oh I got me feeling drunk and high  
So high so high  
Oh I oh I oh I Im feeling drunk and high  
So high so high  
  
Oh angel sent from up above  
I feel you coursing through my blood  
Life is a drink and your loves  
About to make the stars come out  
  
Put your wings on me wings on me  
When I was so heavy  
Pour on a symphony when Im low low low low  
  
I oh I oh I got me feeling drunk and high  
So high so high  
Oh I oh I oh I Im feeling drunk and high  
So high so high  
  
I oh I oh I lalala lalalala  
So high so high  
  
I oh I oh I Im feeling drunk and high  
So high so high  
  
Let me shoot across the sky  
Let me shoot across the  
Let me shoot across the sky  
Let me shoot across the  
  
Let me shoot across the sky  
Let me shoot across the  
Let me shoot across the sky  
Let me shoot across the
