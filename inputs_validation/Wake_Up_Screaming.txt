I dont think I am what I was before  
Cause I never watched anyone die before  
I wish Id never left home  
I wish Id left it alone  
Temptation is a disease  
Cause you never do as you please  
Your body takes over and your mind dont care  
Never think twice what might happen out there  
Screamin  
Go straight in for the ultimate sin  
Nobody else ever seems to care  
So I took what I thought was mine  
And waited for a very long time  
And I thought I knew what happened to you  
You told me exactly what to do  
So I did it right stayed up all night  
Felt like killing myself for you  
I dont think I think like I did before  
I never watched anyone die before  
I felt like I died as well  
The look the words the smell  
The way you looked at me  
As if Id never been free  
I remember the words like a favorite song  
Cause I forget the way things went wrong  
Faked a picture of perfect health  
I realised I was killing myself  
I dont think I am what I was before  
I never watched anyone die before  
I dream in slow motion and I wake up screaming  
Screamin
