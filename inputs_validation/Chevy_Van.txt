I gave a girl a ride in my wagon  
She crawled in and took control  
She was tired as her mind was a draggin  
I said get some sleepand dream of rock n roll  
  
Cause like a princess she was laying there  
Moonlight dancing off her hair  
She woke up and took me by the hand  
Shes gonna love me in my Chevy van  
And thats all right with me  
  
Her young face was like that of an angel  
Her long legs were tanned and brown  
Better keep your eyes on the road son  
Better slow this vehicle down  
  
Cause like a princess she was laying there  
Moonlight dancing off her hair  
She woke up and took me by the hand  
Shes gonna love me in my Chevy van  
And thats all right with me  
  
I put her out in a town that was so small  
You could throw a rock from end to end  
A dirt road main street she walked off in barefeet  
Its a shame I wont be passin through again  
  
Cause like a princess she was laying there  
Moonlight dancing off her hair  
She woke up and took me by the hand  
We made love in my Chevy van  
And thats all right with me  
  
Cause like a princess she was laying there  
Moonlight dancing off her hair  
She woke up and took me by the hand  
We made love my in my Chevy van  
And thats all right with me  
  
Cause like a princess she was laying there  
Moonlight dancing off her hair  
She woke up and took me by the hand  
We made love in my Chevy van
