You do it for the joy it brings  
Because youre a joyful girl  
Because the world owes me nothing  
And we owe each other the world  
I do it cause its the least I can do  
I do it cause I learned it from you  
I do it just because I want to  
Just because I want to  
  
Everything I do is judged  
And mostly they get it wrong Oh well  
The bathroom mirror has not budged  
And the woman who lives there can tell The truth from the stuff that they say  
And she looks me in the eye  
And says  
Would you prefer it the easy way  
No  
Well okay then  
Dont cry  
  
I wonder if everything I do  
I do instead  
Of something I want to do more  
The question fills my head  
I know theres no grand plan here  
This is just the way it goes  
When everything else seems unclear  
I guess at least I know  
You do it for the joy it brings  
Because youe a joyful girl  
Because the world owes me nothing  
And we owe each other the world  
I do it its the least I can do  
I do it I learned it from you you I do it just because I want to Just because
I want to
