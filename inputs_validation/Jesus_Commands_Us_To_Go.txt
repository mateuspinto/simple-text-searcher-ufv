Jesus commands us to go  
  
But we go the other way  
  
So he carries the burden alone  
  
While his children are busy at play  
  
Feeling so called to stay  
  
  
Oh how God grieves and believes that the world cant be saved  
  
Unless the ones hes appointed obeys  
  
His command and his stand for the world  
  
That he loved more than life  
  
Oh he died and he cries out tonight  
  
Jesus commands us to go  
  
It should be the exception if we stay  
  
Its no wonder were moving so slow  
  
When his church refuses to obey  
  
Feeling so called to stay  
  
  
Oh how God comes as he starts the great judgment of fire  
  
So he can gain his greatest desire  
  
Cause he knows that the souls of the lost  
  
They can only be reached through us  
  
Were his hands and his feet  
  
  
Jesus commands us to go  
  
It should be the exception if we stay  
  
Its no wonder were moving so slow  
  
When gods children refuse to obey  
  
Feeling so called to stay
