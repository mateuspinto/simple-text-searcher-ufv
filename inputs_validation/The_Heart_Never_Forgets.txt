Went through the attic today  
Found a note you wrote packed away  
And I started reliving the past  
When I saw his face  
  
Suddenly to my surprise  
I felt a tear fall from my eyes  
The heart never forgets  
No the heart never forgets  
  
You can find someone  
And live your life  
Put an old memory out of your mind  
But the heart never forgets  
  
A face on a crowded street  
An old movie on TV  
A song on the radio  
Can bring it all back  
  
Years roll by  
One by one  
All things change  
But theres always someone  
The heart never forgets  
No the heart never forgets  
  
You can find someone  
And live your life  
Put an old memory out of your mind  
But the heart never forgets  
  
The heart never forgets  
No the heart never forgets  
You can find someone  
And live your life  
Put an old memory out of your mind  
But the heart never forgets  
No the heart never forgets  
Ooh yeah  
Dawn
