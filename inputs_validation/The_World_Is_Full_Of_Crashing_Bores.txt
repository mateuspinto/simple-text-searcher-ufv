You must be wondering how  
The boy next door turned out  
Have a care  
But dont stare  
Because hes still there  
Lamenting policewomen policemen silly women taxmen  
Uniformed whores  
They who wish to hurt you Work within the law  
This world is full  
So full of crashing bores  
And I must be one  
Cos no one ever turns to me to say  
Take me in your arms  
Take me in your arms  
And love me  
  
You must be wondering how  
The boy next door turned out  
Have a care  
And say a prayer  
Because hes still there  
  
Lamenting policewomen policemen silly women taxmen  
Uniformed whores  
Educated criminals  
Work within the law  
This world is full  
Oh oh  
So full of crashing bores  
And I must be one cause no one ever turns to me to say  
Take me in your arms  
Take me in your arms  
And love me  
And love me  
  
What really lies  
Beyond the constraints of my mind  
Could it be the sea  
With fate mooning back at me  
No its just more lock jawed pop stars  
Thicker than pig shit  
Nothing to convey  
Theyre so scared to show intelligence  
It might smear their lovely career  
  
This world I am afraid  
Is designed for crashing bores  
I am not one I am not one  
You dont understand  
You dont understand  
And yet you can  
Take me in your arms and love me  
Love me  
And love me  
  
Take me in your arms and love me  
Love me love me  
Take me in your arms and love me  
Take me in your arms and love me  
Would you do  
Would you do  
What you should do  
Oh oh oh oh oh
