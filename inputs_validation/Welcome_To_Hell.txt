Fight we will fight right  
Living low in a world of our own  
Destined to live right fight  
Were taking hell as our home  
Burning lives burning  
Asking me for the mercy of god  
Ancient cries crying  
Acting fast upon the way of the dog  
  
Welcome to hell  
Welcome to hell  
Welcome to hell  
Welcome to hell  
  
Kill we will kill death  
Masturbating on the deeds we have done  
Hell commands death kill  
Argue not of feel the death of sun  
Burning lives burning  
Asking me for the mercy of god  
Ancient cries crying  
Acting fast upon the way of the dog  
  
Welcome to hell  
Welcome to hell  
Welcome to hell  
Welcome to hell  
  
Leave your souls at his feet  
Kiss the flames  
Scorn defeat  
  
Die we wont die live  
Our choice of difference is what youll never know  
Mortal voids live die  
Buried deep beneath the fall of the snow  
Burning lives burning  
Asking me for the mercy of god  
Ancient cries crying  
Acting fast upon the way of the dog  
  
Welcome to hell  
Welcome to hell  
Welcome to hell  
Welcome to hell
