I know you feelin good I know you feelin right  
You see me ridin you ridin wit me our shit is tight  
  
Selfmade millionaire refined myself  
My success God bless not defined by wealth  
Come on we live in crazy times niggers that lost their minds  
We wanna fuck every fuckin chicken we fuckin find  
  
But then there comes a time when you start to grow  
But you aint growin with me and its startin to show  
Before I say I cant live without you  
Lets sit and have a talk about family value  
  
Now listen I see you got some kids that you aint never with  
Your baby father put hands on you some crazy shit  
So he gon pay for that fuck with niggers who rap  
Most of that quality time is spent on your back  
  
Now before I devote the rest of my life  
Can you at least show a nigger you can boil some rice  
Is that too much to ask am I movin too fast  
Do you have anythin to offer me besides some ass  
  
You think you high class the upper echelon  
But spent all your grit money in the hair salon  
Im sposed to help you out but it just made me think  
You aint ready for the world you aint ready for me  
  
This how you make me feel this how you make me feel  
This how you make me feel thats how I know its real  
Take you around the world take you around the world  
Take you around the world take you around the world  
  
cause you my baby girl cause you my baby girl  
cause you my baby girl cause you my my my  
cause you my baby girl cause you my baby girl  
cause you my baby girl cause my my my  
  
Damn baby I see they drivin you crazy because your bodys amazin  
I know you wanted to phase me but hey  
I seen a lot of girls messed up a lot of curls  
You aint gon keep me with sex when only sex occurs  
  
Want you to think ahead not just give me head  
Want you to make a household baby not just the bed  
I know the scene is what you seem to see  
But you neednt to be but believe you me baby girl  
  
They jus gon use you up fuck you and bruise you up  
They got no family values they aint gon choose you up  
We disrespect ourselves we think we livin well  
I could be wrong in this song but only time will tell  
  
You maybe thinkin Hey X you just a hypocrite  
You actin like you never called a girl a fuckin bitch  
Nah its not that but its like this  
We need change and Im just man enough to say this shit  
  
This how you make me feel this how you make me feel  
This how you make me feel thats how I know its real  
Take you around the world take you around the world  
Take you around the world take you around the world  
  
cause you my baby girl cause you my baby girl  
cause you my baby girl cause you my my my  
cause you my baby girl cause you my baby girl
