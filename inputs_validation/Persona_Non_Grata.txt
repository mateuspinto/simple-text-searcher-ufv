Now the cry of the toucan for your man is history  
Welcome to Heaven the land of the rich and the free  
The waters so clean you can fill your canteen with it cold  
Please hand me your locket and I promise you pockets of gold  
No soldiers to knock on your door  
Now what can a man ask for more  
  
Chorus  
Persona non grata  
Just lay your money down  
Persona non grata  
On your knees and kiss the ground  
  
I know all the right people we will make you legal in a flash  
I wont take no for an answer no credit no checks just cash  
Well it may seem like a lot but Im really not in it for greed  
As god as my witness I have a family and mistress to feed  
What price can you put on a dream  
Your fortune lies across the stream  
  
Chorus  
  
Persona non grata  
Persona non grata  
No soldiers to knock on your door  
Now what can a man ask for man  
  
Chorus  
  
Persona non grata Repeat  
Lay your money down Repeat  
Persona non grata Repeat
