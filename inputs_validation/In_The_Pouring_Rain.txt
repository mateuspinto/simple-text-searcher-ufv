Strummer  
  
I could see as I rode in  
The ships were gone and the pit fell in  
A funeral bell tolled the hour in  
A lonely drunkard slumbering  
  
Not the twang of the guitar  
Not even the siren wail of pain  
Not the shadows of desire  
Caught in the pouring pouring rain  
  
Breeze black windows on date street  
Where I was raised up on the cheap  
yeah say ask no questions work and sleep  
til the old tango thats on date street  
  
I can hear the sharpen of the pain  
Some lucky stranger in the rain  
Hear the sharpen of the rain  
Lucky stranger In the rain  
  
Hammers beat in dusty times  
On these weedy rusted lines  
Mocking the sun and optomistic signs  
All these weedy gates of iron  
  
The sun wont shine my way again  
Lucky moon was on the wane  
Oh Ill never see a star again  
In the pouring pouring rain  
  
A salty band played for the train  
A sad trombone and some refrain  
The future pointed to the weather vane  
The old calypso died of shame  
  
I hear the sharpen of the pain  
Some lucky stranger in the rian  
Hear the sharpen of the pain  
Lucky stranger pouring rain  
  
Pouring rain
