I always knew somewhere in time  
Wed meet again wed cross that line  
Dont need to question no reason why  
The answer lies before your eyes  
  
Do you know who I am  
Do you understand  
  
Chorus  
Deja vu dreams come true  
I see my soul inside of you  
Deja vu so many lives  
Familiar spirits behind your eyes  
  
We cross between worlds through windows of light  
With open arms we hold back the night  
The crystal of power we hold in our hands  
We go on forever and love is the plan  
  
Do you know who I am  
Do you understand  
  
Repeat Chorus
