Brothers I am calling from the valley of the kings  
with nothing to atone  
A dark march lies ahead together we will ride like  
thunder from the sky  
May your sword stay wet like a young girl in her  
prime  
Hold your hammers high  
  
Blood and death are waiting like a raven in the sky  
I was born to die  
Hear me while I live  
As I look into your eyes  
None shall hear a lie  
Power and dominion are taken by the will  
By divine right hail and kill  
  
Hail Hail Hail and Kill Hail and Kill  
Hail Hail Hail and Kill Hail and Kill  
  
My father was a wolf  
Im a kinsman of the slain  
Sworn to rise again  
I will bring salvation punishment and pain  
The hammer of hate is our faith  
Power and dominion are taken by the will  
By divine right hail and kill  
  
Hail Hail Hail and Kill Hail and Kill  
Hail Hail Hail and Kill Hail and Kill  
  
Rip their flesh  
Burn their hearts  
Stab them in the eyes  
Rape their women as they cry  
Kill their servants  
Burn their homes  
Till theres no blood left to spill  
Hail and Kill  
Power and dominion are taken by the will  
By divine right hail and kill  
  
Hail Hail Hail and Kill Hail and Kill
