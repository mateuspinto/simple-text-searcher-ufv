Kicker of Elves  
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee  
Kicker of Elves  
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee  
Kicker of Elves  
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee  
Kicker of Elves  
  
On high seas in search of  
The sickly sweet milk of selfish love  
And knife these for warm fresh blood  
  
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee  
Kicker of Elves  
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee  
Kicker of Elves  
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee  
Kicker of Elves  
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee  
Kicker of Elves  
  
In studded crown the thief of souls  
The parasites the bugs of gold  
This fertile land now spoiled and sold  
  
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee  
Kicker of Elves  
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee  
Kicker of Elves
