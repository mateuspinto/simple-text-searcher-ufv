Dont cut out my paper heart I aint dyin anyway  
Take a look at eye full towers Never trust them dirty liars  
Sippin lemon yellow booze Ol leadbelly sings the blues  
All dressed up on wedding day Keep on trippin anyway  
  
I am I am I said Im not myself Im not dead and Im not for sale  
So keep your bankroll lottery eat your salad day deathbed motorcade  
  
Fake the heat and scratch the itch Skinned up knees and salty lips  
Ill breathe your life vicks vapor life and when you binge I purge alike  
Let go its harder holding on One more trip and Ill be gone  
  
So keep your head up Keep it on just a whisper Ill be gone  
Take a breath and make it big Its the last youll ever get  
Break you neck with diamond noose Its the last youll ever choose  
  
I am I am I said Im not myself Im not dead and Im not for sale  
Hold me closer closer let me go Let me be just let me be  
I am I am I said Im not myself Im not dead and Im not for sale  
So keep your bankroll lottery eat your salad day deathbed motorcade  
  
I am I am I said Im not myself Im not dead and Im not for sale  
Hold me closer closer let me go Let me be just let me be  
I am I am I said Im not myself Im not dead and Im not for sale  
So keep your bankroll lottery eat your salad day deathbed motorcade
