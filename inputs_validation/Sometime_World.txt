I met a man who felt the same way  
That the world had passed him by  
Told to me all his troubles  
That the world had made him cry  
  
Life had kept him waiting  
Regretting his pain inside  
Had to feel underrated  
And hated besides  
  
Life had kept him waiting  
Regretting his shame inside  
Had to feel underrated  
And hated besides  
  
Sometime world pass me by again  
Carry you carry me away  
Sometime world pass me by again  
Carry you carry me away
