Aint a party without me a party without me  
A party without me I make the beats and make you dance  
A party without me  
  
A party without me  
A party without me  
I pump the base that makes you dance  
A party without me  
A party without me  
A party without me  
I make the beats that make you dance  
A party without me  
A party without me  
A party without me  
I wanna see you raise your hands  
A party without me  
A party without me  
A party without me  
I make the beats that make you dance  
A party without me  
A party without me  
A party without me  
Let me see your fucking hands  
  
Let me see your fucking hands  
Let me see your fucking hands

Aint a party without me no  
Theres crazy everywhere that I go  
One day Ill put it all behind  
But trouble always seems to find me  
  
Holding now a party  
Get crazy with somebody  
Are you feeling naughty

A party without me  
A party without me  
A party without me  
I make the beats that make you dance  
A party without me  
A party without me  
A party without me  
I wanna see you raise your hands  
A party without me

A party without me

Let me see your fucking hands  
  
A party without me  
A party without me  
A party without me  
I pump the base that makes you dance  
A party without me  
A party without me  
A party without me  
Let me see your fucking hands  
Let me see your fucking hands  
Let me see your fucking hands
