Im racing racing towards it  
Like when I was a small boy  
Cutting through a waving field  
Decorated by summer sunlight  
  
Unable to remember  
Unable to forget  
Unable yet at peace  
Unable yet scared  
  
Im racing racing towards it with fear and excitement  
They seem inseparable  
They seem so far apart  
They are my close friends  
  
They are my very ghosts  
Im racing towards it  
Holding perfectly still  
In the race of standing still
