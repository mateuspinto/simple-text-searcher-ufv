I Want To See  
Words by Ray Boltz Music by Steve Millikan  
He sat in the darkness  
At the edge of the road  
He heard the crowd passing by  
But he couldnt go  
So he started crying  
Like a child at the door  
When they tried to quiet him  
He shouted it more  
Chorus  
I want to see  
Free me from this darkness  
Sweeping over me  
I want to see  
Son of David have mercy on me  
Now his heart was trembling  
Could this really be true  
A voice in the darkness said  
What do you want Me to do  
Chorus  
Eyes opened in a moment of grace  
Light filled the skies  
One touch  
And he sees the face of life  
Now Im like that blind man  
Who lived long ago  
I want to see Jesus  
And I just dont care who knows
