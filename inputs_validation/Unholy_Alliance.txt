It came up crawling from the ruins of the past  
And I just cant believe my eyes  
It wears the same old face we thought was dead and gone  
Forever buried by the time  
  
Unholy alliance  
Unholy alliance  
  
It came up screaming from the ashes of the grave  
To make this world a battle field  
Its got a voice that steals the courage from the brave  
And leaves a scar that will not heal  
  
Unholy alliance  
Unholy alliance  
  
Dont want to hear the same old lie that spreads the fear  
Only fools think its cool  
We must be blind not to see the signs  
How can we dare to look away in the wake of yesterday  
  
Troubled times dont turn your back to the lions  
Troubled times just learn your lesson well  
The party is over  
  
We must be blind not to see the signs  
How can we dare to look away in the wake of yesterday  
  
Troubled times dont turn your back to the lions  
Troubled times just learn your lesson well  
The party is over  
  
Unholy alliance
