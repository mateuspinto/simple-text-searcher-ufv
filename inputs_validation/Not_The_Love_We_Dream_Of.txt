Sometimes things dont work out the way you planned  
Sometimes words dont say the things you mean  
Sometimes you cant explain the way you feel  
Sometimes when we smile we tell the same lie  
  
With a whisper everything you know  
Is torn away and life just stops  
With a whisper everything you are  
Just falls apart and dies  
  
And all those things that you meant to change  
Are thoughts lost on the way to this  
And all those sorries you never said  
Are words lost on the wind  
  
Did you ever wonder about the end  
Did you ever you wish that I was still there  
Did you ever call my name by mistake  
Did you ever cry yourself to sleep  
  
Slowly slowly we lose the love that binds us  
Slowly slowly we lose the care that holds us  
Slowly slowly we lose the time that shares us  
Slowly slowly we lose the heart to save us  
  
Sometimes things are not the way they seem  
Sometimes friends are not the friends they seem  
Sometimes time is not the cure it seems  
Sometimes love is not the love we dream of
