Let me tell you bout a girl I know  
She is my baby and she lives next door  
Every mornin fore the sun comes up  
She brings me coffee in my favorite cup  
Thats why I know yes I know  
Hallelujah I just love her so  
  
When Im in trouble and I have no friend  
I know shell go with me until the end  
Everybody asks me how I know  
I smile at them and say She told me so  
Thats why I know oh I know  
Hallelujah I just love her so  
  
Now if I call her on the telephone  
And tell her that Im all alone  
By the time I count from one to four  
I hear her knock knock knock knock on my door  
  
In the evening when the sun goes down  
When there is nobody else around  
She kisses me and she holds me tight  
And tells me Daddy everythings all right  
Thats why I know yes I know  
Hallelujah I just love her so  
  
Now if I call her on the telephone  
And tell her that Im all alone  
By the time I count from one to four  
I hear her knock knock knock knock on my door  
  
In the evening when the sun goes down  
When there is nobody else around  
She kisses me and she holds me tight  
And tells me Daddy everythings all right  
Thats why I know yes I know  
Hallelujah I just love her so  
Oh hallelujah  
Dont you know I just love her so  
Shes my little woman waitin all this time  
Babe Im a little fool for you little girl
