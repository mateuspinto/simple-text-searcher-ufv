10000 light years somewhere out in space  
They practice love and they know what it takes  
No competition and no jealousy  
Living in freedom and humanity  
  
10000 light years away light years away far from pain  
Came to a place full of grace and of peace  
10000 light years away from our fear  
  
Suddenly its ringing in my ears  
Why is it now i dont want to be here  
I feel like flow in that clock at the wall  
God how i wish that this dream would go on  
  
10000 light years away light years away far from pain  
Came to a place full of grace and of peace  
10000 light years away from our fear  
  
10000 light years somewhere out in space 10000 lightyears  
10000 light years somewhere out in space 10000 lightyears  
10000 light years somewhere out in space 10000 lightyears  
10000 light years somewhere out in space 10000 lightyears  
  
3rd verse  on promolp 206 318000 only  
Reality comes knocking at my door  
I face the same obligations once more  
Dreams took me 10000 light years away  
Id give all i got if thats where i could stay
