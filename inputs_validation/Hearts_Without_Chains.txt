You wake up and you know its time to go  
With spending heads I lie on what you smoke  
Chase the hands on the wall can hold you close  
This misery is weightless as a stone  
  
Have you lost the scendings I have lost  
Do you know that panic I know  
Would I see the terror in your eyes  
Did you know that fever I know  
I wish time was still  
Wed stay right here  
With time to keep in our hearts without chains  
  
And if time was still  
Wed have no fear or scars to heal  
In our hearts without chains  
In our hearts without chains
