Every Friday night she rides the whole way over town  
Just to see some stupid boy who never turns around  
He never sees the girl whose dreams have told her hes the one  
Still she gets excited whenever Friday comes  
There is no reason in loves sweet plan  
Its deeper than the sea  
Things happen we fall in love  
It just comes naturally  
Anyone who saw her in the street would never know  
The passion of the feeling she never puts on show  
We can not choose the ones with whom we think that we belong  
Just when youre not looking someone comes along  
There is no reason in loves sweet plan  
Its deeper than the sea  
Things happen we fall in love  
It just comes naturally  
There she stands clothes around her feet  
Choosing what to wear so she can just stand in his street  
please oh please this time Ill make him mine  
She begs of her reflection in her dressing table shrine  
Oh there is no reason in loves sweet plan  
Its deeper than the sea  
Things happen we fall in love  
It just comes naturally
