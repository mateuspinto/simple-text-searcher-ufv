I wish you happy christmas  
I do dear I do  
I wish for you the stars babe  
I wish for you the moon  
  
You can sit and you can drink your champagne  
With your gibbering goon  
I hope hes being good to you  
I do dear I do  
  
Aint no whirlwind below your wing  
Wish that you will keep safe  
Up there in your leather babe  
With your ivory and   
  
Things down here are fragmatic  
In fact theyve exploded all over the room  
I think everythings a little offcenter babe  
I do dear I do  
  
You said that to love me you must set me free  
Now that may all be very well  
Still I miss you baby  
More than words can ever tell  
  
Sometimes I can not sleep  
The greatness of my hate for you  
Sometimes I can not sleep  
For I miss you  
  
May your day be bright as the eyes  
Of the girl that I once knew  
May your sun be happy yellow babe  
And your sky be baby blue  
  
I miss your manic scratches  
And your howling at the moon  
Ten steps behind me  
With your dustpan and broom  
  
I hope you wish for me  
All the things I wish for you  
Health hope and happiness  
The sun and the moon  
  
Say hello to the one  
Who really dont have a clue  
Ill be calling you soon  
I think I love you  
  
I do dear I do
