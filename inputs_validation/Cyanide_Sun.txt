Shouldve known how hard it is to stop tearing each other apart  
Separating souls entwined with all these labyrinthine lies  
  
I am dead to you a shadow doomed  
My love forever in the dark  
And of all untruths the truest is you  
Too close to my heart  
  
This emptiness Ive made my home  
Embracing memories of dreams long gone  
One last caress from the corpse of love is all I want  
Underneath the cyanide sun  
  
Weve sailed the seas of grief on a raft built with our tears  
Looking for a way to disappear for a moment from our deepest fears  
  
Ill be drowning you in this river of gloom  
Forever in my heart
