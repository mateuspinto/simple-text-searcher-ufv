If I could have my wasted days back  
Would I use them to get back on track  
Stop to warm at karmas burning  
Or look ahead but keep on turning  
  
Do I have the strength  
To know how Ill go  
Can I find it inside  
To deal with what I shouldnt know  
  
Could I have my wasted days back  
Would I use them to get back on track  
  
You live it or lie it  
  
My lifestyle determines my deathstyle  
  
Keep searching keep on searching  
This search goes on this search goes on  
  
Frantic tick tick tick tick tick tick tock  
Frantic tick tick tick tick tick tick tock  
  
Ive worn out always being afraid  
An endless stream of fear that Ive made  
Treading water full of worry  
This frantic tick tick talk of hurry  
  
Do I have the strength  
To know how Ill go  
Can I find it inside  
To deal with what I shouldnt know  
  
Worn out always being afraid  
An endless stream of fear that Ive made  
  
You live it or lie it  
  
My lifestyle determines my deathstyle  
  
Keep searching keep on searching  
This search goes on this search goes on  
  
Frantic tick tick tick tick tick tick tock  
Frantic tick tick tick tick tick tick tock  
  
My lifestyle Birth is pain  
Determines by deathstyle Life is pain  
A rising tide Death is pain  
That pushes to the other side Its all the same
