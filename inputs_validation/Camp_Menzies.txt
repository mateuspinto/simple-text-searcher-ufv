Were up at Camp Menzies The camp of  
Our dreams were streams let me ender  
And sparkers and gleames So come on and join us For we are never blue  
Be a member of our happy happy crew you too  
  
At night round the camp fire We laugh  
And we sing Give a cheer for Camp Menzies  
And let the echoes ring Well cheer  
For our campers our garden leaders to  
Well cheer for you and you we do
