I wonder how I ever made it through a day  
How did I settle for a world in shades of gray  
When you go in circles all the scenery looks the same  
And you dont know how then I looked into your eyes  
And the world stretched out in front of me and I realized  
  
Chorus  
I never lived before your love  
I never felt before your touch  
I never needed anyone to make me feel alive  
But then again I wasnt really living  
I never lived before your love  
  
I wanted more than just an ordinary life  
All of my dreams seemed like castles in the sky  
I stand before you and my heart is in your hands  
And I dont know how I survived without you kiss  
Cause youve given me a reason to exist  
  
Chorus  
  
And I dont know why  
Why the sun decides to shine  
But you breathed you love into me just in time  
  
Chorus
