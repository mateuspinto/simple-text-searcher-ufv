Like a snowball rolling down the side of a snow covered hill its growing  
Like the size of a fish that the man claims broke his reel its growing  
Like a rosebud blooming in the warm of the summer sun its growing  
Like the tale by the time its been told by more than one woo its growing  
  
Everyday it grows a little more than it was the day before  
My love for you just grows and grows  
Oh how it grows and it grows  
And where its gonna stop Im sure nobody knows  
  
Hey hey hey nobody knows  
How it grows and it grows and it grows  
Nobody knows Woo yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Nobody knows it grows it grows where is it gonna stop  
  
Woo like a need in a guy to see his girl  
When shes gone away its growing  
Like the sadness in his little heart  
When he knows that shes gone to stay woo it growing  
  
Everyday it grows a little more than it was the day before  
My love for you just grows and grows  
Oh how it grows and it grows  
And where its gonna stop Im sure nobody knows  
  
Hey hey hey nobody knows It gets a little wider  
Nobody knows Oh it gets a little stronger  
Hey hey hey The feeling for each kiss baby  
Hey hey hey Oh it lasts a little longer yeah  
Hey hey hey Oh so much oh so much  
Cant you see its growing baby  
It grows and it grows and it grows and it grows
