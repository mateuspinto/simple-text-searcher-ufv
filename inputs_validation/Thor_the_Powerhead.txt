Black clouds on the horizon  
Great thunder and burning rain  
His chariot pounding  
I heard the heavens scream his name  
  
I watched as he shouted  
To the giants who died that day  
He held up his hammer high  
And called to Odin for a sign  
  
Thor the mighty Thor the brave  
Crush the infidels in your way  
By your hammer let none be saved  
Live to die on that final day  
Gods monsters and men  
Will die together in the end  
  
God of thunder god of rain  
Earth shaker who feels no pain  
The powerhead of the universe  
Now send your never ending curse  
  
I watched as he shouted  
To the giants who died that day  
He held up his hammer high  
And called to Odin for a sign  
  
Thor the mighty Thor the brave  
Crush the infidels in your way  
By your hammer let none be saved  
Live to die on that final day  
Gods monsters and men  
Will die together in the end  
  
Swing your hammer to crack the sky  
Lift your cape so that you might fly  
Back to Odin and the gods on high  
And leave the mortal world  
  
Thor the mighty Thor the brave  
Crush the infidels in your way  
By your hammer let none be saved  
Live to die on that final day  
Gods monsters and men  
Will die together in the end  
  
Odin
