Consider me an object  
Put me in a vacuum  
Free of all conditions  
Free of air and friction  
Yea Ill be hanging upside down  
And there I will swing  
For all eternity  
Fell it rising yea next stop falling  
Feel it rising comatose with no fear of falling  
Consider me an abscess  
Leave me in my vacuum  
Blood on all the pistons  
Running my transmission  
Feel it rising yea next stop falling  
Feel it rising comatose with no fear of falling  
Feel it rising yeah next stop falling  
Feel It rising  
High above Ill break the law  
If its illegal to be in love  
Leave the hatred on the cross  
Yea Ill be hanging upside down and here I will swing  
For all eternity  
Feel it rising yea next stop falling  
Feel it rising comatose with no fear of falling  
Feel it rising yea next stop falling  
Feel it rising  
Something never thought youd be part of
