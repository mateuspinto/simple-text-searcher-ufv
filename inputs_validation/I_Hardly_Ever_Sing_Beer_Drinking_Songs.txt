I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs  
And when they play them cheatin tunes I never sing along  
I never ever sing the blues Ive forgotten born to lose  
And I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs  
I hardly ever walk the floor and cry  
And I dont think Ive ever said I feel like I could die  
I dont ever lay awake I never think my heart will break  
I hardly ever walk the floor and cry  
I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs  
I cant put much feeling in saying love is all gone wrong  
I dont lose no sleep at night cause things with you are going right  
And I hardly ever sing beer drinking songs  
I never call your name out in my sleep  
You never make me worry and you never make me weep  
I never wonder if youre true I spend a night curled up with you  
And I never call your name out in my sleep  
I hardly ever sing beer
