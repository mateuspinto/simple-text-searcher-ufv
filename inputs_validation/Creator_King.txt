You who made the mountains and the sea  
Measured out the universe and You made me  
Echoes of the voice that called the worlds to be  
Reach throughout the ages and now speak to me  
Youre my Creator King  
You who made the valleys and the skies  
Displayed Your love on far horizons and before my eyes  
You who lit the stars and set the dawn in time  
Called them all by name and now You whisper mine  
Youre my Creator King  
Who am I that You are mindful of me Yeah  
Who am I that You sent Your love on me  
Youre my Creator King  
You who made the darkness and the light  
Sun and moon to watch the day and guard the night  
The hand that stretched the Heavens like a canopy  
Reaches down to cover and watch over me  
Youre my Creator King  
Who am I Who am I that You are mindful of me  
Who am I that You sent Your love on me  
Who am I that You are mindful of me  
Who am I that You sent Your love on me Yeah  
Youre my Creator King Youre my Creator King  
Youre my Creator King Youre my Creator King
