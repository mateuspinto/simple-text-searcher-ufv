Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night and  
Wouldnt you love to love her  
Takes to the sky like a bird in flight and  
Who will be her lover  
  
All your life youve never seen  
A woman taken by the wind  
Would you stay if she promised you heaven  
Will you ever win  
  
She is like a cat in the dark and then  
She is the darkness  
She rules her life like a fine skylark and when  
The sky is starless  
  
All your life youve never seen  
A woman taken by the wind  
Would you stay if she promised you heaven  
Will you ever win  
Will you ever win

Rhiannon  
  
She rings like a bell through the night and  
Wouldnt you love to love her  
She rules her life like a bird in flight and  
Who will be her lover  
  
All your life youve never seen  
A woman taken by the wind  
Would you stay if she promised you heaven  
Will you ever win  
Will you ever win

Taken by the sky
