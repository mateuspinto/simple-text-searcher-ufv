I wonder if I care as much  
As I did before  
  
Last night I cried myself to sleep  
For the one that makes me weep  
I dried my eyes to greet the day  
And wondered why I had to pay  
The tears that I have shed by day  
Give relief and wash away  
The memory of the night before  
I wonder if Ill suffer more  
  
I wonder if I care as much  
As I did before  
  
My pride is made to say forgive  
And take the blame for what you did  
Its your mistakes Im thinkin of  
I wonder if Im still in love  
My heart cant thrive on misery  
My life it has no destiny  
When things get more  
Than I can bear  
I ask myself Do I still care  
I wonder if I care as much  
As I did before
