She packed up her bags and she took off down the road  
Left me here stranded with the bills she owed  
She gave me a false address  
Took off with my American Express  
Sunspot Baby  
She sure had me way outguessed  
  
She left me here stranded like a dog out in the yard  
Charged up a fortune on my credit card  
She used my address and my name  
Man that was sure unkind  
Sunspot Baby  
She sure has a real good time  
  
I looked in Miami  
I looked in Negril  
The closest I came was a month old bill  
I checked the Bahamas and they said she was gone  
I cant understand why she did me so wrong  
  
But she packed up her bags  
And she took off down the road  
Said she was going to visit sister Flo  
She used my address and my name  
And man that was sure unkind  
Sunspot Baby  
Im gonna catch up sometime  
Sure had a real good time
