Once I was a prisoner  
Lost inside myself  
With the world surrounding me  
Wandering through the misery  
But now I am free  
  
You gave me a breath of life  
Unclouded my eyes  
With sweet serenity  
Lighting a ray of hope for me  
And now I am free  
  
Free to live  
Free to laugh  
Free to soar  
Free to shine  
Free to give  
Free to love  
Free enough to fly  
  
Once I was all so alone  
Unsteady and cold  
But your love rained down upon me  
Washing away uncertainty  
  
But now  
I am free
