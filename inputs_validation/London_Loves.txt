A malady has taken him over  
Coughing tar in his Japanese motor  
The lights are magic  
And he feels lucky  
And hes got money  
Shoots like an arrow oh  
  
London loves  
The mystery of a speeding car  
London loves  
The misery of a speeding heart  
  
Its love you like and everyones at it  
And words are cheap when the mind it elastic  
He loves the violence  
Keeps ticking over  
So sleep together  
Before today is sold forever  
  
London loves  
The way people just fall apart  
London loves  
The way you just dont stand a chance  
London loves  
The misery of a speeding heart  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
London loves  
The mystery of a speeding car  
London loves  
The misery of a speeding heart  
London loves  
The mystery  
  
Oh hey hey  
London loves  
The way people just fall apart  
London loves  
The way we just dont stand a chance  
London loves always London loves  
The speeding heart
