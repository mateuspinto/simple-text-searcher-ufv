Alright yeah  
  
I met this girl around quarter to ten  
We made it once she said make me again  
She wrapped her love around me all night long  
In the mornin we were still goin strong  
  
Now let me tell ya it sure feels good  
First time I saw that girl I knew it would  
Now let me tell ya it sure felt right  
No pullin teeth she didnt want to fight she said  
  
Shake me all night she said  
Shake me shake it dont break it baby  
Shake me all night she said  
All night long  
All night long baby  
  
Screamed and scratched and rolled out of the bed  
I never really got her out of my head  
And now and then she makes those social calls  
Gives me a squeeze gets me kickin the walls  
  
Now let me tell ya it still feels tight  
And we were shakin after every bite  
I feel her comin in the middle of the night  
Screamin higher  
  
Shake me all night she said  
Shake me shake it dont break it baby  
Shake me all night she said  
Shake me oh yeah  
  
All night keep the fire burnin  
Cause were doin all right  
All night come on and shake it right  
  
Shake me  
Shake me  
Shake me  
Shake me  
  
Shake me all night she said  
Shake me shake it dont break it baby  
Shake me all night she said  
Shake me oh yeah  
  
Shake me  
Shake me yeah  
Shake me  
Oh come on baby baby  
Shake me  
Shake me
