So many nights thought that I was doing fine  
Thought that time had chased your picture from my mind  
So many times thought my heart was finally strong  
Now I find this heart of mine was so wrong  
I I thought Id finally learned to get on with my life  
Then it all comes back  
I hear your voice  
Call  
Your voice  
Call  
Your voice  
Call  
The way it used to do  
I feel my heart  
Fall  
My heart  
Fall  
I try to keep you off my mind  
But every time I do I hear your voice  
So many days I thought that I could love again  
But any fool in love would know thats all pretend  
You you always seem to find your way  
Back in my dreams and I cant break free  
I hear your voice  
Call  
Your voice  
Call  
Your voice  
Call  
The way it used to do  
I feel my heart  
Fall  
My heart  
Fall  
I try to keep you off my mind  
But every time I do I hear your voice  
You know I tried so many times  
Just to forget you  
Ive tried to walk away from you  
Oh girl its just no use  
I hear your voice  
Call  
Your voice  
Call  
Your voice  
Call  
Calling me calling me the way  
I feel my heart  
Fall  
Oh my heart  
Fall  
I try to keep you off my mind  
But every time I do I hear your voice  
I hear your voice  
I hear your voice
