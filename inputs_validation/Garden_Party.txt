Garden Party held today invites call the debs to play  
Social climbers polish ladders wayward sons again have fathers  
Edgy eggs and queing cumbers rudely wakened from their slumber  
Time has come again for slaughter on the lawns by still  
  
Cam  
Waters  
Champagne corks are firing at the sun again  
Swooping swallows chased by violins again  
  
Straafed by Strauss they sulk in crumbling eaves again  
Apertifs consumed en masse display their owners on the grass  
Couples loiter in the cloisters social leeches quoting Chaucer  
Doctors son a parsons daughter where why not and should they oughta  
  
Please dont lie on the grass unless accompanied by a fellow  
May I be so bold as to suggest Othello  
Punting on the Cam is jolly fun they say  
Beagling on the downs Oh please come they say  
  
Rugger is the tops a game for men they say  
Angie chalks another blue mother smiles she did it too  
Chitters chat and gossips lash posers pose pressmen flash  
Smiles polluted with false charm locking onto Royal arms  
  
Society columns now ensured return to mingle with the crowds  
Oh what a crowd
