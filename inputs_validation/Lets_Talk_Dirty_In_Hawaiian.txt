I packed my bags and bought myself a ticket  
For the land of the tall palm tree  
Aloha old milwaukee hello waikiki  
I just stepped down from the airplane  
When I thought I heard her say  
Waka waka nuka nuka waka waka nuka nuka  
Would you like a lei Eh  
  
Lets talk dirty in hawaiian  
Whisper in my ear  
Kicka pooka maka wah wahini  
Are the words I long to hear  
Lay your coca nuta on ma tiki  
What the hecka mooka mooka dear  
Lets talk dirty in hawaiian  
Say the words I long to hear  
  
Its a ukelele honolulu sunset  
Listen to the grass skirts sway  
Drinking rum from a pineapple  
Out on honolulu bay  
The steel guitars all playing  
While shes talking with her hands  
Gimme gimme oka doka make a wish and wanta polka  
Words I understand  
  
Lets talk dirty in hawaiian  
Whisper in my ear  
Kicka poo ka maka wa wah wahini  
Are the words I long to hear  
Lay your coca nuta on ma tiki  
What the hecka mooka mooka dear  
Lets talk dirty in hawaiian  
Say the words I long to hear  
  
I boughta lota junka with my moola  
And sent it to the folks back home  
I never had the chance to dance the hula  
I guess I should have known  
When you start talking to the sweet wahini  
Walking in the pale moonlight  
Oka doka what a setta knocka rocka sis boom bocas  
Hope I said it right  
  
Lets talk dirty in hawaiian  
Whisper in my ear  
Kicka pooka maka wah wahini  
Are the words I long to hear  
Lay your coca nuta on ma tiki  
What the hecka mooka mooka dear  
Lets talk dirty in hawaiian  
Say the words I long to hear
