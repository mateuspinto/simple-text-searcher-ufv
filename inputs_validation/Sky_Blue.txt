Lost my time lost my place in  
Sky blue  
Those two blue eyes light your face in  
Sky blue  
I know how to fly I know how to drown in  
Sky blue  
  
Warm wind blowing over the earth  
Sky blue  
I sing through the land the land sings through me  
Sky blue  
Reaching into the deepest shade of  
Sky blue  
  
Sky blue  
So tired of all this traveling  
So many miles away from home  
I keep moving to be stable  
Free to wander free to roam  
  
Train pulled out said my goodbyes  
Sky blue  
Back on the road alone with the sky  
Sky blue  
Theres a presence here no one denies  
Sky blue  
  
Sky blue  
So tired of all this traveling  
So many miles away from home  
I keep moving to be stable  
Free to wander free to roam  
  
I can hear the same voice calling  
Crying out from my heart  
And that cry what a cry  
What a cry its going to be  
If I can stop to let it out oh
