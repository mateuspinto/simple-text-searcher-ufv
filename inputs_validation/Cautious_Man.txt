Bill Horton was a cautious man of the road  
He walked lookin over his shoulder and remained faithful to its code  
When something caught his eye hed measure his need  
And then very carefully hed proceed  
  
Billy met a young girl in the early days of May  
It was there in her arms he let his cautiousness slip away  
In their lovers twilight as the evening sky grew dim  
Hed lay back in her arms and laugh at what had happened to him  
  
On his right hand Billy tattooed the word love and on his left hand was the
word fear  
And in which hand he held his fate was never clear  
Come Indian summer he took his young lover for his bride  
And with his own hands built a great house down by the riverside  
  
Now Billy was an honest man he wanted to do what was right  
He worked hard to fill their lives with happy days and loving nights  
Alone on his knees in the darkness for steadiness hed pray  
For he knew in a restless heart the seed of betrayal lay  
  
One night Billy awoke from a terrible dream callin his wifes name  
She lay breathing beside him in a peaceful sleep a thousand miles away  
He got dressed in the moonlight and down to the highway he strode  
When he got there he didnt find nothing but road  
  
Billy felt a coldness rise up inside him that he couldnt name  
Just as the words tattooed cross his knuckles he knew would always remain  
At their bedside he brushed the hair from his wifes face as the moon shone on
her skin so white  
Filling their room with the beauty of Gods fallen light
