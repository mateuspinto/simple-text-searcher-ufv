Stood still on a highway I saw a woman by the side of the road  
With a face that I knew like my own  
Reflected in my window  
Well she walked up to my quarter light and she bent down real slow  
A fearful pressure paralyzed me in my shadows  
  
She said Son  
What are you doing here  
My fear for you has turned me in my grave  
I said Mama  
I come to the valley of the rich  
Myself to sell  
She said Son  
This is the road to hell  
  
On your journey cross the wilderness from the desert to the well  
You have strayed upon the motorway to hell
