To prove were not barbarians  
They dress us up like savages  
To prove were not barbarians  
We wear a funny skirt

To prove were not barbarians  
They dress us up like savages  
To prove were not barbarians  
We wear a funny skirt

Of that there is no doubt  
They feel so sentimental  
About the Oriental  
They always try to turn us  
Inside down down and upside out

Upside out and inside down  
  
Thiang  
To brusie and pinch our little toes  
Our feet are cramped in leather shoes  
Theyd break if we had brittle toes  
But now they only hurt  
Ah H

Our feet are cramped in leather shoes  
Theyd break if we had brittle toes  
But now they only hurt

They think they civilise us Ah  
Whenever they advise us  
To learn to make the same mistake  
That they are making too  
 H  
  
All  
They make quite A few
