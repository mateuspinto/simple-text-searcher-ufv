My heart is true but the road is long  
And Im a fool cause I do you wrong  
Its hard today to stay in line  
But Ill try it all anything you want  
You got it all you got it all today  
You got my soul  
CHORUS  
Burning fire  
Burning fire  
Burning fire  
I lost it all so you can find it  
Its hard to breath in this world today  
But in mercy is the key of loving  
You got it all you got it all today  
You got my soul  
CHORUS  
So love it hides behind your silence  
And yesterday is gone today  
So I will love you now  
Like nothing happened  
CHORUS
