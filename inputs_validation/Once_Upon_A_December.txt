Dancing bears  
Painted wings  
Things I almost remember  
And a song someone sings  
Once upon a December  
  
Someone holds me safe and warm  
Horses prance through a silver storm  
Figures dancing gracefully  
Across my memory  
  
Far away long ago  
Glowing dim as an ember  
Things my heart used to know  
Once upon a December  
  
Someone holds me safe and warm  
Horses prance through a silver storm  
Figures dancing gracefully  
Across my memory  
  
Far away long ago  
Glowing dim as an ember  
Things my heart  
Used to know  
Things it yearns to remember  
  
And a song  
Someone sings  
Once upon a December
