Those rhinestones turned to diamonds and those diamonds soon got old  
I had everything that you could buy to have but not to hold  
But all that glitters is not gold and when loves lost its shine  
I had million dollar memories down to my last dime  
Million dollar memories down to my last dime  
Honky tonks and whiskey Lord theyll do it every time  
The day she found another I almost lost my mind  
And my million dollar memories are down to my last dime  
Play it pig  
  
Those limousines and chauffeurs they soon fell by the way  
Like that mansion down in Dallas Lord I lost the other day  
Happiness is gone now theres nothing left but time  
And my million dollar memories are down to my last dime  
Million dollar memories  
Yes my million dollar memories are down to my last dime  
Think about that honey
