I surrender my soul Odin hear my call  
One day Ill sit beside your throne in Valhallas great hall  
Like so many before me Ill die with honor and pride  
The right of a warrior forever to fight by your side  
  
Send a sign raise the sail wave a last goodbye  
Destiny is calling immortality be mine  
  
Call the witch to cast the runes weave a magic spell  
We who die in battle are born not for heaven not for hell  
  
We are Sons of Odin the fire we burn inside  
Is the legacy of warrior kings who reign above in the sky  
  
I will lead the charge my sword into the wind  
Sons of Odin fight to die and live again  
Viking ships cross the sea in cold wind and rain  
Sail into the black of night magic stars our guiding light  
  
Today the blood of battle upon my weapons will never dry  
Many Ill send into the ground laughing as they die  
  
We are Sons of Odin the fire we burn inside  
Is the legacy of warrior kings who reign above in the sky  
  
I will lead the charge my sword into the wind  
Sons of Odin fight to die and live again  
Viking ships cross the sea in cold wind and rain  
Sail into the black of night magic stars our guiding light  
  
Place my body on a ship and burn it in the sea  
Let my spirit rise Valkries carry me  
Take me to Valhalla where my brothers wait for me  
Fires burning to the sky my spirit will never die  
  
I will lead the charge my sword into the wind  
Sons of Odin fight to die and live again  
Viking ships cross the sea in cold wind and rain  
Sail into the black of night magic stars our guiding light
