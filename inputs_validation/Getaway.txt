Ive been tryin to get away  
To get away  
To leave this old town  
Ive been tryin to see my way  
To see my way  
So I wont be found  
  
Many times Ive felt alone  
Ive felt alone  
But thats all behind  
One thing I know  
I know  
One thing is that  
  
I know I have to go  
Got no dough  
Should I stay or should I go  
Gotta get away  
Dont want to stay  
Leavin tomorrow by subway  
  
Some people they tell me  
They tell me  
Ive been here to long  
It dont compel me  
They tell me  
I just dont belong  
Sometimes I wonder  
I wonder  
Whats right or whats wrong  
One thing I  
I know  
One thing is that  
  
I know I have to go  
Got no dough  
Should I stay or should I go  
Gotta get away  
Dont want to stay  
Leavin tomorrow by subway  
  
I gotta get away  
Get away get away get away  
I gotta get away  
Yeah baby get away gotta gotta gotta get away  
Whoo youve gotta get away
