I am Santa Claus  
Ho ho ho ho ho  
Flying Through the snow  
Can you hear him ho ho ho  
Hes so full of cheer  
Only has to work one day a year  
Children in their beds  
Visions of sugar plums fill their heads  
So many kids out there  
Santa must be a billionare  
Red suit boots of black  
Big sack of toys hanging off his back  
How much does he weigh  
How do the reindeer pull his sleigh  
Nobody sees him  
As he travels the world  
Leaving his presents  
For the good boys and girls  
Ho ho ho ho ho  
Sees every move you make  
Better be good for goodness sake  
Leave him cookies and beer  
Hell be back to your house first next year  
I am Santa Claus  
Ho ho ho ho ho
