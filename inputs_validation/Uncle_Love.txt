Uncle Love just got a message from God  
That you are driving him crazy  
Tomorrow he says the doctor comes  
With a drink to make him lazy  
  
Did you realize that Uncle Loves  
Got an eight ball in his hand  
Everything sticks to you like glue  
But it just makes you lazy  
  
You should hear what they say  
About you everyday  
You should hear what they say  
Uncle Loves going to get you
