Enjolras  
Do you hear the people sing  
Singing a song of angry men  
It is the music of a people  
Who will not be slaves again  
When the beating of your heart  
Echoes the beating of the drums  
There is a life about to start  
When tomorrow comes  
  
Combeferre  
Will you join in our crusade  
Who will be strong and stand with me  
Somewhere beyond the barricade  
Is there a world you long to see  
  
Courfeyrac  
Then join in the fight  
That will give you the right to be free  
  
All  
Do you hear the people sing  
Singing a song of angry men  
It is the music of a people  
Who will not be slaves again  
When the beating of your heart  
Echoes the beating of the drums  
There is a life about to start  
When tomorrow comes  
  
Feuilly  
Will you give all you can give  
So that our banner may advance  
Some will fall and some will live  
Will you stand up and take your chance  
The blood of the martyrs  
Will water the meadows of France  
  
All  
Do you hear the people sing  
Singing a song of angry men  
It is the music of a people  
Who will not be slaves again  
When the beating of your heart  
Echoes the beating of the drums  
There is a life about to start  
When tomorrow comes
