Our local picture house was showing a Batman movie  
You see this guy fly up in the sky thought to myself Why shouldnt I  
So I bought a pair of wings went up upon a wall  
I was about to jump into the air when a guy from the street called  
He said Hey wait a minute Dont you realize the danger  
What do you think you are some kind of angel  
  
I considered for a minute realized he spoke the truth  
For the barbells on my eyelids only emphasized my youth  
And the sawdust in my plimsolls means the same to him as me  
But thats neither here nor further so I spoke considerately  
Now if you understand just what Im trying to say  
Whatever you do dont grin youll give the game away  
  
By now a crowd had gathered and it seemed that all was lost  
In the anger of the moment I had diced with death and lost  
It seemed to me the time was right so I burst into song  
In the anger of the moment the crowd began to sing along  
I could not see a way out of this predicament  
Just then a breeze came through the trees and up in the air I went  
  
I must have flown a mile or maybe it was eight  
Thought to myself pretty soon Id hit the Golden Gates  
Just then a passing bird for no reason I could see  
Took a peck at my wings and that was the end of me  
I went down hit the ground faster than the speed of sound  
Luckily I broke no bones only tore my underclothes
