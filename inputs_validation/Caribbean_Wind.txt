She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost  
From the city of seven hills near the place of the cross  
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy  
Told about Jesus told about the rain  
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain  
By a man who danced on the roof of the embassy  
  
Was she a child or a woman I cant say which  
From one to another she could to easily switch  
We went into the wall to where the long arm of the law could not reach  
Could I been used and played as a pawn  
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on  
Where men bathed in perfume and celebrated free speech  
  
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico  
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire  
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free  
Bringing everything thats near to me nearer to the fire  
  
She looked into my soul through the clothes that I wore  
She said We got a mutual friend over by the door  
And you know hes got our best interest in mind  
He was well connected but her heart was a snare  
And she had left him to die in there  
There were payments due and he was a little behind  
  
The cry of the peacock flies buzz my head  
Ceiling fan broken theres a heat in my bed  
Street band playing Nearer My God to Thee  
We met at the steeple where the mission bells ring  
She said I know what youre thinking but there aint a thing  
You can do about it so let us just agree to agree  
  
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico  
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire  
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free  
Bringing everything thats near to me nearer to the fire  
  
Atlantic City by the cold grey sea  
I hear a voice crying Daddy I always think its for me  
But its only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call  
Every new messenger brings evil report  
Bout armies on the march and time that is short  
And famines and earthquakes and hatred written upon walls  
  
Would I have married her I dont know I suppose  
She had bells in her braids and they hung to her toes  
But I kept hearing my name and I had to be movin on  
I saw screws break loose saw the devil pound tin  
I saw a house in the country being torn from within  
I heard my ancestors calling from the land far beyond  
  
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico  
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire  
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free  
Bringing everything thats near to me nearer to the fire
