A bird is sitting on the pavement  
Someone broke his wing  
Now that bird is going nowhere  
And hes suffering  
  
Now I understand the setup  
I see everything  
And the only way to go  
Is defy is defy is defy  
  
To belong here to belong here to belong here  
Im giving up my soul  
To belong to belong to belong  
  
A spider is sitting in a corner  
Gonna catch a fly  
The web is pulling tight around him  
And the flys I  
But all I do is guard my pile  
Cause its my supply  
And the only way to go  
Is defy is defy is defy  
  
To belong here to belong here to belong here  
Im giving up my soul
