I have journeyed endless miles  
Seen many harbors  
Where I took rest awhile  
On this boat called near and far  
To be what you must  
You must give up what you are  
  
Only on a wind of hope my heart sailed  
Braving mystic oceans to arrive  
Those who do not leave  
And choose to stay  
Barely survive  
  
Be you dust or be you star  
To be what you must  
Just reach out for what you are  
And though youve traveled many roads  
Theres but one way and thats the one you chose
