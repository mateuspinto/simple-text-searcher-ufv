Oooh I love the way you dirty type  
I can take you home on escape  
Oooh I need your backspace in my life  
Thank God you dont have a flat screen  
  
Bridge  
Please baby I got to see you  
And I really want to please you  
So get on my laptop so I can download  
  
Chorus  
Online I love the way you log on  
We can do it all night  
Ill make you dot com  
Baby if you sign on  
Im a make you lights off  
Ooh baby if you log on  
Ill make you dot com  
  
I wanted to link up with you baby at first sight  
With you I get to use my F keys  
I cant wait to give you mega bytes  
I got all the memory youll need  
Let my fingers do the talking  
  
Bridge  
  
Chorus  
  
Ooh baby you want this I know  
I cant wait to give you my hard drive  
My moonlight  
If its alright baby

Ready to shift and control you  
If you want me to

And I really want to please you  
So get on me baby get up on me oh
