I had a spider woman  
And she was so good  
She chained me  
In her web so tight  
I lost the freedom  
Of release that night  
So I stayed right by her  
  
I dreamt I saw a blind man  
Who was singing a song  
About a guy who  
Couldnt take no more  
And the meaning of  
The words he swore  
Told me go find her  
  
She was a spider woman  
But she was good to me  
Spider woman  
But she was good to me  
  
I told her bout my vision  
But she laughed in my face  
So I told her go  
And walk in the street  
But by the time  
She got past my feet  
I lost control
