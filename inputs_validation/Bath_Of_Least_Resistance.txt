Too many words on the tip of my tongue and  
I can never figure out when to speak when to  
Shout when to shut up when to knock myself out  
  
I need a brainwash grey matter bath  
I need all the clutter thrown in the trash  
I need a brainwash cause Im a loon  
So could you please throw my head in a tub I  
Could really use a cerebral scrub wash  
Away what I know its an overrated frontal lobe  
  
Expensive thrills sexual perversity are always filling  
My mind mixed with guilt cause bombs over  
Dresden are kinda bringin me down  
  
I need a brainwash grey matter bath  
I need all the clutter thrown in the trash  
I need a brainwash cause Im a loon  
So could you please throw my head in a tub I  
Could really use a cerebral scrub wash  
Away what I know its an overrated frontal lobe  
  
Cause Im a psycho babble brain a real live loon  
A mixed up maniac Im certifiable so punt  
Me in a room right next to Nickleson and give  
Me Thorazine cause all I want to do is sing  
Traditional songs but I like to sing in  
Minor technologies not making sense so could  
You please put my head in a tub I could  
Really use a cerebral scrub wash away  
What I know its an over rated frontal lobe
