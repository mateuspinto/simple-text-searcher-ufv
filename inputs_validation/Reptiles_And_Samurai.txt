Reptiles and Samurai  
Inhabit my head  
Invading my dreams  
Sleeping in my bed  
They battle but they never die  
  
They hear what I hear  
Watching through my eyes  
They dont like what they see  
  
Reptiles and Samurai  
Are under my skin  
They hide in my mind  
They speak with my tongue  
They run amuck in my terrain  
  
They are not friends  
But they are forced reluctantly  
To share my brain  
  
Reptiles have silly grins  
Dark eyes shiny teeth some have fins  
Samurai they smile never  
Serious pretty swords very clever  
  
Sometimes I watch you from this place way in the sky  
Your face is young and shiny transformed right before my eyes  
Without warning without reason  
To Samurais and lizards  
Reptiles and Samurai

Reptiles and Samurai  
Inhabit my head  
Invading my dreams  
Sleeping in my bed  
They battle but they never die  
  
Reptiles have pretty scales  
They run real fast they like to bite some have tails  
Samurai like their water hot  
Very brave they eat raw fish they fight a lot  
  
Sometimes I watch you from this place way in the sky  
Your face is young and shiny transformed right before my eyes  
Without warning without reason  
To Samurais and lizards  
Reptiles and Samurai  
Samurai and lizards  
Reptiles and Samurai  
  
Reptiles and Samurai
