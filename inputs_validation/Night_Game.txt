There were two men down  
And the score tied  
In the bottom of the eight  
When the pitcher died  
  
And they laid his spikes  
On the pitchers mound  
And his uniform was torn  
And his number was left on the ground  
  
Then the night turned cold  
Colder than the moon  
The stars were white as bones  
The stadium was old  
Older than the screams  
Older than these teams  
  
There were three men down  
And the season lost  
And the tarpaulin was rolled  
Upon the winter frost
