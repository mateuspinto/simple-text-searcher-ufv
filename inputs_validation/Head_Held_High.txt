My mama told me  
Ever since I was seven  
Hold your head up high  
My parents told my  
Ever since I was eleven  
Hold your head up high  
They said the answer  
Was to become a dancer  
Hold your head high  
Oh just like I figured  
Theyre always disfigured  
With their heads up high  
  
Now Im older  
Im getting so much bolder  
With my head up high  
Oh as I figured  
Just like I figured  
Since your heads up high baby  
Oh just like I figured  
You know they was disfigured  
Hold your head up high  
You know they says the answer  
Was to become a dancer  
Hold your head high boy  
  
Ever since I was a baby  
On my mamas knee  
Oh just listened to what  
Everybody told me  
Oh yes I did  
But still the answer  
Was to become a dancer  
And hold your head high  
But just like I figured  
Theyre always disfigured  
They hold their heads up high  
Watch out  
  
Do the dog Oh watch out  
And now Im older  
They say Im so much bolder  
Got your head up high  
Oh and the answer was  
Hey to become a dancer  
Head up high  
Well but just like I figured  
Theyre always disfigured  
They got their heads up high  
But the answer was now  
Boy to become a dancer  
With your head up high  
  
Head up high
