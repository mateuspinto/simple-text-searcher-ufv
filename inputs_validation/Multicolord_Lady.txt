Got on a bus in Memphis  
Destination Rome  
Georgia aint no paradise  
But a place I just call home  
I sat next to a broken hearted bride  
She was cryin tryin so hard to hide  
Her selfish sorrow  
  
I tried to get her talkin  
She didnt have much to say  
She asked me for a map to death row  
But I didnt know the way  
She had lost a million in the game  
One look out the window at the pine trees and the rain  
It wasnt her day  
  
Multicolored lady  
You aint like no rainbow Ive ever seen  
Multicolored lady  
Angry red passion blue but mostly shades of green  
  
Midnight came and brought more rain  
Nothing seemed to ease her pain  
The hours that we talked seemed like minutes all in vein  
I watched as her tears kept runnin wide  
Bye and bye and bye way back after a while  
She started smilin  
  
Multicolored lady  
You aint like no rainbow Ive ever known  
Multicolored lady  
Come go with me Ill take you to my home  
  
Oh by the way Im bound for Rome
