I knew a girl who was almost a lady  
She had a way with all the men in her life  
Every inch of her blossomed in beauty  
And she was born on the fourth of July  
Well she lived in an aluminum house trailer  
And she worked in a juke box saloon  
And she spent all the money that I give her  
Just to see the old man in the moon  
I used to sleep at the foot of old glory  
And awake in the dawns early light  
But much to my surprise when I opened my eyes  
I was a victim of the great compromise  
Well wed go out on Saturday evenings  
To the drivein on Route 41  
And it was there that I first suspected  
That she was doin what shed already done  
She said Johnny wont you get me some popcorn  
And she knew I had to walk pretty far  
And as soon as I passed through the moonlight  
She hopped into a foreign sports car  
I used to sleep at the foot of old glory  
And awake in the dawns early light  
But much to my surprise when I opened my eyes  
I was a victim of the great compromise  
Well you know I could have beat up that fellow  
But it was her that had hopped into his car  
Many times Id fought to protect her  
But this time she was goin too far  
Now some folks they call me a coward  
Cause I left her at the drivein that night  
But Id rather have names thrown at me  
Than to fight for a thing that aint right  
I used to sleep at the foot of old glory  
And awake in the dawns early light  
But much to my surprise when I opened my eyes  
I was a victim of the great compromise  
Now she writes all the fellows love letters  
Saying Greetings come and see me real soon  
And they go and line up in the barroom  
And spend the night in that sick womans room  
But sometimes I get awful lonesome  
And I wish she was my girl instead  
But she wont let me live with her  
And she makes me live in my head  
I used to sleep at the foot of old glory  
And awake in the dawns early light  
But much to my surprise when I opened my eyes  
I was a victim of the great compromise
