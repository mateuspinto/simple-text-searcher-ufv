Amos Moses was a Cajun  
And lived by himself in the swamp  
Hunting alligator for a living  
Knock em on the head with a stump  
The Louisiana laws gonna get you Amos  
It aint legal hunting alligator down in the swamp boy  
  
Now everybody blamed his old man  
for raising him mean as a snake  
When Amos Moses was a boy  
his Daddy would use him as alligator bait  
Tie a rope around his waist  
throw him in the swamp  
Alligator bait on the Louisiana bayou  
  
Just about 45 minutes  
southeast of Tipidow Louisiana  
There lived a man called Duck Bill Sam  
and his pretty wife Hannah  
They raised up a son that could  
eat up his weight in groceries  
Named him after a man of the cloth  
They called him Amos Moses  
  
Now folks in South Louisiana  
said Amos was a helluva man  
He could trap the biggest meanest alligator  
He only had to use one hand  
Thats all he got left  
cause the alligator bit him Ha ha  
Left arm gone clean up to the elbow  
  
Just about 45 minutes  
southeast of Tipidow Louisiana  
There lived a man called Duck Bill Sam  
and his pretty wife Hannah  
They raised up a son that could  
eat up his weight in groceries  
Named him after a man of the cloth  
They called him Amos Moses  
  
Here comes Amos  
And you should have seen his pretty wife Hannah  
  
Well the Sheriff got wind that  
Amos was in the swamp hunting alligator skin  
So he hid in the swamp Im gonna get you boy  
He never did come out again  
  
Well I wonder where the Louisiana Sheriff went to  
Sure can get lost in the Louisiana bayou 3X
