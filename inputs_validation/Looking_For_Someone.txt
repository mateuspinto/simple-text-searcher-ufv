Looking for someone  
I guess Im doing that  
Trying to find a memory in a dark room  
Dirty man youre looking like a Buddha I know you well  
Yeah  
  
Keep on a straight line  
I dont believe I can  
Trying to find a needle in a haystack  
Chilly wind youre piercing like a dagger it hurts me so  
Yeah  
  
Nobody needs to discover me Im back again  
You see the sunlight through the trees to keep you warm  
in peaceful shades of green  
Yet in the darkness of my mind  
Damascus wasnt far behind  
  
Lost in a subway  
I guess Im losing time  
Theres a man looking at a magazine  
Youre such a fool your mumbojumbo never tells me anything  
Yeah  
  
Nobody needs to discover me Im back again  
You feel the ashes from the fire that kept you warm  
its comfort disappears  
And still the only friend I know  
Will never tell me where I go  
  
Looking for someone and now Ive found myself a name  
Come away leave me all that I have I will give  
Leave me leave me all that I am I will give
