There goes the man who gave his heart to someone  
I feel sorry for him  
For that someone just gave her to me  
Now hes the loser an it hurts so much to lose  
An I feel sorry for him  
Cause the loser I know could have been me  
  
Oh how he loved her  
Im sure he must have loved her almost as much as me  
But fate has frowned on him  
Then turned around and smiled on me  
  
There goes a man who gave his heart to someone  
I feel sorry for him  
Cause that someone just gave her to me  
  
If things were different  
If he had won her heart instead of me  
I wonder if hed find the time  
To offer sympathy  
  
There goes a man who gave his heart to someone  
I feel sorry for him  
For that someone just gave her to me
