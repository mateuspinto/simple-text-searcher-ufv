I prayed for something I could never understand  
The Sword of Shiva to deliver me to unimagined lands  
And there you were  
  
I asked for something that could catch me by surprise  
To leap into the belly of the beast to rip me up and bring me out alive  
And there you were  
  
Into your eyes  
Im falling rain  
Into your eyes  
A hurricane  
Into your eyes  
Im coming home  
Im holding on  
Im letting go  
  
Oh Im flying free  
Oer the land of the prophecy  
All my future below  
Oh I pledge my life  
All I am to be by your side  
Then you whisper that all you need of me  
Is Just to Breathe  
  
Initiation to the wisdom of the heart  
An invocation know to humble men  
And tear their worlds apart  
And there you were  
  
I prayed every night nday for something to believe  
Some brand of magic that could lift me up and bring me to my knees  
And there you were  
  
Into your eyes  
Im falling rain  
Into your eyes  
A hurricane  
Into your eyes  
Im coming home  
Im holding on  
Im letting go  
  
Oh Im flying free  
Oer the land of the prophecy  
All my future below  
Oh I pledge my life  
All I am to be by your side  
Sworn to love you as long as I shall breathe  
  
In every other lovers eyes  
Keep it up keep it up keep it up all your life  
In the line of duty we can never do enough  
I am surrendered  
I am ascended on love  
  
Im flying free  
Oer the land of the prophecy  
All of my future before my eyes and  
Oh I pledge my life  
All I am to be by your side  
Come and take me home  
  
Oh my fathers son  
New reborn as the chosen one  
Now he kneels at your feet  
Oh I pledge my life  
All I am to be by your side  
Come and take me home
