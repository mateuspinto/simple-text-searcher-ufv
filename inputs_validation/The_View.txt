I am a chorus of the voices  
That gather up the magnets  
Set before me  
  
I attract you and repel you  
A science of the heart  
And blood and meaning  
  
The coldness of most beauties  
Is a challenge that our youth  
Must quickly conquer  
There is no time for guilt  
Or second guessing second guessing  
Based on feeling  
  
I am the truth the beauty  
That causes you to cross  
Your sacred boundaries  
  
I have no morals  
Some think me cheap  
And someone who despises  
The normalcy of heartbreak  
The purity of love  
  
But I worship the young  
And just formed angel  
Who sits upon the pin of lust  
Everything else  
Bores me  
I want to see your suicide  
I want to see you give it up  
  
Your life of reason  
I want you on the floor  
And in a coffin your soul shaking  
I want to have you doubting  
Every meaning youve amassed  
Like a fortune  
  
Oh throw it away  
  
For worship someone  
Who actively despises you  
For worship someone  
Who actively despises you  
  
I am the root  
I am the progress  
Im the aggressor  
I am the tablet  
These ten stories  
  
Worship  
Worship  
  
Pain and evil have their place  
Sittin here beside me  
I offer them to you as servants  
Of the gold that you must give  
  
Pain and evil have their place  
Sitting here beside me  
And Ill offer them I offer them to you  
As servants of the gold  
That you must give to me  
  
I want to see your suicide  
I want to see you give it up give it up  
Your your life of reason  
I want to see you on the floor  
  
And in a coffin soul shaking  
Soul shaking  
I want to have you doubting  
Every meaning youve amassed  
Like a fortune like a fortune  
Throw it away  
  
For worship of someone  
Who actively despises you  
Who actively despises you  
  
I am the view  
I am the table  
I am the view  
I am the table  
I am all this  
I am the root  
the progress  
the aggressor  
I am the table  
I am the ten stories  
I am the table  
I am I am I am I am  
I am
