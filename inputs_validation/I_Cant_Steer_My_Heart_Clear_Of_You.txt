Take me for granted I think that I could stand it  
After all these rough seas  
Left me reckless and abandoned  
Say the spirits willing chance a new beginning  
Break down the cold front  
Give me peace and understanding  
  
And you wait and you wonder  
Will she still beat the drum and bring the thunder  
Will she still be the star to see me through  
Cause I cant steer my heart clear of you  
  
No I cant steer my heart clear of you  
Its the way its been ever since you sailed  
Out of a storm and into view  
And should I drift away the compass holds the clue  
You control the weather  
And I cant steer my heart clear of you  
  
Make me your penance show me your innocence  
Everything is history  
From the aching to the pleasure  
We enjoy the torture the slow pain that it taught us  
Everything gets twisted  
Let me burn or bring me water
