Nothing bad ever happens to me  
Nothing bad ever happens to me  
Why should I care  
A man broke into my neighborhood  
He threatened the family with a loaded gun  
He tied them all up and beat em real good  
He took everything and he got away clean  
And I cant believe that anyone would  
Wanna do such a terrible thing  
But why should I care  
Did ya hear about Fred hes unemployed  
They threw him away like a useless toy  
He went down the drain after 20 long years  
No warning no pension and nobodys tears  
And I cant believe that anyone would  
Wanna do such a terrible thing  
But why should I care  
Why should I care  
Every time I look around this place  
I see them scream but I hear no sound  
And the terrible things happen down the road  
To someone else that I dont even know  
CHORUS  
Nothing bad ever happens to me  
Nothing bad ever happens to me  
Nothing bad ever happens to me  
Nothing bad ever happens to me  
Why should I care  
Have you heard about the Joneses my my my  
It happened so quick and no one knows why  
Their teenage son he seemed OK  
But his suicide ruined everyones day  
And I cant believe that anyone would  
Wanna do such a terrible thing  
But why should I care  
CHORUS  
Nothing bad ever happens to me  
Nothing bad ever happens to me
