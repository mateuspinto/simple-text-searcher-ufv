Oh yeah oh  
On a foggy road just before sunrise  
Dont you lose control you could lose your life  
Keep your hands on the wheel and  
your eyes straight ahead  
Dont forget what the good book says  
You think it can never happen to you  
But it happens all the time  
  
On a full moon night something aint right  
Didnt see it til about midnight  
When it happened it seemed kind of weird  
Things like this seem to appear  
From the shadows of a full moon night  
  
Never had a clock that goes at night  
That was the way of the simple life  
Right down the road come a big surprise  
Man shot his wife than took his own life  
You think it can never happen to you  
But it happens all the time  
  
On a full moon night something aint right  
Started out as an innocent fight  
Never should have happened not around here  
Things like this seem to appear  
From the shadows of a full moon night  
  
On a full moon night something aint right  
Didnt see it til about midnight  
When it happened it seemed kind of weird  
Things like this seem to appear  
From the shadows of a full moon night  
  
On a full moon night something aint right  
Started out as an innocent fight  
Never should have happened not around here  
Things like this seem to appear  
From the shadows of a full moon night
