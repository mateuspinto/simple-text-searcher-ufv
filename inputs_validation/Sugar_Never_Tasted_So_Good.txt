Sugar never tasted so good  
Sugar never tasted so good  
Sugar never tasted good to me  
Yeah  
  
Until her eyes crossed over  
Until her mind crossed over  
Until her soul fell next to me  
Yeah  
  
Now  
If the wrinkle that is in your brain  
Has given ya quite a sting  
Your fingers have become a crane  
Pullin on these puppet strings  
  
What a feelin thats begun  
What a feelin thats begun  
  
What a feelin thats begun  
What a feelin thats begun  
  
I felt just like a baby  
Until I held a baby  
What a fool this boy can be  
Yeah  
  
And her thoughts like a daisy  
Till my mind gets lazy  
I must have been crazy not to see  
  
Now  
If the wrinkle that is in your brain  
Has given ya quite a sting  
Your fingers have become a crane  
Your fingers have become a crane  
Your fingers have become a crane  
Pullin on these puppet strings  
  
Water never tasted so good  
Water never tasted so good  
Water never tasted good to me
