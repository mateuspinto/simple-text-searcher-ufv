So much pain and no good reason why  
You cried until the tears run dry  
Nothing else can make you understand  
The one thing that you held so dear  
Is slipping from your hand  
  
And you say  
Why why why  
Does it go this way  
And why why why  
And all I can say is  
  
Somewhere down the road  
Therell be answers to the questions  
Somewhere down the road  
Though we cannot see it now  
And somewhere down the road  
You will find mighty arms reaching for you  
And they will have the answers  
At the end of the road  
  
Yesterday I thought Id seen it all  
I thought Id climbed the highest wall  
But now I see that learning never ends  
And all I know to do is keep on walking  
Round the bend  
  
Singing  
Why why why  
Does it go this way  
Why why why  
And all I can say is  
  
Somewhere down the road  
Therell be answers to the questions  
Somewhere down the road  
Though we cannot see it now  
And somewhere down the road  
You will find mighty arms reaching for you  
And they will hold the answers  
At the end of the road  
  
Somewhere somewhere down  
And somewhere down the road  
Therell be answers to the questions  
Somewhere down the road  
Though we cannot see it now  
And somewhere down the road  
You will find mighty arms reaching for you  
They will have the answers  
At the end of the road  
  
They will have the answers  
At the end of the road  
  
Somewhere down the road yeah  
Somewhere somewhere  
Somewhere somewhere somewhere down the road  
Why why why  
There will be arms reaching down the road  
Somewhere somewhere somewhere  
Oooh
