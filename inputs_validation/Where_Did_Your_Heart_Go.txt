I spend my nights down on the wharf  
In unlit alleyways  
By the church downtown  
Where Sally prays  
Come down sometime  
Well share a rusty can of corn  
And listen to the radio  
I love you I love you it says  
  
Chorus  
Where did your heart go  
Did you put it on a train  
Did you leave it in the rain  
Or down in Mexico  
  
You cry but I dont know  
Ive heard it all before  
There it goes again the slamming of the door  
Sometimes the river calls me  
And at night it calls my name  
Says put your troubles down beside me  
Things have always been the same  
And rock n roll wont teach me  
What the river said that night  
I jumped into this beauty  
And drifted out of sight  
  
Chorus
