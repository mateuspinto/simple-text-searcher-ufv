The sun comes up  
The breakfast show  
Cant you see me running  
Its crazy dont you know  
Dont you know Dont you know  
  
The moon is high  
Im working through the night  
Will somebody tell me  
Where do all the hours go  
I dont know  I dont know  
  
It dont stop  
No its never gonna stop  
Why do I have to wear so many things on my head  
Hats  
  
One day Im a mother  
One day Im a lover  
What am I supposed to do  
Hats  
Working for a livin  
All because Im driven  
To be the very best for you  
  
The water is hot  
So hot  
The phone dont stop  
Hello goodbye  
So how do I manage  
To hold on to my sanity  
I dont know baby I dont know  
  
The red dress on  
Time for having fun  
Time for having fun  
But can I really be  
The girl you think you see in me  
  
The spirit is willing  
But the flesh is weak  
Why do I have to wear so many things on my head  
Hats  
  
One day Im a mother  
One day Im a mother  
One day Im a lover  
One day Im a lover  
What am I supposed to do  
Hats  
Working for a livin  
Working for a livin  
All because Im driven  
All because Im driven  
To be the very best for you  
  
Hats  
One day Im a mother  
One day Im a mother  
One day Im a lover  
One day Im a lover  
What am I supposed to do  
Hats  
Working for a livin  
All because Im driven  
To be the very best for you  
  
This may be a dream come true  
This may be poetry in motion  
This may be a dream come true  
But when it all comes down  
Its an awful lot to do  
  
Hats  
It dont stop  
No its never gonna stop  
Why do I have to wear things on my head  
Hats  
  
One day Im a mother  
One day Im a mother  
One day Im a lover  
One day Im a lover  
What am I supposed to do  
Hats  
Working for a livin  
Working for a livin  
All because Im driven  
All because Im driven  
To be the very best for you  
Hats  
  
One day Im a mother  
One day Im a mother  
One day Im a lover  
One day Im a lover  
What am I supposed to do  
Hats  
Working for a livin  
All because Im driven  
To be the very best  
Very best Nah Nah Nah  
  
Hats  
What am I supposed to do  
Hats  
Working for a livin  
Working for a livin  
All because Im driven  
All because Im driven  
To be the very best  
  
It dont stop  
No its never gonna stop  
Why do I have to wear  
Why to I have to wear  
Hats  
  
One day Im a mother  
One day Im a lover  
What am I supposed to do  
Hats  
Working for a livin  
All because Im driven  
To be the very best for you
