Look at me you can watch me  
Listen to me you can hear me  
Talk to me you can yell at me  
Play with me you infuriate me  
  
Look at me just watch me  
Try to see  but you better not touch me  
Look at me just watch me  
Try to see me through but you better not touch me  
  
Does it make you feel better to know that Im here to stay  
Does it make you feel better to know my heart is locked away  
Does it make you feel safer knowing I wont get away  
Does it make you feel safer to have my soul in chains  
  
Watching you I can look at you  
Hearing you I can listen to you  
Yelling at you I cant talk to you  
Feeling you I wish I could touch you  
  
Look at me just watch me  
Try to see  but you better not touch me  
Look at me just watch me  
Try to see me through but you better not touch me  
  
Does it make you feel better to know   
Does it make you feel better to know that Im here to stay  
Does it make you feel better  
Does it make you feel safer knowing I wont get away  
  
Does it make you feel safer to have my soul in chains
