Come for a dream  
Come and love in the sun  
Come and stay  
Just as long as you may  
Sunny love for a day  
Sunny love may not stay  
  
Love may be glowing fantasy  
Young love is free  
Come for a smile  
Making love in the sun  
Like kaleidoscope rainbow begun  
  
Sunny love making fun  
Sunny love making one  
Magic sensation in the sun  
Come for a while  
Run away from sorrow  
Run away tomorrow  
One special day  
Warm and dazzling  
We climb a tree  
Making love in the sea  
Sunny love come and be  
Sunny love you and me  
  
Imagination is the key  
Sing me away mmm  
  
Run away from longing  
Run into belonging  
Come for a dream  
Come and love in the sun  
Come and stay just as long as you may  
Sunny love for a day  
Sunny love may not stay  
Love may be glowing fantasy  
Young love is free  
Mmm da da dumb da da mmm da da dumb da da
