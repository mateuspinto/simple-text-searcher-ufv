All the people were waiting for crazy face  
He said hed meet them at his favorite place  
Dressed in black stain white linen and lace  
With his head held high and a smile on his face  
  
He said  
Ladies and Gentlemen the prince is late  
As he stood outside the churchyard gate  
And polished up on his 38 and said  
I got it from Jesse James
