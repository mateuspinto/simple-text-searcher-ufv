I never will forget the station where we met  
You dropped your skis a happy circumstance  
No one would have guessed we had started  
Started a winter romance  
  
And all the way to Maine  
On that enchanted train  
The passing scenery didnt get a glance  
We held hands completely light hearted  
Off to a winter romance  
  
We danced that night by candle light  
The world was white with snow  
The way we felt we never felt  
The snow could melt and go  
But though the snow is gone the romance lingers on  
And those that said it didnt stand a chance  
Will know when they see us together  
That loves not been controlled by the weather  
And all of our summers well have our winter romance  
  
Though the snow is gone the romance lingers on  
And those that said it didnt stand a chance  
Will know when they see us together  
That loves not been controlled by the weather  
And all of our summers well have our winter romance
