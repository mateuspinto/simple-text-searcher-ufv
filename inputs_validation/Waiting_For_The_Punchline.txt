You might say hey I lost my sense of humor  
Im quite surprised I didnt lose it sooner  
Why waste your breath on anything less  
Then talk so trivial  
As a man who ran out of material  
  
Chorus  
Why did the chicken go across the road  
To get to the other side  
Im still waiting for the punchline  
Whoever said the grass always grows  
Greener on the other lied  
Im still waiting for the punchline  
  
The good ol days I was known to wear a smile  
Like all good things theyve gone out of style  
I will admit usually a quick wit  
I found bemusing  
What used to be no longer are amusing  
  
Chorus  
  
Its nothing that you said  
No nothing that you did  
Must have been a bad joke  
Thats gone over my head  
What me worry another tragedy  
The latter plus time equals comedy  
  
Why cant I get to the other side
