With a voice you could hear all the way to the rocky top  
Play by play for thirtyone years it never stopped  
We heard 20 15 10 and 5 your voice was our eyes and we could see  
Touchdown Tennessee  
  
Quarterback rolled right it was a long throw down field to willie Gault For a  
Second no one knew if it was caught  
We heard 20 15 10 and 5 your voice was our eyes and we could see  
Touchdown Tennessee  
  
Your voice painted us a picture of all the losses and the wins  
And its so hard to imagine a game without your voice again  
Saying 20 15 10 and 5 your voice was our eyes and we could see  
Touchdown Tennessee  
  
So thank you John what a run its been fun for us all  
All the way are hearts pounded when you called  
20 15 10 and 5 your voice was our eyes and we could see  
Touchdown Tennessee  
  
So thank you John
