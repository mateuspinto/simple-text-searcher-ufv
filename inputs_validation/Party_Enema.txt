Hangin out in long beach  
A lil party in the sun but ya just cant sit there smoking and drinking
anymore  
You got a new jive All your friends are getting weird Ahhh  
It goes you aint a shakin till the shit shot  
  
Shoot it up  
No one jammin til the gin juice jigger jets  
They say it aint a party til the party enema the party enema  
You get a funnel tube pour in a 40 oz  
  
Pull down your clothes touch your toes  
Get a hose hold your nose  
Its a party hat Forget the beer bong  
Forget the nitrous shots  
  
It goes you aint a shakin til the shit shot  
Shoot it up  
No one jammin til the gin juice jigger jets  
They say it aint a party til the party enema the party enema  
  
The party enema the party enema  
The party enema the party enema
