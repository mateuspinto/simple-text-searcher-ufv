Do you need the walls to spread apart  
Somethings been sent here  
To free you I am told  
A rising power that will break you  
Break you out youll see  
Your fantasy unfold  
It can be won  
We will be one  
So many eyes that never open  
Too many chains that bind  
The dreams that make us see  
There are no prisons in our kingdom  
Will you give your hand  
Say yes Your Majesty  
It can be won  
We will be one  
Always go on  
Never saying you are done  
Were always looking for  
A place where magic passion soars  
Youll find that if youre with us  
The magics in your heart  
It can be won  
We will be one  
Now can you see  
The gift we bring  
Your Majesty
