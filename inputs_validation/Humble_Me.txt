Went out on a limb  
Gone too far  
I broke down at the side of the road  
Stranded at the outskirts and suns creepin up  
  
Babys in the backseat  
Still fast asleep  
Dreamin of better days  
I dont want to call you but youre all I have to turn to  
  
What do you say  
When its all gone away  
Baby I didnt mean to hurt you  
The truth spoke in whispers will tear you apart  
No matter how hard you resist it  
It never rains when you want it to  
  
You humble me lord  
Humble me lord  
Im on my knees empty  
You humble me lord  
You humble me lord  
So please please please forgive me  
  
Baby teresa shes got your eyes  
I see you all the time  
When she asks about her daddy  
I never know what to say  
  
Heard you kicked the bottle  
And helped to build the church  
You carry an honest wage  
Is it true you have someone keeping you company  
  
What do you say  
When its all gone away  
Baby I didnt mean to hurt you  
Truth spoke in whispers will tear you apart  
No matter how hard you resist it  
It never rains when you want it to  
  
You humble me lord  
Humble me lord  
Im on my knees empty  
You humble me lord  
You humble me lord  
So please please forgive me  
  
You humble me
