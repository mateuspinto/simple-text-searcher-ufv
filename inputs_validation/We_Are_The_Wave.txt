The sea will wash against the rock  
The rock stands strong the rock is strong  
The sea will wash against the rock  
But before too long the rock is gone  
  
The wind will blow against the stone  
The stone stands strong the stone is strong  
The wind will blow against the stone  
but before too long the stone is gone  
  
Patience gentlemen we move closer every day  
Patience gentlemen the stone will soon give way  
  
We are the wave  
We are the flow  
We are the wind  
And soon the rock must go  
We are the wave  
We are the flow  
We are the wind  
And soon the rock must go  
  
You cannot hold back the tide  
The tide must rise the tide must rise  
Its the law of earth and skies  
The tide will rise the tide will rise  
Its as natural as day to night  
As day to night day to night  
As natural as black and white  
Black and white black and white  
  
Patience gentlemen the flower can grow up through the stone  
Patience gentlemen its a truth that we have always known  
  
We are the wave  
We are the flow  
We are the wind  
And soon the rock must go  
We are the force  
We are the fire  
We are the move  
Moving higher and higher  
We are the force  
We are the fire  
We are the move  
Moving higher and higher  
  
We are the wave  
We are the flow  
We are the wind  
And soon the rock must go  
We are the wave  
We are the flow  
We are the wind  
We are the flow  
We are the wave  
We are the flow  
We are the wind  
And soon the rock must go  
We are the wave  
We are the flow  
We are the wind  
We are the flow
