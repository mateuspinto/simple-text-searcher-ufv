  
Well he was Thailand based  
She was an airforce wife  
He used to fly weekends  
It was the easy life  
But then it turned around  
And he began to change  
She didnt wonder then  
She didnt think it strange  
But then he got a call  
He had to leave that night  
He couldnt say too much  
But it would be alright  
He didnt need to pack  
Theyd meet the next night  
He had a job to do  
Flying to Cambodia  
  
And as the nights passed by  
She tried to trace the past  
The way he used to look  
The way he used to laugh  
I guess shell never know  
What got inside his soul  
She couldnt make it out  
Just couldnt take it all  
He had the saddest eyes  
The girl had ever seen  
He used to cry some nights  
As though he lived a dream  
And as she held him close  
He used to search her face  
As though she knew the truth  
Lost inside Cambodia  
  
But then a call came through  
They said hed soon be home  
She had to pack a case  
And they would make a rendezvous  
But now a year has passed  
And not a single word  
And all the love she knew  
Has disappeared out in the haze  
Cambodia  Dont cry now  No tears now  
  
And now the years have passed  
With not a single word  
But there is only one thing left  
I know for sure  
She wont see his face again
