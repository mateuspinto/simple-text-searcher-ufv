What if Christmas didnt come this year  
And no one paid for Christmas cheer  
Who would cry the biggest tear  
The child or the store  
Why do brides wear virgin white  
Most do not deserve that right  
But to choose a color of their delight  
Would surely bring on the frowns  
To defy the laws of tradition  
Is a crusade only of the brave  
Suppose the taxman he comes to town  
And you dont lay your money down  
Yet Mr Jones he killed Mr Brown the other day  
Well I wonder whos gonna go to hell
