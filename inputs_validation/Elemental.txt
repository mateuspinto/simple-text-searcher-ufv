This race is already run  
Get off your horse get on this train  
 Welcome to the real world   
I said  Welcome to the real world   
Are we rushing like the wind  
Naked out and naked in  
 Welcome to the free world   
I said  Welcome to the me world   
Are we rushing like the wind  
Put your lovin arms around  
Did you lose your faith in God no  
Does your conscience always get you down  
Fall to pieces rough and tumble  
Does your conscience always get you down  
These days its all the mind  
Its Elemental  
Dont say your up when your down  
Its Elemental  
Put your lovin arms around  
This your new years resolution  
Put your lovin arms around  
Nothing doing resolution  
Put your lovin arms around  
Take another leap in the dark  
With a humble heart  
Do yourself some good  
What did you become  
Patience be sure  
Baby baby  
These days its all the mind  
Its Elemental  
Dont say your up when your down  
Its Elemental
