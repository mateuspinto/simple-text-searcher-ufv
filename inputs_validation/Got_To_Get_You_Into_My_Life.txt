I was alone I took a ride  
I didnt know what I would find there  
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there  
  
Ooh then I suddenly see you  
Ooh did I tell you I need you  
Every single day of my life  
  
You didnt run you didnt lie  
You knew I wanted just to hold you  
And had you gone you knew in time wed meet again  
For I had told you  
  
Ooh you were meant to be near me  
Ooh and I want you hear me  
Say well be together every day  
  
Got to get you into my life  
What can I do what can I be  
When Im with you I want to stay there  
If Im true Ill never leave  
And if I do I know the way there  
  
Ooh then I suddenly see you  
Ooh did I tell you I need you  
Every single day of my life  
  
Got to get you into my life  
Got to get you into my life  
  
I was alone I took a ride  
I didnt know what I would find there  
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there  
  
Then suddenly I see you  
Did I tell you I need you
