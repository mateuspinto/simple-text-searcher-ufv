When I look back boy I must have been green  
Bopping in the country fishing in a stream  
Looking for an answer trying to find a sign  
Until I saw your city lights honey I was blind  
  
They said get back honky cat  
Better get back to the woods  
Well I quit those days and my redneck ways  
And oh the change is gonna do me good  
  
You better get back honky cat  
Living in the city aint where its at  
Its like trying to find gold in a silver mine  
Its like trying to drink whiskey from a bottle of wine  
  
Well I read some books and I read some magazines  
About those highclass ladies down in New Orleans  
And all the folks back home well said I was a fool  
They said oh believe in the Lord is the golden rule  
  
They said stay at home boy you gotta tend the farm  
Living in the city boy is going to break your heart  
But how can you stay when your heart says no  
How can you stop when your feet say go
