Verse 1  
Sometimes Ive had too much to drink  
Get all stoned and play some Hank  
I guess thats just the way I am  
And I love the man from Galilee  
Because he died for you and me  
I met them both in Dixieland  
  
Hook  
Cuz Ive got Jesus and Bocephus  
They both help me to live my life  
I went from Jim Beam to my bible  
With Jesus and Bocephus right there by my side  
  
Verse 2  
When the water all turned into wine  
I lost my mind for a time  
I felt them both holding my hand  
Looking through these bloodshot eyes  
Praise The Lord I saw the light  
And two sets of footprints in the sand  
  
Hook  
Cuz Ive got Jesus and Bocephus  
They both help me to live my life  
I went from Jim Beam to my bible  
With Jesus and Bocephus right there by my side  
  
I was cashing in I was casting stones  
I was lost in sin I was on my own  
But now I dont feel alone  
Cuz Ive got Jesus and Bocephus  
They both help me to live my life  
I went from Jim Beam to my bible  
With Jesus and Bocephus right here by my side  
With Jesus and Bocephus right here until the day I die  
  
Jesus and Bocephus
