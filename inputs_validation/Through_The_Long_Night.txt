The cold hands  
The sad eyes  
The dark Irish silence  
Its so late  
But Ill wait  
Through the long night with you  
With you  
The warm tears  
The bad dreams  
The soft trembling shoulders  
The old fears  
But Im here  
Through the long night with you  
With you  
Oh what has it cost you  
I almost lost you  
A long long time ago  
Oh you should have told me  
But you had to bleed to know  
All your past sins  
Are since past  
You should be sleeping  
Its all right  
Sleep tight  
Through the long night with me  
With me  
No I didnt start it  
Youre broken hearted  
From a long long time ago  
Oh the way you hold me  
Is all that I need to know  
And its so late  
But Ill wait  
Through the long night with you  
With you
