At the record company meeting  
On their hands  a dead star  
And oh the plans they weave  
And oh the sickening greed  
  
At the record company party  
On their hands  a dead star  
The sycophantic slags all say   
I knew him first and I knew him well  
  
Reissue Repackage Repackage  
Reevaluate the songs  
Doublepack with a photograph  
Extra track and a tacky badge  
  
Alist playlist  
Please them  please them   
Please them   
sadly this was your life  
  
But you could have said no  
If youd wanted to  
You could have said no  
If youd wanted to  
  
BPI MTV BBC  
Please them  Please then  
sadly this was your life  
  
But you could have said no  
If youd wanted to  
You could have walked away  
Couldnt you  
  
I touched you at the soundcheck  
You had no real way of knowing  
In my heart I begged Take me with you   
I dont care where youre going  
  
But to you I was faceless  
I was fawning I was boring  
Just a child from those ugly new houses  
Who could never begin to know  
  
Who could never really know  
Oh  
  
Best of Most of  
Satiate the need  
Slip them into different sleeves  
Buy both and feel deceived  
  
Climber  new entry reentry  
World tour media whore  
Please the Press in Belgium  
This was your life  
  
And when it fails to recoup   
Well maybe   
You just havent earned it yet baby  
  
I walked a pace behind you at the soundcheck  
Youre just the same as I am  
What makes most people feel happy  
Leads us headlong into harm  
  
So in my bedroom in those ugly new houses  
I danced my legs down to the knees  
But me and my true love  
Will never meet again  
  
At the record company meeting  
On their hands  at last  A dead star   
But they can never taint you in my eyes  
No they can never touch you now  
  
No they cannot hurt you my darling  
They cannot touch you now  
But me and my true love  
Will never meet again
