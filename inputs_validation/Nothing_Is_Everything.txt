Living like us and sharing our day  
In another world very far away  
A different existence yet virtually the same  
Aggression is sadness and laughter is pain  
Look deep into their eyes for what they have to say  
Emotions take control of life everyday  
Unpredictable variations of behavior  
Hold the key to the mental door  
Where nothing is everything and everything is nothing  
Staring beyond the wall a thousand times over  
  
Seeing a part of them that is real  
Just imagine how it might feel  
To be denied of what life has to give  
Behind mental shadows they must live  
Look deep into their eyes for what they have to say  
Emotions take control of life everyday
