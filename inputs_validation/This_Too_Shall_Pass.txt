In the middle of the turbulence surrounding you  
These trying times that are so hard to endure  
In the middle of what seems to be your darkest hour  
Hold fast your heart and be assured  
  
Chorus  
This too shall pass  
Like every night thats come before it  
Hell never give you more than you can bear  
This too shall pass  
So in this thought be comforted  
Its in His Hands  
This too shall pass  
  
The Father knows the tears you cry before they fall  
He feels your pain His heart and yours are one  
The Father knows that sorrows heavy chains are strong  
But with His strength youll overcome  
  
Chorus  
  
So set your eyes upon the mountain  
And lift your hands up to the sky  
And let His arms of love surround you  
And take you to the other side  
  
Chorus
