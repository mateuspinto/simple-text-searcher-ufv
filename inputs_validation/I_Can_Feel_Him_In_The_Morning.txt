I Can Feel Him In The Morning  
  
Child 1  
He kind of started all the plants growing and he started people Well I
guess hes kind of big and fat  
  
Child 2  
He can see us wherever we do  whatever we do He has such powerful eyes 
he has to have millions and thousands and billions And he can still see us
when were bad  
  
Child 3  
He could be sitting on the table right now but you cant see him  
  
Child 4  
He cant be everywhere at once doing everything for everybdy Everybody cant
get what they want  
  
Child 5  
Well his job is to make us good and to make us happy and make us parents
happy  
  
Child 6  
Good is the right thing and bad is the wrong thing  
  
Child 7  
When Im good my mother never yells at me when Im bad she does  
  
Child 8  
Good means to obey your mother and father to do what the teacher says  the
things right I feel miserable when Im  when Im bad I feel miserable on
the inside but on the outside I just feel like I  I feel now  
  
Child 9  
I think  um um  there are more people that are bad than there are good
And um  if youre good youll live forever And if youre bad youll
die when you die  repeat last sentence two more times to fade in echo  
  
Take me down to the water let me feel it run over me  
Let me feel the pain and the coldness the loneliness that there must be  
Whoa cant you see their dreams as they go drifting by  
Whoa cant you see their faces and their tearsoaked eyes  
  
CHORUS  
I can feel him in the morning I can feel him in the evening too  
I can hear him in the morning tellin me what I got to do  
Got to make a new world ought to make the old one right  
I can see him in the morning I can see him in the stars at night  
  
Take me out to the battlefield let me hear the shells flying by  
Let me hear the sound of the cannons let me hear them scream and cry  
Whoa cant you hear their dreams as they tumble to the bloodsoaked ground  
Whoa hear them scream for shelter from the world they never found  
  
CHORUS  
  
Oooo Oooo Oooo Ooooooo repeated out to end
