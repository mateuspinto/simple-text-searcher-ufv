Like so many girls Jenny Wren could sing  
But a broken heart took her soul away  
  
Like the other girls Jenny Wren took wing  
She could see the world and its foolish ways  
  
How we spend our days casting love aside  
Loosing site of life day by day  
  
She saw poverty breaking all the home  
Wounded warriors took her song away  
  
But the day will come Jenny Wren will sing  
When this broken world mends its foolish ways  
  
Now we spend our days catching up on life  
All because of you Jenny Wren  
  
You saw who we are Jenny Wren
