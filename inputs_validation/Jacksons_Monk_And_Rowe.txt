Sisters four and brothers three  
Hanging off the family tree  
Practicing for getting old  
Do you want your fortune told  
Theyre looking for you high and low  
Now theres nowhere for you to go  
So youll just have to come out and face the music  
Jacksons monk and Rowe  
  
Long ago when we were kids and we cut your hair to bits  
As we carried off like spoils the heads wed smash right off  
Your dolls  
But the wind is changing you know  
Are you sure of your friends and your foe  
Have you got what it takes to carry it off  
Jacksons Monk and Rowe  
  
As the sun beats down and life begins to complicate  
Will we both incinerate  
If we touch that brass nameplate  
  
Messrs all noble sirs  
Highly paid solicitors  
Find enclosed my signed divorce  
Sad proceedings you endorse  
The burden of pity will show  
In the people we used to know  
Have you got enough strength to carry it off  
Jacksons Monk and Rowe
