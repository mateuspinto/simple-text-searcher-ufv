Wynonas got herself a big brown beaver and she shows it off to all her
friends  
One day you know that beaver tried to leave her so she caged him up with
cyclone fence  
Along came Lou with the old baboon and said I recognize that smellSmells
like seven layersThat beaver eatin Taco Bell  
  
Now Rex he was a Texan out of New Orleans and he travelled with the carnival
shows  
He ran bumper cars sucked cheap cigars and he candied up his nose  
He got wind of the big brown beaver So he thought hed take himself a peekbut
the beaver was quick and he grabbed him by the kiwis  
and he aint pissed for a weekAnd a half  
  
Wynona took her big brown beaver and she stuck him up in the air said I sure
do love this big brown beaver and I wish I did have a pair  
Now the beaver once slept for seven days And it gave us all an awful fright  
So I tickled his chin and I gave him a pinch and the bastard tried to bite me
Wynona loved her big brown beaverAnd she stroked him all the time  
She pricked her finger one day and it occurred to her she might have a
porcupine
