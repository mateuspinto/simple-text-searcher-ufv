I couldnt make a change  
I might have known you had found another love  
I sat at home all night  
Bask in the lonely pale of my bed stand light  
Through a tear in a curtain in a cheap motel  
I saw with jealous eyes  
You made the call to lie  
Deceptively yours  
I saw a black cloud I didnt hear a sound only the shell on the ground  
Was a scream somewhere and in the thick night air  
I put the pedal down as the sirens wailed and I sat alone and prayed  
Not knowing what was to come  
Through the tear in a curtain in a cheap motel  
I saw with jealous eyes  
You made the call to lie  
Deceptively yours  
I tried not to believe the scene that I could see  
It felt like days passes by  
Before I turned away I felt a dizzy sway  
And the gun in my hand stood before a judge  
He cleared his throat to say  
I wont give you no bail  
Shackled with chains of love  
I knew that I had bought my own coffin nails  
I hear your sweet voice calling out my name  
As I stare from a six foot cell  
And from beyond I heard the words  
Deceptively yours
