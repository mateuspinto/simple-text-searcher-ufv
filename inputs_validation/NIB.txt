Oh yeah  
  
Some people say my love cannot be true  
please believe me my love and Ill show you  
I will give you those things you thought unreal  
The sun the moon the stars all bear my seal  
  
Oh yeah  
  
Follow me now and you will not regret  
Leaving the life you led before we met  
You are the first to have this love of mine  
Forever with me till the end of time  
  
Your love for me has just got to be real  
Before you know the way Im going to feel

Our love grows stronger now with every hour  
Look into my eyes you will see who I am  
My name is Lucifer please take my hand

Before you know the way Im going to feel
