Old man look at my life  
Im a lot like you were  
  
Old man look at my life  
Twenty four and theres so much more  
Live alone in a paradise  
That makes me think of two  
  
Love lost such a cost  
Give me things that dont get lost  
Like a coin that wont get tossed  
Rolling home to you  
  
Old man take a look at my life Im a lot like you  
I need someone to love me the whole day through  
Ah one look in my eyes and you can tell thats true  
  
Lullabies look in your eyes  
Run around the same old town  
It doesnt mean that much to me  
To mean that much to you  
  
Ive been first and last  
Look at how the time goes past  
But Im all alone at last  
Rolling home to you  
Hey  
  
Old man take a look at my life Im a lot like you  
I need someone to love me the whole day through  
Ah one look in my eyes and you can tell thats true
