I hope the days come easy and the moments pass slow  
And each road leads you where you wanna go  
And if youre faced with a choice and you have to choose  
I hope you choose the one that means the most to you  
And if one door opens to another door closed  
I hope you keep on walkin till you find the window  
If its cold outside show the world the warmth of your smile  
But more than anything more than anything  
  
My wish for you is that this life becomes all that you want it to  
Your dreams stay big your worries stay small  
You never need to carry more than you can hold  
And while youre out there getting where youre getting to  
I hope you know somebody loves you and wants the same things too  
Yeah this is my wish  
  
I hope you never look back but you never forget  
All the ones who love you in the place you live  
I hope you always forgive and you never regret  
And you help somebody every chance you get  
Oh you find Gods grace in every mistake  
And always give more than you take  
But more than anything yeah more than anything  
  
My wish for you is that this life becomes all that you want it to  
Your dreams stay big your worries stay small  
You never need to carry more than you can hold  
And while youre out there getting where youre getting to  
I hope you know somebody loves you and wants the same things too  
Yeah this is my wish Yeah yeah  
  
My wish for you is that this life becomes all that you want it to
