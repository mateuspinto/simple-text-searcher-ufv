I was walking on the avenue  
Strolling  
The heart opened to the unknown  
I wanted to say hello to anyone  
Anyone and that was you I told you anything  
Just hadda talk to you to tame you  
Win over  
  
On the Champs Elysees on the Champs Elysees  
Under the sun under the rain at midday or midnight  
Theres whatever you want on the Champs Elysees  
  
You said I have rendezvous in a basement  
Underground  
With mad guys who live with guitar in the hand  
Crazy  
From evening til morning  
  
So Ive accompanied you  
Came with you  
We sang we danced  
And we even not thought about kissin  
Embracin  
  
On the Champs Elysees on the Champs Elysees  
Under the sun under the rain at midday or midnight  
Theres whatever you want on the Champs Elysees
