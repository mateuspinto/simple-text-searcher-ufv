Intro  
  
Verse 1  
More than a baby in a manger  
To whom nobles would humbly bow their knee  
Or the young Man who heaven knew as Savior  
He is alive in me  
  
Verse 2  
More than the Man who walked on water  
Or the One who caused blinded eyes to see  
Greater than all the signs and wonders  
He is alive in me  
  
Chorus 1  
He lives He lives  
He conquered the grave  
Covered our sin  
He lives He lives  
Death could not hold  
The promise within  
He lives  
  
Verse 3  
More than the Man who heard hosanna  
From the same cried crucify the King  
Freely He gave as they demanded  
Still Hes alive in me  
  
Verse 4  
More than the man mankind rejected  
With nails in His hands and through His feet  
But the end told much more then they expected  
For everyone knows in three days he rose  
With power forever to redeem you and me  
  
Chorus 2  
He lives He lives  
He conquered the grave  
Covered our sin  
He lives He lives  
Death could not hold  
The promise within  
  
Woh He lives He lives  
He conquered the grave  
Covered our sin  
He lives He lives  
Death could not hold  
The promise within
