Now kids hang on just a second before we start  
You know theres a reason we are all here in front of Grandma and  
Grandpas  
Christmas tree  
And if Trevor and E P Would quit fighting long enough and be real  
Quiet  
This little song might help ya understand  
  
Long ago in a stable there was a baby being born  
His parents were Joseph and Mary  
And Josephs big ole heart was torn  
Cause he couldnt find a decent place for Mary to have her child  
But Mary said it just seemed just right and she blessed it with her  
Smile  
  
Chorus  
Cause what made it special was the baby in her arms  
God sent Him down to give the world a second chance for you and I  
Thats why we have Christmas at this time each year  
Its the babys birthday party that brings us so much cheer  
  
Now kids the presents that all of you exchange on Christmas  
Represents the gifts that baby Jesus received the night he was born  
He got all his presents from three wise men  
Who followed a star  
And walked a long long way to the stable  
So everytime you tear open one of your presents  
Think about that baby and say  
Happy birthday Jesus  
Ill open this one for you  
  
Chorus  
  
Ok all together now  
Happy Birthday Jesus  
Ill open this one just for you
