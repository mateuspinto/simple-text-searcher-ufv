We are worlds we are bodies  
Empires of dirt and grace  
Silhouettes and reflections  
Caught in his holy flame  
  
PreChorus  
Beneath our skin  
A new creation  
The night is done  
Our chains are broken  
Our time has come  
The wait is over  
The King is here  
And his name is Jesus  
  
Chorus  
This is love and its Gods to heal the broken  
This is love bleeding life into the grave  
Hear the sound as our hearts cry out forever  
Singing hallelujah  
Breathing in a brand new world oh  
  
We are shadows and portraits  
Empires of life and clay  
Images of our maker  
Sinners called out as saints  
  
PreChorus

Bridge  
No eye has seen  
No ear has heard  
No mind conceived  
What heaven holds  
But here and now  
Let earth be found  
With all our crowns upon your name  
  
Long instrumental break  
  
Bridge
