This love of ours  
Is gradually fading  
Something is wrong  
Or somebodys faking  
Autumn changes  
Shifting phases  
Autumn changes  
Turning stages  
Surely something  
Can help to patch it up  
Too many nights  
Sitting here waiting  
Too many days  
Hoping and praying  
Autumn changes  
Shifting phases  
Autumn changes  
Turning stages  
Surely something  
Can help to patch it up  
Oh yes we can  
Oh sure we can  
Oh sure we can  
Oh sure we can  
Oh sure we can  
Oh yes we can  
Oh sure we can  
Oh yes we can  
Something inside  
It seems to be dying  
Most of the time  
I just feel like crying  
Autumn changes  
Shifting phases  
Autumn changes  
Turning stages  
Surely something  
Can help to patch it up  
Surely this love  
Must we be worth saving  
Dont let it die  
Think what youre doing  
Autumn changes  
Shifting phases  
Autumn changes  
Turning stages  
Surely something  
Can help to patch it up  
Autumn changes  
Shifting phases  
Autumn changes  
Turning stages  
Oh yes we can  
Oh no we can  
Oh yes we can  
Oh no we can  
Oh yes  
Baby we can  
Oh yes we can  
Oh no we can
