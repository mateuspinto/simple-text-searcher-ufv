Hey yo  
Let me be front  
This is real and not a stunt  
Im comin to the forefront  
Shovel for the rapper and clear the lane  
Cause this jam is like a Tomahawk chop  
Teach ya Ill never stop droppin topics  
Vocal power  
Yes I got it  
  
On central but their trying to clamp it down  
Flag was waving the wrong way so I shot it Down  
Get down and at the same time  
Come up Down  
This is a crime that shut us up  
I dont give a fuck  
Cause the words and the thoughts still hit  
And like I said  
Its not a skit  
Jump another hit  
Yeah  
Ya know I dont need a drum kit  
Make em say aw shit  
The rebellion is true and legit  
  
Down Get down And clear the lane  
Down Get down And clear the lane  
Down Get down And clear the land  
Down Get down Yeah  
  
The rebel  
Youll never disable  
Defiance  
With the cards upon the table  
Pulling cards  
Keep the governements in check  
Yo  
I think we need a new deck  
Never could trust a phillabusta  
The mic is like a fist and itll bust ya  
With words cold hittin with the underground  
And now youre checkin out the new sound  
Live hit  
A live pop  
Live rock  
And ya dont stop  
It goes on and on and on  
Whos a threat  
Cmon the war is on  
  
Down Get down And clear the lane Repeat x 4  
  
Start droppin  
Our words are never safe  
Fighting myself  
Til Im where I gotta be  
I challenge dont sweat it  
Now dont you forget it  
Check me What Wait  
You better slow down  
Realize I cant confine my rhyme to a beat  
I need cash so when Im cool Im never ever weak  
Places are fluid and diluted and complete  
Check me once calm down and take a seat  
Strip the chains the freedoms there but then its gone  
  
Ugh Clear the lane Repeat x 4  
  
Defiance  
Rippin up the south set  
Every time Im grippin the mic it is a sound threat  
Resist against the suckers that bring the bass in  
Timmy see  
Bring that bass in  
  
Ugh Clear the lane Repeat x 4
