Graham Russell  
Heres on the street  
A tear in the seam  
Of pleasure and pain  
Life carries on  
A cloak of deceit  
Brings honour to shame  
But the voice I used to know  
Where are you now  
Is the one I cant let go  
Chorus  
You are the reason  
My faith in tomorrow  
A Distant horizon  
The one I must follow  
You are the first You are the last  
Ihelp you to see  
The light in the dark  
The sun through the rain  
Until you are free  
And facing the truth  
That words cant explain  
But the truth I think you knowTell me  
I could never let you go  
Chorus  
you are the future from the past  
You are the spell that has been cast  
You are the reason  
My faith in tomorrow  
A distant horizon  
The one I must follow  
Chorus  
You are the first  
You are the last to me  
Oom hmYou are to meYou are
