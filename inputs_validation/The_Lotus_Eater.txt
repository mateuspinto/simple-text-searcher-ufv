Liquid is in your throat  
For hopeless delight  
After all you fell in love with death  
Life has aborted  
All youve had and all you became  
  
The night is calling you pray forth  
  
A barren waste is your land  
Crops they were sown to die  
  
This skin is a mirror  
The eyes hover with ignorance  
Hell throb from your lips  
Sucked in and safe from the world of sleep  
  
All years caring for a liar  
The barren drift road is winding higher  
Youre a moth too close to the fire  
  
You are stuck in a beautiful future  
Changing and waiting and seeking the truth of it all  
  
Fleeting in sorrow  
Pushing your spirit away  
Seeking the weakness of dislike  
Whispered from the heart  
To be were all in the mourning  
To despair  
  
  
  
Cries out The restless will also die  
  
Resurrection covered with death  
Drawing the life under one  
A fact tied to the earth  
The souls a victim a follower  
  
Oh mother  
Incoherent growling  
For us to see  
The blink of an eye  
  
And the pride of a mother  
Drawn close in a mothers son  
And the love from a father  
Was used by a fathers son  
  
Over warriors token  
Misspoken lives on  
The language unimportant  
So fair and so just  
  
All the land is taken
