Long drive long night  
The best night of my life  
With you ridin  
Your hand on my hand  
  
The thought of arriving  
Kinda feels like dying  
I dont want to go home  
And be alone  
  
Could we stay out  
Could you drive a little slower  
Dont matter where were going  
As long as Im with you  
We can take the long way  
  
Chevy Nova  
Front seat sofa  
Getting closer  
To you  
  
Drive a little slower  
Dont matter where were going  
As long as Im with you  
We can take the long way  
  
Drive a little slower  
Not ready to go home  
I rather stay with you  
We can take the long way out  
  
To the country out of town  
Lets get lost I dont want to be found  
Lets get away now  
  
And be careful not to crash  
Its known theres frost and were steaming the glass  
You hit the road have a generous shoulder  
We could pull over  
And say we took the long way  
  
Headlights  
Strobe lights  
I can see you  
But not quite  
I can feel you  
Inside  
The timing  
Is just right  
For the moment  
I dont want  
To go home  
  
Take the long way out  
Oh oh oh  
Take the long way now  
Oh oh oh  
  
Drive a little slower  
Dont matter where were going now  
Drive a little slower  
Dont matter where were going now  
Drive a little slower  
Not ready to go home  
Id rather stay with you  
We can take the long way  
  
Long drive long night  
The best night of my life
