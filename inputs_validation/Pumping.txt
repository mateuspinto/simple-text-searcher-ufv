Oh I see you stare spipipipipipi spiraling up there and ho  
Oh into the center of my brain and baby come baby go  
And free the hurricane oh I go into the center of the airplane  
Baby gotta move to the center of my pain  
And my heart starts pumping my fists start pumping  
Upset total abandon you know I love you so  
Total abandon ooh walla walla walla  
  
Oh I see you stare spipipipipipi spiraling up there and ho  
Oh into the center of my brain and baby come baby go  
And free the hurricane oh I go into the center of the airplane  
Baby gotta box in the center of the ring  
And my heart starts pumping my fists start pumping  
Upset total abandon you know I love you so  
Total abandon ooh wah  
  
Oh I go into the center of the airplane  
Baby gotta go to the center of my brain  
And my heart starts pumping my fists start pumping  
Got no recollection of my past reflection  
So Im free to move in the resurrection  
My heart starts pumping my fists start pumping  
My heart pumping my heart pumping my heart pumping  
  
Coming in the airport coming in the sea  
Coming in the garden got a conscious stream  
Coming in a washroom coming on a plane  
Coming in a force field coming in my brain  
And my heart my heart  
Total abandon total abandon total abandon  
Total abandon total abandon total abandon  
Total abandon  
  
Oh I go into the center of the airplane  
Baby gotta move to the center of my brain  
My heart oh
