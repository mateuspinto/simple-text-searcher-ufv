One night not long ago  
I fell for you  
Too easy to let go  
She was one from your past  
One of the few  
You said it didnt last  
  
Now Romeo you know I cant believe  
Your tongue would slip so easily  
I know you think I oughta let it be  
But get it right next time  
Thats the end of me  
  
Chorus  
My name is not Susan  
So watch what you say  
If you still need her  
Then be on your way  
Dont want to hear about Susan  
Shes got nothin on me  
So show some respect for the love you receive  
My name is not Susan  
No no no no no get it right  
  
Last night you were asleep  
Deep in a dream  
I heard you call her name  
Then you turned to embrace  
I froze in place  
Never to be the same  
  
Now Romeo you know I never knew  
My heart would bust so easily  
I know you think I oughta let it go  
But get it right next time  
Say goodbye to me boy  
  
Chorus  
  
I never want to be the girly that you call one and only  
You know the kind of girly that you would call when you get lonely  
I never should have let you in  
A damn shame forgot my name  
Well anyway  
  
Chorus  
  
Dont want to hear about Susan  
My name aint Susan  
My name aint Susan  
My name aint Susan  
Ya better get it right
