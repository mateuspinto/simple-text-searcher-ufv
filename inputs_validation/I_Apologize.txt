Intro

Wyclef Jerry Wonda Lil Wonda  
Mr Lionel Richie wanna talk to the girls right now  
  
Im faithful yes I done that  
She forgave me  
Then she came back  
I was grateful  
When she did that  
When she couldnt take the pain no more  
She didnt come back  
  
From the billboards  
To the world tours  
Sometimes I reminisce about the Commodores  
Oh that brick house  
Would make a grown man lose his mind  
A young boy reach his prime  
  
Pre Hook  
Call it grown folks talk if you want to  
But young blood  
You dont wanna lose her  
Man up pick up the phone  
And call her tell her that you love her  
Cause the worst thing for a man  
Is to find his woman with another man  
Outside holding hands  
You need to man up tell your girl  
  
Hook  
I I I apologize  
I I never meant to make you cry  
Is to find his woman with another man  
Outside holding hands  
You need to man up tell your girl  
  
Hook  
I I I apologize  
I I never meant to make you cry  
I I I apologize  
I I baby girl just dry your eyes

Pre Hook  
  
Oh yeah  
Call it grown folks talk if you want to  
But young blood  
You dont wanna lose her  
Man up pick up the phone  
And call her tell her that you love her  
Cause the worst thing for a man  
Is to find his woman with another man  
Outside holding hands  
You need to man up tell your girl  
  
Hook
