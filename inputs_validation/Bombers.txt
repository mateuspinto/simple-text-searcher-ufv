Look up I hear the scream of sirens on the wall  
I see a policeman crying in the backseat of a dying Ford  
Hotel waiters leave the bedrooms of stars  
Who are far too old  
And noone ever told me  
That I could be so cold  
  
Bombers fight at zero feet  
Bombers fight at zero  
  
I see an old man knocked to the ground  
And beaten by the vicars wife  
Noone stops to help theyre far too busy  
Trying to save their own lives  
A tiny girl screams for mother  
And wanders out into the street  
I saw her going down underneath  
A thousand peoples running feet  
  
Bombers fight at zero feet  
Bombers fight at zero  
  
All the junkies pulling needles from their arms  
Hope it lasts all night  
And all the soldiers curse the day they joined the army  
And prepare to fight  
In silent bars in silent rooms in silent cars  
You hide where you can  
And me I know just where you are you see  
Im a bomber man  
  
Bombers fight at zero feet  
Bombers fight at zero
