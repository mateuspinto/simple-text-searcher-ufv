I wish a buck was still silver  
It was back when the country was strong  
Back before Elvis before the Vietnam war came along  
  
Before the Beatles and Yesterday  
When a man could still work and still would  
Is the best of the free life behind us now  
Are the good times really over for good  
  
Are we rolling downhill like a snowball headed for Hell  
With no kind of chance for the flag or the Liberty Bell  
Wish a Ford and a Chevy could still last ten years like they should  
Is the best of the free life behind us now  
Are the good times really over for good  
  
I wish Coke was still Cola  
And a joint was a bad place to be  
And it was back before Nixon lied to us all on tv  
  
Before microwave ovens  
When a girl still cooked Incomprehensible wood  
Is the best of the free life behind us now  
Are the good times really over for good  
  
Are we rolling downhill like a snowball headed for Hell  
With no kind of chance for the flag or the Liberty Bell  
Wish a Ford and a Chevy could still last ten years like they should  
Is the best of the free life behind us now  
Are the good times really over for good  
  
Stop rolling downhill like a snowball headed for Hell  
Stand up for the flag and lets all ring the Liberty Bell  
Lets make a Ford and a Chevy still last ten years like they should  
Cause the best of the free life is still yet to come  
The good times aint over for good
