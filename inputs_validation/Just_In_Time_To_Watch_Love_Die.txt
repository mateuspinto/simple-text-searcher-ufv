Theres a stack of daily papers on her doorstep  
And the grass has grown up more than shed allow  
Yes it looks to me to be a little more than a vacation  
Never knew that Id miss her until now  
From both ends the candle seemed to burn much brighter  
I guess she saw the flame I tried so hard to die  
Looks like Im the one that got caught in the middle burnt my finger  
I got there just in time to watch love die  
Yes I got there just in time to watch love die mhm mhm  
  
Theres a change of address blank inside her mailbox  
And the key she usually left for me is not here  
Yes its plain to see that she no longer needs an explanation  
Guess I should have known I would not find her here  
From both ends the candle seemed  
But I got there much too late to say goodbye
