Christmas bells in the steeple  
Ringing out on Christmas morn  
But where are all the people  
Where has everybody gone  
  
Theyre all busy with their presents  
Snug and warm behind their doors  
Thinkin no one was forgotten  
Empty shelves in all the stores  
  
Doesnt anyone remember  
As they wake up Christmas morn  
The 25th day of December  
Little Baby Jesus was born  
  
Christmas bells in the steeple  
How their ringing seems to say  
O come all ye faithful get down on your knees and pray  
Dont you know its Christmas Day
