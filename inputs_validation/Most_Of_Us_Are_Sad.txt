Most of us are sad  
No one lets it show  
Ive been shadows of myself  
How was i to know  
  
Tell me scarlet sun  
What will time allow  
We have brought our children  
Here who can save them now  
  
Oh weeping woman try to smile  
Like the coming dawn  
Most of us are sad its true  
Still we must go on  
  
Love was here today  
Oh the sun was bright  
I will sing you faraway  
Love is here tonight  
  
Most of us are sad  
No one lets it show  
Ive been shadows of myself  
How was i to know
