Titillations been replaced by interstate brick face and coffee mate  
And by a list of phone calls youll like to make  
Where you could sit on the edge of your bed  
And you could stare into your own shoes  
And in the pools of light there go wherever you choose  
Just rig up a complication and if it derails  
You can throw away the rudder and float away like vapour trails  
theres nothin funnier than pride in an utterly confident stride  
So I pulled the car on over to give you a ride  
Damn this sleepy weather he said as he marched in soppin wet shoes  
Through rain pools evaporatin says in this sign Ill conquer you  
I pulled the car on over to give you a ride  
But theres nothin uglier than a man hittin his stride  
Past Mexicans all dressed in beige shirts leanin over their hoes  
Now the mornins over its time to let them sprinklers hose  
Past hills of chambermaids dark bare arms  
And fields of muscles quilted to the bone  
Right now Im flyin over ya right now Im flyin home  
Where I can sit on the end of my bed  
And I can stare into my own shoes  
And in the pools of light years go wherever I choose  
And throw away the rudder float away on vapour trails  
I rigged up a complication totally derailed  
So I throw away the rudder float away like vapour trails  
I pulled the car on over  
Its time to let them sprinklers hose  
Woo woo woo throw away the rudder
