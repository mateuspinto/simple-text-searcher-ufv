Better take a look  
At my circle  
Better take a look around  
Tell all my friends  
Better take a look  
At the colors of the people  
  
Chorus  
Young without lovers  
Old without friends  
  
Better say a prayer  
For the poor and unhealthy  
Better sing a song  
For those who dont care  
Let the people have the right  
To be different  
  
Chorus  
  
Life is an abstraction  
And it tries to fool us all  
And its working so far it seems  
Brother against brother  
This world is such a mess  
Behind the drawn curtains  
So our thoughts can not be seen  
  
Better shake the hand  
Of the hated  
Better hear the words  
That dont seem clear  
Better take a look around  
At what were doing  
  
Chorus  
  
Better take a look  
At my circle  
Better take a look around  
Tell all of my friends  
Let the people have the right  
To be different
