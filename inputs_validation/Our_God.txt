Verse  
Water You turned into wine  
Opened the eyes of the blind  
Theres no one like You  
None like You  
Into the darkness You shine  
Out of the ashes we rise  
Theres no one like You  
None like You  
  
Chorus  
Our God is greater  
Our God is stronger  
God You are higher than any other  
Our God is healer  
Awesome in power  
Our God our God  
  
Verse  
Into the darkness You shine  
Out of the ashes we rise
