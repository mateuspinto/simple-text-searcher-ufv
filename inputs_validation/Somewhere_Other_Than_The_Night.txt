He could see the storm clouds rollin across the hill  
He barely beat the rain in from the field  
And between the backdoor slammin she heard him say  
Damn this rain and damn this wasted day  
But shed been waitin for this day for oh so long  
She was standin in the kitchen with nothin but her apron on  
And in disbelief he stood and he stared a while  
When their eyes met they both began to smile  
  
Somewhere other than the night  
She needs to hear I love you  
Somewhere other than the night  
She needs to know you care  
She wants to know shes needed  
She needs to be held tight  
Somewhere other than the night  
  
They spent the day wrapped up in a blanket  
On the front porch swing  
Hed come to realize hed neglected certain things  
And there are times she feels alone even by his side  
It was the first time she ever saw him cry  
  
Somewhere other than the night  
She needs to hear I love you  
Somewhere other than the night  
She needs to know you care  
She wants to know shes needed  
She needs to be held tight  
Somewhere other than the night  
  
To know shes needed  
She needs to be held tight  
Somewhere other than the night
