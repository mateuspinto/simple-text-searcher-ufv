Beneath the Skin a caustic red river  
Beneath the Skin corrosive abuser  
Beneath the Skin genetic in rupture  
Beneath the Skin all cold and hungered  
Beneath the Skin a still born forgiveness  
Beneath the Skin cell transfer in whispers  
Beneath the Skin a lover cries murder  
Beneath the Skin all cold and hungered  
Beneath the Skin I wasted this moment  
Beneath the Skin old undiscovered  
Beneath the Skin another lies ruptured  
Beneath the Skin all cold and hungered
