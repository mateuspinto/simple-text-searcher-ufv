In the nicotine glare of a cold naked light  
I drag my body from the covers and down forty flights  
I run out the front door into the center of the street  
I scream out your name as the steam just swells around my feet  
  
I hear you after midnight from the inner city  
As every little Cinderella turns to drop dead pretty  
We were built out of the darkness into this West Side Story  
We came together in the shadows but the moon just steals our glory  
  
Well this is my battleground baby  
This is my plaything  
The only thing Ive ever known  
Outside of a wedding ring  
  
And I swear I heard the night talking  
Cursing me for being a little more than hopeless  
Telling me were running lonely loose and broken  
Stronger now on passion but havent we really spoken  
And all we ever do is listen to the night talking  
  
On the burden of insanity we cant find the cause  
On a flatbed truck well the home girl she paints her claws  
Theres a coward who gets his courage under cover of the dark  
And its a strange breed of the devil freeze at night to go walking in the
park  
  
This is my battleground baby  
This is my plaything  
The only thing Ive ever known  
Outside of a wedding ring  
  
And I swear I heard the night talking  
Cursing me for being a little more than hopeless  
Telling me were running lonely loose and broken  
Stronger now on passion but havent we really spoken  
And all we ever do is listen to the night talking  
  
This is my battleground baby  
This is my plaything  
The only thing Ive ever known  
Outside of a wedding ring  
  
And I swear I heard the night talking  
Cursing me for being a little more than hopeless  
Telling me were running lonely loose and broken  
Stronger now on passion but havent we really spoken  
And all we ever do oh yeah is listen to the night talking  
  
Oh yeah oh yeah  
And I swear I heard the night talking  
Oh yeah oh yeah  
I swear I swear I swear I heard the night talking
