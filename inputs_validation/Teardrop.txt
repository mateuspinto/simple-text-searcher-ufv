Cover of Massive Attack song  
  
Love love is a verb  
Love is a doing word  
Fearless on my breath  
Gentle impulsion  
Shakes me makes me lighter  
Fearless on my breath  
  
Teardrop on the fire  
Fearless on my breath  
  
Nine night of matter  
Black flowers blossom  
Fearless on my breath  
Black flowers blossom  
Fearless on my breath  
  
Teardrop on the fire  
Fearless on my breath  
  
Water is my eye  
Most faithful mirror  
Fearless on my breath  
Teardrop on the fire of a confession  
Fearless on my breath  
Most faithful mirror  
Fearless on my breath  
  
Teardrop on the fire  
Fearless on my breath  
  
Stumbling a little  
Stumbling a little
