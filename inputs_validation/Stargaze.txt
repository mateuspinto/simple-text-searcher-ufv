Stargaze I feel it with everything you do  
And I like this and I do this all along  
This connection founded from day one  
Obviously peaceful staring to the stars  
She came my way yeah when everything was tangled now  
Im seeing clearer with every move yeah  
See the sun is shining ah youve every reason now  
I got something now and I got you you you you  
Oh yes we falling we falling from the sky  
And I caught you and I did this and I know why  
As she came my way yeah when everything was tangled now  
And Im seeing clearer with every move yeah  
See the sun is shining ah youve every reason now  
And I got something now hey I got you you you you you yeah
