You were dreamin  
On a park bench  
Bout a broad highway somewhere  
When the music from the carillon  
Seemed to hurl your heart out there  
Past the scientific darkness  
Past the fireflies that float  
To an angel bending down  
To wrap you in his warmest coat  
  
And you ask  
What am I not doing  
He says  
Your voice cannot command  
In time you will move mountains  
And it will come through your hands  
  
Still you argue for an option  
Still you angle for your case  
Like you wouldnt know a burning bush  
If it blew up in your face  
Yeah we scheme about the future  
And we dream about the past  
When just a simple reaching out  
Might build a bridge that lasts  
  
And you ask  
What am I not doing  
He says  
Your voice cannot command  
In time you will move mountains  
And it will come through your hands  
Through your hands  
  
So whatever your hands find to do  
You must do with all your heart  
There are thoughts enough  
To blow mens minds  
And tear great worlds apart  
Theres a healing touch to find you  
On that broad highway somewhere  
To lift you high  
As music flyin  
Through the angels hair  
  
Dont ask what you are not doing  
Because your voice cannot command  
In time we will move mountains  
And it will come through your hands
