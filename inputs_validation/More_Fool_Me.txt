Here am I  
Who while away the mornings  
Since youve gone  
Too long have I lay alone  
Not knowing which way to turn  
  
And there you are  
Quite sure that you were right  
Knowing full well  
That Id be the first one  
To go down  
  
And youd be the one who was laughing  
Except when things werent going your way  
And then the lady would say that shed had enough  
Wandering around on her own  
  
The day you left  
Well I think you knew youd not be back  
Well at least it would seem that way  
Because you never said goodbye  
But when it comes round to you and me  
Im sure it will work out alright  
  
And youd be the one who was laughing  
And giving me something I dont need  
And you know Id always hold you and keep you warm  
Oh more fool me  
  
Ah but when it comes  
Round to you and me  
I ask myself  
Do I really believe  
In your love  
  
Yes Im sure it will work out alright
