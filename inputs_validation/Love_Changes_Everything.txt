Love  
Love changes everything  
Hands and faces  
Earth and sky  
Love  
Love changes everything  
How you live and  
How you die  
  
Love  
Can make the summer fly  
Or a night  
Seem like a lifetime  
  
Yes Love  
Love changes everything  
Now I tremble  
At your name  
Nothing in the world will ever  
Be the same  
  
Love  
Love changes everything  
Days are longer  
Words mean more  
Love  
Love changes everything  
Pain is deeper  
Than before  
  
Love  
Will turn your world around  
And that world  
Will last for ever  
  
Yes Love  
Love changes everything  
Brings you glory  
Brings you shame  
Nothing in the  
World will ever  
Be the same  
  
Off  
Into the world we go  
Planning futures  
Shaping years  
Love  
Bursts in and suddenly  
All our wisdom  
Disappears  
  
Love  
Makes fools of everyone  
All the rules  
We make are broken  
Yes Love  
Love changes everyone  
Live or perish  
In its flame  
Love will never  
Never let you  
Be the same  
  
Love will never  
Never let you  
Be the same
