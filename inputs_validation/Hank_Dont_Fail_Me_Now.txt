I had a heck of a time gettin into my house today  
There was a big ass youHaul trailer in my way  
And she was headed for the car so I grabbed my old guitar  
I got one more chance before she drives away  
So  
  
Chorus  
Hank dont fail me now  
Youve always bailed me out  
Your Cheatin Heart  
Could set that suitcase down  
Give me one more song to whine  
Thatll make her change her mind  
Cause shes walkin out  
Hank dont fail me now  
  
Yeah she was throwin stuff cussin like a sailor at me  
She was waving her arms around like she was fightin bees  
If I could yodel her a lick  
That just might do the trick  
If I sang I Saw The Light would she believe  
I dont think so  
So  
  
Chorus x2  
  
Shes walkin out  
Hank dont fail me now  
Shes walkin out  
Hank dont fail me now
