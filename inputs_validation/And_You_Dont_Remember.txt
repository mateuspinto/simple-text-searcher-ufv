Shattered dreams  
Cut through my mind  
Tragically our love has died  
Memories confine my head  
Bitterly I face the end  
  
Trustingly  
I gave myself to you  
I let you inside  
Believing your lies  
  
Chorus  
And you dont remember  
Every time you told me  
You were mine for ever  
For eternity  
And you dont remember  
How you used to hold me  
How wed melt together  
How you needed me  
How we used to be  
In love  
  
Stranded here  
In nothingness  
With only tears  
And loneliness  
  
Foolishly  
I gave my soul to you  
I let you inside  
Believing your lies  
  
Chorus  
  
Helplessly  
I fell so deep  
I was so naive  
To let you in  
Why did I let you in  
To my heart  
  
And you dont remember  
Anything that you told me  
You were mine forever  
For eternity  
I know you dont remember  
How you used to hold me  
How wed melt together  
Together  
How you needed me  
How we used to be  
In love
