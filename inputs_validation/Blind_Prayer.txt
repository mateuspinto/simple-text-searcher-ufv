I was born and raised the only son of a lawyer  
Til I was approximately the age of four or perhaps five  
I lost both my mother and my father  
Killed in a fire way up on the fourteenth floor  
Struck down by the time I was ten by an illness  
Which robbed me of the sight of the morning sun  
And that aint all  
  
A homeless child for the next five years  
With my dog clown by my side and my only friend  
Yeah yeah yeah  
I fought my way through school  
Sound and touch the thing on which I could depend  
And you know what the the the kids  
Down my street werent too playful  
And right then it seemed like the whole world picked on me  
And ah yeah  
  
I worked my fingers to the bone  
Stretchin hide for a boot man in Jersey Town  
But then but then I lost the last thing I had  
When fate reared its ugly head and took my dog clown  
I wandered way up north found a girl that loved like a woman  
Sixteen years old and felt like a woman  
But but but but but what Im trying to say is  
God please dont take her away from me  
  
I lost everything that I ever had  
You kicked my name into the dirt  
Tread my name into the dirt yeah  
  
I lost everything that I ever had  
You kicked my name into the dirt  
What could I do  
  
I never knew how much love could hurt me  
But it never ever come my way before  
No no no no no  
I never knew how much love could hurt me  
Good God it aint never come my way before  
Oh but but you know what Im trying to say  
Really what Im trying to say is  
God please dont take her away from me  
  
Ah turn it down  
  
I lost everything that I ever had  
You kicked my name into the dirt  
  
You got a lotta lotta lost everything  
That I ever had ever had
