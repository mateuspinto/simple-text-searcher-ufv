Driving in to darlington county  
Me and wayne on the fourth of july  
Driving in to darlington county  
Looking for some work on the county line  
We drove down from new york city  
Where the girls are pretty but they just want to know your name  
Driving in to darlington city  
Got a union connection with an uncle of waynes  
We drove eight hundred miles without seeing a cop  
We got rock and roll music blasting off the ttop singing  
  
Sha la la la la la la la la sha la la la la la la  
  
Hey little girl standing on the corner  
Todays your lucky day for sure all right  
Me and my buddy were from new york city  
We got two hundred dollars we want to rock all night  
Girl youre looking at two big spenders  
Why the world dont know what me and wayne might do  
Our pas each own one of the world trade centers  
For a kiss and a smile Ill give mine all to you  
Come on baby take a seat on my fender  
Its a long night and tell me what else were you gonna do  
Just me and you we could  
  
Sha la la  
  
Little girl sitting in the window  
Aint seen my buddy in seven days  
County man tells me the same thing  
He dont work and he dont get paid  
Little girl youre so young and pretty  
Walk with me and you can have your way  
And well leave this darlington city  
For a ride down that dixie highway  
  
Driving out of darlington county  
My eyes seen the glory of the coming of the lord  
Driving out of darlington county  
Seen wayne handcuffed to the bumper of a state troopers ford  
  
Sha la la
