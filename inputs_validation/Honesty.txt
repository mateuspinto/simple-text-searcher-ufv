If you search for tenderness  
It isnt hard to find  
You can have the love you need to live  
But if you look for truthfulness  
You might just as well be blind  
It always seems to be so hard to give  
  
Honesty is such a lonely word  
Everyone is so untrue  
Honesty is hardly ever heard  
And mostly what I need from you  
  
I can always find someone  
To say they sympathize  
If I wear my heart out on my sleeve  
But I dont want some pretty face  
To tell me pretty lies  
All I want is someone to believe  
  
Honesty is such a lonely word  
Everyone is so untrue  
Honesty is hardly ever heard  
And mostly what I need from you  
  
I can find a lover  
I can find a friend  
I can have security until the bitter end  
Anyone can comfort me  
With promises again  
I know I know  
  
When Im deep inside of me  
Dont be too concerned  
I wont ask for nothin while Im gone  
But when I want sincerity  
Tell me where else can I turn  
Because youre the one that I depend upon  
  
Honesty is such a lonely word  
Everyone is so untrue  
Honesty is hardly ever heard  
And mostly what I need from you
