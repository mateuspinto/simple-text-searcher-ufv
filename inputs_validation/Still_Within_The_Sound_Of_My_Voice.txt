Where have you gone my darling one  
Are you on your own  
Are you having fun  
Is it someone to hold when you need it bad  
Is it uncontrolled like the love we had  
  
Does a day go by like a memory  
Do you ever try to remember me  
In an automobile or a crowded bar  
Well I hope youre alright where ever you are  
  
And if you are still within the sound of voice over some radio  
I just want you to know you were always my only choice  
And where ever you go then I still love you so  
if youre still within the sound of my voice  
  
In the dead of night do you hear me call  
Somethings quite not right no ones there at all  
Did you make a mistake Was it in your head  
Was it really me talking to your heart instead  
  
And if you are still within the sound of my voice  
watching this video I just want you to know  
That it always made me rejoice  
Just to have you so near  
Theres a place for you here  
If youre still within the sound of my voice  
  
I am calling like the echo of a passing train the cries  
one last time before it fades into the distant hills and dies  
I am sending out a message like a ship out on the sea in distress  
but only you can send a lifeline out to me  
  
Are you still within the sound of my voice  
Why dont you let me know I just cant let know if its wrong  
then I have no choice but to love you until I no longer have a will  
Are you still within the sound of my voice  
  
I am calling like the echo of a passing train that cries  
One last time before it fades into the distant hills and dies
