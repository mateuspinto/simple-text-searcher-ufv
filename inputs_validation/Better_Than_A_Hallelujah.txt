God loves a lullaby  
In a mothers tears in the dead of night  
Better than a Hallelujah sometimes  
God loves a drunkards cry  
The soldiers plea not to let him die  
Better than a Hallelujah sometimes  
  
We pour out our miseries  
God just hears a melody  
Beautiful the mess we are  
The honest cries of breaking hearts  
Are better than a Hallelujah  
  
The woman holding on for life  
The dying man giving up the fight  
Are better than a Hallelujah sometimes  
The tears of shame for whats been done  
The silence when the words wont come  
Are better than a Hallelujah sometimes  
  
We pour out our miseries  
God just hears a melody  
Beautiful the mess we are  
The honest cries of breaking hearts  
Are better than a Hallelujah  
  
Better than a church bell ringing  
Better than a choir singing out singing out  
  
We pour out our miseries  
God just hears a melody  
Beautiful the mess we are  
The honest cries of breaking hearts  
Are better than a Hallelujah  
  
We pour out our miseries  
God just hears a melody  
Beautiful the mess we are  
The honest cries of breaking hearts  
Are better than a Hallelujah  
  
Better than a Hallelujah sometimes  
Better than a Hallelujah  
Better than a Hallelujah sometimes
