So this is Christmas  
And what have you done  
Another year over  
And a new one just begun  
And so this is Christmas  
I hope you have fun  
The near and the dear ones  
The old and the young  
  
A very merry Christmas  
And a happy New Year  
Lets hope its a good one  
Without any fear  
  
And so this is Christmas war is over  
And what have you done war is over  
Another year over war is over  
And a new one just begun war is over  
And so this is Christmas war is over  
For weak and for strong war is over  
For rich and the poor ones war is over  
The war is so long now  
  
A very merry Christmas  
And a happy New Year  
Lets hope its a good one  
Without any fear  
  
War is over if you want it  
War is over now  
War is over if you want it  
War is over now
