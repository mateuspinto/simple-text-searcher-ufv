A Harvey  
  
Oh please dont send me out  
Said the man with the hammer hammering the anvil  
I been walking on a road of rocks  
And I keep on hammering keep on hammering keep on hammering  
Hammering the anvil  
  
  
Dont let the sun go down  
Said the man with the fire firing the furnace  
I been buried in the snow  
And I keep on firing keep on firing keep on firing  
Firing the furnace  
  
  
Oh dont talk to me  
Said the man with the chisel chiseling the surface  
I been sleeping far too long  
And I keep on chiseling keep on chiseling keep on chiseling  
Chiseling the surface  
  
  
I dont know what you mean  
Said the man with the shovel shoveling the ashes  
I been digging in the frozen ground  
And I keep on shoveling keep on shoveling keep on shoveling  
Shoveling the ashes  
  
  
Shoveling the ashes  
Chiseling the surface  
Firing the furnace  
Hammering the anvil
