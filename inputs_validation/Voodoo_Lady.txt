Voodoo Lady  
Shakin that stick and drivin me crazy  
Your eyes look red and hazy  
Doin that stuff that you do  
Messin me up with your voodoo  
  
You drive me crazy with that  
Boogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie  
You drive me crazy with that  
Boogie boogie boogie  
  
Your lips are hot and spicy  
Servin up red beans and rice  
At midnite shes ahowlin and stompin  
Makin love to the gators in the swampin  
  
Chorus  
  
I feel you now inside me  
Never once did you deny me  
Doin that stuff that you do  
Knockin me out with your voodoo  
  
Chorus  
  
Voodoo lady shakin that stick drivin me crazy  
Voodoo lady oh yeah  
  
Boogie boogie boogie boogie  
  
Repeat first verse  
  
Chorus
