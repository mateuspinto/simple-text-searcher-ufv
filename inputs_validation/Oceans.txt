Hold on to the thread  
The currents will shift  
Glide me towards  
You know somethings left  
And were all allowed  
To dream of the next  
Oh oh the next time we touch  
  
Uh huh uh huh  
Uh huh uh huh  
  
You dont have to stray  
Tho oceans away  
Waves roll in my thoughts  
Hold tight the ring  
The sea will rise  
Please stand by the shore  
Oh oh oh I will be  
I will be there once more  
  
Uh huh uh huh  
Uh huh uh huh  
Uh huh uh huh  
Uh huh uh huh  
Uh huh uh huh
