Another hungry look in her eyes again  
Pacing the floor  
The hunt begins  
Skintight leather provides my pleasure  
Wake my fear surge wit the pressure  
Walk away and leave forever do I dare  
  
Raise my eyes she stands  
Holding out healing handsare you happy now  
  
I walk the thin line for you  
Do just what you say to  
With fear as my friend  
I walk the thin line one more time for you  
  
Addictive face pretending dont speak the word  
Forbidden sin relenting I barely heard  
Screams of entry blur my vision  
Wake my fear of divine intervention  
Crawl away and bleed forever if you dare  
  
Hand on mouth the game goes on  
Love our stage to play upon  
Are you happy now  
  
I walk the thin line for you  
Do just what you say to  
With fear as my friend  
I walk the thin line one more time for you  
  
I walk the thin line for you  
Do just what you say to  
I walk the thin line for you  
Do just what you say to  
With fear as my friend  
I walk the thin line one more time for you
