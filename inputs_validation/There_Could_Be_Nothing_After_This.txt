In the end we tend to think of how it began  
I could never explain the picture it painted  
And how it made me feel  
Now the ceiling is in motion  
The light centered and overlooked  
You want to see me disappear Well so do I  
Such a quiet evaporation  
  
Were nothing but hollow vessels in search  
Of what makes us alive  
I never said this was my revolution when  
You looked me in the eye  
Oh how Ive walked this white line so  
Many times before  
What a feeble attempt just to feel alive  
  
This is for you and your hopeless case  
You never would leave me in your wish to  
Fail every time  
Every time I try  
  
So talk about it  
At least it makes you feel something inside  
  
Who have I become  
Oh God everything all around me is  
Crumbling at my feet  
  
I stare so delicate and ashamed  
At the shell Ive shed myself from  
  
In the eyes of my ghost  
And I will never look back again
