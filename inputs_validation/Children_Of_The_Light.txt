Verse  
Children in the wilderness  
Following the love You poured out for us  
Covered by the Name that we confess  
Jesus Saviour forever  
  
Roaming through the dark of night  
Clinging to the word that burns deep inside  
Eyes fixed on Your Name and endless light  
Jesus Saviour forever  
  
Chorus  
Set alight to follow  
In the shadow of Your Name  
The world is Yours and I know  
Everything will find its place  
Under Your Name  
  
Verse 2  
Walking on through the fire  
Knowing I will not be burned but refined  
Fearless in Your Name ever by my side  
Jesus Saviour forever  
  
Taking on the raging storm  
Anchored to the kingdom unshakable  
Holding to Your Name that outshines all  
Jesus Saviour forever  
  
Chorus  
Set alight to follow  
In the shadow of Your Name  
The world is Yours and I know  
Everything will find its place  
Under Your Name  
  
Bridge x2  
Children of the light  
Blazing through the night  
Taking back what the devil had stolen  
  
Calling on Your Name  
Breaking every chain  
Jesus everlasting freedom  
  
Running through the wild  
Dancing in the fire  
Taking back what the devil had stolen  
  
Calling on Your Name  
Breaking every chain  
Jesus everlasting freedom  
  
Chorus  
Set alight to follow  
In the shadow of Your Name  
The world is Yours and I know  
Everything will find its place  
  
Set alight to follow  
In the shadow of Your Name  
The world is Yours and I know  
Everything will find its place  
Under Your Name  
Jesus under Your Name  
  
Outro  
Jesus  
All the power  
All the glory  
All the praise be to Your Name forever  
All the power  
All the glory  
All the praise be to Your Name forever
