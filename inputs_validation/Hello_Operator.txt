Hello operator  
Can you give me number nine  
Can I see you later  
Will you give me back my dime  
Turn the oscillator  
Twist it with a dollar bill  
Mail man bring the paper  
Leave it on my window sill  
  
Find a canary  
A bird to bring my message home  
Carry my obituary  
My coffin doesnt have a phone  
How you gonna get the money  
Send papers to an empty home  
How you gonna get the money  
Nobody to answer the phone
