Old brown clock ticking on my shelf  
Take my mind to someplace else  
Little gold clock ticking by my bed  
Funny little people dancing round my head  
  
Morning brings me things to do  
Morning brings me thoughts of you  
Gentle sunshine through the curtain lace  
Some of which shining on your sweet face  
  
Counting hours making days  
Watching time throwing love away  
Nothing golden never stays  
Thats what I heard the poets say Mmm   
  
Time is always taking me  
Places I dont want to be  
But when the morning rise the moon  
I know a bird days coming soon  
  
Counting hours making days  
Watching time throwing love away  
Nothing golden never stays  
Thats what I heard the poets say Mmm   
  
Morning brings me things to do  
Morning brings me thoughts of you  
Gentle sunshine through the curtain lace  
Some of which shining on your sweet face
