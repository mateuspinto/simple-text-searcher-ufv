One after one they give into the urge  
Caught by some hand of desire  
Held by the feelings that brings them together  
Its all a mystery When will they learn  
Its just emotion on fire  
That soul taking primitive passion of nature  
  
Chorus  
I try to run I try to never fall apart  
But love takes pleasure from  
The burning of the heart  
Burning of the heart  
  
Telling myself I should run while theres time  
I see that look in her eyes  
Shes turning the heat of the moment up higher  
And watching for questions I have in my mind  
She knows somewhere in our lives  
Its only love that can find us an answer  
  
Chorus  
  
Telling myself I should run while theres time  
I see that look in her eyes  
Shes turning the heat of the moment up higher  
And watching for questions I have in my mind  
She knows somewhere in our lives  
Its only love that can find us an answer  
  
Chorus
