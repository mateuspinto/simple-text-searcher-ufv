Oh bury me not on the lone prairie  
These words came low and mournfully  
From the pallid lips of a youth who lay  
On the bloody ground at the close of day  
Oh bury me not and his voice failed there  
But we took no heed to his dying prayer  
In a narrow grave just six by three  
We buried him there on the lone prairie  
Oh bury me not on the lone prairie  
Where the coyotes howl and the wind blows free  
Where theres not a soul that will care for me  
Oh bury me not on the lone prairie
