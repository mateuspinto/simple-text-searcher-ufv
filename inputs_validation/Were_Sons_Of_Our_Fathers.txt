It seems that family values have changed since I was a kid at least I
remember it that way  
  
When I grow up to be a man  
Like my father was when I was young  
I hope I can make him so proud of me  
Proud enough to call me his son  
  
What makes these people so different now  
What makes these times so strange  
Seems most people got most everything they need  
How come we see this change  
  
Our sons and daughters seem to be beyond our control  
Their smile is fading fast theyre losing their soul  
When will we ever learn yet Im a believer  
  
When I was a boy did we have more respect  
This world seemed a nicer place to be  
But time slowly passes and one day you look around  
You hardly recognize what you see  
  
Our sons and daughters seem to be beyond our control  
Their smile is fading fast theyre losing their soul  
Now when will we ever learn yet Im a believer  
  
Theyre beyond our control  
  
Were all sons of our fathers  
Sometimes I feel like mine  
And I can hear him say the things I say  
Seems all things come around in time  
  
Why these things happen well never know  
Guess that was then and this is now  
We always knew that change was gonna come  
But I want to go back please tell me how  
  
Our sons and daughters seem to be beyond our control  
Their smile is fading fast theyre losing their soul  
When will we ever learn yet Im a believer
