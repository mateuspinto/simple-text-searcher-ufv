My life is filled with joy and tears  
Just like somebody ten thousand miles from here  
We stand a half a world apart  
Looking up at the same stars  
  
Were the fellowship of the  
Unashamed children in our Saviors eyes  
Praying for Gods touch  
To guide us through our different lives  
  
Cause everybody needs His perfect love  
Just like every flower needs the rain  
Reminding us the whole world over  
We are all the same  
  
And God is reaching out His hand to us  
As all across the earth we call His name  
Reminding us the whole world over  
Deep at heart we are all the same  
Oh Incomprehensible  
  
His love has opened up our eyes  
Closing the distance between our different lives  
And His grace fills every step we take  
As we walk on in faith  
  
No matter who or where we are  
He will be our common ground  
Take all the walls we build  
And bring them crashing down  
  
Cause everybody needs His perfect love  
Just like every flower needs the rain  
Reminding us the whole world over  
We are all the same  
  
And God is reaching out His hand to us  
As all across the earth we call His name  
Reminding us the whole world over  
Deep at heart we are all the same  
  
So let us thank him for His love weve come to know  
We know we will never face this world alone alone  
  
Cause everybody needs His perfect love  
Just like every flower needs the rain  
Reminding us the whole world over  
We are all the same  
  
And God is reaching out His hand to us  
As all across the earth we call His name  
Reminding us the whole world over  
Deep at heart we are all the same oh yes we are  
  
Reminding us the whole world over  
We are all the same
