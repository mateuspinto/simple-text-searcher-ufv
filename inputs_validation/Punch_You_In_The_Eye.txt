Hey hey hey hey  
Come from the North where the oceans freeze  
Spent three long months at the open seas  
Paddled til it seemed I could take no more  
Till I hit the ground on Prussias shores  
How was I to know that day  
That the winds had swept me Wilsons way  
But soon towards me from the East  
Came Wilson and his men on multibeast  
Hey  
Well it seemed he didnt like my face  
And I quickly learned that Prussia was an evil place  
They tied me to a chair with a giant clip  
And held a piece of paper to my tender nip  
Then they tossed the chair in a tiny shack  
And told me not to worry cause theyd soon be back  
But I loosened up the binds where my hands were lashed  
And ran towards the cove where my boat was stashed  
Singing Oh Wilson someday Ill kill you til you die  
Oh Wilson punch you in the eye  
Hey  
Now Wilson knew that I was loose  
Id surely be subjected to some real abuse  
Maybe end up hanging from the nearest tree  
So angrily I paddled to the open sea  
But the sea was eager to beat me back  
And the waves grew huge and deadly black  
And the gray clouds rumbled over my head  
And I feared in my heart that Id soon be dead  
When the morning came and the storm had passed  
The dismal fog began at last  
To open up before my eyes  
And there I saw to my surprise  
Chains and specks of islands curved  
Where palm trees dipped and seagulls swerved  
Parked my kayak on a stone  
And yelled across the ocean to his evil throne  
I said Oh Wilson someday Ill kill you til you die  
Oh Wilson punch you in the eye  
Wilson kill you til you die  
Oh Wilson punch you in the eye
