Where is the love that we once knew  
There were no hangups between me and you  
Where are the words we use to speak  
Before you fell out of love with me  
  
Wheres the good loving you use to give  
Alone is a bad bad way to live  
Arms so soft lips so sweet  
Before you fell out of love with me  
  
Where are the walks we use to take  
Where are the plans we use to make  
Where are the dreams we use to dream  
Before you fell out of love with me  
  
Where are the laughs use to have  
Why did the good times turn into the bad  
Where are the mornings we use to see  
Before you fell out of love with me  
  
Where are the nights wed stay awake  
Where is the love we use to make  
Wheres your body so eager and free  
Before you fell out of love with me  
  
I was just thinnking how life use to be  
Before you fell out of love with me
