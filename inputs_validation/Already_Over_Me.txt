As you poured out the drinks for me  
I felt your hooks sink right into me  
And I knew you were my destiny  
And I thought youd get the best of me  
  
On the way down to Mexico  
As I danced in your rodeo  
You say poverty is picturesque  
As you dragged your nails across my chest  
  
Youre so cold  
Youre so cruel  
Im your man  
Not your fool  
  
Are you already over me  
Are you already over me  
Are you already over me  
What a fool Ive been  
  
In the first flush of ecstasy  
As you lay naked next to me  
While our love put the dawn to flight  
I just ignore all those warning lights  
  
Cause when you laugh  
I just cry  
When you left  
I just died  
  
Are you already over me  
Are you already over me  
Are you already sick me  
What a fool Ive been  
  
Hard to hold on  
To a love divine  
Im kneeling in a corner  
Praying to your shrine  
  
Ive been hurt  
So confused  
Ive been burned  
Ive been bruised  
  
Are you already over me  
Are you already over me  
Are you already sick of me  
Are you already over me  
Are you already over me  
Are you already tired of me  
Are you already over me  
What a fool Ive been  
What a fool Ive been  
What a fool Ive been
