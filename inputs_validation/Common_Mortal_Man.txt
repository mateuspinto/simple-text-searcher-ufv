I was on my way to a needle factory  
Up and coming prospects was a waiting there for me  
I was selling my wares three bucks a share  
Three bucks a share  
Three bucks a share  
  
I was walking down down a rocky road and found  
A noisy rising sun and a quietly burning moon  
They were standing in line standing in time  
Standing in time waiting for a fantastic time  
Standing in line  
  
Like a stallion chasing fear itself  
Watching God sit upon his shelf  
We were restless we were restless  
We were restless  
But we had to keep on going we were restless  
  
I was looking high but I was feeling low  
Sun said Man dont sweat the moon kept still and glowed  
The truth is in the eyes of common mortal men  
And you can believe its all in the grief of Satan  
Its all in the grief of Satan  
  
The truth is in the eye  
The truth is in the eye  
The truth is in the eye  
The truth is in the eye  
The truth is in the eye  
The truth is in the eye  
And you can feel
