I wonder whos sleeping in your sheets tonight  
Whose head rests upon the bed  
Could it be a close friend I knew so well  
Who seems to be so close to you instead  
Close to you instead  
  
Im blue tonight Im red when Im mad  
Im green when Im jealous yellow when Im sad  
I guess I cannot have everything  
So much has flown between the years  
When I was twenty and you were seventeen  
  
So out of choice I chose rock and roll  
But it pushed me to the limit everyday  
It turned me into a gypsy kept me away from home  
From there on there seemed no use for you  
For you to stay  
  
And if I shower around 3 am  
Its just to wash away  
The trace of a love unwanted  
Oh in the times I went astray  
The times I went astray  
  
So much has flown between the years  
When I was twenty and you were seventeen
