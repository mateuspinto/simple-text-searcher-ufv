From a far off galaxy I hear you calling me  
We are on an odyssey  
Through the realms of time and space  
In that enchanted place  
You and I come face to face  
  
Once upon not yet long ago someday  
Countless times weve met met along the way  
  
Through the luminescent night  
On beams of neon light  
You and I in winged flight  
As we cross the starry sea powered by what we see  
Now and then the victory  
  
Theres a child in a sundress  
Looking at a rainy sky  
Theres a place in the desert  
Where an ocean once danced by  
Theres a song in the silence  
Weaving in and out of time  
We are notes in the music  
Searching for remembered rhyme  
  
On a mountain high somewhere  
Where only heroes dare  
Stand the stallion and the mare  
We have been and we shall be each others destiny  
One anothers odyssey  
  
Theres a child in a sundress  
Looking at a rainy sky  
Theres a place in the desert  
Where an ocean once did lie  
Theres a song in the silence  
Weaving in and out of time  
We are notes in the music  
Searching for remembered rhyme  
  
Weve met along the way  
Weve met along the way
