Would you say no if I asked you for your hand  
Could you believe in the same words that I dont understand  
And would you cry if I told you I must go  
  
Chorus  
  
Ive been waiting such a long long time I think I could stand you forever  
Ive been wanting you a long long time I think I could stand you forever  
  
Would you say no if I asked you for this one chance  
Am I a fool to believe that this night is circumstance  
I wish that for once you could see the look in your own eyes  
  
I think I could stand you forever  
Think I could stand you think I could stand you forever yeah  
Think I could stand you forever yeah  I think I could stand you  
Think I could stand you forever yeah  forever and ever  
Think I could stand you forever yeah  
Think I could stand you forever and ever and ever
