Hello little girl  
Hello little girl  
Hello little girl  
  
When I see you everyday  
I say Mm mm hello little girl  
When youre passing on your way  
I say Mm mm hello little girl  
When I see you passing by  
I cry Mm mm hello little girl  
When I try to catch your eye  
I cry Mm mm hello little girl  
  
I send you flowers but you dont care  
You never seem to see me standing there  
I often wonder what youre thinking of  
I hope its me and love love love  
  
So I hope therell come a day  
When youll say Mm youre my little girl  
  
Its not the first time that its happened to me  
Its been a long lonely time  
And its funny funny to see that Im about to lose my mind mind mind  
  
So I hope therell come a day  
When you say Mm mm  
Youre my little girl mm mm mm  
Youre my little girl mm mm mm  
Youre my little girl oh yeah  
Youre my little girl  
  
Do do do do do
