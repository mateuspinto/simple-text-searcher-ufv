Choo choo train chuggin down the track  
Gotta travel on never comin back  
Oh oh got a one way ticket to the blues  
  
Bye bye love my babys leavin me  
Now lonely teardrops are all that I can see  
Oh oh got a one way ticket to the blues  
  
Gonna take a trip to lonesome town  
Gonna stay at heartbreak hotel  
A fool such as I that never learns  
I cry a tear so well
