Ooh I go swimming swimming in the water  
Swimming in the river swimming in the sea  
I go swimming  
I go swimming swimming in the water  
Swimming in the pool swimming is cool  
I go swimming  
  
The sun is burning I am yearning  
For the water flow water flow  
Next to my skin I like to begin a  
water flow water flow  
Letting off steam I float in a dream  
I cant let go cant let go  
Follow my wishes follow the fishes  
Down below down below  
I go swimming  
  
I need water water to drink  
Water on my brain water sustain  
Water over me  
I want water water I need  
Water to think water to drink  
Water over me  
  
The sun is burning I am yearning  
For the water flow water flow  
Next to my skin I like to begin a  
water flow water flow  
Letting off steam I float in a dream  
I cant let go cant let go  
Follow my wishes follow the fishes  
Down below down below  
I go swimming  
  
I go swimming I go swimming  
Swimming in water swimming in water swimming in water  
Water all over me  
Swimming in water swimming in water swimming in water  
I go swimming I go swimming  
I go swimming I go swimming  
Swimming I go swimming  
Oh I go swimming I go swimming  
Water all over me  
Swimming in water swimming in water swimming in water  
Water all over me  
Swimming in water swimming in water swimming in water  
Water all over me  
Swimming in water swimming in water swimming in water  
Water all over me
