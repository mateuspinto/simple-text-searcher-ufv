I dont want to be I dont want to be  
A good time girl A good time girl  
  
String you along like I string my pearls  
A typical good time girl  
A good time girl  
A good time girl  
A typical good time girl  
I dont need no diamonds now  
Theyd seem like broken glass  
Id never wear a fur  
Would seem like stepping into anothers skin  
A typical good time girl like me  
  
A good time girl  
A good time girl  
A typical good time girl repeat  
  
A typical good time girl repeat
