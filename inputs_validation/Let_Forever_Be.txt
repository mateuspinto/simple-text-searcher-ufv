And how does it feel like to wake up in ther sun  
And how does it feel like to shine on everyone  
How does it feel like to let forever be  
And how does it feel like to spend a little lifetime sitting in the gutter  
Scream my symphony  
screen my sin for me  
How does it feel like to sail in on the breeze  
And how does it feel like to spend a little lifetime sitting in the gutter  
Scream my symphony  
screen my sin for me  
  
How does it feel like to make it happening  
And how does it feel like to be with everything  
And how does it feel like to let forever be  
And how does it feel like to spend a little lifetime sitting in the gutter  
Scream my symphony  
screen my sin for me  
  
How does it feel like to be in christamine  
And how does it feel like to spend a little lifetime sitting in the gutter  
Scream my symphony  
screen my sin for me
