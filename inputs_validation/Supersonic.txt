original by Oasis   
  
I need to be myself  
I cant be no one else  
Im feeling supersonic  
Give me gin and tonic  
You can have it all but how much do you want it  
You make me laugh  
Give me your autograph  
Can I ride with you in your BMW   
You can sail with me in my yellow submarine  
You need to find out  
Cos no ones gonna tell you what Im on about  
You need to find a way for what you want to say  
But before tomorrow  
Cos my friend said hed take you home  
He sits in a corner all alone  
He lives under a waterfall  
Nobody can see him  
Nobody can ever hear him call  
You need to be yourself  
You cant be no one else  
I know a girl called Elsa  
Shes into Alka Seltzer  
She sniffs it through a cane on a supersonic train  
She made me laugh  
I got her autograph  
She done it with a doctor on a helicopter  
Shes sniffin in her tissue  
Sellin the Big Issue  
She needs to find out  
Cos no ones gonna tell you what Im on about  
She needs to find a way for what she wants to say  
But before tomorrow  
Cos my friend said hed take you home  
He sits in a corner all alone  
He lives under a waterfall  
No body can see him  
No body can ever hear him call
