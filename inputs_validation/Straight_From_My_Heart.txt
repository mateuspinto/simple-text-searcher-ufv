The suns still warm and most days are good  
The world still turns like you said it would  
But this pain seems to never let me go  
And there is really no movin on  
Theres only going along  
  
And I will always be  
Better for you loving me  
Better for the times we shared  
That travel with me everywhere  
  
And I will always try  
To hold my head up to the sky  
If only just to let you know  
That straight from my heart  
I still miss you so  
  
If I could I would gladly trade  
A thousand tomorrows for one yesterday  
There are so many things that I would say  
Youre a part of every memory  
That lives on in me  
  
Chorus
