Would you like to go with me  
Down my dead end street  
Would you like to come with me  
To Village Ghetto Land  
  
See the people lock their doors  
While robbers laugh and steal  
Beggars watch and eat their meal  from garbage cans  
  
Broken glass is everywhere  
Its a bloody scene  
Killing plauges the citizens  
Unless they own police  
  
Children play with rusted cars  
Sores cover their hands  
Politicians laugh ad drink  drunk to all demands  
  
Families buying dog food now  
Starvation roams the streets  
Babies die before theyre born  
Infected by the grief  
  
Now some folks say that we should be  
Glad for what we have  
Tell me would you be happy in Village Ghetto Land  
  
Village Ghetto Land
