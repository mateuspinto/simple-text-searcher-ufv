Im so afraid to draw you close  
Hold me  
Before my hands fall away  
Ill suffocate  
If I cant breathe you in  
And hold you there  
Forever  
  
I left a message at the hotel  
They said you checked out  
They said you aint coming back  
I tried to call you  
But you turned off your cell  
And it said at the tone  
Just leave me alone  
  
And I fall apart at the seams  
It seems that I always always fall apart  
But as strong as I am  
Why cant I break your heart  
  
I remember how it used to be  
Making love to you all night long  
I used to take you in my arms  
And hold you there until all my strength was gone  
I used to be a man of steel  
I used to be a man of steel  
  
I built this prison that I thought was a home  
And we both lived here  
Guess you were living alone  
Id tear it down if you would only have asked  
And I would build you a bridge  
So you could come back  
  
And I fall apart at the seams  
It seems that I always always fall apart  
But as strong as I am  
Why cant I break your heart  
  
I remember how it used to be  
Making love to you all night long  
I used to take you in my arms  
And hold you there until all your fears were gone  
I used to be a man of steel  
I used to be a man of steel  
I used to be a man of steel  
I used to be a man of steel  
Hey now tell me why cant you just break my heart  
I used to be an man of steel  
And I used to take you in my arms  
I loved you from the start  
Now you cant tear my world apart  
  
I used to be a man of steel  
Now every bit of faith is gone  
You used to be so strong  
Now you cant even break my heart  
I used to be a man of steel  
I used to take you in my arms  
Whats it going to take for us to break down  
And finally fall  
Apart at the seams  
It seems that I always fall apart  
As strong as you are  
As strong as I am  
Why cant you break my heart
