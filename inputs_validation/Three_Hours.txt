Three hours from sundown  
Jeremy flies  
Hoping to keep  
The sun from his eyes  
East from the city  
And down to the cave  
In search of a master  
In search of a slave  
  
Three hours from London  
Jacomos free  
Taking his woes  
Down to the sea  
In search of a lifetime  
To tell when hes home  
In search of a story  
Thats never been known  
  
Three hours from speaking  
Everyones flown  
Not wanting to be  
Seen on their own  
Three hours is needed  
To leave from them all  
Three hours to wonder  
And three hours to fall  
  
Three hours from sundown  
Jeremy flies  
Hoping to keep the sun from his eyes  
East from the city  
And down to the cave  
In search of a master  
In search of a slave
