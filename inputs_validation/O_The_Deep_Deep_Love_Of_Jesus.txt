O the deep deep love of Jesus vast unmeasured boundless free  
Rolling as a mighty ocean in its fullness over me  
Underneath me all around me is the current of Thy love  
Leading onward leading homeward to Thy glorious rest above  
O the deep deep love of Jesus spread His praise from shore to shore  
How He loveth ever loveth changeth never evermore  
How He watches oer His loved ones died to call them all His own  
How for them He intercedeth watcheth oer them from the throne  
O the deep deep love of Jesus tis a heavn of heavns to me  
And it lifts me up to glory for it lifts me up to Thee yeah  
Incomprehensible  
And it lifts me up to glory
