You have your rules and regulations  
You say his love is my salvation  
Then talk of faith and segregation  
You say that I must wait  
He will communicate  
I will not join your congregation  
  
You force me into situations  
Preach bad of sin and fornication  
Forget your sworded celebration  
My heart fills up with rage  
Who are you to gauge  
The purpose of my worlds creation  
  
I cannot see the light your seeing  
I have my own thoughts to believe in  
I will not heed the words your hearing  
I will not be accused my liberty abused  
You chose the cross that you are bearing  
  
why want me to believe the words you read  
But I dont believe in what your good book says  
I just believe that when Im dead Im dead  
You say I must repent  
Bow down and show respect  
I am a man and I will not be led
