Try to make me bow down to you  
Try to take my identity  
Try to make me just another pebble on the beach  
A green mind twists the plan  
A cold hand trying to silence me  
You try to grasp me but Im out of reach  
No Spiritual Surrender  
No Spiritual Surrender  
Try to make me bow down to you  
Try to take my identity  
Try to make me just another pebble on the beach  
A green mind twists the plan  
A cold hand trying to silence me  
Trying to grasp me but Im out of reach  
No Spiritual Surrender  
No Spiritual Surrender
