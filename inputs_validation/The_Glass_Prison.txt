Cunning Baffling Powerful  
Been beaten to a pulp  
Vigorous irresistible  
Sick and tired and laid low  
Dominating Invisible  
Blackout loss of control  
Overwhelming Unquenchable  
Im powerless have to let go  
  
I cant escape it  
It leaves me frail and worn  
Can no longer take it  
Senses tattered and torn  
  
Hopeless surrender  
Obsessions got me beat  
Losing the will to live  
Admitting complete defeat  
  
Fatal Descent  
Spinning around  
Ive gone too far  
To turn back round  
  
Desperate attempt  
Stop the progression  
At any length  
Lift this obsession  
  
Crawling to my glass prison  
A place where no one knows  
My secret lonely world begins  
  
So much safer here  
A place where I can go  
To forget about my daily sins  
  
Life here in my glass prison  
A place I once called home  
Fall in nocturnal bliss again  
  
Chasing a long lost friend  
I no longer can control  
Just waiting for this hopelessness to end  
  
Run fast from the wreckage of the past  
A shattered glass prison wall behind me  
Fight past walking through the ashes  
A distant oasis before me  
  
Cry desperate crawling on my knees  
Begging God to please stop the insanity  
Help me Im trying to believe  
Stop wallowing in my own self pity  
  
Weve been waiting for you my friend  
The writings been on the wall  
All it takes is a little faith  
You know youre the same as us all  
  
Help me I cant break out this prison all alone  
Save me Im drowning and Im hopeless on my own  
Heal me I cant restore my sanity alone  
  
Enter the door  
Desperate  
Fighting no more  
Help me restore  
To my sanity  
At this temple of hope  
  
I need to learn  
Teach me how  
Sorrow to burn  
Help me return  
To humanity  
Ill be fearless and thorough  
The enter this temple of hope  
  
Believe  
Transcend the pain  
Living the live  
Humility  
Opened my eyes  
This new odyssey  
Of rigorous honesty  
  
Serenity  
I never knew  
Soundness of mind  
Helped me to find  
Courage the change  
All the things that I can  
  
Well help you perform this miracle  
But you must set your past free  
You dug the hole but you cant bury your soul  
Open your mind and you will see  
  
Help me I cant break out this prison all alone  
Save me Im drowning and Im hopeless on my own  
Heal me I cant restore my sanity alone  
  
Way off in the distance I saw the door  
I tried to open  
I tried forcing with all of my will and still  
The door wouldnt open  
  
Unable to trust in my faith  
I turned and walked away  
I looked around felt a chill in the air  
Took my will and turned it over  
  
The glass prison which once held me is now gone  
A long lost fortress  
Armed only with liberty  
And the key of my willingness  
  
Fell down on my knees and prayed  
Thy will be done  
I turned around saw a light shining through  
The door was wide open
