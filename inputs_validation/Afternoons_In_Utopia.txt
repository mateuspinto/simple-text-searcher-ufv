Acrobats and comets floating by so fast  
Childrens faces smile like suns at last  
Lilac butterflies are cruising without fear  
All inviting you to stay and rest here  
  
You can halt your car for an afternoon in utopia  
We shall stop the wars on those afternoons in utopia  
Mighty Mao moondog drifts across the grass  
Healing lullabies for easter time on mars  
  
Paint your hats and shoues with flowers and with stars  
Singing in metropolitan operas  
You can halt your car for an afternoon in utopia  
We shall stop the wars on those afternoons in utopia
