We dont exist  
We are nothing but shadow and mist  
In the mirror we look as we pass  
Our reflections revealed in the glass  
  
Dont you know that the blood in your veins  
Is as lifeless as yesterdays rain  
Its a game where we come and conceal  
The confusion we feel  
As long as were nameless  
Our bodies are blameless  
  
You cried when we kissed  
It was nothing but shadow and mist  
Two illusion who touch in a trance  
Making love not by choice but by chance  
  
To a theme we tore from their past  
To a tango we swore was their last  
We are shadows of dance  
  
As long as were nameless  
Our bodies are blameless  
  
You cried when we kissed  
It was nothing but shadow and mist  
Two illusions who touch in a trance  
Making love not by choice but by chance  
To a theme that we tore from their past  
To a tango we swore was their last  
We are shadows of dance  
  
The last tango  
The last tango
