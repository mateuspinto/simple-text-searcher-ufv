I got the right street  
But the wrong direction  
Help me find the way  
To your affection  
Im on the right train  
But the wrong track  
Come on boy  
Help me get it all back  
  
You know i love you baby  
Dont tell me maybe  
I got the right street baby  
But the wrong direction  
  
Told me that out love would last forever  
You would always be here by my side  
But you found somebody new  
And left me sittin right here  
Wallowing in my pity and my pride  
  
I got the right street  
But the wrong direction  
Help me find the way  
To your affection  
Im on the right train  
But the wrong track  
Come on boy  
Help me get it all back  
  
You know i love you baby  
Dont tell me maybe  
I got the right street baby  
But the wrong direction  
  
Told me youd be livin for my affection  
Oh you say your love grows stronger every day  
But as soon as another woman be playin in your backyard  
You break my heart and throw my dreams away  
  
I got the right street  
But the wrong direction  
Help me find the way  
To your affection  
Im on the right train  
But the wrong track  
Come on boy  
Help me get it all back  
  
You know i love you baby dont say maybe  
  
Got the right street but the wrong direction repeat to end
