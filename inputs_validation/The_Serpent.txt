Dark nights the planets are set  
Creator prepares for the dawn of man  
Youre waking up the day of incarnation  
Said your waking up to life  
Images he made to love  
Images of gods in flesh  
Man is wonderful very wonderful look at him  
Beware the future  
Here is my world and its waiting for me  
Paradise before my eyes  
I am alive in a new born world  
This heaven will always be mine  
Im waking up the day of man has come  
Im waking up the day of man has come  
And God created man from dust  
With a soul inside his mould  
And God created womankind  
The vessel of Satans hold  
Creator made the serpent wise  
Evil in his tempting eyes  
Man is wonderful very wonderful look at him  
Beware the future  
Here is my world and its waiting for me  
Paradise before my eyes  
I am alive in a new born world  
This heaven will always be mine  
Im waking up the day of man has come  
Im waking up the day of man has come  
Dark nights the planets are set  
Creator prepares for the dawn of man  
Youre waking up the day of incarnation  
Said your waking up to life  
Here I stand a child in a lonely world  
See the serpent tempting me to evil  
The guiding hand will help me on  
The guiding hand will help me on
