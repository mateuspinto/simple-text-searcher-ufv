Sittin here thumbin through the pages of a magazine  
The pages tell me come right away you know what I mean  
The air is so spacey the ladies are lacey  
And there is nothing you gotta do  
But eat hot chili  
Hot chili is groovy  
After a movie or watching TV  
But when you order  
South of the border  
Soon you see  
Its hotter than noon  
It will melt your spoon  
So buddy you better get ready  
For eatin hot chili  
Its not silly  
To eat hot chili  
Passport in hand  
I made my plan to get away  
Hopped on a plane  
Rode out of the rain the very same day  
Soon as I landed  
My wish it was granted  
Lovely senoritas always drinkin tequila yeah yeah yeah  
And eatin hot chili  
Eatin hot chili  
I love hot chili  
Ooh I love it hot chili  
Hot chili ooh
