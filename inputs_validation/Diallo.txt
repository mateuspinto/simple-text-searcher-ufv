Boy I am so tired  
Ill be glad when I get inside the house  
Oh I dropped my keys  
Oh what tis bright light  
My God they must gonna rob me  
Who these people with them all at they gonna rob me  
Im gonna take out my wallet to make sure they just get the money  
Nothing else  
Oh its the police whew  
I feel so much better  
I will show them I have my ID  
so they know I am good people  
  
Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death  
I fear no evil for thou art with me thou ride with me
