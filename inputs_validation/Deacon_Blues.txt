This is the day of the expanding man  
That shape is my shade  
There where I used to stand  
It seems like only yesterday  
I gazed through the glass  
At ramblers wild gamblers  
Thats all in the past  
  
You call me a fool  
You say its a crazy scheme  
This ones for real  
I already bought the dream  
So useless to ask me why  
Throw a kiss and say goodbye  
Ill make it this time  
Im ready to cross that fine line  
  
Chorus  
Ill learn to work the saxophone  
I play just what I feel  
Drink Scotch whiskey all night long  
And die behind the wheel  
They got a name for the winners in the world  
And I want a name when I lose  
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide  
Call me Deacon Blues  
  
My back to the wall  
A victim of laughing chance  
This is for me  
The essence of true romance  
Sharing the things we know and love  
With those of my kind  
Libations  
Sensations  
That stagger the mind  
  
I crawl like a viper  
Through these suburban streets  
Make love to these women  
Languid and bittersweet  
Ill rise when the sun goes down  
Cover every game in town  
A world of my own  
Ill make it my home sweet home  
  
Chorus  
  
This is the night of the expanding man  
I take one last drag  
As I approach the stand  
I cried when I wrote this song  
Sue me if I play too long  
This brother is free  
Ill be what I want to be
