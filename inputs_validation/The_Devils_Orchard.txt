This is obsidian  
The grip of winter unkind  
Devil will follow  
Be cast out and sworn to the dark  
Take the road where devils speak  
God is dead God is dead  
  
Throw out the darkness  
Inside you telling you now  
Senses corrupted  
Controlling a poisonous will  
Take the road where devils speak  
God is dead God is dead  
  
In the corner of my eye  
Demon fades from the hole  
  
Led the blind  
Searched to find  
A pathway to the sun  
Saw the signs  
Intertwined  
Forgave me all my sins  
Why why  
Oh stigmats revealing our vices  
And oh oh stigmats revealing our vices  
  
God is dead God is dead
