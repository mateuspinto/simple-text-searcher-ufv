We do not worship an unknown God  
For Youve revealed Yourself to us  
And the more we see the more we love  
This revelation of Your heart  
And we are falling falling falling  
We are falling so in love with You  
  
Beyond all question Youre a mystery  
We have known the shallows of the mighty deep  
Unsearchable greatness of a holy God  
Yet day by day You reveal Your heart  
And we are falling falling falling  
We are falling so in love with You  
  
Well how could hearts not love Your Name  
While all creation sings Your praise  
And every breath points back to You Jesus  
  
Now in part we see You then face to face  
And well know You fully as were fully known  
And the depths of glory You now hide away  
They will be revealed on that glorious day  
And we are falling falling falling  
We are falling so in love with You
