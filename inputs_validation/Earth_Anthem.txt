And we are but an island  
  
In an ocean  
This is our home  
Third from the sun  
Let it be evergreen  
Let it be evergreen  
And we are but an island  
  
In an ocean  
This is our home  
Third from the sun  
God keep it evergreen  
To keep it ever green  
I would lay my life down  
And we are but an island  
  
In an ocean  
This is our home  
Third from the sun  
Let it be evergreen  
Let it be evergreen
