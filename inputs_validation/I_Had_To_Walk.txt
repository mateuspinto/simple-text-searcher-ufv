Babies they must first learn how to crawl before they walk  
Oh and Children they must first learn how to speak before  
they talk  
  
I had to walk to get there I had to walk  
  
There is a season to everything on the earth  
What came first  
There is a reason and after death there is rebirth  
For what its worth  
  
I had to walk to get there I had to walk to get there  
  
Everytime I face adversity it causes me to grow  
Oh you didnt know  
Everytime you thought you were hurting me you caused me to  
grow  
Oh you didnt know Oh you didnt know  
  
I had to walk to get there I had to let go to get there I  
had to walk to get there I had to walk
