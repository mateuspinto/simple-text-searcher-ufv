If I asked you question  
Like  
does this dress make me look fat  
Youd probably say no  
Trying not to hurt my feelings  
But what hurts the most  
Is you cant tell me  
Something  
Without telling a lie  
  
Chorus  
Oh quit telling lies  
Youre making me  
Making me cry  
Oh quit telling lies  
Ive had it with your alibis  
Theres left to hide  
So please dont lie  
  
Times are getting rocky  
Cause of all of your lying  
Why  
  
Must you see me like this  
I cry  
And I cry  
And I wonder why  
Youd do this to me  
  
Chorus  
  
And  
Why must you  
Break my heart  
This way  
And look me in the eye  
And tell me  
If you really love me  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh ooh oh  
Hey  
  
Quit telling lies
