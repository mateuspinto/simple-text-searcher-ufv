Words and music by roger taylor  
They were talking in whispers  
In bear skins and fur  
Captain scott and his heroes to be  
To have laboured so long  
To have made it this far  
Ooh its been such a long ride  
Ooh you know its been a long way  
For a human human human  
For a human body you see  
Can you believe it happens  
Now it happens here  
Do you believe do you believe or really care  
Can you believe it happens  
Now it happens here  
To a human human  
With a human body you see  
There aint nobody gets out of this moonlight  
Today is surprisingly fair  
Oh oh oh oh woo woo  
Weve got problems the lone ranger cant fix  
The invisible man couldnt see  
It takes a tough guy  
To learn some new tricks  
Ooh it takes such a long time  
Ooh its been such a long way  
For a human human human  
For a human body you see  
Can you believe it happens  
Now it happens here  
Do you believe do you believe or really care  
Can you believe it happens  
Now it happens here  
To a human human  
With a human body you see  
You know its been such a long while  
Its been such a long while  
Takes such a long time  
It takes such a long time  
Its been such a long way  
Been such a long way  
Its been such a long while  
Been such a long while  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Its gonna be a long ride
