Is it a kind of dream  
Floating out on the tide  
Following the river of death downstream  
Oh is it a dream  
  
Theres a fog along the horizon  
A strange glow in the sky  
And nobody seems to know where you go  
And what does it mean  
Oh is it a dream  
  
Bright eyes  
Burning like fire  
Bright eyes  
How can you close and fail  
How can the light that burned so brightly  
Suddenly burn so pale  
Bright eyes  
  
Is it a kind of shadow  
Reaching into the night  
Wandering over the hills unseen  
Or is it a dream  
  
Theres a high wind in the trees  
A cold sound in the air  
And nobody ever knows when you go  
And where do you start  
Oh into the dark  
  
Bright eyes  
Burning like fire  
Bright eyes  
How can you close and fail  
How can the light that burned so brightly  
Suddenly burn so pale  
Bright eyes  
  
Bright eyes  
Burning like fire  
Bright eyes  
How can you close and fail  
How can the light that burned so brightly  
Suddenly burn so pale  
Bright eyes
