Give me the flammable life  
Im cold as a match ready to strike  
So here I go  
Here lies a city on fire  
Singing along the arsonist choir  
Now here I go  
It started with a spark  
And burned into the dark  
Now here I go  
  
There is a river I found  
Into the wild under the ground  
So here I go  
A button on a string  
And I heard everything  
Now here I go  
  
Oh sweet ignition be my fuse  
You have no choice you have to choose  
Bid farewell to yesterday  
Say goodbye Im on my way  
But in the end we all  
Come from whats come before  
So here I go  
  
Oh sweet ignition be my fuse  
You had no choice you had to choose  
Bid farewell to yesterday  
Say goodbye Im on my way  
I threw it all away because  
I had to be what never was  
Been so hungry I could lie  
You took my word I took your wine  
And held you in my bloody hands  
These rattled bones and rubber bands  
Washed them in the muddy water  
Looking for a dime and found a quarter  
  
But you cant make me change my name  
Youll never make me change my name  
Pay no mind now aint thats something  
Fuck it all I came from nothing  
  
Im something from nothing  
You are my fuse  
Im something from nothing  
You are my fuse  
It goes oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
It goes oh oh oh  
Alright  
  
No you cant make me change my name  
Youll never make me change my name  
Pay no mind now wait thats something  
Fuck it all I came from nothing  
  
Im something from nothing  
Im something from nothing
