Its so lonely out tonight  
And the feeling just got right  
For a brand new love song  
Somebody done somebody wrong song  
  
Hey wont you play another  
Somebody done somebody wrong song  
And make me feel at home  
While I miss my baby while I miss my baby  
  
So play play for me a sad melody  
So sad that it makes everybody cry  
A real hurtin song about a love thats gone wrong  
Cause I dont wanna cry all alone  
  
So hey wont you play another  
Somebody done somebody wrong song  
And make me feel at home  
While I miss my baby while I miss my baby  
  
So play play for me a sad melody  
So sad that it makes everybody cry  
A real hurtin song about a love thats gone wrong  
Cause I dont wanna cry all alone  
  
Hey wont you play another  
Somebody done somebody wrong song  
And make me feel at home  
While I miss my baby while I miss my baby  
  
Somebody done somebody wrong song  
And make me feel at home  
While I miss my baby while I miss my baby  
I miss my baby
