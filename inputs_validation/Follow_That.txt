If your heart is restless and you cant go on  
When youre tired and weary but you cant go on  
Well a distant dream is a callin you  
Then theres just one thing that you can do  
  
Yeah you gotta follow that dream wherever that dream may lead you  
You gotta follow that dream wherever that dream may lead  
  
Now if I walk in dreams  
And if I talk in dreams  
I need someone with a love I can trust  
And together well search for the things that come to us  
Baby in dreams in dreams  
  
Now every man has the right to live  
The right to a chance to give what he has to give  
The right to fight for the things he believes  
For the things that come to him in dreams  
  
Baby in dreams I walk in dreams  
I talk in dreams  
I live in dreams
