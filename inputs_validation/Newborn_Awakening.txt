Gently they stir gently rise  
The dead are newborn awakening  
With ravaged limbs and wet souls  
Gently they sigh in rapt funeral amazement  
Who called these dead to dance  
Was it the young woman learning to play the ghost song on her baby grand  
Was it the wilderness children  
Was it the ghost god himself stuttering cheering chatting blindly  
I called you up to anoint the earth  
I called you to announce sadness falling like burned skin  
I called you to wish you well  
To glory in self like a new monster  
And now I call you to pray
