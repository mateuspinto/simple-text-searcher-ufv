Theres a city draped in net  
Fisherman net  
And in the half light in the half light  
It looks like every tower  
Is covered in webs  
Moving and glistening and rocking  
Its babies in rhythm  
As the spider of time is climbing  
Over the ruins  
  
There were hundreds of people living here  
Sails at the windows  
And the planes came crashing down  
And many a pilot drowned  
And the speed boats flying above  
Put your hand over the side of the boat  
What do you feel  
  
My mother and her little brown jug  
It held her milk  
And now it holds our memories  
I can hear her singing  
Little brown jug dont I love thee  
Little brown jug dont I love thee  
Ho ho ho hee hee hee  
  
I hear her laughing  
She is standing in the kitchen  
As we come in the back door  
See it fall  
See it fall  
Oh little spider climbing out of a broken jug  
And the pieces will lay there a while  
In a house draped in net  
In a room filled with coral  
Sails at the window  
Forests of masts  
Put your hand over the side of the boat  
Put your hand over the side of the boat  
What do you feel
