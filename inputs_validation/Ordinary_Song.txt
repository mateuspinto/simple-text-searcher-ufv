Just an ordinary song  
To a special girl like you  
From a simple guy  
Whos so in love with you  
  
I may not have much to show  
No diamonds a glow  
No limousines  
To take you where you go  
  
But if you ever find yourself  
Tired of all the games you play  
When the world seems so unfair  
You can count on me to stay  
Just take sometime to lend an ear  
To this ordinary song  
  
Just an ordinary song  
To a special girl like you  
From a simple guy  
Whos so in love with you  
  
I dont even have the looks  
To make you glance my way  
The clothes I wear  
May just seem so absurd  
  
But deep inside of me is you  
You give life to what I do  
All those years may see you thru  
Still Ill be waiting here for you  
If you have time  
Pls lend an ear to this ordinary song  
  
Just an ordinary song  
To a special girl like you  
From a simple guy  
Whos so in love with you
