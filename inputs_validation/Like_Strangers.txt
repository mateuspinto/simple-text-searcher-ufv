Like Strangers thats what we are  
Darling how can lovers pull apart so far  
Like Strangers how can it be  
Only days ago we loved so tenderly  
  
I love you truly I do  
And I hope deep in your heart you love me too  
Lets forget that weve been angry  
Lets be lovers like before  
And swear not to be like strangers anymore
