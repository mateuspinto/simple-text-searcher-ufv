enlightened woman  
She dances on the seven seas  
Dances on the ocean  
Sunlight on her golden hair  
Shapes of pure emotion  
Her voice is heard like  
Crystal words across the sky  
She moves just like an angel  
Shes the mistress of all time  
Her sun pours down like liquid gold  
To chase away the sorrows  
Her clothes are like a million stars  
Made of tears and rainbows  
And all the while  
Her senses smile into my life  
She moves just like an angel  
Shes a mistress of all time  
Just like the restless  
To a mission bell  
I must run to her  
Meet her everywhere  
As her music fills the universe  
She leaves the dancing visions  
Of her image on the water  
And precious stones upon the shore  
From every distant corner  
Like diamonds in the light  
They shine beyond the stars  
She moves just like an angel  
Shes the mistress of all time  
She dances on the seven seas  
Dances on the ocean  
Sunlight on her golden hair  
Shapes of pure emotion  
Her voice is heard like  
Crystal words across the sky  
She moves me like an angel  
Shes the mistress of all time  
She moves me like an angel  
A voice of pure emotion  
Her tears are like a rainbow
