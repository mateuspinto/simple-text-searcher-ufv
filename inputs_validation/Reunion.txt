I had guards like watchdogs  
Dogs in a manger  
I could feel the protection  
Possession and anger  
And I drove out of there  
With no on behind me  
Feeling funny and free  
All you pretty pretenders  
Negligent vendors  
Arent you precious inside  
I have no need for anger  
With intimate strangers  
And I got nothing to hide  
Yeah  
  
I laughed as I said it  
This is my situation  
Its not pictures or privilege  
Its just self preservation  
I dont want you to feel  
Any obligation  
It feels so funny to be free  
All you pretty pretenders  
Negligent vendors  
Arent you precious inside  
I have no need for anger  
With intimate strangers  
And I got nothing to hide  
  
We act empty and innocent  
But we are fueled by distortions  
I remember you  
Of lives led in discontent  
When we were shiny and new  
Trading misfortunes  
Now you guard your faith  
Cause faith is one thing  
That is hard to deliver  
Temper your speed  
It feels so funny to be free  
  
All you pretty pretenders  
Negligent vendors  
Arent you precious inside  
I have no need for anger  
With intimate strangers  
And I got nothing to hide  
I got nothing to hide  
  
All of us arent we  
Pretty pretenders  
Negligent vendors  
Arent we precious inside  
I have no need for anger  
With intimate strangers  
And I got nothing to hide  
I got nothing to hide  
  
I had guards like watchdogs  
Dogs in a manger  
I remember you
