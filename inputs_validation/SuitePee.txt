Lend me thy blades

Ravages of architecture  
Hoist around the spade

Lie naked on the floor  
And let the messiah  
Go through our souls  
Lie naked on the floor  
And let the messiah  
Go all through our souls  
Die like a motherfucker

Die like a motherfucker  
Why like a motherfucker

My way to the garden  
Cause everyone needs  
A motherfucker
