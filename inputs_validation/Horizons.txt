I want to want to sail a boat across the sea  
Four winds four winds in the sails and in me  
  
See all the all the time I wasted from you  
Got to got to get so closer to you  
  
I see the horizon of your love  
I see the horizon of your love  
  
The navigation of desire in my heart  
Leads me leads me across the oceans so far  
  
Horizon ahead ahead I can see your face now  
So long so long I must say goodbye now  
  
Of your looking looking for the buried treasure  
Dig down dig down and find that buried love
