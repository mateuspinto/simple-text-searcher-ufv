And the angel of the lord came unto me  
snatching me up from my place of slumber  
And took me on high and higher still  
Until we moved to the spaces betwixt the air itself  
And he brought me into a vast farmlands of our own midwest  
And as we descended cries of impending doom rose from the soil  
One thousand nay a million voices full of fear  
And terror possessed me then  
And I begged Angel of the Lord what are these tortured screams  
And the angel said unto me  
These are the cries of the carrots the cries of the carrots  
You see Reverend Maynard  
Tomorrow is harvest day and to them it is the holocaust  
And I sprang from my slumber drenched in sweat  
Like the tears of one million terrified brothers and roared  
Hear me now I have seen the light  
They have a consciousness they have a life they have a soul  
Damn you Let the rabbits wear glasses Save our brothers  
Can I get an amen Can I get a hallelujah Thank you Jesus  
Life feeds on life feeds on life feeds on life feeds on  
This is necessary  
It was daylight when you woke up in your ditch  
You looked up at your sky then  
That made blue be your color You had your knife there with you too  
When you stood up there was goo all over your clothes  
Your hands were sticky  
You wiped them on your grass so now your color was green  
Oh Lord why did everything always have to keep changing like this  
You were already getting nervous again  
Your head hurt and it rang when you stood up  
Your head was almost empty  
It always hurt you when you woke up like this  
You crawled up out of your ditch onto your gravel road and began to walk  
waiting for the rest of your mind to come back to you  
You can see the car parked far down the road and you walked toward it  
If God is our Father you thought then Satan must be our cousin  
Why didnt anyone else understand these important things  
You got to your car and tried all the doors  
They were locked It was a red car and it was new  
There was an expensive leather camera case laying on the seat  
Out across your field you could see two tiny people walking by your woods  
You began to walk towards them  
Now red was your color and of course  
Those little people out there were yours too
