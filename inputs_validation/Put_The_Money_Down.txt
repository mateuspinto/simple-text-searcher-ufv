I got lost in the back streets trying to get here tonight  
The police were asking questions they took me to the wrong place twice  
I even lost my passport and I forgot my name and town  
But now Im here by the water put the money down  
  
Before I walk on the water  
Put the money down down down  
There are bands killing chickens  
My heros getting pushed around round round  
  
I dont know if I trust you as you try to shoot me down  
Before I walk on the water  
Put the money down down down  
Put the money down  
  
It was a beautiful day in Columbus when the fences fell  
But the five loaves and the fishes aint going to be much help  
I got a hungry juggler here who wants to be at the head  
Before he walks the water he wants his bread  
  
Take a glass of that light brown ale and a purple pill  
If the air dont get you too sure as hell the pill will  
Oh mommy mommy please may I go downtown  
  
Hes gonna walk on the water  
Put the money down  
Put it down before I walk on the water  
Put the money down down down  
  
There are bands killing chickens  
My heros getting pushed around round round  
  
I dont know if I trust you as you try to shoot me down  
Im gonna walk on the water  
Put the money down down down down down  
Put the money down  
In a tin cup
