Without a warning you took my heart  
You took it darling tore it apart  
You left me sittin in the dark cryin  
Said your love for me was dyin  
I dont believe it I think you outta turn it up  
Turn on your love light  
turn it on up  
just a little bit  
  
I get a little lonely  
In the middle of the night  
I need your lovin  
Make it all right  
I need your love girl  
Or else I aint all right  
I need your lovin  
Or else I aint all right  
Bring it to me now  
Bring it to me now  
Bring it home darlin  
An turn it on up now  
Just a little bit  
A little bit  
Turn it up a bit
