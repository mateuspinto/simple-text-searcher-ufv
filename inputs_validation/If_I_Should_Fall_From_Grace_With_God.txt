If I should fall from grace with god  
Where no doctor can relieve me  
If Im buried neath the sod  
But the angels wont receive me  
  
Let me go boys  
Let me go boys  
Let me go down in the mud  
Where the rivers all run dry  
  
This land was always ours  
Was the proud land of our fathers  
It belongs to us and them  
Not to any of the others  
  
Let them go boys  
Let them go boys  
Let them go down in the mud  
Where the rivers all run dry  
  
Bury me at sea  
Where no murdered ghost can haunt me  
If I rock upon the waves  
Then no corpse can lie upon me  
  
Its coming up threes boys  
Keeps coming up threes boys  
Let them go down in the mud  
Where the rivers all run dry  
  
If I should fall from grace with god  
Where no doctor can relieve me  
If Im buried neath the sod  
But the angels wont receive me  
  
Let me go boys  
Let me go boys  
Let me go down in the mud  
Where the rivers all run dry
