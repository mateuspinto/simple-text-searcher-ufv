Intonation  
The title As Baile can be translated as away from home  
The song itself is all intonation although you might say the intonation is
based in Irish Gaelic Enya sings or horo moray he u way he u way and
so on The word or is an interjection that could be translated as oh or
oho but the rest of the song is intonation
