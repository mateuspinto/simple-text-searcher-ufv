Shut out and burned by your lies  
Now it is time to make you learn  
Youll learn  
My heart bleeds no longer for your pathetic views  
  
My heart beats on stronger with my own resolution  
Bound down for so goddamn long  
I have seen so many follow you  
I fell victim to your clouded ways  
  
It is my intention to end your reign  
I know so many who would want to see your Burn  
I aim war at you  
I did not give into your hold  
  
I live again alone  
Pass through the sea of ashes kept  
My heart bleeds no longer for your love
