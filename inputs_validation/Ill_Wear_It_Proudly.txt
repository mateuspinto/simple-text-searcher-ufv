I hate these flaming curtains theyre not the color of your hair  
I hate these strip lights theyre not so undoing as your stare  
I hate the buttons on your shirt when all I want to do is tear  
I hate this bloody big bed of mine when youre not here  
  
Chorus  
Well I finally found someone to turn me upside down  
And nail my feet up where my head should be  
If they had a King of Fools then I could wear that crown  
And you can all die laughing because Ill wear it proudly  
  
Well you seem to be shivering dear and the room is awfully warm  
In the white and scarlet billows that subside beyond the storm  
You have this expression dear no words could take its place  
And I wear it like a badge that you put all over my face  
  
Chorus  
  
Ill wear it proudly through the dives and the dance halls  
If youll wear it proudly through the snake pits and catcalls  
Like a fifteen year old kid wears a vampire kiss  
If you dont know what is wrong with me  
Then you dont know what youve missed  
  
We are arms and legs wrapped round more than my memory tonight  
When the bell rang out and the air outside turned blue from fright  
But in shameless moments you made more of me than just a mess  
And a handful of eagerness says What do you suggest  
  
Chorus
