the brightest red sweatshirt I ever seen  
She got an extra large so I wouldnt grow out  
Thats too big for you the other kids would shout  
But we stuck together we didnt quit  
and now the children say What a perfect fit

I like to rest my hands in your kangaroo pouch  
it makes them feel comfy like a big soft couch  
And I dont care if the weathers no good  
I say See you later rain as I pull up my hood  
Remember that long bus trip when I needed a nap  
I used you as a pillow on that Spanish ladys lap

Oh red hooded sweatshirt we been through a lot together like that time I
played in that shirts and skins basketball game and I  
had to take you off and throw you in the corner of the gym I was midway

You were staring as if to say Adam you suck at basketball you dribble like
a damn woman I was so mad I challenged you  
to a game of one on one and you know sweatshirt even though I beat you 11 to
9 deep in my soul I know you missed those  
layups on purpose You let me win and that why Ill forever feel this way
