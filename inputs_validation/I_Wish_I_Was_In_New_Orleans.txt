Well I wish I was in New Orleans I can see it in my dreams  
Arminarm down Burgundy a bottle and my friends and me  
  
Hoist up a few tall cool ones play some pool and listen  
To that tenor saxophone calling me home  
And I can hear the band begin When the Saints Go Marching In  
And by the whiskers on my chin New Orleans Ill be there  
  
Ill drink you under the table be rednosed go for walks  
The old haunts what I wants is red beans and rice  
And wear the dress I like so well and meet me at the old saloon  
Make sure that theres a Dixie moon New Orleans Ill be there  
  
And deal the cards roll the dice if it aint that old Chuck E Weiss  
And Claiborne Avenue me and you Sam Jones and all  
  
And I wish I was in New Orleans cause I can see it in my dreams  
Arminarm down Burgundy a bottle and my friends and me  
New Orleans Ill be there
