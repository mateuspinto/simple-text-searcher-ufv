The rain is here and you my dear are still my friend  
Its true two of us are back as one again  
I was the one who left you  
Always coming back  
I cannot forget you girl  
Now I am up in arms again  
  
The rain is here and you my dear are still my friend  
Its true the two of us are back as one again  
I was the one who left you  
Always coming back  
I cannot forget you girl  
Now I am up in arms again  
  
Together now I dont know how this love could end  
My lonely heart it falls apart for you to mend  
I was the one who left you  
  
Always coming back I cannot forget you girl  
Now I am up in arms again  
I was the one who left you  
  
Always coming back I cannot forget you girl  
Now I am up in arms again  
I was the one who left you  
  
Always coming back I cannot forget you girl  
Now I am up in arms again
