Daisy dead petals that is her name  
Shes in a phone booth phase so  
Underneath the shade of a peppermint tray  
She can turn it out with a heal on she just rides into town  
Knowing what theyll say knowing theyre around the corner  
Got a crack in got a crack in some strange places  
  
Daisy dead petals that is her name  
So maybe she tastes like a hamburger maid well  
These dead petals honey brought me here  
She said these dead petals honey brought me here  
  
Dancing on a dime hearing mother cry  
Maybe shes around the corner  
  
Got a crack in got a crack in some strange places  
On my back with on my back with some dirty dishes  
  
Falling down falling down all over the river  
Falling down falling down falling down  
  
Wish what Im feeling could go on like this forever  
Falling down falling down falling down  
  
And since were down might as well stay  
Might as well fry some eggs  
And wave to the shade of the peppermint tray  
Shes a new friend not a skeleton to ride into town  
Knowing what theyll say knowing she tastes like a hamburger maid but  
  
These dead petals honey brought me here  
She said these dead petals honey brought me here
