The Beatles are dead  
Andy Warhols shit she said Yeah  
Reactor reactor reactor  
Give me a better foot in time  
In luxury in love  
People said he left her for another woman  
But she knew he left her for another car  
A velvet craft  
We slide in shaking in the hole  
Resting beneath the ground  
Between the sun is cracks  
It breaks above our heads  
Holy water hoses the whole school  
White porcelain against my face  
Squatting discreet and shitless concealed
