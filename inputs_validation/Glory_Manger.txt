Lyrics  
They turn way Mary and Josef  
Way from the inn  
They turn way Mary and Josef  
Way from the inn  
They turn way Mary and Josef  
Way from the inn  
Thats what made the glory Manger  
And the Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Wasnt that a bright Bethlehem morning  
All around the glory manger  
There in a stable she born him  
Cold winter night  
There in a stable she born him  
Cold winter night  
And there in a stable she born him  
On a cold winter night  
And sanctified the glory manger  
And the Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Wasnt that a bright Bethlehem morning  
All around the glory manger  
And all his pretty little fingers played in the straw  
All his pretty little fingers played in the straw  
And all his pretty little fingers played in the straw  
Thats what made the glory manger  
And the Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Wasnt that a bright Bethlehem morning  
All around the glory manger
