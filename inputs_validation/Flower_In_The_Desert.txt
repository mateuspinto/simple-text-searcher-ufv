Why  
You always have something nice to say  
And makes me sway  
And why  
Does my heart keep beatin fast  
When you  
Kiss  
Kiss my lips  
When all the sugar has gone  
I dont know how  
But you  
Make everything feels like  
The very first time  
You  
Can make a man like me  
Fallin in love again  
Though loving you is breaking all the rules  
Please  
Tell me what to do  
You are  
  
You are my flower in a desert  
Thats what you are  
Flower in a desert  
Thats what you are  
You brings me joy and happiness  
When Im all alone  
  
Why could you always make me feel the same  
I love your way  
Though I should have known this is just a game we play  
Hey smiling face  
Have you ever really loved a man  
Till you sway or have you just been taking all these things for granted
