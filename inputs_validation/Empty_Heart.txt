A empty heart is like an empty life  
I said a empty heart is like a empty life  
Well it makes you feel like you want to cry  
Like you want to cry  
Like you want to cry  
  
Well youve been my lover for a long long time  
Well youve been my lover for a long long time  
Well you left me all alone and end my time  
I want my lover again  
I want my lover again  
I want my lover again  
I want it back again  
  
Yeah a little stick  
Yeah a little bit darling  
Take it down  
Take it down  
Yeah take it down  
  
Come on back to me baby  
Come on back to me baby  
Come on  
Come on back to me  
And Ill show ya  
Ill show ya  
  
That a empty heart means a empty life  
Yeah an empty heart like a empty life  
Oh it makes you feel like you want to die  
Like you want to die  
Like you want to die  
I want to die
