Welcome tired pilgrim  
Into the circle  
We have been waiting  
Everyones gathered for your arrival  
All the believers  
  
Angels fall all for you heretic  
Demon heart bleed for us  
  
Ive been waiting for you  
Weary preacher man  
You have been expected  
Now we can begin  
Let this hollow day of judgment break  
I have known you father  
And your sacred quest  
Blessed soldier fighting  
You shall never rest  
I have known you but do you know me  
  
Angels fall all for you heretic  
Demon heart bleed for us  
My soul is yours dark master I will fight for you  
Dark master within I will fight for you  
Dark master of sin now my soul is yours  
Dark master my guide I will die for you  
Dark master inside  
  
I cannot see his face  
But I could feel despite  
A presence from the dead  
Abandoned by the light  
His shadow will consume me from within  
This power that I sense  
Been raged behind those eyes  
This justice straddling ghost  
A spirit deep inside  
The body and the soul both frets  
For they are one  
  
Angels fall all for you heretic  
Demon heart bleed for us  
My soul is yours dark master I will fight for you  
Dark master within I will fight for you  
Dark master of sin now my soul is yours  
Dark master my guide I will die for you  
Dark master inside  
Dark master Im in I belong to you  
Dark master within  
  
Heil Heil Heil Heil  
Heil Heil Heil Heil  
  
Dont  
Bother trying to find them  
They will be coming to you  
Fight  
Fight and destroy until you cant take anymore  
Spill  
Hey Spill the blood of rebels  
They are the terror of hell  
Flesh  
Im being dead  
Stopping at nothing to kill  
Saint  
Caught in a moment of weakness  
Ended the greatness of all  
Sold  
Half of my soul  
And now Im still waiting for you  
  
I judge us my eyes see  
I judge and I am just  
For I speak of the beast  
That lives in all of us  
Unwelcome ones your time has come  
  
Lord  
You are my god and my shepherd  
Nothing more shall I want  
War  
Through the abyss  
Into the shadow of death  
  
Fear  
There is no reason to fear now  
While you are with me  
My  
Cup overflows  
Of my enemys blood  
I  
Get in the house of the lord  
Forever amen  
Death  
Follow me  
Oh the wish of my life  
  
I judge us my eyes see  
I judge and I am just  
For I speak of the beast  
That lives in all of us  
Unwelcome one your time has come  
  
Servants of the fallen  
Fight to pave the way  
For the saviors calling  
On this wicked day  
Through a veil of madness  
With a vicious play  
One man rises up  
Standing in the way  
Its time to go dark lord  
  
My soul grows weaker  
He knows and he waits  
He watches over me  
Standing at the inferno gates  
In the hour of darkness  
The moment I feared has passed  
The moment I lost my faith  
Promising salvation  
My soul is my own now  
I do not fight for you dark master
