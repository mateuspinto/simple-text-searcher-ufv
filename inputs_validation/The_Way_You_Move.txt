Then the whole room fell silent  
The girls all pause with glee turning left turning right are they looking at
me  
Cause I was looking at them there there on the dance floor  
Now they got me in the middle feeling like a man whore  
Specially the big girl big girls need love too no discrimination here

So keep your hands off my cheeks and let me study how you ride the beat  
You big freak  
Skinny slim women got the camel toe within them  
You can fuck them lift them bend them give them something to remember  
Yell out timber when they fall through the chop shop  
Take a deep a breath and exhale your ex male friend boyfriend was boring as
hell  
Now let me listen to the stories you tell  
And we can make moves like a person in jail on the loco
