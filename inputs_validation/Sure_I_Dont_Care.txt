I dont care what you say to me Just forget that that we were meant to be
oooooh  
You were never meant for me your jokes were biting me to the bone And the
things we shared I couldnt bare  
Chorus  
Sure I dont care you always get your way I wanna hang up now up now I
thought you were good guy at first but you always turning me down  
Baby Baby just ignore me We have no chemistry no no  
You hurt girls as fast as people blink no one wants to take that ah ah  
Chorus  
Im sorry I have to say this but Goodbye Hahaha
