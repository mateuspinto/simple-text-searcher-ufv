Hello Mr Radio you friendly station  
So glad of your company your morning music  
My wife she ran away she left our home  
And though youre here with me Im on my own  
  
Hello Mr Radio you friendly speaker  
You played my request today request to see her  
Your voice comes riding home across the air  
You travel round the world but still youre here  
  
I heard on the news today the world is no good  
But if she returns today mine could be so good  
I look into the sky your waves rush by  
The weather man has lied it makes me cry  
  
Hello Mr Radio do I disturb you  
Sometimes I forget my place I seem to know you  
I miss you when you close youll never know  
And when your programs go Im on my own
