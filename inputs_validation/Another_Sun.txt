Trouble wont find me  
Sorrow wont call  
Sadness will turn away  
Searching for a new soul  
Hardship wont come by  
All pain will cease  
Somebody will take my place  
And suffer for me  
  
If I never see another sun  
If I never see another sun  
If I never see another sun  
Another sun another sun  
  
If no love will comfort me  
If no kind words come  
To offer hope or peace  
When I have fallen  
If I be a stranger  
Friend of no one  
Ill gladly take my place  
In the world beyond  
  
If I never see another sun  
If I never see another sun  
If I never see another sun  
Another sun another sun  
  
If I lay down and wake to see  
The bright light of the morn  
Rise up every day  
To blind beat and burn  
Show me no mercy  
For need or want  
Let somebody take my place  
When the new day dawns  
  
If I never see another sun  
If I never see another sun  
If I never see another sun  
Another sun another sun
