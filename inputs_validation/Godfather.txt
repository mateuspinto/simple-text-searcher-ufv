Speak softly love and hold me warm against your heart  
I feel your words the tender trembling moment start  
Were in a world our very own  
Sharing a love that only few have ever known  
  
Wine colored days warmed by the sun  
Deep velvet nights when we are one  
  
Speak softly love so no one hears us but the sky  
The vows of love we make will live until we die  
My life is yours and all because  
You came into my world with love so softly love  
  
Wine colored days warmed by the sun  
Deep velvet nights when we are one  
  
Speak softly love so no one hears us but the sky  
The vows of love we make will live until we die  
My life is yours and all because  
You came into my world with love  
So softly love
