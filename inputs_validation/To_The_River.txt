They are master and slave  
We are sunlight and shadow  
All roads to the river  
I am lost I am saved  
Im beloved and betrayed  
All roads to the river  
  
And the river runs wide  
And the river runs deep  
And I spit in the eye  
Of safe company  
When I dive right down  
To the undertow  
Well the deeper I drown  
Lord the higher Ill go  
  
I am whispering dreams  
I am howling revolutions  
All roads to the river  
I am Valentine sweet  
And I live in this nightmare  
All roads to the river  
  
And the river runs wide  
The river runs deep  
And I spit in the eye  
Of safe company  
When I dive right down  
To the undertow  
Well the deeper I drown  
Lord the higher Ill go  
  
This is nothing like we planned  
Thats the way its always been  
All roads to the river  
I have hated and I have loved  
I have prayed and I have sinned  
All roads to the river  
  
And the river runs wide  
The river runs deep  
And I spit in the eye  
Of safe company  
When I dive right down  
To the undertow  
Well the deeper I drown  
Lord the higher Ill go
