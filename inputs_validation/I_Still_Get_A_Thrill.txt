Because I still get a thrill thinking of you  
And I still feel your lips kissing me too  
Although our love affair wasnt to be  
I wonder if you care care about me  
I still remember that night under the moon  
I recall that it all ended too soon  
I cant believe youre gone memories linger on  
cause I still get a thrill thinking of you  
I still remember that night under the moon  
I recall that it all ended too soon  
I cant believe youre gone memories linger on  
cause I still get a thrill thinking of you
