I have never heard this song by Kenny Rogers and as far as I know a man named
Tom Jans wrote it The only person I have ever heard sing this song is Elvis
Presley and these are the lyrics as he sings them  
If you could see me now  
The one who said  
That hed rather roam  
The one who said  
Hed rather be alone  
If you could only see me now  
If I could hold you now  
Just for a moment  
If I could really make you mine  
Just for awhile  
Turn back the hands of time  
If I could only hold you now  
I been too long in the wind  
Too long in the rain  
Takin any comfort that I can  
Looking back and longing for  
The freedom of my chains  
And lying in you loving arms again  
If you could hear me now  
Singing somewhere in the lonely night  
Dreaming of the arms that held me tight  
If I could only hold you now  
Ooh I been too long in the wind  
Too long in the rain  
Takin any comfort that I can  
Looking back and longing for  
The freedom of my chains  
And lying in your loving arms again  
I can almost feel your loving arms again
