No difference here  
Feel no difference here inside  
No difference here  
Feel no difference here inside  
  
If by some chance you say goodbye to me  
Rest assured youll always be loved  
Better loved you never could be  
And if by some chance I say goodbye to you  
Call my bluff Im never that tough  
Thats a thing I never could do  
  
One love in my life is enough for me  
One love in this heart of mine  
One love in my life is enough for me  
One love in this life of mine  
  
Feel no difference here  
Feel no difference here inside  
No difference here  
  
But if some tiny crack should ever start to show  
Never you fear I will always be here  
First man to let you know  
If some tiny difference should rear its head and shine  
Dont you care Ill be there  
First man to call you mine  
  
One love in my life is enough for me  
One love in this heart of mine  
One love in my life is enough for me  
One love in this life of mine  
  
One love in my life is enough for me  
One love in this life of mine  
One love in my life is enough for me  
One love of my life  
  
One love in my life is enough for me  
One love  
One love in this life of mine  
One love  
One love in my life is enough for me  
One love of my life  
One love in this life of mine  
  
One love of my life  
One love of my life  
One love of my life  
  
One love of my life  
One love  
One love  
  
One love in my life is enough for me  
One love  
One love in my life  
One love of my life  
One love in my life is enough for me  
One love one love  
One love of my life  
  
One love in my life is enough for me  
One love in my life  
One love in my life is enough for me  
One life  
One love of my life  
One life  
  
One love in my life is enough for me  
One life  
One love in my life  
One love in my life is enough for me  
One love of my life
