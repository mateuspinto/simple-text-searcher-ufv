Once Im begging you save her little soul  
Golden years gold whop whop whop

Last night they loved you opening doors and pulling some strings angel  
Come get up my baby  
In walked luck and you looked in time

Nothings gonna touch you in these golden years gold  
Golden years gold whop whop whop

Some of these days and it wont be long  
Gonna drive back down where you once belonged  
In the back of a dream car twenty foot long  
Dont cry my sweet dont break my heart  
Doing all right but you gotta get smart  
Wish upon wish upon day upon day I believe oh Lord

Come get up my baby  
  
Theres my baby lost thats all  
Once Im begging you save her little soul  
Golden years gold whop whop whop

Dont let me hear you say lifes taking you nowhere angel  
Come get up my baby  
Run for the shadows run for the shadows  
Run for the shadows in these golden years

Nothings gonna touch you in these golden years gold
