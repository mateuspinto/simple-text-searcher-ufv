Pack up all my cares and woes  
Here I go singing low  
Bye bye blackbird  
Where somebody waits for me  
Sugar is sweet so is she  
Bye bye blackbird  
  
No one here can love and understand me  
Oh what hard luck stories they all hand me  
  
Make my bed and light the light  
Ill arrive late tonight  
Blackbird bye bye  
  
Pack up all my cares and woes  
Here I go singing low  
Bye bye blackbird  
Where somebody waits for me  
Sugar is sweet so is she  
Bye bye bye bye blackbird  
  
I said no one here can love and understand me  
Oh what hard luck stories they all hand me  
  
So make my bed and light the light  
Ill arrive late tonight  
Blackbird bye bye  
Make my bed and light the light  
Ill arrive late tonight  
Blackbird  
I said blackbird  
I said blackbird  
Oh blackbird bye bye
