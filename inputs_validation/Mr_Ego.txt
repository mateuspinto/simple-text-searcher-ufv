Take me down  
To the ground  
Just let me feel it  
If I let someone down  
Please welcome  
Him on the losing side  
I shake you off  
And make my choice  
Dont wanna hear you  
Your slimy voice  
Please go down please  
I dont wanna feel you around me  
  
Take me down to a higher ground  
To survive your mindless sound  
If you know all the people  
Why are you alone  
If you know all the people  
Youll be goin down  
  
I feel that man  
On my back  
Dont promise any crap  
Someone will break your neck  
You dont know how  
To soak my soul  
Let me out  
Let me go  
Open your eyes  
You told nothing but lies  
Please go down please  
Cmon go down with your ego  
  
Take me down to a higher ground  
To survive your mindless sound  
If you know all the people  
Why are you alone  
If you know all the people  
Youll be goin down  
  
Let me go ahead let me go  
  
I will find an explanation  
Wheres my only destination  
Separated ways now and forever  
Is the only and only measure  
Tales full of exaggerations  
No more manipulations  
And I think you are not funny  
Your brain is just a bloated dummy  
  
Take me down to a higher ground  
To survive your mindless sound  
If you know all the people  
Why are you alone  
If you know all the people  
Youll be goin down
