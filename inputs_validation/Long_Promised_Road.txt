So hard to answer futures riddle  
When ahead is seeming so far behind  
So hard to laugh a childlike giggle  
When the tears start to torture my mind  
So hard to shed the life of before  
To let my soul automatically soar  
But I hit hard at the battle thats confronting me yeah  
Knock down all the roaddblocks astumbling me  
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down  
Sew up the wounds of evolution  
And the now starts to get in my way  
So what if lifes a revelation  
If the mind speaks of only today  
So real the pain growing in my soul  
Of climbing up to realitys goal  
But I hit hard at the battle thats confronting me yeah  
Knock down all the roaddblocks astumbling me  
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down  
Long promised road  
Trail starts at dawn  
Carries on to the seasons ending  
Long promised road  
Flows to the source gentle force never ending never ending  
So hard to lift the jeweled sceptre  
When the weight turns a smile to a frown  
So hard to drink of passion nectar  
When the taste of lifes holding me down  
So hard to plant the seed of reform  
To set my sights on defeating the storm  
So I hit hard at the battle thats confronting me yeah  
Knock down all the roaddblocks astumbling me  
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down  
Oh yeaheaheaheah  
Hit hard at the battle thats confronting me yeah  
Knock down all the roaddblocks astumbling me  
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down  
Oh yeaheaheaheah  
Hit hard at the battle thats confronting me yeah  
Knock down all the roaddblocks astumbling me  
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down
