Theres a love I hold dear  
And it shines through each year  
And it makes things seem different somehow  
Its for better or worse  
Its for people who thirst  
For a love that burns brighter right now  
  
And it shines on and on til all sadness is gone  
And if children had wings I would sing them this song  
With a smile on my face and a tear in my eye  
Everything will be fine by and by  
  
There were things that were said  
There were things that were done  
And a wife cannot stand too much pain  
And what I thought was best  
Couldnt please her much less  
But my love still goes on that dont change  
  
And it shines on and on til all sadness is gone  
And if children had wings I would sing them this song  
With a smile on my lips and a tear in my eye  
Everything will be fine by and by  
  
And it shines on and on til all sadness is gone  
And if children had wings I would sing them this song  
With a smile on my face and a tear in my eye  
Everything will be fine by and by  
  
And it shines on and on til all sadness is gone  
And if children had wings I would sing them this song  
With a smile on my face and a tear in my eye  
Everything will be fine by and by
