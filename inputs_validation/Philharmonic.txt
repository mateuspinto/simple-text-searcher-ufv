Sit down and watch me  
I want you to see me  
As your TV  
As your TV  
As your TV  
As your TV  
  
Touched by your static  
You see right  
Right through me  
As your TV  
As your TV  
As your TV  
As your TV  
  
What you hide is what you are  
Have what it takes to be a star  
Come on  
You say theres beauty in a scar  
Now what a stupid thing you are  
Sometimes  
  
After you get what you want  
You dont want it anymore  
Is that what you want  
  
Slow down  
Zoom in  
Rewind  
Do you get the picture  
  
Philharmonic  
Philharmonic  
  
What you hide is what you are  
Have what it takes to be a star  
Come on  
You say theres beauty in a scar  
Now what a stupid thing you are  
Sometimes  
  
Philharmonic  
After you get what you want  
You dont want it anymore  
  
Philharmonic  
  
What you hide is what you are  
Have what it takes to be a star  
Come on  
You say theres beauty in a scar  
Now what a stupid thing you are  
Sometimes  
  
Philharmonic
