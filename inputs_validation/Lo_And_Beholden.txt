I was alone and content in my world  
Dancing on air  
You sent to me a message that said  
I like your style  
Will you come to the temple tonight  
And dance for me there  
I pledge to you all that you wish  
The moon and the stars  
  
Lo and beholden  
Why dont you give it up  
Lo and beholden Come on you know its true  
Lo and beholden  
Oh Im beholden to you  
  
In the palace there was wild reverie  
And the look in your eyes  
As I dropped veil after veil  
Was drunken desire  
The dove calls and God notes it all  
The naked truth  
Here is my veil the seventh and last  
It will cost you  
  
Lo and beholden  
Why dont you give it up  
Lo and beholden  
Come on you know its true  
Lo and beholden  
Oh Im beholden to you  
  
The royal word has passed  
The prophets head is all I ask  
For beauty and the naked truth  
It will cost you  
  
Lo and beholden  
Why dont you give it up  
Lo and beholden  
Come on you know its true  
Lo and beholden  
Oh Im beholden to you
