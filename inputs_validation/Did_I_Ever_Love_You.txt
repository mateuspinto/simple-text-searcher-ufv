Did I ever ever love you  
Did I ever really care  
All the times that I cried for you  
Did I really want you there  
Wiser man then I have wondered  
About love and never knew  
Did I ever love you  
I guess I still do  
  
All the nights that I spent cryin  
All those lonely loss of times  
Was it my imagination  
Was it only in my mind  
Wiser man then I have wondered  
About love and never knew  
Did I ever love you  
I guess I still do
