I need Thee every hour  
Most gracious Lord  
No tender voice like thine  
Can peace afford  
  
I need Thee oh I need Thee  
Every hour I need Thee  
Oh bless me now my Savior  
I come to Thee  
  
I need Thee every hour  
Stay thou nearby  
Temptations lose their poware  
When thou are nigh  
  
I need Thee oh I need Thee  
Every hour I need Thee  
Oh bless me now my Savior  
I come to Thee  
  
I need Thee every hour  
In joy or pain  
Come quickly and abide  
Or life is vain  
  
I need Thee oh I need Thee  
Every hour I need Thee  
Oh bless me now my Savior  
I come to Thee  
  
I need Thee every hour  
Most holy One  
Oh make me thine indeed  
Thou blessed Son  
  
I need Thee oh I need Thee  
Every hour I need Thee  
Oh bless me now my Savior  
I come to Thee
