Strap on that there jammy pac  
Get a grip on your soul  
Sip on that there family flask  
And Ill guide you towards the door  
She dont feed me in the mornin  
And I cant take no more  
So strap on that there jammy pac  
And get up off my floor  
  
Strap on that there jammy pac  
And slide a double dime my way  
Dry off your distributor cap  
And hip me to the game you play  
Shes jonesin for a jammy  
With a girl that I call tammy  
So strap on that there jammy pac  
Its time for you to pay  
  
Strap on that there jammy pac  
She hypnotized one dude  
Stains you like a heart attack  
Van winkle says fuck you  
Never made me no supper  
A boy like me needs it too  
So strap on that there jammy pac  
Its time to pay your due
