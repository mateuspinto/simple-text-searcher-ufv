Living in a world that dies within  
you are they who try and touch the wind  
You could be the blessed one  
that makes me love you  
  
And doing what youve never done before  
taking every wave that hits the shore  
you could be a silver star that shines  
on my blue island  
Its gonna be a blue island  
See you on a blue island  
Take you to a blue island  
  
Blue island  
  
You can see the rain  
You can feel the pain  
that no part of me is going through  
  
Everybody say  
we can find a way  
Do you know the place youre going to  
  
Youre going to a blue island  
  
This is what the lonely heart must know  
This is what it takes to make it grow  
You could be a child alone  
But you may save the world  
  
Maybe its the words that mean goodbye  
There but for the grace of God go I  
I can see an open door that leads to my blue island  
  
Gonna be a blue island  
See you on a blue island  
Take you to a blue island  
  
Blue island  
Blue island  
Blue island
