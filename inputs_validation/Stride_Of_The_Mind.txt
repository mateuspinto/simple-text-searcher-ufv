I took a walk out to the sun But I just just couldnt take it  
I followed a dream It was circular  
But I just just could not fake it  
  
Step to the left the left the left Step to the right the right the right  
Pick up the sign the sign the sign For a stride of the mind the mind  
  
Simon of the desert blew into town On the scalding tail of a bright cold wind  
Slipped through the sand Footprints emerged  
Where no one was walking Simon had been  
  
Dropped from heaven To a ready made world  
Said Im no Sufi But Ill give it a whirl  
We booked passage on the Book of the Dead  
Time to travel Simon said  
  
Step to the left the left the left Step to the right the right the right  
Pick up the sign the sign the sign On the stride of the mind the mind the mind  
  
Come on move where dreams increase Where every man is a masterpiece  
If you want to be counted As another kind  
And youre true pursue Stride of the mind the mind the mind  
  
He bowed three times Removed his fez  
Pointed to heaven And Simon says  
The mind the mind the mind Pick up the sign the mind the mind  
Its a vertical climb the climb the climb Stride of the mind the mind the mind  
Pick up the sign the sign the sign Its a vertical climb the climb  
Take it in stride
