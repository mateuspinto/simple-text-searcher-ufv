Oh yeah alright  
I do believe in you more than myself  
I can depend on you when I need help  
So when I tell you please understand yeah  
That I do love you love you man to man  
Oh yeah alright  
I remember oh so well when the times were bad  
If I needed anything youd give me all you had  
And when the troubles came you were by my side yeah  
You said Use God as your guide my son  
Dont you know hes alive hes alive oh yeah  
But now you have gone and Im on my own  
But I realize one thing one man is never alone  
But I wish that you were here right by my side yeah  
I would love to tell you that I know hes alive  
Hes alive oh yeah alright
