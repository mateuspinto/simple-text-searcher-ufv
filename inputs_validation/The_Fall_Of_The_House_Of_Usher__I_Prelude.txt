I Prelude  
  
Shadows of shadows passing It is now 1831 and as always I am  
absorbed with a delicate thought It is how poetry has indefinite  
sensations to which end music is inessential Since the comprehension  
of sweet sound is our most indefinite conception music when combined  
with a pleasurable idea is poetry Music without the idea is simply music  
Without music or an intriguing idea colour becomes pallor man becomes  
carcase home becomes catacomb and the dead are but for a moment  
motionless
