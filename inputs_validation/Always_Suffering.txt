Lets take a walk  
Just you and me  
And talk of days gone by  
Across the fields  
Under the trees  
Lets speak of you and I  
  
While the whole world  
Was wandering  
We walked a steady line  
When all our friends  
Were wavering  
We kept on trying  
  
Now were always suffering  
Already lost  
Always suffering  
Already lost  
  
Remember when  
On summer days  
I would sing a lovers son  
How you would smile  
Shower me with praise  
And the sun shined on  
  
Now the rain is falling slow  
And the nights grow long  
And the train  
Cries out so hauntingly  
She is gone  
  
Now were always suffering  
Already lost  
Were always suffering  
Already lost  
  
Please take these flowers  
Smell the perfume  
Let your soul come alive  
Let there be hope  
Hope in your heart  
That our love may revive  
  
For life is but a chance  
On a wind swept hill  
And the seeds of love  
Are swirling above  
Let them be still  
  
But were always suffering  
Were already lost  
Always suffering  
Already lost
