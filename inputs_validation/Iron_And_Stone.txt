Made the sinners cry  
He oped up his sky  
The rivers ran with blood  
The deserts name was love  
  
Said who can not be saved  
Soul of a man is much depraved  
Dont act as if you are his clone  
Made of iron and of stone  
  
Justice swept the land  
To raise the mortal made  
And when he overcome  
The war has just begun  
  
As the darkness spreads across his land  
Soul of man who stays his hand  
Forms the basis of his home  
Made of iron and of stone  
  
When it came the time  
To confess his crime  
The people stood and stared  
And didnt even care  
  
And the morning had died  
The millions knew that there was no lie  
Temple was built and the worshiping showed  
Made of iron and of stone
