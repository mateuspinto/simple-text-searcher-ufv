The freakiest show I know  
Is the show of my own  
Living my life in and out  
Of the twilight zone  
  
Bust my britches  
Bless my soul  
Im a freak of nature  
Walking totem pole  
Look and see I think youll agree  
Nobody weird like me  
  
Intercourse with a porpoise  
Is a dream for me  
Hell bent on inventing  
A new species  
  
Bust my britches  
Bless my soul  
Im a freak of nature  
Walking totem pole  
Look and see I think youll agree  
Nobody weird like me  
  
Riding down the path  
On the back of a giraffe  
Me and the giraffe laughed  
Cause I passed some gas  
  
Bust my britches  
Bless my soul  
Im a freak of nature  
Walking totem pole  
Look and see I think youll agree  
Nobody weird like me  
  
Enchanted as a rabbit  
That my life is a dream  
Well everything is never  
Just as it seems  
  
The freakiest show I know  
Is the show of my own  
Living my life in and out  
Of the twilight zone
