Now dear children pay attention  
I am the voice from the pillow  
I have brought you something  
I ripped it from my chest  
With this heart I have the power  
To blackmail the eyelids  
I sing until the day awakes  
A bright light on the heavens  
My heart burns  
They come to you in the night  
Demons ghosts black fairies  
They creep out of the cellar shaft  
And will look under your bedding  
Now dear children pay attention  
I am the voice from the pillow  
I have brought you something  
A bright light on the heavens  
My heart burns  
They come to you in the night  
And steal your small hot tears  
They wait until the moon awakes  
And put them in my cold veins  
Now dear children pay attention  
I am the voice from the pillow  
I sing until the day awakes  
A bright light on the heavens  
My heart burns  
My heart burns
