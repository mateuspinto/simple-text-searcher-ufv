I peek into the hole I struggle for control  
  
The children love the show but they fail to see the anguish in my  
  
eyes  
  
Fail to see the anguish in my eyes  
  
I scratch around the brim I let my mind give in  
  
The crowd begins to grin but they seem to scream when darkness fills  
  
my eyes  
  
Seem to scream when darkness fills my eyes its no surprise  
  
Fail to see the tragic turn it into magic  
  
My big top tricks will always make you happy  
  
But we all know the hat is wearing me  
  
My bag is in the hat its filled with this and that  
  
My visions getting fat the rabbits just a monkey in disguise  
  
Stars and pills and needles dance before our eyes  
  
They will bite the hand if it is slower than the quickness of their  
  
scrutinizing eyes  
  
Fail to see the tragic turn it into magic  
  
My big top tricks will always make you happy  
  
But we all know the hat is wearing me  
  
Chicanery will always make you happy  
  
But we all know the hat is wearing me
