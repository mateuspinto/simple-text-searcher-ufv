Comin out of nowhere  
Drivin like rain  
Stormbringer dance  
On the thunder again  
  
Dark cloud gathering  
Breaking the day  
No point running  
Cause its coming your way  
  
Ride the rainbow  
Crack the sky  
Stormbringer coming  
Time to die  
  
Got to keep running  
Stormbringer coming  
Hes got nothing you need  
Hes gonna make you bleed  
  
Rainbow shaker  
On a stallion twister  
Bareback rider  
On the eye of the sky  
  
Stormbringer coming down  
Meaning to stay  
Thunder and lightning  
Heading your way  
  
Ride the rainbow  
Crack the sky  
Stormbringer coming  
Time to die  
  
Got to keep running  
Stormbringer coming  
Hes got nothing you need  
Hes gonna make you bleed  
  
Coming out of nowhere  
Drivin like arain  
Stormbringer dance  
On the thunder again  
  
Dark cloud gathering  
Breaking the day  
No point running  
Cause its coming your way
