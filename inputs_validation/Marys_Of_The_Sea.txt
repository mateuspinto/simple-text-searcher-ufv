Hey I am not in your way  
Hey no need to push me again  
I know its your day in the sun  
Last time I checked he came to light the lamp for everyone  
  
Relax love he said before he left  
Take those hands away from your eyes  
From where I stand youre in my sky  
  
You must go must flee  
For they will hunt you down  
You and your unborn seed  
In all of Gaul is there safety  
  
Les Saint Marie de la Mer  
You will dance the ring  
Marys of the Sea  
The lost bride weeps  
Les Saint Marie de la Mer  
We will dance your ring  
  
Hey theres a new Jerusalem  
Hey you built on rock thats on sand  
For now you have hijacked the son  
Last time I checked he came to light the lamp for everyone  
  
I hear a voice and it says  
The red of the red rose is its own  
And something no man can divide  
So St Jermaine hear the prayer of this supplicant  
For two scarlet women Black Madonna  
Hey I am not in your way  
Hey no need to push me again  
I know its your day in the sun  
I know its your day in the sun  
Hey I am not in your way  
Hey no need to push me again  
I know its your day in the sun  
Last time I checked he came to light the lamp for everyone
