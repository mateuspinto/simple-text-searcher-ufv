Nobody knows what human life is  
Why we come why we go  
So why then do I know  
I will see you  
I will see you in far off places  
  
The heart knows why I grieve  
And yes one day I will close my eyes forever  
But I will see you  
I will see you in far off places  
  
Its so easy for us to sit together  
But its so hard for our hearts to combine  
And why  
And why  
Why Why Why Why  
  
Destiny for some is to save lives  
But destiny for some is to end lives  
But there is no end  
And I will see you in far off places  
  
If your god bestows protection upon you  
And if the USA doesnt bomb you  
I believe I will see you somewhere safe  
Looking to the camera messing around  
And pulling faces
