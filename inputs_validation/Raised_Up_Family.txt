I was raised up family man  
Im glad Im on my own  
I was raised up family man  
Im glad Im on my own  
I mean God bless the child  
That can learn to live alone yeah  
  
Thinking about my cousin  
What it was that did him in  
Could it have been that whiskey  
Rotgut bootleg bathtub gin  
Its like it took a lot of liquor  
Just to let him live in his own skin  
  
Back in Raleigh North Carolina  
You got to ride it on back  
In Raleigh North Carolina  
  
The ship set down on the shore  
Of this uncharted desert island  
Me and my people fanned out  
I guess we settled down a little while  
Ah but the devil came with the dark days  
Of winter man the children ran wild  
  
I used to know why no I dont know why anymore  
I used to know why no I dont know why no more  
  
I get to wonder at the Kundalini thunder  
Down under my floor  
  
You got to ride it on back  
Take me back  
Back in Raleigh North Carolina yeah  
Do you want to go  
Way back in Raleigh North Carolina
