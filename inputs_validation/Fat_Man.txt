Fat man at the window  
Bet you know why  
Fat man at the window  
Nobody wants to buy  
Fat man fat man fat man  
Nobody wants to know him  
Fat man  
  
Fat man at the mirror  
Dont let it break easy  
Fat man at the mirror  
Got no heart to please  
Fat man fat man fat man  
Nobody wants to know him  
Fat man  
  
Chorus  
Nobody wants to talk to him  
Walk with him be seen with him  
Nobody wants to speak to him  
Be with him look like him  
  
Fat man at the window  
Bet you know why  
Fat man at the window  
Nobody wants to buy  
Fat man fat man fat man  
Nobody wants to know him  
Fat man  
  
Chorus
