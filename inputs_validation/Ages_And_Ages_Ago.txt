I remember when I made you cry  
Ages and ages ago  
Ill never blame you for our last good bye  
Ages and ages ago  
  
Something told me when you walked away  
That my poor heart would miss you so  
And though it happened only yesterday  
It seemed ages and ages ago  
  
Someone came along and took my place  
How wrong I was to let you go  
And though it happened only yesterday  
It seemed ages and ages ago  
  
Something told me when you walked away  
That my poor heart would miss you so  
And though it happened only yesterday  
It seemed ages and ages ago
