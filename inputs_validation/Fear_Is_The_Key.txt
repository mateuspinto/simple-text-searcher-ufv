We live our lives in fever  
In a choking sweat of fear  
In the heat of the night you can  
Feel so much  
In the heat of the night I scream  
Dont touch  
  
I remember a time when we  
Used and abused  
And fought all our battles in vain  
I remember a time we thought that  
Passion was free  
In the heart of the night bodies aflame  
  
We live in fever  
  
I hear your secret heartbeat  
I can hear your silent cries  
The kids have lost their freedom  
And nobody cares till somebody  
Famous dies  
  
I remember a time when we  
Used and abused  
And fought all our battles in vain  
I remember a time we thought that  
Passion was free  
In the heart of the night bodies aflame  
  
Now we live in a world of uncertainty  
Fear is the key to what you want to be  
You dont get a say the majority  
Gets its way  
Youre outnumbered by the bastards  
Till the day you die
