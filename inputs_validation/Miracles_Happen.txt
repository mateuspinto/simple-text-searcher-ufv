Miracles happen  
You know miracles happen  
  
Miracles happen  
You know miracles happen  
  
If we just try  
We can put it back together you and I  
And all the bad is blown away  
I never said goodbye  
  
Is the writing on the wall  
That makes you see  
And its the saviour of my soul  
And what I say that must be heard  
With love in every word  
  
Close your eyes dont let go  
Dont get lost in the falling snow  
Always out of place alone  
With someone youre not sure of  
  
Broken wings dont arrive  
Its a storm but you still survive  
  
Its gonna take a miracle  
  
So I go around believing you  
I say good night stay forever and  
Nobody knows how much  
I pray for you at night  
And miracles happen  
You know miracles happen  
  
And yesterday  
There was nothing in my life worth living for  
You were there and I was born  
The very strength to carry on  
A miracle has come  
  
Hold on tight call my name  
Dont get caught in the midnight rain  
Part of me believes in you  
Youre someone Im not sure of  
  
Dont look down Ill be there  
Like the wind in the cold night air  
I can see a miracle  
  
And through it all we rise and fall  
Tear it apart and stay forever  
And I know where heaven is  
And somewhere in between  
Miracles happen  
You know miracles happen  
  
Red blue black and white  
True light shine on anyone  
Two hearts make it right  
And all that love can change  
  
Close my eyes dont let go  
Ill be lost in the falling snow  
Always out of place alone  
With someone Im not sure of  
  
Dont look down Ill be there  
Like the wind in the cold night air  
I can see a miracle  
  
And through it all we rise and fall  
We tear it apart and stay forever  
And I know where heaven is  
And somewhere in between  
Miracles happen  
  
Hold on tight call my name  
Dont get caught in the midnight rain  
Part of me believes in you  
Youre someone Im not sure of  
  
Dont look down Ill be there  
Like the wind in the cold night air  
I can see a miracle  
  
Close my eyes dont let go  
Ill be lost in the falling snow
