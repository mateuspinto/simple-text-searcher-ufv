Today I walked down the street I use to wander  
Yeah shook my head and made myself a bet  
There was all these things that I dont think I remember  
Hey how lucky can one man get  
I bronzed my shoes and hung from a rearview mirror  
Bronzed admiration in the blind spot of regret  
There was all these things that I dont think I remember  
Hey how lucky can one man get  
Today I walked down the street I use to wander  
Yeah scratched my head and lit my cigarette  
Well there was all these things that I dont think I remember  
Hey how lucky can one man get  
Today I walked down the street I use to wander  
Yeah shook my head and made myself a bet  
There was all these things that I dont think I remember  
Hey how lucky can one man get  
Hey how lucky can one man get  
Hey how lucky can  
One   
Man  
Get
