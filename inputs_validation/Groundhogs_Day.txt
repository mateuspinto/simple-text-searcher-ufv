When I woke up this mornin I felt a pang  
I was hungerin for some apple pie  
Stumble in the bathroom hung my hog a little bit  
Washed the sleep out of my eye  
Oh yeah its gonna be a fine day  
Scratched myself a bit  
Poured me out a bowla corn chex  
Closest thing I could find to apple pie  
Lingerin taste of toothpaste  
Made the milk go down a bit funny  
But you know them chex they do satisfy  
Oh yeah thisll be a fine day  
So after my mornin risenshine and eatnclean  
Had my mind set to hit them streets  
Drizzle from the night left cold puddles out  
Had my black stompboots on my feet  
Its my day  
  
Since I was in kneepants my pop had tried to make me realize  
If I set my mind down to it I could be a big man in the public eye  
So with my big blue collar on  
I set out to find the easy way What an  
Ice cold bath it was when I found you had to pay to play  
To taste the taste its a tease that never would subside  
The taste is strong but soured by my learned eyes  
Well if a woodchuck could chuck wood  
Hed get down on his knees to pray  
This little snappy boy might see  
The light this ground hogs day
