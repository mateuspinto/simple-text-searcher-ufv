This is a public service announcement  
With guitar  
Know your rights all three of them  
  
Number one  
You have the right not to be killed  
Murder is a crime  
Unless it was done by a  
Policeman or aristocrat  
Know your rights  
  
And Number two  
You have the right to food money  
Providing of course you  
Dont mind a little  
Investigation humiliation  
And if you cross your fingers  
Rehabilitation  
  
Know your rights  
These are your rights  
Wang  
  
Know these rights  
  
Number three  
You have the right to free  
Speech as long as youre not  
Dumb enough to actually try it  
  
Know your rights  
These are your rights  
All three of em  
It has been suggested  
In some quarters that this is not enough  
Well  
  
Get off the streets  
Get off the streets  
Run  
You dont have a home to go to  
Smush  
  
Finally then I will read you your rights  
  
You have the right to remain silent  
You are warned that anything you say  
Can and will be taken down  
And used as evidence against you  
  
Listen to this  
Run
