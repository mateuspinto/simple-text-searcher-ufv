Wish I was in the land of cotton  
Theres a man waiting there  
Wholl never be forgotten  
Why did I have to go  
Why did I go away  
  
It was early on one frosty morning  
I left the sleepy town I was born in  
I wrote a letter that said I was going  
And I layed it beside your bed  
  
And now the concrete hurts my feet  
New Yorks too big a city for me  
Back down south from Dixie beside you  
Honey is where I wanna be  
  
Chorus  
And then my cotton gownll come tumblin down  
Ill make ya feel like a hell of a man  
I wanna be held tight in your arms tonight  
In my sweet old Dixie land  
Darling it seems like forever  
Does the Mississippi still run free  
I miss a little bit of Heaven  
And your southern hospitality  
  
These neon lights drive me crazy  
I wanna lay next to you and be lazy  
Where the sweet magnolia blossoms  
In the early morning Georgia air  
  
Tonight it looks like snow  
But this Gray Hounds starting to roll  
I gonna be whistelin Dixie  
All the way back home to you  
  
Chorus x2
