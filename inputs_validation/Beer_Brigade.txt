Wake up in the morining with nothing to do  
Gotta start the day off with a case of brew  
Hit the street at noon with beer stinkin breath  
Go down to the river with a 20 pack of green death  
Liquored up and pissed off on a saturday  
Night if the beer runs out theres gonna have to be a fight  
Scrounging for change just to buy a half rack  
Well I guess it beats smoking crack  
Its quantity not quality that counts  
Its best when its served in mass amounts  
Rather spend the evening getting drunk  
Than getting laid beer brigade  
Falling down shit faced totally drunk  
Stupid dirtyminded fucking river rat punx  
Sitting around sluggin down the malt liqour  
Listening to gg and trying to be sicker  
Drinkin to get drunk who cares about taste  
Pop a pigs eye and pour it in your face  
Drinkin to remember just drinkin too forget  
Drinkin cause we just dont give a shit  
Beer brigade
