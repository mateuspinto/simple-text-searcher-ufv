For you whose eyes were opened wide whilst mine refused to see  
Im sore in need of saving grace Be kind and humor me  
Im lost amidst a sea of wheat  
Where people speak but seldom meet  
And grief and laughter strange but true  
Although they die they seldom cry  
  
An ode by any other name I know might read more sweet  
Perhaps the sun will never shine upon my field of wheat  
But still in closing let me say  
For those too sick too sick to see  
Though nothing shows yes someone knows  
I wish that one was me
