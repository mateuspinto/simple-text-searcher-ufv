My socks and shoes always match  
Is It Luck  
Theres a foot at the end of each of my legs  
Is It Luck  
I can play my bass for you  
Is It Luck  
Some girls like to kiss my face  
Is It Luck Is It Luck  
  
Theres food inside your mouth today  
Is It Luck  
The barber cuts your hair just so  
Is It Luck  
When the taste of sex is on your lips  
Is It Luck Is It Luck Well Ler  
  
These songs always sound so fast  
Is It Luck  
Polyester makes you sweat  
Is It Luck  
If a graham cracker gets you off  
Is It Luck  
Love love  
Is It Luck well Herb  
  
She said she wanted my body and not my mind  
so I showed her my dictionary to show the  
words that I know and from not what I examined  
I can be how loquacious when I set my mind down to it  
  
And she wasnt impressed  
  
no no no no no no no  
no no no no no no no  
no no no no no  
  
She wasnt impressed at all  
She whispered in my ear  
  
She whispered in my ear  
she said You want to get lucky little boy  
  
Oh I smiled  
  
I smiled and I said Is It Luck
