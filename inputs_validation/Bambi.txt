I knew from the start  
That I loved you with all my heart  
But you were untrue  
You had another lover and she looked just like you  
Bambi cant you understand  
Bambi its better with a man  
  
Its so hard to believe  
Maybe its because youre so young  
Or maybe Im just too naive  
Whos to say maybe youre really having fun  
  
Bambi cant you understand  
Bambi its better with a man  
  
All your lovers they look just like you  
But they can only do the things that you do  
Come on baby and take me by the hand  
Im gonna show what its like to be loved by a man  
  
Bambi I know what you need  
Bambi maybe you need to bleed  
  
Yeah
