Silent night holy night  
  
All is calm all is bright  
  
round yon virgin mother and child  
  
Holy infant so tender and mild  
  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
  
  
  
Silent night holy night  
  
Son of god  
  
Oh loves pure light  
  
Radiant beams from thy holy face  
  
With the dawn of redeeming grace  
  
Jesus lord at thy birth  
  
Oh jesus lord at thy birth
