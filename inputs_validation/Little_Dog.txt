Little dog who cant get in  
Moaning at the bed side  
Moaning from each limb  
  
Little dog who cant get in  
Can only cry but  
Can not swim  
  
Pony legs little trot  
Little dog has to wait a lot  
  
The bigger dog has got his spot  
And elbowed him away  
  
Listen to him barking  
Listen to him call  
Little dog dont have much at all  
  
A puny body and a tiny dick  
A little dog can make you sick  
  
If you got the money you can go to the top  
The female dog dont care what you got  
As long as you can raise that  
Little doggie face to a cold hearted pussy  
You could have a taste  
  
A taste of what the big dog got  
A taste of what the big dog got  
The little dog with the one hundred dollar spot  
Can run his tongue over the hot in trot  
Hot in trot  
Run his tongue over the hot in trot  
  
Money can do anything  
Money can do anything  
Money can do anything  
Tell me what you want  
  
My small dog he want what I got  
  
Wants to run his tongue over my hot spot  
  
Pathetic little dog  
  
Pathetic little dog  
The little man follows his nose  
Counts his fingers and his toes  
He still got those  
Pathetic little dog  
Pathetic little dog  
Following his nose  
But it needs my money to buy  
  
Im an up while youre a down  
I am an up while youre a down  
The spring and the will follow me around  
While you sniff your shit in the wind  
Sniff your shit in the wind  
Money can do anything  
Money can do anything  
Tell me what it is you want  
Just tell me what it is you want  
Im an up while youre a down  
The spring and the will follow me around  
  
Tell me what it is you want  
Tell me what it is you want  
  
You sniff your shit in the wind  
Follow me around  
  
Pathetic little dog  
Pathetic little dog  
Pathetic little dog
