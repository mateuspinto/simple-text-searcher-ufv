Keep on locking your doors  
Keep on building your floors  
Keep on just as before  
Pay disasters no mind  
Didnt get you this time  
No prints left at the crime  
  
Our ships come in and its sinking  
  
Of everything thats possible  
In the hearts and minds of man  
Somehow it is the biggest things  
that keep on slipping right through our hands  
  
By thinking were infallible  
Oh we are tempting fate instead  
Ah time we best begin here at the end end  
  
Wanna third second chance  
Put your faith in big hands  
Pay no more than a glance  
All good things come to an end  
This could be good as it gets  
Hows the view from the fence  
  
You think weve been here before  
You are mistaken  
  
Of everything thats possible  
In the hearts and minds of man  
When progress could be plausible  
In reverse we curse ourselves yeah  
  
Oh yeah by thinking were infallible  
Oh we are tempting fate instead uh uh uh  
Time we best begin here at the end end  
  
Of everything thats possible  
In the hearts and minds of man  
Ye yeah somehow it is the biggest things  
That keep on slipping right through our hands  
  
Hey by thinking were infallible  
Oh we are tempting fate instead  
Oh yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah  
Oh yeah  
Yeah  
  
Oh time we best begin  
Here at the end end  
Here at the end end  
  
Keep on locking your doors  
Keep on building your floors  
Keep on just as before
