Using a special code he accessed his mind  
In search of the reason why  
In passion and fashion he began travelin time  
3rd eye 3rd eye 3rd eye  
  
The serpent approves  
Then appears between Adams thighs  
And he tries 2 release upon Eve the nectar  
The injector tries  
He tries he tries he tries  
  
So abduction complete  
All stand on their feet  
Look at one another and cry  
  
What have we done  
Could this be the fun  
On the dotted line 4 which I did sign  
Oh yeah  
  
I resign from the notion  
Cuz yours was the potion  
That Im supposed 2 die 4  
I resign  
  
In selfpity so dark  
This shitty and stark  
Realization is all that will soothe  
  
Ultimately the only one  
That can save you is you  
Your God is inside and 4 that God you will do  
Whatever it takes  
If nothing else is true  
The only one that can save you is you yeah
