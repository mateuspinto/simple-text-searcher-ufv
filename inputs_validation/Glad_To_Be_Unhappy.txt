Look at yourself  
If you had the sense of humor  
You would laugh to beat the band  
  
Look at yourself  
Do you still believe in rumor  
that romance is simply grand  
  
Since you took it right  
on the chin  
you have lost that bright  
toothpaste grin  
  
My mental state is all a jumble  
I sit around and sadly mumble  
  
Fools rush in so here I am  
very glad to be unhappy  
  
Unrequited loves a bore  
and Ive got it pretty bad  
But for someone you adore  
its a pleasure to be sad  
  
Like a straying baby lamb  
with no mammy and no pappy  
Im so unhappy  
but oh so glad
