Oh wont you listen O Lord to my plea for justice  
Cant you hear my cry for help  
Try to heed my honest prayer  
And judge me in my favor  
  
Cause you know my heart  
You have come to me at night  
But its so hard to speak no evil  
In a hole deprived of light  
  
So I pray for you to answer  
And to turn to me and smile  
Shower me with love to save me  
From demons deep inside  
  
Protect me as you would your own eyes  
In the shadows of your wings  
And learn to know the sound that echoes  
When an innocent man sings  
When an innocent man sings  
When he sings  
  
So I lie with all my failures  
Praying to my best friends ghost  
Time to kneel instead of sitting  
And let me do thy bidding  
Wont you let me do thy bidding yeah  
Help me do thy bidding
