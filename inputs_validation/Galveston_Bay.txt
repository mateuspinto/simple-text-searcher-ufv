Fifteen years Le Bing Son  
Fought side by side with the Americans  
In the mountains and deltas of Vietnam  
  
In 75 Saigon fell  
And he left his command  
And brought his family to the promised land  
  
Seabrook Texas and the small towns  
In the Gulf of Mexico  
It was delta country and reminded him of home  
  
He worked as a machinist put his money away  
And bought a shrimp boat with his cousin  
And together they harvested Galveston Bay  
  
In the mornin fore the sun come up  
Hed kiss his sleepin daughter  
Steer out through the channel  
And casts his nets into the water  
  
Billy Sutter fought with Charlie Company  
In the highlands of Quang Tri  
He was wounded in the battle of Chu Lai  
And shipped home in 68  
  
There he married and worked the gulf fishing grounds  
In a boat thatd been his fathers  
In the morning hed kiss his sleeping son  
And cast his nets into the water  
  
Billy sat in front of his TV as the south fell  
And the Communists rolled into Saigon  
He and his friends watched as the refugees came  
Settle on the same streets and worked the coast they grew up on  
  
Soon in the bars around the harbor was talk  
Of America for Americans  
Someone said You want em out you got to burn em out  
And brought in the Texas klan  
  
One humid Texas night there were three shadows on the harbor  
Come to burn the Vietnamese boats into the sea  
In the fires light shots rang out  
Two Texans lay dead on the ground  
Le stood with a pistol in his hand  
  
A jury acquitted him in self defense  
As before the judge he did stand  
But as he walked down the courthouse steps  
Billy said My friend youre a dead man  
  
One late summer night Le stood watch along the waterside  
Billy stood in the shadows  
His Kbar knife in his hand  
And the moon slipped behind the clouds  
  
Le lit a cigarette the bay was as still as glass  
As he walked by Billy stuck his knife into his pocket  
Took a breath and let him pass  
  
In the early darkness Billy rose up  
Went into the kitchen for a drink of water  
Kissed his sleeping wife  
Headed into the channel  
And casts his nets into the water  
  
Of Galveston Bay
