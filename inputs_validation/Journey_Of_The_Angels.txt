Somewhere  
In a winter night  
The angels  
Begin their flight  
Dark skies  
With miles to go  
No footsteps  
To be lost in snow  
  
They fly to you  
Oh newborn king  
They fly to you  
Oh angels sing  
  
One is sorrow  
One is peace  
One will come  
To give you sleep  
One is comfort  
One is grief  
One will take  
The tears you weep  
  
New star  
In a midnight sky  
In heaven  
All the angels fly  
Soft wings so true  
And all things  
They will give to you  
  
Somewhere  
In a winter night  
The angels  
Begin their flight  
  
Tonight  
All sing  
Oh angels  
A newborn king  
Tonight  
All sing  
Oh angels  
A newborn king
