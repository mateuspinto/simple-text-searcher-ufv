I had the right to sublurr because they ache one stick  
I saw five to six million but yo that aint really shit  
It was supposed to be different we were supposed to write out  
But tumach shot his girl then shot himself in the mouth  
Then the steady game form very soon fell apart  
Because when you just doing all the loyalty in your heart  
Slight catch a long hymn on all these niggas  
Forgetting where theyre coming from  
And theyre slowing down wait a minute what were running from  
This what were supposed to do heres where were supposed to be  
I hated MTV for trying to play me like a mockery  
But that dont bother me I just fulfill my fucking contract  
Small price to pay just to take a piece of my back  
My back backfire assassination of my character  
Just demassing me in the America  
My younger sister Erika just adopted a child  
My older brother served fifteen he made it out  
Even though my father loved me I aint seen him for a while  
Had to fight my baby bitch give me my nigga now  
Cause Im running out of time and I need him to understand  
The way a superior man had build a brand  
Niggas talk about my taxes had to pay I consemn  
Im surviving cause the lines ass crooked in the hand  
  
Heartbreak disappointment my mother died when I was nine  
I just wanted to join her  
Now I miss to join her get to California  
I got something for you to do it was like I was annoying  
Resurrected found my purpose I remember being dragged  
Being nervous when I would kick my verses  
I was virtually worthless my whole life was a circus  
I was sleeping with serpents and I thought it is worth it  
Got a call from Paul told me shit isnt working  
Exchange words told me tell me that shit in person  
He probably told him and by the way did he said it  
On a prolijetic twisted made about him  
I see Slim and he said he didnt recognize me  
Was it that or did he let another man to find me  
I dont know but now I gotta get this all behind me  
Follow my calling when I used to follow niggas blindly  
  
I wish I had a better relationship with my uncles  
Blood relatives I could turn to when Im feeling trouble  
And talk about my struggles  
My uncle John Nail he only put me on the phone  
With different females  
And this is such a such nephew tell me whats up  
Aint even ask about your man in Cali growing up  
Fuck I drink it all and I smash the bottle  
Self medicated numb but Im a feel it tomorrow  
It feel like pain and sorrow was like a second skin  
But now that pain was gone I got my second win  
Only the strong live long you better settle in  
Im fighting for ever I will never let the devil win  
1983 thats when my journey begins  
I searched every word for stritting only find it within  
This for me and my kid still trying to live  
Living life to the fullest till I see you again
