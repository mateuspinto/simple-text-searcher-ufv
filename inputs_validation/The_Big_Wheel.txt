Well I was only a kid didnt know enough to be afraid  
Playing the game but not the way the big boys played  
Nothing to lose maybe I had something to trade  
The way the big wheel spins  
  
Well I was only a kid on a holy crusade  
I placed no trust in a faith that was readymade  
Take no chances on paradise delayed  
So I do a slow fade  
  
Playing for time  
Dont want to wait for heaven  
Looking for love  
For an angel to forgive my sins  
Playing with fire  
Chasing something new to believe in  
Looking for love  
The way the big wheel spins  
  
Well I was only a kid cruising around in a trance  
Prisoner of fate victim of circumstance  
I was lined up for glory but the tickets sold out in advance  
The way the big wheel spins  
  
Well I was only a kid gone without a backward glance  
Going for broke going for another chance  
Hoping for heaven hoping for a fine romance  
If I do the right dance  
  
Wheel goes round landing on a twist of faith  
Taking your chances youll have the right answers  
When the final judgment begins  
  
Wheel goes round landing on a leap of fate  
Life redirected in ways unexpected  
Sometimes the odd number wins  
The way the big wheel spins
