Intro  
Now I dont  
I used to love him  
Now I dont  
Now I dont  
  
As I look at what Ive done  
The type of life that Ive lived  
How many things I pray the father will forgive  
One situation involved a young man  
He was the ocean and I was the sand  
He stole my heart like a thief in the night  
Dulled my senses and blurred my sight  
  
1  I used to love him but now I dont  
I used to love him but now I dont  
  
I chose the road of passion and pain  
Sacrificed too much and waited in vain  
Gave up my power ceased being queen  
Addicted to love yeah like the drug of  
Drug of a fiend  
  
Torn and confused wasted and used  
Reached the crossroad which path would I choose  
Stuck and frustrated I waited debated  
For something to happen that just wasnt fated  
Thought what I wanted was something I needed  
When mamma said no then I just should have heeded  
Misled I bled till the poison was gone  
And out of the darkness arrived the sweet dawn  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Father you saved me and showed me that life  
Was much more than being some foolish mans wife  
Showed me that love was respect and devotion  
Greater than planets and deeper than any oceans  
See my soul was weary but now its replenished  
Content because that part of my life is finished oh yeah  
  
I see him sometimes and the look in his eye  
Is one of a man whose lost treasures untold  
But my heart is gold see I took back my soul  
And totally let my creator control  
The life which was his to begin with  
  
Repeat 1 until fade
