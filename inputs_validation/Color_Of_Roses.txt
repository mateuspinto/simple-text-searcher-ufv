I held you close to me  
Once in a distant dream  
Far from the shores of my fear  
I sailed on the ocean where  
All I imagined could happen  
And now you are here  
  
Its so hard to touch  
What is out of our hands  
To know and to trust  
What the heart understands  
  
Only the ones who believe  
Ever see what they dream  
Ever dream what comes true  
  
Life gives us magic and  
Life brings us tragedy  
Everyone suffers some loss  
Still we have faith in it  
Childlike hope  
Theres a reason that outweighs the cost  
  
And gravity throws  
All these rules in our way  
And sometimes the sprit  
Refuses to play  
  
Only the ones who believe  
Ever see what they dream  
Ever dream what comes true  
  
And oh love  
Turn me around in your arms  
And in this dream we share  
Let us not miss one kiss  
  
And add my regrets  
To the tears in the rain  
For thats what the color  
Of roses contain  
  
Only the ones who believe  
Ever see what they dream  
Ever dream  
Ever dream what comes true
