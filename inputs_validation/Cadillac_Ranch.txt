There she sits buddy just gleaming in the sun  
There to greet a working man when his day is done  
Im gonna pack my pa and Im gonna pack my aunt  
Im gonna take them down to the Cadillac Ranch  
  
Eldorado fins whitewalls and skirts  
Drives just like a little bit of heaven here on earth  
So when I die buddy throw my body in the back  
And take me to the junkyard in my Cadillac  
  
Chorus  
  
Cadillac Cadillac  
Long and dark shiny and black  
Open up them engines let em roar  
Tearing up the highway like a big old dinosaur  
  
James Dean in a Mercury 49  
Junior Johnson running in the woods of Caroline  
Even Burt Reynolds in a Black Trans Am  
Are gonna meet me down at the Cadillac Ranch  
  
Cadillac Cadillac  
Long and dark shiny and black  
Open up them engines let em roar  
Tearing up the highway like a big old dinosaur  
  
Hey little girlie in the blue jeans so tight  
Driving all alone in a Colorado night  
Youre my last love baby youre my last chance  
Dont let em take me to the Cadillac Ranch  
  
Cadillac Cadillac  
Long and dark shiny and black  
Open up them engines let em roar  
Tearing up the highway like a big old dinosaur  
  
Cadillac Cadillac  
Long and dark shiny and black  
Open up them engines let em roar  
Tearing up the highway like a big old dinosaur
