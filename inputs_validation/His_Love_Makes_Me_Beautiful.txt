Fanny is now part of the Ziegfeld Follies She tells  
Florenz Ziegfeld she doesnt want to be in the finale  
because she finds the lyrics inappropriate but  
Ziegfeld insists  
Tenor  
For better or for worse Oh Promise Me  
Why does every bride glow ravishingly  
Within the secret heart of every bride  
These are the words repeating repeating  
Repeating inside Bing bong bing bong  
You are the beautiful reflection  
Of his loves affection  
A walking illustration  
Of his adoration  
His love makes you beautiful  
So beautiful  
So beautiful  
You ask your looking glass  
What is it  
Makes you so exquisite  
The answer to your query  
Comes back dearie  
His love makes you beautiful  
So beautiful  
So beautiful  
And woman loved is woman glorified  
Youll make a beautiful  
Beautiful  
Beautiful  
Beautiful bride  
Chorus  
Here comes the bride  
Another beautiful bride  
Ziegfeld presents her  
With justifiable pride  
Fanny enters with a pillow stuffed under her bridal gown  
so that she appears pregnant  
Fanny  
I am the beautiful reflection  
Of my loves affection  
A walking illustration  
Of his adoration  
His love makes me beautiful  
So beautiful  
So beautiful  
Tenor  
And woman loved is woman glorified  
Fanny  
Ill make a beautiful  
Beautiful

Chorus  
You are so beautiful  
You are so beautiful  
You are so beautiful  
Tenor  
Such a beautiful bride
