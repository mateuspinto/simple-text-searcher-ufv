Walking along the beach last night  
Who do you think I spy  
A girl with ebony fire eyes  
Soft and low do she cry  
Now what could be such a source of pain  
I so boldly inquire  
Pointing finger Havana way  
These three words which transpire  
  
She told me that only in Miami  
Is Cuba so far away  
Only in Miami  
My story she goes this way  
Fish may fly through the purple keys  
Golden birds take to air  
I am bound to the earth it seems  
My life can be so unfair  
Only in Miami  
Is Cuba so far away  
Only in Miami  
Is Cuba so far away  
  
Standing on the shoreline waiting  
Everyone anticipating  
I can hear the broken hearted say  
Only in Miami  
Is Cuba so far away  
  
And she cries for her child without a mother  
And she cries for her son without a father  
And she cries for herself without a lover  
Cant face another day  
Chase the blues away  
I thought I heard her mumble as she  
Turned away  
  
Only in Miami  
Is Cuba so far away  
Only in Miami  
Is Cuba so far away  
  
Standing on the shoreline waiting  
Everyone anticipating  
I can hear the broken hearted say  
Only in Miami  
Is Cuba so far away  
Only in Miami  
Is Cuba so far away  
  
Repeat x3  
Only in Miami  
Is Cuba so  
  
Repeat x4  
Only in Miami  
Is Cuba so far away
