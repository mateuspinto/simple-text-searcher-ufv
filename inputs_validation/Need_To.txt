I I am confused fighting myself  
Wanting to give in needing your help  
Skin cold with fear feel it when we touch  
Outside I know you but inside Im fucked  
Can you see it in me skin cold from touch  
Each turn confronted with what I have done  
  
You pull me closer I push you away  
You tell me its okay I cant help but feel the pain  
I hate you  
  
Why are you taken  
I loved you  
I feel so helpless  
Why is it you  
  
Ripping my insides each time I lay with you  
Why do I cry try  
Why do I really fucking need to  
Why  
Fuck you bitch  
Need to fuck  
Slut
