Well every highway that I go down  
Seems to be longer than the last one I knew about oh well  
And every girl that I walk around  
Seems to be more of an illusion than the last one I found oh well  
And this old man in front of me  
Wearin canes and ruby rings is like a tanging explosion when he sings  
With every chance to set himself on fire  
He just ends up doing the same thing  
  
Well each beautiful thing I come across  
Tells me to stop moving and shake this riddle off oh well  
And there was a time when all I wanted  
Was my ice cream colder and a little cream soda oh well oh well  
And a wooden box in an alley full of rocks  
Was all I had to care about oh well oh well oh well  
  
Now my mind is filled with rubber tires and forest fires  
And whether Im a liar and lots of other situations where I dont know what
to do  
At which time God screams to me Theres nothing left for me to tell you  
Nothing left for me to tell you  
Nothing left  
Oh well oh well oh well  
Oh well  
Oh well oh well oh well  
Oh well
