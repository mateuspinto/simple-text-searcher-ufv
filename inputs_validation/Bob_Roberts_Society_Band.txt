Well Youve heard about the alligators sleepin in the shade  
Youve heard heard about the sugar barons screwin up the glades  
Its a melting pot existence  
That is hard to contemplate  
And a never ending battle in the Sunshine State  
  
But far far away from the front page news  
Far far away from the headline blues  
Down a secondary road that severely shows its age  
The forties comes to life on a makeshift stage  
  
Its the Bob Roberts Society Band  
Playing every Sunday at the Orange Grove Stand  
They dont play grunge and they dont play loud  
Its the magic of the music that still draws a crowd  
  
Well the word goes out  
From Melbourne to the Keys  
The faithful get the message  
Like its written on the breeze  
Young folks old folks  
Bout to cut a rug  
Fox Trot Bunny Hop  
Do the Jitterbug  
  
To the Bob Roberts Society Band  
Playing every Sunday at the Orange Grove Stand  
They dont play grunge and they dont play loud  
Its the magic of the music that still draws a crowd  
  
I saw mini vans from Boca  
Buses from Perrine  
There were people speaking Hindu  
In the BarBQue line  
A couple on their honeymoon  
Looked a bit confused  
But the boys in the band put em right in the mood  
They played  
  
A lady dressed in purple started dancing all alone  
Then she sauntered oh so gently to the vacant microphone  
She sounded like shes someone and never missed a beat  
By the time the number ended they were dancin in the street  
  
Theyd died and gone to heaven  
That lively little crowd  
Trombones and saxophones  
Sent em through the clouds  
It could have gone all night  
But the party had to stop  
When they blew the circuit breaker  
In the souvenir shop  
  
Its the Bob Roberts Society Band  
Playing every Sunday at the Orange Grove Stand  
They dont play grunge and they dont play loud  
Its the magic of the music that still draws a crowd  
  
Its the Bob Roberts Society Band  
Playing every Sunday down at the Orange Grove Stand  
They dont play grunge and they dont play loud  
Its the magic of the music that still draws a crowd
