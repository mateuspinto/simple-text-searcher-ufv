My baby jumped up this morning  
N sat on the side of the bed  
He said Im leaving you baby  
And this is just what I said  
I said I cant make you stay if you want to go  
But its high time baby that you should know  
  
One monkey dont stop no show  
One monkey dont stop no show  
So if you still want to go go ahead  
And I mean every word I said  
  
My baby thought I was jivin  
And he went right out the door  
He left me about three in the morning  
I got me a man at four  
Some women cry when their men bleed em  
Dry long and slow  
But I found out somethin a long time ago  
  
One monkey dont stop no show  
One monkey dont stop no show  
So if he gets too big for his pants  
You better spring that new one and give him a chance  
  
I used to be chicken hearted  
Cry when hed walk out the door  
Cause I was just young and stupid  
Ha Aint like that no more  
Cause I had a hard way to go  
But I learned the score  
And Im here to tell you  
  
One monkey dont stop no show  
One monkey dont stop no show  
Let him do anything he choose  
Theres a million men who can fill his shoes  
  
One monkey dont stop no show  
One monkey dont stop no show  
One monkey dont stop no show  
You can tell him I told you so  
  
All right
