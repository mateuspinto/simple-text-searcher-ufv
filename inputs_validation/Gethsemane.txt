Toll no bell for me father  
But let this cup of suffering pass from me  
Send me no shepherd to heal my world  
But the angel the dream foretold  
Prayed more than thrice for you to see  
The wolf of loneliness in me  
Not my own will but yours be done  
  
You wake up wheres the tomb  
Will easter come enter my room  
The lord weeps with me  
But my tears fall for you  
  
Another beauty  
Loved by a beast  
Another tale of infinite dreams  
Your eyes they were my paradise  
Your smile made my sun rise  
  
Forgive me for I dont know what I gain  
Alone in this garden of pain  
Enchantment has but one truth  
I weep to have what I fear to lose  
  
You wake up wheres the tomb  
Will easter come enter my room  
The lord weeps with me  
But my tears fall for you  
  
I knew you never before  
I see you never more  
But the love the pain the hope o beautiful one  
Have made you mine till all my years are done  
  
Without you  
The poetry within me is dead
