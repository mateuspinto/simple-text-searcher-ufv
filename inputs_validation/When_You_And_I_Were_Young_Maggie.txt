I wandered today to the hills Maggie  
To watch the scene below  
The creek and the creaking old mill Maggie  
Where we used to long long ago  
  
The green growth is gone from the hills Maggie  
Where first the daisise spring  
The creaking old mill is still Maggie  
Since you and I were young  
  
Oh they say that Im feeble with age Maggie  
My steps are much slower than then  
My face is a well written page Maggie  
And time all along was the pen  
  
Oh they say we have outlived our time Maggie  
As dated as songs that weve sung  
But to me youre as fair as you were Maggie  
When you and I were young  
  
Oh they say we have outlived our time Maggie  
As dated as songs that weve sung  
But to me youre as fair as you were Maggie  
When you and I were young  
When you and I were young
