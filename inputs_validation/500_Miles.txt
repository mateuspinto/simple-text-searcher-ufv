He walked 300 miles  
Just to bring to bring me bread  
His body like a sculpture  
Almost decorated  
  
And Ill wake him  
As the dawn does  
And well break in  
On the bus  
Saying this was  
Made for us and love  
  
In lovers communion  
For 500 miles  
And in 500 miles  
Will he break bring me again  
In lovers communion  
For 500 miles  
And in 500 miles  
Will we break even break  
  
Step it up  
Grab your phone  
Get your suitcase  
Theres no time to waste  
A big adventure awaits  
  
Sad news France  
Suffered a late snow  
The blooms break through the ice  
In San Francisco  
A guitar man finally confessed  
He loved that actress  
Hearts touched by frost we fought  
In the land of the midnight sun  
I lost myself  
I lost myself  
  
I walk 300 miles  
Just to bring to bring him bread  
In love some gifts are simple  
Of those I am derated  
So I wake him as the dawn does  
And well face what any lovers must  
Blueness pales within a flames lust  
  
In lovers communion  
For 500 miles  
And in 500 miles  
Will he break bring me again  
In lovers communion  
For 500 miles  
And in 500 miles  
Will he break  
Even break  
Will we break even break  
Break even break  
Does love  
Dont we  
  
Make life even  
Break
