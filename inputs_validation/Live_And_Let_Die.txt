When you were young  
And your heart was an open book  
You used to say live and let live  
You know you did  
You know you did  
You know you did  
  
But if this ever changin world  
In which we live in  
Makes you give in and cry  
Say live and let die  
Live and let die  
  
What does it matter to ya  
When ya got a job to do  
Ya got to do it well  
You got to give the other fella hell  
  
You used to say live and let live  
You know you did  
You know you did  
You know you did  
  
But if this ever changin world  
In which we live in  
Makes you give in and cry  
Say live and let die  
Live and let die
