Froggie went acourtin and he did ride a  huh  
Froggie went acourtin and he did ride a  huh  
Froggie went acourtin and he did ride  
Sword and pistol by his side a  huh a  huh fare the well  
  
Well he rode down to Miss Mouses door  
Where he had often been before  
  
He took Miss Mousie on his knee  
Said Miss Mousie will you marry me  
  
Ill have to ask my Uncle Rat  
See what he will say to that  
  
Well Uncle Rat laughed and shook his fat sides  
To think his niece would be a bride  
  
Well Uncle Rat rode off to town  
To buy his niece a wedding gown  
  
Where will the wedding supper be  
Way down yonder in a hollow tree  
  
What will the wedding supper be  
A fried misquito and a roasted flea  
  
First to come in were to little ants  
Fixing around to have a dance  
  
Next to come in was a bumble bee  
Bouncing a fiddle on his knee  
  
Next to come in was a fat sassy lad  
Thinks himself as big as his dad  
  
Thinks himself a man indeed  
Because he chews the tobacco weed  
  
And next to come in was a big tomcat  
He swallowed the frog and the mouse and the rat
