Another night sleepless  
I dont want to feel this  
Nothing can stop this pain  
Trying to get to a time I forget you  
Still tangled in yesterday  
Its so easy for you  
To give nothing for me  
Did you ever feel anything  
I want you to cry over me  
Die over me  
Even for a moment  
Even for a moment  
I want you to hurt over me  
Feel what I feel  
I want you to cry over die over me  
Baby just for one time  
I want your heart broken  
Some sign of emotion  
Wanna to see the tears tumble down  
Show me I meant something  
And that you feel nothing  
But your world crashing to the ground  
Its so easy for you  
To forget about me  
Did I ever mean anything  
I want you to cry over me  
Die over me  
Even for a moment  
Even for a moment  
I want you to hurt over me  
Feel what I feel  
I want you to cry over die over me  
Baby just for one time  
Cry cry cry  
But did you feel something  
Did we mean nothing at all  
I want you to cry over cry over me  
Die over me  
Even for a moment  
Even for a moment  
I want you to hurt over me  
Feel what I feel  
Even for a moment  
Oh why cant you just cry over die over me  
Baby why cant you hurt like I do  
Like I hurt over you  
Cant you cry over die over me  
Baby just for one time  
I want you to cry over die over me  
Baby want you to fall on your knees  
Baby crawl back to me  
Want you to cry over die over me  
Baby just one time  
Cry cry cry
