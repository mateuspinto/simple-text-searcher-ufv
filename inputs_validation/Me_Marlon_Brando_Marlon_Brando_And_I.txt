We live and dream about the future  
Please ask me out I need to powwow now  
So through the annals of our flavored times  
Our heroes and all their fader thoughts  
  
Me Marlon Brando Marlon Brando and I sing  
Lay me down down down down  
Lay me down down down down down  
  
Help me off to sleep  
But take me deep again  
  
We live and dream about our heroes  
I listened closely and I said  
Im not sure where to place myself here friend  
Am I upon the gold rings and stand  
  
The winners write the rulebooks the histories and lullabies  
  
Lay me down down down down  
Lay me down down down down down  
  
Help me off to sleep  
Down down down  
Take me deep again  
Down down down  
I have watched you sing  
Down down down  
I picture glass wings in your head  
Take me down down down  
While golden broads and combines  
Down down down  
Or brasses mixed with lead
