Everytime from the 1st day of December to the 25th The time goes so slow The
excitement takes over the presents and cards Advant calenders prepared to be
opened the special moments ooh  
chorus ooh the count down is always the best as advant calenders are waiting
to lead the way the chocolates for everyone ooh the count down ooh yey yeah
the count down to christmas yeah  
The special moments of the count down the excitement bursting for christmas
day opening presents and the turkey for dinner Children playing all day
pulling crakers dancing under the mistletoe but before that happens there
must be a moment where you wait ooh yeah the count down  
Chorus  
Ooh yeah lets all celebrate when christmas is here lets all perty all night
pull crakers spoon in the christmas pudding unwrapping presents all day
enjoying yourself but first of all you need to go through the count down the
count down count down yeah ooh the special count down Talking oh dont
forget your advant calender
