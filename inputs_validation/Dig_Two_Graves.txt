I promised to on the day we wed  
Til death do us part yeah that was what I said  
But things have changed senses I made that vow  
The love I felt for you is so much deeper now  
So Ive made up my mind  
  
When the family sings sweat bye and bye  
They might as well go on and tell us both goodbye  
Because youve come to be my heart and soul  
The air I breathe or reason theres live in these bones  
So Ive made up my mind girl if its your time  
  
They can dig two graves just carve one stone  
Because without you here I wont last long  
Your loves the blood running through these vines  
So if he calls you home they can dig two graves  
Sure let the good lord one ask me to be that strong  
Because is kills me just to think about you being gone  
  
They can dig two graves just carve one stone  
Because without you here I wont last long  
Your loves the blood running through these vines  
So if he calls you home they can dig two graves  
Tell the lord above no need to wait  
So if he calls you home they can dig two graves
