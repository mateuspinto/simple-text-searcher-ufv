I know Jesus loves me  
In my heart I know its true  
I know Marys little baby  
Came into the world  
Just to save me  
But I dont know about you  
  
My Gods a mighty big God  
My God can shake the world up  
Plagues and famines  
Frogs and locusts  
Walking on water  
Burning bushes  
Rolling the thunder  
And parting the waters too  
  
My God is good in the kitchen  
Make a good meal from bread and fishes  
Feed the hungry pour the wine  
Everybodys welcome to have a good time  
Sit at his table enjoy the food  
  
I know Jesus loves me  
He says I should love you  
My neighbor not his wife  
Dont covet steal kill or lie  
My Gods got a lot of rules  
  
My God made creation  
Six days work one day vacation  
Made a garden  
Filled it with apples  
Adam and Eve walked around natural  
Until they are that one piece of bad fruit  
  
Ive heard that your Gods older  
Buddha Allah Krishna  
Manifest with many faces  
Worshiped the world over in foreign places  
I assume your God must love you  
  
I know Jesus loves me  
And my God is good and great and true  
But if pride goeth before the fall  
I hope someones God will save us all  
Save us all  
And love the sinners too
