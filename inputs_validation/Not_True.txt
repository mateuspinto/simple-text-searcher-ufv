Memories erased not forgotten  
Rewond and recorded over  
Gone so no one will see gone so I can never be  
The same  
  
Waters all over these pages  
Its not true there locked in cages  
I see how but to blind to see why  
Now its gone  
  
Summer wont stop chewing my blanket  
Can you stop the pain from into the night  
  
Waters all over these pages  
Its not true there locked in cages  
I see how but to blind to see why  
Now its gone  
  
The silence just hurts the silence just hurts  
Take it away away away  
Can you stop the pain from into the night  
  
Waters all over these pages  
Its not true there locked in cages  
I see how but to blind to see why  
Now its gone
