And now to the love song Im sure youre familiar with love songs on the
order of hes just my bill my man my joe my max and so on where the girl
who sings them tells you that although the  
She loves is antisocial alcoholic physically repulsive or just plain
unsanitary nevertheless she is his because he is hers or something like
that but as far as I know there has never been  
Pular song from the analogous male point of view that is to say of a man who
finds himself in love with or in this case married to a girl who has nothing
whatsoever to recommend her I have  
Pted to fill this need the song is called shes my girl  
Sharks gotta swim and bats gotta fly  
I gotta love one woman till I die  
To ed or dick or bob  
She may be just a slob  
But to me well  
Shes my girl  
In winter the bedroom is one large ice cube  
And she squeezes the toothpaste from the middle of the tube  
Her hairs in the sink  
Have driven me to drink  
But shes my girl shes my girl shes my girl  
And I love her  
The girl that I lament for  
The girl my moneys spent for  
The girl my back is bent for  
The girl I owe the rent for  
The girl I gave up lent for  
Is the girl that heaven meant for me  
So though for breakfast she makes coffee that tastes like shampoo  
I come home for dinner and get peanut butter stew  
Or if Im in luck  
Its broiled hockey puck  
But oh well what the hell  
Shes my girl  
And I love her
