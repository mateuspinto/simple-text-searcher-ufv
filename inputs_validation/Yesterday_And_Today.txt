Why is there you when there are few people around making me feel good  
Why is there me when air is free some I can see better than I should  
Theres only us simply because thinking of us makes us both happy  
  
I think of you evry way yesterday and today  
I think of things that we do all the way evry day  
  
Stand in the sea sing songs for me sing happily making me feel good  
Watching your eyes feeling your sighs saying goodbyes better than I could  
Theres only us simply because thinking of us makes us both happy  
  
I think of you every way yesterday and today  
I think of nothing but you things we do things we do
