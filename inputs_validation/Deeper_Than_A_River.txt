Some people search a lifetime  
For a love to stand the test of time  
But you dont have to worry  
Youve got someone  
Who will always be right by your side  
  
Oh  
Ive got a love  
Got a love that wont end  
Here in my heart baby  
Ive got a love  
  
Chorus  
So deep deeper than a river  
So high higher than any mountain  
So strong strong enough to last for all time  
This love is running  
So deep deeper than a river  
It goes on and on  
This love is this love is this love is deeper than a river yeah

Just like a tree that stands tall  
Darling Ill stand by you through it all  
Theres nothing gonna stop me from loving you  
I will always be right by your side  
  
Youve got a love got a love for all time  
Here in my arms baby  
Ive got a love got a love than wont die  
Here in my heart baby

Chorus  
So deep deeper than a river  
So high higher than any mountain  
So strong strong enough to last for all time  
This love is running  
So deep deeper than a river  
It goes on and on  
This love is this love is this love is deeper than a river yeah  
  
Like a river needs the sea I need you with me  
Every minute of my life oh yeah  
And like the sunlight needs the sky

Oh Ive got a love  
So deep deeper than a river
