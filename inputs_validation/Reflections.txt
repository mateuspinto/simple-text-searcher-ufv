Through the mirror of my mind  
Time after time  
I see reflections of you and me  
  
Reflections of the way life used to be  
Reflections of the love you took from me  
  
Im all alone now  
No love to shield me  
Trapped in a world thats  
A distorted reality  
  
Happiness you took from me  
And left me alone  
With only memories  
  
Through the mirror of my mind  
Through these tears that Im crying  
Reflects the hurt I cant control  
Cause although youre gone  
I keep holding on  
To the happy times  
Ooh when you were mine  
  
AS I peer out through the window  
Of lost time  
Looking over my yesteryear  
And all this love I gave all in vain  
  
Chorus  
  
all the love All the love Ive wasted  
all those tears All the tears that Ive tasted  
ooh ooh All in vain  
all in vain  till nothing remains  
  
Through the hollow of my tears  
I see a dream thats lost  
From the hurt  
That you have caused  
  
Everywhere I turn  
Seems like everything I see  
Reflects the love that used to be  
In you I put all my faith and trust  
And right before my eyes my world has turned to dust  
  
After all those nights I sat alone and wept  
Just a hand full of promises and all thats left of loving you  
  
Reflections of  
The way life used to be  
Reflections of  
The love you took from me  
In you I put all my faith and trust  
Right before my eyes my world was turned to dust  
Reflections of  fade out
