Who kicked a hole in the sky  
So the heavens would cry over me  
Who stole the soul from the sun  
In a world come undone at the seams  
  
Let there be love  
Let there be love  
  
I hope the weather is calm  
As you sail up your heavenly stream  
Suspended clear in the sky  
Are the words that we sing in our dreams  
  
Let there be love  
Let there be love Repeat x 2  
  
Noel  
  
Come on baby blue  
Shake up your tired eyes  
The world is waiting for you  
May all your dreaming  
Fill the empty sky  
  
But if it makes you happy  
Keep on clapping  
Just remember Ill be by your side  
And if you dont let go  
Its gonna pass you by  
  
Who kicked a hole in the sky  
So the heavens would cry over me  
Who stole the soul from the sun  
In a world come undone at the seams  
  
Let there be love  
Let there be love Repeat x 4  
  
Let there be love
