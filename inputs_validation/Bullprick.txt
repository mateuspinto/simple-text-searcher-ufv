Pounding in my teeth  
Hydraulics on the move  
Kicking in my face  
Savage bucking mule  
  
Pummeling my soul  
100 tons of lead  
Trampled under foot  
Steamrollers on my head  
  
Crushing down caving in my will to live  
Id rather be dead scream insane  
To have the bullprick split their guts  
Make them pay make them bleed  
  
On your backs in your face  
Down your throats up your ass  
Bullprick  
  
Pulverizing flesh broken bones the aftermath  
Cant escape the war the war machine path  
All become one flattening the streets  
Cry for absolution splitting at the seams  
  
Crushing down caving in my will to live  
Id rather be dead scream insane  
To have the bullprick split their guts  
Make them pay make them bleed  
  
On your backs in your face  
Down your throats up your ass  
Bullprick  
  
On your backs in your face  
Down your throats up your ass  
Bullprick
