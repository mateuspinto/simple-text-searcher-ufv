The more I read the papers  
The less I comprehend  
The world with all its capers  
And how it all will end  
Nothing seems to be lasting  
But that isnt our affair  
Weve got something permanent  
I mean in the way we care  
  
Its very clear  
Our love is here to stay  
Not for a year  
But ever and a day  
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know  
May just be passing fancies  
And in time may go  
But oh my dear  
Our love is here to stay  
Together were going a long long way  
In time the Rockies may crumble Gibraltar may tumble  
Theyre only made of clay  
But our love is here to stay
