Play me Old King Cole  
That I may join with you  
All your hearts now seem so far from me  
It hardly seems to matter now  
  
And the nurse will tell you lies  
Of a kingdom beyond the skies  
But I am lost within this halfworld  
It hardly seems to matter now  
  
Play me my song  
Here it comes again  
Play me my song  
Here it comes again  
  
Just a little bit  
Just a little bit more time  
Time left to live out my life  
  
Play me my song  
Here it comes again  
Play me my song  
Here it comes again  
  
Old King Cole was a merry old soul  
And a merry old soul was he  
So he called for his pipe  
And he called for his bowl  
And he called for his fiddlers three  
  
But the clock ticktock  
On the mantlepiece   
And I want and I feel and I know and I touch  
HER WARMTH  
  
Shes a lady shes got time  
Brush back your hair and let me get to know your face  
Shes a lady she is mine  
Brush back your hair and let me get to know your flesh  
  
Ive been waiting here for so long  
And all this time has passed me by  
It doesnt seem to matter now  
You stand there with your fixed expression  
Casting doubt on all I have to say  
Why dont you touch me touch me  
Why dont you touch me touch me  
Touch me now now now now now
