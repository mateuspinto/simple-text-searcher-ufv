Well  
Are you kidding ha ha  
Hey now wait a minute  
  
Hey hey we are the Monkees  
You know we love to please  
A manufactured image  
With no philosophies  
  
We hope you like our story  
Although there isnt one  
That is to say theres many  
That way there is more fun  
  
You told us you like action  
And games of many kinds  
You like to dance we like to sing  
So lets all lose our minds  
  
We know it doesnt matter  
cause what you came to see  
Is what wed love to give you  
And give it one two three  
  
But it may come three two one two  
Or jump from nine to five  
And when you see the end in sight  
The beginning may arrive  
  
For those who look for meanings  
In form as they do fact  
We might tell you one thing  
But wed only take it back  
  
Not back like in a box back  
Not back like in a race  
Not back so we can keep it  
But back in time and space  
  
You say were manufactured  
To that we all agree  
So make your choice and well rejoice  
In never being free  
  
Hey hey we are the Monkees  
Weve said it all before  
The moneys in were made of tin  
Were here to give you more  
  
We want the Monkees  
  
Give me a w  
Give me an a  
Give me an r  
What does it spell
