Theres no time to keep it low  
Ive been deaf now I want noise  
You stay down  
But I wont be quiet  
Ill hammer on until you fight  
  
Loud Love  
Loud Love  
Loud Love  
Loud Love  
  
If youve got some time to kill  
Slow resistance wins the war  
Well I know  
But thats no way to go  
You cant resist the louder pull  
  
Well thats right  
I want something to explode  
Ive been deaf  
Now I want noise
