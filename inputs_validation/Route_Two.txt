She walks through my head   
Oh mountains change my way  
Walking would have been faster  
But mountains got in the way  
Lotta snow today  
Lotta snow today  
And we go here   
Got me tired again  
  
Hey  
Drive two miles an hour down a mountain trail  
Dont go any faster gonna lose my way  
Cant go any faster gonna lose my way  
Right on the mountain snow today  
  
Heeeeeeeey  
Heeeeeeeey  
Again we play  
  
Giddyup giddyup away  
Giddyup giddyup away  
  
Gonna be late if we dont find our way  
Hurry yeah  
Oh hustle  
Oh hustle  
Ohhh away  
Hey
