Weaving a thread round your heart and your soul  
Deceiving your eyes and delaying your goal  
Ships in the night when they pass out of sight  
Deliver their cargo of earthly delights  
  
To the women and children the souls of the dead  
Ive opened their book and no mercy is shed  
You want forgiveness and you want it cheap  
I dont give redemption rewards for the meek  
  
Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame  
There isnt a god to save you if you dont save yourself  
You cant blame a madman if you go insane  
Give me the strength so I carry on  
  
Chorus  
Trapped in the web but I cut the threads  
Show you the gates of tomorrow  
Trapped in the web no mercy is shed  
Show you the gates of tomorrow  
Trapped in the web slaves to the dead  
Show you the gates of tomorrow  
Trapped in the web but I cut the threads  
Show you the gates of tomorrow  
  
Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame  
There isnt a god to save you if you dont save yourself  
You cant blame a madman if you go insane  
Give me the strength so I carry on  
  
Chorus
