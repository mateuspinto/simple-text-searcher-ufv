Well you get down the fiddle  
And you get down the bow  
Kick off your shoes  
And you throw em on the floor  
Dance in the kitchen till the morning light  
Lousianna saturday night  
  
Awaitin in the front yard  
Sittin on a log  
A single shot rifle and a one eyed dog  
Yonder come my kin folk in the moon light  
Lousianna saturday night  
  
Well you get down the fiddle  
And you get down the bow  
Kick off your shoes  
And you throw em on the floor  
Dance in the kitchen till the morning light  
Lousianna saturday night  
  
My brother Bill and my other brother Jack  
Belly fulla beer and a possum in a sack  
Fifteen kids in the front porch light  
Lousianna saturday night  
When the kin folk leave and the kids get fed  
Me and my woman gonna slip off to bed  
Gonna have a little fun when we turn out the light  
Lousianna saturday night  
  
Well you get down the fiddle  
And you get down the bow  
Kick off your shoes  
And you throw em on the floor  
Dance in the kitchen till the morning light  
Lousianna saturday night  
  
Well you get down the fiddle  
And you get down the bow  
Kick off your shoes  
And you throw em on the floor  
Dance in the kitchen till the morning light  
Lousianna saturday night
