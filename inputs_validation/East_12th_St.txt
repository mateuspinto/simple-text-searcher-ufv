And nobody cares  
And nobody cares  
Does anyone care  
If nobody cares  
  
And nobody cares  
And nobody cares  
Does anyone care  
If nobody cares  
  
Jesus filling out paper work now  
At the facility on East 12th St  
Hes not listening to a word now  
Hes in his own world and hes daydreaming  
Hed rather be doing something else now  
Like cigarettes and coffee with the underbelly  
His lifes on the line with anxiety now  
And she had enough  
And he had plenty  
  
Somebody get me out of here  
Anybody get me out of here  
Somebody get me out of here  
Get me the fuck right out of here  
  
So far away  
I dont want to stay  
Get me outta here right now  
  
I just want to be free  
Is there a possibility  
Get me out of here right now  
  
THIS LIFELIKE DREAM AINT FOR ME
