Chorus  
Welcome to  
Welcome to  
Welcome to the song  
  
Hear the words of the syncopated rhythms  
Welcome to the song  
And when it calls you time to move on  
We go  
  
Chorus  
  
Feel the strength of a hundred thousand heartbeats  
Cry welcome to the song  
And as it lifts you time to move on  
We go  
  
Chorus  
  
Drawn from the inside  
Time to move on  
We go  
We go
