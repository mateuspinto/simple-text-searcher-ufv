Her hat is hanging by the door  
The one she bought in Mexico  
It blocked the wind it stopped the rain  
Shed never leave that one  
So she cant be really gone  
  
The shoes she bought on Christmas Eve  
She laughed and said they called her name  
Its like theyre waiting in the hall  
For her to slip them on  
So she cant be really gone  
  
Chorus  
I dont know when shell come back back  
She must intend to come back  
And Ive seen the error of my ways  
Dont waste the tears on me  
What more proof do you need  
Just look around the room  
So much of her remains  
  
Her book is lying on the bed  
The two of hearts to mark her page  
Now who could ever walk away at chapter twenty one  
So she cant be really gone  
  
Just look around this room  
So much of her remains  
  
Her book is lying on the bed  
The two of hearts to mark her page  
Now who could ever walk away with so much left undone  
So she cant be really gone  
No she cant be really gone
