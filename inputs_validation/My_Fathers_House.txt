In my voice in my smile  
In the eyes of my eldest child  
You appear every year in my life  
  
In a dream I have now  
Standing still in my fathers house  
And I try another time to walk away  
  
I learned that music and laughter  
From the child that you hid in your eyes  
And its his song that I sing  
Now who will sing for me  
  
All my life no voice inside  
Has whispered set me free  
All this time has it been you or me  
  
I wait for someone to save me  
Just like you did all your life  
And will I find my home  
But I alone like you
