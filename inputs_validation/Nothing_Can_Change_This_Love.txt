If I go million miles away  
Ill write a letter each and every day now  
Oh honey nothing nothing nothing  
Nothing is ever gonna change this love  
I have for you oh no oh no  
You can make me weep  
Or you can make me moan  
Tell me you just got back darling  
Ill just say Well welcome home now  
For honey nothing nothing in this world  
Could ever stop this love  
Could ever stop this love  
I have for you oh no oh no  
Oh youre the apple of my eye  
My sweet little cherry pie  
Incomprehensible you can be  
My cake and ice cream  
Sugar and spice  
Everything nice  
You can be the  
Girl of my dreams  
If you would only Incomprehensible  
When you get back when you get back  
Ill just say Well welcome home now  
Oh my darling nothing  
Nothing nothing  
Nothing could ever change  
This love I have for you oh no oh no
