Golden forest golden lake  
Sanctuary state of grace  
I will find reason a place to begin  
It will be a good day  
  
Beginning is one place Ive been before  
Watching the sunrise on the silver shores  
Setting me free again leading the way  
It will be a good day  
  
Sometimes I forget how mighty this earth  
Astounding winter skies truth is in birth  
Peace that it brings to me my beautiful eyes  
Be a good day  
  
Make me believe again  
Making me free again  
Making me see again  
  
Golden mountains golden seas  
A thousand reasons singing to me  
Alive to this message realizing it all  
Be a good day  
  
Learning to listen learning to see  
Learning is power making me free  
Free to believe again in my human side  
Giving me good reason  
Giving me good reason  
  
Come tomorrow  
Make me believe again  
Destiny  
Take the river  
Making me free again  
To the sea  
  
Come tomorrow  
Making me see again  
Will be free  
  
Like a river  
Time feels so much closer now  
You are with me so real  
  
We make our own heaven  
Clear through the sky  
The making of reason for you and I  
I sing of each season  
Making us feel  
This will be a good day  
This will be a good day  
  
Come tomorrow  
Make me believe again  
Destiny  
  
Take the river  
Making me free again  
To the sea  
Come tomorrow  
Making me see again  
Destiny  
Like a river to the sea  
  
Make me believe again  
Making me free again  
Come tomorrow  
Making me see again  
Destiny  
  
Take the river  
Making me free again  
To the sea  
  
Come tomorrow  
Making me see again  
Take the river  
Come tomorrow  
Destiny  
Take the river  
To the sea
