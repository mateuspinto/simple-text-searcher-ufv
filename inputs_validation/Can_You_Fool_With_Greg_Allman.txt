Well you can take all of the money that you made and but it in the jar

Well those winter nights and the city lights and the crying of the train  
Everyday is a shade of gray  
Every memorys a fade  
And then ya finally use the sense God gave ya  
To come out of the rain  
Still you cant figure  
Why that man is got to be so cruel  
But ya just cant forget him can you fool  
  
Together  
Oh love is long and love is hard  
Love brings lots of pain  
She was here  
Now shes gone  
Lord bring her back again
