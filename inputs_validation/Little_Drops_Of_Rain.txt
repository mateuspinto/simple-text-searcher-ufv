Little drops of rain  
Little grains of sand  
Make the mighty ocean  
And the pleasant land  
  
Little notes that sing  
Little words that rhyme  
Make the mighty memories  
And the dreams of time  
  
Never let a minute  
Lie there on the shelf  
For there may be in it  
All loves life itself  
  
Little smiles of hope  
Little drops of tears  
Make this thing called love  
Go dancing down the years  
  
Little drops of rain  
Little rays of sun  
Make the hopeful rainbow  
Glow for everyone
