I was never born with the face of a  
movie star  
I was never blessed with an easyload  
along the way  
I have taken the wrong turning  
So many times I cant remember  
But one thing I have for sure  
I can always smile and say  
  
God gave me an angel with a smiling  
face  
God gave me an angel this I know  
My churches are all empty and Im guilty  
every day  
But god gave me an angel anyway  
  
Talk of being good and what became of  
me  
Do I hide my head in shame and turn  
away  
I have taken the wrong turning  
So many times I cant remember  
But one thing I have for sure  
I can always smile and say  
  
But God gave me an angel with a smiling  
face  
God gave me an angel this I know  
My churches are all empty and Im guilty  
every day  
But god gave me an angel anyway
