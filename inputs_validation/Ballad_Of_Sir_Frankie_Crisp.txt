Let it roll across the floor  
Through the hall and out the door  
To the fountain of perpetual mirth  
Let it roll for all its worth  
  
Find me where ye echo lays  
Lose ye bodies in the maze  
See the lord and all the mouths he feeds  
Let it roll among the weeds  
Let it roll  
  
Let it roll down through the caves  
Ye long walks of coole and shades  
Through ye woode here may ye rest awhile  
Handkerchiefs to match your tie  
Let it roll  
  
Let it roll let it roll  
Let it roll let it roll  
  
Fools illusions everywhere  
Joan and molly sweep the stairs  
Eyes that shining full of inner light  
Let it roll into the night  
  
Let it roll let it roll  
Let it roll let it roll  
Let it roll let it roll
