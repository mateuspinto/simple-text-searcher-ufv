Now the courtroom is quiet but who will confess  
Is it true you betrayed us The answer is yes  
Then read me the list of the crimes that are mine  
I will ask for the mercy that you love to decline  
And all the ladies go moist and the judge has no choice  
A singer must die for the lie in his voice  
And I thank you I thank you for doing your duty  
You keepers of truth you guardians of beauty  
Your vision is right my vision is wrong  
Im sorry for smudging the air with my song  
  
Oh the night it is thick my defences are hid  
In the clothes of a woman I would like to forgive  
In the rings of her silk in the hinge of her thighs  
Where I have to go begging in beautys disguise  
Oh goodnight goodnight my night after night  
  
I am so afraid that I listen to you  
Your sun glassed protectors they do that to you  
Its their ways to detain their ways to disgrace  
Their knee in your balls and their fist in your face  
Yes and long live the state by whoever its made  
Sir I didnt see nothing I was just getting home late
