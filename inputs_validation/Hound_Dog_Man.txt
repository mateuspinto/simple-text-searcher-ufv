Hey hound dog man  
Where you been nowwhere you been  
I wish that you were back  
It was too good to ever end  
Once in a while someone like you  
Will give everything for what you wanted to do  
  
Hey hound dog man  
My old friend play it again  
  
You gave the world a whole lot of joy  
Now that aint bad for a country boy  
I just knew you could not lose  
The way you sang rock and roll and blues  
I still think about these things  
And the memory that it brings  
  
Hey hound dog man  
My old friendplay it again  
Hey hound dog man  
My old friendplay it again  
  
Sometimes I think about James Dean  
Sammy Cooke and my teenage queen  
Doo ron de ron de ron  
Marilyn Monroe and hot rod fun  
I still think about these things  
And the memory that it brings  
  
Hey hound dog man  
My old friendplay it again  
Hey hound dog man  
My old friend why did it end  
Hey hound dog man  
My old friend why did it end
