Finished with my woman cause she couldnt help me with my mind  
People think Im insane because I am Frowning all the time  
  
All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy  
Think Ill lose my mind if I dont find something to pacify  
  
Can you help me  
Occupy my brain  
Oh yeah  
  
I need someone to show me the things in life that I cant find  
I cant see the things that make true happiness I must be blind  
  
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry  
Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal  
  
And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state  
I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but its too late
