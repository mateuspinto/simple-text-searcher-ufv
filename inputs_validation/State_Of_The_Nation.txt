You can walk or you can run  
You dont have to be someone  
I went on a summer cruise  
Upon an ocean born to lose  
My brother said that he was dead  
I saw his face and shook my head  
Can you see where we cant be  
Were losing our blood in the sea  
Cause its the state of the nation  
Thats holding our salvation  
Yes its the state of the nation  
Thats holding our salvation  
Oh the state of the nation  
Is causing deprivation  
Oh the state of the nation  
Is causing deprivation  
  
From my home I traveled far  
I drove in my stolen car  
When it broke down I kissed the ground  
Cause I dont kiss when youre around  
I dont find that I have been  
The portrait of an only son  
If thats the case then who could tell  
Where my story had begun  
Cause its the state of the nation  
Thats holding our salvation  
Yes its the state of the nation  
Thats holding our salvation  
Yes the state of the nation  
Thats causing deprivation  
Oh the state of the nation  
Thats causing deprivation  
  
Even now Im all alone  
Behind a wall thats made of stone  
I think about where we have been  
And all the sights that could be seen  
I know it all could be worthwhile  
If only I could force a smile  
Now we turn our backs to the sea  
The shame of a nation well never be  
Cause its the state of the nation  
Thats holding our salvation  
Yes its the state of the nation  
Thats holding our salvation  
Oh the state of the nation  
Is causing deprivation  
Yes the state of the nation  
Is causing deprivation
