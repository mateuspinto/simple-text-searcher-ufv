Hey man I noticed you were  
You were crying  
Ohh shame on you would leave it inside  
Mind open your mind you say no well no will I  
Hey cause yourself all alone  
You will lie down  
Oh put yourself away from all your love  
And you will soon lie down  
Said I can leave it way open eyes  
I go to you see me whine  
See me lie here  
Oh call see me whine call you way down  
The pain has been riddling me oh will I yeah  
Open I will  
I will leave it to destiny to choose which way I go to  
I will leave destiny  
To choose which direction it is that Im gong to  
My face open eye you leave I mean I  
And I will  
And we will leave most men most men lie  
I fear that we will go away most men most men  
Leave us crying
