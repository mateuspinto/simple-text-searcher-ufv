Her face was crystal  
Fair and fine  
Her breath was morning  
Her lips were wine  
Her eyes were laughter  
Her touch divine  
Her face was crystal  
And she was mine  
  
If only she  
Could feel my pain  
But feelin is a burden  
She cant sustain  
So like a summer Thursday  
I cry for rain  
To come and turn  
The ground to green again  
  
If only she  
Could her my songs  
Bout the empty difference  
Tween the rights and wrongs  
Then I know that I  
Could stand alone  
As well as they  
Now that shes gone  
  
Her face was crystal  
Fair and fine  
Her breath was morning  
Her lips were wine  
Her eyes were laughter  
Her touch divine  
Her face was crystal  
And she was mine
