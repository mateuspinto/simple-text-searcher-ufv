O say goodbye to the little girl tree  
O you know that I must say goodbye  
To the little girl tree  
This wall I built around you  
Is made out of stonelies  
O little girl the truth would be  
An axe in thee  
O father look to your daughter  
Brick of grief and stricken morter  
With this ring  
This silver hoop of wire  
I bind your maiden mainstream  
Just to keep you as a child  
O say goodbye to the little girl tree  
O you know that I must say goodbye  
To my little girl tree  
How fast your candy bones  
Reached out for me  
I must say goodbye to your brittle bones  
Crying out for me  
O you know that I must say goodbye  
O goodbye  
Even though you will betray me  
The very minute that I leave  
O say goodbye to the little girl tree  
O Lord you know that I must say goodbye  
To that little girl tree  
I rise up her girlchild lumps and slipping knots  
Into her laden boughs  
And amongst her roping limbs  
Like a swollen neck vein branching  
Into smaller lesser veins  
That must all just sing and say goodbye  
And let her blossom veils fly  
Her velvet gown  
Down down down  
Down down down  
Down down down and goodbye  
For you know that I must say goodbye  
To a rhythm softly tortured  
Of a motion back and forth  
Thats a rhythm sweetly tortured  
O thats the rhythm of the orchard  
And you know that I must say goodbye  
To that little girl tree  
O goodbye  
Yes goodbye  
For you know that I must die  
Down down down  
Down down down  
Down down down and goodbye  
For you know that I must die  
Yes you know that I must die  
Oo you know that I must die
