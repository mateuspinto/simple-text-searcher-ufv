We stood in your room and laughed out loud  
Suddenly the laughter died and we were caught in an eye to eye  
We sat on the floor and did we sit close I could smell your thoughts and
thought do you want to touch a lot like me too scared to say a thing I left
your house and kicked myself I put those  
Ings on a shelf to die I guess Im not a gambling type but think of what the
two of us had lost  
Had lost  
I needed some time to think it out 7eleven parking lot a toothless woman
turned and stopped I gave her a dime and a chesterfield she leaned down and
kissed my cheek I was scared but it fel  
Et  
Felt so sweet  
She asked me if I had a name I told her I was glued up on some chick we sat
and smoked against the wall  
Drank a beer felt the chill of fall  
Of fall  
I took my car and drove it down the hill by your house I drove so fast the
wind it couldnt cool me down so I turned it around and came back up you
were waiting on your step steam showing o  
Youre breath and water in your eyes we pulled each other into one parkas
clinging on the lawn and kissed right there  
Said all my chicks they smoke these things and handed you a chesterfield king
held your hand and watched tv and traced the little lines along your palm  
Your palm  
I took my car and drove it down the hill by your house  
I drove so fast  
The wind it couldnt cool me down so I turned it around  
And came back up  
You were waiting on your step steam showing off your breath  
And water in your eyes  
We pulled each other into one parkas  
Clinging on the lawn and kissed right there  
Right there
