I had a date with a pretty ballerina  
Her hair so brilliant that it hurt my eyes  
I asked her for this dance  
And then she obliged me  
Was I surprised yeah  
Was I surprised  
No not at all  
  
I called her yesterday  
It should have been tomorrow  
I couldnt keep  
The joy that was inside  
I begged for her to tell me  
If she really loved me  
Somewhere a mountain is moving  
Afraid its moving  
Without me  
  
I had a date with a pretty ballerina  
Her hair so brilliant that it hurt my eyes  
I asked her for this dance  
And then she obliged me  
Was I surprised yeah  
Was I surprised no not at all  
  
And when I wake on a dreary Sunday morning  
I open up my eyes to find theres rain  
And something strange within said  
Go ahead and find her  
Just close your eyes yeah  
Just close your eyes and shell be there  
Shell be there
