With just a sleeping bag and an old guitar  
I left the band in New Orleans  
I did some time with the bottle some with the river queens  
I never thought I would meet a girl  
Who could turn my head around  
Till I met that Mississippi Lady in sleepy Gulfport town she was a  
  
Chorus  
Mississippi Lady  
My lovin Gulfport gal  
She taught me how to love  
And she really loved me well  
She took me up to heaven  
Then she brought me down  
That Mississippi Lady Sweet Cordelia Brown  
  
Hot July in Gulfport  
And I was working in the bars  
And she was working on the street  
With the rest of the evening stars  
She said I never met a guy  
Who could turn my head around  
And thats really sayin something  
For Sweet Cordelia Brown  
  
She was a  
  
Chorus  
  
Now Im back in New York City  
Playin in a band  
But my minds on Mississippi  
Is it hard to understand  
I never thought I would meet a girl  
Who could bring me that far down  
Like the girl I met in Gulfport  
Sweet Cordelia Brown  
  
She was a  
  
Chorus  
  
That Mississippi lady Sweet Cordelia Brown
