Would you believe in what I do  
When the things that I make are all for you  
And in a while Ill come to you  
Showing showing why what I think will all come true  
Well Im sure Ill love you all my life  
And in the morning too  
Everything you have is out of sight  
But baby I can see through you  
And in a while Ill come to you  
Showing showing why what I think will all come true  
Would would you believe in what I do  
When the things that I make are all for you
