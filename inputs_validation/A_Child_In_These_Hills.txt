I am a child in these hills  
I am away  
I am alone  
I am a child in these hills  
And looking for water  
And looking for life  
  
Who will show me the river and ask my name  
Is there nobody here wholl do that  
  
Well I have come to these hills  
I will come to the river  
As I choose to be gone from the house of my father  
  
I am a child in these hills  
I am a child  
  
Chased from the gates of the city where no one had touched me  
I am away  
I am alone  
I am a child in these hills  
And looking for water  
And looking for life  
  
Who will show me the river and ask me my name  
Is there nobody here wholl do that  
  
Well I have come to these hills  
I will come to the river  
As I choose to be gone from the house of my father  
  
I am a child in these hills  
I am a child  
I am a child  
I am a child
