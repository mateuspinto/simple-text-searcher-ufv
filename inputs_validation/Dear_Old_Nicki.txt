Maybe you died cause everybody ask me where you at  
I try to channel you in hopes that I could stare you back  
But its like every intersection we just missed each otha  
You got your fans waitin tell me you aint six feet unda  
And tell me that you coming back that you just took a break  
Maybe I blamed you for everything that was my mistake  
In hindsight I loved your rawness and I loved your edge  
Cause it was you who talked me down from jumpin off the ledge  
Your earrings bamboo your long nails too  
Your BMW every time you came through  
You was the braveheart  
You stole Wayne heart  
You never switched it up  
You played the same part  
But I needed to grow  
And I needed to know  
That there were some things inside of me that I need to show  
So I just deaded you  
Left you in all black  
But dear old Nicki  
Please call back  
  
You told me youd come when I needed you  
And you said it so sweetly I believed you  
But Im standing here calling I cant see you  
But I am holding you holding you holding you to that  
  
Yo did I chase the glitz and glamor  
Money fame and power  
Cause if so that will forever go down my lamest hour  
I shoulda kept you with me gettin at them nameless cowards  
There was no match for you couldnt defeat your prowess  
I had to make them changes I hope you understood  
You see for every bad I did a ton of good  
But you was underground and I was mainstream  
I live the life now that we would daydream  
My only wish is you come enjoy it with me  
Get on them conference calls go meet the lawyers with me  
The money came yea tripled and quadrupled it  
But I still miss us when we was on some stupid shit  
But its still fuck the media  
They ridiculed you never believed in ya  
They just deaded you  
Left you in all black  
But dear old Nicki  
Please call back  
  
You told me youd come when I needed you  
And you said it so sweetly I believe you  
But Im standing here calling I cant see you  
But I am holding you holding you holding you to that  
  
And yes Im holdin you holdin you holdin you  
Oh yes Im holdin you holdin you holdin you  
And yes Im holdin you holdin you holdin you  
To that  
  
And yes Im holdin you holdin you holdin you  
Oh yes Im holdin you holdin you holdin you  
And yes Im holdin you holdin you holdin you  
To that
