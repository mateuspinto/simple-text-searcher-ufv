Cover up  
With loving protection  
Guard your love  
In every direction  
  
Chorus  
Dont give up  
For fear of rejection  
Stand your ground and voice an objection  
  
Run away my sister and brother  
Be afraid of love when the lover  
  
Verse 1  
Tries to read the book by the cover  
Wrapped up in the arms of another  
  
Chorus  
Dont give up  
For fear of rejection  
Stand your ground and voice an objection  
  
Cover up prolonging the yearning  
Just ahead the fires are burning VERSE 2  
Swim for shore the tides are now turning  
Love the ones you love with your learning  
  
Chorus  
Dont give up  
For fear of rejection  
Stand your ground and voice an objection  
  
Look ahead the futures depending  
On the brave to now start defending VERSE 3  
Tell the world the message youre sending  
We dont need an unhappy ending  
  
Chorus  
Dont give up  
For fear of rejection  
Stand your ground and voice an objection  
Got to be safe if you want to be free BRIDGE  
To sit in the shade of the family tree  
  
Verse 1  
Tries to read the book by the cover  
Wrapped up in the arms of another  
  
Chorus  
Dont give up  
For fear of rejection  
Stand your ground and voice an objection  
Got to be safe if you want to be free  
To sit in the shade of the family tree
