First theres nothing  
Takes a long time  
Piece by piece  
It comes together  
  
He makes drawings  
Turns them into real things  
Simple paintings  
Of caves long ago  
  
Just like a game  
Always a winner  
But he works hard  
Surprise to himself  
  
A lot of people  
Bent on the future  
Set up the countries  
Closing all the doors  
  
Now he thinks big  
Thinks hes come a long way  
But we all know  
Long long way to go  
  
Barbarian  
Hes lonely  
Hes the only one
