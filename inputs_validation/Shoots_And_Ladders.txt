Ring around the rosies  
Pocket full of posies  
Ashes ashes we all fall down  
Ring around the rosies  
Pocket full of posies  
Ashes ashes we all fall down  
Nursery rhymes are said verses in my head  
Into my childhood theyre spoon fed  
Hidden violence revealed darkness that seems real  
Look at the pages that cause all this evil  
  
One two buckle my shoe  
Three four shut the door  
Five six pick up sticks  
Seven eight lay them straight  
London bridge is falling down falling down falling down  
London bridge is falling down my fair lady  
Nursery rhymes are said verses in my head  
Into my childhood theyre spoon fed  
Hidden violence revealed darkness that seems real  
Look at the pages that cause all this evil

Baa baa black sheep have you any wool

Mary had a little lamb its fleece was white as snow

Yes sir yes sir three bags full white trash crone
