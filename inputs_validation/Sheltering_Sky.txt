Its a long long way from here to there  
Silent shadows over the dateline  
We both stare at the same blue moon  
Under the sheltering sky  
  
Some say love is the rarest word  
Some say truths just a point of contention  
I know we have a love never mentioned  
Under the sheltering sky  
  
Will we wake from an endless dream  
Will our worlds come tumbling around us  
I can hear a silent scream  
Crying in the night  
  
Am I fading in your eyes  
Is my memory clear as the day we met  
For now we must both remain  
Under the sheltering sky  
Under the sheltering sky
