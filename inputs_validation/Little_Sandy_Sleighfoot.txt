His name is Sandy Sleighfoot  
And oh so sad was he  
For though he stood just 4 feet tall  
His feet were 3 feet 3  
He tried to help make Santas toys  
But with his feet so long  
Hed trip and fall and break them all  
Just every thing went wrong  
  
Now little Sandy Sleighfoot  
Dont you feel so blue  
Even with your feet so long  
God has a place for you  
The other kids made fun of him  
They laughed at him with glee  
  
But Sandy Sleighfoot learned one day  
Without skis he could ski
