As I sit in my bboy stance  
With flipflops and socks and sweatpants  
We finna enhance your brain check it out  
Once upon a time not long ago  
When the player from the Pointe didnt have no flow  
A nigga hit me for my tennis shoes walking to the sto  
Caught a nigga slipping but now I lay it to the flo  
Just like carbon cause I got the heat in my rhythm  
Momma nay not never bragging just to stay knot  
Even when I was a younger lad I learned my lesson  
Never talked to strangers in the trap and answered questions  
The Pope and his folks got us under a scope  
But for unknown reasons cause we dont sell dope  
That you distribute we dont contribute to your clandestine  
Activity my soliloquy may be hard for some to swallow  
But so is cod liver oil  
You went behind my back like Bluto when he cut up Olive Oyl  
Two things I hate lies and thieves they make my blood boil  
Boa constricted on my soul that they call  
  
Chorus  
Touched by the wheelz of steel  
Now show me how you feel  
Touched by the wheelz of steel  
Now show me how you feel  
  
It took your momma nine months to make it  
But it only took a nigga thirty minutes to take it  
Cut that kronk clean up I did but I did so not safely  
Dont want no AIDS no claps or no rabies  
Yo we take no shit like stopped up commodes  
Gotta collect call they done locked up my folks  
Low blow hit me in the left ventricle  
We wont be able to ride out till two thousand fo  
But not for long cause we got a better sack to serve  
Trying to take you other people for your rims at the curb  
Fore you swerve and bust ya forehead go head go head  
More head for me while you ride to the beat  
Drop like Tears like For Fears you know  
Shout Shout let it all out just for my peers  
And pupils who feel like its time to unwind  
Like December 31st on nineteenninetynine  
  
Chorus  
  
Okay like this yeah yeah  
One time for my boy doing King shit  
Two times for Legit and it dont quit  
Three times for my folks in the drop top  
Four times OutKast and it dont stop  
One time for my cause doing Queen things  
Dead fresh to the teeth eating chicken wings  
Three times for my guhls in the beauty shop  
Four times OutKast and it dont stop  
  
Chorus
