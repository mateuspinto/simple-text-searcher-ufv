With all the clarity of dream  
The sky so blue the grass so green  
The rank and file and the navy blue  
The deep and strong the straight and true  
  
The blue line they got the given sign  
The belts and boots march forward in time  
The wood and leather the club and shield  
Swept like a wave across the battlefield  
  
Now with all the clarity of dream  
The blood so red the grass so green  
The gleam of spur on chestnut flank  
The cavalry did burst upon the ranks  
  
Oh the iron will and iron hand  
In Englands green and pleasant land  
No music for the shameful scene  
That night they said it had even shocked the queen  
  
Well alas weve seen it all before  
Knights in armor days of yore  
The same old feasance and the same old crimes  
We havent changed since ancient times
