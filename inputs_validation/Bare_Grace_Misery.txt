Sweet boy come in  
I am the dark side of you  
Die for my sins  
Like the One once did  
  
Cinnamon bed  
For your unashamed appetite  
A figurante  
This dance will hurt like hell  
  
Oh bare grace misery  
Just a child without a fairytale am I  
Dark but so lovely  
A Little Match Girl freezing in the snow  
  
Love lying enticing  
Bare grace misery  
Crowning the moment  
Bare grace misery  
  
This is what I am  
Bare grace for the end of days  
Romantic scent  
Spoiled Lucrece lies warm for you  
  
Theres no such priest  
That can pray me to heaven  
When done with me  
Forget if you think I feel ashamed  
  
A wild thing  
Never felt sorry for anything  
Love lying
