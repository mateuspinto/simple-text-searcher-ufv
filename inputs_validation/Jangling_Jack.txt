Jangling Jack  
Goes Yackety Yack  
Visits the home of the brave  
Hails a fat yellow cab  
Jack wanna celebrate  
Jack wanna big drink  
Driver drops him at a bar  
Called the Rinky Dink  
Jack pushes through the door  
And crosses the floor  
Tips his hat to a man  
Grinning in the corner  
Going Do da do Do da do  
Says Im Jangling Jack  
I go Do da do  
I wanna Rinky Dink Special  
I wanna little umbrella too  
Jack flops on his stool  
Sees the grinning man laugh  
So Jack laughs back  
Jack raises his glass  
Says God bless this country  
And everything in it  
The losers and the winners  
The good guys and the sinners  
The grinning man says Buddy  
Its all Yackety Yack  
Whips out a little black pistol  
Shoots a bullet in Jack  
Jangling Jack  
Do Da Do Do Da Do  
Jangling Jack  
How do you Do Da Do  
Jangling Jack Flies off his seat  
Crashes through the door  
Lands in a heap on the street  
Hears his mothers voice  
Going Do do do  
Jack is shouting  
Mummy is that you  
He sees the berserk city  
Sees the dead stacked in piles  
Sees the screaming crowd  
Screams Where am I  
Going Do da do Going Do da do  
Well Jangling Jack  
As a matter of fact  
Crawls through the crowd  
Back into the bar  
Jack crawls to his stool  
Jack drags himself up  
Falls back down on his arse  
In a puddle of blood  
Going Goodbye Mummy  
Goodbye Goodbye  
Jack doubles over  
And he vomits and dies  
Going Do do do Going Do do do
