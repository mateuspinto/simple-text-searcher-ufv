I shot the sheriff but I did not shoot the deputy  
I shot the sheriff but I did not shoot the deputy  
  
All around in my home town  
Theyre trying to track me down  
They say they want to bring me in guilty  
For the killing of a deputy  
For the life of a deputy but I say  
  
I shot the sheriff but I swear it was in selfdefense  
I shot the sheriff and they say it is a capital offense  
  
Sheriff John Brown always hated me  
For what I dont know  
Every time that I plant a seed  
He said Kill it before it grows  
He said Kill it before it grows I say  
  
I shot the sheriff but I swear it was in selfdefense  
I shot the sheriff but I swear it was in selfdefense  
  
Freedom came my way one day  
And I started out of town  
All of a sudden I see sheriff John Brown  
Aiming to shoot me down  
So I shot I shot him down I say  
  
I shot the sheriff but I did not shoot the deputy  
I shot the sheriff but I did not shoot the deputy  
  
Reflexes got the better of me  
And what is to be must be  
Every day the bucket goes to the well  
But one day the bottom will drop out  
Yes one day the bottom will drop out but I say  
  
I shot the sheriff but I did not shoot the deputy oh no  
I shot the sheriff but I did not shoot the deputy oh no
