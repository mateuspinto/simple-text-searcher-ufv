Let me tell you bout my life  
Let me tell you bout my dreams  
Let me tell you bout the thing that happen all is real to me  
Let me tell you of my hope of my need to reach the sky  
Let me take you on an awkward journey let me tell you why  
Let me tell you why  
  
Why should these curses be laid upon me  
I wont be forgiven til I can break free  
What did I do to deserve all this guilt  
Pay for my sins for the sale of my soul  
  
Demons are trapped all inside my head  
My hopes of god reach for heaven from hell  
My sins are many my guilt is too heavy  
The question of knowing of how then what I know  
  
Im able to see things things that I dont wanna see  
The lies of a thousand souls weigh heavy down on me  
  
I know theyre crying for help reaching out  
The burden of them will take me down as well  
The sin of a tohusand souls knocked out in vain  
Reincarnation of me live again  
  
Someone to save me  
Something to save me from myself  
To bring salvation  
To exorcise this hell  
Someone to save me  
Something to save me from myself  
To bring Salvation  
To exorcise this hell  
  
Someone to save me  
Something to save me from my hell  
Our destination away from this nightmare  
Someone to save me  
Something to save me from myself  
To bring salvation  
To exorcise this hell
