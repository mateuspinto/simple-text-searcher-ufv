Ingonyama nengw enamabala  
Ingonyama nengw enamabala  
  
Night and the spirit of life calling  
Oh oh iyo mamela  
And the voice with the fear of a child answers  
Iyo iyo mamela  
  
Wait theres no mountain too great  
Hear these words and have faith  
Oh oh iyo  
Have faith  
  
Hela hey mamela hela hey mamela  
Hela hey mamela hela hey mamela  
  
He lives in you he lives in me  
He watches over everything we see  
Into the waters into the truth  
In your reflection he lives in you  
  
Dream and the voice in the wind whispers  
Iyo mamela  
  
Wait theres no mountain too great  
Hear these words and have faith oh oh iyo  
  
He lives in you he lives in me  
He watches over everything we see  
Into the waters into the truth  
In your reflection he lives in you  
  
Ingonyama nengw enamabala  
Ingonyama nengw enamabala  
  
He lives in you he lives in me  
He watches over everything we see  
Into the water into the truth  
In your reflection he lives in you  
  
He lives in you oh yeah he lives in me  
He watches over everything we see  
Into the water into the truth  
In your reflection he lives he lives he lives he lives in you  
He lives he lives he lives in you  
He watches over everything we see
