LATE IN THE EVENING  
WRITER PAUL SIMON  
The first thing I remember I was lying in my bed I couldnt of been no more
Than one or two I remember theres a radio Comin from the room next door And
my mother laughed The way some ladies do When its late in the evening And the
musics seeping through The next thing I remember I am walking down the street
Im feeling all right Im with my boys Im with my troops yeah And down along
the avenue Some guys were shooting pool And I heard the sound Of a cappella
groups yeah Singing late in the evening And all the girls out on the stoops
yeah Then I learned to play some lead guitar I was underage in this funky bar
And I stepped outside to smoke myself a J And when I came back to the room
Everybody just seemed to move And I turned my amp up loud and I began to play
And it was late in the evening And I blew that room away The first thing I
remember When you came into my life I said Im gonna get that girl No matter
what I do Well I guess Id been in love before And once or twice I been on the
floor But I never loved no one The way that I loved you And it was late in the
evening And all the music seeping through
