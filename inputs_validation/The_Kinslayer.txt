For whom the gun tolls  
For whom the prey weeps  
Bow before a war  
Call it religion  
  
Some wounds never heal  
Some tears never will  
Dry for the unkind  
Cry for mankind  
  
Even the dead cry  
Their only comfort  
Kill your friend I dont care  
Orchid kids blinded stare  
  
Need to understand  
No need to forgive  
No truth no sense left to be followed  
  
Facing this unbearable fear  
like meeting an old friend  
  
Time to die poor mates  
You made me what I am  
  
In this world of a million religions  
everyone prays the same way  
  
Your praying is in vain  
Itll all be over soon  
  
Father help me save me a place by your side  
  
There is no God Our creed is but for ourselves  
Not a hero unless you die Our species eat the wounded ones  
  
Drunk with the blood of your victims  
I do feel your pitywanting pain  
Lust for fame a deadly game  
  
Run away with your impeccable kin  
  
Good wombs hath borne bad sons  
  
Cursing God why  
Falling for every lie  
Survivors guilt  
In us forevermore  
  
Fifteen candles  
Redeemers of this world  
Dwell in hypocrisy  
How were we supposed to know  
  
Four pink ones  
Nine blue ones  
Two black ones
