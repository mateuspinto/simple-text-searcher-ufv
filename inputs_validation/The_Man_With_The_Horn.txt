They come from miles around just to hear him play  
Hes on the same street corner almost every day  
And theres always a crowd wherever he goes  
And when he blows his horn well everybody knows  
  
I only wanna see him play  
All the girls n boys they wanna see him play  
Nobody else they wanna see him play  
And he brings a tear to the eye  
Hell make you smile of make you cry  
And nobody asks him why  
Cos they just wanna see him play  
  
They come from every way every night  
Hes got a band so out there its outta sight  
And the boys in the dancehall are rocking in the aisle  
The girls up front  they wanna see him smile
