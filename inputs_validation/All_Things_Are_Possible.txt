Almighty God my Redeemer  
My Hiding Place my Safe Refuge  
No other name like Jesus  
No power can stand against You  
  
My feet are planted on this Rock  
And I will not be shaken  
My hope it comes from You alone  
My Lord and my salvation  
  
Chorus  
  
Your praise is al  ways on my lips  
Your word is living in my heart  
And I will praise You with a new song  
My soul will bless You Lord  
You fill my life with greater joy  
Yes I delight myself in You  
And I will praise You with a new song  
My soul will bless You Lord  
  
Bridge  
  
When Im weak  
You make me strong  
When Im poor I know Im rich  
For in the power of Your name  
All things are possible  
All things are possible  
All things are possible  
All things are possible
