We fly higher then at first we imagined  
We came over for the spin of a globe  
Spanning rivers as the fish eggs were hatching  
 pulse of the   
Come visit our world  
See what goes down  
Explore new horizons  
Fall to the ground  
how does it feel X6  
How do you feel  
  
Tired busses on an abandoned old highway  
Taking kissesof a gun  
Broken bottles on the top of the stairway  
Monuments of those we love most  
how does it feel X6  
How do you feel X2  
how does it feelX3  
Unclear about fade
