Let the tempest and the flood  
Shake your soul and spill your blood  
Like an old song  
Keep holdn on  
Let the people laugh at you  
Call you names and say youre through  
Never let go  
Keep hangin on  
  
Hang on hang on  
Can you hear me  
Im gonna say it again  
Hang on hang on  
Never giving up no never giving in  
  
Hang on every hopeful word  
Even when it seems absurd  
Keep holdin on  
If you triumph when you fail  
Keep your head when you prevail  
Be a hero  
Keep hangin around  
  
Hang on hang on  
Are you listening  
Let me say it again  
Hang on hang on  
Never giving up no  
Never giving in
