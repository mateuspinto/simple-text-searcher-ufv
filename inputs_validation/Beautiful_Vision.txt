Beautiful vision  
Stay with me all of the time  
Beautiful vision  
Stay ever on my mind with your beautiful  
  
Mystical rapture  
I am in ecstasy  
Beautiful vision  
Dont ever separate me from your beautiful  
  
In the darkest night  
You are shining bright  
You are my guiding light  
You show me wrong from right  
  
Beautiful vision  
Stay ever on my mind  
Beautiful vision  
Stay with me all of the time with your beautiful vision  
  
In the darkest night  
I said you are shining bright  
You are my guiding light  
Show me wrong from right  
  
Beautiful vision  
Stay with me all of the time  
Beautiful vision  
Stay ever on my mind with your beautiful vision  
I can make it  
I can make it  
With your beautiful vision
