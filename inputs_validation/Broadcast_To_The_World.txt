Brace yourself kid for the final collapse  
Cause the world is spinning fast  
Coming off its axis  
Fight to survive ode lay essay  
And the kids with the guns shout  
Out of my way  
Sex and violence are here to stay  
Broadcast to the world  
Out of control  
Ready to fold  
Broadcast to the world  
Out of control  
I want to have it all and I want it right now  
I want to have it all and I want it now  
  
Chorus  
So here we go reload  
Another round implode  
Were spinning now until our heads explode  
And so I guess we know how far we all can go  
Were on a mission to destroy the world we know  
  
The saints and the sinners  
Have identity crises  
That spread like a virus  
Multiplies and lysis  
Down to the bottom  
Looted graves they turn  
Eat the razorblade apple  
Open a can of worms  
Narcotics on the weekends  
As the city it burns  
  
Broadcast to the world  
Out of control  
Broadcast to the world  
Ready to fold  
Broadcast to the world  
Out of control  
I want to have it all and I want it right now  
I want to have it all and I want it now  
  
Chorus  
  
You know we all are to blame  
Broadcast to the world  
Final collapse is on  
Heaven and Hell collided  
  
Broadcast to the world  
Final collapse is on  
We stand divided  
  
Chorus
