People who are sad  sometimes they wear a frown  
And people who are kings  sometimes they wear a crown  
But all the people who dont fit  
Get the only fun they get  
From people puttin people down  
People puttin people down  
  
People without love  sometimes build a fence around  
The garden up above  that makes the whole world go round  
But all the people who dont fit  
Get the only fun they get  
From people puttin people down  
People puttin people down  
  
So cold sometimes it gets so cold  
  
You may love your wife  you may lose your family  
You may lose you mind  just to keep your sanity  
But the people who dont fit  
Get the only fun they get  
From people puttin people down  
People puttin people down  
  
People that are glad  sometimes they wear a smile  
And people without dreams they walk the extra mile  
But all the people who dont fit  
Get the only fun they get  
From people puttin people down  
People puttin people dwn  
From people puttin people down  
People puttin people down  
  
So cold sometimes it gets so cold
