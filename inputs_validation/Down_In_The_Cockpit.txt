Man acting like a farmer and  
Hes treated the woman like a poor cow  
We got to treat you better from now  
But man is just a baby and  
Hes needing your milk of kindness  
I vow to drink as much as you will allow  
  
All the way through history  
Man machine no mystery  
All the way through history  
Girl have the brain to act like the weaker sex  
  
Down in the cockpit  
Man need the woman to pull him right out of it  
Down in the cockpit  
Man need the woman to pull him right out of it  
  
Queen wants the castle  
Back from the rascal  
Queen wants the castle  
  
The girl tribe are growing up and  
Filling the world full with a new soul  
To get so far they payed a high toll  
Try not to make  
The same mistakes  
As man has done or youll fall in that hole  
And you will see us changing our role  
  
All the way through history  
Man machine no mystery  
All the way through history  
Girl have the brain to act like the weaker sex  
  
Down in the cockpit  
Man need the woman to pull him right out of it  
Down in the cockpit  
Man need the woman to pull him right out of it  
  
Queen wants the castle  
Back from the rascal  
Queen wants the castle
