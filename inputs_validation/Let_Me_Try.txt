You say love is just a lie  
And it always ends with a sad goodbye  
It makes you hurt  
It makes you cry  
But I say wait  
Let me try  
Let me lay my hands on upon your heart  
And see if they can heal  
Those secrets scars of loneliness  
That you cannot conceal  
I will wipe away the saddest tear  
That falls from your blue eyes  
My love can heal the hurt you feel  
Let me try  
You say you know how it would end  
That youll wake up alone again  
But love thats true wonst say goodbye  
And if youll only  
Let me try  
Let me lay my hands upon your heart  
And pray that they can heal  
Those secret scars of loneliness  
That you cannot conceal  
I will wipe away the saddest tear  
That falls from your blue eyes  
My love can heal the hurt you feel  
Let me try  
O love heal the hurt you feel  
Let me try
