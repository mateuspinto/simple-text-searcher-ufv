Perry  
You know you are a boys best friend  
Your more than just a passing trend  
Your like a tree from a candy store  
Oh Perry  
We love you more than ice cream cakes  
We love you more than bugs and snakes  
We love you more than all things mentioned from before  
Oh Perry  
Your extraordinary  
Your kinda short and hairy  
The color of a blueberry  
Yes Perry  
So come home Perry  
Come home perry  
Come home  
  
Oh Perry  
I think its kinda scary  
I cant find you any werey  
It fills me with despair  
Oh Perry  
Im allergic to dairy  
Im gonna move to the Prairies  
And change my name to Larry  
  
She change her name to Larry  
So come home Perry  
Come home Perry  
Come Home  
So come home Perry  
Come home Perry  
Come home  
  
Come home Perry  
Come home
