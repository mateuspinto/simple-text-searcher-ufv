If theyd ever have told me that Id find true love in every way  
Would I cry til tomorrow Would I keep the nonbelievers away  
  
Remember that late night last September when you held me in your arms so
tight  
I was feeling kind of low my heart was blue I was empty til you came  
  
But oh what a Saturday night  
Things were going right  
As right as theyd ever been  
I know that you love me  
  
If theyd ever have told me that Id find true love in every way  
Would I cry til tomorrow Would I keep the nonbelievers away  
Was I shy Was I good With this foolish heart  
Did I try to deny we would fall apart  
  
Like a knight in shining armor you came over to save me what a bolt out of
the blue  
Just one look into those eyes you had me fallen completely head over heels in
love with you  
  
But oh what a Saturday night  
Things were going right  
As right as theyd ever been  
I know that you love me  
  
If theyd ever have told me that Id find true love in every way  
Would I cry til tomorrow Would I keep the nonbelievers away  
Was I shy Was I good With this foolish heart  
Did I try to deny we would fall apart  
  
And you saw me I was falling head over heels in love with you  
  
Saturday night  
Things were going right  
As right as theyd ever been  
I know that you love me  
  
If theyd ever have told me that Id find true love in every way  
Would I cry til tomorrow Would I keep the nonbelievers away  
Was I shy Was I good With this foolish heart  
Did I try to deny we would fall apart  
If theyd ever have told me that Id find true love in every way  
Would I cry til tomorrow Would I keep the nonbelievers away  
Was I shy Was I good With this foolish heart  
Did I try to deny we would fall  
Did I try to deny we would fall a  
Did I try to deny we would fall apart
