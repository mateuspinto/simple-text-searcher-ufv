I saw the news this morning  
And saw your face across the screen  
And as I poured my coffee  
I picked up a magazine  
  
Chorus  
But as I turned the page  
And looked inside  
There you were again there you were  
Oh these lonely times  
They never seem to end  
Youre too far  
I know I should be there where you are  
  
Today I did some shopping  
Just had to clear my mind again  
I cant stop thinkin bout you  
I hopped into a taxi  
In a moment I was home  
Home again  
  
Chorus  
  
Tossing and turning in my sleep  
I cant take being without you  
Im gonna catch the next plane out  
I got to get to where you are  
No matter how near or far  
I got to get there where you are  
I know  
  
Chorus  
  
I want to be where you are  
I need to be where you are  
I want to be I want to be baby  
You know I need to be  
I know I should be there where you are
