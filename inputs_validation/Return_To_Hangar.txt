Welcome to an empty fortress  
A mighty wreck that once was proud  
Ate alive by oxidation  
Abandoned by a crew of cowards  
Navigation systems failed  
Computers crashed and they all fall down  
  
Possibly Ive seen too much  
Hangar 18 I know too much  
  
All the guilty paid the price  
Suspended by their broken necks  
No one survived to tell the story  
When foreign life forms resurrect  
And military intelligence is  
Still two words that cant make sense  
  
Possibly Ive seen too much  
Hangar 18 I know too much
