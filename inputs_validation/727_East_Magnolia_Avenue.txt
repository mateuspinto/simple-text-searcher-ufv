You wont believe where I was today  
Something made my car go a different way  
Before I knew it  
I was back in time at our old address  
  
Sitting in the drive  
And I could see you in my football jersey raking leaves  
I could see me hanging lights on our first Christmas tree  
I could see us nail those numbers on the door that afternoon  
  
At 727 East Magnolia Avenue  
They added on where we thought we would  
You always said it would sure look good  
They cut down that tree we were afraid would fall  
  
Looks like they picked up right where we left off  
I could see you out there on the deck soaking up the sun  
I could see me chasing you around with a water gun  
I could see us there together  
  
Seemed the sky was always blue  
At 727 East Magnolia Avenue  
If I could make one wish  
Oh Id relive my life with you  
At 727 East Magnolia Avenue
