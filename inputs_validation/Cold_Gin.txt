Whoo alright  
My heaters broke and Im so tired  
I need some fuel to build a fire  
The girl next door her lights are out yeah  
The landlords gone Im down and out  
  
Ooh its cold gin time again  
You know itll always win  
Cold gin time again  
You know its the only thing  
That keeps us together ow  
  
Its time to leave and get another quart  
Around the corner at the liquor store  
Haha the cheapest stuff is all I need  
To get me back on my feet again  
  
Ooh its cold gin time again  
You know itll always win  
Its cold gin time again  
You know its the only thing  
That keeps us together ow  
  
Whoa yeah  
Ooh its cold gin time again  
You know itll always win  
Its cold gin time again  
You know its the only thing  
That keeps us together ow
