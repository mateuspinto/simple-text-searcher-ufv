Mama used to say to me you can make your destiny  
Keep your feet planted on the ground  
You can always get it back make a castle from a one room shack  
Its all of what you make of what youve found  
Son youre gonna find out when youre older  
Theres always been the hand of God restin right there on your shoulder  
Will it be Hell or Heaven on earth the choice is up to you  
Look to the sky the answer is clear  
Are you gonna live life for all its worth  
Choose Hell or Heaven on earth  
If you live it right theres nothing to fear  
Cause youll find Heaven right here  
Saw a man the other day had it made in every way  
Till his greed brought him down  
He was blinded by the city lights now he shivers in the cold tonight  
Who will save the lifeguard when hes about to drown  
Will it be Hell or Heaven on earth the choice is up to you  
Look to the sky the answer is clear  
Are you gonna live life for all its worth  
Choose Hell or Heaven on earth  
If you live it right theres nothing to fear  
Cause youll find Heaven right here  
You know youre gonna walk through fire  
You know your gonna feel the pain  
Youre gonna lose if you want to win the game  
And every time your heart is breakin  
And every time your faith is shaken  
Remember what mama said that day  
Hope when my time has come  
Ive left enough to build upon  
Aint no one gonna say I didnt try  
Heres why  
Hell or Heaven on earth the choice is up to you  
Look to the sky the answer is clear  
Are you gonna live life for all its worth  
Choose Hell or Heaven on earth  
If you live it right theres nothing to fear  
Cause youll find Heaven right here  
Youll find Heaven right here  
Youll find Heaven right here Heaven right here
