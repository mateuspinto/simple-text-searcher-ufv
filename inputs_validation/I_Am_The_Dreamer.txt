A kiss in the dark a touch of your hand  
My arms are around you my dream begins  
The only thing thats different than any other night  
Here we are together my dream by my side  
  
I am the dreamer you are the dream  
You are the answer to my fantasy  
All that I have dreamed of now is complete  
I am the dreamer you are the dream  
  
I know now that Ive been dreamin  
I finally saw the light  
With my arms wide open  
I found the love thats right  
  
You dont have to wake me  
For me to know its real  
The love that I have dreamed of  
I can touch and feel  
  
I am the dreamer you are the dream  
You are the answer to my fantasy  
All that I have dreamed of now is complete  
I am the dreamer you are the dream  
  
I am the dreamer you are the dream  
You are the answer to my fantasy  
All that I have dreamed of now is complete  
I am the dreamer you are the dream
