Renegades and shifting shades  
And the lights in your face  
And you friends talk lying  
But some of them got flowers in their room  
  
When its on and youre falling on every floor  
That youre hoping to score  
And youre every night     
But some of them got flowers in their room  
  
But some of them got flowers in their room  
But some of them got flowers in their room  
  
Hear the word that the man on the stairs  
Knows your every affair and is holding your hand  
And he says some of them got flowers in their room  
And he screams in a face  
But the smile on the face is cool and its cold  
And it reads vacated  
And some of them got flowers in their room  
  
And some of them got flowers in their room  
And some of them got flowers in their room  
  
And I take someone home and I cant be alone  
And theres faces to please and I walk on the knees  
Oh you see I got no flowers in my room  
  
And I laugh with my mouth and I laugh with you  
But the joke was a joke that I never really knew  
Some of them got flowers in their room  
  
Some of them got flowers in their room  
Some of them got flowers in their room
