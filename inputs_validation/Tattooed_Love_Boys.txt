The mid twenty joys around a heart thats black and blue  
Tattooed love boys  
I tore my knees up getting to you  
Cause I needed  
To find out what the thing was for  
Been reading  
But man the time came to explore  
  
I went apewire cause I thought  
Like Id like it little tease  
But I didnt mean it  
But you mess with the goods doll honey you gotta pay yeah  
  
A good time was guaranteed for one and all  
The tattoos did target practice in the hall  
While waiting for their number to get called out  
I I I I found out what the wait was about  
  
I was a good time yeah I got pretty good  
At changing tires upstairs bro  
I shot my mouth off and you showed me what that hole was for  
  
Now I see you  
All impressed and half undressed  
You got paint stick all over the scars and lumps and bumps  
Tattooed love boys  
Have got you where I used to lay  
Well ha ha too bad but you know what they say  
Stop snivellin youre gonna make some plastic surgeon a rich man  
  
Oh but the prestige and the glory  
Another human interest story  
You are that
