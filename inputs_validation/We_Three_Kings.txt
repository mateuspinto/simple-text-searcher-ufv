We three kings of orient are bearing gifts we traverse afar  
Field and fountain moor and mountain following yonder star  
  
Oh star of wonder star of night star with royal beauty bright  
Westward leading still proceeding  
Guide with thy perfect light  
  
Born a King on Bethlehems plain  
Gold I bring to crown him again  
King for ever ceasing never over us all to reign   
  
Frankincense to offer have I incense owns a Deity nigh  
Prayare and praising all men raising  
Worship him God most high oh  
  
Myrrh is mine its bitter perfume breathes a life of  
gathering gloom  
Sorrowing sighing bleeding dying sealed in the stone cold tomb  
  
all Glorious now behold him arise king and God and sacrifice  
Alleluia alleluia heaven to earth replies
