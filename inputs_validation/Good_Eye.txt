Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho  
  
I was standing by the river  
Where the cold black water runs  
I was standing by the river  
Where the cold black water runs  
I had my good eye to the dark  
And my blind eye to the sun  
  
I had all of the riches  
I had each and every one  
I had all of the riches  
I had each and every one  
I had my good eye to the dark  
And my blind eye to the sun  
  
Well I swore you were my darling  
Yeah you were the only one  
Since I swore you were my darling  
You were the only one  
Had my good eye to the dark  
And my blind eye to the sun  
  
Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho
