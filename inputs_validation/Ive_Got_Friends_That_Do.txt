This is for the nobody  
The one in the crowd  
Whos got a  
Lost look on his face  
  
This is for the downtrodden  
The one that the worlds forgotten  
Waiting on a better day  
  
Well Im in no  
Position to judge em  
Heaven knows  
Theyre just like me  
  
And im not alone  
In knowing what its like  
To wonder where your going  
In this crazy real  
  
And im not alone  
In knowing how it feels  
To pray to god  
And sometimes wonder if hes real  
Cause Ive got friends that do  
  
Yeah Ive got friends that do  
  
This is for the lost junkie  
Who spends all his hard earned money  
On something that he hates  
  
And this is for the found guilty  
Who aint getting out  
Until he pays his debt to the state  
  
Well Im in no  
Position to judge em  
Heaven knows  
Theyre just like me  
  
And I may not know  
What its like  
To lose your job  
Cause a habits got you gripped too tight  
  
And I may not know  
How it feels  
To lay your head down on a prison bed in a world of steel  
But Ive got friends that do  
  
Yeah Ive got friends that do  
  
This is for yours truly  
Just a little verse to remind me  
Weve all got somewhere to turn  
  
And I may not know  
What its like  
To send my only son  
To save the world  
And watch him die  
  
And I may not know  
How it feels  
To hang there on the cross  
To prove that love is real  
But Ive got friends that do  
  
Yeah Ive got friends that do  
  
Yeah Ive got friends that do  
  
You know we all got friends that do
