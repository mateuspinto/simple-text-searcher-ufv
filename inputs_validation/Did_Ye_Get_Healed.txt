I want to know did you get the feelin  
Did you get it down in your soul  
I want to know did you get the feelin  
And did the feelin grow  
  
Sometimes when the spirit moves me  
I can do many wondrous things  
I want to know when the spirit moves you  
Did ye get healed  
  
I begin to realize  
It manifest in my life  
In oh so many ways  
Every day I want to talk about it  
And walk about it  
Everyday I want to be closer  
  
I want to know did you get the feelin  
Did you get it down in your soul  
I want to know did you get the feelin  
Did ye get healed  
  
I begin to realize  
Magic in my life  
See it manifest in oh so many ways  
Every day is gettin better and better  
I want to be daily walking close  
  
It gets stronger when you get the feelin  
When you get it down in your soul  
And it makes you feel good  
And it makes you feel whole  
  
When the spirit moves you  
And it fills you through and through  
Every morning and at the break of day  
Did ye get healed
