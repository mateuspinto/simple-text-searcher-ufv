Verse Bas  
They putting prices on heads silver or lead  
I pray the scores settle fore the devil notice you dead  
Got me smoking the potent my eyes open and Otis they red  
Thoughts of my eye roam and words that I hoped I had said  
That aunty sippin on we missin ya  
Even tho you gone your thought alone can lift us up  
This is us  
Got some niggas that never call me unless they need something  
But I pick up like whassup what you need cousin  
My niggas know that I love em  
Give em roses while they can smell em  
Cause aint no tellin wholl be here tomorrow  
Used to borrow your digital scale  
Flippin them sales  
But now its digital dash while youre still in the past  
Boy trust me when I tell you the picture got much bigger  
The swishers and dutch fill up  
Bitches in lust with us  
Momma would dissapprove losing my way  
Lost in the sauce this bolognese is so amazing  
Had a talk and she remark you so engaging  
Running game its all the same  
Im growing jaded  
Had a couple things in common like Lonnie Lynn  
But Im too faded for conversatin  
Im sittin here contemplatin

Verse 2 J Cole  
Yeah  
Cousin in jail again asking me for bail again  
Close when I was 12 but I was much frailer then  
He was like 16 a nigga from the gutter and  
Years ago his favorite uncle had married my mother and  
Here we are runnin through the Ville like dumb and dumber and  
For that summer man I swear I wish you was my brother then  
Well time passed and we fell off cause you moved back home  
Little did you know Jermaine done grew a new back bone  
Niggas thought he wouldnt make it till he proved that wrong  
12 years later on the radio that Who Dat song  
Your homeboy bumps the Warm Up now he buggin  
Cause he looking at the cover and say Damn yo thats my cousin  
And niggas looking at you like you lying but you wasnt  
Next thing I know you blowing up my line all a sudden  
And Im showing love saying yo look what I did  
Aint nobody coming from here ever did this shit this big  
But now you saying Yo enough about you  
Shit what about me nigga what about me  
Oh you forgot about me  
Saying niggas showed you how to rap now you dont know how to act  
Boy Im at the bottom you could pull a nigga out of that  
Put me in a video yo put me on your hottest track  
Bring me on the road with you you know cuz got yo back  
And Im strapped up if them niggas act up  
I see you headed to the top you need to let me catch up  
Please let me catch up  
Wont you let me catch up man  
Ill see you when I see you  
Harsh as it seems to say I wouldnt want to be you  
Bail you out for your daughter and I pray to God  
A nigga never pull your card or she wont ever get to see you
