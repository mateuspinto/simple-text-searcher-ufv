I live a life  
I feel the pain  
To sing this song  
To tell the tale  
I wish I never even heard the song  
I see the world  
It makes me puke  
But then I look at you and know  
That somewhere theres a someone who can soothe me  
  
To me you are a work of art  
And I would give you my heart  
Thats if I had one  
  
I see the world  
It makes me puke  
But then I look at you and know  
That somewhere theres a someone who can soothe me  
  
To me you are a work of art  
And I would give you my heart  
Thats if I had one had one  
  
To me you are a work of art  
And I would give you my heart  
Thats if I had one
