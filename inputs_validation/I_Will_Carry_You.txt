Sometimes I wonder if my beating heart has a reason  
The thought of breathing only takes my breath away  
Ive spent so many nights wrestling with this feeling  
Do I have the strength to make it through the day  
But I was never meant  
To walk this road alone  
I can always trust you  
When you say  
  
I will carry you  
Be your strength  
And pull you through  
Reach for me  
And take my hand  
We will pray  
And we will stand  
In a world  
Crying out for peace  
Let your heart be strong  
For when I am weak  
You will carry me  
  
Sometimes you wonder if the road youre on has a reason  
Its hard to go on when you just dont know  
We can shoulder all the weight of life between us  
Until the fear of what we cannot see is gone  
Cause we were never meant  
To walk this road alone  
We are bound together  
When we say
