Sunrise showing every flaw  
Paying for the night before  
Dark eyes scanning every vein  
Exploding  cannot stand the strain  
  
With each new mile  
They death defy me  
Standing on trial  
Scrutinize me  
  
And questionize my  
  
Strong denial  
  
Bullet bullet train  
Piercing through my brain  
  
Windows illuminating stains  
Breakdown closing in again  
Free fall as I close my eyes  
Voices talking many lies  
  
Changing my course  
Blurred and scorched  
Breathing exhaust  
As we distort  
  
By gravity  
  
Of such Gforce  
  
Bullet bullet train  
Piercing through my brain  
  
Breakdown close my eyes  
Voices talking many lies  
Stained glass bursting in  
Shattering my world again  
Free fall but never can  
Ever reach the ground again  
Dark eyes scanning in  
Feel my mind explode within  
  
Wanting much more  
I implore you  
Near to deaths door  
To ignore  
  
The screams of all  
  
Who fall before  
  
Bullet bullet train  
Piercing through my brain  
  
Bullet
