All the stories have been told  
Of kings and days of old  
But theres no England now  
All the wars that were won and lost  
Somehow dont seem to matter very much anymore  
All the lies we were told  
All the lies of the people running round  
Theyre castles have burned  
I see change  
But inside were the same as we ever were  
  
Living on a thin line  
Tell me now what are we supposed to do  
Living on a thin line  
Tell me now what are we supposed to do  
  
Living on a thin line  
Living this way each day is a dream  
What am I what are we supposed to do  
Living on a thin line  
Tell me now what are we supposed to do  
  
Now another century nearly gone  
What are we gonna leave for the young  
What we couldnt do what we wouldnt do  
Its a crime but does it matter  
Does it matter much does it matter much to you  
Does it ever really matter  
Yes it really really matters  
  
Living on a thin line  
Tell me now what are we supposed to do  
Living on a thin line  
Tell me now what are we supposed to do  
  
Now another leader says  
Break their hearts and break some heads  
Is there nothing we can say or do  
Blame the future on the past  
Always lost in bloody guts  
And when theyre gone its me and you  
  
Living on a thin line  
Tell me now what are we supposed to do  
Living on a thin line  
Tell me now what are we supposed to do  
Living on a thin line
