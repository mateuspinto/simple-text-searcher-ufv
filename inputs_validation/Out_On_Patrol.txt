Look at my soldier boy now  
With that big gun in your little hand  
As you patrol this foreign land  
Hear the mine that clicks beneath your feet  
  
Now do you see the light  
Fading while your world is crumbling  
Out on patrol  
And all you can do is sit and stare  
What revelation have you now  
What culmination to your speck of life  
Your moment in time  
  
As you sit here all alone  
Will your buddies come and save your life  
But as the enemy appears  
See your life flash before your eyes
