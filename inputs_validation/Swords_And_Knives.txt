A waking world of innocence  
So grave those first born cries  
When life begins with needles and pins  
It ends with Swords and Knives  
Oh dangerman oh dangerman  
Your blade fits like a glove  
When forged in steel  
Time cannot heal  
That blood red bond of love  
In times of trouble youre an open book  
With the change in the way you look  
And its sad loves not enough to make things better  
Turn the tables well burn the fables  
Lies beneath the visions and daydreams  
Fooled by now we mystify the past  
Like a dream like it never happened  
When life begins with needles and pins  
It ends with Swords and Knives  
God save those born to die
