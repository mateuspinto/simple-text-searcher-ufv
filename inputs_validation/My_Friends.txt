My friends are so depressed  
I feel the question  
Of your loneliness  
Confide cause Ill be on your side  
You know I will you know I will  
  
Ex girlfriend called me up  
Alone and desperate  
On the prison phone  
They want to give her seven years  
For being sad  
  
Chorus  
I love all of you  
Hurt by the cold  
So hard and lonely too  
When you dont know yourself  
  
My friends are so distressed  
And standing on  
The brink of emptiness  
No words I know of to express  
This emptiness  
  
Chorus  
  
Imagine me taught by tragedy  
Release is peace  
I heard a little girl  
And what she said  
Was something beautiful  
To give your love  
No matter what  
Ya what she said  
  
Chorus
