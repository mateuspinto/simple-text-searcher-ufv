Mystic knights have come to save our lives  
Mystic knights are here now  
  
Long ago in ancient times  
There was a scroll of magic rhymes  
It prophesied the mystic knights  
The true young heroes brave and bright  
Then the dark forces came  
And brought the people endless pain  
Now the children have no fear  
cause they know the mystic knights are here  
  
Mystic knights have come to save our lives  
Mystic knights have come to save our times  
Mystic knights have come to save our lives  
Mystic knights are here now  
  
Long ago in ancient times  
In the land of Tir Na Nog  
The little people sang their rhymes  
While drawing wisdom from their gold mines  
Now theres happiness in Kells  
cause the little people gave their spells  
The children now no longer fear  
cause the days of mystic knights are here
