Oh the benches were stained with tears and perspiration  
The birdies were flying from tree to tree  
There was little to say there was no conversation  
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree  
And the locusts sang off in the distance  
Yeah the locusts sang such a sweet melody  
Oh the locusts sang off in the distance  
Yeah the locusts sang and they were singing for me  
  
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking  
Darkness was everywhere it smelled like a tomb  
I was ready to leave I was already walkin  
But the next time I looked there was light in the room  
And the locusts sang yeah it give me a chill  
Oh the locusts sang such a sweet melody  
Oh the locusts sang their high whining trill  
Yeah the locusts sang and they were singing for me  
  
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloadin  
The weather was hot anearly ninety degrees  
The man standin next to me his head was exploding  
Well I was prayin the pieces wouldnt fall on me  
Yeah the locusts sang off in the distance  
Yeah the locusts sang such a sweet melody  
Oh the locusts sang off in the distance  
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me  
  
I put down my robe picked up my diploma  
Took hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive  
Straight for the hills the black hills of Dakota  
Sure was glad to get out of there alive  
And the locusts sang well it give me a chill  
Yeah the locusts sang such a sweet melody  
And the locusts sang with a high whinin trill  
Yeah the locusts sang and they was singing for me  
Singing for me well singing for me
