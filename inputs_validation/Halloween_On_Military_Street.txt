  
Chorus  
Fuck Damnit Another Halloween  
People on Military know what this means  
Houses on fire theyre blowin up cars  
Creatures in the streets and razor blades and candy bars  
I went to trickortreat the first house on my block  
Spit in my face and gave my a rock  
I tried to give it back and said Ill take nothing instead  
Turned around and walked away and felt the rock peg me in the head  
Walked to the next house directly next door  
There I saw an old lady dead on the floor  
I said Excuse me miss but do you have a treat  
She lifted her leg and scrapped flakes off her dead feet  
I ran to the next house happy and giddy  
And there I seen a fat woman holding up her titty  
I said Trickortreat she sad Treatortrick  
And squeezed on her titty until itfuck it thats too sick  
Next house up was sittin back in the woods  
I was a lil frightened but fuck I want the goods  
I knocked on the door I heard a knock back  
And then I heard COME ON IN and yo Im like FUCK DAT  
This house belongs to Mrs Cherry Spoon  
She said Drop your drawers and your treat is coming soon  
I quickly grew a stiffy but kept my eyes shut  
A hand came out the mail chute and flicked me in the nuts  
I wobbled to the next house ready for the worst  
And chillin in the drive was a long black hurst  
I rang the door bell and said Is anybody home  
Of course little biy have a sugar coated kidney stone  
I walked throught the field and to the next crib  
Her friendliness could only be in her cooking bib  
I said How bout some candy she said How bout instead  
A nice hot fresh home made loaf of yeast infection bread  
My bags gettin heavy so I rest on the curb  
And riding on his bike her comes little Larry Shurb  
I snuck up behind him and kicked him off his seat  
I punched him in the neck and power bombed him in the street  
Now my bag of candy has doubled in size  
Up to the next house for my scary prize  
Im like trickortreat trick treat tricky dick  
He opened up his door slapped my lips and didnt give me shit  
Rock through his window and ran across the street  
To the Dayton Mansion Im in for a treat  
I dinged on the dong and here comes the butler  
A big gumpy tall ass lurch lookin motherfucker  
I said Hello Mr is there somethin for my sack  
He reached in his pocket but I think he hurt his back  
Its taking him an hour my bag is open ready  
But then he finally dropped it in my sack a fucking penny  
The next house is abandonded so forget it  
But wait a minute I think somebodys livin in it  
I ran up to the door Trickortreat you cant hide  
It was a crackhead he crawled in my bag and died  
The next house is mine the last on the block  
My mothers sitting on the porch shining up her glock  
I climbed on the roof with my brother Jump Steady  
And we yelled HAPPY HALLOWEEN AND CLOWN LOVE to the whole city  
Chorus til fade
