Heard of a van that is loaded with weapons  
Packed up and ready to go  
Heard of some grave sites out by the highway  
A place where nobody knows  
  
The sound of gunfire off in the distance  
Im getting used to it now  
Lived in a brownstone lived in a ghetto  
Ive lived all over this town  
  
This aint no party this aint no disco  
This aint no fooling around  
No time for dancing or lovey dovey  
I aint got time for that now  
  
Transmit the message to the receiver  
Hope for an answer some day  
I got three passports a couple of visas  
You dont even know my real name  
  
High on a hillside the trucks are loading  
Everythings ready to roll  
I sleep in the daytime I work in the nighttime  
I might not ever get home  
  
This aint no party this aint no disco  
This aint no fooling around  
This aint no Mudd Club or C B G B  
I aint got time for that now  
  
Heard about Houston Heard about Detroit  
Heard about Pittsburgh P A  
You oughta know not to stand by the window  
Somebody see you up there  
  
I got some groceries some peanut butter  
To last a couple of days  
But I aint got no speakers aint got no headphones  
Aint got no records to play  
  
Why stay in college Why go to night school  
Gonna be different this time  
Cant write a letter cant send no postcard  
I aint got time for that now  
  
Trouble in transit got through the roadblock  
We blended in with the crowd  
We got computers were tapping phone lines  
I know that that aint allowed  
  
We dress like students we dress like housewives  
Or in a suit and a tie  
I changed my hairstyle so many times now  
I dont know what I look like  
  
You make me shiver I feel so tender  
We make a pretty good team  
Dont get exhausted Ill do some driving  
You ought to get you some sleep  
  
Burned all my notebooks what good are notebooks  
They wont help me survive  
My chest is aching burns like a furnace  
The burning keeps me alive
