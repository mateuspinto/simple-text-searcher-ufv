Our bed we live our bed we sleep  
Making love and I become you  
Flesh is warm with naked feet  
Stabbing thorns and you become me  
  
Oh Id beg for you you know Ill beg for you  
  
Pick a song and sing a yellow nectarine  
Take a bath Ill drink the water that you leave  
If you should die before me ask if you can bring a friend  
Pick a flower hold your breath and drift away  
  
She holds my hand we share a laugh  
Sipping orange blossom breezes  
Love is still and sweat remains  
A cherished gift unselfish feeling  
  
Oh Id beg for you you know Ill beg for you  
  
Pick a song and sing a yellow nectarine  
Take a bath Ill drink the water that you leave  
If you should die before me ask if you could bring a friend  
Pick a flower hold your breath and drift away  
  
She tells me things I listen well  
Drink the wine save the water  
Skin is smooth I steal a glance  
Dragon flies er gliding over  
  
Oh Id beg for you you know Ill beg for you  
  
Pick a song and sing a yellow nectarine  
Take a bath Ill drink the water that you leave  
If you should die before me ask if you could bring a friend  
Pick a flower hold your breath and drift away
