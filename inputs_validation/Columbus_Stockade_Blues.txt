Way down in Columbus Georgia wanna be back in Tennessee  
Way down in Columbus Stockade friends have turned their backs on me  
Go on and leave me if you wish to never let me cross your mind  
In your heart you love another leave me little darlin I dont mind  
Way down in Columbus Georgia  
 fiddle  guitar   
Way down in Columbus Georgia  
Leave me little darlin I dont mind leave me little darlin I dont mind
