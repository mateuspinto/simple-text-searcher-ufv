Looking down on empty streets all she can see  
Are the dreams all made solid  
Are the dreams all made real  
  
All of the buildings all of those cars  
Were once just a dream  
In somebodys head  
  
She pictures the broken glass she pictures the steam  
She pictures a soul  
With no leak at the seam  
  
Lets take the boat out  
Wait until darkness  
Lets take the boat out  
Wait until darkness comes  
  
Nowhere in the corridors of pale green and grey  
Nowhere in the suburbs  
In the cold light of day  
There in the midst of it so alive and alone  
Words support like bone  
  
Dreaming of Mercy Street  
Wear your inside out  
Looking for mercy  
In your daddys arms again  
Dreaming of Mercy Street  
Swear they moved that sign  
Looking for mercy  
In your daddys arms  
  
Pulling out the papers from drawers that slide smooth  
Tugging at the darkness word upon word  
Confessing all the secret things in the warm velvet box  
To the priest hes the doctor  
He can handle the shocks  
Dreaming of the tenderness the tremble in the hips  
Of kissing Marys lips  
  
Dreaming of Mercy Street  
Wear your inside out  
Dreaming of mercy  
In your daddys arms again  
Dreaming of Mercy Street  
Swear they moved that sign  
Looking for mercy  
In your daddys arms  
  
Looking for mercy  
Looking for mercy  
Looking for mercy  
Mercy mercy  
  
Anne with her father is out in the boat  
Riding the water  
Riding the waves on the sea
