The summer air was soft and warm  
The feeling right the Paris night  
Did its best to please us  
And strolling down the Elysee  
We had a drink in each cafe  
And you  
You talked of politics philosophy and I  
Smiled like Mona Lisa  
We had our chance  
It was a fine and true romance  
  
I can still recall our last summer  
I still see it all  
Walks along the Seine laughing in the rain  
Our last summer  
Memories that remain  
  
We made our way along the river  
And we sat down in the grass  
By the Eiffel tower  
I was so happy we had met  
It was the age of no regret  
Oh yes  
Those crazy years that was the time  
Of the flowerpower  
But underneath we had a fear of flying  
Of getting old a fear of slowly dying  
We took the chance  
Like we were dancing our last dance  
  
I can still recall our last summer  
I still see it all  
In the tourist jam round the Notre Dame  
Our last summer  
Walking hand in hand  
  
Paris restaurants  
Our last summer  
Morning croissants  
Living for the day worries far away  
Our last summer  
We could laugh and play  
  
And now youre working in a bank  
The family man the football fan  
And your name is Harry  
How dull it seems  
Are you the hero of my dreams  
  
I can still recall our last summer  
I still see it all  
Walks along the Seine laughing in the rain  
Our last summer  
Memories that remain  
I can still recall our last summer  
I still see it all  
In the tourist jam round the Notre Dame  
Our last summer  
Walking hand in hand  
Paris restaurants  
Our last summer  
Morning croissants  
Living for the day worries far away
