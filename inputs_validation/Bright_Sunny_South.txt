From the bright sunny south to the war I was sent  
Eer the days of my boyhood I scarcely had spent  
From its cool shady forests and deep flowing streams  
Ever fond in my memry and sweet in my dreams  
Oh my dear little sister I still see her tears  
When I had to leave home in our tender years  
And my sweet gentle mother so dear to my heart  
It grieved me sincerely when we had to part  
Said my kindhearted father as he took my hand  
As you go in defence of our dear native land  
Son be brave but show mercy whenever you can  
Our hearts will be with you til you turn again  
In my bag theres a bible to show me the way  
Through my twelfth year on earth and to Heaven some day  
I will shoulder my musket and brandish my sword  
In defence of this land and the word of the Lord
