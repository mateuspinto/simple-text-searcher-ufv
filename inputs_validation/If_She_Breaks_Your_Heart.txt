My love is gone with yesterday my love is gone  
With yesterday  
  
We had a love for all seasons  
At least thats how it used to be  
There was no time space or reason  
More special to us than we  
  
My love continued to flourish  
As a flower blooms in spring  
Then you tried to play love for silly  
But the loser is the fool who doesnt play  
Love by the rules  
  
If she breaks your heart  
I will send a robin to sing happy tunes for you  
Cause I may not be around to do the things  
I used to do  
And if you awake to find youre lost  
I will send a glad star to lead you on your way  
Cause the love I felt inside  
Has gone away with yesterday  
  
My love is gone with yesterday my love is gone  
With yesterday  
  
There was a time when forever  
Was commonplace for me and you  
Laughing loving sharing caring  
Seemed to be made just for us two  
But I kept on building the dream world  
That I thought was you and I  
Sorry Im sadly mistaken  
Cause our castle in the sky  
Has turned into a mere goodbye  
  
Well if she breaks your heart  
I will send a robin to sing happy tunes for you  
Cause I may not be around to do the things  
I used to do  
And if you awake to find youre lost  
I will send a glad star to lead you on your way  
Cause the love I felt inside  
Has gone away with yesterday  
Has gone away with yesterday  
  
My love is gone away with yesterday my love is gone  
With yesterday  
My love is gone away with yesterday my love is gone  
With yesterday
