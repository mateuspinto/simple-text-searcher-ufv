Born alone and left to die  
Rejected often criticized  
Hid behind the childhood lies  
Everything has changed since the blood  
Since the blood since the blood  
Oh the blood  
  
Born alone and left to die  
Rejected often criticized  
Hid behind the childhood lies  
Everything has changed since the blood  
Falling on us  
Since the blood it gave me purpose  
Since the blood it says youre for us  
Since the blood who can be against us  
  
Hopeless fallen from the air  
Reaching but no hand is there  
Screaming quiet no one cares  
I might as well have died  
But the blood falling on us  
But the blood it gave me purpose  
But the blood it says youre for us  
Oh the blood who can be against us oh  
  
Oh the cleansing power  
That takes the guilt away Jesus  
The lamb was sacrificed now we  
No longer fear the grave yes Jesus  
No more condemnation hallelujah  
The debt of man is paid  
  
By the blood by the blood  
But for the blood  
By the blood by the blood  
But for the blood  
  
Now we are never alone your  
Your blood it makes us strong now  
Now there is power to move on we are  
Never we are never alone  
  
Now we are never alone  
Your blood it makes us strong  
Now there is power to move on  
Never we are never alone
