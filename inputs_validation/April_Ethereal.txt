It was me peering through the lookingglass  
Beyond the embrace of Christ  
Like the secret face within the tapestry  
Like a bird of prey over the crest  
And she was swathed in sorrow as if born within its mask  
Her candlelight snuffed the icon smiled  
Emptiness followed by her wake  
I could clasp her in undying love  
Within ghostlike rapture the final word was mine  
She faced me in awe twas a token of ebony color  
Embodied in faint vapor  
Wandering through Aprils fire  
Compelled to grasp and to hold the one that was you  
I will endure hide away  
I would outrun the scythe glaring with failure  
It is a mere destiny I thought a threshold I had crossed before  
The rain was waving goodbye and when the night came  
The forest folded its branches around me  
Something passed by and I went into a dream  
She laughing and weeping at once take me away  
I dont know how or why Ill never know when
