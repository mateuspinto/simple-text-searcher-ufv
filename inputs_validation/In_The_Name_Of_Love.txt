I know that love could realign the phases of the moon  
Yet it comes and goes like a wave of a stranger  
And as we stumble for the truth  
Were caught in a web of lies  
Is nothin worth a damn without the danger  
Were lost in a world of illusive dreams  
Where every story has a desperate ring  
We got a right to happiness in the name of love  
And though sometimes we may forget  
To give it all we possess  
We gotta try for what we get in the name of love  
And without pause or regret searching only for the best  
We could see the light unfold right before our eyes  
Blinded by the tears we get lost in the shadows  
Oh But the heart is a wondrous thing  
Surviving the thunder outlasting the rain  
We got a right to happiness in the name of love  
And though sometimes we may forget  
To give it all we possess  
We gotta try for what we get in the name of love  
And without pause or regret searching only for the best  
Oh But the heart is a wondrous thing  
Surviving the thunder outlasting the rain  
We got a right to happiness in the name of love  
And may be sometimes we may forget  
To give it all we possess  
We gotta try for what we get in the name of love  
And without pause or regret  
Searching only for the best  
Try name of love  
Try in the name of love
