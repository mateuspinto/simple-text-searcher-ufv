The head of a hunt on the wall by a painting  
An upright piano stood locked by the door  
In through the window  
The light was fast fading  
While I split my whiskey  
All over the floor  
Making a mess of my words so  
I was trying  
To impress the Empress with  
My wimpy tales  
Fanning her face from cigar smoke  
And sighing  
I had come close to be miles  
From her trail  
  
She was the jewel that  
Sparkled in darkness  
She was the love  
Of everyones life  
She was the catch at  
Everyones parties  
She was the one with a tongue  
Like a knife  
  
Her bosoms curved perfectly  
Lit by the fire  
My mind launched away  
In a sea of its own  
Her grace and her tightness  
I had to admire  
Through a whores breath of stories  
I happily told  
  
Trespassing my hand  
Fell into hot water  
She shot like a bullet  
Right out of her chair  
She led me away and I  
Was then slaughtered  
By the warmth of her body  
And her love and care  
  
Her tongue cut away  
And the wounds slowly opened  
I lay on the sails of the  
Ship of romance  
Drunk as I could be and  
Broker than broken and  
The head of my hunt  
Was there in my hands
