I remembered black skies  
The lightning all around me  
I remembered each flash  
As time began to blur  
Like a startling sign  
That fate had finally found me  
  
And your voice was all I heard  
That I get what I deserve  
  
So give me reason  
To prove me wrong  
To wash this memory clean  
Let the floods cross  
The distance in your eyes  
  
Give me reason  
To fill this hole  
Connect the space between  
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies  
Across this new divide  
  
There was nothing in sight  
But memories left abandoned  
There was nowhere to hide  
The ashes fell like snow  
And the ground caved in  
Between where we were standing  
  
And your voice was all I heard  
That I get what I deserve  
  
So give me reason  
To prove me wrong  
To wash this memory clean  
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes  
Across this new divide  
  
In every loss  
In every lie  
In every truth that youd deny  
And each regret  
And each goodbye  
Was a mistake to great to hide  
  
And your voice was all I heard  
That I get what I deserve  
  
So give me reason  
To prove me wrong  
To wash this memory clean  
Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes  
  
Give me reason  
To fill this hole  
Connect the space between  
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies  
Across this new divide  
  
Across this new divide  
Across this new divide
