I know its been some time  
But theres something on my mind  
You see I havent been the same  
Since that cold November day  
We said we needed space  
But all we found was an empty place  
And the only things I learned  
Is that I need you desperately  
  
So here I am  
And can you please tell me oh  
  
Chorus  
Where do broken hearts go  
Can they find their way home  
Back to the open arms  
Of a love thats waiting there  
And if somebody loves you  
Wont they always love you  
I look in your eyes  
And I know that you still care for me  
  
Ive been around enough to know  
That dreams dont turn to gold  
And that there is no easy way  
No you just cant run away  
And what we have is so much more  
Than we ever had before  
And no matter how I try  
Youre always on my mind  
  
So here I am  
And can you please tell me oh  
  
Where do broken hearts go  
Can they find their way home  
Back to the open arms  
Of a love thats waiting there  
And if somebody loves you  
Wont they always love you  
I look in your eyes  
And I know that you still care for me  
  
And now that I am here with you  
Ill never let you go  
I look into your eyes  
And now I know now I know  
  
Where do broken hearts go  
Can they find their way home  
Back to the open arms  
Of a love thats waiting there  
And if somebody loves you  
Wont they always love you  
I look in your eyes  
And I know that you still care  
  
Where do broken hearts go  
Can they find their way home  
Back to the open arms  
Of a love thats waiting there  
And if somebody loves you  
Wont they always love you  
I look in your eyes  
And I know that you still care for me for me  
You still care for me
