Theres a cowboy in the jungle  
And he looks so out of place  
With his shrimp skin boots and his cheap Cheroots  
And his skin as white as paste  
  
Headin south to Paraguay  
Where the gauchos sing and shout  
Now hes stuck in Porto Bello  
Since his money all ran out  
So he hangs out with the sailors  
Might and day theyre raisin hell  
And his original destinations just another  
Story that he loves to tell  
  
With no plans for the future  
He still seems in control  
From a bronco ride to a ten foot tide  
He just had to learn to roll  
  
Roll with the punches  
Play all of his hunches  
Made the best of whatever came his way  
What he lacked in ambition  
He made up with intuition  
Plowing straight ahead come what may  
  
Steel band in the distance  
And their music floats across the bay  
While American women in muumuus  
Talk about all the things they did today  
And their husbands quack about fishing  
As they slug those rum drinks down  
Discussing who caught what  
and who sat on his butt  
But its the only show in town  
  
Theyre tryin to drink all the punches  
They all may lose their lunches  
Tryin to cram lost years into five or six says  
Seems that blind ambition erased their intuition  
Plowin straight ahead come what may  
  
I dont want to live on that kind of island  
No I dont want to swim in a roped off sea  
Too much for me too much for me  
Ive got to be where the wind and the water are free  
  
Alone on a midnight passage  
I can count the falling stars  
While the Southern Cross and the satellites  
They remind me of where we are  
Spinning around in circles  
Living it day to day  
And still twenty four hours maybe sixty good years  
Its still not that long a stay  
  
Weve gotta roll with the punches  
Learn to play all of our hunches  
Makin the best of whatever comes your way  
Forget that blind ambition  
And learn to trust your intuition  
Plowin straight ahead come what may  
And theres a cowboy in the jungle
