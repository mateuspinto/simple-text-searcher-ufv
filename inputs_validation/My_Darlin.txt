I walked through a pool of water and I seen the shadow of a broken hearted
girl  
Pictured us walking to the altar for better or for worse  
  
Why dont you stand stand by me oh my darling stand by me  
We gon make a movie a movie and its gon be in three D in three D  
We gon make a movie a movie and its gon be in three D in three D  
Why dont you stand stand by me oh my darling stand by me stand by me  
  
I aint pop no Molly but you still got me sweating  
What happened to that feeling Well never get it back  
I aint take no shots but you still got me hot  
What happened to that feeling I wish it wouldnt stop  
  
We were supposed to be together  
We were supposed to be together  
  
They say that love can hit you so fast  
Plenty odds are running out of time  
But ours is on the border walk baby  
Take me as I am or not  
I cant breathe without you without you as mine  
  
Why dont you stand stand by me oh my darling stand by me  
We gon make a movie a movie and its gon be in three D in three D  
We gon make a movie a movie and its gon be in three D in three D  
  
Stand by me yeah my darling stand by me yeah  
Yeah three D yeah movie we gon make a three D three D  
  
Why dont you stand stand by me oh my darling stand by me  
We gon make a movie a movie and its gon be in three D in three D  
We gon make a movie a movie and its gon be in three D three D  
Why dont you stand stand by me oh my darling stand by me
