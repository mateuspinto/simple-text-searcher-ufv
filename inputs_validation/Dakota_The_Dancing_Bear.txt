Betty drove the semi she pulled up to the pump  
I thought I wanted a CocaCola and I started out on the jump  
She said hold it Dave come quick theres something you gotta see  
That man had got a dancing bear tied up to that old tree  
I said dance dance Dakota dance all around the country store  
Me and sweet Betty aint never seen a bear that could dance before  
Well its one step two steps three steps four  
A bottle of soda and hell dance some more  
Dance dance Dakota dance all around the country store  
  
Well these hippies walked up to the cage giving pills to that ole bear  
I dont know what it was they was giving to him it had him pulling out his
hair  
I tried to keep time with the music Lord with the beat on my tamborine  
Gave him some wine from a Mason jar and we all began to sing  
I said dance dance Dakota dance
