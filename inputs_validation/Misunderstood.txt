Waiting  
In the calm of desolation  
Wanting to break  
From this circle of confusion  
  
Sleeping  
In the depths of isolation  
Trying to wake  
From this daydream of illusion  
  
How can I feel abandoned even when the world surrounds me  
How can I bite the hand that feeds the strangers all around me  
How can I know so many  
Never really knowing anyone  
  
If I seem superhuman  
I have been  
Misunderstood  
  
It challenges the essence of my soul  
And leaves me in a state of disconnection  
As I navigate the maze of self control  
  
Playing a lion being led to a cage  
I turn from a thief to a beggar  
From a god to God save me  
  
How can I feel abandoned even when the world surrounds me  
How can I bite the hand that feeds the strangers all around me  
How can I know so many  
Never really knowing anyone  
  
If I seem superhuman  
I have been  
Misunderstood  
  
Playing a lion being led to a cage  
I turn from surreal to seclusion  
From love to disdain  
From belief to delusion  
From a thief to a beggar  
From a god to God save me  
  
How can I feel abandoned even when the world surrounds me  
How can I bite the hand that feeds the strangers all around me  
How can I know so many  
Never really knowing anyone  
  
If I seem superhuman  
I have been  
Misunderstood
