When the world turns you away  
A friend will not say no  
There is strength that we all have  
Its not the strength we show  
And in your darkest hour  
In your darkest nights  
Whatever life will do  
I am here for you  
Think of me wherever you are  
When it seems like youre reaching the end  
Call on me know in your heart  
On one you can always depend  
I am thy friend  
Though were far away  
The stars above are the same  
And when you feel alone  
Theres one who shares your pain  
A true friend has no price  
There is none to pay  
I remember you stood by me  
Im with you all the way  
Think of me wherever you are  
When it seems like youre reaching the end  
Call on me know in your heart  
One who will always defend  
I am thy friend  
Think of me wherever you are  
When it seems like youre reaching the end  
Call on me know in your heart  
On one you can always depend  
I am thy friend  
Think of me wherever you are  
When it seems like youre reaching the end  
Call on me know in your heart  
One who will always defend  
I am thy friend
