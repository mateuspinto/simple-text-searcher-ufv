Oh come all you young fellers so young and so fine  
Seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine  
Itll form as a habit and seep in your soul  
Till the stream of your blood runs as black as the coal  
Where its dark as a dungeon damp as the dew danger is double pleasures are
few  
Where the rain never falls the sun never shines  
Its a dark as a dungeon way down in the mine  
  
Well its many a man that Ive seen in my day  
uh huh no laughing during this song please its being recorded  
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine  
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine  
And pray when Im dead and my ages shall roll  
That my body would blacken and turn into coal  
Then Ill look from the door of my heavenly home and pity the miner digging my
bones  
Where its dark as a dungeon
