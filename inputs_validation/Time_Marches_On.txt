Time marches on mountains may turn to dust  
The world outside may crumble and fall  
This love that we share wont be touched by the hands of time  
It will last till the sands of time have withered away  
  
Time marches on oceans may disappear  
But my love for you wont ever change  
Though time may go our love will grow  
And last from day to day while time marches on  
Our love is here to stay  
  
Time marches on mountains may turn to dust  
The world outside may crumble and fall  
This love that we share wont be touched by the hands of time  
It will last till the sands of time have withered away  
  
Time marches on oceans may disappear  
But my love for you wont ever change  
Though time may go our love will grow  
And last from day to day while time marches on  
Our love is here our love is here to stay
