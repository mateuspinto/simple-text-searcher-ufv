You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain  
Too much love drives a man insane  
You broke my will oh what a thrill  
Goodness gracious great balls of fire  
  
You came on over and took over my heart  
You came along and moved me honey  
I cannot lie you are so fine  
Goodness gracious great balls of fire

Come on over baby Love me like a lover should  
Your fine so kind told this world that your mine mine mine

Goodness gracious great balls of fire

Goodness gracious great balls of fire  
Goodness gracious great balls of fire  
  
You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain  
Too much love drives a man insane
