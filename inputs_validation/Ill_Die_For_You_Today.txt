Come in close to me and bring me joy  
Lift me higher much higher and higher than light allows  
I wanted to be everything everything for you  
I wanted you I needed you I thought that you did too  
You built me beauty and took it all away  
And I cant face another day  
Ill die for you today  
  
Tempt me sweet tempest  and shower me with stars  
I want to be as beautiful as you  
Take me to the summit and show me  
Show me all that I could ever have  
You brought me everything I ever thought I wanted  
And now you take it all away  
You gave me love and then you killed me blindly  
I think Ill die for you today I cant persue another way  
Ill die for you today  
  
Like a garden growin in flames  
A forest filled with fear of the wind  
Like the moon so beautiful from afar  
But shattered on the surface full of scars  
A sea with no more fish planets without air  
Whales with no more song  
I know Im gonna die with them today  
Ill die for you today
