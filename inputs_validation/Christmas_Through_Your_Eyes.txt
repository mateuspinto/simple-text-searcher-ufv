Till I had you I didnt know  
That I was missing out  
Had to grow up and see the world  
Through different shades of doubt  
Give me one more chance to dream again  
One more chance to feel again  
Through your young heart  
If only for one day help me try  
I wanna see Christmas through your eyes  
I want everything to be the way it used to be  
Back to being a child again thinking the world was mine  
I wanna see Christmas Christmas through your eyes  
I see the rain you see the rainbow  
Hiding in the clouds  
Never afraid to let your love show  
Wont you show me how  
Wanna learn how to believe again  
Find the innocence in me again  
Through your young heart  
Help me find a way help me try  
I wanna see Christmas through your eyes  
I want everything to be the way it used to be  
Back to being a child again thinking the world was kind  
I wanna see Christmas Christmas through your eyes  
I wanna see Christmas through your eyes  
I want everything to be the way it used to be  
Back to being a child again thinking the world was mine  
I wanna see Christmas Christmas through your eyes  
I wanna see Christmas  
I wanna see Christmas  
I wanna see Christmas through your eyes  
I wanna see  
I wanna see Christmas  
I wanna see  
I wanna see Christmas through your eyes  
I wanna see  
I wanna see Christmas  
I wanna see Christmas  
I wanna see Christmas through your eyes  
I wanna see Christmas  
I wanna see Christmas through your eyes
