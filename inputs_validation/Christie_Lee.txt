Let me tell you a story  
About a woman and a man  
Maybe you will find familiar  
Maybe you wont understand  
The mans name I dont remember  
He was always Joe to me  
But I cant forget the woman  
She was always Christie Lee  
He was working in a night club  
Thats where he played the saxophone  
He used to fake to stock arrangements  
He left the customers alone  
But one night before the last song  
About a quarter after three  
He saw her standing at the coat check  
And made his move on Christie Lee  
Christie Lee Christie Lee  
Christie Lee Christie Lee  
She was a nice piece of music  
She had a rhythm all her own  
He blew a solo like a blind man  
She really dug his saxophone  
She wanted more than just an encore  
And he could play in every key  
He left the stage and packed his alto  
And took it home with Christie Lee  
Oh I heard the man knew the Bird like the Bible  
You know the man could blow an educated axe  
He couldnt see that Christie Lee was a woman  
Who didnt need another lover  
All she wanted was the sax  
It took a while for him to notice  
It took a while for him to see  
He was never in control here  
It was always Christie Lee  
Christie Lee Christie Lee  
Christie Lee Christie Lee  
Oh the man took a calculated gamble  
Yes the man had the power to perform  
But Christie Lee was more than he knew how to handle  
She didnt need him as a man  
All she wanted was the horn  
They say that Joe became a wino  
They say he always drinks alone  
They say he stumbles like a blind man  
They say he sold his saxophone  
Even the band must face the music  
Thats what the moral is to me  
The only time you hit the high note  
Is when you play for Christie Lee  
Christie Lee Christie Lee  
Christie Lee Christie Lee
