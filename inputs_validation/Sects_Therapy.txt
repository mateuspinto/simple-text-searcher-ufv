Lead vocal frankie howerd  
  
I was lonely and depressed  
Having fled the family home  
When I met an old acquaintance  
I had only barely known  
  
And I told her over tea  
Of my worries and my woes  
And a morbid fear of eating beans  
In tightly fitting clothes  
  
And she said psychoanalysis was just the thing for me  
And she knew a mayfair analyst I really ought to see  
  
So I went round to his rooms  
And he saw me right away  
Though he asked a sum of money I could Ill afford to pay  
  
But I lay down on the couch  
By a bowl of flaccid flowers  
And I talked and talked and talked and talked  
For hours and hours and hours  
And he told me tales of oedipus with great authority  
  
And he asked me if my mother  
Wore stiletto heels and rubber  
And I realised that this poor soul  
Was more confused than me  
  
Well the shock was so profound  
That I fled into the strand  
Where I saw a hare krishna group  
And joined in with the band  
  
This was just the life for me  
Free of worldly goods and care  
And I chanted and I ranted  
Round and round trafalgar square  
  
I converted tens of thousands and they joined us then and there  
  
But the bagwan was so jealous  
That he called me over zealous  
Then he threw me out  
When I refused to cut off all my hair  
  
dr Ruth dr Ruth why not write to dr Ruth  
  
So I wrote to dr Ruth  
And she helpfully proposed  
I should join a nudist colony  
And throw away my clothes  
  
All that sun upon my flesh  
Would set my libido free  
And would guarentee much more of it  
Whatever it may be  
  
But I dont feel that I was quite equipped for such a life  
  
Fair of skin just like my sisters  
Too much sun would give me blisters  
So I think Ill turn the whole thing in  
  
And go home to the wife
