I want to feel you hesitate  
I want to feel you pull away  
I want to feel you realize  
That I am not love come to play  
  
I want to feel your pink clean skin  
I want to feel your purity  
I want to feel you touch my pain  
I want to drown in your misery  
  
Chorus  
Hey bitch this is what you are  
Purified sanctified sacrificed  
Hey bitch this is what you are  
Purified sanctified sacrificed  
This is what you are  
  
I want to feel your innocence  
I want to hear you beg for Him  
I want to be your animal  
I want to be your only sin  
  
I want to tear your dreams away  
And show you hopes last sanctuary  
I want to dip your wings in blood  
And watch an angel bleed for me  
  
Chorus
